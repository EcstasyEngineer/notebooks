You know, you know what I forgot to do? I forgot to actually copy and paste the Fuji Tech model in

02:01.000 --> 02:19.000

I think I need to make it big. Oh God, I don't think this is gonna work. I have I was ready to tape this on my head

03:11.080 --> 03:13.680
Tape it to my boobs, that's a good idea actually

03:14.640 --> 03:19.480
There you go, I'll put one on each tit

03:20.360 --> 03:27.040
But look hold on let me just throw this off to the side real quick look at the amazingness

03:28.840 --> 03:30.840
That Toma did today look

03:32.520 --> 03:35.160
We were just in call hanging out in Chattin

03:36.960 --> 03:40.480
And I'm like I'm like oh my come my my

03:40.880 --> 03:45.680
My model is really lagging while trying to run the game. She's like I got you

03:47.360 --> 03:52.480
And I was like I'm about to draw myself as a like a little like stick figure puppet thing

03:52.480 --> 03:57.000
She's like bet and then she's like no I got you and then I

03:57.920 --> 04:01.760
watched an amazement as she quickly whipped me up into a

04:02.960 --> 04:05.640
perfect muppet version of myself

04:05.640 --> 04:14.080
And it is I am you guys don't understand how happy I am

Tomas twitch and my pinned please give her a follow. She loves doing drawing streams. She loves doodling

04:35.640 --> 04:38.280
She loves watching cartoons. She loves playing games

04:38.920 --> 04:42.520
With her audience. She is one of the most wholesome comfy streamers

04:43.560 --> 04:47.560
I have ever met and I'm so thankful to call her my friend

04:48.600 --> 04:53.000
Because she envisioned me in the most beautiful way my true form

04:55.000 --> 04:58.680
Rise tarnish, so I'm gonna be over here

05:00.120 --> 05:04.440
Let me make myself a little bit smaller so you can see my wonderful little hand holding me up

05:06.520 --> 05:12.440
And a little eyebrows, I'm gonna put this put this helmet on my my booba

05:15.160 --> 05:18.120
We'll do one and then

05:20.680 --> 05:23.920

Let me duplicate copy

05:31.880 --> 05:33.880

05:42.680 --> 05:46.600
Thank you, I feel I feel I just feel so alive

05:48.280 --> 05:50.280
Are we I just feel

05:50.920 --> 05:53.800
Like I'm my true self in this this form

05:55.240 --> 05:56.520
Uh

05:56.520 --> 05:58.520
I I showed off

05:58.920 --> 06:01.960
my Muppet form in the discord and my

06:02.600 --> 06:07.320
Management just responded with just five nights at Friday's music

06:10.680 --> 06:16.360
I'm protected where it counts, you know, I have the highest level of armor, you know, okay, I need to

06:19.400 --> 06:24.600
Set things up a little bit more properly. Hold on. This is gonna be loud for you guys. Let me turn that down

06:25.160 --> 06:27.160
Okay

06:35.320 --> 06:42.840
Oh my glorious day, I am so happy to be alive. I'm so glad to be here

06:45.400 --> 06:47.640
I'm a fucking Muppet ladies and gentlemen

06:47.800 --> 06:55.880
Um, but yes, I am a Muppet because this outlandering really taxes my pc

06:56.840 --> 07:00.440
So I thought it would be a good idea. I was gonna whip up

07:01.080 --> 07:03.080
Um, a PNG batoma came in clutch

07:03.720 --> 07:08.440
Um, we're going I don't know if I'm going to try to speed run

07:10.200 --> 07:14.520
To get to the dlc. I'll be honest with you. I highly doubt that I can do that

07:15.000 --> 07:18.280
So what I'm thinking and this has been a goal of mine

07:20.040 --> 07:22.040
Elden ring is near and dear to my heart

07:23.080 --> 07:28.600
I think I should make Elden ring a running series and this will be the game the the souls like I beat on stream

07:29.880 --> 07:31.880
Maybe I don't know

07:32.920 --> 07:36.920
Honestly, I'm quite embarrassed to

07:38.680 --> 07:44.360
Play this game because I'm not good at souls likes. I enjoy them a lot. I'm not good at them though

07:45.480 --> 07:47.480
um

07:47.880 --> 07:49.240
but

07:49.240 --> 07:54.280
I love this game a lot like that's why I named one of my fucking cats after one of the characters

07:55.320 --> 07:57.320
I was when I was

07:57.720 --> 08:03.160
In such a dark place when this game came out and this game brought me back to the light

08:03.320 --> 08:07.080
I I rose as tarnished. I became the Elden Lord

08:09.720 --> 08:13.960
Actually, I became Lord of the frenzy flame in my ending that I you know beat the game in but it's whatever

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
um

08:16.520 --> 08:19.800
I've seen the cart bot animations of elderly. I have not helped look that up

08:20.200 --> 08:28.280
I remember pouring over the lore pouring over the builds because I'd never like played a game of scaling before like a all that stuff

08:29.240 --> 08:31.240
And I realized how much I enjoyed it

08:32.040 --> 08:34.040
um

08:34.760 --> 08:40.280
I always like to the guidance of grace. Yes. I always used to like sing to myself

08:41.000 --> 08:43.880
While playing elderly ring reach out and touch grace

08:46.360 --> 08:49.000
Um, yes, I'm a muppet

08:55.080 --> 08:56.440
But

08:56.440 --> 09:00.120
Yeah, we'll try I want to try it would be cool to beat this again. I play

09:00.600 --> 09:03.560
I'm not like scrawny. I don't beat games in like a short amount of time

09:03.720 --> 09:09.640
I take a very long time like she just like a hundred percented assassins created like two days. I I can't

09:10.440 --> 09:13.880
I think when I played and beat the game I had like 200 out. No

09:15.640 --> 09:17.640
Was it 200 hours? I don't know

09:18.600 --> 09:20.440
Because I like to explore

09:20.440 --> 09:24.600
I know there's even so much more that I haven't even found yet and I've been all over the place

09:25.560 --> 09:29.960
I'm debating whether or not to do some like cheesing in terms of like, um

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
Getting extra runes and shit

09:34.360 --> 09:37.720
Uh, or just like really going for it

09:37.720 --> 09:43.160
Getting all the bells took you 200 out. Oh, you got all the bell. I did not bother with that

09:45.240 --> 09:51.480
What is the shiba model? What do you mean? This is I don't look any different. I'm the same

09:54.280 --> 09:59.640
Sorry, I need this so it's fine if you want to as well. I yeah, because normally, you know, I'd like go to caled

10:00.280 --> 10:03.640
Kill that dragon that's already kind of half dead get the runes level up

10:04.440 --> 10:08.680
Um, but I kind of just want to go on a little trip with you guys, you know

10:14.360 --> 10:17.880
Just want to go on a little trip. I think I want to go on this adventure together

10:19.320 --> 10:22.120
Wait, where did obs go? It just disappeared as I was talking

10:25.000 --> 10:27.080
I'm wondering if I should eat something before I start

10:30.280 --> 10:32.600
Episode of Muppets is this it's the banned one

10:34.200 --> 10:36.200
It's

10:37.160 --> 10:39.160
Fun to pull the cradle

10:39.240 --> 10:46.040
It's on pc. Yes. I have beat uh, so I've never played elden ring on pc. I've only played it on my playstation

10:47.400 --> 10:49.000
um

10:49.000 --> 10:50.680
Maybe wise if you're gonna go for a while, you know, yeah

10:50.760 --> 10:54.760
I was so caught up chatting and having fun watching toma draw my lovely

10:55.880 --> 11:01.240
My true form that I forgot to have a snack. So I'm gonna grab some snackies and a drink

11:03.640 --> 11:05.640
So fun

11:05.640 --> 11:07.640
Reina's doing well everybody

11:07.880 --> 11:09.880
Right reina

11:12.200 --> 11:14.360
She has been snuggling with me all that's fine

11:16.040 --> 11:18.040
You're such a speedy gal

11:18.440 --> 11:20.440
Where's my water?

11:21.400 --> 11:24.040
Uh, I appreciate you guys for

11:25.240 --> 11:27.240
uh

11:27.320 --> 11:33.160
Understanding they'd be canceling and stuff like on us to be honest with you. I hate canceling and postponing things

11:34.120 --> 11:36.120
um

11:42.360 --> 11:45.880
Because like I'm someone who like I have to see things through

11:47.800 --> 11:49.800
Uh, but I was really sick yesterday

11:51.400 --> 11:57.560
Was a bar. I'm still kind of nauseous today. I don't know if I have food poisoning or uh

11:59.160 --> 12:02.600
My medication is like doing something to me or whatever

12:03.800 --> 12:05.640
But I'm okay

12:05.640 --> 12:07.640
In fact, I'm re-drinking some water repeatedly

12:12.040 --> 12:14.040
Do do do do

12:14.600 --> 12:20.200
I'll first always yeah, I was like toma a messenger and I'm like girl

12:21.320 --> 12:27.400
Uh, I might be only able to stream for like an hour because I don't feel good and she's just like no no get no

12:27.560 --> 12:29.560
We could do this another time stop

12:29.720 --> 12:33.000
I'm like, okay. She's so good. She looks out for me

12:33.640 --> 12:39.400
Um, and then I'm kind of happy she told me to just like get some rest and stuff because I literally after

12:39.880 --> 12:44.440
I finished like messaging her. I literally just puked and then I passed out

12:45.880 --> 12:51.320
No, I don't I don't know. I don't know if I got food poisoning again. Um

12:52.520 --> 12:54.520
I'll make some peanut butter toast

12:56.200 --> 12:59.160
It really sucked because I was really looking forward to the stream

12:59.880 --> 13:04.200
And I think uh, some of you guys are like, it's probably stressed. You're probably right. It could be stressed too

13:04.360 --> 13:09.560
Stress can definitely cause an upset stomach. Um, I always worry about rena. She is older

13:14.200 --> 13:17.640
I'm like you every five but the kitties have been good

13:18.440 --> 13:22.200
I'm good now. I've been sleeping. I slept a lot. I rested a lot

13:23.160 --> 13:25.160
drinking a lot pd light

13:25.240 --> 13:26.680
I uh

13:26.680 --> 13:31.880
Was taking everybody's advice when I asked on my and it's my alt account about

13:33.080 --> 13:35.160
What foods you guys like when you're sick?

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
It was very helpful

13:38.120 --> 13:40.120
I actually almost got some

13:41.880 --> 13:43.880
What is it called

13:43.960 --> 13:49.640
The beef soup the Spanish beef soup ever get something different del res des res ever get

13:50.440 --> 13:54.680
Yeah, and I got ginger ale. She's like, did you have ginger ale and I'm like, yes, I had ginger ale. Thanks mom

13:55.400 --> 13:57.880
Um, yeah, today's been better

13:58.600 --> 14:01.560
Uh, do you still have that puke? How much for it? It was flushed down my toilet

14:02.360 --> 14:04.760
I can I can send you my toilet water

14:05.640 --> 14:09.400
Beef and not chicken. No, I did have chicken soup, but somebody had recommended. Um

14:10.680 --> 14:12.680
Oh my god

14:17.720 --> 14:19.720
Uh, Calda there is

14:20.520 --> 14:24.600
Which is very tasty. I've had it before and I like how hearty it is

14:24.840 --> 14:28.040
I like honestly really want to go to grocery shopping so I can make myself a nice

14:28.680 --> 14:30.440
uh stew

14:30.440 --> 14:32.440
What is this sonic? Oh, oh

14:33.080 --> 14:34.520
Oh my god

14:34.520 --> 14:37.800
This could definitely be interpreted as a sonic. Oh, see. Holy crap

14:38.440 --> 14:42.440
I was your build during the three fingers run. Uh, I was a faith build

14:44.600 --> 14:46.360
um

14:46.360 --> 14:48.360
I scaled with faith and

14:50.360 --> 14:51.880
uh

14:51.880 --> 14:55.640
I was I just really had the halo site the entire time like I farmed

14:55.960 --> 15:02.200
Um that whole part of calid to get all the armor and the halo site in the sphere

15:02.680 --> 15:04.680
um

15:05.800 --> 15:07.880
And then I literally just spammed the fucking

15:09.240 --> 15:11.240
Halo

15:11.960 --> 15:13.960
Uh magic thing

15:14.680 --> 15:18.680
Why do they have to put rabbits in sonic? Why not? Why is twanish?

15:20.600 --> 15:22.600
Hardest boss in your opinion

15:27.960 --> 15:29.960
Uh, the tree sentinel done

15:30.600 --> 15:34.520
I would say tree sentinel just because of like he's the first guy to run into you

15:34.920 --> 15:38.440
But I'm trying to think of who the hardest person I thought was I think

15:38.600 --> 15:40.600
I remember

15:41.160 --> 15:48.360
I was like losing my mind after redawn like I probably spent like so many hours. I think I spent like six hours

15:49.400 --> 15:50.680
fighting redawn

15:50.680 --> 15:53.800
But it was so satisfying when I finally fucking killed him

15:54.760 --> 15:55.880
um

15:55.880 --> 15:59.400
And this is again, it was my allen ring was kind of my true first

15:59.960 --> 16:06.680
Soulslike from soft game that I ever played like I didn't I have I played sakuro. I played dark souls

16:07.240 --> 16:09.240
Uh, I can't remember if it was two or three

16:11.560 --> 16:13.960
I was it two or I can't remember

16:14.280 --> 16:18.760
But like I never played through the game because I didn't know how the game worked in terms of like, yes

16:18.760 --> 16:21.160
It's hard. You're not supposed to just be able to beat things

16:21.880 --> 16:25.800
um like in sakuro and in whatever dark soul games I played

16:26.520 --> 16:32.440
I like was getting so upset because I thought I had to beat the first boss to continue like the first thing you run into

16:32.520 --> 16:34.520
Which is not the case

16:35.400 --> 16:41.000
So I'd say like redawn was hardest because I I had never played the type of game before so it was mentally taxing

16:41.880 --> 16:43.880
um

16:43.960 --> 16:44.920
but

16:44.920 --> 16:46.920
actually

16:47.800 --> 16:49.800
The god skin

16:49.960 --> 16:51.960
Twins were pretty fucking annoying

16:53.160 --> 16:55.160
They were actually really fucking annoying to deal with

16:56.440 --> 16:58.440
I think of it

16:58.440 --> 17:00.440
God I sold her in the beginning as hardest. Yeah

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I forgot to tweet. Why don't you tweet for me?

17:03.960 --> 17:06.360
I bought the dlc. Yes, I did

17:07.480 --> 17:11.480
You guys bought me the game and I said if you bought me the game I'd buy the dlc. So I bought it

17:12.680 --> 17:14.680
It's my toaster

17:22.440 --> 17:24.440
I think also

17:24.440 --> 17:30.920
What I haven't been helping myself out is I've been eating a lot of spicy food, which I can't handle that well

17:30.920 --> 17:32.920
But I eat it anyways

17:35.400 --> 17:39.080
And I think my body has just been rejecting me because I haven't been doing that

17:41.800 --> 17:46.760
Everybody's like stop your white jeans cannot handle this much spice

17:47.880 --> 17:49.880
Let's stop to it immediately

17:50.840 --> 17:52.840
Our life will be forfeit

17:52.840 --> 17:54.840
I

17:58.120 --> 18:01.000
I'm buttering my toe. Wait, this has mold on it

18:03.640 --> 18:07.480
Wait, but I ate toast the other day. I just bought this toast

18:09.480 --> 18:17.240
Oh, no, is that why I've been sick because I've been eating fucking moldy bread. Are you fucking kidding me right now?

18:18.200 --> 18:22.600
Well, so much for I literally just bought this bread. Are you fucking kidding me?

18:25.640 --> 18:28.680
How did this get fucking moldy? Holy shit, that's bad

18:31.480 --> 18:33.480
Okay, well

18:34.360 --> 18:36.360
Never mind

18:39.480 --> 18:41.480
So much for that

18:44.600 --> 18:46.600
Uh

18:47.160 --> 18:49.160
Well

18:52.200 --> 18:56.600
Yeah, toast bread is it? No, it's like it was my normal bread like it's normal bread

18:56.920 --> 19:02.120
I just bought it like a couple days ago and I ate some the other night and I'm wondering why

19:02.440 --> 19:06.520
If that's what's made me sick if you guys I made some in the dark with my glasses off

19:07.160 --> 19:09.160
So I definitely didn't see it

19:17.080 --> 19:19.080
Okay

19:24.760 --> 19:27.560
That's why am I such a failure

19:29.880 --> 19:34.280
Yo favorite girl failure miss she be caught in the bomb

19:36.120 --> 19:38.440
Time to order that pizza. I know I'm like

19:39.160 --> 19:41.160
I'm debating

19:42.120 --> 19:44.280
I'm debating whether I have to order something now

19:45.320 --> 19:50.440
I need to go I just need to go grocery shopping. I that's what I need to do on my day off. I need to go grocery shopping

19:51.320 --> 19:56.120
Boomi, what are you doing? I'm trying to steal stuff. Don't look at me like that

20:00.760 --> 20:02.760
Yeah, why are you purring?

20:02.760 --> 20:10.600
Okay, it doesn't matter. I have rice cakes

20:17.160 --> 20:19.160
Holy rice cakes

20:20.200 --> 20:22.200
I can't believe they were so moldy

20:23.000 --> 20:25.560
I feel sorry for that. I'm so I'm so mad

20:26.760 --> 20:28.760
I put some rice cakes

20:28.760 --> 20:30.760
some peanut butter over rice cakes

20:31.320 --> 20:33.320
And then we'll lunch and have a chat

20:34.200 --> 20:40.120
I'm sorry. I can't see chat because I'm like across my kitchen in the other room. What are you doing?

20:41.720 --> 20:43.720
I mean, what's up?

20:51.080 --> 20:53.080
Hello, can you move mister?

20:53.080 --> 20:55.080
Who?

20:57.800 --> 21:01.320
Boomi just likes to be underfoot as cats often are

21:02.840 --> 21:04.840
He is sitting crittily to the side

21:06.600 --> 21:09.480
And then I don't know where we're going. She probably went to the team

21:11.240 --> 21:13.880
But I hope you guys are having a good day today

21:15.400 --> 21:18.920
I'm very excited to play Ellen ring. I love Ellen ring so much

21:19.880 --> 21:23.880
Oh, so so much. I can't because I know that the game is so big. I know there's so much

21:23.880 --> 21:28.280
I don't even know about even though I felt like several hours and hundred hours into it

21:34.280 --> 21:36.520
And I can't wait for you guys to show me things

21:38.920 --> 21:40.920
Um

21:41.400 --> 21:43.800
You so for one thing I will say

21:45.640 --> 21:47.640
You guys don't have the backseat

21:48.520 --> 21:51.800
I played the game if I need help I'll ask for help

21:53.240 --> 21:55.240
Um

21:56.920 --> 22:01.080
But yeah, like and yeah, also when you guys in since you guys like some of you want to play

22:01.880 --> 22:03.880
I don't know how that will work

22:04.840 --> 22:08.520
Like don't we have I don't know if we have to be like friends on steam and stuff and I can't do that

22:10.120 --> 22:11.640
Um

22:11.640 --> 22:13.640
Okay, I got that

22:13.640 --> 22:15.640
I also have some corn bread

22:15.640 --> 22:17.640
Let me get some corn bread

22:26.200 --> 22:30.440
I think I also have like one little chicken noodle soup can so I could have that for dinner

22:34.280 --> 22:36.280
This veal or just of course bread perhaps

22:36.760 --> 22:39.400
That's why I don't buy bread from this or they don't throw at the bread that's used

22:39.400 --> 22:44.360
Maybe I think that's why because I'm like I just bought this decision. I have not gone bad so soon

22:46.600 --> 22:48.600
Madam you have to press new game

22:49.560 --> 22:51.560
Yeah, no duh. Why are you?

22:52.200 --> 22:54.200
Oh, you're being fucking cheeky. I see you

22:55.480 --> 22:58.040
Uses a password system in game. Oh, okay

22:59.960 --> 23:02.120
There's the same pattern. Oh, okay, that's good to know

23:07.880 --> 23:11.400
Wait is my stream like super laggy again like before

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
Let me see

23:16.600 --> 23:23.720
Why is it that when I did my other stream it automatically

23:25.400 --> 23:27.400
Put it as

23:28.920 --> 23:33.960
High latency and not low latency, but now it's fine make that make sense

23:37.640 --> 23:41.640
Yeah, yeah, it's it's very it's very fun. It's fast. It's good. I'm gonna

23:42.360 --> 23:44.360
Do this that looks fine

23:44.680 --> 23:46.680
barely visible

23:47.720 --> 23:50.360
It's still visible even if I put it at zero so I'll just

23:51.080 --> 23:53.080
Keep it to what it was before

23:53.080 --> 23:55.080
super high

23:55.080 --> 23:59.240
So I can see everything. I'm just about at five to be honest with you because I am fucking blind

24:04.360 --> 24:07.800
Yeah, I literally only got it like three days ago the bread

24:11.640 --> 24:13.640
I

24:14.280 --> 24:16.280
Should be fine

24:20.920 --> 24:25.000
Oh, okay interesting. So last time I was a confessor

24:35.400 --> 24:37.400
So I'm usually someone who does like

24:38.280 --> 24:40.600
One sword and then other hands

24:41.560 --> 24:43.560
Magic

24:44.440 --> 24:49.160
I did I did do kind of a faith arcane bill last time because I used a lot of dragon stuff

24:52.200 --> 24:54.280
And I'm debating whether or not

24:56.680 --> 24:58.680
To

25:00.200 --> 25:05.560
I just think this is funny because it's like the male and the female and the male and the female look exactly the same in the prisoner one

25:05.560 --> 25:11.640
Spell bleed. Yeah, like I usually so I had like the halo scythe

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
And then I also

25:15.480 --> 25:17.480
Would just use like arcane magic

25:18.360 --> 25:19.720
um

25:19.720 --> 25:25.240
And then I would also because I also had the black knife and I would abuse the fuck out of the black knife

25:25.240 --> 25:27.240
I never even had to use like

25:27.640 --> 25:32.360
I would literally just mimic tear and the mimic tear would distract and I would just spam the black knife

25:32.680 --> 25:34.680
Uh special thing

25:40.280 --> 25:42.280
Summarize the easiest one to start I might do that

25:45.960 --> 25:47.960
Liza p has been t- yeah, yeah

25:50.520 --> 25:57.160
I agree with you. Liza p was really fun. I have to I ended up beating that off stream. So that was good

26:02.520 --> 26:05.480
Mimic is a true lord. Imagine there was a plot twist

26:06.120 --> 26:10.680
And like the mimic goes evil. That'd be a cool DLC crunch. I'm eating my rice cake

26:15.560 --> 26:17.800
I kind of want to scale with magic a little bit better

26:22.600 --> 26:24.600
Right

26:32.760 --> 26:42.760
I might do the profit

26:56.920 --> 27:00.760
Remember for one build I did like dual wielding daggers and that was the stupidest thing ever did

27:01.160 --> 27:03.660
Because I just didn't have good daggers. I can't remember the ones I used

27:08.280 --> 27:10.280
Oh

27:10.920 --> 27:12.920
Thank you, Anonymous for new bread

27:14.120 --> 27:16.120
Come get this bread

27:31.240 --> 27:39.240
I'm like debating whether or not retch

27:45.160 --> 27:47.160
It's so funny

27:50.600 --> 27:52.600
Yeah, I can't even more moldy bread

27:52.920 --> 27:59.000
What up what bill did strani go for

28:01.320 --> 28:05.000
Wanting if I should do the no prisoners more intelligence

28:05.960 --> 28:07.560
again, I

28:07.560 --> 28:09.960
like the confessor because I do feel like it's

28:10.680 --> 28:13.720
Easy and well-rounded, but I kind of want to do something else this run

28:17.560 --> 28:19.560
I might go profit I'm wondering if

28:20.520 --> 28:24.920
I'm like should I do something different because I know faith in the arcade and then profit would be good for that

28:25.640 --> 28:28.600
Because I remember when I first played I just picked anyone. I'm like this looks good

28:32.680 --> 28:38.120
Like I didn't do like a mad like I didn't do an intelligence build. I know I've never done an intelligence build

28:44.280 --> 28:47.560
Although I know you can be absolutely cracked with an intelligent intelligence build

28:50.520 --> 28:57.240
Yeah, you know what I might I might go with a stroller drew them because they still

28:59.320 --> 29:01.320
Like they still are pretty good

29:12.600 --> 29:14.600
A prisoner maybe

29:16.520 --> 29:18.520
Prisoner face okay

29:20.520 --> 29:22.520
I

29:27.080 --> 29:29.960
Honestly, I think I prefer the prisoner

29:31.240 --> 29:36.600
Because they have high intelligence. They have good faith in arcane, but they also are level nine and have yeah

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go a prisoner

29:41.240 --> 29:44.840
Yeah, magic glimb blade is a good spell. I think I'll do that

29:46.600 --> 29:48.600
Uh B

29:49.560 --> 29:51.560
My titties are out

29:54.760 --> 29:59.480
I'm telling the space fun to go spellcasting. I know I've never done full spellcasting

29:59.960 --> 30:05.000
I've only usually done like with the weapons, but I also but I like smashing things like I like stabbing things

30:05.560 --> 30:09.720
I'm like already trying to think of like. Oh, I know where this weapon is like. Maybe I should go get that one

30:11.320 --> 30:14.840
They also have a sweet hat. I can knock people I can headbutt with people with it

30:17.240 --> 30:19.240
Playing as a gift for my lord video

30:20.520 --> 30:22.520
Um

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
I'm wondering if I should be a woman or a man

30:29.080 --> 30:33.800
I've made a male build. I did my bandit was a male build, but I'll stay a woman

30:35.160 --> 30:37.160
Age we are mature

30:38.840 --> 30:41.640
Origin prisoner. Oh fucking yo

30:44.280 --> 30:47.960
I'm a little confused by this face and this body type

30:49.560 --> 30:51.560
Uh

30:51.720 --> 30:56.280
Why does it my part of the face is the same? I don't know if I like that

30:58.120 --> 31:00.120
Sorry, let me go back

31:01.880 --> 31:03.880
Keepsake, uh

31:08.680 --> 31:10.680
I'm real last time I did stone sword key

31:12.280 --> 31:16.600
I use that to go to the first grave or whatever fuck it's called

31:20.520 --> 31:22.920
I could get ashes could I go and seed

31:38.200 --> 31:40.360
Apparently gender does matter in speedruns what?

31:42.680 --> 31:46.360
A build did you settle on I'm thinking of uh intelligence faith build

31:46.920 --> 31:51.240
Could I never really play with like the magic?

31:54.200 --> 31:56.200

32:11.480 --> 32:16.440
Yeah, I might do golden seed

32:26.600 --> 32:29.800
I remember I would literally read Shabiri's whoa as Shabari

32:30.520 --> 32:35.800
I was like, oh, yeah Shabari like why would they call it Shabari or like Shabari's great. I just like pronounce it wrong

32:36.040 --> 32:42.200

38:44.040 --> 38:46.040
Nose ridge

38:46.920 --> 38:51.400
Why do I have such a flat what the fuck is up with my face? What is this?

Okay, that's fine

39:59.080 --> 40:01.960
What is happening here I look I'm just

Bro

40:55.240 --> 41:00.120
I'm just gonna be an ugly bitch. I guess that's what I'm gonna. I'm trying to make it look like she be as much as possible

41:01.320 --> 41:03.320
I can't make it look like myself

41:03.560 --> 41:05.560
Like what the fuck is this?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Okay, that looks a little bit more normal

41:09.800 --> 41:11.960

41:11.960 --> 41:14.840
How is she be streamed? Oh, I watched her. Um

That's fine. That's that is as good as it's gonna get

41:36.360 --> 41:37.800

I thought there was a blood stain below me and I was quite confused

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.680
Oh my god, why is it showing my

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.960
It's showing my keyboard uh things instead of

Nope, it's it still wants to do that. Okay. Well, we'll figure it out. That's not it. That's not it

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.760

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.760
Figured it out

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.760

I wish I could wait

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.920

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Oh yippie

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.120
What I missed when I was playing lies of pee is that I can fucking jump

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.720
Couldn't jump before you can't jump in lies of pee. It's a fucking travesty

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.720
Am I supposed I'm not gonna read these I don't really care right now

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:17.480

Um

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.960
Kind of wish there was a blood stain there because I remember the first time I played I walked off

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.280
Uh, I feel so good to be playing this game again. I'm not gonna lie to you

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.520
How do I run? There you go again. I have to remember how to fucking play

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:54.280

02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:38.460

You're looking at boomi like help me, but he can't do anything. He has a half-hands or valued so he should let me help you

02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:48.220

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.340
to get to my lap

02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.140
And um

02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:09.500
She'll pull herself up and then she'll dig her claws into my cushiony chair

02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:13.340
And there's also like so she's stuck on it

02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:22.860
And she's trying to maneuver around right now and get out and I'm trying to help her but she's whining about it

02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:28.220
Okay, are you ready? This is a team effort

02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:34.140
You don't move your paw

02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:37.980
You did it. Yay. Good job Fia

02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:40.700

02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:47.900
My little girl. That's my little girl getting stuck on stone. Yeah

02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:00.220
Fia's gonna keep meowing if you don't feed her

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:03.740
She's fine

02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:06.140
Her food already went off today

02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:12.140
Yeah, went off three hours ago. She just ate and then it'll go off in another couple hours

02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:17.820
They are so spoiled they have an automatic feeder and they have a problem

02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:22.140
And they have so many toys and so many cat trees

02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:28.540
People come in my mom came over and she's like, yeah, this definitely looks like cats live here

02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:35.660
I'm like it's a little cat haven if I could I'd build them that thing where you kind of like

02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:39.340
Have them

02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:40.540
um

02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:44.060
Walk across your walls and stuff like little shelves

02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:53.260
I check it on me since she knew I was sick

02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:59.660
It's the treats they get lots of treats

02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.500
Hmm

02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:19.260
Let me just focus on oh fuck

02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:27.820
Let me focus on just talking to Ronnie first before I try to go kill people for for rooms

02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.460
Wait

02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:42.540

02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:52.540
So used to play as a pee where you have to go to the

02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:55.740
site in order to transfer

02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:01.900
Yeah, what's up with your little hot doll body

02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:07.820
Mother I mean mother. I mean mother. I am sorry

02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:10.780
I don't

02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:20.780
I like how she sounds Jamaican

02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:27.500
She's like a British Jamaican accent

02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:35.500
I heard about the tarnished that

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:45.740
She sounds like I don't know why but Ronnie reminds me of

02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:55.500
Uh, Calypso from uh Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't know why she's Welsh. Oh

02:11:57.260 --> 02:11:59.260
Oh

02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:02.060
I

02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:07.180
No way

02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:14.300
Okay, the spirits will obey thine command but whatever you say, honey, um

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:22.300
Let me just

02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:24.300
I

02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:31.820
That's cool. I'm just gonna try to I can't pick up your skirt. Do you have how many legs you got under there?

02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:35.580
You got oh, that's me

02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:42.460
Oh, wait, hold on. Hold on somebody put a thing in you. So that's kind of annoying and it wasn't my thing

02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:50.860
Don't worry about it. Hold on. I like your shoes. They're very they're a choice. Their hat's quite cute. Um

02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:54.700

Actually, we will you'll become my wife

02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:11.980
Do you ever use your hands to hold up your boobs as a bra? Oh, bye

02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:18.700
I'm staring at her hands. Fuck fucked it up. Fucked it up. Stupid stupid stupid

02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:20.940
Oh

02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:23.980
That's a vision of Trump

02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:29.900
I think they had the same idea as me trying to look up her skirt. All right

02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:34.860
Here's the plan

02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:38.060
I don't have one

02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:46.620
Uh first priority

02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:55.020
I don't feel like going all the way over there. Just yeah, maybe

02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.980
I'm not really worried about going over here because

02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:06.860
Unless I need something from there. I'm not gonna go over there the weeping peninsula. Um

02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:10.860
I believe the other map is over here

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:17.740
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know

02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:22.700
And I could yeah, and then I gotta go up

02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:30.300
And then yes, I do need to don't I need to kill him to well, I could go the cheatzy doodle way

02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:34.700
To get to

02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:36.700
What's it called?

02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:41.180
I don't have to fight him to go through there and I would honestly rather not

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:44.700
I'd rather take the road around

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.260
The hills

02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:49.260
To do that, but I forget how to do that

02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:53.740
I like that. I remember like important things and then I just don't remember how to enact them

02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:00.060
Under psychic yeah, I need to do that

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:03.260
Uh

02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:09.100
No, I'm not I'm not summoning anybody summoning anyone right yet just yet. Um

02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:12.860
We ride and period wife gone

02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:21.020
Yeah, weeping is good for far. I did farm a lot in the weeping peninsula. I recall

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:24.300
Um

02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:32.940
Sorry, it's moving my obs window so I can see it better

02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:43.340
Okay, uh, I believe there's a map fuck. Why does it keep doing that?

02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.940
There's a map

02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:48.940
Somewhere in this direction

02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:55.500
So I will go over there. We ride at dawn except it's nighttime

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:06.780
I love running simulator

02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:10.060
It's my favorite

02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:17.180
Riding horse riding simulator after a big jar lad quest you can't forget. Oh, fuck you're right. I gotta do a lot of shit. Ah

02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.300
There's important quests I need to do

02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:26.460
Because I need to get the wonder psychic it's physics physics psychic. I forget where that is

02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:34.940
We ride at night, um

02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:36.860
Um

02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:41.980
Yeah, I need to talk to blive. I need to talk to in my home boy blive at some point

02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:45.740
Um

02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:51.900
Damn, there's so much to fucking do in this game. Why am I oh my I have bonus runes right now

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:54.780
Um

02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:57.660
Gotta do a lot of stuff

02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:02.860
A lot of stuff. Let me just focus on maps. I think maps

02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:07.660
Yeah, the maps right over here. That's what it is. Let me do that. Fuck you

02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:11.980
I wish we needed to lead it. It would just switch to that

02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:14.540
To one instead of two

02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:17.740
All right, let's fucking do it focusing on the maps and then we'll know our way around

02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:23.660
Honestly, when I labeled it when I get all the maps, I'll be able to know where the fuck I'm going and have a bigger better plan

02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:30.780
Let me not jump off cliffs

02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:39.660
Um, I'm debating whether or not to just speedrun

02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:46.380
Because again, I've played the game before I've beaten the game before

02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:50.220
I'm I am very tempted just to focus on a build

02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:55.100
And worry about defeating uh, radon and moog

02:17:57.020 --> 02:17:59.020
Damn why the maps are fucking far? Oh

02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:05.500
Shit, oh, oh shit. I have to go over the bridge. Let's see night rider

02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:17.900
I could have teleported but you know, I prefer the scenic rope, you know scenic ropes nice. Oh fuck me bro. No

02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:21.260
Get away. Get away. Get away

02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:27.420
I'm not really a speedrunner to be honest with you. I don't I don't speedrun anything

02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:36.220
Get off my butt. Oh shit. I got it. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh, we're fine

02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:46.780
I'm kind of wishing that I played a little bit before like on my ps5 before I started over here just so I can

02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:49.340
Have more of my bearings

02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:53.500

Everybody's came for it. Yes

No, I didn't just explain anything that I want to do in all my plans. I've never played this. What is elden ring?

02:19:30.060 --> 02:19:32.060
I'm so new to this

02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:35.020
This is when you become a muppet. I've always been a muppet. I don't know what you're talking about

02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:52.860
I can't I recall I believe I skipped mogue in my playthrough initially

02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:57.260

Especially because I have a window behind it. So it's like kind of fucking me up. Okay

02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:26.540
Perfect, perfect

02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:31.100
I just want the maps. That's all I care about is the maps

02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:45.820
I might go up into cali if I feel like it

02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:48.140
And

02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:54.300

You have to find your resources ASMR. She be featuring fear right at him for me

02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:24.540
It'd be fear getting stuck on something boomy chewing on a box and then rena screaming

02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:26.700
or purring

02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:28.700

02:23:55.420 --> 02:24:03.260
By the spider you become a chrysalid. Oh, you're high. When you think it's quite the lock when you think about it

02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:06.300

Is it I have never experienced it. Have you I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just oh you want to be grafted

02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:23.020
But a craven

02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.420
I'm so sorry

02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:28.060
Thank you for the jellyfish

02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:32.300
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to like attack you

02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:38.380
How do you know that it'll be glad if you're I got grafted

02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:45.260
Yeah, I'll kill you

02:24:47.740 --> 02:24:49.740
What the fuck are you

02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:52.620
On this

02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:56.140
What are you talking about

02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:01.660
Oh, okay

02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:12.220
Honestly, some of the shit the dialogue in this game is so fucking dark

02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:16.620
Yeah, I can do that for you

02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:22.940
Oh

02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:30.940
Me met it where she's like, oh, I get you tiny pellet golf out my face

02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:34.940
The jellyfish carried you in your first playthrough. That's adorable

02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:40.780
I was thinking about when she tried to smack her oh awkward

02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:48.540
I think I know it's kind of I saw that uh, they're considering doing a

02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:53.900
Uh unofficial anime adaptation of this and weirdly enough

02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.620
Weirdly enough

02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:02.540
I would prefer a live action adaptation

02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:06.620
I don't know why

02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:09.580
It would be a lot

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:12.540
Of CGI

02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:17.580
And it would definitely probably be easy, but I don't know what I would prefer a live action

02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:19.740
I don't know if it's just me

02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.380
I think

02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:26.540
I don't know. Maybe I'm just hankering for a new fantasy thing to watch

02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:29.900
Uh, where am I going?

02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:33.980
All right, I'm going to the cruel

02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:37.420
Torrent to me

02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:44.380
Guys, I think I'm gonna order pizza. What do you think?

02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:48.620
It's because you guys gave me the pizza stuff

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:56.140
Oh, yeah, there's all the fucking bloody fingers. I got a fucking fight. Jesus Christ, bro

02:26:56.860 --> 02:26:58.860
I've got so much shit to do

02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:01.980
I don't have a time. Oh fuck off you bat

02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:03.980
I

02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:16.300
Feel like she's the one who tells me where to go because you go along the edge to get to

02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:22.940
Hey

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.100
Hey

02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:33.420
You want my fingies, let me get your toes then I like how you're gripping the side of this table

02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:38.380
I'm gonna just take a cheese pizza

02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:43.580
Yeah, definitely a series wouldn't want it to be a movie

02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:52.300
Your fingers give me your fingers. I want to last my maidenhood with your two fingers

02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:54.940
Even tight

02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:57.500
And reunites the half

02:27:57.500 --> 02:27:58.780
presents

02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:00.780
at the grand lift

02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:03.820
Pete's funds cleared pizza funds cleared ladies and gentlemen

02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:14.860
That's crazy, um

02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:17.500
Damn, that's crazy. Anyways

02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:20.460
I'm

02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:23.500
Somebody put something oh, they just put something there

02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:30.300
Hey

02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:35.820
Oh, you fucking died. Why did you die? Oh

02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:40.700
They jumped off that side. Oh, it's funny

02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:42.700
I

02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:48.460
Rump ahead

02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:51.260
Oh hitting path

02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:56.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you get a hitting path and all that I'm gonna fall off or something because I can't see properly

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.700
It's this isn't it

02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:12.380
Because I can totally circumvent

02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:22.140
How do I do it though? There's a way to get along the edge and I thought it was

02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.100
No

02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:41.980
I was turning around. Okay, well

02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:49.180
Let's go get our shit. Well, that's not the way

02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:57.840
At least I wasn't far. Oh, yes gravity the final boss

02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:00.480
I

02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:07.680
Have to remember

02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:14.240
Fuck not how to fuck. Um, I have to remember. Is it up around here?

02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:17.520
That's why I fucking know it

02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:21.600
Right, oh don't about it

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.960
Oh don't about it. Oh don't about it. I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking

Let's not go that way. Let's not let's not do it that way. Let me go get my rune since

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:47.120
I usually normally wouldn't give a shit and I'll just leave them but because I'm such a low level every rune counts

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:54.160
Gravity zone defeated. I'm gonna be like this one guy and just totally running a circle off

02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:00.080
Oh

02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:06.400
Wait, I kind of should kill you. Oh, I'm kind of

02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:12.580

Dismount dismount. Yeah, no fucking shit, dude

02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:41.440
And do we do we wait you can't get back up from here

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:52.960
If you can't get back up from here that might mean something what did you do?

02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:56.160
I didn't mean to pick that up, but it's fine

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:08.480
Did you fall off? Oh right there. That's where you fell off

02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:14.880

Beware wolves. Okay, hold on. Let me let me do something. Let me do something real quick

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:48.400

02:32:53.360 --> 02:33:06.400
Yes, I played the game before I am doing a faith intel build

02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:08.400

02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:38.800
How about that?

02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:41.840

Back to you just be gone. It's not even back seating

It's just people like being like hey like they're trying to like warn me or like tell me like like hint at something

02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:59.840
Which is like what you should do if you're going to do anything

The fastest and easiest way to go through things but then again

02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:06.640
Like people have said like you what are you starting over?

02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.080
Like I literally essentially almost have to play through the entire game again

02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:14.800
Like I don't but I do, you know, I don't know if that makes any fucking sense

02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:19.520
I do but I don't

02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:23.920
All right, torrent. Let's try our platforming skills. Where's the

02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:27.440
Where's the little thingies?

02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:30.320
Other right here, okay

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
To me

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Um

02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:44.240
What the sigma how do I there has to be one closer up isn't there

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:49.600
These are too far down because I know yeah, I can already tell people tried to fucking

02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:54.960
Wait what I didn't really see what happened to him

02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:01.520
Oh, then you just jumped off. Okay, so you did make that

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.880
Okay, that makes sense. All right. Um

02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:12.560
Hmm

02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:15.920
Try to think of the path I want to go because I could just be like who

02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:20.160
But then I need to go into the center of the fucking lake

02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.800
So yeah, I should keep going down

02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:30.000
We're going down down in an early around fuck. I can't platform for shit and torrent is really hard to control

02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:36.960
Oh

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:41.760
We did it. Yeah, I see mo we did it

02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.200
Fuck

02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:48.320
Fuck me, I mean

02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:56.160
Uh, I forgot is there another grace over here there is there definitely is I know there's another grace over here

02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:58.160
I just can't remember where it is

02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:00.880
I

02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:07.760
Excuse me. Have you guys seen a grace? Is there a grace around here? Oh fuck. Is there a great? I'm on fire

02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:10.320
I'm on fire. Uh, is there a grace?

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:13.040
Excuse me

02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:16.640
Have you have you happened to see a grace mr. Troll?

02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:20.320
Mr. Troll, have you seen a grace?

02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.360
I I like to talk to you be our lord and save you jesus christ

02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:31.600
Are you guarding something I can't remember

02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:34.960
Uh, hold on hold on

02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:40.560
Hold on hold on

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:47.600
To me torrent to me

02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:49.600
I

02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:58.320
My nose itches

02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:07.920
I don't think brother wants to talk

02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:12.080
What the fuck is that

02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.480
Somebody's car. I was like what the hell what was the game? I'm like, I don't remember this part of the soundtrack

02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:22.800
Our call he had a chance to make a new school source. He was not gonna give him the chance

02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:25.200
He had the chance

02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.200
Was not giving the chance

02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.480
Hold on let me let me get my bearings real quick

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:40.000
Maybe I should start using that mimic grace. Oh wait, there's a grace right there

02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:43.440
I'm like where's the grace

02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:45.840
The grace sparkles

02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:48.720
I got a two

02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:51.280
Let me see if I can muffle the two

02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:57.120
Ha ha you could not hear it. No, I didn't have to mute

02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:04.640
How the fuck did you get over here so fast?

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:10.880
Testing my limits, huh?

02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:15.680
I can handle anything

02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:18.480
Look, I'm what I'm I have the medal. It's on my head

02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:26.000
Yeah, it seems my worries were unfounded. You are not even a real maiden. So I don't even know where this came from

02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:28.880
Whereas I merely pretend

02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:33.360
There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance and what's that?

02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:37.760
I can take you to the round table. Is that true gathering place

02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:40.560
of tarnished champions

02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:43.920
Guided by grace. That's crazy

02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:51.280
Let's go. Let my hand rest upon you for buttermilk resting in glasses. I'm wearing glasses

02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:01.520
Time to go to Walmart

02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:09.280
Wow

02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:11.280
Wowie Zowie

02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:13.040
Hey

02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:15.200
Wow, I really don't need to be here right now

02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:18.400

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:21.040

02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:30.480
Well, just call me Dia Los. Dia Los. Hello Dia Los. I remember

02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:33.600
I was doing your

02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:40.000
Little quest off to the side and I really liked it and it was really sad. Take your eyes off for for but a moment

02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:42.720
Yep, like me. Bye

02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:46.080
Um, I could fight this dude

02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:54.720
I'll I don't feel like doing all the shit over again. I wish I could import my save from my playstation. That would literally be

02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:57.520
amazing

02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:00.960
Oh, hey, it's you. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to jump. I was jumping for joy

02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:04.640
Glad to see that you're why are you taller than me?

02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:09.040
I should have told you sooner. It's okay, Roderica

02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:11.680
I like your name Roderica

02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:15.120
Why do I look so fucked up?

02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:25.200
Uh, we all know how it's gonna end I become the elderboard the lordess if you will

02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:38.400
Yeah, well your purpose is to level up my spirit ashes. I'll spoil that for you. Uh, hello

02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:42.960
It's block shot. Okay. I'm just I'm just gonna see what I can open before I do anything

02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:53.840
Oh, yeah, it's you who just stares at me

02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:59.200
I always loved his fucking armor. I remember I I got it at some point

02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:02.800
I don't even know who the fuck this guy is like. I don't know anything about him

02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:05.280
I don't I don't think I followed anything that he does

02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:08.160
His door was block shot

02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:21.600
I think I remember the last thing I would play it was playing was the dung eater. I was doing the dung eater quest

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.400
Uh, I don't know I'm here yet

02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:31.120
All right, let's let's let's uh

02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:33.120
Uh

02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:35.440
I do need some runes

02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:45.680
I just wanna

02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:49.120
I just think of that picture of that one meme of all the guys pointing their swords at the table

02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:51.120
I just think of that every time I'm here

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:53.200
Um

02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:55.600
I how much runes do I have?

02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:05.040
I have 400. Um, let me say

02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:10.800
Yeah, everyone should use it

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:18.240
It's still not enough, uh, did I have any more?

02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:30.240
Is that enough to level up I think not

02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:35.120
Okay, no it is enough. Um

02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:43.920
I like I just broke the chair. I could have sat in oh it came back. It's fine

02:47:43.920 --> 02:48:04.400
All right, um, again, I am really just going to work on raising my vigor right now, so I'm gonna do that

02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:06.400
Uh

02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:12.160
And you know, I bet you guys are hankering for a fight

02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.040
I'm up at sheepy is my kind of room

02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:17.520
Uh

02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:21.520
Oh man, imagine if I could sit in a chair. I'd be kind of cool for a hub role thing

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.560
Sometimes when I go to hug fia and I get a degree a concert thigh and the bouncer's pull me off

02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:31.840
It's stop the runes out of me. God damn bro. I always get turned around in here though

02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:36.400
I

02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:38.720
What are you buying?

02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:40.800
What are you selling?

02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:43.200
That's me

02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:46.400
Lay out your arms

02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:51.520
I don't really want to do that because I'd rather find a sword

02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.520
Open the door I can't open it yet

02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:02.960
Where's fia

02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:11.200
Uh, pretty sure these doors are all shut still. Yeah, because I have to beat the guy

02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:17.600
Yeah, okay, let's do a little fighty fight

02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:21.840
Let's fight this bloody finger

02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:28.800
Because I've been I've been skipping through stuff because I want to get out a good spot

02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:32.640
But I'm like, you know what you guys deserve it. You deserve a good fight, you know

02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:38.960
But he's locked in me taking him literally and putting my actual arms under the hammer

02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:44.320
Superhero landing, let's go

02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:57.600

Hmm

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:19.040
I'm gonna go unlock the weeping peninsula just because I'm like I'm a completionist in this way in terms of like

02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:21.040

I heard

02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:33.680
That was a peninsula that wipes around here. I forget what I did last time, but I somehow managed to end up on the other side of this

02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:40.480
Before like unlocking it and shit, and I don't know how I managed that

02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:47.920
Because there is a there's another way to get on the weeping peninsula. I just couldn't recall. Hey, uh, something about your dad

Question to raise here. How does gal even write in her note? That's a great question

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:27.840
Maybe she had some braille

03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:33.440
Secreted from the parents. She basically was gonna do blind gal's quest. No, I'm not I'm probably not gonna do her quest

Um, so we're gonna teleport over here and we're gonna follow this road all the way down

03:02:54.320 --> 03:02:56.320
We're gonna go around this fucking shit

And then we're gonna go and then we're gonna go over here and we're gonna talk to this lady probably

03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:03.040

The first like the first few playthroughs of this might be a little bit grindies. I try to get my level up

03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:50.800
What's up big

03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:55.600

Or just watch somebody start it. They just fight the fucking tree sentinel for five hours

03:05:21.760 --> 03:05:23.760

It's a ride of passage

03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:52.640

03:06:36.960 --> 03:06:38.960
Bro, I need to look up some

03:06:50.960 --> 03:06:52.960
Where was it?

03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:56.240
There's a little

03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:01.200
Little grotto. I believe it's on this side. Yes

03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:04.240
Jump through this

03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:08.560
And then we can go in here. Yep. Yep. Yep

03:07:08.880 --> 03:07:10.880
And

03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:18.640
Find a cheeky little pole. Oh wait. No, this portal goes somewhere else, doesn't it?

03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:23.280

Anyways, um, honestly, these are some of my favorite minibosses are the little gargoyle guys

03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:55.280
Another thing I skipped in the game when I beat it is I never actually went to um

I don't even remember what it's called

03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:03.840
Aramizula

03:08:04.400 --> 03:08:15.200
Not those little fuckers. All right. Oh wait. No, I need to get the chicken feet before I do this. Let's find a grace first

03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:32.800
There's a grace nearby there's a grace nearby over the bridge after the dragon

03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:38.720
I think oh, it's right here. Perfect actually

03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:45.200

03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:55.520
I could remember if there was a chest in that little area or if there was

03:08:56.160 --> 03:08:59.200
That takes you to the cilia crystal caves or if it took you

03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:06.640
To where the grand lift is but not on the right part of it. I mean the capital

I took a shower today. I smell delicious

03:29:57.200 --> 03:29:58.720
Papa John's

03:29:58.720 --> 03:30:00.720
There is a Papa John's in me. I think

03:30:02.160 --> 03:30:04.160
I

03:30:04.560 --> 03:30:05.920
Pizzeria

03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:07.440
The hut I've

03:30:07.440 --> 03:30:13.760
There was like one pizza hut in my area and it went out of business. So just like never showed up. I have they don't really have

03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:17.920
Papa geno's. I think there's a Papa geno's my local place

03:30:20.160 --> 03:30:23.040
Local places are it's pretty good. They're all right

03:30:24.160 --> 03:30:26.160
Trying to think of like the best local place

03:30:27.120 --> 03:30:29.120
I

03:30:30.880 --> 03:30:32.880
Like a sweet sauce

03:30:34.080 --> 03:30:35.520
Can't recall

03:30:35.520 --> 03:30:37.520
which out of

03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:41.440
the three Papa geno's Papa John's and

03:30:42.400 --> 03:30:45.520
Papa Domino's has sweet sauce ever get

03:30:51.600 --> 03:30:53.840
I'm not a huge fan of deep dish

03:30:54.400 --> 03:30:58.240
I think it's too saucy. It's too much. It's too thick

03:31:00.480 --> 03:31:03.840
You think Papa John's has a sweet sauce or Domino's? I don't know. I can't remember

03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:10.640
So like I don't know. Have you guys ever had like beach pizza?

03:31:14.000 --> 03:31:17.120
Is that or is that just an east coast thing?

03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:20.960
Beach pizza

03:31:20.960 --> 03:31:21.920
No

03:31:21.920 --> 03:31:23.920
Oh, um, I don't

03:31:24.880 --> 03:31:26.880
Really know how to explain it

03:31:28.160 --> 03:31:31.440
So beach pizza. It's really tasty. It's sound it's um

03:31:33.600 --> 03:31:40.160
It's really it's square cut pizza with really nice sweet sauce and

03:31:41.440 --> 03:31:43.440
um

03:31:43.600 --> 03:31:49.120
They have they just throw like a slice of provolone on it. It's just so good and we call it beach pizza

03:31:49.680 --> 03:31:52.400
Because usually you can get it on at the beach

03:31:55.840 --> 03:31:59.040
It's not there's not like the actual like that's not the like the company that makes it

03:31:59.040 --> 03:32:01.360
It's just call it just colloquially

03:32:02.080 --> 03:32:06.000
Call beach pizza and you can get like ham and shit and like extra provolone

03:32:08.160 --> 03:32:10.160
It's pretty good

03:32:10.960 --> 03:32:11.760
It's really tasty

03:32:11.760 --> 03:32:16.960
It's like the sharpness of the little bit of sharpness from the provolone and then like the sweeter sauce is really tasty

03:32:17.920 --> 03:32:22.240
You have marcos? No. It must be an American thing. I think it is

03:32:24.720 --> 03:32:26.720
I'm gonna like

03:32:27.360 --> 03:32:29.360
Cause I feel like

03:32:29.680 --> 03:32:32.960
I'm gonna look off the name of the place I should get it from

03:32:33.280 --> 03:32:36.320
But I'm checking to see if it's family owned

03:32:37.680 --> 03:32:39.680
Or if it's everywhere

03:32:43.520 --> 03:32:45.520
Oh, yeah

03:32:47.120 --> 03:32:49.120
Um

03:33:06.960 --> 03:33:08.960
Okay, that's

03:33:17.920 --> 03:33:24.080
That would be such a pain to like it would be so expensive for just a few slices

03:33:37.440 --> 03:33:40.960
But it's not it's not that it's not it's different than that

03:33:47.520 --> 03:33:54.000
It's similar but it's not it's like

03:33:56.800 --> 03:33:59.840
But I'm gonna stop describing it because I feel like it will

03:34:00.640 --> 03:34:03.440
You'll be able to find where I am. Um, okay

03:34:09.360 --> 03:34:12.880
Enter ever jail I always wanted I used to call it ever goal

03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:19.920
And whatever it is it looks great

03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:26.640
Um, let me go on swords ash and let me get some pizza

03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:39.520
Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Oh fuck. I might have accidentally just marked it something is bad

03:34:44.640 --> 03:34:46.640
No, I didn't mean to do that

03:34:47.680 --> 03:34:49.680
Oh

03:34:53.440 --> 03:35:00.400
Accidentally was like rate your last food and I was like accidentally put three stars when I was cleaning three stuff

03:35:07.920 --> 03:35:09.920
I could order some little Caesars

03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:20.960
Oh my god, I can't order Pizza Hut. What the hell

03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:29.360
What the hell there's so much they have so much shit. I think I'm Cinnabon mini rolls. What the fuck

03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:33.760
I am getting diabetes just looking at their menu. Holy shit

03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:40.800
I did not I've never had Pizza Hut before

03:35:42.800 --> 03:35:45.440
I think I'm gonna order Pizza Hut just because I've never had it before

03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:49.680
I

03:35:51.360 --> 03:35:57.520
Didn't find I was pronounced jail after watching British streamer because apparently it's more commonly known there. Yeah, I think I think that's how I found it out too

03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:01.520
Big fan of the hut. Yeah

03:36:04.160 --> 03:36:11.040
It's bottom to your Pete secret coming out of left field screaming it's bottom to your pizza

03:36:11.280 --> 03:36:13.280
Pizza Hut

03:36:16.080 --> 03:36:21.760
What what in hut pizza hut he is always giving me food points. Okay, I never mind

03:36:24.240 --> 03:36:26.640
I don't need food poisoning for the 50th time in my life

03:36:28.640 --> 03:36:30.640
Uh this week

03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:36.240
Like a pizza

03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:48.480
Oh, if I order from here, oh, it's so expensive

03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:58.400
I'm I know I need to eat but I'm actually getting nauseous looking at food right now

03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:02.800
I think I might just have soup

03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:07.440
Oh, no, but those soup plays they ordered from those really good as closed

03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:10.320
I

03:37:10.720 --> 03:37:12.720
Guess I'll starve

03:37:19.520 --> 03:37:22.160
Actually like the crust on dominoes sandwich

03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:25.600
sandwich

03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:29.440
Say pizza for the collab with Toma making a pizza party. That's cute. Actually

03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:34.960
I think I'll just make my soup self some soup later because I have some chicken noodle soup like some Campbell's

03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:37.040
I think that'll be good for me

03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:40.160
When I have some um oyster crackers left over from

03:37:41.680 --> 03:37:44.880
The last place I ordered from yes

03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:52.720
Toma knows how sandwiches dominoes is really greasy. I usually have to pack the pizza

03:37:54.320 --> 03:37:56.320
All right, I'm ready

03:37:56.880 --> 03:37:58.880
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm so ready

03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:09.680
I

03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:13.520
I'm already dead

03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:17.280
Guys, I think I lost guys. I think I need to be a little bit stronger

03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:21.360
Guys

03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:29.040
Just a warm-up just a warm-up

03:38:30.880 --> 03:38:35.840
Just take an IV trip for a new nutrition. Why is it make me go all the way over here?

03:38:37.440 --> 03:38:39.440
I

03:38:41.120 --> 03:38:43.200
Like bonking them and then they explode

03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:52.080
Look at it. He's being silly

03:38:55.440 --> 03:38:57.680
Always coming towards me that's awkward anyways

03:39:03.440 --> 03:39:06.400
Are you the one of those summons is cheating kind of players no I usually

03:39:07.440 --> 03:39:09.680
I usually like abuse the fuck out of my mimics here

03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:14.080
Um

03:39:14.080 --> 03:39:19.840
That's really about it. No, I think about it. What the fuck? Oh, he's confused the fuck out of me for a second

03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:23.280
Can you come up please?

03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:33.520
I don't remember his moveset. Oh, yep. That's right

03:39:34.480 --> 03:39:42.720
This will spin you're so fast bro. You're so fast. I I held up. I held this up

03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:52.240
Okay, this isn't gonna work out

03:39:57.520 --> 03:39:59.520
Five guys shield summon

03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:04.480
One hit clap

03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:11.120
Oh

03:40:11.840 --> 03:40:14.080
Yeah, let's just continue to how we were going

03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:19.840
I'll come for that bloodhounds fang later

03:40:22.240 --> 03:40:25.680
I'll just get the warning star first. I need something that it does bleed

03:40:30.480 --> 03:40:32.480
Sack

03:40:32.880 --> 03:40:35.920
Pizza fun. Oh, thank you future pizza fun

03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:40.240
I should just have something added to my throne and just be like pizza fun

03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:43.920
Oh speaking of throne, uh, I was thinking

03:40:45.840 --> 03:40:48.720
Uh, I'm kind of like I don't really need anything else anymore

03:40:49.520 --> 03:40:51.840
So I just add stuff that I need for my house

03:40:52.720 --> 03:40:54.720
um

03:40:55.680 --> 03:40:59.920
And I'm wondering if I should start doing what Amy did and start saving for a 2.0

03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:08.480
Because I kind of just want I kind of want a model that's like more me

03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:12.640
I love this one, especially when I am in my Muppet form

03:41:16.080 --> 03:41:20.480
That's on this side. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me

03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:28.160
All right, now we can go to Kaleid. We have what we need

03:41:50.480 --> 03:41:52.480
Actually it's up here

03:41:53.440 --> 03:41:57.600
This is where I need to go too. I forget how big Kaleid is

03:41:58.400 --> 03:42:01.520
I thought I thought this game was so huge like I thought

03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:06.640
Um, just limb grief and weeping peninsula. We're gonna be the whole tarry game and I was so wrong

03:42:10.240 --> 03:42:12.560
Yeah, I'm already getting a

03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:17.200
tan model with um, that's what I mean if I'm in a couple weeks or so

03:42:17.920 --> 03:42:22.160
So I hope it not good enough. I love the Muppet actually. I would just have a straight-up Muppet model

03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:26.320
So beyond me and Tom are talking. I'm like, I wish there were more cartoony models out there like

03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:29.120
I'm someone I don't like

03:42:29.920 --> 03:42:31.920
Westernized

03:42:32.720 --> 03:42:37.840
Anime style models, but I do like cartoony models. There's a difference. There's a difference in that

03:42:38.320 --> 03:42:40.320
Hello

03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:43.360
Grail

03:42:48.160 --> 03:42:50.160
You say pizza I say

03:42:50.400 --> 03:42:52.400
Filling sandwich supreme

03:42:53.280 --> 03:42:55.280
Thank you. Thank you so much said

03:42:55.440 --> 03:42:57.440
Dastoy

03:42:58.320 --> 03:43:00.320
Sounds like dastardly

03:43:02.400 --> 03:43:04.400
All right, um, I forget where you go after this

03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:07.840
Pretty sure you go past

03:43:08.480 --> 03:43:13.840
Really doing this all by memory. My memory's not good. Oh, you'll pass this tree

03:43:18.160 --> 03:43:20.160
We'll pass the minor or a tree

03:43:21.360 --> 03:43:23.360
With a little funky guy

03:43:24.880 --> 03:43:26.880
Nevermind

03:43:27.040 --> 03:43:29.040
I died

03:43:29.040 --> 03:43:31.040
Oh

03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:47.600
And that's what this would be like a thing that would be later on like this would be like towards like the fall

03:43:49.440 --> 03:43:51.440
Probably actually

03:43:52.160 --> 03:43:55.200
Maybe for my birthday because my birthday's in um

03:43:55.600 --> 03:44:04.480
In September it's September 28. I probably don't want maybe model before then as a little tree, you know

03:44:07.520 --> 03:44:14.320
Um, then you go around do you go up if you go up again? I'm doing this all my fucking memory

03:44:15.760 --> 03:44:17.760
There you go

03:44:19.440 --> 03:44:22.000
Oh, what the hell how are you hitting me? No

03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:28.160
Don't pass these dudes

03:44:36.480 --> 03:44:40.880
Yes, here we are. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Hi

03:44:41.840 --> 03:44:46.080
Hello, sweetie. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna put you out of your misery. Okay

03:44:48.160 --> 03:44:50.160
All right

03:44:50.160 --> 03:44:56.240
Oh, I forgot you summon other dragons

03:45:20.320 --> 03:45:23.840
I'm gonna come right over here

03:45:30.400 --> 03:45:32.400
Here dragons

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:37.040
I forget the story with this one

03:45:39.280 --> 03:45:43.920
Anyways, top grade in here. I'm gonna kill you for doing that

03:45:50.160 --> 03:45:52.160
Okay

03:46:07.600 --> 03:46:14.800
2.0 actually not even like a one point. Well actually honestly my toggle update be like a 1.5

03:46:20.880 --> 03:46:24.160
I am hidden in your wing. Nobody can find me

03:46:24.640 --> 03:46:30.800
But I'm maybe even later. I don't even know because again, I know stronti put a lot of money into this model. So I don't want to like

03:46:33.360 --> 03:46:37.200
Take it for granted or seem like I am because I like this model like I like

03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:41.520
I'm not the model. That's a muppet. Um

03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:45.440
I don't know just something more me

03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:52.160
Oh

03:47:10.800 --> 03:47:17.440
I can wield this with both hands. How do I double how do I double hand wield something I totally forget

03:47:20.560 --> 03:47:22.560
I totally forget how to do that

03:47:29.760 --> 03:47:31.760
Oh

03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:36.800
What

03:47:38.880 --> 03:47:42.720
Oh, yeah, okay. No, why is it doing this?

03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:44.720
Oh

03:47:51.680 --> 03:47:53.680
Can I put this on my

03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:02.560
I don't I don't want to use this

03:48:12.720 --> 03:48:14.720
There we go

03:48:18.960 --> 03:48:20.960
Stop yelling I'm trying to kill you

03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:24.800
It's my take a while

03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:36.320
Where's the best spot I mean, this is a good spot. This is not a good spot. Um, hold on

03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:39.920
Hold on. I'm thinking

03:48:42.720 --> 03:48:44.720
You're like in the ground in the ground

03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:49.120
I don't see what this guy says

03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:52.160
Why does it always talk

03:48:54.000 --> 03:48:56.000
You really attack her it's a girl

03:49:00.640 --> 03:49:07.040
You're gonna you're gonna you want my muppet body you're gonna you're gonna do stuff to this muppet you're gonna leave me nice and crusty

03:49:08.480 --> 03:49:10.480
Like your song

03:49:13.440 --> 03:49:15.440
Oh

03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:17.760
I don't want to attack by the tail

03:49:22.800 --> 03:49:25.440
It's because I feel like all this magically aggro something somehow

03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:34.800
Oh, what's the matter? What do you mean?

03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:42.400
I feel like in lower wind tarnish is doing this the tarnish is burning their way into the dragon's body

03:49:42.400 --> 03:49:44.400
Oh

03:49:44.640 --> 03:49:48.560
I need to look up what her deal is though because I know there's like another thing you can do with this dragon

03:49:49.760 --> 03:49:51.760
She's just here just for farming

03:49:51.760 --> 03:49:53.760
Oh

03:50:09.760 --> 03:50:12.400
Oh, she's grail the braille

03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:20.080
Well, thankfully, um, are you talking in leech?

03:50:20.720 --> 03:50:22.720
By the way, are you

03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:29.600
Uh, secondly, uh, that's why you want to get a bleed because the bleed as you just saw

03:50:30.320 --> 03:50:33.680
Uh, it does a little bit extra damage because you have that blood loss

03:50:35.120 --> 03:50:36.480
buff

03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:41.440
That's why a lot of people love doing the uchi katana or uchi ga

03:50:41.680 --> 03:50:48.080
I can't pronounce it. Uh, what the name is and the rivers of blood because they're really good for bleed builds, but

03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:51.040
I don't feel like doing reverse blood

03:50:52.080 --> 03:50:57.360
I do love a good blood build though. Like I did do blood faith arcane. That was nice

03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:07.440
The way it's supposed to go is you kill the tiny dragons and it kills the big one

03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:10.240
Oh

03:51:11.440 --> 03:51:15.600
I'm not going to do the gold feet until I get uh closer because it has a time limit on it

03:51:15.600 --> 03:51:17.600
I

03:51:17.840 --> 03:51:22.480
Guys remember taps the sign I have played the game before

03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:32.000
You like frost frost is I never actually I never did anything with frost

03:51:35.200 --> 03:51:39.700
Maybe they'll be the magic that I work I I do for intelligence

03:51:46.560 --> 03:51:48.560
Shut up stop yelling

03:51:50.800 --> 03:51:57.200
She's the mother of dragons why she liked this where's Daenerys? Oh, she put her arm up

03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:07.300
Wait, no, I don't want to do that. I feel like she'll cross me. That's really cool though. I've never I've actually never seen her move this much

03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:18.500
Sorry, I have to hit you in the fucking leg

03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:30.980
There we go now we pop this bad boy

03:52:30.980 --> 03:52:32.980
Okay

03:52:44.740 --> 03:52:50.020
She currently goes too large so she could no longer either fly her babies bring her food. That's so sad

03:53:01.380 --> 03:53:03.380
I

03:53:07.540 --> 03:53:10.040
Hurry up, let them run out

03:53:10.040 --> 03:53:12.040
Oh

03:53:30.520 --> 03:53:32.520
Okay, we're so close

03:53:40.520 --> 03:53:46.120
Forever bopping this lady only she would die. Hello. Where is it?

03:53:59.560 --> 03:54:01.560
Fuck hurry up

03:54:01.960 --> 03:54:03.960
Oh

03:54:09.400 --> 03:54:11.400
Okay, bye

03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:19.000
Any group, whoa, wow cool

03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:21.000
I

03:54:35.160 --> 03:54:37.160
Was a battle it's my first kill

03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:39.640
I can whack you

03:54:47.800 --> 03:54:53.000
Sick now I have a lot of fucking runes. Let's go. Um, so now

03:54:54.360 --> 03:54:57.880
Yippie, I don't want you to shit. Uh, let's go

03:54:58.120 --> 03:55:00.120
Yeah

03:55:02.920 --> 03:55:07.400
Because now the fun starts, you know now the fun really fucking starts

03:55:10.600 --> 03:55:13.560
Okay, I I need a plan

03:55:15.400 --> 03:55:21.900
I need to plan and you think of what do I want for my build? So we're gonna sit here

03:55:27.880 --> 03:55:33.320
Now time to kill I'm trying but

03:55:41.160 --> 03:55:47.800
I'm thinking because we got like a hundred k runes we could you know farm

03:55:50.120 --> 03:55:52.120
No, I need to get the mimics here next

03:55:53.560 --> 03:55:55.560
I need to get the mimics here

03:55:56.200 --> 03:56:03.640
Uh, because that's the only ash that I really care about I didn't really use anything. Um, let me

03:56:06.280 --> 03:56:08.280
I'm gonna look up some weapons

03:56:09.560 --> 03:56:11.560
Yes

03:56:13.320 --> 03:56:16.600
Faith intelligence builds

03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:27.560
You

03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:50.920
Could get the sword of night in flame

03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:55.960
Isn't that oh where's the sword of night in flame I totally forget

03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:05.800
There's not actually it's it's really there's not a lot of fucking options for scaling with faith intelligence

03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:13.800
So I might do like something else there's not a lot of

03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:18.840
You can't really there's not a lot of weapons for a faith intelligence build

03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:22.920
So

03:57:43.480 --> 03:57:45.480
Yeah, I know I got it look like we're done

03:57:50.920 --> 03:57:52.920
Okay

03:58:00.280 --> 03:58:03.640
Again, I'm speed running I'm going there you want me to go I don't want to go full caster

03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:06.920
I don't want to go full caster

03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:10.520
I want to do more casting because I never

03:58:11.320 --> 03:58:16.040
Like I'm I'm someone who I always just do like hack and slash the entire time like again

03:58:16.040 --> 03:58:20.920
I told you I literally rolled with blood uh bloodhounds fang for the longest fucking time

03:58:25.560 --> 03:58:29.880
Yeah, there's good options all around intelligence. Maybe I won't do faith

03:58:40.520 --> 03:58:43.400
Like I'm debating because I now I'm tempted to do because I've done

03:58:43.880 --> 03:58:49.080
A blood build now I'm tempted to do a frost intelligence build because frost seems cool

03:58:49.480 --> 03:58:55.320
Although I remember I have had my put shit shit pushed in from an invader with the rock slingshit

03:58:57.400 --> 03:59:00.920
So many options because I just want to know what I should put all these runes into you know

03:59:00.920 --> 03:59:02.920
No

03:59:10.360 --> 03:59:15.480
Not that I can't go farm runes I can always go farm runes. Hi reyna, welcome back

03:59:19.640 --> 03:59:28.600
Oh reyna just hopped up on my desk and she pressed stuff. Oh reyna sweetheart. I okay. She's like I must snuggle with you mother now

03:59:31.880 --> 03:59:33.880
Lend me a warmth

03:59:34.680 --> 03:59:36.680
Hi reyna

03:59:37.080 --> 03:59:41.400
Hi, I'm sorry. I didn't boop mean to boop you on the snoot. Oh, you want to give me a hug? Oh

03:59:42.440 --> 03:59:46.280
I want to shit on my shoulder. Oh, you want to give me purrs

03:59:50.520 --> 03:59:52.520
I've already done an arcane build

03:59:55.640 --> 03:59:57.640
She wants to cave

03:59:58.440 --> 04:00:00.440
Do

04:00:00.520 --> 04:00:03.480
Furnace crest line since you're not an idiot like me that

04:00:04.040 --> 04:00:07.800
Arches him on site first smack talking you. Yeah, I could do that

04:00:08.520 --> 04:00:10.520
um

04:00:11.800 --> 04:00:17.160
Oh, that sucks. I feel so bad for people who killed him right off the bat for that because that was a good place to farm

04:00:18.280 --> 04:00:20.280
um

04:00:20.360 --> 04:00:22.360
Thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking

04:00:28.360 --> 04:00:35.880
What are some other uh faith in it have really good weapons in dlc true and that is the end game. We're only doing

04:00:36.840 --> 04:00:38.840
this

04:00:42.600 --> 04:00:48.280
Yeah, I don't don't spoil but that's good to know that's that is still really good to know because we this is the ultimate thing is

04:00:49.000 --> 04:00:53.240
We're just trying to get a good build to get into the like as we're going into the dlc

04:00:54.680 --> 04:00:56.680
Because i'm literally leveling a shit out of my stuff

04:00:57.960 --> 04:00:59.960
and then

04:01:01.720 --> 04:01:05.720
We're going to go straight for redawn and mog although I have to kill redawn anyways

04:01:06.840 --> 04:01:08.680
so

04:01:08.680 --> 04:01:10.680
And then we're just going to go straight for mog

04:01:11.640 --> 04:01:13.640
Mog mog

04:01:14.600 --> 04:01:16.600
Hmm

04:01:24.840 --> 04:01:27.960
Mog is very weak to bleed yeah, because now i've tempted i'm like, you know

04:01:28.520 --> 04:01:33.880
Bleed is just like, you know try to true. I do love a good bleed like blood bleed build

04:01:35.640 --> 04:01:38.360
And i'm like do I go to kaolin do I farm for the scythe again?

04:01:39.880 --> 04:01:41.880
Anyway, I just get that

04:01:41.960 --> 04:01:45.800
Oh, because that's what I did in the faith the faith that I just bled, you know

04:01:50.280 --> 04:01:55.400
You're gonna want to level up your flask too. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know I I do have to grab that stuff. I have to grab that stuff

04:01:55.400 --> 04:01:57.240
You're right

04:01:57.240 --> 04:02:03.560
Bleed is the meta I know but I hate that like everybody has a fucking blood build because it's easy, you know

04:02:05.240 --> 04:02:07.880
I'm like, you know, do I do it because it's easy because I need easy

04:02:12.680 --> 04:02:15.880
Comet azure is pretty good. Okay, I got to know

04:02:18.520 --> 04:02:21.880
It's so funny. It's I don't know why but it's very ironic to me that mog is

04:02:22.920 --> 04:02:24.920
weak against blood blood

04:02:25.000 --> 04:02:27.000
So frostbite. Yeah

04:02:27.160 --> 04:02:29.160
Think about that

04:02:29.320 --> 04:02:32.520
Yeah, I was thinking about getting the uchi katana in the dungeon

04:02:37.320 --> 04:02:39.320
And fuse it with cold

04:02:40.040 --> 04:02:42.040
Oh, okay

04:02:43.880 --> 04:02:48.600
Okay, you're on to something uchi katana

04:02:51.960 --> 04:02:53.960
Get some cold

04:02:54.760 --> 04:02:56.760
All right

04:02:57.320 --> 04:02:59.320
In the moonville katana. Yeah

04:02:59.640 --> 04:03:01.640
Yeah

04:03:01.800 --> 04:03:03.480
Uh

04:03:03.480 --> 04:03:05.480
The moonville katana

04:03:06.440 --> 04:03:09.960
Is in kaolin in a dungeon, isn't it?

04:03:14.600 --> 04:03:18.920
I'm just like really happy right now by the way, I just want to let everybody know that I'm happy because I'm just like

04:03:18.920 --> 04:03:21.400
You can have like elvin ring stuff. Okay

04:03:24.280 --> 04:03:27.800
Cool cool, uh, I'll just like search where that is on the map

04:03:29.480 --> 04:03:31.480
I might copy your build so

04:03:32.280 --> 04:03:34.280
Okay

04:03:35.960 --> 04:03:40.520
If you progress ronnie's quest line is also the dark moon greatsword. That's true

04:03:42.760 --> 04:03:44.760
I'm glad you're happy

04:03:48.600 --> 04:03:50.600
I just love this game so much. I just love elvin ring

04:03:52.920 --> 04:03:56.440
This their ability would never do I don't know really

04:03:56.440 --> 04:04:02.200
Do you eat you have the elvin ring?

04:04:03.960 --> 04:04:11.160
I told me after you yeah, uh, yes, I do it's I have it up on my phone. I read that is mega penis

04:04:14.440 --> 04:04:16.440
I don't know why

04:04:20.920 --> 04:04:22.920
The torch only builds

04:04:23.480 --> 04:04:30.520
I'm not on android on iphone because it's easier for tracking for vtube vtubers

04:04:31.320 --> 04:04:36.440
If honestly, I would consider searching to android if they did had some really good ar

04:04:37.560 --> 04:04:38.920
stuff

04:04:38.920 --> 04:04:41.720
Or whatever the light are whatever the fuck they use in iPhones

04:04:44.120 --> 04:04:46.120
What is my least favorite build

04:04:53.160 --> 04:04:55.160
Huh, what is my least favorite

04:05:04.040 --> 04:05:06.520
I saw like the fists like people like

04:05:07.880 --> 04:05:10.280
Are like the fucking pots on your hands

04:05:12.120 --> 04:05:15.400
Bo's actually yeah bo suck dual shield

04:05:18.440 --> 04:05:20.440
I've I've

04:05:20.920 --> 04:05:24.440
I have enjoyed watching someone do a bow build only

04:05:26.440 --> 04:05:29.160
It was fun to watch but not fun

04:05:31.400 --> 04:05:33.400
It would be fun to do

04:05:34.200 --> 04:05:36.200
Boomi are you pissing?

04:05:37.080 --> 04:05:41.160
You just me out and then gone the litter box and piss did you just announce to everyone you're pissing?

04:05:44.120 --> 04:05:49.080
Good job boomi good piss good job you pee like a little girl you squat

04:05:51.400 --> 04:05:55.320
I'm also arts and dlc is super fun. I've heard that

04:05:55.960 --> 04:05:58.760
Bo builds actually have good weapon now as well interesting

04:05:58.840 --> 04:06:03.880
I'm so excited to get to the dlc portion. You guys have no idea, but again, I really want to

04:06:05.720 --> 04:06:07.320
Um

04:06:07.320 --> 04:06:10.680
And I won't lie to you. I'll probably pay play a little bit of this off stream

04:06:12.040 --> 04:06:14.040
Uh just to get

04:06:14.760 --> 04:06:16.760
To a good spot

04:06:17.240 --> 04:06:21.640
Um and grind a little bit so you guys don't have to just see me grinding and just like farming and shit

04:06:23.000 --> 04:06:25.880
Mother please must you announce my bathroom habits to everyone?

04:06:26.040 --> 04:06:28.840
I know he just literally just like zoomied around the room afterwards

04:06:29.720 --> 04:06:33.640
Now he's watching birds outside while he fucking tweaks out in the cat tree

04:06:34.600 --> 04:06:36.600
The hell dude

04:06:36.760 --> 04:06:39.240
Well, there he goes zoom in

04:06:41.000 --> 04:06:42.520
Um

04:06:42.520 --> 04:06:44.520
It's also super hard

04:06:44.840 --> 04:06:51.560
Okay, what is the ideal level for the dlc is my question

04:06:53.400 --> 04:06:55.400
That's what that is what I would like to know

04:06:57.800 --> 04:07:04.360
A little level 170. Okay 150 150 ish. Okay. I can do that

04:07:06.600 --> 04:07:09.000
Good to know good to know. Okay. So yeah, I definitely

04:07:09.160 --> 04:07:15.560
I'll say 60 I'll do I'll do a cool 60 69 even

04:07:16.840 --> 04:07:19.960
So I'll probably again, I might like grind stuff off stream

04:07:21.000 --> 04:07:23.000
um

04:07:23.320 --> 04:07:25.720
Especially because then I could just focus and just lock in and just be like

04:07:27.880 --> 04:07:31.560
Um, but we're gonna play I'm obviously gonna keep playing until I get tired

04:07:32.200 --> 04:07:34.200
Which will probably be like 1 a.m. So

04:07:35.080 --> 04:07:37.080
Help you're locked in bros

04:07:38.040 --> 04:07:40.040
150 minimum good to know good to know

04:07:41.800 --> 04:07:46.120
Uh, you did it at 125 and it was hard as hair of last week

04:07:48.200 --> 04:07:53.880
Boomi, what are you doing? You don't need to be up here. You just peed. I don't really appreciate this man

04:07:57.000 --> 04:07:59.000
I'm gonna play with your little pouch

04:08:00.520 --> 04:08:03.240
Boomi titties boomi titties boomi titties

04:08:03.720 --> 04:08:08.920
He's like trying to walk and I'm just like poking his pouch

04:08:10.680 --> 04:08:12.680
He has like

04:08:13.880 --> 04:08:15.880
He has such a pronounced pouch

04:08:16.520 --> 04:08:22.680
He looks like he has boobies especially because his nipples hang out boomi. Can you not paw at my tentacle?

04:08:23.560 --> 04:08:26.040
He just like backed it. He's backed my tentacle

04:08:26.600 --> 04:08:30.760
He's my tentacle to hold up my headphones. I still haven't used it yet because I haven't been feeling good

04:08:31.480 --> 04:08:33.480
Maybe I'll use my tentacle later

04:08:34.520 --> 04:08:36.520
For something other than headphone use

04:08:37.560 --> 04:08:39.560
Hi Yashom

04:08:40.040 --> 04:08:44.520
You're making rena nervous. Can you please leave? Thank you. Okay rena

04:08:46.120 --> 04:08:48.120
rena doesn't really want anyone around her

04:08:48.840 --> 04:08:50.280
besides like

04:08:50.280 --> 04:08:52.280
Me and fia so she just doesn't like boomi

04:08:53.800 --> 04:08:56.840
Because like she's fine with fia around her because she's injured

04:08:57.080 --> 04:09:03.800
But if boomi comes near her, she's like very guarded. Did you want to get down rena? I can put you down

04:09:04.680 --> 04:09:07.720
Let me move my microphone up the way and then I'll put you on the floor

04:09:10.200 --> 04:09:13.640
There you go, man. Why don't you go lay down and have some water or something? Yeah

04:09:14.760 --> 04:09:16.760
I'll let you miss John

04:09:17.400 --> 04:09:19.400
She has a follow-up appointment in a couple weeks

04:09:20.760 --> 04:09:22.760
I'm messing with the kitty foopa. Yeah

04:09:22.920 --> 04:09:26.440
Watch a guy for a white mouse far. Yeah, that's true. I need to

04:09:27.560 --> 04:09:35.240
Uh kill some fucking shit for that. Uh, I hate that part because I need to do I need to do his for the the farming thing

04:09:36.120 --> 04:09:38.120
So I can kill that fucking

04:09:38.760 --> 04:09:40.760
Yeah, so I can kill the fucking

04:09:41.960 --> 04:09:43.960
But I also need to get a bow

04:09:44.760 --> 04:09:46.360
Shit

04:09:46.360 --> 04:09:47.880
I could

04:09:47.880 --> 04:09:49.880
go

04:09:50.120 --> 04:09:52.760
Into is it the limb grave?

04:09:53.720 --> 04:09:57.160
Grave or whatever the fuck the dungeon underground

04:09:58.120 --> 04:10:00.120
that

04:10:00.120 --> 04:10:02.120
You get a nice bow from

04:10:03.720 --> 04:10:07.080
Isn't there an urtary thing I can kill get a bow from too

04:10:11.000 --> 04:10:14.920
Remember strong you got power level by chat giving your stacks the stacks of lords rooms

04:10:14.920 --> 04:10:18.040
I don't think there's a reason to mention a pain to find people due to a level

04:10:18.840 --> 04:10:20.840
interesting

04:10:23.000 --> 04:10:31.160
And and if I do it now, it's probably going to be people who are newer players

04:10:37.560 --> 04:10:40.120
Let's go buy a bow. Yeah, but I want a good bow

04:10:42.760 --> 04:10:48.840
Yeah, that's in the first area. Yeah, that's right. I remember getting that before I might go back and do that now that I have a stone sword key

04:10:53.160 --> 04:10:57.800
Yeah, usually I would just get it and get out. I just would read it and it'd be like hey, and then I would just leave

04:11:03.160 --> 04:11:07.400
Serpent go bow, but the serpent I'd have to get what I have to get right card for that

04:11:07.960 --> 04:11:11.720
Where's the serpent bow? No, you can kill right card with the serpent bow

04:11:15.240 --> 04:11:19.960
I want to I want a nice bow. Oh, yeah, that's true. I can get the I can get redawn's bow

04:11:20.760 --> 04:11:22.760
Why don't we just I'll just do that

04:11:27.480 --> 04:11:30.680
I have done the I think when I played I did the AI invasions

04:11:32.120 --> 04:11:34.520
Serpent bow was in the starting era. Where is the serpent bow?

04:11:36.360 --> 04:11:39.800
I remember I have it. I had a certain bow. I forget how I got it though

04:11:40.600 --> 04:11:42.920
Crossbow in the round table. That's a good point

04:11:43.720 --> 04:11:45.720
Caleb cave easy to get to

04:11:46.360 --> 04:11:47.800
Okay

04:11:47.800 --> 04:11:52.360
Okay, which bow do you guys think would be best in redawn's bow serpent bow

04:11:53.320 --> 04:11:55.320
the crossbow

04:11:57.000 --> 04:11:59.720
I might I might do redawn's bow because he's on the way

04:12:04.200 --> 04:12:06.600
He's like he's he's something I have to do anyways

04:12:10.520 --> 04:12:12.520
I think I was bow last time too

04:12:13.320 --> 04:12:19.000
I might just do the AI fight thingy. We'll have better range for the bird farm. Yeah, you're right

04:12:20.200 --> 04:12:23.400
Yeah, see that's why I didn't want to just buy a bow. I think we're gonna do that

04:12:23.400 --> 04:12:25.400
I think we're just gonna get redawn's bow

04:12:25.400 --> 04:12:27.400
Um, then I gotta kill redawn

04:12:27.400 --> 04:12:29.400
Get his bow mimic tear

04:12:31.080 --> 04:12:34.600
Duvar is quest

04:12:37.960 --> 04:12:39.960
Uh, yeah

04:12:42.520 --> 04:12:44.520
I

04:12:45.560 --> 04:12:48.520
My muppet is seven, bro. I'm gonna out the fuck does that mean?

04:12:53.320 --> 04:12:56.360
Yeah, so with the rolling thing that would be like a whole puzzle I have to get to

04:12:56.360 --> 04:12:58.600
Well, it would just be kind of straightforward if I just kill redawn

04:13:08.040 --> 04:13:10.040
I'm very much human serpent

04:13:13.240 --> 04:13:19.160
No, my butt is serving bro. I'm about to act up. What wait, what's wait though? Wait till what wait till I do this, huh?

04:13:20.040 --> 04:13:22.600
Wait till I do this. What if I take these bad puppies off?

04:13:23.640 --> 04:13:25.160
or if I

04:13:25.160 --> 04:13:27.160
Take these puppies away

04:13:29.240 --> 04:13:31.240
Now

04:13:32.040 --> 04:13:34.040
My full power is unleashed

04:13:36.520 --> 04:13:39.240
Now you see me in all my glory

04:13:39.960 --> 04:13:41.960
Yeah

04:13:42.360 --> 04:13:44.360
How's that make you feel?

04:13:45.080 --> 04:13:47.080
Knowing you want to have relations with a puppet

04:13:48.200 --> 04:13:50.200
Dirty dirty boy

04:13:50.280 --> 04:13:51.640

04:13:59.000 --> 04:14:03.960
I'm like, don't even bother don't even draw bother try the shabari. It would just be so annoying to do in this model

04:14:04.760 --> 04:14:06.760
on this little guy

04:14:07.720 --> 04:14:13.480

04:15:17.320 --> 04:15:19.320
Also kill rinola

04:15:20.920 --> 04:15:22.920
Godric for rune

04:15:25.640 --> 04:15:29.800
Like leveling dex barf and dexterity is not the way in this game

04:15:30.280 --> 04:15:31.640
um

04:15:31.640 --> 04:15:33.640
Godric for his great rune

04:15:34.520 --> 04:15:38.760
What is godric's gate rune? What does it do again? I forget

04:15:42.200 --> 04:15:44.840
Do you not need to fight them? Oh, do I have to

04:15:47.160 --> 04:15:49.160
Okay

04:15:49.160 --> 04:15:51.160
Five times every start that's right

04:15:53.400 --> 04:15:57.960
I went godric then moke with a 12 weapon only took me a hundred eighty five times

04:15:58.760 --> 04:16:00.760
Okay

04:16:05.320 --> 04:16:09.720
All right, so change of plans then we're mapping our way

04:16:11.640 --> 04:16:13.640
Um

04:16:16.520 --> 04:16:18.520
Godric the grafted

04:16:18.920 --> 04:16:24.680
I remember I was like so thankful that like there's just like one person that I summoned in that just fucking wrecked him

04:16:25.480 --> 04:16:27.480
with a comet

04:16:27.480 --> 04:16:29.480
And I was like yo

04:16:32.200 --> 04:16:35.480
Getting softcap so uh, but it's it's good for like

04:16:36.840 --> 04:16:41.560
Just a basic thing though. I don't yeah, that's I think that's why they put him at the beginning of the game

04:16:44.280 --> 04:16:46.920
Beware of any moke type enemies. What do you mean?

04:16:49.960 --> 04:16:51.960
Excuse me

04:16:52.120 --> 04:16:55.480
That's pretty solid. I get myself myself a seven out of ten for that. Maybe eight

04:16:57.640 --> 04:16:59.640
If it was like oh, then I would have been better

04:17:01.960 --> 04:17:06.840
Yeah, okay, that's all I agree. I agree with these I agree with these a little tisker

04:17:08.280 --> 04:17:13.800
I love how me and strawnee both call it tisker because in my head I read it as tisker and she also calls it a tisker

04:17:16.120 --> 04:17:18.840
We'll carry you until you get rid of dons. Yeah, precisely

04:17:20.280 --> 04:17:23.480
Okay, I think I'm gonna level myself

04:17:24.440 --> 04:17:26.440
intelligence

04:17:27.880 --> 04:17:29.480
but like

04:17:29.480 --> 04:17:33.240
What weapon do I get again? I've never done an intelligence build

04:17:35.160 --> 04:17:37.720
I've done faith. I've done strength

04:17:38.680 --> 04:17:41.320
I've done dexterity. I've done arcane

04:17:42.280 --> 04:17:47.080
I've never really like messed with the magic aspect of Elden Ring minus like what's in faith

04:17:48.840 --> 04:17:50.840
I never did any of the sorcery shit

04:17:51.800 --> 04:17:53.800
I

04:17:54.360 --> 04:17:57.480
Wish I did because it's like perfect for long range

04:18:00.440 --> 04:18:02.440

I 100 agree. Okay. Uh, where's the moonville?

04:18:25.480 --> 04:18:28.520
It's in kaolin. It's in what you're gonna call it

04:18:29.720 --> 04:18:31.960
I need to get the kaolin map

04:18:32.600 --> 04:18:38.920
Uh, let's go over here and run to get the kaolin. Wait, there's a cliff, isn't there?

04:18:39.960 --> 04:18:43.720
Oh, fuck me. I know there's like one here one there one there

04:18:45.800 --> 04:18:47.800
I'm gonna start up here first actually

04:18:51.560 --> 04:18:53.560
You

04:18:53.880 --> 04:18:58.280
Tunnel for left that's right. I want to do frost because I think frost would be fun

04:18:59.320 --> 04:19:02.920
And some of the gravity shit. Um, yeah, isn't it?

04:19:05.000 --> 04:19:08.280
Is it right? Is this this isn't it right? This isn't where it is, right?

04:19:09.640 --> 04:19:14.360
It's not here. It's like there's one like over here, right? I don't know am I tripping

04:19:16.680 --> 04:19:18.680
It's this one

04:19:20.920 --> 04:19:22.920
This is the one

04:19:27.080 --> 04:19:29.080
Sometimes we need some rotten cotton

04:19:33.560 --> 04:19:38.600
All the magic bug casters it's in the selly uh, it's in the selly the caves

04:19:43.400 --> 04:19:47.720
Plates patiently for everybody to catch up and respond. I'm just gonna look

04:19:51.720 --> 04:19:53.720
Oh

04:20:05.960 --> 04:20:08.920
I'm debating whether or not to stay because I was gonna go over

04:20:09.880 --> 04:20:13.240
Salem's house tomorrow to hang with her at her pool that she has at her house

04:20:15.320 --> 04:20:18.040
For jill 4th of july, but I also want to keep an eye on arena

04:20:18.920 --> 04:20:23.960
And I'll be stressed out if I go and if I do that, I'll probably just do a gorilla tomorrow of elden ring

04:20:26.120 --> 04:20:28.120
And do some grocery shopping and shit

04:20:28.840 --> 04:20:30.840
um

04:20:32.200 --> 04:20:35.800
Sorry, I thought of that because she just texted me. She's like, you don't have to come over if you want to check on her

04:20:36.280 --> 04:20:38.280
Okay

04:20:39.160 --> 04:20:43.960
Well, me who are you talking to? I hear you making funny noises. I think rena just hissed at him

04:20:48.040 --> 04:20:50.040
Uh

04:20:56.440 --> 04:21:06.120
Okay, it is that tunnel. Okay, there is a grace right over here

04:21:08.920 --> 04:21:15.160
This one here this one here. I really should just go up and around to be honest

04:21:15.160 --> 04:21:17.160
I

04:21:17.640 --> 04:21:22.520
Kind of need to find where all the maps are. I'll go get this map and I'll be I think I'll that'll do me a little bit better

04:21:22.520 --> 04:21:24.360
Let's do that

04:21:24.360 --> 04:21:26.920
Don't forget your milk and I know I need milk and eggs

04:21:32.360 --> 04:21:34.360
I still have this in my hand

04:21:37.400 --> 04:21:39.400
I didn't mean to do that

04:21:39.720 --> 04:21:43.080
Um, okay, I have a lot of rooms so

04:21:45.640 --> 04:21:52.520
What do you guys suggest that I should do because I can

04:21:54.920 --> 04:21:56.920
Get to level 35

04:22:00.680 --> 04:22:03.720
Which it's not as much as I thought it would be to be honest with you

04:22:04.120 --> 04:22:06.120
I

04:22:09.080 --> 04:22:11.080
Just all in vigor

04:22:11.720 --> 04:22:13.720
All 37 a little bigger

04:22:15.160 --> 04:22:19.880
Well, yeah, I know I'm supposed to do bigger, but what should I scale for everything else should I get everything at like 20?

04:22:28.040 --> 04:22:30.840
I think I accidentally also put stuff like intelligence at 20

04:22:34.280 --> 04:22:36.280
You

04:22:40.520 --> 04:22:42.680
Next 30 needs to be 17 for the moon veil

04:22:48.520 --> 04:22:50.520
Okay

04:22:55.320 --> 04:22:57.320
Fine for more fp

04:22:58.040 --> 04:23:00.040
I

04:23:03.000 --> 04:23:05.000
Think I'm gonna do

04:23:07.720 --> 04:23:09.720
20

04:23:15.720 --> 04:23:20.600
Yeah, I'm not gonna worry about faith right now to be honest with you. I can always respect that later

04:23:20.600 --> 04:23:22.600
I

04:23:23.560 --> 04:23:26.840
Need 18 decks and 15 strength for a dawn bow

04:23:28.760 --> 04:23:30.760
Really

04:23:32.600 --> 04:23:34.600
Fuck

04:23:35.080 --> 04:23:37.080
Ha

04:23:38.200 --> 04:23:41.880
Will the serpents bow be better than what does the serpent bow scale with?

04:23:42.440 --> 04:23:51.400
Because I was thinking about like because I think this looks good

04:23:57.560 --> 04:23:59.560
I can do hand the bow. Okay, that's what I thought

04:24:01.480 --> 04:24:03.640
Okay, but I'm not gonna worry about that then

04:24:06.200 --> 04:24:08.200
Um

04:24:08.440 --> 04:24:12.280
Sore seal a little farming

04:24:14.440 --> 04:24:16.600

The rain's so nice. I love me a good thunderstorm

04:24:39.160 --> 04:24:41.160

04:25:03.560 --> 04:25:06.440
Okay, I have one more level yet left. What should I put it into?

04:25:08.200 --> 04:25:10.200
A mortar actually I might just put it into mind

04:25:11.240 --> 04:25:15.640
Something for your mind mind mind mind

04:25:17.240 --> 04:25:19.240
And I can get

04:25:19.960 --> 04:25:21.960
Health

04:25:22.040 --> 04:25:24.040

Oh, I hope there's NSFW fan art puppet just like how I'm something someone said they're digging it. That'd be hilarious

04:25:49.560 --> 04:25:51.560
Hmm

04:25:51.880 --> 04:25:53.880
Where's the sore seal

04:25:55.720 --> 04:25:57.720

04:26:02.040 --> 04:26:04.040
And I can always respect

I have 6,000 rooms though. I kind of want to make sure I can get one more level

04:26:18.280 --> 04:26:23.000
Sore sales behind me what what do you mean?

04:26:25.400 --> 04:26:28.520
It's just behind me behind me is it this no

04:26:28.520 --> 04:26:33.400
I'm kidding because I never I never use the sore seal before

04:26:38.920 --> 04:26:41.720
It's in the fort by the dragon what the fuck

04:26:44.600 --> 04:26:46.600
In which direction

04:26:52.360 --> 04:26:55.800
Bottom level it's below the dragon

04:26:58.520 --> 04:27:00.520
So

04:27:00.760 --> 04:27:02.760
Oh god

04:27:04.520 --> 04:27:09.640
When you go up and then down so like co-across to the side then down there

04:27:15.800 --> 04:27:18.520
Oh, it's in fort ferro, okay

04:27:21.640 --> 04:27:26.520
The sore seal where you build you want us to howl agree. I don't feel like fighting millennia. No

04:27:28.520 --> 04:27:31.720
Okay, then I'll go to the 50k dragon

04:27:34.360 --> 04:27:36.360
I'll get that sore seal

04:27:43.960 --> 04:27:45.960
Hi honey

04:27:47.240 --> 04:27:50.600
I killed your mom you have a lot of cubes dude. Oh fuck

04:27:58.840 --> 04:28:01.240
Again, I don't remember where names or things are

04:28:20.440 --> 04:28:25.960
I'm saying a giant pumpkin distance. Oh, hey, my runes are still here

04:28:26.920 --> 04:28:29.720
Hey, I got five runes. Let's go

04:28:31.080 --> 04:28:34.360
Oh, hold on. Hold on. I should have gone this way instead

04:28:37.400 --> 04:28:39.800
Every guy is supposed to go down rather than up

04:28:43.880 --> 04:28:45.880
Oh torrents fly

04:28:51.640 --> 04:28:53.640
I can't see

04:28:54.600 --> 04:28:58.360
Raven it's your birthday. I can't swim

04:29:13.960 --> 04:29:15.960
Okay

04:29:23.640 --> 04:29:29.480
I don't know if we'll try to bang an elder than dragon. Uh

04:29:32.360 --> 04:29:34.600
Oh this fucking oh fuck

04:29:36.440 --> 04:29:42.760
Oh, I remember this, uh, where is this again in here? Is there a pumpkin head in here?

04:29:46.200 --> 04:29:48.200
I kind of sworn there's

04:29:49.800 --> 04:29:53.000
I'm thinking of the wrong forts because I could have sworn there was a golden

04:29:53.800 --> 04:29:59.480
Thingamabob right over here. I guess I was wrong. I might be thinking of the wrong place

04:30:10.440 --> 04:30:12.760
Oh, this is the one with the fucking harpies in it

04:30:15.160 --> 04:30:17.160
Fuck me, um

04:30:17.720 --> 04:30:19.720
Oh

04:30:22.680 --> 04:30:24.680
Hold on

04:30:27.000 --> 04:30:29.000
Let me just take a

04:30:29.720 --> 04:30:31.720
Oh

04:30:46.680 --> 04:30:48.680
Yeah, but like

04:30:59.400 --> 04:31:01.400
Okay

04:31:17.560 --> 04:31:19.880
You get a fucking lantern, that's why I need to fucking get

04:31:24.520 --> 04:31:27.960
All right, you get up there good job

04:31:29.080 --> 04:31:31.640
On the top where the gallows are that's right

04:31:32.520 --> 04:31:35.800
I remember this and any other invisible dude

04:31:36.680 --> 04:31:38.680
You jump down

04:31:39.320 --> 04:31:41.320
Go around

04:31:42.360 --> 04:31:45.800
Okay, you gotta watch the fucking rat jump across

04:31:47.960 --> 04:31:50.600
Giant rat get down again

04:31:54.280 --> 04:31:56.280
Oh

04:31:56.440 --> 04:31:59.640
There it is dragon source, you know, all right

04:32:04.680 --> 04:32:11.720
Um, it's kind of dark. Should I wait I'm gonna wait whole day. That's a good idea. Oh no shit

04:32:14.680 --> 04:32:16.680
No torrent

04:32:17.480 --> 04:32:19.480
I

04:32:23.080 --> 04:32:24.920
See better because you guys don't fucking

04:32:34.200 --> 04:32:40.040
It's gonna run past all the elderly. Yeah, no, I got this. I got this. I got this. I got this. I got this

04:32:40.920 --> 04:32:42.920
I'm proud of myself

04:32:46.760 --> 04:32:52.840
Kind of like don't want to hold this though. I just want to run. I feel like I'm lighter this way. All right, go

04:33:03.240 --> 04:33:05.240
Fine

04:33:13.240 --> 04:33:15.240
The fuck is below me

04:33:17.160 --> 04:33:44.200
All right, all right, we're good. We're good. We go down, we go down, we don't down, we run, we run, we're running

04:33:44.200 --> 04:33:54.200
We're jumping, we're going down, we're going down, we're going down, we're going down.

04:33:54.200 --> 04:33:55.200
Oh.

04:33:55.200 --> 04:33:56.200
Um.

04:33:56.200 --> 04:34:01.200
Come on, I need to heal.

04:34:01.200 --> 04:34:11.340
No, I gotta go back and get my runes.

04:34:11.340 --> 04:34:18.340
I like, I spazzed out and I couldn't remember, I'm like, how do I heal?

04:34:18.340 --> 04:34:22.340
I just got scared, I just got scared.

04:34:22.340 --> 04:34:33.340
It's fine though, we're gonna go get it.

04:34:33.340 --> 04:34:35.340
Also increases damage taken.

04:34:36.340 --> 04:34:46.340
Why did I want this again?

04:34:46.340 --> 04:34:49.340
I don't.

04:34:49.340 --> 04:34:50.340
Uh.

04:34:50.340 --> 04:35:02.340
How does this, this hasn't raised anything.

04:35:02.340 --> 04:35:12.340
2.

04:35:12.340 --> 04:35:13.340
Just don't get hit.

04:35:13.340 --> 04:35:14.340
Oh, did I burp?

04:35:14.340 --> 04:35:15.340
I didn't even notice.

04:35:15.340 --> 04:35:16.340
Uh.

04:35:16.340 --> 04:35:17.340
Alright.

04:35:17.340 --> 04:35:28.340
Fuck it, we've all, I need my runes.

04:35:28.340 --> 04:35:31.340
Can I get it from here?

04:35:31.340 --> 04:35:34.340
I could just stand close to it and clip it through.

04:35:34.340 --> 04:35:35.340
Um, alright.

04:35:35.340 --> 04:35:37.340
Excuse me, excuse me ladies.

04:35:37.340 --> 04:35:39.340
Fog down.

04:35:43.340 --> 04:35:44.340
Nevermind.

04:35:51.340 --> 04:35:52.340
What the fuck?

04:35:52.340 --> 04:35:57.340
I could have sworn I heard somebody else talking in the chat and that threw me off.

04:35:57.340 --> 04:36:01.340
I'm wondering if Azura came in and like, made a noise and ran away.

04:36:01.340 --> 04:36:03.340
If so, I blame her for dying.

04:36:06.340 --> 04:36:08.340
Did anybody else hear that?

04:36:10.340 --> 04:36:12.340
Oh, hi Boomi.

04:36:17.340 --> 04:36:19.340
How many did I lose on my runes?

04:36:20.340 --> 04:36:23.340
How about I get like half of them back?

04:36:23.340 --> 04:36:26.340
Cause I don't, I don't want to but I'm like one more level, you know?

04:36:26.340 --> 04:36:28.340
That's why I kind of want them.

04:36:28.340 --> 04:36:30.340
Oh yeah, they're gone, gone.

04:36:30.340 --> 04:36:32.340
Okay, nevermind.

04:36:32.340 --> 04:36:33.340
Boomi, I can't see past you.

04:36:33.340 --> 04:36:34.340
I can't see past you.

04:36:34.340 --> 04:36:36.340
I can't see past you, Boomi.

04:36:36.340 --> 04:36:38.340
Boomi, please.

04:36:38.340 --> 04:36:40.340
Can you fall me out?

04:36:43.340 --> 04:36:45.340
Boomi, please.

04:36:47.340 --> 04:36:48.340
Get off my desk.

04:36:48.340 --> 04:36:49.340
Boomi, please.

04:36:49.340 --> 04:36:51.340
Get off my desk.

04:36:51.340 --> 04:36:53.340
What's going on here?

04:36:53.340 --> 04:36:54.340
Oh, okay.

04:36:54.340 --> 04:36:55.340
Miss Dart.

04:36:55.340 --> 04:36:57.340
Oh, you're fucking huge ass.

04:36:57.340 --> 04:36:59.340
Oh my god, it's so heavy.

04:36:59.340 --> 04:37:03.340
I mean, now you're captured and you get kiss it.

04:37:08.340 --> 04:37:10.340
Why are you so warm?

04:37:11.340 --> 04:37:12.340
My thumbs.

04:37:12.340 --> 04:37:14.340
Why are you so warm?

04:37:15.340 --> 04:37:17.340
Cause we don't mind being held like this.

04:37:17.340 --> 04:37:19.340
What's that?

04:37:19.340 --> 04:37:21.340
Usually you do mind being held like this.

04:37:21.340 --> 04:37:23.340
Can you make a tissue?

04:37:23.340 --> 04:37:25.340
Why are you trying to touch me, Boomi?

04:37:26.340 --> 04:37:28.340
Why are you trying to treat us?

04:37:28.340 --> 04:37:30.340
What's up with you?

04:37:30.340 --> 04:37:31.340
What's with you?

04:37:31.340 --> 04:37:33.340
Why are you trying to treat us?

04:37:34.340 --> 04:37:36.340
How much space do you need?

04:37:40.340 --> 04:37:41.340
Bye-bye.

04:37:43.340 --> 04:37:45.340
You're also protecting me.

04:37:47.340 --> 04:37:48.340
All right.

04:37:48.340 --> 04:37:49.340
It's fine.

04:37:49.340 --> 04:37:50.340
Don't worry about it.

04:37:50.340 --> 04:37:51.340
We're good.

04:38:00.340 --> 04:38:01.340
Inventory.

04:38:01.340 --> 04:38:03.340
We are switching to...

04:38:06.340 --> 04:38:07.340
Free Spear.

04:38:07.340 --> 04:38:08.340
Free Spear.

04:38:16.340 --> 04:38:19.340
Okay, this is the only thing I can essentially fucking use right now.

04:38:25.340 --> 04:38:26.340
Can I...

04:38:28.340 --> 04:38:29.340
Really unclip?

04:38:38.340 --> 04:38:39.340
Let's go.

04:38:44.340 --> 04:38:46.340
Can you use this on top of a horse?

04:38:48.340 --> 04:38:51.340
I don't understand why you can't use stuff from a top of a horse.

04:38:51.340 --> 04:38:53.340
That's like the only thing that's stupid of me.

04:38:56.340 --> 04:38:59.340
Okay, time to...

04:39:00.340 --> 04:39:03.340
go to that...

04:39:07.340 --> 04:39:10.340
something on the way.

04:39:16.340 --> 04:39:18.340
That's a big ass tower.

04:39:20.340 --> 04:39:21.340
Equipment.

04:39:21.340 --> 04:39:22.340
Yeah, sorry.

04:39:22.340 --> 04:39:23.340
I'm a little stupid.

04:39:23.340 --> 04:39:24.340
I'm a little slow.

04:39:25.340 --> 04:39:26.340
All right.

04:39:31.340 --> 04:39:32.340
Great.

04:39:32.340 --> 04:39:34.340
Now I have to get to this fucking dungeon, too, after this.

04:39:34.340 --> 04:39:35.340
Oh, hi.

04:39:35.340 --> 04:39:36.340
It's the dragon.

04:39:36.340 --> 04:39:37.340
Why are you so alive?

04:39:38.340 --> 04:39:40.340
Because you died with your family,

04:39:40.340 --> 04:39:42.340
which I'm so comfortable with.

04:39:45.340 --> 04:39:47.340
Oh, there's all going to be little tangle monsters in here.

04:39:47.340 --> 04:39:49.340
These trees are just dancing.

04:39:49.340 --> 04:39:51.340
Oh, I forgot how many dragons are around here.

04:39:51.340 --> 04:39:53.340
I thought it was going to be a little tangle,

04:39:53.340 --> 04:39:56.340
a muncher monster.

04:39:59.340 --> 04:40:01.340
Please do not get aggroed.

04:40:05.340 --> 04:40:06.340
Okay.

04:40:14.340 --> 04:40:16.340
Wait, am I going the wrong way?

04:40:16.340 --> 04:40:17.340
I kind of did.

04:40:18.340 --> 04:40:20.340
I thought I should go back.

04:40:21.340 --> 04:40:22.340
Oh, God.

04:40:22.340 --> 04:40:24.340
Wow, it's such a beautiful day out.

04:40:24.340 --> 04:40:25.340
Perpetual sunset.

04:40:25.340 --> 04:40:26.340
Love it.

04:40:27.340 --> 04:40:28.340
Pretty nice.

04:40:30.340 --> 04:40:31.340
Hi, dragons.

04:40:31.340 --> 04:40:33.340
Please don't kill me, dragons.

04:40:36.340 --> 04:40:37.340
Please, dragons.

04:40:37.340 --> 04:40:39.340
I'm only level 35, dragons.

04:40:42.340 --> 04:40:43.340
Oh.

04:40:47.340 --> 04:40:49.340
I wish I could pick up items.

04:40:49.340 --> 04:40:51.340
Torrent, can you pick it up for me?

04:40:54.340 --> 04:40:56.340
Why is it called dragon mode?

04:41:02.340 --> 04:41:04.340
I need K-Lid map.

04:41:06.340 --> 04:41:10.340
Let's just follow this path.

04:41:10.340 --> 04:41:12.340
I could go...

04:41:13.340 --> 04:41:15.340
Because there's like, there's graces around.

04:41:15.340 --> 04:41:17.340
Like, there's one over here, one over there,

04:41:17.340 --> 04:41:18.340
and one over there.

04:41:18.340 --> 04:41:20.340
I don't have a lot of graces active right now.

04:41:20.340 --> 04:41:22.340
I definitely need some.

04:41:24.340 --> 04:41:26.340
But, let's...

04:41:26.340 --> 04:41:28.340
I don't think I'll be able to cross over here.

04:41:29.340 --> 04:41:30.340
Yeah.

04:41:30.340 --> 04:41:31.340
Let me try.

04:41:35.340 --> 04:41:36.340
Okay.

04:41:42.340 --> 04:41:43.340
Okay, alright.

04:41:46.340 --> 04:41:48.340
There's a doggy.

04:41:48.340 --> 04:41:49.340
Do you see it?

04:41:53.340 --> 04:41:54.340
It's here.

04:41:57.340 --> 04:41:59.340
I love this so I can see where I'm going.

04:42:00.340 --> 04:42:01.340
Oh, don't die.

04:42:01.340 --> 04:42:02.340
Good job.

04:42:02.340 --> 04:42:03.340
Let's go, sweetie.

04:42:06.340 --> 04:42:09.340
What the fuck up dog?

04:42:14.340 --> 04:42:15.340
Oh, not this guy.

04:42:16.340 --> 04:42:17.340
Hello.

04:42:24.340 --> 04:42:26.340
Why is everything on fire here?

04:42:26.340 --> 04:42:27.340
You guys have better things to do.

04:42:27.340 --> 04:42:28.340
It's so hot.

04:42:35.340 --> 04:42:37.340
My nose is itchy.

04:42:41.340 --> 04:42:43.340
Okay, there should be Diagro.

04:42:43.340 --> 04:42:44.340
This is good.

04:42:44.340 --> 04:42:46.340
There's a grace right over here.

04:42:46.340 --> 04:42:47.340
Perfect.

04:42:50.340 --> 04:42:52.340
California is so beautiful.

04:42:54.340 --> 04:42:55.340
Yeah, I know.

04:42:55.340 --> 04:42:56.340
I mean, like...

04:42:59.340 --> 04:43:00.340
Yeah.

04:43:00.340 --> 04:43:02.340
I don't know what I was going to say.

04:43:02.340 --> 04:43:04.340
I was reading something and I lost my train of thought.

04:43:06.340 --> 04:43:09.340
Can I put this in a bite?

04:43:09.340 --> 04:43:11.340
Can I put this little fucking stick in my other hands?

04:43:18.340 --> 04:43:20.340
There are graces everywhere if you know where they are.

04:43:20.340 --> 04:43:25.340
Wow, that is the most profound thing I've ever heard in my life.

04:43:25.340 --> 04:43:26.340
Holy shit.

04:43:28.340 --> 04:43:32.340
If you just look around you, there are so many graces.

04:43:33.340 --> 04:43:35.340
You just have to know where they are.

04:43:35.340 --> 04:43:36.340
No shit, bro.

04:43:37.340 --> 04:43:41.340
Why is it still saying that my stuff is over there when it disappeared?

04:43:41.340 --> 04:43:42.340
I don't...

04:43:42.340 --> 04:43:43.340
Go away.

04:43:43.340 --> 04:43:44.340
Go away.

04:43:44.340 --> 04:43:45.340
I don't need it.

04:43:49.340 --> 04:43:51.340
Let's just die again so I don't have to...

04:43:51.340 --> 04:43:53.340
I hate having the marker there because it's throwing me off.

04:43:53.340 --> 04:43:54.340
What the fuck?

04:43:54.340 --> 04:43:55.340
It's over here.

04:44:00.340 --> 04:44:02.340
I'm actually getting bitched out by a Muppet.

04:44:02.340 --> 04:44:03.340
That's funny.

04:44:03.340 --> 04:44:04.340
Hi, lady.

04:44:04.340 --> 04:44:05.340
Bye, lady.

04:44:05.340 --> 04:44:07.340
I'm not showing you my fucking fingers.

04:44:07.340 --> 04:44:08.340
You fucking freak.

04:44:09.340 --> 04:44:11.340
I was just touching and smelling fingers.

04:44:11.340 --> 04:44:12.340
You fucking freak.

04:44:13.340 --> 04:44:14.340
You're all freaks.

04:44:15.340 --> 04:44:16.340
You're all fucking stoked.

04:44:17.340 --> 04:44:19.340
Fuck eat a puppy.

04:44:19.340 --> 04:44:21.340
No, you don't want to do it.

04:44:21.340 --> 04:44:23.340
I'm gonna go around the puppy.

04:44:23.340 --> 04:44:24.340
Come on.

04:44:24.340 --> 04:44:25.340
Torrent.

04:44:25.340 --> 04:44:26.340
Oh, Torrent.

04:44:26.340 --> 04:44:27.340
Oh, Torrent.

04:44:27.340 --> 04:44:29.340
Oh, Torrent, please.

04:44:32.340 --> 04:44:33.340
They said more health.

04:44:38.340 --> 04:44:39.340
It's okay.

04:44:39.340 --> 04:44:40.340
It's all right.

04:44:40.340 --> 04:44:41.340
I want that.

04:44:43.340 --> 04:44:44.340
Oh, nothing.

04:44:44.340 --> 04:44:45.340
There's people on fire.

04:44:47.340 --> 04:44:49.340
Everybody's just on fire.

04:44:49.340 --> 04:44:50.340
I'm so sick of it.

04:44:52.340 --> 04:44:54.340
Beautiful California whistle.

04:44:55.340 --> 04:44:57.340
I like when things die and just give me rooms.

04:44:59.340 --> 04:45:01.340
That's my favorite.

04:45:04.340 --> 04:45:05.340
Okay.

04:45:07.340 --> 04:45:08.340
Oh, fuck it.

04:45:08.340 --> 04:45:11.340
Can you please stop agroing?

04:45:13.340 --> 04:45:15.340
I don't want to pick up these rooms.

04:45:15.340 --> 04:45:17.340
Hello, little slug thing.

04:45:22.340 --> 04:45:23.340
Oh, there's lava.

04:45:39.340 --> 04:45:41.340
Everyone, did I miss?

04:45:41.340 --> 04:45:42.340
Thank you, good.

04:45:42.340 --> 04:45:43.340
Bye, little sluggies.

04:45:46.340 --> 04:45:47.340
Okay.

04:45:47.340 --> 04:45:49.340
It's right around here.

04:45:50.340 --> 04:45:53.340
I fork or where the opening is.

04:45:53.340 --> 04:45:55.340
And I can't, oh, I can't open the map.

04:45:58.340 --> 04:46:00.340
It's like right here.

04:46:03.340 --> 04:46:05.340
Tell me your wisdom.

04:46:07.340 --> 04:46:08.340
That's not helpful.

04:46:08.340 --> 04:46:09.340
Oh, fuck.

04:46:09.340 --> 04:46:11.340
Oh, because I am.

04:46:13.340 --> 04:46:16.340
I can show you the world.

04:46:16.340 --> 04:46:17.340
There it is.

04:46:17.340 --> 04:46:21.340
Shining, shimmering, kaolin.

04:46:21.340 --> 04:46:25.340
Tell me, harem, did you ever thought

04:46:25.340 --> 04:46:28.340
you could be on a magic carpet ride?

04:46:28.340 --> 04:46:31.340
A whole new floor.

04:46:31.340 --> 04:46:35.340
A dazzling brothel you never knew.

04:46:35.340 --> 04:46:38.340
And when you're way up here,

04:46:39.340 --> 04:46:41.340
you're super queer.

04:46:43.340 --> 04:46:44.340
Sorry.

04:46:45.340 --> 04:46:50.340
Now I'm in a heart with you.

04:46:50.340 --> 04:46:53.340
Now I'm in a whole new heart.

04:46:55.340 --> 04:46:59.340
Unbelievable tits.

04:47:01.340 --> 04:47:02.340
I wonder where he's going.

04:47:05.340 --> 04:47:07.340
Oh, I meant to do this.

04:47:08.340 --> 04:47:09.340
Hey.

04:47:09.340 --> 04:47:10.340
Hey.

04:47:22.340 --> 04:47:25.340
I thought there was going to be like a platform below.

04:47:29.340 --> 04:47:31.340
Well, how many deaths am I at?

04:47:31.340 --> 04:47:32.340
Like five?

04:47:32.340 --> 04:47:33.340
That's actually pretty good.

04:47:34.340 --> 04:47:37.340
All right, let's let's try that again.

04:47:38.340 --> 04:47:39.340
Oh, fuck.

04:47:39.340 --> 04:47:41.340
I have to go all over there.

04:47:43.340 --> 04:47:44.340
Hi, lady.

04:47:44.340 --> 04:47:45.340
Bye, lady.

04:47:45.340 --> 04:47:46.340
Fucking freak.

04:47:46.340 --> 04:47:47.340
Okay.

04:47:49.340 --> 04:47:53.340
Wait, I know there's a closer one.

04:47:54.340 --> 04:47:56.340
Let me just make sure.

04:48:01.340 --> 04:48:04.340
It's over here, I believe.

04:48:04.340 --> 04:48:08.340
I might just run around the path and get to that one.

04:48:08.340 --> 04:48:12.340
Just so it'll be easier for me to go across, I think.

04:48:12.340 --> 04:48:14.340
I don't know, actually.

04:48:14.340 --> 04:48:19.340
Well, actually, let me go back to where I was and then we'll try it.

04:48:21.340 --> 04:48:23.340
Okay, don't fuck with the dog and the bird.

04:48:23.340 --> 04:48:27.340
I didn't see the bird up there before for whatever fucking reason.

04:48:29.340 --> 04:48:30.340
Hi puppies.

04:48:30.340 --> 04:48:32.340
Oh, hello puppies.

04:48:32.340 --> 04:48:33.340
Hi puppy.

04:48:33.340 --> 04:48:35.340
I love puppy.

04:48:35.340 --> 04:48:38.340
I love donkeys so much, puppy.

04:48:41.340 --> 04:48:43.340
What are y'all doing over here?

04:48:45.340 --> 04:48:48.340
Just forcing a poor crab to, oh, this is what's happening.

04:48:48.340 --> 04:48:50.340
Oh yeah, give me all of the, no.

04:48:50.340 --> 04:48:52.340
I just wanted to watch you guys fight.

04:48:53.340 --> 04:48:54.340
What's my job, bro?

04:48:54.340 --> 04:48:59.340
Why don't you focus on the fucking crab killing your ass in the dog?

04:49:00.340 --> 04:49:02.340
Yeah, well, how about that?

04:49:05.340 --> 04:49:08.340
Yeah, the dog's fucking bopping your asses.

04:49:08.340 --> 04:49:10.340
Holy shit, they're killing him.

04:49:10.340 --> 04:49:12.340
They just killed that crab together.

04:49:12.340 --> 04:49:15.340
Oh god, oh, I'm next, aren't I?

04:49:15.340 --> 04:49:16.340
I should probably leave.

04:49:16.340 --> 04:49:18.340
I think that's a good idea.

04:49:18.340 --> 04:49:20.340
I think leaving is a great idea.

04:49:23.340 --> 04:49:25.340
Actually, I do have to go back around.

04:49:26.340 --> 04:49:28.340
Yeah, they're distracted.

04:49:28.340 --> 04:49:30.340
Fine, they're distracted.

04:49:31.340 --> 04:49:33.340
Why don't you guys go fight the dog?

04:49:33.340 --> 04:49:36.340
I kind of wish their dogs would come over here and just kill these dudes.

04:49:38.340 --> 04:49:40.340
Surprise, it was I.

04:49:40.340 --> 04:49:42.340
It was me.

04:49:42.340 --> 04:49:44.340
Oh yeah, no, I wouldn't be able to do that.

04:49:44.340 --> 04:49:50.340
There's no point because, yeah, that wouldn't work out.

04:49:51.340 --> 04:49:53.340
So I guess it's like this.

04:49:59.340 --> 04:50:01.340
Why is that?

04:50:01.340 --> 04:50:03.340
Oh, it's so red.

04:50:03.340 --> 04:50:05.340
I'm like, I thought there was like a gap there.

04:50:06.340 --> 04:50:11.340
Hi, hello, let me just get down.

04:50:11.340 --> 04:50:19.340
Oh, um, well, how am I supposed to get down from there?

04:50:25.340 --> 04:50:27.340
He pushed me off.

04:50:29.340 --> 04:50:31.340
I'm playing this game for the first time.

04:50:31.340 --> 04:50:33.340
I'm mad at being silly.

04:50:34.340 --> 04:50:35.340
It's okay, birds aren't even real.

04:50:35.340 --> 04:50:36.340
You know what?

04:50:36.340 --> 04:50:37.340
You're real for saying that.

04:50:37.340 --> 04:50:39.340
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

04:50:39.340 --> 04:50:41.340
Anyways, torrent, wait.

04:50:42.340 --> 04:50:44.340
Okay, that's still there.

04:50:48.340 --> 04:50:49.340
Fuck.

04:50:49.340 --> 04:50:51.340
Oh my god, Boomi, what the fuck are you doing behind me?

04:50:51.340 --> 04:50:53.340
You're freaking me out.

04:50:53.340 --> 04:50:55.340
You're making weird noises and you're scaring me.

04:50:55.340 --> 04:50:57.340
I thought it was somebody else.

04:50:57.340 --> 04:50:59.340
My door locked.

04:51:00.340 --> 04:51:02.340
You can't tell.

04:51:05.340 --> 04:51:06.340
Door is locked.

04:51:06.340 --> 04:51:07.340
Okay, we're good.

04:51:08.340 --> 04:51:09.340
I'm scared.

04:51:09.340 --> 04:51:14.340
I'm notorious and some of you guys know that I just leave my door locked.

04:51:14.340 --> 04:51:17.340
I'm not sure I leave to go do something.

04:51:19.340 --> 04:51:22.340
Puppies are gonna fall on me.

04:51:22.340 --> 04:51:24.340
It's fine, it's all good.

04:51:25.340 --> 04:51:27.340
I'm gonna lead them to the little crabby.

04:51:27.340 --> 04:51:29.340
He's having a little spat.

04:51:30.340 --> 04:51:32.340
Hi, hello, hey.

04:51:33.340 --> 04:51:35.340
Ow, how the fuck did you get me?

04:51:36.340 --> 04:51:39.340
Where the fuck did that dog come from?

04:51:50.340 --> 04:51:52.340
How do I get down?

04:51:53.340 --> 04:51:55.340
Hello?

04:51:55.340 --> 04:51:56.340
Hi.

04:51:57.340 --> 04:52:00.340
This kid is missing us, so turn me into Muppet.

04:52:00.340 --> 04:52:02.340
I'm a fucking Muppet, bro.

04:52:02.340 --> 04:52:04.340
Get Muppet.

04:52:04.340 --> 04:52:06.340
Don't you want to Muppet me?

04:52:06.340 --> 04:52:09.340
Don't you want to have your way with this little Muppet?

04:52:09.340 --> 04:52:11.340
A little soft Muppet body?

04:52:14.340 --> 04:52:19.340
I have just one giant hole just for you.

04:52:19.340 --> 04:52:21.340
First time catching me live?

04:52:21.340 --> 04:52:23.340
This is awkward.

04:52:23.340 --> 04:52:25.340
Third time's the charm, surely.

04:52:25.340 --> 04:52:26.340
How do I get down?

04:52:26.340 --> 04:52:28.340
I don't see a ladder.

04:52:28.340 --> 04:52:30.340
Do you guys have any wisdom?

04:52:30.340 --> 04:52:31.340
Touch bloodstain.

04:52:31.340 --> 04:52:33.340
What about you?

04:52:33.340 --> 04:52:36.340
Okay, you just kind of backed him and then he killed you?

04:52:36.340 --> 04:52:37.340
All right.

04:52:39.340 --> 04:52:41.340
Get my sneak.

04:52:45.340 --> 04:52:46.340
Okay, I can get him.

04:52:46.340 --> 04:52:48.340
I don't know why I didn't get him.

04:52:48.340 --> 04:52:50.340
Whoa, never mind.

04:52:50.340 --> 04:52:51.340
Never mind.

04:52:51.340 --> 04:52:52.340
Never mind.

04:52:52.340 --> 04:52:55.340
Why the fuck are you so strong for no fucking reason?

04:52:59.340 --> 04:53:01.340
Why are you guys looking at each other like that?

04:53:01.340 --> 04:53:03.340
Were they going to kiss afterwards?

04:53:03.340 --> 04:53:05.340
I think they were going to kiss afterwards.

04:53:06.340 --> 04:53:07.340
It was only like 300.

04:53:07.340 --> 04:53:08.340
It doesn't matter.

04:53:08.340 --> 04:53:10.340
It was literally dropping the bucket.

04:53:14.340 --> 04:53:15.340
Where am I going?

04:53:15.340 --> 04:53:17.340
I'm a fucking idiot.

04:53:19.340 --> 04:53:23.340
All this just to get into the freaking dungeon.

04:53:23.340 --> 04:53:24.340
I've never been in this one.

04:53:24.340 --> 04:53:26.340
I've never been in this cave before.

04:53:26.340 --> 04:53:30.340
I never went for the Moonville Katana.

04:53:33.340 --> 04:53:35.340
Boomi, why do you have the zoomies right now?

04:53:39.340 --> 04:53:41.340
See, your food's going off.

04:53:49.340 --> 04:53:50.340
Oh, it's a dog.

04:53:50.340 --> 04:53:51.340
Not a crab.

04:54:02.340 --> 04:54:03.340
Okay, hold on.

04:54:03.340 --> 04:54:05.340
Let me just look for a moment.

04:54:11.340 --> 04:54:12.340
Okay, let us...

04:54:13.340 --> 04:54:19.340
Let me point to above my head.

04:54:20.340 --> 04:54:22.340
Yes, I've played the game before.

04:54:23.340 --> 04:54:25.340
I know Kailit is hard.

04:54:26.340 --> 04:54:28.340
You don't have to tell me, sweetheart.

04:54:36.340 --> 04:54:37.340
Katana.

04:54:43.340 --> 04:54:45.340
If it's two minutes and less...

04:54:45.340 --> 04:54:46.340
Oh, no, you talk.

04:54:46.340 --> 04:54:47.340
I have to mute you now.

04:54:48.340 --> 04:54:49.340
All right.

04:54:50.340 --> 04:54:51.340
Cool, cool, cool.

04:54:52.340 --> 04:54:53.340
Yes.

04:54:53.340 --> 04:54:54.340
Yes.

04:54:56.340 --> 04:54:57.340
What the fuck?

04:54:57.340 --> 04:54:59.340
Oh, he went a different way than I did.

04:54:59.340 --> 04:55:00.340
That's why.

04:55:01.340 --> 04:55:02.340
You...

04:55:02.340 --> 04:55:03.340
Wait, Heidi.

04:55:03.340 --> 04:55:05.340
Okay, you get down there.

04:55:13.340 --> 04:55:18.340
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

04:55:18.340 --> 04:55:19.340
I got you, I got you.

04:55:19.340 --> 04:55:21.340
All I care about is how to get past these guys

04:55:21.340 --> 04:55:22.340
and know where to land.

04:55:22.340 --> 04:55:24.340
I don't care about anything else.

04:55:30.340 --> 04:55:31.340
Right here.

04:55:31.340 --> 04:55:32.340
That's where the platform is.

04:55:32.340 --> 04:55:33.340
Are you going to jump down?

04:55:33.340 --> 04:55:34.340
Fucking bitches.

04:55:38.340 --> 04:55:40.340
Oh, there's fire.

04:55:42.340 --> 04:55:43.340
What?

04:55:44.340 --> 04:55:46.340
Where did the fire come from?

04:55:47.340 --> 04:55:48.340
Where's...

04:55:48.340 --> 04:55:50.340
Where's the fire come from?

04:55:51.340 --> 04:55:52.340
Where did that fire...

04:55:52.340 --> 04:55:53.340
Oh, my God.

04:55:53.340 --> 04:55:55.340
Where did the fire come from?

04:55:57.340 --> 04:55:58.340
Oh, there's a grease down there.

04:55:58.340 --> 04:55:59.340
Sick.

04:56:01.340 --> 04:56:02.340
Sick.

04:56:02.340 --> 04:56:03.340
Oh, no, I'm not going to make it.

04:56:03.340 --> 04:56:04.340
Oh, I made it.

04:56:04.340 --> 04:56:06.340
I don't know where the grease down here.

04:56:06.340 --> 04:56:08.340
There's both clean pots up.

04:56:12.340 --> 04:56:13.340
Let's take a...

04:56:13.340 --> 04:56:14.340
Pop a squat.

04:56:19.340 --> 04:56:20.340
We're so back.

04:56:20.340 --> 04:56:21.340
We're so back.

04:56:24.340 --> 04:56:26.340
Wait, I need to look up the guide again.

04:56:28.340 --> 04:56:29.340
I'm going to go back.

04:56:29.340 --> 04:56:30.340
I'm going to go back.

04:56:30.340 --> 04:56:31.340
I'm going to go back.

04:56:31.340 --> 04:56:32.340
I'm going to go back.

04:56:32.340 --> 04:56:33.340
I'm going back.

04:57:02.340 --> 04:57:03.340
Okay.

04:57:12.340 --> 04:57:13.340
Okay.

04:57:13.340 --> 04:57:14.340
Got it.

04:57:18.340 --> 04:57:19.340
Let's go.

04:57:33.340 --> 04:57:35.340
I'm kind of forget...

04:57:53.340 --> 04:57:54.340
Open.

04:57:55.340 --> 04:57:57.340
Oh, wow, it's this.

04:57:58.340 --> 04:57:59.340
Oh.

04:57:59.340 --> 04:58:00.340
What the hell?

04:58:01.340 --> 04:58:02.340
What are you doing here?

04:58:03.340 --> 04:58:04.340
Is that Alexander?

04:58:07.340 --> 04:58:08.340
How are you?

04:58:10.340 --> 04:58:11.340
How did he...

04:58:11.340 --> 04:58:12.340
How the fuck?

04:58:15.340 --> 04:58:16.340
How the fuck did he get there?

04:58:17.340 --> 04:58:19.340
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

04:58:23.340 --> 04:58:24.340
Well, that's convenient.

04:58:27.340 --> 04:58:28.340
Yeah, yeah.

04:58:29.340 --> 04:58:30.340
What are you doing here, bro?

04:58:33.340 --> 04:58:34.340
That thing.

04:58:49.340 --> 04:58:51.340
Why don't I ever remember meeting you here?

04:58:51.340 --> 04:58:53.340
I never was in this dungeon.

04:58:55.340 --> 04:58:56.340
Is this where you can meet him?

04:58:59.340 --> 04:59:01.340
Where a festival is being held.

04:59:01.340 --> 04:59:04.340
Until I was stumped by that dead end.

04:59:04.340 --> 04:59:06.340
My love, I have returned from doing the dishes.

04:59:06.340 --> 04:59:08.340
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

04:59:10.340 --> 04:59:11.340
Alright, interesting.

04:59:16.340 --> 04:59:18.340
I like how it's a festival just to kill somebody.

04:59:20.340 --> 04:59:22.340
Yeah, it's a milling stone, boy.

04:59:22.340 --> 04:59:23.340
I have to get so many fucking...

04:59:24.340 --> 04:59:25.340
Oh, shit.

04:59:25.340 --> 04:59:26.340
Alright.

04:59:29.340 --> 04:59:31.340
This is just the exit.

04:59:31.340 --> 04:59:32.340
So, let me go...

04:59:33.340 --> 04:59:35.340
Fuck my life up with this boss.

04:59:36.340 --> 04:59:38.340
I'm gonna fucking suck.

04:59:39.340 --> 04:59:41.340
This is gonna take me so long.

04:59:46.340 --> 04:59:48.340
He basically just came as a passage.

04:59:50.340 --> 04:59:52.340
Oh, it's a magma worm.

04:59:58.340 --> 05:00:00.340
This doesn't do the damage.

05:00:08.340 --> 05:00:10.340
This is gonna take a while.

05:00:12.340 --> 05:00:14.340
Why is it so narrow?

05:00:14.340 --> 05:00:16.340
Oh, I didn't push that.

05:00:16.340 --> 05:00:18.340
I didn't push this.

05:00:29.340 --> 05:00:30.340
Oh, no.

05:00:30.340 --> 05:00:31.340
I must stop.

05:00:31.340 --> 05:00:32.340
Summon the ash.

05:00:33.340 --> 05:00:34.340
Yeah, actually, yeah.

05:00:34.340 --> 05:00:36.340
That would take the aggro off of me for a little...

05:00:36.340 --> 05:00:38.340
I like how he just falls back asleep.

05:00:41.340 --> 05:00:43.340
Yeah, maybe I should summon the ash.

05:00:45.340 --> 05:00:46.340
You're still here, bro.

05:00:46.340 --> 05:00:47.340
What's going on?

05:00:48.340 --> 05:00:49.340
I don't know.

05:00:49.340 --> 05:00:50.340
I don't know.

05:00:50.340 --> 05:00:51.340
I don't know.

05:00:51.340 --> 05:00:52.340
I don't know.

05:00:52.340 --> 05:00:53.340
I don't know.

05:00:53.340 --> 05:00:54.340
I don't know.

05:00:54.340 --> 05:00:55.340
I don't know.

05:00:55.340 --> 05:00:56.340
I don't know.

05:00:56.340 --> 05:00:57.340
You're still here, bro.

05:00:57.340 --> 05:00:58.340
What's going on?

05:00:58.340 --> 05:01:00.340
Like you said, you were leaving.

05:01:11.340 --> 05:01:13.340
What's the sigma?

05:01:16.340 --> 05:01:18.340
I didn't even equip the fucking ashes.

05:01:18.340 --> 05:01:20.340
It doesn't matter.

05:01:26.340 --> 05:01:27.340
I don't know.

05:01:40.340 --> 05:01:42.340
Yeah, I was thinking about the meteorite staff

05:01:42.340 --> 05:01:43.340
and the rock sling as well.

05:01:43.340 --> 05:01:44.340
I was thinking about that.

05:01:47.340 --> 05:01:48.340
Okay.

05:01:48.340 --> 05:01:50.340
My fucking butt hurts.

05:01:52.340 --> 05:01:55.340
Raina, I'm sorry, but you can't be on my lap right now, sweetie.

05:01:55.340 --> 05:01:57.340
Mommy's trying to beat a boss in Elden Ring.

05:02:02.340 --> 05:02:04.340
She just flicked her tail in annoyance.

05:02:14.340 --> 05:02:17.340
Should I do the wolves or the jellyfish?

05:02:19.340 --> 05:02:20.340
Which is more effective.

05:02:23.340 --> 05:02:24.340
Excuse me.

05:02:26.340 --> 05:02:27.340
Jellyfish?

05:02:27.340 --> 05:02:28.340
You think?

05:02:32.340 --> 05:02:33.340
Raina, where are you?

05:02:33.340 --> 05:02:34.340
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

05:02:37.340 --> 05:02:38.340
I'm not pressing this button.

05:02:38.340 --> 05:02:39.340
I'm not pressing this button.

05:02:44.340 --> 05:02:46.340
All right, puppy dog.

05:02:46.340 --> 05:02:48.340
Alexander, you want to fucking help me?

05:02:48.340 --> 05:02:50.340
You're just going to stand around and be a jar.

05:02:56.340 --> 05:02:57.340
All right.

05:02:57.340 --> 05:02:58.340
Sick of him.

05:03:00.340 --> 05:03:01.340
I'm going to poke his ass.

05:03:02.340 --> 05:03:04.340
No, Raina, are you serious?

05:03:04.340 --> 05:03:05.340
I can't.

05:03:05.340 --> 05:03:06.340
Raina, please.

05:03:25.340 --> 05:03:29.340
Raina,INA!

05:03:39.340 --> 05:03:42.340
Raina, space, sleep.

05:03:42.340 --> 05:03:55.540
All right, here I was locked on.

05:03:55.540 --> 05:03:58.340
Okay, arena sweep.

05:03:58.340 --> 05:04:02.680
Why could I lock on?

05:04:02.680 --> 05:04:03.680
Hello?

05:04:03.680 --> 05:04:04.680
Oh.

05:04:04.680 --> 05:04:05.680
Whoo!

05:04:05.680 --> 05:04:06.680
Oh.

05:04:06.680 --> 05:04:07.480
Hello?

05:04:07.480 --> 05:04:10.480
Oh.

05:04:10.480 --> 05:04:11.480
Woo-hoo!

05:04:11.480 --> 05:04:13.980
Ow.

05:04:13.980 --> 05:04:16.480
Get him!

05:04:16.480 --> 05:04:18.480
Get him!

05:04:18.480 --> 05:04:21.480
Sick of him!

05:04:21.480 --> 05:04:23.980
I'm going to die.

05:04:23.980 --> 05:04:24.480
Get him!

05:04:27.880 --> 05:04:29.280
Actually, you know what I should do?

05:04:29.280 --> 05:04:33.680
I should actually be using a two-handed morning star.

05:04:33.680 --> 05:04:36.680
Cuz...

05:04:36.680 --> 05:04:38.180
I don't know, he's dead.

05:04:38.180 --> 05:04:39.680
He's only going to do the bleed.

05:04:39.680 --> 05:04:43.680
Nope, I didn't mean to do that.

05:04:43.680 --> 05:04:45.680
Peace.

05:04:55.180 --> 05:04:57.180
This is why bleed is good.

05:04:58.180 --> 05:05:01.180
Ow.

05:05:01.180 --> 05:05:02.180
That was very nice.

05:05:02.180 --> 05:05:04.180
That was very cash money in here.

05:05:07.180 --> 05:05:08.180
Ow, Jesus.

05:05:08.180 --> 05:05:09.180
Fuck.

05:05:14.180 --> 05:05:16.180
What was that?

05:05:16.180 --> 05:05:20.180
I see a little boost on that thing.

05:05:20.180 --> 05:05:21.180
I use a sword.

05:05:21.180 --> 05:05:22.180
You're a lizard.

05:05:22.180 --> 05:05:24.180
You don't deserve a sword.

05:05:28.180 --> 05:05:30.180
Ow!

05:05:35.180 --> 05:05:37.180
Yeah, not even like a third.

05:05:37.180 --> 05:05:39.180
Done.

05:05:47.180 --> 05:05:50.180
You're not even like near the lava, I don't know what you're saying.

05:05:50.180 --> 05:05:52.180
Wait, huh?

05:05:53.180 --> 05:05:58.180
Oh, he just a little stompy-stomp.

05:06:03.180 --> 05:06:05.180
And I guess so many attempts this will take.

05:06:05.180 --> 05:06:10.180
Jesus Christ, you guys think this will take 30 attempts for me?

05:06:10.180 --> 05:06:12.180
Oh my God.

05:06:12.180 --> 05:06:14.180
You're probably right.

05:06:15.180 --> 05:06:17.180
Um...

05:06:21.180 --> 05:06:23.180
Oh, I had to press this.

05:06:23.180 --> 05:06:25.180
Get him.

05:06:43.180 --> 05:06:46.180
No, Jellyfish, get out the way.

05:06:49.180 --> 05:06:52.180
How did he already fucking kill him with one hit?

05:06:52.180 --> 05:06:54.180
That's not nice.

05:06:54.180 --> 05:06:56.180
That's not fair to him.

05:06:56.180 --> 05:06:58.180
I don't know.

05:07:10.180 --> 05:07:13.180
I'm just going in a circle.

05:07:13.180 --> 05:07:15.180
There's a wall there, baby.

05:07:17.180 --> 05:07:21.180
Oh, well, sometimes the camera law fucks me.

05:07:26.180 --> 05:07:28.180
He's going to stop around in there, then?

05:07:28.180 --> 05:07:30.180
Oh, bro.

05:07:30.180 --> 05:07:32.180
They're just gathered, bro.

05:07:33.180 --> 05:07:34.180
I'm going to die.

05:07:34.180 --> 05:07:36.180
I'm stuck in lava.

05:07:37.180 --> 05:07:38.180
Come on.

05:07:38.180 --> 05:07:40.180
I can't tell what's happening.

05:07:45.180 --> 05:07:47.180
Ranged Magic is king.

05:07:47.180 --> 05:07:50.180
Amazing that my Glenstone did like fucking nothing.

05:07:51.180 --> 05:07:53.180
Does...

05:07:55.180 --> 05:07:57.180
Let me just...

05:07:58.180 --> 05:08:00.180
I'll try it, but I don't...

05:08:00.180 --> 05:08:02.180
I wasn't really doing anything to him.

05:08:06.180 --> 05:08:08.180
I wanted to do the bleed,

05:08:08.180 --> 05:08:12.180
because then I would get at least a little bit of bleed damage every so hits.

05:08:20.180 --> 05:08:22.180
Okay.

05:08:41.180 --> 05:08:43.180
Wow, this is doing so much damage.

05:08:44.180 --> 05:08:46.180
I'm so talented.

05:08:47.180 --> 05:08:48.180
I...

05:08:48.180 --> 05:08:50.180
I don't even...

05:08:54.180 --> 05:08:56.180
Lava boy over here.

05:08:57.180 --> 05:08:58.180
Lava girl.

05:08:58.180 --> 05:09:00.180
I'm only a lava boy.

05:09:05.180 --> 05:09:07.180
I actually don't think I might lock on,

05:09:07.180 --> 05:09:11.180
because I'm just getting stuck with the fucking camera.

05:09:13.180 --> 05:09:14.180
Alright, you're cheeky.

05:09:14.180 --> 05:09:15.180
Alright, you're fucking cheeky.

05:09:15.180 --> 05:09:17.180
I need to heal.

05:09:19.180 --> 05:09:20.180
Okay.

05:09:27.180 --> 05:09:29.180
Give me your ass.

05:09:34.180 --> 05:09:35.180
Oh, why?

05:09:35.180 --> 05:09:37.180
Why, cats?

05:09:37.180 --> 05:09:38.180
Why?

05:09:38.180 --> 05:09:39.180
I'm going to...

05:09:39.180 --> 05:09:40.180
Oh my fucking god, Vini.

05:09:40.180 --> 05:09:41.180
I swear to fucking god.

05:09:41.180 --> 05:09:43.180
Get out of the fucking way.

05:09:45.180 --> 05:09:47.180
I was doing better.

05:09:48.180 --> 05:09:49.180
Why?

05:09:49.180 --> 05:09:50.180
Why did you do that?

05:09:50.180 --> 05:09:51.180
Why are you so cute?

05:09:51.180 --> 05:09:52.180
I love you.

05:09:53.180 --> 05:09:54.180
You smell like food.

05:09:54.180 --> 05:09:55.180
Did you just eat?

05:09:58.180 --> 05:09:59.180
Cat debuff might be a factor.

05:09:59.180 --> 05:10:03.180
Yes, because my cats like to hop up on my desk

05:10:04.180 --> 05:10:06.180
and get in front of my display.

05:10:06.180 --> 05:10:07.180
Zzz.

05:10:08.180 --> 05:10:10.180
And now Boomi's about to take a shit.

05:10:12.180 --> 05:10:13.180
They hate me.

05:10:13.180 --> 05:10:14.180
My cats hate me.

05:10:19.180 --> 05:10:20.180
Um, yeah, no.

05:10:20.180 --> 05:10:22.180
Fuck the fucking glint stone.

05:10:22.180 --> 05:10:24.180
No, that's not going to work out.

05:10:24.180 --> 05:10:26.180
I don't know why I sat down, but it's fine.

05:10:26.180 --> 05:10:27.180
Boomi, stop sending me my feet.

05:10:27.180 --> 05:10:28.180
It's unnecessary.

05:10:29.180 --> 05:10:30.180
Stop, bro.

05:10:30.180 --> 05:10:31.180
Stop, stop.

05:10:31.180 --> 05:10:33.180
Can you leave my feet alone?

05:10:33.180 --> 05:10:34.180
Can you leave that alone?

05:10:34.180 --> 05:10:35.180
Thank you.

05:10:35.180 --> 05:10:36.180
My brother in Christ.

05:10:36.180 --> 05:10:37.180
My brother in Christ.

05:10:38.180 --> 05:10:39.180
Please.

05:10:41.180 --> 05:10:42.180
Hi, Fiya.

05:10:43.180 --> 05:10:44.180
Hi, little girl.

05:10:45.180 --> 05:10:47.180
You look so cute over there.

05:10:47.180 --> 05:10:50.180
I can't look out from you because you're behaving.

05:10:51.180 --> 05:10:53.180
What are you going to go ahead for?

05:10:54.180 --> 05:10:56.180
Are you going to stick yourself to my chair again?

05:10:59.180 --> 05:11:00.180
Feetsies.

05:11:00.180 --> 05:11:01.180
Fiya really likes feetsies.

05:11:01.180 --> 05:11:02.180
Sometimes I call her Fida.

05:11:02.180 --> 05:11:04.180
She likes fart.

05:11:14.180 --> 05:11:16.180
I'm ready to fuck people up.

05:11:16.180 --> 05:11:17.180
Ah.

05:11:18.180 --> 05:11:20.180
Justice for Boomi.

05:11:20.180 --> 05:11:22.180
I'm going the wrong way.

05:11:29.180 --> 05:11:31.180
Okay, he doesn't seem to care.

05:11:31.180 --> 05:11:32.180
Sorry.

05:11:32.180 --> 05:11:48.180
I think the wolves will actually be a little bit easier because I feel like they can move

05:11:48.180 --> 05:11:50.180
around a lot faster.

05:11:50.180 --> 05:12:19.180
I don't know what I got in my eye yesterday, but I think I cut the inside of my eyelid.

05:12:19.180 --> 05:12:21.180
And it is so painful.

05:12:21.180 --> 05:12:23.180
Or I got bleach in my eye because I was cleaning stuff.

05:12:23.180 --> 05:12:24.180
So who knows?

05:12:24.180 --> 05:12:25.180
I don't know.

05:12:26.180 --> 05:12:28.180
I don't know if bleach does that.

05:12:29.180 --> 05:12:31.180
It really hurt when I tried to wash it out.

05:12:36.180 --> 05:12:38.180
I'm going to kill my fillet just right off the rip, bro.

05:12:42.180 --> 05:12:44.180
You're going to kill me right off the rip, bro.

05:12:45.180 --> 05:12:46.180
I can't see.

05:12:47.180 --> 05:12:48.180
I can't see.

05:12:49.180 --> 05:12:50.180
I can't see.

05:12:51.180 --> 05:12:52.180
I can't see.

05:12:53.180 --> 05:12:54.180
I can't see.

05:12:54.180 --> 05:12:56.180
The room is so small.

05:12:57.180 --> 05:12:59.180
This might take more than 30 tries, boys.

05:13:02.180 --> 05:13:03.180
My eye's fine.

05:13:03.180 --> 05:13:04.180
I can see out of it.

05:13:04.180 --> 05:13:05.180
It just hurts.

05:13:05.180 --> 05:13:11.180
And then I flipped my eyelid inside out and it was super fucking red because it felt like

05:13:11.180 --> 05:13:13.180
I had a cut in there.

05:13:13.180 --> 05:13:17.180
I'm like, did a fucking eyelash slice me and got in my eye or whatever?

05:13:17.180 --> 05:13:18.180
I don't...

05:13:18.180 --> 05:13:21.180
Okay, I'm going to try it with the wolves instead.

05:13:27.180 --> 05:13:31.180
Because I think with the wolves, they'll be able to run around and kind of...

05:13:35.180 --> 05:13:36.180
Let's try it.

05:13:44.180 --> 05:13:45.180
Open the room.

05:13:52.180 --> 05:13:53.180
Dumbass dogs.

05:13:53.180 --> 05:13:56.180
Why are you going in the fucking lava?

05:14:14.180 --> 05:14:16.180
I don't think I was healing when that happened.

05:14:19.180 --> 05:14:21.180
I don't think I was healing when that happened.

05:14:24.180 --> 05:14:25.180
Haha!

05:14:27.180 --> 05:14:28.180
On guard.

05:14:28.180 --> 05:14:29.180
Chicken.

05:14:31.180 --> 05:14:32.180
Go on.

05:14:36.180 --> 05:14:37.180
Uh, guys...

05:14:37.180 --> 05:14:39.180
I don't know if I'm going to get this.

05:14:44.180 --> 05:14:49.180
It's hot in the fucking camera.

05:14:54.180 --> 05:14:55.180
I don't know.

05:15:02.180 --> 05:15:03.180
I know!

05:15:03.180 --> 05:15:05.180
Alzeir just hears me dying in the next room.

05:15:05.180 --> 05:15:07.180
He's like, I'll see you there!

05:15:07.180 --> 05:15:09.180
I'll see you at the festival!

05:15:09.180 --> 05:15:12.180
And then just fucking perish in the next room 50 times.

05:15:12.180 --> 05:15:16.180
You'd also think like he'd be gone, like once you...

05:15:16.180 --> 05:15:18.180
Like, I don't get that.

05:15:21.180 --> 05:15:24.180
I don't know why this bleed isn't fucking working right now.

05:15:24.180 --> 05:15:26.180
Is the worm resistant to bleed?

05:15:35.180 --> 05:15:36.180
What the fuck?

05:15:36.180 --> 05:15:38.180
I swear my hip-hop isn't that big.

05:15:38.180 --> 05:15:40.180
It doesn't matter anymore.

05:15:42.180 --> 05:15:43.180
I'm still alive?!

05:15:44.180 --> 05:15:45.180
What?!

05:15:47.180 --> 05:15:48.180
I thought I was dead!

05:15:48.180 --> 05:15:50.180
I just, like, stopped moving!

05:15:51.180 --> 05:15:52.180
Okay, fuck the camera.

05:15:54.180 --> 05:15:55.180
Fuck the cameras.

05:15:56.180 --> 05:15:57.180
Cut the cameras!

05:15:59.180 --> 05:16:00.180
I can't even hit you.

05:16:01.180 --> 05:16:02.180
I can't even hit you.

05:16:08.180 --> 05:16:09.180
No!

05:16:17.180 --> 05:16:20.180
Oh, I tried to roll out of the way, but I wasn't close enough.

05:16:20.180 --> 05:16:22.180
I don't worry, Mr. Baby Dragon.

05:16:26.180 --> 05:16:28.180
If you take too long, we'll break between the hits.

05:16:28.180 --> 05:16:30.180
Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

05:16:31.180 --> 05:16:32.180
You are right.

05:16:33.180 --> 05:16:34.180
That would be correct.

05:16:48.180 --> 05:16:49.180
How far did I get first play through?

05:16:49.180 --> 05:16:50.180
I won!

05:16:50.180 --> 05:16:52.180
I beat the game!

05:16:52.180 --> 05:16:53.180
I got the frenzy flame ending!

05:16:58.180 --> 05:16:59.180
I'm sorry.

05:17:03.180 --> 05:17:04.180
But thank you for the tip.

05:17:06.180 --> 05:17:07.180
I know, I got distracted.

05:17:12.180 --> 05:17:13.180
Oh, no!

05:17:14.180 --> 05:17:15.180
No, my butt!

05:17:24.180 --> 05:17:25.180
It's got a headache from that.

05:17:29.180 --> 05:17:32.180
You know, for the longest time,

05:17:33.180 --> 05:17:36.180
I didn't know Blive had, like, an actual wolf head.

05:17:41.180 --> 05:17:42.180
I thought...

05:17:45.180 --> 05:17:48.180
I thought I was just wearing a mask the entire time.

05:17:59.180 --> 05:18:00.180
I am...

05:18:01.180 --> 05:18:03.180
getting out of the fucking way and it's not working.

05:18:05.180 --> 05:18:07.180
I got all the damage I did with my Blive, Blive.

05:18:08.180 --> 05:18:09.180
Like that.

05:18:14.180 --> 05:18:15.180
Whee!

05:18:15.180 --> 05:18:16.180
Oh, you like that?

05:18:16.180 --> 05:18:18.180
Right in the fucking eye, suck it in it.

05:18:23.180 --> 05:18:24.180
I'll leave you with a kiss.

05:18:24.180 --> 05:18:25.180
Yeah, you get that.

05:18:28.180 --> 05:18:29.180
I'll leave you with a kiss.

05:18:34.180 --> 05:18:38.180
This sheebie Muppet needs to violently shake when speaking.

05:18:40.180 --> 05:18:41.180
Wait, hold up.

05:18:41.180 --> 05:18:42.180
I got you.

05:18:45.180 --> 05:18:46.180
Hi, I'm Sheebie.

05:18:46.180 --> 05:18:47.180
What's up?

05:18:47.180 --> 05:18:48.180
I'm a Muppet.

05:18:49.180 --> 05:18:50.180
Fuck your mom.

05:18:59.180 --> 05:19:00.180
Um...

05:19:01.180 --> 05:19:02.180
Tomo is...

05:19:02.180 --> 05:19:04.180
We're gonna make me, like, my arms move, too.

05:19:05.180 --> 05:19:06.180
Like, that I, like, shrug my arms.

05:19:08.180 --> 05:19:09.180
What the fuck?

05:19:09.180 --> 05:19:10.180
That noise.

05:19:12.180 --> 05:19:13.180
Oh, it's just sleeping.

05:19:13.180 --> 05:19:15.180
That's why it's making a lot of sleeping noise.

05:19:15.180 --> 05:19:16.180
And it just wasn't working out.

05:19:17.180 --> 05:19:18.180
And I thought it wasn't working out,

05:19:18.180 --> 05:19:20.180
so she had already drawn on the layer,

05:19:20.180 --> 05:19:21.180
and she was like, ah fuck,

05:19:21.180 --> 05:19:22.180
and I was like, oh, it's fine.

05:19:25.180 --> 05:19:27.180
Like, I just, like, ring a box.

05:19:27.180 --> 05:19:29.180
Sick' cm, boys.

05:19:29.180 --> 05:19:30.180
Sick' mm.

05:19:30.180 --> 05:19:31.180
Get his ass!

05:19:31.180 --> 05:19:32.180
Got his ass!

05:19:32.180 --> 05:19:33.180
Get his ass!

05:19:33.180 --> 05:19:34.180
Yeah!

05:19:34.180 --> 05:19:35.180
Fuck' em up!

05:19:38.180 --> 05:19:39.180
I hit his belly.

05:19:39.180 --> 05:19:40.180
I hit his belly.

05:19:42.180 --> 05:19:43.180
Fuck' em up, fuck' em up!

05:19:43.180 --> 05:19:44.180
I'm staying solid...

05:19:44.180 --> 05:19:45.180
I'm staying solid.

05:19:45.180 --> 05:19:46.180
I'm solid.

05:19:47.180 --> 05:19:48.180
Get out of the way...

05:19:48.180 --> 05:19:49.180
Get out of the way.

05:19:49.180 --> 05:19:50.180
Get out of the way...

05:19:50.180 --> 05:19:51.180
Out of the way...

05:19:52.180 --> 05:19:54.180
Out of the way, I'm dead.

05:19:54.180 --> 05:19:55.180
It's fine.

05:19:55.180 --> 05:19:56.180
It's fine.

05:19:56.180 --> 05:19:57.080
We're good.

05:19:57.080 --> 05:19:58.720
the fourth of the way there.

05:19:58.720 --> 05:19:59.560
Maybe a fifth?

05:20:01.080 --> 05:20:01.920
Maybe a fifth?

05:20:01.920 --> 05:20:03.920
That was pretty cool.

05:20:03.920 --> 05:20:04.760
You so cute and funny.

05:20:04.760 --> 05:20:07.080
You think I'm cute and funny?

05:20:07.080 --> 05:20:10.360
Yeah, that's so nice of you.

05:20:10.360 --> 05:20:11.200
Oh my God.

05:20:12.480 --> 05:20:14.480
He thinks I'm cute and funny.

05:20:15.720 --> 05:20:17.960
I don't know why I have a valid girl accent

05:20:17.960 --> 05:20:19.400
when I'm talking like this.

05:20:19.400 --> 05:20:22.000
This isn't even my cute and funny voice, is it?

05:20:22.000 --> 05:20:23.960
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:20:23.960 --> 05:20:24.800
Um.

Hmm.

05:20:30.000 --> 05:20:30.840
Hmm.

05:20:32.960 --> 05:20:34.440
Hmm.

05:20:34.440 --> 05:20:35.280
Ha.

05:20:37.080 --> 05:20:37.920
Hmm.

05:20:40.560 --> 05:20:42.960
There must be a better way.

05:20:42.960 --> 05:20:45.360
I know I can beat this demon.

05:20:45.360 --> 05:20:47.400
I just have to believe in myself.

05:20:50.680 --> 05:20:51.520
Oh, fuck it.

05:20:52.520 --> 05:20:53.520
Fuck it.

05:20:53.520 --> 05:20:54.520

05:20:59.520 --> 05:21:00.520
Fuck it.

05:21:00.520 --> 05:21:01.520
He sounded like God Earth.

05:21:17.520 --> 05:21:18.520
Ow.

05:21:21.520 --> 05:21:22.520

05:21:27.520 --> 05:21:29.520
Oh, fuck him out.

05:21:33.520 --> 05:21:35.520
Don't roll into the fucking lava, Shibi.

05:21:35.520 --> 05:21:37.520
Don't roll into the fucking lava.

05:21:37.520 --> 05:21:39.520
Oh my God, please.

05:21:39.520 --> 05:21:40.520
Oh my God, please.

05:21:40.520 --> 05:21:41.520
Oh my God, no.

05:21:41.520 --> 05:21:43.520
You have me in a fucking corner, bro.

05:21:43.520 --> 05:21:44.520
Oh, fuck your mother.

05:21:44.520 --> 05:21:45.520
Fuck your mother so hard.

05:21:45.520 --> 05:21:46.520
I hate it here.

05:21:46.520 --> 05:21:47.520
I hate it here.

05:21:48.520 --> 05:21:49.520
I hate it here.

05:21:52.520 --> 05:21:54.520
Darn stream for Magma Worm.

05:21:59.520 --> 05:22:01.520
I think I need a snacky.

05:22:01.520 --> 05:22:02.520
What is this?

05:22:02.520 --> 05:22:03.520
I don't even know what this is.

05:22:03.520 --> 05:22:05.520
Adorable cracker.

05:22:05.520 --> 05:22:07.520
That's what it says.

05:22:07.520 --> 05:22:10.520
That's what my mom called me when I was younger.

05:22:10.520 --> 05:22:11.520
Okay.

05:22:13.520 --> 05:22:14.520
He smells so bad.

05:22:14.520 --> 05:22:15.520
I'm not eating this.

05:22:15.520 --> 05:22:16.520
Nevermind.

05:22:17.520 --> 05:22:19.520
That smells horrible.

05:22:19.520 --> 05:22:20.520
What is this?

05:22:20.520 --> 05:22:22.520
Another fucking butter cookie?

05:22:22.520 --> 05:22:24.520
Oh, it's a rice cookie, I think.

05:22:30.520 --> 05:22:31.520
Rice cracker.

05:22:35.520 --> 05:22:36.520
Yup.

05:22:39.520 --> 05:22:40.520
That's a rice cracker.

05:22:49.520 --> 05:22:56.520
I don't think I like the taste of that.

05:22:56.520 --> 05:23:05.520
They sound like God or some sort of neutron when they barf.

05:23:05.520 --> 05:23:15.520
Get up puppies.

05:23:15.520 --> 05:23:20.520
Get up puppies.

05:23:20.520 --> 05:23:21.520
No.

05:23:21.520 --> 05:23:22.520
No.

05:23:22.520 --> 05:23:27.520
Guys, I don't think I want to be the...

05:23:27.520 --> 05:23:33.520
Guys, I don't think I want to be the...

05:23:33.520 --> 05:23:35.520
Guys, I don't think I want to read them.

05:23:43.920 --> 05:23:45.920
I'm gonna be here a bit.

05:23:47.240 --> 05:23:49.240
Move up.

05:23:49.520 --> 05:23:51.520
I'm gonna help her.

05:23:55.640 --> 05:23:57.640
I hate that you look like you're made of shit.

05:24:04.400 --> 05:24:08.400
At least get to the 30 for the bet.

05:24:22.000 --> 05:24:25.000
Bring the tummy, bring the tummy, bring the tummy, hold on.

05:24:28.000 --> 05:24:30.000
Get him, don't get him.

05:24:33.520 --> 05:24:35.520
Mmmmm!

05:24:39.520 --> 05:24:41.520
Your beans wouldn't be so much better.

05:24:41.520 --> 05:24:43.520
Why am I doing this?

05:24:43.520 --> 05:24:45.520

I am a gamer, but I am not a good gamer.

05:32:34.480 --> 05:33:00.480
You are my candy, and I'm stuck on the camera lock.

05:33:00.480 --> 05:33:10.480

The restaurant was good, the couple runs ago was good.

I know jellyfish did take that entire fucking hit, he's just like, I'll eat this.

05:36:48.440 --> 05:36:50.440

Oh, it's like hair. What's up with that? Why do you have hair on the edge of your sword?

05:40:55.480 --> 05:40:58.920
Why does a giant lizard have a sword in the first place? How did you get the sword?

05:40:59.160 --> 05:41:03.400
Who made you the sword? It looks like it was made of the tail of your brethren. I don't know if I like that

05:41:03.680 --> 05:41:06.640
You know, I don't if I like that. That's kind of fucked up

05:41:16.440 --> 05:41:21.840
You're the dragon you're right you're right. All right, I'm gonna beat the first attack

05:41:33.400 --> 05:41:35.400
I

05:41:40.920 --> 05:41:42.920
Needling

05:41:45.480 --> 05:41:49.440
Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's ass

05:41:49.440 --> 05:41:51.440
Yes

05:42:08.080 --> 05:42:10.920
That's they run the front

05:42:19.560 --> 05:42:22.880
We're going away how did that hit me

05:42:28.200 --> 05:42:30.200
Jump

05:42:32.800 --> 05:42:34.800
We poke his ass

05:42:35.000 --> 05:42:37.000
other ass

05:42:39.000 --> 05:42:41.000
Let me die

05:42:45.560 --> 05:42:47.560
What the hell bro

05:42:48.560 --> 05:42:50.560
Kind of like give me a one hit

05:42:52.320 --> 05:42:54.880
That's fine, that's fine. Let me wipe my hands

05:42:59.600 --> 05:43:03.800
Fuck you Alexander. Yeah, fuck you. You know, you know

05:43:07.600 --> 05:43:12.280
Wondering if I should go back for the blood blood thing

05:43:17.560 --> 05:43:19.560
I

05:43:38.960 --> 05:43:40.960
Mean I was hoping you wouldn't notice me

05:43:41.080 --> 05:43:43.080
I

05:43:45.920 --> 05:43:51.560
Keep rolling rolling rolling walking rollin rollin rollin rollin come on

05:44:03.800 --> 05:44:05.800
Get out of the way

05:44:10.960 --> 05:44:12.960
I

05:44:40.960 --> 05:44:42.960
I

05:45:10.960 --> 05:45:12.960
I

05:45:13.560 --> 05:45:15.560
I

05:45:40.280 --> 05:45:42.280
Amazing actually I just but like

05:45:42.960 --> 05:45:50.880
like 50 different bosses. I already beat the game twice. We're on New Game Plus 3 right now.

05:45:52.080 --> 05:45:58.880
It's pretty sick. It's pretty awesome. Everybody's kind of amazed by my skills.

05:45:58.880 --> 05:46:10.560
Oh, no. Jellyfish.

05:46:10.560 --> 05:46:27.440
Oh, I'm killing my jellyfish too soon because when the jellyfish gets back into the corner,

05:46:27.440 --> 05:46:39.440
I'm fucked. I'm dead. I don't know what number are we at. I don't know if I should even bother

05:46:39.440 --> 05:46:47.920
with this anymore. Like I'm determined to, but I just don't think realistically I'm not high enough

05:46:47.920 --> 05:46:55.120
level and I'm not enough skilled even if I was this level.

05:47:39.440 --> 05:48:03.120
Oh, no. Why does he always attack when I summon him?

05:48:10.000 --> 05:48:18.480
Because I need him to stack the lava. I don't want him to go back into the corner.

05:48:19.760 --> 05:48:21.520
I mean, I'll stack the lava, stack the poison.

05:48:24.720 --> 05:48:29.760
When can you fucking jump like that? I have not seen you do this fucking move, bitch.

05:48:29.760 --> 05:48:41.440
You four? How dare you?

05:48:41.440 --> 05:49:07.120
You don't get to whip around like that.

05:49:12.320 --> 05:49:17.120
I can't use that pretty much either.

05:49:27.120 --> 05:49:35.120
You done yet?

05:49:35.600 --> 05:49:40.800
Come on, bro. You're not just killing me.

05:49:40.800 --> 05:49:46.800
This is not a good run. I'm pressing the, like, oh.

05:49:49.520 --> 05:49:54.800
Why don't you let me do a paneling for us?

05:49:55.440 --> 05:50:00.960
Or do you be a dagger to help with the damage? Maybe.

05:50:03.840 --> 05:50:04.960
I'm kind of determined.

05:50:05.760 --> 05:50:13.760
Downloading the move set. Locking in.

05:50:29.200 --> 05:50:31.840
It's all right. Back it up. Back it up.

05:50:31.840 --> 05:50:37.040
Get up. Jump. Jump. Get out of here. Back up. Back up. Pull it back. It's fine.

05:50:37.040 --> 05:50:39.280
We're good. Do a little ding-ling.

05:50:47.120 --> 05:50:48.480
Yes. Yes.

05:50:51.520 --> 05:50:51.920
It's all right.

05:50:54.400 --> 05:50:56.560
Isn't there like supposed to be like a super thing I can do?

05:50:58.080 --> 05:51:01.280
Like in his eye? I did try like that so many times.

05:51:02.160 --> 05:51:05.680
I totally fucking jumped over that.

05:51:09.520 --> 05:51:13.360
What? What? What, bitch? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do, bitch?

05:51:14.240 --> 05:51:31.680
You're fucking the ass again. You're fucking the ass again.

05:51:32.080 --> 05:51:43.680
Leave my jellyfish alone. He's just a little boy. My voice is cracking.

05:51:43.680 --> 05:52:03.520
I'm in the eye. I gotta hit the glowy eye. I'm trying to hit the glowy eye.

05:52:09.040 --> 05:52:11.520
I'm trying to. Oh no, you took him out.

05:52:14.400 --> 05:52:25.520
No.

05:52:30.560 --> 05:52:31.520
Oh, no.

05:52:32.720 --> 05:52:41.520
All the wrong direction.

05:52:43.680 --> 05:53:03.520
I'm trying to get him to charge.

05:53:06.080 --> 05:53:11.520
What? He didn't even hit me with anything. He just walked up to me and I was supposed to hurt me.

05:53:13.680 --> 05:53:25.520
Oh my god, I pressed the wrong button.

05:53:25.520 --> 05:53:39.360
I don't remember what I just want to even have a quick blast.

05:53:48.240 --> 05:53:52.560
No, no, no. I was hoping. Oh no, I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

05:53:56.480 --> 05:54:04.720
Oh, the poison was doing work. The poison is doing work. It's but it's fine.

05:54:05.760 --> 05:54:11.360
The more the closer and the closer I get to know I can do it just by brute forcing it.

05:54:14.240 --> 05:54:17.920
Okay, but first, how the fuck do I poke him in the eye to get the extra damage?

05:54:18.480 --> 05:54:27.040
I'm doing the charged heavy attack. It's not doing anything. I'm doing left trigger.

05:54:28.160 --> 05:54:29.280
I have to light attack him.

05:54:35.040 --> 05:54:38.720
Okay, I have to let R1 no charge.

05:54:39.040 --> 05:54:49.520
Okay, okay, I'm okay. And I was screwed myself over by that because I didn't just not fucking paying attention.

05:54:52.880 --> 05:54:54.720
I'm gonna do this right off the back early pop.

05:54:55.680 --> 05:54:57.840
Oh, we got out of the way first.

05:55:03.680 --> 05:55:05.840
Damn.

05:55:05.840 --> 05:55:22.960
Did he already kill him? How the fuck?

05:55:26.560 --> 05:55:28.960
I dodged that. Okay.

05:55:36.640 --> 05:55:40.960
Yeah.

05:55:45.600 --> 05:55:48.960
That doesn't even do a lot.

05:55:54.480 --> 05:55:58.960
Oh, okay.

05:55:58.960 --> 05:56:06.320
I have a little temper tantrum over here, bud.

05:56:08.640 --> 05:56:14.000
Here, spin around. Oh, yeah, I saw that coming. I saw that spin coming.

05:56:17.280 --> 05:56:24.160
I love a forgetful madam. That was better, though. If I can keep jellyfish alive to get that poison,

05:56:24.880 --> 05:56:32.800
um, that I think I think I'm good. I think I'm good. I don't know how he died so fast.

05:56:38.320 --> 05:56:45.200
If I get up real close to him, right off the river. No. No, be free.

05:56:48.880 --> 05:56:49.840
I ate that for you.

05:56:49.840 --> 05:56:55.600
Why are you throwing it at your time?

05:56:59.680 --> 05:57:04.560
I can't really tell what's going on here. I don't know how to approach this situation.

05:57:04.560 --> 05:57:09.760
I kind of, he's already fucking, he's doing this too fast.

05:57:11.920 --> 05:57:17.280
Like, I'm kind of confused. He's like doing the magma thing a little bit too fast right off the rip.

05:57:17.280 --> 05:57:19.280
And when he does that, it's a bad run.

05:57:22.480 --> 05:57:26.960
You know? What the fuck am I kicking? Where did my fucking thing go?

05:57:28.000 --> 05:57:33.120
I'm fucking kicking his ass. Fuckin' punch you. Fuckin' duff your ass. Fuckin' fuck you.

05:57:35.200 --> 05:57:37.920
Yeah, why is he spamming lava? I don't know if that's fair to you yet.

05:57:39.360 --> 05:57:40.640
Uh, well, no, I just started.

05:57:41.600 --> 05:57:48.480
I'm getting warm. I'm like cold and warm at the same time.

05:57:50.800 --> 05:57:56.720
Fuck you. Fuck you for that. Yeah, she could be helping me. Could be helping me, but no.

05:58:02.320 --> 05:58:05.840
Okay, I'm gonna bait him. I'm gonna bait him. I'm gonna masturbate him. I'm gonna masturbate his ass.

05:58:06.800 --> 05:58:13.120
No. No, you're supposed to attack me, you fuck. Get his ass. Get his ass.

05:58:16.160 --> 05:58:19.520
Oh, no. I'm on fire. I'm on fire.

05:58:26.080 --> 05:58:26.580
Okay.

05:58:27.140 --> 05:58:27.640
Go.

05:58:30.420 --> 05:58:32.340
I definitely dodge that, but go off this.

05:58:36.100 --> 05:58:42.340
Stab his ass. Stab his ass. Stab his ass. Get stabbed. Die.

05:58:42.340 --> 05:59:10.340
Alright, press a normal button.

05:59:10.340 --> 05:59:11.340
There we go, there's that poison buildup.

05:59:11.340 --> 05:59:34.340
He did well, he did well.

05:59:34.340 --> 05:59:45.340
Fuck, I'm stuck, I'm rolling for all my life.

05:59:46.340 --> 06:00:00.340
Stop, are you gonna stop?

06:00:00.340 --> 06:00:11.340
I'm gonna raise up.

06:00:11.340 --> 06:00:31.340
I can't let Jellyfish have that defeat.

06:00:31.340 --> 06:00:53.340
Where am I?

06:01:01.340 --> 06:01:27.340
Damn.

06:01:32.340 --> 06:01:36.340
Damn, that sucked.

06:01:36.340 --> 06:01:39.340
I thought that was a good run.

06:01:39.340 --> 06:01:41.340
That was good, I like that, I'm proud of myself.

06:01:41.340 --> 06:01:42.340
Thank you guys.

06:01:42.340 --> 06:01:46.340
Kinda looks like a bearded dragon with a sword, that's what everybody else was saying.

06:01:46.340 --> 06:02:13.340
How about you, I see my Jellyfish, he's really neat, he's just a little guy.

06:02:13.340 --> 06:02:19.340
Oh he's almost gonna be dead already, this is a bad run, I'm gonna kill myself.

06:02:19.340 --> 06:02:20.340
This is a bad run.

06:02:20.340 --> 06:02:28.340
The moment I know that he is too low health because this dude magma runs him into the fucking ground, it's not a good run.

06:02:28.340 --> 06:02:32.340
I need that poison to build and it's not building.

06:02:32.340 --> 06:02:38.340
If the poison builds and I get the combos, then yeah.

06:02:38.340 --> 06:02:43.340
It's gotta be 20, it probably is 20.

06:02:43.340 --> 06:02:46.340
I'm not gonna get it in 30, I'm not gonna get it in 30.

06:02:46.340 --> 06:02:54.340
I was pretty confident it was.

06:02:54.340 --> 06:02:57.340
Yeah, eyes on me buddy, eyes on me.

06:02:57.340 --> 06:03:00.340
Why do I have this equipped?

06:03:00.340 --> 06:03:01.340
Why?

06:03:01.340 --> 06:03:03.340
Give me the leg, that's what I wanted.

06:03:03.340 --> 06:03:09.340
Oh no, that's fine, that's fine.

06:03:09.340 --> 06:03:16.340
Jellyfish bro you gotta move, oh my god.

06:03:16.340 --> 06:03:28.340
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

06:03:28.340 --> 06:03:36.340
I legit almost just threw my controller there.

06:03:36.340 --> 06:03:41.340
That's what, I literally almost spiked my fucking controller at that one.

06:03:41.340 --> 06:03:48.340
Raina no.

06:03:48.340 --> 06:03:54.340
Raina mama's getting angry, she probably senses my anger, she's like I will calm you down.

06:03:54.340 --> 06:04:00.340
You're doing great sweetie, I'm determined.

06:04:00.340 --> 06:04:04.340
Taking off my fucking clothes, sweating.

06:04:04.340 --> 06:04:12.340
You're doing so well but I'm not, why are you guys lying to me?

06:04:12.340 --> 06:04:37.340
What the fuck, I didn't know there was lava there.

06:04:37.340 --> 06:04:57.340
You think cause it's floating that it wouldn't really be affected by this shit, but it does.

06:04:57.340 --> 06:05:12.340
You think that because it's floating the lava wouldn't really touch it, but it does.

06:05:13.340 --> 06:05:28.340
It killed me.

06:05:28.340 --> 06:05:40.340
I'm tempted to try to get the, I think I'm gonna try to get, actually no I'll stop trying

06:05:40.340 --> 06:05:42.340
then we can hit the third when we hit 30 else.

06:05:42.340 --> 06:05:58.340
I'll go and try to see if I get the Bloodhounds Fang so I can fuck this dude up so I can get the Moon Veal.

06:05:58.340 --> 06:06:03.340
See right off the rip I know it's a bad run when he does this immediately.

06:06:03.340 --> 06:06:06.340
I think it's because of my proximity to him.

06:06:06.340 --> 06:06:15.340
It triggers it.

06:06:15.340 --> 06:06:17.340
Why?

06:06:17.340 --> 06:06:18.340
Since when do you do that?

06:06:18.340 --> 06:06:31.340
You've done that twice and it doesn't make any sense to me.

06:06:31.340 --> 06:06:41.340
He's styling on me now.

06:06:41.340 --> 06:06:48.340
I know he's stuck his little sword in his mouth and was like, you bet he dooduh.

06:06:48.340 --> 06:06:50.340
Hello?

06:06:50.340 --> 06:06:54.340
We're both gonna eat that actually.

06:06:54.340 --> 06:06:55.340
I'm actually might gonna die.

06:06:55.340 --> 06:06:56.340
It's fine.

06:06:57.340 --> 06:06:59.340
It doesn't matter.

06:06:59.340 --> 06:07:05.340
I would have died anyways if I got the right one or not.

06:07:05.340 --> 06:07:09.340
Yeah, you get him Jellyfish.

06:07:09.340 --> 06:07:11.340
Nine damage.

06:07:11.340 --> 06:07:13.340
That's a lot of damage.

06:07:13.340 --> 06:07:14.340
We're getting there.

06:07:14.340 --> 06:07:16.340
I don't know about that.

06:07:16.340 --> 06:07:23.340
Sorry, I'm tired.

06:07:23.340 --> 06:07:29.340
I don't know, I had this fucking clip too.

06:07:29.340 --> 06:07:31.340
Immediately when I summon that he...

06:07:31.340 --> 06:07:32.340
Okay, good.

06:07:32.340 --> 06:07:33.340
That's fine.

06:07:33.340 --> 06:07:38.340
I would rather...

06:07:38.340 --> 06:07:40.340
No, don't kill him.

06:07:40.340 --> 06:07:41.340
Turn around.

06:07:41.340 --> 06:07:42.340
Turn around to me.

06:07:42.340 --> 06:07:44.340
Reina, this is not the time.

06:07:44.340 --> 06:07:47.340
I love you, but stop.

06:07:47.340 --> 06:07:50.340
Oh, there you go.

06:07:50.340 --> 06:07:53.340
You're gonna kill me here, Reina.

06:07:53.340 --> 06:07:59.340
I can't even see my stats.

06:07:59.340 --> 06:08:04.340
She's just rubbing against my plant.

06:08:04.340 --> 06:08:05.340
I don't know.

06:08:05.340 --> 06:08:06.340
Reina.

06:08:06.340 --> 06:08:09.340
Reina, please.

06:08:09.340 --> 06:08:11.340
I love you so much.

06:08:11.340 --> 06:08:13.340
No idea, but...

06:08:13.340 --> 06:08:15.340
I'm doing stuff right now.

06:08:15.340 --> 06:08:22.340
I snuggle with you all morning.

06:08:22.340 --> 06:08:23.340
What's up?

06:08:23.340 --> 06:08:27.340
You rumbling?

06:08:27.340 --> 06:08:31.340
Are you trying to calm me down because I'm getting aggravated?

06:08:31.340 --> 06:08:34.340
Are you trying to calm me, Reina?

06:08:34.340 --> 06:08:36.340
You sense my...

06:08:36.340 --> 06:08:41.340
You sense my stress.

06:08:41.340 --> 06:08:50.340
Sometimes you just need a cat hug.

06:08:50.340 --> 06:08:52.340
Reina actually is very much in tune to my emotions.

06:08:52.340 --> 06:08:56.340
If I am very upset, she will immediately...

06:08:56.340 --> 06:09:00.340
I think that's why she was kind of stuck to me this, like, yesterday.

06:09:00.340 --> 06:09:03.340
It's because, like, since I was sick, she was...

06:09:03.340 --> 06:09:10.340
I would, like, take a nap, and she was there, and I'd wake up, she was there.

06:09:10.340 --> 06:09:13.340
If I was doing anything, she would just be there.

06:09:13.340 --> 06:09:16.340
She's my baby girl.

06:09:16.340 --> 06:09:24.340
Okay.

06:09:24.340 --> 06:09:28.340
You wanna dance with the devil?

06:09:28.340 --> 06:09:31.340
Let's dance.

06:09:31.340 --> 06:09:39.340
What is this attack?

06:09:39.340 --> 06:09:42.340
He already killed my jellyfish.

06:09:42.340 --> 06:09:43.340
I should just leave.

06:09:43.340 --> 06:09:45.340
Can I leave? Can I go?

06:09:45.340 --> 06:09:49.340
We just...

06:09:49.340 --> 06:09:52.340
It's no fair.

06:09:52.340 --> 06:09:54.340
I don't like it here.

06:09:54.340 --> 06:09:57.340
Let me go through the pee fog.

06:09:57.340 --> 06:09:58.340
Reina, is your familiar?

06:09:58.340 --> 06:10:01.340
Oh, yes, of course.

06:10:01.340 --> 06:10:04.340
Actually, her sister was, like, my familiar.

06:10:04.340 --> 06:10:05.340
She'd always sit with me.

06:10:05.340 --> 06:10:09.340
Her sister, Solea, was sit with me when I would tear out cards.

06:10:09.340 --> 06:10:15.340
Her sister died, uh, about, like, three years ago?

06:10:15.340 --> 06:10:18.340
Yeah, four.

06:10:18.340 --> 06:10:20.340
Sweet. She was a seal point same as Cat.

06:10:20.340 --> 06:10:27.340
Her name was Solea. She was adorable.

06:10:27.340 --> 06:10:29.340
I liked her, because she was, like, Reina's, like, clearly my cat,

06:10:29.340 --> 06:10:34.340
but Solea was, like, everybody's cat in my family.

06:10:34.340 --> 06:10:48.340
Why am I not dancing?

06:10:48.340 --> 06:10:54.340
I'm, like, trying to get to its...

06:10:54.340 --> 06:10:57.340
Oh, the fire got me.

06:10:57.340 --> 06:11:02.340
It was actually going fine, because the jellyfish was doing okay.

06:11:02.340 --> 06:11:07.340
Might have been a good run if I didn't get knocked into the fire.

06:11:07.340 --> 06:11:09.340
There was a second Reina?

06:11:09.340 --> 06:11:11.340
Yeah, her sister.

06:11:11.340 --> 06:11:14.340
Her sister reminds me a lot of Fia and Boomi,

06:11:14.340 --> 06:11:21.340
and I like to think that she lives on in them with very similar personalities.

06:11:21.340 --> 06:11:24.340
It's quite funny.

06:11:24.340 --> 06:11:29.340
Okay, if I do him over here, he doesn't seem to get...

06:11:29.340 --> 06:11:40.340
I'm locked in.

06:11:40.340 --> 06:11:44.340
I don't know what you're spitting at, girl.

06:11:44.340 --> 06:11:46.340
Get out of the way, jellyfish.

06:11:46.340 --> 06:11:50.340
I don't know why you're standing there.

06:11:50.340 --> 06:11:52.340
Can you dodge, jellyfish?

06:11:52.340 --> 06:11:55.340
Oh, I can't hit. That's for sure.

06:11:55.340 --> 06:12:10.340
I rolled. I pressed roll, but I was locked in.

06:12:10.340 --> 06:12:23.340
I'm stabbing you, the gluay guy, sort of dog.

06:12:23.340 --> 06:12:36.340
That gives him a little bit of time to build that.

06:12:36.340 --> 06:12:39.340
Poisoned build, so we're fine.

06:12:39.340 --> 06:12:59.340
That's what I wanted. Maybe I should just pay back and let the poison build.

06:13:00.340 --> 06:13:02.340
He done? Like, what is...?

06:13:02.340 --> 06:13:04.340
Oh, my God.

06:13:29.340 --> 06:13:34.340
Computer is struggling right now.

06:13:34.340 --> 06:13:39.340
What is this? Why do you keep spamming the same fucking attack, dude?

06:13:39.340 --> 06:13:44.340
Oh, my God, I'm stuck.

06:13:44.340 --> 06:13:50.340
I don't understand that.

06:13:50.340 --> 06:14:05.340
I'm going to spam attack, you can spam attack, I want that.

06:14:05.340 --> 06:14:13.340
I'm going to attempt to just run in circles and let the fucking poison get him.

06:14:13.340 --> 06:14:26.340
Kind of wishing I had the dragon's breath.

06:14:26.340 --> 06:14:55.340
Sometimes it just locks onto his head and I'm kind of frustrated by that.

06:14:55.340 --> 06:14:57.340
Oh, my God.

06:15:25.340 --> 06:15:27.340
Locked in.

06:15:55.340 --> 06:15:57.340
Oh, my God.

06:16:25.340 --> 06:16:52.340
Oh, I thought I jumped out of the way.

06:16:52.340 --> 06:16:55.340
That's the fucking karma, dude.

06:16:55.340 --> 06:17:02.340
You see it messing up my attacks because I try to lock on, but it just...

06:17:02.340 --> 06:17:07.340
Yeah.

06:17:07.340 --> 06:17:10.340
I don't...

06:17:10.340 --> 06:17:12.340
It's so weird.

06:17:12.340 --> 06:17:14.340
I hate that I'm angled.

06:17:14.340 --> 06:17:17.340
I don't like that the point just always attacks his head.

06:17:17.340 --> 06:17:20.340
I'm trying to go for his leg and then it just pulls him.

06:17:20.340 --> 06:17:25.340
It pulls it and it makes it go for his head.

06:17:25.340 --> 06:17:31.340
Yeah, S-Talk has an issue.

06:17:31.340 --> 06:17:36.340
I never really use a piercing weapon for that reason.

06:17:36.340 --> 06:17:38.340
Come over here, come over here.

06:17:38.340 --> 06:17:40.340
No, no, no, no, no.

06:17:40.340 --> 06:17:42.340
You better come over fucking here, bro.

06:17:42.340 --> 06:17:44.340
You better fucking come over here.

06:18:13.340 --> 06:18:17.340
Great, how am I supposed to get to a fucking eye like this, huh?

06:18:17.340 --> 06:18:20.340
Oh, wow, that's fucking great, isn't it?

06:18:20.340 --> 06:18:22.340
I love that for me.

06:18:22.340 --> 06:18:34.340
I love that so much for me.

06:18:34.340 --> 06:18:37.340
Better do it again.

06:18:37.340 --> 06:18:44.340
I better fucking do it again, I swear to God.

06:18:44.340 --> 06:18:47.340
That's so dumb.

06:18:47.340 --> 06:18:49.340
That's so dumb.

06:18:49.340 --> 06:18:51.340
Did you see that?

06:18:51.340 --> 06:18:55.340
How the fuck am I supposed to get to the spot if it's the fucking flames right in the way, dude?

06:18:55.340 --> 06:18:58.340
Oh, my fucking god, bro.

06:18:58.340 --> 06:19:06.340
Holy shit.

06:19:06.340 --> 06:19:08.340
I'm enthusiastic, she viewers me.

06:19:08.340 --> 06:19:18.340
She's going to pull the fucking flames immediately, immediately, immediately when I summon.

06:19:18.340 --> 06:19:19.340
You hear this?

06:19:19.340 --> 06:19:24.340
It's me gripping the fucking of my controller right now.

06:19:24.340 --> 06:19:29.340
There's a muffin, it's really funny.

06:19:29.340 --> 06:19:30.340
I'm going to kill him for you.

06:19:30.340 --> 06:19:32.340
No, where's the fun in that?

06:19:32.340 --> 06:19:33.340
Where's the fun in that?

06:19:33.340 --> 06:19:36.340
I don't want anybody doing anything for me unless they ask.

06:19:36.340 --> 06:19:42.340
I want to do this for myself because I'm going to feel so fucking good, so full of dopamine after I finish this.

06:19:42.340 --> 06:19:44.340
Because I'm going to beat him.

06:19:44.340 --> 06:19:48.340
I'm going to beat him.

06:19:48.340 --> 06:19:53.340
It's not worth it, it's not worth it to you, it's worth it to me.

06:19:53.340 --> 06:19:58.340
This is just, I'm sorry, I'm determined, this is how I game.

06:19:58.340 --> 06:20:02.340
When I'm determined, I want to beat, I'll see something through.

06:20:02.340 --> 06:20:06.340
And you know, I wanted to get to 30.

06:20:06.340 --> 06:20:08.340
I think I'm at, I don't know if I'm at 30.

06:20:08.340 --> 06:20:12.340
Let me know how many times have I died.

06:20:12.340 --> 06:20:18.340
Because if I'm at 30, I'm going to go try to get the bloodhounds back because I want the moon veil.

06:20:18.340 --> 06:20:21.340
I'm at 46, legit.

06:20:21.340 --> 06:20:24.340
Okay, I'll do one more run.

06:20:24.340 --> 06:20:27.340
And then I'm going to go, I'm going to do something else.

06:20:27.340 --> 06:20:30.340
Uh, what am I doing?

06:20:30.340 --> 06:20:32.340
Alright.

06:20:42.340 --> 06:20:44.340
I love that.

06:20:54.340 --> 06:20:59.340
Oh, oh, you're a little saucy boy, aren't you, with your little dive?

06:20:59.340 --> 06:21:01.340
Aren't you cute.

06:21:03.340 --> 06:21:05.340
I'm going to do it again.

06:21:09.340 --> 06:21:12.340
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:21:13.340 --> 06:21:15.340
Huh.

06:21:21.340 --> 06:21:24.340
We're just opening over here.

06:21:27.340 --> 06:21:31.340
There's always like a little opening left behind.

06:21:31.340 --> 06:21:34.340
What is the worm weak against, by the way?

06:21:34.340 --> 06:21:37.340
I should have, I should have fucking figured that out.

06:21:43.340 --> 06:21:45.340
Right on cue.

06:21:50.340 --> 06:21:52.340
It's fine.

06:21:58.340 --> 06:22:00.340
I'm always in fire, I can't get him.

06:22:00.340 --> 06:22:03.340
He's like that, oh, he's dog piling my fucking dude.

06:22:05.340 --> 06:22:07.340
Yeah, like I can't.

06:22:12.340 --> 06:22:14.340
Okay.

06:22:24.340 --> 06:22:27.340
Can I stop aiming at his fucking head?

06:22:29.340 --> 06:22:31.340
Oh, it's so dumb.

06:22:34.340 --> 06:22:36.340
I love how differently you and strong you play this game.

06:22:36.340 --> 06:22:38.340
What do you mean?

06:22:43.340 --> 06:22:46.340
She really gets as many times as her age.

06:22:49.340 --> 06:22:53.340
No, wait, I need to read what the fuck you guys are saying.

06:23:00.340 --> 06:23:02.340
I'm in solar style.

06:23:02.340 --> 06:23:04.340
This box is versus everything.

06:23:04.340 --> 06:23:07.340
You're right, I think I remember, I think I remember that.

06:23:07.340 --> 06:23:09.340
Excuse me.

06:23:13.340 --> 06:23:16.340
I'm 56, guys.

06:23:16.340 --> 06:23:19.340
I'm 56, you guys know this.

06:23:19.340 --> 06:23:21.340
That was weak.

06:23:23.340 --> 06:23:27.340
I keep sitting down like it's fucking Liza P and that I don't need that.

06:23:27.340 --> 06:23:30.340
Oh, I'm in the fucking, no.

06:23:31.340 --> 06:23:33.340
Oh, I have to be.

06:23:33.340 --> 06:23:35.340
I can't teleport out.

06:23:35.340 --> 06:23:37.340
I have to walk out.

06:23:37.340 --> 06:23:39.340
Okay, that's fine.

06:23:42.340 --> 06:23:44.340
Okay.

06:23:49.340 --> 06:23:52.340
I wanted to play for longer, but I can feel myself getting a migraine.

06:23:55.340 --> 06:23:58.340
I forget, where was that jail?

06:24:00.340 --> 06:24:02.340
Oh my god, where was it?

06:24:02.340 --> 06:24:04.340
I don't know.

06:24:10.340 --> 06:24:12.340
I totally forgot it's over here.

06:24:21.340 --> 06:24:23.340
Oh, you don't sound like you're 56.

06:24:23.340 --> 06:24:25.340
Yeah, I'm 56, bro.

06:24:25.340 --> 06:24:27.340
I'm pretty old.

06:24:27.340 --> 06:24:29.340
You don't like your hag?

06:24:29.340 --> 06:24:31.340
I'm like, yeah, I'm a fucking hag.

06:24:33.340 --> 06:24:35.340
Uh...

06:24:41.340 --> 06:24:44.340
Sorry to put Rena on the floor again because she's...

06:24:50.340 --> 06:24:53.340
She's trying to jump up on me.

06:24:57.340 --> 06:24:59.340
I wish I could see.

06:25:03.340 --> 06:25:05.340
How many markers did I have?

06:25:08.340 --> 06:25:10.340
Okay, just that one.

06:25:15.340 --> 06:25:17.340
Have Blive help?

06:25:17.340 --> 06:25:19.340
No, I don't need Blive help.

06:25:21.340 --> 06:25:24.340
I will ask for help when I want it.

06:25:25.340 --> 06:25:28.340
Ugh, I'm going to start ignoring people if they're like,

06:25:28.340 --> 06:25:30.340
let me help or you should do this to do it.

06:25:30.340 --> 06:25:33.340
I'm doing it by myself the way I want to do it.

06:25:33.340 --> 06:25:36.340
If I need help, I will ask.

06:25:36.340 --> 06:25:38.340
It's that simple.

06:25:45.340 --> 06:25:47.340
I'm always in my prime, indeed.

06:25:48.340 --> 06:25:50.340
Maybe I can use a jellyfish on this, dude.

06:25:56.340 --> 06:25:58.340
Oh, I'm going to need to do that.

06:26:06.340 --> 06:26:08.340
Alright.

06:26:08.340 --> 06:26:10.340
Okay.

06:26:10.340 --> 06:26:12.340
Okay.

06:26:12.340 --> 06:26:14.340
Alright, I'm pressing breathe.

06:26:15.340 --> 06:26:17.340
Come on, my nose is itchy.

06:26:20.340 --> 06:26:22.340
My nose is itchy, please.

06:26:34.340 --> 06:26:37.340
Let me carry you, Queen. No more.

06:26:38.340 --> 06:26:40.340
I think that's what I said.

06:26:45.340 --> 06:26:47.340
He got that dog in him.

06:26:53.340 --> 06:26:55.340
What does it count?

06:26:55.340 --> 06:26:57.340
It she does.

06:26:57.340 --> 06:26:59.340
I don't get it sleeping.

06:26:59.340 --> 06:27:01.340
So none of these count, Raina.

06:27:01.340 --> 06:27:03.340
Please stop.

06:27:03.340 --> 06:27:05.340
Why don't you go lay down, Raina?

06:27:05.340 --> 06:27:07.340
I don't want to have to put you in the crate.

06:27:07.340 --> 06:27:09.340
You're moving around too much.

06:27:09.340 --> 06:27:12.340
I don't want you reopening your little thing in the water.

06:27:13.340 --> 06:27:15.340
That's a spry lady at 14.

06:27:21.340 --> 06:27:24.340
I felt like I was going to do something before this.

06:27:28.340 --> 06:27:30.340
Are they trying to give me an intervention?

06:27:30.340 --> 06:27:32.340
That's stupid.

06:27:32.340 --> 06:27:34.340
I can't use a summoning thing for this.

06:27:34.340 --> 06:27:36.340
That's stupid.

06:27:36.340 --> 06:27:38.340
Can I? No.

06:27:38.340 --> 06:27:40.340
Alright.

06:27:40.340 --> 06:27:42.340
Me and you, Darwin.

06:27:42.340 --> 06:27:44.340
Oh, shit.

06:27:44.340 --> 06:27:46.340
Well, this is awkward.

06:27:46.340 --> 06:27:48.340
I just wanted to be friends.

06:27:48.340 --> 06:27:50.340
I heard you had that dog in you,

06:27:50.340 --> 06:27:52.340
and I was just wondering if you

06:27:52.340 --> 06:27:54.340
wanted to put that dog in me too.

06:27:54.340 --> 06:27:56.340
What the fuck am I saying, bro?

06:27:58.340 --> 06:28:00.340
I can't hit you. You're too fast.

06:28:00.340 --> 06:28:02.340
I think I had blood loss.

06:28:12.340 --> 06:28:14.340
Sheebie! Oh my god, it's Freddie!

06:28:14.340 --> 06:28:16.340
Everybody!

06:28:16.340 --> 06:28:18.340
Sheebie, Ola. It's me, Funtime Freddie,

06:28:18.340 --> 06:28:20.340
and welcome to Elton...

06:28:20.340 --> 06:28:22.340
Trat is going by too fast. I can't read it.

06:28:22.340 --> 06:28:24.340
Hold on.

06:28:24.340 --> 06:28:26.340
I have to start over.

06:28:26.340 --> 06:28:28.340
Sheebie, Ola.

06:28:28.340 --> 06:28:30.340
It's me, Funtime Freddie,

06:28:30.340 --> 06:28:32.340
and welcome to Elton Ring Special Edition

06:28:32.340 --> 06:28:34.340
and Diamond Edition.

06:28:34.340 --> 06:28:36.340
Thank you, Freddie.

06:28:36.340 --> 06:28:38.340
Somebody said no profile picture?

06:28:38.340 --> 06:28:40.340
I want to see what the profile picture is.

06:28:40.340 --> 06:28:42.340
Go to channel.

06:28:46.340 --> 06:28:48.340
That's pretty sick.

06:28:48.340 --> 06:28:50.340
That's pretty gnarly.

06:28:50.340 --> 06:28:52.340
I like it.

06:28:56.340 --> 06:28:58.340
I like it.

06:29:02.340 --> 06:29:04.340
Sheebie, get up the furry allegations, please.

06:29:04.340 --> 06:29:06.340
You know, Toma is trying to teach me

06:29:06.340 --> 06:29:08.340
just to embrace being a furry.

06:29:08.340 --> 06:29:10.340
I'm still resistant.

06:29:10.340 --> 06:29:12.340
But, you know...

06:29:12.340 --> 06:29:14.340
Maybe I'll get some,

06:29:14.340 --> 06:29:16.340
you know, sweet furry lovers

06:29:16.340 --> 06:29:18.340
in my audience.

06:29:18.340 --> 06:29:20.340
You know how that can be.

06:29:26.340 --> 06:29:28.340
Diamond Edition? Yes, Diamond Edition.

06:29:28.340 --> 06:29:30.340
Don't doubt

06:29:30.340 --> 06:29:32.340
what Freddie says, bro.

06:29:32.340 --> 06:29:34.340
Okay?

06:29:38.340 --> 06:29:40.340
Now it'll attack.

06:29:40.340 --> 06:29:42.340
Attract.

06:29:42.340 --> 06:29:44.340
What is that?

06:29:44.340 --> 06:29:46.340
Explain. Just beat Mogue.

06:29:46.340 --> 06:29:48.340
Nice job!

06:29:48.340 --> 06:29:50.340
Good on you, bro.

06:29:50.340 --> 06:29:52.340
Furry Oilers?

06:29:52.340 --> 06:29:54.340
There are furry Oilers?

06:29:54.340 --> 06:29:56.340
I'm sorry, that's a funny concept to me.

06:29:56.340 --> 06:29:58.340
Furries do have a lot of money.

06:30:02.340 --> 06:30:04.340
Because I got lots of good art.

06:30:04.340 --> 06:30:06.340
My friend paid off her college tuition

06:30:06.340 --> 06:30:08.340
with just making very sexy art.

06:30:10.340 --> 06:30:12.340
Hola, chica.

06:30:14.340 --> 06:30:16.340
Oh, you're weak against this.

06:30:20.340 --> 06:30:22.340
You're very weak against this.

06:30:24.340 --> 06:30:26.340
Ow.

06:30:26.340 --> 06:30:28.340
I see to stay alive.

06:30:30.340 --> 06:30:32.340
Oh, I see to stay alive!

06:30:54.340 --> 06:30:56.340
Ow.

06:31:02.340 --> 06:31:04.340
Oh, I'm so close.

06:31:06.340 --> 06:31:08.340
No, no, no, no.

06:31:16.340 --> 06:31:18.340
Okay, okay, this is easy.

06:31:18.340 --> 06:31:20.340
This is easy, guys.

06:31:20.340 --> 06:31:22.340
I can do this one. You guys see how well I dodge.

06:31:22.340 --> 06:31:24.340
Aren't you impressed with my dodging ability?

06:31:26.340 --> 06:31:28.340
I'm very good at dodger.

06:31:32.340 --> 06:31:34.340
Never knew.

06:31:34.340 --> 06:31:36.340
Wait, Muppets are considered furries?

06:31:36.340 --> 06:31:38.340
All right, guys, I'm a furry.

06:31:40.340 --> 06:31:42.340
You hear her first.

06:31:42.340 --> 06:31:44.340
Shibi, furry.

06:31:46.340 --> 06:31:48.340
Easy clap, easy clap, easy clap, easy clap, bro.

06:31:48.340 --> 06:31:50.340
Easy peasy.

06:31:50.340 --> 06:31:52.340
I really forgot he was weak to magic shit.

06:31:58.340 --> 06:32:00.340
Does any furry want to be my sugar daddy?

06:32:00.340 --> 06:32:02.340
I have cat medical bills to pay.

06:32:12.340 --> 06:32:14.340
Oh, that would miss him.

06:32:14.340 --> 06:32:16.340
I'm trying to keep him, like, here.

06:32:16.340 --> 06:32:18.340
Oh, every time I heal,

06:32:18.340 --> 06:32:20.340
I literally have to do it in, like, one run.

06:32:28.340 --> 06:32:30.340
Why roll into that one?

06:32:48.340 --> 06:32:50.340
Come out.

06:32:50.340 --> 06:32:52.340
Oh, I just noticed that.

06:33:12.340 --> 06:33:14.340
Come on.

06:33:14.340 --> 06:33:16.340
Oh, fuck, I was getting too eager.

06:33:16.340 --> 06:33:18.340
I thought I was going to kill him.

06:33:24.340 --> 06:33:26.340
There we go.

06:33:26.340 --> 06:33:28.340
Hand over your fucking sword.

06:33:28.340 --> 06:33:30.340
Thank you.

06:33:30.340 --> 06:33:32.340
I need that. Appreciate it.

06:33:36.340 --> 06:33:38.340
Let's fucking go.

06:33:38.340 --> 06:33:40.340
See, when I'm not fucking over-leveled,

06:33:40.340 --> 06:33:42.340
I mean, under-leveled,

06:33:42.340 --> 06:33:44.340
for like a dude, I can usually get them.

06:33:46.340 --> 06:33:48.340
So proud of me. Thank you.

06:33:48.340 --> 06:33:50.340
Thank you, guys. I killed something.

06:33:52.340 --> 06:33:54.340
I did it.

06:33:54.340 --> 06:33:56.340
That's why he wasn't trying to dodge.

06:33:56.340 --> 06:33:58.340
Well, him, like, dodging is different.

06:34:00.340 --> 06:34:02.340
I don't know if this

06:34:04.340 --> 06:34:06.340
scales properly.

06:34:06.340 --> 06:34:08.340
I need more strength.

06:34:12.340 --> 06:34:14.340
I fucking love this shit.

06:34:14.340 --> 06:34:16.340
Oh, it's so fucking sexy.

06:34:20.340 --> 06:34:22.340
Oh, fuck it.

06:34:22.340 --> 06:34:24.340
Oh, yes, daddy.

06:34:24.340 --> 06:34:26.340
Sorry.

06:34:26.340 --> 06:34:28.340
All right.

06:34:30.340 --> 06:34:32.340
Cool.

06:34:32.340 --> 06:34:34.340
Nice.

06:34:34.340 --> 06:34:36.340
Noink. Wow.

06:34:36.340 --> 06:34:38.340
A whole zero runes.

06:34:44.340 --> 06:34:46.340
Thank you, Madika.

06:34:46.340 --> 06:34:48.340
I'll be taking this sword.

06:34:50.340 --> 06:34:52.340
And I'll be taking- I forget

06:34:52.340 --> 06:34:54.340
I don't need to go to a grace to teleport.

06:34:54.340 --> 06:34:56.340
I'm such a fucking-

06:34:58.340 --> 06:35:00.340
All right, let's see.

06:35:02.340 --> 06:35:04.340
If this helps.

06:35:04.340 --> 06:35:06.340
Why do you look like a Muppet?

06:35:06.340 --> 06:35:08.340
I don't know why the fuck do you look like a Muppet?

06:35:08.340 --> 06:35:10.340
Fucking Julio Passos. Fuck you.

06:35:10.340 --> 06:35:12.340
Get out of here.

06:35:14.340 --> 06:35:16.340
I'm sorry.

06:35:16.340 --> 06:35:18.340
I'm over-tired.

06:35:22.340 --> 06:35:24.340
I'm raging at a game.

06:35:24.340 --> 06:35:26.340
It's not the fucking time.

06:35:26.340 --> 06:35:28.340
All right.

06:35:28.340 --> 06:35:30.340
Yeah.

06:35:30.340 --> 06:35:32.340
Doxic is effort.

06:35:32.340 --> 06:35:34.340
Do you have enough strength to wield that even two-handed?

06:35:34.340 --> 06:35:36.340
Yeah.

06:35:36.340 --> 06:35:38.340
All right.

06:35:44.340 --> 06:35:46.340
Because my strength is at like 12

06:35:46.340 --> 06:35:48.340
and you need 15.

06:35:48.340 --> 06:35:50.340
Oh fuck, it's at 11.

06:35:50.340 --> 06:35:52.340
That's fine.

06:35:52.340 --> 06:35:54.340
We'll find out.

06:35:54.340 --> 06:35:56.340
We'll find out.

06:35:56.340 --> 06:35:58.340
Let's go.

06:36:02.340 --> 06:36:04.340
Can I get a Hoyah?

06:36:06.340 --> 06:36:08.340
Yah.

06:36:08.340 --> 06:36:10.340
Come on.

06:36:10.340 --> 06:36:12.340
No.

06:36:12.340 --> 06:36:14.340
Oh fuck, this is worse.

06:36:18.340 --> 06:36:20.340
I like this one because you can

06:36:20.340 --> 06:36:22.340
jump away.

06:36:22.340 --> 06:36:24.340
Oh god, what is this?

06:36:24.340 --> 06:36:26.340
I think I need more strength, guys.

06:36:26.340 --> 06:36:28.340
I'm stuck.

06:36:28.340 --> 06:36:30.340
Oh no.

06:36:30.340 --> 06:36:32.340
He's gonna fucking kill me.

06:36:34.340 --> 06:36:36.340
No, it needs 15.

06:36:36.340 --> 06:36:38.340
Does it?

06:36:38.340 --> 06:36:40.340
I don't know. Let's find out.

06:36:42.340 --> 06:36:44.340
Well...

06:36:52.340 --> 06:36:54.340
Shit.

06:36:56.340 --> 06:36:58.340
All right, well...

06:37:02.340 --> 06:37:04.340
Let's try this.

06:37:06.340 --> 06:37:08.340
Because again, bleeding.

06:37:08.340 --> 06:37:10.340
We'll try to get that blade damage.

06:37:10.340 --> 06:37:12.340
I'm so determined to fucking

06:37:12.340 --> 06:37:14.340
beat this guy.

06:37:14.340 --> 06:37:16.340
If you do a heavy attack after a back dodge,

06:37:16.340 --> 06:37:18.340
you do a follow-up.

06:37:18.340 --> 06:37:20.340
Although it doesn't really matter at this point.

06:37:22.340 --> 06:37:24.340
Since I don't have the stats.

06:37:26.340 --> 06:37:28.340
We'll just see if we can keep it up with this.

06:37:40.340 --> 06:37:42.340
What the fuck was that?

06:37:50.340 --> 06:37:52.340
I don't know what happened.

06:37:52.340 --> 06:37:54.340
I think you two handed the fang.

06:37:54.340 --> 06:37:56.340
I just two handed it and it fucked me up.

06:37:56.340 --> 06:37:58.340
I only did 14 damage.

06:37:58.340 --> 06:38:00.340
I don't have enough strength, bro.

06:38:00.340 --> 06:38:02.340
I don't have enough strength.

06:38:02.340 --> 06:38:04.340
My little fucking muppet arms can't lift up

06:38:04.340 --> 06:38:06.340
the fucking huge ass thing.

06:38:06.340 --> 06:38:08.340
Sorry, I'm cursing a lot.

06:38:08.340 --> 06:38:10.340
Okay.

06:38:16.340 --> 06:38:18.340
Spits it out.

06:38:24.340 --> 06:38:26.340
He's my fucking friend.

06:38:30.340 --> 06:38:32.340
You can't dog pile

06:38:32.340 --> 06:38:34.340
on the jellyfish. You're cheating.

06:38:34.340 --> 06:38:36.340
Take off your hacks.

06:38:38.340 --> 06:38:40.340
My neighbors are probably sick of me.

06:38:40.340 --> 06:38:42.340
I'm gonna fucking beat your ass.

06:38:42.340 --> 06:38:44.340
Beat your ass.

06:38:44.340 --> 06:38:46.340
Beat your ass.

06:38:46.340 --> 06:38:48.340
Beat your ass.

06:38:48.340 --> 06:38:50.340
Beat your ass.

06:38:50.340 --> 06:38:52.340
Beat your ass.

06:38:52.340 --> 06:38:54.340
I don't care.

06:38:54.340 --> 06:38:56.340
I don't care if I'm in lava. I'm beating your ass.

06:38:56.340 --> 06:38:57.340
Anyone with one strike

06:38:58.340 --> 06:39:00.340
can keep me in for it.

06:39:06.340 --> 06:39:08.340
Must be hard playing with the controller using a muppet.

06:39:08.340 --> 06:39:10.340
It is very difficult.

06:39:10.340 --> 06:39:12.340
Um.

06:39:12.340 --> 06:39:14.340
I realize that I just lost all my runes doing that.

06:39:14.340 --> 06:39:16.340
Uh, I don't really know how many runes

06:39:16.340 --> 06:39:18.340
I got from that though, so I don't really care.

06:39:18.340 --> 06:39:20.340
Um.

06:39:20.340 --> 06:39:24.340
I just, I need a good weapon, you know.

06:39:26.340 --> 06:39:28.340
Oh

06:39:35.620 --> 06:39:41.580
See immediately immediately I can only kick you

06:39:46.060 --> 06:39:51.260
Can you like stop you stop dogfiling on the jellyfish, I don't know what is your deal, bro

06:39:52.340 --> 06:39:56.160
I'm really gonna fucking kill myself. I'm gonna do it right now. I'm killing myself

06:39:56.580 --> 06:39:58.580
And they'll do the force

06:40:09.140 --> 06:40:13.340
Wait, do I have the ratting in source ill on

06:40:26.540 --> 06:40:28.540
I

06:40:29.140 --> 06:40:31.140
Take more damage

06:40:49.420 --> 06:40:52.660
No, I fucking love that so much, okay

06:40:57.000 --> 06:41:00.100
Let's try it, let's try it

06:41:12.340 --> 06:41:18.980
Awkward I definitely take more damage guys. That's for sure. I can assure you that I

06:41:20.820 --> 06:41:23.260
Am ripe for the damage

06:41:26.380 --> 06:41:29.460
Let me talk. I'm like trying to do shit and you're like

06:41:31.660 --> 06:41:34.620
Can't even get close to you because there's lava fucking everywhere

06:41:36.780 --> 06:41:38.780
Can you

06:41:39.140 --> 06:41:45.580
Can you like stop having a temper tantrum for like just a second so I can like poke you in the ass

06:41:56.340 --> 06:41:58.340
How did you already kill him

06:42:01.740 --> 06:42:03.740
What

06:42:05.340 --> 06:42:07.340
I'm pressing heal

06:42:07.340 --> 06:42:32.140
Okay, I'm doing a little bit more damage

06:42:32.980 --> 06:42:34.980
I'm gonna search for her

06:42:35.300 --> 06:42:38.340
So get shimmy lock in should be easy. Yeah

06:42:40.300 --> 06:42:45.740
She's training us out for a big wizard. I'm getting epi, but I want to finish this

06:42:48.540 --> 06:42:51.580
Just five hours of me trying to beat a fucking lizard

06:43:02.140 --> 06:43:04.140
I

06:43:04.140 --> 06:43:06.140
I

06:43:06.140 --> 06:43:08.140
I

06:43:30.340 --> 06:43:32.340
Just need to keep him alive

06:43:36.340 --> 06:43:38.340
I might not make it

06:43:43.820 --> 06:43:45.820
Keep sick in him

06:43:48.220 --> 06:43:51.580
Now damn I am definitely taking it

06:43:55.420 --> 06:43:57.860
Okay, okay, we run around run around

06:44:00.300 --> 06:44:03.180
Yeah, I didn't make it fuck

06:44:06.300 --> 06:44:08.300
It's not fun

06:44:22.340 --> 06:44:24.340
It's fine, you got him poison that's all I wanted

06:44:29.620 --> 06:44:34.980
Sound like fucking Elmo are you done? Oh my god, I'm running into the lava

06:44:36.820 --> 06:44:38.820
Bro, what is

06:44:40.740 --> 06:44:45.460
Only human should be allowed to spam attacks not AI this this is ridiculous. I can't even

06:45:01.100 --> 06:45:03.100
Oh actually I was better being close up

06:45:06.140 --> 06:45:10.220
Sorry, my pinky toe was in a flame of lava

06:45:15.420 --> 06:45:17.420
Just couldn't win for hours. Oh man

06:45:18.740 --> 06:45:23.900
Hey, I ruined my Elton string stream. Nice title. I'm definitely considering

06:45:23.900 --> 06:45:29.460
I'm probably gonna take a nap for a little bit wake up send alarm beat this guy off stream

06:45:30.380 --> 06:45:32.380
And then we'll play in the morning

06:45:36.140 --> 06:45:38.140
Oh

06:45:52.500 --> 06:45:56.620
Well, I'm just gonna stay here until that goes away

06:45:57.420 --> 06:46:02.100
I'm kind of terrified. My son just died. I heard his screams of jellyfish terror

06:46:03.020 --> 06:46:05.020
That's really too sad

06:46:07.020 --> 06:46:09.300
I'm just gonna let him kill me

06:46:16.780 --> 06:46:18.780
24 hour elder during stream

06:46:19.860 --> 06:46:25.500
What you first tried off stream, I would hate that I was so pissed like nobody fucking saw this

06:46:25.820 --> 06:46:31.060
Cuz that's that's literally what happened when I was finding a boss on lines of p. I fought it off stream

06:46:31.060 --> 06:46:34.380
And then like it took me three more tries and I got it and I'm like very fucking serious

06:46:34.380 --> 06:46:37.380
Fucking clown bitch

06:47:05.380 --> 06:47:07.380
Oh

06:47:17.100 --> 06:47:25.100
I'm stuck as you can see I'm in like fucking stop lock shit. You got this. Yeah sure

06:47:26.140 --> 06:47:27.540
Sure

06:47:27.540 --> 06:47:29.540
I'm so late. I'm so

06:47:30.380 --> 06:47:31.700
I'm so like

06:47:31.700 --> 06:47:36.260
Autismally focused on this now. I'm sorry like I'm just like I need to finish I need to get it done

06:47:36.260 --> 06:47:38.740
I need to be to me. I need to be to me. I need it. I need it. I need it

06:47:38.740 --> 06:47:42.340
I need it now. I need it now. I can't sleep until I do. I have to I have to I have to I have to be

06:47:42.340 --> 06:47:44.340
I have to you

06:47:49.180 --> 06:47:51.180
Okay, fly jellyfish fly

06:47:59.540 --> 06:48:01.540
Out

06:48:07.020 --> 06:48:09.020
Really

06:48:11.500 --> 06:48:17.020
Why do I feel like it knocked back harder, it's not even like I get extra damage. I just feel like I get knocked back harder

06:48:20.140 --> 06:48:22.140
Oh, we just turned around and killed him

06:48:29.540 --> 06:48:31.540
I

06:48:51.020 --> 06:48:53.660
Love it when I clip into the thing it's great

06:48:54.020 --> 06:48:56.020
I

06:48:57.580 --> 06:49:00.180
Such a strong co-wonka woman, I don't know about that. I

06:49:01.260 --> 06:49:05.700
Am definitely doing more damage because he jellyfish to brody it lasts as long

06:49:08.060 --> 06:49:10.060
Fuck you

06:49:11.540 --> 06:49:13.540
Not doing shit again

06:49:14.700 --> 06:49:20.540
Like I could be like making shit I could be doing a bunch of other stuff, but you know, we don't do that out here

06:49:24.660 --> 06:49:30.460
Okay, you see he didn't get trapped in the fucking door this time

06:49:31.580 --> 06:49:36.420
I was gonna take the heat off of him so he can continue to spam the poison

06:49:40.060 --> 06:49:43.620
To get out of this fire to go away, that's fine perfect

06:49:53.660 --> 06:49:55.660
I

06:50:03.940 --> 06:50:09.820
There's lava here, I can't really do much I don't think you got poison

06:50:10.060 --> 06:50:12.060
It's fine

06:50:20.260 --> 06:50:27.820
It's literally all dependent on if he gets poisoned I can beat him which sucks

06:50:31.660 --> 06:50:34.460
But it's just because I'm underleveled it's a fact

06:50:40.820 --> 06:50:42.820
I

06:50:45.100 --> 06:50:47.100
Know that worked out

06:50:50.180 --> 06:50:52.180
Quickly blood loss, please

06:51:09.820 --> 06:51:19.780
Oh fuck am I dead am I dead? No, I'm not dead

06:51:22.460 --> 06:51:24.460
Holy shit, holy shit

06:51:33.060 --> 06:51:35.060
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god

06:51:39.820 --> 06:51:41.820
Oh

06:52:09.820 --> 06:52:11.820
Oh

06:52:21.660 --> 06:52:23.940
It's doing that weird thing where it locks on

06:52:28.100 --> 06:52:32.660
And only his head instead of it's happening just what I want

06:52:40.420 --> 06:52:42.420
Oh

06:52:45.340 --> 06:52:47.340
No, not the brazier

06:53:01.540 --> 06:53:03.540
No

06:53:10.060 --> 06:53:12.060
I

06:53:24.180 --> 06:53:26.580
No, no, no, no, no, please no, oh brother

06:53:26.580 --> 06:53:28.580
I

06:53:38.860 --> 06:53:44.060
Think I can do it out jelly. I'm wondering if I should wait till the towards like I get him half done

06:53:50.420 --> 06:53:55.700
Feels less than half the damage, okay good to know I wasn't paying attention to my my FP to be honest with you

06:53:56.820 --> 06:54:02.580
Okay, we'll try it without jelly and for a little bit

06:54:14.980 --> 06:54:17.940
I can get him trapped in a corner when he does that he should be actually

06:54:18.420 --> 06:54:21.340
Fine to manage because then he won't be doing so much lava everywhere

06:54:26.780 --> 06:54:28.780
This

06:54:42.180 --> 06:54:44.180
So you can get a head start

06:54:45.820 --> 06:54:53.540
Maybe because in the lava run the heat the automatically the AI aggro's the thing what you've been doing a lava run

06:54:53.540 --> 06:54:55.540
Oh

06:54:55.860 --> 06:54:57.860
Sorry

06:55:07.540 --> 06:55:11.180
Okay, right off the rip. We're just he did not want me touching his booty hole

06:55:13.380 --> 06:55:15.380
Okay

06:55:18.140 --> 06:55:20.380
Bro, I'm getting my shit kicked in right now

06:55:24.540 --> 06:55:30.940
Let's see, let's see if he's okay over here. He doesn't wander into fucking lava like he's doing right now actually

06:55:31.900 --> 06:55:34.540
Okay, yeah, uh jellyfish is gonna die

06:55:35.940 --> 06:55:37.940
That was fucking waste

06:55:40.900 --> 06:55:42.900
Oh brother

06:55:44.220 --> 06:55:46.220
Yeah

06:55:47.700 --> 06:55:50.100
I know that was a better rate for that one

06:55:50.700 --> 06:55:52.100
I

06:55:52.100 --> 06:55:55.780
Don't even want the moon veil. I just want to kill him. I just want to kill him

06:55:58.140 --> 06:56:00.340
Time is it 11 fuck

06:56:06.340 --> 06:56:08.340
Alexander only you would fucking help me

06:56:10.980 --> 06:56:13.580
What if I spawn it right on him

06:56:20.220 --> 06:56:22.220
I

06:56:22.220 --> 06:56:51.220
I'm getting too eager, I'm sorry, I just want to kill him.

06:56:51.220 --> 06:56:58.220
This will actually be a good run if I never run.

06:56:58.220 --> 06:57:23.220
I should put on some fire-resistant shit, to be honest with you.

06:57:23.220 --> 06:57:49.220
Why are you doing this multiple times?

06:57:49.220 --> 06:57:57.220
I'm stuck.

06:57:57.220 --> 06:58:03.220
I'm already down to the blasts, I just don't know why I'm bothering.

06:58:03.220 --> 06:58:15.220
Actually, this is helpful because when I do this, I can immediately actually dodge out of the stuff, and I'm not using it.

06:58:15.220 --> 06:58:25.220
This spawn on top of him seems good, it seems like that worked actually.

06:58:25.220 --> 06:58:33.220
Okay, let me ask him nicely to die, I'll try that next.

06:58:45.220 --> 06:58:56.220
I would appreciate it if you died nicely, calmly, died, that would be really nice.

06:58:56.220 --> 06:59:07.220
If you could, that would really be so great, I would really appreciate that.

06:59:07.220 --> 06:59:10.220
It would be cool if he didn't kill my friend.

06:59:10.220 --> 06:59:15.220
Two, that would be super nice, but I don't know if you can be trusted with that.

06:59:15.220 --> 06:59:24.220
I'm stuck, I'm in the swamp, I'm fine.

06:59:24.220 --> 06:59:28.220
Ow, that wasn't nice.

06:59:28.220 --> 06:59:30.220
Ow.

06:59:30.220 --> 06:59:36.220
I don't think it worked.

06:59:37.220 --> 06:59:44.220
I've heard a woman ask me to die, I probably won't.

06:59:44.220 --> 06:59:55.220
Excuse me, could you please, K-Y-S, kiss your sister, and I just show them a picture of Amy, and then he just licks, I don't think.

06:59:56.220 --> 07:00:06.220
I opened you, I'm jumping on you, I'm jumping, ow.

07:00:06.220 --> 07:00:09.220
Ow.

07:00:09.220 --> 07:00:15.220
That's fine, anyways, okay.

07:00:15.220 --> 07:00:20.220
You get him, Jilly, I'm gonna be dead on the other side.

07:00:21.220 --> 07:00:27.220
I don't think bosses run out of stamina, but thank you.

07:00:27.220 --> 07:00:33.220
Inside of a dragon is kind of hollow, WTF.

07:00:33.220 --> 07:00:37.220
Riddle me this, riddle me this, Batman.

07:00:37.220 --> 07:00:49.220
If I went to dragon place and got the dragon head that does the blight, do you think that would be effective?

07:00:50.220 --> 07:00:57.220
I would, would I need more arcane for that?

07:00:57.220 --> 07:01:01.220
I'm not sure.

07:01:01.220 --> 07:01:05.220
Kind of wish I had some coffee, because I want to keep playing.

07:01:05.220 --> 07:01:08.220
We need arcane, yeah, no shit, rotten breath, yes.

07:01:08.220 --> 07:01:14.220
We would need more arcane.

07:01:14.220 --> 07:01:19.220
Face in arcane.

07:01:44.220 --> 07:01:51.220
See, I'm going to use some jump to essentially move that out of a large way to those attacks.

07:01:51.220 --> 07:01:59.220
Now while we're lying, it's going to be a throw-up, which while I do get sloppy, I do hit quite a few times, which I could have otherwise avoided.

07:01:59.220 --> 07:02:01.220
It's so impressive.

07:02:01.220 --> 07:02:13.220
As I said, the house starts with the jiggy-tarnas here, and my brand-new strategy is to move some relief to the place we can to be guessed at damage-race this boss to his hand.

07:02:14.220 --> 07:02:25.220
If I take a massive hit there, the only thing that I'm not going to be using is spirit summons, and that's mainly because they make the boss unpredictable.

07:02:25.220 --> 07:02:30.220
I know what the boss is going to do in the kind of room-space for this boss.

07:02:30.220 --> 07:02:32.220
Oh, I knew it.

07:02:32.220 --> 07:02:41.220
And if I have spirit summons, it's essentially going to pull it to make the boss do something to jump on a low attack.

07:02:41.220 --> 07:02:49.220
So I'm not going to be using a low-bottom smash attack, which you can very well use that if I want to.

07:02:49.220 --> 07:02:51.220
If I want to.

07:02:51.220 --> 07:02:58.220
Just go for standing palestons attacks, standing on low attacks to just build.

07:02:58.220 --> 07:03:04.220
And I can say, though, is that you're sure that you don't get yourself too close on a low blow.

07:03:04.220 --> 07:03:07.220
This boss loves to do that, working in tight waves.

07:03:07.220 --> 07:03:09.220
Use his mag at every map.

07:03:09.220 --> 07:03:14.220
Make a move, and she's able to rep the direction.

07:03:14.220 --> 07:03:18.220
To realize you're surrounding herself at night.

07:03:18.220 --> 07:03:23.220
So this boss loves to do this attack, two, three times a move, and three times a move.

07:03:23.220 --> 07:03:29.220
He does it twice, but I don't get kicked in this fight.

07:03:29.220 --> 07:03:36.220
Sorry, I'm learning.

07:03:36.220 --> 07:03:39.220
I didn't realize he does a lot of jumping.

07:03:39.220 --> 07:03:44.220
Like he just jumps to avoid the ground pound.

07:03:44.220 --> 07:03:54.220
Okay.

07:03:54.220 --> 07:03:58.220
All right, let's try it.

07:03:58.220 --> 07:04:04.220
Studying Sun Tzu in some of the Bible.

07:04:04.220 --> 07:04:05.220
Studies.

07:04:05.220 --> 07:04:06.220
Oh, yeah.

07:04:06.220 --> 07:04:12.220
No, I love studying like move sets.

07:04:12.220 --> 07:04:14.220
I think scale.

07:04:14.220 --> 07:04:20.220
That's I think that's why I like this game a lot because I didn't know I like those things until I played this game.

07:04:20.220 --> 07:04:21.220
Okay, we're not.

07:04:21.220 --> 07:04:23.220
We're just gonna.

07:04:23.220 --> 07:04:25.220
Yeah, whatever.

07:04:25.220 --> 07:04:26.220
Fucking hell.

07:04:26.220 --> 07:04:30.220
My eye is itchy.

07:04:30.220 --> 07:04:31.220
My eyes itchy.

07:04:31.220 --> 07:04:32.220
Hold on.

07:04:32.220 --> 07:04:33.220
My eyes itchy.

07:04:33.220 --> 07:04:38.220
My eyes itchy.

07:04:38.220 --> 07:04:47.220
I realize if I stay in one place, he also stays in one place.

07:04:47.220 --> 07:04:51.220
He's gonna do it a third time.

07:04:51.220 --> 07:04:52.220
Oh, I timed that incorrectly.

07:04:52.220 --> 07:04:57.220
It's fine.

07:04:57.220 --> 07:04:58.220
Oh, I didn't do that.

07:04:58.220 --> 07:05:04.220
So he does a jump when he ground pounds, but I don't know the timing for that yet.

07:05:04.220 --> 07:05:07.220
Jesus, please let me get up.

07:05:08.220 --> 07:05:09.220
Why am I?

07:05:09.220 --> 07:05:10.220
My timing is all fucked up.

07:05:10.220 --> 07:05:13.220
I think because I'm too tired.

07:05:13.220 --> 07:05:16.220
Since when do you spam this attack?

07:05:16.220 --> 07:05:20.220
Hello?

07:05:20.220 --> 07:05:23.220
You know what?

07:05:23.220 --> 07:05:31.220
I think I'm too tired.

07:05:31.220 --> 07:05:33.220
Okay, we're playing tomorrow bright and early.

07:05:33.220 --> 07:05:35.220
You better be ready, boys.

07:05:35.220 --> 07:05:38.220
I'm gonna take a nap.

07:05:38.220 --> 07:05:40.220
I'm gonna wake up.

07:05:40.220 --> 07:05:43.220
I'm gonna play some more.

07:05:43.220 --> 07:05:48.220
This boss will be dead in God for the time.

07:05:48.220 --> 07:05:52.220
And then in the morning, I don't know.

07:05:52.220 --> 07:05:55.220
I don't know what's going on.

07:05:55.220 --> 07:05:57.220
Just stay in the lookout.

07:05:57.220 --> 07:05:58.220
All right.

07:05:58.220 --> 07:06:02.220
So I'm gonna say bright and early.

07:06:02.220 --> 07:06:03.220
Hey, damn.

07:06:03.220 --> 07:06:06.220
No kidding.

07:06:06.220 --> 07:06:07.220
I don't know.

07:06:07.220 --> 07:06:08.220
I'll be around.

07:06:08.220 --> 07:06:15.220
If you guys don't have plans for 4th July or your U.K. or Euro or whatever you are,

07:06:15.220 --> 07:06:20.220
we are hanging out or playing some melding ring.

07:06:20.220 --> 07:06:22.220
My head hurts.

07:06:22.220 --> 07:06:25.220
I need to sleep.

07:06:25.220 --> 07:06:31.220
Um, yeah, yeah.

07:06:31.220 --> 07:06:32.220
Today's your birthday.

07:06:32.220 --> 07:06:33.220
Oh my God.

07:06:33.220 --> 07:06:34.220
Happy birthday.

07:06:34.220 --> 07:06:35.220
Good for you.

07:06:35.220 --> 07:06:37.220
Aren't you happy you're still on this earth?

07:06:37.220 --> 07:06:39.220
I'm happy you're still on this earth.

07:06:39.220 --> 07:06:41.220
Your town is already celebrating that.

07:06:41.220 --> 07:06:42.220
That's, yeah.

07:06:42.220 --> 07:06:45.220
I think that's why I swear I thought I heard fireworks.

07:06:45.220 --> 07:06:46.220
Oh, it's cool.

07:06:46.220 --> 07:06:47.220
I'm going to see.

07:06:47.220 --> 07:06:51.220
So they do the fireworks like in my town center and I can see that from my apartment

07:06:51.220 --> 07:06:52.220
building.

07:06:52.220 --> 07:06:53.220
So it'll be really cool.

07:06:53.220 --> 07:06:56.220
I can just look outside and see them.

07:06:56.220 --> 07:07:11.220
Yeah, I'm just like very determined when it comes to games.

07:07:11.220 --> 07:07:13.220
Like I've had friends sit and watch me play.

07:07:13.220 --> 07:07:19.220
Um, and they're just like, why don't you just do this or that or whatever and like

07:07:19.220 --> 07:07:21.220
come back to it or whatever.

07:07:21.220 --> 07:07:22.220
I'm like, no.

07:07:22.220 --> 07:07:24.220
Like I won't lie.

07:07:24.220 --> 07:07:30.900
I was definitely that person that determinedly powered through tree sentinel the first time

07:07:30.900 --> 07:07:34.060
I played a hundred because I thought I had to beat him.

07:07:34.060 --> 07:07:35.220
So I get it.

07:07:35.220 --> 07:07:42.220
Um, I'm just, I just like to see things through, you know, gotta hit that brick wall till it

07:07:42.220 --> 07:07:43.220
falls over a hundred percent.

07:07:43.220 --> 07:07:45.220
I'm bashing my head through that shit.

07:07:45.220 --> 07:07:46.220
You have no idea.

07:07:46.220 --> 07:07:49.220
Uh, well, I hope you enjoyed.

07:07:49.220 --> 07:07:51.220
Um, I know I did.

07:07:51.220 --> 07:07:53.220
I love this game.

07:07:53.220 --> 07:07:55.220
I kind of just want to stay up.

07:07:55.220 --> 07:07:57.220
I don't have to fucking.

07:07:57.220 --> 07:07:58.220
I hate.

07:07:58.220 --> 07:08:00.220
Well, I love sleeping.

07:08:00.220 --> 07:08:04.220
Like I took like a fucking like three hour, four hour nap today.

07:08:04.220 --> 07:08:05.220
I don't know how I'm still tired.

07:08:05.220 --> 07:08:08.220
My body's just like, stop.

07:08:08.220 --> 07:08:13.220
Um, you love watching people play.

07:08:13.220 --> 07:08:15.220
I'm gonna watch me do it.

07:08:15.220 --> 07:08:16.220
I do.

07:08:16.220 --> 07:08:20.220
I hope you guys enjoy my very colorful commentary.

07:08:20.220 --> 07:08:25.220
I know for a fact this video will be fucking tomorrow.

07:08:25.220 --> 07:08:27.220
Oh, what are you doing?

07:08:27.220 --> 07:08:29.220
She's like walking around like she's up to something.

07:08:29.220 --> 07:08:30.220
What are you doing, lady?

07:08:30.220 --> 07:08:31.220
Sneaky.

07:08:31.220 --> 07:08:43.220
Um, but I hope you, I hope you have a good night or a good day or a good evening or morning

07:08:43.220 --> 07:08:51.220
or dusk or dawn or afternoon or early afternoon.

07:08:51.220 --> 07:08:55.220
I'll be back tomorrow in Muppet form.

07:08:55.220 --> 07:09:00.220
Please check out what is high on heart stream.

07:09:00.220 --> 07:09:02.220
They are very entertaining.

07:09:02.220 --> 07:09:04.220
I do like her.

07:09:04.220 --> 07:09:08.220
Um, and please check out.

07:09:09.220 --> 07:09:11.220
I love her.

07:09:11.220 --> 07:09:14.220
She made me my Muppet self.

07:09:14.220 --> 07:09:18.220
You got amazing Muppet madam today.

07:09:18.220 --> 07:09:21.220
Look how nice my little Muppet boobies are.

07:09:21.220 --> 07:09:23.220
Her stuff is pinned.

07:09:23.220 --> 07:09:25.220
Please check out her Twitch.

07:09:25.220 --> 07:09:26.220
She is so lovely.

07:09:26.220 --> 07:09:27.220
She's so sweet.

07:09:27.220 --> 07:09:31.220
One of the comfiest streamers I've ever watched and also a great friend of mine.

07:09:31.220 --> 07:09:34.220
She's helped me a lot when I first heard of VTubing.

07:09:34.220 --> 07:09:36.220
I look up to her.

07:09:36.220 --> 07:09:37.220
She's awesome.

07:09:37.220 --> 07:09:40.220
Please check her out.

07:09:40.220 --> 07:09:43.220
All right.

07:09:43.220 --> 07:09:48.220
I almost, I watched like Markiplier play like Slay the princess the other day and I literally

07:09:48.220 --> 07:09:52.220
subconsciously almost went, until the next video.

07:09:52.220 --> 07:09:53.220
Bye.

07:09:53.220 --> 07:09:57.220
I'm so fucking tired, dude.

07:09:57.220 --> 07:09:59.220
Slay the princess is a good game too.

07:09:59.220 --> 07:10:01.220
I would love to play Slay the princess on stream.

07:10:01.220 --> 07:10:06.220
Um, oh, I'm so tired.

07:10:06.220 --> 07:10:07.220
Okay.

07:10:07.220 --> 07:10:08.220
Please don't go.

07:10:08.220 --> 07:10:09.220
I don't want to go.

07:10:09.220 --> 07:10:10.220
You know I don't want to go.

07:10:10.220 --> 07:10:12.220
No, I always want to hang out with you guys.

07:10:12.220 --> 07:10:13.220
Sheepie Plier?

07:10:13.220 --> 07:10:15.220
I'll be sick.

07:10:15.220 --> 07:10:25.220
Um, again, uh, thank you so much and don't think I'm not like mad or anything.

07:10:25.220 --> 07:10:27.220
If when you help, I appreciate it.

07:10:27.220 --> 07:10:28.220
Trust me.

07:10:28.220 --> 07:10:29.220
I'm not mad at anybody.

07:10:29.220 --> 07:10:30.220
It's all jokes.

07:10:30.220 --> 07:10:33.220
I just, I get a little toxic when I play Elden Ring.

07:10:33.220 --> 07:10:34.220
It is what it is.

07:10:34.220 --> 07:10:37.220
Guys should have seen me play fucking Counter-Strike.

07:10:37.220 --> 07:10:39.220
Holy shit, bro.

07:10:39.220 --> 07:10:41.220
Oh my God.

07:10:41.220 --> 07:10:43.220
Um, start next stream.

07:10:43.220 --> 07:10:45.220
My name is Sheepie Conplier.

07:10:45.220 --> 07:10:49.220
Hello, my name is Sheepie Conplier.

07:10:49.220 --> 07:10:54.220
You love the toxicity?

07:10:54.220 --> 07:10:56.220
You like Amy Madame?

07:10:56.220 --> 07:10:57.220
It's funny.

07:10:57.220 --> 07:11:01.220
I don't think people would like to watch me rage, but people like to watch me rage.

07:11:01.220 --> 07:11:06.220
I just, oh, it's so funny.

07:11:06.220 --> 07:11:09.220
I need to eat something.

07:11:09.220 --> 07:11:11.220
I need to eat something.

07:11:11.220 --> 07:11:13.220
I need to eat something.

07:11:13.220 --> 07:11:14.220
Actually, I'm not really hungry.

07:11:14.220 --> 07:11:15.220
I'm still a little nauseous.

07:11:15.220 --> 07:11:19.220
I think maybe they'll have some more crackers.

07:11:19.220 --> 07:11:26.220
Ever since I, there's like, like the, these weird knockoff, um, cheese crackers, and I

07:11:26.220 --> 07:11:28.220
smelled them and they made me nauseous again.

07:11:28.220 --> 07:11:31.220
So I kind of don't want to eat.

07:11:31.220 --> 07:11:34.220
Uh.

07:11:34.220 --> 07:11:38.220
Well, there's the water.

07:11:38.220 --> 07:11:39.220
Hello, everybody.

07:11:39.220 --> 07:11:45.220
My name is Sheepie Conplier, and today we'll be playing Elden Ring.

07:11:45.220 --> 07:11:49.220
Top of the order to you laddies!

07:11:49.220 --> 07:11:52.220
I haven't watched Jacksepticeye in the longest time, but he is someone that I should watch

07:11:52.220 --> 07:11:58.220
for this because I know he fucking loves FromSoft games.

07:11:58.220 --> 07:12:00.220
Welcome back to some more Elden Ring.

07:12:00.220 --> 07:12:06.220
I know I need to, I'll just start ripping off other VTubers and YouTubers intros and

07:12:06.220 --> 07:12:16.220
outros and just assimilating them into my own.

07:12:16.220 --> 07:12:18.220
Oh, hi, Whopper!

07:12:18.220 --> 07:12:22.220
I don't know, I can't even do the laddies voice.

07:12:22.220 --> 07:12:25.220
Uh, I'm a little tired, guys.

07:12:25.220 --> 07:12:28.220
I'm a, I'm a fucking Muppet.

07:12:28.220 --> 07:12:30.220
I'm gonna start calling people Muppets.

07:12:30.220 --> 07:12:32.220
You're a fucking Muppet.

07:12:32.220 --> 07:12:44.220
Fia, are you, what are you doing?

07:12:45.220 --> 07:12:48.220
I'm turning EU?

07:12:48.220 --> 07:12:50.220
What do you mean?

07:12:50.220 --> 07:12:52.220
You fucking Muppet.

07:12:52.220 --> 07:12:54.220
I don't say Muppet.

07:12:54.220 --> 07:12:56.220
Muppet.

07:12:56.220 --> 07:12:57.220
Muppet.

07:12:57.220 --> 07:12:59.220
Maybe stalling to talk maybe.

07:12:59.220 --> 07:13:02.220
Does any of you guys want to talk me in?

07:13:02.220 --> 07:13:04.220
I'm like real tired.

07:13:04.220 --> 07:13:06.220
I need to be carried to bed.

07:13:06.220 --> 07:13:12.220
Um, I got this like new lingerie set, not like lingerie, it's more like just like

07:13:12.220 --> 07:13:17.220
from, um, Savage X Fenty, which is like one of my favorite brands.

07:13:17.220 --> 07:13:21.220
It's so comfy, like this is a bra, I feel like I could sleep in.

07:13:21.220 --> 07:13:22.220
It's so comfy.

07:13:22.220 --> 07:13:24.220
I'm squeezing my own boobies.

07:13:24.220 --> 07:13:28.220
Um, and like the underwear is comfy too.

07:13:28.220 --> 07:13:31.220
And then I'm wearing a robe.

07:13:31.220 --> 07:13:33.220
And that's all I'm wearing.

07:13:33.220 --> 07:13:36.220
And then you got my little Muppet body.

07:13:36.220 --> 07:13:38.220
Imagine my little Muppet body in lingerie.

07:13:38.220 --> 07:13:40.220
How does that make you feel?

07:13:40.220 --> 07:13:42.220
I'm tempted to permanently become a Muppet.

07:13:42.220 --> 07:13:46.220
I might just tell Strani, just Muppetize me captain, you know?

07:13:46.220 --> 07:13:47.220
I'm super soft.

07:13:47.220 --> 07:13:54.220
I have like velvety faux rabbit fur.

07:13:54.220 --> 07:13:55.220
Nice you mentioned it.

07:13:55.220 --> 07:14:00.220
It doesn't, to be honest, it still doesn't fit properly because like I just, I think

07:14:00.220 --> 07:14:02.220
I'm just in denial about my cup size.

07:14:02.220 --> 07:14:06.220
I've never been over a triple D, but I think I may be bigger than a triple D.

07:14:06.220 --> 07:14:07.220
So it is what it is.

07:14:07.220 --> 07:14:09.220
It's just really comfy though.

07:14:09.220 --> 07:14:12.220
I think it's because it doesn't have a wire in it.

07:14:12.220 --> 07:14:14.220
And I'm like, it is nice.

07:14:14.220 --> 07:14:17.220
But it doesn't have like, I couldn't wear this with like outside.

07:14:17.220 --> 07:14:19.220
It would just suck.

07:14:19.220 --> 07:14:25.220
It would just like my boobies would be flopping everywhere.

07:14:25.220 --> 07:14:28.220
Just Muppet me the fuck up, bro.

07:14:28.220 --> 07:14:30.220
Muppet the fuck up, bro.

07:14:30.220 --> 07:14:31.220
Muppet the fuck up.

07:14:31.220 --> 07:14:34.220
I think everybody needs to Muppet up.

07:14:34.220 --> 07:14:36.220
Is there anything that they know existed?

07:14:36.220 --> 07:14:38.220
Again, I just have a giant hole.

07:14:38.220 --> 07:14:42.220
So, uh, you with that as you mutt, you wish.

07:14:42.220 --> 07:14:45.220
Well, not as you wish as I wish, if anything.

07:14:45.220 --> 07:14:47.220
I'm in control here.

07:14:47.220 --> 07:14:48.220
Confused, horny.

07:14:48.220 --> 07:14:49.220
Feels strange.

07:14:49.220 --> 07:14:50.220
Ah!

07:14:50.220 --> 07:14:53.220
Are you horny here?

07:14:53.220 --> 07:14:58.220
Or do you like some of my Muppety Muppet body here?

07:14:58.220 --> 07:15:05.220
I have a big gaping Muppet hole just for you.

07:15:05.220 --> 07:15:10.220
Wait, who truly is in control if you're out of Muppet?

07:15:10.220 --> 07:15:12.220
Who the fuck is holding?

07:15:12.220 --> 07:15:16.220
Do you not see my own hand holding up my Muppet body?

07:15:16.220 --> 07:15:20.220
Like you're Jennifer Carly just a Muppet.

07:15:20.220 --> 07:15:23.220
Jennifer Carly.

07:15:23.220 --> 07:15:25.220
Are you scared?

07:15:25.220 --> 07:15:27.220
No, pick your Bible back up.

07:15:27.220 --> 07:15:30.220
I want you to stroke your Bible.

07:15:30.220 --> 07:15:33.220
Really look at the cover.

07:15:33.220 --> 07:15:35.220
Pour over the pages.

07:15:35.220 --> 07:15:40.220
And, uh, I should have covered my Muppet body.

07:15:40.220 --> 07:15:45.220
I have a big gaping Muppet.

07:15:45.220 --> 07:15:51.220
I have a big gaping Muppet.

07:15:51.220 --> 07:15:56.220
I have a big gaping Muppet.

07:15:56.220 --> 07:15:58.220
The temptation of the Muppet.

07:15:58.220 --> 07:16:04.220
Yes, what did you call it?

07:16:04.220 --> 07:16:12.220
Imagine my smooth little Muppet's hands touching your face.

07:16:12.220 --> 07:16:16.220
Imagine my smooth little Muppet's mouth.

07:16:16.220 --> 07:16:18.220
Isn't it you?

07:16:18.220 --> 07:16:21.220
And your lippies?

07:16:21.220 --> 07:16:24.220
I guess now is a bad time to say I was working on something.

07:16:24.220 --> 07:16:26.220
What are you working on?

07:16:26.220 --> 07:16:30.220
You're working on a Muppet for yourself?

07:16:30.220 --> 07:16:33.220
Muppet's gonna feel like a starch sock we're working on.

07:16:33.220 --> 07:16:38.220
I did say earlier, use me like one of your socks.

07:16:38.220 --> 07:16:41.220
Use me like one of your French socks.

07:16:41.220 --> 07:16:42.220
Oh, you'll see.

07:16:42.220 --> 07:16:44.220
Please make this an ASMR role play.

07:16:44.220 --> 07:16:45.220
Are you sure?

07:16:45.220 --> 07:16:47.220
You think this stream is getting demonetized?

07:16:47.220 --> 07:16:49.220
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:16:49.220 --> 07:16:51.220
Like my Muppet-y bobbies.

07:16:51.220 --> 07:16:55.220
You like my beauty mark, my Muppet-y boobies.

07:16:55.220 --> 07:16:59.220
It's pretty nice.

07:16:59.220 --> 07:17:00.220
Oh, you'll see.

07:17:00.220 --> 07:17:01.220
I'm scared.

07:17:01.220 --> 07:17:03.220
What is she cooking up?

07:17:03.220 --> 07:17:05.220
I'm tempted to draw a Muppet smut.

07:17:05.220 --> 07:17:14.220
Smut it, if you would.

07:17:14.220 --> 07:17:19.220
Somebody turn off my computer for me right now.

07:17:19.220 --> 07:17:22.220
It's not the Muppet.

07:17:22.220 --> 07:17:24.220
I mean, it is the Internet.

07:17:24.220 --> 07:17:25.220
You're right.

07:17:25.220 --> 07:17:28.220
Rule 34 exists.

07:17:28.220 --> 07:17:29.220
Learn.

07:17:29.220 --> 07:17:30.220
Learn?

07:17:30.220 --> 07:17:31.220
Learn?

07:17:31.220 --> 07:17:32.220
Lord have mercy.

07:17:32.220 --> 07:17:36.220
Jamie, please tell me you heard of the term Muppet-necking.

07:17:36.220 --> 07:17:38.220
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:17:38.220 --> 07:17:40.220
What is Muppet-necking?

07:17:40.220 --> 07:17:45.220
Is it when you like, nosle someone's neck and you're just like...

07:17:45.220 --> 07:17:46.220
You know?

07:17:46.220 --> 07:17:51.220
How do I save?

07:17:51.220 --> 07:17:58.220
System.

07:17:58.220 --> 07:17:59.220
Oh, look.

07:17:59.220 --> 07:18:01.220
I'm going to quit.

07:18:01.220 --> 07:18:02.220
Yes.

07:18:02.220 --> 07:18:03.220
Six hours.

07:18:03.220 --> 07:18:04.220
Exactly.

07:18:04.220 --> 07:18:05.220
Let's go.

07:18:05.220 --> 07:18:07.220
Six hours, one second.

07:18:07.220 --> 07:18:10.220
Oh, my God.

07:18:10.220 --> 07:18:15.220
From software.

07:18:15.220 --> 07:18:18.220
I can't be controlling the Muppet, but it's the Muppet control me.

07:18:18.220 --> 07:18:21.220
They're just my little puppets on strings.

07:18:21.220 --> 07:18:26.220
They're all puppets in my hair room.

07:18:26.220 --> 07:18:29.220
They're all Muppets in my hair room.

07:18:29.220 --> 07:18:32.220
They're all going to feel like starch socks by morning.

07:18:32.220 --> 07:18:37.220
That's all I'm going to say.

07:18:37.220 --> 07:18:41.220
Muppet-she-be-muppet-get-me-wrung-burn-a-light.

07:18:41.220 --> 07:18:47.220
I've never felt felt like this before, baby Jesus.

07:18:47.220 --> 07:18:57.220
I have a hundred percent cashmere.

07:18:57.220 --> 07:18:58.220
Yeah, I can step down by my...

07:18:58.220 --> 07:19:08.220
I don't have any legs, but...

07:19:08.220 --> 07:19:09.220
I have permission to put my hand up.

07:19:09.220 --> 07:19:10.220
No, only Peepies.

07:19:10.220 --> 07:19:11.220
Peepies on there.

07:19:11.220 --> 07:19:16.220
I didn't know I needed that.

07:19:16.220 --> 07:19:22.220
I hope you are vigorously stroking yourself right now to my Muppet self.

07:19:22.220 --> 07:19:23.220
You better.

07:19:23.220 --> 07:19:24.220
It is a challenge.

07:19:24.220 --> 07:19:25.220
Can you?

07:19:25.220 --> 07:19:26.220
Can you?

07:19:26.220 --> 07:19:33.220
Can you read the Bible to this Muppet boy?

07:19:33.220 --> 07:19:42.220
I want you to...

07:19:42.220 --> 07:19:46.220
You beat your hand inside and you feel something pulling you in.

07:19:46.220 --> 07:19:49.220
It's my Muppet.

07:19:49.220 --> 07:19:51.220
Wait, that doesn't work.

07:19:51.220 --> 07:19:53.220
Muppet-muppet-tussi?

07:19:53.220 --> 07:20:05.220
How do you guys fucking clip in this shit?

07:20:05.220 --> 07:20:07.220
Wait, no, don't do it.

07:20:07.220 --> 07:20:09.220
My mussy?

07:20:09.220 --> 07:20:11.220
My Muppet-tussi?

07:20:11.220 --> 07:20:13.220
Yeah.

07:20:14.220 --> 07:20:17.220
You're gonna read the Bible to Muppet-chibi?

07:20:17.220 --> 07:20:18.220
Yes.

07:20:18.220 --> 07:20:19.220
Yes.

07:20:19.220 --> 07:20:25.220
You cannot read the Bible to anything else besides Muppet-chibi.

07:20:25.220 --> 07:20:32.220
Muppet-chibi is for God.

07:20:32.220 --> 07:20:33.220
Imagine.

07:20:33.220 --> 07:20:38.220
He's getting way out of your hand.

07:20:38.220 --> 07:20:40.220
Your hand, it's up my ass.

07:20:40.220 --> 07:20:42.220
I'm a Muppet.

07:20:42.220 --> 07:20:50.220
I'm a Muppet.

07:20:50.220 --> 07:20:54.220
He has stretched my legies.

07:20:54.220 --> 07:20:58.220
He has piggy hooves.

07:20:58.220 --> 07:21:03.220
I see why adults call out Muppet-muppet day now.

07:21:03.220 --> 07:21:07.220
Shibby please, Shibby please, what?

07:21:07.220 --> 07:21:08.220
Yes.

07:21:08.220 --> 07:21:10.220
Just place it.

07:21:10.220 --> 07:21:12.220
What is your Bible?

07:21:12.220 --> 07:21:15.220
It's in my Muppet-y mouth.

07:21:15.220 --> 07:21:19.220
I promise you that Muppet-y slubby-tubby.

07:21:19.220 --> 07:21:21.220
The Muppet-toppy.

07:21:26.220 --> 07:21:27.220
I'm a Muppet.

07:21:27.220 --> 07:21:28.220
I don't need fucking stuffing.

07:21:28.220 --> 07:21:31.220
Muppets don't have stuff, actually, in my hand.

07:21:31.220 --> 07:21:33.220
In my mouth, you can stuff them.

07:21:33.220 --> 07:21:34.220
I don't know.

07:21:34.220 --> 07:21:38.220
I suppose my Vavity Muppet mouth.

07:21:39.220 --> 07:21:42.220
I can't do my Patreon voice.

07:21:42.220 --> 07:21:45.220
It has to be a higher pitch in order for me to do that.

07:21:45.220 --> 07:21:48.220
My Vavity Muppet mouth.

07:21:48.220 --> 07:21:58.220
You want to make me a starch sock by learning?

07:21:58.220 --> 07:22:05.220
I think I'll let you touch my Muppet-y buttons if you insist.

07:22:05.220 --> 07:22:07.220
Go on.

07:22:07.220 --> 07:22:09.220
Touch them.

07:22:09.220 --> 07:22:12.220
Cut them in your little hand.

07:22:12.220 --> 07:22:16.220
They are soft, are they not?

07:22:16.220 --> 07:22:22.220
I'm made from the finest cotton, harem.

07:22:22.220 --> 07:22:23.220
The Muppet chest is...

07:22:23.220 --> 07:22:25.220
Yes, yes it is.

07:22:25.220 --> 07:22:27.220
I am dead as cannon.

07:22:27.220 --> 07:22:29.220
If you squeeze it, it makes a little...

07:22:29.220 --> 07:22:31.220
Wait.

07:22:33.220 --> 07:22:36.220
I was hoping I had a squeaky toy thing, but I don't.

07:22:36.220 --> 07:22:38.220
That would have been really comical timing.

07:22:38.220 --> 07:22:40.220
Fuck.

07:22:44.220 --> 07:22:47.220
My tentacle is just staring me in the face.

07:22:47.220 --> 07:22:52.220
I don't have anything within reach that can make a squeaky noise.

07:22:52.220 --> 07:22:55.220
Man in a tentacle.

07:22:55.220 --> 07:22:57.220
Coming into the...

07:22:57.220 --> 07:23:00.220
I'm tired.

07:23:06.220 --> 07:23:14.220
Hi, I'm Sheeby Cottonbum, and you're watching VLR Channel.

07:23:14.220 --> 07:23:17.220
Bye-bye.

07:23:20.220 --> 07:23:24.220
Brain shutting down.

07:23:24.220 --> 07:23:27.220
A booba has a squeaker.

07:23:27.220 --> 07:23:30.220
I'm gonna squeeze my own booba, actually.

07:23:30.220 --> 07:23:33.220
Okay.

07:23:33.220 --> 07:23:34.220
This is pay-picking.

07:23:34.220 --> 07:23:37.220
What, excuse me?

07:23:37.220 --> 07:23:39.220
Muppet furry PNGTuber.

07:23:39.220 --> 07:23:42.220
We made a lot of products today.

07:23:42.220 --> 07:23:47.220
Anyways, it's been fabulous, everyone.

07:23:47.220 --> 07:23:50.220
I hope you enjoy today's Elden Ring Strip,

07:23:50.220 --> 07:23:52.220
or I'll see you tomorrow.

07:23:52.220 --> 07:23:53.220
At what time?

07:23:53.220 --> 07:23:54.220
I don't know.

07:23:54.220 --> 07:23:56.220
It'll be a gorilla.

07:23:56.220 --> 07:23:59.220
Ooh, ah-ah-ah.

07:23:59.220 --> 07:24:00.220
Good night.

07:24:00.220 --> 07:24:02.220
And farewell.

07:24:05.220 --> 07:24:08.220
I'm gonna muck-wuck-wuck on you.

07:24:08.220 --> 07:24:10.220
Muppet fidget-tree?

07:24:13.220 --> 07:24:17.220
Thank you, boy, for the T9.

07:24:17.220 --> 07:24:19.220
Okay.

07:24:21.220 --> 07:24:23.220
I guess I'll go now.

07:24:23.220 --> 07:24:26.220
I guess this is where...

07:24:26.220 --> 07:24:28.220
I wish I had one of those, like,

07:24:28.220 --> 07:24:32.220
comical hooks to pull me slowly to the side.

07:24:32.220 --> 07:24:35.220
Excuse you.

07:24:35.220 --> 07:24:41.220
Why is it talking about fucking multiplayer anyways?

07:24:44.220 --> 07:24:46.220
Exactly, Boomi.

07:24:46.220 --> 07:24:47.220
Exactly.

07:24:47.220 --> 07:24:49.220
Farewell.

07:24:49.220 --> 07:24:51.220
Goodbye.

07:24:52.220 --> 07:24:55.220
Now.

07:24:55.220 --> 07:24:57.220
Now.

07:25:18.220 --> 07:25:21.220
Yeah, you still smell pretty stinky.

07:25:21.220 --> 07:25:23.220
Even with my muppet nose,

07:25:23.220 --> 07:25:27.220

07:25:27.220 --> 07:25:29.220

07:25:54.220 --> 07:25:57.220

07:25:57.220 --> 07:26:00.220
Muppet.
