39
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:09,680
close to 15k she be cute no you know you link yeah I just like streaming and

40
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,600
then I have all my stuff done so like I've already recorded some shorts like

41
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,400
my shorts are kind of like backlogged right now because they're like waiting

42
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,320
on editors to finish other shorts I'm trying to think of projects to do in

43
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:30,680
the meantime I might try to record a song cover for Stacy's mom because it's

44
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,040
like I don't really I'm like my growth is stagnated so like I'll just I'll just

45
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,240
like acknowledge that like I'm not performing as well as I want to be and

46
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,640
so I'm just trying to come up with ways to like you know you know have some

47
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,640
grab people's attention and just kind of have them want to stick around and

48
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,000
hang out cuz I realized I just I like I do a lot more streaming and gaming like I

49
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,600
don't do a lot of cute girls doing cute things stuff um and I'm wondering if I

50
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,480
should do more of that I don't know I don't know parody version oh no the real

51
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,440
like a real cover of Stacy's mom a parody would be funny though

52
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,040
hi let me continue I didn't get a lot of sleep last night I'm running on like

53
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:27,720
maybe four hours again um but I'm just like I'm pretty wide awake so my back

54
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,640
hurts um I'm why don't make yeah I was in the dark

55
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Ed will stream wait I need I need to see my schedule cuz you guys know I don't

56
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,640
remember anything

57
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
sorry I'm telling how much I love Mari and Diems cuz she's wonderful and I

58
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,360
can't wait for our collab with Tomah and Chai this week where is my manager

59
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,480
sends my schedule in my discord so I have to I have to look at it oh hi Mari

60
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:31,920
I was thinking Amy's most popular videos of shorts about vTubing um I actually

61
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:39,800
already recorded shorts like that again every all my shorts are on backlog and

62
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,440
so like I've already recorded three scripted shorts to have to do with v

63
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:52,800
tubing stuff hopefully they go they pop off but I'll be honest with you I feel

64
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,200
like there's other like there's very like I know what people like I I've

65
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,560
analyzed I've hyper I've hyper analyzed with my chism um the vTubing vTubing

66
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,880
appeals to vTubers and Amy hits all of those boxes I do not and there are

67
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:25,480
reasons for that one I just don't again I'm not I'm not cute girl doing cute

68
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,840
things I'm kind of just like raging bro and not so many people wanna bro some

69
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,080
people just want like cute dainty feminine energy I have my moments where

70
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:46,120
I do that and then I'm brown and you might think that's not a factor but

71
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,680
definitely is um I have a deeper voice and yes I know Amy has shown her deeper

72
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,880
voice but she mostly voice acts and her voice acting voice is very cute and I

73
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,360
also yes hags are in demand but not as much as people think so like I'm just

74
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,760
analyzing and then she's has she's consistent consistency is key that's

75
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,560
actually one of my shorts is about is consistency she's extremely consistent

76
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,440
and puts out new content all the time I'm learning a lot from her she's been a

77
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,200
content creator for a lot longer than I have and very successful so I've I've

78
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:28,120
um I've definitely been taking notes I want Amy does so that I can kind of

79
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,600
just follow her example and just improve my own content because she's a very good

80
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,760
role model to me my little sister and then like there's those cases that's

81
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,840
like my personality just might not be appealing to people and I can't really

82
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:48,320
do anything about that um yeah that's those are just my observations and then

83
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:57,000
it doesn't help that like that people uh get a wrong idea about me because of

84
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,680
out of context clips so it's it's kind of amusing I'm pretty sure a lot of

85
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,000
people just dislike who I am because of that one clipper just spamming

86
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,160
everything on a certain basket weaving board about my negative opinion on the

87
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,120
some male vtubers

88
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,400
Keejibut having a boy personality she means a cute girl so I know she does

89
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,800
definitely cute girls doing cute things usually hits hard with the shorts

90
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,400
exactly um again I have been working on those but again it's kind of frustrating

91
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:42,000
because I wish we had more editors that were more on top of things some editors

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,600
go super fast some of them go super slow I love that don't talk don't get me

93
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,280
wrong I appreciate the editors and all the work they do because editing shorts

94
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,440
isn't as his work and that's why we pay him for it but I minor minor I think last

95
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,280
in line so I don't even know when mine are coming out but don't let this deter you

96
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,840
we all love you so much you care about you a lot hit so many me she's as

97
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,000
yourself so every moment says yeah yeah she's she's guiding me a lot a lot of my

98
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,080
gen mates give me a lot of advice I'm gonna ask for it strong especially I

99
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,280
have a I should have an ASMR video coming out sometime today and I'm I'm gonna

100
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,680
ask for another one I'm also just learning again I have never been a

101
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,840
full-time content creator I've only ever but it's been like a hobby streamer so

102
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,080
learning what people like and what they want more of like long-form content

103
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:41,080
besides just streaming like like ASMR's and stuff is it's an experience and so

104
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm just like okay you guys want more of this I'm gonna work I'm gonna get more

105
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,360
of this but I need to wait on other people so I can do more of this because

106
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,760
I have like scriptwriters and that's why I'm also trying to fall in follow

107
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:03,320
Amy's example just write my own scripts cuz sometimes it can take a while yeah

108
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:11,400
those are Roblox collab also include harem no maybe I don't know I don't know

109
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,720
if you guys could be on there I don't know I guess I don't play Roblox Mari

110
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,960
is showing me everything I realized really the baby the group when it comes

111
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,200
to content creation it's actually true I have the least amount of content

112
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:32,840
creation um out of everybody everybody has been doing it a lot longer than I

113
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:40,000
have Strani might say oh you have more V2 me experience but not by a much and

114
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,480
actually now that actually really just put things in perspective for me because

115
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:51,080
I do have the least amount of it I've literally it's almost been a wow actually

116
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,520
that thank you for pointing that out to me because all the other girls have been

117
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:05,560
around a lot longer than I have um god damn but yeah no I bingo card I don't

118
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,880

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,800

215
00:30:49,800 --> 00:31:00,720
meme ASMR not that this one isn't gonna be over so I can keep an eye make sure

216
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,960
she doesn't freaking flip off the couch again like the gymnast she is

217
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,120

218
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,800

219
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,720
little girl

220
00:31:49,720 --> 00:32:18,840
Okay, work hard on your homework, Mari.

221
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:46,840
No, that won't happen until the cute model, cute funny model, although I can definitely easily do that now and just make my head super big, my body super small, somehow, I wonder, I just thought of something, what if I, I could probably make my head transparent.

222
00:32:49,720 --> 00:33:10,840
And then give my body as an asset to the other girls to use. Do you think Emmy would be safe on the House of Blue if I just gave her my, but she just, she used my head like a booth model body, my body like a booth model body and she stuck her head on my body. That would be so funny. Or like I see, that would be so funny.

223
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:26,840
That's actually what a hundred, because all I got to do is make my head transparent and then send them the file.

224
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Hi, Bea. Oh, I just want to give you lots of kisses. I can't believe you fucking rolled off the couch. You're silly, you're silly for that. Where are you going?

225
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Feel their cosplaying as me, essentially. Well then imagine, imagine my head on Icy's body. That would be so funny. But like we still have our normal faces. Donate them my worm body.

226
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:32,840
She likes, she loves kisses and belly scratches so much. She's so happy right now. Oh, wait, maybe, maybe I can turn on the camera. Oh wait, no, it's not plugged in. Oh my God, boomie, where the frick did you come from?

227
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Hi, handsome. Give you a smooch too. What are you doing?

228
00:34:42,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Boomie, are you going to go snuggle with Bea in the bed? Are you going to give her kisses? Oh, she's giving you kisses, boomie, she's sticking your leg. Who wants to snuggle? Nope, never mind, she's biting his leg.

229
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Well, she's trying to. Where's the cat girl? I'm a bunny girl. Ignore the cat ears on my blanket. Cat girls are overrated, you know? Bunny girls are the new cat girl.

230
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Bea going after the sweet boy, boomie. What are you doing, boomie? I'm just, he's like walking around my desk and it's kind of funny because he just like squeezed past my 3DO and Bea's just like trying to grab his leg and it's kind of funny because you know, Bea's just like a blob.

231
00:35:51,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Okay. Are the most what? Excuse me?

232
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Hi. What happened to your nose? Oh, did you bonk your nose when you fell? You have a little red spot.

233
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:27,840
All right, something, something Elden Ring, right? Is that what we're doing? Is he wrong? No.

234
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Anyways, Elden Ring. My, uh, I don't know how but Fallout New Vegas rearranged my entire desktop on its own accord. I had things in different places and it totally, when I, when I opened it, it just threw everything around.

235
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Did you know in terms of human to chupacompatibility, bunny chupas are the most breedable and compatible with an enemy? Okay. Let me just E-wink. Let me just E-wink. Let me just E-wink.

Must be that I synced up with Emmy

240
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
You just want lots of attention, huh?

241
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320

242
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840

Fia are you ready to rumble? I feel like you want to turn around so you can face me so you're not here we go

303
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
Is that better for you ma'am?

304
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Yeah

305
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,160
Yeah, Fia's a little tee-fee stick out so it's kind of funny. He's a little bit of an overbite

306
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
And she has some googly eyes

307
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,680
She looks like that cat that crunches stuff sometimes, you know the cat that's like black and white

308
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
And it's like crunches and it goes

309
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,960
And it's like famous on tiktok. That's what Fia looks like to me

310
00:43:51,760 --> 00:44:06,960
She's nibbling on my hand affectionately. What are you doing? I'm giving you belly rubs. Why are you munching on my arm?

311
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,760
Yeah, crunchy cat Luna. Exactly. That's who she reminds me of

312
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,880
She like looks like that cat sometimes

313
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
I can't get my headphones in

314
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
You're snorting over

315
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
Okay

316
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,360
It was a long road, but we're here

317
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,240
Hold on. Okay, everybody posted their links

318
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Perfect

319
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,120
We love it

320
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,120
I'll grab those later

321
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Wow

322
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Okay, we're not fighting mesmer

323
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,120
I can't do it. I'm not strong enough. I don't have the strength to do it

324
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,080
Um, so we're just gonna go run around do other fun stuff because now we're like at the shadow keep

325
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
I'm assuming

326
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,280
If I go this way I can cross over

327
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
Yes

328
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,920
Right do I have to beat mesmer to get to this over here?

329
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
Yeah, I need to get more scada three

330
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,280
Go to the finger man. Who's the finger man? Is it like me to

331
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:45,120
Is a lot I haven't really discovered. Oh my god. Uh, oh, there he goes. Let me be tweaking

332
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,760
Uh, okay, so I'll run around a little bit

333
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
He's honking, um

334
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
How do I

335
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,600
Get across that other bridge. Where is it?

336
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
So on this side

337
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
It is

338
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,880
She's literally like in a totally different spot and I still managed to hear her crystal clear. Um, let me

339
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,200
Get rid of that if I try to click this

340
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,840
No

341
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Uh, I need to I'll do that

342
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,760
La la la I just want to hold on

343
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:59,040
Alrighty where is this bridge I don't see it in the fog

344
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400

Impenetrable thorns fascinating

348
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,640
What the fact that I oh, uh, oh cool nice

349
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,120
Everything's nice and cool. Can I hop down again?

350
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,920
I don't think I'll make that. Okay, so that's the bridge right there

351
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
The bridge is invisible

352
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,640
Jump off here for a spell

353
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,720
Drain the castle what?

354
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,440
What are you talking about

355
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,560
Oh

356
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,480

00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,760

358
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,520
Oh, sorry Fia. I threw a tissue on you. I did not mean to cover you in tissues

359
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Oh

360
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
East door

361
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,000
Spam out spam out spam

362
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,320
How how I should have just ran past these guys. I don't

363
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,280
All right, you know what?

364
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,480
Yeah, we're just gonna run past them because what the fuck is this I'm just gonna waste it

365
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
Papa squat

366
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
What's the spoopy area?

367
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,880
Okay

368
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,840
No, how what you can come in here

369
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
Okay, then come in here then

370
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
And I will outrun you

371
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,720
With my talent and skill

372
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,640
Like so whoop-ah whoop-ah

373
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
I really can't run uphill can I?

374
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
um

375
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,480
I can't look at the map because these motherfuckers

376
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,520
Uh, all right, there's more of them. Ow. I really knew that the guy was gonna jump out

377
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
But I thought he was gonna jump straight forward

378
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,120
And this looks like a play second jump from no, it's not

379
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:07,920
Game is zoomed in a bit you would be correct. Why why why did oh, it's because actually no, I don't know why I did that

380
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
There's a ladder

381
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Fuck ladders

382
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,480
I

383
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
I'm faster if I run up the stairs

384
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,120
No

385
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,080
Ah

386
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
Wrong way too far, uh

387
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Uh

388
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,520
Backward the militia guys are over here

389
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:19,520
There's a ladder I don't see a ladder

390
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh my god, there's so many

391
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
What is happening

392
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
Make it stop

393
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,120
Hiring

394
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,640
Jump opposite where I jumped so not on this side on this side

395
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,480
Ah reina you're pulling my headphones down. Oh wait. I think I see it

396
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Yippie

397
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,560
Nice. Oh, it's wet. Uh, I'm assuming I can't step off, right?

398
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:25,360
Um, I cannot cannot see. Oh, that's cool. We got a little waterfall. I'm gonna keep exploring around the edge

399
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,880
Nope, that's not what I meant. I did not mean to press the roll button

400
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,760
I

401
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
Did not mean to roll

402
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,880
I blame reina if you could see how reina is on my lap right now, you'd be like, okay

403
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,520
Understandable. She's pulling down my headphones. She's leaning against my hands

404
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
I'm gonna blame her

405
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,120
No

406
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,400
Can you sit down lady you're walking all over me

407
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Ah

408
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,640
Oh because he points at the ladder

409
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,120
Oh my god, can I not accidentally step off for the 50th time

410
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,440
I just wanted to look I just want to look around

411
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,240
Is there someone here it's gonna knock me no

412
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,520
Sombra submitting Simone stone

413
00:53:45,520 --> 00:54:04,640
Making my way downtown check the corners the fact that there's no enemies down here is crazy. Okay. That's a dead end. This is nice. Very pretty moat

414
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,720
It's a lot of water. I don't know how our foundations are in this place

415
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:18,240
I think that we'd have a poor foundation for this castle if there's this much water

416
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,920
That's this deep because this is definitely fed from the sea, you know

417
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
Or a lake

418
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:32,640
I know it's back under the first waterfall. I just wanted to peek am I not allowed to peek

419
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,720
Oh

420
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,760
Hello

421
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,480
No

422
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,480
Nice, okay

423
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,560
There's a paint. Oh wait, I swear. I recall seeing this in some sort of um

424
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,280
Thing and walk through

425
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:15,360
This wall looks fake. Oh, I was right

426
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,520
I'm smart

427
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,240
Use a shackle to get ahead of the wall

428
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,520
Are you wanting

429
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:39,440
Too smart the wall just looked freaking weird guys, I'm scared. Well, I don't want to go on a slip and slide

430
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,960
Oh, it's a coffin

431
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,080
Rest in coffin. I'm gonna take a little nappy poo

432
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,480
I am so why am I so tiny?

433
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,160
It's funny because like this is such a bad idea like in a being in a stone coffin in deep water

434
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Just drowning

435
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,120
Getting the coffin she be we're gonna make make mari in it. This is where the fun places. What do you mean?

436
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Why am I so tiny?

437
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,240
I

438
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,520
See like the coffin looks huge suddenly

439
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,800
Spoopy forest this is where the sunflower is

440
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,120
Okay, the music just fucking picked up

441
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,680
Oh pretty

442
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
That's how you wake up every morning

443
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,400
Let's turn on the light for you know reasons

444
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
What this it's like lava

445
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,880
Oh, it's horn scent

446
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,760
Furnace visage. Oh are there uh, oh

447
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,720
Oh, this is where this place is

448
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,080
Oh, and there's two. Yeah, okay

449
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
I want to be super sneaky

450
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,360
There's a lot of golems that one's sleeping

451
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,960
Go touch grass have a good time

452
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,720
Is it gonna wake up even if I'm crouching and creeping towards it?

453
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,520
He's eating

454
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,360
I gotta turn on the golem

455
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,440
Ruins of auntie

456
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,480
Oh, he looks so peace. He's literally sleeping with his mouth open

457
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,920
Oh, baby

458
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Um

459
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
Excuse me, sir

460
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:30,240
I have to move him. I don't want to wake him up. He looks so peaceful. I'm gonna explore a little bit

461
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,920
Yeah, he's just he's just a little he's a big guy. He's just taking a nappy poo

462
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,480
No, it's like a golem graveyard down here

463
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,920
Oh, I guess that's what you get. Oh, um

464
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,400
I kind of wish I saw him wake up

465
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Can you see me?

466
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You can't see me, right?

467
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,400
Uh, I didn't know they could do that

468
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,880
But I'm gonna just back up then

469
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,160
What are you doing?

470
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,960
Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna over here

471
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,160
Oh, I think he's aggroed

472
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,920
Can I summon torrent? I can

473
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,200
I'm just gonna run around the spooky water. There's not another way and I have to wake him up, don't I?

474
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:02,160
You can throw firepots into them. I didn't know that. What are you doing here? Ow

475
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,560
What are you up to?

476
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,440
Okay, what about this little building over here? It looks like there's a couple of dudes doing dude stuff

477
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,440
Ow, I don't know why you guys keep getting the first hit, but that's just how it is

478
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,760

Because I have a hefty

480
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,200
If I throw a hefty firepot will that kill them?

481
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
You

482
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,120
Jumping in the back of the building

483
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,160
What are you doing?

484
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,160
Okay, you just kind of keep spamming that do you run out of fp

485
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
I

486
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,120

487
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,600
hefty volcano pot

488
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,600
That

489
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,560
You

490
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,600
Why do you have so many pots, I don't know

491
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,280
You have to tell me I'm waiting for this guy to chill, but it doesn't seem like it wants to

492
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,280
I

493
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Look like I'm just walking on fire

494
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,200
All right torrent

495
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,360
No torrent you mess it up already

496
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,840
Maybe maybe we don't use torrent. Maybe maybe we just do our own thing

497
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,720
Nah, I'm gonna do my own thing. Oh, is he waking up? Oh, no, that's the other guy

498
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,360
I

499
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,400
How good am I at basketball? I'm terrible at basketball. How am I supposed to throw this at him?

500
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,360
I

501
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,120
Might need to

502
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,480
Oh my god, I don't have a furnace pot

503
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:39,120
I'm really scared. I don't want to hurt him. He's just sleeping. Can I is there a way that I can

504
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,240
Do it without waking him up

505
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,960
He's just a guy

506
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,440
He's just doing stuff

507
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,440
It has to be furnace did you just look it up it has to be a furnace pot

508
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,720
Because I don't know how to make those

509
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,040
Please please google

510
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,360
Pretend it's a lazy harlot

511
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,480
I'm not feeling aggressive today. I I'm feeling lovey

512
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,800
It's got it does the most damage. I don't even know if I have

513
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,080
Um

514
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,600
Oh, there's a spider. What are you doing? How did where did you even come from?

515
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,320
Spider here you can just crawl in my desk here. You just hang out hang out my goal XLR. I can't deal with you right now

516
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,400
I'm doing stuff

517
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:14,560
Do it can I jump in?

518
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
Can I jump in the head?

519
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,320
No, it just pushed me out

520
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,280
It pushed me out do I have to poke him?

521
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,760
He's not waking up

522
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
Oh

523
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,800
Okay, um, well good thing I got a grace for here. Oh, it's so nice and bright

524
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:14,560
There must be another because that person said he walked he just jumped in I wonder if I can climb him. I don't think I can

525
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
Clipping through

526
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,280
Where is the furnace pot? Oh, it's that

527
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,640
I'm gonna see if I can find a way I bet

528
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,440
Um

529
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,000
Because if you don't have that book then they they probably give you an alternative which is jumping

530
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,240
It's in the scorched village. All right, let's just pop over there

531
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:23,440
It's under the bridge in the gravesite plane what?

532
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:34,640
Could be found the rundown travelers rest just north and below the okay, so I have to go below this bridge

533
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880

Because I would I thought you meant under so I was just gonna run and go over here

536
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,960
On the southwest side of the bridge

537
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280

And if you just look so unbothered she's like well, yeah

556
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,760
Let's put that there for now

557
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,880
Boomi gets scared all the time

558
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,840
Because I started to think boomi doesn't boomi speaks perfect English

559
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,280
Because you know I speak to boomi and boomi speaks back

560
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,880
Family which for the cat no, I'm pretty sure when I talk to him he completely understands me

561
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,720
Raina and fia too

562
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000

He's a traumatized man believing best see boomi doesn't listen

565
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,520
That's the thing. He doesn't listen

566
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,600
Alrighty wait, hold on. Why am I playing with mouse and keyboard? What am I doing?

01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,880
Um, but I'm gonna die so it doesn't matter too much

01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,400
I

589
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,560

You have some of my favorite character design in the entire game

596
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:51,920
Because you can see they're modeled after the fire giants you can see from the stuff on his leg. It looks like the fire giant

597
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
How

600
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,600
Make quite a lot of sense to me

601
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,840

How you would able to be able to eat this into his head. What is up with my foot right now?

648
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,280
All right, well we're we're big stepping

649
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,600
Can you please do that attack?

650
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,480
No, not that one

651
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,080
Please

652
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,480
Oh, yes here it comes. Oh, no it isn't

653
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,440
Oh, uh, oh sweet you killed a lot of people that are nearby apparently

654
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,120
Now

655
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,600
I am five health

656
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,240
How am I still alive?

657
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
Please

658
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,440
Is that it is that the attack no it's not

659
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,800
Is it gonna hit me? Oh, it is. Oh, it's over here

660
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,600
You can break their stance

661
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,760
How do you

662
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,440
How do you break their stance?

663
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,280
How the hell do you break one of these stance?

664
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,400
Like I

665
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,440
Six charged heavy attacks. All right, fuck it

666
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,320
I missed

667
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,080
I got him once

668
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
Twice

669
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,080
three

670
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,080
four

671
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,480
Five

672
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,680
I'm not gonna make it bros

673
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,480
Six

674
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,280
I don't think this is working

675
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,960
Oh

676
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,600
What did he fall on the fucking building?

677
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,160
I can't

678
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,560
I

679
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,360
He fell forward onto the building

680
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,240
Do you believe this shit Fia

681
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,760
I have to stagger him twice

682
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,360
He doesn't fully stagger off one break

683
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,800
It's easier on a horse. All right, let's try it

684
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,360
Can I lure him over here so he doesn't

685
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:26,560
Look at this. Oh damn. You see that how my sword just touches the water like that

686
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,880
Oh, okay

687
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Can I hit you

688
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:54,080
By torrent I was trying to jump at the right time it didn't work

689
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,480
Three times

690
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,080
No, no, never mind. I'm not fucking with the fire golem

691
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:21,680
Can I like can I like frostbite proc him? Can I throw some can I can I uh

692
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,400
Can I do a little hit him with a one two?

693
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,040
Can I hit him with the with the frostbite for the frostbizzle?

694
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Can I

695
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,520
I'm coming for you, bitch

696
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,880
I'm gonna get you

697
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,680
Just you wait

698
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:51,280
Uh, just you wait just you just you wait. I was gonna throw it in I was gonna do it

699
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,520
My sword art might count as a heavy

700
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,080
Hmm

701
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:14,560
He just knelt oh, yeah, I saw us knelt but it's a little bit difficult when you're being shot with fucking flames. How about that?

702
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,360
All right, let's try it

703
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,920
I'm actually gonna kill myself

704
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,800
So, so no

705
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,200
No

706
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,680
I'm done I couldn't quit

707
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,320
Nothing matters anymore

708
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,480
I

709
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,040
Watch me just not speak for the rest of the game

710
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,680
What's in here wow

711
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,520
Something I don't care about um

712
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,120
That's probably a place where you can jump into is that little alcove

713
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,360
I

714
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,800
No, I'm over it. I'm over it. I'm not I'm not fucking with those dudes

715
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:19,840
It's no point. I'm not good enough. Where's the other one? What the hell? Where's the other one at you walk away?

716
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,200
I'm throw myself off this cliff

717
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,760
Wow

718
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:38,400
They gave you a grace like this is a very very nice grace of them to give

719
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:46,160
Really unnecessary grace. Uh, they didn't have to do that, but well not unnecessary, but

720
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,920
I did not know that was there

721
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,480
Can I go down there no

722
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,640
Just fucking threw up on me is your reefing

723
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,760
That's too far

724
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,920
I'm assuming I can loop around

725
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:47,520
Beeflings with wings ow, can you guys all right well I guess I'll just

726
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,440
Get away from me no

727
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,320
Just kill me

728
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,760
Got a shiver

729
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,320
Uh, wow my rooms. Oh, I needed those

730
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,560
Um, what the heck? Oh

731
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,760
Okay

732
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,760
Well, I bet I can just drop down

733
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,280
I don't I'm not gonna use torrent because torrent will just fucking kill me

734
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,680
Yep. Oh, thank god for that one

735
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,880
I wonder why their graves in the side

736
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:08,240
Did they ever explain that why are their gravestones on the side of cliffs? Is that is there a lore significance?

737
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,640
Or is this one of the only things in the game that just doesn't have a lore significance?

738
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,200
This is a long way down

739
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,640
Another mausoleum. I haven't even used any of the mausoleums

740
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,440
Oh, I'm almost there

741
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,120
Oh no, I'm fine

742
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,880
Come at me do it. I'll get you I'll get you

743
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,240
I feel like there's something's gonna come out of the ground and kill me

744
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:48,560
Yeah, I'm gonna get you a buggy die

745
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:55,520
What I've always wanted a great dragonfly head. This is nice

746
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:04,720
There'll be hippos in these parts gotta put on just so I can see where I'm stepping so everybody can see me

747
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,720
Is there a grace down here?

748
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:14,560
There's gotta be a grace down here. I see the hippo. Where is the grace down here?

749
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,560
Also dead people in the walls

750
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,560
The fact there isn't a grace down here is very surprising

751
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,960
Yes, I know this has got a tree fragments and the hippos

752
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,160
Probably a stake. Okay. I think I did see a stake of America

753
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,720
So I'm not too worried

754
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,920
I

755
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,920
bow

756
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:52,880
You big no, how did you grab me? I rolled to that. I'm not even in your mouth

757
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,880
Ouch

758
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:04,880
No, no, not the tree. Hold on. I need to heal. I need to heal. Let me heal

759
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,680
Thank you. No, no

760
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,880
No, no

761
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,320
Thank you. No, no

762
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,280
Why do I still feel like I'm so weak? I don't

763
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,440
I feel like I don't do a lot of damage

764
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,960
Ouch

765
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
How the fuck

766
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,520
No, no

767
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,720
No, I'm pressing B. Am I getting like input lag or something?

768
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,120
I'm dead. No, no

769
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,840
But I just feel like I don't do a lot of damage

770
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,160
Please the bios America

771
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,120
Please

772
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,320
Wait, did it let me pick? No

773
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,840
All right. Well, all right. Where is the nearest?

774
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,920
I don't I literally see no gold in that forest

775
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,920
Ah

776
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,440
If I landed in the water would I have lived?

777
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:00,000
Yeah, I feel it. Yeah, that's what it is. I feel like they just have a lot of hp

778
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,920
I went the wrong way

779
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,720
Water is shallow it seems

780
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,800
Wait, where's the thing that was stepped off? Where's the thing?

781
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,600
No

782
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,600
Buggy, I'm gonna catch you

783
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:36,640
I should have made that I could have fallen from that height

784
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:52,160
All right jump attack buggy get caught I missed get come here

785
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,960
Nice

786
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,760
I

787
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,560
Think in the stairs

788
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,200
Dog I think I'm gonna find a grace down here before I fight those because I don't want to have to keep

789
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,840
Oh

790
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:44,800
Can I sorry I'm looking at chat instead of out looking at where I'm going

791
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,360
Let's find a grace

792
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,920
Because there's no stake America is that the moon

793
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,360
Yes, I hear you hippo is that a bore? Oh

794
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,280
Wait what

795
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,960
Is there

796
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:33,040
Magic rocks what is something doesn't look right over here

797
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:46,800
This is a pretty shot wow, it's like I'm in outer space that looks like the Death Star

798
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,480
What does she be doing? I don't know I ask myself that all the time

799
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:58,560
Why isn't there a stake down here? I don't have to keep jumping down

800
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,160
There's two hippos

801
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,680
Wait, what's that?

802
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,400
Okay

803
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:32,400
I'm just not good at games today or any day, but especially today, that's all I'll say

804
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,440
That rhymed

805
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,040
Sorry to wake you

806
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,640
What the hell

807
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,960
Where the fuck am I what the hell

808
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,360
What the hell I don't even know where I'm going I'm just going

809
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,400
Oh, all right

810
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,000
We're just uh, we're just zooming I guess I guess we're just going

811
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,160
Um, it's pretty dark

812
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,600
Not that this helps

813
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,520
There must be a grace down here. Let me grab it

814
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,600
In this catacomb

815
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,160
Let me just grab it just so I don't have to worry about

816
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,680
Where the are you kidding me? All right. Well, I'll just grab the grace down here just because

817
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:10,560
Jesus Christ, I'm getting dizzy. Yeah

818
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,360
I do have new drip

819
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:26,880
Wait, but there's a shiny thing. Why is it so dark? Why is this a horror game?

820
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,920
I

821
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,600
Guys what the fuck is this

822

863
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,640
I'm gonna close my eyes

864
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,600
Okay, I'm here

Are you gonna jump on me?

869
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:08,000
Oh, wow, I knew it. I just couldn't see the guy up top

870
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,240
Oh, what is that? Is that ice magic?

871
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:26,880
Are you this is what I'm talking about. I don't understand how shit can clip through the fucking stones

872
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,880
I

873
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,640
I don't get it

874
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:39,440
It's oh, okay got you I almost fell

875
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:46,240
Because it looked like ice because there was like frostiness about it. Hi

876
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,120
Aren't you dead yet

877
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,040

01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:24,800
At least it looks like a fish head or is that supposed to be a dragon head it looks like a fish

881
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,120
Is there anything oh there's a ladder that's something

882
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
It's a fingernail

883
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:47,440
It spawns under me. Oh, it's like the ambush one. Okay, that makes that makes so much more sense than mine. Okay

884
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,560
I'm assuming this guy is up here

885
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,160
What

886
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,080
Uh, I'm a little confused

887
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,120
Is this just a loop around because I don't want to do that yet I must be

888
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,120
I hear a little guy snoozing

889
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,120
I

890
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,040
Why can't I backstab from the side, huh?

891
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:45,680
Is there another one I feel like I hear something breathing. Oh, it's because it's down there

892
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,440
Nope, nope

893
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,720
I

894
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,400
Dispand our one out of fear

895
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:11,360
And because sad stuff it's not a loop around well, I should be able to loop around

896
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,480
Are you climbing since when can they climb ladders? All right, I'll sleep for you

897
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Take your time

898
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
You

899
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,400

900
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,760

901
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,880

01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,360
This is funny

903
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:14,640
Now I feel like I'm the enemy in a game and that's the NPC I mean the um

904
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:20,480
The main character just like walk up the ladder and I just scare them

I went the wrong way

909
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,240
Ow, I take a long time to do stuff that's not gonna reach you is it

910
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,080
This is stupid

911
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,920
All right, well

912
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:24,480
No, I might die down here

913
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
What

914
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:52,800
I'm going more down. I gotta close my eyes

915
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,880
There might be secrets and I might be missing them, but it's making me dizzy

916
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,320
Oh mother

917
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,400
What the hell

918
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,720
Okay

919
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,760
Oh

920
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:06,960
I am just like sir away for me to get to you

921
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,200
I might just let myself die because then I'd have more flasks

922
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,560
I love my cast time just takes a century

923
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,080
Don't kill him until you lower the platform

924
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:34,400
Oh, but why can't I just kill him then lower the platform

925
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,200
I

926
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,240
Can't frickin see

927
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,320
I

928
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,840
Assuming this is the said platform you're talking about lowering

929
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,560
Hello

930
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,800
Pressing why like whatever. Oh, it's bright in here now

931
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,560
Will that hit him

932
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,800
No

933
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:56,320
Is it because I'm charging the spells that way it's taking so long for me to cast

934
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:22,960
All right, well, I hope it's still there

935
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,880
Hey, but you got him

936
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
It will be gone

937
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,880
Oh, will he be gone? Okay. Nope

938
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:47,040
Oh, what the fuck? Oh, man

939
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,200
I'm gonna get you right in the fucking dick

940
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,840
I already have like three of these

941
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,720
Step my game is lagging

942
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,200
I think that goes anywhere

943
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:46,000
Slow mo is a cool mode. Okay, that was from the platform. That's right. So it's another way

944
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:57,040
It's probably behind him. Yes go behind his platform. I see that wait, but I want to see if anything's over here

945
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
What is

946
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:05,120
It's over here

947
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:09,040
Do I hear any little bitches?

948
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:18,640
I hear bitches beyond the wall

949
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,400
Thought that was a ladder

950
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,680
Ah

951
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:43,360
Something in my nose. Oh, it's funny if it is fell

952
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:47,920
No, nothing to attack me in here

953
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:58,160
Big mom sip he's got a big mouth. How do I get back up?

954
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh

955
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,760

01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:25,200
I missed no, no not like this

958
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,800
How could this happen to me?

959
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:32,160
I made my mistake

960
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:34,240
Yeah

961
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,760
What are you doing?

962
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:53,120
Are you yelling like boomy

963
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,160
It's a baby

964
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:20,880

972
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,160
Oh

01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,600

There's a way to cheese him. I've actually seen it. I just forget what it is

979
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:56,320
And there's a way to cheese him I just totally forget what that is because I remember watching someone fight him

02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:11,680
Ow big fat man, please

1002
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:19,280
Why is it it's like every time he teleports he loses my lock

1003
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,280
Oh

1004
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,720
Please

1005
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,720
Who are you dudes? Oh

1006
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:42,240
Now

1007
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,760
I

1008
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:51,600
Oh

1009
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:13,600
You fucked it up you fucking fuck fuck off

1010
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:20,000
Oh, I didn't see where he teleported to I thought he was behind him still

1011
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:34,320
By the way the large mouth imp that you skipped dropped. Yeah, I already killed him. I already picked that up

1012
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:45,600
I

1013
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:54,320
Don't want to spirit summon. I don't have to

1014
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,200
Now it's not paying attention

1015
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,760
Why can't I

1016
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,480
I

1017
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:23,040
I it's so weird like where I have to be to line up fucking perfectly to backstab his stupid ass

1018
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:30,640
I can do this without spirits or summons. I know I can I already got him halfway

1019
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:38,240
So I know that I can do it by myself

1020
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Yep, I didn't I just take a file

1021
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:05,680
Damn it

1022
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,760
I

1023
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:19,120
Need to figure out where he stands up

1024
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,440
Let me heal these

1025
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:33,200
Why do you have to be against a wall

1026
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,800
Oh my god, so silly

1027
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:46,320
Come on dude, I know I can beat his ass

1028
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,120
Thank you, don't

1029
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:56,800
Yeah, I wish I wish I could be able to stick a little bit off to the side

1030
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,680
It would just teleport me to the spot where I need to be so I can just stab him in the back

1031
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:01,680
I

1032
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:12,960
Know he's like they patched him now. He's up against them all wall more

1033
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:21,840
That has some range to it. I'll tell you that much out. It's a little the stagger fucked me

1034
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,320
I

1035
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,560
Can you stop

1036
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,160
Get get out from behind the fucking wall all for the love of christ

1037
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:48,240
Now

1038
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,280
Ow

1039
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,120
I'm oh, why are you so annoying?

1040
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,600

1041
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:14,480
Oh my god

1042
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:17,040
Oh

1043
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,520
Why he loops around I can't get it right

1044
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:37,520
Where the fuck did he go? No, I didn't mean to lock on you. Oh

1045
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:39,840
I

1046
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,760
I'll be directly behind him and I still can't do it

1047
02:08:58,240 --> 02:09:00,240
I thought I rolled out of the way of that but whatever

1048
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,400
You

1049
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:16,800
Can I get like blood proc like what the hell

1050
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:24,720
This motherfucker with this fucking dude. Oh my god

1051
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:39,440
It's it's not a hard boss. I just have to get the backshot timing, right?

1052
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,520
I'm determined to beat this with no summons

1053
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,720
I have to run over

1054
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:12,640

Oh

1057
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:46,000

1058
02:10:55,280 --> 02:11:01,520
I I am I can't even fucking

1059
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:10,480

02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:31,760
I don't get it

1067
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,520

02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,320

I forgot I need to back up off him

1103
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:18,080
I

1104
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,680
Not this fucking fire summon

1105
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:44,960
Okay

1106
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,200
Oh

1107
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:17,200

Oh

1113
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:08,640
I wasn't paying attention to my health

1114
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:17,920
Oh

1115
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:35,760
What is it locking on the hell

1116
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:47,200
Oh

1117
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,200
Oh

1118
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:47,200
Oh

1119
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:17,200
Oh

1120
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:47,200
Oh

1121
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:17,200
Oh

1122
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:38,480
He is just licking my hand

1123
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,200
Oh

1124
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:17,520
Hey

1125
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:47,200
Oh

1126
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,920
Oh

1127
02:29:37,440 --> 02:29:40,000
Guys if you keep back seating, I'm literally just gonna

1128
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:46,480
Like oh do this do that. I want to be Tim my way. I am not asking for help

1129
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
You guys know when I asked for help

1130
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,560
And it's directional only or if I'm like oh it was a week two which I know is fire

1131
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,800
But I don't really care because I want to get bleed on him now

1132
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
So

1133
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Oh

1134
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:52,560
Yeah

1135
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,840
What fuck is he no

1136
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Oh

1137
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:30,560
Sometimes I just enjoy brute forcing a boss

1138
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:37,280
And that also helps me improve my dodging ability and my timing

1139
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,800
Oh

1140
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:50,960
I'm okay. I'm just gonna I might just let you kill me because I accidentally I was scratching my fucking chin

1141
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:58,240
No, I did that too early

1142
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,560
Oh

1143
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:32,480
You made several comments that have been pissing you off. So just just shut up

1144
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:37,760
I'm just trying to I'm just trying to enjoy myself and brute force this boss

1145
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:42,240
And then some of you guys are just saying really irritating annoying stuff and back seating

1146
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:13,280
No, I keep doing it too early

1147
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:18,480
Oh

1148
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,480
Oh

1149
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,400
Oh, I didn't think that would kill me

1150
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:36,320
It's an awful annoying fight because it's a fight that is definitely winnable without ashes

1151
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:46,320
It's literally like I'm strong enough. I just don't have the timing in the skill and that's what's frustrating me

1152
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:55,360
I just like I like brute forcing bosses it's enjoyable for me, but hey if it's not enjoyable for you to watch then

1153
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:57,520
You don't have to stay and watch

1154
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:00,240
Oh

1155
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:09,920
I thought I dodged that I can't see that well because I moved my chair back. Maybe I should just put it back to where it was

1156
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:21,920
I maybe I should close my window because the glare from the window behind my screen is annoying

1157
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:29,520
You

1158
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:59,760
Oh

1159
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:08,160
Why do you have to teleport away when I start wailing on you?

1160
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:19,680
All right time that too late

1161
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:23,600
If I get like rule up on them

1162
02:35:24,480 --> 02:35:27,120
I need to back off. Nope

1163
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:36,720
Can you

1164
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:43,840
These summons are annoying

1165
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:45,840
Oh

1166
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:00,240
Can I get up please no

1167
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:06,640
Okay

1168
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:15,840
I

1169
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:18,160
I

1170
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,560
I

1171
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,040
I

1172
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:48,160
I'm playing too hasty. I'm not I'm not I'm not biding my time and waiting for my shots. I'll be honest with you

1173
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:53,520
Are you gonna yeah

1174
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,760
I don't think that was gonna hit me but okay

1175
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:16,400
And then I'm not paying attention to my health bro. Why can't I do this? I just don't understand it

1176
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:20,080
I know I can do this. I know I can

1177
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:24,080
I bet if I did off fucking stream then I'd be fine

1178
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:53,120
I

1179
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:08,000
Okay, oh my camera is not stuck so I was adjusting my headphones. Ah

1180
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:12,400
Yeah

1181
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:15,120
Oh

1182
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:23,200
Let me get behind you or not

1183
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:27,840
Let me heal

1184
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:35,200
No, where did he go? Oh

1185
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:45,040
No

1186
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:50,320
No

1187
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:07,680
I honestly might do this off stream because beating this guy on stream is actually annoying because

1188
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:11,440
It's just

1189
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:16,560
Yeah, I'm irritated at my chat

1190
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:24,800
Your eye itches

1191
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:45,280
Hi

1192
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:06,480
Rain I can't see past you rain know you're standing on my hand

1193
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:14,720
Oh my god, I

1194
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:23,760
Why does it it like okay, do I need to like turn auto lock on or something?

1195
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:38,560
Raina you're standing on me in a way you're gonna pull out my headphone. I can't hear so

1196
02:40:39,280 --> 02:40:42,400
I'm gonna pull out my headphones. I can't hear anything

1197
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:50,560
What am I not behind you am I not?

1198
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:58,640
This fat motherfucker

1199
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:13,680
Raina I can't hear anything

1200
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:20,080
You pulled out my headphones and you're laying on them and you have my arm pinned

1201
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,160
This is supposed to be a farming stream and I got fucking distracted

1202
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:34,160
I

1203
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,720
Did our two

1204
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:57,200
Can't hear anything so

1205
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:01,840
I feel kind of nauseous

1206
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:04,160
I

1207
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,120
Rain is purring in my lap. She's gonna make me start sneezing

1208
02:42:14,320 --> 02:42:19,120
I think I might find him a few times on an end stream because I don't really feel like streaming anymore now

1209
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:23,520
Because I'm just irritated and it's not gonna make for a good stream

1210
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:25,680
I

1211
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:35,680
Can I rather just wait until I stream later?

1212
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:55,520
I

1213
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:05,520
Feel like that shouldn't be

1214
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:13,040
There you go, I can't tell where he is because I also have terrible eyesight in this game

1215
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:25,520
I

1216
02:43:53,520 --> 02:44:00,320
I don't think that should have hit me

1217
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Uh, thank you me

1218
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:44,480
You're gonna teleport away, I feel like you will after I hit you

1219
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:55,520
So

1220
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:04,800
You have a cool design though, I kind of quite like

1221
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:07,600
Uh

1222
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:25,200
So

1223
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:53,880
I thought the graves would walk some of the shit, but I guess not

1224
02:45:53,880 --> 02:46:02,920
I don't have my headphones on I can't hear shit

1225
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:22,760
I feel nauseous I think I'm gonna stop playing

1226
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:32,200
I don't know if I'm motion sick

1227
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:23,240
I'll go have fun with strongy playing a painful so see you guys later
