977000	978000	Since I was making a deal
979000	980000	I wrote
980000	982000	A 100 plus page fanfic
982000	984000	About how down bad
985000	986000	I was for Zetsu
986000	987000	From the Akatsuki
988000	989000	Cause I did a self insert

990000	991000	My character
991000	992000	My OC
992000	993000	And every Shippuden episode

1028000	1029000	I also made a young justice
1029000	1031000	Fanfiction that was 80 pages long
1032000	1033000	And I self inserted my OC's
1033000	1035000	Into every young justice episode
1037000	1039000	And I shipped my character
1039000	1040000	Who was
1040000	1041000	By the way
1041000	1043000	Her name was Missy
1044000	1046000	And her last name was Chief
1046000	1048000	And so her hero name
1048000	1049000	Was Miss Chief
1051000	1052000	And she was
1055000	1056000	Or she would also
1056000	1057000	Would get the nickname
1057000	1058000	Pantamime
1059000	1060000	And
1061000	1062000	And she was a shapeshifter
1062000	1063000	That could
1064000	1065000	Temporarily
1065000	1066000	Take on the powers
1066000	1067000	Of who she shapeshifted into
1068000	1069000	That's why she was called Miss Chief
1069000	1070000	Cause she would usually just
1070000	1071000	Fuck shit up
1072000	1073000	I was like mistake
1077000	1078000	Missy Chief
1079000	1080000	Melissa Chief

1228000	1229000	For some reason
1229000	1231000	Very Hattalia axis powers
1232000	1233000	Remember Hattalia
1233000	1234000	Oh my god
1235000	1236000	Hattalia
1236000	1237000	Hattalia
1237000	1238000	Sort of thing
1238000	1239000	Who the fuck is the skinware?
1239000	1240000	It's me
1242000	1243000	I'm Shiboni
1244000	1245000	Shiboni
1248000	1249000	Hogwarts side
1249000	1251000	And it echoed within its empty halls
1251000	1252000	His empty halls
1252000	1253000	Sorry again
1253000	1254000	It's personified
1254000	1256000	The students had all left for the summer
1256000	1258000	And he felt empty and useless
1258000	1260000	Hagrid was often around
1262000	1263000	Reina please
1266000	1268000	Reina what are you yelling about
1273000	1274000	I wish you guys could hear her
1274000	1275000	She's literally just going
1277000	1278000	Reina come here
1278000	1280000	She usually has a toy in her mouth
1294000	1296000	She's aware life is pain
1298000	1299000	What is that
1299000	1300000	Was it
1300000	1302000	Michael Fassbender
1303000	1304000	Oh
1304000	1305000	Like
1305000	1306000	Who is like
1306000	1307000	In
1308000	1309000	In um
1310000	1311000	Like X-Men first class
1311000	1312000	I think he's like
1312000	1313000	Life is pain
1313000	1314000	I can't remember
1314000	1315000	Who says that
1316000	1317000	This is a fanfic
1317000	1318000	I don't know
1318000	1319000	We'll find out
1322000	1323000	Hagrid was often around
1323000	1325000	But he was usually too focused
1325000	1326000	And bizarre animals
1326000	1328000	To fulfill the needs of Hogwarts
1328000	1330000	Professors would pop in occasionally
1330000	1331000	But being in magic school
1331000	1333000	Hogwarts didn't need much upkeeping
1333000	1335000	The little he did need was taken of
1335000	1336000	By
1336000	1337000	Filch
1338000	1339000	He shuddered
1339000	1340000	Causing small trembles
1340000	1341000	Of his halls
1341000	1342000	That was barely discernible
1342000	1344000	Except by the spiders and owls
1344000	1346000	He didn't care much for Filch
1346000	1347000	Wishing he could
1347000	1348000	Or Filch
1348000	1349000	I don't
1349000	1350000	Disclaimer
1350000	1351000	I've never
1351000	1352000	I've only read one Harry Potter book
1352000	1353000	I read the first one
1354000	1355000	If you're a Harry Potter fan
1355000	1356000	I don't really care
1357000	1358000	The books are mid
1358000	1359000	I never put the game
1359000	1360000	It's funny
1360000	1361000	Cause I love fantasy
1361000	1363000	But I never got into Harry Potter
1363000	1364000	I don't know why
1364000	1365000	Well
1365000	1366000	One cause my parents were like
1366000	1367000	It's demonic
1367000	1368000	And then my dad's like
1368000	1369000	I don't fucking care
1369000	1370000	Actually you can read it
1370000	1371000	I'm like alright
1371000	1372000	This is
1372000	1373000	Mid at best
1374000	1376000	I'd rather read something else
1376000	1377000	That's when I was like
1377000	1378000	Up picks up name of the wind
1378000	1380000	Picks up the magicians instead
1383000	1385000	Picks up American gods
1386000	1387000	He shuddered
1387000	1389000	Causing small trembles
1389000	1391000	He didn't care much for Filch
1391000	1392000	Filch
1392000	1393000	I'mma call him Filch
1394000	1395000	Pretty light fantasy
1397000	1398000	Wishing he could walk
1398000	1400000	Without his squib feet
1400000	1402000	Touching his magnificent stone floors
1403000	1405000	He had long since stopped trying to force his floors
1405000	1406000	Open to swallow Filch
1406000	1407000	And miss Nor
1407000	1408000	Miss Nor's hole
1408000	1409000	I don't know any of the characters
1409000	1410000	Besides
1410000	1411000	If he kept it up
1411000	1413000	He would be risking a prolapse staircase
1413000	1415000	And that was no laughing matter
1416000	1417000	The giant squid
1417000	1419000	Saw how miserable Hogwarts was
1420000	1421000	It was true
1421000	1422000	That he also missed his students
1422000	1424000	But for an entirely different reason
1424000	1426000	He missed their terrified screams
1426000	1427000	As he revealed himself
1427000	1429000	Rising from the murky depths of the lake
1429000	1430000	I didn't even know there was a
1430000	1432000	Giant squid in this
1432000	1433000	Fucking series
1433000	1434000	What?
1435000	1437000	Yeah I don't know what they mean by prolapse staircase
1437000	1438000	Don't ask me
1440000	1441000	His huge eyes
1441000	1442000	Stared mournfully
1442000	1444000	At his very large tentacles
1444000	1445000	At one time
1445000	1447000	He had dreams of being an actor
1447000	1448000	The larger he grew
1448000	1449000	Fucking a fucking actor
1449000	1450000	The larger he grew
1450000	1452000	The fewer agents and scouts would come calling
1452000	1454000	Until they finally stopped altogether
1455000	1457000	There wasn't much in the market for a squid
1457000	1459000	That would split a schoolgirl from stem to stern
1461000	1462000	Goddamn
1464000	1465000	I'm a squid now
1467000	1468000	He stared at his tentacles
1468000	1470000	As they moved gently in the current
1470000	1471000	Schoolgirls were out
1471000	1473000	A plan formed in his mind
1473000	1474000	And he swam to the surface
1474000	1475000	Hesitating momentarily
1475000	1477000	Before pulling himself from the water
1477000	1479000	It ran off his rubbery skin
1480000	1482000	As he made his way across the grounds
1482000	1483000	No humans were around
1483000	1485000	To witness the incredible trek
1485000	1487000	And no human would believe his eyes
1487000	1488000	Had he been a witness
1488000	1490000	Hogwarts watched the giant approach
1490000	1491000	Giant squid approach
1491000	1493000	And felt apprehension well up in his kitchen
1495000	1497000	I guess I should give it a British accent
1497000	1499000	What are you doing?
1499000	1501000	The words weren't spoken
1501000	1502000	But they were understood
1503000	1504000	Just trust me
1504000	1506000	The giant squid replied
1506000	1508000	Caressing Hogwarts's
1508000	1509000	Outer walls
1510000	1511000	I'm not ready
1511000	1513000	Hogwarts exclaimed
1514000	1516000	Trying to push the giant squid away
1516000	1517000	With his magic
1518000	1519000	Hogwarts
1519000	1520000	You're lonely
1520000	1521000	I can fix that
1521000	1522000	I'm lonely
1522000	1523000	We don't have to be
1523000	1524000	Besides
1525000	1527000	You can't go around manipulating your staircases
1529000	1530000	You know about that
1530000	1531000	Everyone does it
1531000	1532000	Sort of
1533000	1534000	That's besides the point
1534000	1535000	I've never
1535000	1536000	The temperature within
1536000	1538000	Rose in embarrassment
1539000	1540000	I'll go slow
1540000	1541000	I promise
1541000	1543000	He began to caress a window
1543000	1544000	Teasing it open
1544000	1545000	Hogwarts sighed
1545000	1547000	The fight leaving him
1547000	1548000	He relaxed
1548000	1550000	Allowing the tentacle inside
1550000	1552000	Where it brushed against the inner walls
1552000	1554000	Before settling on the stone floor
1554000	1557000	He fashioned the suction cups to the floor
1557000	1559000	Lifting the tentacle away
1559000	1560000	So that it pulled the floor
1560000	1562000	On the floor without losing its grip
1562000	1563000	Another sigh
1563000	1565000	Swept through the halls of Hogwarts
1565000	1566000	Oh, Merlin
1566000	1567000	That feels so good
1568000	1570000	His rapture tap turned to fright
1570000	1571000	As he fell the tentacle work its way
1571000	1572000	Into a second window
1572000	1573000	I don't
1574000	1575000	Trust me
1575000	1576000	It'll feel good
1576000	1577000	Remember this?
1580000	1581000	Wait, there's 80 pages?
1584000	1585000	You're lying
1591000	1592000	Okay, no, it's only one page
1595000	1597000	Okay, I was like, what the fuck?
1598000	1599000	I'm like, I'm not
1599000	1601000	Reading all of this
1601000	1603000	If um
1603000	1605000	If it's 80 pages
1607000	1608000	Trust me
1608000	1609000	It'll feel good
1609000	1610000	Remember this?
1610000	1612000	He pulled the suction cups a little harder
1612000	1613000	And Hogwarts grown
1614000	1616000	Do that again
1616000	1618000	The giant squid complied as he did so
1618000	1620000	Thrust the second tentacle in
1620000	1621000	Hogwarts shuttered
1621000	1623000	Coming very close to ending the fun
1623000	1625000	The giant squid backed off
1625000	1627000	Unwilling to finish so soon
1627000	1629000	He waited for Hogwarts to calm down
1629000	1631000	Before sending the second tentacle
1631000	1632000	To search the room
1632000	1634000	He felt a need to fill Hogwarts
1634000	1635000	As much as possible
1635000	1637000	And erased another tentacle
1637000	1638000	Caressing his outer walls
1638000	1639000	Running along windowsills
1639000	1641000	And tracing individual bricks
1641000	1643000	So caught up in the blizz
1643000	1644000	Hogwarts didn't even notice
1644000	1646000	The giant squid slipped in a third
1646000	1648000	And a fourth tentacle
1648000	1650000	This is incredible
1650000	1652000	Hogwarts breathed
1652000	1654000	This isn't even the best part
1654000	1656000	He held up his two longest tentacles
1656000	1658000	These can reach further than the room
1658000	1660000	They can go into your hallways
1660000	1661000	I want them in me
1661000	1663000	Are you sure?
1663000	1664000	They're quite large
1664000	1666000	Opera henshin rolled through his kitchen again
1666000	1668000	While he was deciding
1668000	1670000	The giant squid forced another tentacle in
1670000	1672000	You have three tentacles left to decide
1673000	1675000	What happens if I don't?
1675000	1676000	In response
1676000	1678000	The giant squid slid a sixth
1678000	1679000	Into another window
1679000	1680000	Two
1680000	1681000	He simply
1681000	1682000	And with a hint of warning
1682000	1683000	He said simply
1683000	1684000	With a hint of warning
1685000	1687000	Hogwarts could take them all
1687000	1689000	He knew he could
1689000	1691000	What would the other wizarding schools think?
1691000	1694000	Would Boba Tons allow a giant squid
1694000	1695000	To violate her?
1695000	1696000	Certainly not
1696000	1698000	If DermString ever found out
1698000	1700000	There'd be no end of teasing
1700000	1702000	The giant squid grew impatient
1702000	1704000	Slid a seventh tentacle into a window
1704000	1706000	Falled immediately by an eighth
1706000	1707000	One
1707000	1708000	Two
1708000	1710000	Times up
1710000	1712000	And you didn't decide
1712000	1713000	What?
1713000	1714000	But that's not fair
1714000	1715000	Why would this wizard get nuked?
1715000	1716000	This is perfectly normal
1717000	1718000	This is fine
1720000	1722000	This is Hogwarts the building
1725000	1726000	What?
1726000	1727000	But that's not fair
1727000	1728000	It's a simple answer
1728000	1729000	I guess I know
1729000	1730000	Now I'll have to punish you
1730000	1731000	And with that
1731000	1733000	He struck Hogwarts square
1733000	1735000	On the outer wall of a paddle-like tentacle
1735000	1736000	Hogwarts yelped
1736000	1737000	And tried to square it away
1737000	1739000	But the tentacles and his foundation
1739000	1740000	Held firm
1740000	1742000	The giant squid struck him with the other
1742000	1743000	Again and again
1743000	1745000	He spanked the naughty wizarding school
1745000	1747000	Until he sawed for the giant squid to stop
1747000	1748000	And still
1749000	1750000	He spanked
1750000	1752000	This makes me feel funny in my bathroom
1753000	1754000	You like my outfit?
1755000	1756000	Good
1756000	1757000	You better
1758000	1759000	I dressed up
1759000	1760000	All nice and pretty
1760000	1761000	For myself, not for you
1761000	1762000	You thought this was for you
1763000	1764000	Baka
1764000	1766000	Don't do anything for you
1767000	1768000	The giant squid finally stopped
1768000	1769000	But Hogwarts didn't have time
1769000	1770000	For reprieve before the giant squid
1770000	1772000	Forced his extra-long
1772000	1775000	Spanking tentacles into two separate windows
1775000	1776000	They slipped through the room
1776000	1777000	And forced the doors open
1777000	1780000	The pain only adding to Hogwarts' pleasure
1780000	1782000	The tentacles were in the hall now
1782000	1783000	Massaging the long stone
1783000	1784000	Tunnels
1784000	1785000	This was incredible
1785000	1786000	The giant squid thought
1786000	1787000	He really should have done this
1787000	1788000	At ages ago
1789000	1790000	Every tentacle was in a different window
1790000	1791000	No school girl
1791000	1793000	No matter how many movies she made
1793000	1794000	Could hold all tentacles
1794000	1796000	At ten tentacles at once
1799000	1800000	Each one moved differently
1800000	1801000	And with a different pace
1801000	1802000	Driving Hogwarts crazy
1802000	1804000	With the inability to match his speed
1805000	1807000	I'm just waiting to get a raid
1807000	1809000	Or someone like I know come in
1809000	1810000	And be like, hey, what are you?
1810000	1811000	Oh, God
1813000	1814000	He felt that familiar feeling
1814000	1816000	And doubled his efforts
1816000	1819000	Ink exploded all over Hogwarts
1819000	1821000	Some finding its way into the windows
1821000	1823000	He unified his tentacles
1823000	1825000	With the ability to match his speed
1825000	1826000	I'm just waiting to get a raid
1826000	1827000	Or someone like I know come in
1827000	1828000	And be like, hey, what are you?
1828000	1829000	Oh, God
1830000	1831000	He felt that familiar feeling
1831000	1833000	And doubled his efforts
1833000	1834000	And unified his tentacles
1834000	1837000	Somewhat completely unified
1837000	1839000	Can we focus on Hogwarts?
1839000	1840000	He must be close
1840000	1841000	Then it happened
1841000	1843000	Water shot of a faucet
1843000	1844000	Toilets overflowed
1844000	1845000	And bread set in ovens
1845000	1847000	To keep warm by thoughtful house elves
1847000	1848000	Exploded
1848000	1849000	Hogwarts shook violently
1849000	1850000	Into his foundations
1850000	1852000	Rousing filled from bed
1852000	1853000	And sitting house elves
1853000	1855000	And Mrs. Norris scrambling for cover
1855000	1857000	Even Hagrid heard the groan
1857000	1859000	Of stone and came running
1860000	1862000	They searched around the castle
1862000	1863000	And through the castle
1863000	1865000	But found no sign of intruders
1865000	1867000	Most perplexing was the stinky ink
1867000	1869000	On one side of the castle
1869000	1871000	Hagrid peered to the dark
1871000	1872000	Towards the lake
1872000	1873000	But was unable to see the ripples left
1873000	1875000	In the wake of the giant squid
1875000	1877000	The giant squid slipped beneath the waves
1877000	1879000	Wanting to grin even though
1879000	1880000	His beak was incapable
1880000	1882000	He anticipated a very short summer
1882000	1884000	Before the professors and students returned
1884000	1886000	So he had better make the most of it
1887000	1889000	And seen
1892000	1893000	That was it
1893000	1895000	That was a first encounter
1895000	1896000	By a
1902000	1904000	Lyrus Malachi
1906000	1908000	Sorry, Fia is also meowing
1908000	1910000	What is going on guys?
1910000	1911000	What you mean by that?
1911000	1912000	I don't know
1912000	1913000	I don't know
1913000	1914000	I don't know
1914000	1915000	Come on guys
1915000	1917000	What you meowing about?
1931000	1933000	Yeah, I was hoping some of you guys
1933000	1935000	Would have written me some cringe fanfictions
1935000	1937000	Of me and the girls
1937000	1939000	Or me and
1939000	1941000	A harem
1941000	1943000	A harlot
1943000	1944000	No
1944000	1945000	Shook my
1945000	1946000	Shook my
1946000	1947000	Foundations
1947000	1949000	I'll tell you what
1949000	1951000	Cringe but Kino
1953000	1955000	Yeah, a singular
1955000	1957000	Member of the harem
1957000	1959000	Is called a harlot
1959000	1961000	Or a harlot
1962000	1964000	I can't write good
1964000	1966000	That's the whole point
1966000	1967000	Just wait
1967000	1969000	Just wait till I read my immortal guys
1970000	1972000	I was disappointed
1972000	1974000	There was no line as memorable as
1974000	1976000	Hold on tight spider monkey
1976000	1977000	Different franchise
1977000	1979000	But understood
1981000	1983000	Okay, let's go to the next one
1984000	1986000	I'm going to turn off my BGM
1986000	1988000	Because I'm going to put on some Hogwarts related music
1993000	1996000	Wait, I don't think I have the donation stuff on here
1996000	1997000	Hold on

2024000	2026000	Thank you bun for the tip
2026000	2028000	I vastly underestimated the level of
2028000	2029000	Cringe you desired
2029000	2031000	I have to recalibrate all systems
2031000	2032000	Precisely

2035000	2036000	Okay, let me see

2101000	2103000	I know you don't need me

2142000	2144000	Yes, it is named after the
2144000	2146000	Evanescent song
2146000	2147000	It's a bit loud
2148000	2150000	Half the text in blue is because

3020800	3024640	My coffin was black ebony and inside was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends
3025280	3030560	I got on my coffin and took off my giant and I'm gonna say I'm not gonna correct anything that she says
3030560	3036640	And I took off my giant mcr t-shirt, which I use for pajamas
3037920	3042720	Instead I put on black leather dress a pentagram necklace combat boots and black fishnets on
3043120	3047520	I put on four pairs of earrings and my pierced ears and put my hair in kind of a messy bun
3048320	3050320	My friend willow
3050560	3053440	This is like Irel friend woke up and then grinned at me
3053840	3058880	She flipped her long waist length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her four screen eyes
3059440	3064000	She put on her maryland manson t-shirt with a black mini fishnets pointy hide-heeled boots
3064960	3067760	We put on her makeup black lipstick without foundation and black eyeliner
3069120	3072640	I'm just gonna use my normal voice for willow because she doesn't show up too much
3073920	3080480	Oh my fucking god, I saw you talking to drago mouthful yesterday. She said excitedly. Yeah, so I said blushing
3082000	3083520	Do you like drago?
3083520	3087920	She asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into of course their Slytherin and into the gray hall
3088640	3090640	No, I so fucking don't
3091280	3093280	Yeah, right. She exclaimed
3093840	3095840	Just then drago walked up to me
3096720	3098720	Hi, he said
3098880	3100880	Hi, I replied
3101520	3102880	alertly

3123200	3126320	Well, do you want to go with me he asked I gasped
3129680	3131680	I'm not gonna read all the office notes
3134240	3138000	On the night of the concert I might just read like the exposition in my normal voice
3138720	3142000	On the night of the concert I put on my black lace up boots with high heels
3142480	3146080	God fucking damn she she has to tell you how well she dresses
3146480	3148160	Underneath them are ripped red fishnets
3148240	3151760	Then I put on a black leather mini dress with all this corset stuff on the back and the front
3152240	3154240	I put on matching fishnet on my arm
3154720	3160800	Arms I straightened my hair and made it look all spiky. I felt a little depressed. So then I slit one of my wrists
3162000	3166080	I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding and I listened to this gc
3166640	3169440	I painted my nails black and put on tons of black eyeliner
3170320	3173840	Then I put on some black lipstick. I didn't put on fedation because I was pale anyways
3174320	3176880	I don't know what happened to the rest of the time before that, but okay
3177200	3179700	I drank some human blood. So I was ready to go to the concert

3255600	3258640	On the way we listened excitedly to good charlotte and maryland manson
3258880	3261200	We both smoked cigarettes and drugs
3261840	3263920	When we got there we both hopped out of the car
3264560	3268400	We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to good charlotte
3269920	3271920	We smoked some drugs

3305200	3307200	Suddenly drago looks sad
3307200	3310480	What's wrong? I asked his mom to the music then I caught on

3984120	3990120	They were having sexual intercourse in the forbidden forest I'm sorry I'm like goofy

4041120	4044120	Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall still looked mad but Professor Snape said
4044120	4048120	Fine very well
4048120	4051120	You may go up to your rooms
4053120	4054120	Snape never sleep

4063120	4065120	Draco asked me gently
4065120	4067120	Yeah I guess
4067120	4068120	I lied
4068120	4071120	I went to the girls dorm and brushed my teeth and my hair
4071120	4075120	And chained into a low-cut black floor-length dress with a red lace all around and black high heels
4075120	4079120	Iha when I came out of the closet
4080120	4082120	Draco was standing in front of the bathroom and he started to sing
4082120	4084120	I just want to live by Good Charlotte
4084120	4087120	I was so flattered even though he wasn't supposed to be there
4087120	4088120	We hugged and kissed
4088120	4092120	After that we said good night and he reluctantly went back to his room
4094120	4097120	You know Demwell Snape got the victory secret though
4097120	4100120	That's not a song
4101120	4104120	I'm so scared of that
4104120	4106120	I'm really really
4110120	4113120	Sorry Eric we're covering your face
4115120	4117120	The next day I woke up in my coffin
4117120	4119120	I put on a black many skirt
4119120	4121120	Many skirt that was all ripped around the end
4121120	4123120	And a matching top with red skulls all over it
4126120	4127120	And high heeled boots
4127120	4128120	Sorry I was making that again
4128120	4129120	That were black
4129120	4132120	I put on two pairs of skull earrings and two crosses in my ears
4132120	4134120	I spring painted my hair with purple
4134120	4138120	In the great hall I ate some Count Chocula cereal
4139120	4141120	With blood instead of milk
4141120	4143120	And a glass of red blood
4144120	4146120	Suddenly someone bumped into me
4146120	4148120	All the blood spilled over my top
4148120	4149120	Faster
4150120	4151120	I shouted angrily
4151120	4152120	I regretted saying it
4152120	4153120	Cause when I looked up
4153120	4156120	I was looking to the pale white face of a gothic boy
4156120	4158120	The spiky black hair with red streaks in it
4158120	4160120	Who could it be
4161120	4164120	He was wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down to his fate
4164120	4166120	I was going down his face
4166120	4167120	And he was wearing black lipstick
4167120	4169120	He didn't have glasses anymore
4169120	4171120	And now he was wearing red contact lenses just like Draco's
4171120	4173120	There was no scar on his forehead anymore
4173120	4175120	He had manly stubble on his chin
4175120	4177120	He had sexy English accent

4329120	4330120	Why
4330120	4331120	I exclaimed

4343120	4345120	We sat down to talk for a while
4345120	4346120	The dragon came up behind me
4346120	4347120	And told me he had a surprise for me
4347120	4348120	So I went away with him
4350120	4352120	I know I didn't do the
4353120	4355120	Because I love the taste of human blood
4360120	4362120	And I'll kill him again

4601120	4603120	Alright chapter 7
4606120	4608120	Draco and I held our pale white hands
4608120	4610120	With black nail polish as we went upstairs
4610120	4612120	I was wearing red satanist sings
4612120	4614120	Not signs, sings
4614120	4616120	On my nails in red nail polish
4617120	4619120	I don't know how you can wear red

4631120	4633120	We dark over here
4636120	4638120	I waved to vampire
4638120	4640120	Dark misery was in his depressed eyes
4640120	4642120	I guess he was jealous of me
4642120	4644120	That I was going out with Draco
4644120	4646120	Anyway I went upstairs excited with Draco
4646120	4648120	We went to his room and locked the door
4648120	4650120	Then we started Frenching passively
4650120	4653120	And we took off each other's clothes enthusiastically
4653120	4656120	He felt me up before I took off my top
4656120	4658120	Then I took off my black leather bra
4658120	4659120	That doesn't sound comfortable
4659120	4661120	And he took off his pants
4661120	4662120	We went to the on the bed
4662120	4664120	And started making out naked
4664120	4666120	And then he put his boys thingy in mind
4666120	4668120	And we had sex
4668120	4670120	Oh Draco! Draco!
4670120	4671120	I screamed
4671120	4672120	Well getting an hour
4672120	4673120	Ow I just hit my arm
4673120	4674120	Just getting an orgasm
4674120	4675120	When all of a sudden I saw a tattoo
4675120	4677120	I had never seen before in Draco's arm
4677120	4679120	It was a black heart with an arrow through it
4679120	4682120	On it and bloody gothic writing were the words
4682120	4684120	Vampire?
4685120	4686120	I was so angry
4686120	4688120	You bastard!
4688120	4689120	I shouted angrily
4689120	4691120	Jumping out of the bed
4691120	4693120	No no you don't understand
4693120	4694120	Draco pleaded
4694120	4695120	But I knew too much
4695120	4697120	No you fucking idiot I shouted
4697120	4699120	You probably have AIDS anyway
4702120	4704120	I put on my clothes all huffily
4704120	4705120	And then stomped out
4705120	4707120	Draco ran out even though he was naked
4708120	4710120	Had he had a really big you know what
4710120	4711120	But I was too mad to care
4711120	4713120	I stomped out and did so
4713120	4715120	Until I was in Vampire's classroom
4715120	4717120	Draco was having a lesion with Professor Snape
4717120	4719120	And some other people
4721120	4723120	Vampire Potter you motherfucker
4723120	4725120	I yelled
4726120	4728120	Hold on
4728120	4730120	I'll tell you
4730120	4732120	When was my immortal
4734120	4736120	Written
4741120	4743120	It was
4743120	4745120	Published in serial installments
4745120	4746120	On fanfiction.net
4746120	4749120	Between 2006 and 2007
4749120	4751120	Holy crap
4756120	4758120	You think they'd be careful with anything blood to blood
4758120	4760120	Because they're off their second blood
4760120	4762120	They're vampires so I don't even
4762120	4764120	I don't think they would even apply to them
4765120	4767120	Ffff
4771120	4773120	I should read a Twilight fanfiction
4773120	4776120	The fact that 50 shades was a first at Twilight Fiction
4778120	4780120	It always throws me off
4781120	4783120	Damnit fucking Eric
4785120	4787120	Fuck you

4876260	4884260	Her real parents are vampires, and one of them is a witch, but Voldemort killed her mother and her father, committed suicide because he was depressed about it.
4884260	4887260	She still has nightmares about it, she's very haunted and depressed.
4887260	4890260	It also turns out her real last name is Smith, the knockranger.
4890260	4895260	Since she has converted to Satanism, she is in slithering now, knockriffin door.
4895260	4901260	What is it that you desire, you ridiculous dimwit?
4901260	4905260	Snaped demeaned angrily in his cold voice, but I ignored him.
4906260	4909260	Vampire, I can't believe you cheated on me with Draco!
4910260	4913260	I shouted at him. Everyone gasped.
4913260	4920260	Wait, but she's not dating vampire, so technically, I can't believe Draco cheated on me with you is what she should have said.
4921260	4927260	This is the least e-real, you would be surprised, just you wait what Snape gets up to.
4927260	4931260	Oh, it's gonna be a lot like class of 09.
4931260	4933260	Spoiler alert.
4934260	4936260	Um...
4937260	4940260	I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.
4940260	4941260	What?
4945260	4946260	Wait, so...
4947260	4949260	Why did I... am I...
4951260	4956260	Oh, is this from Draco's perspective?
4958260	4959260	No.
4960260	4967260	Okay, I got sorry, I lost, I kinda lost the plot for a moment. I'm just gonna read it.
4969260	4971260	I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.
4971260	4974260	I had went out with vampire, I'm bi, so as Ebony.
4974260	4976260	For a while, but then he broke my heart.
4976260	4980260	He dumped me because he liked Brittany, a stupid preppy fucker.
4980260	4985260	We were just good friends now, he had gone through horrible problems, and now he was gothic.
4985260	4987260	Haha, like I would hang out with a prep.
4989260	4992260	But I'm not going out with Draco anymore.
4992260	4993260	Says vampire.
4993260	4996260	Yeah, fucking right, fuck off you bastard.
4996260	4997260	I screamed.
4997260	5001260	I ran out of the room and into the forbidden forest where I had lost my rarality.
5003260	5009260	My rarality, yep, rarality to Draco, and I started to bust into tears.
5010260	5013260	I'm not under the Draco still not wearing anything.
5016260	5018260	Yeah, what is this, the Bible?
5018260	5020260	Haha, this is my Bible.
5022260	5026260	I was so mad and sad, I couldn't believe Draco for cheating on me.
5026260	5029260	I began to cry, I cranced the tree when I did it with Draco.
5029260	5031260	That's pretty hardcore.
5031260	5035260	I'm trying to actually know exactly which tree that they did, you know what,
5035260	5039260	where he stuck his, you know what in her, you know what.
5041260	5047260	Then all of a sudden, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick.
5048260	5051260	He didn't have a nose, basically Voldemort in the movie.
5051260	5054260	He was wearing all black but it was obvious he wasn't gothic.
5054260	5056260	It was Voldemort?
5057260	5061260	No, I shouted in a scared voice but then Voldemort shouted.
5062260	5065260	What voice, what voice for Voldemort?
5066260	5071260	Actually he has, he says vow a lot, so I might just give him a...
5072260	5074260	I might just give him a birch accent.
5075260	5077260	Imperius?
5077260	5079260	And I couldn't run away.
5079260	5080260	Croc shanks!
5080260	5084260	I shouted at him, Voldemort fell off of his broom and started to scream.
5084260	5087260	I felt bad for him even though I'm a sadist, so I stopped.
5088260	5092260	Abony, he yelled, vow must kill vampire potter.
5093260	5099260	I thought about vampire in his sexy eyes and his gothic black hair and how his face looks just like Joel Madden.
5100260	5103260	I remember that Draco had said I didn't understand so I thought,
5103260	5107260	what if Draco went out with vampire before I went out with him and they broke up?
5107260	5109260	No, Voldemort!
5109260	5112260	I shouted back, Voldemort gave me a gun.
5123260	5125260	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
5130260	5133260	Voldemort gave me a gun.
5138260	5140260	Voldemort gave me a gun.
5145260	5147260	No, please, I begged.
5147260	5152260	Thou must heal, if thou dost not, then I shall kill thy beloved Draco.
5155260	5156260	How did you know?
5156260	5158260	I asked in a surprised way.
5158260	5161260	Voldemort got a dude yourself.
5163260	5164260	Look on his face.
5165260	5167260	I have a telekinesis.
5167260	5168260	He answered cruelly.
5169260	5174260	And if you dost not kill vampire, then thou not know what will happen to Draco.
5174260	5175260	He shouted.
5175260	5177260	Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.
5178260	5181260	I was so scared, mad, I didn't know what to do.
5181260	5183260	Suddenly Draco came into the woods.
5183260	5185260	Draco, I said, hi!
5186260	5187260	Hi.
5187260	5189260	He said back, but his face was all sad.
5189260	5192260	He was wearing white foundation and messy eyeliner.
5192260	5194260	Kind of like a pentagram, get it?
5194260	5197260	Between gold, instead of a cross, it's a pentagram.
5197260	5199260	So like a sort of a cross between, it's a pentagram.
5199260	5202260	It took me forever to figure that out the first time I ever read this.
5203260	5205260	Between Joel Madden and Jared Way.
5206260	5207260	Are you okay?
5207260	5208260	I asked.
5209260	5211260	No, he answered.
5212260	5215260	I'm sorry, I got all mad at you, but I thought you cheated on me.
5215260	5216260	I expelled.
5219260	5220260	I hope it's a teagle.
5223260	5224260	That's okay.
5224260	5225260	I'm sorry.
5225260	5226260	That's okay.
5226260	5227260	He said all depressed.
5227260	5229260	And we went back to Hogwarts together, making out.
5229260	5231260	Alright, this is a toxic relationship.
5242260	5243260	Chapter 10.
5243260	5245260	It's a lot of making out, yeah.
5252260	5256260	I was really scared about Vlad and Mort all day.
5256260	5257260	I was even upset.
5257260	5262260	Went to rehearsals with my gothic metal band Bloody Gothic Rose 666.
5262260	5264260	I'm the lead singer of it and I play a guitar.
5264260	5268260	People say that we sound like a cross between GC, Slipknot and MCR.
5268260	5273260	The other people in the band are Bloody Mary, Vampire, Draco, Ron.
5273260	5276260	Although we call him Diabolo now.
5277260	5280260	He is black hair now with blue streaks in it.
5281260	5282260	And Hagrid.
5283260	5285260	This is a loaded band.
5286260	5289260	Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed.
5289260	5292260	So they weren't coming and we wrote songs instead.
5292260	5295260	I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists.
5296260	5298260	He wouldn't die because he was a vampire too.
5298260	5302260	And the only way you can kill a vampire is with a C-R-O-S-S.
5302260	5304260	There's no way I'm writing that.
5305260	5307260	Or a steak like the food.
5308260	5311260	Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.
5313260	5319260	I put on a black leather shirt that showed off my boobs in a tiny matching mini skirt that said simple plan on the butt.
5319260	5322260	You might think I'm a slut, but I'm really not.
5326260	5329260	Hagrid kind of gives grimmer vibes being in this band.
5329260	5332260	So he's like the chaperone, he's hanging out.
5334260	5339260	We were singing in cover of Helena and at the end of the song I suddenly bust into tears.
5342260	5344260	What voice did I give her?
5346260	5348260	What voice did I give Bloody Mary?
5349260	5351260	What voice did I give Hermione?
5351260	5352260	Oh no, I never gave her a voice.
5352260	5354260	I also gave her a normal British girl voice.
5355260	5357260	Ebony, are you okay?
5358260	5359260	Ebony?
5359260	5361260	Ebony, are you okay?
5361260	5363260	Ebony, are you okay?
5363260	5365260	Bloody Mary asked in a concerted voice.
5366260	5368260	What the fuck do you think? I asked angrily.
5368260	5373260	And then I said, well Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry.
5373260	5375260	But I don't want to kill him because he's really nice.
5375260	5380260	And even if he did go with Draco, but if I don't kill Harry, then Voldemort will fucking kill Draco.
5380260	5382260	I burst into tears.
5382260	5384260	Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind the wall.
5385260	5387260	Why didn't you fucking tell me?
5387260	5388260	He shouted.
5388260	5389260	How?
5389260	5393260	How could you fucking poser muggle bitch?
5394260	5396260	Jesus fuck.
5396260	5398260	He just called me a slur.
5398260	5400260	I started to cry and cry.
5400260	5402260	Draco cried too all sensitive.
5402260	5404260	Then he ran out crying.
5405260	5406260	We practiced for it.
5406260	5409260	See, like, whoa, chill with the M word.
5409260	5411260	I know, that was, I'm so sorry I said that.
5411260	5414260	That was, that was a hard M.
5414260	5417260	That was a hard, I, I feel really awful to say that.
5417260	5419260	I'm not gonna lie to you.
5421260	5423260	Especially when you add like bitch after it.
5423260	5425260	Or like really just does it.
5425260	5427260	Oh yeah, I still have the gun in my hand.
5427260	5430260	Let me just put that away real quick.
5430260	5432260	Remember the gun is still on my person.
5436260	5437260	Practiced for a more hour.
5437260	5439260	Then suddenly Dumbledore walked in angrily.
5439260	5443260	His eyes were all fiery and I knew that this time it wasn't because he had a headache.
5445260	5449260	Cowboy voice, let me think.
5452260	5454260	What have you done?
5454260	5456260	He started to cry wisely.
5456260	5461260	See, that's basically not swearing and this time he was really upset and you will see why.
5461260	5462260	Ebony.
5462260	5464260	Draco has been found in his room.
5464260	5467260	He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.
5468260	5473260	You guys think I'm gonna get monetized?
5476260	5478260	Wait hold on, let me check my email.
5480260	5482260	Clearly I was trying to get monetized.
5494260	5496260	Yeah, I'm thinking not.
5497260	5498260	What?
5505260	5507260	Still says in progress.
5507260	5509260	Shout out to the person that got me a fidget toy.
5509260	5511260	You are amazing.
5511260	5514260	Hold on, I just realized.
5517260	5520260	Don't have my headphones on to see donuts again.
5522260	5524260	Let me see if anybody...
5528260	5531260	Harim, remember to buy your heat suppressors.
5531260	5534260	Thank you, Anonymous, for that tip.
5534260	5537260	Thank you for the tip and the other tip.
5539260	5541260	She's autistic?
5543260	5545260	Don't worry, don't read ahead.
5545260	5547260	Don't read ahead.
5548260	5549260	Stop.
5550260	5552260	It's still in progress.
5552260	5556260	I wonder if any of the other girls got monetization yet?
5556260	5557260	I don't know.
5587260	5591260	I got out of the bathtub and I put on a black low cut dress with lace all over it sandly.
5591260	5596260	I put on black heels with pink metal stuff on the ends and six pairs of skull earrings.
5596260	5598260	I got more piercings, guys.
5598260	5600260	I couldn't fucking believe it.
5600260	5602260	Then I looked out the window and screamed.
5602260	5609260	Snap was spying on me and he was taking a videotape of me and Lupin was masticating to it.
5609260	5611260	They were sitting on their broomsticks.
5611260	5614260	Ew, you fucking perv, stop looking at me naked.
5614260	5616260	Are you paddles or what?
5616260	5619260	I screamed putting on a black towel with a picture of Marilyn Manson on it.
5619260	5621260	Suddenly a vampire ran in.
5624260	5626260	Abracadabra!
5626260	5628260	He yelled, holy crap.
5628260	5631260	There was a giant SB that just flew into my window.
5631260	5633260	He was just eating, he was eating.
5637260	5640260	He yelled at Snape and Lupin pointing his womb.
5640260	5642260	I took my gun.
5642260	5643260	Hold on.
5646260	5648260	I took my gun.
5654260	5656260	And I, what did I do?
5659260	5662260	And I shot Snape and Lupin a gazillion times.
5665260	5668260	They both started screaming and the camera broke.
5668260	5670260	Suddenly Dumbledore ran in.
5671260	5672260	Ebony.
5672260	5674260	It has been revealed that someone has.
5674260	5676260	No!
5676260	5680260	He shouted looking at Snape and Lupin and then he waved his wand and suddenly
5680260	5684260	Hargrid ran outside on his broom and said everyone we need to talk.
5685260	5687260	What do you know Hargrid?
5687260	5689260	You're just a little Hogwarts student.
5689260	5691260	I don't know who is speaking.
5691260	5694260	What's had a Cagrin's voice?
5695260	5697260	I might be a Hogwarts student.
5697260	5699260	But I'm also a scientist.
5700260	5702260	This cannot be.
5702260	5704260	Snape said in a crisp voice.
5704260	5707260	As blood dripped from his hand where Dumbledore's wand had shot him.
5708260	5710260	There must be other factors.
5710260	5712260	There must be other factors.
5712260	5714260	You don't have any.
5714260	5716260	I yelled in madly.
5717260	5719260	Lupin held up the camera.
5719260	5721260	Try um-fall-element.
5721260	5723260	Try um-fall-element.
5723260	5725260	Try um-elephantly.
5727260	5729260	The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.
5729260	5731260	I'm just going to give him normal voice.
5731260	5732260	Oh wait.
5732260	5734260	The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.
5734260	5737260	A little like a creepy family guy.
5738260	5740260	Hagrid is Emmy?
5740260	5741260	No.
5741260	5743260	He's not going to be cute and funny.
5749260	5752260	I'm maybe a Hogwarts student.
5752260	5754260	Hagrid pause angrily.
5754260	5756260	But I'm also a scientist.
5756260	5757260	Okay fine.
5757260	5759260	Fine fine.
5759260	5761260	Hagrid can be cute and funny.
5761260	5763260	You want to vote? Okay.
5766260	5768260	Hagrid voice.
5770260	5772260	Brixton.
5772260	5775260	Or cute and funny.
5782260	5784260	I've got to be homophobic.
5784260	5786260	My bitch is gay.
5788260	5789260	Scott?
5789260	5790260	I actually-
5790260	5792260	Maybe I'll do Scott to someone else.
5793260	5795260	Hagrid is Tony.
5795260	5797260	I may be a Hogwarts student.
5797260	5799260	But I'm also a Satanist.
5801260	5803260	Because, because.
5803260	5805260	I may be a Hogwarts student.
5805260	5807260	But I'm also a Satanist.
5808260	5810260	I'm not the cute and funny voice.
5810260	5811260	Okay.
5811260	5813260	Cute and funny it is.
5816260	5818260	Because like they did it.
5818260	5819260	They always-
5819260	5822260	When girls wrote fanfics they'd always
5822260	5824260	tell and not show.
5824260	5826260	Like because it's like it's like a-
5826260	5828260	kind of a key factor of
5828260	5830260	writing as you can
5830260	5832260	kind of show
5832260	5834260	what you can do.
5834260	5836260	Writing as you can
5836260	5838260	kind of show what they're wearing with how
5838260	5840260	like the dialogue flows
5840260	5842260	or like how they interact with their environment.
5842260	5844260	But when you're younger you just
5844260	5846260	say it, you just tell.
5846260	5848260	I was wearing this, this and this instead of like
5848260	5850260	I looked over at
5850260	5852260	um, Draco.
5854260	5856260	My
5856260	5858260	cross necklace making a distinct
5858260	5860260	jingling sound.
5860260	5862260	I can't believe you fucking done this.
5865260	5867260	I don't know.
5867260	5869260	I had pretty good fanfics.
5869260	5871260	Too bad they're like, they were all lost
5871260	5873260	when they accidentally nuked my computer.
5874260	5876260	I'm very sad about that.
5876260	5878260	I like cried for days.
5879260	5881260	Because then I would 100% read them for you guys.
5889260	5891260	What was that?
5892260	5894260	The lens might be ruined
5894260	5896260	but the tape is still there.
5896260	5898260	The lens might be ruined
5898260	5900260	but the tape is still there.
5900260	5902260	The lens might be ruined
5902260	5904260	but the tape is still there.
5904260	5906260	I can do the whistle.
5908260	5910260	Why are you doing this?
5910260	5912260	Lupin said angrily while he rubbed his dirty hands
5912260	5914260	on his cloak.
5914260	5916260	Hope it's his cloak.
5916260	5918260	And then I heard the words I had heard before
5918260	5920260	but not from him.
5920260	5922260	I did not know whether it feels
5922260	5924260	shocker and happy or to bite him
5924260	5926260	and drink his blood cause I felt faint.
5926260	5928260	Because, because.
5929260	5931260	Hargid said and he paused
5931260	5933260	in the air dramatically,
5933260	5935260	waving his wand in the air.
5935260	5937260	Then swooped in he and singing
5937260	5939260	to the tune of a gothic version of a song
5939260	5941260	by 50 cent.
5941260	5943260	Because you are gothic.
5943260	5945260	Snap asked a little afraid voice
5945260	5947260	because he was a friend.
5947260	5949260	It meant he was connected with Satan.
5950260	5952260	Because I love her.
5952260	5954260	Whoa.
5954260	5956260	Hargid.
5956260	5958260	You're like
5958260	5960260	like 60 years old.
5962260	5964260	I think he's like actually a student
5964260	5966260	in this iteration.
5966260	5968260	Like he's like actually like he's like also a teenager.
5970260	5972260	Yeah, stop say
5972260	5974260	okay Hargid is a pedo too.
5974260	5976260	A lot of American schools like I wanted to address
5976260	5978260	that issue.
5978260	5980260	Oh.
5980260	5982260	Nope, he's an adult in this author's note.
5982260	5984260	Never mind.
5985260	5987260	I was about to slit my wrist again
5987260	5989260	with the silver knife that Drago
5989260	5991260	had given me in case if anything happened to him.
5991260	5993260	He had told me to use it valiantly against an enemy
5993260	5995260	but I knew we must both go together.
5999260	6001260	No! Sorry, I'm reading ahead.
6001260	6003260	I thought it was Hargid, but it was Vampire.
6003260	6005260	He started to scream
6005260	6007260	Oh my fucking good, no.
6007260	6009260	My scar hurts.
6010260	6012260	And then his eyes rolled up.
6012260	6014260	You could only see his red whites.
6014260	6016260	I stopped.
6016260	6018260	How did you know?
6018260	6020260	I saw it and my scar turned back
6020260	6022260	into the lightning ball.
6022260	6024260	No, I ran it closer.
6024260	6026260	I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.
6026260	6028260	I shouted.
6028260	6030260	I do, but the Ebola
6030260	6032260	changed it into a pentagram for me
6032260	6035260	and I always covered up with foundation.
6035260	6037260	I'm losing the goofy voice.
6038260	6040260	Anyway, my scar hurt
6040260	6042260	and it turned back into the lightning ball.
6042260	6044260	Save me!
6044260	6047260	Wake me up, wake me up inside.
6047260	6049260	Save me.
6050260	6055260	Call my name and save me from the dawn.
6055260	6057260	So this is Class of O9.
6059260	6061260	This is Gothic Class of O9.
6062260	6064260	Honestly, I would love to ask the author
6064260	6066260	of Class of O9 if they got any inspiration
6066260	6068260	from my immortal.
6068260	6070260	It's my favorite cover.
6076260	6078260	I do not know what
6078260	6080260	Kayoko means.
6081260	6083260	What does that mean?
6083260	6085260	Sorry, I still have a gun.
6085260	6087260	Let me put the gun away.
6090260	6092260	I don't mean to be threatening you
6092260	6094260	so diligently with my gun.
6100260	6102260	I always covered up with foundation,
6102260	6104260	he said back.
6104260	6106260	Anyway, my scar hurt back.
6106260	6108260	Then I had a vision of what was happening to Draco.
6108260	6110260	Ellipses, ellipses, ellipses.
6110260	6112260	Wolfamort has him bondage!
6116260	6118260	Anyway, I was in the school nurse's office
6118260	6120260	now recovering from my slit wrist.
6120260	6122260	Snapp and Lupin and Harrid
6122260	6124260	were there too.
6124260	6126260	They were going to St. Mango's
6126260	6128260	after they were recovered
6128260	6130260	because they were pedophiles.
6130260	6132260	You can't have those pervs teaching in a school
6132260	6134260	with a lot of hot girls.
6134260	6136260	Dumbledore had constipated the city-o camera
6136260	6138260	and they took of me naked.
6138260	6140260	I put up my middle finger up at them.
6140260	6142260	Anyway, Hargard came into my hospital bed.
6144260	6146260	He came into the bed holding a bouquet of pink roses.
6150260	6152260	He said it in a very serious voice.
6154260	6156260	Giving me the roses.
6156260	6158260	Fuck off, I told him.
6158260	6160260	You know I fucking hate the color pink anyways.
6160260	6162260	Although she has a lot of pink stuff so...
6162260	6164260	I don't like the fucked up.
6164260	6166260	I don't like fucked up preps like you.
6166260	6168260	I snapped.
6168260	6170260	Hargard had been mean to me before for being gothic.
6172260	6174260	Hargard says.
6176260	6178260	What? Are they goffs too?
6178260	6180260	Do you pose their prep?
6180260	6182260	I asked because I was angry that you bought me pink roses.
6182260	6184260	I saved your life.
6184260	6186260	He yelled angrily.
6186260	6188260	No you didn't. I replied.
6188260	6190260	You saved me from getting a Paris Hilton pee video
6190260	6192260	made from your shower scene and being viewed
6192260	6194260	by Snap and Lupin.
6194260	6196260	Who masturbated.
6196260	6198260	Whatever.
6200260	6202260	Oh, he added. Who masturbated.
6202260	6204260	To it he added sign Lee.
6204260	6206260	Whatever. He yelled angrily.
6206260	6208260	He pointed his wand at the pink roses.
6208260	6210260	These aren't roses.
6210260	6212260	He suddenly looked at them with an evil look in his eye
6212260	6214260	and muttered.
6214260	6216260	Well, if you want honesty, that's all you had to say.
6218260	6220260	That's not a spell. It's an MCR song.
6220260	6222260	I corrected him wisely.
6222260	6224260	I know. I was just warming up my vocal chords.
6226260	6228260	And he screamed.
6228260	6230260	That's not a spell I can't make!
6236260	6238260	I don't know.
6240260	6242260	What the fuck is she saying?
6242260	6244260	What the fuck is Hagrid saying?
6244260	6246260	And then the roses turned into a huge black flame
6246260	6248260	floating in the middle of the air.
6248260	6250260	And it was black.
6250260	6252260	Did I mention it was black?
6252260	6254260	No, I knew he wasn't a prep.
6254260	6256260	Okay, I believe you know what the fuck is Draco.
6260260	6262260	What the hell is Hagrid's mean spin facts?
6262260	6264260	I don't know about you.
6264260	6266260	What a voice, my beloved.
6294260	6296260	I have found myself okay, you mean old man.
6312260	6314260	Anyway, when I got better, I went upstairs
6314260	6316260	and put on black leather mini-dress
6316260	6318260	that was all ripped on the ends with lace on it.
6318260	6320260	There was some corset stuff on the front.
6320260	6322260	Then I put on black fishnets
6322260	6324260	and black high heeled boots
6324260	6326260	with pictures of Billy Joel all strong.
6326260	6328260	I put my hair all out around me
6328260	6330260	so it looked like Samara from the ring.
6332260	6334260	Like that girl in the club
6334260	6336260	in a vampire in the masquerade.
6338260	6340260	If you don't know who she is, you're a prep, so fuck off!
6340260	6342260	And I put on a blood red lipstick,
6342260	6344260	black eyeliner, black lip gloss.
6346260	6348260	You look kawaii, girl.
6352260	6354260	What?
6354260	6356260	Sorry, my head's flying away.
6360260	6362260	Sorry, you look kawaii.
6362260	6364260	Not kawaii, kawaii.
6364260	6366260	You look kawaii, girl.
6366260	6368260	I can't even do a birth accident for her.
6370260	6372260	Sorry.
6372260	6374260	You look kawaii, girl.
6374260	6376260	Bloody Mary said sadly.
6376260	6378260	Fangs.
6378260	6380260	Get it? You did too.
6380260	6382260	I said sadly too, but I was still upset.
6382260	6384260	I slipped off my wrist feeling totally depressed
6384260	6386260	and I sucked out on the blood.
6386260	6388260	I cried again in my bathroom
6388260	6390260	and put on the shades on so snap and loop
6390260	6392260	and couldn't spy on me this time.
6392260	6394260	I went to some classes.
6394260	6396260	Vampire was in the hair of magical, magic creatures.
6396260	6398260	He looked all depressed because Draco disappeared.
6398260	6400260	He had used to be in love with Draco.
6400260	6402260	He was sucking some blood from a hufflepuff.
6404260	6406260	Hoi.
6406260	6408260	He said in a depressed way.
6408260	6410260	Hoi back.
6410260	6412260	I said in an equal wakali said way.
6414260	6416260	We both looked at each other for some time.
6416260	6418260	Harry had beautiful red gothic eyes
6418260	6420260	so much like Draco's
6420260	6422260	because they were in the same fucking contacts.
6422260	6424260	Then we jumped at each other
6424260	6426260	and started screwing each other.
6426260	6428260	Stop it now, you horny simpletons!
6430260	6432260	I shouted at Professor McGoggle
6432260	6434260	who was watching us and so was everyone else.
6434260	6436260	Vampire you fucker!
6436260	6438260	I said slapping him.
6438260	6440260	Stop trying to screw me.
6440260	6442260	You know I love Draco.
6442260	6444260	I shouted and ran away angrily.
6444260	6446260	Just then he started to scream.
6446260	6448260	Oh my fucking god no!
6448260	6450260	My scar hurt!
6450260	6452260	And then his eyes rolled up.
6452260	6454260	You could only see his red whites.
6454260	6456260	No!
6456260	6458260	I ran up closer.
6458260	6460260	I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.
6460260	6462260	We already went over this before.
6462260	6464260	Pace.
6464260	6466260	Okay. Anyways.
6466260	6468260	We know that, yep.
6478260	6480260	The hex is a red white.
6480260	6482260	I think the whites of the eyes where you can see the veins
6482260	6484260	I don't get it.
6484260	6486260	I try to roll my eyes back as if you guys could see.
6486260	6488260	I try to roll my eyes across the head.
6496260	6498260	What scar?
6498260	6500260	Is making me lose IQ?
6500260	6502260	As it should.
6502260	6504260	Red Sleras
6504260	6506260	I highly doubt that's what she wanted to say.
6506260	6508260	Sleras, Sleras.
6510260	6512260	Vampire and I ran up the stairs looking for Dumbledore and we were so scared.
6512260	6514260	We were so scared.
6514260	6516260	Dumbly door! Dumbly door!
6516260	6518260	Dumbly door!
6518260	6520260	We both yelled. Dumbledore came there.
6522260	6524260	What is it that you want now you despicable snobs?
6524260	6526260	He asked angrily.
6526260	6528260	Voldemort has Draco!
6528260	6530260	We shout at the same time.
6530260	6532260	He laughed in evil voice.
6538260	6540260	No, don't. We need to save Draco.
6540260	6542260	We begged.
6542260	6544260	No, he said meanly.
6544260	6546260	I don't give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco.
6546260	6550260	Not after how much he misbehaved in school, especially with you, Ebony.
6550260	6552260	He said while he frowned looking at me.
6554260	6556260	Besides, I ain't never liked him that much anyway.
6556260	6558260	Then he walked away.
6558260	6560260	Emperor started crying.
6560260	6562260	My Draco!
6562260	6564260	He moaned.
6566260	6568260	Author's note, don't you think
6568260	6570260	fake gay guys are like so hot?
6572260	6574260	It's okay.
6574260	6576260	I tried to tell him, but that didn't stop him.
6576260	6578260	He started to cry tears of blood. Then he had a brainstorm.
6578260	6580260	Like how did I do?
6580260	6582260	He exclaimed.
6582260	6584260	What? I asked him.
6584260	6586260	You don't see.
6586260	6588260	He said. He took out his wand and did a spell.
6588260	6590260	Then suddenly, we were in Voldemort's lair.
6590260	6592260	We ran with our wands out as we heard a crooned voice say.
6592260	6594260	How were.
6594260	6596260	How were.
6600260	6602260	Hela Godavra
6604260	6606260	insha Allah.
6606260	6608260	It was Voldemort.
6614260	6616260	Sorry, Eric. Fuck you.

6902000	6908000	She's a vampire. She can't die. She just drinks her own blood. I don't understand it. Though...
6908000	6914000	Can vampires bleed? Well, you know, true blood. I can't remember in the twilight. Can they bleed?
6914000	6923000	And Obi, I love you, he shouted sadly. I do not care what those fucker-preps and losers think.
6923000	6929000	You're the most beautiful girl in the world. Before I met you, I wanted to commit suicide all the time.
6929000	6933000	Now, I just want to fucking be with you. I fucking love you.
6933000	6939000	Then, he started to sing The Chronicles of Life and Death. We concerted our song now because we fell in love with Joel singing it.
6939000	6944000	Right in front of the entire class. His singing voice was so amazing and gothic and sexy.
6944000	6948000	The cross between Gerard, Joel. Oh, she's a cross. She didn't say a pentagram.
6948000	6951000	Tester, Pierre, and Marilyn Manson.
6951000	6956000	I'll just note, don't do your fingers, guys. They're so hot. If you don't know who they are, then get the fuck out of here.
6959000	6963000	This is my last resort. He cut my life into pieces, indeed.
6966000	6972000	Oh, my fucking god. I said after he was finished. Some fucking prep stared at us.
6972000	6977000	But I just stuck on my middle fingers that I've recovered in a black nail polish and we're in twine with Draco's now at them.
6977000	6983000	I love you, I said. And then we started to kiss, just like Hilary Duff. I fucking hate that bitch.
6983000	6986000	And CMM and a Cinderella story. Oh, yeah, I remember that.
6987000	6993000	Then we went away holding hands. Lupin shouted at us, but he stopped because everyone was clapping by how sexy we looked together.
6993000	6997000	Then I saw a poster saying that MCR would have a concert in Hogsmeade right then.
6997000	7000000	Just teleported and now there's a concert.
7000000	7004000	We looked at each other all shocked and then we went together.
7008000	7010000	To be continued.
7011000	7016000	There's 44 chapters of this. It gets even better.
7025000	7028000	Handholding. Disgusting.
7032000	7037000	Anyways, as long as the tip of the iceberg, ladies and gentlemen.
7038000	7040000	MCR is a wizard band? Of course they are.
7044000	7048000	What do you guys think? Oh, yeah, sorry, the gun's over.
7056000	7059000	You love me, right? You like me a lot?
7060000	7062000	My god, is it finally over?
7063000	7065000	Yes it is.
7066000	7070000	Did we already do a part of Sonic High School? I did not read Sonic High School, no?
7070000	7074000	Because I couldn't remember the name of it.
7074000	7079000	I couldn't remember that someone suggested a Sonic thing. I can't remember what it was called though.
7080000	7082000	Excuse me.
7083000	7085000	I could definitely always do that one again.
7085000	7088000	Well, not again. I can always read that one.
7088000	7091000	You loved it? You like the dramatic reading?
7091000	7094000	Because I'm gothic. Get it?
7095000	7098000	Thanks. What the fuck am I sitting on?
7098000	7100000	Ow.
7101000	7105000	You know, cats will shed their claws a little bit.
7106000	7108000	I just sat on the claw.
7110000	7112000	Stabbing my booty.
7112000	7115000	Cutest dramatic reading. Thank you.
7115000	7117000	Glad you enjoyed.
7119000	7124000	Let me know. I'll probably make a poll on Twitter if you guys want me to continue.
7126000	7130000	When you call him Madam Shibinia Papp.
7132000	7134000	Wait, hold on. I need that.
7142000	7144000	Screenshot material.
7145000	7147000	For all your meme needs.
7148000	7150000	Hold on. Let me put the gun up higher.
7155000	7157000	My hand.
7165000	7169000	Did you like emo goth Shibi? Did you like my immortal?
7175000	7180000	Because I have a blonde streak and blonde streaks in my hair, you think I'm a fake?
7181000	7184000	You're a fucking poser, bro. Back off.
7186000	7188000	Maybe I made a lot more fun.
7188000	7190000	I dressed like a relay man.
7190000	7193000	I did actually have a hoodie like this except I had cat ears on the top.
7193000	7197000	And the cat ears could stretch over like the hood could go over your face.
7197000	7201000	It was like a cat mask and it came with like a little cat paws.
7201000	7203000	And it was hot pink and black.
7203000	7205000	It was great.
7207000	7210000	You can probably find a picture of it now that I think of it.
7216000	7219000	The Suprem is nice to...
7219000	7226000	Well, this is from Booth. I'll probably put credit so that the model in the description.
7229000	7237000	I'm debating whether or not to end stream or play Call of the Lamb.
7239000	7243000	I might just end stream because I should probably like do my dishes and shit.
7244000	7246000	Probably wear Ahigaya clothing if we could.
7246000	7249000	Well, I did get a face mask that...
7258000	7260000	You speaking is true.
7261000	7263000	I fucking hate that dog, man.
7265000	7268000	So I'm like more loud than I am.
7269000	7271000	He naps more than me.
7272000	7275000	This dog is trying to call for Satan to come get him.
7276000	7279000	Yeah, maybe I'll do a girl later if I'm...
7285000	7286000	Holy crap.
7286000	7290000	Guys, that's not my dog. It's a dog outside of my apartment right now.
7290000	7293000	There's walking by and the dog is screaming.
7302000	7308000	I don't even know what the fuck he's barking at.
7308000	7312000	He's just walking with his mom and dad. I think I hear their voices.
7314000	7317000	It has to be a puppy, although I think there's like a Pomeranian.
7317000	7319000	And it might be that Pomeranian.
7319000	7320000	I don't know.
7320000	7325000	But the dog is annoying because it'll bark at all hours of the day.
7326000	7328000	Spontaneous interview.
7329000	7333000	Yeah, it's actually like someone a demon with a reading fanfic.
7335000	7337000	Yeah, well, is...
7338000	7340000	Is Emmy streaming today?
7341000	7343000	Okay, I remember.
7349000	7352000	Yeah, I see that it finished our ASMR stream.
7352000	7355000	Strawny is currently playing Skyrim.
7359000	7363000	So that means you guys wouldn't have anybody till...
7366000	7367000	Till Azura.
7373000	7376000	Oh yeah, because she... I remember she was saying she has piano lessons and stuff.
7377000	7379000	Oh, and Azura is not on.
7379000	7382000	I know, I realized that when I started streaming that I didn't...
7383000	7385000	I didn't post it on YouTube.
7385000	7388000	Again, I suck at doing YouTube stuff.
7391000	7392000	Okay, so do you get...
7393000	7395000	I guess I'll keep streaming then because then it's just...
7396000	7398000	It's just mercy.
7399000	7400000	At 11.
7400000	7403000	It'll be a large gap of, you know, cute girls.
7403000	7405000	So I'll be glad to fill that gap.
7406000	7407000	Fill that gap.
7407000	7409000	I guess I'll play a little bit of Call of the Lamb.
7411000	7412000	Fill the what?
7412000	7413000	The what?
7413000	7414000	I'm gonna...
7416000	7418000	I'm gonna end stream, but then start it again.
7422000	7424000	It's just I'm gonna start a separate stream.
7424000	7426000	Actually, I'm just gonna set up that right now while I'm talking to you guys.
7427000	7429000	It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.
7429000	7431000	None of them, because I would never harm an animal.
7432000	7434000	I'm gonna start a separate stream.
7434000	7436000	It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.
7436000	7438000	None of them, because I would never harm an animal.
7444000	7446000	I'm gonna stay in my dull hand form.
7451000	7452000	Where?
7457000	7459000	Yeah, I'll just call it a lamb.
7460000	7461000	Yeah, I'm saving the vlog.
7461000	7462000	Don't you worry.
7462000	7463000	Don't you worry.
7463000	7464000	You're a pretty little head.
7465000	7467000	I'm gonna end stream, then I'm just gonna start again.
7468000	7470000	And just so people can be like,
7470000	7472000	wait, there was van-fiction reading,
7472000	7474000	and then they're like, just so it's not confusing.
7474000	7476000	And Estrani did that for her 2.0
7476000	7478000	and the exposing be a little other thing.
7479000	7481000	And I've done that in the past myself.
7483000	7485000	Schedule stream.
7486000	7487000	Schedule stream.
7488000	7489000	Onput.
7492000	7493000	607.
7500000	7501000	Call order name.
7516000	7518000	Can I put poop in my thumbnail?
7519000	7521000	Guys, stop pooping everywhere for the love of God.
7521000	7522000	Is that allowed?
7523000	7524000	Not my thumbnail.
7525000	7528000	My cult of the emo.
7530000	7532000	She'll be watching my course.
7533000	7536000	I'm gonna stream call the lamb as Shibony.
7539000	7540000	It's fine.
7541000	7542000	It's fine.
7548000	7553000	Gorilla cult of the lamb.
7553000	7555000	Let's try to beat the third boss.
7555000	7556000	Oh my God.
7558000	7561000	Sometimes graphics artist gives me the thumbnails,
7561000	7563000	but they're like the wrong size
7563000	7565000	and I don't have to keep compressing them.
7565000	7566000	I'm actually gonna edit that real quick.
7566000	7567000	All right, I'll be right back.
7567000	7568000	I'll see you guys.
7568000	7570000	Probably I'll say 6.15.
7571000	7572000	Bye.
7586000	7587000	Give me one second.
7607000	7609000	Public 6.15.
7613000	7614000	Cool.
7616000	7618000	Public 6.15.
7619000	7621000	All right, later nerds.
7624000	7625000	Somebody fucking hung up.
7645000	7646000	Public 6.15.
