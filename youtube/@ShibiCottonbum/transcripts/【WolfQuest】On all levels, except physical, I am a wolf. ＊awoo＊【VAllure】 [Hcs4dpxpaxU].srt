1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
I don't even know if you guys can hear the music.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:18,280
Alright, I'm back, I'm back even though I got back home earlier than I thought I would.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,720
Thank you guys for your understanding, I'm sorry I had to cut the stream I started initially

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,840
short but everything's okay now, everything's good, everybody's good and safe and fine,

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,200
I need a tweet, cause I always forget to tweet.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,640
Sorry, hey I was watching that, that just killed me a little bit, hey I was watching

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,200
that.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,960
So I had Bulldog Ramen the other day, well like yesterday and my asshole was on fire,

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm sorry I had to tell you, I just thought you'd like to know you know, so I'm sitting

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:06,960
on an ice cube and hoping for the best, hoping that I won't die, it was so delicious though

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:20,200
so worth it, can I fire a napalm, probably, so you can show us your, hey Oshiba you hope

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,800
everything is returning to normal so that you can show us your alpha side, and by the

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,560
way don't have to postpone if you choose your sentence, I understand, well thank you, it's

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,840
okay now, so silly family stuff that honestly has nothing to do with me but I'm just there

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,240
to support in case, again my family is fine, I'm fine, I'm trying to get my fucking headphones

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:53,200
on, oh my gosh, this wire is too short, off this satin water, that's what I get for sitting

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,080
on an ice cube, these are my bucks cool man, am I allowed to talk about this, this is already

18
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:08,040
gone, the thing is already demonetized, whatever, we out here having a great time on this lovely

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:22,400
July evening, good morning, good night, good afternoon, I'm your host Shibi, butt is on

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:47,760
firebomb, I should have said Shibi firebomb but it's fine, okay, I'm alive, whoa, oh god

21
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,240
I can hear myself, can you guys hear me, is it an echo, I just wanted to be able to monitor

22
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:07,200
my sound, I can hear myself and now there's two of me, two of me, two of me, I'm on a tin

23
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:16,160

24
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:28,800
branding the street now, it ain't a Shibi stream without a little scuff, well of course

25
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:44,040
this is a great game, you guys hear the music, Shibi bottom fire, that's me, this game looks

26
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,320
wild as fuck because you're right, we're in the wild west baby, I'm just kidding I don't

27
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:57,080
know, I forget what this takes place in Yellowstone, takes place in the wild Midwest baby, I don't

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:22,000
remember, American school system failed me, kinda, okay I'll turn it up to them, oh, how many

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,120
cubs do you cook in, we're gonna have so many cubs, again all the cubs, we're cub maxing the

30
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:50,040
stream, I hate my life, try to think the only thing about these IEMs is that I can't, like it has

31
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,280
a thing where it should let me turn down the volume with them but it's not letting me do that so

32
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:04,600
I'm just gonna take one ear out, otherwise I can't hear anything, cub maxing, better call Icy, oh my

33
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:15,480
god, alright, zitter, let's me tweet, honestly I almost don't feel like tweeting because I'm like if

34
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:30,440
you know you know, if you know you know, okay we back, I don't know if I could put a link in a

35
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:40,840
quote tweet but Twitter algorithm is fucking weird as hell, and earlier, we're back earlier,

36
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:52,320
yeah I initially said six but I realized I was gonna be back sooner, please let me retweet my own

37
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:12,240
post, thank you, oh my god, okay, so the game might be a little bit laggy because this in my

38
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800
model just don't play nice, well Quest is kind of notorious for that, it's like one of those games

39
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,160
it just like takes up way too much power than it actually needs to be because it's like a decade

40
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,120
old and it doesn't make any sense, is this considered a retro game, oh god, that just makes me feel bad

41
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:45,280
furry, shut up Nori, shut up, I love you though, that's my girl Noriko

42
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,160
she probably hates being pointed out now, she doesn't know that I gave her mod

43
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,040
when she wasn't around

44
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,480
she's drawing some very beautiful art of me, am I okay, oh I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just family

45
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,120
stuff but everybody like my immediate family is fine, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good,

46
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,240
I think I'll help my mom or something

47
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,080
where's mountain lion quest, that would be, oh my god, what was that game, oh my god, it was made

48
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,400
by this character called, this person called Kobu and it was like literally like lion simulator

49
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,560
and you can like do some really wacky, oh my god, it's like two hearts, oh my god, it's gonna

50
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,960
bother me but I might play that too at some point, I'm just gonna like, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna

51
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,480
furry max, I'm gonna weasel my way into the furry community, honestly some of the furry models

52
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,920
that I've seen are really freaking cute, I think I saw her a bunny one or like a cat one or a dog

53
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:07,120
one and I'm like that's actually adorable but it was like Moe, you know, it was cute, she means

54
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:18,800
becoming a furry, that's the thing, I was always a furry though, I'm always angry, no I'm not a

55
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,480
furry, I do, I do admire the art though, I'm not really into that, like I, I'm trying to think

56
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,520
did I draw, no I only drew like, I never drew like anthropomorphic animals, I only drew like cat

57
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,600
girls or just cats, I never like a combination of like going even deeper in it, she be furry bum,

58
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,080
furry affiliate, oh yeah, no there's definitely, who are all the bunnies furries, I don't know,

59
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,680
ask, ask, I don't know, hey man, does werewolf not count as a furry, I think that's its own thing,

60
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,880
I respect furries a lot because it's not a chief hobby, honestly same

61
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,920
and they make a lot of bank, okay if you, if you complain that my model lags, I'm gonna punch you,

62
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,600
I don't care, it's gonna lag, my computer's old, I built it in 2017, leave me alone,

63
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,760
yes, could a veeler bought me a computer, yeah but I didn't want to ask because I'd rather the

64
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:26,640
money go towards something else, all right new game, um, I want to modify a wolf,

65
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,040
wait, yeah we're gonna create a wolf, if it loads in, I don't,

66
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,280
it just crashed,

67
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,160
should I, am I have to turn into like a fucking PNG to play this, I love this game, I do,

68
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,600
it's, it's close to my heart, but it just crashed, oh look there's two of me, hi,

69
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:16,720
attempt number two, are you hypnotized, are you hypnotized, are you entertained, are you feeling it,

70
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
shot of close jutsu,

71
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,200
this should be head incident part two, okay is it gonna go back to wolf quest,

72
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,760
police, oh no they'll make it that,

73
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,560
there we go, perfect, okay let's turn down the game settings even more, we're gonna put them at

74
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:56,640
fast, what fastest, perfect, everything is so, okay okay wait so this is the fastest version

75
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,000
and then this is the stupendous version,

76
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,000
it's actually quite pretty but my model can't move at all,

77
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:20,800
so we're going to be playing like this, I have, yeah I have a 10 to 70s so

78
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,640
I kind of like how ganky it looks because this is how I remember it, it looked like this,

79
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,320
the grass was barely there, it was a texture on the ground, the trees were barely loaded in,

80
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,160
actually hold on am I, I'm moving fine, what if I do,

81
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,960
about fast, just so we can have, that looks a little bit better, that looks a little bit better,

82
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,680
now we have some actual grass, so let's do, let's do a new game, create new wolf,

83
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,280
see oh it's working, we're good, oh my god girl we need to get you a better pc,

84
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,680
I will, don't worry I will eventually, I just want to, I have more things I want to do before I

85
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:10,640
get a pc, I have paying off my debt first, I need to pay off my credit card and then I will get a pc,

86
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,360
then I will put it on that credit card, get the points for it and then pay it off again because

87
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,200
I am a, I'm a smart bunny, madam and debt, madam is, I was about to say the amount of debt,

88
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,480
I don't really count school loans,

89
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,240
it's fine, I'm not going to say because then someone's going to start like donating shit and

90
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,800
I know that's not why I'm, I would bring it up, okay so I have, ooh life is rough pack,

91
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,280
cutie Cinderella, oh my god that's such a pretty wolf, I have to buy the dlc,

92
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,080
her name is 42f Cinderella but it's fine, white lady, that's what I am right now, I'm a white lady,

93
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:09,360
pretty, these are actual wolves, I actually, it's funny because I, I love like learning

94
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,080
about Yellowstone and stuff so I recognize some of these names because I remember I would,

95
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,120
when I used to be a wolf role player, I was an avid wolf role player on WolfQuest and on like

96
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:27,920
wiki foundry, aka wet paint and all that shit, we would take the photos from like the famous

97
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,280
wolf pictures and like that would be our OC, like this is my wolf character,

98
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,480
so it's funny that I, like the, the founder ones I recognize, it's just, it's just because I was

99
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,440
just such a, I just really liked wolves because I liked their pack mentality, like the family,

100
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,360
what happened to him, life is rough pack, oh he just has freaking mange, I don't want that,

101
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,800
it's kind of badass, as long as you don't sleep with the fishes, I was a lone wolf in the game,

102
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,240
related wolf, what, you know cats, does it entail like normal death, wolf looks like ice,

103
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,320
yeah she's the white one that did, if, if icy was a wolf, she would be this one, this would be her,

104
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:21,760
it's so cute, um I, so there's different pack types and there's different um coat types because

105
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,680
wolves come in a variety of coat colors, um I like this one because it looks like me,

106
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:38,080
because we are both like blondish, why is this one named Brad Pitt, hold on let me move myself over

107
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,720
a little bit, let me make myself a little bit smaller, because I'm blocking a lot of stuff,

108
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:53,440
my big ass hand, you indulge collab game, oh my god, mischief null, maybe I'll name her that,

109
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,880
um okay, let's make her, I can make myself, oh fuck, there's so much like before, it used to be

110
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,840
like a little wolf and then like a splash page over here on this side, you can't see my mouse,

111
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,040
I don't know why I'm just string, on the left side and then you would just have to pick a

112
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,040
color, you couldn't do all this cool shit or it wasn't based off of actual wolves, um I can give

113
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,480
myself some fucked up eyes, holy shit, I can miss an eye, like I'm winking at you, I kind of like

114
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,760
that, like I'm a little like, I'm winking, I'm winking, uh thank you Charlie for the donut,

115
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,680

129
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,160

130
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
I can turn that down a bit but then you guys won't really hear the music

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,640

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,840
speech because I'm like am I tripping, the AI thought I was a streamer for some reason, must be

137
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
yeah I know you don't hear any music, it's because I put it down

138
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
because it's really loud

139
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,520

152
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,720
like I'm poor and I'm like that's okay and then that one person that just like kept getting

153
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,280

154
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,800
that was me, congrats everybody's like the great names are just like sad

155
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,240
don't worry, don't worry you're still appreciated, you're still appreciated, you showed up today

156
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:17,200
that's all I care about, um gray wolves coming out, the grays versus the greens, it's house of

157
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,800
the wolves instead of house of the dragon, if you were in a Game of Thrones house what would you

158
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:35,120
do, oh it's your lucky day, some of you, it's your lucky day, thank you authorities,

159
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
one of you got hit, that's good

160
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:52,960
there he goes, dubs in the chat boys, dubs in the chat, if I was in Game of Thrones house

161
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,720
I would leave

162
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,920
I feel like I would be like appearance wise, one there's like no brown people except in

163
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,720
over the seas in um what should I call it, wherever

164
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,640
Melisandre is from, no that's the red woman, Melisandre, Misandre is from

165
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,680
but I feel like I would be in house motel based off of appearance if it was a house but I would

166
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:31,760
I would prefer, I would probably be based off of my model obviously a fucking lannister like

167
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,840
let's be real like I can't like a red and blonde come on like and then Amy would also be a lannister

168
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,240
because like kissing your sister and stuff so gotta keep it, I gotta keep it in the family

169
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,480
but if I would, I would probably, I would obviously, I'd probably be a star because I like the winner a

170
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:59,280
lot, Dorne, yes Dorne, I'm a Dorne-ish gal, who house the dragon mansion, oh there's a new episode

HBO, I'm like HBO no thank you, only decent lannisters with two brothers, Greyjoy, yes thank you

177
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,960

245
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
wolves I had like 50 from across all my characters from wolf role playing

246
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,640

younger I was like I was I remember how old I was well I remember I was not gonna say um

291
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:13,440
back when I was uh 42 yes I'm 56 now so when I was 42 wow look how sparse the fucking

292
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,520
thing is because whatever um I donated like so much money to it because I was like save the wool

293
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,840
save them wolf customization is the most important I spent like two hours customizing

294
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:33,280
character in oblivion leave me alone that's why I like I don't think I could play balder's gate

295
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,680
because I'd just be sitting there customizing the character for the entire stream all right

296
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:44,960
I'm like too high up in my chair I need to like come down to earth my feet sees are kicking

299
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,320

300
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,680
yep that would be me oh my god the amount of time I spent customizing character in black desert

301
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,400
for like three times right like I literally I took the heels off yeah I literally played

302
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,960
balder's gate for three hours and two hours of that was probably making my character

303
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,200
oh my god I should play the sims I think um as there is probably gonna make us in the sims or

304

01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,400
Where's the map?

503
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,400
I'm going the wrong way again

504
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
Who is howling

505
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Was it you

506
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,640

507
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,640
Oh, there's a lot of wolfies nearby

508
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,360

519
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
Look gorgeous the sky is

520
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,120
Am I being chased by something again, that's a scent marker

521
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:29,880
Let me stop and howl. Oh

522
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,440
What oh

523
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,200
What the hell is happening? I'm being attacked by multiple

524
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,280
Oh my god guys, I might die guys. I might die guys get me out of here

525
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,080
I

526
01:02:53,080 --> 01:03:00,160
I'm just getting fucking ganged up on guys. This is not the type of gang bang that I wanted. Let me go

527
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,320
Stunlocked they killed me

528
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,600
No, you died

529
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,840
Let's just fuck off you bitches

530
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,840
I

531
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,000
Was a back in time you died. This is a badass picture of a crow. I

532
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,680
Couldn't get out of that. There's three wolves on me

533
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,560
They probably just ate me

534
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,760
It's so wolf over okay, at least I oh fuck this guy

535
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:49,240
Okay, hold on. Let me go towards okay. This is the right way speed up speed up speed up

536
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:59,200
Wait, I don't think I can find hold on

537
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,680
All my questions I have to kill two elk before I can even find a mate Jesus. That's why I haven't been seeing any males

538
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,080
All right. Well, I got to go kill two elk hold on

539
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Oh

540
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,760
There's a moose I can't really take down a moose

541
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,240
But this dude is still but behind me

542
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,160
Dodger all do wolves cannibalize. Um in certain circumstances. They will definitely cannibalize

543
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,600
Are these elk? No, they're they're deer

544
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,280
Yeah, they're dope wrong here. I don't really need that. I already killed a fucking deer. You think that would count

545
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,360
Is this dude still on me? I will literally laugh

546
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,560
He's not wait, is he? Oh my god

547
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,640
So no elk

548
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,680
Maybe he just wants to hang out with me. Do you want to be my boyfriend?

549
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,400
You know, I don't mind a little bit of roughness. I'm not I'm not averse to that

550
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:18,760
Wait, is that another wolf? Oh, no, it was a fucking I'm getting distracted by dead trees and thinking that they're wolves

551
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,600
I'm just trying to find I'm leaving your territory. Are you happy?

552
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,200
There was a grizzly bear an hour here, and there was a mule deer

553
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,840
Am I out of the territory? Please. Let me be out of the fucking territory. I

554
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,960
Think I am

555
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,800
Little hexagon changes color. Oh

556
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
Oh my god, he's still following me

557
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,880
Okay, now I'm in purple territory, so I should be okay

558
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:58,160
Yeah, he's howling cuz he's Victor. Oh, I think I already fucking figured that out. All right, I think these are deer

559
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,640
Stop howling who's howling. Oh, it's definitely him. That's howling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, whatever

560
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,800
Wait, where'd the deer go?

561
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:17,840
No, I need elk I don't need deer. I need elk. Where are the elk? Where's the elk at?

562
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Looking for some prime elk

563
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,840
I do got that stamina I

564
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,160
Don't know what does purple mean that I'm hungry. I don't or that I'm thirsty or something

565
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,160
I don't remember what that stands for

566
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:43,880
Okay, that's definitely another same little from the pack. Oh, so the colors mean it's who's howling

567
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,400
That makes a lot more sense. Okay, again, this game has changed a lot

568
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,320
And I didn't really go through it the mechanics of it back when I

569
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,600
Started playing it before recently

570
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,960
Where am I?

571
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,960
I'm in the center. I'm in no territory

572
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,940
Just kidding. I'm in territory now. I'm not um

573
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,440
Maybe

574
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:18,380
We're at some fucking out. Can I drink water? Do I need to like do that? Do I need to like? Oh, I

575
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,120
I'm standing awkwardly on a rock and I'm drinking water

576
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,840
That's pretty cool

577
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Sweet nice

578
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,320
But what does the purple stand for is that my because I'm tired

579
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,920
Anything anything on the breeze, no

580
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,720
Pronghorn

581
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,880
You'll dear I feel like somebody's on me. No, okay

582
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,680
You know those trees look promising

583
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,160
We're birch trees in the line

584
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:05,280
They're like perfectly spaced. This is kind of a weird

585
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,760
No

586
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,320
Nothing here

587
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:15,160
Just the wind in the trees you saw an elk herd. Where's the elk herd? What do you mean? You saw an elk herd?

588
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,800
What do you mean?

589
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:33,000
I'm trying to eat it. I don't want to pick it up. Let me eat it. Am I not hungry?

590
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,000
Okay, I was gonna say I'm like what the fuck

591
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,880
Oh, I'm full. Okay. Go orange is hunger. I don't know what purple is

592
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,640
Where was it in the scent? I did what you're lying to me. I

593
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,120
Did not smell any I only saw

594
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,000
Hold on cougar. I'm going too fast

595
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:08,720
Grizzly sow grizzly. What is this some grizzly mom? You know, that's what they called that

596
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,180
What is this pink elk herd? Okay?

01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:21,920
Oh, aren't you funny? Oh, that is loud 20 cents inside of you there are two wolves and that's pretty hot

598
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,480

666
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,840
Why am I not out of the territory yet

667
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000

670
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,960

671
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,160
I'm dreaming of moose. Oh, I thought they killed me

672
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,440
Run run run run

673
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,040
The birds are screaming just like me internally

674
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:30,720
Leave me alone. I got three dudes on my ass

675
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,840
The Sun is about to rise

676
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,880
Am I still being chased?

677
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,240
Whoa, I just want it to make babies

01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:52,640
Not another 3v1. Okay, I should be out very soon. I

679
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:58,400
Keep running straight because anything towards the middle is usually good. Maybe if I get over this ridge

680
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Nope, I'm just in another section

681
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,600
Okay, let me just

682
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,240
Okay

683
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Okay, this way

684
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:20,160
I'm going to eat myself off this cliff. Why is there a cliff here?

685
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,200
Why am I not now? Oh

01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,360
Okay, it's fine. We'll just go into red territory. Oh shit. Oh fuck

689
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,680

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, we go up we go up

695
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,440

If those wolves could shut up that would be actually great

702
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,080
Apparently smell dispersal wolves just again, that's their marker

703

I need to sleep I'm gonna pass out I might as well just sleep here on this cliff

721
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,640
See that's me. I'm having dreams about our pack

722
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:13,320
And cougars apparently and grizzlies dancing. I like how it's the same picture and they didn't even bother flipping it. Oh

723
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:23,280
No, I'm poor defenseless thing. Oh, what the fuck did you come from your four-year-old male

724
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,160
Diversity would be good

725
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,160
You're looking for a mate

726
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,240
Okay. All right

727
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,400

Okay, I need to emote

01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,160

734
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,880

01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,920
Whatever that means, I don't I don't really think he's interested to me guys

741
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,640
I'm gonna

742
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,240
I'll do a confident tail wag

743
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,120
He's from antelope pack that's kind of a dumb ass pack name. I don't think I like you I

744
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,680
Don't think you're good enough. Nah

745
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,760
I'm looking for a better man

746
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,440
Man closer in age. I need strong puppies

747
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,400
Although, you know, you have been around for a bit, but you know, you're just on my type

748
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,400
Let's try to find another boy boy toy

749
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,400
Sniff is what Charlie? Thank you for the super but what?

750
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:23,400
No, nothing can I get a little holler back a little howl back girl

751
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,240
All right, let's go up

752
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,280
He me coping

753
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:38,240
Elevator is shut up. He wasn't good enough. He wasn't good enough. I'm sorry. He just wasn't why is it black?

754
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
Wolf failure

755
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,920
He was he was giving me nothing. How can I get he wasn't giving me the same energy back

756
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:53,160
He just sat there and howled and I wagged my tail. So I don't think it's gonna work out

757
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,960
So we're gonna go to whomever this is

758
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,920
Why am I getting like no sense usually there's a lot more wolves around

759
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,400
I have to run all over fucking creation to find a boyfriend like hello

760
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,200
You started getting your ass kicked no, he was intimidated by me

761
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:32,440
Because he saw me being the shit at a one dude and then he also saw all my boyfriends who were chasing me out last time

762
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,480
So that's why mm-hmm

763
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:44,240
Why is there's that tree looks like it's sparkling but it just isn't rendered properly I

764
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,360
Should just do the thing I did before and just go to sleep and then a male will show up

765
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,360
I just wake up and there's a dude

766
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,400
I think I might just do that because I don't feel like running all over the place just to find a man

767
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:09,080
They can come to me, you know they can come to me. I'm gonna sleep by this rock. It's good shelter

768
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,080
Let's take a nap

769
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,400

We would have a really good diversity

779
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,880
We could be a little mixed-race couple

780
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,960
And we can have little mini-meese

781
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,080

It's not that serious. Oh my god

802
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:36,760
It just reminds me of the time where people were freaking out that Emmy got a toy that was like darker than it was supposed to be

803
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:41,960
People are like we're like sending her marrows like I feel I would be really

804
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:48,000
Disappointed in you if you used that I would be really like they said are the wrong one

805
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:55,040
They said are the wrong one an accident and people were getting mad, but they said are a wrong toy that was

806
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,760
It was so funny to me I'm like bruh

807
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,600
But maybe I should go for the black and white wolf, you know

808
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:30,000
Honestly, I think the diversity would be good for our puppies, you know keeps the the gene pools. Oh, he wants to howl with me

01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,680

01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,640

814
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,160

818
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200

01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
insecurities

820
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,440

01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:34,740
Okay, that's three hours ago but there's pronghorn

933
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,740
Mule deer, where's the pronghorn smell?

934
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:41,860
two hours and 55

935
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:47,220
Three hours. Okay, so it's this way, but like I don't want to go that way

936
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:53,140
What if I go like that way? Oh look all the like scent on the wind

937
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:55,860
let's go this way just because

938
01:38:55,860 --> 01:39:01,860
We kind of void packs. I don't feel like fighting for our lives

939
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:04,580
Although it is very romantic

940
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,500
Discord mods to be fun today

941
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:17,220
I don't know. I have to think of a cool name for him has to be edgy

942
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:21,540
Maybe we'll call him like emo claw

943
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,580
Okay, that's great. Um, I smell a lot of stuff

944
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,860
Or we're not in a territory. I don't know why people are howling

945
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:36,420
He's howling back, uh

946
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:40,820
Because I ain't no howl back girl ain't no howl back girl

947
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:46,340
Can you like help me find a herd bro? Like you're kind of useless actually

948
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:48,660
He's kind of just following me. I don't

949
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:52,580
I don't know if he's living up to my expectations. I don't even already went. Oh

950
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,460
Okay, right there. That's fine

951
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,580
I remember I think the last time I played

952
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:02,980
Like the person like the little the wolf I chose just like didn't even follow me

953
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:07,860
I would have to like come back and be like come on. Come on

954
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:14,580
There's nothing in the air

955
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:19,300
So we need to go into a pack territory to like get food

956
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:29,780
Usually when there's like an eagle around that means there's like a carcass, but I don't think so

957
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:36,180
All right, let's just keep running straight. He misses the boys

958
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:40,820
Call him cat. He's a bit subby. Yeah, I guess he's a little maybe I'll call him subby

959
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,700
Whoa

960
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,580
Oh

961
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:58,740
Oh, we howl together we we like it. Um, let's go find some food girly pop

962
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:07,700
Perfect, perfect, perfect. Let's go you on it. We on it. Let's go. Let's go

963
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,060
Go for it. Maybe pop

964
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:13,300
We're going

965
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:16,820
Boom, boom

966
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:19,140
Locked on

967
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:23,620
He's kind of slow I'm much faster than him

968
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:32,420
I'm getting closer I'm coming for your ass. I'm coming for your ass. I'm coming for the ass

969
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:43,300
Help me. Oh, it's the fawn. Perfect. Help me. You're not helping me. Okay, you're helping me. That's better

970
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:48,900
Leave your child to die. It's fine. Well, I'm going to turn around and kill you

971
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:54,820
I swear to god if you don't let us kill her good. She's dead now. We feast now. We howl

972
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:58,100
Where you go

973
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:02,420
Excuse you. Did you just pick that up and what you don't want to eat with me?

974
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,900
I'm actually kind of mad

975
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:15,460
He literally just picked up food and walked away because he didn't want to eat with me

976
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:22,260
Um, well, I'm starting to think you're a dick. I don't think this is going to work out

977
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:28,740
I think I think we should see other people that just faded into the ground

978
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,900
Where are you going bro?

979
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:35,140
Bro

980
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:41,240
My mouth is full. Oh, sorry. Let me drop that

981
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,240
I

982
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:05,480
Said I can cancel it if I growl three times I'm growling I don't watch you

983
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:16,920
We're not working out. I'm sorry. You decided that I'm not good enough to eat with

984
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,600
Farewell discord kitten

985
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:30,840
Fucking piece of shit. Fuck you. Yeah, fucking I should kill him. Can I kill him?

986
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,920
Oh, no, I can only fucking

987
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,880
All right boys

988
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:43,320
He's better off

989
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:50,520
Yeah, I don't I don't like the passive aggressiveness. Am I gonna be able to smell things? I don't think I can smell in the rain that well

990
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,760
Um, let's go

991
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:02,280
Remember when we sat here and we walked around together

992
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,480
Yeah, oh wait, he's right in front of me

993
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:10,360
All right, let's go the opposite direction. We don't need this. We don't need that dead weight, you know

994
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,840
I don't need that. I don't need that dead weight

995
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,120
We're gonna howl and find ourselves a new man

996
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:24,920
I don't like brats

997
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:27,800
I don't feel I'm I don't feel like taming anybody. I need someone who

998
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,920
Will be a partner

999
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,280
I want a partner

1000
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,080
Not somebody who can even

1001
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:43,160
Okay, that storm actually crack just scared me. Um, wait, I could just fall asleep and men will show up to me again

1002
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:47,880
Oh my god, am I gonna get struck by lightning while I'm sleeping?

1003
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:02,040
We're feral today, you know, and taming anything. Yeah

1004
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,960
Um, sure, who are you?

1005
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,560
You're the dude from before you're back

1006
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,880
You showed up last time

1007
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:18,680
And I said you were too old for me, but you know, I really like your persistence

1008
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:25,400
Let's try it. Let's try it. I like his persistence. He he he tried courting me before

1009
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:40,280
He's loyal. He's just like he's sick. He just I don't know. He just showed up when I needed him, you know, like

1010
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,160
He is he does seem like a ride or die

1011
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:52,440
The bark is the howl is not it though. Um, but maybe we can work on that. So let's continue

1012
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,400
I'll do a little play bow for you

1013
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,320
Do you enjoy

1014
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,400
Do you like the play bow

1015
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,880
You're sitting

1016
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:07,320
Is my play bow not good enough? Why did you wait for me to wake up then?

1017
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,280
Can I

1018
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,240
Are you interested

1019
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:20,520
Are you just here to yell at me? Okay, let's do it

1020
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,480
Uh, let's sniff noses

1021
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,880
Sneef, sneef

1022
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,160
Oh

1023
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:29,160
He's literally me, but in gray

1024
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:36,440
Does he have a floppy ear? Oh my god. We both have floppy ears. Maybe that's why he likes me

1025
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,240
A03 just wanted to see if I'm okay. Maybe he's

1026
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:44,280
Maybe he's just a friend. I don't know

1027
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:49,720
Maybe old but I can still give you a good time. He's a bit of a fixer-upper. I don't know. He's cute

1028
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,720
He's cute

1029
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:55,720
Okay, all right. Hold on. Let's do a little

1030
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,680
Let's do an uh, a little roll

1031
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,560
Let me I don't need to I don't need to slow down. Don't tell me to slow down

1032
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
I'm trying to get this over as fast as possible

1033
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,880
And see if you're good enough for me 803

1034
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,320
Like how I just fucking jump

1035
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,440
You you're not even watching me

1036
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:27,160
I don't really think he's that interested. I think he's just a good guy

1037
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:30,760
Maybe I don't know

1038
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,520
Hello

1039
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:40,440

1040
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:45,240
Okay, what a sub. I'm gonna establish my dominance

1041
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,200
The chin rest

1042
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,200
Except I'm not touching you, but it's fine

1043
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:54,680
Oh, he's such a sub look. I'm looking away. He's so bashful

1044
01:47:56,440 --> 01:48:02,440
Sir, okay, I'll give you you know, I'll do a confident tail wag because I'm the I'm the alphas here

I don't know what the fuck just happened what I just do

01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,400
Let's let's do a little sniff

1051
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,600
No, sniff

1052
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,240
He is I don't know, you know, how did the viewer get in the game?

1053
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,760
Um, let's do a little

1054
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:45,080
A little roll you like that

1055
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,400
He just walked away

1056
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:03,320
He just left

1057
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:13,400
I'm like hurt. I thought he cared about me

1058
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:23,400
I guess he couldn't handle my alpha, bro, it's fucking winter. I'm so fast

1059
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:29,720
Guys, I don't know what to do. He's gonna go see his wife

1060
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,800
Like why did he he literally just walk he was so close

1061
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,520
I'm

1062
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,120
I'm genuinely shocked

1063
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:43,560
But it's fine

1064
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:47,320
I guess he was I guess you you know, maybe he's a gay friend that yeah

1065
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:50,280
It was like gasses you up and it's like you're when you're wingman

1066
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,920
Or like maybe he's just being a good guy, you know what?

1067
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:02,200
We're just it was it was right person wrong time, you know

1068
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,720
It wasn't

1069
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:09,960
It wasn't me. It was it wasn't him. It was me, you know

1070
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:14,840
He was too intimidated. He didn't see me as an equal. He wasn't looking me in the eye

1071
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:18,760
Um, I don't really need to eat right now

1072
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,080
But if I

What is that? Is that a fucking hair or what's happening down there? I think it's a bunny

1078
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,520
I'm so far away

01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:07,320
Like how I eat a hair carcass and like one bite. Um, let's take a little sip I suppose

Ain't nobody gonna match my freak

1092
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:24,680
I don't even go on tech talk anymore, but that song keeps showing up just like in general in my day to day life

1093
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:28,360
Just like on twitter ain't nobody gonna match my freak

1094
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,560
Ain't nobody gonna match and I'm just like so sick of it

1095
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,240
Of hearing ain't nobody gonna match my freak

1096
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:38,680
I'm just gonna eat some bunnies real quick

1097
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,920
There's a lot of society am I winning no

1098
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:48,360
I had there's one dude who didn't want to eat dinner with me and he literally picked up his food as left

1099
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:51,960
It was the equivalent of a like just like oh, I need to go use the bathroom real quick

1100
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,440
And then just left me with the bill and then another dude

1101
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:58,120
I woke up and he was just like just trying to make me feel better and I was coming on to him

1102
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:02,200
But you know, he wasn't interested. He just walked away right in the middle of our courtship. So it's

1103
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:07,400
It's not going too hot. I'm kind of disappointed. Uh, I thought I'd have a lot more

1104
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:12,040
You know luck, but you know, sometimes it's not meant to be

1105
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:16,840
I'm just trying to find my mr. Right, okay

1106
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,800
I just want to have puppies

1107
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:23,960
Oh, let's go this way

1108
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,040
Okay, I'm getting closer

1109
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:35,640
usually

1110
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:37,640
Oh, I'm just gonna fall asleep

1111
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,840
It's just easier that way. I don't feel like

1112
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:43,960
Running all over and then I'm gonna run by them

1113
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,540
Anybody any men?

1114
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:05,880
Nobody wants me bro, why don't we get the option to a dopa cat? Nope, I didn't mean to cut myself off

1115
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:19,240
I'm not a spinster. I'm only two years old

1116
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:24,600
I

1117
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:33,320
Will travel across the land

1118
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,120
searching for wine

1119
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:40,600
Something something something something

1120
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,400
and find a mate inside

1121
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:51,640
Is that a fucking cougar? What is that? Can I scare it off? Ron, bitch? Oh, no, I can't run away

1122
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:57,400
Is he gonna chase me? Oh, no, it's just shown, okay

1123
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:01,160
Ain't nobody gonna match my freak

1124
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:09,720
What the fuck was that? But we just got scared for me picking up a box

1125
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:16,600
I just no boy wife. I just want a boy wife

1126
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,200
Let's try this to box me

1127
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:24,920
All these a cougar would destroy me probably

1128
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,840
I have all these Korean snacks. Oh

1129
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:43,320
You're just supposed to be spicy. I'm pretty good. Wow like sweet and spicy

1130
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:51,640
What the fuck there's a drink in here I didn't even notice

1131
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:56,440
I'm gonna drink that now

1132
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:11,960
You have a saddle before your ovaries dry up. No, Charlie. Thank you for soup. I don't say such things

1133
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:15,480
No, I will have puppy

1134
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,520
Why do I hear something like wind blowing?

1135
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:36,520
My no, I don't see my biological stroke is ticking

1136
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:39,480

It's like apple soda, that's pretty good Koreans you got good snacks

1138
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,960
I just want a trad wolf wife, no boy wife

01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:12,600
It's tabaki, I don't know how to pronounce it

1140
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:18,920
Hi, who me? No, don't go for my headphone

1141
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,280
I don't know it's a Korean snack

1142
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:38,360
It's like a puffy right rice flake rice cracker

1143
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:42,840
Spicy and sweet soothing

1144
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:50,840
Twink boy wife. Yeah, I'm not I'm not having the puppies. He's having the puppies

1145
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,600
Female wolves

1146
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,600
Maybe I'll get a girlfriend instead. Maybe this maybe I'm just meant

1147
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:06,600
Oh my god, that's scary. Miss morrigan tipped four dollars and 20 cents

1148
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:11,560
Sheebie needs a male wolf male wife to pump a litter in her asap

1149
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,680
Excuse me

1150
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,640

01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,480

Oh my god

1153
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,880
I'm intimidated

1154
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:42,280
Boomi you're sitting right in front of my screen I can barely see when they were fat ass

1155
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,520
That way

1156
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,480
I

1157
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:01,320
Rabbit that doesn't multiply doesn't add up

1158
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:15,480
I'm thinking that I have to be like in the territory to get to get men's

1162
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,200

1163
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:00,680

Wait is that 12 18? Oh, no, it's not I was gonna say

1166
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:20,840
You have a cool collar which means the doctors look after you and you're probably more focused on and maybe like we can like be a family vlog channel

1167
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:25,400
I'm kidding four years old. Are they all four years old?

1168
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:32,440
What's that why do you have more diversity, but you're like a darker wolf

1169
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:35,320
Maybe the pelt's different

1170
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:37,960

You know, you don't have a lot of diversity, but it's okay

1204
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
He's a phantom

1205
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,160
Danny phantom Demi already one of them is just he's not about it

1206

He's about it though, you know five and we have really high diversity. Oh, you want to howl together? I'll howl with you

1207
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:28,640
And he's a sick color he's nice. He's a nice nice fur nice nice coat. He's a white booty

02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,720
It's like a tee does he have abs?

1211
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,560

02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:42,160

02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:56,520
But you still tall you're still standing tall and proud. Let's do it mean you. Oh

Here's your trial run. Mr. 806. You were just a phantom of me

I hope you don't mind my floppy ears. Let's go. Let's go find something to eat together

1222
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:26,920
He stood on business or would you get that collar? It's a radio collar. So it's like he gets tracked

1223
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:32,640
And a lot of these wolves are based off of real wolves by the way, so there's probably a

1224
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:36,840
Wolf that looks like you know, whatever the fuck and

1225
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:43,240
Has a radio collar, which is pretty cool. Oh, we want to howl together you can howl together

Yeah, you better howling. Oh, he's all close to me. That's kind of sweet. We should nap. Let's snap. You're right

1254
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:42,640
We should res address

1255
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:45,040
Is he the one I think he might be the one guys

1256
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:49,200
He thinks you look fertile

1257
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,320
Why am I submissive I don't want to be submissive

1258
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,320
Oh

1259
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:00,640
Okay, the test is

1260
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,400
Can he hunt with me?

1261
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:08,480
And there's a grizzly nearby um

1262
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,880
Where is the sense drifting from

1263
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:15,680
I

1264
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:18,400

1267
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,160
um

1268
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:38,160
It all comes down to when we share our first meal together, you know, it's very important

1269
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:43,520
Uh, if I could just find a fucking pack that'd be great

1270
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:48,640
There's a little bar next to my head and if that fills blue then I think we officially become mates

1271
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:54,080
Oh, we're at the border. Uh, we can't cross the border. This is oh am I in the corner of the map?

1272
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,800
Where the fuck are we?

1273
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,800
Oh look at him. He's just like hey

1274
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,960
All right, let's go into their territory to be honest

1275
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:02,960

1277
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,480
You smell anything mister

1278
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:24,560
You miss the first guy. Oh, I'm at the border again. Where the fuck am I running to?

1279
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:28,080
Oh

1280
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:35,600
Where should I go this way? I can't tell where my arrow is pointing. Okay, this way

1281
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:46,560
Oh, they're coming closer to the males again, I guess we just went into a fucking circle

1282
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:48,880
sweetie

1283
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:52,960
Uh, we might run into your brothers, but don't worry. We won't make it weird

1284
02:10:53,600 --> 02:11:00,240
We're just looking for food. We don't have to make it a thing. I picked you

1285
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:05,760
Let's just see if you live up to my expectations

1286
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,160
What the

1287
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:14,080
Why why is there scent coming? Oh, I'm literally on the edge

1288
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:19,360
That's because I'm like why is this because the edge is right here

1289
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:22,580
No, I went in the wrong direction

1290
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:32,000
Oh my god, okay, we need to go up

1291
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:40,880
I'm beginning to think she'd be as high. I mean, it's I'm really not

02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,600
I just I don't think I am is that a moose

1293
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:46,400
Why can't I smell the moose? It's right in front of me

1294
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,360
Uh, I don't think we can

1295
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:58,000

And you're trying to sniff um

1297
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:07,440
My soda can that made me burp like a motherfucker. He just stepped and kicked my mouse

1298
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:12,000
What's happening now? I lost my orientation boomi

1299
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000

02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:34,720
Am I too slow?

1303
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:36,720
Why are these deer so fucking fast?

1304
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:40,880
Oh, you broke off your mind

1305
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,800
Oh

1306
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:58,080
I'm too slow for this shit. Oh those elk. I don't know. They just came into the pack. Oh, let's see if I can

1307
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:06,720

You could help

1309
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:14,320
Why are they so fast? Why was I able to catch up to them before now? I can't

1310
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,880
Okay, do we need to stalk them? I think we do

1311
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,400
Let's stalk

1312
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,120
I can't

1313
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:30,160
Stalk this far away. Why are you just looking at me like that? He's just like what the fuck are you doing?

1314
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:36,560
Why are you staring at me? Oh, we can't keep his eyes off of you guys

1315
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,440
You see that

1316
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:42,160
I

1317
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:49,840
Like how a bear just walked through the herd with its baby and they didn't even fucking leave for that

1318
02:13:54,400 --> 02:14:00,480
Okay, we're getting a little restless go speed up

Feel like I was faster. Oh, was that an elk?

1322
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,520
Who are you?

1323
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:19,520
That's a little bit bigger

1324
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:25,920
It's like these random other deer are coming out of nowhere to join this herd and it's quite confusing

1325
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,520
Guys I can't run them down

1326
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:35,280
Are you sick? Come here sickly

1327
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:38,240

Oh, what the fuck it just ran into me and hurt me

1329
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,320
We need we need to circle circle

1330
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,560

02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:22,240
You're like not really helping that much

1336
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:28,240

We just need to eat food together though I can slow down

1343
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,960
Where are you? I don't know my game is lagging suddenly

1344
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:22,000

We're back in their territory, but it's fine

1351
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,880

I wanted to do a whole thing and wouldn't let me do it

1502
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:47,280
I wanted to call bionicle. Oh, okay, I like that

1503
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:50,960

02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:04,720

Okay, we need to find a den use the iconator compass to find it. Okay

1515
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:08,000
Winter has arrived snow no blankets the slopes of amethyst mountain bring grass beneath it

1516
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:13,840
All curds are migrating down into limar valley and search for winter raising grounds follow them down if you want to keep eating

1517
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:20,160
You and your mate are expecting pups. You must now carve out your own territory here in the lower slopes of amethyst mountain later

1518
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:24,400
But for just for the pups are born in two months. You must find a good den within your territory

1519
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:28,640
Other packs are also expecting puppies. So they're establishing and expanding their territories, too

1520
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:33,120
You need to make sure you claim enough space to create a safe buffer to protect your vulnerable pups from them

1521
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Okay

1522
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
potential den sites

1523
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:44,640
potential dens face south to catch what the spring sunshine must turn out about great

1524
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:49,440
I'm an area by marking it

1525
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:54,480
Okay, fifth I need 15 hexes

1526
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:57,840
Okay, uh, cuz like

1527
02:33:58,480 --> 02:34:02,000
Oh, we can eat this meat. Not that meat. The meat's still good

1528
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:07,440
I won't even let me interact with it. Um, sorry. I'm locked on you. Oh, you're like covered in snow

1529
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:09,440
I'm covered in snow

1530
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:12,720
Okay

1531
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:15,120
So limar

1532
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:20,560
They're gonna be down here

1533
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:26,480
So we should probably work our territory around this area. So I want to

1534
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:28,880
aim

1535
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:30,880
over here

1536
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:33,280
Like right over here

1537
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:35,440
near. Yeah, like this area

1538
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:38,000
Spawn rock

1539
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,880
And like because just because of the elk is all going to be down here

1540
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,240
And there I think you probably steal their shit

1541
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, can I set a marker?

1542
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:51,200
How do I make a marker?

1543
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:58,000
Add custom marker, please. I would like a marker. How do I add a marker? How do I add it?

1544
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:08,320
Is that

1545
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:10,800
Is that just how do I fucking?

1546
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:17,840
How do I get to how do I make the fucking marker?

1547
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:24,240
I just want to make a destination

1548
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:30,160
Uh destination final destination right here

1549
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:32,160
I

1550
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:37,280
Can't do anything with it though

1551
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:44,720
I wish I could just like mark it like it's fucking Elden Ring, but I think it's just it's not that's not what it is

1552
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:51,360
Okay, I think I'm misinterpreting what that means sex alive

1553
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:54,880
Sorry, I'll just start sex alive

1554
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,840
Okay, we ran into a lot of these wolves

1555
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:04,640
Who do we kill moved elsewhere with mate?

1556
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:17,520
All right

1557
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:23,760
Shanks, let me aim myself in the right direction. I think it's this is this way. Oh, I can eat this now

1558
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,880
I'm nom nom deli. So

1559
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,080
Coyote

1560
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:34,160
Let's go up here

1561
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:50,480
Oh, there's a nearby den site too. Is that the den? No, that's just a rock

1562
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:53,280
I

1563
02:36:56,400 --> 02:37:01,440
Want to get a little bit closer to the Lamar. Yeah

1564
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:05,760
For a

1565
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:09,920
Because I bet I'll have run into a den on the way there and dens are so irritating to find

1566
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:13,760
I remember searching for like an hour when I was younger trying to find a den

1567
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,920
And it was just like really weirdly like how they

1568
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:20,800
Helped you because they use ascent markers for everything and you could never tell which direction shit was in

1569
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:25,360
Okay, we're gonna slide down this hill

1570
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:31,840
Wait, hold on. Let me just make sure. Yeah, we're good. I don't want to slide down into enemy territory and get fucking stuck

1571
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,600
All I see is whiteness

1572
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:39,600
It is a absolute blizzard out here. Okay. It was supposed to thunderstorm and it hasn't

1573
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:42,400
I can't what's happening

1574
02:37:46,480 --> 02:37:50,000
Is is it not gonna rain today? Why do we have a thunderstorm warning if it's not gonna even rain?

1575
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:54,000
I wanted it to thunder either thunder

1576
02:37:55,840 --> 02:38:01,600
Okay, where are we close just go a little bit angle. Yeah

1577
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:10,880
I want to get right up to their hexagon

1578
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,640
Although it's gonna be such a bitch to maintain the territory territory because it's a ridge right there

1579
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:24,400
It's fine

1580
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:41,600
As far as there's like no fucking dens in the area

1581
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:47,760
Do you mean what are you gonna name your children? I don't know. We'll have to see how many puppies

1582
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:49,760
I have and if they even fucking live, you know

1585
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:18,720

Okay, cool

02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:49,920

1593
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:08,640
Okay, I'm still in my territory. I hate that our territory is like yellow colored. I wish I could make it something else

1594
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:18,160
I really want to be up against this lake because like fresh water. That's where they go, you know

1595
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000

Should go let's see

1602
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:54,480
I could probably claim some of their territory because it's weak

1603
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:02,720
I wonder if I will be able to piss on somebody else's territory

1604
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:11,680
Speed up. I was actually already going max speed awkward

1605

1616
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:25,040
So I literally have to find the scent post in order to claim it for myself. That's dumb

1617
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:34,000
Okay, maybe I'll just focus on doing my own hexes then let's just pee here

1618
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:41,680
To pee right next to this fucking tree

1619
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:51,120
Cool should have been more strategic on where I peed but it's fine

1620
02:42:54,880 --> 02:42:58,240
You just try to pee next to a landmark so I can remember where the fuck it is

1621
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:05,760
Oh, I'm like right on the edge of both our territories, huh? All right, let's keep going this way

1622
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:13,760
We're gonna have to break into their territory and steal their elk

1623
02:43:14,480 --> 02:43:15,440
Oh

1624
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:17,600

Fossil forest

1630
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:39,920
Fossil forest is like

1631
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:43,760
In a really bitchy place so I kind of don't want to mark over here

1632
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:47,840
Because climbing hills is such a thing

1633
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,600
But it seems like I have to

1634
02:43:58,320 --> 02:44:00,320
Piss next to this rock

1635
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:05,520

Damn, this is gonna take fucking forever, bro

1639
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:29,760
I keep thinking these are wolves, but it's just a fucking branch looks like the back of a wolf

1640
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:40,400
At least I can climb up this hill. Uh, not that well. Nope, never mind

1641
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:44,640

Where are the rocks for me to piss on?

1652
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:37,040

1694
02:50:09,440 --> 02:50:11,440
I

1695
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:21,520
Just watched that the other again the other day and I was like, oh this movie's so fucking funny. It's just great. Okay. Let's go over here

02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:38,400
Such a hard-working mother. I'm just I'm just running around pregnant doing all this shit. Can you believe that?

1698
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,880

02:50:44,320 --> 02:50:47,120
Don't wanna okay cool cool cool cool

1700
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:53,680
How many dens are in a territory? I don't even know it's like two one

02:50:58,640 --> 02:51:03,440
Is that a den over there that big ass tree my pee at that big ass tree

02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:21,280
Okay, then we'll keep going straight now

1706
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:25,760
Just running in a circle

1707
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:30,160
Not much to do

1708
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:38,080
Really getting in the wolf minds that wolves don't leave in trees. It doesn't matter. It's a cool tree to piss on

1709
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:40,800
As they fall down a fucking hill

1710
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:46,160
We're going after this pack we're taking their fucking territory

1711
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:49,520
It's like fucking jenga

1712
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:51,520
I wonder if we can because again

1713
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:53,360
When I played this game

1714
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:58,560
When I was younger you could it was up to the point where you could have puppies and that was it and then they

1715
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:03,520
It's either that you let them live or they died, but you couldn't like expand the pack after that

1716
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:05,600
So if you can that's very cool to me

1717
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:13,520
Oh that thing just fucking juked me. Um, we can probably piss anywhere right for this one

1718
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:19,680
Where's a good spot to piss in this place I'm just trying to try to piss in a nice spot

1719
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:26,640
I don't really think they left a set marker so I'm just gonna put it right here

1720
02:52:29,120 --> 02:52:31,120
Oh

1721
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:36,880
Oh my god my ass hurts from sitting

1722
02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:39,920

1724
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:51,600
We're going around the border

1725
02:52:52,640 --> 02:52:55,360
We're very strategic in our placement

1726
02:52:56,160 --> 02:53:01,280
We need we need strong borders for our family nice scenic view for the piss spot exactly

1727
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:07,600
Let's see, where are we going?

1728
02:53:08,880 --> 02:53:12,400
Oh, I'm going the wrong way. I need to go this way. Nope

1729
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,320
What how the fuck did I get turned around?

1730
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,120
Okay, I guess it's this way then

1731
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:25,120
I

1732
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:28,640
Haven't seen one other den and I'm running all over the fucking place

1733
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:33,600
That's an Oreo blizzard. Oh my god, sweetie. You want an Oreo blizzard?

1734
02:53:39,360 --> 02:53:45,360
Then nearby here we go. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, okay. We don't I don't want cougars near a den though

1735
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,040

1736
02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:51,760

1737
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:56,080
This fucking nope, that's just a cool ass rock. I'm gonna piss right here

1738
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:07,280
I would rather not have a cougar near the den. Where is it?

1739
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
So this nearby

1740
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:14,960
Okay

1741
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:23,520
Am I close I don't I know it changes color. Nope. I'm going farther away because it's like this

1742
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:25,760
It's just like it's hot or cold and it's dumb

1743
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:28,560
The hot and cold

1744
02:54:32,880 --> 02:54:38,320
Where is it then? Okay, I guess it's in this direction heading east

1745
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:42,640
No, is this the den? I don't

1746
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:46,480
This has to be it

1747
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,520
No, damn I should have pissed at the top of this

1748
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:56,560
Because it's turning orange like right over here

1749
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:00,880
Where's the fucking den by nautical

1750
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:07,280
There's no den smell

1751
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:10,720
Oh

1752
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:18,880
My god, this is it didn't take me a fucking bazillion years to find out where the fucking den is

1753
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:28,880
Farther away. Yep. It's so this direction it's fucking cougar out of here

1754
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:41,920
Why I don't understand what the fuck I just like fell down this cliff face if I go this way

1755
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:47,600
Oh, it turned why is it only orange right here?

1756
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:51,280
I don't

1757
02:55:51,280 --> 02:55:56,480
Is there supposed to be I feel like there's supposed to be one here. I don't maybe I'm supposed to fill up the thing

1758
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:58,640
I don't know

1759
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:03,600
There's two homeless puppies pissing everywhere

1760
02:56:12,400 --> 02:56:14,400
I have to find four dens

1761
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:23,200
How am I supposed to get four fucking debt what?

1762
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:30,000
You're actually fucked bro. You're actually fucked if you think I'm gonna find this shit when you're not even giving me the

1763
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,960
Scent markers to find them. You're just giving me hot and cold

1764
02:56:33,360 --> 02:56:37,280
Stupid dumb shit. I don't care anymore. I'm gonna focus on the hexes

1765
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:42,160
Come here

1766
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:50,640
You hungry here you can have it. Well you bro take a bite

1767
02:56:53,440 --> 02:56:55,440
You want it?

1768
02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:02,880
Can I see something can I tell him to eat? No, okay

1769
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:09,680
Family's not gonna last winter if we can't do this bro

1770
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:15,360
I'm going the wrong way. There we go. That's better

1771
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:27,760
There's four densites you have actually got to be out of your mind

1772
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:33,360
I don't ever I know I hope acts because I remember doing like this

1773
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:36,320
It was I think it was like three or two densites when I was younger

1774
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:40,800
But it was such a pain to find them because like they weren't obvious

1775
02:57:41,680 --> 02:57:48,960
Anything like that giant fucking rock would be obvious, but it wasn't. Um, is there any nice thing to piss on around here? No

1776
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:56,560
No, no pissable items. No pissable scenery. Okay, I guess I'll just piss in the middle right here

1777
02:57:57,280 --> 02:57:59,280
There's this dead tree. How about that?

1778
02:58:06,080 --> 02:58:09,840
Cool. All right, let's uh

1779
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:17,600
I could go for those hexes in the corner, but I'm not going to right now

1780
02:58:18,480 --> 02:58:20,480
See yeah, I'll go for

1781
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:23,520
These hexes over here

1782
02:58:24,880 --> 02:58:27,360
I feel like I'm playing a really bad chest chest

1783
02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:40,240
Love the tune you get for peeing on something I love the sound

1784
02:58:41,600 --> 02:58:43,600
the the fucking

1785
02:58:43,760 --> 02:58:45,040
game

1786
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:46,480
sounds

1787
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:48,560
In music it's just so great

1788
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:52,160
It's a great pissable rock

1789
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:55,600
Oh going the wrong way

1790
02:58:56,400 --> 02:58:58,400
There we go

1791
02:59:01,440 --> 02:59:03,440
That's a great pissable rock

1792
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:10,560
Too close

1793
02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:14,640
That rock right there

1794
02:59:15,440 --> 02:59:22,000
It's just gonna be it. Nope still in the territory. What the fuck? Oh wait, it's like right near it

1795
02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:25,200
Oh, okay

1796
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:27,200
We'll piss right near it

1797
02:59:28,160 --> 02:59:30,160
Let's go buy nautical

1798
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:35,040
This again

1799
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:37,840
I need to find a set marker for this one

1800
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:47,760
That's doom

1801
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:53,920
At least there's like food around

1802
02:59:57,760 --> 03:00:02,640
I feel like my field of view is so fucking narrow that I can't even see where shit might be

1803
03:00:10,240 --> 03:00:12,240
I'm gonna piss

1804
03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:17,840
Sick, okay, I guess I just couldn't piss in the other spot before

1805
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:27,520
Nice all right, we stole that from them and then we're just gonna go up here

1806
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:34,640
Fuck is up with the music

1807
03:00:35,840 --> 03:00:37,840
Is there somebody nearby I don't

1808
03:00:39,680 --> 03:00:41,680
Why is there boss music

1809
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:44,160

Already

1811
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:54,160
That was pretty ominous your field of view is worse than that. Honestly the field of view in this game is horrible

1812
03:01:03,280 --> 03:01:08,320
Am I too tired? Oh, I am too tired doesn't fucking let's go to sleep, bro

1813
03:01:08,880 --> 03:01:12,720
Great, I bet they're gonna get more territory when we wake up

1814
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:17,040
Oh, he hatched closer to me. That's really sweet

1815
03:01:24,320 --> 03:01:26,320

03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:32,400
Oh, they fucking this is so annoying to maintain

1817
03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:36,080
Am I gonna have to be pissing everywhere?

1818
03:01:36,320 --> 03:01:38,320

03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:51,040
Dead nearby. Oh, is this a dead? Nope. It's gone. You know, I already lost it. Where is it?

1820
03:01:52,320 --> 03:01:54,960

Thank you. Hello, welcome in

03:10:30,640 --> 03:10:38,880
Okay, it really doesn't matter which hacks I go into

1908

Look at these mises I'm gonna piss right next to them to assert dominance

1909
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:53,680
Wow, that's great that a den is nearby

Okay, I need one more fucking hex

1913
03:11:14,400 --> 03:11:16,400
Am I going the right way? Okay

1914
03:11:23,840 --> 03:11:28,800
Rock piss in time. Oh my god

1915
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:33,040
Cat lost it

1916
03:11:33,680 --> 03:11:36,880
Boomi's laying in the bed and Fiya wants to lay in the bed with him

1917
03:11:38,320 --> 03:11:41,840
Very cool. And then Boomi just pushed her off my desk

1918
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:49,280
Pop maxing is going coming along slowly

1919
03:11:49,280 --> 03:11:53,360
Okay, I'm running around the rabbit in my mouth

1920
03:11:55,680 --> 03:11:58,080
What what are you doing?

1921
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:01,760
Why are you freaking up? Hi Boomi

1922
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:05,760
You're just an epi boy. You're so you're bigger than this bed now. Holy crap

1923
03:12:06,160 --> 03:12:10,720
Hey, I mean, you're a new boy. You could just feet right in you. You know you're two beings

1924
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:17,600
Are she break? I don't know I heard something crash

1925
03:12:18,800 --> 03:12:22,560
She's like I think she's trying to jump up on something. It just didn't work out

1926
03:12:23,200 --> 03:12:25,200
Let me have a munch. Thank you

1927
03:12:26,880 --> 03:12:28,880
Okay, I filled up 15 hexes

1928
03:12:36,240 --> 03:12:38,640
I must have at least 15 hexes at this time

1929
03:12:39,360 --> 03:12:41,360
What the fuck

1930
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:46,320
Why is this on easy and it's more difficult

1931
03:12:50,480 --> 03:12:56,640
I have to find the densites. Oh actually just yeah, I'm gonna pass out right here

1932
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:11,600
Oh

1933
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:23,360
Okay, it doesn't mean walk in front of my screen mister. Yeah, you can sit there. That's fine. Listen on my keyboard

1934
03:13:24,320 --> 03:13:26,320
um

1935
03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:41,600
Which way the fuck is this thing?

1936
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:47,120
Come on by on a call

1937
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:55,440
It is probably should be I'm not running at full speed all the time Boomi is staring at my wolf on my screen and trying to bap it

1938
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:04,400
Then nearby Boomi, can you find the den? Can you not play with my wires though sweetness?

1939
03:14:05,200 --> 03:14:07,200
I

1940
03:14:07,760 --> 03:14:11,760
Think you're right. Whoever said dens always face south

1941
03:14:13,120 --> 03:14:18,480
Um, I feel like if I went back on the opposite direction, I'd be able to find it. Boomi. I can't see

1942
03:14:20,560 --> 03:14:23,040
I'm gonna let you get down. Can you

1943
03:14:24,480 --> 03:14:26,480
And so can you move?

1944
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:29,280
Can you get down?

1945
03:14:30,160 --> 03:14:32,160
I

1946
03:14:32,720 --> 03:14:34,720
Please

1947
03:14:36,640 --> 03:14:40,880
Beggin you bro. Thank you. Boomi the den sniffer

1948
03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:57,200
Come on, come on, come on. I want I'm just like it's gonna I wish it didn't fade so fast like

1949
03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:00,160
The um

1950
03:15:00,240 --> 03:15:02,240
Why'd you just place your paw on my hand?

1951
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:06,320
Boomi, what's up, dude? Do you want to be held? What do you want?

1952
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:08,800
Come here

1953
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:11,520
Oh big boy. Oh, you're so big

1954
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:14,080
Hi

1955
03:15:14,080 --> 03:15:15,680
You're gonna shit

1956
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:17,680
You're just hanging out

1957
03:15:18,800 --> 03:15:20,800
You're so warm

1958
03:15:21,600 --> 03:15:23,600
Hi

1959
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:26,160
He's like sitting on my lap like he's a kid

1960
03:15:27,840 --> 03:15:29,840
He just sits like a woman

1961
03:15:30,320 --> 03:15:32,320
Boomi's trying to tell me the secret den location

1962
03:15:33,920 --> 03:15:35,920
You're trying to tell me the secret den location

1963
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:39,600
No

1964
03:15:40,160 --> 03:15:48,160
He just got a fucking limp in my arms. Okay. Um, here let me put you in the bed. Oh my god, you're so heavy

1965
03:15:48,560 --> 03:15:55,760
He's also really interested in my headphones because he wants to play with them

1966
03:15:58,080 --> 03:16:05,280
No, you cannot have go away. You also just took my headphone out of my ear

1967
03:16:05,280 --> 03:16:16,400
Okay, I didn't mean to sit

1968
03:16:17,280 --> 03:16:22,400
No, it's not the most depressed. All right. There's one fucking hex. Yeah one

1969
03:16:22,480 --> 03:16:29,120
I feel like the hexes should last longer than when I fall asleep. They're not just fucking gone because that's also just not realistic

1970
03:16:35,360 --> 03:16:37,360
This game isn't realistic enough

1971
03:16:40,400 --> 03:16:44,160
Oh, I'm going the wrong fucking way. Okay, almost there

1972
03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:58,960
The house is what boomi the cat is this house is people no boomi is bumi

1973
03:17:00,320 --> 03:17:03,840
For because he's the king of umashu. I'm just gonna fucking pee anywhere

1974
03:17:05,280 --> 03:17:07,280
Okay

1975
03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:12,640
Okay, let's go south

1976
03:17:15,760 --> 03:17:17,760
Let me just

1977
03:17:18,720 --> 03:17:20,720
Then nearby

1978
03:17:22,480 --> 03:17:24,480
I wish I would just show up in a marker

1979
03:17:28,080 --> 03:17:32,560
I lost it already this way because wait

1980
03:17:35,280 --> 03:17:37,280
I

1981
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,000
Yeah, this is the right color

1982
03:17:49,760 --> 03:17:51,760
At it

1983
03:17:51,840 --> 03:17:57,920
Please be a den. No, it's just a fucking rock. Um, I face the south

1984
03:17:58,480 --> 03:18:00,480
I

1985
03:18:02,080 --> 03:18:08,160
Feels like it should be like right over here the snow is getting in my eyes

1986
03:18:14,400 --> 03:18:23,440
This oh, it's just another big rock. It's not a boner. It's a rock. It's a rock over here

1987
03:18:24,320 --> 03:18:29,840
Am I getting clenope it turned? Okay over here

1988
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:40,480
Guys I'm not going crazy right like what it's supposed to then discover what the fuck

1989
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:44,160
Oh, what?

1990
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:51,920
How the fuck am I supposed to see that this is just a pile of fucking snow, dude

1991
03:18:54,320 --> 03:18:56,320
What

1992
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:05,760
Okay, because I'm like how am I supposed to find any dens and I'm looking for like like a pile of sticks or rocks like in

1993
03:19:05,760 --> 03:19:07,760
The form of a den shape

1994
03:19:08,320 --> 03:19:11,680
I guess because that's what it looks like in the game like before when I played it

1995
03:19:11,680 --> 03:19:13,360
it was just like usually

1996
03:19:13,360 --> 03:19:18,320
Usually looks like this and you would turn on the other side and then there's like a little hole in this and that's where you

1997
03:19:18,320 --> 03:19:23,680
Would have the pops and shit. Okay. Well, let's find others. I guess and pee on the way

1998
03:19:27,840 --> 03:19:29,840
Um

1999
03:19:30,560 --> 03:19:33,920
Because I'm closest to this one over here. I'm just gonna go

2000
03:19:39,360 --> 03:19:42,240
Start global warming. Hello, welcome in

2001
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:45,600
We are wolves

2002
03:19:45,840 --> 03:19:50,080
Because I'm gonna play that song if anybody clips me can you play the we are wolves?

2003
03:19:50,320 --> 03:19:53,280
We run as one or whatever

2004
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:56,160
However, fuck it goes

2005
03:19:56,880 --> 03:19:58,880
I'm gonna piss in your fucking thing

2006
03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:06,080
Ah, bitch I got

2007
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:14,400
Okay, now I have just have to look for uneven patches of snow on the ground that'll make it a lot easier that's for sure

2008
03:20:15,840 --> 03:20:17,840
You

2009
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:32,080
Okay as many hexes in a short term as possible

2010
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:36,560
Okay

2011
03:20:39,440 --> 03:20:42,160
All right, gotcha

2012
03:20:45,920 --> 03:20:50,320
I don't like how they took that red. I don't feel like hunting for their marks

2013
03:20:50,320 --> 03:20:54,320
So we're gonna look for the dens the dens are the priority. We're just gonna run around

2014
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:57,920
And look for dens

2015
03:21:01,440 --> 03:21:03,440
This is literally

2016
03:21:03,440 --> 03:21:09,760
I didn't think we'd take this long to just pop max. It's it's pop slow right now. It's pop. We're pop minning

2017
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:15,120
Where am I

2018
03:21:16,240 --> 03:21:18,240
I

2019
03:21:19,760 --> 03:21:21,760
Can I pee

2020
03:21:26,800 --> 03:21:30,960
Um, yeah, it's actually good that I'm I can just run through and piss on places

2021
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:34,640
But then I have to make sure I'm in the right fucking hex to do it

2022
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:39,200
This is a dumb game mechanic

2023
03:21:39,760 --> 03:21:42,800
I will tell you that dead nearby. All right dead nearby guys

2024
03:21:43,440 --> 03:21:48,160
Keep an eye out for weird shit. Give me this fucking rabbit. I'm hungry. Yo

2025
03:21:52,400 --> 03:21:54,960
You want that I wish I could like feed him

2026
03:21:58,480 --> 03:22:04,480
Where's the den where's the den am I in the right spot? I don't know. Okay again

2027
03:22:04,640 --> 03:22:14,160
Um, oh, okay, okay, I'm just gonna walk slowly

2028
03:22:18,480 --> 03:22:20,480
This is so stupid

2029
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,000
Okay, we're getting warmer

2030
03:22:25,280 --> 03:22:27,280
We're very warm

2031
03:22:27,600 --> 03:22:30,720
Do you guys see any misshapen snow on the ground?

2032
03:22:35,280 --> 03:22:37,280
No, it's over here

2033
03:22:45,200 --> 03:22:47,200
I don't is that one

2034
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:52,960
Oh, see it looks like this shit

2035
03:22:56,880 --> 03:22:59,280
Oh, okay, see this looks like an actual fucking den

2036
03:22:59,680 --> 03:23:08,560
I got a den max for the pep max. That's exactly right. Yeah, turn on a fucking late max. I can't reach

2037
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:17,200
Now that's a den

2038
03:23:18,240 --> 03:23:20,240
That's a den if I've ever seen one

2039
03:23:21,280 --> 03:23:23,280
Oh, there's thank yous over here

2040
03:23:24,320 --> 03:23:27,360
There is really is green tea. What is this?

2041
03:23:27,760 --> 03:23:32,880
It looks like this isn't in English. It looks like seaweed popcorn

2042
03:23:35,840 --> 03:23:38,640
But it smells like caramel, but it looks like it has seaweed on it. What is this?

2043
03:23:45,600 --> 03:23:48,960
It tastes like peanut brittle. No, it tastes like caramel corn. Oh, it's pretty good

2044
03:23:52,320 --> 03:23:54,320
Look rice puffs

2045
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:57,200
It's in Korean so I can't read it

2046
03:23:59,360 --> 03:24:06,400
Oh, it's like lightly caramelized rice puffs with like little like little burnt pieces like a marshmallow

2047
03:24:10,320 --> 03:24:12,320
Hey, that's pretty good

2048
03:24:16,400 --> 03:24:18,400
Oh shit, there's another high chew in here

2049
03:24:18,400 --> 03:24:26,320
Yeah, whoever drives this is Elder Scrolls fan

2050
03:24:28,640 --> 03:24:30,720
Maybe you never know

2051
03:24:33,440 --> 03:24:35,440
I want you on this high too

2052
03:24:38,960 --> 03:24:40,960
I'm tangled up in wires

2053
03:24:48,640 --> 03:24:53,760
Okay, I am pretty tired

2054
03:25:02,560 --> 03:25:04,800
I wish I could just make that the den because it looks badass

2055
03:25:13,200 --> 03:25:16,000
What a shot I take a picture

2056
03:25:18,800 --> 03:25:20,800
Gorgeous

2057
03:25:27,200 --> 03:25:29,200
Hi boomie

2058
03:25:30,800 --> 03:25:38,960
Okay, let's see the fucking damage Jesus Christ this purple pack is taking over holy shit

2059
03:25:42,480 --> 03:25:44,480
Oh my god

2060
03:25:44,720 --> 03:25:48,000
I need to steal some hexes back. Oh my god Jesus

2061
03:25:54,160 --> 03:25:56,160
Um

2062
03:25:56,880 --> 03:25:58,880
Let's see I should probably go

2063
03:26:01,360 --> 03:26:03,360
This way towards that one

2064
03:26:05,200 --> 03:26:10,160
Right it's coming out right in purple or fucking in it to win it

2065
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:12,800
Speed it up

2066
03:26:13,520 --> 03:26:17,040
Look at him look at me lovingly as we run. He's not even watching where he's going

2067
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:20,080
I'm happy I picked

2068
03:26:20,080 --> 03:26:22,080
Vynautical, you know

2069
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:23,280
He's a good guy

2070
03:26:23,280 --> 03:26:25,280
Made am I in the

2071
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:29,520
I want to make sure I go down to this one first

2072
03:26:35,440 --> 03:26:37,440
I wish there was like a den

2073
03:26:38,160 --> 03:26:45,040
I wish there was like a den in each. Oh, no, that's fine little hex so I wouldn't have to worry so much

2074
03:26:48,800 --> 03:26:51,680
Jesus well actually I can cut down the middle between these

2075
03:26:56,160 --> 03:27:02,000
Why does it take me forever to cross into my own territory wait did I just go in the wrong direction? Okay, I know I did

2076
03:27:08,400 --> 03:27:10,400
Okay, I think I could piss

2078
03:27:35,280 --> 03:27:37,280

2079
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:39,600
Just got out you got to renew the markers bro

2080
03:27:40,560 --> 03:27:42,960
Atreides are getting their asses handed to them

2081
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:50,560
Den nearby den nearby everybody slow down grab the wall

2082
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:55,520
Is it this way?

2083
03:27:56,320 --> 03:27:58,320
Nope this way

2084
03:27:58,960 --> 03:28:00,960
Den nearby

2085
03:28:01,360 --> 03:28:03,360
Trying to find the direction

2086
03:28:06,080 --> 03:28:11,120
Color is not changing. Oh now it is. All right, we're getting a little warmer

2087
03:28:15,680 --> 03:28:23,040
Oh, we are on fire is it that over there? I'm gonna hope these let it be it

2088
03:28:25,200 --> 03:28:27,200
No, this is just a rock

2089
03:28:28,400 --> 03:28:32,000
Again, it's just a rock. Wait, how is this a den? Oh that

2090
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:36,800
Oh, I see you see how hard this is how the fuck am I supposed to see that?

2091
03:28:40,400 --> 03:28:42,400
Okay, I already peed here can I pee again?

2092
03:28:45,120 --> 03:28:47,120
This is a good den site though

2093
03:28:59,200 --> 03:29:01,200
All right, I mean

2094
03:29:03,040 --> 03:29:05,440
This way yes this way

2095
03:29:07,680 --> 03:29:12,240
Bro, you fits in that. I don't know. It's like really hard to like to

2096
03:29:14,720 --> 03:29:20,640
Catch them because they're like in weird places. They don't they're not like immediately obvious or highlighted

2097
03:29:20,800 --> 03:29:22,800
I

2098
03:29:25,760 --> 03:29:30,560
Also might take a purple slot just because they're getting a little bit too frisky for me. There's another den nearby

2099
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:32,720
What?

2100
03:29:32,720 --> 03:29:34,720
You're fucking with me. Where?

2101
03:29:35,840 --> 03:29:37,840
Where's the den?

2102
03:29:38,720 --> 03:29:41,200
Why am I suddenly now coming across all the dens?

2103
03:29:41,200 --> 03:29:43,200
Is

2104
03:29:48,320 --> 03:29:55,200
The right direction I can't really tell this is the right right nope. It's not about this way

2105
03:30:04,240 --> 03:30:07,920
Okay, is there gonna be one in the middle of nothing over here? I don't

2106
03:30:08,320 --> 03:30:10,320
I

2107
03:30:17,440 --> 03:30:23,520
Don't want a den so close to them. Hello. Oh, didn't I already discover this one?

2108
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:31,120
What the are they all just deciding to show up? I don't I'm quite pissed

2109
03:30:31,520 --> 03:30:33,520
I

2110
03:30:35,200 --> 03:30:40,080
Don't think I want one on the edge of the territory why why have you just started some fries some chicken

2111
03:30:40,080 --> 03:30:42,400
I know he's not he's not pissing as much as I thought he would

2112
03:30:45,200 --> 03:30:47,200
Okay, we're we're pretty strong over here

2113
03:30:54,320 --> 03:30:56,320
Um

2114
03:30:56,640 --> 03:30:58,640
Oh

2115
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:01,040

2116
03:31:02,480 --> 03:31:04,480
All right, I'm taking this fucking one over here

2117
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:08,720
Where is it?

2118
03:31:09,440 --> 03:31:11,440
Oh

2119
03:31:12,080 --> 03:31:20,560
Male dispersal moves. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here's your fucking marker. It's mine

2120
03:31:21,360 --> 03:31:23,360
In the center

2121
03:31:24,880 --> 03:31:34,320
Why am I getting an autosave? It's because there's moose right here. I don't care about the moose. I care about the piss

2122
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:40,000
I go up here

2123
03:31:40,240 --> 03:31:42,240
Why can't I find?

2124
03:31:46,320 --> 03:31:48,880
What the fuck is this hex I buy an article

2125
03:31:50,560 --> 03:31:52,560
I

2126
03:32:11,520 --> 03:32:13,520
Know we're good

2127
03:32:14,640 --> 03:32:19,600
We weakened it but it doesn't seem that it wants to let us take it

2128
03:32:21,280 --> 03:32:28,320
Let me how much piss do I have in my body I can piss so much

2129
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:31,120
There's me saying pissing. I don't want it

2130
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:39,360
Hmm, I can't find their marker. So maybe it I don't do I just have to piss another spot

2131
03:32:43,360 --> 03:32:45,760
All right, I'm just gonna piss everywhere. How about that?

2132
03:32:50,560 --> 03:32:57,440
It just keeps doing the fucking noise, but it's not changing color and it should be because it's at 50%

2133
03:33:00,560 --> 03:33:02,560
There's no site sent marker

2134
03:33:05,360 --> 03:33:07,760
We're not really that hungry so I don't have to worry about that right now

2135
03:33:10,240 --> 03:33:14,000
Well, and now we're in their territory and I don't want to go that far

2136
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:26,240
I thought I heard a wolf grow

2137
03:33:30,880 --> 03:33:32,880
This is stupid

2138
03:33:34,320 --> 03:33:39,920
Okay, so on this little baby tree. Let me take over this spot

2139
03:33:44,080 --> 03:33:49,920
This game about is like Russ. Yeah, you're literally just a wolf. You're not that's that's a little yet. You're just a wolf

2140
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:57,840
And you hunt and you raise puppies. How the fuck did I get over here again? I went in the wrong direction

2141
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:04,160
Pissing over here

2142
03:34:09,840 --> 03:34:12,400
I am piss maxing right now

2143
03:34:14,720 --> 03:34:16,720
Come here

2144
03:34:17,200 --> 03:34:23,200
Get him. I got him. I got him. We're eating good tonight, baby

2145
03:34:26,080 --> 03:34:30,480
We are eating good tonight by nautical. You're so great, honey. Keep it up

2146
03:34:32,400 --> 03:34:37,120
Oh my god, lovely. Oh, I didn't mean to fucking jump, but okay. Can I slow down?

2147
03:34:40,480 --> 03:34:44,000

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Oh fuck

2149
03:34:56,000 --> 03:34:58,000
Damn

2150
03:34:58,480 --> 03:35:00,480
And it sucks because we need to sleep

2151
03:35:02,080 --> 03:35:06,080
Okay, I don't have to eat um very good. Let me how

2152
03:35:08,320 --> 03:35:10,320
Mark the spot

2153
03:35:14,160 --> 03:35:16,160
It's impressively bad pathing

2154
03:35:16,800 --> 03:35:18,800
Listen

2155
03:35:20,720 --> 03:35:24,880
Trying my best out here look at this fucking little guy. It's a little little eagle hanging out

2156
03:35:32,800 --> 03:35:34,800
I'm wondering if I shouldn't

2157
03:35:35,440 --> 03:35:39,760
Be running as much but I don't really think stamina has to do with my exhaustion. It doesn't

2158
03:35:40,560 --> 03:35:42,560
Seem to be that much affected by it

2159
03:35:44,320 --> 03:35:46,320
I'm taking over this hex

2160
03:35:46,720 --> 03:35:48,720
I

2161
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:05,120
The fuck is howling

2162
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:11,520
Oh, it's the raiding and I'm pissing everywhere. Oh god high raiders. I'm peeing all over the place. Don't look

2163
03:36:12,160 --> 03:36:14,160

2164
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:17,520
How is the stream I knew you

2165
03:36:19,920 --> 03:36:21,680
No

2166
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:23,680
I'm not a mom. I'm not a furry

2167
03:36:24,400 --> 03:36:26,960
I'm just being a wolf man

2168
03:36:28,080 --> 03:36:30,080
Peeler never been in the allocations

2169
03:36:33,120 --> 03:36:35,120
Oh my god, I'm waiting to class

2170
03:36:35,200 --> 03:36:36,800
Collapse from exhaustion

2171
03:36:36,800 --> 03:36:43,280
But hi raiders. We're playing wolf quest and I'm she be by the way if you don't know who I am if you don't then you're weird

We're looking for another den so we can raise our puppies

2176
03:36:57,920 --> 03:37:00,800
Before winter. Oh look at that fucking elk and we can also hunt

2177
03:37:01,920 --> 03:37:04,320
I'm not that hungry though. So I don't have to hunt him but

2178
03:37:04,960 --> 03:37:06,960
It's a big fucking elk

2179
03:37:07,440 --> 03:37:09,280
Shall we get it?

2180
03:37:09,280 --> 03:37:12,400

I

2205
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:44,480
Also don't have a lot of stamina so I can't hold on to him that for that long. He's really just walking around

2206
03:38:48,400 --> 03:38:50,400

2213
03:39:20,480 --> 03:39:23,200
That's that's how I do it. I'm a real alpha

2214
03:39:23,680 --> 03:39:24,720
You know

2215
03:39:24,720 --> 03:39:29,680
Not like these posers out here by a nautical is debating why he married me because he's like

2216
03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:32,080
Why did you put us in the situation?

2217
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:43,120
Is it possible to get your wolf strong enough to one shot everything? I don't think so. Well, you can again you can scale stuff in here

2218
03:39:44,560 --> 03:39:46,560
I need to find wait

2219
03:39:48,560 --> 03:39:52,160
I need 15 hexes. Oh, I did find four densites. Um

2220
03:39:54,240 --> 03:39:58,960
Because you get like perks and shit, which I don't know how that works what perks you get

2221
03:39:59,520 --> 03:40:01,040
um, but

2222
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:06,480
So far I have negative strength and negative health, but I have speed and stamina. That's why I'm fast as fuck when I run

2223
03:40:08,080 --> 03:40:10,080
Uh, I go really fast

2224
03:40:10,080 --> 03:40:15,600
Alpha she being her boy wife. Yes boy wife and girl boss. Is this a multiplayer? It is multiplayer

2225
03:40:16,240 --> 03:40:19,840
I I don't I haven't played multiplayer in a while when I remember playing

2226
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:24,080
I think you kind of five people in it, but I don't I wonder if it's more now that you could do

2227
03:40:24,720 --> 03:40:26,960
Um, I have to sleep now

2228
03:40:27,200 --> 03:40:33,360
Bro, oh my god purple pack is fucking us so bad that we have to sleep

2230
03:40:41,920 --> 03:40:43,920
Guys want to play with me in wolf quest

2231
03:40:45,440 --> 03:40:50,080
I love by the time we wake up, uh, everything will be fucking gone. There'll probably be a bear next to us

2232
03:40:50,240 --> 03:40:52,560
I want to be surprised. Is there a bear?

2233
03:40:53,920 --> 03:40:55,920
No, all right

2234
03:40:57,520 --> 03:40:59,520
I'm running too fast

2235
03:41:00,640 --> 03:41:06,320
See the damage. Okay, it's not that bad. It's not that bad. We're fine

2236
03:41:09,520 --> 03:41:13,040
We are going to look how big the moon is over there

We're fucking yapping we're gonna go up and then across

2238
03:41:23,440 --> 03:41:25,440

2239
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:30,160
Or all these coyotes just hanging out it's kind of weird. They're just like waiting for us to leave I guess

2240
03:41:35,120 --> 03:41:37,120
Or being chased by the coyotes, I don't

2241
03:41:39,840 --> 03:41:41,840
What the hell

2242
03:41:44,080 --> 03:41:46,080
I don't even know I don't they must

2243
03:41:48,160 --> 03:41:50,160
They're very loud

2244
03:41:50,400 --> 03:41:55,280
The alert girls from a pack. Oh that'd be fun. What's our pack? I don't even have a pack name

2245
03:41:55,840 --> 03:41:59,360
It doesn't let you name the pack. I think when I get puppies, I can name the pack

2246
03:42:01,520 --> 03:42:03,200
Okay, we're almost there

2247
03:42:03,200 --> 03:42:06,400
Let me have to find their fucking scent marker and take back the hexagon

2248
03:42:07,280 --> 03:42:09,280
I feel like I'm playing like

2249
03:42:09,280 --> 03:42:11,280
What is that game?

2250
03:42:11,280 --> 03:42:14,080
Strutego or fucking risk. I don't remember

2251
03:42:16,320 --> 03:42:18,320
Oh my god, strutego though

2252
03:42:18,320 --> 03:42:20,320
I remember playing that

2253
03:42:20,400 --> 03:42:22,320
Okay, we have to find the scent marker

2254
03:42:22,320 --> 03:42:27,440
So we got like smell a vision which is pretty cool smell a vision allows us to

2255
03:42:29,600 --> 03:42:31,600
Okay, where's their marker

2256
03:42:33,280 --> 03:42:36,560
Why do I smell a skull the fuck that's kind of weird

2257
03:42:38,960 --> 03:42:42,160
Um, we have to find their scent marker so we can write over it

2258
03:42:43,840 --> 03:42:45,840
I'm gonna piss right here

2259
03:42:46,800 --> 03:42:48,800
I

2260
03:42:51,840 --> 03:42:53,840
Don't even know what their strength is that

2261
03:42:55,280 --> 03:42:57,280
For the piss

2262
03:42:57,600 --> 03:43:01,120
Sellers of katana. Actually, yeah, it's that's more apt

2263
03:43:05,840 --> 03:43:09,680
I don't know how I don't see a marker. Wait, did I just see one?

2264
03:43:12,240 --> 03:43:14,240
No, I'm just fucking tripping

2265
03:43:14,960 --> 03:43:16,720
Because it's

2266
03:43:16,720 --> 03:43:18,720
What is that?

2267
03:43:18,720 --> 03:43:20,720
Oh, it's a carcass. I smell

2268
03:43:21,920 --> 03:43:24,640
Like what does the x stand for because usually it's like

2269
03:43:25,680 --> 03:43:30,240
It'll be a purple marker and they don't have a lot of colors in here just right here

2270
03:43:34,960 --> 03:43:37,280
Renew that then we're back in here

2271
03:43:38,160 --> 03:43:43,600
This is really just pissing simulator

2272
03:43:46,960 --> 03:43:49,760
Okay, we're taking this back though just good

2273
03:43:51,040 --> 03:43:55,920
So yeah, you can take stuff back by like howling peeing and just your presence there

2274
03:43:56,880 --> 03:44:02,880
We have to get 15 hexes at at least 50 strength in order for us to have puppies

2275
03:44:03,840 --> 03:44:05,840
Hi boomie

2276
03:44:08,240 --> 03:44:12,240
And I'm trying to take over this fucking hexagon because they stole it from me from before

2277
03:44:13,200 --> 03:44:16,080
I think if we go up this way we should be good

2278
03:44:20,080 --> 03:44:24,160
It's funny because I haven't seen any other wolves you think you'd see them like renewing shit

2279
03:44:26,080 --> 03:44:31,280
Boomy sweetie, what are you doing? It's like so she's sitting on my desk and staring at nothing

2280
03:44:32,240 --> 03:44:38,560
Oh my god purple pack stop being assholes

2281
03:44:43,600 --> 03:44:45,600
Something like this for for wild cats

2282
03:44:46,720 --> 03:44:48,000
Uh

2283
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:54,000
What is that is it like two hearts? I think there is a game like this for cats and I forget because I used to play that one

2284
03:44:54,000 --> 03:44:56,000
too when I was younger

2285
03:44:56,000 --> 03:44:58,880
Oh, yeah, I think I peed on top of this or I wanted to last time

2286
03:44:59,840 --> 03:45:06,560
Yeah, this will be the scent marker spot. Let's fucking go piss

2287
03:45:09,040 --> 03:45:15,600
Too soon relax. All right, then we're gonna go up boomy sweetie. I can't see past your girth

2288
03:45:16,800 --> 03:45:18,800
Your booty's in the way

2289
03:45:22,240 --> 03:45:26,080
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, we pissed off this cool tree

2290
03:45:26,640 --> 03:45:29,680
That's right cool tree pissing

2291
03:45:34,400 --> 03:45:39,120
It's a sick ass tree. See this would be a den site and you have like a little den in here like come on

2292
03:45:42,080 --> 03:45:44,720
The opportunity was there. Okay, I did not

2293
03:45:50,880 --> 03:45:52,880
I'll even show my sun markers

2294
03:45:56,560 --> 03:46:02,080
Yes, excuse me. What my cat's food is going off

2295
03:46:05,120 --> 03:46:09,920
What was it straw? He said in a call a camera. Yeah, I was on the call

2296
03:46:11,200 --> 03:46:17,600
Um, she's like, you know who my favorite character is in your streams and I'm like who she's like your cat's food dispenser going off

2297
03:46:19,840 --> 03:46:24,720
And she's because it like I forget if you're like having a meeting around the time it goes off in the afternoon

2298
03:46:25,680 --> 03:46:27,360
and

2299
03:46:27,360 --> 03:46:29,360
What the fuck didn't I just mark that?

2300
03:46:31,920 --> 03:46:36,160
And um, it went off and like totally

2301
03:46:37,600 --> 03:46:39,600
Uh surprise everybody

2302
03:46:43,360 --> 03:46:45,360
Let me just cross into mine real quick

2303
03:46:47,520 --> 03:46:51,440
Perfect. I'm just gonna literally on the edge of glory just pissing everywhere

2304
03:46:55,680 --> 03:46:59,600
Am I done yet? Like did I beat the fucking?

2305
03:47:02,800 --> 03:47:06,800
I needed them at 50 50 strength. Oh my god

2306
03:47:12,880 --> 03:47:19,600
Okay, then I literally just have to go to the ones on the top and do that. Okay fine. Hopefully they'll let us finish

2307
03:47:20,240 --> 03:47:27,520
Because I'm tired of running around I've literally been running around peeing for like the last two hours

2308
03:47:28,800 --> 03:47:31,760
This is my least favorite part of this game is the hex

2309
03:47:32,720 --> 03:47:34,560
game mechanic

2310
03:47:34,560 --> 03:47:38,160
Because things should not run out after four fictional hours

2311
03:47:39,600 --> 03:47:41,600
When your wolf sleeps for eight

2312
03:47:42,960 --> 03:47:44,960
Go up here

2313
03:47:49,680 --> 03:47:54,560
And it takes such a long time to run across a hex

2314
03:47:55,760 --> 03:47:57,760
Need a dispenser as a cast

2315
03:47:59,520 --> 03:48:01,520
I thought you were finishing like hair in this week

2316
03:48:13,280 --> 03:48:15,280
So close

2317
03:48:15,280 --> 03:48:17,280
I can almost taste it

2318
03:48:17,280 --> 03:48:19,280
Release your inhibition

2319
03:48:20,240 --> 03:48:22,240
cool

2320
03:48:28,480 --> 03:48:36,660
That's cool. Okay, perfect and then I can just cross into this one. All right, I'm on the edge. Perfect

2321
03:48:47,920 --> 03:48:54,560
Perfect. Okay. You've established a good territory. I found several potential dents. You and your mate are truly a pack now

2322
03:48:54,560 --> 03:48:56,800
So give your pack a name or ask for suggestions

2323
03:48:59,440 --> 03:49:03,680
Don't include pack a name as that will be added automatically suggest a name rebel pack

2324
03:49:04,160 --> 03:49:07,520
Tofacious pack prowler pack that sounds creepy as fuck

2325
03:49:11,200 --> 03:49:14,160
Fang pack hope creek pack that sounds pretty cool actually

2326
03:49:14,800 --> 03:49:20,960
Overlook fossil forest sleet galaxy slit stone ayo

2327
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:23,920
Woke up

2328
03:49:24,320 --> 03:49:26,320
Why do you give me slit stone twice? Pawsome

2329
03:49:27,440 --> 03:49:32,080
Hush, what are these fucking names pouncer pack? Why are they like tofacious so much?

2330
03:49:32,720 --> 03:49:36,480
Whitewater whitewater possum scar blizzard yogurt

2331
03:49:37,760 --> 03:49:39,600
Yogurt pack

2332
03:49:39,600 --> 03:49:42,400
The bum hunters pack pack his pack

2333
03:49:43,360 --> 03:49:45,360
I'm bringing piss pack

2334
03:49:46,320 --> 03:49:48,880
I'm bringing sexy pack. Okay. I think that's a good name

2335
03:49:50,400 --> 03:49:52,400
I think that's a great name

2336
03:49:54,000 --> 03:49:57,280
I'm bringing sexy

2337
03:50:01,040 --> 03:50:03,200
But except instead of back it's pack

2338
03:50:06,000 --> 03:50:09,440
Can I do a comma? No, I'm bringing sexy pack

2339
03:50:12,640 --> 03:50:14,640
Choose a den

2340
03:50:15,200 --> 03:50:17,200
Oh, fuck

2341
03:50:17,200 --> 03:50:19,520
You've established a territory in the slopes of anthos mountain

2342
03:50:19,520 --> 03:50:23,600
But remember you must maintain it even when your pups require all your time and attention great

2343
03:50:23,920 --> 03:50:28,320
Smaller your territory the more likely stranger wolves be tempted to come in and kill your pups great

2344
03:50:28,720 --> 03:50:32,720
It's most efficient mercury when hexes have dropped to 30 or 40 strength

2345
03:50:33,040 --> 03:50:35,200
Plane your hunting trips so you can mark hexes along the way

2346
03:50:36,880 --> 03:50:39,440
I don't think actual wolves have to deal with this

2347
03:50:39,440 --> 03:50:47,920
Find a den. Okay. I haven't gotten this far since I played the game a long time ago

2348
03:50:48,800 --> 03:50:53,280
So we'll see you see that twitter torrent of youtube or animations dancing to that song

2349
03:50:53,840 --> 03:50:56,320
Yes, I did. That's why I put in a sexy pack

2350
03:50:57,280 --> 03:50:59,280
I'm bringing sexy pack

2351
03:50:59,680 --> 03:51:01,680
yet

2352
03:51:01,680 --> 03:51:05,200
Your pups will be born soon and the snows begin to melt it's time to find a good dead site

2353
03:51:05,280 --> 03:51:08,160
There's no need to dig a new dent for yourself since there are many potential sites out there

2354
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:12,000
Cool, cool, cool

2355
03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:15,360
How to find a den they look different now the snow is melted

2356
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:22,720
Okay, now dens will emit float scents like before why didn't they do that before

2357
03:51:23,600 --> 03:51:28,640
Remember the dens are always in south facing slopes to catch as much as the spring sunshine. That's very cool. I didn't know that

2358
03:51:30,320 --> 03:51:34,720
Um, okay, so the they should already be marked for me

2359
03:51:34,960 --> 03:51:42,640
Show all dens. Oh, they're all down there. I'd rather have one up here are in the middle

2360
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:48,320
I think I'm gonna try to find one towards the middle

2361
03:51:50,400 --> 03:51:52,400
I didn't mean to pee but that's fine

2362
03:51:55,360 --> 03:51:57,360
It's fine

2363
03:52:02,080 --> 03:52:04,080
I should probably

2364
03:52:05,440 --> 03:52:07,440
Yeah, let's go across

2365
03:52:08,640 --> 03:52:12,320
I'm gonna try to find a den up here. I want one in the middle of the hexes

2366
03:52:13,600 --> 03:52:15,600
So I can just go into a circle when I want to

2367
03:52:19,920 --> 03:52:21,920
It's pop max in time

2368
03:52:24,400 --> 03:52:28,960
Oh look at the bison they'll probably fucking kill us. I'm how am I going the wrong way?

2369
03:52:30,080 --> 03:52:32,160
That doesn't make any fucking sense to me

2370
03:52:34,720 --> 03:52:36,720
I

2371
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:46,720
Don't wait I'll just piss here again

2372
03:52:49,200 --> 03:52:51,200
Thanks husband

2373
03:52:56,000 --> 03:52:59,280
Imagine you're just like an elk and you're just chilling with like hanging out with your herd

2374
03:52:59,280 --> 03:53:03,360
You see these wolves just run by and fucking piss everywhere then run away

2375
03:53:05,280 --> 03:53:13,120
I'm not going after them. I'm just trying to get to the hexagon. Please. Let me get to the right hexagon

2376
03:53:16,480 --> 03:53:18,480
Perfect

2377
03:53:24,960 --> 03:53:28,560
Cool, I'm not gonna bother with that one up top

2378
03:53:30,800 --> 03:53:32,800
Let's see

2379
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:35,600
Although would be well

2380
03:53:36,080 --> 03:53:37,840
It's fine

2381
03:53:37,840 --> 03:53:42,480
Let's go down here. Although if I do do one of the dens at the bottom

2382
03:53:42,560 --> 03:53:45,760
I can literally probably just take out that entire corner for myself

2383
03:53:46,320 --> 03:53:48,960
But that would take so much fucking time. I'm not I'm not feeling that

2384
03:53:50,160 --> 03:53:54,800
Had I known the dens are all in this bottom part. I would have done that but they don't tell you that

2385
03:53:56,240 --> 03:54:02,320
Let's see. I want to find more dense. Okay. There's some over here. Well, well because they're far away

2386
03:54:03,760 --> 03:54:05,760
They're probably just showing up as a marker

2387
03:54:12,880 --> 03:54:14,880
Tell me there's no dens nearby

2388
03:54:24,320 --> 03:54:27,760
Tell me there's no dens around here in the center, which would be perfect for me

2389
03:54:29,360 --> 03:54:31,360
You fucking bitch

2390
03:54:33,760 --> 03:54:35,760
I

2391
03:54:38,880 --> 03:54:43,440
I'm bringing sexy pack. Did you just killed me? Sorry. What is

2392
03:54:45,120 --> 03:54:47,120
Oh, what the hell? I'm sorry

2393
03:54:47,840 --> 03:54:52,400
One two three four. Okay. I thought they were showing five for some reason

2394
03:54:58,560 --> 03:55:00,560
Is there another one no

2395
03:55:02,800 --> 03:55:04,800
Wow

2396
03:55:08,800 --> 03:55:10,800
I'm bringing sexy pack

2397
03:55:12,480 --> 03:55:14,480
Sorry, I'm just so proud of myself for that

2398
03:55:20,800 --> 03:55:23,840
Okay, it looks like I'll be have to be four. Oh dens nearby dens nearby

2399
03:55:25,600 --> 03:55:27,360
Where

2400
03:55:27,360 --> 03:55:30,800
Oh, we want to fucking sorry. You're in the middle of howling. Let's howl together

2401
03:55:31,760 --> 03:55:39,760
Is there pvp in this game? I don't know. I don't remember if you could ever like try to kill other wolves

2402
03:55:47,280 --> 03:55:49,520
This is dead nearby but like where

2403
03:55:52,000 --> 03:55:54,000
It's not changing color

2404
03:55:55,040 --> 03:55:57,040
Oh sit down this way

2405
03:55:57,280 --> 03:56:01,280
Oh seems like it

2406
03:56:13,760 --> 03:56:20,320
I don't see anything saying it's around here facing the south

2407
03:56:27,760 --> 03:56:29,760
I

2408
03:56:32,800 --> 03:56:34,800
Wanted one in the middle

2409
03:56:39,280 --> 03:56:43,600
There's not a lot of cover, but maybe that would make it easier to keep track of the puppies

2410
03:56:45,200 --> 03:56:47,200
Try to think of what's best for my children. Okay

2411
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:52,480
Oh, we're close we're close. We're fucking close. Is that it?

2412
03:56:53,440 --> 03:56:55,440
Is rocket

2413
03:56:57,280 --> 03:56:59,280
Please let this big-ass rock be it

2414
03:57:01,520 --> 03:57:04,640
Yeah, yeah, uh, no

2415
03:57:10,400 --> 03:57:12,400
That's what the fuck bro

2416
03:57:16,560 --> 03:57:19,760
Saying it's like right over here. I don't fucking see anything

2417
03:57:22,480 --> 03:57:24,480
Oh

2418
03:57:28,800 --> 03:57:30,800
My god, I'm literally losing it

2419
03:57:41,520 --> 03:57:44,000
I bet it's next to a fucking tree that I just can't see

2420
03:57:44,000 --> 03:57:46,000
Is

2421
03:57:51,520 --> 03:57:58,320
This is this fucking tree it I don't fucking know is that it what is this

2422
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:04,560
This is a wooded den the trees

2423
03:58:04,640 --> 03:58:09,200
How is more ground cover than open dens giving potatoes like cougars and faces to hide the attacker pups from

2424
03:58:11,040 --> 03:58:13,040
What do you mean what wooded cover

2425
03:58:14,080 --> 03:58:16,080
How

2426
03:58:19,520 --> 03:58:22,000
There's no wooded cover. What are you fucking talking about?

2427
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:27,040
I can oh

2428
03:58:29,120 --> 03:58:33,040
What the hell are we gonna live in a dirt pile

2429
03:58:35,200 --> 03:58:38,320
Whoa, what the fuck

2430
03:58:41,680 --> 03:58:43,680
I don't want this den

2431
03:58:44,080 --> 03:58:46,080
I don't want this den

2432
03:58:48,080 --> 03:58:50,580
I don't want that 10 10 is ugly

2433
03:58:55,920 --> 03:58:57,920
No, I don't want it

2434
03:58:58,560 --> 03:59:03,600
How do I kind of cancel I don't want this fucking dirt pile to be my house

2435
03:59:04,400 --> 03:59:06,400
I don't want the fucking dirt

2436
03:59:07,360 --> 03:59:09,200
Cuck dirt

2437
03:59:09,200 --> 03:59:11,200
Oh, I'll name it cuck dirt

2438
03:59:11,200 --> 03:59:13,200
I

2439
03:59:13,440 --> 03:59:15,440
Won't let me get out of this

2440
03:59:17,600 --> 03:59:20,720
Okay, I love the game last out of safe

2441
03:59:23,360 --> 03:59:27,680
Oh, oh, look at the little baby little fucking cougar bocats whatever they are

2442
03:59:27,680 --> 03:59:41,600
Okay, I don't want that to be my den I think um

2443
03:59:48,320 --> 03:59:54,400
I think I'm gonna look for the I like aesthetics I go to the nearest one

2444
03:59:58,240 --> 04:00:00,240
I

2445
04:00:01,920 --> 04:00:04,560
Let them one down here

2446
04:00:11,760 --> 04:00:14,160
Those coyotes are loud and annoying

2447
04:00:16,880 --> 04:00:18,880
I liked that tree one

2448
04:00:20,720 --> 04:00:25,600
Or the one in the rock was pretty good, but it'll be open for birds

2449
04:00:26,320 --> 04:00:31,440
I I don't think that was a factor the last time I played this game. You had to like worry about things

2450
04:00:32,960 --> 04:00:34,960
Now I have to find

2451
04:00:34,960 --> 04:00:36,960
Rettucar property. Wait, did they?

2452
04:00:37,600 --> 04:00:39,600
Oh, they did

2453
04:00:40,640 --> 04:00:43,680
Oh, it's whatever it's fine. It's not a priority right now. It's not a priority

2454
04:00:44,960 --> 04:00:47,200
What the fuck oh, let's go to the piss right here

2455
04:00:49,360 --> 04:00:51,360
Act so strong

2456
04:00:51,680 --> 04:00:53,680
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna mark it anyways

2457
04:00:55,680 --> 04:00:58,880
Okay, so there's a den right here. Am I fucking tripping?

2458
04:01:00,560 --> 04:01:03,120
Was this one also the one that was in the ground?

2459
04:01:05,120 --> 04:01:07,120
What

2460
04:01:07,920 --> 04:01:09,920
Oh

2461
04:01:10,000 --> 04:01:12,000
This is nice

2462
04:01:15,120 --> 04:01:17,120
So that would be a good one

2463
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:20,720
To open den with little no tree and ground cover

2464
04:01:21,680 --> 04:01:23,680
What

2465
04:01:24,400 --> 04:01:28,960
Why isn't let me know tree and ground cover. It's right near some trees that one's good. That's a good choice

2466
04:01:29,760 --> 04:01:31,760
I don't really believe oh

2467
04:01:32,320 --> 04:01:35,520
Maybe there's more trees that are gonna appear because the other one didn't have trees

2468
04:01:48,560 --> 04:01:52,320
How's the rent and amenities exactly those are important things to consider

2469
04:01:53,680 --> 04:01:55,680
I

2470
04:01:57,280 --> 04:01:59,280
It's gonna pass

2471
04:02:05,440 --> 04:02:09,440
I wish I would like have an icon above showing where they actually were

2472
04:02:13,120 --> 04:02:15,120
Is it over here?

2473
04:02:16,880 --> 04:02:22,960
This one. Yes, it was over here. It was over here. I bet this one's also gonna mention like ground cover shit

2474
04:02:23,680 --> 04:02:25,680
What a den

2475
04:02:29,760 --> 04:02:31,760
It doesn't have any ground cover

2476
04:02:34,080 --> 04:02:39,760
I like this one because it's like it's a cute little place for the pups to play and it's a great view

2477
04:02:39,920 --> 04:02:41,920
You can see the sunrise in the morning

2478
04:02:42,480 --> 04:02:44,480
You know, I'll howl with you baby boob

2479
04:02:45,600 --> 04:02:48,480
There's a washer giant unit. I know that's very important

2480
04:02:49,280 --> 04:02:52,560
Um, so that means the other one's all the way over there

2481
04:02:53,840 --> 04:02:55,840
I

2482
04:02:56,160 --> 04:02:58,160
Okay, let's

2483
04:03:03,920 --> 04:03:05,920
Okay, I have to run

2484
04:03:08,080 --> 04:03:10,080
I'm tired

2485
04:03:11,600 --> 04:03:14,100
I'm probably gonna fucking pass out from exhaustion

2486
04:03:23,760 --> 04:03:26,960
I just want to go to those last one just to see what the coverage is

2487
04:03:27,760 --> 04:03:29,760
Should I deal with a cougar than an eagle?

2488
04:03:30,480 --> 04:03:31,760
I don't know

2489
04:03:31,760 --> 04:03:34,960
Because I feel like like with an eagle I could just like scare it off

2490
04:03:47,840 --> 04:03:50,560
Um, whereas with the cougar I'd probably have to fucking fight it off

2491
04:03:54,640 --> 04:04:01,040
I like this one because it's by the water, you know, very beautiful lake side. I mean riverside

2492
04:04:06,000 --> 04:04:08,000
I bet it's gonna say that's open

2493
04:04:11,040 --> 04:04:13,440
Where is it? Where is it?

2494
04:04:18,880 --> 04:04:20,880
I don't want to go so fast

2495
04:04:24,560 --> 04:04:26,560
What the fuck is it?

2496
04:04:28,560 --> 04:04:30,560
Am I tripping?

2497
04:04:31,440 --> 04:04:33,440
I'm like right on top of it, but I don't see it

2498
04:04:36,800 --> 04:04:38,800
Out here it is

2499
04:04:40,000 --> 04:04:42,000
See this is a fancy fucking looking den

2500
04:04:44,800 --> 04:04:46,800
What it done

2501
04:04:46,800 --> 04:04:51,280
More ground cover. You know what? I'm going with this one because it's cool

2502
04:04:54,080 --> 04:04:58,560
You can go pick up your pumpkin dip. That's true

2503
04:05:00,720 --> 04:05:03,200
Um, what should we call it?

2504
04:05:05,360 --> 04:05:11,920
Snaggle rock, although it's a not that what should we call it? This is a cool ass den

2505
04:05:17,920 --> 04:05:19,920
This music is nice

2506
04:05:24,480 --> 04:05:32,560
Epic not done. No! Nottingham den? There's gonna be children living here. Cool ass den. That's a pretty cool

2507
04:05:33,520 --> 04:05:37,200
But would it be like den den? Like would it add another den at the end?

2508
04:05:41,440 --> 04:05:43,440
Cool ass den

2509
04:05:49,600 --> 04:05:52,720
I can't believe I birthed like that earlier. I'm still it's terrifying me

2510
04:05:53,680 --> 04:05:55,680
I

2511
04:05:57,200 --> 04:05:59,200
Tying the knot I like pup max

2512
04:06:01,760 --> 04:06:03,760
Pup pump max

2513
04:06:06,800 --> 04:06:08,800
The pup maxing den

2514
04:06:10,160 --> 04:06:13,920
Oh, they'll be arriving soon. We're gonna have babies

2515
04:06:15,680 --> 04:06:17,680
It's my birthday. Wow

2516
04:06:17,760 --> 04:06:21,760
Uh, age perks review the available age perks for your next year of life decide if you want to advance in age

2517
04:06:21,760 --> 04:06:23,760
If so select three perks in advance

2518
04:06:24,240 --> 04:06:28,640
Note that only one new years of age works active at the time. They don't come in at your lifetime. Okay

2519
04:06:29,520 --> 04:06:35,120
Probably never been to your birthday too means you've survived another year as a wild wolf. I'm three years old about to have babies

2520
04:06:35,360 --> 04:06:41,120
That's not bad. Sometimes good. Sometimes not review your choices and decide if you want to stay advanced or stay as I am

2521
04:06:41,280 --> 04:06:43,520
So I can just stay as my age. How does that work?

2522
04:06:43,520 --> 04:06:45,520
So

2523
04:06:52,160 --> 04:06:54,160
I can get more stamina

2524
04:06:55,680 --> 04:06:59,760
Be more damage or in tracking paying competitors. I can be a fun parent

2525
04:07:01,520 --> 04:07:03,520
Pups never get tired of socializing

2526
04:07:05,120 --> 04:07:10,480
More likely to have a large litter of pups sick pups are more likely to the competitor. What the fuck? I want that

2527
04:07:10,480 --> 04:07:15,680
It's called clout. I want some clout. I want out. I want clout

2528
04:07:16,960 --> 04:07:18,960
So I can pick three

2529
04:07:20,640 --> 04:07:23,120
I don't really care about that. Um, I'll do these

2530
04:07:25,040 --> 04:07:27,040
What can I

2531
04:07:27,280 --> 04:07:29,280
Stay my age

2532
04:07:30,240 --> 04:07:32,240
I gotta advance age three

2533
04:07:32,640 --> 04:07:36,640
Advance vigil these new perks for the coming year. You cannot go back to your younger self. Yeah, that's fine

2534
04:07:37,600 --> 04:07:39,600
Oh

2535
04:07:42,640 --> 04:07:44,640
After nine weeks of gestation

2536
04:07:45,360 --> 04:07:48,800
They look just like me. If your pups are born and dead blind and deaf

2537
04:07:48,800 --> 04:07:52,960
They weigh one pound each your pups may remain in the den for several weeks eating sleeping pepper. We do it out

2538
04:07:54,080 --> 04:07:58,880
Three weeks. They first emerged in the den in the sunlight. They're dark brown now a few weeks of puppy coats will end up

2539
04:07:58,880 --> 04:08:04,800
Oh, okay. Why should we name though? I have babies. Look how cute my babies are

2540
04:08:05,760 --> 04:08:07,920
Blimey stop trying to chew my fucking headphones

2541
04:08:09,440 --> 04:08:11,360
You're ruining the moment

2542
04:08:11,360 --> 04:08:15,120
Wait, I could just name them after my hold on. I'm naming them after my cats

2543
04:08:18,320 --> 04:08:20,320
Oh my god, there's really two girls and a boy

2544
04:08:22,000 --> 04:08:24,000
Bro

2545
04:08:25,760 --> 04:08:27,760
I'm gonna cry

2546
04:08:28,480 --> 04:08:30,480
Oh

2547
04:08:32,240 --> 04:08:34,240
Shapa shabu shabu shubu

2548
04:08:34,800 --> 04:08:40,400
It's literally two girls and a boy. Oh, it's boomy rain and fia. Oh wait, but if my pets die

2549
04:08:40,480 --> 04:08:46,800
I'm gonna be very upset if if I have to keep these puppies alive at all fucking costs guys

2550
04:08:49,280 --> 04:08:56,320
We're going to do it I can tell them to come with me to come here go home. Oh, okay

2551
04:08:58,720 --> 04:09:04,000
Now four weeks old your pups are too big for the den as they spend their days playing outdoors socializing them playful emotes

2552
04:09:04,640 --> 04:09:08,720
Get my pack if they're playful if they're hungry feed them straight for them go find them and carry them back

2553
04:09:09,280 --> 04:09:11,840
Pups mostly eat me regurgitated by you and your mate

2554
04:09:13,120 --> 04:09:14,960
What I'm about to

2555
04:09:14,960 --> 04:09:18,000
Baby bird this shit into your mouth. You must protect them from predators

2556
04:09:18,000 --> 04:09:21,920
You may see a wolf pup is an easy target keeping your pups until they weigh 15 pounds

2557
04:09:23,600 --> 04:09:25,600
Cool

2558
04:09:25,600 --> 04:09:27,600
Especially as they're both your pups

2559
04:09:27,760 --> 04:09:30,080
Go find food eat it and then regurgitate it

2560
04:09:31,440 --> 04:09:35,920
And you go hunting wolf to tell your pups to stay in the den usually stay there like on but affinity is low

2561
04:09:35,920 --> 04:09:38,240
Like to come out before you're turned. Oh, okay

2562
04:09:40,240 --> 04:09:43,600
Oh god, and I still have to maintain the fucking hiss the thing

2563
04:09:44,640 --> 04:09:48,080
Your fee is oh, oh my god, little fia

2564
04:09:51,440 --> 04:09:53,440
Hi fia

2565
04:09:54,320 --> 04:09:57,440
Oh my god, it's my baby

2566
04:10:02,240 --> 04:10:04,960
Sorry, I didn't mean to bump you. Oh my god, look at reina

Wait, do they all blue eyes?

2574
04:10:33,440 --> 04:10:36,400

2586
04:11:39,520 --> 04:11:41,520
Oh

2587
04:11:47,200 --> 04:11:51,600
We're having a great time. Look at my babies. Where did my husband go?

2588
04:11:54,640 --> 04:11:58,320
Did he go did he go get food or

2589
04:12:01,120 --> 04:12:03,120
All right

2590
04:12:03,680 --> 04:12:06,800
Wait, can I go in the den because you couldn't do that before

2591
04:12:07,760 --> 04:12:09,760
Can you go in there?

2592
04:12:15,920 --> 04:12:17,920

04:12:22,640 --> 04:12:28,720

2594
04:12:30,960 --> 04:12:33,680
You know pups are in the way. Yeah. Yeah, okay

2595
04:12:34,320 --> 04:12:35,600

2596
04:12:35,600 --> 04:12:38,640
You guys are good. So have you guys go in there?

2597
04:12:39,760 --> 04:12:41,760
I wish there was a puppy one

2598
04:12:42,400 --> 04:12:44,400
voice

2599
04:12:45,680 --> 04:12:48,800
Do I tell the pups to go in

2600
04:12:51,280 --> 04:12:53,280
Go home

2601
04:12:56,000 --> 04:12:58,000
Go in the den

2602
04:13:00,240 --> 04:13:02,240
Get in the freaking den

2603
04:13:05,600 --> 04:13:07,920
Ruff get in there

2604
04:13:09,600 --> 04:13:11,600
Your bats get in there

2605
04:13:12,000 --> 04:13:14,000
Mama needs to go piss everywhere

2606
04:13:14,560 --> 04:13:17,360
Your world looks like a Tibetan sand fox. Oh, yeah, you're right

2607
04:13:20,160 --> 04:13:22,160
Goofy

2608
04:13:26,320 --> 04:13:28,880
Um, I don't know what the circle in the hex means

2609
04:13:31,360 --> 04:13:35,440
Uh, I'm actually pretty good. I guess I could go preemptively

2610
04:13:36,400 --> 04:13:40,480
Do stuff where where'd hubby go? Oh

2611
04:13:41,280 --> 04:13:43,280
um, I'm gonna talk to you

2612
04:13:44,400 --> 04:13:46,400
And tell you to stay

2613
04:13:54,320 --> 04:13:56,320
Okay, he doesn't seem that bothered by it so

2614
04:13:58,720 --> 04:14:00,480
Did you

2615
04:14:00,480 --> 04:14:02,640
Did you go throw up over there? Why is there?

2616
04:14:03,600 --> 04:14:07,280
We're gurgitated meat all the way over there. All right. Well

2617
04:14:10,560 --> 04:14:12,880
All right, I gotta go on a piss adventure

2618
04:14:17,680 --> 04:14:21,120
I'm gonna go renew that one all the way over there and pee on the way

2619
04:14:22,160 --> 04:14:25,120
I gotta go make sure that the territory is good. Is he coming with me?

2620
04:14:26,880 --> 04:14:30,480
Okay, he's not good. I just wanted to make sure someone's home with the puppies

2621
04:14:31,040 --> 04:14:35,040
We are the piss adventurers

2622
04:14:38,240 --> 04:14:43,920
Toggle my neat meets name tag, okay, I could see the binautical he is at home

2623
04:14:48,400 --> 04:14:50,400
Pissing time

2624
04:14:54,000 --> 04:14:56,000
My pups will survive

2625
04:14:57,760 --> 04:15:00,160
I'm gonna go steal some territory

2626
04:15:01,280 --> 04:15:03,280
Uh

2627
04:15:05,280 --> 04:15:09,280
I feel like I could actually steal the sum till our side

2628
04:15:10,960 --> 04:15:14,160
In a perfect world, I would have the corner

2629
04:15:15,360 --> 04:15:17,840
But me thinks that will not happen

2630
04:15:18,720 --> 04:15:20,720
Then nearby

2631
04:15:22,000 --> 04:15:24,000
Is the same one as before

2632
04:15:27,040 --> 04:15:29,040
Can I move them to another den

2633
04:15:29,760 --> 04:15:31,760
I feel like it. Can I just like do that?

2634
04:15:35,760 --> 04:15:41,520
Are these the same dens as before or is this one up here? What the hell? Yeah, it's okay

2635
04:15:47,200 --> 04:15:55,280
It's my tag. Wow. Are you an agamist wolf today? Yeah, I'm just I'm just by myself. I'm hanging out

2636
04:15:59,440 --> 04:16:01,440
You

2637
04:16:05,520 --> 04:16:10,000
What the fuck I thought that was like smoke coming out of the ground for some reason

2638
04:16:13,360 --> 04:16:15,360
This

2639
04:16:17,600 --> 04:16:21,600
It's renewing on the way, you know, you know how we do we just renew

2640
04:16:24,080 --> 04:16:26,080
Going to fuck up the Lamar pack

2641
04:16:29,120 --> 04:16:32,320
I don't even know what I'm supposed to fucking do though because like

2642
04:16:37,520 --> 04:16:41,040
Like how long is it take for them to grow up? Oh shit. Am I the wrong way?

2643
04:16:43,200 --> 04:16:45,200
Oh god, here we go

2644
04:16:47,520 --> 04:16:49,520
Jump

2645
04:16:50,080 --> 04:16:54,720
I don't have a bubble. It's fine. Look at my little tail. Wee. It's propelling me forward

2646
04:16:56,320 --> 04:16:58,320
Let me get the hair

2647
04:16:59,840 --> 04:17:04,880
Oh, oh my god, I'm too fast. I need to back up

2648
04:17:09,280 --> 04:17:11,280
Yes time

2649
04:17:12,800 --> 04:17:16,160
I bet the game would also look a lot different because I'm like, oh, there's no tree cover

2650
04:17:16,160 --> 04:17:18,800
But I bet when it's on max graphics. It actually looks okay

2651
04:17:21,280 --> 04:17:24,640
How's everyone doing chat just wolfing around we're wolfing out tonight

2652
04:17:30,000 --> 04:17:33,840
I know might be boring because I'm playing wolf running simulator, but I'm actually enjoying myself

2653
04:17:35,600 --> 04:17:38,960
I'm so like focused. I'm just like, yeah, this is some good stuff

2654
04:17:41,600 --> 04:17:43,600
Collectible object

2655
04:17:44,160 --> 04:17:46,160
What

2656
04:17:46,800 --> 04:17:48,800
Like it

2657
04:17:49,360 --> 04:17:51,360
I can't pick it up

2658
04:17:53,280 --> 04:17:57,360
Why do I have a fucking oil lamp I don't need this shit

2659
04:17:59,920 --> 04:18:01,920
Leave that there

2660
04:18:05,520 --> 04:18:07,520
What am I gonna do with that

2661
04:18:07,600 --> 04:18:11,280
Making pens cursing the day someone thought it'd be funny to get a nail on a tree

2662
04:18:13,120 --> 04:18:14,800
Oh

2663
04:18:14,800 --> 04:18:18,720
What do you what I don't know what did you do for work? So that would be a thing

2664
04:18:18,720 --> 04:18:20,720
I

2665
04:18:24,400 --> 04:18:26,720
Depth of the game with territories and stuff is nuts. I know

2666
04:18:27,920 --> 04:18:29,920
Yeah, if you fall asleep, that's fine

2667
04:18:30,640 --> 04:18:32,640
It's fall asleep to me happen

2668
04:18:34,000 --> 04:18:36,000
My butt is going numb though

2669
04:18:36,400 --> 04:18:50,320
Cool means that's all walk through I'm gonna snag these hexes on over here by the red Lamar pack

2670
04:18:53,760 --> 04:18:59,360
Okay, it seems like they don't fade as much when you finally make your den

2671
04:19:02,320 --> 04:19:04,320
Like you can kind of

2672
04:19:04,720 --> 04:19:06,720
Keep it cool

2673
04:19:09,280 --> 04:19:13,200
Period, yep, I'm stealing this shit, bro. I'm stealing it

2674
04:19:16,080 --> 04:19:17,760
It's a hobby for what oh

2675
04:19:17,760 --> 04:19:20,640
Yes, I remember I was like watching a bunch of tiktoks of that before

2676
04:19:21,360 --> 04:19:24,720
And I just wanted to learn how to do it. So I went to this local like woodworking shop

2677
04:19:24,720 --> 04:19:27,840
I'm like, hey, you guys do this and they're like no and I'm like, oh, okay

2678
04:19:29,200 --> 04:19:31,680
That's too bad. I'm gonna piss one more time

2679
04:19:32,640 --> 04:19:35,600
Okay, I don't know why I thought I needed to piss again

2680
04:19:38,160 --> 04:19:44,400
I wonder if you two bull demonetizes because I'm just like the ai is this gonna be talking about piss the entire time

2681
04:19:52,480 --> 04:19:54,640
Perfect perfect rock to piss on

2682
04:19:54,640 --> 04:20:05,840
No, I didn't do anything. All right, I guess I just gotta run around in here some more then I'll take it over

2683
04:20:10,400 --> 04:20:14,400
Although what I really should be doing I really should be focusing on the ones in the corner

2684
04:20:14,400 --> 04:20:17,440
So I might go and do that check on the pops and go do the ones in the corner

2685
04:20:18,160 --> 04:20:21,040
Grab some food on the way. You know, you know what I'm saying

2686
04:20:25,360 --> 04:20:35,520
Yeah, I'll just I'm so tempted to snag these two though. They're just like they're just there for the taking

2687
04:20:35,520 --> 04:20:39,120
Look at those fucking rocks. Can I kill this bird? No

2688
04:20:41,680 --> 04:20:43,680
Hope my puppies are okay

2689
04:20:47,120 --> 04:20:49,120
Oh, nope. I'm back in my territory

2690
04:20:55,120 --> 04:20:58,320
There we go

2691
04:21:00,000 --> 04:21:03,600
I'm getting the let's go back. I won't worry about that random

2692
04:21:04,480 --> 04:21:07,040
Although but the purples are gonna probably take it

2693
04:21:08,000 --> 04:21:10,000
It's mine

2694
04:21:12,560 --> 04:21:15,760
Because it's cut off from their territory, so it doesn't even fucking matter

2695
04:21:16,480 --> 04:21:19,840
because it's so they sandwiched in between me and

2696
04:21:20,800 --> 04:21:22,320
Yeah

2697
04:21:22,320 --> 04:21:25,680
We're doing strats get some macaques for the pups

2698
04:21:27,760 --> 04:21:29,760
Get some maracas

2699
04:21:30,400 --> 04:21:32,400
I'm gonna go towards the wolf so

2700
04:21:42,880 --> 04:21:47,760
Where Jesus I have to go all the way this fucking hill it's gonna take me forever to get back up

2701
04:21:53,200 --> 04:22:01,280
Yeah, I know the fucking purple wolves are like give us this shit. We want this area. Oh perfect. Okay

2702
04:22:05,200 --> 04:22:07,200
What the hell

2703
04:22:10,400 --> 04:22:14,960
I'm I'm peeing out of my back. I'm a very talented bunny

2704
04:22:16,480 --> 04:22:20,000
You can do many things. What the fuck this should be like a dense site. Are you kidding me?

2705
04:22:20,960 --> 04:22:22,960
Oh, whoa, I'm gonna pee up here

2706
04:22:24,880 --> 04:22:26,560
This is pretty

2707
04:22:26,560 --> 04:22:30,640
Look at this. You told me this isn't a dense site. It'd be a shitty dense site

2708
04:22:30,720 --> 04:22:34,800
But there's a tree growing on this rock. I almost got stuck in it. That would have been bad

2709
04:22:38,400 --> 04:22:44,400
I am pissing everywhere pissing everywhere. I'm pissing everywhere. No one can stop me

2710
04:22:45,920 --> 04:22:47,920
Pissing out my back

2711
04:22:48,880 --> 04:22:50,880
I'm sliding down this rock

2712
04:22:55,040 --> 04:22:57,760
What says there's a den nearby this is weird

2713
04:23:00,080 --> 04:23:02,080
I don't want to keep going this way

2714
04:23:04,640 --> 04:23:06,640
I'm gonna pee next to this tree

2715
04:23:07,280 --> 04:23:09,920
Lion king odd den it really is though

2716
04:23:10,880 --> 04:23:12,880
Really was a lion king odd den

2717
04:23:13,520 --> 04:23:15,360
I can't climb up there

2718
04:23:15,440 --> 04:23:18,000
I don't know what else I have to fucking do to take over this hex

2719
04:23:30,160 --> 04:23:32,800
There we go finally that took a long time

2720
04:23:36,400 --> 04:23:38,400
Too soon

2721
04:23:38,400 --> 04:23:40,720
Fuck you. All right, let's go check on the babies

2722
04:23:41,440 --> 04:23:44,320
See how the the kittens are doing. I mean the puppies

2723
04:23:46,320 --> 04:23:48,320
Oh, maybe it's just showing me mine

2724
04:23:49,680 --> 04:23:52,180
Yeah, my den is down here. Wee

2725
04:23:53,840 --> 04:23:56,480
I wonder if I follow this river. It'll probably leave me right to it

2726
04:23:58,560 --> 04:24:00,560
What the fuck is happening here?

2727
04:24:02,400 --> 04:24:04,400
Yeah, okay

2728
04:24:05,280 --> 04:24:07,280
I haven't run into any like wildlife

2729
04:24:07,280 --> 04:24:09,280
I

2730
04:24:13,440 --> 04:24:18,080
Wish I could run in pee faster. I accidentally keep moving

2731
04:24:19,680 --> 04:24:21,680
There we go

2732
04:24:22,320 --> 04:24:25,120
Pretty sure if I run down this. Oh, can I drink?

2733
04:24:28,720 --> 04:24:30,720
Yeah, drinking doesn't really do anything

2734
04:24:30,880 --> 04:24:37,200
I don't need to drink water I'm a wolf. What the fuck, okay

2735
04:24:44,000 --> 04:24:50,480
I literally bet if I follow this river it will take me straight back to the thing. No, it won't what the fuck

2736
04:24:54,720 --> 04:24:56,720
Okay, I should probably grab food on the way

2737
04:24:57,520 --> 04:25:02,080
Mom, can you give McDonald's McDonald's a hoe?

2738
04:25:04,000 --> 04:25:06,480
It's just like a kids cuisine

2739
04:25:14,800 --> 04:25:16,800
Everything the piss touches is yours

2740
04:25:16,800 --> 04:25:18,800
I

2741
04:25:21,840 --> 04:25:26,480
Also how oh perfect what's that over there? Hope they didn't hear me

2742
04:25:28,480 --> 04:25:33,920
It's gonna be a bitch to chase them though. I need to chase them in the direction of my stuff

2743
04:25:35,920 --> 04:25:39,680
Slide down this hill with my tail propelling me

2744
04:25:47,760 --> 04:25:49,760
Oh

2745
04:25:51,360 --> 04:25:53,360
No, I'm chasing them in the red territory

2746
04:25:54,240 --> 04:25:58,400
I meant to chase them in a different territory if I circle them to go this way

2747
04:25:59,680 --> 04:26:01,680
Heard them heard them go

2748
04:26:04,160 --> 04:26:06,160
Can I please bite one of you?

2749
04:26:12,000 --> 04:26:13,280
Like

2750
04:26:13,280 --> 04:26:16,560
It's annoying because it locks me on one and I'm like I try to unlock

2751
04:26:20,080 --> 04:26:22,080
I'll just piss one at it

2752
04:26:26,800 --> 04:26:28,800
Let's see

2753
04:26:28,800 --> 04:26:32,240
Perfect like run them into my story. I'm trying to direct them

2754
04:26:33,440 --> 04:26:35,440
towards the

2755
04:26:35,520 --> 04:26:37,520
Den

2756
04:26:43,600 --> 04:26:46,240
I can like kind of drive them closer

2757
04:26:50,960 --> 04:26:58,960
All right, I'm pressing a different button as if I'm locking on just like in elden ring or lice p

2758
04:27:06,560 --> 04:27:09,040
See all right, I'm supposed to in the middle. That's fine

2759
04:27:13,280 --> 04:27:15,280
I

2760
04:27:32,240 --> 04:27:38,000
Run no, I'm going the wrong direction now. Oh, whatever

2761
04:27:43,920 --> 04:27:45,920
I

2762
04:27:51,360 --> 04:27:56,080
Wolf souls man, that'd be so fucking sick if you could just be a wolf with a sword walking around

2763
04:28:00,480 --> 04:28:02,480
Sorry, I'm cutting my little howl off

2764
04:28:06,720 --> 04:28:08,960
Gumi what are you doing you play with your toy?

2765
04:28:13,440 --> 04:28:15,440
I

2766
04:28:20,880 --> 04:28:23,840
What's up boomi, I don't know if you guys can hear him. He's like

2767
04:28:27,760 --> 04:28:29,760
I'm peeing out of the wrong leg, but it's fine

2768
04:28:31,440 --> 04:28:33,440
Play

2769
04:28:34,240 --> 04:28:36,240
That's a good point

2770
04:28:37,200 --> 04:28:39,200
Oh

2771
04:28:43,040 --> 04:28:46,640
Is that a hair I couldn't see it. It's probably hair

2772
04:28:46,640 --> 04:28:48,640
I

2773
04:29:03,680 --> 04:29:05,680
Think a little bites easier

2774
04:29:07,120 --> 04:29:09,360
Should play a for what is that about like apes?

2775
04:29:11,360 --> 04:29:13,360
Let me guess it's about apes

2776
04:29:17,200 --> 04:29:20,720
Play the human not good with material especially if you know his purpose

2777
04:29:24,800 --> 04:29:29,920
I kind of like I I like I like reading a lot of the lore for elden ring and

2778
04:29:30,720 --> 04:29:32,000
to be honest

2779
04:29:32,000 --> 04:29:34,000
Blades path was one of the most

2780
04:29:34,000 --> 04:29:39,120
Or blithe I keep pronouncing his name not the correct way. Blithe's path was the most interesting to me

2781
04:29:39,680 --> 04:29:41,680
Just like struggle

2782
04:29:42,320 --> 04:29:43,520
I wish I followed it

2783
04:29:43,520 --> 04:29:47,680
But I was because I like I initially went was going for the Ronnie ending, but then I

2784
04:29:48,320 --> 04:29:50,720
Didn't stick with it. Do I have any like food around here?

2785
04:29:52,960 --> 04:29:55,280
It's bison I can't take down a fucking bison

2786
04:30:02,160 --> 04:30:04,640
Well came back empty-handed

2787
04:30:06,320 --> 04:30:09,440
I did have a bite, but I also need to sleep

2788
04:30:10,400 --> 04:30:12,400
So we're going back to the den

2789
04:30:20,880 --> 04:30:23,680
Kind of tragic doesn't want to lose me the way it was. Yeah

2790
04:30:25,920 --> 04:30:27,920
Den nearby is it my own?

2791
04:30:29,760 --> 04:30:31,760
Is it my own den that's nearby?

2792
04:30:40,400 --> 04:30:42,400
Oh

2793
04:30:46,400 --> 04:30:48,400
Wait

2794
04:30:50,320 --> 04:30:52,320
I didn't see them there

2795
04:30:52,480 --> 04:30:54,480
I

2796
04:31:20,080 --> 04:31:22,080
Like how they hop

2797
04:31:22,640 --> 04:31:24,640
Come on

2798
04:31:30,560 --> 04:31:32,560
I'm so close to your ass

2799
04:31:35,680 --> 04:31:42,960
I must ran into a tree I got tired some exhausted. All right. Let's just head back

2800
04:31:42,960 --> 04:31:52,560
Where's my family?

2801
04:32:05,840 --> 04:32:11,040
Oh perfect, I'm happy I can see them because that makes it a lot easier for me

2802
04:32:13,920 --> 04:32:17,600
She's sick to part two two for the wool quest stream. I don't know

2803
04:32:18,800 --> 04:32:22,000
Maybe I don't know if you guys like women watch you play this

2804
04:32:23,200 --> 04:32:25,200
I'm so tired. I can't run

2805
04:32:27,600 --> 04:32:31,600
Hi, is it time to sleep? Oh fia. What are you doing out here?

2806
04:32:31,920 --> 04:32:35,760
This is definitely a fia thing to do. Although it is also a boomy thing to do

2807
04:32:35,760 --> 04:32:37,760
I'm gonna pee right next to the den

2808
04:32:37,760 --> 04:32:39,760
I

2809
04:32:41,280 --> 04:32:43,280
What are you doing lady

2810
04:32:45,600 --> 04:32:48,000
She's just hanging out because

2811
04:32:51,360 --> 04:32:57,200
Okay, like I don't know how to like play with them. Do I just like play about

2812
04:32:59,360 --> 04:33:03,920
Are she acting like she's dead? Is that how she sleeps? It's funny because that's how fia sleeps though

2813
04:33:08,240 --> 04:33:10,240
No food

2814
04:33:13,600 --> 04:33:22,400
Ma'am, can you wake up? I didn't mean to throw up but okay. I'm trying to pick her up

2815
04:33:26,400 --> 04:33:28,400

2818
04:33:54,000 --> 04:33:56,640
Why am I dreaming of a fucking fire Jesus

2819
04:33:59,360 --> 04:34:04,080
I would watch you paint dry. I would watch you watch paint dry

2820
04:34:06,080 --> 04:34:09,120
If you don't watch she's serving so it came from your sir

2821
04:34:10,800 --> 04:34:13,440
Why do I only have one pup in here? Where are my other puppies?

2822
04:34:15,840 --> 04:34:17,840
Oh, it's pretty outside

2823

04:34:36,960 --> 04:34:38,960
I think it's time we expand to the corner

2827
04:34:42,400 --> 04:34:44,400

04:36:59,360 --> 04:37:01,360
I don't really know if that's what I'm supposed to do

2851
04:37:05,200 --> 04:37:07,440
Keeping an eye on Raina so fucking nothing takes her

2852
04:37:10,640 --> 04:37:12,960
He's digging that's that's a boomy thing

This is some good family bonding time

2862
04:38:08,000 --> 04:38:14,960
What else do I have in my snack box? There's a lot of like sweet stuff in here. I kind of want something more savory

2863
04:38:18,800 --> 04:38:20,800
I

2864
04:38:22,960 --> 04:38:24,960
That's a coffee bar

2865
04:38:26,480 --> 04:38:28,880
What is this blueberry?

2866
04:38:31,440 --> 04:38:37,600
I can't wishing that there's a lot of like french inspired korean stuff in here

2867
04:38:41,520 --> 04:38:46,080
I guess they really like the french aesthetic like should be having this with tea

2868
04:38:46,080 --> 04:38:50,800
Oh chewy chocolate chip cookie

2869
04:39:02,240 --> 04:39:05,600

Wait a second

2873
04:39:25,600 --> 04:39:27,600
Hmm

2874
04:39:29,920 --> 04:39:33,520
Boomy's a big boy if you're a small girl everything is a little bit smaller

2875
04:39:36,960 --> 04:39:38,960
Fleece mild

2876
04:39:45,520 --> 04:39:47,520
Like fullness

2877
04:40:00,640 --> 04:40:05,360
Why is my nautical non the den he's going to go get food. Oh my god, look at them

2878
04:40:09,520 --> 04:40:11,520
Did you bring back food for them

2879
04:40:15,200 --> 04:40:17,200
You

2880
04:40:22,720 --> 04:40:24,720
Can you go get our son?

2881
04:40:33,120 --> 04:40:35,120
I guess all the way over there

2882
04:40:36,720 --> 04:40:39,360
What the children where are you going?

2883
04:40:41,920 --> 04:40:43,920

2884
04:40:45,520 --> 04:40:47,520

2885
04:40:52,720 --> 04:40:59,440
Oh, all right guys, um my nautical can you can you keep an eye on them?

2886
04:41:04,400 --> 04:41:09,360
You're so cute though, it's so funny how much they have the personalities of my actual fucking cats. Oh

2887
04:41:10,720 --> 04:41:12,720
Oh

2888
04:41:12,960 --> 04:41:14,960
Adorable

2889
04:41:15,360 --> 04:41:17,360
That's our territory. Oh, it's okay

2890
04:41:18,800 --> 04:41:20,800
Can't tell if we lost anything

2891
04:41:27,040 --> 04:41:29,040
I don't raina seems like she's doing good

2892
04:41:31,920 --> 04:41:34,720
Raina oh my god

2893
04:41:35,920 --> 04:41:39,520
It's funny because raina sometimes does this thing where I'll be like give me belly

2894
04:41:39,600 --> 04:41:45,920
And she'll roll over into her belly and she lets me pet her belly. This is adorable. I'm having the best time of my life right now

2895
04:41:47,440 --> 04:41:49,440
Live vicariously

2896
04:41:49,440 --> 04:41:52,720
Come here though. I'm gonna bring you closer to the den

2897
04:41:56,720 --> 04:42:00,240
Where's boomie go get boomie. He's just like all the way over there

04:42:04,560 --> 04:42:06,560
Well, this is great

2899
04:42:07,280 --> 04:42:13,040

Puppy should be fine, I hope please don't wander off and get eaten by stuff

2909
04:43:28,480 --> 04:43:30,480
I

2910
04:43:33,440 --> 04:43:36,000
Need to find smells

2911
04:43:42,720 --> 04:43:44,960
The binautical mule deer

All right, we're going up I want to go down

2913

A lot of stuff is coming up from here anyways. Oh, are they just here? No two hours ago

2914
04:44:08,480 --> 04:44:10,480
Oh

2915
04:44:24,880 --> 04:44:28,160
Oh my god, I'm still going. How do I just like randomly go the wrong way?

2916
04:44:30,560 --> 04:44:32,560
I don't understand it

2917
04:44:33,040 --> 04:44:40,960
Okay, let's take this shit over boy. There it is

2918
04:44:47,920 --> 04:44:50,480
I'm gonna get some food on the way. How perfect is that?

2919
04:45:02,720 --> 04:45:07,920
Yeah, I'm gonna try to run into the rock. I need a pause. Yeah, because it's right here

2920
04:45:22,800 --> 04:45:24,480
Not doing anything

2921
04:45:24,480 --> 04:45:27,280
Street lights are on get a little ass to the tent

2922
04:45:28,320 --> 04:45:30,320
I think you came to see this for the super

2923
04:45:32,880 --> 04:45:36,560
I'm sorry. It's a fucking piss here

2924
04:45:41,120 --> 04:45:44,800
All right, well still got to find food because hungry as fuck

2925
04:45:48,160 --> 04:45:50,160
Over there, okay

2926
04:45:56,320 --> 04:45:58,320
See we can cut them off

2927
04:46:02,640 --> 04:46:04,640
Oh

2928
04:46:08,800 --> 04:46:10,800
Where they go

2929
04:46:14,320 --> 04:46:20,240
No, that's hair where the fuck did I but I accidentally run them off for my stupid

2930
04:46:22,480 --> 04:46:25,120
Well, it's like coyote. I really don't care about that

2931
04:46:27,040 --> 04:46:29,040
Well, the fuck that those deer just go

2932
04:46:30,000 --> 04:46:34,640
Did I lose them amongst the tree trunks? Because I am apt to do that

2933
04:46:42,160 --> 04:46:44,160
Oh

2934
04:46:50,320 --> 04:46:52,320
What the heck? The scent just disappeared

2935
04:46:52,800 --> 04:46:54,800
Oh

2936
04:46:57,680 --> 04:47:02,480
The hell where the fuck it was just said 15 minutes ago, then it fucking disappeared. Are you serious?

2937
04:47:05,440 --> 04:47:07,440
Bruh

2938
04:47:08,640 --> 04:47:10,640
I'm getting tired of hunting for food

2939
04:47:11,600 --> 04:47:16,000
25 minutes ago am I going the opposite direction? Nope. Yep. It looks like they meant to go this way

2940
04:47:17,440 --> 04:47:19,440
I didn't get super smell where you could do that

2941
04:47:23,120 --> 04:47:30,080
Okay, so they were right over here

2942
04:47:36,560 --> 04:47:38,960
Yeah, we're gonna hunt another pack fucking territory

2943
04:47:40,560 --> 04:47:42,560
The fuck

2944
04:47:44,240 --> 04:47:47,200
I'm losing the dough to the pronghorn

2945
04:47:47,920 --> 04:47:52,480
Oh my god, please. I'm just I just want to eat

2946
04:47:55,600 --> 04:47:57,600
Oh perfect

2947
04:48:00,800 --> 04:48:02,800
No, get the one closer

2948
04:48:08,640 --> 04:48:10,640
Come on

2949
04:48:18,080 --> 04:48:22,160
Bring her down bring her down super smell also includes bad smells. That's a good point

2950
04:48:24,560 --> 04:48:29,200
But like I always wondered like why a dog doesn't recognize like bad smells or like

2951
04:48:30,160 --> 04:48:35,600
Because like cats will react to bad smells, but I've never seen like dogs really react to bad smells. I don't know

2952
04:48:36,320 --> 04:48:38,320
Actually, no, they probably like huff

2953
04:48:47,520 --> 04:48:53,680
Like I'll just sink it to the ground. Okay. Oh, I think we're good

2954
04:49:05,440 --> 04:49:07,440
I want that fucking thing though

2955
04:49:17,920 --> 04:49:19,920
I

2956
04:49:28,240 --> 04:49:33,600
Want to change I feel like we have to like run across it

2957
04:49:40,000 --> 04:49:42,960
I'm really pissed in this area so many fucking times

2958
04:49:48,000 --> 04:49:50,000
Finally

2959
04:49:51,520 --> 04:49:53,520
It's way too long

2960
04:50:04,400 --> 04:50:08,240
And if we get any food on the way then we'll grab some

2961
04:50:09,040 --> 04:50:11,040
Um

2962
04:50:14,000 --> 04:50:20,080
My commentary is leaving me I'm like losing the yappage because I'm just so focused and enjoying myself

2963
04:50:30,960 --> 04:50:34,480
Everything is different smells that are bad bad usually means danger to animals. That's a good point

2964
04:50:38,400 --> 04:50:40,400
I

2965
04:50:45,920 --> 04:50:48,240
Live in my work wolf girl dreams right now

2966
04:50:50,320 --> 04:50:55,280
Wait name tags are on I wonder where the where are the baby so I can't I say them

2967
04:50:58,160 --> 04:51:00,800
As long as we're having a good time she be she's immersed because

2968
04:51:02,800 --> 04:51:04,560
I remember

2969
04:51:04,560 --> 04:51:05,920
on time

2970
04:51:05,920 --> 04:51:07,920
I was talking to

2971
04:51:08,240 --> 04:51:13,120
My dad was like, how do you want your steak and I said like rare because I like rare steak or like medium

2972
04:51:13,920 --> 04:51:15,920
um

2973
04:51:16,400 --> 04:51:18,400
And

2974
04:51:19,200 --> 04:51:23,840
It was like a lot pinker like he accidentally didn't let he like not like undercooked it

2975
04:51:23,920 --> 04:51:28,320
But just like it was rarer than I thought it was going to be or the fuck is it in

2976
04:51:30,800 --> 04:51:33,920
Where's that dad bro

2977
04:51:33,920 --> 04:51:37,600
I just want to get to my puppies

2978
04:51:43,920 --> 04:51:45,920
Can't am I blind?

2979
04:51:54,320 --> 04:51:56,320
Is it up here?

2980
04:51:59,280 --> 04:52:01,280
Oh my god, um

2981
04:52:01,680 --> 04:52:09,280
And it like was really pink and oh they came out. Oh look at them. Oh you hungry eat some food

2982
04:52:10,560 --> 04:52:12,560
I didn't mean to pick you up

2983
04:52:13,520 --> 04:52:15,520
Oh my god

2984
04:52:20,320 --> 04:52:21,520
Enjoy

2985
04:52:21,520 --> 04:52:27,200
And it was I can't get it even I'm so focused on the game and sleepy that I didn't even really might even telling the story

2986
04:52:27,760 --> 04:52:31,440
And it was a little bit red that was like bloody and I was just like

2987
04:52:33,360 --> 04:52:35,360
Oh rena sharing

2988
04:52:36,080 --> 04:52:38,080
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to pick you up

2989
04:52:39,040 --> 04:52:41,040
Come on

2990
04:52:45,120 --> 04:52:47,680
And I'm like I gotta do this one thing

2991
04:52:49,440 --> 04:52:50,560
And um

2992
04:52:50,560 --> 04:52:56,080
My dad's like, oh you should be fine because I was just like I think it's too bloody like it looks like there's a blood clot in it

2993
04:52:56,080 --> 04:53:00,400
He's like it doesn't matter, you know, because you're a wolf and I'm like what he's like

2994
04:53:00,480 --> 04:53:04,320
Yeah, because like don't you like being a wolf and stuff. I'm like dad

2995
04:53:09,040 --> 04:53:13,840
If Adam is happy being a wolf that ought to be and it's funny because when my parents like when I first started

2996
04:53:13,840 --> 04:53:18,800
To V2 my parents are like, why didn't you pick a wolf? I'm like because everybody's a fucking wolf and then I picked a cat

2997
04:53:19,600 --> 04:53:23,200
And then everybody's a fucking cat. So I don't know what the fuck I was talking about and now I'm a bunny

2998
04:53:23,200 --> 04:53:25,200
And now everybody's a bunny

2999
04:53:26,640 --> 04:53:28,640
Oh

3000
04:53:30,160 --> 04:53:33,600
I'm like 2.0. Should I just like change my animal 3.0

3001
04:53:37,040 --> 04:53:39,040
Dad knows what it up

3002
04:53:39,920 --> 04:53:41,920
Feels a little weird, man

3003
04:53:42,720 --> 04:53:44,720
All right

3004
04:53:49,280 --> 04:53:53,360
Oh my god, hi boomie. Oh my god, the real life boomie. It's him

3005
04:53:54,320 --> 04:53:56,320
Hi, Sean

3006
04:53:58,560 --> 04:54:01,280
Can you get in the bed if you're gonna hang out up here?

3007
04:54:05,200 --> 04:54:09,280
3.0, she's an alligator. I was like debating whether or not to be like a reptile

3008
04:54:10,160 --> 04:54:12,160
Does that mean they're full? I don't really

3009
04:54:15,760 --> 04:54:20,160
It's really funny because they're very close to their actual colors. The boomie is not a black cat. So that's

3010
04:54:20,880 --> 04:54:25,760
Speaking of boomie, where the fuck did he go? Oh, he's with he's with uh his dad

3011
04:54:29,280 --> 04:54:31,280
Boomi is chewing on the box that

3012
04:54:33,120 --> 04:54:35,120
Who came in?

3013
04:54:37,680 --> 04:54:43,520
All right, well I'm gonna pass the fuck out later. Don't get eaten by something, please

3014
04:54:43,520 --> 04:54:45,520
I

3015
04:54:48,880 --> 04:54:50,880
Like we should I should have made them sleep in the den

3016
04:54:53,120 --> 04:54:55,600
Wake up wake up

3017
04:54:59,200 --> 04:55:02,000
Where's boomie where's boomie

3018
04:55:04,640 --> 04:55:06,640
Where's boomie?

3019
04:55:08,880 --> 04:55:12,320
Okay, Jesus you scared me son

3020
04:55:13,840 --> 04:55:19,920
Would you like some food?

3021
04:55:23,360 --> 04:55:25,360
Enjoy kiddos

3022
04:55:29,280 --> 04:55:32,960
By by nautical you're not really regurgitating enough in my opinion

3023
04:55:32,960 --> 04:55:38,400
No, are you wagging his tail at them?

3024
04:55:38,400 --> 04:55:44,400
Boomi's the wild child. Boomi is the wild child. He's the wild child and then he's he's always smacking feet in the face right now

3025
04:55:45,120 --> 04:55:49,680
Which is funny because they're fighting in the game or they're playing in the game and now they're they're playing

3026
04:55:49,680 --> 04:55:54,880
They're literally right next to me and reina's doing reina always does her own thing. She's like, oh, she's like she's a cool cat

3027
04:55:55,600 --> 04:55:58,080
Um, I'm picking up though reina. Well

3028
04:55:58,800 --> 04:56:02,320
Moving too fast come here child

3029
04:56:04,320 --> 04:56:07,360
Why does it sound like something from the princess bride?

3030
04:56:08,320 --> 04:56:10,320
Where are the children? Oh my god

3031
04:56:11,120 --> 04:56:14,480
What are you doing all the way over here?

3032
04:56:15,920 --> 04:56:20,000
Yeah, does he have a stick in his mouth? Oh, he's a bone

3033
04:56:22,320 --> 04:56:24,320
Oh

3034
04:56:25,280 --> 04:56:27,280
Oh, he's a bone

3035
04:56:30,320 --> 04:56:33,600
How long does it take for them to get that big?

3036
04:56:35,440 --> 04:56:37,600
Oh my god, this is gonna take fucking forever

3037
04:56:39,280 --> 04:56:41,280
They're only at seven pounds

3038
04:56:43,920 --> 04:56:45,920
How high is the affinity?

3039
04:56:49,120 --> 04:56:51,120
Oh my god

3040
04:56:51,760 --> 04:56:56,240
Sorry, I didn't mean to pee right in front of you. He didn't have to whine like a baby about it

3041
04:56:56,960 --> 04:56:59,440
Well, what are you actually doing? I'm talking to him

3042
04:57:00,240 --> 04:57:02,240
Right now. Um, okay. I have to go

What there's a fucking bear

3050
04:57:42,640 --> 04:57:44,640
Why is it saying there's a grizzly?

3051
04:57:46,640 --> 04:57:48,640
I don't see a fucking grizzly

3052
04:57:49,520 --> 04:57:54,720
What's with the grizzly thing where is said grizzly?

3053
04:58:01,200 --> 04:58:03,200
Where is it

3054
04:58:07,360 --> 04:58:12,720
Where's the fucking grizzly I'm gonna end its life. I will literally kill it

3055
04:58:15,760 --> 04:58:17,760
Oh, what the fuck

You no, you're not killing fucking fear

3057
04:58:30,320 --> 04:58:38,160
Get the fuck out of here. I'm so happy I didn't leave because I almost did no stay away from fear

3058
04:58:44,640 --> 04:58:46,640

Okay, I'm gonna nap first. That was terrifying. I was actually like scared

3069
04:59:27,360 --> 04:59:29,360

04:59:32,400 --> 04:59:36,640

3077
05:00:07,200 --> 05:00:10,880
Oh, okay, I guess by nautical you are amazing

3078
05:00:12,080 --> 05:00:18,640
I think by nautical uh scared him off. So that's cool. Um nice, okay

3079
05:00:21,760 --> 05:00:23,760
I'm gonna go piss over here

3080
05:00:28,560 --> 05:00:29,840
Okay

3081
05:00:29,840 --> 05:00:32,160
Sorry, I have to make sure I'm in the right orientation

3082
05:00:33,120 --> 05:00:37,360
I'm not like, oh, I need to go north. I'm like, oh, I must point my arrow in the right way

3083
05:00:38,880 --> 05:00:40,880
Otherwise bad things will happen

3084
05:00:47,520 --> 05:00:53,520
So that boosted a bunch no, I think I'm not oh, yeah now I'm in the right one

3085
05:01:00,000 --> 05:01:05,840
Rogue ass wolves be on uncle put in some work there. Honestly props to by nautical. I'm I'm very impressed with him

3086
05:01:06,560 --> 05:01:09,200
I'm not gonna bother to go all the way over there for that. Um

3087
05:01:11,840 --> 05:01:18,320
I'm gonna go down down the river that's not down the river

3088
05:01:23,040 --> 05:01:25,440
To see if I can find some food in the corner

3089
05:01:25,440 --> 05:01:30,640
One of the puppies is like super low

3090
05:01:38,000 --> 05:01:40,000
I think it's

3091
05:01:45,520 --> 05:01:48,960
Damn rena is still sick rena may not make it

3092
05:01:49,280 --> 05:01:51,280
Oh

3093
05:01:51,600 --> 05:01:57,840
Not good. She's at 20 life right now. Jesus. Fuck. I didn't mean to go that way

3094
05:01:59,600 --> 05:02:01,600
Why is there like no

3095
05:02:02,720 --> 05:02:09,120
You know, I must I'm not even gonna focus on taking over corners. I might just focus on trying to fucking find food

3096
05:02:13,760 --> 05:02:15,760
That way

3097
05:02:19,120 --> 05:02:21,120
Oh

3098
05:02:32,000 --> 05:02:34,000
Come on

3099
05:02:38,160 --> 05:02:40,160
Get it get it

3100
05:02:40,960 --> 05:02:42,960
I

3101
05:02:47,200 --> 05:02:49,200
Let that not fuck you up

3102
05:02:53,760 --> 05:02:55,760
There we go

3103
05:02:57,600 --> 05:03:02,000
Almost there almost got you come here come here

3104
05:03:04,320 --> 05:03:06,320
You're almost dead

3105
05:03:07,760 --> 05:03:09,760
You're mine

3106
05:03:10,320 --> 05:03:12,320
Oh

3107
05:03:12,400 --> 05:03:14,400
No, I'm out of stamina

3108
05:03:17,120 --> 05:03:19,120
But so are you

3109
05:03:21,520 --> 05:03:26,240
You better oh my god, let's wait till I get my stamina back

3110
05:03:32,800 --> 05:03:34,800
Stop trying to fight back just fucking die

3111
05:03:40,240 --> 05:03:42,320
Actually, I can take a little piece of meat

3112
05:03:45,360 --> 05:03:50,720
I ate that meat chunk because I can probably bring a meat chunk back to what's his face

3113
05:03:55,520 --> 05:03:57,600
Or maybe not I guess I I guess I can't

3114
05:03:59,920 --> 05:04:01,920
I'm eating the deer's ass

3115
05:04:05,840 --> 05:04:07,840
Okay

3116
05:04:10,160 --> 05:04:12,160
I

3117
05:04:15,040 --> 05:04:17,520
Might as well just take this fucking square while I'm at it

3118
05:04:22,240 --> 05:04:26,240
My nautical getting a wind and dying while I was trying to I don't know if it's gonna work out

3119
05:04:27,440 --> 05:04:31,360
At least I killed that like right next to our stuff

3120
05:04:35,440 --> 05:04:39,280
Oh, they might show up that would suck if they did

3121
05:04:40,160 --> 05:04:42,160
So

3122
05:04:43,600 --> 05:04:46,400
Because they are fairly close

3123
05:04:50,560 --> 05:04:52,560
Oh, okay

3124
05:05:00,320 --> 05:05:04,240
Oh my god, you go I need to go take care of rena

3125
05:05:04,240 --> 05:05:11,600
I'm just gonna pee fucking everywhere

3126
05:05:16,000 --> 05:05:18,000
Oh wait

3127
05:05:27,360 --> 05:05:30,800
How am I still not technically in here there we go

3128
05:05:35,120 --> 05:05:38,640
Oh damn it whatever all right

3129
05:05:47,840 --> 05:05:51,440
I think with the dot in the square it means you can never like

3130
05:05:52,960 --> 05:05:56,400
Um, I'll lose that square which is are the hexagon which is nice

3131
05:06:05,200 --> 05:06:11,200
Yeah, it's a lot easier to maintain the hexagons now now that when you actually have a den in place and like a

3132
05:06:11,840 --> 05:06:13,840
Tree you don't have to do as much

3133
05:06:14,880 --> 05:06:18,080
To like maintain it except to run around every once in a while

3134
05:06:25,120 --> 05:06:28,880
Wolf wasn't pissing she's squared on command. Oh my god

3135
05:06:35,200 --> 05:06:40,960
All right, where's again I lose track of where the fucking den is

3136
05:06:47,600 --> 05:06:49,600
Hello

3137
05:06:50,160 --> 05:06:52,160
Oh

3138
05:07:00,320 --> 05:07:03,440
Wait, I shouldn't be able to see them from here. Okay, perfect

3139
05:07:08,560 --> 05:07:16,960
Hey guys, I got some food for you. How you doing rena? I didn't mean to go in there. I wasn't even close to being in there

3140
05:07:19,600 --> 05:07:21,600

3141
05:07:25,600 --> 05:07:29,120

05:07:51,280 --> 05:07:53,280
Come eat your food kid

3147
05:07:58,720 --> 05:08:01,200

3148

She's even lower than before. Oh, no

3156
05:08:52,880 --> 05:08:54,880
She's at 13 percent

3157
05:09:02,640 --> 05:09:10,000
No, poor old they don't know if reina's gonna make it. I'm generally gonna cry

3158
05:09:16,080 --> 05:09:22,240
It's gonna be like rena died in the night. She didn't make it. Can I wake up, please?

3159
05:09:32,320 --> 05:09:35,680
Oh, thank god, look at it. That's actually literally how she'll sleep on me though

3160
05:09:37,200 --> 05:09:39,360
And I come out and it's like fia and boomie are dead

3161
05:09:40,320 --> 05:09:42,320

3162
05:09:43,280 --> 05:09:46,720

3163
05:09:54,480 --> 05:09:56,480
Reina come eat

3164
05:10:01,440 --> 05:10:06,480

3165
05:10:12,880 --> 05:10:14,880

Can I can I do that with

3172
05:10:46,800 --> 05:10:48,800
I don't really think it can

3173
05:10:50,080 --> 05:10:52,080
You know how well

3174
05:10:54,640 --> 05:10:56,640
We stay winning

3175
05:11:01,520 --> 05:11:03,920
Wait, I like how it said reina's recovered what she's

3176
05:11:04,720 --> 05:11:09,760
Okay, she's just recovering I suppose booby is a fat dude

3177
05:11:12,080 --> 05:11:17,600
If they need to use a hundred percent we could move to a new den but we're fine really

3178
05:11:24,160 --> 05:11:29,040
What's up for you oh you so cute girly pop

3179
05:11:34,720 --> 05:11:40,720
The binautical is just hanging out I suppose what the hell is reina walking weird

3180
05:11:47,920 --> 05:11:49,920
Okay, let me see

3181
05:11:49,920 --> 05:11:55,360
Okay, let's say they thought they took that square over. Oh my god blue has taken the whole bottom. Holy crap

3182
05:11:57,280 --> 05:11:59,280
Damn blue

3183
05:11:59,440 --> 05:12:01,440
I

3184
05:12:02,960 --> 05:12:04,960
Think I'm gonna go for that

3185
05:12:05,920 --> 05:12:08,720
Um carcass real quick

3186
05:12:11,120 --> 05:12:13,120
So I'm gonna tell them to

3187
05:12:15,520 --> 05:12:17,520
Roof

3188
05:12:18,640 --> 05:12:23,920
Get back, okay, he just fucking brought them over like yeah, I could get back in there

3189
05:12:24,400 --> 05:12:26,400
You're back in there

3190
05:12:28,000 --> 05:12:36,160
Go on okay, I'm gonna go to that carcass if it's not taken over by stuff

3191
05:12:39,040 --> 05:12:43,920
Yeah, I don't really need like you know, uh the binautical can kind of just

3192
05:12:46,640 --> 05:12:50,640
Can kind of just like hang out stay home be a little stay at home dad

3193
05:12:54,000 --> 05:13:02,160
I should have brought that to him. I don't think he'll eat stuff that I bring him though unless it's a maybe if it's a meat chunk

3194
05:13:04,080 --> 05:13:06,080
We'll try it

3195
05:13:10,880 --> 05:13:13,680
Can't smell the carcass so I don't even know if it's around anymore

3196
05:13:18,400 --> 05:13:20,400
But there's me a fucking grizzly at it

3197
05:13:24,320 --> 05:13:30,560
I feel like I'm playing like mine survival minecraft except its wolves and it's nothing like this. Oh, it's just a coyote

3198
05:13:36,560 --> 05:13:39,360
Not pee real quick squirtin

3199
05:13:41,520 --> 05:13:48,180
Where's the uh, what the hell? Oh, that's right. I forgot it was in their territory

3200
05:13:54,880 --> 05:14:02,320
I can't wait for the velar minecraft server. Yeah, it would be goofy. I'm not good at minecraft at all

3201
05:14:07,280 --> 05:14:10,480
Props are going to be bigger more depends on the standard in a way as long as pack of any side

3202
05:14:10,480 --> 05:14:12,720
But remember I suppose my venture out when finny drops too low

3203
05:14:13,440 --> 05:14:18,320
And it's a fleet infestation worse since props will be more likely to leave the den as affinity drops keeping my small

3204
05:14:19,200 --> 05:14:21,200
Okay, pack affinity

3205
05:14:21,680 --> 05:14:23,680
I can't that's so small

3206
05:14:25,120 --> 05:14:27,520
This was at one point they'll be tempted to leave the den

3207
05:14:29,040 --> 05:14:30,880
But like how

3208
05:14:30,880 --> 05:14:35,520
Is if it gets that below I suppose if it gets that okay. Yeah, because I'm like a hundred

3209
05:14:40,160 --> 05:14:45,120
It's my carcass gone bro. I'm about to pee on this fucking marker. I don't even give a shit

3210
05:14:46,080 --> 05:14:48,080
But you're fucking you

3211
05:15:03,360 --> 05:15:05,360
Um

3212
05:15:05,600 --> 05:15:10,560
Wonder if I should though diagonal. Yeah, fuck it. We ball

3213
05:15:12,800 --> 05:15:14,800
Seems like everybody's fine

3214
05:15:15,840 --> 05:15:17,840
I'll try to find some food on the way

3215
05:15:20,160 --> 05:15:24,720
Oh, I swear to god, I didn't go that way, but okay go off

3216
05:15:29,680 --> 05:15:32,640

3217
05:15:34,640 --> 05:15:40,240
Make sure the long streams you be good night. Yeah, of course. I'm just I'm just hanging out. I'm just having a good time

3218
05:15:45,360 --> 05:15:47,360
But uh, I'm happy you enjoyed

3219
05:15:48,320 --> 05:15:51,680
I'm like honestly really tempted just to keep playing until I beat this

3220
05:15:53,840 --> 05:15:55,840
Oh, it's grizzly fuck

3221
05:15:56,400 --> 05:16:00,800
Grizzly better not be going near my babies or we're not gonna have a good time

3222
05:16:02,000 --> 05:16:04,000
What's that?

3223
05:16:06,080 --> 05:16:08,080
Is that

3224
05:16:15,200 --> 05:16:17,200
Is that an elk

3225
05:16:25,040 --> 05:16:27,040
Maybe I can run it to the edge of the map. Yeah

3226
05:16:30,560 --> 05:16:32,640
Fuck oh shit

3227
05:16:36,560 --> 05:16:38,640
Damn it. Okay. Well, I'm out of here

3228
05:16:38,640 --> 05:16:44,560

Is that it over there? Yeah, this I'm gonna go piss on your fucking scent marker, dude

3230
05:17:00,240 --> 05:17:09,840
Cause I'm a bad bitch. Oh, I can't mark territory to fight

3231
05:17:22,800 --> 05:17:25,520

3232
05:17:29,680 --> 05:17:31,680
Damn it

3233
05:17:36,960 --> 05:17:40,720
Why I'm like don't know what's going on with my camera. I like can't do anything

3234
05:17:51,280 --> 05:17:56,640
What the fuck did he go like he's grabbing me before I fucking can

3235
05:18:00,560 --> 05:18:02,560

05:18:04,000 --> 05:18:06,720
This is okay. This is a really dumb mechanic because

3237
05:18:09,120 --> 05:18:16,480
It's not letting me like turn the fucking face. Oh, I didn't mean to do that

3238
05:18:23,440 --> 05:18:25,440
Cause like I'm biting him first

3239
05:18:30,560 --> 05:18:33,280
It's it's like fucking up my camera

3240
05:18:34,800 --> 05:18:37,280
And I don't know why it's doing that

3241
05:18:38,560 --> 05:18:42,240
Okay, apparently he is dead. He got scared

3242
05:18:43,920 --> 05:18:47,600

It's really just it's literally like I can't

3246
05:19:09,360 --> 05:19:15,120
The game camera like it resets your camera and it fucks with your camera so I can't turn

3247
05:19:25,040 --> 05:19:27,760
I want to take this whole bottom corner it's gonna be mine

3248

05:20:36,960 --> 05:20:38,960
I was trying to find the prawn horn

3260
05:20:38,960 --> 05:20:46,480
My house still smells like burnt popcorn

3261
05:20:49,680 --> 05:20:54,800

05:21:23,120 --> 05:21:25,120
Why isn't it my lock on working?

3266
05:21:26,000 --> 05:21:30,560
Am I too far away? No, it's just oh, I love it. I love it

3267
05:21:31,520 --> 05:21:35,280
Can I not target lock on if I'm like injured or some shit?

3268
05:21:40,720 --> 05:21:42,720

Oh, perfect. I'm killing you all right here. Oh, damn it. They ran around me

3273

Cool

3274
05:22:25,440 --> 05:22:28,400
Let's see if I can take a piece of meat off for husband

3275
05:22:29,360 --> 05:22:33,440
Oh, I can perfect drop that save that for him

3276
05:22:39,280 --> 05:22:41,280
All right, I'll do a little how

3277
05:22:44,160 --> 05:22:48,480
I'm burning popcorn now my house is still I'm just trying to pick it up

3278
05:22:50,240 --> 05:22:54,240
Um, I don't even know why it does it's been days

3279
05:22:55,040 --> 05:22:58,960
It seems like there's always prawn horn in that little area

3280
05:23:00,560 --> 05:23:03,520
I'm a bad bitch. You can't kill me

3281
05:23:11,360 --> 05:23:15,520
I come home my family's massacre like fucking you she honk land style

3282
05:23:18,960 --> 05:23:21,280
It's like ram the mass wolves

3283
05:23:24,960 --> 05:23:28,800
Run towards the moon. I am going the wrong way

3284
05:23:29,920 --> 05:23:31,920
Excuse me

3285
05:23:32,640 --> 05:23:40,320
Give me a second. I need to get my story straight. My friends are sorry the little shaking noise sounded like that song

3286
05:23:41,680 --> 05:23:47,120
Hey, then the empire's staying in love. She is waiting for me. That's to cross the ball

3287
05:23:47,600 --> 05:23:49,600
Oh

3288
05:23:51,120 --> 05:23:55,280
Isn't it someone in the beginning of that asking minus

3289
05:24:00,400 --> 05:24:02,960
Okay, I saw the meat in the mouth. I was like the extra limit

3290
05:24:05,840 --> 05:24:07,840
What the fuck is happening?

3291
05:24:07,840 --> 05:24:09,840
I

3292
05:24:15,200 --> 05:24:17,200
Where's the den?

3293
05:24:19,120 --> 05:24:21,120
Oh my god

3294
05:24:21,360 --> 05:24:28,320
Sometimes it's like it's hidden by my scent marker thing and the whatever so it's not showing me where the den is

3295
05:24:29,360 --> 05:24:33,840
I guess I just go towards that marker since technically I fucking pissed there. Can I follow it?

3296
05:24:38,160 --> 05:24:40,160
I think not

3297
05:24:42,320 --> 05:24:47,520
Perhaps I guess I can maybe it is good that I like fucking pissed on it

3298
05:24:50,320 --> 05:24:52,720
Oh, it actually is a good idea that I pissed on it

3299
05:25:00,080 --> 05:25:02,080
Honey I brought you some food

3300
05:25:03,280 --> 05:25:05,280

3302
05:25:13,520 --> 05:25:15,520
Get out

3303
05:25:22,400 --> 05:25:28,960
No, okay, if I'm even near that arrow it wants to fucking do it. Why do their names keep getting turned off? I don't understand

3304
05:25:29,360 --> 05:25:31,360
Here you go

3305
05:25:36,240 --> 05:25:39,360
Eat up children

3306
05:25:42,720 --> 05:25:47,120
Boomi you must be fed child. I'm going too fast

3307
05:25:51,120 --> 05:25:58,240
Okay, what are there? Oh my god, this is literally going to take forever for them to grow up

3308
05:26:03,200 --> 05:26:05,200
Okay, well

3309
05:26:06,240 --> 05:26:09,920
I'm going to sleep now. It won't let me in the fucking den. Are you serious?

3310
05:26:12,960 --> 05:26:14,960
It sounds like princess bride music

3311
05:26:16,080 --> 05:26:18,080
I pissed on her house

3312
05:26:18,480 --> 05:26:20,480
It's time to eat

3313
05:26:20,960 --> 05:26:26,960
Please don't let anything kill our puppies. Well, I'm out there. I will freak out so bad

3314
05:26:29,040 --> 05:26:32,640
By nautical if more of our children dies, I blame it on you

3315
05:26:33,600 --> 05:26:35,600
Okay

3316
05:26:36,720 --> 05:26:43,760
It's like kimchi flavored seaweed. Oh, I got two of the puppies in here with me. Where's the third one?

3317
05:26:44,960 --> 05:26:46,960

3318
05:26:48,960 --> 05:26:51,840
Okay, Boomi's just out there. That's fine. That's okay

05:26:53,680 --> 05:26:55,680
Let's see. Where are we at?

3320
05:26:56,240 --> 05:26:58,720
Our set marks are good. I'm gonna piss here

3321
05:26:59,920 --> 05:27:01,920
Well, I'm gonna howl here

3322
05:27:02,640 --> 05:27:04,640

3323
05:27:07,920 --> 05:27:11,360

You batch of pups in the oven yet? I have to wait for these ones to grow up

3329
05:27:44,880 --> 05:27:48,000
Then I'll start start auctioning off names to the highest bidder

3330
05:27:51,440 --> 05:27:53,760
All right, I'll watch the pups while by nautical

05:27:57,680 --> 05:28:01,200
Whatever he's doing, uh, I wish I could see him on the map

3333
05:28:03,760 --> 05:28:05,760
He's not that far away actually

3334
05:28:06,960 --> 05:28:08,960
I wonder

3335
05:28:08,960 --> 05:28:11,840
What is he doing over there? He's literally just like standing

3336
05:28:17,440 --> 05:28:19,840
All right, well I am going to

3337
05:28:24,960 --> 05:28:26,960

All my children

I'm so I'm kind of happy I named them after my god

3342
05:28:49,120 --> 05:28:51,120
I think it makes me try harder

3343
05:28:53,760 --> 05:28:55,760
Okay, what is this thing it's like

Oh, that's so good

3348
05:29:18,880 --> 05:29:20,880
It's like kimchi spicy seaweed

3349
05:29:21,440 --> 05:29:24,160
I don't even want to eat this because this would be so good

3350
05:29:25,120 --> 05:29:27,120

Wow, I'm really surprised how good this tastes

3354
05:29:47,680 --> 05:29:50,480

05:35:15,600 --> 05:35:17,600
Die

3396
05:35:21,600 --> 05:35:23,600
Die

3397
05:35:25,600 --> 05:35:27,600
Grab some meat

3398
05:35:33,200 --> 05:35:35,200
Sick

3399
05:35:37,280 --> 05:35:39,280
We did it

3400
05:35:43,360 --> 05:35:45,360
No, the fucking crows are here

3401
05:35:51,760 --> 05:35:57,600
Oh, excuse me boomie. What are you doing sir? He's back up. Thank you

3402
05:36:02,240 --> 05:36:04,640
All right, I'll take this with me I'm gonna do a little howl

3403
05:36:07,600 --> 05:36:10,720
Oh, you can't do that if they're mouthful facts

3404
05:36:15,280 --> 05:36:20,320
This again, I need to see hard. Oh god everything probably just be attacked every five seconds

3405
05:36:29,600 --> 05:36:31,760
Okay, I have it in my mouth and then we're gonna go

3406
05:36:32,640 --> 05:36:39,360
So kind of just why are there reds nearby weird

3407
05:36:51,760 --> 05:36:53,760
They second pee with my mouthful

3408
05:37:02,320 --> 05:37:09,520
All right, that stuff is actually not agreeing with my stomach tastes is so good, but now my tummy hurts

3409
05:37:18,160 --> 05:37:24,800
All right, perfect. I'm actually realizing that I only goes out when you enter a new hexagon

3410
05:37:27,120 --> 05:37:29,840
Like I noticed that earlier, but I'm just I'm saying it out loud

3411
05:37:32,640 --> 05:37:34,640
Some nice ratings. Thank you

3412
05:37:44,080 --> 05:37:46,080
So close

3413
05:37:48,400 --> 05:37:50,900
Everybody's howling in these parts what's going on

3414
05:37:51,620 --> 05:37:53,620
Um

3415
05:37:57,860 --> 05:38:00,260
I'm about to take over bitches

3416
05:38:07,620 --> 05:38:14,260
I think is that the stunt marker because I'm pretty sure I did the stunt marker over here. Well, what I'm gonna do right now

3417
05:38:21,540 --> 05:38:23,540
Uh

3418
05:38:25,140 --> 05:38:27,140
Uh-huh purple is wavering fleas

3419
05:38:28,020 --> 05:38:32,980
Where pups stay in the den the faster if you please so they stay outside use the dens for shelter or safety for predators

3420
05:38:34,660 --> 05:38:38,820
Puppies are what likely to leave the den as flea load increases

3421
05:38:39,380 --> 05:38:41,700
keeping out of the blue point in the pack affinity meter

3422
05:38:43,220 --> 05:38:49,060
Marks the point your pups will be tempted to leave the den. Oh, okay. Oh, that's a pointer. That's so weird

3423
05:38:50,900 --> 05:38:52,900
I

3424
05:39:02,420 --> 05:39:04,660
Can't do that with my mouth full there we go

3425
05:39:18,420 --> 05:39:20,420
Cool

3426
05:39:21,460 --> 05:39:23,460
All right might as well go back

3427
05:39:26,180 --> 05:39:32,180
We we got in a pretty good chunk. It's not as big. I would like a corner for ourselves like I keep saying so

3428
05:39:35,220 --> 05:39:37,220
I'll work on that

3429
05:39:44,580 --> 05:39:47,220
I'm gonna just go straight ahead. Yep

3430
05:39:51,300 --> 05:39:56,820
I wish there was an auto run so I don't have to fucking be doing this

3431
05:39:57,140 --> 05:39:59,140
I

3432
05:40:18,740 --> 05:40:21,060
Was thinking I'm like, you know, I don't really have a lot to say today

3433
05:40:22,500 --> 05:40:25,620
Usually I'm like yeah master 3000, but I think just like

3434
05:40:26,900 --> 05:40:28,900
I

3435
05:40:29,460 --> 05:40:33,700
Like shit that how how life be I'm just like I'm just tired today

3436
05:40:35,380 --> 05:40:37,380
And I don't I'm not yapping as much

3437
05:40:40,580 --> 05:40:42,580
Who's that

3438
05:40:43,380 --> 05:40:45,380
Oh the fox

3439
05:40:45,460 --> 05:40:47,460
He's hanging out. I'm not gonna kill him

3440
05:40:49,220 --> 05:40:52,100
Yeah, we're just hanging because have you the background

3441
05:40:53,380 --> 05:40:55,380
Don't have to be nothing serious, you know

3442
05:40:56,340 --> 05:40:58,340
Making myself fucking dizzy playing this

3443
05:41:01,940 --> 05:41:04,420
Game's just too intense. I know it's just too intense

3444
05:41:06,260 --> 05:41:08,260
Like how could I not?

3445
05:41:16,260 --> 05:41:20,980
Oh fleas are there random like dust doubles everywhere

3446
05:41:25,700 --> 05:41:27,700
Where am I?

3447
05:41:29,220 --> 05:41:32,660
Sometimes I like to go see if there's like anything near the oh

3448
05:41:34,260 --> 05:41:36,980
Can I run you guys towards the den?

3449
05:41:39,780 --> 05:41:43,620
Can you run that way go how okay

3450
05:41:45,540 --> 05:41:50,500
Oh, you knocked the meat out of my mouth. No, I have to kill one of you. Which one's a fawn

3451
05:41:51,300 --> 05:41:53,300
Oh

3452
05:41:56,180 --> 05:42:05,460
Looking for a fawn looking for a fawn. Sorry don't mind me. I'm just looking for a fawn. There's a lot of bucks in this herd

3453
05:42:07,380 --> 05:42:09,380
Ah, why are you guys both attacking me?

3454
05:42:17,540 --> 05:42:19,540
Oh do you then

3455
05:42:21,460 --> 05:42:23,460
Now

3456
05:42:27,780 --> 05:42:30,580
Oh, I didn't mean to grab you but this also works

3457
05:42:32,580 --> 05:42:34,660
Well

3458
05:42:34,660 --> 05:42:36,260
She whipped her around

3459
05:42:36,260 --> 05:42:40,340
I might have to come call reinforcements for this one. Oh come back

3460
05:42:45,780 --> 05:42:49,460
Yeah, I don't think I'll be able to fuck can't believe I dropped the meat

3461
05:42:50,660 --> 05:42:56,420
I'll come back to that. Oh, there's an elk is still over here

3462
05:43:01,940 --> 05:43:03,940
Raspberry elk herd that's cute

3463
05:43:09,620 --> 05:43:11,860
What the fuck oh coyotes hello

3464
05:43:14,900 --> 05:43:16,900
Yes some more

3465
05:43:21,140 --> 05:43:32,500
Cool take that to him. I'm happy I killed that nearby. I'm exhausted. I'm going the wrong way

3466
05:43:40,020 --> 05:43:42,020
Bring this back to the hubbin

3467
05:43:42,900 --> 05:43:47,300
Your health is scarily low. No, it's not if it was less if it was

3468
05:43:48,180 --> 05:43:53,460
Yeah, no, it's it's actually not that low. It's low, but it's like it's not that bad

3469
05:43:54,260 --> 05:43:55,780
You know

3470
05:43:55,780 --> 05:43:57,780
It's fine

3471
05:43:59,220 --> 05:44:06,100
I think I accidentally cut off my peeing animation. There we go. I realize sometimes I just pee too fast

3472
05:44:17,700 --> 05:44:23,300
I'm also exhausted. Yeah, yeah, dead nearby. It's probably mine

3473
05:44:30,180 --> 05:44:34,020
Oh, hi Rena. I was wondering where you've been. That's not big mama

3474
05:44:35,540 --> 05:44:39,860
Rena's been pretty chill today. She's been doing her own thing. Hi, you thinking of me?

3475
05:44:40,660 --> 05:44:42,660
I missed you, but whoa

3476
05:44:43,220 --> 05:44:44,660
What's the matter?

3477
05:44:44,660 --> 05:44:49,620
Oh, it's because boomie walked up and she saw him and she got upset. Are you okay?

3478
05:44:52,020 --> 05:44:54,020
No

3479
05:44:54,420 --> 05:44:56,420
It's just me

3480
05:44:56,500 --> 05:44:58,500
Boomi's not around

3481
05:45:01,060 --> 05:45:03,060
She's not happy

3482
05:45:06,580 --> 05:45:09,620
Oh, I see what's going on

3483
05:45:09,620 --> 05:45:13,940
Rina do I got to bring you to the vet again?

3484
05:45:15,540 --> 05:45:20,020
I think Rena Rena is again. She's an older cat. Um

3485
05:45:22,420 --> 05:45:24,420
So sometimes

3486
05:45:25,540 --> 05:45:29,140
She was I was kind of confused because she was acting pretty lethargic today

3487
05:45:30,660 --> 05:45:32,340
Um

3488
05:45:32,340 --> 05:45:36,580
And I was like why are she she's just like kind of hanging out by herself and I'm like what's going on here lady

3489
05:45:37,380 --> 05:45:39,380
and um

3490
05:45:39,380 --> 05:45:45,860
She sometimes gets like one of her uh her glands clogged and I think that's what's going on because

3491
05:45:47,460 --> 05:45:49,460
Boomi leave her alone. She doesn't feel good

3492
05:45:51,220 --> 05:45:54,420
Because her her booty looked weird. Can you move?

3493
05:45:57,060 --> 05:45:59,700
Oopsies I must maybe drop my controller dude

3494
05:46:04,580 --> 05:46:06,580
All right, let me see

3495
05:46:07,540 --> 05:46:11,620
Put that down. There you go. That's for you. It's your meat chunk

3496
05:46:16,500 --> 05:46:18,500
Come and get it

3497
05:46:20,660 --> 05:46:22,660
Come and get it proper tins

3498
05:46:24,740 --> 05:46:26,740
Boomi, please stop tearing up my thing

3499
05:46:27,700 --> 05:46:29,700
Boomi's attacking my foot rest

3500
05:46:30,500 --> 05:46:35,780
Yo, Rena barked. Yeah, she's older. So like sometimes it doesn't it won't express itself

3501
05:46:36,340 --> 05:46:38,340
So I'm probably actually I'm gonna

3502
05:46:39,060 --> 05:46:43,460
Make an appointment for it can't hurt gland express. I've tried to do it myself

3503
05:46:44,340 --> 05:46:46,100
um

3504
05:46:46,100 --> 05:46:50,020
It's just it's really hard. Yeah, I could see it. She's not having a good time

3505
05:46:52,340 --> 05:46:55,940
It's funny because she was like fine yesterday, so I'm wondering if something happened

3506
05:46:59,620 --> 05:47:03,700
Why do you look so mad? She's like I don't feel good my butt hurts

3507
05:47:04,660 --> 05:47:11,220
All right, don't worry miss ma'am. I'll take you to the vet ASAP. So you feel right as rain

3508
05:47:11,940 --> 05:47:16,660
Although you're gonna hate it because you hate having your butt touched, but it is what it is

3509
05:47:22,260 --> 05:47:25,060
Grumpy she's like I don't like it. It's like this

3510
05:47:27,700 --> 05:47:31,300
If I want to be backed up every other month. Yeah, so it's such a weird thing

3511
05:47:31,300 --> 05:47:34,900
It's like she has plenty of fiber. She has it's just like, you know, just age

3512
05:47:35,620 --> 05:47:37,620
She's 14 so

3513
05:47:40,980 --> 05:47:42,980
He's like give me that meat chunk

3514
05:47:51,860 --> 05:47:54,260
Enjoy let's see how the thing is

3515
05:47:55,060 --> 05:48:00,100
And it's so funny that is it okay, is it weird that the game's like rain is sick

3516
05:48:00,180 --> 05:48:05,140
She was sick immediately and then she got better. That's so weird. I'm sorry. That's just weird to me

3517
05:48:09,220 --> 05:48:12,740
That's weird the game's telling me that my own cat's sick

3518
05:48:14,100 --> 05:48:16,100
I didn't mean to lock on a boomy

3519
05:48:16,100 --> 05:48:18,100
There you go

3520
05:48:18,580 --> 05:48:20,580
I

3521
05:48:21,140 --> 05:48:24,020
Said she got better so we're short so we did so we write as rain

3522
05:48:26,740 --> 05:48:30,580
Maybe you're weird I am weird the game knows you

3523
05:48:32,980 --> 05:48:36,020
All right, I think I'm actually am gonna end it here

3524
05:48:36,580 --> 05:48:41,780
I'm wondering if I should just like I really want to finish this game now, but I want to check on rain and make sure she's good

3525
05:48:42,340 --> 05:48:44,340
Maybe I can put some um

3526
05:48:45,060 --> 05:48:46,420
I can give her

3527
05:48:46,420 --> 05:48:50,740
She has pain medication that I can give her so at least she'll be comfortable before I take her to the vet tomorrow

3528
05:48:51,140 --> 05:48:56,020
I have a really nice vet. She's honestly, uh, super close to my family. She um

3529
05:48:57,140 --> 05:48:59,860
Took care of fia when fia was going through her stuff

3530
05:49:00,900 --> 05:49:07,140
Um, and it was like she was so nice because she would literally just give us stuff. Um, like me and my current stuff are free

3531
05:49:07,940 --> 05:49:09,940
um

3532
05:49:10,340 --> 05:49:17,380
Like I had to like get medication. She's like, no, it's free and I'm like, oh because she like I was spending again like I've spent

3533
05:49:18,340 --> 05:49:23,140
Like eight over eight thousand dollars on getting fia better and they still don't know

3534
05:49:23,300 --> 05:49:26,100
They still don't know what caused her legs to stop working

3535
05:49:26,740 --> 05:49:32,900
They still don't know they ran so many tests cat scans all the scans MRIs

3536
05:49:33,700 --> 05:49:37,380
Ultra sounds they still don't know she's she's like, oh, she was perfectly fine

3537
05:49:37,460 --> 05:49:40,740
I don't know why this is happening. Like is she is she doing it for attention?

3538
05:49:46,420 --> 05:49:50,420
Cat scans but don't oh, oh, oh, oh. They're just so funny. Where did fia go?

3539
05:49:53,380 --> 05:49:56,980
Um, I'm missing a child

3540
05:49:56,980 --> 05:50:09,620
Let me go check if she's in here.

3541
05:50:09,620 --> 05:50:12,740
Wait, is this a save and pack info?

3542
05:50:12,740 --> 05:50:15,660
Oh yeah, Fiat isn't dead.

3543
05:50:15,660 --> 05:50:17,180
Oh, it means 10 pounds.

3544
05:50:17,180 --> 05:50:19,740
Okay, we're getting close.

3545
05:50:19,740 --> 05:50:20,740
I'm gonna save.

3546
05:50:20,740 --> 05:50:25,420
I have to save it as something?

3547
05:50:25,420 --> 05:50:26,420
Can I just save it?

3548
05:50:26,420 --> 05:50:44,180
Um, save it as Reina Grumpy.

3549
05:50:44,180 --> 05:50:55,020
Here we go.

3550
05:50:56,020 --> 05:50:57,020
Perfect.

3551
05:50:57,020 --> 05:51:04,020
It didn't even, it doesn't even work when I type with the controller.

3552
05:51:04,020 --> 05:51:09,020
Reina Grumpy.

3553
05:51:09,020 --> 05:51:12,020
Save you.

3554
05:51:12,020 --> 05:51:15,020
Alright.

3555
05:51:15,020 --> 05:51:18,020
Thank you guys for watching.

3556
05:51:18,020 --> 05:51:20,020
