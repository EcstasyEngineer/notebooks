02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You

03:14.080 --> 03:15.680
Hello

03:15.680 --> 03:23.420
How's it going? It's an early morning for madam and when I say early it's just 10 a.m

03:23.920 --> 03:25.920
which is the time that

03:26.520 --> 03:29.400
normal people have already gotten up, but you know

03:30.480 --> 03:32.480
Oh

03:32.480 --> 03:36.400
Yeah, you can't see it in my brand new reaction to this game. Yep. Mm-hmm

03:37.920 --> 03:41.780
It's I can't wait. It's gonna be so fun. I've never played this game before

03:46.080 --> 03:48.080
Can't wait can't wait

03:54.080 --> 03:57.200
Turn that BGM down just a smidge in it

03:57.760 --> 04:00.260
How are you guys doing? I

04:01.280 --> 04:06.960
Have Fia on my lap and she's rolling around. What do you do in lady? Oh, she's leaving now, huh?

04:06.960 --> 04:12.160
But it was fun snuggling with you. I was hoping to get some purrs on the microphone. I

04:14.920 --> 04:19.380
Have early let me just wake up

04:22.080 --> 04:24.580
Grab Russian put a little little makeup I

04:25.540 --> 04:31.820
Know some of my Euro viewers are probably pretty happy. I'm I'm this early

04:33.220 --> 04:35.540
Good morning, European viewers

04:36.300 --> 04:42.140
Yes, this is a European. I'm speaking European. This is my European language

04:44.380 --> 04:50.340
You missed the last hour of stream yesterday we didn't stream yesterday, so I don't know what you're talking about

04:50.340 --> 04:57.620
We're playing the first the first game

04:59.140 --> 05:01.140
Boomi is running laps

05:03.460 --> 05:05.460
You probably can hear him

05:07.060 --> 05:15.140
My voice is a little eh today, so I'm going to probably just let the voice actors do their thing for this

05:16.060 --> 05:18.060
game

05:18.300 --> 05:19.740
Uh

05:19.740 --> 05:22.860
There's a second game. Yeah, the re-up is the second game

05:23.980 --> 05:29.340
Um, yeah, we did in a stream yesterday. I'm so sorry. I canceled stream yesterday guys

05:29.580 --> 05:34.620
I just I'm making it up for you by doing two streams today

05:34.700 --> 05:39.740
You get two count them two streams today. Can you believe it?

05:40.860 --> 05:42.700
You get um

05:42.700 --> 05:46.700
You get the Stanley parable and you get class of 09

05:47.660 --> 05:49.660
How's their 56 year old streamer?

05:50.300 --> 05:53.100
Uh, you know, I was awake at 6 a.m.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.540
And then I was like just like how old people do

05:57.100 --> 05:59.100
Um, and then I got some stuff done

05:59.900 --> 06:02.460
And I went like right before I started stream

06:02.460 --> 06:07.500
I went downstairs to take out the trash and the freaking maintenance guys are in my hallway again

06:08.220 --> 06:12.220
And um, and they were just staring at me and I'm like, uh, and I like I probably

06:13.180 --> 06:15.180
I usually don't

06:15.500 --> 06:16.380
like

06:16.380 --> 06:19.820
wear like wearing hyper revealing clothing

06:20.300 --> 06:25.980
But I was super lazy and I was just wearing some like pajama booty shorts and a sweatshirt and no bras

06:26.220 --> 06:28.220
And then I'm just like carrying a shit ton of trash

06:28.860 --> 06:33.660
In my recycling and then they just stare at me and I'm like, I hate it here

06:33.820 --> 06:36.460
And then I just walk past them into the elevator

06:38.300 --> 06:40.540
For those who don't know, um

06:41.500 --> 06:44.620
For those who don't know, uh the other day

06:45.740 --> 06:49.500
The maintenance guys came into my apartment because they thought I wasn't home. I didn't respond

06:49.580 --> 06:54.460
I had headphones on and I had some fun toys and stuff everywhere

06:55.180 --> 06:59.500
And a hanger on my door that says do not disturb my master

07:01.500 --> 07:08.060
So, uh, I and then they left and I then I realized oh I had stuff out

07:08.860 --> 07:10.620
Awkward

07:10.620 --> 07:13.900
Yeah, they were just changing filters and checking my hot water

07:15.420 --> 07:21.020
I'm almost at 4k subs. I know it's crazy. I'm so thankful for that. Why am I bigger?

07:22.460 --> 07:23.500
Um

07:23.500 --> 07:25.020
I'm just getting bigger

07:25.020 --> 07:30.460
Uh as for the 16k on twitter, it's kind of on my alt account

07:30.700 --> 07:36.700
It's kind of daunting actually and I almost don't like it because one I don't like

07:37.180 --> 07:39.660
I liked having just like a small group of you

07:40.300 --> 07:44.140
Hear my rambles and also my naughty naughty stuff

07:44.780 --> 07:51.420
And then two they're probably mostly bots and not genuine like the sex bots from me saying, um

07:52.460 --> 07:54.460
uh porn

07:54.780 --> 07:57.900
Because like the algorithm's been really liking that word so

07:58.860 --> 08:00.140
But I

08:00.140 --> 08:03.500
I hope you guys enjoyed the feat. I think my favorite reaction

08:04.380 --> 08:06.380
To the feat

08:06.380 --> 08:08.380
pick for 16k

08:09.420 --> 08:11.180
was um

08:11.180 --> 08:13.340
Your alt was promoted on my timeline before

08:14.380 --> 08:17.340
I had at you know, it's just this how it be

08:18.140 --> 08:19.660
my favorite

08:19.660 --> 08:21.340
thing was this like

08:21.340 --> 08:23.340
I thought she was brown

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
She's not dark enough

08:27.900 --> 08:29.900
Kind of like I said I was mixed

08:30.460 --> 08:33.500
I'm very light-skinned. I haven't been outside since the winter

08:34.940 --> 08:36.940
But when I tan I tan like a mother

08:37.740 --> 08:45.980
And I'm like I've only been fighting with this identity crisis my entire life. Now people on the internet are saying I'm not brown enough

08:48.780 --> 08:53.980
And then some people in my maros are like, oh my caramel queen

08:57.660 --> 08:59.660
It's always funny

09:00.140 --> 09:02.140
to me when people

09:02.540 --> 09:03.500
uh

09:03.500 --> 09:07.260
fetishize my skin tone by comparing me to food

09:08.700 --> 09:10.700
That's like always been a thing

09:11.340 --> 09:12.700
like

09:12.700 --> 09:14.700
growing up for me

09:14.700 --> 09:18.700
like, uh caramel, uh milk chocolate, uh

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
peanut butter like

09:21.820 --> 09:23.820
on my eye

09:24.460 --> 09:26.540
I think maybe y'all have a more fetish, but

09:27.100 --> 09:33.900
I'm like, mm milky way. Mm mocha. Uh my snickers queen. I'm just I'm just

09:34.620 --> 09:36.300
food

09:36.300 --> 09:39.820
4 chain traffic slowed down for half an hour half you post anything

09:41.260 --> 09:47.820
Really? That is hilarious. Um, don't steal it. Yeah, I love don't steal it. She though. Um

09:49.580 --> 09:50.700
Uh

09:50.700 --> 09:55.580
You do be looking delicious. Yeah, I got I got my toes done. Um, I won't lie to you

09:55.580 --> 09:58.140
That's like a picture from like a month ago

10:02.060 --> 10:07.660
Because I was preemptively taking photos just as like for like, um

10:09.100 --> 10:12.060
Possible patreon stuff and fansy stuff

10:12.780 --> 10:14.780
If I decide

10:14.780 --> 10:16.780
You brown surprisingly

10:21.340 --> 10:23.340
Honestly, I remember my mom

10:24.300 --> 10:25.580
Uh

10:25.580 --> 10:27.020
She said

10:27.020 --> 10:30.220
When I was bored like my parents were expecting me to be dark

10:31.420 --> 10:33.420
But I've also like lightened over

10:33.900 --> 10:38.300
As I've grown up like I was very very dark skin when I was young and then randomly

10:38.860 --> 10:43.580
I guess my years of being a neat and not seeing the sun just took away my melanin

10:45.580 --> 10:47.900
Chat would you do it for a sheebie snack?

10:48.860 --> 10:50.860
Oh

10:51.260 --> 10:55.820
But yeah, if you have to go to work or you have stuff to do you can have me in the background

10:55.980 --> 11:01.020
You can just you know, we're just hanging out. We're just we're just chilling this morning. Um

11:02.060 --> 11:07.980
I'll probably have a little bit more energy for the the stanley parable stream. I just wanted to make up for you

11:07.980 --> 11:09.980
Know the lack of stream

11:10.380 --> 11:15.580
Yesterday it was so crazy all this stuff happened and I couldn't stream

11:18.140 --> 11:20.140
um, but uh

11:20.620 --> 11:26.460
Jokes on you. This is my off-riding. Oh good for you. Thank you. Thank you. I think you're great

11:27.180 --> 11:29.180
Thank you. I guess

11:29.740 --> 11:35.100
Weird weird wording, but okay, but um guys. I don't want to make

11:36.140 --> 11:38.620
my uh, my flesh roommate

11:39.340 --> 11:42.460
A major point of discussion to be honest with you

11:43.100 --> 11:44.140
um

11:44.140 --> 11:46.860
So just enjoy me sheebie

11:47.660 --> 11:49.660
Forget rtx sheebie

11:50.540 --> 11:52.540
okay

11:52.780 --> 11:54.140
so

11:54.140 --> 11:57.100
Anyways, uh, I should probably eat something

11:58.140 --> 12:02.620
I'm actually okay today despite dying after eating spicy food yesterday

12:03.660 --> 12:05.660
I'm actually okay. I might um

12:06.300 --> 12:13.820
Throw a sandwich that I got that you guys didn't know about that I got yesterday in my hair fryer so that um

12:14.220 --> 12:15.340
Um

12:15.340 --> 12:19.340
So that uh, I can finish the half of that sandwich

12:20.940 --> 12:26.940
I like shapes with all flavors color sizes flesh roommate. Are you talking about? Yeah the cats

12:29.020 --> 12:31.020
I had I

12:31.340 --> 12:33.340
I had to um

12:34.620 --> 12:37.180
I like I'm really mad at my cats because

12:37.980 --> 12:42.780
They have three litter boxes because you should have a litter box for each cat. Okay

12:43.820 --> 12:46.940
And they only like to use one of those litter boxes and I don't get it. I'm like

12:47.820 --> 12:54.220
So I'm just like it takes me like 15 minutes to scoop one litter box and then the rest are like super fast

12:56.140 --> 13:01.260
Uh going to try it end it all on that by at least by yeah, maybe at this point

13:04.060 --> 13:06.940
I'm sorry. Sometimes I'll get notifications on my phone

13:07.500 --> 13:14.940
For like people who like my tweets and stuff and some of you have the most out-of-pocket usernames that I just

13:17.180 --> 13:19.180
I just can't fathom I

13:22.780 --> 13:26.140
Did we're not gonna talk about my cats shits. Why is chat so poor today?

13:27.180 --> 13:33.740
Hello vtuber v connoisseur. Where's my rating bro? Where's my rating? Did you post it?

13:34.700 --> 13:36.700
Um

13:36.940 --> 13:41.100
Your cat's like but but he's for you for me. Uh

13:44.220 --> 13:49.500
I meant I like you for you. You're good boomi. What are you doing big man?

13:50.860 --> 13:58.300
But uh, yeah, eventually for like monetization stream. I'm thinking that because somebody set me a snack box of

13:59.260 --> 14:02.860
Japanese snacks, so I'm gonna do a thigh and hand well mostly a

14:03.580 --> 14:06.940
Well, I'll kind of be like a neck down cam

14:07.820 --> 14:09.820
in cosplay of sheebie

14:10.700 --> 14:12.300
um

14:12.300 --> 14:16.220
And then I'll have like my cat's bed will probably be off to the side so you might see them

14:16.940 --> 14:20.620
Um, I really I've had some Japanese snacks before

14:21.180 --> 14:24.700
So I'm excited to like eat them again because I can't get them often

14:25.500 --> 14:32.540
Well the box it's it's actually sealed. I've actually demonstrated a lot of self control to not eat the Sakura box

14:33.500 --> 14:34.700
like

14:34.700 --> 14:35.820
Oh

14:35.820 --> 14:38.460
I'm tempted to add like another sort of

14:39.020 --> 14:40.700
um

14:40.700 --> 14:44.620
Snack box to my stream I to be I just need to go grocery shopping like

14:45.980 --> 14:51.100
I only grabbed a couple of things when I went out to get some booze and stuff for um the drunk stream

14:52.700 --> 14:54.380
Excuse me

14:54.380 --> 14:55.980
but um

14:55.980 --> 14:57.980
What the heck is all over my desk?

14:58.060 --> 14:59.820
um

14:59.820 --> 15:08.060
So like I'm like I also I was checking my mail today and I was I got a hello fresh offer and I'm like

15:08.780 --> 15:10.780
You know, I'm so busy

15:11.980 --> 15:16.220
I might just do like the hello fresh stuff and then we can have like cooking streams

15:17.660 --> 15:19.660
So I'm excited

15:25.100 --> 15:27.100
I'm sorry

15:27.100 --> 15:29.820
Mom just took somebody out. I was just begging to be stuck

15:31.100 --> 15:34.140
Don't spam chat with your cringe behavior

15:35.500 --> 15:38.140
I don't it is not does not get rewarded

15:39.500 --> 15:41.500
Throne snack box subscription one

15:43.100 --> 15:44.780
Yeah, I'm like

15:44.780 --> 15:49.660
I added some cat trees to my uh throne for the kitty cats because they I only have um

15:50.620 --> 15:54.140
Like these two and they just fight there's like one they really love and they fight over

15:54.540 --> 16:01.020
I also want to get one that's a little bit lower for rena because rena's 14 years old and I don't want her hurting herself jumping up

16:01.100 --> 16:01.900
although

16:01.900 --> 16:03.900
When I came back from

16:03.900 --> 16:05.900
Dropping off like throwing away my trash

16:05.980 --> 16:11.100
Um, I come back in and all my cats are just sitting on the counter staring at me

16:11.900 --> 16:13.900
and I'm just like

16:13.900 --> 16:18.700
Sorry, did I interrupt some sort of cat meeting like what just happened?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.380
Um

16:22.460 --> 16:24.460
But yeah, I

16:25.660 --> 16:30.380
It's like go back to me randomly blowing up on

16:31.100 --> 16:33.100
um

16:33.260 --> 16:35.260
Twitter I

16:36.620 --> 16:41.660
I'm still going to treat it as an alt like it's not gonna be my main

16:41.980 --> 16:46.140
so you're still gonna get like the spicy whatever's and the um

16:46.780 --> 16:51.580
My rambling and silly stuff and then my main will continue to be

16:52.540 --> 16:54.540
just a little bit

16:55.580 --> 16:59.020
More professional, but I still be my goofy self

17:01.740 --> 17:07.660
But yeah, I generally just don't like it. So I'm like trying to funnel the attention to the other girls

17:08.380 --> 17:12.940
I'm feeling very strawny like or I'm like, uh, she's like

17:13.820 --> 17:17.980
Support my daughters. I'm like support my gen mates. Please. I don't want the attention

17:18.940 --> 17:20.780
I don't

17:20.780 --> 17:25.820
I'm like, okay, cool. I'll probably get like a thousand followers after playing with the algorithm. No

17:27.020 --> 17:29.020
um

17:29.180 --> 17:33.180
Yeah, mercy me and mercy. We're both freaking out on discord. We're just like, oh

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
I am not the face of healer that is

17:39.820 --> 17:46.060
Incorrect. I do not want to be the face of healer. That is no, that's all of us. I was gonna say it was strawny. It's all of us

17:46.940 --> 17:48.620
um

17:48.620 --> 17:51.660
Rambling's the best part. Well, no, it's because I

17:52.940 --> 17:54.140
I

17:54.140 --> 18:00.380
Smartly retweeted all the spicy stuff. So when people saw that my viral tweet that I think has like

18:01.340 --> 18:06.700
8k or 16k likes first of all, what the hell? Um

18:07.100 --> 18:12.620
They I was like so they went on my they would go to my page and so they would see all that stuff

18:12.700 --> 18:15.500
And they're like, oh, she actually does what she says. Let me follow

18:16.300 --> 18:19.500
And then I also retreated a bunch of the girl stuff

18:19.580 --> 18:24.140
So they would also get the attention like the algorithm is so weird like what I remember when

18:25.020 --> 18:27.180
We first debuted randomly as Zara's

18:27.660 --> 18:33.340
Um post blew up of her like showing off her voluptuous and delicious body

18:34.060 --> 18:38.940
Um, so like the the algorithm it works in mysterious ways

18:41.260 --> 18:43.260
It's not nice. It's just like I

18:44.780 --> 18:46.780
I want them to succeed

18:47.100 --> 18:51.740
So I am also going to just like strawny do everything in my power to

18:52.300 --> 18:54.300
help them succeed and

18:54.780 --> 19:00.940
I don't even measure success by the numbers. It's really just how people react to me

19:01.740 --> 19:03.740
But I know other people do

19:03.820 --> 19:05.100
sometimes

19:05.100 --> 19:07.100
I got 14 likes gross

19:08.300 --> 19:10.460
So

19:10.460 --> 19:16.780
Like if if it was anybody like if it was one of the other girls this happened to like imi or mercy or azura

19:17.340 --> 19:18.780
Or icy

19:18.780 --> 19:23.180
Or strawny we would all have done the same thing and try to lift each other up

19:23.260 --> 19:29.580
And I know like we we will continue to do so because I we all want each other to be great because we know

19:30.220 --> 19:33.900
We have the potential to be amazing in the vtuber sphere, but um

19:35.580 --> 19:39.340
Yeah, I just think it probably left its intended audience because I don't

19:39.980 --> 19:43.180
I don't wreck it like I don't see any vtuber fans

19:43.900 --> 19:48.940
Following me and I'm like god damn it like and my whole timeline is just normy shit

19:50.700 --> 19:54.380
You saw ic's cute outfit pic. Oh hell. Yeah, I did. She's so adorable

19:54.940 --> 19:57.660
You don't even know how cute ic is. She's literally so cute

19:58.220 --> 20:02.620
Like she's so shown me more outfits and the other girl's more outfits that she likes to wear and I'm like

20:02.700 --> 20:07.980
Oh my god, I just wanted to stick you in my pocket and carry you around like the little small b and you are

20:08.780 --> 20:14.140
She's supposed to be the mesugaki or kusa gaki, but she's just my little princess gaki

20:16.300 --> 20:18.300
That's all I gotta say

20:18.380 --> 20:23.340
What to each breach confinement it did oh you're a vtuber, but like yeah, I don't know

20:23.340 --> 20:27.980
What does a vtuber fan look like? I think maybe I'm just used to following other vtubers. Um

20:28.860 --> 20:35.980
I I remember when I first in another in another realm in another life when I worked at a temple as a priestess. Um

20:37.660 --> 20:40.220
I uh, I think my my

20:41.980 --> 20:43.580
My

20:43.580 --> 20:50.140
viewer base was actually mostly other vtubers. I think so I'm just not used to having like actual

20:51.020 --> 20:53.500
People who like vtubers watch me

20:56.540 --> 20:58.300
So

20:58.300 --> 21:01.580
We're 100 kilograms to use those trail of slime at what?

21:02.620 --> 21:06.620
So you're actually making your nsf, but it's not like it's not like my

21:07.420 --> 21:11.180
My sheevy cotton bomb account is my main like that is

21:11.900 --> 21:15.660
The nsfw is my all and yeah, it's bigger, but it's

21:16.540 --> 21:18.460
you know

21:18.460 --> 21:22.620
I just I don't want all that shit clogging up the average person's feed

21:23.340 --> 21:25.180
um

21:25.180 --> 21:26.540
but uh

21:26.540 --> 21:29.900
Vtuber fans of anime profile pictures cordon

21:32.700 --> 21:34.700
Yeah, that's pretty accurate. Um

21:35.420 --> 21:40.860
But yeah, please if you have discovered me through my alt account on twitter, please consider

21:41.340 --> 21:43.340
I'm looking in my description

21:43.340 --> 21:48.220
In checking out the girls. Um, because they are cooler than I am

21:49.580 --> 21:51.580
And they're better at sticking to kayfabe

21:53.660 --> 21:57.180
Uh, I'm just uh, your dorky girl fell dumb

21:58.380 --> 22:00.380

Where are the gorillas? They're right here, baby girl. Um, all the veeler girls are amazing. Yeah

22:13.340 --> 22:16.460
that seems to uh be the consensus which I'm

22:17.420 --> 22:19.420
happy for like

22:19.420 --> 22:26.540
I know sometimes like I know strawnee's intention was to get someone of every flavor like you would like one person at least out of all of us

22:27.100 --> 22:28.220
but

22:28.220 --> 22:35.340
I definitely like when we all finally got into chat together and we all got on discord. We all did like our mock debuts. I'm like, oh

23:01.020 --> 23:03.020
So i'm very excited

23:03.900 --> 23:06.940
And then I think hold on. Let me look at my schedule. I can't remember

23:08.460 --> 23:11.580
Well, this is too small for me to read. Um

23:15.900 --> 23:19.580
I got strawnee says he's eating sweets from around the world and she got talkies

23:24.140 --> 23:26.700
Okay, oh yes

Yeah, I just like I just want to make friends

23:59.740 --> 24:01.500

I only have two

24:04.620 --> 24:06.540
Rtx friends

24:06.540 --> 24:08.540
And I haven't seen them in like a month

24:09.020 --> 24:11.020

Watch the vods my dear

24:32.700 --> 24:34.700
only

24:34.860 --> 24:39.580
Making friends in an adult impossible. I know like um, it's like

24:41.260 --> 24:42.140
All right

24:42.140 --> 24:44.940
It like I they were my friends from work too

24:45.100 --> 24:48.620
Like I don't know how to make friends outside of that like do I

24:49.260 --> 24:52.620
Go to a mall and be like who wants to be my friend?

24:52.780 --> 24:58.540
So I'm kind of like because I don't have any fucking hobbies that'll introduce me to new people like oh

24:59.260 --> 25:04.940
Uh, yes, I am an equestrian with my riding crop. Ho, ho, ho. Oh wait, that's not the

25:06.060 --> 25:08.700
Right toggle with my riding crop

25:10.700 --> 25:17.260
And uh, I I meet a lot of other equestrians while riding. Yes, uh, but

25:19.580 --> 25:21.580
Hey

25:21.900 --> 25:23.900
But um

25:27.020 --> 25:29.020
Bro, what are you doing?

25:31.580 --> 25:35.180
Boomie, are you okay? You scared the shit out of me

25:39.500 --> 25:41.500
No, so I I'm fine

25:42.460 --> 25:47.420
My um, so I was feeding my cats wet food this morning. So I put them all on their stainless steel bowls

25:48.060 --> 25:55.100
And boomie decided to zoomie and run over one and it flew across the room. So give me one second to go get that

25:56.140 --> 25:58.140
Yeah, it's okay

25:58.460 --> 26:00.460
It's just your brother being stupid

26:01.900 --> 26:03.900
Dude, where the fuck did the bowl go?

26:05.580 --> 26:08.940
Boomie, how did you throw it? He threw it across

26:10.060 --> 26:12.060
But we're like legit across the room

26:17.420 --> 26:24.060
Where are you running with this in your mouth? Boomie's a big cat. So I want to put a pass up for running with this Google

26:25.820 --> 26:29.580
Why did my tv turn on awkward but I don't know how that happened

26:32.060 --> 26:34.060
Um

26:34.140 --> 26:36.540
Classic cat behavior. Yeah

26:38.540 --> 26:42.700
There are still nerdy hobbies to do as adult to find new friends. Yeah, like me too being

26:43.340 --> 26:45.340
This is my hobby

26:46.140 --> 26:49.100
I remember when I was putting together my db sides, they were like

26:49.980 --> 26:51.900
Oh, um

26:51.900 --> 26:58.700

27:27.260 --> 27:31.100
Oh, sorry, I'm drinking tea. It's called throat coat

27:32.700 --> 27:34.460
wink um

27:34.460 --> 27:37.100
But like it's good for throat issues

27:38.460 --> 27:41.660
Because I'm a major fucking yapper. It's been 30 minutes as per usual

27:42.700 --> 27:45.100
and I still haven't started the game and um

27:46.060 --> 27:49.660
But it has licorice root in it and I hate the taste of licorice. Hi, Selma

27:53.260 --> 27:56.540
Oh, yeah, throat coats the bomb. I also have some Ricola next to me

28:01.660 --> 28:06.460
Okay, I also I I'm pretty sure I fixed text to speech in my alerts

28:07.260 --> 28:09.260

Whatchamacallit

What's it called my overlay because it just bothers the crap out of me sometimes

28:59.900 --> 29:02.060
What's the bubble that I can't fit text into?

29:04.460 --> 29:06.460
Wait, are you tallian?

But thank you for 4k

33:24.860 --> 33:28.700
Waiting for youtube to catch up. Um with the monetization stuff

33:30.540 --> 33:35.260
Because we all hit our like the watch hours on debut

33:36.940 --> 33:42.700
But we have to wait like a week to set up the monetization almost like how twitch does um with um

33:44.220 --> 33:47.500
What you ever called all my stuff's gonna get demonetized anyways, but you know, it's whatever

33:50.780 --> 33:54.060
Maybe I just want to hug too bad cry harder

33:55.900 --> 34:01.820
You smell like tea. It's good tea. It's lemon ginger tea with a little bit of like a rich root throat coat

34:06.380 --> 34:10.060
Please don't zoom like that. I'm watching my phone at work. What do you mean like what?

34:10.620 --> 34:16.620
What are you talking about like what wait, do you have your volume turned on?

34:17.580 --> 34:21.180
Oh, oh, oh my god

34:39.100 --> 34:43.900
I'm sorry. I might have been mildly inspired by a certain someone who's like

34:44.460 --> 34:51.340
Who is reacting to someone saying? Oh, I have my um volume up and I'm on a bus because I can't hear that well

34:51.340 --> 34:56.140
And so she started just screaming the most terrible things

34:59.340 --> 35:05.100
Oh streams not gonna survive. Uh, no the stream is gonna survive. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it

35:08.540 --> 35:11.180
I know who you're talking about. Okay. Yeah

35:11.900 --> 35:14.300
I think you're cool or something

35:16.940 --> 35:19.980
Uh, let's you we're doing a new game because we never played before

35:21.100 --> 35:23.100
No mistake

35:23.420 --> 35:25.420
I'm a sociopath

35:26.780 --> 35:31.900
God that sounded evil. Let's rewind a little I grew up all over coastal america

35:32.460 --> 35:34.860
House after house after restraining order

35:35.420 --> 35:41.100
Everything just kind of blends in if the divorce rate is 50 50 my mom landed on tails like eight times

35:41.340 --> 35:44.380
So by the time I was 14, you've never seen this before so we have to watch it

35:44.540 --> 35:48.540
You know and attended six different school districts after a while

35:48.620 --> 35:53.660
You don't see a point in making friends the vitamin c graduation song. Yeah, I can't relate

35:53.740 --> 35:57.980
But then one year all of that almost changed. I'm gonna eat a lozen

35:58.380 --> 36:05.340
I found myself in a school for two consecutive years going on three and then I like started turning three into high school

36:05.580 --> 36:08.060
so the guys hitting on you social leverage was

36:08.220 --> 36:10.220
I've never played ace attorney

36:11.340 --> 36:13.340
I've only ever watched game grumps play it

36:14.380 --> 36:16.380
Like they had always been pretty

36:16.700 --> 36:18.140
never left out

36:18.140 --> 36:20.860
This feels like a viewer debut and when I think about it

36:21.340 --> 36:24.060
All the thinking I never done was when I was alone

36:24.620 --> 36:27.420
I was nice about it and thought I'd always be nice about it

36:27.820 --> 36:30.540
Finally in one place to build a steady reputation

36:31.500 --> 36:36.940
And then life said fuck that my piece of shit gamer brother got us evicted for pirating break beat

36:37.020 --> 36:43.740
Again, I love the piano. I mean not again. This is the first time. Um, the moving boxes and how she reads

36:44.300 --> 36:48.700
We're moving out of state and I just got settled. They said, fuck you. I'm living with

36:48.700 --> 36:52.220
Oh, yeah, game grumps is my and markiplier my my comfort

36:53.260 --> 36:55.260
YouTubers

36:55.340 --> 36:58.540
My second christmas killed himself. I walked in. I usually

36:58.780 --> 37:02.140
look like a whole ass video game just blood everywhere and get this

37:02.380 --> 37:07.900
His suicide note. I usually have them in the background when I'm doing stuff because I can't focus unless I hear noise

37:10.140 --> 37:14.780
I'm Nicole by the way. Hi. What the fuck did I do to him? Maybe I missed the office softball game

37:14.860 --> 37:20.700
Men are so into this revenge suicide house party playthrough. Oh my god. I would love to play house party

37:21.740 --> 37:23.020
I'm moving

37:23.020 --> 37:24.380
again

37:24.380 --> 37:26.220
city county state

37:26.220 --> 37:28.220
all the same fate

37:28.220 --> 37:31.420
Watch gerba. I need to watch gerba because I feel like he's right up my alley

37:36.780 --> 37:41.980
And then I like I just watched Jenna marbles. She's also my comfort youtuber even though she's not a pro anymore

37:48.780 --> 37:53.740
I think I'm trying to remember I think for my senior prank. Oh my god, I can't fucking pause

37:53.740 --> 37:55.740
Yeah, like fuck mr. Brubin a dude

37:56.700 --> 37:58.700
Please

37:59.660 --> 38:01.660
I don't know why they don't let you pause this part

38:02.860 --> 38:05.660
German marbles. Oh my god a collab between them

38:07.100 --> 38:11.260
Wow, yeah, that was funny. Yeah, I'm getting into like humor and stuff. Anyway

38:12.060 --> 38:14.060
Okay, now I can pause uh

38:14.380 --> 38:15.740
so

38:15.740 --> 38:17.740
my school

38:18.300 --> 38:19.740
um

38:19.740 --> 38:21.740
was really weird

38:21.980 --> 38:23.980
and

38:24.780 --> 38:26.540
not

38:26.540 --> 38:28.540
like

38:28.540 --> 38:30.220
creative

38:30.220 --> 38:35.020
like the the apparently the seniors before us like let a pig into the

38:35.740 --> 38:37.740
uh school

38:37.740 --> 38:41.100
The game is full auto. Yeah. I I there's nothing I can do about it

38:42.380 --> 38:44.380
I can

38:44.540 --> 38:46.540
Fuck um

38:47.020 --> 38:51.500
But then what we did for our senior prank was just

38:52.700 --> 38:54.700
Take every chair in the building

38:55.820 --> 38:57.820
And put it in the gymnasium

39:02.540 --> 39:05.660
So like I don't even know how they did that

39:08.140 --> 39:11.820
I think the janitor like let them into the school and like unlock shit for them

39:13.020 --> 39:14.540
and they just

39:14.540 --> 39:15.660
but

39:15.660 --> 39:16.940
And then

39:16.940 --> 39:18.940
Yeah

39:19.180 --> 39:21.740
And then there's a senior skip day where everybody skipped school

39:22.780 --> 39:24.780
um

39:25.340 --> 39:27.340
And I went to school

39:28.220 --> 39:30.220
On senior skip day

39:32.620 --> 39:34.620
Listen, I wasn't cool enough

39:35.260 --> 39:38.220
Well, I was I like like I was growing up

39:38.220 --> 39:42.380
I was the girl so like I've said before like I was a really religious christian girl

39:43.180 --> 39:46.460
So I was uh a target for like um

39:47.820 --> 39:49.820
Upper classmen and stuff

39:51.180 --> 39:52.220
Uh

39:52.220 --> 39:57.100
So I remember like other like the popular senior boys would try to corrupt me

39:58.060 --> 40:02.460
And so they're like, oh you want to come to the beach with us and I was like, uh, no

40:03.100 --> 40:05.100
Because I won I was oblivious

40:05.580 --> 40:07.500

40:07.500 --> 40:10.540
I just wanted I had stuff to do that day, you know, I had to hop on wolf quest

40:13.020 --> 40:15.020

Don't wear your cat's face

40:33.020 --> 40:35.020
What's wolf quest?

40:37.180 --> 40:41.100
Actually, I was thinking more games to play next week. Maybe I might change it to wolf quest

40:41.580 --> 40:45.980
Actually, no, I have to do that the week after because they already made our thumbnails and I feel bad

40:47.100 --> 40:49.100
I'm catholic. I'm so sorry

40:49.260 --> 40:51.260

Like oh make a verse

40:56.540 --> 40:58.140

41:01.900 --> 41:07.020

41:40.860 --> 41:42.860

44:04.620 --> 44:07.180
They're pussies. I'm not afraid to watch someone grovel in pain

44:07.580 --> 44:13.660
Well, they're all just assholes that guy's been making fun of me for like an anime since the sixth grade

44:14.540 --> 44:16.540
Then just stop liking anime

44:16.540 --> 44:21.100
But I can't do that anime is my favorite thing ever my life

44:21.340 --> 44:23.340
The voice acting is so good

44:23.660 --> 44:26.300
In consumption. Are you trying to make anime? I don't get it

44:26.700 --> 44:31.340
Kind of can't interrupt it fan art based on the works of sento takahashi

44:32.380 --> 44:35.660
You know that anime will exist with or without you, right? No

44:36.460 --> 44:42.620
Wait, what do you mean like senti takamoki would have the fucking mean is he wouldn't care. He wouldn't even know

44:43.500 --> 44:47.500
What's your point? How do you give a fuck about anything that doesn't give a fuck about you?

44:47.820 --> 44:49.820
Hey in a translated newsletter

44:49.900 --> 44:56.220
He said thank you to each and every one of his fans. That includes me. Oh, he writes in english

44:56.700 --> 45:02.860
No, his fan club translated into japanese. That's my point. He can't even talk to you. You think he cares about you

45:03.900 --> 45:05.740
Well for the longest time

45:05.740 --> 45:12.380
I wasn't allowed to watch anime because again growing up religious my parents saw like a little majority of anime

45:12.620 --> 45:17.100
has like demonic undertones in terms of like, oh, she's a demon or oh

45:17.660 --> 45:20.300
Magic like I wasn't allowed to read harry potter for the longest time

45:20.860 --> 45:24.540
Then I grew up my dad's like, I don't really give a fuck and I'm like, thank you and I read the first book and I'm like

45:24.540 --> 45:26.540
This is mid as fuck. Are you kidding me?

45:29.260 --> 45:33.660
So I yeah, like I remember I had I said this before in my thank my two point

45:33.740 --> 45:39.500
No, I had to like sneak and watch adult swim and like full metal alchemist on mute and Naruto

45:39.820 --> 45:43.180
You know the first Naruto episode I watched neji neji dying

45:43.500 --> 45:47.100
I was crying at this random anime character. I never formed an attachment to

45:47.900 --> 45:49.900
spoiler neji dies, um

45:52.060 --> 45:55.180
Going super sane to my well, it's funny because my dad watched dragon ball z

45:55.980 --> 45:57.980
so that was fine

45:58.060 --> 46:00.060
so like

46:01.020 --> 46:03.020
Part one or part two, what do you mean?

46:03.820 --> 46:05.820
movies are better

46:06.220 --> 46:08.220
like of of what

46:08.300 --> 46:09.580
Dory mom

46:09.580 --> 46:11.020
No, like

46:11.020 --> 46:18.940
Like I was the type of kid that liked the fantasy and like magic stuff. I wasn't like the slice of life kind

46:19.740 --> 46:25.020
Like so I wasn't like if I was watching like slice of life anime. I think my parents wouldn't have cared

46:25.900 --> 46:28.700
I didn't watch any of that. I didn't want to didn't interest me

46:29.660 --> 46:31.660
I'm like, I want to see people fight each other

46:33.100 --> 46:34.860
What the heck is going on

46:34.860 --> 46:36.620
Chat broke. Oh god

46:36.620 --> 46:38.300
Guys, are you with me?

46:38.300 --> 46:42.380
You still there breathe breathe deeply. Okay. You're still there

46:43.740 --> 46:45.740
I don't watch anime is

46:46.060 --> 46:47.740
You should get on that

46:47.740 --> 46:49.740
the dark raised me um

46:50.940 --> 46:54.860
I always say like I remember my mom was like, oh I hate anime

46:55.100 --> 46:59.980
But I think she only said that because like, you know, it was like the thing to hate anime

47:00.140 --> 47:03.100
But my dad liked it. So I don't fucking get it. Um

47:04.060 --> 47:06.060
It's funny, right?

47:06.540 --> 47:10.380
Like I'm like realizing how much like my parents are like, you can't do this thing

47:10.380 --> 47:12.380
Then they would just go and do that thing

47:15.260 --> 47:17.260
And this is so funny

47:17.900 --> 47:23.500
Um, but then my mom saw kiki's delivery service and she fell in love and I'm like what?

47:25.660 --> 47:29.420
I'm like, like this is about like a witch who does bake like it's a witch mom

47:29.820 --> 47:34.540
Woo, which is the devil and she's just like, but it's cute and then she just ended up not caring

47:35.580 --> 47:39.180
My mom. Yeah, my mom's favorite, um studio ghibli film is

47:40.620 --> 47:42.380
uh

47:42.380 --> 47:46.460
Is a kiki's delivery service and I think my dad's is uh

47:47.980 --> 47:49.820
What is it?

47:49.820 --> 47:51.820
Uh porco rosco, I can't

47:52.620 --> 47:54.620
I

47:57.580 --> 48:00.620
Yeah, porco rosso. I'm like, it's not rosco rosso

48:01.820 --> 48:07.820
Uh, I love toro. I have a lot of toro stuff. Um, I remember I've had like the same toro hoodie for like

48:08.620 --> 48:10.620
I'll like 10 years

48:11.020 --> 48:13.180
How was moving castle is my personal favorite?

48:14.060 --> 48:16.460
I'd rather be a pig than a fascist. Um

48:17.420 --> 48:19.420
Be it was the

48:19.980 --> 48:24.540
So I said my first studio ghibli movie I ever watched was the cat returns and I fell in love with the cat

48:25.420 --> 48:27.420
in the the fun hat

48:27.740 --> 48:31.660
And then I watched how was moving castle and I fell in love with howl really hard

48:32.460 --> 48:36.060
I like especially like christian like christian bail. I don't

48:36.620 --> 48:42.460
Only up until recently like a couple years ago. I didn't know that christian bail voice howl

48:43.420 --> 48:44.540
Oh

48:44.540 --> 48:49.420
And I yeah, how was moving castle is one of my all-time faves tales of mercy is very good. Yes

48:50.620 --> 49:00.060
My first anime's pokemon. I wasn't allowed to play or watch pokemon because um, I remember being at church and they had this like

49:00.780 --> 49:02.060
thing

49:02.060 --> 49:04.060
Where they said like oh

49:04.140 --> 49:06.140
um

49:07.020 --> 49:10.140
Do not be swayed by

49:11.020 --> 49:19.180
The kids these days playing their pokemon because it is pocket monsters aka the devil

49:19.660 --> 49:25.420
They're demons you based off of demons in japanese culture. They're being glorified and kids

49:26.300 --> 49:29.020
Kids media and so I wasn't allowed to

49:29.740 --> 49:31.740
play or watch pokemon

49:32.380 --> 49:34.700
That I stole a pokemon game from gamestop and I never looked back

49:35.260 --> 49:37.260
Uh

49:38.860 --> 49:40.860
Pokemon fire red

49:41.180 --> 49:42.460
My game boy

49:42.460 --> 49:47.980
And then I had um, actually no, I didn't steal from gamestop. I stole it from a kid who brought it to our

49:48.780 --> 49:50.780
my after-school program

49:51.660 --> 49:57.500
So true sister of the claw and um, yeah, they're like, oh, I'll let you borrow this game. I just never gave it back

49:58.060 --> 50:00.060
Yeah

50:00.460 --> 50:06.140
And I yeah, I played the I played a lot of pokemon games since and then I also convinced like my

50:07.180 --> 50:14.780
Relatives to get me like pokemon games. I'm not like the hugest pokemon fan, but I definitely love it like like it a lot

50:16.140 --> 50:20.140
Uh, it was I was definitely it was that and in ton dogs. I played this shit out of

50:21.180 --> 50:23.180
Truly the christian way to play pokemon

50:24.060 --> 50:26.060
Oh

50:26.060 --> 50:28.060
Like so I went to like after school program

50:29.500 --> 50:30.860
After school

50:30.860 --> 50:36.860
And then like we'd all we'd have like a attack day where we could bring in our like ds's and our game boys and all that shit

50:38.220 --> 50:40.220
and um

50:41.180 --> 50:42.460
I would just

50:42.460 --> 50:46.140
So I like and then like I didn't I didn't have a lot of games because I was broke as fuck

50:46.220 --> 50:51.340
I had like my like a wealthier grandparent got me my game boy and my ds

50:51.580 --> 50:53.580
And so I would just steal

50:57.740 --> 51:01.900
But it was yeah after school program after school. Yeah, exactly

51:02.780 --> 51:06.860
That was that that place that place if I didn't go to that place I would be

51:08.140 --> 51:13.340
a social outcast because thankfully that place because my parents worked late

51:14.540 --> 51:15.660
um

51:15.660 --> 51:17.260
Allowed me to

51:17.260 --> 51:21.180
Have some social skills. I'm just happy my mom didn't pull me out of high school

51:21.340 --> 51:24.620
My freshman year because I almost got pulled because she wanted to homeschool me

51:25.260 --> 51:27.420
Because a lot of uh people at my church were doing that

51:28.620 --> 51:30.620
And then I end up with fucking

51:32.700 --> 51:38.140
A girl like emily magie or whatever the fuck in my church who has doesn't know how to talk to people

51:38.300 --> 51:40.300
So I'm happy I didn't turn out like that

51:41.260 --> 51:43.260
I'm only supposed to be caught in me

51:43.820 --> 51:46.940
Ex-homeschooling. Yeah, definitely dodge the bullet especially because I'm an only child

51:47.580 --> 51:49.580
What a fucking sucks man

51:52.060 --> 51:54.060
Early stream it's an early stream baby girl

51:54.620 --> 51:58.860
Okay, you want to stick to getting beat up over children's media? I'll leave you to it. Wait

51:59.740 --> 52:02.460
Oh, yeah, I had the rebellious teen phase my mom fucking hated me

52:03.020 --> 52:08.140
Not many people when you're when you're growing up you always knock heads with your parent of the same gender

52:08.380 --> 52:10.780
And me my mom definitely knocked heads, but

52:11.580 --> 52:12.380
um

52:12.380 --> 52:14.380
I love her to death. She's like

52:14.460 --> 52:18.460
One of the people I look up to the most in my life aside from my dad

52:19.740 --> 52:24.380
My mom's a fucking badass and I thank her every day for putting up the shit. I put her through

52:24.860 --> 52:31.500
Or as nice to me as you are that was nice to you god damn it. Yeah, I'm jeffrey by the way. What's your name?

52:32.460 --> 52:34.460
Uh, nicole

52:34.460 --> 52:35.740
Wow

52:35.740 --> 52:38.060
Okay, bye nicole. Yeah. Yeah, okay

52:38.540 --> 52:42.940
Oh, you look new the lunch line's on the other end there. Huh?

52:43.500 --> 52:48.620
You're trying to find where the lunch line starts, right? You got here a little late. So it's pretty long now

52:49.100 --> 52:53.020
Oh, will she appear on stream? Um, my parents said they do want to come on stream at some point

52:53.100 --> 52:56.540
Where'd you come in from? Probably just like recorded stuff though because they would probably

52:58.300 --> 53:02.700
Docs my whole name address social security number mother's made a name, etc, etc

53:03.500 --> 53:06.380
Or like how can he afford someone to add her all with a jab at the shop?

53:06.460 --> 53:11.420
Yeah, everybody's everybody's stuff is different. I think like girls usually knock heads with their mothers bull cut

53:11.580 --> 53:16.540
That's jeffrey. I don't think he's all there like he's too socially awkward for the normal people

53:16.620 --> 53:18.620
But too smart for the special eddies

53:19.260 --> 53:24.380
Can I sit here? Yeah, sure. All my friends got put in a different lunch period. One day you'll blow up

53:24.780 --> 53:29.180
I'm nicole. I'm gonna be fair. You also had to put up with some shit. That's like all your births

53:29.340 --> 53:31.340
Yeah, you know for jessica avi

53:31.580 --> 53:35.500
That's pretty cool. I'm unpacked that shit in my therapy sessions. So my parents

53:36.620 --> 53:39.820
Even my parents have gotten a lot more lax with that. Like they don't give a shit what I do now

53:41.420 --> 53:45.820
I remember they found my tarot cards. They're just like just don't do it in the house. Like it was fucking drugs

53:46.860 --> 53:48.540
You ready for day two

53:48.540 --> 53:53.260
Is someone gonna kill me day two? If so, absolutely. Why what happened?

53:53.740 --> 53:58.540
Just like waking up in general hurts and I got a deal with my brother who's still up from the night

53:58.540 --> 54:02.780
Oh, yeah, my parents are pretty cool. They're definitely they were surprisingly. They're way

54:03.500 --> 54:07.260
Less strict like 26 other people's parents that I grew up with

54:07.900 --> 54:11.020
I mean, we way less strict like if you thought like, oh your parents have been really strict

54:11.500 --> 54:15.580
Compared to other people's parents. No, I have to tell them that when I'm woken up by loud chewing noises

54:16.140 --> 54:17.820
Is he fat?

54:17.820 --> 54:22.220
Do you know what x bodybuilder is your dad's single my parents are happily married

54:22.780 --> 54:26.460
Well, he's an obese monster. I was just curious if anyone else

54:27.660 --> 54:31.820
Says me. Oh no, I'm hiding all that shit. Let's gossip more at lunch. I gotta get to class

54:32.060 --> 54:36.060
Dude, fuck class. Just skip with me. I told you yesterday if I skip anymore

54:36.140 --> 54:40.060
My mom's gonna start giving me disciplinary tattoos. Oh god

54:42.700 --> 54:45.900
I was largely raised by my grandparents for interactions with my mom and brother's not pleasant

54:46.620 --> 54:49.820
Yeah, truly and it's like they also have their own shit. They have to work through

54:52.060 --> 54:55.420
Huh do they have an upside down pineapple? Oh my god

54:56.300 --> 54:59.340
I only discovered like a couple months ago what that meant. They do not

55:00.060 --> 55:04.380
Okay, we're gonna go we're not going to photography

55:07.020 --> 55:12.220
Look, it's the first day. No funny guys. No comedians. No bring us to the ha ha, okay

55:12.700 --> 55:18.380
This year's gym class isn't last year's gym class. We're gonna really buckle down on physical fitness

55:19.580 --> 55:21.580
I ain't buckling shit

55:22.060 --> 55:25.980
Young lady. What's your name? Nicole. You want my phone number two?

55:26.700 --> 55:30.140
This is only the first class that can bring us up the ha ha ha

55:31.580 --> 55:37.980
No, sorry. Good. Now everybody better dress out every class if you don't it's a zero hit the locker rooms

55:37.980 --> 55:42.620
I'll see you back. I got negative marks so often because I would constantly

55:43.340 --> 55:45.340
forget to

55:46.140 --> 55:48.140
Bring clothes to change into

55:48.380 --> 55:54.140
Showing our education system is pure evil. He's even Mario on a shirt. Talk like a cartoon

55:54.540 --> 56:00.140
What do you mean if I talk like a cartoon I'd go. What's up doc? No, it's just general ha ha

56:00.220 --> 56:04.140
I'm random cartoon channel talk. Have you ever watched television for adults?

56:04.620 --> 56:06.780
What do you mean like porn?

56:10.140 --> 56:13.900
I see that there's only two forms of media to watch porn and cartoons

56:17.740 --> 56:19.340
Uh

56:19.340 --> 56:21.340
Wait, I totally missed what

56:22.300 --> 56:25.340
I like some wild porn here and there probably wouldn't handle it

56:26.300 --> 56:28.860
Actually, I want to see I want to see if he'll tell me what he watches

56:29.660 --> 56:32.060
Most girls just scream and run when I say that

56:32.860 --> 56:34.860
I bet he's gonna talk to me about hentai or something

56:36.060 --> 56:39.020
Well, are you gonna tell me or not? Why do you want to know?

56:39.580 --> 56:47.580
Uh, everybody knows the coolest guys have depraved fetishes. I mean, yeah guys, the coolest guys have depraved fetishes

56:48.460 --> 56:50.620
Uh, uh, all right

56:51.340 --> 56:56.300
See me on lunch today. Maybe we could talk about it then lunch date with jeffree

56:57.180 --> 57:01.100
Finally someone to share my escape is if you talk about vtubers, that would be peak

57:01.180 --> 57:05.740
Yeah, I get lost in all these weird websites to get away from my gun nut stepdad

57:06.220 --> 57:11.180
I think he was in iraq or something doesn't matter anyway. Wait. It was stepdad and you don't

57:11.900 --> 57:13.900
know if he actually served in iraq

57:13.900 --> 57:20.700
That's so that you think like possibly go wrong. What was that? Oh, just I've wanted a chat like this for so long

57:21.820 --> 57:24.940
I wanted a chat like this stares at you for so long

57:31.500 --> 57:33.500
Oh, he would like a zura

57:46.060 --> 57:48.560
Is jeffree base guys jeffree base

57:49.040 --> 57:53.680
Really, uh, is this a is this the average, uh, a zura fan right here?

57:54.640 --> 57:58.960
Huh, you know most people hate when they're taken advantage of no, I mean

57:59.760 --> 58:01.760
Literally walk all over me

58:02.240 --> 58:08.160
Love to be stepped on by a cute tariff feet. Well, hey beat stepping on a scale. Okay, so he's one of my fans too

58:08.320 --> 58:12.560
Unfortunately, most of my fetishes can only be realized through my anime

58:13.120 --> 58:17.520
The realm of the living isn't quite ready for 50 foot tall vixens

58:18.000 --> 58:24.320
Yeah, the real world sucks. We're walking into the jeffree route. Did I mention how I liked girls with cat ears and tails?

58:24.400 --> 58:26.400
What about bunny ears and tails?

58:33.600 --> 58:35.600
Oh my god, are we gonna take jeffree's virginity?

58:36.640 --> 58:41.280
I'm yawing in his virginity if that's if that's a thing. I'm yawing in it. It's mine

58:41.520 --> 58:47.200
I wonder if the library has volume 31 yet. Hey there jeffree. I'm corrupting this anime loser

58:48.240 --> 58:54.000
Oh, hello, jacka. Unfortunately jacka. He used my toothbrush to clean out his new assault rifle

58:54.000 --> 58:56.640
He bought from china. How much up much?

58:57.280 --> 59:01.120
Anyway, could you find another card? He's been revoked. Sorry, but I can't anymore

59:01.600 --> 59:06.960
My mom's been wondering where all my lunch money's been going. Oh, you mean you don't like me anymore

59:07.360 --> 59:13.040
Again, I'm sorry. I just don't know. Maybe I should grow 40 feet. Then you don't really like me

59:13.120 --> 59:15.120
She told other people

59:16.400 --> 59:21.520
Maybe if you took your shoes off and stepped on his face. Oh, no. Oh, no

59:25.440 --> 59:29.600
Oh, he's going to do something to the school

59:31.120 --> 59:34.720
Oh, yeah, they're kids with the popped up kids

59:34.880 --> 59:38.400
Yes, come on. We'll make us purrs. I can't believe this

59:41.040 --> 59:46.400
Uh, I was actually very nice to the jeffree in my school because

59:47.600 --> 59:49.600
Well, all along the notes flattering

59:49.760 --> 59:55.120
Literally batch it crazy. Like he wasn't like he was nerdy, but he was also like

59:56.400 --> 59:58.400
Like I'm not even joking. He was crazy

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.840
Uh, like he would have definitely

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.120
Done bad things

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.720
And I remember even it was like that

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.880
thing

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.880
He even told me one time

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.120
Like thank you. Like you've like a really good friend of mine and that again

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.240
I was just doing the bare minimum of kindness because I'm I'm gonna be kind to anyone

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.440
I'm not it's really hard for me to dislike someone and as someone who was bullied

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.440
I just did not bully other people

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.200
And he was like, you know, you're one of the good ones and I'm like, oh, thanks redacted and he's like, yeah

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:38.240
If I did that, you know that joke of like coming to school with stuff like I definitely like warned you first and I was like

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.680
What

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.080
What do you mean

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.880
And he's like, haha, don't worry about it. And then he just like walked away

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.600
And then so I used to work at um

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.840
I used to work at game stop for for a bit

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.560
Sadly I didn't have any stock in their company

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.560
But and then he like came in looking for oh, but I will give you stories about when I worked at game stop

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.160
Don't you worry about that?

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.160
um, and he came in and

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.160
It was like really late like we were about to close and he was like, oh my god redacted

Chibi, it's so good to see you and I'm like, oh, hey redacted

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.680
And then he's like, oh like it's like that's in a caught up with him or whatever

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.800
and then um

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.760
He was like, oh, I want to show you something and then he just

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.880
Started showing me hentai on his phone

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:46.960
And I look at my manager who he also happened to be friends with and no and mind you my manager was a jeffrey

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.920
down to the core

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.840
And he's like as long as you can't see it in the cameras and I'm like

What the fuck is that fishing game called? That's super popular

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.000
Not compelling. That's the hunting game. But um

Oh, thank you. I was really just because he prefers alternative forms of sexual intercourse does not mean he should be ridiculed

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.320
Sorry

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.240
What do you mean by

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.120
alternative

01:05:53.120 --> 01:06:00.480
Oh god jeffrey here prefers to be stepped on by women who look like cats as opposed to standard intercourse with a human woman

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.200
Oh my god, this stop. I feel so bad

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.920
You did this

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.440
Did what?

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.320
Told everyone my darkest secret. Oh, he's killing me first. That was in confidence

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:22.560
I was hoping we would just like sorry give him a nice lay. I feel bad

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.920
I haven't touched my manga in forever

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.640
Not even cartoons entertain me anymore. Oh, he's like talking normal

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Do you even care?

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:39.440
Do the results of your actions mean anything to you? I'm very scared when they affect me. Sure

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:46.240
No one in the realm of the living ever liked me anyway. Oh, no, I feel really bad

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.480
Damn it, Nicole

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.840
Because you're gonna fucking shake me

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.160
No, jeffrey don't do it jeffrey you're based your tastes. You're so based bro

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Don't do it home slice

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.600
Don't kill yourself. You're so sexy

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.840
Girl hormones make me feel guilty

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.720
call his bluff

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.920
Well, I'm I'm getting guilty because I feel like he would actually do it

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.560
I mean, you don't have to kill yourself over this. Do you?

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.680
In the realm of the living I am nothing more than a punchline for others amusement

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.320
This is not the purpose I desired

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.200
Well, what is

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.360
I don't know

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.360
So if you die now, you'll never know

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.600
Don't try to talk me out of yeah, if I call this bluff. He probably would have shot up the school

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.760
What are you fool? He thought of the oldest cause never get in the land war between

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.840
Eight that's the end of the world. What's the line ever get? I literally love the princess bride so much

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:08.960
So you want more than missionary big deal? Okay, so it's not the end of the world. It's still the end of my social life

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.200
Jeffrey what social life all you did was repeating the sweetheart location stop it

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.320
Stop it

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.680
So what's the problem seems like everything's going according to plan

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.960
You know

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.880
You're right

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:34.240
The only thing that's different is everyone knows when you learn like not to care what other people think it's literally life changing

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.080
They just assumed it

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.080
Gosh, thanks, Nicole

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.880
I'm a woman. So I still care about what people think but you know

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.880
When you mostly stop caring about people

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.440
Company this is what empathy gets you

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.120
Come on, I just wanted to sleep with Jeffrey

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.120
I

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.200
Nicole I'm trying to make a depression playlist on itunes. What is it? Well nothing really?

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:11.120
I'm just wondering why you've been so exhausted lately. I'm depressed mom mom. You're being nice, right?

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:17.360
Trying to get along. Yeah, and I'm pretty sure that's my problem never putting up a fight never telling men

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.360
I'm not their emotional wheelchair

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.600
Well, sweetie, I'm not sure if being confrontational is the key to happiness

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.400
Your beautiful girl don't have an ugly personality personality towards anyone

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.800
So I should like spread myself thin. I don't care what others think or say part of the perk of being a nerd

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.800
Being a virgin all I'm saying is and having hot girls try to steal your chance

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.080
What if they're bad people? I don't believe anyone being inherently bad

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.800
Yeah, I guess the pedophiles trying to abduct me on my space or just misunderstood

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.400
I remember I tried making a mind space when I was like 10

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.280
My dad was like no the connections you start early come in handy later

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.760
Although I was on guy online when I was 10. That was a bad idea

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.440
Fine

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.400
Thank you. I promise it'll pay off

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
He just becomes Jeff the killer

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.760
Okay, whatever now my mom's addicted to heroin again

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.720
Oh, shit. Well, that sucks. I thought everyone would just forget about the hangout promises

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.480
I made over the winter the thing where you tell them you're really busy for midterms

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.800
But should have time in the spring. Yeah, I thought most of them would just forget not when you're hot

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.520
They never forget when you're hot. I'm hot. You fish by the classic

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:43.280
I mean when I was 30 making a mind space my dad said no because I'm 56

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.840
Park or the diner. What kind of Mormon ass bitch meets at a diner

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240
They all play together couldn't tell you

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.400
Worst part is I'm at this point where I'm too nice to even decline the follow-up hangers. Hey, let's do this again

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.680
Maybe next week same time. Yeah, so now it's the bullshit

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.040
I put up with on break combined with the bullshit I put up with at school

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.360
Really makes you question the whole point of nice. I love guy. I asked you about their economy

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.800
When shit socializing honestly kind of sucks now

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.760
And nobody plays the game anymore. Yeah, I like logs into my old account

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:22.720
Oh my god, you're bad and um, that's like church girl. Nice. I went to like the racing place and like other places

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.760
Like like nobody's there. He'll just stalk me. I'll be so cynical. I'll probably just murder you

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:32.160
Dying would be awesome right now, but I feel like there'd be strings attached with him

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.560
You're dead. What could he possibly do your body is disappear when you die

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.160
So whatever his twisted little anime brain wants. Oh, okay

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.640
But if he actually killed you could I take your body to attack the dermis be pretty sick

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:51.440
Good to know. Hell yeah, we're all on the same page. Did you end up on habo? I like I think when I played habo hotel like once

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.760
I mostly stuck to gaya and neopets

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.440
And wet paint and real players guilt. It's just been wild crazy. That's the fourth time you said that

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.520
Oh, uh

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.880
Pretty sweet. Your mom's out of town. You could throw a whole party, right?

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.120
Are you gonna throw a party people enough to let them destroy my house? Then yeah, absolutely

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.480
Oh, man, don't be a downer. Do you kind of remind me of this one girl from a local punk band around here?

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.360
She kind of gets a penguin. Hell yeah, I was

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.000
You want to this fucked up shit I used to do so

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.760
I usually like

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.120
Uh, I growing up. I don't know why I did this, but I posed as a boy

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.960
on

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.960
a club penguin

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.080
I remember I

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.680
posed as a as a boy and I was like my name's kyle

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.400
and then

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400
I made another account

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.600
Called sky and she was my sister

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.000
So I

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.920
kyler

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.520
so I would

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.600
Switch between the accounts

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.800
And I would pretend to be a bro to the people I played with and then I would switch to be a girl

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.760
And they would tell me they have a crush on my sister aka me

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.120
and then

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:29.280
I was so but like I was like, I don't even know how old it was doing that. I would I lark to siblings often

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.880
I guess I was just so manhara as a child and I really wish I had a sibling that I could

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.080
fuck people over with because even you know when I played counter strike

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.360
I I put like because I could do my guy voice

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:49.360
And then I would say oh you want to hear my like my sister wants to play and then I'd switch to my normal voice and then people

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:59.600
People would believe it because you know mics back then were terrible. There's two wolves inside me my two fake siblings

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.680
A

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.040
Two fake the girl and boy siblings the the and the andy and the

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.480
Andy and ashley. Oh my fucking god. They were literally andy and ashley

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.560
Not the realization is bro still single. I don't know

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080
Bro, I was crazy as fuck like

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.000
like

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.720
When I was a kid, no, I'm not gonna get it. I'll have to get into that and like a zassi stream just like

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.280
my tulpas

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.800
We should play that. Oh, I've already I've actually already played through confident mandy and lele

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.320
But I'm totally be down to play it again. And then the next episode come comes out

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.360
Back when I was a priestess

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.640
She does something soon of her did uh, she does something soon of her. She's something similar. I'm not surprised

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.840
She'd be your ways to indulge your sister for a corner

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.240
Leave me alone

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:08.080
People were people were like I thought she was based because of how I responded to a marrow when it's real life

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.160
I just don't like it. I'm sorry

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.400
Previews for episode three. Oh, I haven't even seen the previews

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.440
Uh, emmy's playing coffin of andy and lele today, isn't she?

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.040
So you guys will have a little treat you guys will get a little treat you want to treat you want to treat

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.200
You know a little treat then

I also really like to take her in kairu

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.080
for more in high school

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.760
Uh

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.960
So the fanfic turn out. Why did you retract that?

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.400

You're fucking with me. Are you serious?

SCPs. Oh, yeah, that'd be cool

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.040
Thing just more like the band makes her image that

You're actually really pretty

I know pretty and like pretty cool, too

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.360
You taste music. It's like it's like nothing I've ever heard before you really know your stuff

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320
No, I don't I had Sean Kingston

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320
Oh

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.760
You're different

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.600
I'm not having sex with you an actual name. Yes talking about fucking you was like the last thing very correct

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:49.040
You've worn the same volcom socks for like two weeks. I'm looking to fight strong guys. I heard imperial germany is pretty

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.360
It's cool if it is

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.840
Why are we at davin busters? Yeah, it might seem crowded now, but you should see this place

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.840
Am I just like speed dating everybody? I said you should see this place on friday. It's friday. Okay

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.360
You see me at the hoops machine. I'm sick. You couldn't keep up. I like she's like actually

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:17.440
Hanging out with everybody 17 after all and the ski ball suicidal pregnancy. Don't take it too hard

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:24.640
I make everyone look trash at it. All of this. I don't mind davin busters. All right. Yeah, tell the pussy ass bitches to suck my dick

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.840
I think I should start making rap songs. My dad is a mac book

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.400
I love it

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:41.920
Poor speedrun, but yeah season four not really for me personally. How about you? Sorry season four of what now the doki-dice-ki anime

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:48.000
You've been paying attention right to the first three seasons or are you talking for the last 20 minutes?

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.360
Actually, it's the same answer for both. Yeah, I know

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.840
What were the writers thinking?

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.960
I'm actually involved with an online group and we're gonna reanimate

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.880
Come on, you won't let me take this boy's virginity like a whole hand it over

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.320
Yeah, let me corrupt this little nerd use all the help we could get

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.680
I guess animation takes a lot of time, right?

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.800
At least we don't have time to stream with audio. That's actually audible. Actually, we haven't found an

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.480
Is that supposed to mean yeah, but one of our friend's cousins might do it after he graduates from media school

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.680
You turn Nicole into a pushover. I really fucking did. Yeah, just for the love of the show

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.680
Well, honestly, it's good for her because she needs more friends and they're open. Why not her?

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.600
There's no difference whether I join or not join because this will never be made

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.320
Well, if you feel that way

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.160
Do you know why it's so hard to find animators? I don't know why the fuck I'm here

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:41.920
I even had to pay for my own shitty cheeseburger. I'm gonna start telling men. I'm vegan so they stop trying to take me places

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360
That's pretty pretty good strat

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:51.360
But yeah, Kelly's a fucking whore and I hope she dies end of discussion. Goddamn. I'm not opposed to that stance. How about you, Nicole?

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:59.520
Nicole, huh? Oh, sorry. I'm the exhausted somehow socially burnt out like her

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.920
Poor new kid. It's like, you know, they want to fuck but they won't just ask so you can reject them

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.560
I know right like you guys

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:15.760
Are made to serve me and you know, make me my food and buy me my food. Thank you for reminding me

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:21.360
About it. Let's just enjoy your cancerous meatloaf in peace. I'm sorry

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.560
Oh, Nicole. What's up? Who's still on for tonight? Fucking chrisbin

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.480
Why is it all guys? Why am I not hanging out with girls?

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.760
Cole concert's gonna be sick with you there. The government is bad that concert was tonight

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:43.200
You are exhausted. I was playing literal. No bodies. Just cover bands. You can say no. Oh my god

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.560
To say no

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.400
Yeah, someone told me they saw you at a place with that weird japan kid. Japan kid

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.200
Well, you actually went through with that. You need to have some kind of limit

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.840
How can I rank who and who not to hang out with when they're all equally shitty to me?

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.880
Just are you suicidal? Don't hang out with anyone. Just hang out with the girls

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.920
Seriously though. Yes. Why would that cell be rubby?

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.080
Same. Open your mouth. Don't let them stick your feet in there.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.640
Maybe you should just blow off that concert. I won't hear the end of it

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.160
It's facts. Can't please everyone.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.880
Also facts. Good strat. Uh, I'm gonna stay home and kill myself

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.480
I think that's a pretty good idea

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:39.120
I like she's like I'm going zero to a hundred. I don't want to go to a concert. I'm gonna kill myself

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.880
Say no, whatever. I want to die. It doesn't matter how

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.640
I don't understand

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.160
Oh my god, she went through it with that

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.280
What did I even do what did she do?

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.560
My daughter attempted suicide. There's blood everywhere, police said

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.560
Did the old slice and dice?

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.040
My 13th reason oh my god, like happy happy

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:28.480
13 reasons why I was so fucked up. I actually I like the book was good. I didn't like seeing it in person

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:35.840
Mom had me locked up in a mental ward until my 18th birthday. So I learned what crazy pills actually do to you

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.560
They don't make anyone happier

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.640
Just more content with limbo

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.320
What sucks worse than killing yourself is fucking up. Can't wait to get fainzily because I just want to bang people and I can't

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.320
Bang anybody in this game shot for eternity

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960
You're just really awkward to hang out with

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.480
Can't wait to play hoonipop. Oh

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.760
We were playing hoonipop so fast those games. I've been sitting

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:05.120
Covered in dust in my steam library for years. I have never I've seen gameplay. I know the premise

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.440
I have never played the game myself though. I bought them. I bought

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.640
I literally I think I bought every hoonipop game because they're on sale

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.640
All right

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.280
Make

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280
Yeah, I'm I'm speedrunning everything

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.040
We're gonna cut close this time

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:32.160
Well, wait most I've ever met would mean you stand out in some way. You're a very run-of-the-mill waste of time

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:36.720
I was at the first ending. I went to some street. It's the first time we played it

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.160
I don't want you to talk about us first you wear classic rock t-shirts from walmart

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.000
Remember to play it uncensored and cover it with stream overlay and then fail a few times

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:49.520
Well, if it's on fans, it's gonna be uncensored. Cool rapid fire of assumptions. Tell me if I get any wrong

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.120
I'm not gonna like

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.000
Fuck around that. Take pictures of your skin. I know like mostly. I know the girls just want to get our fans

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
These so that we can play

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.880
naughty games

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.560
Well

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.360
All right, I'll see you later then. I also call it honey pop

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.600
Hey, I've seen your ass around here before honey pop. It's my first day. Are you sure about that?

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.880
Whatever all you hot girls look to say. Yeah, I think maybe that's what I got it

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.320
What it was like gotta be really really cutting under this school security

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.120
It's a lot of air. I've actually never played energy games to be honest. Are you bad bitch or what?

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:27.200
I'm an abysmal bitch like the closest thing I got to playing energy games was like really bad cheerleading

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.940
Doesn't visual novels without tommy games

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.760
Last season we went seven and five like above 500 not bad. It's my life pretty much

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:42.240
How can you make lacrosse your life? There's no pro league for it. Is there is there? Well, I'm sure they're out there

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.040
Besides we only lost like five games because I fucked my knee up and couldn't play the rest of the season

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.280
It's pretty bad ass because they keep giving me percussa. Cool. Seriously. How much my younger self would be horrified

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.400
Elephant I got them right here. You want to do it with me? They only know I think my younger self would be like damn

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400
You are cool as fuck

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360
Are we popping them perks?

Pop them pop. All right, we pop perks free percusset. Hell. Yeah, hand it over

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.920
This is actually my mexican cartel supply, but it probably won't kill you

My feet feel great. I could fall asleep standing right now. Yeah, I told you it was good shit

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:42.080
I'm sorry. Are we lost? Both of you should be in class. This isn't a skip. Why do we just like have it sell out?

Well, you're in the model train fan club. You freak. I'm not in the model train fan club

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:34.000
I just sponsored the model train fan club. That's even worse. No snitching. You look new here. I'm not sure what you think you're doing

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.760
If I can assure you it won't last long. A bitch can't pop perks here. What the fuck? What if I have glaucoma?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
But you don't have glaucoma and you just confessed to drug use on school grounds. Come with me both of you

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.880

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.240
Honey their background sound. Yeah, it's fucking AC. A two-day suspension on the first day of school

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.960
It was like one pill. He's just mad. I made him feel insecure. So he threw the book at me

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:05.280
Look, I know you're acting out because of your father mom. Literally. No one ever has actively thought I'm gonna act out today

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.400
What does that even mean? I'm gonna look like disrespecting my parents

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.960
This is a world you and everyone who crochet is created. She kind of has a point with that, bob

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.680
You kind of need to get a fucking job. You're 26

I told you the economy's bad blame bush and these girls I chat with online fully agree

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:28.400
Mom still I can't believe you're taking the school side with this. It's totally against all my citizen rights

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:33.440
They had you sign something that waves those rights. You're 16. You don't even have rights

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:39.440
Well, you do right through the school or something. You're at the only public school for miles and miles

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:43.840
What happens if you're gone for good, huh? I'm not moving again. I'm not paying for private school

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.920
And I'm definitely not home

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.480
Fine, I won't blow it then. I won't squeal a bit

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.200
I was your dream. I saw your friends in Dallas, but I won't say a word because we got to stay in this shithole

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:58.240
Good. I'm glad we understand each other mom. I could just get assaulted. You wouldn't care

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:03.600
You've been pulling the sexual assault card since you were 12 hasn't happened yet. Has it Jesus Christ

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.040
Point well, you can figure out a new excuse locked in your bedroom for the next two days

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:12.480
Fine. I have my own computer grounding doesn't do shit anymore

You're gonna be seriously failing now

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.880
Seriously, you may fail. Those boys don't even go together. You sound like an idiot

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.080
Look, I'm just recording a little voice message for this hottie I met online that I'm done, okay?

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.560
This is like the fifth hottie in two days. Do you know how old any of these girls are? Yikes

Like legal in her country. Don't worry about it. Oh my god. This is bad

Do I help my brother groom a girl or do

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.160
Or do I allow him and get him to jail or do I just distract him?

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.800
Why do you want me to help him?

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:49.840
Don't joke about it if you have to delete this one too. I don't know what you're talking about

Definitely a certified lover boy. Yeah, we're gonna distract him. Hey, why don't you go have some cheetos and play xbox big bro?

No, he's not gay. I also like me

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.680
And then can he like

Don't top. I don't know what really works. Oh, so he's like really in the video games

He begged a 15 year old for naked pictures. Oh my god. He's that guy. Can we report our brother?

I don't want to go to the dark room

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.080

I always don't. I don't want to get claimed

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.640
Why was he taken a while?

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.000
Hi booby. Hi, it's your boy. What's up?

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.800
Hello, how do you do it?

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.320
Who'd you make that for all you two folks? We call him Bayman

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:18.480
I also call him Mr. Titties because he has a big power show with boobs. He'll probably see it on the cat ham

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.200
Hi, hi cat. Oh, you're so snuggly

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.320

Okay, everybody's so far saying no, it's 50-50. Are you serious? Okay

Never talk to the dude hangs around in girls toilets. What do you mean?

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.120
You want to talk to a dude that hangs around in girls toilets? You just, you know, try to be friends

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.480
Oh, your boyfriend can't let you go friends

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.480
I

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.440
Love this teapot so fucking much you guys don't have any idea

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.520
Best thing ever

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.920
Teas of microwaving it

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.960
And my British fans don't hate me as much

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.920
You get like little coasters

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:31.600
You can actually hear all of that. Well, yeah, because my house is small and it's an open concept apartment

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.200
My kitchen is literally like 10 feet away

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:48.640
Wait, did you I usually microwave tea but some lovely uh, subby Wubby some lovely member of the harem um got me a

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.200

Because they're like stop and I was like, all right

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.840

Okay, wait, I walked away. It was no and I come back and it's yes

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.520

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.920

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.920

You see the ASMR when Nicole who's he paws support over if he he interests his voice like what?

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.400

Uh, she beneath audio is great

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:36.560
Yes guidance counselor, let's talk it up. Hey, come on. No need for the jokes splitting hairs in the pool

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.720
Oh, yeah, I'm gentle. I don't know what jealous, but

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:43.280
It's because I'm American face and stuff

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.880
Although my mom like I had a girl having to cut all the entire time because my mom really likes tea

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.640
My mom is like very British despite not being British although we are of English

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.640
So my mom is English

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.400
She's like I want to be English person

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.840
In a good way people don't understand me like this girl

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:05.360
She can't do a first act though a pop punk and was like I thought punk was anti-pop like she didn't understand

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.880
I would have told you the same thing pop punks for boring suburban kids

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.440
I used to love listening to pop goes punk like I feel like no one at my favorite cover is boyfriends

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:18.320
By issues when they covered just a fever

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.280
I don't know. There's got to be more out there

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:25.840
Or a lollipop by a single thing. I can't handle the conversation

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.360
Why is the principal so hot like she looks like a new pop character

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.720
Crispin's been sending out pictures of his junk to every girl in school. That's not how I heard it

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.560
I thought it was just one girl and then she sent it to everyone

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.440
Who was it then? Tell me chrisbin gonna kill me

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.400
This is a the new girl nicole

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:12.720
Sexually harassing our new students. You're in big trouble. Mr. He thought she was gonna look like it was gonna defend her

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.840
Oh, fuck nicole. Call the teacher from honeybob. We need to talk about oh god

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.760
Not you too your principal called and told me there was a problem at school

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.440
A boy sent you some unsolicited pictures mom. This is gross. I'm not talking about it with you

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:32.960
You were forced to look at sexual imagery nicole the child psychologist say that can really stunt development

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.520
Every day I'm thankful the principal's fat titty. So like I never worked again

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.440
I didn't have any friends. I was a loser. So I never had to go through something like that

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:50.240
She views literally jesse who knew pop. I'm apparently so I've been compared to her before

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:55.680
Especially just like it looks because we do look very similar. Um, I feel like she would wear my outfit

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.520
But like I've had like uh

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.560
classmates who receive that stuff

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.840
and

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.160
I like they were like, oh, I got this from this person and I'm like, what does that mean?

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.800
They're like, but you don't know what that is shows picture of me

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:23.120
Like this also, um, one of the girls and one of my classmates growing up her mom was a porn star

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.840
And we all found out in high school because

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:37.600
And I'm not fucking joking her boyfriend at the time found a video

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.120
Of the mom I'm born

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:51.280
And spread it to the school and she was gone like this and the girl is sweet too. She's sweet like her daughter

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:54.720
And she was gone for like a month. She did not show up

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:56.960
And then I remember

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.360
She told me or like told some girl that told me or whatever the fuck because I just like knew everything

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:05.120
People would just tell me stuff because I was quiet and I'm a good listener

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
and she told me uh

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:13.520
That oh and her mom is hot though. Like her mom was hot. Um, and she drove a really nice car

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:18.240
I like I didn't see the video, but I I saw like the mom like drop her off. Um

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.440
Yeah, Amy and chat

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.560
Amy's also going crazy with the rest of you. Um, and she

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:33.200
Said that she walked in at her parent and not her parents like her mom and some random guy and it was like

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:40.960
Her parents had had this agreement. I don't know the video. I never saw them. Why would I shit? I don't even remember the mom's name

01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:48.960
That's fucked. I would never do that the hell but yeah, it's just like that's why I kind of feel bad for

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.640
Some kids growing up and like the only fans era where every girl

01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.800
Excuse me is doing only fans especially like some like moms trying to make ends meet

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:04.560
Are their kids because then it just like gets spread to the kids

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.280
And it just saw I just feel bad for them

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.160
But then like I know why the moms are doing it because they're trying to you know

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.600
Make money to live, but then I'm like, oh

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:18.320
Honey needs to go to therapy that the little baby needs to go to therapy

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.240
Lisa's pay wall. Yeah

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.160
It's gonna do you sold images and we're gonna go to the machine friend. Yeah

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:31.360
Yeah, it's like some people it could be fun. Yeah, like one of my um

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.560
Uh close like church friends growing up

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:41.360
And I didn't know like a lot of the girls in my church were like leading double lives because I was a little good at mischievous and um

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.960
Her stuff got spread

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.080
and

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.880
She got excommunicated because of it and I was

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:53.280
Really heartbroken because she was like my closest friend because she was like a little bit normal

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.920
Um

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:58.800
And I never was able to talk to her again

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:03.200
I stumbled across her like her her page at one point

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.440
And seeing where she was at and I gave a little high but like yeah

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:14.240
Yeah, it was like like that shit ruins lives and like none of the the boys that spread it

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.080
um

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.080
Got in trouble only she did

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.080
Because they were like, oh you harlots

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:22.480
get got

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.200
And they like interrogated her deeply about like what she sent. So the fucking

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.640
pastors or freaks too

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:33.520
That's another reason I left

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.960
All over the goddamn place. This isn't about her. Oh, yeah, no, they're and they're still fine to this day guys

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.520
This was very serious

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.720
Uh

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.040
Exaggerate trauma with pity. Oh hell yeah

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:55.040
Mom I really don't know give me some pretty gifts mom. Oh sweetie. What happened? It's okay. You can tell me

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:09.040
But never to me like I had a fairly normal childhood minus like having

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.200
religious stuff

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.200
like I wanted to school

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.440

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:25.440
You know, I went through depression like everybody and their mom does lately

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.120
um

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.440
Because the meadow ill in the way runs in my family

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.840

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.720
Well, the next day at school he was way too confident with me. He's just pinning me against the locker and

Oh, this is the hardest part of being a mom. I swear. I'm sorry. I'm a disappointment mom

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:29.520
I'd want a daughter who gets a's on math tests instead of d's to the face

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:34.320
Okay, is there any way I can make this better anything at all

I'm on the assisted income lunch plan. So they knew she couldn't afford a lawyer

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:29.280

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:32.320
Sort of god, I can never be satisfied

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.640
