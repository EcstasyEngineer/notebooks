You
You know, you know what I forgot to do? I forgot to actually copy and paste the Fuji Tech model in
I was like, okay, but you will see amazing this and just a moment and just mere moments you will witness the majesty that
That Toma made me into you are not ready tarnished. You are not ready
Hey
Hey, what's up hold on let me put my helmet on for this
I think I need to make it big. Oh God, I don't think this is gonna work. I have I was ready to tape this on my head
Tape it to my boobs, that's a good idea actually
There you go, I'll put one on each tit
But look hold on let me just throw this off to the side real quick look at the amazingness
That Toma did today look
We were just in call hanging out in Chattin
And I'm like I'm like oh my come my my
My model is really lagging while trying to run the game. She's like I got you
And I was like I'm about to draw myself as a like a little like stick figure puppet thing
She's like bet and then she's like no I got you and then I
watched an amazement as she quickly whipped me up into a
perfect muppet version of myself
And it is I am you guys don't understand how happy I am
And yeah, she had a little thing with the pinky out cuz I'm fancy I'm a lady and
The stick was a great touch in my little nails and I just please I have
Tomas twitch and my pinned please give her a follow. She loves doing drawing streams. She loves doodling
She loves watching cartoons. She loves playing games
With her audience. She is one of the most wholesome comfy streamers
I have ever met and I'm so thankful to call her my friend
Because she envisioned me in the most beautiful way my true form
Rise tarnish, so I'm gonna be over here
Let me make myself a little bit smaller so you can see my wonderful little hand holding me up
And a little eyebrows, I'm gonna put this put this helmet on my my booba
We'll do one and then
I'll do how the heck do I duplicate
Let me duplicate copy
Paste
Yeah
Thank you, I feel I feel I just feel so alive
Are we I just feel
Like I'm my true self in this this form
Uh
I I showed off
my Muppet form in the discord and my
Management just responded with just five nights at Friday's music
I'm protected where it counts, you know, I have the highest level of armor, you know, okay, I need to
Set things up a little bit more properly. Hold on. This is gonna be loud for you guys. Let me turn that down
Okay
Oh my glorious day, I am so happy to be alive. I'm so glad to be here
I'm a fucking Muppet ladies and gentlemen
Um, but yes, I am a Muppet because this outlandering really taxes my pc
So I thought it would be a good idea. I was gonna whip up
Um, a PNG batoma came in clutch
Um, we're going I don't know if I'm going to try to speed run
To get to the dlc. I'll be honest with you. I highly doubt that I can do that
So what I'm thinking and this has been a goal of mine
Elden ring is near and dear to my heart
I think I should make Elden ring a running series and this will be the game the the souls like I beat on stream
Maybe I don't know
Honestly, I'm quite embarrassed to
Play this game because I'm not good at souls likes. I enjoy them a lot. I'm not good at them though
um
but
I love this game a lot like that's why I named one of my fucking cats after one of the characters
I was when I was
In such a dark place when this game came out and this game brought me back to the light
I I rose as tarnished. I became the Elden Lord
Actually, I became Lord of the frenzy flame in my ending that I you know beat the game in but it's whatever
um
I've seen the cart bot animations of elderly. I have not helped look that up
I remember pouring over the lore pouring over the builds because I'd never like played a game of scaling before like a all that stuff
And I realized how much I enjoyed it
um
I always like to the guidance of grace. Yes. I always used to like sing to myself
While playing elderly ring reach out and touch grace
Um, yes, I'm a muppet
But
Yeah, we'll try I want to try it would be cool to beat this again. I play
I'm not like scrawny. I don't beat games in like a short amount of time
I take a very long time like she just like a hundred percented assassins created like two days. I I can't
I think when I played and beat the game I had like 200 out. No
Was it 200 hours? I don't know
Because I like to explore
I know there's even so much more that I haven't even found yet and I've been all over the place
I'm debating whether or not to do some like cheesing in terms of like, um
Getting extra runes and shit
Uh, or just like really going for it
Getting all the bells took you 200 out. Oh, you got all the bell. I did not bother with that
What is the shiba model? What do you mean? This is I don't look any different. I'm the same
Sorry, I need this so it's fine if you want to as well. I yeah, because normally, you know, I'd like go to caled
Kill that dragon that's already kind of half dead get the runes level up
Um, but I kind of just want to go on a little trip with you guys, you know
Just want to go on a little trip. I think I want to go on this adventure together
Wait, where did obs go? It just disappeared as I was talking
I'm wondering if I should eat something before I start
Episode of Muppets is this it's the banned one
It's
Fun to pull the cradle
It's on pc. Yes. I have beat uh, so I've never played elden ring on pc. I've only played it on my playstation
um
Maybe wise if you're gonna go for a while, you know, yeah
I was so caught up chatting and having fun watching toma draw my lovely
My true form that I forgot to have a snack. So I'm gonna grab some snackies and a drink
So fun
Reina's doing well everybody
Right reina
She has been snuggling with me all that's fine
You're such a speedy gal
Where's my water?
Uh, I appreciate you guys for
uh
Understanding they'd be canceling and stuff like on us to be honest with you. I hate canceling and postponing things
um
Because like I'm someone who like I have to see things through
Uh, but I was really sick yesterday
Was a bar. I'm still kind of nauseous today. I don't know if I have food poisoning or uh
My medication is like doing something to me or whatever
But I'm okay
In fact, I'm re-drinking some water repeatedly
Do do do do
I'll first always yeah, I was like toma a messenger and I'm like girl
Uh, I might be only able to stream for like an hour because I don't feel good and she's just like no no get no
We could do this another time stop
I'm like, okay. She's so good. She looks out for me
Um, and then I'm kind of happy she told me to just like get some rest and stuff because I literally after
I finished like messaging her. I literally just puked and then I passed out
No, I don't I don't know. I don't know if I got food poisoning again. Um
I'll make some peanut butter toast
It really sucked because I was really looking forward to the stream
And I think uh, some of you guys are like, it's probably stressed. You're probably right. It could be stressed too
Stress can definitely cause an upset stomach. Um, I always worry about rena. She is older
I'm like you every five but the kitties have been good
I'm good now. I've been sleeping. I slept a lot. I rested a lot
drinking a lot pd light
I uh
Was taking everybody's advice when I asked on my and it's my alt account about
What foods you guys like when you're sick?
It was very helpful
I actually almost got some
What is it called
The beef soup the Spanish beef soup ever get something different del res des res ever get
Yeah, and I got ginger ale. She's like, did you have ginger ale and I'm like, yes, I had ginger ale. Thanks mom
Um, yeah, today's been better
Uh, do you still have that puke? How much for it? It was flushed down my toilet
I can I can send you my toilet water
Beef and not chicken. No, I did have chicken soup, but somebody had recommended. Um
Oh my god
Uh, Calda there is
Which is very tasty. I've had it before and I like how hearty it is
I like honestly really want to go to grocery shopping so I can make myself a nice
uh stew
What is this sonic? Oh, oh
Oh my god
This could definitely be interpreted as a sonic. Oh, see. Holy crap
I was your build during the three fingers run. Uh, I was a faith build
um
I scaled with faith and
uh
I was I just really had the halo site the entire time like I farmed
Um that whole part of calid to get all the armor and the halo site in the sphere
um
And then I literally just spammed the fucking
Halo
Uh magic thing
Why do they have to put rabbits in sonic? Why not? Why is twanish?
Hardest boss in your opinion
Uh, the tree sentinel done
I would say tree sentinel just because of like he's the first guy to run into you
But I'm trying to think of who the hardest person I thought was I think
I remember
I was like losing my mind after redawn like I probably spent like so many hours. I think I spent like six hours
fighting redawn
But it was so satisfying when I finally fucking killed him
um
And this is again, it was my allen ring was kind of my true first
Soulslike from soft game that I ever played like I didn't I have I played sakuro. I played dark souls
Uh, I can't remember if it was two or three
I was it two or I can't remember
But like I never played through the game because I didn't know how the game worked in terms of like, yes
It's hard. You're not supposed to just be able to beat things
um like in sakuro and in whatever dark soul games I played
I like was getting so upset because I thought I had to beat the first boss to continue like the first thing you run into
Which is not the case
So I'd say like redawn was hardest because I I had never played the type of game before so it was mentally taxing
um
but
actually
The god skin
Twins were pretty fucking annoying
They were actually really fucking annoying to deal with
I think of it
God I sold her in the beginning as hardest. Yeah
I forgot to tweet. Why don't you tweet for me?
I bought the dlc. Yes, I did
You guys bought me the game and I said if you bought me the game I'd buy the dlc. So I bought it
It's my toaster
I think also
What I haven't been helping myself out is I've been eating a lot of spicy food, which I can't handle that well
But I eat it anyways
And I think my body has just been rejecting me because I haven't been doing that
Everybody's like stop your white jeans cannot handle this much spice
Let's stop to it immediately
Our life will be forfeit
I
I'm buttering my toe. Wait, this has mold on it
Wait, but I ate toast the other day. I just bought this toast
Oh, no, is that why I've been sick because I've been eating fucking moldy bread. Are you fucking kidding me right now?
Well, so much for I literally just bought this bread. Are you fucking kidding me?
How did this get fucking moldy? Holy shit, that's bad
Okay, well
Never mind
So much for that
Uh
Well
Yeah, toast bread is it? No, it's like it was my normal bread like it's normal bread
I just bought it like a couple days ago and I ate some the other night and I'm wondering why
If that's what's made me sick if you guys I made some in the dark with my glasses off
So I definitely didn't see it
Okay
That's why am I such a failure
Yo favorite girl failure miss she be caught in the bomb
Time to order that pizza. I know I'm like
I'm debating
I'm debating whether I have to order something now
I need to go I just need to go grocery shopping. I that's what I need to do on my day off. I need to go grocery shopping
Boomi, what are you doing? I'm trying to steal stuff. Don't look at me like that
Yeah, why are you purring?
Okay, it doesn't matter. I have rice cakes
Holy rice cakes
I can't believe they were so moldy
I feel sorry for that. I'm so I'm so mad
I put some rice cakes
some peanut butter over rice cakes
And then we'll lunch and have a chat
I'm sorry. I can't see chat because I'm like across my kitchen in the other room. What are you doing?
I mean, what's up?
Hello, can you move mister?
Who?
Boomi just likes to be underfoot as cats often are
He is sitting crittily to the side
And then I don't know where we're going. She probably went to the team
But I hope you guys are having a good day today
I'm very excited to play Ellen ring. I love Ellen ring so much
Oh, so so much. I can't because I know that the game is so big. I know there's so much
I don't even know about even though I felt like several hours and hundred hours into it
And I can't wait for you guys to show me things
Um
You so for one thing I will say
You guys don't have the backseat
I played the game if I need help I'll ask for help
Um
But yeah, like and yeah, also when you guys in since you guys like some of you want to play
I don't know how that will work
Like don't we have I don't know if we have to be like friends on steam and stuff and I can't do that
Um
Okay, I got that
I also have some corn bread
Let me get some corn bread
I think I also have like one little chicken noodle soup can so I could have that for dinner
This veal or just of course bread perhaps
That's why I don't buy bread from this or they don't throw at the bread that's used
Maybe I think that's why because I'm like I just bought this decision. I have not gone bad so soon
Madam you have to press new game
Yeah, no duh. Why are you?
Oh, you're being fucking cheeky. I see you
Uses a password system in game. Oh, okay
There's the same pattern. Oh, okay, that's good to know
Wait is my stream like super laggy again like before
Let me see
Why is it that when I did my other stream it automatically
Put it as
High latency and not low latency, but now it's fine make that make sense
Yeah, yeah, it's it's very it's very fun. It's fast. It's good. I'm gonna
Do this that looks fine
barely visible
It's still visible even if I put it at zero so I'll just
Keep it to what it was before
super high
So I can see everything. I'm just about at five to be honest with you because I am fucking blind
Yeah, I literally only got it like three days ago the bread
I
Should be fine
Oh, okay interesting. So last time I was a confessor
So I'm usually someone who does like
One sword and then other hands
Magic
I did I did do kind of a faith arcane bill last time because I used a lot of dragon stuff
And I'm debating whether or not
To
I just think this is funny because it's like the male and the female and the male and the female look exactly the same in the prisoner one
Spell bleed. Yeah, like I usually so I had like the halo scythe
And then I also
Would just use like arcane magic
um
And then I would also because I also had the black knife and I would abuse the fuck out of the black knife
I never even had to use like
I would literally just mimic tear and the mimic tear would distract and I would just spam the black knife
Uh special thing
Summarize the easiest one to start I might do that
Liza p has been t- yeah, yeah
I agree with you. Liza p was really fun. I have to I ended up beating that off stream. So that was good
Mimic is a true lord. Imagine there was a plot twist
And like the mimic goes evil. That'd be a cool DLC crunch. I'm eating my rice cake
I kind of want to scale with magic a little bit better
Right
I might do the profit
Remember for one build I did like dual wielding daggers and that was the stupidest thing ever did
Because I just didn't have good daggers. I can't remember the ones I used
Oh
Thank you, Anonymous for new bread
Come get this bread
I'm like debating whether or not retch
It's so funny
Yeah, I can't even more moldy bread
What up what bill did strani go for
Wanting if I should do the no prisoners more intelligence
again, I
like the confessor because I do feel like it's
Easy and well-rounded, but I kind of want to do something else this run
I might go profit I'm wondering if
I'm like should I do something different because I know faith in the arcade and then profit would be good for that
Because I remember when I first played I just picked anyone. I'm like this looks good
Like I didn't do like a mad like I didn't do an intelligence build. I know I've never done an intelligence build
Although I know you can be absolutely cracked with an intelligent intelligence build
Yeah, you know what I might I might go with a stroller drew them because they still
Like they still are pretty good
A prisoner maybe
Prisoner face okay
I
Honestly, I think I prefer the prisoner
Because they have high intelligence. They have good faith in arcane, but they also are level nine and have yeah
I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go a prisoner
Yeah, magic glimb blade is a good spell. I think I'll do that
Uh B
My titties are out
I'm telling the space fun to go spellcasting. I know I've never done full spellcasting
I've only usually done like with the weapons, but I also but I like smashing things like I like stabbing things
I'm like already trying to think of like. Oh, I know where this weapon is like. Maybe I should go get that one
They also have a sweet hat. I can knock people I can headbutt with people with it
Playing as a gift for my lord video
Um
I'm wondering if I should be a woman or a man
I've made a male build. I did my bandit was a male build, but I'll stay a woman
Age we are mature
Origin prisoner. Oh fucking yo
I'm a little confused by this face and this body type
Uh
Why does it my part of the face is the same? I don't know if I like that
Sorry, let me go back
Keepsake, uh
I'm real last time I did stone sword key
I use that to go to the first grave or whatever fuck it's called
I could get ashes could I go and seed
Apparently gender does matter in speedruns what?
A build did you settle on I'm thinking of uh intelligence faith build
Could I never really play with like the magic?
In Shabiri's whoa
Ron is delicious wait explain to me
Yeah, I got I remember I did the limb grave dungeon without knowing what the fuck I was getting into
Yeah, I might do golden seed
I remember I would literally read Shabiri's whoa as Shabari
I was like, oh, yeah Shabari like why would they call it Shabari or like Shabari's great. I just like pronounce it wrong
I'm up is she be kind of cute you can think toma for that
Mimic grace. Yeah, I never I don't understand mimic grace
Am I pressing the right button? Hello
Okay, I guess I can't get out of this
Okay, well, I'll name myself
Damn it. I'm out of Shibi

site in order to transfer
Yeah, what's up with your little hot doll body
Mother I mean mother. I mean mother. I am sorry

She sounds like I don't know why but Ronnie reminds me of
Uh, Calypso from uh Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't know why she's Welsh. Oh
Oh
I
No way
Okay, the spirits will obey thine command but whatever you say, honey, um
Let me just
I
That's cool. I'm just gonna try to I can't pick up your skirt. Do you have how many legs you got under there?
You got oh, that's me
Oh, wait, hold on. Hold on somebody put a thing in you. So that's kind of annoying and it wasn't my thing

Do you ever use your hands to hold up your boobs as a bra? Oh, bye
I'm staring at her hands. Fuck fucked it up. Fucked it up. Stupid stupid stupid
Oh
That's a vision of Trump
I think they had the same idea as me trying to look up her skirt. All right
Here's the plan
I don't have one
Uh first priority
I don't feel like going all the way over there. Just yeah, maybe
I'm not really worried about going over here because
Unless I need something from there. I'm not gonna go over there the weeping peninsula. Um
I believe the other map is over here
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know
And I could yeah, and then I gotta go up
And then yes, I do need to don't I need to kill him to well, I could go the cheatzy doodle way
To get to
What's it called?
I don't have to fight him to go through there and I would honestly rather not
I'd rather take the road around
The hills
To do that, but I forget how to do that
I like that. I remember like important things and then I just don't remember how to enact them
Under psychic yeah, I need to do that
Uh
No, I'm not I'm not summoning anybody summoning anyone right yet just yet. Um
We ride and period wife gone
Yeah, weeping is good for far. I did farm a lot in the weeping peninsula. I recall
Um
Sorry, it's moving my obs window so I can see it better
Okay, uh, I believe there's a map fuck. Why does it keep doing that?
There's a map
Somewhere in this direction
So I will go over there. We ride at dawn except it's nighttime
I love running simulator
It's my favorite
Riding horse riding simulator after a big jar lad quest you can't forget. Oh, fuck you're right. I gotta do a lot of shit. Ah
There's important quests I need to do
Because I need to get the wonder psychic it's physics physics psychic. I forget where that is
We ride at night, um
Um

Um
Damn, there's so much to fucking do in this game. Why am I oh my I have bonus runes right now
Um
Gotta do a lot of stuff
A lot of stuff. Let me just focus on maps. I think maps
Yeah, the maps right over here. That's what it is. Let me do that. Fuck you
I wish we needed to lead it. It would just switch to that
To one instead of two
All right, let's fucking do it focusing on the maps and then we'll know our way around
Honestly, when I labeled it when I get all the maps, I'll be able to know where the fuck I'm going and have a bigger better plan
Let me not jump off cliffs
Um, I'm debating whether or not to just speedrun
Because again, I've played the game before I've beaten the game before
I'm I am very tempted just to focus on a build
And worry about defeating uh, radon and moog
Damn why the maps are fucking far? Oh
Shit, oh, oh shit. I have to go over the bridge. Let's see night rider
I could have teleported but you know, I prefer the scenic rope, you know scenic ropes nice. Oh fuck me bro. No
Get away. Get away. Get away
I'm not really a speedrunner to be honest with you. I don't I don't speedrun anything
Get off my butt. Oh shit. I got it. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh, we're fine
I'm kind of wishing that I played a little bit before like on my ps5 before I started over here just so I can
Have more of my bearings
Hello mouse thing
Oh, yeah, that's
Let me grab this gray
Grace
Torrent go away. Thank you torrent

I was thinking about when she tried to smack her oh awkward
I think I know it's kind of I saw that uh, they're considering doing a
Uh unofficial anime adaptation of this and weirdly enough
Weirdly enough
I would prefer a live action adaptation
I don't know why
It would be a lot
Of CGI
And it would definitely probably be easy, but I don't know what I would prefer a live action
I don't know if it's just me
I think
I don't know. Maybe I'm just hankering for a new fantasy thing to watch
Uh, where am I going?
All right, I'm going to the cruel

Or
I can go to the church america and get into that fucking shitty plane

Um, so we're gonna teleport over here and we're gonna follow this road all the way down
We're gonna go around this fucking shit
And then we're gonna go and then we're gonna go over here and we're gonna talk to this lady probably

What's up big
Who am I fighting who is oh is that the troll?

There's a grace nearby there's a grace nearby over the bridge after the dragon
I think oh, it's right here. Perfect actually
Yeah
I could remember if there was a chest in that little area or if there was
That takes you to the cilia crystal caves or if it took you
To where the grand lift is but not on the right part of it. I mean the capital

I'm just trying to re-enter the call. No, she went to sleep. She went to sleep. She's a good night
She it's like fucking what time is it for her right now? Let me look

Yeah, she does keep vampire hours. Let me lean back in my chair a little bit
Yeah, cuz I like because I don't like
Wait like trying to figure out what time people are at or like what time it is for someone
Um, because then I could just look
Then just like
Do the math a little bit
I am comfy. I'm lean back in my chair. My legs are up. I am flourishing. I am fabulous
I'm charging my phone
I am actually I don't think I
I feel like I should order a pizza now
True gamer hours ordering a pizza
Fucked up sleep schedule. Okay, I know I'm gonna go fucked up sleep schedule
Uh
I don't know. Where should I order pizza from?
Give me suggestions. Where should I order pizza from?
I'm covered in my blinky. I'm so comfy
I took a shower today. I smell delicious
Papa John's
There is a Papa John's in me. I think
I
Pizzeria
The hut I've
There was like one pizza hut in my area and it went out of business. So just like never showed up. I have they don't really have
Papa geno's. I think there's a Papa geno's my local place
Local places are it's pretty good. They're all right
Trying to think of like the best local place
I
Like a sweet sauce
Can't recall
which out of
the three Papa geno's Papa John's and
Papa Domino's has sweet sauce ever get
I'm not a huge fan of deep dish
I think it's too saucy. It's too much. It's too thick
You think Papa John's has a sweet sauce or Domino's? I don't know. I can't remember
So like I don't know. Have you guys ever had like beach pizza?
Is that or is that just an east coast thing?
Beach pizza
No
Oh, um, I don't
Really know how to explain it
So beach pizza. It's really tasty. It's sound it's um
It's really it's square cut pizza with really nice sweet sauce and
um
They have they just throw like a slice of provolone on it. It's just so good and we call it beach pizza
Because usually you can get it on at the beach
It's not there's not like the actual like that's not the like the company that makes it
It's just call it just colloquially
Call beach pizza and you can get like ham and shit and like extra provolone
It's pretty good
It's really tasty
It's like the sharpness of the little bit of sharpness from the provolone and then like the sweeter sauce is really tasty
You have marcos? No. It must be an American thing. I think it is
I'm gonna like
Cause I feel like
I'm gonna look off the name of the place I should get it from
But I'm checking to see if it's family owned
Or if it's everywhere
Oh, yeah
Um
Okay, that's
That would be such a pain to like it would be so expensive for just a few slices
But it's not it's not that it's not it's different than that
It's similar but it's not it's like
But I'm gonna stop describing it because I feel like it will
You'll be able to find where I am. Um, okay
Enter ever jail I always wanted I used to call it ever goal
And whatever it is it looks great
Um, let me go on swords ash and let me get some pizza
Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Oh fuck. I might have accidentally just marked it something is bad
No, I didn't mean to do that
Oh
Accidentally was like rate your last food and I was like accidentally put three stars when I was cleaning three stuff
I could order some little Caesars
Oh my god, I can't order Pizza Hut. What the hell
What the hell there's so much they have so much shit. I think I'm Cinnabon mini rolls. What the fuck
I am getting diabetes just looking at their menu. Holy shit
I did not I've never had Pizza Hut before
I think I'm gonna order Pizza Hut just because I've never had it before
I
Didn't find I was pronounced jail after watching British streamer because apparently it's more commonly known there. Yeah, I think I think that's how I found it out too
Big fan of the hut. Yeah
It's bottom to your Pete secret coming out of left field screaming it's bottom to your pizza
Pizza Hut
What what in hut pizza hut he is always giving me food points. Okay, I never mind
I don't need food poisoning for the 50th time in my life
Uh this week
Like a pizza
Oh, if I order from here, oh, it's so expensive
I'm I know I need to eat but I'm actually getting nauseous looking at food right now
I think I might just have soup
Oh, no, but those soup plays they ordered from those really good as closed
I
Guess I'll starve
Actually like the crust on dominoes sandwich
sandwich
Say pizza for the collab with Toma making a pizza party. That's cute. Actually
I think I'll just make my soup self some soup later because I have some chicken noodle soup like some Campbell's
I think that'll be good for me
When I have some um oyster crackers left over from
The last place I ordered from yes
Toma knows how sandwiches dominoes is really greasy. I usually have to pack the pizza
All right, I'm ready
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm so ready
I
I'm already dead
Guys, I think I lost guys. I think I need to be a little bit stronger
Guys
Just a warm-up just a warm-up
Just take an IV trip for a new nutrition. Why is it make me go all the way over here?
I
Like bonking them and then they explode
Look at it. He's being silly
Always coming towards me that's awkward anyways
Are you the one of those summons is cheating kind of players no I usually
I usually like abuse the fuck out of my mimics here
Um
That's really about it. No, I think about it. What the fuck? Oh, he's confused the fuck out of me for a second
Can you come up please?
I don't remember his moveset. Oh, yep. That's right
This will spin you're so fast bro. You're so fast. I I held up. I held this up
Okay, this isn't gonna work out
Five guys shield summon
One hit clap
Oh
Yeah, let's just continue to how we were going
I'll come for that bloodhounds fang later
I'll just get the warning star first. I need something that it does bleed
Sack
Pizza fun. Oh, thank you future pizza fun
I should just have something added to my throne and just be like pizza fun
Oh speaking of throne, uh, I was thinking
Uh, I'm kind of like I don't really need anything else anymore
So I just add stuff that I need for my house
um
And I'm wondering if I should start doing what Amy did and start saving for a 2.0
Because I kind of just want I kind of want a model that's like more me
I love this one, especially when I am in my Muppet form
That's on this side. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me
All right, now we can go to Kaleid. We have what we need
Actually it's up here
This is where I need to go too. I forget how big Kaleid is
I thought I thought this game was so huge like I thought
Um, just limb grief and weeping peninsula. We're gonna be the whole tarry game and I was so wrong
Yeah, I'm already getting a
tan model with um, that's what I mean if I'm in a couple weeks or so
So I hope it not good enough. I love the Muppet actually. I would just have a straight-up Muppet model
So beyond me and Tom are talking. I'm like, I wish there were more cartoony models out there like
I'm someone I don't like
Westernized
Anime style models, but I do like cartoony models. There's a difference. There's a difference in that
Hello
Grail
You say pizza I say
Filling sandwich supreme
Thank you. Thank you so much said
Dastoy
Sounds like dastardly
All right, um, I forget where you go after this
Pretty sure you go past
Really doing this all by memory. My memory's not good. Oh, you'll pass this tree
We'll pass the minor or a tree
With a little funky guy
Nevermind
I died
Oh
And that's what this would be like a thing that would be later on like this would be like towards like the fall
Probably actually
Maybe for my birthday because my birthday's in um
In September it's September 28. I probably don't want maybe model before then as a little tree, you know
Um, then you go around do you go up if you go up again? I'm doing this all my fucking memory
There you go
Oh, what the hell how are you hitting me? No
Don't pass these dudes
Yes, here we are. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Hi
Hello, sweetie. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna put you out of your misery. Okay
All right
Oh, I forgot you summon other dragons
I'm gonna come right over here
Here dragons
I forget the story with this one
Anyways, top grade in here. I'm gonna kill you for doing that
Okay
2.0 actually not even like a one point. Well actually honestly my toggle update be like a 1.5
I am hidden in your wing. Nobody can find me
But I'm maybe even later. I don't even know because again, I know stronti put a lot of money into this model. So I don't want to like
Take it for granted or seem like I am because I like this model like I like
I'm not the model. That's a muppet. Um
I don't know just something more me
Oh
I can wield this with both hands. How do I double how do I double hand wield something I totally forget
I totally forget how to do that
Oh
What
Oh, yeah, okay. No, why is it doing this?
Oh
Can I put this on my
I don't I don't want to use this
There we go
Stop yelling I'm trying to kill you
It's my take a while
Where's the best spot I mean, this is a good spot. This is not a good spot. Um, hold on
Hold on. I'm thinking
You're like in the ground in the ground
I don't see what this guy says
Why does it always talk
You really attack her it's a girl
You're gonna you're gonna you want my muppet body you're gonna you're gonna do stuff to this muppet you're gonna leave me nice and crusty
Like your song
Oh
I don't want to attack by the tail
It's because I feel like all this magically aggro something somehow
Oh, what's the matter? What do you mean?
I feel like in lower wind tarnish is doing this the tarnish is burning their way into the dragon's body
Oh
I need to look up what her deal is though because I know there's like another thing you can do with this dragon
She's just here just for farming
Oh
Oh, she's grail the braille
Well, thankfully, um, are you talking in leech?
By the way, are you
Uh, secondly, uh, that's why you want to get a bleed because the bleed as you just saw
Uh, it does a little bit extra damage because you have that blood loss
buff
That's why a lot of people love doing the uchi katana or uchi ga
I can't pronounce it. Uh, what the name is and the rivers of blood because they're really good for bleed builds, but
I don't feel like doing reverse blood
I do love a good blood build though. Like I did do blood faith arcane. That was nice
The way it's supposed to go is you kill the tiny dragons and it kills the big one
Oh
I'm not going to do the gold feet until I get uh closer because it has a time limit on it
I
Guys remember taps the sign I have played the game before
You like frost frost is I never actually I never did anything with frost
Maybe they'll be the magic that I work I I do for intelligence
Shut up stop yelling
She's the mother of dragons why she liked this where's Daenerys? Oh, she put her arm up
Wait, no, I don't want to do that. I feel like she'll cross me. That's really cool though. I've never I've actually never seen her move this much
Sorry, I have to hit you in the fucking leg
There we go now we pop this bad boy
Okay
She currently goes too large so she could no longer either fly her babies bring her food. That's so sad
I
Hurry up, let them run out
Oh
Okay, we're so close
Forever bopping this lady only she would die. Hello. Where is it?
Fuck hurry up
Oh
Okay, bye
Any group, whoa, wow cool
I
Was a battle it's my first kill
I can whack you
Sick now I have a lot of fucking runes. Let's go. Um, so now
Yippie, I don't want you to shit. Uh, let's go
Yeah
Because now the fun starts, you know now the fun really fucking starts
Okay, I I need a plan
I need to plan and you think of what do I want for my build? So we're gonna sit here
Now time to kill I'm trying but
I'm thinking because we got like a hundred k runes we could you know farm
No, I need to get the mimics here next
I need to get the mimics here
Uh, because that's the only ash that I really care about I didn't really use anything. Um, let me
I'm gonna look up some weapons
Yes
Faith intelligence builds
You
Could get the sword of night in flame
Isn't that oh where's the sword of night in flame I totally forget
There's not actually it's it's really there's not a lot of fucking options for scaling with faith intelligence
So I might do like something else there's not a lot of
You can't really there's not a lot of weapons for a faith intelligence build
So
Yeah, I know I got it look like we're done
Okay
Again, I'm speed running I'm going there you want me to go I don't want to go full caster
I don't want to go full caster
I want to do more casting because I never
Like I'm I'm someone who I always just do like hack and slash the entire time like again
I told you I literally rolled with blood uh bloodhounds fang for the longest fucking time
Yeah, there's good options all around intelligence. Maybe I won't do faith
Like I'm debating because I now I'm tempted to do because I've done
A blood build now I'm tempted to do a frost intelligence build because frost seems cool
Although I remember I have had my put shit shit pushed in from an invader with the rock slingshit
So many options because I just want to know what I should put all these runes into you know
No
Not that I can't go farm runes I can always go farm runes. Hi reyna, welcome back
Oh reyna just hopped up on my desk and she pressed stuff. Oh reyna sweetheart. I okay. She's like I must snuggle with you mother now
Lend me a warmth
Hi reyna
Hi, I'm sorry. I didn't boop mean to boop you on the snoot. Oh, you want to give me a hug? Oh
I want to shit on my shoulder. Oh, you want to give me purrs
I've already done an arcane build
She wants to cave
Do
Furnace crest line since you're not an idiot like me that
Arches him on site first smack talking you. Yeah, I could do that
um
Oh, that sucks. I feel so bad for people who killed him right off the bat for that because that was a good place to farm
um
Thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking
What are some other uh faith in it have really good weapons in dlc true and that is the end game. We're only doing
this
Yeah, I don't don't spoil but that's good to know that's that is still really good to know because we this is the ultimate thing is
We're just trying to get a good build to get into the like as we're going into the dlc
Because i'm literally leveling a shit out of my stuff
and then
We're going to go straight for redawn and mog although I have to kill redawn anyways
so
And then we're just going to go straight for mog
Mog mog
Hmm
Mog is very weak to bleed yeah, because now i've tempted i'm like, you know
Bleed is just like, you know try to true. I do love a good bleed like blood bleed build
And i'm like do I go to kaolin do I farm for the scythe again?
Anyway, I just get that
Oh, because that's what I did in the faith the faith that I just bled, you know
You're gonna want to level up your flask too. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know I I do have to grab that stuff. I have to grab that stuff
You're right
Bleed is the meta I know but I hate that like everybody has a fucking blood build because it's easy, you know
I'm like, you know, do I do it because it's easy because I need easy
Comet azure is pretty good. Okay, I got to know
It's so funny. It's I don't know why but it's very ironic to me that mog is
weak against blood blood
So frostbite. Yeah
Think about that
Yeah, I was thinking about getting the uchi katana in the dungeon
And fuse it with cold
Oh, okay
Okay, you're on to something uchi katana
Get some cold
All right
In the moonville katana. Yeah
Yeah
Uh
The moonville katana
Is in kaolin in a dungeon, isn't it?
I'm just like really happy right now by the way, I just want to let everybody know that I'm happy because I'm just like
You can have like elvin ring stuff. Okay
Cool cool, uh, I'll just like search where that is on the map
I might copy your build so
Okay
If you progress ronnie's quest line is also the dark moon greatsword. That's true
I'm glad you're happy
I just love this game so much. I just love elvin ring
This their ability would never do I don't know really
Do you eat you have the elvin ring?
I told me after you yeah, uh, yes, I do it's I have it up on my phone. I read that is mega penis
I don't know why
The torch only builds
I'm not on android on iphone because it's easier for tracking for vtube vtubers
If honestly, I would consider searching to android if they did had some really good ar
stuff
Or whatever the light are whatever the fuck they use in iPhones
What is my least favorite build
Huh, what is my least favorite
I saw like the fists like people like
Are like the fucking pots on your hands
Bo's actually yeah bo suck dual shield
I've I've
I have enjoyed watching someone do a bow build only
It was fun to watch but not fun
It would be fun to do
Boomi are you pissing?
You just me out and then gone the litter box and piss did you just announce to everyone you're pissing?
Good job boomi good piss good job you pee like a little girl you squat
I'm also arts and dlc is super fun. I've heard that
Bo builds actually have good weapon now as well interesting
I'm so excited to get to the dlc portion. You guys have no idea, but again, I really want to
Um
And I won't lie to you. I'll probably pay play a little bit of this off stream
Uh just to get
To a good spot
Um and grind a little bit so you guys don't have to just see me grinding and just like farming and shit
Mother please must you announce my bathroom habits to everyone?
I know he just literally just like zoomied around the room afterwards
Now he's watching birds outside while he fucking tweaks out in the cat tree
The hell dude
Well, there he goes zoom in
Um
It's also super hard
Okay, what is the ideal level for the dlc is my question
That's what that is what I would like to know
A little level 170. Okay 150 150 ish. Okay. I can do that
Good to know good to know. Okay. So yeah, I definitely
I'll say 60 I'll do I'll do a cool 60 69 even
So I'll probably again, I might like grind stuff off stream
um
Especially because then I could just focus and just lock in and just be like
Um, but we're gonna play I'm obviously gonna keep playing until I get tired
Which will probably be like 1 a.m. So
Help you're locked in bros
150 minimum good to know good to know
Uh, you did it at 125 and it was hard as hair of last week
Boomi, what are you doing? You don't need to be up here. You just peed. I don't really appreciate this man
I'm gonna play with your little pouch
Boomi titties boomi titties boomi titties
He's like trying to walk and I'm just like poking his pouch
He has like
He has such a pronounced pouch
He looks like he has boobies especially because his nipples hang out boomi. Can you not paw at my tentacle?
He just like backed it. He's backed my tentacle
He's my tentacle to hold up my headphones. I still haven't used it yet because I haven't been feeling good
Maybe I'll use my tentacle later
For something other than headphone use
Hi Yashom
You're making rena nervous. Can you please leave? Thank you. Okay rena
rena doesn't really want anyone around her
besides like
Me and fia so she just doesn't like boomi
Because like she's fine with fia around her because she's injured
But if boomi comes near her, she's like very guarded. Did you want to get down rena? I can put you down
Let me move my microphone up the way and then I'll put you on the floor
There you go, man. Why don't you go lay down and have some water or something? Yeah
I'll let you miss John
She has a follow-up appointment in a couple weeks
I'm messing with the kitty foopa. Yeah
Watch a guy for a white mouse far. Yeah, that's true. I need to
Uh kill some fucking shit for that. Uh, I hate that part because I need to do I need to do his for the the farming thing
So I can kill that fucking
Yeah, so I can kill the fucking
But I also need to get a bow
Shit
I could
go
Into is it the limb grave?
Grave or whatever the fuck the dungeon underground
that
You get a nice bow from
Isn't there an urtary thing I can kill get a bow from too
Remember strong you got power level by chat giving your stacks the stacks of lords rooms
I don't think there's a reason to mention a pain to find people due to a level
interesting
And and if I do it now, it's probably going to be people who are newer players
Let's go buy a bow. Yeah, but I want a good bow
Yeah, that's in the first area. Yeah, that's right. I remember getting that before I might go back and do that now that I have a stone sword key
Yeah, usually I would just get it and get out. I just would read it and it'd be like hey, and then I would just leave
Serpent go bow, but the serpent I'd have to get what I have to get right card for that
Where's the serpent bow? No, you can kill right card with the serpent bow
I want to I want a nice bow. Oh, yeah, that's true. I can get the I can get redawn's bow
Why don't we just I'll just do that
I have done the I think when I played I did the AI invasions
Serpent bow was in the starting era. Where is the serpent bow?
I remember I have it. I had a certain bow. I forget how I got it though
Crossbow in the round table. That's a good point
Caleb cave easy to get to
Okay
Okay, which bow do you guys think would be best in redawn's bow serpent bow
the crossbow
I might I might do redawn's bow because he's on the way
He's like he's he's something I have to do anyways
I think I was bow last time too
I might just do the AI fight thingy. We'll have better range for the bird farm. Yeah, you're right
Yeah, see that's why I didn't want to just buy a bow. I think we're gonna do that
I think we're just gonna get redawn's bow
Um, then I gotta kill redawn
Get his bow mimic tear
Duvar is quest
Uh, yeah
I
My muppet is seven, bro. I'm gonna out the fuck does that mean?
Yeah, so with the rolling thing that would be like a whole puzzle I have to get to
Well, it would just be kind of straightforward if I just kill redawn
I'm very much human serpent
No, my butt is serving bro. I'm about to act up. What wait, what's wait though? Wait till what wait till I do this, huh?
Wait till I do this. What if I take these bad puppies off?
or if I
Take these puppies away
Now
My full power is unleashed
Now you see me in all my glory
Yeah
How's that make you feel?
Knowing you want to have relations with a puppet
Dirty dirty boy
or girl
Bible time
And she's uh, I remember I told her I was just like, oh, I don't think I'm gonna draw your things
I'm like, don't even bother don't even draw bother try the shabari. It would just be so annoying to do in this model
on this little guy
If I do collabs, I'm using this from now on for fuji tech. I'm using this from now on
Instead of my
um
Discord avatar
I want to use this
I'm now a puppet png youtuber
The limiters are off
I'm racist now
Ha ha
Basically my run to dlc godric rinola runan grab the miracle here did various quests farm rune levels and 60 fought moke
um
Why rinola and godric I'm I I'm interested
Uh
I bet
Rhinola so I can get
The respect yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Um, I probably will do that then I probably should
Also kill rinola
Godric for rune
Like leveling dex barf and dexterity is not the way in this game
um
Godric for his great rune
What is godric's gate rune? What does it do again? I forget
Do you not need to fight them? Oh, do I have to
Okay
Five times every start that's right
I went godric then moke with a 12 weapon only took me a hundred eighty five times
Okay
All right, so change of plans then we're mapping our way
Um
Godric the grafted
I remember I was like so thankful that like there's just like one person that I summoned in that just fucking wrecked him
with a comet
And I was like yo
Getting softcap so uh, but it's it's good for like
Just a basic thing though. I don't yeah, that's I think that's why they put him at the beginning of the game
Beware of any moke type enemies. What do you mean?
Excuse me
That's pretty solid. I get myself myself a seven out of ten for that. Maybe eight
If it was like oh, then I would have been better
Yeah, okay, that's all I agree. I agree with these I agree with these a little tisker
I love how me and strawnee both call it tisker because in my head I read it as tisker and she also calls it a tisker
We'll carry you until you get rid of dons. Yeah, precisely
Okay, I think I'm gonna level myself
intelligence
but like
What weapon do I get again? I've never done an intelligence build
I've done faith. I've done strength
I've done dexterity. I've done arcane
I've never really like messed with the magic aspect of Elden Ring minus like what's in faith
I never did any of the sorcery shit
I
Wish I did because it's like perfect for long range
Mommy, what are you doing?
Do you dexterity katana with frost or moonville? Okay. All right. Yeah, let's get let's get the let's get the moonville
Let's get the moonville
I 100 agree. Okay. Uh, where's the moonville?
It's in kaolin. It's in what you're gonna call it
I need to get the kaolin map
Uh, let's go over here and run to get the kaolin. Wait, there's a cliff, isn't there?
Oh, fuck me. I know there's like one here one there one there
I'm gonna start up here first actually
You
Tunnel for left that's right. I want to do frost because I think frost would be fun
And some of the gravity shit. Um, yeah, isn't it?
Is it right? Is this this isn't it right? This isn't where it is, right?
It's not here. It's like there's one like over here, right? I don't know am I tripping
It's this one
This is the one
Sometimes we need some rotten cotton
All the magic bug casters it's in the selly uh, it's in the selly the caves
Plates patiently for everybody to catch up and respond. I'm just gonna look
Oh
I'm debating whether or not to stay because I was gonna go over
Salem's house tomorrow to hang with her at her pool that she has at her house
For jill 4th of july, but I also want to keep an eye on arena
And I'll be stressed out if I go and if I do that, I'll probably just do a gorilla tomorrow of elden ring
And do some grocery shopping and shit
um
Sorry, I thought of that because she just texted me. She's like, you don't have to come over if you want to check on her
Okay
Well, me who are you talking to? I hear you making funny noises. I think rena just hissed at him
Uh
Okay, it is that tunnel. Okay, there is a grace right over here
This one here this one here. I really should just go up and around to be honest
I
Kind of need to find where all the maps are. I'll go get this map and I'll be I think I'll that'll do me a little bit better
Let's do that
Don't forget your milk and I know I need milk and eggs
I still have this in my hand
I didn't mean to do that
Um, okay, I have a lot of rooms so
What do you guys suggest that I should do because I can
Get to level 35
Which it's not as much as I thought it would be to be honest with you
I
Just all in vigor
All 37 a little bigger
Well, yeah, I know I'm supposed to do bigger, but what should I scale for everything else should I get everything at like 20?
I think I accidentally also put stuff like intelligence at 20
You
Next 30 needs to be 17 for the moon veil
Okay
Fine for more fp
I
Think I'm gonna do
20
Yeah, I'm not gonna worry about faith right now to be honest with you. I can always respect that later
I
Need 18 decks and 15 strength for a dawn bow
Really
Fuck
Ha
Will the serpents bow be better than what does the serpent bow scale with?
Because I was thinking about like because I think this looks good
I can do hand the bow. Okay, that's what I thought
Okay, but I'm not gonna worry about that then
Um
Sore seal a little farming
Okay, nice hand puppet
Hello, it's me your favorite puppet. It's me should be coming bum. I'm just glad to be here
In K-Lin what a lovely place

A mortar actually I might just put it into mind
Something for your mind mind mind mind

Hmm

And I can always respect
I have 6,000 rooms though. I kind of want to make sure I can get one more level
Sore sales behind me what what do you mean?
It's just behind me behind me is it this no
I'm kidding because I never I never use the sore seal before
It's in the fort by the dragon what the fuck

Bottom level it's below the dragon
So
Oh god
When you go up and then down so like co-across to the side then down there
Oh, it's in fort ferro, okay

Oh this fucking oh fuck
Oh, I remember this, uh, where is this again in here? Is there a pumpkin head in here?
I kind of sworn there's
I'm thinking of the wrong forts because I could have sworn there was a golden
Thingamabob right over here. I guess I was wrong. I might be thinking of the wrong place
Oh, this is the one with the fucking harpies in it
Fuck me, um
Oh
Hold on
Let me just take a
Oh
Yeah, but like
Okay
You get a fucking lantern, that's why I need to fucking get

It's gonna run past all the elderly. Yeah, no, I got this. I got this. I got this. I got this. I got this
I'm proud of myself
Kind of like don't want to hold this though. I just want to run. I feel like I'm lighter this way. All right, go
Fine
The fuck is below me
All right, all right, we're good. We're good. We go down, we go down, we don't down, we run, we run, we're running
We're jumping, we're going down, we're going down, we're going down, we're going down.
Oh.
Um.
Come on, I need to heal.
No, I gotta go back and get my runes.
I like, I spazzed out and I couldn't remember, I'm like, how do I heal?
I just got scared, I just got scared.
It's fine though, we're gonna go get it.
Also increases damage taken.
Why did I want this again?
I don't.
Uh.
How does this, this hasn't raised anything.
2.
Just don't get hit.
Oh, did I burp?
I didn't even notice.
Uh.
Alright.
Fuck it, we've all, I need my runes.
Can I get it from here?
I could just stand close to it and clip it through.
Um, alright.
Excuse me, excuse me ladies.
Fog down.
Nevermind.
What the fuck?
I could have sworn I heard somebody else talking in the chat and that threw me off.
I'm wondering if Azura came in and like, made a noise and ran away.
If so, I blame her for dying.
Did anybody else hear that?
Oh, hi Boomi.
How many did I lose on my runes?
How about I get like half of them back?
Cause I don't, I don't want to but I'm like one more level, you know?
That's why I kind of want them.
Oh yeah, they're gone, gone.
Okay, nevermind.
Boomi, I can't see past you.
I can't see past you.
I can't see past you, Boomi.
Boomi, please.
Can you fall me out?
Boomi, please.
Get off my desk.
Boomi, please.
Get off my desk.
What's going on here?
Oh, okay.
Miss Dart.
Oh, you're fucking huge ass.
Oh my god, it's so heavy.
I mean, now you're captured and you get kiss it.
Why are you so warm?
My thumbs.
Why are you so warm?
Cause we don't mind being held like this.
What's that?
Usually you do mind being held like this.
Can you make a tissue?
Why are you trying to touch me, Boomi?
Why are you trying to treat us?
What's up with you?
What's with you?
Why are you trying to treat us?
How much space do you need?
Bye-bye.
You're also protecting me.
All right.
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
We're good.
Inventory.
We are switching to...
Free Spear.
Free Spear.
Okay, this is the only thing I can essentially fucking use right now.
Can I...
Really unclip?
Let's go.
Can you use this on top of a horse?
I don't understand why you can't use stuff from a top of a horse.
That's like the only thing that's stupid of me.
Okay, time to...
go to that...
something on the way.
That's a big ass tower.
Equipment.
Yeah, sorry.
I'm a little stupid.
I'm a little slow.
All right.
Great.
Now I have to get to this fucking dungeon, too, after this.
Oh, hi.
It's the dragon.
Why are you so alive?
Because you died with your family,
which I'm so comfortable with.
Oh, there's all going to be little tangle monsters in here.
These trees are just dancing.
Oh, I forgot how many dragons are around here.
I thought it was going to be a little tangle,
a muncher monster.
Please do not get aggroed.
Okay.
Wait, am I going the wrong way?
I kind of did.
I thought I should go back.
Oh, God.
Wow, it's such a beautiful day out.
Perpetual sunset.
Love it.
Pretty nice.
Hi, dragons.
Please don't kill me, dragons.
Please, dragons.
I'm only level 35, dragons.
Oh.
I wish I could pick up items.
Torrent, can you pick it up for me?
Why is it called dragon mode?
I need K-Lid map.
Let's just follow this path.
I could go...
Because there's like, there's graces around.
Like, there's one over here, one over there,
and one over there.
I don't have a lot of graces active right now.
I definitely need some.
But, let's...
I don't think I'll be able to cross over here.
Yeah.
Let me try.
Okay.
Okay, alright.
There's a doggy.
Do you see it?
It's here.
I love this so I can see where I'm going.
Oh, don't die.
Good job.
Let's go, sweetie.
What the fuck up dog?
Oh, not this guy.
Hello.
Why is everything on fire here?
You guys have better things to do.
It's so hot.
My nose is itchy.
Okay, there should be Diagro.
This is good.
There's a grace right over here.
Perfect.
California is so beautiful.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, like...
Yeah.
I don't know what I was going to say.
I was reading something and I lost my train of thought.
Can I put this in a bite?
Can I put this little fucking stick in my other hands?
There are graces everywhere if you know where they are.
Wow, that is the most profound thing I've ever heard in my life.
Holy shit.
If you just look around you, there are so many graces.
You just have to know where they are.
No shit, bro.
Why is it still saying that my stuff is over there when it disappeared?
I don't...
Go away.
Go away.
I don't need it.
Let's just die again so I don't have to...
I hate having the marker there because it's throwing me off.
What the fuck?
It's over here.
I'm actually getting bitched out by a Muppet.
That's funny.
Hi, lady.
Bye, lady.
I'm not showing you my fucking fingers.
You fucking freak.
I was just touching and smelling fingers.
You fucking freak.
You're all freaks.
You're all fucking stoked.
Fuck eat a puppy.
No, you don't want to do it.
I'm gonna go around the puppy.
Come on.
Torrent.
Oh, Torrent.
Oh, Torrent.
Oh, Torrent, please.
They said more health.
It's okay.
It's all right.
I want that.
Oh, nothing.
There's people on fire.
Everybody's just on fire.
I'm so sick of it.
Beautiful California whistle.
I like when things die and just give me rooms.
That's my favorite.
Okay.
Oh, fuck it.
Can you please stop agroing?
I don't want to pick up these rooms.
Hello, little slug thing.
Oh, there's lava.
Everyone, did I miss?
Thank you, good.
Bye, little sluggies.
Okay.
It's right around here.
I fork or where the opening is.
And I can't, oh, I can't open the map.
It's like right here.
Tell me your wisdom.
That's not helpful.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, because I am.
I can show you the world.
There it is.
Shining, shimmering, kaolin.
Tell me, harem, did you ever thought
you could be on a magic carpet ride?
A whole new floor.
A dazzling brothel you never knew.
And when you're way up here,
you're super queer.
Sorry.
Now I'm in a heart with you.
Now I'm in a whole new heart.
Unbelievable tits.
I wonder where he's going.
Oh, I meant to do this.
Hey.
Hey.
I thought there was going to be like a platform below.
Well, how many deaths am I at?
Like five?
That's actually pretty good.
All right, let's let's try that again.
Oh, fuck.
I have to go all over there.
Hi, lady.
Bye, lady.
Fucking freak.
Okay.
Wait, I know there's a closer one.
Let me just make sure.
It's over here, I believe.
I might just run around the path and get to that one.
Just so it'll be easier for me to go across, I think.
I don't know, actually.
Well, actually, let me go back to where I was and then we'll try it.
Okay, don't fuck with the dog and the bird.
I didn't see the bird up there before for whatever fucking reason.
Hi puppies.
Oh, hello puppies.
Hi puppy.
I love puppy.
I love donkeys so much, puppy.
What are y'all doing over here?
Just forcing a poor crab to, oh, this is what's happening.
Oh yeah, give me all of the, no.
I just wanted to watch you guys fight.
What's my job, bro?
Why don't you focus on the fucking crab killing your ass in the dog?
Yeah, well, how about that?
Yeah, the dog's fucking bopping your asses.
Holy shit, they're killing him.
They just killed that crab together.
Oh god, oh, I'm next, aren't I?
I should probably leave.
I think that's a good idea.
I think leaving is a great idea.
Actually, I do have to go back around.
Yeah, they're distracted.
Fine, they're distracted.
Why don't you guys go fight the dog?
I kind of wish their dogs would come over here and just kill these dudes.
Surprise, it was I.
It was me.
Oh yeah, no, I wouldn't be able to do that.
There's no point because, yeah, that wouldn't work out.
So I guess it's like this.
Why is that?
Oh, it's so red.
I'm like, I thought there was like a gap there.
Hi, hello, let me just get down.
Oh, um, well, how am I supposed to get down from there?
He pushed me off.
I'm playing this game for the first time.
I'm mad at being silly.
It's okay, birds aren't even real.
You know what?
You're real for saying that.
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
Anyways, torrent, wait.
Okay, that's still there.
Fuck.
Oh my god, Boomi, what the fuck are you doing behind me?
You're freaking me out.
You're making weird noises and you're scaring me.
I thought it was somebody else.
My door locked.
You can't tell.
Door is locked.
Okay, we're good.
I'm scared.
I'm notorious and some of you guys know that I just leave my door locked.
I'm not sure I leave to go do something.
Puppies are gonna fall on me.
It's fine, it's all good.
I'm gonna lead them to the little crabby.
He's having a little spat.
Hi, hello, hey.
Ow, how the fuck did you get me?
Where the fuck did that dog come from?
How do I get down?
Hello?
Hi.
This kid is missing us, so turn me into Muppet.
I'm a fucking Muppet, bro.
Get Muppet.
Don't you want to Muppet me?
Don't you want to have your way with this little Muppet?
A little soft Muppet body?
I have just one giant hole just for you.
First time catching me live?
This is awkward.
Third time's the charm, surely.
How do I get down?
I don't see a ladder.
Do you guys have any wisdom?
Touch bloodstain.
What about you?
Okay, you just kind of backed him and then he killed you?
All right.
Get my sneak.
Okay, I can get him.
I don't know why I didn't get him.
Whoa, never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
Why the fuck are you so strong for no fucking reason?
Why are you guys looking at each other like that?
Were they going to kiss afterwards?
I think they were going to kiss afterwards.
It was only like 300.
It doesn't matter.
It was literally dropping the bucket.
Where am I going?
I'm a fucking idiot.
All this just to get into the freaking dungeon.
I've never been in this one.
I've never been in this cave before.
I never went for the Moonville Katana.
Boomi, why do you have the zoomies right now?
See, your food's going off.
Oh, it's a dog.
Not a crab.
Okay, hold on.
Let me just look for a moment.
Okay, let us...
Let me point to above my head.
Yes, I've played the game before.
I know Kailit is hard.
You don't have to tell me, sweetheart.
Katana.
If it's two minutes and less...
Oh, no, you talk.
I have to mute you now.
All right.
Cool, cool, cool.
Yes.
Yes.
What the fuck?
Oh, he went a different way than I did.
That's why.
You...
Wait, Heidi.
Okay, you get down there.
Okay, all right, all right, all right.
I got you, I got you.
All I care about is how to get past these guys
and know where to land.
I don't care about anything else.
Right here.
That's where the platform is.
Are you going to jump down?
Fucking bitches.
Oh, there's fire.
What?
Where did the fire come from?
Where's...
Where's the fire come from?
Where did that fire...
Oh, my God.
Where did the fire come from?
Oh, there's a grease down there.
Sick.
Sick.
Oh, no, I'm not going to make it.
Oh, I made it.
I don't know where the grease down here.
There's both clean pots up.
Let's take a...
Pop a squat.
We're so back.
We're so back.
Wait, I need to look up the guide again.
I'm going to go back.
I'm going to go back.
I'm going to go back.
I'm going to go back.
I'm going back.
Okay.
Okay.
Got it.
Let's go.
I'm kind of forget...
Open.
Oh, wow, it's this.
Oh.
What the hell?
What are you doing here?
Is that Alexander?
How are you?
How did he...
How the fuck?
How the fuck did he get there?
Where the fuck did this guy come from?
Well, that's convenient.
Yeah, yeah.
What are you doing here, bro?
That thing.
Why don't I ever remember meeting you here?
I never was in this dungeon.
Is this where you can meet him?
Where a festival is being held.
Until I was stumped by that dead end.
My love, I have returned from doing the dishes.
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.
Alright, interesting.
I like how it's a festival just to kill somebody.
Yeah, it's a milling stone, boy.
I have to get so many fucking...
Oh, shit.
Alright.
This is just the exit.
So, let me go...
Fuck my life up with this boss.
I'm gonna fucking suck.
This is gonna take me so long.
He basically just came as a passage.
Oh, it's a magma worm.
This doesn't do the damage.
This is gonna take a while.
Why is it so narrow?
Oh, I didn't push that.
I didn't push this.
Oh, no.
I must stop.
Summon the ash.
Yeah, actually, yeah.
That would take the aggro off of me for a little...
I like how he just falls back asleep.
Yeah, maybe I should summon the ash.
You're still here, bro.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're still here, bro.
What's going on?
Like you said, you were leaving.
What's the sigma?
I didn't even equip the fucking ashes.
It doesn't matter.
I don't know.
Yeah, I was thinking about the meteorite staff
and the rock sling as well.
I was thinking about that.
Okay.
My fucking butt hurts.
Raina, I'm sorry, but you can't be on my lap right now, sweetie.
Mommy's trying to beat a boss in Elden Ring.
She just flicked her tail in annoyance.
Should I do the wolves or the jellyfish?
Which is more effective.
Excuse me.
Jellyfish?
You think?
Raina, where are you?
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
I'm not pressing this button.
I'm not pressing this button.
All right, puppy dog.
Alexander, you want to fucking help me?
You're just going to stand around and be a jar.
All right.
Sick of him.
I'm going to poke his ass.
No, Raina, are you serious?
I can't.
Raina, please.
Raina,INA!
Raina, space, sleep.
All right, here I was locked on.
Okay, arena sweep.
Why could I lock on?
Hello?
Oh.
Whoo!
Oh.
Hello?
Oh.
Woo-hoo!
Ow.
Get him!
Get him!
Sick of him!
I'm going to die.
Get him!
Actually, you know what I should do?
I should actually be using a two-handed morning star.
Cuz...
I don't know, he's dead.
He's only going to do the bleed.
Nope, I didn't mean to do that.
Peace.
This is why bleed is good.
Ow.
That was very nice.
That was very cash money in here.
Ow, Jesus.
Fuck.
What was that?
I see a little boost on that thing.
I use a sword.
You're a lizard.
You don't deserve a sword.
Ow!
Yeah, not even like a third.
Done.
You're not even like near the lava, I don't know what you're saying.
Wait, huh?
Oh, he just a little stompy-stomp.
And I guess so many attempts this will take.
Jesus Christ, you guys think this will take 30 attempts for me?
Oh my God.
You're probably right.
Um...
Oh, I had to press this.
Get him.
No, Jellyfish, get out the way.
How did he already fucking kill him with one hit?
That's not nice.
That's not fair to him.
I don't know.
I'm just going in a circle.
There's a wall there, baby.
Oh, well, sometimes the camera law fucks me.
He's going to stop around in there, then?
Oh, bro.
They're just gathered, bro.
I'm going to die.
I'm stuck in lava.
Come on.
I can't tell what's happening.
Ranged Magic is king.
Amazing that my Glenstone did like fucking nothing.
Does...
Let me just...
I'll try it, but I don't...
I wasn't really doing anything to him.
I wanted to do the bleed,
because then I would get at least a little bit of bleed damage every so hits.
Okay.
Wow, this is doing so much damage.
I'm so talented.
I...
I don't even...
Lava boy over here.
Lava girl.
I'm only a lava boy.
I actually don't think I might lock on,
because I'm just getting stuck with the fucking camera.
Alright, you're cheeky.
Alright, you're fucking cheeky.
I need to heal.
Okay.
Give me your ass.
Oh, why?
Why, cats?
Why?
I'm going to...
Oh my fucking god, Vini.
I swear to fucking god.
Get out of the fucking way.
I was doing better.
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why are you so cute?
I love you.
You smell like food.
Did you just eat?
Cat debuff might be a factor.
Yes, because my cats like to hop up on my desk
and get in front of my display.
Zzz.
And now Boomi's about to take a shit.
They hate me.
My cats hate me.
Um, yeah, no.
Fuck the fucking glint stone.
No, that's not going to work out.
I don't know why I sat down, but it's fine.
Boomi, stop sending me my feet.
It's unnecessary.
Stop, bro.
Stop, stop.
Can you leave my feet alone?
Can you leave that alone?
Thank you.
My brother in Christ.
My brother in Christ.
Please.
Hi, Fiya.
Hi, little girl.
You look so cute over there.
I can't look out from you because you're behaving.
What are you going to go ahead for?
Are you going to stick yourself to my chair again?
Feetsies.
Fiya really likes feetsies.
Sometimes I call her Fida.
She likes fart.
I'm ready to fuck people up.
Ah.
Justice for Boomi.
I'm going the wrong way.
Okay, he doesn't seem to care.
Sorry.
I think the wolves will actually be a little bit easier because I feel like they can move
around a lot faster.
I don't know what I got in my eye yesterday, but I think I cut the inside of my eyelid.
And it is so painful.
Or I got bleach in my eye because I was cleaning stuff.
So who knows?
I don't know.
I don't know if bleach does that.
It really hurt when I tried to wash it out.
I'm going to kill my fillet just right off the rip, bro.
You're going to kill me right off the rip, bro.
I can't see.
I can't see.
I can't see.
I can't see.
I can't see.
The room is so small.
This might take more than 30 tries, boys.
My eye's fine.
I can see out of it.
It just hurts.
And then I flipped my eyelid inside out and it was super fucking red because it felt like
I had a cut in there.
I'm like, did a fucking eyelash slice me and got in my eye or whatever?
I don't...
Okay, I'm going to try it with the wolves instead.
Because I think with the wolves, they'll be able to run around and kind of...
Let's try it.
Open the room.
Dumbass dogs.
Why are you going in the fucking lava?
I don't think I was healing when that happened.
I don't think I was healing when that happened.
Haha!
On guard.
Chicken.
Go on.
Uh, guys...
I don't know if I'm going to get this.
It's hot in the fucking camera.
I don't know.
I know!
Alzeir just hears me dying in the next room.
He's like, I'll see you there!
I'll see you at the festival!
And then just fucking perish in the next room 50 times.
You'd also think like he'd be gone, like once you...
Like, I don't get that.
I don't know why this bleed isn't fucking working right now.
Is the worm resistant to bleed?
What the fuck?
I swear my hip-hop isn't that big.
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm still alive?!
What?!
I thought I was dead!
I just, like, stopped moving!
Okay, fuck the camera.
Fuck the cameras.
Cut the cameras!
I can't even hit you.
I can't even hit you.
No!
Oh, I tried to roll out of the way, but I wasn't close enough.
I don't worry, Mr. Baby Dragon.
If you take too long, we'll break between the hits.
Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
You are right.
That would be correct.
How far did I get first play through?
I won!
I beat the game!
I got the frenzy flame ending!
I'm sorry.
But thank you for the tip.
I know, I got distracted.
Oh, no!
No, my butt!
It's got a headache from that.
You know, for the longest time,
I didn't know Blive had, like, an actual wolf head.
I thought...
I thought I was just wearing a mask the entire time.
I am...
getting out of the fucking way and it's not working.
I got all the damage I did with my Blive, Blive.
Like that.
Whee!
Oh, you like that?
Right in the fucking eye, suck it in it.
I'll leave you with a kiss.
Yeah, you get that.
I'll leave you with a kiss.
This sheebie Muppet needs to violently shake when speaking.
Wait, hold up.
I got you.
Hi, I'm Sheebie.
What's up?
I'm a Muppet.
Fuck your mom.
Um...
Tomo is...
We're gonna make me, like, my arms move, too.
Like, that I, like, shrug my arms.
What the fuck?
That noise.
Oh, it's just sleeping.
That's why it's making a lot of sleeping noise.
And it just wasn't working out.
And I thought it wasn't working out,
so she had already drawn on the layer,
and she was like, ah fuck,
and I was like, oh, it's fine.
Like, I just, like, ring a box.
Sick' cm, boys.
Sick' mm.
Get his ass!
Got his ass!
Get his ass!
Yeah!
Fuck' em up!
I hit his belly.
I hit his belly.
Fuck' em up, fuck' em up!
I'm staying solid...
I'm staying solid.
I'm solid.
Get out of the way...
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way...
Out of the way...
Out of the way, I'm dead.
It's fine.
It's fine.
We're good.
the fourth of the way there.
Maybe a fifth?
Maybe a fifth?
That was pretty cool.
You so cute and funny.
You think I'm cute and funny?
Yeah, that's so nice of you.
Oh my God.
He thinks I'm cute and funny.
I don't know why I have a valid girl accent
when I'm talking like this.
This isn't even my cute and funny voice, is it?
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Um.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Ha.
Hmm.
There must be a better way.
I know I can beat this demon.
I just have to believe in myself.
Oh, fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
He sounded like God Earth.
Ow.
Ow.
Oh, fuck him out.
Don't roll into the fucking lava, Shibi.
Don't roll into the fucking lava.
Oh my God, please.
Oh my God, please.
Oh my God, no.
You have me in a fucking corner, bro.
Oh, fuck your mother.
Fuck your mother so hard.
I hate it here.
I hate it here.
I hate it here.
Darn stream for Magma Worm.
I think I need a snacky.
What is this?
I don't even know what this is.
Adorable cracker.
That's what it says.
That's what my mom called me when I was younger.
Okay.
He smells so bad.
I'm not eating this.
Nevermind.
That smells horrible.
What is this?
Another fucking butter cookie?
Oh, it's a rice cookie, I think.
Rice cracker.
Yup.
That's a rice cracker.
I don't think I like the taste of that.
They sound like God or some sort of neutron when they barf.
Get up puppies.
Get up puppies.
No.
No.
Guys, I don't think I want to be the...
Guys, I don't think I want to be the...
Guys, I don't think I want to read them.
I'm gonna be here a bit.
Move up.
I'm gonna help her.
I hate that you look like you're made of shit.
At least get to the 30 for the bet.
Bring the tummy, bring the tummy, bring the tummy, hold on.
Get him, don't get him.
Mmmmm!
Your beans wouldn't be so much better.

No, jellyfish, get out of the fucking way!
Jellyfish!
Jellyfish, no!
No!
I already knew that was a bad one.
The restaurant was good, the couple runs ago was good.
I know jellyfish did take that entire fucking hit, he's just like, I'll eat this.
I'll eat this and spit it back out of your face in the form of poison.
Black girl, his boy is not, maybe any like that battle music.
Maybe any like that black stripes, sorry white stripes.
The black stripes.

Stepping down, stepping down, kicking down, kicking down, kicking down.

This is the run. I was fucking stuck
I got stuck because the stupid fucking camera lock sometimes I hate locking on because the camera fucks me, bro
I swear to God
It's fine. It's fine. Now, you know, we know what we're doing now, you know, I hope I don't have neighbors
My neighbors don't hear me just screaming at the top of my fucking lungs. I don't think I don't think I have a neighbor below me anymore
I think they moved out
Or
They they still live there, but
This is what I mean, bro, what is this?

Dr. Pepper would be good right about now actually I can use Dr. Pepper. I
Know they got some spicy hot to
It's all right, I got some spicy hot to look it's called jellyfish poison
Okay, I need to not summon him right at the beginning I keep saying that and I keep fucking doing some stupid. Oh
I time that
Oh, it's like hair. What's up with that? Why do you have hair on the edge of your sword?
Why does a giant lizard have a sword in the first place? How did you get the sword?
Who made you the sword? It looks like it was made of the tail of your brethren. I don't know if I like that
You know, I don't if I like that. That's kind of fucked up
You're the dragon you're right you're right. All right, I'm gonna beat the first attack

I
Keep rolling rolling rolling walking rollin rollin rollin rollin come on
Get out of the way
I
I
I
I
Amazing actually I just but like
like 50 different bosses. I already beat the game twice. We're on New Game Plus 3 right now.
It's pretty sick. It's pretty awesome. Everybody's kind of amazed by my skills.
Oh, no. Jellyfish.
Oh, I'm killing my jellyfish too soon because when the jellyfish gets back into the corner,
I'm fucked. I'm dead. I don't know what number are we at. I don't know if I should even bother
with this anymore. Like I'm determined to, but I just don't think realistically I'm not high enough
level and I'm not enough skilled even if I was this level.
Oh, no. Why does he always attack when I summon him?
Because I need him to stack the lava. I don't want him to go back into the corner.
I mean, I'll stack the lava, stack the poison.
When can you fucking jump like that? I have not seen you do this fucking move, bitch.
You four? How dare you?
You don't get to whip around like that.
I can't use that pretty much either.
You done yet?
Come on, bro. You're not just killing me.
This is not a good run. I'm pressing the, like, oh.
Why don't you let me do a paneling for us?
Or do you be a dagger to help with the damage? Maybe.
I'm kind of determined.
Downloading the move set. Locking in.
It's all right. Back it up. Back it up.
Get up. Jump. Jump. Get out of here. Back up. Back up. Pull it back. It's fine.
We're good. Do a little ding-ling.
Yes. Yes.
It's all right.
Isn't there like supposed to be like a super thing I can do?
Like in his eye? I did try like that so many times.
I totally fucking jumped over that.
What? What? What, bitch? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do, bitch?
You're fucking the ass again. You're fucking the ass again.
Leave my jellyfish alone. He's just a little boy. My voice is cracking.
I'm in the eye. I gotta hit the glowy eye. I'm trying to hit the glowy eye.
I'm trying to. Oh no, you took him out.
No.
Oh, no.
All the wrong direction.
I'm trying to get him to charge.
What? He didn't even hit me with anything. He just walked up to me and I was supposed to hurt me.
Oh my god, I pressed the wrong button.
I don't remember what I just want to even have a quick blast.
No, no, no. I was hoping. Oh no, I'm stuck. I'm stuck.
Oh, the poison was doing work. The poison is doing work. It's but it's fine.
The more the closer and the closer I get to know I can do it just by brute forcing it.
Okay, but first, how the fuck do I poke him in the eye to get the extra damage?
I'm doing the charged heavy attack. It's not doing anything. I'm doing left trigger.
I have to light attack him.
Okay, I have to let R1 no charge.
Okay, okay, I'm okay. And I was screwed myself over by that because I didn't just not fucking paying attention.
I'm gonna do this right off the back early pop.
Oh, we got out of the way first.
Damn.
Did he already kill him? How the fuck?
I dodged that. Okay.
Yeah.
That doesn't even do a lot.
Oh, okay.
I have a little temper tantrum over here, bud.
Here, spin around. Oh, yeah, I saw that coming. I saw that spin coming.
I love a forgetful madam. That was better, though. If I can keep jellyfish alive to get that poison,
um, that I think I think I'm good. I think I'm good. I don't know how he died so fast.
If I get up real close to him, right off the river. No. No, be free.
I ate that for you.
Why are you throwing it at your time?
I can't really tell what's going on here. I don't know how to approach this situation.
I kind of, he's already fucking, he's doing this too fast.
Like, I'm kind of confused. He's like doing the magma thing a little bit too fast right off the rip.
And when he does that, it's a bad run.
You know? What the fuck am I kicking? Where did my fucking thing go?
I'm fucking kicking his ass. Fuckin' punch you. Fuckin' duff your ass. Fuckin' fuck you.
Yeah, why is he spamming lava? I don't know if that's fair to you yet.
Uh, well, no, I just started.
I'm getting warm. I'm like cold and warm at the same time.
Fuck you. Fuck you for that. Yeah, she could be helping me. Could be helping me, but no.
Okay, I'm gonna bait him. I'm gonna bait him. I'm gonna masturbate him. I'm gonna masturbate his ass.
No. No, you're supposed to attack me, you fuck. Get his ass. Get his ass.
Oh, no. I'm on fire. I'm on fire.
Okay.
Go.
I definitely dodge that, but go off this.
Stab his ass. Stab his ass. Stab his ass. Get stabbed. Die.
Alright, press a normal button.
There we go, there's that poison buildup.
He did well, he did well.
Fuck, I'm stuck, I'm rolling for all my life.
Stop, are you gonna stop?
I'm gonna raise up.
I can't let Jellyfish have that defeat.
Where am I?
Damn.
Damn, that sucked.
I thought that was a good run.
That was good, I like that, I'm proud of myself.
Thank you guys.
Kinda looks like a bearded dragon with a sword, that's what everybody else was saying.
How about you, I see my Jellyfish, he's really neat, he's just a little guy.
Oh he's almost gonna be dead already, this is a bad run, I'm gonna kill myself.
This is a bad run.
The moment I know that he is too low health because this dude magma runs him into the fucking ground, it's not a good run.
I need that poison to build and it's not building.
If the poison builds and I get the combos, then yeah.
It's gotta be 20, it probably is 20.
I'm not gonna get it in 30, I'm not gonna get it in 30.
I was pretty confident it was.
Yeah, eyes on me buddy, eyes on me.
Why do I have this equipped?
Why?
Give me the leg, that's what I wanted.
Oh no, that's fine, that's fine.
Jellyfish bro you gotta move, oh my god.
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.
I legit almost just threw my controller there.
That's what, I literally almost spiked my fucking controller at that one.
Raina no.
Raina mama's getting angry, she probably senses my anger, she's like I will calm you down.
You're doing great sweetie, I'm determined.
Taking off my fucking clothes, sweating.
You're doing so well but I'm not, why are you guys lying to me?
What the fuck, I didn't know there was lava there.
You think cause it's floating that it wouldn't really be affected by this shit, but it does.
You think that because it's floating the lava wouldn't really touch it, but it does.
It killed me.
I'm tempted to try to get the, I think I'm gonna try to get, actually no I'll stop trying
then we can hit the third when we hit 30 else.
I'll go and try to see if I get the Bloodhounds Fang so I can fuck this dude up so I can get the Moon Veal.
See right off the rip I know it's a bad run when he does this immediately.
I think it's because of my proximity to him.
It triggers it.
Why?
Since when do you do that?
You've done that twice and it doesn't make any sense to me.
He's styling on me now.
I know he's stuck his little sword in his mouth and was like, you bet he dooduh.
Hello?
We're both gonna eat that actually.
I'm actually might gonna die.
It's fine.
It doesn't matter.
I would have died anyways if I got the right one or not.
Yeah, you get him Jellyfish.
Nine damage.
That's a lot of damage.
We're getting there.
I don't know about that.
Sorry, I'm tired.
I don't know, I had this fucking clip too.
Immediately when I summon that he...
Okay, good.
That's fine.
I would rather...
No, don't kill him.
Turn around.
Turn around to me.
Reina, this is not the time.
I love you, but stop.
Oh, there you go.
You're gonna kill me here, Reina.
I can't even see my stats.
She's just rubbing against my plant.
I don't know.
Reina.
Reina, please.
I love you so much.
No idea, but...
I'm doing stuff right now.
I snuggle with you all morning.
What's up?
You rumbling?
Are you trying to calm me down because I'm getting aggravated?
Are you trying to calm me, Reina?
You sense my...
You sense my stress.
Sometimes you just need a cat hug.
Reina actually is very much in tune to my emotions.
If I am very upset, she will immediately...
I think that's why she was kind of stuck to me this, like, yesterday.
It's because, like, since I was sick, she was...
I would, like, take a nap, and she was there, and I'd wake up, she was there.
If I was doing anything, she would just be there.
She's my baby girl.
Okay.
You wanna dance with the devil?
Let's dance.
What is this attack?
He already killed my jellyfish.
I should just leave.
Can I leave? Can I go?
We just...
It's no fair.
I don't like it here.
Let me go through the pee fog.
Reina, is your familiar?
Oh, yes, of course.
Actually, her sister was, like, my familiar.
She'd always sit with me.
Her sister, Solea, was sit with me when I would tear out cards.
Her sister died, uh, about, like, three years ago?
Yeah, four.
Sweet. She was a seal point same as Cat.
Her name was Solea. She was adorable.
I liked her, because she was, like, Reina's, like, clearly my cat,
but Solea was, like, everybody's cat in my family.
Why am I not dancing?
I'm, like, trying to get to its...
Oh, the fire got me.
It was actually going fine, because the jellyfish was doing okay.
Might have been a good run if I didn't get knocked into the fire.
There was a second Reina?
Yeah, her sister.
Her sister reminds me a lot of Fia and Boomi,
and I like to think that she lives on in them with very similar personalities.
It's quite funny.
Okay, if I do him over here, he doesn't seem to get...
I'm locked in.
I don't know what you're spitting at, girl.
Get out of the way, jellyfish.
I don't know why you're standing there.
Can you dodge, jellyfish?
Oh, I can't hit. That's for sure.
I rolled. I pressed roll, but I was locked in.
I'm stabbing you, the gluay guy, sort of dog.
That gives him a little bit of time to build that.
Poisoned build, so we're fine.
That's what I wanted. Maybe I should just pay back and let the poison build.
He done? Like, what is...?
Oh, my God.
Computer is struggling right now.
What is this? Why do you keep spamming the same fucking attack, dude?
Oh, my God, I'm stuck.
I don't understand that.
I'm going to spam attack, you can spam attack, I want that.
I'm going to attempt to just run in circles and let the fucking poison get him.
Kind of wishing I had the dragon's breath.
Sometimes it just locks onto his head and I'm kind of frustrated by that.
Oh, my God.
Locked in.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I thought I jumped out of the way.
That's the fucking karma, dude.
You see it messing up my attacks because I try to lock on, but it just...
Yeah.
I don't...
It's so weird.
I hate that I'm angled.
I don't like that the point just always attacks his head.
I'm trying to go for his leg and then it just pulls him.
It pulls it and it makes it go for his head.
Yeah, S-Talk has an issue.
I never really use a piercing weapon for that reason.
Come over here, come over here.
No, no, no, no, no.
You better come over fucking here, bro.
You better fucking come over here.
Great, how am I supposed to get to a fucking eye like this, huh?
Oh, wow, that's fucking great, isn't it?
I love that for me.
I love that so much for me.
Better do it again.
I better fucking do it again, I swear to God.
That's so dumb.
That's so dumb.
Did you see that?
How the fuck am I supposed to get to the spot if it's the fucking flames right in the way, dude?
Oh, my fucking god, bro.
Holy shit.
I'm enthusiastic, she viewers me.
She's going to pull the fucking flames immediately, immediately, immediately when I summon.
You hear this?
It's me gripping the fucking of my controller right now.
There's a muffin, it's really funny.
I'm going to kill him for you.
No, where's the fun in that?
Where's the fun in that?
I don't want anybody doing anything for me unless they ask.
I want to do this for myself because I'm going to feel so fucking good, so full of dopamine after I finish this.
Because I'm going to beat him.
I'm going to beat him.
It's not worth it, it's not worth it to you, it's worth it to me.
This is just, I'm sorry, I'm determined, this is how I game.
When I'm determined, I want to beat, I'll see something through.
And you know, I wanted to get to 30.
I think I'm at, I don't know if I'm at 30.
Let me know how many times have I died.
Because if I'm at 30, I'm going to go try to get the bloodhounds back because I want the moon veil.
I'm at 46, legit.
Okay, I'll do one more run.
And then I'm going to go, I'm going to do something else.
Uh, what am I doing?
Alright.
I love that.
Oh, oh, you're a little saucy boy, aren't you, with your little dive?
Aren't you cute.
I'm going to do it again.
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Huh.
We're just opening over here.
There's always like a little opening left behind.
What is the worm weak against, by the way?
I should have, I should have fucking figured that out.
Right on cue.
It's fine.
I'm always in fire, I can't get him.
He's like that, oh, he's dog piling my fucking dude.
Yeah, like I can't.
Okay.
Can I stop aiming at his fucking head?
Oh, it's so dumb.
I love how differently you and strong you play this game.
What do you mean?
She really gets as many times as her age.
No, wait, I need to read what the fuck you guys are saying.
I'm in solar style.
This box is versus everything.
You're right, I think I remember, I think I remember that.
Excuse me.
I'm 56, guys.
I'm 56, you guys know this.
That was weak.
I keep sitting down like it's fucking Liza P and that I don't need that.
Oh, I'm in the fucking, no.
Oh, I have to be.
I can't teleport out.
I have to walk out.
Okay, that's fine.
Okay.
I wanted to play for longer, but I can feel myself getting a migraine.
I forget, where was that jail?
Oh my god, where was it?
I don't know.
I totally forgot it's over here.
Oh, you don't sound like you're 56.
Yeah, I'm 56, bro.
I'm pretty old.
You don't like your hag?
I'm like, yeah, I'm a fucking hag.
Uh...
Sorry to put Rena on the floor again because she's...
She's trying to jump up on me.
I wish I could see.
How many markers did I have?
Okay, just that one.
Have Blive help?
No, I don't need Blive help.
I will ask for help when I want it.
Ugh, I'm going to start ignoring people if they're like,
let me help or you should do this to do it.
I'm doing it by myself the way I want to do it.
If I need help, I will ask.
It's that simple.
I'm always in my prime, indeed.
Maybe I can use a jellyfish on this, dude.
Oh, I'm going to need to do that.
Alright.
Okay.
Okay.
Alright, I'm pressing breathe.
Come on, my nose is itchy.
My nose is itchy, please.
Let me carry you, Queen. No more.
I think that's what I said.
He got that dog in him.
What does it count?
It she does.
I don't get it sleeping.
So none of these count, Raina.
Please stop.
Why don't you go lay down, Raina?
I don't want to have to put you in the crate.
You're moving around too much.
I don't want you reopening your little thing in the water.
That's a spry lady at 14.
I felt like I was going to do something before this.
Are they trying to give me an intervention?
That's stupid.
I can't use a summoning thing for this.
That's stupid.
Can I? No.
Alright.
Me and you, Darwin.
Oh, shit.
Well, this is awkward.
I just wanted to be friends.
I heard you had that dog in you,
and I was just wondering if you
wanted to put that dog in me too.
What the fuck am I saying, bro?
I can't hit you. You're too fast.
I think I had blood loss.
Sheebie! Oh my god, it's Freddie!
Everybody!
Sheebie, Ola. It's me, Funtime Freddie,
and welcome to Elton...
Trat is going by too fast. I can't read it.
Hold on.
I have to start over.
Sheebie, Ola.
It's me, Funtime Freddie,
and welcome to Elton Ring Special Edition
and Diamond Edition.
Thank you, Freddie.
Somebody said no profile picture?
I want to see what the profile picture is.
Go to channel.
That's pretty sick.
That's pretty gnarly.
I like it.
I like it.
Sheebie, get up the furry allegations, please.
You know, Toma is trying to teach me
just to embrace being a furry.
I'm still resistant.
But, you know...
Maybe I'll get some,
you know, sweet furry lovers
in my audience.
You know how that can be.
Diamond Edition? Yes, Diamond Edition.
Don't doubt
what Freddie says, bro.
Okay?
Now it'll attack.
Attract.
What is that?
Explain. Just beat Mogue.
Nice job!
Good on you, bro.
Furry Oilers?
There are furry Oilers?
I'm sorry, that's a funny concept to me.
Furries do have a lot of money.
Because I got lots of good art.
My friend paid off her college tuition
with just making very sexy art.
Hola, chica.
Oh, you're weak against this.
You're very weak against this.
Ow.
I see to stay alive.
Oh, I see to stay alive!
Ow.
Oh, I'm so close.
No, no, no, no.
Okay, okay, this is easy.
This is easy, guys.
I can do this one. You guys see how well I dodge.
Aren't you impressed with my dodging ability?
I'm very good at dodger.
Never knew.
Wait, Muppets are considered furries?
All right, guys, I'm a furry.
You hear her first.
Shibi, furry.
Easy clap, easy clap, easy clap, easy clap, bro.
Easy peasy.
I really forgot he was weak to magic shit.
Does any furry want to be my sugar daddy?
I have cat medical bills to pay.
Oh, that would miss him.
I'm trying to keep him, like, here.
Oh, every time I heal,
I literally have to do it in, like, one run.
Why roll into that one?
Come out.
Oh, I just noticed that.
Come on.
Oh, fuck, I was getting too eager.
I thought I was going to kill him.
There we go.
Hand over your fucking sword.
Thank you.
I need that. Appreciate it.
Let's fucking go.
See, when I'm not fucking over-leveled,
I mean, under-leveled,
for like a dude, I can usually get them.
So proud of me. Thank you.
Thank you, guys. I killed something.
I did it.
That's why he wasn't trying to dodge.
Well, him, like, dodging is different.
I don't know if this
scales properly.
I need more strength.
I fucking love this shit.
Oh, it's so fucking sexy.
Oh, fuck it.
Oh, yes, daddy.
Sorry.
All right.
Cool.
Nice.
Noink. Wow.
A whole zero runes.
Thank you, Madika.
I'll be taking this sword.
And I'll be taking- I forget
I don't need to go to a grace to teleport.
I'm such a fucking-
All right, let's see.
If this helps.
Why do you look like a Muppet?
I don't know why the fuck do you look like a Muppet?
Fucking Julio Passos. Fuck you.
Get out of here.
I'm sorry.
I'm over-tired.
I'm raging at a game.
It's not the fucking time.
All right.
Yeah.
Doxic is effort.
Do you have enough strength to wield that even two-handed?
Yeah.
All right.
Because my strength is at like 12
and you need 15.
Oh fuck, it's at 11.
That's fine.
We'll find out.
We'll find out.
Let's go.
Can I get a Hoyah?
Yah.
Come on.
No.
Oh fuck, this is worse.
I like this one because you can
jump away.
Oh god, what is this?
I think I need more strength, guys.
I'm stuck.
Oh no.
He's gonna fucking kill me.
No, it needs 15.
Does it?
I don't know. Let's find out.
Well...
Shit.
All right, well...
Let's try this.
Because again, bleeding.
We'll try to get that blade damage.
I'm so determined to fucking
beat this guy.
If you do a heavy attack after a back dodge,
you do a follow-up.
Although it doesn't really matter at this point.
Since I don't have the stats.
We'll just see if we can keep it up with this.
What the fuck was that?
I don't know what happened.
I think you two handed the fang.
I just two handed it and it fucked me up.
I only did 14 damage.
I don't have enough strength, bro.
I don't have enough strength.
My little fucking muppet arms can't lift up
the fucking huge ass thing.
Sorry, I'm cursing a lot.
Okay.
Spits it out.
He's my fucking friend.
You can't dog pile
on the jellyfish. You're cheating.
Take off your hacks.
My neighbors are probably sick of me.
I'm gonna fucking beat your ass.
Beat your ass.
Beat your ass.
Beat your ass.
Beat your ass.
Beat your ass.
I don't care.
I don't care if I'm in lava. I'm beating your ass.
Anyone with one strike
can keep me in for it.
Must be hard playing with the controller using a muppet.
It is very difficult.
Um.
I realize that I just lost all my runes doing that.
Uh, I don't really know how many runes
I got from that though, so I don't really care.
Um.
I just, I need a good weapon, you know.
Oh
See immediately immediately I can only kick you
Can you like stop you stop dogfiling on the jellyfish, I don't know what is your deal, bro
I'm really gonna fucking kill myself. I'm gonna do it right now. I'm killing myself
And they'll do the force
Wait, do I have the ratting in source ill on
I
Take more damage
No, I fucking love that so much, okay
Let's try it, let's try it
Awkward I definitely take more damage guys. That's for sure. I can assure you that I
Am ripe for the damage
Let me talk. I'm like trying to do shit and you're like
Can't even get close to you because there's lava fucking everywhere
Can you
Can you like stop having a temper tantrum for like just a second so I can like poke you in the ass
How did you already kill him
What
I'm pressing heal
Okay, I'm doing a little bit more damage
I'm gonna search for her
So get shimmy lock in should be easy. Yeah
She's training us out for a big wizard. I'm getting epi, but I want to finish this
Just five hours of me trying to beat a fucking lizard
I
I
I
Just need to keep him alive
I might not make it
Keep sick in him
Now damn I am definitely taking it
Okay, okay, we run around run around
Yeah, I didn't make it fuck
It's not fun
It's fine, you got him poison that's all I wanted
Sound like fucking Elmo are you done? Oh my god, I'm running into the lava
Bro, what is
Only human should be allowed to spam attacks not AI this this is ridiculous. I can't even
Oh actually I was better being close up
Sorry, my pinky toe was in a flame of lava
Just couldn't win for hours. Oh man
Hey, I ruined my Elton string stream. Nice title. I'm definitely considering
I'm probably gonna take a nap for a little bit wake up send alarm beat this guy off stream
And then we'll play in the morning
Oh
Well, I'm just gonna stay here until that goes away
I'm kind of terrified. My son just died. I heard his screams of jellyfish terror
That's really too sad
I'm just gonna let him kill me
24 hour elder during stream
What you first tried off stream, I would hate that I was so pissed like nobody fucking saw this
Cuz that's that's literally what happened when I was finding a boss on lines of p. I fought it off stream
And then like it took me three more tries and I got it and I'm like very fucking serious
Fucking clown bitch
Oh
I'm stuck as you can see I'm in like fucking stop lock shit. You got this. Yeah sure
Sure
I'm so late. I'm so
I'm so like
Autismally focused on this now. I'm sorry like I'm just like I need to finish I need to get it done
I need to be to me. I need to be to me. I need it. I need it. I need it
I need it now. I need it now. I can't sleep until I do. I have to I have to I have to I have to be
I have to you
Okay, fly jellyfish fly
Out
Really
Why do I feel like it knocked back harder, it's not even like I get extra damage. I just feel like I get knocked back harder
Oh, we just turned around and killed him
I
Love it when I clip into the thing it's great
I
Such a strong co-wonka woman, I don't know about that. I
Am definitely doing more damage because he jellyfish to brody it lasts as long
Fuck you
Not doing shit again
Like I could be like making shit I could be doing a bunch of other stuff, but you know, we don't do that out here
Okay, you see he didn't get trapped in the fucking door this time
I was gonna take the heat off of him so he can continue to spam the poison
To get out of this fire to go away, that's fine perfect
I
There's lava here, I can't really do much I don't think you got poison
It's fine
It's literally all dependent on if he gets poisoned I can beat him which sucks
But it's just because I'm underleveled it's a fact
I
Know that worked out
Quickly blood loss, please
Oh fuck am I dead am I dead? No, I'm not dead
Holy shit, holy shit
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oh
Oh
It's doing that weird thing where it locks on
And only his head instead of it's happening just what I want
Oh
No, not the brazier
No
I
No, no, no, no, no, please no, oh brother
I
Think I can do it out jelly. I'm wondering if I should wait till the towards like I get him half done
Feels less than half the damage, okay good to know I wasn't paying attention to my my FP to be honest with you
Okay, we'll try it without jelly and for a little bit
I can get him trapped in a corner when he does that he should be actually
Fine to manage because then he won't be doing so much lava everywhere
This
So you can get a head start
Maybe because in the lava run the heat the automatically the AI aggro's the thing what you've been doing a lava run
Oh
Sorry
Okay, right off the rip. We're just he did not want me touching his booty hole
Okay
Bro, I'm getting my shit kicked in right now
Let's see, let's see if he's okay over here. He doesn't wander into fucking lava like he's doing right now actually
Okay, yeah, uh jellyfish is gonna die
That was fucking waste
Oh brother
Yeah
I know that was a better rate for that one
I
Don't even want the moon veil. I just want to kill him. I just want to kill him
Time is it 11 fuck
Alexander only you would fucking help me
What if I spawn it right on him
I
I'm getting too eager, I'm sorry, I just want to kill him.
This will actually be a good run if I never run.
I should put on some fire-resistant shit, to be honest with you.
Why are you doing this multiple times?
I'm stuck.
I'm already down to the blasts, I just don't know why I'm bothering.
Actually, this is helpful because when I do this, I can immediately actually dodge out of the stuff, and I'm not using it.
This spawn on top of him seems good, it seems like that worked actually.
Okay, let me ask him nicely to die, I'll try that next.
I would appreciate it if you died nicely, calmly, died, that would be really nice.
If you could, that would really be so great, I would really appreciate that.
It would be cool if he didn't kill my friend.
Two, that would be super nice, but I don't know if you can be trusted with that.
I'm stuck, I'm in the swamp, I'm fine.
Ow, that wasn't nice.
Ow.
I don't think it worked.
I've heard a woman ask me to die, I probably won't.
Excuse me, could you please, K-Y-S, kiss your sister, and I just show them a picture of Amy, and then he just licks, I don't think.
I opened you, I'm jumping on you, I'm jumping, ow.
Ow.
That's fine, anyways, okay.
You get him, Jilly, I'm gonna be dead on the other side.
I don't think bosses run out of stamina, but thank you.
Inside of a dragon is kind of hollow, WTF.
Riddle me this, riddle me this, Batman.
If I went to dragon place and got the dragon head that does the blight, do you think that would be effective?
I would, would I need more arcane for that?
I'm not sure.
Kind of wish I had some coffee, because I want to keep playing.
We need arcane, yeah, no shit, rotten breath, yes.
We would need more arcane.
Face in arcane.
See, I'm going to use some jump to essentially move that out of a large way to those attacks.
Now while we're lying, it's going to be a throw-up, which while I do get sloppy, I do hit quite a few times, which I could have otherwise avoided.
It's so impressive.
As I said, the house starts with the jiggy-tarnas here, and my brand-new strategy is to move some relief to the place we can to be guessed at damage-race this boss to his hand.
If I take a massive hit there, the only thing that I'm not going to be using is spirit summons, and that's mainly because they make the boss unpredictable.
I know what the boss is going to do in the kind of room-space for this boss.
Oh, I knew it.
And if I have spirit summons, it's essentially going to pull it to make the boss do something to jump on a low attack.
So I'm not going to be using a low-bottom smash attack, which you can very well use that if I want to.
If I want to.
Just go for standing palestons attacks, standing on low attacks to just build.
And I can say, though, is that you're sure that you don't get yourself too close on a low blow.
This boss loves to do that, working in tight waves.
Use his mag at every map.
Make a move, and she's able to rep the direction.
To realize you're surrounding herself at night.
So this boss loves to do this attack, two, three times a move, and three times a move.
He does it twice, but I don't get kicked in this fight.
Sorry, I'm learning.
I didn't realize he does a lot of jumping.
Like he just jumps to avoid the ground pound.
Okay.
All right, let's try it.
Studying Sun Tzu in some of the Bible.
Studies.
Oh, yeah.
No, I love studying like move sets.
I think scale.
That's I think that's why I like this game a lot because I didn't know I like those things until I played this game.
Okay, we're not.
We're just gonna.
Yeah, whatever.
Fucking hell.
My eye is itchy.
My eyes itchy.
Hold on.
My eyes itchy.
My eyes itchy.
I realize if I stay in one place, he also stays in one place.
He's gonna do it a third time.
Oh, I timed that incorrectly.
It's fine.
Oh, I didn't do that.
So he does a jump when he ground pounds, but I don't know the timing for that yet.
Jesus, please let me get up.
Why am I?
My timing is all fucked up.
I think because I'm too tired.
Since when do you spam this attack?
Hello?
You know what?
I think I'm too tired.
Okay, we're playing tomorrow bright and early.
You better be ready, boys.
I'm gonna take a nap.
I'm gonna wake up.
I'm gonna play some more.
This boss will be dead in God for the time.
And then in the morning, I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.
Just stay in the lookout.
All right.
So I'm gonna say bright and early.
Hey, damn.
No kidding.
I don't know.
I'll be around.
If you guys don't have plans for 4th July or your U.K. or Euro or whatever you are,
we are hanging out or playing some melding ring.
My head hurts.
I need to sleep.
Um, yeah, yeah.
Today's your birthday.
Oh my God.
Happy birthday.
Good for you.
Aren't you happy you're still on this earth?
I'm happy you're still on this earth.
Your town is already celebrating that.
That's, yeah.
I think that's why I swear I thought I heard fireworks.
Oh, it's cool.
I'm going to see.
So they do the fireworks like in my town center and I can see that from my apartment
building.
So it'll be really cool.
I can just look outside and see them.
Yeah, I'm just like very determined when it comes to games.
Like I've had friends sit and watch me play.
Um, and they're just like, why don't you just do this or that or whatever and like
come back to it or whatever.
I'm like, no.
Like I won't lie.
I was definitely that person that determinedly powered through tree sentinel the first time
I played a hundred because I thought I had to beat him.
So I get it.
Um, I'm just, I just like to see things through, you know, gotta hit that brick wall till it
falls over a hundred percent.
I'm bashing my head through that shit.
You have no idea.
Uh, well, I hope you enjoyed.
Um, I know I did.
I love this game.
I kind of just want to stay up.
I don't have to fucking.
I hate.
Well, I love sleeping.
Like I took like a fucking like three hour, four hour nap today.
I don't know how I'm still tired.
My body's just like, stop.
Um, you love watching people play.
I'm gonna watch me do it.
I do.
I hope you guys enjoy my very colorful commentary.
I know for a fact this video will be fucking tomorrow.
Oh, what are you doing?
She's like walking around like she's up to something.
What are you doing, lady?
Sneaky.
Um, but I hope you, I hope you have a good night or a good day or a good evening or morning
or dusk or dawn or afternoon or early afternoon.
I'll be back tomorrow in Muppet form.
Please check out what is high on heart stream.
They are very entertaining.
I do like her.
Um, and please check out.
I love her.
She made me my Muppet self.
You got amazing Muppet madam today.
Look how nice my little Muppet boobies are.
Her stuff is pinned.
Please check out her Twitch.
She is so lovely.
She's so sweet.
One of the comfiest streamers I've ever watched and also a great friend of mine.
She's helped me a lot when I first heard of VTubing.
I look up to her.
She's awesome.
Please check her out.
All right.
I almost, I watched like Markiplier play like Slay the princess the other day and I literally
subconsciously almost went, until the next video.
Bye.
I'm so fucking tired, dude.
Slay the princess is a good game too.
I would love to play Slay the princess on stream.
Um, oh, I'm so tired.
Okay.
Please don't go.
I don't want to go.
You know I don't want to go.
No, I always want to hang out with you guys.
Sheepie Plier?
I'll be sick.
Um, again, uh, thank you so much and don't think I'm not like mad or anything.
If when you help, I appreciate it.
Trust me.
I'm not mad at anybody.
It's all jokes.
I just, I get a little toxic when I play Elden Ring.
It is what it is.
Guys should have seen me play fucking Counter-Strike.
Holy shit, bro.
Oh my God.
Um, start next stream.
My name is Sheepie Conplier.
Hello, my name is Sheepie Conplier.
You love the toxicity?
You like Amy Madame?
It's funny.
I don't think people would like to watch me rage, but people like to watch me rage.
I just, oh, it's so funny.
I need to eat something.
I need to eat something.
I need to eat something.
Actually, I'm not really hungry.
I'm still a little nauseous.
I think maybe they'll have some more crackers.
Ever since I, there's like, like the, these weird knockoff, um, cheese crackers, and I
smelled them and they made me nauseous again.
So I kind of don't want to eat.
Uh.
Well, there's the water.
Hello, everybody.
My name is Sheepie Conplier, and today we'll be playing Elden Ring.
Top of the order to you laddies!
I haven't watched Jacksepticeye in the longest time, but he is someone that I should watch
for this because I know he fucking loves FromSoft games.
Welcome back to some more Elden Ring.
I know I need to, I'll just start ripping off other VTubers and YouTubers intros and
outros and just assimilating them into my own.
Oh, hi, Whopper!
I don't know, I can't even do the laddies voice.
Uh, I'm a little tired, guys.
I'm a, I'm a fucking Muppet.
I'm gonna start calling people Muppets.
You're a fucking Muppet.
Fia, are you, what are you doing?
I'm turning EU?
What do you mean?
You fucking Muppet.
I don't say Muppet.
Muppet.
Muppet.
Maybe stalling to talk maybe.
Does any of you guys want to talk me in?
I'm like real tired.
I need to be carried to bed.
Um, I got this like new lingerie set, not like lingerie, it's more like just like
from, um, Savage X Fenty, which is like one of my favorite brands.
It's so comfy, like this is a bra, I feel like I could sleep in.
It's so comfy.
I'm squeezing my own boobies.
Um, and like the underwear is comfy too.
And then I'm wearing a robe.
And that's all I'm wearing.
And then you got my little Muppet body.
Imagine my little Muppet body in lingerie.
How does that make you feel?
I'm tempted to permanently become a Muppet.
I might just tell Strani, just Muppetize me captain, you know?
I'm super soft.
I have like velvety faux rabbit fur.
Nice you mentioned it.
It doesn't, to be honest, it still doesn't fit properly because like I just, I think
I'm just in denial about my cup size.
I've never been over a triple D, but I think I may be bigger than a triple D.
So it is what it is.
It's just really comfy though.
I think it's because it doesn't have a wire in it.
And I'm like, it is nice.
But it doesn't have like, I couldn't wear this with like outside.
It would just suck.
It would just like my boobies would be flopping everywhere.
Just Muppet me the fuck up, bro.
Muppet the fuck up, bro.
Muppet the fuck up.
I think everybody needs to Muppet up.
Is there anything that they know existed?
Again, I just have a giant hole.
So, uh, you with that as you mutt, you wish.
Well, not as you wish as I wish, if anything.
I'm in control here.
Confused, horny.
Feels strange.
Ah!
Are you horny here?
Or do you like some of my Muppety Muppet body here?
I have a big gaping Muppet hole just for you.
Wait, who truly is in control if you're out of Muppet?
Who the fuck is holding?
Do you not see my own hand holding up my Muppet body?
Like you're Jennifer Carly just a Muppet.
Jennifer Carly.
Are you scared?
No, pick your Bible back up.
I want you to stroke your Bible.
Really look at the cover.
Pour over the pages.
And, uh, I should have covered my Muppet body.
I have a big gaping Muppet.
I have a big gaping Muppet.
I have a big gaping Muppet.
The temptation of the Muppet.
Yes, what did you call it?
Imagine my smooth little Muppet's hands touching your face.
Imagine my smooth little Muppet's mouth.
Isn't it you?
And your lippies?
I guess now is a bad time to say I was working on something.
What are you working on?
You're working on a Muppet for yourself?
Muppet's gonna feel like a starch sock we're working on.
I did say earlier, use me like one of your socks.
Use me like one of your French socks.
Oh, you'll see.
Please make this an ASMR role play.
Are you sure?
You think this stream is getting demonetized?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Like my Muppet-y bobbies.
You like my beauty mark, my Muppet-y boobies.
It's pretty nice.
Oh, you'll see.
I'm scared.
What is she cooking up?
I'm tempted to draw a Muppet smut.
Smut it, if you would.
Somebody turn off my computer for me right now.
It's not the Muppet.
I mean, it is the Internet.
You're right.
Rule 34 exists.
Learn.
Learn?
Learn?
Lord have mercy.
Jamie, please tell me you heard of the term Muppet-necking.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What is Muppet-necking?
Is it when you like, nosle someone's neck and you're just like...
You know?
How do I save?
System.
Oh, look.
I'm going to quit.
Yes.
Six hours.
Exactly.
Let's go.
Six hours, one second.
Oh, my God.
From software.
I can't be controlling the Muppet, but it's the Muppet control me.
They're just my little puppets on strings.
They're all puppets in my hair room.
They're all Muppets in my hair room.
They're all going to feel like starch socks by morning.
That's all I'm going to say.
Muppet-she-be-muppet-get-me-wrung-burn-a-light.
I've never felt felt like this before, baby Jesus.
I have a hundred percent cashmere.
Yeah, I can step down by my...
I don't have any legs, but...
I have permission to put my hand up.
No, only Peepies.
Peepies on there.
I didn't know I needed that.
I hope you are vigorously stroking yourself right now to my Muppet self.
You better.
It is a challenge.
Can you?
Can you?
Can you read the Bible to this Muppet boy?
I want you to...
You beat your hand inside and you feel something pulling you in.
It's my Muppet.
Wait, that doesn't work.
Muppet-muppet-tussi?
How do you guys fucking clip in this shit?
Wait, no, don't do it.
My mussy?
My Muppet-tussi?
Yeah.
You're gonna read the Bible to Muppet-chibi?
Yes.
Yes.
You cannot read the Bible to anything else besides Muppet-chibi.
Muppet-chibi is for God.
Imagine.
He's getting way out of your hand.
Your hand, it's up my ass.
I'm a Muppet.
I'm a Muppet.
He has stretched my legies.
He has piggy hooves.
I see why adults call out Muppet-muppet day now.
Shibby please, Shibby please, what?
Yes.
Just place it.
What is your Bible?
It's in my Muppet-y mouth.
I promise you that Muppet-y slubby-tubby.
The Muppet-toppy.
I'm a Muppet.
I don't need fucking stuffing.
Muppets don't have stuff, actually, in my hand.
In my mouth, you can stuff them.
I don't know.
I suppose my Vavity Muppet mouth.
I can't do my Patreon voice.
It has to be a higher pitch in order for me to do that.
My Vavity Muppet mouth.
You want to make me a starch sock by learning?
I think I'll let you touch my Muppet-y buttons if you insist.
Go on.
Touch them.
Cut them in your little hand.
They are soft, are they not?
I'm made from the finest cotton, harem.
The Muppet chest is...
Yes, yes it is.
I am dead as cannon.
If you squeeze it, it makes a little...
Wait.
I was hoping I had a squeaky toy thing, but I don't.
That would have been really comical timing.
Fuck.
My tentacle is just staring me in the face.
I don't have anything within reach that can make a squeaky noise.
Man in a tentacle.
Coming into the...
I'm tired.
Hi, I'm Sheeby Cottonbum, and you're watching VLR Channel.
Bye-bye.
Brain shutting down.
A booba has a squeaker.
I'm gonna squeeze my own booba, actually.
Okay.
This is pay-picking.
What, excuse me?
Muppet furry PNGTuber.
We made a lot of products today.
Anyways, it's been fabulous, everyone.
I hope you enjoy today's Elden Ring Strip,
or I'll see you tomorrow.
At what time?
I don't know.
It'll be a gorilla.
Ooh, ah-ah-ah.
Good night.
And farewell.
I'm gonna muck-wuck-wuck on you.
Muppet fidget-tree?
Thank you, boy, for the T9.
Okay.
I guess I'll go now.
I guess this is where...
I wish I had one of those, like,
comical hooks to pull me slowly to the side.
Excuse you.
Why is it talking about fucking multiplayer anyways?
Exactly, Boomi.
Exactly.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
Now.
Now.
Yeah, you still smell pretty stinky.
Even with my muppet nose,
I can tell that you smell like a...
muppet-y...
mupp-puss.
Muppet.
Muppet.
Muppet.
