trabaj   review
but I was so excited for this project from the moment of its inception and I even said that in my video
I was like, I just want to be a part of this. I just want to be part of something different.
I want to be part of this company that's going to make waves.
I want to be part of this company that's going to set a whole new standard for V-Tubing
and I hope that we do. I know it's only been, it's only my second day out here
but part of V-SUCKY. Hi, welcome to V-SUCKY. We'll give you some SUCKY SUCKY.
I was very excited to be a part of this in my interview with...
So I got the email and it was April's Fool's Day and I'm just like, this is a joke.
Somehow someone figured out that I applied because I kept it on the DL
and they sent me a joke email but it wasn't.
And then I had the interview and then I hear...
and I'm expecting to talk to some run-of-the-mill lady who's just like,
Hey, so you're applying for V-LUR here. I'm going to ask you these questions.
Tell me about yourself, blah blah blah blah blah.
And it was strongy. I was like...
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
But actually I was pretty... I got my whole... I had questions ready.
I was going in. As you know, I was an office bunny.
I know what I'm getting into. What color is my underwear?
It should be cotton moth. That just sounds like I'm a snake.
Like I'm a... like I'm... I was some sort of... it's going to be a snake.
Like, I'm a shibby cotton moth.
Would you like to be wrapped up in my scales?
Why do I sound like Rita Rapulza?
Um...
Lawmio for Gem 2. Lawmio for Gem 2.
But I heard her voice.
And I was like...
Is that... is that strongy cuttles?
Is that the strongy cuttles?
Excuse me.
The interview was great. She literally was just like, yeah, so you got it.
I'm like, huh? You're joking. And she's like, yeah, that's it.
Okay. Oh, she's like, here's the model.
And I'm like, oh, okay.
And I'm like, do you want to ask me anything?
Like, I could just be... I could be a crazy person.
Like, I could just... you're just gonna...
And she's like, no, you're good.
She's like, you're the person I wanted immediately.
I was like, oh, that's actually like really,
really freaking nice.
It was really nice.
She's been a creator I've looked up to for a very long time.
And I know the other girls can say the same.
And just to hear her be like, you were a first choice.
I was impressed with your video. I was this, I was that.
And I had applied to many companies before.
Because I'm like, I'm never going to get in.
I'm just going to do whatever.
I applied to, I think, 10 different auditions.
And I'm generally happy I failed each one.
Because I wouldn't want this any other way.
It was great.
And me knows what I'm talking about.
And meeting all the girls, I was like,
everybody's so freaking talented.
Like, Emmie's talented, Icey's talented,
Azura's voice is pure fucking sex, dude.
Sorry, I had a burp.
Yeah, I'm trying.
He's not the only freaking burp in this company.
Let's see how long it takes for me to rip ass or something.
Burp a corp.
And I'll go right up to the mic.
And I'll do it.
It runs in the family.
But yeah, I'm really glad to be one of the daughters.
One of the whore daughters.
Although it's kind of funny.
People thought, oh bear, condition just kicked on.
We're just like, we're just going to be whores.
24-7.
I'm going to be little in my doodaw right here, right now.
No, like, I'm also a normal person.
I'm also like, you can chat with me,
and then, you know, you can go to Patreon,
and that's great, you know?
It's...
Hey, yo, what's up?
What, what's she saying?
All right, hear me out.
That'd be, you know,
and like my hair already kind of has like that snake-like appearance.
I don't know.
I can hear the, yeah, it's, it's loud.
It's like 80 degrees outside.
Leave me alone.
I kicked onto her debut.
Whatever.
I have my cat next to me.
My handsome little man.
He is sleeping in a bed.
I'll have a cat cam eventually.
So you guys can see my little boy.
This is, I have Boomi next to me.
Boomi King of Umashu,
because I am a,
I am a, I would call the last Airbender fan.
And then, yeah, the cat name drop.
The cat name drop.
Hold on.
I'm not actually, wait.
I'm not, let me, let's just,
I'm getting ahead of myself.
Ow, I hit my knee again.
It's because my legs are crossed.
I'm trying to sit all seductively in my chair.
It's not working out.
Fuck you.
Cat talks.
Let's go to my lore.
I'm going to pull myself up in the lore.
So you can just break down scene by scene.
Hello.
Where am I?
I need to manually play it.
Hold on.
Let me just, where am I?
Who am I?
You also will learn that I have fucking ADHD
and I forget what I'm doing.
I think it's, no.
It's dark.
Mommy, I can't see.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Just take it.
Just don't worry about it.
Don't worry.
Just bend over and take it.
You don't have to question anything.
Okay.
F my annoying ass voice.
I realize I go a lot deeper for when I record stuff.
There it is.
Whoopsies.
Give me just a, there we go.
When I'm nervous, I do lots of different voices.
It's just me.
What the fuck?
You know, I will constantly slip into a Scottish accent
because of Strani.
I got bad Aqualalia where you just mimic voices.
I usually mimic accents.
You're going to get a lot of cat mo.
I'm a fucking dork.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm a dummy, mommy.
I'll step on you.
I'll step on you so far.
I'm going to kick your fucking teeth in.
Don't get me started.
But I'm also a bit stupid.
I'm a blonde.
Don't forget that.
Anyways, hold on.
Let me just, okay.
So, like I was saying, I'm going to keep bunny.
It's like, hang in there.
And I'm really depressed.
You know, I really identified with this valley bunny girl.
Oh my God.
Why?
You don't like this voice?
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're such a fucking little bitch.
Am I allowed to swear this much?
Am I going to get demonetized?
Immediately, when I get monetization, probably.
Because my titties are too fat and so is my ass.
And I swear a lot.
I'm sorry.
Like, I'm going to bully you.
Do you like sit by yourself at lunch?
Don't you like have any friends?
No?
What a fucking loser.
Wow.
What the fuck?
There's a dog barking out.
I hate my apartment building.
Yo, shut your fucking dog up.
I'm about to scream out my balcony.
Okay, anyways.
Like I said, I have ADHD.
A doctor said I got ADHD.
I don't know what that means, but I got 80 of them.
I need a drink.
He got that dog and I'm a wolf.
That's a spark.
School bully ASMR.
Hell yeah.
Okay.
3D.
That's very sensitive.
What do you mean?
Am I talking to the...
Wait, is my 3D a long?
No, it's not.
I record with AT2020.
That's also why my mic is shit.
You need a shirt and I'm like...
I'm totally fine.
It's good.
So yeah, I identify with this a lot.
Working in retail, slaving away.
I finally...
I need a noise gate.
How about I fucking noise your gate, bro?
Okay, hold on.
I do have a noise gate, actually.
Let's see.
How about now?
I also have a compressor.
I don't fucking know.
We'll figure that out later.
I don't...
I hate noise.
I hate...
I hate sounds.
I suck with audio.
They're like, oh, I hope the girls are like actually good with audio.
No, I'm not one of them.
I didn't do anything, but that's okay.
Thank you.
Mic settings are...
Yeah, just like...
Whatever.
But yeah, retail sucks.
I finally dropped to part time.
I got a part time...
I don't...
Wait, where is my...
I don't remember my fucking toggles.
I had to apply for a part time position that I already had.
I already was in the role as full time.
And I had to apply and go through two interviews just to be considered for part time.
Like, can you...
Mind you, I've been at this company for like almost six years.
It's not like they don't fucking know me.
So now I have more time to stream.
Thank God, that was my goal.
I just want...
I'm like, please, please, universe, just give me more time to stream.
I just want to be a streamer.
I just want to hang out with you guys.
I just want to yop, yop, yop, yop, yop.
Are you going to be a full time?
That's the goal.
That is the goal.
If I can stream full time, that is the goal.
Like, I just want to sit here and just talk to you and moan in your ear and like diddle you a bit and play some games.
And you know, call you a piece of trash because you are trash.
By the way, hope you don't forget that.
Just because I'm a little like, I'm a little, oh, I'm, I'm whatever.
That doesn't mean just because I have zoom or energy sometimes doesn't mean I won't be a fucking bitch.
You'll do what to me.
Don't worry about it.
Just close your eyes.
Just take it.
Anyways, so I've identified with this a lot.
I showed my mom parts of my lore video and my mom also identifies with this a lot.
Speaking of my mom, I love my parents.
My parents are very supportive of me that yes, they know I do loot audio.
Don't be like, can your parents look at you in the face?
Yeah.
My mom's like, get me on.
My dad's like, get me on.
Get us on stream.
Get us in recording.
Let's do some stuff.
I'm like, all right.
All right.
Is your mom sink?
No.
My mom is not single.
She is happily married to my father.
Get the fuck out.
Yeah.
My mom says she's going to hijack my channel so she can become a Vtuber.
Pull a Brea cookie boxes.
Mom, our cookie box and make a gardening channel.
She said, is your dad sick?
No.
My dad is a Chad though.
My dad and Strani's dad are so much alike.
My dad was just like, hey, are you going to be?
Okay.
You know what?
Let me just fuck this noise.
I'm just going to be fully in the frame because I can't stop talking.
My dad was like, I was like, dad, I got accepted for the Vtuber thing that I applied for.
And he's like, whoa.
So you're really a hentai waifu Vtuber?
And I'm like, yes.
And he's like, sick.
Don't tell me anything about it, but I'm proud of you.
Yes, my dad knows what hentai is.
And we had to thoroughly explain to my mother what it was with pictures.
It was quite funny.
My very religious conservative mother blushing profusely as we show her a clip from Bible Black.
Anyways.
Oh no, my parents are cool religious.
If when I was like super young to be like, wait, she's religious, how does this work?
I'm not religious.
Fuck that.
Respect though.
If you, you know, worship our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then you know, all for you.
I'm just not a part of it, but my parents are very devout Christians.
But as I got older and I was just, you know, I wasn't feeling that.
They're just like, you know what, you do you boo.
And I think my parents for that.
My parents are based as hell.
You don't even know.
I'll tell more stories.
Moving on.
See if I can jerk my titties around.
Watching this is church parking lot right now.
Don't ask.
My dad's going to be so mad that I'm putting him on blast.
He's like, wait, you told her stream that that we we showed your mom had.
Why would you do that?
I don't know why my dad's southern, but in whatever.
But yeah, moving on.
I also didn't fight with this because this happened to me multiple times.
Remember when I said I worked there for like six years?
I still work there because I need insurance.
Yeah, I was passed up on a lot.
And I didn't even come up with the lore.
They just threw this at me and they're like, read the script.
And I was like, why the fuck is this me though?
This is me.
This is real.
But yeah, there's they're like, no, we don't we don't believe in nepotism.
What are you talking about?
And I'm like, you just gave this girl who just came in because she never mind.
She just gave this girl a job that I clearly deserve.
I've been there for three years and you just can't get to a girl.
It's been there for six months.
Let's fight.
Oh, my bosses don't see this because they know I stream too.
Somebody pointed out in Strani stream, they're like, oh, it's queen.
It queen was my my my pre-concept art and stop telling people you stream.
I tell all people I stream and people just find me.
I had one of my co-workers come up to me and be like, hey, I saw are you doing this like playing this game?
Was that was that you?
And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
It wasn't me.
But yeah, queen, she's queen, rest in peace.
I kind of want an alternative outfit.
That's similar to her outfit, just like fur.
And then somebody also pointed out, I'll use the loli voice when you should.
The funny thing is, is that I did and they still know it was me.
I do.
Yeah, you guys know I do a lot of different voices and yes, I will continue to do so.
Someone said this looked like Contel VA and I'm like, oh shit, I didn't even get that until now.
In my debut, I glanced at chat real quick and someone's like, is that Contel VA?
And I'm like, hey, oh, it wasn't, it wasn't my intention.
Well, I might not even make this concept art and I didn't do the lore, but it wasn't the intention.
I can assure you that.
But it's funny that it happened.
It wasn't planned.
But a shout out to her.
She makes amazing audios.
Jorked off to one of them the other day.
Anyways.
Oh, damn.
Hold on.
Let me move my.
I got some tickle bitties.
I'll probably need to cover up because.
Because yeah, I'm probably going to get an outfit similar to the one I'm wearing in this.
Picture just because my bazonga hungers are bazonga hunging.
Oh my God, kids are running down the hallway screaming in my apartment building.
If I can just move out into the countryside with my three cats, get some dogs, some horses, some horses.
Some goats and just live on a farm.
No animals.
That's not everyone.
So every time you buy my merch and you, yeah, I got merch too, bitch.
You buy my merch and you support my Patreon.
You're helping me get one step closer to my tree.
Yeah, when I saw this, I'm like, this isn't going to be allowed.
I'm like, this isn't with this fucking.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Can someone like take a screenshot and like have me pointing like backwards like, oh fuck.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
One step closer to Ram Ranch, 18 naked cowboys in the showers at Ram Ranch.
She did what?
Where?
Excuse me.
Seven out of 10 burp.
Fuck your mother.
What?
I burp like a fucking God, bro.
Anyways, I don't know why I keep calling you guys bro.
I need to start.
I used to call you trash.
I'm a fucking God trash.
What's a nice one syllable word?
You fucking sluts.
Oh, here's my neighbors.
Yapping their asses off.
I don't know if you can hear that on the background.
Anyways, they probably can hear me and I'm just like, ah ha ha, gips.
This is hot.
This is hot, but yeah.
He.
Can you speak while burping?
No.
Hi honey neighbors.
I love this.
This is like my favorite scene.
Because I just look so cute with my little hair up and with a glass of wine.
Hold on.
I'm going to do a hi honey.
It's a little nod.
Take a sip.
Perfect.
And then my queens in the background, like hot infinity pool.
You know what would have been funny if they had Azura just flying.
You know how in her lore video she just flies over?
Do you do voice training?
Do you know?
I'm just like that.
I give credit.
My dad will probably say this.
I give credit to my father for giving me a wide voice range.
Because my dad's voice is super deep, but he can go super fucking high like me.
And so sometimes they're like, I would, for example, let's say I do something and I fuck up.
And I don't know.
I stubbed my toe, you know, like that one snot nose kid from the Simpsons.
They go ha ha ha.
My dad does that perfectly.
And so we would just be like ha ha ha.
And then they would talk higher.
And you can also do the, um, the fucking, uh, the PDF file from, um, South Park voice.
Hey there little boy.
I can't do it.
My dad, my dad is a good voice actor.
He should, he should honestly voice in games.
And my mom just sounds like can really do a really good Muppet impression.
She'll try to be British and she just sounds like a Muppet.
Um, family guy, whatever, whatever, bro.
I mean, slut.
I mean, you guys need a name when getting dad.
Can you do a Russian voice?
One of my, hold on.
I need to think of IC.
And one of my best friends is also, she's Russian too.
Shout out to, shout out to my girl.
Um, everybody's Russian, the Finnish.
No, I can't, I can't do it right now because then I'm going to slip into, I always end up slipping into a British accent.
And then sometimes when I'm listening to Strony, I'll just slip into her, her Scottish accent and she's been teaching me Scots.
But I also just sound like I'm from Northern, cause I can't roll my, my Rs that well.
Sound like I'm from Northern Britain or UK or whatever.
What about calling a slit? No.
I'm not going to be like, hey slave on YouTube.
What's up you guys?
We're talking to this.
What's up you slave?
Are you trying to get me canceled?
Are you trying to get me canceled?
Do not clip this out of context.
I will come for you.
Not like that.
I will come for you.
I'm coming for you.
Coming for your family.
I'm coming for your, your, your career.
I'm coming on your lap.
All right.
All right.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Ah, Shibi, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Shibi.
Ah, anyways, at least take me out to dinner first.
Nah, we're going straight to third base.
You know what that is?
Holding hands.
How about calling you Scum?
Oh, I like Scum.
I love her absolutely scatterbrained Tommy.
That's me.
And I'm getting too lewd.
I'm getting too lewd.
And it's like, I've always been like not say so, but I usually, it's usually just in
the frame of what's it called, just swearing and cursing.
But now I can just make really stupid, perfected jokes just because I can.
Oh, okay.
And holding is insane.
I know.
Hey, look, it's me.
So yeah, people are like, Shibi, Shibi, hold on.
Where's the, where's the dumb?
Oh, where's the dumb face?
There we go.
This is what, this is how I picture you guys.
Oh, Shibi, when you wear Shiba, he rubs.
If you're not, like, domesticated.
Because I don't fucking know.
And obviously I kind of thought my Laura would explain it like it's just my get up.
I just wear it and you know, you can be a dumb and like pain.
Right?
Like, you know, you're allowed to also enjoy things.
Like, I just, you know, like, you want to know how much of a dumb I am.
Let me tell you a secret.
Let me tell you.
Oh, by the way, this is the voice that I mostly use for my, my naughty audios.
So, so 100% a switch.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck.
No, let's not be guys, guys.
Okay, I'll educate you after this because Jesus Christ.
I can maintain it.
By the way, but what the fuck was I saying?
Where am I?
Because someone remind me what the hell I was saying.
Again, I have, I have, I have short term memory.
Audio's voice talking about being a dumb.
Dom's going to enjoy things with no clue.
Yeah, you're just, you're just like odd titties.
Madam.
Guys, I'm, I'm, I'm elderly.
You see, so I lose track of things quite quickly.
You thought I was a hag.
I'm ancient.
Um, but, and then if this filters you, but it's okay, but I don't really care.
Um, but Dom's like you could, they can enjoy paid.
Oh, I remember those.
I was going to make a joke.
Um, I'm such a dumb.
I'm such a, I'm such a masochist.
Don't you thought shut the fuck up.
You piece of shit about stupid toilet.
Um, I'm such a masochist that I'll sleep with a scrunchie on my wrist.
So it leaves a mark.
Putting dumb.
Okay, you got me there.
You got me there.
I'm like fucking sweating.
I got like titty sweat right now under my boobies.
Um, uh, insider note.
Uh, I have the same exact body top.
I have the same exact body type as she be.
So my boobs are actually as big as hers and it is a hassle.
Let me tell you.
Oh, hold on.
I'm asleep.
Wake the fuck up.
Wake the fuck up.
Oh, my parents don't walk in right now.
Oh, I love scuff.
Um, anyways, I'm just going to like jiggle myself around to talk official boob chart.
I don't know.
I think that'll be like a donut on goal.
I think, um, mome was saying, can we just talk about how annoying vtube studio.
I don't know if you're a vtuber watching this or if you're not a vtuber watching this.
Oh, my God.
It's so easy just to be a vtuber.
It's not.
There's so much annoying.
It took me three hours to set up a fucking chat with you today.
Okay.
We need baby keys on screen to help she be constant.
Shut up vtube studio breaks.
Exactly.
Thank you, Emmy.
Thank you.
Technical difficulties, you know, their png.
Um, so there was a point when we were doing like, I think I'm starting to mention this.
We did like a couple of mock streams before we did a real stream and my model just wasn't working because my the cable I think I was using just wasn't behaving.
Oh, I'm a soup in my mouth.
Um, hold on.
You like that?
Um, so I just had a png of my model and I was just like, and I was just talking over it and the girls were losing their minds.
Get some subway servers up there.
You know what?
You might tempt me.
Um, it's been 30 minutes and I've just talked about lore.
I haven't even talked about the like, I haven't even anyways.
Yes, this is my boss.
It's not my real boss.
Um, it's Johnny.
No, she's not my boss.
She's not.
She's my co-worker.
This is the entirety of my management and editing team.
Um, but yes, if you caught on, yes, it's it's my boss from the beginning, which is pretty.
I thought that was pretty pretty shaky if you ask me in it.
Hey, your skip ahead.
Let's talk about this queen.
God rest her soul.
When I tell you when they handed this to me when management's like, oh, here's the sketch.
I'm like, you're telling me that this woman's dying from this some disease.
And there's just a guy.
There's a guy with a gypsy in the hospital.
A gypsy in the corner.
It looks like an SCP.
Yeah, SCP 69.
Someone also did a cheeky edit of this with something.
So that was funny.
Um, but I, uh, this was funny as hell.
That was so funny.
Uh, this last scene makes me feel so badass.
Like this last take I did with my voice and the way the beat goes.
I was like, oh, I'm feeling like a motherfucker.
I am feeling like the baddest bitch that ever bitched the bad before.
One of the gim stairs.
Um, but yeah, let me get out of the way.
Oh, step on me.
Oh, step on me.
She be step on me.

Anyways.
Wake me up.
Wake me up inside.
Uh, hold on a moment.
What the fuck?
Yeah.
I came up with the memes.
I was like, throw my titties on Changus.
Throw me on this.
Hold on.
Can I make this bigger?
Okay.
It's me as a bunny.
And that's you guys.
Can't live with energy.
Sometimes they're like, I know people are like,
I can't wait for her to be like a dummy mommy and just order me around and be really cold.
And, you know, what is that called when you're,
what type of dairy is it called when you just have no emotions?

What is the squeaky voice?
What are you talking about?
That's your voice.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
That's what you guys sound like.
I'm just mimicking what you guys sound like.
I think I'd like to be a.
No, not division, not included.
Yeah, you can't see.
I'm going to put a blindfold on you anyway is why you don't.
You don't need to see.
Do you have to pay taxes?
Yes, you do have to pay taxes.
We are beating the e-girl and e-boy allegations of not paying our taxes.
I sound like a weird bun because you are one.
Is this slander or bullying?
Why not both, you know?
My likes.
I could have put a lot more and I know like I see did like the whole thing or something.
She showed you like I ever get what it's called.
It's not a tier list.
It's whatever of all her.
I'm waving my arms around and that's why I'm losing tracking.
Oh my God, I almost threw up in my mouth again.
Jesus fuck.
Yeah, country sucks.
I'm just going to go further into what I like.
So like I'm a huge cater, not a fan.
I really like any sort of house music techno.
That's I really love the IC DJs because I would love to just dance in 3D while she's doing a DJ set.

and it just sounds so fucking cool to me
and I'm just like yo.
But yeah, if you give for food,
just I'll eat anything.

God damn it.
Like hand it over.
But how did you get into jiu-jitsu?

Like I shouldn't like I had pasta for lunch.
I shouldn't eat tomato sauce

You're totally right.
It's because I just.
I don't know.

I haven't tried that.
Team Fortress to seduce me.

That can't be real.
But yeah, I read.

The original Battle Royale name of the wind.
Yes, I love name of the wind.
Fuck Patrick Roth is for real.
I want to go to that dude's house.

His dark materials.
Yes, good.
Dragonlands.
I have not.
I a lot of my friends read the Wheel of Time.
I'm only on the second book.
So they're a little bit ahead on me.
One of my my girlfriends.
I need to come up with a code name for her.
Because I'm going to call her by her real name.
I'm going to call her.
Salem.
Because she's witch like.
Salem.
She said because she's very supportive of my VTubing.
She's the only person that knows outside my parents.
And she's like, please get me on your stream.
And we can do like some sort of podcast where we talk about really smutty books.
Like a court of thorn and roses.
Or credence.
Oh, credence.
Hey, if you guys like Emmy.
You should read credence.
But yeah, what the fuck her name is.
Colleen Hoover.
I forget.
Sort of truth.
Actually, I have.
I know he said sort of truth.
But I have.
I literally have like the Witcher books on my.
I'm looking to the side right now.
The Witcher.
Books on my bookshelf.
I have Joe Abercombe the blade itself.
My favorite.
Series that I've read.
Or.
Well, my favorite like book series of all time.
Or actually no TV show series and kind of book series has to be.
The magicians.
The book series obviously blows the fucking show out of the water.
But I like the show too.
I also really like Brandon Sanderson.
What's.
What's the other dude's name that wrote.
Hold on.
Let me move over to my.
Where did the book go?
Oh, it's going to bother the crap out of me if I don't know the name.
Hold on.
Red sister by Mark Lawrence.
I love Mark Lawrence.
And let me see.
Why is it a lot?
And mind you, my dad recommends every book that I've read because of my dad's a huge reader.
Scott Lynch.
Scott Lynch needs to also release more books because he's a great writer.
How about Jordan?
Yes.
Just read the blade itself.
What did you think?
Yeah.
Brandon said, I still have to read the last book in the Stormlight archive.
I know that came out like last year.
I want to get the nice, nice, really fancy hard, hard cover.
Cooking.
Cooking.
Cooking.
Cooking.
Cooking.
Cooking.
I love to cook.
You might see on my all, I've actually posted pictures of stuff that I've cooked.
I definitely want to do some cooking streams.
I don't know how I'm going to manage that.
Because I like, I don't know how people do cooking streams as a VTuber, but we'll try.
I know a lot of random internet shit.
Like, well, did you know that?
Excuse me.
That humans are covered in stripes.
We just can't see them, but our pets, like our cats can see them.
I forget what the stripes are actually called, but it's on a different, I think it's like UV rays or something.
Ranger.
Yeah.
Oh yes.
I wanted to read Rangers apprentice.
That's definitely on my list.
Just take bow or scooch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or I'm really, I'm blanking on names right now.
But that other big, I literally watch her.
I don't know why I'm playing your name.
Who also does a lot of cooking streams.
Jujitsu.
I got into Jujitsu because Onigiri.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Onigiri.
Yes.
Onigiri.
I'm like, I was thinking of another Japanese food.
I was like, no, not Konigiri.
What's the right one?
Got Connie on the brain.
Whoopsies.
When I was younger, someone broke into my house when I was 13 and I was home alone.
And I decided to run after the guy.
There was a grown ass man in my house and I chased him out.
And then I called the police.
And then my dad tried hunting for him for a very, very long time.
But afterwards my parents put me in Jujitsu classes.
And so I'm all, don't get it twisted.
I'm only a white belt, but it doesn't mean I won't put you in the grounds.
I know submissions.
I'm very strong.
I've taken it.
And my school that I attended was co-ed.
So I sparred with guys like twice my size and I still put their asses to sleep.
Do not get it twisted.
I will gladly knock you out.
And I like to watch UFC too.
I'm pretty gory like that.
My mom's teaching me about gardening.
I love listening to my mom talk about gardening.
So I think I want to get into gardening more.
And then obviously voice acting.
Wow.
I wouldn't have given that away.
I'm only on my second fucking slide.
Yeah, we already talked about this.
Dollhouse.
I love Dollhouse.
Great show.
Dungeon Mesh is good.
I love Robotech.
I literally have the OG discs on my entertainment center right now.
Princess Bride is my all-time favorite movie.
Hands down.
I can quote that movie word for word.
And I think it started a trend into the type of men I'm into because I really liked Wesley and I really liked Howl.
And they look very similar in hindsight.
And it's funny, my mom almost named me Wesley if I was a boy after him.
You've never seen the Princess Bride?
I've seen it like 10 times.
Also Lady Hawk is good.
I should put Lady Hawk on here.
Haunting a Hill House.
Bom.
Bom.
My name is Enugamentoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Inconceivable.
Two times watch it more.
Against your will.
It's a great movie.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I like that is my comfort.
If I'm really upset, I'm watching the Princess Bride.
I just binge watched a show called Harlots.
It's about brothel madams in Victorian England.
I like a lot of period films and shows like Tudors.
I know Game of Thrones isn't a period, but I like older settings, but also sci-fi.
Like I said, the magicians, although it's more like fantasy.
But I'm trying to think of another sci-fi show that I've watched.
I can't remember.
Anyways, games.
I'm trying to think.
Again, I'm blonde.
It takes me a long time and I'm a hag.
I don't play a lot of games.
I've never, I've gamed a lot when I was younger.
My dad was a badass and he, we were poor.
So he emulated games on my PC.
Star Trek, yes.
Star Wars, yes.
Battlestar Galactica, yes.
You prefer haunting a blind manor?
You're dumb.
Get out of here.
Mods.
Kick them out.
If you like horror, archive 81 though.
I'm so mad.
Ow, I just hit my arm.
I'm so mad that archive 81 got canceled.
That show fucked me up.
Babylon 5.
I've never heard of Babylon 5.
Never heard of Babylon 5.
I've heard of World of Horror.
I've played Alien Isolation.
I will not do it again.
I love, yeah, but I love horror though.
I want to do like a drunk stream of amnesia, the dark descent, because I think it'd be funny.
Babylon 5 is starting to get me Star Trek.
Ooh, okay.
All right.
I have not watched Star Trek Andromeda.
Have you played FNAF?
Yes, I've played FNAF.
Of course.
You know what I didn't mention?
I didn't like, I also watched, I used to be obsessed with Marvel.
Like, when I was like eight or, I don't know how old I was when X-Men the Last Stand came out.
No, I don't really know.
But I saw that it's a shitty movie.
But I just fell in love with the X-Men.
So I was obsessed with the X-Men for the longest time.
Looping the third.
I've seen Looping the Third.
And then in terms of like anime, I grew up, the first anime, again, my dad, big, big contributor to a lot of the content that I absorbed.
He, the first anime I ever watched was The Cat Returns.
Yes, I had a crush on the cat.
X-Men 80s.
I watched the first episode of X-Men 87.
I didn't like it.
Maybe I have to watch it again.
I don't know.
2000s.
It came out of 2006.
Oh, damn.
In the comics.
Yes, I actually have.
I have a lot of old OG Thunderbolt comics right next to me right now.
But the thing is, I'm so pissed what they did with the Thunderbolts movie.
I'm so angry.
Like Thunderbolts.
I love Thunderbolts.
Like in that like, they just totally ruined it.
Like they just totally retconned everything.
And yeah, I'm not, I don't even want to talk about it.
We can thank Cat Returns for rewinding up an anti-wife.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I've been watching Mushu Tensei.
I can't pronounce it.
I also really like, because I like dungeon meshi so much, I like went on a binge watch of watching food related enemies.
Enemies.
Enemies.
So I watched like a little bit of food wars.
It's fucking weird.
I'm not finishing that.
And then I watched my cooking skill from another world or using my cooking skill in another world or useless or whatever.
I don't know what's the trend with some anime lately.
Just having the weirdest names.
So.
I should be banished to catch a stream.
I really like Marvel.
Personally, I don't know.
No DC lovers here.
No DC.
Fuck DC.
Yeah.
But I don't mind Isekai that bad.
But I'm really like, people like, I hate Isekai.
Isekai sucks.
And then I realized I didn't know how prevalent it was in the anime.
It was like, I grew up watching Naruto, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, staying up watching that on Adult Swim.
And just like being like having it on mute so my parents don't hear.
You know the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist I watched and spoiler where it was the one where a girl gets turned into that bird thing.
I can't quite remember.
And then she's like dies and just like covered in blood and like bird feathers everywhere across his bed.
That's the first thing I saw.
And I was like, this is so cool.
Oh no, not me.
Not me.
No.
Not me.
It was like one of the first like three episodes, I think.
It wasn't the, it wasn't the Chimera episode.
It wasn't that one.
But someone asked about Junji Ito.
Yes, I read every Junji Ito thing.
I love Junji Ito.
I love the art style.
I love body horror.
I am a fan of body horror and gore.
Although, you know, weirdly enough, I don't super like slasher films.
Like you're not going to catch me watching saw, but like I'll watch it.
But I'm like, I prefer more in terms of horror, like spooky, like sparritism.
Let's see.
I've heard of Let's See.
I've not watched it.
It's episode two.
Oh, okay.
There you go.
I've watched both Fullmetal Alchemists.
I have.
I remember watching PewDiePie play Corpse Party when I was younger.
That was great.
The ring.
Yes.
Psychological horror.
That's right.
I really liked.
I think Archive 81 had a little bit of psychological horror.
I like suspense.
Hamels.
Hamels.
Joker.
Hands down.
You don't even have to ask.
You don't even have to ask Sans the Lambs.
Of course.
The witch.
That was good.
And the ritual was good too.
Are you into motorcycles?
They're all right.
I guess.
I like horror visual novels.
Yeah.
I like, I remember like Ib Corpse Party, Mad Father.
I have not watched Suspiria.
I have not watched that.
Yeah.
I remember seven.
You start to laugh.
But yeah, in terms of games, like I want to play Soul's Likes.
Hold on.
Let me skip ahead a little bit.
Let me skip ahead.
So you got some names here.
Little girl, big mama and big man.
You already know big man is booming.
I also call him Metro booming or the boomster or titties because he has a little pouch that makes him look like he has little titties.
Little girl, she's named after a character from Elden Ring.
Can you guess what her name is?
And then big mama is Reina, which is funny because it sounds like Ronnie.
But that's not where like the spelling is similar.
Just rearrange the letters, but it's not.
Let's see.
Let's say Ronnie.
No, Raya.
Molina.
No.
Melania.
No.
Dong eater.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come here.
Dong eater.
Where is she anyways?
Where's my little dong eater?
I don't even know.
Is she next to me?
No.
Sometimes she likes to go under my blanket under my legs.
I don't know where she went.
Her name is Fia, the death bed companion.
I love to snuggle her.
She's a snuggler, this little baby.
Then I can't move because I love snuggling her death.
Oh, she stinks though because she likes to fart on me and it sucks.
She's really stinky farts.
So she is, I guess, the dong eater.
You know what I should have put up here for dislikes.
I should have put people who have bad breath that puts me off a lot.
Hate bad breath.
Disgusting.
Yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.
It's funny because I didn't know that until recently when I went over a friend's house
and they were house sitting some rabbits that they normally don't have.
And I was like, oh, I love rabbits.
Bunnies are so freaking cute.
Don't get me wrong.
Look at me.
I'm fucking sexy.
Hold on, I'm trying to jiggle my titties but they weren't jiggling the way I wanted to.
Don't worry yourself.
So I was like hanging out with these bunnies and I'm petting them and I'm like, yeah, I forget.
Like it's name is Harold.
Harold's the hair.
And yeah, I almost went to Anaphylactic show after because I'm also mildly allergic to dogs and cats.
So if I like, but if I just don't touch my face, I'm fine.
But I had rubbed my hand against my nose after petting the bunny and it was not a good.
And it's funny because my mom's like, oh yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.
And I'm like, why did I inherit the ability to be allergic to rabbits from my mom?
Like I don't, what is the, but like I'll still pet a rabbit.
I don't care.
I'll risk my life to pet myself every day.
You might be thinking, wow, Sheeby, you are so full of energy.
You are so extrovert.
I'm not actually, I only, I only really get this way when I have to work because I used to work in sales.
But now I'm doing something else.
So I know how to like sell stuff.
So like buy my merch.
I don't have to tell you twice.
Do it.
Buy my merch.
I'll show it to you later.
Let me take a step on my team.
I look so funny when I'm drinking.
Oh, I don't even know where I put the.
There it is.
Can I just like drop this in here?
Oh, I can't.
Can I just download this?
My link for my merch is in my description.
Check the description down below and you can get merch.
What's there?
Oh, please.
Can I please just copy and paste for the love of Christ Almighty.
My voice is starting to crack though.
There it is.
Look at it.
I got my own merch.
That's it.
It's funny because like one of my goals being a Vtuber, I was like, I always got my own merch and then I'm signed on and I get merch.
And I was like, I've always wanted to voice in a video game and I'm signed on and I'm in a video game which is coming out soon.
I've seen some of the promotional art for the game.
Oh my God.
You're definitely going to be seeing my cotton bum.
That's all I can say.
But yeah, go check that out.
Check out the other girls merch too as well.
Make sure that you look at the description below and yeah.
We've got some cool standees.
So if you want to, you know, have me on your desk so I can like and you can like put a little sticky note under my head that just says like you fucking suck or something like I'm salting you.
And then I got a key chain and then I got, um, what else do I got?
I got a sweatshirt and sweatpants and I think I want to go for myself too.
Let me get rid of this.
Sorry.
Again, the bun speak voice comes, comes out when I'm excited.
Put in the jar.
Excuse me.
Do not, do not put me in the jar, please.
Please don't put me in the jar.
After getting to a car accident, I jumped off a cliff.
That is true.
I was sleeping over at my friend's house and we were going to get McDonald's.
It was like 2am and she's like, yeah, what's the McDonald's?
And I'm like, yeah, let's get frosty.
So we are, I'm like, I forgot what it was, but I wasn't driving because I wasn't old enough to drive yet.
Nine out of ten.
Okay.
Thank you.
Eight out of ten.
Perfect.
Oh, six out of ten.
Perfect.
Nine out of ten.
And so we're driving.
We're driving.
And then this person had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel while she was texting.
So like double whammy.
And so she fell asleep and she, her foot just pressed into the pedal and she rammed us from behind.
And then we fishtailed and spun out on the highway.
It was crazy.
And she, the other driver, flipped over the barrier.
And so we're pulled over.
We're like off in the middle pulled over kind of.
And my friend runs across the highway.
Like, yeah, it's 2am.
But people are still driving.
She runs across the highway to check on the other driver.
I'm calling 911.
You know what?
We literally all walked away.
Fine.
Like I didn't get injured.
I had like a little bit of whiplash.
So did my friend.
And the other driver who flipped over the guardrail didn't, didn't, she only had like a little bit of scratches on her hands because like her phone was in her hand when she fell asleep.
It was crazy.
So I call my mom to come pick me up because I'm like, I just want to go home and be with my mommy.
And yeah.
Oh, lucky that I should like 100%.
We all should have freaking died.
Like it was, it was, it was crazy.
I don't, it was really crazy.
But um, and I'm like, you know what, you know what I should do?
I should jump off a cliff because the next day I was invited to go to this quarry and the quarry is this place where
there's like a, it's like a, kind of got water hole, but it's, there's cliffs all around.
It's like an old rock quarry, but it's full of water and people usually go and jump and swim in there.
And so I'm like, mom, can I, like I was invited to go with my friends and I'm like, mom, can I please, can I please go to the quarry with the girls?
And my mom's like, yeah.
And I'm like, and then I got there.
One, it was a, it was a dump, by the way.
Like don't anytime, any place that there's like not publicly maintained.
Like there was like beer bottles broken.
I'm pretty sure I saw needles.
There was like shit everywhere.
I cut my foot on a bottle walking barefoot and then I slipped on a rock.
And then there's a part of the cliff that's 50 feet up.
And I'm like, you know what?
Let me jump off.
I almost died before.
Let's try it again.
Cue the Kermit jumping off the building gift.
And I hit the water and I think I actually got worse whiplash from that because I landed like kind of folded in half and I snapped back up.
And yeah, what was fun, I can just say, it's just a fun story to tell.
Do you know that the voice one?
I lost two of my bunny lives.
I don't know, bunnies have lives like cats, but yeah.
I met the voice of Mario.
He was pretty sick, came into my job once.
I don't even know why he was there.
And he's like taking pictures and videos with some of my coworkers and I'm just there like, oh my God, my child.
Oh my God, my childhood is right in front of me.
Mario, I used to fucking play the shit out of Mario on the Wii.
And he's like, oh, do you want a picture?
I'm like, no, no, no, I couldn't because like as someone who has been in the entertainment industry for a while outside of VTubing, I know how annoying it is to have people walk up to you and be like, can I get a picture?
So I was like, oh, no, I'll just sit back.
But he was just like, he was so nice.
He insisted on taking a picture and I sent it to my parents and my dad was like, oh my God, my mom was like, yes, Charles, he is the sweetest, the sweetest person ever.
I will tell you that, not Chris Pratt.
It was not Chris Pratt.
That would be funny though.
Where did my, okay, there it is.
I'm losing my voice.
I want to be a souls like first souls.
I was going to play Bloodborne, but they didn't do a port like I wanted.
So come on, Sony.
Looks like, I don't know if I can learn Japanese, but I would like to.
I know a little bit of Spanish.
I know a little bit of French.
Who knows?
Who knows?
Have you hit 100K views?
That'd be so cool.
Hit 10K subs.
I'm almost halfway there, which is crazy to me.
Crazy German.
How are you live?
Don't know.
I am Scottish too.
So I could try to learn Scots and feel like I'm not culturally appropriating or something.
Yeah.
Shadow of the Erd Tree soon.
I know.
I know people have asked me like, are you going to play that on stream?
I don't know why, but Elden Ring is a comfort game to me.
I don't know if I'll play it on stream because that is a game that pulled me through
a very, very tough situation.
You know, you get down in the dumps.
Got that mental Illinois.
And that's, that is a game I just put poured so many hours into.
Yes, a comfort game.
You, we be like, how is the souls like a comfort game?
But like, it was, it was a way to helpfully kind of express my frustration on a video.
Although I have broken a pair of headphones before, so I can't really talk of headphones I'm wearing right now.
I actually broke while playing a lot as a PA smash, smash them on the ground.
But it was just like, I liked the dopamine I got from beating a boss from coming with the builds.
It was, it was really fun to nerd out on something I normally don't nerd out on.
Because again, like I've said in the past, I played a lot of CSGO.
I played Overwatch, not playing Overwatch 2.
I played a lot of like FPS games.
Like I play a lot of cod.
I didn't like I play a lot of Valorant, but I'm not like in the last year or so.
I haven't been playing any FPSs.
And I've been playing like inscription.
I've been playing, you know, some horror games.
I've been playing, I'm trying to think of more games that I've played.
The coffin of Andy and Laylay I've played.
Your CS2 account got hacked.
Oh no.
Yeah, I gambled like 1000s of skins away.
So fuck that game.
I do want to play buckshot roulette because that, they have like the best fucking music.
Almost like every time.
Neo and Neo 2 for so, wait, hold on a second.
Neo is a souls like.
I didn't even know that.
I also play a lot of Skyrim.
Plates of Minecraft, although I'm not good at Minecraft.
Yeah, I'm going to mow you guys down at a convention, by the way.
So like, although as Strani mentioned, we were kind of gypped by that place, which really sucked.
Like I really wanted to do the convention.
But hopefully next year, or maybe, you know, another convention pops up.
Hades, I want to play Hades.
I want to play Hades.
Do you mod Skyrim?
Yes.
Although I played it on mod at first.
I was recently playing Oblivion as well.
We're going to be playing Vampire of the Masquerade at the end of the week.
And we are turning those boobs up.
I want to play more retro games.
Travel.
I want to do Off Club with the Girls.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then if you are a streamer or a Vtuber watching this, please, just because I'm a lewd ASMR creator, please do not get off put on hanging out with me.
I don't bite.
I just feel bad.
I was, I knew that, like, for example, for the watch along stuff, like a lot of people were kind of going to snub us because of the content that we do, but we do do normal content on YouTube.
And then there are companies that are say so.
I'm doing air quotes that you cannot see that a backshot roulette that do worse than us.
So, like, I, I don't, I just want to be friends with people.
I want to, you know, branch out, network, help the other girls network.
It's, I probably won't have any collab set up for a bit just so I can get my bearings.
But what, no lewd tuba.
No, what are you talking about?
I'm the most holy and say so.
I don't know what you, I've, hold on, wait.
I am so say so from the head up.
Our nice Christian.
Yeah, I'm a good Christian girl.
You know, I was a nun.
You won't believe it, but I was a nun.
Is that too on the nose?
How long?
Short amount of time.
This is too class.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Okay.
Is there my tags?
What do you guys want your fan name to be?
Because I don't know.
I don't know.
Hold on.
Let me, I'm on a hold on ventral cause moment I want to go into my notes on my phone.
And I'll tell you what I had for ideas at first.
So Strani initially came up with love bunnies and I'm like, that's too long.
And then I was like bumpkins cause I'm bum.
I'm a bumkin jackrabbit.
Cause yeah.
Excuse me whippersnappers cause I'm a hag and I have a whip.
Whaskley rabbits.
Do you know a group of rabbits is called a fluffle?
Fluffle bros, bun buddies, bum buddies.
But then the other day it came to me in a dream.
Harem.
Harem.
Harem.
You are my harem.
Shibbatees.
Shibbatees toilets.
Or I was also thinking harlets but like spell it like hairlets.
You are my harlets.
Or I could be, yeah or harem.
So the nun bun, yeah that's not going to flow.
Fluffers, you know those fluffles on Club Penguin.
So I didn't realize that's probably where they got the name from.
Alright let's do a vote, let's do a vote.
I don't know how to do that.
Start a poll.
Okay, ask a question.
What name?
Adoption.
Harem.
Harlets.
Hold on.
Harem full of hall.
I don't know why I sound like that.
One actor.
Shibbatees.
Shibbatees nuts.
How about that?
What was it?
Bun-bums.
Okay I'll put bun-bums for you.
Bun-bums.
Got him.
You want me to put, oh honey buns is cute actually.
Damn this is going to be hard.
If you put shibbatee, alright I'll put that for you.
Alright.
Rabin turns.
That's pretty good.
I can't call you bun sluts guys.
Although I already say a lot of bad things.
You're not my dom-
You're not doming me.
I'm doming you.
The only chungus-
Hey what's up chungusies.
Back with a brand new video.
I'm ready for some ASMR.
All I see are three options.
Oh did I fuck it up?
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Hello good evening mathem.
Good evening.
And you sip some more tea.
I'm a power bottom.
Someone time him out.
Time is a bit joke.
I am my dom.
Do not think that you can get away with bullying me.
Again I will fuck you up.
Are you British?
And whatever you want me to be darling.
You want me to be British?
I can be British.
You want a bottle of water?
I got you.
Here catch.
Tea is the best British beverage known to man.
I'm drinking a ginger-
Ginger lemon tea.
I definitely want to get-
I have like a whole thing of tea in my cupboard actually.
I can pull you.
Sweet tea.
Now I know you from the south sweetheart.
If you like French-
I heard French accent.
If you like sweet tea.
I can do a French accent as well.
It is not as good.
My name is Shibi Kotemban.
I would like to fuck you in the ass.
Yes.
Sweet tea.
Yes, Baguette.
I live in France.
Hi Amy.
Amy is like shut up.
I think Amy speaks Quebecois.
So.
The sac les bleus.
On les deux fromage.
Do you know how I do the French accent?
I think of Lumière from the beauty and the beast.
All I have to do is in my head say
Don't you know she is the one.
And then I can do it.
Je dors madame.
You better.
Croissant.
I am not Canadian.
All from fucking America.
Fuck yeah.
Suck my.
Anyways.
French-
I have that je ne sais quoi.
Beauty and the beast is front.
Are you kidding me right now?
Are you kidding me right now?
Finish the sentence.
We got some Canadians.
We got some Europeans.
We got them all.
Do you see Los Muthrobs?
Yes.
Actually no.
I don't like musicals in Brooklyn.
I am walking here.
But when I do a Brooklyn accent
I just start sounding like I am from Jersey.
Or I can sound like your Jewish aunt.
You know your brother was a doctor.
You know.
Uncle did that once.
Bastard.
Pack the fucking kind.
Have a yard kid.
I swear to God.
Do not come at me with that shit.
Alabama.
I fuck my sister.
That's Alabama accent.
I can't do Austrian.
Australian is one I can't do
because I just end up sounding British.
Roll that.
Run.
Oh boy.
You guys get to have her after me.
That sounds weird.
You guys get to have her after I am done with her.
All right.
So it looks like.
It looks like it was harem.
Okay guys you are the harem.
I am losing my voice.
Oh shit.
Where did my chat go?
No I don't want to see the viewer count.
Fuck.
Let me just talk with the girls real quick.
Damn.
When I tell you.
I was so.
Worried.
That I am like okay.
Oh I forgot to shoot.
I made art too by the way.
Of the girls.
I just forgot.
I didn't.
Like I had pictures for like a lot of my likes.
I just didn't.
Toggle them because I was just.
Too lazy.
Where is it?
Whoop.
Throw that off to the side.
Oh shit.
I don't know what the fuck I am moving.
I am a smart of the girls.
I am my iPad real quick like.
So these girls.
I love them to death.
You do not understand.
I will kill.
I will hurt someone.
If you cross.
You think you are thinking I am joking.
You are thinking I am not even going to put on toggles.
Because that will just be stupid.
If you hurt these girls feelings.
If you make them cry.
If you leave a bad comment.
I will.
You don't think I will.
But I know how to find you.
Okay.
You better be nice.
I would die for these girls.
Better make them smile.
Down bad com.
What if they want you to find us?
Well.
We might end up in the bottom of a ditch then.
But.
I am starting to sound like Mercy the way I am talking.
But yeah.
Strani feels like my sister.
We are on the same wavelength.
She said in her debut that.
I was supposed to be her in another life.
And dude.
That just.
Oh.
I want to make me cry.
Because that's just.
She's so talented.
And I can't.
Tearing up a little bit.
Just nice.
And then is her so sweet.
Is her the sweetest person.
Like I can't.
Like I just love hearing her talk.
She's so helpful.
Like.
She's.
She is.
She's also just crazy good at games.
It's just.
She's nasty.
She's just awesome.
And I just love hearing her talk.
And encouraging me.
Cause like I just know everything's going to be okay.
I see.
I see.
I see my girl.
She's the first person I talked to.
We're the first two people.
She was accepted before me.
And he wrote my eyes.
Because I'm crying.
Tearing up a little bit.
Cause I love them.
I see was the first person I talked to in the server.
And he immediately headed off.
She's so sweet.
She's so down to earth.
She loves her cats.
I love my cats.
She's like.
She's so wonderful.
And so talented.
And.
I don't do anything for her.
Emmy is so.
Also one of the most fucking talented people she told me.
She's like I applied to other companies.
And they said.
No.
And I'm like huh.
She could play piano.
She can sing well.
She's a fucking amazing artist.
Holy crap.
Like I don't.
You guys don't even know.
Like there's some things you don't know behind the scenes.
And I'm like how are you not picked up.
By like hello live or some shit.
Like you know.
Cause she dunk.
Yeah.
She could dunk.
But she's also just the sweetest.
And I love her.
You're talking about her rats.
Oh my God.
And then mercy.
Mercy.
Mercy.
Wow.
Like me and her.
Thick as thieves.
It's bad.
We're bad together.
We're so fucking toxic.
But in a good way.
In terms of like.
Like we're just like.
Like evil with each other.
Like.
Oh it's just.
I just like.
Oh it's just.
I just love her.
She's like if I need a bitch and moan about something.
She's the one I'll go to.
And then.
She'll just be like fuck those hoes.
And I'm like.
Oh my thing died again.
Cause I'm just so excited talking about mercy.
And.
I just like she just cheers me up.
I remember I forget what happened.
I think.
I was worried about like I said before like my job interview with.
Going to their job.
And she's like you're going to fucking get this shit.
Fuck.
And like you know mercy might be coming off as shot.
She's not.
She's just warming up.
I'll tell you that right now.
She.
Yeah.
She has my back.
She has all these girls backs.
She she's also ride or die.
I'll tell you that right now.
She was everybody's perfect castings.
Perfect castings.
I wouldn't.
Think of.
Another way to cast any of them.
Cause people are like.
Oh it's this person's this person's this person's this person's.
And then like everything just fell into place perfectly.
And.
They're just.
I'm so glad that it's them.
Like they're.
I can say that they're close friends.
Like.
Well you don't get that and sometimes in gens.
You don't get that sometimes in gens.
But.
I don't know.
They're just wonderful.
Ball oil machine.
Yeah.
Mommy you had to pick them.
Moment knew how to pick them.
It's not your toxic.
Okay.
So we're gonna.
Wait.
The thing about my like transition is that.

Please like it shows me.
And I don't know why it does before.
So we're going to go over.
Some arrows.
Oh wow.
Oh my god.
I'm gonna have it cover you guys.
My voice is gone.
My neighbors are walking by again.
Put it right there.
We're going to go quick through these because it only got like.
40 minutes.
Do you have permission to fluff my ears?
No.
Do not touch me unless I give you permit.
Well actually.
You did ask permission but no.
Is it true that looking rabbits hold on a second.
Let me just.
I'm like looking wrong.
There we go.
Now I'm facing the right direction.
Is it true that looking a rabbit's foot brings good luck?
Yes.
You during some sessions.
I know I have people travel far and wide just to lick my feet.
Because I'm pretty good luck.
Yeah.
They think it's like oh if I have a rabbit's foot.
It's.
Licking a rabbit's foot is the correct terminology by the way.
I heard that you're a distant relative of Jessica Rabbit.
Of who framed your rabbit fame.
Could you please say in your hottest voice.
I'm not bad.
I was drawn that way.
Okay.
Hold on.
My voice is gone so I need to.
I'm not bad.
I'm just drawn that way.
That was bad but my voice is going so.
As a rabbit are you big.
Are you scared of big hawks.
No.
They'll punch a hawk.
I'm not bad.
I'm not bad.
I'm just drawn that way.
That was bad but my voice is going so.
Elevator.
Anyway.
Hi Sibe.
What made you on the join feeler.
How did you know it was the right corporate for you again.
Like I said I've been looking into real Earth since.
Mommy decided to even talk other the word I want to be.
