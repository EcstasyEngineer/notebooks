120000	122000	You
150000	152000	You
180000	182000	You
210000	212000	You
240000	242000	You
270000	272000	You
300000	324000	You
330480	333960	Is that some better there's an echo
339240	341240	What about now
351040	353040	Why am I so bad at this
360000	362000	You hear that
390000	392000	You
420000	422880	Okay
450000	467000	Okay, no more. No, you don't get it easy. We are getting rid of the AC. No AC for you.
467000	483000	If you're European, no AC for you. What do you like the AC? Why do you like the AC?
483000	491000	Okay, fine. I'll put it back. Okay, here it goes.
492000	496000	Oh my god, that's too loud. Holy shit. Okay.
499000	504000	We'll have it like a little...
504000	513000	You guys aren't going to be able to hear the AC anyways because I'm going to put rain sounds on. So like, what the hell?
513000	535000	I'm mad at the people who are going to make me help before you. No. Congrats on quitting. You're such a badass, but honestly, I wouldn't be able to do it if it wasn't for you.
536000	554000	It's because of all the members that I'm able to do this. So I won't give credit where it's due. Yes, if you don't know, I quit my job.
554000	559000	I just smacked my mouth against the mic.
562000	572000	My ear, my hands, my background, and 9 o'clock Eastern time is when my phone goes off, so my ears are red.
572000	583000	I quit my job. It was actually very, very hard. I will probably cry tomorrow morning.
584000	602000	Because, um, I think I'm supposed to cry, but it's because I've been there for almost six years, and...
603000	624000	Oh, goodbye AC, but I've been there for almost six years. It was probably one of the best jobs I ever had until the company started making some changes.
624000	637000	It was time to move on. I had outgrown everything, and I tried, you know, applying for a part-time position and a different part of my store, but it was time, it was time.
638000	647000	I wasn't a manager, but I was a temporary assistant manager for quite some time.
648000	657000	And you see, good this time in the background. Nothing else has changed. I kind of still have a sense.
662000	667000	I hope you have a good time at leverage of what you do.
668000	679000	But I actually started, like, the ASMR, ASMR portion, because I have this whole role-play planned out.
679000	693000	I'm not going to be reading any tonos or supas. You currently can't see any stream elements, tonos, or, and I turned off the words just so you can really immerse yourself.
693000	699000	I want to do, like, a very serious role-play for you, a little bit silly, but mostly serious.
699000	702000	I'm not going to go off the rails like I did last time.
705000	711000	But yeah, we're ourselves in the picture.
711000	718000	Yes, I have so many triggers next to me. Actually, I have to go cook it some more, but I love the other room.
718000	727000	So, let me do that again. I'm sorry. Okay, I can't keep whispering. Let me just turn myself down for a second.
728000	731000	Okay, I'm going to document this a bit.
732000	739000	But, like, lower. So, yeah, it's really hard.
739000	754000	I can't really express how difficult it is, even though it's...
756000	764000	So, before I make this up, I'm going to read the tonos, don't know how many words, but don't miss the stuff on YouTube, so if you want to do that, okay?
765000	770000	Turn myself up again? Okay, sorry.
774000	779000	Yeah, I don't know how that works. I know...
779000	789000	I know some people don't care about it at all, and some people like it right at the end.
789000	802000	Yeah, yeah, it's... My parents are, like, very supportive. I'm obviously generally surprised. Sorry if I hear booby in the background.
805000	808000	But, you know, we'll look for another job.
809000	813000	Guess what?
817000	826000	Health and strength. He doesn't even know how. He just, like, moors. He just goes, like, whew whew whew.
827000	837000	He doesn't open his mouth. He doesn't meow. Yeah, he mows. Yeah, he does. He does a lot of that.
839000	843000	Bring up his staring daggers at him right now.
853000	855000	Okay, he's ignoring me.
857000	861000	Let me see if I can do something.
862000	868000	Like, yeah, I just wanted to, oh my fucking god, rena, what the fuck are you doing?
869000	874000	She just, she just jumped up on my desk and started sniffing the microphone.
876000	882000	Basically, you just get a lot of chatting stream and great past and current don't knows.
887000	889000	What really?
892000	896000	Maybe. Do you think you'd be good part of her?
897000	899000	Possibly.
900000	904000	I mean, I guess we could probably do something.
905000	908000	She slipped down. She was, like, a little suspicious.
911000	917000	Okay, so I'm gonna get rid of, like, some of the noise that's going on.
918000	926000	It's getting deep off. I think it's, like, my neighbor's voice is going off.
926000	929000	It just has a popping noise.
938000	940000	Whoa.
941000	945000	Can you hear that? I don't know if you can.
946000	948000	Huh? Okay.
949000	951000	Now I see for you.
953000	955000	Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
958000	960000	Jesus fucking Christ.
960000	962000	I'm so sorry.
965000	970000	I know that this sounds the same on the 3D hotel.
971000	977000	But, um, bearing off like it went down is more, that's actually the good thing.
979000	980000	Louder.
981000	983000	This is literally my reason.
984000	989000	And then, like, the 3D picks up every little vibration.
989000	990000	Hortics.
991000	994000	And then I try to just always go, go, go.
994000	1001000	And just, like, we're, I mean, I'm still sitting on my desk just staring at the 3D.
1001000	1003000	I'm gonna go over there.
1012000	1022000	But I, you know, I wanted to be able to, um, just rub a bit so I can help my abs out.
1022000	1024000	And I can check on you guys.
1024000	1027000	You can see where my head is at, you know.
1028000	1031000	Uh, she knows that you guys are with me, yes.
1033000	1039000	Um, cause I just, I might, like, cause like, what I was thinking.
1040000	1048000	I read the donos at the end in the soopas, but then I kinda like, cut it from the void.
1048000	1050000	I don't know if that's like, inappropriate.
1050000	1051000	Again, I know.
1052000	1054000	I'm not used to this.
1054000	1057000	So, please tell me what you think is best.
1057000	1061000	I am willing to take any advice you can take.
1062000	1065000	Um, hello everybody, just coming in.
1065000	1067000	Cause I don't have a special pass.
1067000	1069000	Yeah, can't we take on someone?
1072000	1073000	Again.
1075000	1081000	But, um, I'm kinda in a world of emotions right now.
1081000	1087000	So, it might be a little, um, next few days.
1089000	1093000	Could leave a little bit of thought and cut off the beginning of the next day.
1093000	1095000	Oh, that's a good idea.
1096000	1098000	That's a good idea.
1098000	1100000	I actually might do that as far as I can.
1100000	1102000	I accidentally did that the next day.
1102000	1108000	I like, come out, I just like tried to, I just like, saved it as a new video.
1108000	1110000	People were like laughing at me about it.
1110000	1111000	I was like, cool man.
1111000	1113000	God damn it, I fucked it up again.
1114000	1116000	Um, I might do that.
1116000	1117000	I might do that.
1117000	1118000	Good idea.
1119000	1121000	Um, that's my good idea.
1122000	1127000	But yeah, it's, um, I already had my job.
1127000	1130000	I like, mentored a lot of people.
1130000	1133000	I was like, a new manager for a band.
1133000	1141000	Um, I have amazing customers, amazing co-workers, um, on-state, amazing management.
1141000	1143000	I won't lie about that.
1143000	1151000	We have, like, a bet of minutes, but then, like, the values of the company kind of dramatically changed in this act.
1151000	1155000	Like, we're all so close.
1156000	1158000	Um, my store was super huge.
1158000	1161000	We had, like, over a hundred employees.
1161000	1166000	Um, and I can, like, 100% send me that.
1166000	1168000	Most people were by family.
1168000	1173000	Like, it sounds stupid, but, like, they were really awesome.
1173000	1180000	Um, and, and I started there when I was younger.
1180000	1183000	And then, I kind of, like, grew up in the store.
1183000	1186000	Like, I mean, I had a lot of experience.
1186000	1191000	Um, learning how to be, like, in the customer-based position.
1191000	1196000	And it was just, it was just really awesome.
1196000	1199000	Um, being someone to ask for a job site sale.
1199000	1202000	I'm in the hallway with four of my best friends.
1202000	1205000	I've had my own job, and all of them just left.
1205000	1207000	And a lot of them drained me.
1207000	1209000	And it was just kind of funny because now,
1209000	1211000	we've been following in our footsteps.
1211000	1218000	Um, got up out of by someone.
1218000	1225000	No, no, it's like, um, my company is humongous.
1225000	1227000	Uh, I'll say that much.
1227000	1229000	Um, my ex-company.
1229000	1234000	Um, it's all about what had happened.
1234000	1238000	It's just, like, you know, corporations, for instance.
1238000	1240000	You know how corporations are.
1240000	1247000	They just, uh, sometimes, yeah, they intersect.
1247000	1248000	They're corporations.
1248000	1249000	They're corporations.
1249000	1251000	And they need to make profit.
1251000	1255000	Uh, sometimes, though, so there are values about their place
1255000	1258000	and their staff aside to kind of be like,
1258000	1260000	okay, how do we make more money?
1260000	1263000	You know, to sacrifice that, maybe,
1263000	1265000	don't drink the staff as well,
1265000	1269000	or maybe, like, you're in a hiring freeze for a long time.
1269000	1271000	I mean, you did hire people,
1271000	1273000	but it's just stressed us,
1273000	1276000	that we're going to put us in other places
1276000	1280000	just to want to be, that wasn't our only job, you know?
1280000	1281000	Like...
1290000	1301000	But yeah, it's, it is what it is, you know?
1301000	1304000	If this one dude just struggled to hear me,
1304000	1306000	I bet he might be broke,
1306000	1308000	because everybody else seems fine.
1308000	1309000	I'm so sorry.
1309000	1314000	Yeah, they hurt themselves a lot, right?
1314000	1319000	Like, a lot of people are leaving my company right now.
1319000	1323000	Um, and, like, I'm not the first person,
1323000	1326000	like, me and one person,
1326000	1329000	literally left the same day.
1329000	1331000	And then, I think,
1331000	1333000	and another person was telling me
1333000	1335000	they just put in their two weeks.
1335000	1337000	It was so...
1337000	1340000	It is what it is.
1340000	1342000	So...
1342000	1345000	I should probably come over here next minute.
1345000	1347000	Yeah.
1349000	1353000	Like, my reading, like, it wasn't normal reading.
1353000	1355000	Um...
1355000	1358000	They had a very...
1358000	1360000	Oh my god, I guess.
1360000	1361000	So much noise.
1361000	1363000	Why are you doing it?
1368000	1369000	Okay, there.
1369000	1370000	They're playing with toys.
1370000	1373000	Um, Raina is slowly sleeping on my desk now,
1373000	1375000	right next to my third deal.
1375000	1378000	Um, like, I don't want to take a picture.
1378000	1380000	She's sitting on my phone, never mind.
1380000	1384000	Oh, my phone is lost due to the warmth that is raining.
1384000	1386000	But they were all super happy,
1386000	1388000	and I was like, oh, I'm streaming full time,
1388000	1390000	because a lot of them, um,
1390000	1393000	oh my god, they...
1393000	1396000	stopped.
1396000	1400000	Um, a lot of them know that, um,
1400000	1402000	I'm a streamer.
1402000	1404000	It's uncompressed.
1404000	1407000	Um, they don't let me know what I am,
1407000	1409000	but, like, they're cool about it.
1409000	1411000	They're like, ah, I couldn't read it on the head.
1411000	1412000	It's so cool.
1412000	1414000	I would say, like, I know what made this person
1414000	1417000	not like my mom, me, duper on the Internet.
1417000	1420000	Nobody knows what a fucking me, duper is, bro.
1423000	1426000	You guys don't know the spell Raina or Boomi's name,
1426000	1428000	and then it's kind of funny.
1430000	1434000	Um, yeah, she's literally alone on my desk.
1434000	1437000	The first move is stream every day.
1437000	1439000	No, I'm kidding, um,
1439000	1441000	I'm probably gonna start me streaming
1441000	1443000	in my normal times after this week again.
1443000	1445000	Uh, like, 4 p.m. in the start time
1445000	1447000	and do, like, five days a week,
1447000	1449000	because I realize I need a time to relax
1449000	1451000	and I need a time to clean my house.
1451000	1453000	It's the same fucking mess.
1453000	1455000	I know, I know Raina,
1455000	1460000	Raina, the queen in Espanol,
1460000	1462000	but she is Raina,
1462000	1464000	and there's someone that I liked
1464000	1467000	a lot in, uh, America's Next Stop Model.
1467000	1468000	Hello.
1471000	1472000	Uh,
1473000	1474000	A
1475000	1476000	I
1479000	1480000	A
1481000	1482000	A, Raina.
1483000	1486000	And then Boomi is Boomi from Avatar,
1486000	1488000	Game of Omosha.
1488000	1491000	Um, he goes by Boompster.
1491000	1495000	Um, Metro Woman wants a more
1495000	1497000	game of word.
1497000	1498000	Um,
1498000	1502000	I don't know, he goes by, um,
1503000	1506000	oh no, he got an M, so sorry.
1506000	1510000	Um, he goes by Boomi, Boomerton.
1512000	1514000	He's still sp-spelled Raina Rock,
1514000	1517000	but it's okay, I love it best.
1517000	1521000	And then Fia is M-I-N.
1527000	1529000	Somebody thought of this full name
1529000	1530000	was Metro Boomin.
1530000	1534000	I'm like, you think I need my fucking cat,
1534000	1536000	Metro Boomin?
1536000	1539000	Who the fuck names her cat, Metro Boomin?
1539000	1540000	What?
1541000	1542000	Raina?
1542000	1544000	Is she fucking Australian?
1545000	1550000	Although, um, in their, like, veterinary files
1550000	1554000	like Fia is Fia the Deathbed Companion,
1554000	1557000	redacted, aka my last name,
1557000	1560000	and then Boomi is Boomi, King of Omoshu,
1560000	1563000	redacted, my last name.
1567000	1570000	So yeah, um,
1570000	1573000	I have allergies.
1573000	1575000	Oh my god.
1577000	1578000	Yeah, that's the problem,
1578000	1580000	but then Raina's just a big mama.
1580000	1584000	Uh, she's also known as Jabba the Cat,
1584000	1588000	um, Queen of the, um,
1590000	1591000	Mamas.
1591000	1593000	But hey, Mamas.
1595000	1598000	I'm gonna pick up other things from her.
1599000	1602000	My dad calls her.
1602000	1604000	Yeah, Jabba the Cat.
1605000	1608000	Well, my dad calls her a wombat,
1608000	1611000	although he gets a wombat.
1611000	1613000	I've used some Happy Bar all the time,
1613000	1615000	so that's what it really means.
1623000	1625000	What is...
1626000	1629000	I'm trying to think what was going to say ever again.
1631000	1634000	Boomi, King of Omoshu, my last name.
1639000	1641000	Yeah, they're all wonderful kids,
1641000	1645000	and, um, Raina used to have a sister named Soleil,
1645000	1647000	before she passed away,
1647000	1650000	and she was, um, because of Raina,
1650000	1653000	so like, Raina and son, um,
1653000	1656000	yeah, I miss her, she's great.
1656000	1659000	But yeah, it actually reminds me a lot of her.
1659000	1662000	They have really similar personalities.
1664000	1667000	And then, before that, um,
1667000	1669000	all my other parents were named after
1669000	1671000	Bible characters,
1671000	1673000	because I remember I grew up
1673000	1676000	with a religious household, so, yeah.
1679000	1681000	I was like,
1681000	1683000	I don't remember it, like, church.
1683000	1685000	I was talking to
1685000	1687000	me and my, um,
1687000	1689000	like, my best friend at the time.
1689000	1691000	Mind you, we're like, fucking dead.
1691000	1693000	And we're like, am I good?
1693000	1695000	If we ever had a son, we, um,
1695000	1697000	like, us together, we're like,
1697000	1699000	if I ever had a son,
1699000	1701000	like, well, we'd name ourselves.
1701000	1703000	And I was, like, dead set
1703000	1705000	on naming my kid Artist Xease,
1705000	1707000	because the fucking badass name,
1707000	1710000	like, just called art for sure.
1710000	1712000	I'm like, oh, is it sure for Arthur?
1712000	1714000	No, bitch, it's sure for Artist Xease.
1714000	1717000	Kick Artist Xease.
1719000	1721000	Form of Fusula.
1721000	1723000	Uh, uh.
1723000	1730000	A-R-D-E-X-E-R-X-E-S.
1734000	1737000	Um, and then my friend was like,
1737000	1739000	I would just
1739000	1741000	call, call my kid Paul,
1741000	1743000	I'd like to go off this.
1743000	1745000	Not those are loud.
1748000	1750000	Jesus, I brought you some
1750000	1752000	uh, rickets and some murder.
1752000	1754000	Murder.
1754000	1756000	Oh, Judas.
1757000	1759000	Great fun.
1759000	1761000	I'd have a son so I could
1761000	1764000	be pulling your son from behind me.
1764000	1766000	Um, but then I decided
1766000	1768000	that if I ever got, like, a badass dog,
1768000	1770000	that was a boy dog,
1770000	1772000	I'd name my, um, Artist Xease,
1772000	1774000	or, like, some sort of just
1774000	1777000	crazy-ass name.
1778000	1781000	Um, and if I had a girl dog,
1781000	1785000	I'd want a great pair of these,
1785000	1787000	and I want to name her Ducky,
1787000	1790000	and she's gonna make you cute and fluffy,
1790000	1792000	and she's gonna guard
1792000	1795000	all my livestock at my farm.
1797000	1800000	I don't think Ducky's cute.
1808000	1810000	I should blow my nose.
1817000	1819000	Uh, mind your ears.
1827000	1830000	Name the kids after
1830000	1832000	altering characters to be super cool,
1832000	1834000	actually. Oh my god, I just kind of,
1834000	1836000	kind of burped before.
1844000	1846000	If I can name a me too,
1846000	1848000	don't worry, it will seem good.
1848000	1850000	Shut up.
1850000	1852000	My son. Oh, good.
1852000	1854000	Nobody cares about your penny,
1854000	1856000	is great.
1856000	1858000	Hate, hate, hate...
1858000	1861000	Now are you gonna see me play
1861000	1864000	Elderdream DLC? Again, I don't
1864000	1866000	have an Elderdream for BC,
1866000	1868000	I played it on PS5.
1868000	1871000	It's a comfort game of mine,
1871000	1874000	and I'm debating whether or not
1874000	1876000	I should embarrass myself by playing it
1876000	1879000	online, um, and streaming.
1879000	1881000	Just because.
1881000	1883000	Like, I'm not good at games,
1883000	1888000	Good at games, I like to take my time with them, so, you know.
1890680	1895680	I don't know, I don't want people to see me try hard.
1895880	1899080	Just watch Johnny play, she's hardly playing it this week,
1899080	1902440	I'm pretty sure, next week, you know.
1904720	1909040	I'm not like, I will play it from some, okay, maybe.
1909040	1911800	Cause I'm sorry, but I don't wanna play
1911800	1913920	another Crapstrap treasure lesson, like,
1913920	1915360	this sounds like a beat on stream,
1915360	1919160	cause the amp on black, bro, I was dying.
1920800	1922960	Starting to link the shot color.
1922960	1925400	I finally got my throat payouts,
1925400	1927520	so I was able to order my shot color.
1928520	1933280	So that should be it, at some point, I don't fucking know.
1933280	1937960	Cause throat payouts take more than two weeks.
1937960	1942960	I was the first person to have a shot color to my throat,
1944480	1946720	and I'm the last person to get it.
1952080	1956200	I think, I'm gonna move right now, cause she's,
1956200	1959760	well, she looks really comfy, but I need to,
1959760	1961840	oh, she fell asleep, I can't move her now.
1964640	1966040	I can't move this old lady.
1967040	1969480	I'm so cute, my god.
1971720	1974440	She's a dead out of dead love right now,
1974440	1975920	I'm not gonna lie.
1975920	1979000	Perfectly dug to no tail on sight.
1979000	1981160	Amazing form, dead out of dead love.
1987320	1991760	I'm also debating from switching from headphones
1991760	1994600	to, like, over the ear headphones to any ear headphones,
1994680	1998640	I'm realizing that headphones kind of hurt my ears.
1998640	2001640	I'm due at least to put my contacts in every time I stream.
2005200	2008520	Because my glasses, plus, just, I don't know,
2008520	2010320	do have a big head, maybe, I don't know,
2010320	2013080	maybe I got a big head, not a big head's brain.
2015200	2017440	I don't know, hope to one day eat.
2021240	2022080	Perfect.
2023080	2026480	That's the best, that's the best, that's the best.
2026480	2028960	Double-tie a five-head old bookie-gulu,
2028960	2030520	I mean, no, I won't, in my grip.
2032200	2035280	But in short, before I start streaming,
2035280	2038960	just know this is like a little role-playing new one,
2038960	2040080	I hope you like it.
2043280	2046000	Thank you guys so much for watching,
2046000	2047600	do put my jobs in.
2048560	2049640	Good to have done it.
2049640	2053520	I want to help you, all my, my, members,
2053520	2057440	strong, me, the girls, are so supportive,
2057440	2060600	and like, they're really my personal cheerleaders,
2060600	2064760	and I can't wait for them to, I don't know,
2064760	2066080	I don't know, I want some job,
2066080	2068040	but who doesn't help me on this, you know?
2069840	2073280	Like, they, when I'm like, move out, or change jobs,
2073280	2076080	or I hope they also get the opportunity,
2078360	2081680	no, I don't want to, so I'll bring anything,
2081680	2084400	because it is better to be free,
2084400	2086880	I love my job, it just changed, you know?
2086880	2089080	You got, you grow up, and you have to move on.
2094680	2099680	Of course, okay, tell me if this is too loud, okay?
2108360	2109520	Is that too loud?
2110800	2114240	Still, oh, I'm so sorry, okay, let me turn that down.
2114240	2116400	Okay, go, go, go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
2116400	2118400	I'm sorry, hold on, hold on, hold on.
2128040	2131000	Okay, I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit more.
2138600	2141520	Okay, how's that, is that better?
2142440	2143280	Is that better?
2150040	2152440	Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
2152440	2153680	I mean, this sounds so good.
2158440	2160200	It looks so good.
2160200	2162020	Okay, a lot, a lot, a lot.
2162860	2166340	A lot, you can break kisses,
2166340	2169820	because you're about to be insulted a little bit, so.
2172020	2174940	I need to be louder, is that true?
2176460	2181100	I wish, sometimes, okay, YouTube, can you please,
2181100	2184500	please put in channel points, so people can redeem,
2184500	2188820	you're too loud, you're too quiet, I can be loud, okay, fine.
2188820	2189820	Let me turn myself on.
2193020	2198020	How's, how's that, is that, hi, oh, you got the AC,
2204740	2209740	you got the rain, perfect, it's like the AC too,
2214220	2219220	overbearing, or, my game, I'm like 18, it's gonna be real,
2220180	2222180	it's gonna be real, okay.
2222180	2225180	Dan, Dan, Dan, that's Rob, okay, okay.
2230060	2233140	We're gonna just see what happens.
2233140	2234900	Rain covers the AC, okay, perfect,
2234900	2238500	so we got some white noise, I think the AC will be good,
2238500	2241900	because I know this rain is copyright free,
2241900	2244300	but maybe the AC will kind of like,
2245300	2250180	be like the AI, well, I'm like a glaze,
2250180	2254780	so I'll get this again, it's running out of talk to me,
2254780	2257940	it was like, girl, you're gonna demonetize,
2257940	2261100	left or right, you need, and so I've been putting,
2261100	2263860	I'm gonna wear your cover up from now on, I'm sorry,
2265980	2270980	can you copy me, people, copy right, rain, okay, yes,
2271860	2275980	I know, it is what he said, it's what is true,
2275980	2278180	people copy right, fucking everything,
2278180	2282540	even if it's just fucking all beyonds, all beyonds.
2287220	2290220	I'm scared, rain is gonna lean on my keyboard,
2294220	2299220	I think that's good, hi, I don't know if you heard her squeak,
2301980	2305980	oh my god, your breath smells me, look at that,
2317820	2320820	why were you scared about a thunder coming after you?
2320940	2324440	Oh, thunder, thunder, thunder, thundercats,
2327940	2330940	it's really pretty outside, I wish I could take a picture
2330940	2334460	and see if you guys would mind my location,
2337940	2340940	it's like, big sky, and dusky, it's really pretty,
2340940	2344940	It's like pink sky and dusky. It's really pretty.
2348940	2356940	I almost named... I was debating whether or not it would be a Jidaro because she also kind of spots for some reason.
2356940	2359940	She's like really light spots, but I can do that.
2360940	2361940	Okay.
2362940	2363940	Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
2366940	2367940	Okay.
2368940	2369940	Okay.
2369940	2372940	I'll be ready to go get something.
2385940	2386940	Delicious.
2388940	2390940	I'll drink it warm on the heart.
2392940	2393940	Okay, one second.
2397940	2398940	Okay.
2421940	2424940	40 minutes of the appage. Let's go.
2428940	2430940	Sorry to put the phone right now.
2430940	2431940	Okay.
2447940	2450940	And we're starting.
2458940	2459940	Hmm.
2460940	2464940	So weird to find one of those things here.
2465940	2469940	I've never seen anything like this before.
2470940	2473940	What is this? Do you know what side of the rain?
2476940	2478940	It's looking a lot like this.
2478940	2480940	Can't tell what it is.
2481940	2488940	It looks like a piece of trash.
2489940	2491940	I'm pretty sure it is trash.
2492940	2495940	And I still can't place it.
2497940	2504940	I guess I'll have to do some closer inspection.
2505940	2510940	I don't know if I want to get close to it.
2511940	2513940	It looks like it smells bad.
2513940	2515940	I'm pretty sure it smells bad.
2519940	2523940	At least it brought my umbrella, so I won't get soaking wet.
2525940	2526940	Okay.
2526940	2527940	Let's see.
2531940	2532940	Oh god.
2532940	2540940	It looks so much worse and I'm close with it.
2541940	2543940	I don't even know what that is.
2544940	2545940	What is that?
2545940	2546940	What?
2551940	2553940	I'm going to go over here.
2554940	2555940	Oh, yeah.
2557940	2560940	It does smell bad.
2561940	2562940	Gross.
2566940	2567940	No.
2571940	2574940	This has to be trash.
2574940	2577940	It looks like crap.
2577940	2580940	It smells like crap.
2583940	2589940	It does make sense that it's near a dumpster in this alley that I've had.
2591940	2592940	Okay.
2596940	2599940	But I just, I can't tell what it is.
2602940	2604940	Do I want to know what it is?
2607940	2608940	Okay.
2608940	2609940	Let me just...
2621940	2623940	I don't know.
2641940	2643940	I don't know what it is.
2650940	2652940	Yeah.
2680940	2681940	No.
2698940	2699940	No.
2704940	2705940	No.
2710940	2711940	No.
2736940	2737940	Wait.
2738940	2739940	Wait a second.
2741940	2743940	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2745940	2749940	I like stuff I can't tell what it is.
2749940	2750940	Okay.
2750940	2752940	Let me make some notes.
2756940	2762940	Maybe it's like an animal or something.
2764940	2766940	Or a creature.
2767940	2768940	No.
2768940	2769940	No.
2769940	2770940	A creature.
2777940	2778940	No.
2778940	2779940	Okay.
2782940	2783940	No.
2783940	2784940	No.
2784940	2785940	No.
2785940	2786940	No.
2786940	2787940	No.
2787940	2788940	No.
2788940	2789940	No.
2789940	2790940	No.
2790940	2791940	No.
2791940	2792940	No.
2792940	2793940	No.
2793940	2794940	No.
2794940	2795940	No.
2795940	2797940	No, I think so.
2797940	2799940	Alright, let's see here.
2805940	2806940	Yeah.
2810940	2811940	Wow.
2811940	2812940	Okay.
2820940	2823940	Let me remember the pencil on some of them.
2823940	2848940	I can sketch, what if I, oh yeah, shade right there, I'll just wrinkle it, whatever, that's fine, that's fine
2849940	2859940	and now, yeah, now this, this piece of trash is way out of there, that's what I drew, we just sliced that
2864940	2871940	now we're done, now we're done, I've never seen something so disgusting, I sliced that
2871940	2888940	uh, now uh, it's like, it's like genuinely hideous, I can't stand to look at it, but like for science, I'll continue
2889940	2893940	okay, a couple of rounds
2900940	2901940	here
2907940	2909940	shade, okay
2910940	2911940	okay
2915940	2916940	whatever
2917940	2918940	shade, okay
2924940	2931940	okay, one of its, I don't know if that's one, it's, it's just dirty, nothing more
2931940	2940940	okay, wait a second, what do I think?
2940940	2959940	okay, there's like something here, I think I can scratch it off, maybe
2963940	2964940	let's try it out
2971940	2979940	good thing I always have my tools on me to look at weird things and have the face that look like shade
2979940	2980940	shade
2995940	3000940	this thing is kicked on, this is like mud or something like that
3009940	3026940	okay, it's just gonna take a little bit of time
3026940	3028940	okay, let's try it on
3031940	3032940	oh, oh, oh, okay
3034940	3043940	this thing, you may have purchased this thing, that's making it look like shade, but it's made me expect it, so it looks so good
3046940	3048940	it sounds kind of shiny
3052940	3055940	oh, oh, oh, that's disgusting, never mind, let's not do that
3056940	3069940	Okay, now we're getting somewhere.
3069940	3075940	It's a weird, choking substance.
3075940	3080940	It's a weird, trashy object.
3080940	3086940	It reminds me of something here.
3086940	3109940	I'm going to put it over here and just brush the victim.
3110940	3126940	Yeah, what if I do it slower?
3126940	3137940	If you think the stuff will melt away in the rain.
3137940	3140940	I think it doesn't have a mouth.
3140940	3161940	This thing was sitting in my mind.
3161940	3172940	Interesting.
3172940	3174940	My cats get out of here in the rain.
3174940	3186940	I'm crazy.
3186940	3188940	Gosh, this stuff is so cute.
3188940	3190940	You have to put it on.
3190940	3193940	I'm very, very curious.
3193940	3197940	Oh, right here.
3197940	3200940	This one.
3200940	3202940	This one.
3202940	3204940	This one's black.
3204940	3207940	This one.
3207940	3215940	Brush.
3215940	3217940	Brush.
3217940	3219940	To bring it away.
3219940	3231940	Yeah.
3231940	3248940	Better areas over here.
3248940	3271940	How do you even know what you're doing with this stuff?
3271940	3277940	What if this piece of junk is completely useless?
3277940	3287940	What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

3343940	3345940	No, no, no, no.
3345940	3359940	Come on, pick it up.
3359940	3362940	Just toss it off.
3362940	3365940	That was a mess.
3365940	3369940	Just toss it off.
3389940	3399940	Just toss it off.
3399940	3405940	Just toss it off.
3405940	3413940	Just toss it off.
3413940	3418940	That's pretty good.
3418940	3426940	Oh, that was a big piece.
3426940	3429940	Almost there.
3429940	3432940	Barely done, so deep.
3432940	3439940	Just a little deeper.
3439940	3442940	Oh, this is really huge.
3442940	3444940	Do I got it?
3444940	3448940	Come on.

3460940	3471940	Pretty trashy dust.
