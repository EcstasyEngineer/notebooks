MCR song

22
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Wait, is it by MCR?

23
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Or is it by Good Charlotte?

24
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's Teenagers by MCR

25
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Black Parade was written about me

26
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know what one of my

27
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Handles was when I was a kid

28
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was Mistress Muffin

29
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
XXX

30
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I was also like Lady Mistress

31
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't even know what the I didn't even know what that meant

32
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Welcome to the Black Parade

33
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's for like

34
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's like too mainstream for me

35
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You know

36
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I've been day drinking, no

37
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm just talking in a different voice for my

38
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
For my emo face

39
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Lady Mistress

40
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yubi is more a 3-2 for sweet or french time

41
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Or

42
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What's the song?

43
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Local hack tries being cute

44
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm not trying to be cute

45
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm a vampire

46
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Alright

47
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I sleep in a coffin

48
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And you know what

49
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Let me describe my outfit please

50
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I woke up this morning

51
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I put on

52
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
My black lace panties

53
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And my red and black lace bra

54
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I slid on

55
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
My black tights

56
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That were ripped

57
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And I threw on an MCR T-shirt

58
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
In my favorite MCR red hoodie

59
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I put on a choker with a bat on it

60
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And I put on makeup

61
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No foundation though

62
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Cause I'm already so pale and white

63
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You know

64
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not wearing pants

65
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't cut yourself on the edge

66
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't threaten me with a good time

67
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We're uh

68
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000

69
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We're bringing emo

70
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Doraike

71
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Whatever it's called

72
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
My spark

73
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is the skin of a killer Bella

74
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is the skin of a killer

75
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Come on Yubi

76
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
From Hot Topic

78
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And split a marb red

79
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Until we get kicked out

80
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hell yeah

81
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You guys want to go to the mall

82
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to get my clipped pierce at Claire's

83
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I already got my nipples pierced there

84
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You guys

85
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You guys want to get your clipped pierce with me

86
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you mean what

87
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000

91
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000

92
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh okay

93
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah they do

95
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Maybe I'll do a little bit of

96
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
A little bit of shoplifting

97
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
At Spencers

98
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Maybe I'll

You know

100
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Blow a car up

101
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Maybe I'll just hate the patriarchy

102
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Maybe I'll just post pictures of myself on my phone

103
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And revealing poses

104
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't really care much about anything

106
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You know

107
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Cause I'm

108
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Gothic

109
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Can we go to the food court

110
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And order five pounds of Chinese

111
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No I only drink blood

113
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Caring is for preps

Like we don't care here

119
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000

What you might call it

122
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fanfiction that I thought would be funny to read

123
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I didn't read the whole thing

124
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
They said it might be too spicy

125
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000

00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000

My fan

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But I'm still here

144
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Cause I'm a real gothic

145
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And I'm a vampire

146
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And I can't die

147
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Alright

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Welcome to my bedroom

151
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
How many of these do you fan fix?

152
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Did I write?

153
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
None

154
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I just relate to them a lot

155
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You know

156
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000

I'm gonna turn on some other music

158
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Actually no I think this music will be suitable

159
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
For this one

160
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I have like some copyright free

161
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hogwarts themed music

162
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let me move up

163
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Can I move this over?

164
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay

165
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a Harry X Drake one

166
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This one I don't know

167
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's called First Encounter

168
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Thank you to the

169
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Anon that submitted it

170
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The characters in the story

171
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Slowly belong to JK Rowling

172
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Whatever the fuck her name is

173
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
One of her brothers

174
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So it's an unbaited

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know what that means

176
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
In some one shot

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It was made in

178
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
2006

179
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I need to move my

180
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Camera tracker out of the way

181
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Are you ready?

182
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I wanted to make a fanfic

183
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I was worried it would be too long

184
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And no one understands it

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Since I was making a deal

186
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I wrote

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A 100 plus page fanfic

188
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
About how down bad

189
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I was for Zetsu

190
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
From the Akatsuki

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Cause I did a self insert

192
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Of myself and every Shippuden

193
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
My character

194
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
My OC

195
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And every Shippuden episode

196
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That the Akatsuki were in

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
In Daedora

198
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Naturally

199
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
In Kisame

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Naturally

201
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In Pain

202
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And all of them

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Especially Haydn

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're all hot

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay

206
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Her power levels

207
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I also made a young justice

208
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Fanfiction that was 80 pages long

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And I self inserted my OC's

210
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Into every young justice episode

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And I shipped my character

212
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Who was

213
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
By the way

214
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Her name was Missy

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And her last name was Chief

216
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And so her hero name

217
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Was Miss Chief

218
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And she was

219
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Or she would also

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Would get the nickname

221
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Pantamime

222
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And

223
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And she was a shapeshifter

224
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That could

225
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Temporarily

226
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Take on the powers

227
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Of who she shapeshifted into

228
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's why she was called Miss Chief

229
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Cause she would usually just

230
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Fuck shit up

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I was like mistake

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Missy Chief

233
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Melissa Chief

234
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Fucking hilarious

235
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And I shipped myself

236
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
With Clarion

237
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
For some reason

238
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Clarion the witch boy

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What was going on with that

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If you know you know

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sorry yeah

244
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Goth girls don't laugh

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm laughing at

246
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You actually

247
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm laughing at your pain

248
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Cause it

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It awakens something in me

250
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Nobody had no Clarion the witch boy

251
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah it was when

252
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Was I a bottom in my gut

253
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Nope

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No I was mostly

255
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I think I was

256
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because I was such a fucking loser

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And shy

258
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think I made myself the top

259
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
In most scenarios

260
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
In my fanfictions

261
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That I wrote when I was like 14

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah

263
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah well cause Clarion

264
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The witch boy

265
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Shows up in Young Justice

266
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
As like one of the first villains

267
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I just fell in love

268
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm so edgy

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm so edgy

270
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't cut yourself

271
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
On all my edge

272
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Or do cause we're being

273
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Gothic and emo

274
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Just kidding don't

275
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't do that

276
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I do not condone self harm

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It was 40 years ago

278
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Wasn't it?

279
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Azeroth Metrion Zhentos

280
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
First time chatter

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hello hi

282
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I like the anime that your name is from

283
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What about harming others

284
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Only what they say for

285
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Anyways

286
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Let's get started

287
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think I've yapped

288
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Clarion is even using the comics

289
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Is he?

290
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh well he was using the show then

291
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
For some reason

292
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Reina are you singing the song of your people

293
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Sorry

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
She's a

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
She's listening to Good Charlotte right now

296
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And she's singing to it

297
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Cause she's she's Gothic

298
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay

299
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So we're gonna read first encounter

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I think this is like a personification

301
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Of like

302
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Hogwarts

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
For some reason

304
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Very Hattalia axis powers

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Remember Hattalia

306
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh my god

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hattalia

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hattalia

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Sort of thing

310
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Who the fuck is the skinware?

311
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's me

312
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm Shiboni

313
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Shiboni

314
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hogwarts side

315
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And it echoed within its empty halls

316
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
His empty halls

317
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Sorry again

318
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's personified

319
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The students had all left for the summer

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And he felt empty and useless

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hagrid was often around

322
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Reina please

323
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Reina what are you yelling about

324
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I wish you guys could hear her

325
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
She's literally just going

326
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Reina come here

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
She usually has a toy in her mouth

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
She's aware life is pain

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What is that

330
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Was it

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Michael Fassbender

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh

333
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like

334
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Who is like

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
In

336
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In um

337
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Like X-Men first class

338
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I think he's like

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Life is pain

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I can't remember

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Who says that

342
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This is a fanfic

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't know

344
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We'll find out

345
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Hagrid was often around

346
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But he was usually too focused

347
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And bizarre animals

348
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
To fulfill the needs of Hogwarts

349
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Professors would pop in occasionally

350
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But being in magic school

351
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hogwarts didn't need much upkeeping

352
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The little he did need was taken of

353
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
By

354
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Filch

355
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He shuddered

356
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Causing small trembles

357
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Of his halls

358
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That was barely discernible

359
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Except by the spiders and owls

360
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He didn't care much for Filch

361
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Wishing he could

362
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Or Filch

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't

364
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Disclaimer

365
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I've never

366
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I've only read one Harry Potter book

367
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I read the first one

368
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
If you're a Harry Potter fan

369
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't really care

370
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The books are mid

371
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I never put the game

372
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's funny

373
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Cause I love fantasy

374
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But I never got into Harry Potter

375
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't know why

376
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well

377
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
One cause my parents were like

378
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's demonic

379
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And then my dad's like

380
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't fucking care

381
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Actually you can read it

382
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm like alright

383
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Mid at best

385
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'd rather read something else

386
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's when I was like

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Up picks up name of the wind

388
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Picks up the magicians instead

389
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Picks up American gods

390
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He shuddered

391
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Causing small trembles

392
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He didn't care much for Filch

393
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Filch

394
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'mma call him Filch

395
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Pretty light fantasy

396
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Wishing he could walk

397
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Without his squib feet

398
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Touching his magnificent stone floors

399
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He had long since stopped trying to force his floors

400
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Open to swallow Filch

401
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And miss Nor

402
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Miss Nor's hole

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't know any of the characters

404
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Besides

405
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If he kept it up

406
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He would be risking a prolapse staircase

407
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And that was no laughing matter

408
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The giant squid

409
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Saw how miserable Hogwarts was

410
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It was true

411
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That he also missed his students

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But for an entirely different reason

413
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He missed their terrified screams

414
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
As he revealed himself

415
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Rising from the murky depths of the lake

416
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I didn't even know there was a

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Giant squid in this

418
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Fucking series

419
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What?

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah I don't know what they mean by prolapse staircase

421
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Don't ask me

422
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
His huge eyes

423
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Stared mournfully

424
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
At his very large tentacles

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
At one time

426
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He had dreams of being an actor

427
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The larger he grew

428
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Fucking a fucking actor

429
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The larger he grew

430
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The fewer agents and scouts would come calling

431
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Until they finally stopped altogether

432
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
There wasn't much in the market for a squid

433
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That would split a schoolgirl from stem to stern

434
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Goddamn

435
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm a squid now

436
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He stared at his tentacles

437
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
As they moved gently in the current

438
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Schoolgirls were out

439
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
A plan formed in his mind

440
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And he swam to the surface

441
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Hesitating momentarily

442
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Before pulling himself from the water

443
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It ran off his rubbery skin

444
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
As he made his way across the grounds

445
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No humans were around

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
To witness the incredible trek

447
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And no human would believe his eyes

448
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Had he been a witness

449
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Hogwarts watched the giant approach

450
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Giant squid approach

451
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And felt apprehension well up in his kitchen

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I guess I should give it a British accent

453
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What are you doing?

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The words weren't spoken

455
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But they were understood

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Just trust me

457
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The giant squid replied

458
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Caressing Hogwarts's

459
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Outer walls

460
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm not ready

461
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Hogwarts exclaimed

462
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Trying to push the giant squid away

463
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
With his magic

464
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Hogwarts

465
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You're lonely

466
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I can fix that

467
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm lonely

468
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
We don't have to be

469
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Besides

470
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You can't go around manipulating your staircases

471
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You know about that

472
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Everyone does it

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sort of

474
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's besides the point

475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I've never

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The temperature within

477
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Rose in embarrassment

478
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll go slow

479
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I promise

480
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
He began to caress a window

481
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Teasing it open

482
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Hogwarts sighed

483
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The fight leaving him

484
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He relaxed

485
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Allowing the tentacle inside

486
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Where it brushed against the inner walls

487
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Before settling on the stone floor

488
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He fashioned the suction cups to the floor

489
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Lifting the tentacle away

490
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So that it pulled the floor

491
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
On the floor without losing its grip

492
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Another sigh

493
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Swept through the halls of Hogwarts

494
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, Merlin

495
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That feels so good

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
His rapture tap turned to fright

497
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
As he fell the tentacle work its way

498
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Into a second window

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't

500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Trust me

501
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It'll feel good

502
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Remember this?

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Wait, there's 80 pages?

504
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You're lying

505
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Okay, no, it's only one page

506
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?

507
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm like, I'm not

508
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Reading all of this

509
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If um

510
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
If it's 80 pages

511
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Trust me

512
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It'll feel good

513
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Remember this?

514
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
He pulled the suction cups a little harder

515
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And Hogwarts grown

516
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Do that again

517
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The giant squid complied as he did so

518
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Thrust the second tentacle in

519
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Hogwarts shuttered

520
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Coming very close to ending the fun

521
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The giant squid backed off

522
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Unwilling to finish so soon

523
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
He waited for Hogwarts to calm down

524
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Before sending the second tentacle

525
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
To search the room

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He felt a need to fill Hogwarts

527
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
As much as possible

528
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And erased another tentacle

529
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Caressing his outer walls

530
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Running along windowsills

531
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And tracing individual bricks

532
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So caught up in the blizz

533
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Hogwarts didn't even notice

534
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The giant squid slipped in a third

535
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And a fourth tentacle

536
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This is incredible

537
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Hogwarts breathed

538
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This isn't even the best part

539
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He held up his two longest tentacles

540
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
These can reach further than the room

541
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
They can go into your hallways

542
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I want them in me

543
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Are you sure?

544
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
They're quite large

545
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Opera henshin rolled through his kitchen again

546
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
While he was deciding

547
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The giant squid forced another tentacle in

548
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You have three tentacles left to decide

549
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What happens if I don't?

550
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
In response

551
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The giant squid slid a sixth

552
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Into another window

553
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Two

554
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He simply

555
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And with a hint of warning

556
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
He said simply

557
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
With a hint of warning

558
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Hogwarts could take them all

559
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
He knew he could

560
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What would the other wizarding schools think?

561
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Would Boba Tons allow a giant squid

562
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
To violate her?

563
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Certainly not

564
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If DermString ever found out

565
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
There'd be no end of teasing

566
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The giant squid grew impatient

567
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Slid a seventh tentacle into a window

568
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Falled immediately by an eighth

569
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
One

570
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Two

571
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Times up

572
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And you didn't decide

573
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What?

574
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But that's not fair

575
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Why would this wizard get nuked?

576
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
This is perfectly normal

577
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
This is fine

578
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This is Hogwarts the building

579
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What?

580
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But that's not fair

581
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's a simple answer

582
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I guess I know

583
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Now I'll have to punish you

584
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And with that

585
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
He struck Hogwarts square

586
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
On the outer wall of a paddle-like tentacle

587
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Hogwarts yelped

588
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And tried to square it away

589
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But the tentacles and his foundation

590
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Held firm

591
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
The giant squid struck him with the other

592
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Again and again

593
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He spanked the naughty wizarding school

594
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Until he sawed for the giant squid to stop

595
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And still

596
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He spanked

597
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This makes me feel funny in my bathroom

598
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You like my outfit?

599
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Good

600
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You better

601
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I dressed up

602
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
All nice and pretty

603
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
For myself, not for you

604
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You thought this was for you

605
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Baka

606
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't do anything for you

607
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The giant squid finally stopped

608
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But Hogwarts didn't have time

609
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
For reprieve before the giant squid

610
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Forced his extra-long

611
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Spanking tentacles into two separate windows

612
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They slipped through the room

613
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And forced the doors open

614
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The pain only adding to Hogwarts' pleasure

615
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The tentacles were in the hall now

616
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Massaging the long stone

617
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Tunnels

618
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
This was incredible

619
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The giant squid thought

620
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
He really should have done this

621
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
At ages ago

622
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Every tentacle was in a different window

623
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No school girl

624
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
No matter how many movies she made

625
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Could hold all tentacles

626
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
At ten tentacles at once

627
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Each one moved differently

628
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And with a different pace

629
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Driving Hogwarts crazy

630
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
With the inability to match his speed

631
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm just waiting to get a raid

632
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Or someone like I know come in

633
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And be like, hey, what are you?

634
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, God

635
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
He felt that familiar feeling

636
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And doubled his efforts

637
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Ink exploded all over Hogwarts

638
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Some finding its way into the windows

639
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
He unified his tentacles

640
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
With the ability to match his speed

641
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm just waiting to get a raid

642
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Or someone like I know come in

643
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And be like, hey, what are you?

644
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh, God

645
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He felt that familiar feeling

646
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And doubled his efforts

647
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And unified his tentacles

648
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Somewhat completely unified

649
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Can we focus on Hogwarts?

650
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
He must be close

651
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Then it happened

652
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Water shot of a faucet

653
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Toilets overflowed

654
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And bread set in ovens

655
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
To keep warm by thoughtful house elves

656
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Exploded

657
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Hogwarts shook violently

658
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Into his foundations

659
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Rousing filled from bed

660
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And sitting house elves

661
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And Mrs. Norris scrambling for cover

662
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Even Hagrid heard the groan

663
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Of stone and came running

664
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
They searched around the castle

665
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And through the castle

666
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But found no sign of intruders

667
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Most perplexing was the stinky ink

668
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
On one side of the castle

669
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Hagrid peered to the dark

670
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Towards the lake

671
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But was unable to see the ripples left

672
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
In the wake of the giant squid

673
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
The giant squid slipped beneath the waves

674
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Wanting to grin even though

675
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
His beak was incapable

676
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
He anticipated a very short summer

677
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Before the professors and students returned

678
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So he had better make the most of it

679
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And seen

680
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That was it

681
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
That was a first encounter

682
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
By a

683
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Lyrus Malachi

684
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Sorry, Fia is also meowing

685
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What is going on guys?

686
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
What you mean by that?

687
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't know

688
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't know

689
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't know

690
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Come on guys

691
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What you meowing about?

692
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, I was hoping some of you guys

693
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Would have written me some cringe fanfictions

694
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Of me and the girls

695
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Or me and

696
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
A harem

697
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
A harlot

698
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No

699
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Shook my

700
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Shook my

701
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Foundations

702
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'll tell you what

703
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Cringe but Kino

704
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, a singular

705
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Member of the harem

706
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Is called a harlot

707
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Or a harlot

708
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I can't write good

709
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That's the whole point

710
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Just wait

711
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Just wait till I read my immortal guys

712
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I was disappointed

713
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There was no line as memorable as

714
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Hold on tight spider monkey

715
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Different franchise

716
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But understood

717
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay, let's go to the next one

718
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm going to turn off my BGM

719
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Because I'm going to put on some Hogwarts related music

720
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Wait, I don't think I have the donation stuff on here

721
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Hold on

722
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Apologies

723
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
There it is, okay

724
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, I didn't have the donation alert

725
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So if you did, I'm sorry, I didn't catch it

726
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So let me double check that real quick

727
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Thank you bun for the tip

728
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I vastly underestimated the level of

729
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Cringe you desired

730
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I have to recalibrate all systems

731
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Precisely

732
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I wanted the cringiest stuff

733
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay, let me see

734
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
If I play this, will it work again?

735
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, aren't you just this

736
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Cool beads

737
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Recalibrating

738
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Recalibrating

739
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Okay

740
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Fuck

741
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I want to cover this fucking dude

742
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Get rid of this

743
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Nobody needs to see fucking Eric

744
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
No males on the stream

745
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Aw frick

746
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay, so this is my favorite fanfiction

747
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Of all time

748
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I hope you will enjoy

749
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Because I know I will

750
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's yeah, it's a pretty

751
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You're right, I set a pretty high bar

752
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
For that

753
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Feel, what do you want?

754
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I know you don't need me

755
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
My cats are just little

756
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's what they eat, but yes

757
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's a cover up Eric

758
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's just pretty normie

759
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Well, I feel like now it's normie

760
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Can I?

761
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
If I zoom in more, it's just not going to work out

762
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Where is

763
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Is that too loud?

764
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes, it is named after the

765
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Evanescent song

766
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's a bit loud

767
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Half the text in blue is because

768
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's like

769
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
They'll

770
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
They have like corrections and stuff

771
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
In fact, I can turn that off

772
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So now

773
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
He doesn't do that

774
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Seems okay

775
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Bring it down a tad

776
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But

777
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Titans

778
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
No, it's

779
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Harry Potter inspired background study music

780
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Fall vibes

781
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hogwarts music inspired

782
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And it is copy

783
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000

I'm going under

787
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Oh my god, Fia

788
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What the hell are you doing?

789
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You're going to burn yourself on my team

790
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you trying to kill yourself?

791
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Fia

792
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
She was like

793
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Accidentally kicked me in the face

794
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I was trying to put her down

795
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Turn this down

796
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
We're good, we're good

797
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Wait, did that correct to the grammar?

798
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Because I don't

799
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Without the grammar correction

803
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I want the original

804
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
She's such like a cutesy meow

923
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,680
What are you doing? You want a toy?

924
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,320

Last six springs so they just knock them away for the video

928
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Okay

929
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Okay

930
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,840

Milfoy kind of the story was conferred no the story is real life

932
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
Okay, we don't need to talk to janice

933
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,520

934
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:05,440
The next day so chapter two thanks to bloody tears 666 for helping me with the chapter

935
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,800
BTW prep stop flim in my story, okay?

936
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,960
The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again

937
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,320
I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had

938
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,640
My coffin was black ebony and inside was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends

939
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,560
I got on my coffin and took off my giant and I'm gonna say I'm not gonna correct anything that she says

940
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,640
And I took off my giant mcr t-shirt, which I use for pajamas

941
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,720
Instead I put on black leather dress a pentagram necklace combat boots and black fishnets on

942
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,520
I put on four pairs of earrings and my pierced ears and put my hair in kind of a messy bun

943
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
My friend willow

944
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,440
This is like Irel friend woke up and then grinned at me

945
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,880
She flipped her long waist length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her four screen eyes

946
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,000
She put on her maryland manson t-shirt with a black mini fishnets pointy hide-heeled boots

947
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,760
We put on her makeup black lipstick without foundation and black eyeliner

948
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,640
I'm just gonna use my normal voice for willow because she doesn't show up too much

949
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,480
Oh my fucking god, I saw you talking to drago mouthful yesterday. She said excitedly. Yeah, so I said blushing

950
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,520
Do you like drago?

951
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,920
She asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into of course their Slytherin and into the gray hall

952
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,640
No, I so fucking don't

953
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Yeah, right. She exclaimed

954
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Just then drago walked up to me

955
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
Hi, he said

956
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
Hi, I replied

957
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,880
alertly

958
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,880
Guess what he said

959
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,440
What I asked well

960
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,280
Good charlotte are having a concert in hogsmeade. He told me

961
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,800
Oh my fucking god, I screamed

962
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,840
I loved you see they're my favorite band besides mcr

963
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,760
Well, do you want to go out with me wait?

964
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,320
Well, do you want to go with me he asked I gasped

965
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
I'm not gonna read all the office notes

966
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,000
On the night of the concert I might just read like the exposition in my normal voice

967
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,000
On the night of the concert I put on my black lace up boots with high heels

968
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,080
God fucking damn she she has to tell you how well she dresses

969
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,160
Underneath them are ripped red fishnets

970
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,760
Then I put on a black leather mini dress with all this corset stuff on the back and the front

971
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,240
I put on matching fishnet on my arm

972
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,800
Arms I straightened my hair and made it look all spiky. I felt a little depressed. So then I slit one of my wrists

973
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,080
I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding and I listened to this gc

974
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,440
I painted my nails black and put on tons of black eyeliner

975
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,840
Then I put on some black lipstick. I didn't put on fedation because I was pale anyways

976
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,880
I don't know what happened to the rest of the time before that, but okay

977
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,700
I drank some human blood. So I was ready to go to the concert

978
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
Spiky like Goku

979
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,300
I went outside drago was hold on actually I should put a disclaimer for that. Yeah

980
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
I

981
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,560
Disclaimer trigger warning

982
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,120

983
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,360
Vegeta ass hairline take a sip of tea

984
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
I

985
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,800
Went outside drago was waiting there in front of his flying car

986
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,000
He was wearing a simple planned t-shirt. They would play at the show too

987
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,600
Baggy black skater pants black nail polish and a little eyeliner

988
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,600

989
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,400
A lot felt cool boys wear it. Okay

990
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,560
Hi drago. I said under the depressed voice

991
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,440
Hi bunny. He said back

992
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:15,040
We walked into his into his flying black mercedes benz the license plate said 666 and flew to the place with the concert

993
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,640
On the way we listened excitedly to good charlotte and maryland manson

994
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,200
We both smoked cigarettes and drugs

995
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,920
When we got there we both hopped out of the car

996
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,400
We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to good charlotte

997
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,920
We smoked some drugs

998
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Uh

999
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,000
I don't know how the song goes so i'm just gonna sing it badly

1000
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,760
You come in cold you covered in blood

1001
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,120
They're all so happy you've arrived the doctor cuts your cord hands you to your mom

1002
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,360
She sets you free to this live

1003
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,240
sang joel

1004
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,160
Joel is so fucking hot

1005
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,560
I said to drago pointing to him as he sung filling the club with his amazing voice

1006
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
Suddenly drago looks sad

1007
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,480
What's wrong? I asked his mom to the music then I caught on

1008
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,640
Hey, it's okay. I don't like him better than you I said

1009
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,560
Really asked drago sensitively and he put around his arm around me all protective

1010
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,520
Really I said besides I don't even know joel and he's going out with hillary fucking duff

1011
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,720
I fucking hate that little bitch. I said disgustedly thinking of her ugly blonde face

1012
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,160
The night went on really well and I had a great time so did drago

1013
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,480
After the concert we drank some beer and asked benji and joel for their autographs and photos with them

1014
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,960
We got gc concertees drago and I crawled back into the mercedes-benz

1015
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,120
But drago didn't go back to hogwarts instead he drove the car into

1016
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,120
The forbidden forest

1017
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,120
There's some omega first jargon

1018
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:03,120
She'd be sorry like that got me feeling emotions the edge is blinding ouch ouchy

1019
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,120
I don't know what the omega verses

1020
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,120
What is that can someone explain that to me

1021
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,120

A few ways to explain omega verse I'm reading on this regattas covered

1033
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:21,120
Fia stop meowing especially because the concept pilot she likes to meow a lot when she plays I don't even know why I gave her a toy

1034
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:31,120
The concept revolves around the notion that in an alternate universe society and members are split into three categories alphas betas and omegas

1035
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,120
Oh

1036
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:43,120
But not in the Andrew Tate type of way. Oh, they had to justify that. Oh, I thought it was gonna be like

1037
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,120
I thought it was gonna be like furry, but it just it's still kind of weird though

1093
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,120
What I snapped

1094
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,120
Draco leaned in extra close

1095
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,120
And I looked into his gothic red eyes

1096
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,120
He was wearing color contacts

1097
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,120
Which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and suddenly I didn't feel mad anymore

1098
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,120
And then justice

1099
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,120
Suddenly just as I

1100
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,120
Draco kissed me passionately

1101
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,120
Draco climbed on top of me

1102
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,120
We start to make out keenly against a tree

1103
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,120
He took off my top and I took off his clothes

1104
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,120
I even took off my bra

1105
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Then he put his thingy in my new you know what we did it for the first time

1106
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Oh

1107
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,120
I screamed I was beginning to get an orgasm

1108
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,120
We started to kiss everywhere

1109
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,120
My pale body became warm and then

1110
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:12,120
What the hell are you doing mother fucker

1111
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,120

1114
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,120
Gangster voice

1115
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,120
Emmy voice

1116
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120

1117
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,120
You want my

1118
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,120
You want the roadman Londoner for Dumbledore

1119
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,120
Next patient audio script leak

1120
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,120
Audio script leak

1121
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,120
This fanfic was made in like 2009 I think

1122
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,120
Okay put it to a poll

1123
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,120
Dumbledore doesn't talk too often in the beginning but

1124
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,120
He also gets called Dumbledore a lot

1125
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,120
Londoner

1126
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,120
Old man British

1127
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,120
Cute and funny

1128
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,120
Because you might want to say the cute and funny voice for another person

1129
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,120
Or cowboy because I like the idea of a cowboy

1130
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:36,120
What is bricks but the you guys say like areas that you think I know about

1131
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:48,120
I need to write the viewer girls into my mortal oh my god that would that would literally make my entire life

1132
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,120
I could die happily if that happened

1133
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,120
Let me give a sample

1134
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,120
What the hell are you doing mother fuckers

1135
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,120
What the hell are you doing you mother fuckers

1136
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,120
It was Dumbledore

1137
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:08,120
Holy fucking shit what the fuck are you doing mother fuckers

1138
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,120
British rappers are from Brixton

1139
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:16,120
What houses would the girls be

1140
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,120
Icy would be Hufflepuff

1141
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:24,120
I would be Gryffindor

1142
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,120
Zura would be Hufflepuff

1143
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:34,120
Strawny would be Gryffindor

1144
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,120
Emmy would be Slytherin

1145
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,120
Mercy would be Ravenclaw

1146
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,120
Mhmm mhmm mhmm mhmm

1147
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,120
That's just my guess

1148
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:56,120
Alright what the hell are you doing you mother fuckers

1149
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:04,120
It was Dumbledore I need to make a note somebody make a note of all the voices belong to who

1150
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:11,120
Dumbledore made me made Andrako and I follow him he kept shouting I was angrily

1151
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,120
You ludicrous fools he shouted I started to cry tears of blood down my pallid face

1152
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Draco comforted me

1153
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:24,120
When we went back to the castle Dumbledore took us to Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall who were both fucking very angry

1154
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:30,120
They were having sexual intercourse in the forbidden forest I'm sorry I'm like goofy

1155
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,120
They were having sexual intercourse

1156
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,120
These fucking kids

1157
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:41,120
They were having sexual intercourse in the forbidden forest

1158
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,120
Iha he yelled in a furious voice

1159
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:48,120
Why did you do such a thing you mediocre dumpsies

1160
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,120
Asked Professor McGonagall

1161
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,120
How dare you

1162
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,120
Demanded Professor Snape I can't do a Snape voice

1163
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:01,120
How dare you

1164
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,120
Mickey

1165
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,120
How dare you

1166
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,120
Andrako shrieked because I love her

1167
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,120
Wait why am I British

1168
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,120
Because I love her

1169
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,120
Patron voice

1170
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,120
Everyone was quiet

1171
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,120
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall still looked mad but Professor Snape said

1172
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,120
Fine very well

1173
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,120
You may go up to your rooms

1174
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,120
Snape never sleep

1175
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,120
Well Harry Potter

1176
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,120
Picking noise

1177
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,120
Potter puppet pals man

1178
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,120
Bring you back

1179
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Are you okay Abany

1180
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Draco asked me gently

1181
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,120
Yeah I guess

1182
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
I lied

1183
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,120
I went to the girls dorm and brushed my teeth and my hair

1184
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,120
And chained into a low-cut black floor-length dress with a red lace all around and black high heels

1185
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:59,120
Iha when I came out of the closet

1186
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,120
Draco was standing in front of the bathroom and he started to sing

1187
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,120
I just want to live by Good Charlotte

1188
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:07,120
I was so flattered even though he wasn't supposed to be there

1189
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
We hugged and kissed

1190
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,120
After that we said good night and he reluctantly went back to his room

1191
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,120
You know Demwell Snape got the victory secret though

1192
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,120
That's not a song

1193
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,120
I'm so scared of that

1194
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,120
I'm really really

1195
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Sorry Eric we're covering your face

1196
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,120
The next day I woke up in my coffin

1197
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,120
I put on a black many skirt

1198
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,120
Many skirt that was all ripped around the end

1199
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
And a matching top with red skulls all over it

1200
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,120
And high heeled boots

1201
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,120
Sorry I was making that again

1202
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,120
That were black

1203
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,120
I put on two pairs of skull earrings and two crosses in my ears

1204
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,120
I spring painted my hair with purple

1205
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:58,120
In the great hall I ate some Count Chocula cereal

1206
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,120
With blood instead of milk

1207
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,120
And a glass of red blood

1208
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,120
Suddenly someone bumped into me

1209
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,120
All the blood spilled over my top

1210
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Faster

1211
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,120
I shouted angrily

1212
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,120
I regretted saying it

1213
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,120
Cause when I looked up

1214
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,120
I was looking to the pale white face of a gothic boy

1215
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,120
The spiky black hair with red streaks in it

1216
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,120
Who could it be

1217
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,120
He was wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down to his fate

1218
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,120
I was going down his face

1219
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,120
And he was wearing black lipstick

1220
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,120
He didn't have glasses anymore

1221
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,120
And now he was wearing red contact lenses just like Draco's

1222
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
There was no scar on his forehead anymore

1223
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,120
He had manly stubble on his chin

1224
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,120
He had sexy English accent

1225
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,120
He looked exactly like Joel Madden

1226
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,120
He was so sexy that my body went hot

1227
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,120
When I saw him kind of like an erection

1228
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,120
Only a girl so I didn't get when he was sicko

1229
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,120
Alright what's the voice

1230
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,120
What's the voice for vampire aka Harry Potter

1231
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,120
Would you like

1232
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
Like

1233
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,120
Shy British

1234
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,120
Harry Styles

1235
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,120
I'm so sorry

1236
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,120
I'm so sorry

1237
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,120
That's alright

1238
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
Yeah I need to go deeper

1239
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,120
I'm so sorry

1240
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,120
Or you want a cute and funny

1241
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,120
I can't do a Donald Duck one

1242
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,120
Transylvanian

1243
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,120
Classic Dracula

1244
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,120
Maybe I can attempt that

1245
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,120
Or corpse

1246
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,120
Do you want me to fucking kill my throat

1247
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,120
Goofy?

1248
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,120
Okay I don't like Goofy

1249
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,120
He made a mute

1250
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,120
I'm just quiet

1251
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,120
When his lines come up

1252
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,120
I'll be right back while you guys vote

1253
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,120
Goofy

1254
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,120
Goofy

1255
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,120
Gosh

1256
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,120
Alright

1257
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,120
We got Goofy

1258
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,120
I'm so sorry

1259
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,120
He said in a shy voice

1260
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,120
That's alright

1261
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,120
What's your name

1262
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,120
I questioned

1263
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,120
My name's Harry Potter

1264
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,120
Although most people call me vampire these days

1265
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,120
He grumbled

1266
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,120
I'm not able to do that

1267
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,120
Why

1268
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,120
I exclaimed

1269
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,120
Because I love the taste of human blood

1270
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,120
Well

1271
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,120
I am a vampire

1272
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,120
I confess

1273
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,120
Really?

1274
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,120
He whimpered

1275
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,120
Yeah

1276
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,120
I reward

1277
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,120
We sat down to talk for a while

1278
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,120
The dragon came up behind me

1279
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,120
And told me he had a surprise for me

1280
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,120
So I went away with him

1281
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,120
I know I didn't do the

1282
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,120
Because I love the taste of human blood

1283
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,120
And I'll kill him again

1284
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,120
Goofy did you kill these people

1285
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,120
Have you seen that?

1286
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,120
The Goofy

1287
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,120
Is on trial for murder

1288
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,120
You know I fucking do it again

1289
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,120
Oh yeah with Joji

1290
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,120
Oh my god

1291
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,120
That's right

1292
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,120
It's so funny

1293
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,120
So as I've said in the past

1294
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,120
I used to be in the commentary community

1295
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,120
So I was familiar with a lot of like

1296
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,120
Those personalities

1297
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,120
And I remember

1298
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,120
Going to TwitchCon

1299
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:37,120
And I got to meet anything for views

1300
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,120
And all he did was just select

1301
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,120
Sexually harass me the entire time

1302
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,120
And I got to meet anything for views

1303
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,120
And all he did was just select

1304
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,120
Sexually harass me the entire time

1305
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,120
He's like you got a man

1306
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,120
And I'm like no

1307
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,120
He's like

1308
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,120
I'm gonna come back to my hotel room later

1309
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,120
And I'm like bitch what the fuck

1310
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,120
No

1311
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,120
I'm like

1312
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,120
He's like how old are you?

1313
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,120
And I'm like

1314
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,120
I wasn't even like offended

1315
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,120
Because I'm like

1316
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,120
I'm like is he

1317
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,120
I'm just gonna assume

1318
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,120
He's in character

1319
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,120
No

1320
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,120
No he at

1321
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,120
So like I was with a group of friends

1322
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,120
And so he's like

1323
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,120
The first thing he asked

1324
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,120
He's like

1325
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,120
Are you dating any of these people?

1326
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,120
Because some of them are girls

1327
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,120
Some of them are guys

1328
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,120
And I'm like no

1329
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,120
Never meet your heroes

1330
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,120
Oh yeah

1331
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,120
I remember one of my friends

1332
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,120
After I was like

1333
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,120
What the fuck was that

1334
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,120
Hahaha

1335
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,120
And I'm like

1336
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,120
Okay

1337
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,120
Cool

1338
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,120
I can't remember if he followed me back on Twitter

1339
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,120
Or not

1340
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,120
Probably

1341
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,120
Maybe

1342
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,120
Who knows

1343
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,120
Negative riz

1344
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,120

1355
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,120
I almost said um

1356
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,120

What the fuck was his other name

1360
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,120
I forget

1361
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,120
I'm blanking

1362
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,120
Oh no she's a teenager

1363
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,120
I'm so glad I'll never meet how to basic

1364
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,120
Uh

1365
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,120
That sounds a little bit about me

1366
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,120
Alright

1367
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,120
Ever got to get a PewDiePie tattoo

1368
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,120
And then like on his ass

1369
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,120
Yeah and then I just went to like

1370
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
The artist's poll instead

1371
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,120
And just like hung out

1372
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,120
And then I played um

1373
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,120
There's like some places

1374
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,120
Play people like game places there

1375
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,120
That I was like looking for games

1376
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,120
Or

1377
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,120
Was it TwitchCon

1378
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,120
Or was it FanExpo

1379
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,120
I don't even fucking remember

1380
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,120
Was it

1381
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,120
Outbot? No

1382
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,120
What?

1383
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,120
I don't even know what convention it was

1384
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,120
Yeah I broke my back in the

1385
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,120
The Tumblr ball pit

1386
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,120
Dashcon

1387
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,120
That's what that's 100%

1388
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,120
Alright chapter 7

1389
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,120
Draco and I held our pale white hands

1390
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,120
With black nail polish as we went upstairs

1391
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,120
I was wearing red satanist sings

1392
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,120
Not signs, sings

1393
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,120
On my nails in red nail polish

1394
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
I don't know how you can wear red

1395
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
Signs on your nails in red nail polish

1396
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,120
But then it just like not show up

1397
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,120
Emo Shibi? Yeah that's me

1398
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,120
Fuck you

1399
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,120
Emo

1400
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
We dark over here

1401
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,120
I waved to vampire

1402
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,120
Dark misery was in his depressed eyes

1403
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,120
I guess he was jealous of me

1404
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,120
That I was going out with Draco

1405
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,120
Anyway I went upstairs excited with Draco

1406
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,120
We went to his room and locked the door

1407
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,120
Then we started Frenching passively

1408
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,120
And we took off each other's clothes enthusiastically

1409
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,120
He felt me up before I took off my top

1410
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,120
Then I took off my black leather bra

1411
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,120
That doesn't sound comfortable

1412
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,120
And he took off his pants

1413
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,120
We went to the on the bed

1414
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,120
And started making out naked

1415
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,120
And then he put his boys thingy in mind

1416
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,120
And we had sex

1417
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,120
Oh Draco! Draco!

1418
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,120
I screamed

1419
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,120
Well getting an hour

1420
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,120
Ow I just hit my arm

1421
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,120
Just getting an orgasm

1422
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,120
When all of a sudden I saw a tattoo

1423
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,120
I had never seen before in Draco's arm

1424
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,120
It was a black heart with an arrow through it

1425
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,120
On it and bloody gothic writing were the words

1426
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,120
Vampire?

1427
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,120
I was so angry

1428
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,120
You bastard!

1429
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,120
I shouted angrily

1430
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,120
Jumping out of the bed

1431
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,120
No no you don't understand

1432
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,120
Draco pleaded

1433
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
But I knew too much

1434
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,120
No you fucking idiot I shouted

1435
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,120
You probably have AIDS anyway

1436
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,120
I put on my clothes all huffily

1437
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,120
And then stomped out

1438
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,120
Draco ran out even though he was naked

1439
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,120
Had he had a really big you know what

1440
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,120
But I was too mad to care

1441
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,120
I stomped out and did so

1442
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,120
Until I was in Vampire's classroom

1443
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,120
Draco was having a lesion with Professor Snape

1444
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,120
And some other people

1445
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,120
Vampire Potter you motherfucker

1446
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,120
I yelled

1447
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,120
Hold on

1448
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,120
I'll tell you

1449
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,120
When was my immortal

1450
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,120
Written

1451
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,120
It was

1452
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,120
Published in serial installments

1453
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,120
On fanfiction.net

1454
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,120
Between 2006 and 2007

1455
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,120
Holy crap

1456
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,120
You think they'd be careful with anything blood to blood

1457
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,120
Because they're off their second blood

1458
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,120
They're vampires so I don't even

1459
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,120
I don't think they would even apply to them

1460
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,120
Ffff

1461
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,120
I should read a Twilight fanfiction

1462
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,120
The fact that 50 shades was a first at Twilight Fiction

1463
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,120
It always throws me off

1464
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,120
Damnit fucking Eric

1465
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,120

1477
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:24,260
Her real parents are vampires, and one of them is a witch, but Voldemort killed her mother and her father, committed suicide because he was depressed about it.

1478
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,260
She still has nightmares about it, she's very haunted and depressed.

1479
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,260
It also turns out her real last name is Smith, the knockranger.

1480
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:35,260
Since she has converted to Satanism, she is in slithering now, knockriffin door.

1481
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:41,260
What is it that you desire, you ridiculous dimwit?

1482
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:45,260
Snaped demeaned angrily in his cold voice, but I ignored him.

1483
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,260
Vampire, I can't believe you cheated on me with Draco!

1484
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:53,260
I shouted at him. Everyone gasped.

1485
01:21:53,260 --> 01:22:00,260
Wait, but she's not dating vampire, so technically, I can't believe Draco cheated on me with you is what she should have said.

1486
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:07,260
This is the least e-real, you would be surprised, just you wait what Snape gets up to.

1487
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,260
Oh, it's gonna be a lot like class of 09.

1488
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,260
Spoiler alert.

1489
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,260
Um...

1490
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:20,260
I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.

1491
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:21,260
What?

1492
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,260
Wait, so...

1493
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,260
Why did I... am I...

1494
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:36,260
Oh, is this from Draco's perspective?

1495
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,260
No.

1496
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:47,260
Okay, I got sorry, I lost, I kinda lost the plot for a moment. I'm just gonna read it.

1497
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,260
I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.

1498
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:54,260
I had went out with vampire, I'm bi, so as Ebony.

1499
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,260
For a while, but then he broke my heart.

1500
01:22:56,260 --> 01:23:00,260
He dumped me because he liked Brittany, a stupid preppy fucker.

1501
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:05,260
We were just good friends now, he had gone through horrible problems, and now he was gothic.

1502
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,260
Haha, like I would hang out with a prep.

1503
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:12,260
But I'm not going out with Draco anymore.

1504
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,260
Says vampire.

1505
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,260
Yeah, fucking right, fuck off you bastard.

1506
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,260
I screamed.

1507
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:21,260
I ran out of the room and into the forbidden forest where I had lost my rarality.

1508
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:29,260
My rarality, yep, rarality to Draco, and I started to bust into tears.

1509
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:33,260
I'm not under the Draco still not wearing anything.

1510
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,260
Yeah, what is this, the Bible?

1511
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,260
Haha, this is my Bible.

1512
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:46,260
I was so mad and sad, I couldn't believe Draco for cheating on me.

1513
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,260
I began to cry, I cranced the tree when I did it with Draco.

1514
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,260
That's pretty hardcore.

1515
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:55,260
I'm trying to actually know exactly which tree that they did, you know what,

1516
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:59,260
where he stuck his, you know what in her, you know what.

1517
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:07,260
Then all of a sudden, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick.

1518
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:11,260
He didn't have a nose, basically Voldemort in the movie.

1519
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:14,260
He was wearing all black but it was obvious he wasn't gothic.

1520
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,260
It was Voldemort?

1521
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:21,260
No, I shouted in a scared voice but then Voldemort shouted.

1522
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,260
What voice, what voice for Voldemort?

1523
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:31,260
Actually he has, he says vow a lot, so I might just give him a...

1524
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,260
I might just give him a birch accent.

1525
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,260
Imperius?

1526
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,260
And I couldn't run away.

1527
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,260
Croc shanks!

1528
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,260
I shouted at him, Voldemort fell off of his broom and started to scream.

1529
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:47,260
I felt bad for him even though I'm a sadist, so I stopped.

1530
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:52,260
Abony, he yelled, vow must kill vampire potter.

1531
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:59,260
I thought about vampire in his sexy eyes and his gothic black hair and how his face looks just like Joel Madden.

1532
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:03,260
I remember that Draco had said I didn't understand so I thought,

1533
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:07,260
what if Draco went out with vampire before I went out with him and they broke up?

1534
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,260
No, Voldemort!

1535
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:12,260
I shouted back, Voldemort gave me a gun.

1536
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:25,260
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1537
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:33,260
Voldemort gave me a gun.

1538
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,260
Voldemort gave me a gun.

1539
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,260
No, please, I begged.

1540
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:52,260
Thou must heal, if thou dost not, then I shall kill thy beloved Draco.

1541
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,260
How did you know?

1542
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,260
I asked in a surprised way.

1543
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:01,260
Voldemort got a dude yourself.

1544
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,260
Look on his face.

1545
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,260
I have a telekinesis.

1546
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,260
He answered cruelly.

1547
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:14,260
And if you dost not kill vampire, then thou not know what will happen to Draco.

1548
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,260
He shouted.

1549
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:17,260
Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.

1550
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:21,260
I was so scared, mad, I didn't know what to do.

1551
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,260
Suddenly Draco came into the woods.

1552
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,260
Draco, I said, hi!

1553
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:27,260
Hi.

1554
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,260
He said back, but his face was all sad.

1555
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:32,260
He was wearing white foundation and messy eyeliner.

1556
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,260
Kind of like a pentagram, get it?

1557
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:37,260
Between gold, instead of a cross, it's a pentagram.

1558
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,260
So like a sort of a cross between, it's a pentagram.

1559
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,260
It took me forever to figure that out the first time I ever read this.

1560
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,260
Between Joel Madden and Jared Way.

1561
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,260
Are you okay?

1562
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,260
I asked.

1563
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,260
No, he answered.

1564
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:55,260
I'm sorry, I got all mad at you, but I thought you cheated on me.

1565
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,260
I expelled.

1566
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:00,260
I hope it's a teagle.

1567
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,260
That's okay.

1568
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,260
I'm sorry.

1569
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,260
That's okay.

1570
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,260
He said all depressed.

1571
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,260
And we went back to Hogwarts together, making out.

1572
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,260
Alright, this is a toxic relationship.

1573
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,260
Chapter 10.

1574
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,260
It's a lot of making out, yeah.

1575
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:36,260
I was really scared about Vlad and Mort all day.

1576
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,260
I was even upset.

1577
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:42,260
Went to rehearsals with my gothic metal band Bloody Gothic Rose 666.

1578
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:44,260
I'm the lead singer of it and I play a guitar.

1579
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,260
People say that we sound like a cross between GC, Slipknot and MCR.

1580
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:53,260
The other people in the band are Bloody Mary, Vampire, Draco, Ron.

1581
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:56,260
Although we call him Diabolo now.

1582
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:00,260
He is black hair now with blue streaks in it.

1583
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,260
And Hagrid.

1584
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,260
This is a loaded band.

1585
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:09,260
Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed.

1586
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:12,260
So they weren't coming and we wrote songs instead.

1587
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,260
I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists.

1588
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,260
He wouldn't die because he was a vampire too.

1589
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:22,260
And the only way you can kill a vampire is with a C-R-O-S-S.

1590
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,260
There's no way I'm writing that.

1591
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,260
Or a steak like the food.

1592
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,260
Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.

1593
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:39,260
I put on a black leather shirt that showed off my boobs in a tiny matching mini skirt that said simple plan on the butt.

1594
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,260
You might think I'm a slut, but I'm really not.

1595
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:49,260
Hagrid kind of gives grimmer vibes being in this band.

1596
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:52,260
So he's like the chaperone, he's hanging out.

1597
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:59,260
We were singing in cover of Helena and at the end of the song I suddenly bust into tears.

1598
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,260
What voice did I give her?

1599
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,260
What voice did I give Bloody Mary?

1600
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,260
What voice did I give Hermione?

1601
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:12,260
Oh no, I never gave her a voice.

1602
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,260
I also gave her a normal British girl voice.

1603
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,260
Ebony, are you okay?

1604
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,260
Ebony?

1605
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,260
Ebony, are you okay?

1606
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:23,260
Ebony, are you okay?

1607
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:25,260
Bloody Mary asked in a concerted voice.

1608
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,260
What the fuck do you think? I asked angrily.

1609
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:33,260
And then I said, well Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry.

1610
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,260
But I don't want to kill him because he's really nice.

1611
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:40,260
And even if he did go with Draco, but if I don't kill Harry, then Voldemort will fucking kill Draco.

1612
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,260
I burst into tears.

1613
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:44,260
Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind the wall.

1614
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,260
Why didn't you fucking tell me?

1615
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:48,260
He shouted.

1616
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:49,260
How?

1617
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:53,260
How could you fucking poser muggle bitch?

1618
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,260
Jesus fuck.

1619
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,260
He just called me a slur.

1620
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,260
I started to cry and cry.

1621
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:02,260
Draco cried too all sensitive.

1622
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,260
Then he ran out crying.

1623
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:06,260
We practiced for it.

1624
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:09,260
See, like, whoa, chill with the M word.

1625
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:11,260
I know, that was, I'm so sorry I said that.

1626
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:14,260
That was, that was a hard M.

1627
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:17,260
That was a hard, I, I feel really awful to say that.

1628
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,260
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1629
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,260
Especially when you add like bitch after it.

1630
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:25,260
Or like really just does it.

1631
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,260
Oh yeah, I still have the gun in my hand.

1632
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:30,260
Let me just put that away real quick.

1633
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,260
Remember the gun is still on my person.

1634
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,260
Practiced for a more hour.

1635
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,260
Then suddenly Dumbledore walked in angrily.

1636
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,260
His eyes were all fiery and I knew that this time it wasn't because he had a headache.

1637
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:49,260
Cowboy voice, let me think.

1638
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,260
What have you done?

1639
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,260
He started to cry wisely.

1640
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:01,260
See, that's basically not swearing and this time he was really upset and you will see why.

1641
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:02,260
Ebony.

1642
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,260
Draco has been found in his room.

1643
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,260
He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.

1644
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:13,260
You guys think I'm gonna get monetized?

1645
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,260
Wait hold on, let me check my email.

1646
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,260
Clearly I was trying to get monetized.

1647
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,260
Yeah, I'm thinking not.

1648
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,260
What?

1649
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,260
Still says in progress.

1650
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,260
Shout out to the person that got me a fidget toy.

1651
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,260
You are amazing.

1652
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:54,260
Hold on, I just realized.

1653
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,260
Don't have my headphones on to see donuts again.

1654
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,260
Let me see if anybody...

1655
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:11,260
Harim, remember to buy your heat suppressors.

1656
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:14,260
Thank you, Anonymous, for that tip.

1657
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:17,260
Thank you for the tip and the other tip.

1658
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,260
She's autistic?

1659
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,260
Don't worry, don't read ahead.

1660
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,260
Don't read ahead.

1661
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,260
Stop.

1662
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:32,260
It's still in progress.

1663
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:36,260
I wonder if any of the other girls got monetization yet?

1664
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,260
I don't know.

1665
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:11,260
I got out of the bathtub and I put on a black low cut dress with lace all over it sandly.

1666
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:16,260
I put on black heels with pink metal stuff on the ends and six pairs of skull earrings.

1667
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,260
I got more piercings, guys.

1668
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,260
I couldn't fucking believe it.

1669
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,260
Then I looked out the window and screamed.

1670
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:29,260
Snap was spying on me and he was taking a videotape of me and Lupin was masticating to it.

1671
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:31,260
They were sitting on their broomsticks.

1672
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:34,260
Ew, you fucking perv, stop looking at me naked.

1673
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,260
Are you paddles or what?

1674
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:39,260
I screamed putting on a black towel with a picture of Marilyn Manson on it.

1675
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,260
Suddenly a vampire ran in.

1676
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:46,260
Abracadabra!

1677
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,260
He yelled, holy crap.

1678
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:51,260
There was a giant SB that just flew into my window.

1679
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,260
He was just eating, he was eating.

1680
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:00,260
He yelled at Snape and Lupin pointing his womb.

1681
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,260
I took my gun.

1682
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:03,260
Hold on.

1683
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:08,260
I took my gun.

1684
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,260
And I, what did I do?

1685
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:22,260
And I shot Snape and Lupin a gazillion times.

1686
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:28,260
They both started screaming and the camera broke.

1687
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,260
Suddenly Dumbledore ran in.

1688
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,260
Ebony.

1689
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,260
It has been revealed that someone has.

1690
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,260
No!

1691
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:40,260
He shouted looking at Snape and Lupin and then he waved his wand and suddenly

1692
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:44,260
Hargrid ran outside on his broom and said everyone we need to talk.

1693
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,260
What do you know Hargrid?

1694
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,260
You're just a little Hogwarts student.

1695
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,260
I don't know who is speaking.

1696
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,260
What's had a Cagrin's voice?

1697
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,260
I might be a Hogwarts student.

1698
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:59,260
But I'm also a scientist.

1699
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:02,260
This cannot be.

1700
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,260
Snape said in a crisp voice.

1701
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:07,260
As blood dripped from his hand where Dumbledore's wand had shot him.

1702
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,260
There must be other factors.

1703
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,260
There must be other factors.

1704
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,260
You don't have any.

1705
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,260
I yelled in madly.

1706
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,260
Lupin held up the camera.

1707
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,260
Try um-fall-element.

1708
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,260
Try um-fall-element.

1709
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,260
Try um-elephantly.

1710
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,260
The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.

1711
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,260
I'm just going to give him normal voice.

1712
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,260
Oh wait.

1713
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,260
The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.

1714
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,260
A little like a creepy family guy.

1715
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,260
Hagrid is Emmy?

1716
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:41,260
No.

1717
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,260
He's not going to be cute and funny.

1718
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:52,260
I'm maybe a Hogwarts student.

1719
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,260
Hagrid pause angrily.

1720
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:56,260
But I'm also a scientist.

1721
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:57,260
Okay fine.

1722
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,260
Fine fine.

1723
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,260
Hagrid can be cute and funny.

1724
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,260
You want to vote? Okay.

1725
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,260
Hagrid voice.

1726
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,260
Brixton.

1727
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,260
Or cute and funny.

1728
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,260
I've got to be homophobic.

1729
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,260
My bitch is gay.

1730
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:29,260
Scott?

1731
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:30,260
I actually-

1732
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,260
Maybe I'll do Scott to someone else.

1733
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,260
Hagrid is Tony.

1734
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:37,260
I may be a Hogwarts student.

1735
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,260
But I'm also a Satanist.

1736
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:43,260
Because, because.

1737
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,260
I may be a Hogwarts student.

1738
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,260
But I'm also a Satanist.

1739
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,260
I'm not the cute and funny voice.

1740
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:51,260
Okay.

1741
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,260
Cute and funny it is.

1742
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,260
Because like they did it.

1743
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:59,260
They always-

1744
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:02,260
When girls wrote fanfics they'd always

1745
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,260
tell and not show.

1746
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,260
Like because it's like it's like a-

1747
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,260
kind of a key factor of

1748
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:10,260
writing as you can

1749
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,260
kind of show

1750
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,260
what you can do.

1751
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,260
Writing as you can

1752
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,260
kind of show what they're wearing with how

1753
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,260
like the dialogue flows

1754
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:22,260
or like how they interact with their environment.

1755
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,260
But when you're younger you just

1756
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,260
say it, you just tell.

1757
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,260
I was wearing this, this and this instead of like

1758
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,260
I looked over at

1759
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:32,260
um, Draco.

1760
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,260
My

1761
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:38,260
cross necklace making a distinct

1762
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:40,260
jingling sound.

1763
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,260
I can't believe you fucking done this.

1764
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,260
I don't know.

1765
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:49,260
I had pretty good fanfics.

1766
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,260
Too bad they're like, they were all lost

1767
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,260
when they accidentally nuked my computer.

1768
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:56,260
I'm very sad about that.

1769
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,260
I like cried for days.

1770
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:01,260
Because then I would 100% read them for you guys.

1771
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,260
What was that?

1772
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,260
The lens might be ruined

1773
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:16,260
but the tape is still there.

1774
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,260
The lens might be ruined

1775
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:20,260
but the tape is still there.

1776
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,260
The lens might be ruined

1777
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,260
but the tape is still there.

1778
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:26,260
I can do the whistle.

1779
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,260
Why are you doing this?

1780
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:32,260
Lupin said angrily while he rubbed his dirty hands

1781
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:34,260
on his cloak.

1782
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,260
Hope it's his cloak.

1783
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,260
And then I heard the words I had heard before

1784
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:40,260
but not from him.

1785
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,260
I did not know whether it feels

1786
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,260
shocker and happy or to bite him

1787
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:46,260
and drink his blood cause I felt faint.

1788
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,260
Because, because.

1789
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,260
Hargid said and he paused

1790
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,260
in the air dramatically,

1791
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,260
waving his wand in the air.

1792
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:57,260
Then swooped in he and singing

1793
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:59,260
to the tune of a gothic version of a song

1794
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,260
by 50 cent.

1795
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,260
Because you are gothic.

1796
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:05,260
Snap asked a little afraid voice

1797
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,260
because he was a friend.

1798
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,260
It meant he was connected with Satan.

1799
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,260
Because I love her.

1800
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:14,260
Whoa.

1801
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:16,260
Hargid.

1802
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:18,260
You're like

1803
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:20,260
like 60 years old.

1804
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,260
I think he's like actually a student

1805
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:26,260
in this iteration.

1806
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,260
Like he's like actually like he's like also a teenager.

1807
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,260
Yeah, stop say

1808
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,260
okay Hargid is a pedo too.

1809
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,260
A lot of American schools like I wanted to address

1810
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:38,260
that issue.

1811
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:40,260
Oh.

1812
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,260
Nope, he's an adult in this author's note.

1813
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:44,260
Never mind.

1814
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:47,260
I was about to slit my wrist again

1815
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,260
with the silver knife that Drago

1816
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,260
had given me in case if anything happened to him.

1817
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,260
He had told me to use it valiantly against an enemy

1818
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:55,260
but I knew we must both go together.

1819
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,260
No! Sorry, I'm reading ahead.

1820
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:03,260
I thought it was Hargid, but it was Vampire.

1821
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:05,260
He started to scream

1822
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:07,260
Oh my fucking good, no.

1823
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,260
My scar hurts.

1824
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,260
And then his eyes rolled up.

1825
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:14,260
You could only see his red whites.

1826
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:16,260
I stopped.

1827
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,260
How did you know?

1828
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:20,260
I saw it and my scar turned back

1829
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,260
into the lightning ball.

1830
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,260
No, I ran it closer.

1831
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,260
I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.

1832
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,260
I shouted.

1833
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:30,260
I do, but the Ebola

1834
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:32,260
changed it into a pentagram for me

1835
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:35,260
and I always covered up with foundation.

1836
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:37,260
I'm losing the goofy voice.

1837
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:40,260
Anyway, my scar hurt

1838
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,260
and it turned back into the lightning ball.

1839
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:44,260
Save me!

1840
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:47,260
Wake me up, wake me up inside.

1841
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,260
Save me.

1842
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:55,260
Call my name and save me from the dawn.

1843
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,260
So this is Class of O9.

1844
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,260
This is Gothic Class of O9.

1845
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:04,260
Honestly, I would love to ask the author

1846
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,260
of Class of O9 if they got any inspiration

1847
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:08,260
from my immortal.

1848
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:10,260
It's my favorite cover.

1849
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:18,260
I do not know what

1850
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:20,260
Kayoko means.

1851
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:23,260
What does that mean?

1852
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:25,260
Sorry, I still have a gun.

1853
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:27,260
Let me put the gun away.

1854
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:32,260
I don't mean to be threatening you

1855
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:34,260
so diligently with my gun.

1856
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,260
I always covered up with foundation,

1857
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:44,260
he said back.

1858
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,260
Anyway, my scar hurt back.

1859
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,260
Then I had a vision of what was happening to Draco.

1860
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,260
Ellipses, ellipses, ellipses.

1861
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:52,260
Wolfamort has him bondage!

1862
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:58,260
Anyway, I was in the school nurse's office

1863
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:00,260
now recovering from my slit wrist.

1864
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:02,260
Snapp and Lupin and Harrid

1865
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:04,260
were there too.

1866
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,260
They were going to St. Mango's

1867
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:08,260
after they were recovered

1868
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,260
because they were pedophiles.

1869
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,260
You can't have those pervs teaching in a school

1870
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,260
with a lot of hot girls.

1871
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:16,260
Dumbledore had constipated the city-o camera

1872
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,260
and they took of me naked.

1873
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:20,260
I put up my middle finger up at them.

1874
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:22,260
Anyway, Hargard came into my hospital bed.

1875
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:26,260
He came into the bed holding a bouquet of pink roses.

1876
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:32,260
He said it in a very serious voice.

1877
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,260
Giving me the roses.

1878
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:38,260
Fuck off, I told him.

1879
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:40,260
You know I fucking hate the color pink anyways.

1880
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,260
Although she has a lot of pink stuff so...

1881
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:44,260
I don't like the fucked up.

1882
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:46,260
I don't like fucked up preps like you.

1883
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,260
I snapped.

1884
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,260
Hargard had been mean to me before for being gothic.

1885
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,260
Hargard says.

1886
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,260
What? Are they goffs too?

1887
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,260
Do you pose their prep?

1888
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:02,260
I asked because I was angry that you bought me pink roses.

1889
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:04,260
I saved your life.

1890
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,260
He yelled angrily.

1891
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:08,260
No you didn't. I replied.

1892
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:10,260
You saved me from getting a Paris Hilton pee video

1893
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:12,260
made from your shower scene and being viewed

1894
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,260
by Snap and Lupin.

1895
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:16,260
Who masturbated.

1896
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:18,260
Whatever.

1897
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:22,260
Oh, he added. Who masturbated.

1898
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:24,260
To it he added sign Lee.

1899
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:26,260
Whatever. He yelled angrily.

1900
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:28,260
He pointed his wand at the pink roses.

1901
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,260
These aren't roses.

1902
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:32,260
He suddenly looked at them with an evil look in his eye

1903
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:34,260
and muttered.

1904
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,260
Well, if you want honesty, that's all you had to say.

1905
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,260
That's not a spell. It's an MCR song.

1906
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,260
I corrected him wisely.

1907
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,260
I know. I was just warming up my vocal chords.

1908
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,260
And he screamed.

1909
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,260
That's not a spell I can't make!

1910
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,260
I don't know.

1911
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:02,260
What the fuck is she saying?

1912
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:04,260
What the fuck is Hagrid saying?

1913
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,260
And then the roses turned into a huge black flame

1914
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,260
floating in the middle of the air.

1915
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:10,260
And it was black.

1916
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:12,260
Did I mention it was black?

1917
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:14,260
No, I knew he wasn't a prep.

1918
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:16,260
Okay, I believe you know what the fuck is Draco.

1919
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,260
What the hell is Hagrid's mean spin facts?

1920
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:24,260
I don't know about you.

1921
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:26,260
What a voice, my beloved.

1922
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,260
I have found myself okay, you mean old man.

1923
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,260
Anyway, when I got better, I went upstairs

1924
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,260
and put on black leather mini-dress

1925
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,260
that was all ripped on the ends with lace on it.

1926
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:20,260
There was some corset stuff on the front.

1927
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,260
Then I put on black fishnets

1928
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:24,260
and black high heeled boots

1929
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:26,260
with pictures of Billy Joel all strong.

1930
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:28,260
I put my hair all out around me

1931
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,260
so it looked like Samara from the ring.

1932
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:34,260
Like that girl in the club

1933
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,260
in a vampire in the masquerade.

1934
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:40,260
If you don't know who she is, you're a prep, so fuck off!

1935
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:42,260
And I put on a blood red lipstick,

1936
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:44,260
black eyeliner, black lip gloss.

1937
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,260
You look kawaii, girl.

1938
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,260
What?

1939
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,260
Sorry, my head's flying away.

1940
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,260
Sorry, you look kawaii.

1941
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,260
Not kawaii, kawaii.

1942
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:06,260
You look kawaii, girl.

1943
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,260
I can't even do a birth accident for her.

1944
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:12,260
Sorry.

1945
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:14,260
You look kawaii, girl.

1946
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,260
Bloody Mary said sadly.

1947
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:18,260
Fangs.

1948
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:20,260
Get it? You did too.

1949
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:22,260
I said sadly too, but I was still upset.

1950
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,260
I slipped off my wrist feeling totally depressed

1951
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,260
and I sucked out on the blood.

1952
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:28,260
I cried again in my bathroom

1953
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,260
and put on the shades on so snap and loop

1954
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,260
and couldn't spy on me this time.

1955
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:34,260
I went to some classes.

1956
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:36,260
Vampire was in the hair of magical, magic creatures.

1957
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:38,260
He looked all depressed because Draco disappeared.

1958
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,260
He had used to be in love with Draco.

1959
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,260
He was sucking some blood from a hufflepuff.

1960
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:46,260
Hoi.

1961
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:48,260
He said in a depressed way.

1962
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,260
Hoi back.

1963
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:52,260
I said in an equal wakali said way.

1964
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:56,260
We both looked at each other for some time.

1965
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:58,260
Harry had beautiful red gothic eyes

1966
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,260
so much like Draco's

1967
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:02,260
because they were in the same fucking contacts.

1968
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:04,260
Then we jumped at each other

1969
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:06,260
and started screwing each other.

1970
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,260
Stop it now, you horny simpletons!

1971
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:12,260
I shouted at Professor McGoggle

1972
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:14,260
who was watching us and so was everyone else.

1973
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:16,260
Vampire you fucker!

1974
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,260
I said slapping him.

1975
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:20,260
Stop trying to screw me.

1976
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,260
You know I love Draco.

1977
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:24,260
I shouted and ran away angrily.

1978
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:26,260
Just then he started to scream.

1979
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,260
Oh my fucking god no!

1980
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:30,260
My scar hurt!

1981
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:32,260
And then his eyes rolled up.

1982
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:34,260
You could only see his red whites.

1983
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,260
No!

1984
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:38,260
I ran up closer.

1985
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:40,260
I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.

1986
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:42,260
We already went over this before.

1987
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:44,260
Pace.

1988
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:46,260
Okay. Anyways.

1989
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:48,260
We know that, yep.

1990
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,260
The hex is a red white.

1991
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:02,260
I think the whites of the eyes where you can see the veins

1992
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:04,260
I don't get it.

1993
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,260
I try to roll my eyes back as if you guys could see.

1994
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:08,260
I try to roll my eyes across the head.

1995
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:18,260
What scar?

1996
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:20,260
Is making me lose IQ?

1997
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:22,260
As it should.

1998
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:24,260
Red Sleras

1999
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:26,260
I highly doubt that's what she wanted to say.

2000
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:28,260
Sleras, Sleras.

2001
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:32,260
Vampire and I ran up the stairs looking for Dumbledore and we were so scared.

2002
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:34,260
We were so scared.

2003
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,260
Dumbly door! Dumbly door!

2004
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:38,260
Dumbly door!

2005
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:40,260
We both yelled. Dumbledore came there.

2006
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:44,260
What is it that you want now you despicable snobs?

2007
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:46,260
He asked angrily.

2008
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:48,260
Voldemort has Draco!

2009
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:50,260
We shout at the same time.

2010
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:52,260
He laughed in evil voice.

2011
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:00,260
No, don't. We need to save Draco.

2012
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:02,260
We begged.

2013
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:04,260
No, he said meanly.

2014
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:06,260
I don't give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco.

2015
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:10,260
Not after how much he misbehaved in school, especially with you, Ebony.

2016
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,260
He said while he frowned looking at me.

2017
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:16,260
Besides, I ain't never liked him that much anyway.

2018
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,260
Then he walked away.

2019
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,260
Emperor started crying.

2020
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,260
My Draco!

2021
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,260
He moaned.

2022
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:28,260
Author's note, don't you think

2023
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:30,260
fake gay guys are like so hot?

2024
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:34,260
It's okay.

2025
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,260
I tried to tell him, but that didn't stop him.

2026
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:38,260
He started to cry tears of blood. Then he had a brainstorm.

2027
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,260
Like how did I do?

2028
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,260
He exclaimed.

2029
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:44,260
What? I asked him.

2030
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:46,260
You don't see.

2031
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:48,260
He said. He took out his wand and did a spell.

2032
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,260
Then suddenly, we were in Voldemort's lair.

2033
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:52,260
We ran with our wands out as we heard a crooned voice say.

2034
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:54,260
How were.

2035
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,260
How were.

2036
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,260
Hela Godavra

2037
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,260
insha Allah.

2038
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,260
It was Voldemort.

2039
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:16,260
Sorry, Eric. Fuck you.

01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:20,260

2065
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:08,000
She's a vampire. She can't die. She just drinks her own blood. I don't understand it. Though...

2066
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Can vampires bleed? Well, you know, true blood. I can't remember in the twilight. Can they bleed?

2067
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And Obi, I love you, he shouted sadly. I do not care what those fucker-preps and losers think.

2068
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:29,000
You're the most beautiful girl in the world. Before I met you, I wanted to commit suicide all the time.

2069
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Now, I just want to fucking be with you. I fucking love you.

2070
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Then, he started to sing The Chronicles of Life and Death. We concerted our song now because we fell in love with Joel singing it.

2071
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Right in front of the entire class. His singing voice was so amazing and gothic and sexy.

2072
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
The cross between Gerard, Joel. Oh, she's a cross. She didn't say a pentagram.

2073
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Tester, Pierre, and Marilyn Manson.

2074
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I'll just note, don't do your fingers, guys. They're so hot. If you don't know who they are, then get the fuck out of here.

2075
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
This is my last resort. He cut my life into pieces, indeed.

2076
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Oh, my fucking god. I said after he was finished. Some fucking prep stared at us.

2077
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,000
But I just stuck on my middle fingers that I've recovered in a black nail polish and we're in twine with Draco's now at them.

2078
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I love you, I said. And then we started to kiss, just like Hilary Duff. I fucking hate that bitch.

2079
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
And CMM and a Cinderella story. Oh, yeah, I remember that.

2080
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Then we went away holding hands. Lupin shouted at us, but he stopped because everyone was clapping by how sexy we looked together.

2081
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Then I saw a poster saying that MCR would have a concert in Hogsmeade right then.

2082
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Just teleported and now there's a concert.

2083
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
We looked at each other all shocked and then we went together.

2084
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
To be continued.

2085
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:56,000
There's 44 chapters of this. It gets even better.

2086
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Handholding. Disgusting.

2087
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Anyways, as long as the tip of the iceberg, ladies and gentlemen.

2088
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
MCR is a wizard band? Of course they are.

2089
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
What do you guys think? Oh, yeah, sorry, the gun's over.

2090
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
You love me, right? You like me a lot?

2091
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
My god, is it finally over?

2092
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Yes it is.

2093
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Did we already do a part of Sonic High School? I did not read Sonic High School, no?

2094
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Because I couldn't remember the name of it.

2095
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I couldn't remember that someone suggested a Sonic thing. I can't remember what it was called though.

2096
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Excuse me.

2097
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
I could definitely always do that one again.

2098
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Well, not again. I can always read that one.

2099
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
You loved it? You like the dramatic reading?

2100
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Because I'm gothic. Get it?

2101
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Thanks. What the fuck am I sitting on?

2102
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Ow.

2103
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
You know, cats will shed their claws a little bit.

2104
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I just sat on the claw.

2105
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Stabbing my booty.

2106
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Cutest dramatic reading. Thank you.

2107
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Glad you enjoyed.

2108
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Let me know. I'll probably make a poll on Twitter if you guys want me to continue.

2109
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:50,000
When you call him Madam Shibinia Papp.

2110
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Wait, hold on. I need that.

2111
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Screenshot material.

2112
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
For all your meme needs.

2113
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Hold on. Let me put the gun up higher.

2114
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
My hand.

2115
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Did you like emo goth Shibi? Did you like my immortal?

2116
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Because I have a blonde streak and blonde streaks in my hair, you think I'm a fake?

2117
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
You're a fucking poser, bro. Back off.

2118
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Maybe I made a lot more fun.

2119
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I dressed like a relay man.

2120
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I did actually have a hoodie like this except I had cat ears on the top.

2121
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
And the cat ears could stretch over like the hood could go over your face.

2122
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
It was like a cat mask and it came with like a little cat paws.

2123
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
And it was hot pink and black.

2124
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
It was great.

2125
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
You can probably find a picture of it now that I think of it.

2126
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
The Suprem is nice to...

2127
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Well, this is from Booth. I'll probably put credit so that the model in the description.

2128
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I'm debating whether or not to end stream or play Call of the Lamb.

2129
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I might just end stream because I should probably like do my dishes and shit.

2130
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Probably wear Ahigaya clothing if we could.

2131
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Well, I did get a face mask that...

2132
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
You speaking is true.

2133
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I fucking hate that dog, man.

2134
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
So I'm like more loud than I am.

2135
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
He naps more than me.

2136
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
This dog is trying to call for Satan to come get him.

2137
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Yeah, maybe I'll do a girl later if I'm...

2138
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Holy crap.

2139
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Guys, that's not my dog. It's a dog outside of my apartment right now.

2140
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
There's walking by and the dog is screaming.

2141
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I don't even know what the fuck he's barking at.

2142
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
He's just walking with his mom and dad. I think I hear their voices.

2143
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
It has to be a puppy, although I think there's like a Pomeranian.

2144
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And it might be that Pomeranian.

2145
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I don't know.

2146
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:05,000
But the dog is annoying because it'll bark at all hours of the day.

2147
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Spontaneous interview.

2148
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Yeah, it's actually like someone a demon with a reading fanfic.

2149
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Yeah, well, is...

2150
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Is Emmy streaming today?

2151
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Okay, I remember.

2152
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Yeah, I see that it finished our ASMR stream.

2153
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Strawny is currently playing Skyrim.

2154
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
So that means you guys wouldn't have anybody till...

2155
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Till Azura.

2156
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Oh yeah, because she... I remember she was saying she has piano lessons and stuff.

2157
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Oh, and Azura is not on.

2158
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I know, I realized that when I started streaming that I didn't...

2159
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I didn't post it on YouTube.

2160
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Again, I suck at doing YouTube stuff.

2161
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Okay, so do you get...

2162
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I guess I'll keep streaming then because then it's just...

2163
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
It's just mercy.

2164
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
At 11.

2165
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
It'll be a large gap of, you know, cute girls.

2166
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
So I'll be glad to fill that gap.

2167
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Fill that gap.

2168
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I guess I'll play a little bit of Call of the Lamb.

2169
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Fill the what?

2170
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
The what?

2171
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I'm gonna...

2172
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I'm gonna end stream, but then start it again.

2173
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's just I'm gonna start a separate stream.

2174
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Actually, I'm just gonna set up that right now while I'm talking to you guys.

2175
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.

2176
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
None of them, because I would never harm an animal.

2177
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
I'm gonna start a separate stream.

2178
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.

2179
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
None of them, because I would never harm an animal.

2180
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I'm gonna stay in my dull hand form.

2181
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Where?

2182
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Yeah, I'll just call it a lamb.

2183
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Yeah, I'm saving the vlog.

2184
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Don't you worry.

2185
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Don't you worry.

2186
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
You're a pretty little head.

2187
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I'm gonna end stream, then I'm just gonna start again.

2188
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
And just so people can be like,

2189
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
wait, there was van-fiction reading,

2190
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
and then they're like, just so it's not confusing.

2191
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
And Estrani did that for her 2.0

2192
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
and the exposing be a little other thing.

2193
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
And I've done that in the past myself.

2194
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Schedule stream.

2195
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Schedule stream.

2196
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Onput.

2197
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
607.

2198
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Call order name.

2199
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Can I put poop in my thumbnail?

2200
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Guys, stop pooping everywhere for the love of God.

2201
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Is that allowed?

2202
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Not my thumbnail.

2203
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
My cult of the emo.

2204
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
She'll be watching my course.

2205
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I'm gonna stream call the lamb as Shibony.

2206
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
It's fine.

2207
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
It's fine.

2208
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Gorilla cult of the lamb.

2209
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Let's try to beat the third boss.

2210
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Oh my God.

2211
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Sometimes graphics artist gives me the thumbnails,

2212
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
but they're like the wrong size

2213
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
and I don't have to keep compressing them.

2214
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I'm actually gonna edit that real quick.

2215
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
All right, I'll be right back.

2216
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I'll see you guys.

2217
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Probably I'll say 6.15.

2218
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Bye.

2219
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Give me one second.

2220
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Public 6.15.

2221
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Cool.

2222
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Public 6.15.

2223
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
All right, later nerds.

2224
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Somebody fucking hung up.

2225
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Public 6.15.
