02:16.320 --> 02:20.280

02:20.280 --> 02:21.980
hello

02:21.980 --> 02:23.900
it's me

02:23.900 --> 02:26.860
your favorite, madam

02:26.860 --> 02:29.840
it's so nice to see everybody

02:29.840 --> 02:33.040
Wow, so many beautiful faces in this crowd.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.280
My heart is going doki doki.

02:36.280 --> 02:40.080
Oh, so many well wishes.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
What do I do?

02:43.960 --> 02:45.680
We forgot monetization pose.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.680
Let's fucking go.

02:47.840 --> 02:48.680
Oh my god, my back hurts.

02:48.680 --> 02:49.760
Hello, hi.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.120
Hello, yes.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.280
Oh god, that scared me, I just get so red.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.640
Yeah, but I hope you guys are doing well.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.840
I'm doing lovely, minus I randomly got a migraine

03:03.840 --> 03:07.160
and I'm like, what the hell?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.720
I just woke up from a nappy nap.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.160
To hope, and I went away a little bit

03:15.160 --> 03:19.560
because of the nap and I took some acetaminophen.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.280
You know a little bit about acetaminophen.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.880
I really great acetaminophen.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.200
I'm so excited.

03:28.200 --> 03:33.520
Being, getting monetization and being a YouTube partner

03:33.520 --> 03:37.040
has been a goal of mine since I was a teenager

03:37.040 --> 03:39.720
making really stupid videos on the internet

03:39.720 --> 03:42.480
and it feels really good.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.280
I'm just healing my inner child.

03:45.280 --> 03:49.280
I was crying so hard yesterday, tears of joy

03:49.280 --> 03:52.480
and I know like it might not mean a lot to some of you

03:52.520 --> 03:56.280
when you're just like, oh, it's whatever, it's this, it's that.

03:56.280 --> 04:01.160
It's the principle of just like a long-term goal of mine.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.720
It's like a decade in the works, just like,

04:07.720 --> 04:11.600
even if it's a small milestone, but I hit it

04:11.600 --> 04:14.720
and it means so much to me.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.560
Like I turn the background, you might hear them running around

04:18.560 --> 04:20.720
and Fia stole Boomi's toy

04:20.760 --> 04:22.760
and so Boomi's not really happy about that.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.440
But we're gonna have, it's so funny.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.640
Strawni messages me and she's like,

04:31.640 --> 04:34.800
when are we gonna have monetization stream?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.640
Am I, Strawni, I told you, I said it was Sunday

04:37.640 --> 04:41.600
and I don't know if she saw like literally above

04:43.120 --> 04:45.520
like her message was me saying,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.480
I'm having my monetization stream Sunday.

04:48.480 --> 04:51.640
She's like, when are we having your monetization stream

04:51.640 --> 04:53.480
is the next message?

04:53.480 --> 04:58.280
I'm like, I think she just like sent it

04:58.280 --> 05:00.280
and she's just like, did it, did it, did it.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.760
That was funny, but yes, we're gonna have it Sunday.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.840
I'm gonna try to get my,

05:09.840 --> 05:11.600
I'm gonna try to get my toes done tomorrow.

05:11.600 --> 05:16.600
I need them like book an appointment at the place tomorrow.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.920
I should probably do that ASAP.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.160
I probably should have done that before I fell asleep

05:22.120 --> 05:23.840
and then we'll do it Sunday.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.960
We're gonna be doing, I'm gonna have,

05:25.960 --> 05:28.360
I need to set up my camera.

05:28.360 --> 05:33.280
We're gonna be having thigh slash footsie cam.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.640
I don't know how I'm gonna point it like under my desk.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.400
That's gonna be so weird.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.800
I don't know if that'll be allowed.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.480
I'll have to think of like where I can put it.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.080
Put the camera.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.960
Cause I don't think YouTube will take kindly

05:50.960 --> 05:54.560
to me doing like an up skirt sort of thing.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.400
I don't know.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.280
And I have to find, I don't know what to do with my tripod.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.920
And I don't know if my camera will reach.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.480
But yeah, I'll figure, I'll do all that.

06:09.320 --> 06:14.320
Yeah, it'll be at my normal time at 4 p.m. on Sunday.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.520
And then I can't even remember what else was on the schedule.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.280
But yeah, and so we're doing that.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.640
And we're gonna be eating some Japanese snacks.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.480
You know how hard it is for me not to,

06:29.480 --> 06:32.440
I've been holding on to this box of the soccer box

06:32.440 --> 06:34.640
for like since I debuted now.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.360
Cause somebody got it off my throne.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.720
Cause I'm like, oh, I want to do this for like a,

06:41.720 --> 06:44.760
like a membership stream or just like a stream in general.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.800
And then I'm like, ooh, is it actually good for that?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.080
And so we'll be trying some Japanese snacks.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.400
I'm very excited.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.480
I am not as dexterous as my mother.

06:54.480 --> 06:59.160
So as my momay, I still have the Tito's on my desk.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.000
I look like a fucking alcoholic.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.640
If somebody came in to be like, wow,

07:02.640 --> 07:03.480
what the fuck?

07:03.480 --> 07:05.280
I just have a giant bottle of Tito's.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.160
What did you get?

07:08.160 --> 07:09.000
I haven't opened it yet.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.800
I have no idea what's in the box.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.080
What's in the box?

07:13.320 --> 07:15.000
And then the week after,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.640
I want to do a membership stream

07:16.680 --> 07:19.040
or rewatch master of disguise.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.840
I don't know how like watch alongs work.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.840
I've never done a watch along.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.480
I don't even know like how I'll get the,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.640
like where we'll watch it.

07:28.640 --> 07:29.480
I don't know.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.320
I'll figure it out.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.160
I have to ask Strani.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.240
But that'll be on the day

07:34.240 --> 07:36.240
that I can't remember off the top of my head.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.640
I was getting really bombed.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.480
If it's aimed at your feet,

07:38.480 --> 07:39.480
will we get a cat cameo?

07:39.480 --> 07:40.320
Oh, a hundred percent.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.080
You guys will see my messy ass house in my cats.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.120
So it'll be good.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.080
Oh, maybe I can angle it.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.760
So it looks like it's at my cats,

07:49.760 --> 07:51.240
but it's actually at me.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.080
Because it's like,

07:52.080 --> 07:53.840
because Reina usually sleeps by my feet.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.760
And so I can be like,

07:54.760 --> 07:57.240
you guys can't see what I'm doing.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.000
But yeah, it's if it's awesome.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.480
I'm so happy.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.880
I cried so hard yesterday.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.520
It's like 1am and I was already half asleep.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.720
You know, I woke up this morning

08:09.720 --> 08:11.640
and I looked at my counter and I realized

08:11.640 --> 08:12.720
I don't even remember this.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.920
I made tea last night

08:14.960 --> 08:16.920
and I don't even remember making tea.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.640
I mean, it was just like left out.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.960
And I was like, oh,

08:25.120 --> 08:27.800
am I not totally enough to join the turtle club?

08:31.360 --> 08:32.960
But yeah, it's going to be fun.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.920
I am determined to also hopefully hit like 5k this week

08:37.920 --> 08:39.200
or this upcoming week.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.280
And it really sucks.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.880
Because I was looking at my schedule

08:43.880 --> 08:46.400
that my management sent me for my real job

08:46.400 --> 08:49.400
and my hours are like really shitty.

08:50.640 --> 08:51.760
And it would,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.040
I would end up overlapping.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.160
What the fuck is on my arm?

08:55.160 --> 08:56.000
A bug?

08:56.000 --> 08:56.840
Okay, no, it's not.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.680
It's a piece of dust.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.960
I was like, hello, sir.

09:01.760 --> 09:06.200
Because I'll have to overlap with the Zera a lot.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.200
Because I worked till like,

09:09.200 --> 09:10.520
one day I worked till nine

09:10.520 --> 09:13.280
and I'm just like, oh, I don't,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.360
I can't do like an early morning stream.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.200
And I just hope like,

09:19.760 --> 09:22.200
I just, I don't know why they haven't made me part-time yet.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.680
I think my boss called me right before I started stream,

09:24.680 --> 09:28.680
but I didn't answer because I'm like, I'm doing stuff.

09:28.680 --> 09:33.680
So I'll call back my store after I finished stream today.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.120
But I'm hoping that the call was about like,

09:37.120 --> 09:39.040
hey, we're just going to put you on part-time immediately

09:39.040 --> 09:40.760
because I'm like, oh, great.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.840
I'm working 11 to eight and 12 to nine.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.920
That's so great.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.680
Oh my God, every day this week.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.520
Wow.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.520
Thank you.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.560
Thank you so much.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.080
Oh, and you didn't schedule my proper days off

09:53.080 --> 09:54.800
and you took my normal Wednesdays off.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.720
Thank you so much.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.360
Wow.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.200
Thank you.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.040
At least you got my Saturday days off right.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.720
But yeah, I'll be going back to my job

10:05.720 --> 10:08.320
after almost a three month leave

10:08.360 --> 10:11.680
because your girl is depressed-y-s-y

10:11.680 --> 10:13.800
and I also had a lot of health problems going on

10:13.800 --> 10:16.440
and it was really affecting my work.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.600
I was at risk of losing my job

10:17.600 --> 10:21.400
because I was in so much pain that I couldn't go to work

10:24.040 --> 10:25.720
because I love a fibroflare up

10:25.720 --> 10:27.320
because I was so stressed out.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.440
And they were just like talking to me

10:28.440 --> 10:30.120
and be like, you need to work on your numbers,

10:30.120 --> 10:31.160
your sales numbers.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.480
And I'm like, I don't, I really don't give a shit.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.920
Like I'm just trying to live right now.

10:36.960 --> 10:41.240
And that's when Fiya was like not able to walk.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.320
Her legs didn't work

10:42.320 --> 10:44.840
and I had to take care of her and do all her meds

10:44.840 --> 10:48.000
and also take care of myself at the same time

10:48.000 --> 10:50.320
and then take care of Boomi and Reina

10:50.320 --> 10:52.240
and still give them and love and attention

10:52.240 --> 10:54.000
and then still also maintain relationships

10:54.000 --> 10:57.320
outside of my job, like with my family and my friends.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.040
And it was just, it was too, too, too much.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.280
I couldn't handle it.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.320
But I'm going back.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.160
I feel better.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.320
I'm in a better place.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.520
Although if they don't switch my schedule over soon,

11:07.520 --> 11:09.440
I'm probably just like, I might just quit

11:09.440 --> 11:13.240
because I wanted to stay for reasons

11:13.240 --> 11:15.120
but I don't think I'll be able to.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.720
But we'll see.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.160
Yeah, I'm very thankful

11:18.160 --> 11:20.440
that I was able to get a temporary leave.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.440
Yeah, Fiya is doing much better.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.960
She is running all over my house.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.520
She can jump.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.840
She frolics about, she, what is she doing?

11:29.840 --> 11:31.960
Boomi's just watching her like slam a toy

11:32.000 --> 11:34.720
into my trash can and it's kind of funny

11:34.720 --> 11:37.040
because she, I gave them both their favorite toy

11:37.040 --> 11:38.920
with just a little spring toy

11:38.920 --> 11:42.600
and she immediately fucking knocked it under my fridge.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.000
And then Boomi got all sad

11:45.000 --> 11:46.320
because then Fiya threw it

11:46.320 --> 11:47.640
because Boomi likes to play fetch.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.880
So I threw his and then Fiya got it.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.920
And then Boomi looked at me like,

11:51.920 --> 11:55.480
mama, what, why did you throw it to her?

11:55.480 --> 11:56.800
I'm like, I didn't do it.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.840
You were just too slow

11:57.840 --> 11:59.800
and she got to it before you did.

12:00.800 --> 12:05.880
But yes, we're making moves.

12:05.880 --> 12:06.960
We're making strides.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.120
It was so funny.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.560
Do they keep you awake at night?

12:10.560 --> 12:12.080
No, they wake me up early in the morning.

12:12.080 --> 12:12.920
That's what they do.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.320
They actually sleep with me really well at night.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.560
Boomi becomes a sudden love bug at night.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.880
They always sleep by my feet, on my feet.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.440
Reina sleeps by my head.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.160
That's Boomi right now, if you heard him, yeah.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.920
What's the matter?

12:32.120 --> 12:34.320
Where'd your toy go, sweetheart?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.040
Did Fiya take it?

12:38.160 --> 12:40.120
Did she knock it under the fridge?

12:40.120 --> 12:40.960
Probably.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.560
He looks so upset.

12:46.160 --> 12:50.320
Yes, they're very dog-like.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.920
But yeah, so I was gonna say

12:57.920 --> 12:59.320
it was a really funny coincidence.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.440
I'll read you off something.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.000
I'm just gonna be ventriloquist for a second.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.560
But I randomly got this notification from this thing

13:06.560 --> 13:10.720
I used to be subscribed to about like,

13:10.720 --> 13:11.880
it wasn't like horoscopes,

13:11.880 --> 13:14.000
but just like things to like meditate on.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.520
What the fuck has happened?

13:20.480 --> 13:21.840
Hold on, I need to check on my cat.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.960
Reina, are you okay?

13:22.960 --> 13:24.280
Did you just fall?

13:26.760 --> 13:27.600
Fall.

13:27.920 --> 13:28.760
Fall.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.680
I'm trying to find Reina and I'm walking around

13:43.680 --> 13:46.640
and she jumped into my fucking laundry.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.520
I don't know, my dirty clothes hamper.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.560
And so I just look at her in the bathroom

13:52.560 --> 13:55.080
and she's just staring up at me with her dark face

13:55.080 --> 13:56.880
and big eyes like, hello.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.040
I'm sitting and wallowing in your stink.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.280
But the message I got says,

14:05.280 --> 14:07.960
abundance and confidence and badly this is the finest times

14:07.960 --> 14:09.400
where diligence can pay off.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.920
Even if success isn't immediate, it will come.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.800
You'll feel on track with some sort of measurable return

14:15.800 --> 14:17.360
such as respect, greater self-worth,

14:17.360 --> 14:19.560
financial gain, improved stability or security.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.000
And I'm like, wow, that's so crazy

14:21.000 --> 14:23.560
because literally all my dreams just came true yesterday.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.680
Wow, when my dreams came true when I joined Vealer,

14:25.720 --> 14:27.280
but you guys know what I mean.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.840
It all goes on at 5 a.m.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.520
It's supposed to be the end of the day.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.080
You guys are quiet today.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.240
What's going on?

14:41.400 --> 14:42.480
What's up with that?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.360
Everybody's so quiet.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.520
There's like, Mathem, we're just here to hear.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.520
We're just here to hear you, yeah.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.360
I'm in a game.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.200
I'm working.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.040
Okay.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.360
Scream, scream.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.320
Okay, actually you just reminded me

14:59.320 --> 15:00.960
because you just said you achieved your life.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.240
I need a tweet that I am live.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.440
Oh, I'm right now, oh my God.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.240
She just jumped up on my nose.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.160
Well, I hope you guys are having

15:11.160 --> 15:12.840
a good productive day today.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.360
Sorry, I'm just gonna tweet out on why.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.320
For all my little habits.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.000
Why?

15:33.160 --> 15:38.160
But yeah, you can, you'll expect more later streams next week.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.440
All I can say.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.680
All right, I'm gonna go ventriloquist for a second

15:48.680 --> 15:50.200
while I retweet at my all the count.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.400
Did I even retweet it?

15:53.360 --> 15:54.680
All right then.

15:55.680 --> 16:00.800
I need to pull out a tharboop today, what the hell?

16:00.800 --> 16:01.640
Hi.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.080
Hello, hello.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.080
I'm not being productive.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.080
It's not a sheebie, sheebie, no, yeah, I'm being.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.920
All right, I didn't get much done as of today.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.240
I had a weekend off, so I'm good now.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.320
Oh, it's good for you.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.000
Very good for you.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.200
No problem, arrange your schedule,

16:18.200 --> 16:19.800
hope it freezes you, actually.

16:19.800 --> 16:20.640
Yeah.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.040
I would, I'll actually, I do,

16:23.080 --> 16:24.800
I've always liked streaming in the middle of the day,

16:24.800 --> 16:28.720
like people who have watched me before,

16:28.720 --> 16:32.440
I usually actually streamed at like 12

16:32.440 --> 16:36.120
or even 10 a.m. Eastern sometimes, a.m.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.520
Cause then I just like stream all day and it's great.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.440
Okay.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.560
I'm gonna, I'm practicing today.

16:50.560 --> 16:55.040
I am not gonna yapp as much.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.400
Yeah, we're gonna get into the game now.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.360
Yes, I'm very EU friendly when it comes to streaming.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.040
If my game will load, it will.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.120
I'm trying something new

17:11.000 --> 17:13.600
because you're more energetic as there are times.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.560
Yeah.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.720
Maybe.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.600
I don't know, actually.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.760
I think because like they're,

17:24.760 --> 17:26.960
cause I used on Twitch and like everybody

17:26.960 --> 17:31.960
and their fucking mom would stream at,

17:34.400 --> 17:37.000
come on, come on, they're probably gonna wake up.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.640
Sometimes it doesn't show up until, well,

17:43.760 --> 17:44.600
there we go.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.280
Everybody was streaming and it would be like,

17:50.240 --> 17:54.560
it would just be like 20 people,

17:54.560 --> 17:56.240
people that I also like to watch myself

17:56.240 --> 17:58.960
just streaming all at the same time.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.040
And I just, I,

18:01.040 --> 18:03.920
I just knew I couldn't compete with the time slot

18:03.920 --> 18:05.120
being such a small creator.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.640
So I just like to stream in the middle of the day

18:06.640 --> 18:08.880
and it was fun and then I had a lot of EU friends.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.080
What have I done with the real sheebie?

18:13.080 --> 18:14.240
Game's on.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.960
All right.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.400
Whoopsie daisies.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.920
Not even 40 minutes of yet.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.920
Yes, I'm sorry to let you down.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.920
I'll be honest because of my migraine.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.000
I don't have a lot to talk about today.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.640
And I was looking back at my body yesterday

18:38.640 --> 18:40.600
and I realized I only played two hours

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
to call the lamb.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.200
And then I just talked for four hours after that.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.360
Oh, where'd my coffee go?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.560
Let me grow my coffee.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.880
If you guys are quiet, I'm quiet.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.440
We're having a chill, the rainy day outside.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.200
I might feel a little bit of thunder.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.000
I'm in a good mood.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.760
He he he.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.920
Put my headphones on.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.280
We're compensated with pull on all third-gamer movements.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.080
Damn, the game is loud.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.320
Okay, where was I? I was in the haunted house.

19:42.520 --> 19:48.360
I think I might get new headphones because I wish there was a sort of transparency mode on these.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.280
I feel like my ears are blocked when I play.

19:51.920 --> 19:52.920
I don't like it.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.240
I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.240
I don't like it.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.240
I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.240
I don't like it.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.800
Vampire madam is hot, by the way.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.800
Oh, yes, you like vampire madam.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.800
I wish to fuck your blood.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.600
I said fuck.

20:17.160 --> 20:17.760
Fuck.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.040
Fuck.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.360
Fuck.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.480
V-sucky.

20:23.320 --> 20:23.840
Whoa!

20:24.720 --> 20:25.760
Focus on noise.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.400
Alright, I remember what I was doing.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.600
Okay, I'm here now.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.520
Why am I so high up?

20:39.040 --> 20:40.600
Can I like be a little bit lower?

20:43.720 --> 20:44.920
Okay, none of these doors.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.240
Okay, well, it seems like I go through here.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.840
Nice.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.600
Shower, no mirrors, because I'm a vampire.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.160
I swear I'm already getting motion sick.

21:00.360 --> 21:00.880
Digit.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.880
I walked over to this and just shut off. Okay.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.000
Uh, um...

21:11.560 --> 21:13.840
Can you please give me time to react to things?

21:14.240 --> 21:15.640
Oh my god, look at all the cobwebs.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.400
Oh, she was waiting for me.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.440
Ah, ow!

21:21.560 --> 21:22.720
Fucking, no!

21:23.040 --> 21:23.560
Damn it.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.560
I can't dodge stuff.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.800
Okay, I'm just gonna follow the lady.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.000
Lady, come back!

21:31.480 --> 21:32.000
Oh.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.000
Okay, do I go in here?

21:38.240 --> 21:40.480
Nope, nope, nothing in there either.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.240
How do I reset the camera?

21:46.760 --> 21:49.760
Because I feel like I'm like flying above her.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.400
Camera, what?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.840
Fit fine, okay, whatever.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.760
I meant, mouse, oh my, oh, maybe.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.880
Do it a little bit less.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.160
What does mouse filter mean?

22:32.680 --> 22:34.840
Lady, come back, you can blame it all on Sheepie.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.520
Oh my god, this is a wraith whipping things that are in her rage.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.680
No!

22:42.120 --> 22:43.800
Well, if I can't go that way.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.680
Um, I presume I...

22:56.480 --> 22:57.000
Yo!

22:57.320 --> 22:58.840
Oh, damn, I am...

23:00.120 --> 23:01.360
I almost said I'm...

23:02.600 --> 23:03.560
I'm acoustic.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.480
That doesn't make any sense.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.280
Oh, is it on fire?

23:11.480 --> 23:12.480
That makes sense.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.760
It's very sparkly, it's kind of pretty.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.160
I like the purple flames.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.280
Purple flames, purple flames.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.680
Is there something that I should be doing here?

23:22.640 --> 23:23.240
It's in here.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.920
Not this fucking music.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.640
Oh no!

23:31.600 --> 23:33.760
Oh god, I can definitely jump over this.

23:36.360 --> 23:36.880
Oh!

23:48.760 --> 23:49.800
What the fuck?

23:54.120 --> 23:56.200
Are you serious?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.800
I didn't think you would kill me!

24:01.600 --> 24:05.200
It didn't even give me, like, any warning.

24:11.360 --> 24:14.920
Oh my god, I'm already like a third of my health is gone.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.720
Um, which way was it?

24:22.240 --> 24:22.920
This way?

24:22.920 --> 24:23.720
No, this way.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.200
No, this way.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.680
Okay, it doesn't matter.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.880
We're back where we were.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.720
This game is very forgiving for...

24:38.440 --> 24:41.440
Okay, don't touch the fucking purple fire.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.000
Shibi, how about that?

24:44.280 --> 24:44.920
All right.

24:49.200 --> 24:49.960
Is that going to hurt me?

24:50.080 --> 24:50.560
Ow.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.040
Jesus.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.400
This house is trying to kill me.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.520
Okay, don't walk into that.

24:56.400 --> 24:56.960
Ah!

24:58.320 --> 24:58.640
Should I?

24:58.640 --> 24:59.440
I'm going to save.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.320
Because I feel like I'm going to die.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.160
Can I?

25:08.160 --> 25:09.320
Can I help myself?

25:09.320 --> 25:09.800
Can I?

25:15.440 --> 25:16.400
What the hell?

25:17.520 --> 25:18.840
That bed is floating.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
Excuse me?

25:27.080 --> 25:28.520
Why is it in French?

25:29.000 --> 25:29.480
Ooh.

25:31.280 --> 25:31.960
It's the pen that...

25:31.960 --> 25:32.280
Oh.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.320
That bed is floating.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.360
Can I?

25:38.640 --> 25:39.560
How do I get down?

25:41.840 --> 25:44.280
Ooh, is a pretty boat in the distance.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.320
Do I just jump down?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.520
Am I going to kill myself?

25:49.120 --> 25:51.840
All right, time to go see Therese.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.200
Can this door open any fucking slower?

25:58.760 --> 25:59.720
Lovely.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.400
Whoa!

26:03.400 --> 26:04.840
Oh, I'm fine.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.400
It's okay.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.440
I survived that.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.200
Where the f...

26:11.640 --> 26:13.440
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

26:22.320 --> 26:23.520
Can I jump?

26:25.760 --> 26:27.160
Okay, there's fire there.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.080
So that's not it.

26:28.080 --> 26:28.880
Oh, here we go.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.320
There we go.

26:30.320 --> 26:30.720

26:31.840 --> 26:33.960

26:34.840 --> 26:39.440
Um, I think I can like kill the guy ghost.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.120
Whoa, I just thought it was weird.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.520
I feel like I'm missing something in here.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.000
All right.

26:50.000 --> 26:50.480
Um.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.000
Later.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.040
Wait, I feel like there's a way to like...

26:58.080 --> 26:58.520
Isn't...

26:58.520 --> 27:03.360
I feel like there's something I have to do to like release the spirits

27:04.680 --> 27:08.240
from the bad stuff or maybe it's just giving the pendant.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.520
This is the hotel branch location.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.280
In the basement, you said?

27:25.840 --> 27:26.440
Hmm.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.000
Hold on.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.360
Journal.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.680
What do I do with the fucking thing?

27:52.840 --> 27:54.240
How do I release her?

27:55.040 --> 27:56.240
How do I release?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.120
I'm looking this up.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.440
I don't want no ghost to be left behind.

28:06.440 --> 28:13.440
How to release ghost vampire the Magrae Bubwim.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.440
Hmm.

28:41.040 --> 28:41.640
Oh, okay.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.240
That's right.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.640
I I've played the game before.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.640
I just couldn't remember how to do it.

29:04.040 --> 29:04.440
All right.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.440
Let's let's bounce as well as popsicle stand.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.840
No ghost left behind exactly.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.840
Wait, isn't this thing supposed to attack me?

29:26.840 --> 29:27.840
I didn't do it.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.440
Ooh.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.840
Oh, wait, I think when you go in here, that's when it attacks you.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.440
What's in here?

29:41.840 --> 29:42.840
Nothing I can use.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
It's a giant ass protractor.

29:48.840 --> 29:49.440
Oh.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.840
It didn't attack me.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.040
Soundtrack is bomb.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.840
Please let me get out of this hole.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.840
Or last time I played this, I got stuck in the hole and I had to restart.

30:06.840 --> 30:07.640
Kitchen has a journal.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.840
No, yeah, I already grabbed the journal.

30:08.840 --> 30:31.840
All right, time to go back and talk to my beloved Therese and my beloved Jeanette a.k.a. Azula.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
I don't know how to get back up.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
So I think it's going to go anywhere.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.840
Secret bobcat boss fight.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.840
I love how I creep.

30:46.840 --> 30:47.840
I'm sorry.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.840
All right, let me.

30:51.840 --> 30:52.840
What the hell?

30:52.840 --> 30:53.840
Oh, what the?

30:53.840 --> 30:54.840
What am I doing?

30:54.840 --> 30:55.840
I was like, where am I?

30:56.840 --> 31:00.840
I got disoriented from the Fire Nation.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.840
Yes, it's the same voice actress.

31:07.840 --> 31:08.840
Oh, hold on.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.840

31:29.840 --> 31:33.840

31:37.840 --> 31:39.840

31:59.840 --> 32:04.840

32:04.840 --> 32:06.840
Wait, did you have a tattoo on his back?

32:06.840 --> 32:08.840
I've never even noticed that before.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.840
Boomi, what are you doing?

32:10.840 --> 32:12.840
Boomi, no.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.840
Oh my God, dude, what the heck?

32:16.840 --> 32:18.840

32:18.840 --> 32:19.840
It's just a bug.

32:21.840 --> 32:22.840
Don't even see it.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.840

32:25.840 --> 32:27.840
Female, I'll scream.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
Okay, can I leave?

32:35.840 --> 32:36.840
Okay, later.

I understand, but I still can't give it to you, baby girl.

the little outfit

57:15.080 --> 57:17.080
Jeanette

57:20.200 --> 57:22.920
Hold on let me just look at how I should respond

57:31.640 --> 57:33.640
Fuck

57:39.160 --> 57:41.160
Fuck

57:41.280 --> 57:43.280
And I swear

After all

57:52.160 --> 57:55.160
Yeah, I have the item from Ocean House in a diary from there, too

57:55.560 --> 57:57.560
Excellent, I'll take that

57:58.280 --> 58:00.280
However, there's only one problem

58:01.080 --> 58:05.080
It tongue gets word that I threatened Jeanette, which he most certainly already has

58:05.640 --> 58:07.640
It's not likely he'll believe me

58:07.880 --> 58:13.880
So in order to call off the feud you're going to have to convince Jeanette to forgive you just want to kiss her dead mouth

58:14.680 --> 58:16.680
How do I do that?

58:17.160 --> 58:22.760
We need some threats against my sister idle threats involving fire and her impious satin sheets

58:23.320 --> 58:27.000

58:46.680 --> 58:48.680

Feeling warm and hot and I know that's what my mic my migraine is really bad and I'm motion sick and I'm like sweating

59:17.800 --> 59:19.800

59:28.680 --> 59:30.680
