I'm the only heroes for this fucking shadow role player

14:35.600 --> 14:41.200
Yeah, okay. The already guilty thing I have to admit is that I like shadow, but I didn't

14:41.520 --> 14:43.520
I didn't do this. I promise

14:44.480 --> 14:46.480
Does straw knee set you up

14:51.440 --> 14:55.040
Amy are you joking? I was literally at the gas canister

14:55.440 --> 15:03.040
Watching you as you go to pull the lever and then fucking snipe rain in half her fucking torso is like left behind

15:03.120 --> 15:05.120
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry

15:08.960 --> 15:10.960
I don't know who to vote for

15:11.760 --> 15:13.760
Open up my stream right now. I'm not being

15:16.720 --> 15:18.720
Shadowed the hedgehog streamer

15:21.920 --> 15:24.480
I'm not being gaslit by a freaking sonic the hedgehog

15:28.800 --> 15:32.880
Johnny immediately just be like fuck you now. That's not true

15:34.480 --> 15:38.480
I'm sorry, but you seem you seem suspicious

15:41.520 --> 15:43.520
I would never

15:43.840 --> 15:47.760
If if if it's not I me I'm voting for straw knee next round

15:49.040 --> 15:52.800
Why am I getting in trouble? Obviously, it's gonna be because you're so passionate

15:54.080 --> 15:59.840
You're actually welcome for doing half of the work now. You you all go find the other imposter while you're at it. I'll do it

15:59.920 --> 16:01.920
I'll try my best

16:11.120 --> 16:14.560
I'm gonna die, I think

16:24.080 --> 16:26.080
Straw knee straw knee

16:26.640 --> 16:28.400

16:28.400 --> 16:30.080
Mother

Wait, wait, mercy mercy said she saw it. Mercy reported

16:35.600 --> 16:40.480

16:45.680 --> 16:49.360
I'm gonna I'm gonna go do my shit if somebody kills me it was straw knee

16:53.520 --> 16:55.520
I'm just gonna

16:56.480 --> 16:58.480
Oh

17:06.720 --> 17:13.520
When straw knee talks like that, I know it's fucking her. That's her tail. That's her tail when she's so

17:15.040 --> 17:17.840
Defensive so fast that is straw knees tell

17:25.520 --> 17:27.520
Yes

17:31.040 --> 17:34.160
I can't believe that this happened. I am so hurt

17:46.160 --> 17:48.480
What kind of defenses I didn't do it

17:56.080 --> 18:01.120
And it like oh we got to play prop hunt on gmod at some point

18:16.080 --> 18:17.920
I mean we can't let sonic the head

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It was begin right

18:45.440 --> 18:47.840
I'll I'll be a good little girl. I'll do my tests

18:53.200 --> 18:55.200
I keep having to do the same shit

18:56.240 --> 18:58.400
Why it's like the easiest person

19:00.480 --> 19:02.880
I don't I don't like this guys. I don't like this

19:04.400 --> 19:06.880
No, I don't like this bros

19:09.200 --> 19:15.680
Someone's gonna kill me and stab me in the back and I'm just gonna just take it from behind and

19:17.520 --> 19:19.520
Oh fuck

19:26.480 --> 19:30.240
Cool, okay, we're fine. We're good. We're chilling. Um

19:33.040 --> 19:39.920
I'll be fine. Hopefully I'm I'm pretty nervous. I'm not good at a mogul. How do I port?

19:43.440 --> 19:45.440
What the hell

19:47.760 --> 19:50.240
I was doing I was doing

19:50.800 --> 19:52.800
A conversation

19:53.760 --> 19:55.760
I was do let me talk

19:57.040 --> 20:02.480
I found the body let the rabbit speak. Um, so I was doing electrical. It's coming from electrical and I walked up

20:03.680 --> 20:08.000
Down, uh, actually, I don't know where the hell the map works. Hold on. Let me let me look at the map

20:08.720 --> 20:12.880
I walked up near and in between reactor and security

20:14.800 --> 20:17.680
So, okay, and then I found Imi's body

20:18.000 --> 20:22.880
I am I am going to vouch for rea and pink because she was near me all the way

20:22.880 --> 20:26.720
She did I saw her go in the opposite direction. So I think I think rea is fine

20:27.840 --> 20:29.840
Yeah, yeah, he coughed on me

20:30.640 --> 20:36.880
Stroni rea and mercer vouching for one another. She is claiming she saw it. So azura mimosa and rea

20:37.120 --> 20:39.120
Yeah, what do you what do you guys have to say for yourselves?

20:39.440 --> 20:41.440
I have to say something

20:42.480 --> 20:44.480
It was it was not me

20:48.640 --> 20:50.640
How do we know it wasn't you

20:51.200 --> 20:55.360
Because as straw me I was with straw me and then I went to security and I saw what happened

20:56.480 --> 20:59.360
I didn't see who killed well. It was in between security

21:00.640 --> 21:02.640
It was in between security and reactor

21:03.200 --> 21:06.720
Now I did see rain. I did see rain and admin

21:07.040 --> 21:11.760
So azura and mimosa are now the most likely suspects unless she be you're playing mind game

21:11.760 --> 21:17.520
So I'm not I'm not she be are all sus now. Uh, unless ventilation was taken in electrical

21:17.760 --> 21:19.760
I don't believe a word you say azura

21:22.720 --> 21:24.720
I'm innocent because I was I was

21:26.240 --> 21:31.280
I was literally sitting in the at the table. I was sitting at the table because I'm having audio issue

21:34.560 --> 21:36.560
Okay

21:36.560 --> 21:39.920
I don't know who to vote for then I'm gonna vote for mimosa just because I love

21:43.920 --> 21:46.400
Wait, who is the person that said they walk to security?

21:48.320 --> 21:51.120
Who is me I don't know who to vote for

21:52.640 --> 21:56.560
Azura and mimosa have abstained for voting. How fucking curious

21:59.360 --> 22:01.360
I don't recognize people's voices yet

22:07.520 --> 22:09.520
So

22:11.040 --> 22:14.480
Azura is the most fucking likely I'm keeping an eye on Azura

22:16.960 --> 22:18.960
Staring at you

22:20.800 --> 22:22.800
We're getting oh

22:25.520 --> 22:27.520
Hold on a second

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It's not me. I promise

22:30.560 --> 22:32.560
Rain don't stab me in the back

22:32.960 --> 22:36.160
It's not me. I promise. She casually walks by

22:37.280 --> 22:39.280
Oh

22:42.720 --> 22:44.720
Why do I feel like it was mercy

22:46.320 --> 22:48.640
She well no mercy mercy just walk past me

22:50.720 --> 22:56.880
Hey, what's up, uh rain walked by me and she said I'm not it. Don't worry. It's not me and we were alone

22:56.960 --> 22:58.960
So she's I think she's good

23:07.040 --> 23:11.440
Yes, it's what what other oh wait, they can't hear me. I walked away. I'm just gonna continue. Oh

23:12.320 --> 23:14.320
Uh

23:14.880 --> 23:17.280
I don't know which way to go. How do I play this game?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
Please don't kill me strani

23:30.320 --> 23:32.320
Wait a moment

23:36.800 --> 23:41.520
I's mercy walked by me and disappeared into the nether. I do believe it might be her

23:49.920 --> 23:54.000
I was alone with rain and reya and strani

23:58.560 --> 24:01.200
I think mercy it's mercy

24:06.560 --> 24:09.040
It's not I can't believe you would do such a thing to me

24:10.880 --> 24:12.880
Is there I'm sorry

24:15.440 --> 24:18.800
It would make sense why mercy would vote

24:30.480 --> 24:32.480
I actually like

24:37.520 --> 24:42.000
I probably could have killed I was actually aiming for rain, but I don't know how to

24:42.880 --> 24:48.400
It's mercy walked right past me and I'm surprised you didn't kill me then because I was just like talking to myself like a weirdo

24:59.360 --> 25:01.360
Not accepted

25:01.840 --> 25:03.840
I'm red not blue goddamn

25:04.320 --> 25:06.320
Jesus okay

25:07.520 --> 25:14.880
I'm lying. I forgive you. I I can never be none. All right. They're all lying. Do my tasks and shake my ass. Let's do it

25:23.760 --> 25:26.160
Please don't kill me. I'm I'm working hard

25:30.080 --> 25:32.400
Oh, thank you reya that was nice. I appreciate that

25:32.400 --> 25:39.120
She just jiggled her booty and walked away. Oh, okay. Um

25:41.840 --> 25:43.840
Somebody shut the door

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
I don't think it was reya

25:48.800 --> 25:50.800
Oh memosa

25:51.440 --> 25:56.480
Okay, are you gonna kill me? No, no like this

26:03.360 --> 26:05.360
Wait

26:05.680 --> 26:11.120
Is in freaking electrical and who does stumble upon puri reya's dead body?

26:12.800 --> 26:14.400
No

26:14.400 --> 26:16.080
She's a victim

26:16.080 --> 26:20.640
Eventually open the door because the door just got closed in my face me and um

26:20.880 --> 26:25.760
The door is also closed on me the opens and then I mean ivy comes out and then

26:26.000 --> 26:30.400
I go in at the back at the vent section and reya's sitting dead with her weak corpse

26:31.360 --> 26:33.360
I mean

26:35.520 --> 26:37.520
Did you tell me to kill myself? No

26:42.960 --> 26:44.960
She just wanted to shake her ass

26:45.520 --> 26:47.520
I was doing electricals

26:55.680 --> 27:00.400
Strani strani when you get like this strani when you get like this

27:01.280 --> 27:03.280
I don't trust you

27:15.920 --> 27:18.880
She's like breaking my microphone

27:19.920 --> 27:21.920
I need to start strani down

27:23.360 --> 27:28.320
She literally goes. I was an electrical. I tell you I find the dead body of reya an electrical

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
I'm abstaining. I'm abstaining

27:41.600 --> 27:43.600
If it's i me then it might

27:45.920 --> 27:51.520
Well, if it's i me it also might be mimosa because mimosa was cornering me and I saw them walking together

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
Probably by the table again

28:11.600 --> 28:13.600
Excuse me

28:15.920 --> 28:24.720
Oh my god is i me

28:29.520 --> 28:36.560
It's strani it's strani it's strani hit the button hit the button it's strani

28:45.920 --> 28:47.920
It's

28:50.880 --> 28:52.880
Strani

28:56.960 --> 28:58.960
I'm even kidding to play the game

28:59.120 --> 29:05.600
No, when it goes oh when strani's and I know we impostor

29:10.560 --> 29:15.360
Wait, no mercy mercy always votes for the person that accuses her when she's impostor

29:16.880 --> 29:23.760
It's mercy. It's mercy. It's mercy. If you want to lose this crew me have fun, but I'm here at win and you guys are being

29:24.400 --> 29:26.400
It's

29:33.200 --> 29:35.200
I would love to

29:42.000 --> 29:48.080
Right when I float away in space and it says strani was a weak crew me everyone turned to mercy and vote for her

29:48.160 --> 29:50.160
Thank you very much

29:54.720 --> 29:56.720
By mercy

30:06.400 --> 30:12.080
I should have why didn't I go with my gut? Why didn't I go with my gut? I should have gone with my gut

30:14.240 --> 30:18.480
I knew it. She did the same thing again that she does when she

30:20.080 --> 30:22.080
Oh my god

30:24.560 --> 30:31.440
It's because mercy will accuse someone and vote for somebody who is who is the impostor and accusing her when she's the impostor

30:31.920 --> 30:34.560
And then strani gets so defensive

30:46.560 --> 30:48.560
It's a weeping

30:48.800 --> 30:50.800
I'm so upset

30:51.040 --> 30:53.040
I'm so upset right now

30:53.760 --> 30:55.760
Listen

31:09.360 --> 31:15.760
I'm so mad right now. I'm so I'm so angry. I'm gonna sit in the corner and be upset

31:15.760 --> 31:17.760
All right now

31:23.120 --> 31:25.120
Why am I impostor again

31:31.120 --> 31:33.120
Oh my god

31:39.840 --> 31:41.840
Wait, what's going on?

31:42.080 --> 31:45.680
You guys want to do a little buddy system? Hold on. Let's do a buddy. So who wants to be my buddy?

31:46.960 --> 31:48.960
I don't believe in buddies

31:51.760 --> 31:55.440
Okay, okay guys we got this we got this guys we got this

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
We're good

32:02.720 --> 32:04.960
I think we're safe

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
I

32:11.360 --> 32:13.360
Need to find somebody to chill with

32:20.480 --> 32:22.480
What the hell are you guys doing over here?

32:26.560 --> 32:30.320
Okay, all right, there's two there's too many witnesses

32:31.280 --> 32:33.280
Hi me and hey, uh

32:41.520 --> 32:45.680
This is this is suspicious. I don't like these two hanging out

32:49.040 --> 32:51.040
You hear the game

32:52.320 --> 32:54.560
Mercy mercy, I knew this one

32:56.160 --> 32:58.160
Mercy

32:58.880 --> 33:00.880
Are we alone?

33:02.800 --> 33:04.800
Okay, okay, come here come come on the hallway

33:06.240 --> 33:08.240
Wait, okay

33:11.280 --> 33:13.280
Come over here mercy come over here

33:15.760 --> 33:18.480
What are we what are we doing? We need to do a double

33:21.040 --> 33:23.040
What's going on in here

33:24.000 --> 33:29.920
Guys, I think mimosa is too timing all of us. I said she's impostor, but she's not what she is

33:30.160 --> 33:33.760
I don't know but I'm really easily gaslit. So I'm I'm gonna believe

33:38.720 --> 33:41.920
I think okay, I don't want to be with an impostor

33:45.520 --> 33:49.440
I got it. You got it. We can do a double

33:50.400 --> 33:52.400
Yes

33:52.400 --> 33:56.880
I'm I'm thinking come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'm thinking

33:58.080 --> 34:00.080
Amy and

34:01.280 --> 34:03.280
Yeah

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Hi

34:09.520 --> 34:11.520
You're gonna kill me

34:20.400 --> 34:22.880
I'm not the impostor

34:24.240 --> 34:26.240
I'm not the impostor

34:31.120 --> 34:33.120
Oh, hey

34:35.760 --> 34:37.760
Why

34:41.760 --> 34:45.200
Where the heck is Azura where's Azura at

34:45.200 --> 34:47.200
Where is Azura?

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
I haven't seen Azura

34:56.000 --> 35:02.480
I'm like so confused. Oh, there you are. I was like, where's Azura?

35:08.880 --> 35:14.960
He died only rain I found rain dead in the back of electrical nobody was nearby

35:16.160 --> 35:21.760
Um, but I have a feeling it might be rea and azura because they like to sit with each other

35:24.160 --> 35:26.160
I saw

35:26.880 --> 35:29.360
In rea together. No, I saw I mean

35:31.360 --> 35:37.200
So rea and I went together for a while and then I was to do tasks and then I was with azura and then she became

35:37.200 --> 35:39.200
I walked in on us. Yeah, I was

35:40.320 --> 35:43.040
I couldn't have vented from electrical to security

35:43.760 --> 35:50.880
And mercy are very unlikely of had to do the tame in order to do electrical unless mercy vented from below

35:50.880 --> 35:56.880
But I actually wait, did I see I don't think that would make any sense. I think it's Azura. I'm sorry

36:00.480 --> 36:02.480
Where were you

36:13.680 --> 36:21.040
I couldn't find Azura the entire time

36:36.480 --> 36:42.160
It's cuz you know what your tell is it's cuz you know what your tell is now, huh, scrawny, so you're you're gonna keep quiet

36:43.040 --> 36:51.280
Yeah, they're for half the fucking round. Are you joking? I've already done

36:54.000 --> 36:57.120

38:23.200 --> 38:25.280
Okay, well, I guess we'll see I guess we'll see

38:26.800 --> 38:30.720

38:43.920 --> 38:46.720
Why are you defending the person that's trying to kill you

38:46.960 --> 38:55.040

44:39.600 --> 44:41.600
Imi's good straw. He's good

44:45.440 --> 44:47.440
It's not Imi

44:48.240 --> 44:50.240

44:50.880 --> 44:53.280
Azura is gonna fucking I keep forgetting Azura is around

44:53.840 --> 44:58.080
Azura kind of probably killed me right then. I might not be Azura, but it's definitely rain

44:59.760 --> 45:01.760
How many do I have to do?

45:03.200 --> 45:07.840
Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Uh, I think I'm gonna go stick to Imi

45:09.360 --> 45:11.360
Where is Imi?

45:17.200 --> 45:19.200
What on earth

45:29.920 --> 45:31.920
It's rain

45:32.160 --> 45:37.760
So mercy, I don't know where straw knee was straw knee. Uh, I saw her like a long time ago

45:38.000 --> 45:41.120
But mercy was in the hallway next to admin

45:42.080 --> 45:47.120
I had walked all the way from weapons through cafeteria and then found her body there

45:47.600 --> 45:50.000
Where rea rea, where did you come from?

45:50.880 --> 45:56.880
I went from so I went in the circle. I went from admin to down and then through I think it's

45:56.960 --> 45:59.920
So, hold on. So you were the last one to see mercy?

46:00.720 --> 46:02.720
Yeah, I was I think actually

46:04.240 --> 46:07.280
Cackles you I'm voting rain because she's a sure yes

46:08.720 --> 46:10.720
I'm voting rain

46:12.800 --> 46:16.000
Listen, I'm pretty sure it's rea or she be then okay

46:16.400 --> 46:21.600
I was shooting asteroids Azura. You saw me sit in there. You walked by she be sitting there

46:22.160 --> 46:26.400
But it's either she be or rea because rea was the last to see

46:27.120 --> 46:32.640
No, no, no, no, no, but but I was with you as solo in security. Yeah

46:33.760 --> 46:38.880
Oh, I wasn't really dude. I was with you and Azura in security to rea, but listen. I thought it was imi

46:39.120 --> 46:40.800
I think it might be

46:40.800 --> 46:44.480
I don't think it's I I don't know anyone that I know it's imi is one of them

46:45.760 --> 46:46.880
Yes, I

46:46.880 --> 46:50.880
I we had every chance to kill me. We were alone so many times

46:51.520 --> 46:52.320
Really?

46:52.320 --> 46:55.520
And I didn't do it. We stood and talked. We had a lovely conversation

46:55.600 --> 46:57.600
I watched her do the oxygen

47:04.320 --> 47:07.360
I think she's grooming you I think it's Azura and rain

47:14.160 --> 47:18.960
I did I did see you walk past me, but you could have looped back around you might have been waiting for your moment

47:18.960 --> 47:21.600
That's impossible because I literally ran past

47:22.560 --> 47:24.560
Uh rain and

47:24.640 --> 47:26.640
I don't think it's

47:27.360 --> 47:31.200
Okay, listen, I know it. I don't think it's Azura at all. I think it's imi and rea

47:31.760 --> 47:33.920
Oh, shit. It doesn't matter rain get out of here

47:44.560 --> 47:50.800
All right, all right, so uh, okay, then who's it gonna be who's gonna be amy amy amy amy amy

47:52.320 --> 47:58.640
Uh, if they kill one of us that means we lose so we need to stick together

47:59.200 --> 48:05.680
Uh, or we can hit the table oxygen depleted. It's Azura. It's Azura. It's Azura. It's Azura. It's Azura

48:05.680 --> 48:09.120
It's Azura. I don't trust this. No, no, I can't

48:11.280 --> 48:14.480
Oh, no, oh, no, I mean, no

48:16.320 --> 48:18.320
If imy kills me, I'm gonna cry

48:22.080 --> 48:24.080
I trust in you

48:46.960 --> 48:49.280
It was rain so hard voting for her own

48:51.600 --> 48:54.100
Dude, I was trying to help her so you guys wouldn't think it was her

49:22.400 --> 49:24.400

50:51.600 --> 50:53.600

51:06.000 --> 51:09.440
I mean loves being bullied and teased guys she loves it. You see, you know

51:14.800 --> 51:16.800

51:21.600 --> 51:23.600
What happened

51:37.760 --> 51:39.760
Is someone echoing

51:42.560 --> 51:44.560

That was pretty that was a good round I got a I got a hand to you guys for the strat I got a hand to you guys

51:57.280 --> 52:00.400
It's pretty good. I'm upset, but it's whatever

52:14.160 --> 52:16.160
So did I it's fine

52:22.560 --> 52:27.360
I I had a feeling they were gonna pull a double on us. I had a feeling the moment they walked in

52:33.040 --> 52:35.440
I know yeah, we were both right on top of each other for that

52:43.520 --> 52:45.520
I guess I could do tasks while I'm dead

52:45.680 --> 52:47.680
I

52:55.760 --> 52:57.760
Hi, hi, what's up?

52:57.760 --> 52:59.760

53:19.200 --> 53:24.880
She was standing right there, I walk into the card room. Oh no mercy and then mercy then reports

53:28.720 --> 53:30.720
She was in shock

53:32.640 --> 53:36.240
Oh my god, how would she possibly kill people I want nervous she saw me

53:39.280 --> 53:41.280
This would be the fastest round ever

53:42.480 --> 53:44.480
It's a self-report. Oh my gosh

53:45.440 --> 53:47.440
I saw the bodies and started screaming

53:55.360 --> 53:57.360
No

54:15.440 --> 54:21.760
When that oxygen thing comes on, what do you did I look at the wrong part of the map for the oxygen because I was trying to turn it back on

54:22.080 --> 54:27.440
Look at fucking do you hear Strani lying right now? Do you hear her pulling shit out of her ass?

54:38.560 --> 54:40.560
I I cannot trust

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Strani ever again

54:44.480 --> 54:49.680
I can never I don't know why any of you ever trust Strani. I've never trusted Strani

55:03.360 --> 55:08.320
I was trying to do the oxygen and it wasn't working and I didn't know what I was doing

55:14.480 --> 55:16.480
To say that I'm top left

55:23.840 --> 55:25.840
I will choose who the imposter is

55:26.640 --> 55:28.640
Okay, go for it

55:29.200 --> 55:31.200

Me and reya we're just swiping our cards having a jolly good time and then these two come in

55:48.400 --> 55:50.400
Literally and they've doubled us

55:50.960 --> 55:52.960
Body

55:57.120 --> 55:59.120
She was in so much shock

56:00.400 --> 56:02.400
Oh god

56:04.640 --> 56:06.640
I don't trust a word strani says

56:08.080 --> 56:12.720

56:14.160 --> 56:17.600

58:16.160 --> 58:19.440

58:49.200 --> 58:51.200
I have no mercy for Ivy

58:51.200 --> 58:56.160
It took a hot second to do any type of task. She followed me from cafeteria

58:56.880 --> 59:00.160
I was strutting when you talk, I don't believe you

59:17.440 --> 59:19.440

That'd be hilarious if you killed me azura is literally lingering outside because she's waiting for one of us to be alone

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.520
She can kill us

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:19.120
I actually have to do a task for him, right? Okay. I'm gonna go bait her and if I die

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.920

What oh azura it's azura

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.760
Dude, I think it's azura too. I saw her walking into electrical. I think it's azura and mercy

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.720
And I found a body. What the fuck?

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.320
What the fuck me and strongy are good. I was hanging out strongy looking at cameras

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.440
Azura was lurking around in camera

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.720
But then also mercy's someone to follow being creepy. Uh, I'm gonna vote for mercy because she don't trust how she's looking at me

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.800
Oh when you killed her

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.880
It's rain

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.800
But why where's the reasoning azura

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.080
I said it. I was literally with you guys in I was literally with you guys in security

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.640
I went to security with you guys and then I went up

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.560
I went and did my task and came back down and she said did she accuse me

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.440
Did she accuse me

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.040
All right, all right strongy stay with me strongy strongy strongy strongy come back

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.000
All right, trust any of you guys man. I'm sticking with you strongy. Uh, do I have anything to do it down here?

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.720
It's mercy and rain

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.960
It's mercy and rain

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.760
They were gonna double kill they win if they do a double kill they win

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400
Azura you have to listen to us

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.680
Okay, we're voting rain. We're voting rain. We're voting rain. We're voting rain

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.640
Because her and mercy almost doubled me and strongy. That's all i'm gonna say

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.920
Man, you guys were you guys were lining yourselves up to stab me in my butthole. I don't I don't believe you

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.080

It's mercy

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.360
She's creeping me out

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:28.160
She's running in a circle chasing me and strongy when I actually have the chance to actually like pay attention

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.480
What is her

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:39.360
Because I spent the entire game fucking with other shit and now I get to finally play. Yeah

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.120
If Azura is an impostor, I'm really gonna commit

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.640
Yeah, they were gonna double us they were gonna double us

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.000

I was like, oh shit. Look strony. Strony. You said it was mercy. You said it was mercy

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.880
But you instantly went for me

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.640

Okay, who's next?

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.080

Bring her on the rose. Oh, okay. I thought she's just she's just quiet. Yeah

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.400

All right, who is it mim's rain. I cannot believe you just did that

Okay, because we got to get mercy back in. Okay, mim's just I don't even know man. Okay

Is that how you pronounce it shabby shabby shabby shabby shibbers shibberton shibbillit shibbethany

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.600
I did it for us

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360
All right, I'm gonna go get some water

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.280
I got it

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.280
Yeah

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.280
Thanks a lot. I like

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.280
I like how I know I make canik runs. She does like this in the lobby. I like how she does that

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.240
Game could make me and Mary play the imposter again for another flawless victory. That'd be great

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.600
You guys are really good imposter. I haven't gotten imposter once

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560
I fucking love it

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.840
And when there's two of us together, I love going three two one

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.600
Anyways, my next goal is to follow someone just for fun. No

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360
Why do you sound so far away?

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.600
Oh

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:05.520
I like how her kitchen is right next to her gus. That's cool. I want food right next to me all the time

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.520
I like believed her I believed her

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360
She doesn't even like change the tone of her voice

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.680
You can't you didn't change your tone of voice at all when lying

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:36.320
Is that 200 by people never trust reya? I can't tell

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.520
You can tell really good mercy you caught on to me

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.120
My mouth is dry

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.440
I'm sorry Reya

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.280
Thank you, she knew

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.360
I am

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360
I believe

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.760
I believe right until the end

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.960
I can never tell if she is ever lying or not. I can never tell if

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.640
I can tell

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.360
And loud

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:15.200
Because every time you you you don't let someone finish

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.360
It feels like you're being defensive and not letting the person speak. So you

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.320
I assume that you're the yeah

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.320
You gotta let me you gotta give me really gotta let me explain the reason

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.720
You

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.720
You gotta you gotta let me explain why and then you have to tell me why I'm wrong

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.080
Well, yeah, because you didn't let me speak

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.520
Yeah

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.920
Oh

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.200
40 days

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.960
Biblical suspension

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360
Yeah

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.560
So I'll say one thing the girls have never seen me

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.640
Any other type of motion other than like happy and proud of their work

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.120
So playing among us when I'm screaming down the make being like it's fucking

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.480
Is probably quite a surprise. It is I was just like

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.960
Nice and refreshing

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:46.800
I want to I want to see a zara and rea or stronti and rea team up. That's what I want to say. That'd be funny

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.640
I haven't gotten imposter once

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.360
Yeah, guys, let's give us a chance

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:59.600
Let's give us our imposter the statistics of a zero being imposter very high. No, just keep that in mind

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.760
By the way for your probability

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.800
Don't do that. See look. She's gaslighting you man. I'm gonna get killed. She says things like this

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.760
Everybody

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.640
I'm eating goldfish

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.160
This is a regular kind of goldfish always sus stronti because he says the sus is shit ever

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
Again

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.760
Over here

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:44.560
My cat is walking around my desk, sir

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.640
What are you looking for? There's nothing here for you. Sorry. I'm talking to my cat. Hi stronti

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.080
What do you want dude

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360
You can hang out

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.960
Okay

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.520
Hmm

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.920
Lotta D lotta da

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.880
lotta do

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.280
Just doing the work. I'm supposed to

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.320
Because that's what bunnies do

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I'm pretty good at my job

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.240
I could eat some corn on the cob

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.480
Don't know

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:40.720
Wait, where's the body? Where was the other body? Oh my god. Oh my god. Holy shit. All right. Well

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:47.760
Wait, where was everyone? I was about to report wait, wait, wait, where's my let me talk to she saw the body

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:53.600
Rae was literally with me and stronti as well. I saw stronti. I passed by those two

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I wasn't like your cold. There was a body there

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.720
Um, well

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.040
First of all

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.400
Excuse me

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.000
Secondly, I was shooting asteroids and I walked down and there was a body at oxygen and it was mimosa

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:14.400
She was probably doing like a little shoot being up by is anyone being a navigation or two or weapons?

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.920
Yes, or no. Yes. No, I was in cafeteria

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:24.560
I was about to do electrical. Who is cafeteria? I know it's stronti. I just know it's stronti. I just know it's stronti

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.880
No, I think you're fucking wait. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. I see who's been near

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:37.040
weapons o2 navigation because you have reported the body and where o2 and you automatically go is stronti

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.520
Sorry, I know you love playing these main games

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:47.680
No, no, no, no, I was shooting asteroids. It's stronti. I mean, it's stronti

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.240
Notice how I'm nice and calm and she's freaking out and that's almost that

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.360
Because you're picking on me when you were self reported the body when you're the only person who's been witness

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.400
Or two navigation well clearly because the body was wait was there for a lot longer

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.280
The body must have been there for a while

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.360
I was chilling in the cafeteria talking to my cat and then I went and shot some asteroids

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:20.880
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I mean, who are you with again? I was with reya and stronti was in the room with us when we swiped the cards

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.680
Yeah, I was in the acting room. We were hanging out

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.600
Where was reya's body?

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.120
No, I didn't know because she was alive and then when she walked off and then

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.960
That's and then I was singing a song going somewhere

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.440
When the round goes fast is stronti because stronti kills fast

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.480
All right, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Oh my god

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.800
Good luck

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.360
Oh

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.920
The moment she starts getting defensive and loud she is the imposter

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.920
I know that's what I mean. I'm like I had had to have happened long ago

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.000
I wish you guys could see all the gesturing that I'm doing right now

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.680

Hello

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.040
Are you sniffing me?

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:01.760
Hey, I want everyone to tell me their location right now. I was sniffing shabby

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.320
She was I was doing the events or whatever it's called

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.760
Okay, it's not azura. I promise you

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.880
I think it's rain

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.040
I saw rain

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.720
Stocking azura

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.040
That's all I'm gonna say

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.720
Are you kidding me? I said no, no, I'm not saying it's you. I'm saying it's rain. Oh

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.000
No, let me vouch for people. It's not azura or shibi. Okay. Look, let's see. I'm vouching for people

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.960
It's definitely because shibi was following me and then I was following azura and then Amy. Imi was sniffing my ass

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Who I was doing the leaves

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.400
Listen, I don't want to ditch my gen

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:00.560
Look, I don't want to accuse my gen but Imi like you're a little bit quieter than she usually are

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.560
Strawny, why are you so quiet?

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.040
I'm in storage with

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.640
I was in storage with Imi

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.800
That is me and shibi

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.400
Imi

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.400
So then mercy and Imi then

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.960
I will only say that I was not with rain the entire time

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:49.440
I don't know if it's rain or Imi if Imi was biting her time because she almost hurt me again

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.080
I think it's mercy

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:07.520
I'm voting rain. I'm voting rain. Whatever. I don't know. I don't fucking know. Imi. I swear to god. Imi

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:54.160
It's I'm just I thought it was Imi, but I think it might be rea or Azura. Okay. It's not rea

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.960
It's literally not rea. I watched her do a body scan

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.440
Just didn't kill anyone that first round. It's Azura or Imi trust them. Okay. Where's Imi?

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:09.360
Where is she? She dead somewhere? Okay, she's right here

Okay, I need to do some my tasks. How about that? All right, me too. All right, Imi if it's

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.760
Oh mimosa mimosa

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.680
It might be mimosa because she did a double take but then she realized somebody was nearby

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.040
I need to tell somebody this information

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:39.600
Okay, I'm gonna tell you something in case I die. No

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.320
It might be mimosa because she did a double take but then she saw rea was nearby

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.840
Oh my god. Oh wait. Just kidding. Nevermind. It's Imi

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.120
Oh my god

01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:58.720
Oh, okay. Well, it's not mimosa

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.800
No, no, uh rain was with me a rain was with me

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:15.280
I I went yeah, I was with everyone and I ran over to rain to tell her that I thought it was mimosa, but apparently it's not because she's dead

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.600
Because mimosa did a double take and I thought she was gonna kill me

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:33.760
I didn't see her. I didn't see her killer though. Listen, if it's not Imi. It's rea. Trust me. No, it's not rea

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.360
I saw her do a body scan, but she's the one like she might not have killed that round. I'm sorry. Imi

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.560
Oh, no

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:53.280
Oh

01:44:53.600 --> 01:45:00.080
Wait a second. It's not me rain. You just have a seductive suspicious suspicious voice

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.080
Listen, I solemnly swear. Okay, rea. We're the only ones we can trust

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:10.320
We have to figure out if it's a zur or rain

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:13.440
I think it's rea

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.440

Yay, it's not really much of a conclusion other than us all accusing each other and never talking

01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:56.340
We deserve a call

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.740

Wait. What's that then?

01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:00.660
Not much man. Oh, I get it. Your leaves look like your bunny ears. Is that what you're going for?

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.700
I'm a carrot

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:06.580
Oh, I thought you were like a weird-looking rabbit. No

01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:10.100
No, I mean

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.440
Right as she's bullying me

01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:17.300
She's saying I'm a weird looking rabbit

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:26.000
She's the ice holder I was a carrot Mamosa. Why are you standing scarily to the side?

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:31.960
Waiting for her moment like hello, where's a zero

01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:40.300
Oh

01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:59.300
Okay, it's not she be or rea

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:01.300
Oh

01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:14.400
Well, I wasn't near medbay. I was all around the perimeter rain saw me doing the leaves and I was on cam

01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.580
Strani

01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:23.580
Hold on hold on

01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:29.180
Wait, is it a Zura's Mike

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:36.240
Who said scrawny three times in a row do it again. I dare you

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.360

No, wait, Mamosa Mamosa Mamosa let her here let her let Mamosa talk Mamosa. Where were you?

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:03.120
I

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:07.640
Don't know who to put I don't know if it's Johnny or Mamosa. I don't know if it's Johnny or Mamosa

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.920
You think it's it's Johnny Mamosa. Oh, no, I wish I voted

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.120
Yeah

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:43.920
It's Johnny, it's Johnny

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.320
Dude

01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.800
Oh my god

01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:00.400
Where's rea if it's the joke oh, she's right here hi

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.280
Think it's the Joe, why do you think it's

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.200
Why do you think it's why do you think it's I'm so nervous

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:39.560
Focus I just can't hear it. I just can't hear you where she goes. I know I heard it too

01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.320
I have seen because I knew if I voted I feel like I would have tied it

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:01.560
You did the same thing to me when we both were innocent

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.000
He doesn't listen to people

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.480
Refling has said it's not about Johnny being nice or not

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.080
It's about me being dangerous which has been proven in previous rounds

01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.960
Leave me when I'm freaking a crewmate

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:42.360
Yeah, it's true and every time every time we start you always say that it's probably always gonna be someone or you say that

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.560
I hope scrawny is an imposter

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.080
First

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.640
She's a pasta don't worry mercy. I'll guard you with rea

01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:16.340
That will be so funny if like it is scrawny and she comes

01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:24.400
Please don't hurt me. Oh, I'm really focused on this card read. Can you guys go do that?

01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:33.080
I

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:51.200
No, it's not I was actually just with scrawny

01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:53.800
I

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.480
Talking you're talking to the wall talking to your chat and it was quite cute. So I was just staring at you

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.480
So it wasn't you

01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:26.880
As soon as it's her as soon as she blames me, I know it's rain. I know it's rain

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:39.360
Her accent

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:49.560
It was the dealio so my most offense the body wear we found out of reactor

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.200
I

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.360
Was just swiping a card

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:10.720
And I told you guys to go worry about that

01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:13.720
Whatever man

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:23.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's raining too quiet rains me too quiet

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.120
The other one is obviously strong

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.960
If I die scrawny killed me

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I think scrawny's fine

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:09.960
I

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.200
Already did my card swipe

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:25.520
Yeah, cuz me me and scrawny were hanging on medbay, so I believe Rhea's claim on the fifth card Mamosa

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.920
Mamosa say your piece

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:45.480
I don't I don't know who to vote for I was with scrawny and medbay

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:55.640
Yeah, we were we were touching each other up in medbay she was watching she was doing a full body scan am I a delicious bod

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:14.800
Mamosa she could have killed me at any time and it could have been like well now we can't hit the button

02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:20.360
Oh, no, I

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.920
If it's scrawny, I'm literally gonna cry

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:34.000
Okay, we're good. I feel like I should go hit the button. No

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.280
I don't trust it. I don't trust it. I don't trust it. I don't trust it. I don't trust it

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.400
Going for the button. I'm going for the button. I'm going. No wait. Maybe it's not I mean I

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:55.380
Feel like I feel like I feel like oh no

02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.800
Are you serious

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.720
No, I was

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:04.940
The button

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.240
Okay, okay, okay, scrawny, scrawny, where are you?

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:15.520
Oh, I don't think it's I me she could have killed me

02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:31.040
Wait, what happened wait what happened everyone you guys don't clear the sabotage no one ever clears the sabotage

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.360
Oh

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.840
Not the lights the lights doesn't yeah, I said that we won

02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.400
Oh

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:05.480
I'm

02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:09.920
One more one more one more one more we need a good finish

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.680
I was trying to include you in the imposter ring

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:30.360
Me to cover you I'm so proud of you. That's a go back in my my vaughn

02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:37.320
Oh, no, we didn't even clear the tasks. I just look at the bar

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.920
That's so weird, I don't know why

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:49.320
Who was the other imposter it was me. Oh, it was okay

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.400
I had a feeling it was

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:57.640
Rhea cuz she she was very quiet

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:04.560
Sometimes I walk places cuz I like again, I don't really I just wait for someone to die. I

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.640
Like most of the time forget and I hate doing stuff on electrical

02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:17.400
Because it's perfect time for someone to come up and stab you in the back

02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:25.680
And I'm nervous. Oh, okay, you guys are here cool. I feel a little better unless you both kill me that would be awkward

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:30.360
Oh

02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.640
Someone got disconnected and that's why the game ended. That's why

02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.640
One of the hair was telling me

02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:02.600
Together in medbay you both together in medbay and I walked into medbay and she was dead

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:06.160
You killed her in medbay you both were together

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:08.880
We both saw you

02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:25.520
Listen to me. All right, so we were talking we were hanging outside of maybe me and ame was looking outside of medbay

02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:28.360
We were looking outside of maybe yeah, mercy and

02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:32.320
mercy and rain was in medbay together and

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:37.560
Ame went off and then I went down and rain was dead

02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:43.560
Okay, you want me to tell my story? I walked into medbay. I did the little thing

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:47.560
It said I was purple three as purple three and I told rain to guard me

02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:54.800
Because I didn't trust rain and then I walk outside. I lost rain for a second. I walk out and I see Azra kill rain

02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:59.860
I saw the body. Why you've been so good at gaslighting this entire time

02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:08.160
Something tells me it's Azra. I've had so many L's. I've had so many L's this entire time

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:11.440
Something tells me it's Azra, but I'm gonna skip

02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:19.040
I have seen from this note

02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:28.360
See

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:38.640
She was a bit shaky she was

02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:48.000
Mercy just know if you're not an imposter. I didn't kill you

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.600
Watch this

02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:57.000
I had a feeling I told you my gut doesn't lie

02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:00.200
All right, all right, all right
