00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
Hello. Hi there. Hello, sweetheart. My name is Sheevy Cottonbomb. I'm your mistress and the

00:09.840 --> 00:17.040
madam of Wonderland. I bet you enjoyed Emmy's debut. Isn't she just the cutest? Hope she didn't

00:17.040 --> 00:24.400
put too much of a spell on you. Okay, well, now you do well to behave and listen. However,

00:24.400 --> 00:29.600
first things first, we're gonna practice some obedience. So I'm gonna have you try

00:29.600 --> 00:34.160
something for me. Can you say aha or type A's in the chat?

00:39.040 --> 00:49.760
Good job. I'm so proud of you. Okay, so hold on. Let me just come and set up my desk. So yeah,

00:49.760 --> 00:54.800
I know my desk is messy. I'll clean it off later. As mentioned, my name is Sheevy, but you must

00:54.800 --> 01:01.280
refer to me as Madam or Ms. Sheevy, if you like. My surname may sound silly to you, but it's a known

01:01.280 --> 01:08.560
fact in my family that we have buns of steel. My last name just showcases that. I was born on

01:08.560 --> 01:15.760
September 28th, which just happens to be Monday. My parents just seems to have really gotten the

01:15.760 --> 01:24.320
timing right, I suppose. I am pretty tall in my family at 168 centimeters. That's a five, six,

01:24.320 --> 01:31.840
and a miracle if you didn't know. I'm a lap and polla, otherwise known as a bunny girl. You see,

01:31.840 --> 01:38.640
I have a lovely set of floppy ears in this picture right there. I can also DJ like I just can't

01:39.120 --> 01:45.920
I have the many characteristics of a rabbit, like my stamina, for example. I'm also very good at

01:45.920 --> 01:51.200
jumping and have quite the vertical. My family is mad at me, though, because I didn't pick up

01:51.200 --> 01:58.720
basketball like a distant relative of mine. So my age, that's really quite rude of you to wonder.

01:58.720 --> 02:07.360
And although I might have some motherly qualities, I'm not old enough to be your mother. In human

02:07.360 --> 02:13.120
languages, I only fluently know English, but pleasure doesn't really need words, does it?

02:14.240 --> 02:21.360
I'm also fluent in bunspeak, but my accent and pitch, it really only comes out if I'm excited.

02:21.360 --> 02:30.640
So normally it sounds like this. But I get really excited talking to you guys, and this is very rare.

02:31.200 --> 02:38.080
This is what I sound like. So let's look at my likes and dislikes. So first of my likes,

02:38.080 --> 02:44.960
I really do enjoy a wide range of music genres. I can't sing well, but I try my best and I just

02:44.960 --> 02:50.480
try to have fun with it. Huge fan of really any sort of techno with bass and thump, you can really

02:50.480 --> 02:57.360
feel anything that makes me move. Besides country, the only good songs to come from country are

02:57.360 --> 03:04.560
Ram Ranch and Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy. I'm not the pickiest eater, but I do have my favorites.

03:04.560 --> 03:11.680
I love love love a seafood. I'm a woman of opulent taste, lobster. My mother also always prided in

03:11.680 --> 03:18.000
how well I ate my veggies as a wee rabbit. I even like Brussels sprouts. I love fa and Spanish food

03:18.000 --> 03:24.080
as well. And I have a few junky comfort foods like Uncrustables. I f***ing love Uncrustables

03:24.080 --> 03:28.720
and Puppy Chow. I have that really rarely though, because you know, I gotta keep up with this nice

03:28.720 --> 03:37.920
figure. So from my hobbies, when I'm not in the dungeon, I mean managing the Wonderland Hotel,

03:37.920 --> 03:44.800
you can catch me reading a book, practicing my knots. As you can see, I do jujitsu. One time

03:44.800 --> 03:52.640
during a jujitsu class, I accidentally put a pier to sleep with just my thighs. Whoopsies. I do

03:52.720 --> 03:57.280
watch a lot of anime, but I'm probably kind of labeled like a normie for my taste. I recently

03:57.280 --> 04:03.360
watched Dungeon Meshie and Three Rin, you know. If the theme is really sci-fi or fantasy, I like it.

04:03.360 --> 04:10.160
Like Firefly, Stargate, Star Wars. I'm a freaking nerd. Don't tell anybody though. I have to keep

04:10.160 --> 04:16.080
up an air of mystery. Some games you'll see me play will be like meta-ish games. I love Inscription.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.200
I like Souls Likes like Elden Ring. I like Liza P. I really want to dive into more retro games.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.880
I also like RPG story-driven games like Elder Scrolls, horror games like Alien and Amnesia.

04:26.880 --> 04:33.120
And I recently discovered I like Relics like Halt of the Lamb. I'm embarrassed to admit this.

04:33.120 --> 04:38.880
I played a lot of FPS growing up like Counter Strike 2, so I'm trying to widen my horizons.

04:38.880 --> 04:45.760
Let's just not talk about my 600 plus hours. Okay, these are kind of self-explanatory.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.360
Don't play your music too loud. Nobody else wants to hear it. I don't like being in really large

04:49.360 --> 04:54.800
crowds. It just freaks me out. I don't like when somebody disobeys me. Do not disobey me.

04:54.800 --> 05:00.800
Don't like when people correct me. I'm the one giving correction. All right. And I hate getting

05:00.800 --> 05:05.760
interrupted during any sort of playtime, and I hate when people put things in the wrong place.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.440
It's there. I like organized chaos. So here are some of my goals. I like to beat a Souls Likes

05:11.440 --> 05:15.840
on stream. I'd be in Elden Ring already, and I'd be in Liza P. Offstream, but you know,

05:15.840 --> 05:19.440
I would like to do something with you. I would like to learn another language because

05:19.440 --> 05:23.520
everybody else is super cool, and I'm not, and they all know other languages. So I want to have

05:23.520 --> 05:29.760
a video hit 100k views and hit 10k subs because if I reach those milestones, I know I'm doing

05:29.760 --> 05:33.920
something right and that you guys are enjoying my content. I want to go to a convention as a

05:33.920 --> 05:38.800
robot like they're doing at off-key right now and be like, hey, and just try to like hit people

05:38.800 --> 05:42.480
with it. I think that'd be really fun. I would love to release another cover. You guys will see

05:42.480 --> 05:47.280
that we have covers coming up. Mine's not good, but you know, we can try again. I would love to

05:47.280 --> 05:54.400
voice in an anime or some other form of animation. I would love to travel, off-clad with the girlies,

05:54.400 --> 05:58.320
and I want to make amazing friends in other companies, you know? There's a lot of amazing

05:58.320 --> 06:02.000
talents out there that I would love to get to know. Here's my general art tag. This is Sheebie

06:02.000 --> 06:08.320
Art. We're not going too crazy with it. My alternative, my naughty art tag is Abundage.

06:08.320 --> 06:14.560
Memes are Bunwild. My live is Sheebie Live. Clips are a cotton bum clip. And my fan name,

06:14.560 --> 06:19.440
we're going to pick it together in my 2.0. I came up with harem this morning.

06:19.440 --> 06:25.680
Myoshi Marks are a rope and a bunny. It's pretty self-explanatory. Okay, so my first impressions

06:25.680 --> 06:30.560
of the girls, I put like where I would take them on a date. So first, Rani, she's hardworking,

06:30.560 --> 06:34.160
and I know she loves Lord of the Rings. So we're watching all of the Lord of the Ring

06:34.160 --> 06:38.080
movies together while we snuggle. Mercy, I would take her to a steak house

06:38.080 --> 06:43.280
because knives. She's dangerous. She lives life on the edge. Get it? High fedge.

06:43.280 --> 06:48.000
Azura, I want to cook a meal together with her and take her in a picnic. Probably something milk-based.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.560
I think she'd be able to provide that. Getting ice cream with icy would be amazing.

06:52.560 --> 06:57.600
If we could just watch the sunset, you know, all the aurora borealis. We go back to her hometown.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.760
For Amy, I want to take her to a coffee shop with a bookstart and feeder pastry. She's so

07:01.760 --> 07:06.400
cute. I just want to stuff her little face with food and then find her more grimoire so she can,

07:06.400 --> 07:10.400
you know, get her bro back. I don't really know what they got going on, but it's something. I want

07:10.400 --> 07:17.360
to give a huge thank you to SquishyGoogle and Nari. They did such an amazing job. If they hadn't

07:17.360 --> 07:21.760
done all the work that they did, I would not be here. None of the girls would be here. And here

07:21.760 --> 07:27.360
is also a thank you to all these other wonderful people who, without their help, I wouldn't have

07:27.360 --> 07:32.720
all this cool stuff. Like, thank you. Guys, work so freaking hard. I appreciate it so much. Okay,

07:32.720 --> 07:40.800
let's go to my bedroom. I can shut myself off. Hello. Hi. You can see my beautiful face. I'll

07:40.800 --> 07:47.760
go through. Hold on. Let me just... So you got my beautiful feet. My little stompers. I'm gonna step

07:47.760 --> 07:55.600
on you with them. My long, luscious legs covered with my beautiful tights. And then, you know,

07:55.680 --> 08:00.000
naturally I'm wearing shabar roads. But don't get it twisted. Just because I'm tied up doesn't mean

08:00.000 --> 08:05.440
I'm not going to be the one calling the shots. Okay, sweetheart. All right. Somebody asked,

08:05.440 --> 08:11.840
does these ropes leave marks? Yes. I like to wear a really lacy lingerie. I mean,

08:11.840 --> 08:15.440
this is just a shirt. It's just a normal shirt. I don't know what you're talking about. And then

08:15.440 --> 08:22.560
my lovely choker. It's very avant garde, don't you think? And then we have my beautiful face. I'm

08:22.640 --> 08:28.320
gonna quickly run through my toggles. We got blushing. We got sweating and blushing. We got

08:28.320 --> 08:35.680
hard eyes sweating and blushing. I can be really, really dark if you disappoint me. I'd be really

08:35.680 --> 08:42.720
upset. My love, did you do that? Piece of shit. And I can try. Which is rare. So I'm not gonna use

08:42.720 --> 08:49.760
that for long. I can have a real mouth. And then I can be like, holy crap. When were you gonna tell

08:49.760 --> 08:58.960
me you're so small? And then I can question my life choices. Have a leash. Yeah, you're on my leash,

08:58.960 --> 09:05.760
baby boy. I can also bop you. So be good. You're not gonna like where this goes. At long last,

09:05.760 --> 09:14.080
the time for edging is over. Release roof links and feast your eyes on the lovely Scottish

09:14.080 --> 09:26.560
fish, straw me. Give her all my love.
