212000	234000	I'm very excited, I have on my desk so much stuff.
234000	256000	You can call me big sis.
256000	270000	Pretend you can't see my ball gang under my neck.
270000	292000	No, no, I'm just myself today, I'm just wearing a different outfit.
292000	300000	Hello, you guys like the new emote?
300000	306000	Let me see if I can fix that real quick.

336000	344000	Hold on, I'm taking off my, taking off my, my cat, the clown is your favorite emote.
344000	360000	I'm very licensed, I'm a licensed esthetician.
374000	390000	What the heck?
390000	396000	There we go.
396000	406000	That's better at least.
406000	418000	Yeah, the really intense crying one is one of my favorite past PL emotes and so I had to bring it back.
418000	424000	One of my done doing my makeup, you've only one makeup twice in your life.
424000	430000	Well, I love makeup, I love it a lot actually.
430000	438000	I don't really wear makeup that much anymore because I don't leave my house, but today I'm going to be doing your makeup.
438000	444000	I'm going to be giving you some personal attention before I go.
444000	450000	I hope you enjoy it, since I leave tomorrow for my trip to see my family.
450000	457000	I'll be gone until the 23rd and I'll miss you guys a lot, so I thought I'd be nice today.
457000	470000	And I kind of walk you through like a skincare routine and then I'll brush your hair and do your makeup, give you a little ear massage.
470000	474000	Oh yeah, do you ever do your makeup just to sit around the house?
474000	480000	Yeah, I literally put on like a full face today to get my nails done when I really didn't need to.
480000	487000	I did light blue for my nails and I kept them a shorter length, I didn't do them super long.
487000	490000	So they're nice, they're cute little almond nails.
490000	493000	A little picture from after stream.
493000	500000	Yeah, I'll miss you guys.
500000	509000	This includes, yeah, yeah, I'm going to do your hair, I'm going to wash your hair, I'm going to brush it.
509000	514000	You're going to do a lot of triggers today.
514000	524000	Yeah, I hope you guys enjoy, I hope my AC and my background noise like my cat eating right now is a bit too distracting.
524000	531000	I'm very nervous for tomorrow because I fly out, my mom's bringing me to the airport.
531000	540000	I'm very anxious because I haven't flown in a very, very long time and I don't like traveling by myself.
540000	546000	So of course I'll remember you, you'll be all that I'm thinking about when I'm gone.
546000	549000	It's going to be so hard.
549000	563000	But when I come back, I have a special, special, sorry that was boomy, a special Twitter space I want to do on my alt for you guys.
563000	569000	I had the idea and I was going to do it today but I'm like nah, I'll do it when I come back.
569000	586000	Another thing, I want to apologize in advance because I never recorded the ASMR video that I was supposed to and so it's definitely not going to be edited in time for my absence.
586000	592000	But I do have some shorts coming so I hope you guys like the shorts.
592000	598000	Yeah, and I'll probably do a Twitter space while I'm there and talk to you guys.
598000	602000	I'll be active on social media.
602000	604000	Yeah.
604000	607000	Well, I miss you guys a lot.
607000	613000	Yeah, I'm going to be really sad without the kitties.
613000	614000	What?
614000	618000	What is that, Emote?
618000	620000	What is that?
620000	627000	Oh wait, that's the, it looks really weird reflected on YouTube.
627000	635000	The little pen lights look really fucking goofy.
635000	640000	Some of these translate very weirdly on YouTube but it's fine.
640000	643000	Let me tweet that I'm live.
643000	647000	You don't see anything in my hand.
647000	652000	There's nothing there.
652000	656000	Okay, let me just...
656000	666000	Um, Boomi is running in circles around the couch. She seems to be having a good time.
666000	672000	Oh, we hit 11k followers on Twitter! Let's go!
672000	674000	That's awesome. That's so cool.
674000	682000	And we're so close to 10k, guys. I'll probably be 10k in the middle of my trip.
682000	689000	Give me some ideas for 10k.
689000	691000	Um, you say...
691000	694000	Oops, I can't type.
694000	697000	Ow, my nose!

762520	768480	um a few times so I might be called again but um it's just really incredible how just

773760	783320	very thankful for that um he discovered me via that video yeah I love reading the comments
783320	787720	on that video and people are really funny people think Azera is faking her voice which
787720	793000	is I think is my favorite cause that's just how she actually talks she doesn't point
793000	796240	on a voice or anything.
796240	803000	I don't know why youtube keeps calling us um again the AI thinks that it's not appropriate
803000	812760	growth it thinks that it's not real so it is what it is um I don't know why I'm so anxious
812760	814080	I'm feeling very shy.

3027800	3032840	okay now that I brushed your hair out I'm just gonna let your hair air dry um
3033720	3036920	I think I don't want to like use my hair dryer on you it'll be too loud
3042920	3043880	so now that
3046520	3053000	we did your hair we brushed it out it looks nice it looks so nice down really really good um
3054120	3056200	now I'm gonna do your skincare okay
3057080	3069080	so um I'm gonna go and already washed your face so I'm going to use a chemical exfoliant
3070680	3073880	this is what I watched on on on YouTube
3075960	3079880	so don't worry a chemical exfoliant isn't bad it's fine
3080840	3087560	so you have a very unique um balance on your face and so you want to balance your AHA
3088200	3096360	and your um BHA on your face um it's better to use a chemical exfoliant than a physical
3096360	3102680	exfoliant because physical exfoliant can make micro tears in your skin and the micro tears in
3102680	3110280	your skin can cause acne and cause your skin to be very sensitive um so I'm using uh Paula's Choice
3111560	3115880	exfoliant on your face it's not gonna burn
3119080	3127880	I'm just gonna put some on this cotton pad
3133640	3136680	okay I don't have a lot of product left in us
3141320	3146760	it's fine I watched it on YouTube it's what the beauty guru told me to do
3152040	3157400	no I know you normally use soap and water but sometimes just soap and water can dry out your
3157480	3162680	skin and you want to make sure you're fully at your skin otherwise you're gonna get black heads
3162680	3171240	and white heads and acne and I'm trying to help you okay it's also good for discoloration
3173320	3179000	so let me wipe your face close your close your eyes close your eyes
3179160	3181400	good goodennnina
3182040	3192120	close close close c c c c c c c c c c
3192600	3196200	c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c cigh
3197000	3198920	okay good good good good good
3198920	3200920	Good, good, good, good, good.
3207920	3209920	Well, now, keep your head straight.
3218920	3219920	Don't open your eyes.
3219920	3222920	Do you want me to poke you in the eye? It'll burn if it goes in your eye.
3228920	3238920	You can't peek. I'm not peeking.
3246920	3248920	This is what happens. You have to hold your head straight.
3259920	3260920	You're doing a good job.
3263920	3270920	So I'm using a cotton pad and I'm just wiping this along your face.
3289920	3296920	Cotton pad or cousins also? I think we do have a cousin in cotton pad.
3304920	3309920	Don't turn your head. Stay still. I need to get a spark by your nose.
3309920	3320920	See, it doesn't have any on eyes to be peppered.
3327920	3329920	Please do not sneeze in my face.
3329920	3339920	Hold on. Is that cotton on your face?
3359920	3371920	Okay, I think it's good.
3371920	3381920	So now that I put the chemical exfoliant, I don't want to put on a serum that's another type of exfoliant.
3381920	3384920	I'm not going to do lack of the gas or anything.
3384920	3389920	So I'm just going to go in with just a caudally serum.
3392920	3394920	It's a Xenome Perfection.
3412920	3416920	It smells good. I'm going to put it a little bit more.
3427920	3431920	Okay, I'm going to tap this on your face.
3431920	3433920	It smells like flowers.
3433920	3444920	You want to pat it and you don't want to rub in the serum. You always want to pat your serum.
3463920	3465920	Okay.
3484920	3486920	Nice.
3486920	3501920	Now that I've got a serum on your face, I'm going to put on a...
3501920	3505920	Let's see, what is this called?
3505920	3513920	I'm going to put some sunscreen on you because no matter what skin tone you are, sun is very powerful.
3513920	3517920	You want to avoid skin damage.
3521920	3524920	Let's shake it up.
3524920	3529920	This is Innisfree sunscreen.
3529920	3531920	That's beautiful.
3531920	3534920	It smells like flowers.
3543920	3552920	I'm going to dab it onto my hand.
3552920	3554920	Okay.
3568920	3570920	I'm going to rub this into your skin.
3570920	3578920	You always want to make sure that your skincare dries down before you go on to the next thing.
3582920	3584920	Okay.
3596920	3598920	Get some more.
3612920	3614920	Okay.
3623920	3625920	You want it?
3625920	3628920	The trick is with sunscreen, hold out your...
3628920	3630920	Yeah, give me your hand.
3630920	3632920	Give me your hand.
3632920	3634920	I'm not going to bite your hand.
3634920	3641920	So what you want to do is you want to hold out your first two fingers, so your index finger and your middle finger.
3641920	3648920	And then the amount of sunscreen you want has to be aligned on both fingers.
3648920	3650920	And then you can...
3650920	3653920	You want to incorporate that all in.
3653920	3658920	Even if you're dark skinned, you need sunscreen.
3658920	3663920	You can still get skin cancer, even if you're brown.
3663920	3667920	You can still get sunburn, even if you're brown.
3676920	3678920	Okay.
3678920	3681920	I think I put too much on my hands, but your face is fine.
3681920	3683920	Let me go wash my hands.
3693920	3695920	Okay.
3711920	3714920	Why are you still here? I thought you were going to run away.
3714920	3716920	That's right, I locked the door.
3716920	3720920	Um, as dark skin this is cat.
3723920	3733920	They don't know that I'm also brown.
3733920	3736920	They don't know that I'm brown.
3736920	3739920	Um, anyways.
3739920	3747920	So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to put on some lotion on your lips.
3748920	3753920	That's not the lotion.
3753920	3756920	That's the lotion.
3758920	3761920	Did you take the lotion?
3761920	3764920	Give it, give it back.
3764920	3766920	Sheesh.
3766920	3778920	You want to use a non-fragment lotion, just something basic, like CeraVe.
3778920	3781920	CeraVe is really good.
3781920	3796920	Because sometimes the fragrance can irritate your skin.
3796920	3806920	Make sure that when you select a, um, what's it called?
3806920	3808920	A lotion.
3808920	3812920	You don't want it to have like the first thing, sometimes it's alcohol.
3812920	3819920	And the ingredient list, you don't want it to be alcohol.
3819920	3829920	If you're, if you're very acne prone, I recommend doing a spot treatment of Penoxel.
3829920	3832920	Um, that's the brand name.
3832920	3836920	But it's good. You don't want to put it all over your face because it can dry out your skin.
3836920	3839920	But you can just dab it on.
3863920	3869920	I don't have my normal lotion, so I'm just putting on bath and body on you though.
3869920	3873920	Normally I wouldn't put this on my face, I'll just put it on my body.
3873920	3879920	Because your face skin is very sensitive.
3879920	3882920	It smells very good though.
3882920	3885920	It's a thousand wishes.
3892920	3895920	It's a thousand wishes.
3922920	3925920	It's a thousand wishes.
3925920	3928920	It's a thousand wishes.
3928920	3931920	It's a thousand wishes.
3931920	3934920	It's a thousand wishes.
3934920	3937920	It's a thousand wishes.
3937920	3940920	It's a thousand wishes.
3940920	3943920	It's a thousand wishes.
3943920	3947920	It's a thousand wishes.
3947920	3951920	Okay.
3956920	3959920	Kiddyl, you look like you're really up and sleepy.
3959920	3963920	Do you like putting lotion on your face?
3963920	3965920	That's funny.

4023920	4031920	I know about the different content.
4031920	4035920	You never want to put any sort of oil on your face
4035920	4037920	because I can clog your pores.
4037920	4040920	Coins I have to put.
4040920	4042920	I've got a serum.
4042920	4049920	I need to put a serum that helps with your pores.
4049920	4052920	It's called Nekamad.
4052920	4054920	Nekamad.

4082920	4086920	You just have a toner, which is the Paula's Choice.
4086920	4091920	You have a serum, you have sunscreen, and now you have lotion.
4091920	4093920	Go away.
4093920	4095920	Go away.
4095920	4097920	Go away.

4167920	4170920	I'm going to use this to rub it in.
4176920	4178920	It's so watery.
4181920	4183920	Let me wipe my hands off.
4193920	4195920	Okay.

4212920	4215920	Yeah, yeah, I love you too.
4220920	4224920	I just want to say thank you for helping me out with this so far.

4226920	4229920	You look like you're going.
4241920	4257920	Okay, we think you need the makeup, but that's too bad because I still want to practice.
4257920	4269920	Okay, so now that we did your skin care, I'm going to do your makeup.
4269920	4273920	So first, when you do your makeup, you want to start with the primer.
4273920	4280920	I'm going to use the NYX primer.
4280920	4282920	No, is it Elf or NYX?
4282920	4285920	Sorry, it's the Elf Supergrip primer.
4285920	4287920	It's the blue one.
4290920	4293920	It's really good at holding your makeup in place.
4293920	4295920	At least that's what the YouTube videos have.
4299920	4301920	Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

4341920	4345920	oops, so sorry.
4345920	4351920	I'm gonna cut a little Tine, just like that.
4351920	4353920	just going to rub this into your skin,
4353920	4357920	into your skin. I'm just gonna kind of like pat it.
4363920	4368920	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. Please don't cry.
4368920	4377920	Okay. It's okay. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.
4383920	4388920	I can't. Come on. I'm kissing your ear better.
4388920	4395920	Stop crying. Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream. Please don't cry. I'll take you for ice cream.
4403920	4405920	Yeah, you can have whatever flavor you want.
4414920	4420920	Okay, a bottle.
4424920	4426920	I'm gonna wipe my hands off.
4428920	4433920	Now that we have your skin primed, I'm gonna go in with the foundation.
4433920	4449920	Normally, I use new personally. I use S.T.A. water, but for you, I'm not gonna use a $50 foundation.
4450920	4459920	So I'm gonna just use the Maybelline Fit Me foundation. I can get like, you know what I'm saying?
4460920	4468920	And it is matte, porous, and it lasts 12 hours.
4468920	4482920	I got your skin tone. So it should be a good match.
4488920	4494920	Yeah, makeup's really expensive. You have no idea how much I spend on makeup.
4495920	4503920	That's why I haven't been wearing it as often. That's why I've been trying to shop for more drugstore brands.
4503920	4509920	Because usually, there's an expression in the beauty community called a dupe.
4509920	4515920	So the dupe is usually has like the same formula, but it's not like the super big name brand.
4515920	4520920	But they're very similar. They might be like one or two key differences.
4520920	4525920	But otherwise, they're essentially the same.
4529920	4533920	That's a good question. Why am I painting your face the same tone it already is?
4533920	4539920	So this is gonna even out your skin tone, because not everybody has flawless glass skin.
4539920	4553920	And if you wanted to like, cover up any deeper pores or any acne scars or anything, that would be good.
4553920	4563920	Sometimes people will use a concealer first if they have like, it's called under-concealing or under-painting.
4563920	4571920	So they will conceal the spots first and then they'll go over with a foundation.
4571920	4578920	I prefer to do foundation and concealer mostly because I don't really have a lot of spots to cover.
4578920	4586920	I'll just do concealer under my eyes, because sometimes I like dark circles because the concealer doesn't sleep well.
4586920	4590920	On the left, get this.
4597920	4601920	Like priming a wall before painting is a good question.
4601920	4605920	You don't want a little bit of concealer though. You don't want a lot of concealer.
4605920	4608920	I'm gonna go into the concealer first.
4608920	4611920	I'll look concealer under your eyes.
4617920	4621920	Why would you spend so much on makeup?
4621920	4624920	Okay, mom's spending a lot of time on makeup.
4624920	4627920	Okay, I won't tell mom this and that.
4627920	4629920	I think, I don't know.
4629920	4635920	There is like a, sometimes a definite difference in like, more expensive makeup.
4635920	4640920	I only really get the more expensive stuff for like, certain things.
4640920	4645920	So like, I'll get an expensive foundation because that's the thing that I'll be most seeing on my face.
4645920	4648920	But then everything else, I'll be like, very cheap.
4648920	4653920	Like, I'll use, like, I like color pop a lot because they're really good for nose or stuff.
4653920	4656920	But they don't break the bank.
4656920	4662920	Like, I got a lot of blushes and eyeshadow palettes from them.
4662920	4667920	But yeah, I'll get like, a really nice foundation and everything else.
4667920	4670920	I'll be like, drugstore brand.
4671920	4674920	I think that's what a lot of people do too.
4677920	4678920	Of course.
4678920	4679920	Happy time.
4679920	4680920	Happy time.
4680920	4681920	Okay.
4681920	4683920	On the dress.
4685920	4691920	I'm going to go on with my fingers for this.
4691920	4698920	So for me personally, I go in and put foundation on my face with my fingers.
4699920	4701920	And I kind of finger paint it on.
4701920	4705920	But then, I pat it out with a makeup sponge.
4705920	4707920	Usually a wet makeup sponge.
4707920	4711920	It just makes it, um, it's really good for liquid makeup.
4711920	4717920	Uh, just to kind of like, I don't know, make you have like more glowy days.
4717920	4719920	I know you can't use crayons.
4719920	4720920	I know you eat crayons.
4720920	4723920	No, you can't use them on your face either.
4723920	4732920	That's on that side, and I'm just going to rub that into my face.
4732920	4734920	Lightly.
4745920	4748920	You told me the people on the internet.
4748920	4750920	Really, you've got to do what works for you.
4750920	4753920	It's a lot of trial and error.
4753920	4760920	Um, and I've changed my makeup routine a lot over the years.
4760920	4763920	Uh, I've also tried to put crayon on my face.
4763920	4770920	You might be able to do pastels, like actual wax pastels, I don't know.
4770920	4771920	Oh, you can eat them.
4771920	4772920	Oh, you can eat them.
4772920	4774920	Please don't eat them.
4774920	4777920	Uh, no wonder why the kids at school think you're weird.
4777920	4780920	I mean, what?
4780920	4784920	Um, there are like makeup sticks that look like giant crayons, though.
4784920	4787920	It's kind of funny, they're just like foundation sticks.
4787920	4788920	Probably even a marker.
4788920	4792920	Yeah, that comes off with alcohol, though.
4792920	4795920	Yeah, I know like, oh yeah, a lot of beauty.
4795920	4798920	And you just like swipe the stick on your face.
4798920	4801920	I don't use that though, because it just doesn't work for me.
4801920	4802920	I don't know.
4802920	4804920	It feels weird.
4804920	4806920	I don't like heavy makeup.
4806920	4808920	I like makeup that feels light.
4808920	4811920	I like using the milk brand for makeup.
4811920	4814920	Um, but they're expensive, so I don't really get them anymore.
4814920	4821920	I used to get their Sunshine Skin Tint, but that thing was like 40 bucks.
4821920	4822920	Okay.
4822920	4828920	So, I already have all that makeup sponge here, so I'm going to dab this and kind of blend it.
4828920	4831920	So I'm going to blend this into your skin.
4838920	4840920	Don't move.
4840920	4842920	Close your eyes.
4842920	4844920	Close your eyes.
4844920	4845920	Close your eyes.
4845920	4847920	Close your eyes.
4847920	4849920	Close your eyes.
4849920	4851920	Close your eyes.

5012000	5017000	Where should I go with this?
5018000	5024000	Should maybe go under the spine.
5031000	5044000	So usually I blend out my concealer with the same sponge, but I'm just gonna use a different brush.
5044000	5050000	Okay, don't move. Don't move, don't move, don't move.
5050000	5057000	Okay, I'm gonna put it right under your mouth.
5057000	5062000	I'm gonna put it under your nose.

5145120	5154080	people do um their base they'll do their eyebrows or they might do their eye shadow
5154960	5161920	or and do their eye makeup or do their balls you can really go any way after this i'm gonna do
5162480	5170800	eyebrows um your eyebrows i need to be plump so let me just i have some tweezers i think i'm

5215840	5224400	do this one do this one
5227120	5236400	don't stay still stay still
5245600	5256400	so
5262640	5268080	okay you did it you did such a good job i know i know where i know where i just noticed a couple
5268320	5276560	of tweezers i should have tweezed them out here but i forgot i'm sorry i'm sorry
5279040	5286320	okay okay so we do your eyebrows i have um where is my eyebrow pencil so you can use
5286320	5292960	like a pomade that sometimes i use i used to use anastasia but i really use eyebrow pomade
5292960	5301760	now i just do that for my eyebrows and test it a little bit and i'm just gonna use
5304720	5311760	there you go i forgot to grab it pomade don't move don't move
5323360	5323760	okay
5327040	5334160	so i have a the mix my eyebrow pencil i'm just gonna pull in your eyebrows real quick did you like
5336960	5341040	shave your eyebrow off by the way did you
5343040	5349840	maybe shave your eyebrows actually before i do do that i'm gonna set and you set your foundation
5349840	5357840	i'm so stupid okay i have long marcia translucent setting powder
5360640	5367040	i'll do your eyebrows after i set your foundation because the eyebrow pencil is gonna slide around
5367680	5369200	if i don't set it with the powder
5369840	5370320	here
5373440	5380000	because i put a liquid so setting this kind of makes it more stable it makes it not want to move
5387840	5389200	i have my brush here
5389200	5396080	okay so i'm gonna
5402560	5403280	setting powder
5406000	5412160	and i'm gonna put a little bit under your eyes just to bake under your eyes a little bit and
5412160	5416400	what baking is it just it's a longer time to set so the makeup does increase
5417360	5422800	so it fills it all the gaps but you have my skin you don't have any wrinkles or bad pores so you're fine
5430080	5431520	i'm gonna tap off the excess
5440640	5441360	and it's gonna
5446480	5454320	i'm sorry i didn't mean to pull out your ears
5459920	5462320	keep your eyes closed
5476800	5478320	so
5485600	5492000	translucent setting powder it's good to get either translucent powder or powder that
5492000	5497600	matches your skin just because you don't want to end up like change trials and look like the
5497600	5504560	spider from whatever ttb show was where you just have like it's called flashback face
5507360	5511840	you're like hi sisters are you just scary buddy

5518160	5524560	church and my face was just like white my neck was brown because i put the wrong um setting powder
5524560	5529600	on and it looked really funny
5549760	5551600	right now i'm just gonna brush it off

5618560	5624240	as long as you properly clean it off if you can't put on makeup every day and you didn't wash your
5624240	5630640	face then yes it will damage your skin but nothing in makeup um can really damage you unless you're
5630640	5638160	allergic to like a fragrance or something i like a something within the makeup otherwise you should

5681840	5687040	well for example you pass out without falling asleep without taking off makeup um that's a
5687040	5694320	great question you might wake up with like a bit um because it does it can clog your pores if you
5694320	5700880	don't wash it out um but if you wake up you said to wash it off in the morning it shouldn't cause
5700880	5708480	any long-term damage i've fallen asleep with makeup on before from the morning i just like wash my
5708480	5714960	face really good exfoliate put all the gunk out i'll usually take extra care um and do a little
5714960	5721040	bit extra steps in my skincare routine whatever really happens i think it's only happened to me
5721040	5728560	like once or twice um even if i'm like not feeling good i usually i will always take my makeup off
5728560	5739920	um if you're wondering how to wash your face after you have makeup on because you're probably
5739920	5747680	wondering oh she you just did a primer to really make the foundation stay you just set it to your
5747680	5754480	skin how am i supposed to get this off well there are special cleansers you can get get it off usually
5754720	5760960	oil based cleanser um oil cleansers are ones that are good for your skin and when i say like
5760960	5766480	don't put oil on your face i mean like paper that's not the same type of oil that's a heavier um
5766480	5771920	it's like a it's a mineral oil with fragrance that's not what like a facial like a cleansing bomb does
5773040	5781120	um yeah my cellar water is good no not all of oil um as you know actually eggs are good for a
5781120	5786880	face mask eggs are very good uh do not put mineral oil on your face please that will clog your pores
5787440	5794560	um you can use makeup wipes so what i do i use um do not clean your face with vegetable oil um
5796320	5802640	i usually go in with the makeup wipes and i wipe my makeup off of the wipe and something like that
5802640	5806160	actually i have some makeup wipes right here
5815280	5821520	and this usually has like my cellar water in it oh no i don't have contact
5823280	5824640	let's go for wipe let's go
5825600	5829600	um
5833120	5841120	and after that i'll usually go in with a salic acid cleaner so that sounds scary when it is but
5841120	5848640	again um salic acid is a chemical exfoliant um that is okay and safe for your skin and small
5848640	5854480	doses so there's a certain percentage of acid in there um and so i'll do
5858560	5862080	just makeup permanently okay it's fine um
5865760	5869600	you know don't put gas when you're running in here and um
5878800	5886880	and uh i usually do that uh do i usually use um what's it called the ordinary
5888480	5892560	no it's the balm i have called a good old cleansing balm
5894000	5895760	hold on now i need to work it's gonna bother me
5899360	5906000	it's gonna bother me oh i'm getting big don't worry about it stop stop getting big
5909120	5912000	okay
5925280	5931440	it's called the anti-wrist so for skincare the anti-wrist that you can get like
5931440	5939680	Sephora or i think Ulta as well um i don't remember but uh the ingredients and the ordinary are
5939680	5945040	very affordable um and they're the basic of the ingredients so that's definitely crazy
5947920	5950800	okay i don't know what about me
5954080	5954640	and um
5954960	5955440	um
5958560	5963440	i use the old cleansing balm from that and then i wash my face with the old cleansing balm
5964880	5965760	i double wash
5968080	5972800	but again you also don't want to over wash your face because if you over wash your face you can
5972800	5980640	also strip your face of bacteria that needs to be on your face um and it can mess up your
5981280	5985840	skin so you want to make sure you use the right stuff to clean your skin
5986800	5993040	because you don't want to strip it of its natural oil and then the dryness um can make you break
5993040	5999760	out as well because then your body overcompensates for the lack of natural oils and begins to
5999760	6003040	over reduce oil you don't want that to happen
6003520	6013600	so that's why you don't want to just go in with like a hand soap and water because the hand soap
6014480	6021360	is meant to strip any bad bacteria from your hands and it won't dry out your skin and that
6021360	6024560	um you don't want to use that on your face because it's hand soap
6028320	6032640	if you have a good type of soap that's hydrating and then you put on lotion afterwards then
6032960	6037280	you're fine but sometimes um you want to make sure that you hydrate your skin
6038080	6046720	um or use like a hydrating cleanser or hydrating soap otherwise you don't dry out your skin and
6046720	6056880	it will cause more quick gout okay now that i set your makeup your foundation i plucked your eyebrows
6056880	6059760	let's go in and actually do your eyebrows i'm not filling in
6064720	6069680	so i need to make it bigger the crayon part is pretty small it's kind of like a pencil
6070560	6072640	it's called the mix micro brow pencil
6080080	6085360	you don't want to use a five in one face wash because think about it your skin on your body
6085360	6094320	your skin on your face um and your hair you're all different um your skin is a giant organ
6094320	6097600	it's the biggest organ in your body you want to make sure you take care of it accordingly
6098640	6102240	and if you use the same product i don't know it's not going to have the same effect
6106000	6111200	so yes cleanser toner serum sunscreen motion yes exactly good job
6116320	6121120	okay so it turns out i am using this to wash my face in the morning
6122720	6124800	yeah no soap not soap soup
6127120	6131520	i've been drying out my skin it's not the acne only some more acne took it yeah
6131520	6137280	so your body will overproduce oil and it'll clog your skin so if you just get like a nice
6137280	6142080	base like again sarah v um i'm gonna give you guys some typical drugstore brands
6151760	6158320	so if you get like uh love rose poise uh sarah v um
6161760	6162400	let me see
6163280	6171360	see the fill is really good you also want to know everybody's skin is different um so i have
6171360	6178720	combination skin uh so there's uh there's dry skin combination skin and oily skin um so i have
6178720	6184560	patches of my skin that are dry and i have patches that are oily um so you want to make sure you
6184560	6190480	have a cleanser for that but if you really dry skin you want to have a more hydrating um water
6190480	6204800	based uh um cleanser and and if you have a um oily skin you want um something that won't be as
6204800	6211680	heavy on your skin otherwise you're just gonna clock it up again uh so yeah and you also you
6211680	6220080	might have sensitive skin it's a lot of trial and error to get the right uh type of um skin
6221440	6227600	care routine that's why i really like seida fill and sarah v because uh you can get like a gentle
6227600	6232320	foaming cleanser to start off with and um you can kind of work your way up from there
6232320	6242080	and then like i used to have oily skin but now i have combination skin yeah vino is good
6242080	6249280	ole dove dove is surprising is like dove is trusted and true yeah skin ph exactly
6251600	6257040	um your diet does also factor in uh don't wash your please don't wash your face with hand soap
6257840	6263680	again when you wash your face with hand soap your hands come into contact with lots of different
6263680	6269520	bacteria you use that to maneuver things in the world it's a very harsh soap because your hands
6269520	6275120	can handle it um because that's what they're meant for but then your face it's not meant for that
6275280	6279760	i'll put it on your face
6283680	6288800	do not put hand sanitizer on your face that just lets it burn um you can spot treat
6288800	6295280	if you're gonna spot treat something um you can put like a little dab of a witch hazel or a little
6295280	6303360	dab of um alcohol like rubbing alcohol just to dry it out um but you want to do that if it's not
6303360	6310880	if your skin isn't positively um reacting to that then stop you really want to try you want to
6310880	6316400	test stuff out you never want to go in put something all over your face you want to spot check stuff
6317120	6324960	otherwise um you might irritate your skin and you don't want to irritate your skin
6325280	6336320	like i love um miyana and i love her uh lingerie brand the savage xfifty um she also has a skincare
6336320	6344400	brand uh i have a friend and her skin works amazing with her skincare brand but then i discovered
6344400	6350080	that i am actually allergic to something in her skincare when i tried it out she had really awesome
6350160	6353840	toner and like lotion and stuff but i don't know what i was allergic to
6353840	6358240	and it would make my skin break out even more now that's just me it works for other people
6358800	6361200	it might not work for you it might work for you
6364400	6368800	sorry she be society doesn't advertise to guys how to take care of your skin
6368800	6377040	yeah that's because for you guys from men it's mostly focused that you you know eat well and you
6377040	6383920	look good physically um in terms of like your body type um for women it's really our face and like
6383920	6393600	i'll wait so i'm not um they don't usually um uh they won't i know like some brands like they'll
6393600	6400720	advertise stuff like my dad is a very meticulously groomed man sometimes i'll make fun of him for
6400720	6406400	that and sometimes my mom does but he like my dad will do his skincare um and stuff too um
6407600	6414880	and he'll do like an under eye cream and then do like a special lotion um also if you're elderly
6414880	6421840	like myself i'm 56 um you want to you can add like a serum if you get like a retinol cream
6421840	6429040	a retinol is really good for anti aging um you want to i highly recommend there's a i can't remember
6429040	6434080	exactly what it's called but there's a cycle you want to go through when it comes to your skin
6434080	6439920	care for the best results um and you want to cycle through the serums use i'm not going to get into
6439920	6451600	all that you can just youtube that but there is like a cycle women are just very more particular
6451600	6461040	about how we groom ourselves because again we groom ourselves for men um and then obviously
6461040	6466880	for ourselves as well because what makes us feel good but um and a lot of female feminine products
6466880	6472720	were created by men so it's very interesting but then the men don't use that for themselves because
6472720	6478480	normally it doesn't affect them as much because again our hormones um
6480880	6484880	are different than men men like we both have testosterone and estrogen we do some different
6484880	6494880	levels it can be expensive but um there are so many budget friendly uh routines you can do
6494880	6504320	whether it may be for makeup or for um what's it called or for skincare like i didn't come out the
6504320	6513280	gate using like tart and like really expensive makeup and skincare brands oh i just want to
6513280	6521040	like cvs or ride aid and just like got the basic stuff that's all you really need yeah it's chemistry
6525200	6534000	yeah that is the pink tax that's usually well i'll buy like some men's products like i'll buy
6534000	6540560	men's deodorant and i'll buy men's razors because women's razors are also not as well made
6541200	6548880	same with the deodorant and um they will be a lot more expensive like one razor for a woman
6548880	6552240	might be like 20 bucks but for a guy who'll get like three for the same amount
6557680	6564000	um and really again i will recommend for like budget friendly stuff i like sarah v and setafil
6564800	6570000	um you can just search like 13 best 12 best 10 best drugstore brands
6570800	6579840	does it men's deodorant smell like men yeah but my hair products overwhelm what my armpits smell
6579840	6586480	like so you only really smell my hair and my hair smells like candy so i still smell like a girl
6591040	6595040	i want to do a face routine but i'm scared i might ruin my face more i guess i'll just water um
6596000	6602160	um actually if you you know there's stuff in your water right like if you use just half water
6603440	6609840	your water can be hard it can have like um different ph levels in it that can also dry out your skin
6616080	6620640	three and one stuff is bad don't use three and one stuff if you're gonna get get get separate
6620640	6627200	stuff you want something that will specially shampoo your hair you don't want to use the same
6627200	6631040	stuff on your hair as on your body it might not be as effective i swear so
6636400	6640400	but um if your skin is sensitive then you need to act accordingly
6640400	6648960	so i'm just tapping on this pen it's on the tap on with my hair
6651600	6652960	i'm just gonna brush
6656880	6659520	my brows a little bit they're a little bit wild
6663280	6670160	what's nice about this next thing is that i can um it has one end be the pencil and one end be
6670160	6672480	the brush i can just brush it
6681040	6686720	but honestly i bet that i don't um again i only know like girl recommendations so
6686720	6693760	if you want me to guys i can i can do some research for you and i can make like another
6693760	6700240	doing your like face and skin um but i can cure it specifically towards men um
6701360	6706720	not that this won't work for you but i'll just specifically use like men's brands um and if
6706720	6712320	you have a beard maybe you'll like like i'm in the beard oil or if you're bald like a bald man
6712320	6722880	oil doesn't an electric razor work for a body here too so you don't have to get so many disposable
6722880	6729200	ones um women don't really get marketed electric razors men do for when they shave their beavers
6729200	6730160	and stuff but women don't
6737120	6739200	okay now that
6739200	6749520	uh
6749520	6759520	do light strokes
6760240	6765840	short light strokes
6776160	6783440	i remember i like got manscaped for myself because again i wanted like men's razors are
6783440	6789040	significantly cheaper now i just use drill it men's razors are significantly cheaper than women's
6789040	6793040	and i don't like manscaped because i kept making my kuchi anytime i tried to shave
6794240	6797760	and i kept cutting my legs on accident so i don't know if the blades were so sharp
6797760	6802560	i want to try getting a single blade blade single edge whatever those things are called
6804240	6811360	you know how hard it hurts so much when you cut your pussy lip it hurts a lot guys
6819200	6823120	well there's me using all the things seems more than against nobody's skin is different
6823120	6827040	what will work for someone will not work for you what will work for you might not work for
6827040	6831520	someone else doesn't miss sharing my knowledge you don't have to change anything it's just
6831520	6838720	suggestions and recommendations and sometimes it's also down to genetics like it's that simple
6838720	6842880	like you might not have to do anything you just wake up throw water on your face and you walk out
6842880	6850080	the door and that could be genetic me i'm more acne prone um my mom still has acne and she's
6850080	6857680	in her 70s and i'm 50 um and i just never went away and so i get the occasional breakout when
6857680	6863520	i was normal when you're in an age when you're a man and a woman um you stop breaking out but
6864160	6870720	genetically just don't so i try to do preventative measures to stop really bad breakouts
6874320	6881360	sometimes it's a hormonal thing um so like for example i'm on medication for um
6883280	6890320	my acne because i'll get it like on my body that's annoying because i can't i told you guys
6890320	6895600	like i scar easily so like you know red dot for me it just turned into a brown dot and so i'll
6895600	6913040	just have like spots and i'm like i'm a leopard so i'll take i take um like a antibiotic and it
6913040	6922480	actually kills the bacteria that makes um okay so your eyebrows are nicely filled in i gave you a
6922480	6933520	good arc um so now i'm going to put a little bit of a primer on your eyelid and i'm gonna go with some
6933520	6946880	eye shadow yeah yeah i totally feel that um and that's another reason why i i'm very self-conscious
6946880	6955600	about my skin so that's why i don't know what anybody see me no man will perceive me or gaze upon me
6956400	6960800	i'm an idiot no he doesn't see me but like no i'm a woman i have womanly thoughts
6961040	6964560	but i'm much ferocious so i look like a hunchback another day

7383280	7386280	I have a lot of different types of brushes.
7386280	7390280	Usually girls don't always use the same brush.
7390280	7393280	We use lots of different type of brushes.
7393280	7396280	Oh, is there a peelio on this one?
7396280	7400280	Oh, the ones I never took the peelio off of this.
7400280	7403280	Right here, there's a really nice peelio.

7416280	7417280	What the hell?
7417280	7420280	Okay, sorry to get distracted about how cute I am.
7421280	7422280	Okay.
7425280	7426280	I'm playing and...
7426280	7428280	I need to put on some chapstick.
7428280	7429280	Oh.
7432280	7433280	Okay, I'll put on some chapstick later.
7433280	7435280	I'm still looking at my lips for now.
7437280	7438280	Okay.
7439280	7441280	Let me get some more.
7443280	7444280	Okay, I got some more.
7444280	7447280	So I'm gonna brush easy peasy over your lid.
7448280	7450280	Um, put on some...
7452280	7454280	Just a little bit.
7454280	7455280	Just a little bit.
7465280	7466280	Sorry.
7467280	7468280	Don't move.
7468280	7470280	Close your eyes.
7470280	7472280	Close, close, close, close, close.
7472280	7476280	You better be close, close, close, close, close, close, close, close, close.
7476280	7479280	Are they closed? Are they closed?
7479280	7480280	Go ahead
7489280	7490280	Done
7491280	7492280	Cool
7493280	7494280	Okay, that looks good
7494280	7495280	That looks so cute
7495280	7496280	Oh my god, okay
7496280	7501280	I'm gonna go in with a little bit of Tuscany Gone
7501280	7503280	and that's what I'm gonna mix
7503280	7507280	I'm just gonna do outside corners of the eyes
7507280	7509280	A little bit of smoke
7509280	7511280	Just a little bit of smoke
7512280	7514280	A little bit of smoke
7523280	7524280	Okay, perfect
7524280	7528280	Okay, now that we've got the eyeshadow
7528280	7530280	Usually you want to do eyeshadow before you do eyeliner
7530280	7534280	Otherwise, you're just gonna go over your eyeliner and that's it
7534280	7536280	So I got...
7536280	7538280	I don't know what you just...
7543280	7545280	Okay, got the eyeliner
7545280	7547280	So this is a pencil liner
7549280	7552280	Actually, it's like a marker, you know what I'm talking about?
7553280	7560280	So, usually, I personally don't like pencil liners
7560280	7562280	I prefer liquid liners
7562280	7564280	but everybody is different
7564280	7569280	So, what type of eyeliner do you want?
7569280	7570280	Do you want like a little wing?
7570280	7572280	Do you want like a big cat eye?
7573280	7576280	I can do like a little bit
7576280	7578280	like little wings on the other
7578280	7580280	and like mine
7586280	7587280	Do you want to like mine?
7587280	7591280	Because I have pretty good eyeliner on my eye
7591280	7593280	My eyeliner is one for you
7593280	7595280	as a kid, so...
7597280	7598280	You want like me?
7598280	7600280	Okay, I'll do like me
7604280	7605280	You have to...
7605280	7606280	You can't move
7607280	7609280	In fact, I need a whole new one
7610280	7612280	I need to shake this up
7612280	7616280	So I'm using NYX Professional Epic Ink Liner
7616280	7618280	That's the one I use a lot of proof
7618280	7620280	And it is pretty good
7620280	7622280	I'm gonna shake it up a little bit
7623280	7625280	Okay, one of those
7637280	7639280	I'm just going to...
7639280	7641280	Hold me up, like hold you
7644280	7649280	Okay, so I'm just a little wing
7653280	7654280	Close your eyes
7654280	7657280	Close, close, close, close, close, close, close
7661280	7662280	Hold on, close, keep your eye

7665280	7667280	I'm just gonna fill it in a little bit
7667280	7668280	I don't really kind of miss a spot
7668280	7669280	Okay, perfect
7670280	7672280	Okay, let me do the other eye
7677280	7678280	Other eye
7681280	7682280	Just gonna go in
7683280	7685280	Close, close, close, close, close

7693280	7695280	I thought you were gonna move
7695280	7698280	And make me go across your face
7698280	7700280	So I'm happy that didn't work out
7700280	7702280	That made that work out
7702280	7703280	Let me...
7704280	7708280	So now, what I'm gonna do
7709280	7712280	I'm gonna get some mascara
7712280	7713280	Yep, don't you worry
7713280	7716280	So for mascara, my true...
7717280	7718280	Why don't I...
7718280	7719280	Oh, I got the brush
7723280	7727280	The mascara I've used for years
7727280	7730280	Is roller lash by Benefit
7730280	7731280	It's my favorite
7735280	7737280	Hold on, let me get the mascara out
7740280	7741280	There we go
7753280	7770280	Sometimes I'll put it on my top and bottom lash
7770280	7772280	But really, I've been just doing my top lash
7772280	7774280	I have naturally super long eyelashes
7774280	7776280	So I usually get asked if I wear falsies
7776280	7778280	When I use this mascara
7778280	7779280	I don't use falsies
7779280	7782280	I just have natural and curling and long eyelashes
7782280	7784280	Thank you, genetics
7784280	7789280	Okay, this is gonna be very hard
7789280	7797280	Because you have to look up
7798280	7800280	So you have to look up
7804280	7805280	So look up
7806280	7810280	And I'm just gonna wipe this under your eye, okay?

8502280	8504280	Let me let me let you look in the mirror
8504280	8506280	Let me let you look in the mirror
8507280	8509280	Why don't you walk over to the mirror
8518280	8521280	Wow, you look so good
8523280	8525280	You look so amazing
8525280	8530280	Wow, I
8533280	8536280	You look so good in the mirror right now
8537280	8538280	Are you mewing?
8538280	8540280	Have you been mewing lately?
8545280	8546280	You're mocking everybody
8546280	8547280	You look like a model
8548280	8550280	Have you ever considered becoming a model?
8552280	8553280	Your eyebrows are on fleek
8553280	8555280	It gave you that good arch
8555280	8557280	Bust your hair out so you look nice
8557280	8559280	You're perching your lips
8560280	8562280	You look really good
8564280	8565280	You got really nice lips
8565280	8567280	I don't even have to contour your nose or anything
8567280	8569280	You can see a little bit of a shadow
8569280	8571280	I kept it nice and light
8572280	8574280	And it really goes with your outfit
8578280	8579280	Wow
8579280	8581280	Come back come back here
8581280	8582280	Come back over

8586280	8587280	What do you guys think?
8595280	8596280	Wonderful features
8597280	8599280	I don't know why you don't have everybody
8599280	8601280	Boys and girls, you know
8601280	8603280	Blasting after you
8604280	8606280	You look gorgeous
8612280	8614280	Now you can get everyone
8614280	8618280	You can pull any fit bird that your heart desires
8623280	8624280	Wait, you have a crush on somebody?
8624280	8625280	There's a girl that you like
8625280	8627280	Tell me, who's the girl?
8627280	8629280	Who's the girl that you like?
8630280	8632280	I hope they treat you right
8632280	8634280	Otherwise we're going to have problems
8634280	8636280	I don't want to have to
8637280	8639280	Have to take care of anybody
8640280	8641280	It's me?
8654280	8656280	That's really sweet and all
8657280	8658280	But um
8663280	8665280	I'm your sister
8666280	8667280	Well
8667280	8670280	I do admit that it's very sweet
8670280	8673280	That you admitted to me being your crush
8673280	8675280	You know it's kind of wholesome in a way
8675280	8677280	I'll give you a little smooch for that
8680280	8682280	You look really good
8685280	8687280	Good luck getting that all off
8687280	8689280	I actually tattooed it to your face
8689280	8691280	So I guess you're permanently gorgeous
8695280	8697280	So
8706280	8708280	The plot twist of the century
8710280	8712280	Yeah, it's permanent
8713280	8714280	It's permanent
8715280	8717280	Hold on, I have an idea
8719280	8721280	Hold on, I have an idea
8721280	8723280	Nobody move
8723280	8725280	Nobody do anything
8725280	8727280	Frick
8727280	8729280	Where is it?
8732280	8734280	Where is it?
8745280	8747280	Where is it?
8747280	8749280	Where is it?
8754280	8757280	Oh, I found it
8759280	8761280	Hold on, hold on, hold on
8764280	8766280	Please hold, please hold
8766280	8768280	Please hold
8768280	8770280	Please hold
8772280	8774280	Please hold
8784280	8786280	I kind of wish I found this earlier
8786280	8788280	Because that would be funny if I just had this already
8805280	8807280	Wow
8807280	8809280	Oh
8809280	8811280	Uh
8814280	8816280	Uh
8821280	8823280	Where are the toggles on this?
8824280	8826280	Are there any toggles?
8831280	8833280	I don't think there is
8835280	8837280	Hold on, let me throw this away real quick
8843280	8845280	Hold on
8848280	8850280	And I'm not giving myself a base chat
8856280	8858280	Sorry, it was going under my clothes
8861280	8863280	There's like something you can do
8863280	8865280	There's like more you can do
8868280	8870280	I don't know why the toggles aren't working
8870280	8872280	Is it over here?
8873280	8875280	Nope
8878280	8881280	What if I, what if I, let me go into the file
8892280	8894280	I look like I'm getting tattooed
8896280	8898280	No, it isn't supposed to be like this
8899280	8901280	I'm the one who tattooed
8901280	8903280	Let me give myself a cool face chat
8904280	8906280	Let me give myself a beard
8907280	8909280	That would be a fun ASMR stream
8909280	8911280	You're tattooing me
8911280	8913280	And I'm like an annoying client
8915280	8917280	There's a way that I can like tattoo
8917280	8919280	Oh, she on my chest
8919280	8921280	So I can't figure out how to do it
8921280	8923280	Hold on, let me see
8932280	8934280	What if I load
8937280	8939280	What are the hotkeys for this?
8939280	8941280	I wish I would let you see the hotkeys
8949280	8951280	What's it called?
8951280	8954280	The live 2D assets you load in
8956280	8959280	Alt F4, do you think I'm an idiot bro?
8959280	8961280	Ow, I just like hurt my nose
8963280	8965280	Yeah, you're being welded
8967280	8969280	I'm tattooing some makeup on my face
8970280	8972280	There are people who actually, what is happening
8972280	8974280	There are people that tattoo stuff
8979280	8982280	What if I just go through all the letters
8983280	8985280	I will find these toggles
8985280	8987280	As if it's the last thing I do
8997280	8999280	Okay, they don't want to work
8999280	9001280	Maybe I loaded it in wrong
9001280	9003280	What if I load this as a model
9004280	9006280	No, that wouldn't make any sense
9006280	9008280	Did I put this on the wrong folder?
9012280	9014280	Oh, if you haven't noticed, it's the end of the ASMR
9030280	9032280	Demos
9033280	9037280	I can have Drake or no regrets
9037280	9039280	tattooed on me
9040280	9042280	So I can't figure out how to do it
9045280	9047280	Customize
9048280	9051280	Kevin makes such great assets
9059280	9061280	I wish I would
9063280	9065280	It's like not showing, whatever I give up
9065280	9068280	But you get the idea, you get the meme, you get the joke
9070280	9073280	Property of Madame Sheevee in my bag
9074280	9076280	Yeah, it was better, it was better
9077280	9080280	I would give you a tramp stamp that says
9080280	9082280	Omega
9082280	9084280	And I'll get one on my front
9085280	9087280	Where a boom tattoo that says Alpha
9088280	9090280	Never mind
9090280	9092280	I'm on YouTube
9100280	9103280	Did you guys like the ASMR?
9105280	9107280	Did you like it?
9107280	9109280	Did you like the ASMR?
9110280	9112280	Did you like my AC ambiance?
9113280	9115280	Did you like my outfit?
9126280	9128280	I realize I'm very thick
9129280	9132280	No, ignore that my outfit is over my normal outfit
9134280	9136280	What happens if I
9155280	9158280	Let me just go back down
9159280	9161280	No
9165280	9167280	I like that my neck stayed in place
9170280	9172280	That's because
9172280	9175280	I usually load in my head as a model
9175280	9177280	But this time
9178280	9180280	I just
9181280	9185280	Loaded in my normal self and just made my top transparent
9189280	9191280	I
9196280	9198280	Normally
9200280	9203280	I just do this and I slap that on
9208280	9210280	Hey look, it's me and the
9210280	9212280	It's me and Bethany
9212280	9214280	Hello
9214280	9216280	Hi
9216280	9220280	She looks like a little parrot I can put on my shoulders
9221280	9223280	Shebethany?
9224280	9226280	Sorry, I threw Shebethany away
9232280	9235280	Erm, what's the shibbity?
9235280	9237280	Erm, what's the shibbity?
9237280	9240280	The actual shibbity? Is that Bethany?
9240280	9242280	Shibbity
9247280	9251280	Oh, I still haven't finished my immortal now that I think of it
9251280	9256280	We have to finish it, we have the last, like, I think, 15 chapters to do
9256280	9262280	And then Shebethany will disappear into the ether until I find another fanfiction
9263280	9265280	I have to go pack
9271280	9274280	I'm glad you guys liked ASMR
9277280	9281280	The fanfic? No, Twilight's not a fanfic, that's a book
9289280	9292280	But yes, I'm glad you guys enjoyed
9293280	9297280	No, you're thinking of Fifty Shades, love, you're thinking of Fifty Shades
9307280	9311280	Ugh, I guess I'll be all dick, okay, so I gotta go
9312280	9315280	I gotta go pack and I have to go call my mom
9320280	9323280	This is the part where I leave you guys
9323280	9325280	Oh, this is hard
9328280	9331280	I'm not gonna, hold on, let me switch to my normal mic
9331280	9333280	Let me switch
9336280	9338280	Okay
9362280	9364280	Hi
9367280	9369280	Sorry
9372280	9374280	Is it too loud?
9382280	9384280	Is it too loud?
9385280	9388280	Okay, I was like, I haven't changed anything
9391280	9395280	Yeah, it's louder because it's my normal mic
9396280	9399280	I shouldn't have done that mic warning, I'm sorry
9405280	9409280	I just turned this off, why is it still going?
9409280	9411280	I don't know how this still picks up
9414280	9418280	I turned the power off and OBS still picks it up
9419280	9423280	So yeah, so I'll be gone, I don't know why I'm like tilted
9423280	9425280	Why am I tilted?
9427280	9432280	You spin me right around, baby, right around
9432280	9435280	Like a good baby, right around, round, round
9450280	9452280	But
9453280	9456280	So yeah, I'll be gone for a little bit
9459280	9463280	Hope you don't miss me too much, because I know I'll miss you guys a lot
9471280	9474280	It's gonna be really hard to be gone
9474280	9477280	Again, I'm gonna try to be super active on socials
9477280	9479280	And
9482280	9485280	I'm really bummed out right now
9486280	9490280	Because you guys know I wanted to stream for you all the time
9490280	9494280	It's hard not to be there
9502280	9506280	My tears don't fall down my face anymore, I don't know why they broke
9512280	9514280	But I love you guys a lot
9514280	9522280	You know that it's gonna be super hard for me to be away from you
9522280	9525280	And I never can ever do
9525280	9528280	Oh yeah, people, it's been a month, it's been a month
9528280	9531280	Guys, it's been a month for members
9532280	9538280	Take care of yourselves, I'm leaving
9538280	9540280	I'm leaving the girls in charge
9540280	9542280	So behave
9545280	9548280	I was about to read Dono's, but thank you for yelling at me
9550280	9552280	I'm just saying, just saying
9552280	9554280	I don't miss you guys
9555280	9558280	Yeah, I can't believe it's already been a month
9558280	9561280	Wait, 20 more subs until 10k, you're joking
9562280	9565280	Sorry, I'm shrinking because I'm trying to look at my sub count
9565280	9567280	I can't even find it
9567280	9569280	It doesn't matter
9571280	9578280	But I can't believe we already achieved these numbers in such a short amount of time
9578280	9583280	As you guys know, it was my goal and my debut to hit 10k
9583280	9585280	And we're so close
9585280	9587280	And I just want to say thank you
9587280	9589280	You guys are wonderful
9589280	9592280	Thank you for renewing your memberships for the next month
9592280	9597280	I'm happy that I'm worthy enough for you to still give me your money and support me
9599280	9601280	But...
9602280	9604280	Yeah, I just...
9606280	9608280	A bit loud, turn down your damn headphones, bro
9608280	9611280	I switched them out from my 3D oh my
9611280	9614280	I literally just have no words besides
9614280	9619280	I just have the feeling of thankfulness and gratefulness and affection
9620280	9622280	It's crazy
9623280	9625280	Congrats on nearly getting 10k, thank you
9626280	9629280	But yeah, thank you members for renewing
9632280	9634280	I can't wait to come back
9634280	9636280	And...
9637280	9642280	I can't wait to come back and do a fun member stream for you guys
9642280	9645280	I think, yeah, we're gonna watch Salt Burn together
9646280	9649280	I was gonna do a karaoke, but I technically already did a karaoke
9649280	9654280	And that's up on the channel, so I'm like, I'll plan something a little bit better next time
9654280	9657280	Instead of that weird spare of the moment thing
9661280	9663280	Yeah, I'll miss you guys
9666280	9670280	Yes, the armpit pic for 10k is still the reward
9670280	9673280	I have it on standby, ready to be released into the ether
9673280	9676280	That is my alt account
9682280	9684280	Oh my goodness
9685280	9687280	Let me look at the doughnose
9696280	9698280	Oh my god
9712280	9716280	Alright, thank you for the $50 tip Ms. Morgan
9716280	9719280	The stream has meant more to me than I can properly describe
9719280	9723280	Being trans, I've often mourned the childhood I never got to have
9723280	9727280	This has let me experience a part of that childhood that I never thought I'd get to have
9727280	9729280	Thank you big sis, anytime
9729280	9736280	It's like, I'm an only child, so I never had anybody teach me to do makeup or do makeup on me
9736280	9739280	So I kind of wanted to share that moment with you
9739280	9743280	We both have an experience that we really never had before
9743280	9747280	I'm happy you enjoyed it, thank you so much for your support
9748280	9752280	Yeah, I know when you grow up a certain way
9752280	9757280	And you realize you don't have the same experiences that the average person may have
9757280	9763280	It's very bitter, but then it's better sweet because then you can always experience what's down the line
9763280	9766280	It takes a little bit more time, but you get there
9768280	9770280	Alright
9770280	9773280	Let me see, is there anything else?
9773280	9775280	Nope, I think that was it
9776280	9779280	And $5 from a super chat, let me see where that went
9779280	9781280	Where'd that super chat go?
9782280	9785280	What are you, thank you Falling Floor
9785280	9787280	What are you doing step sister?
9790280	9794280	I'm putting makeup on ya, so I'll make you my bitch
9799280	9801280	Did your mom not teach you?
9801280	9803280	No, not really
9803280	9805280	My mom didn't want me to wear makeup
9805280	9807280	I taught myself how to do makeup
9807280	9811280	And again, makeup that my mom does is a lot different from the makeup that I did
9811280	9815280	If you look through the years about how makeup has changed in the last few decades
9815280	9817280	It's very significant, not really significant
9817280	9820280	My mom just throw blue eyeshadow over her eyes in mascara
9823280	9825280	What am I going to do in the evenings while you're gone?
9825280	9830280	You can study your Bible, but you just can't finish the verse, that's what you can do
9831280	9835280	I won't have Shebe to keep me company at work for the next week
9835280	9837280	I know, and I won't have you
9837280	9838280	What the fuck?
9838280	9841280	Oh, it's me because I'm bouncing my leg because I'm anxious
9841280	9844280	Because I don't want to leave, I don't want to end the stream
9845280	9848280	Shebe's going hard into the fentanyl
9848280	9851280	I honestly, I just wanted to do that because I just kind of wanted to pamper you
9851280	9857280	And men don't usually get that opportunity to be pampered and kind of taken care of
9857280	9862280	And I can tell that a lot of you took a lot from this, from the skincare portion
9862280	9866280	And honestly, in my opinion, I think men should be able to wear makeup
9866280	9870280	Not in a huge way how women wear it
9870280	9875280	But you should be able to wear makeup in terms of like, oh, maybe you want to contour your jaw
9875280	9879280	Or maybe you want to conceal some zits
9879280	9882280	I feel like that should be more normalized
9882280	9885280	I thought I was a cat, no, it's me bouncing my leg
9885280	9890280	But yeah, I just wanted to pamper you and remind you that you're loved and I care for you
9890280	9894280	And then I'll brush your hair, I'll make your skin nice
9894280	9897280	And I'll do your makeup and I'll give you kisses
9901280	9903280	200 plus people quite a lot of people don't really brush your hair
9905280	9912280	I just, like for me personally, I'm a very, whoa
9913280	9918280	I got really confused because I thought that was USD
9918280	9920280	And I was gonna piss myself
9922280	9925280	Thank you so much for the donovie for Supa
9925280	9928280	Wow, that's so kind of you
9930280	9933280	Yeah, I was literally like, what?
9933280	9937280	And I was gonna, I was literally, yeah, everybody else
9938280	9941280	I'm happy, I'm happy I'm not the only one
9942280	9946280	I have to, I don't know how much that is in USD
9948280	9950280	But thank you
9951280	9954280	If it was 100K or otherwise
9959280	9961280	Yeah, $6, yes
9961280	9963280	What, what is that from?
9963280	9965280	I don't know, what, um
9968280	9970280	What is that from?
9970280	9972280	Indonesia, oh, okay, got you, got you
9974280	9978280	Now a rich chatter should drop to 100K for the bit
9978280	9981280	I don't, I don't think I have anybody like that watching me
9983280	9985280	I don't, I don't think so
9987280	9994280	But just some random Arabian prince is like, yes, I like, I like this bunny
9995280	9996280	Here you are
10001280	10005280	Bill Gates, just like Tim Cook, just here you go
10006280	10009280	The one oil baron, his biding his time
10009280	10013280	Waiting for my birthday, Jonathan to occur

10025280	10028280	No, for you guys are fine, don't worry about that
10028280	10033280	Giving, giving me money wouldn't, um, make me treat you any different

10036280	10039280	Um, quick, everybody find a lottery ticket
10041280	10044280	It's okay, I'm poor too, we can be poor together
10044280	10045280	Yep
10046280	10048280	Um, what was I gonna say?
10049280	10055280	But, uh, I just, a part of me is just really, doesn't want to leave
10055280	10059280	I really feel like you guys, and you can make fun of me, I don't care
10059280	10062280	But I feel like you guys are gonna leave me and be like, oh, she's gone for a week
10062280	10068280	Let me go find another oh she, um, let me go find another streamer
10068280	10076280	And you just never come back to me and you never, you never want to, you never want anything to do with me again
10077280	10080280	And that scares me, I guess I have a fear of abandonment
10081280	10085280	Um, and I know some of you guys do too, cause you guys are scared that I'm leaving
10085280	10095280	But just know that I'm also scared to be leaving cause I'm, I'm the same exact way that I'm bouncing my legs so hard
10095280	10101280	I need to calm down, um, I need to just like, I'm just like, let me just stim, let me just stim
10103280	10108280	I am, I am needy streamer, that is, that is indeed me
10111280	10121280	But, I have to remind myself and I look at your comments and I look at your, your sweet tweets at me
10121280	10130280	Um, and I just remind myself, no, that's not true, don't let the breadworm, the breadworms, the brainworms, win
10130280	10133280	They, they love me as much as I care for them
10133280	10137280	I remember, I was scrolling on Twitter and I saw a tweet
10137280	10140280	And it's one of those like, from one of those stupid accounts, a tweet romance stuff
10140280	10152280	But it said, I know a love like the one I want exists because I have that love within myself
10152280	10154280	And I want to give it to someone, something like that
10154280	10164280	And I think, I think that kind of just, it's you guys, like I know you guys give me the same energy back
10165280	10168280	You match my freak, so to speak
10170280	10175280	Um, so I'm just very thankful for you

10318280	10324280	When you have someone like me to put you in your place and make you beg and bark on your knees

10375280	10377280	I don't know how I feel about that
10378280	10379280	It's fine
10381280	10383280	Can you guess what this item is?
10387280	10390280	Mmm it smells interesting
10390280	10393280	Hold on there's like zip ties around it, I need scissors
10393280	10395280	Do I have a knife over here?
10395280	10398280	I swear to God I thought I had a knife over here
10398280	10403280	I might not be able to do $10,000 but I could do $10, you're fine
10403280	10405280	Thank you for your first soup, you're so sweet
10406280	10410280	You take, yeah my mom will be watching over my cats

10448280	10449280	Alright
10450280	10458280	How am I gonna use this? This isn't, I feel like I'm gonna hurt myself with it
10460280	10466280	Like what do I do with this? I should have never accepted this gift
10467280	10471280	I already hit all my toys, the shoes finally came in today
10472280	10474280	It's not shabari, can you hear it?
10474280	10479280	Be careful with the whip, that's right it's a whip
10480280	10485280	Can I, oh, can you hear that?
10494280	10495280	Can you hear it?
10496280	10500280	Can you hear the whip? This thing is so big, I have a giant ass whip
10505280	10506280	Oh
10516280	10520280	It is a four or five foot long bull whip?
10521280	10531280	Um, yeah, no, I'm good, don't worry, I'm not, I'm not doing anything
10532280	10535280	But yeah, I have a whip now, I feel like fucking catwoman
10536280	10539280	I wanna do a catwoman cosplay, Michelle Pfeiffer style
10540280	10543280	I can just twirl this around me like a motherfucker
10544280	10549280	Oh, thank you so much for the soupa
10551280	10553280	I thought that was $500,000
10556280	10561280	That just keeps freaking me out, cause I like, I pause and I'm like, okay, wait, no, I'm fine
10563280	10567280	I was just like, uh, that was just terrified me
10568280	10573280	I would have been like, please, please don't give me that much money
10574280	10576280	Thank you, thank you so much of you
10590280	10593280	So kind, I just hit my hands on my microphone
10593280	10596280	But yeah, I got a whip now, I don't know where I'm gonna put this
10597280	10599280	Where do I put this big ass whip?
10599280	10600280	Boomi, you want it?
10602280	10603280	Take a little sniff
10604280	10605280	Boomi's sniffing
10609280	10612280	Oh my god, I hope my mom doesn't fight into this big ass whip
10619280	10620280	I don't know
10623280	10625280	I think soupas can only go to $500
10627280	10634280	Keep in mind, if you do a soupa, most of it, most, most of it, I'm suddenly Australian, um, most
10636280	10640280	It'll go to YouTube, so Streamlabs is the best way to go
10645280	10648280	Say it's for horseback riding and rodeo lessons
10648280	10651280	No, my parents know what I do for a living, guys
10651280	10655280	They know what I do, they know that I'm a lewd voice actress
10663280	10666280	No way, you're just telling me that now, I thought that's usually, I thought that was common knowledge
10668280	10672280	Do you like the whip, madam? Please be careful, the cats, don't you want it? Yes I do
10673280	10676280	Yes I do, thank you Taft Potential, I do like it a lot
10676280	10683280	Wait, I can't even see, if anybody did don't know normally, I can't even see Streamlabs because I don't have it open
10689280	10690280	Yeah
10695280	10696280	Yippee
10700280	10701280	YouTube takes 30%
10702280	10704280	Cat toy, cat toy, do it
10704280	10706280	What do you think, Reyna? What do you think about this?
10707280	10710280	Ooh, Reyna's excited, Reyna wants to play with the whip
10712280	10717280	Ooh, you like that Reyna? She's like, she's like trying to grab it with her paw
10719280	10722280	I don't know if you could hear her, she's on like the plastic bag it came in
10723280	10727280	No, Reyna let it go, Reyna let it go, I have to clip their claws after this
10727280	10730280	Reyna let go, I shouldn't have taught you to play with that
10730280	10735280	Alright, I wonder what this would feel like to hit someone with a bend over
10735280	10739280	Okay, where do I put this? Where do I hide with it? I don't know where to hide with it
10761280	10765280	Okay, I think I hid it
10766280	10770280	I shoved it in a place in my closet, I hope my mom doesn't notice
10777280	10781280	Oh, I don't want to leave, I don't want to leave, I don't want to leave, I just want to be with you
10784280	10785280	But I have to go pack
10786280	10788280	I'm 10K? Are you 10K?
10790280	10793280	No way, we hit 10K
10802280	10806280	Oh my god, it's okay, we're gonna get called, but we hit 10K
10808280	10812280	Holy shit, we hit 10K
10812280	10815280	Oh my god
10816280	10820280	I can't believe we hit 10K live on stream, that's insane
10820280	10823280	How did my thing go up to me?
10825280	10826280	What the heck?
10828280	10830280	10K, let's go!
10831280	10834280	There's 10K harlots that love me
10836280	10841280	Oh, I'm so proud of us, again, it's 10K of you
10841280	10845280	You did this, you wonderful harlots, you...
10847280	10849280	Now you get an armpit picture
10850280	10852280	Are you happy? You get to see my armpit
10857280	10859280	You get to see my armpit
10860280	10862280	Armpit, armpit
10867280	10871280	Okay, I made a promise that if we hit 10K, which I didn't think would be this soon
10872280	10877280	I'd post a picture of my armpit mole, because I have an armpit beauty mark
10883280	10886280	If you're new here, by the way, I'm brown
10887280	10892280	So my armpit will not be a beautiful alabaster porcelain white
10892280	10894280	I am a brown girl, I am tan
10895280	10898280	So you'll get a nice tan pit
10902280	10906280	Armpits are like the five hot as well, as you're not really getting my armpit
10906280	10908280	Like it was just the mole, I said
10908280	10911280	I'm kind of shy to show you guys my armpit
10911280	10916280	Because armpits are not as pretty as they are drawn
10916280	10919280	I do not have a vagina looking armpit
10926280	10928280	All armpits are beautiful
10930280	10940280	Because like, you know how they draw them looking like succulent, wet, smooth as a fucking slug
10942280	10946280	Like, I almost had a turtle for some reason
10949280	10953280	Guys, I shave my armpits, I have like little hair stubble
10955280	10959280	And when you're brown, your pits are more melanated
10961280	10963280	So I got some melanated pits
10966280	10969280	I think in the picture you also get a little bit of my hair
10969280	10976280	But again, I only reveal, I don't normally, like, I'm a VTuber first and foremost, everyone
10976280	10982280	I only do like hand cams and thigh cams, foot cams, what have you
10984280	10990280	And like little cosplays that show off my RTX form
10990280	10995280	Only for milestones, it is not on a daily basis, by the way
10995280	11003280	I'm not a flush tuber, I'm not, as they say, a twitch thought that's come to ruin VTuber
11003280	11009280	That is not me, I only do it because I like to give you guys little treats and you ask for it
11009280	11015280	So, yeah, you're never seeing my face, I am sheebie
11015280	11023280	Soon enough, my tanness will reflect it in my 2D form, my true form if you will
11024280	11028280	So, yeah, 100k, we get the other pit, well, wouldn't it be 20k?
11028280	11034280	20k, I don't have anything on my other pit though, so, I don't know
11037280	11038280	My emotes
11040280	11042280	Yeah, I know, I need to figure that out
11044280	11050280	When we get eyeball pics, you'll never get an eyeball pic because that is a part of my face
11050280	11051280	I'm sorry
11057280	11059280	What was the next milestone?
11060280	11063280	I'll probably say, I don't know
11066280	11069280	Yay, new members, neck reveal, guys, I'm not
11071280	11078280	You're never seeing my eyes, you're never seeing my mouth, you're never seeing my ear
11081280	11085280	Next milestone, 100k
11089280	11093280	Neck reveal is wild, it will just be just brown skin
11093280	11101280	Oh, thank you, LGF, thank you for the 50 gifted
11101280	11107280	Absolutely insane, amazing way to celebrate getting 10k
11108280	11112280	Okay, I'll say it, I guess you are my little pog champ
11117280	11119280	Okay, like, brown woman she means
11126280	11131280	Everybody's like, yay, more, more gifted
11131280	11133280	Thank you so much
11133280	11134280	LGF
11137280	11140280	I feel so bad for my lurkers that like, post because they're like, did I win?
11140280	11148280	And then, but the gotcha, the gotcha did not grant them what they wanted
11154280	11156280	I'm just here long for the ride
11157280	11159280	One the gotcha
11170280	11174280	Remember, if you guys want to, yeah, it's 50, it's going to take a bit
11174280	11182280	If you guys still want to, if you want to watch Salt Burn with me
11182280	11187280	When we do the watch along, when I come back, you can always upgrade to the member tier
11187280	11190280	Because this is just emotes, and you have to be
11190280	11198280	Hell yeah, Castle Hellford, a dollar, thank you, so sweet
11198280	11203280	I'll heart that for you, what a sweet little castle
11213280	11217280	I can do a lot with one doll, I can buy myself some candy
11217280	11220280	I can get myself an espresso shot, probably not
11224280	11229280	Looking forward to the bathtub seat and salt, me too, me too
11231280	11236280	If you haven't seen Salt Burn, do not look anything up, that is an order
11237280	11241280	You're so beautiful and gorgeous, oh thank you, oh stop it
11241280	11244280	You're going to make me blush, oh goodness
11250280	11255280	Good, good, good, you better be scared, you better be scared
11257280	11263280	No spoilers, no spoilers
11264280	11267280	I'm debating whether or not to fart in the mic
11269280	11272280	A little cheeky brat for 10k
11274280	11277280	Are you going to watch the boys finale, oh shit
11277280	11281280	Oh no, I won't be able to watch the boys finale
11283280	11286280	Oh wait, no, I don't leave till the late
11287280	11291280	I don't leave till the, I'm not going to say when
11293280	11299280	Nobody charge my flight please, I should, maybe if I can
11300280	11304280	Watch it on the flight, oh that's true, I can watch it on the flight
11304280	11306280	Yeah I'll do, well no, I'll just be screaming the entire time
11306280	11310280	What if somebody gets like, is like some really gory shit
11310280	11313280	Or like sexual shit is happening in the finale
11313280	11316280	And I'm just sitting there watching it with some poor normal person
11316280	11318280	A sweet little lady looking over to my iPad
11318280	11321280	And somebody's getting like finger bangs
11322280	11323280	Or whatever
11330280	11336280	Wait, wait, are you a, are you a, are you a, a role player?
11336280	11339280	I think role player chatters are some of my favorite chatters
11339280	11342280	Okay the person who proposed role plays this Friday
11342280	11344280	Now I got some of the role plays of Sans
11344280	11346280	Now I can just follow
11348280	11350280	That's how I'll read your comments from now on
11352280	11354280	Sitting next to a nun
11354280	11356280	I'm sitting next to a nun and we're doing it
11356280	11358280	On the plane in front of everyone
11371280	11373280	I can't go that deep
11373280	11377280	Mile Halakai Club with the sweet old nun that'll be sitting next to me
11378280	11382280	I saw an old guy watching straight up corn on his phone in an aisle seat
11382280	11384280	Geez
11384280	11386280	Oh my god
11386280	11388280	I, I forget where I'm sitting on the right
11388280	11392280	All I know is that my plane ride back is gonna be shitty
11392280	11395280	Because I'm in the middle of my plane ride back
11395280	11398280	On my plane ride there, I'm in the window
11398280	11400280	To the walls
11402280	11406280	I thought it was a mistake to eat snacks while watching the web viewer tech night episode
11408280	11410280	Oh that was fun
11411280	11413280	Yes it is, I should be Undertale
11413280	11416280	I wanted to play Undertale at one point because I think the voice acting would be fun
11416280	11423280	But I would not want to play the whole game
11423280	11425280	And it's really hard to get through
11425280	11428280	Because I would just want to do Papyrus' voice
11428280	11430280	Make him sound like Skeletor like everybody else does
11432280	11434280	You've solved my puzzle
11437280	11440280	You're still on season 3? Hurry up
11446280	11448280	By the power of puzzles
11451280	11454280	Wonderland's dungeon has definitely funded my tech night with all the equipment
11454280	11457280	You think I'm funded by a man who runs prisons
11457280	11460280	And is a little white nationalist
11460280	11466280	It's rage inducing
11466280	11468280	I never thought it was rage inducing
11476280	11478280	Great comment, thank you
11479280	11484280	Literally my OG name before I got the daddy sign on Bob in it from Bob from Temmie
11484280	11490280	I still, I know I'm mentally ill because sometimes I'll just go
11490280	11492280	Hi I'm Temmie, just like randomly
11493280	11496280	Hi, hi I'm Temmie
11496280	11498280	Hi, I'm Temmie
11500280	11502280	I just do that
11502280	11504280	I just do that, normally
11507280	11509280	Hi, I'm Chibi
11515280	11518280	I'm literally I'm Sans and I'm Temmie
11518280	11520280	Hi, I'm Temmie
11520280	11522280	Temmie Flakes
11522280	11524280	Temmie Flakes
11526280	11528280	Hoives
11528280	11531280	And her thoughts just working out whenever they feel like it
11531280	11534280	Because sometimes I'm the type of person where if I see like a word
11534280	11536280	And it reminds me of like a quote
11536280	11538280	I'm gonna say the quote out loud
11539280	11542280	And I'm just impulsive like that
11542280	11544280	I'm glad I'm not the only one from what the chat is saying
11547280	11551280	My undyne impression will just sound like a really hot tomboy
11552280	11555280	And then like my alphys impression will be like
11556280	11558280	Hi Undyne
11558280	11562280	I was wondering if you want to go back to my laboratory and watch anime
11563280	11565280	Well I don't know, should we alphys?
11565280	11567280	I gotta kill these guys over here
11569280	11571280	Something like that, I don't know
11573280	11574280	Um
11580280	11583280	Sometimes when I think of a move in a word I just automatically start doing it
11583280	11584280	Yeah, same
11584280	11586280	We love the gay fish
11588280	11590280	That's the voice you gave Dusa, you're right
11590280	11592280	I did give Dusa that voice
11593280	11595280	Can we get a so sorry impression?
11595280	11597280	I don't know what that references to
11597280	11600280	Is that a character within Undertale?
11602280	11605280	I played Deltarune as well
11605280	11607280	And I loved, I really like Deltarune
11607280	11612280	I have to fin, I think they, did they finish the like newer episodes of Deltarune?
11612280	11613280	I don't know
11613280	11615280	And he put my 3D away, it's like in my face
11615280	11617280	I can barely see the screen
11618280	11620280	State fast, rip fast
11620280	11622280	I can't stay there
11623280	11625280	Toriel British
11625280	11627280	Does everybody make Toriel British?
11627280	11629280	I probably would then
11630280	11634280	Um, I baked you a butterscotch cake
11634280	11635280	Cake?
11635280	11638280	I baked you, I baked you a butterscotch pie
11638280	11640280	I hope you think it would be really delightful
11641280	11643280	I worked really hard on it, you know
11643280	11646280	Um, I think you belong here, just fine
11650280	11652280	Chapter 2's out, okay
11652280	11654280	I never, I didn't read, I didn't read
11654280	11656280	I didn't do Chapter 2 then
11657280	11659280	Great CC voice
11659280	11660280	Has the Brit not bad
11660280	11662280	You should go see, I think I retweeted it
11662280	11665280	It's not an actual short, but I kind of want to upload it as an actual short
11665280	11667280	And give credit to the person who made it
11667280	11669280	I did a whole British bit
11669280	11670280	Um, with my Goexla
11670280	11672280	I can do a British accent very well
11672280	11676280	Cause I really like period, um, TV shows and films
11677280	11680280	And I would just watch British stuff with my mom all the time
11680280	11683280	Um, I also used to watch a lot of Love Island, so
11684280	11686280	Butterscotch cinnamon pie, it was good
11687280	11691280	I remember one of the characters in the game, Sundar Plain and Sundare
11692280	11695280	That's right, yeah, the one that like kind of like blushes at you
11695280	11699280	And she's like, I love that the characters in that game are just great
11700280	11702280	British Papa
11702280	11704280	Can you do a British chop though?
11706280	11711280	I can't really do, like, particular
11713280	11717280	Uh, what's it called? Regional accents that well?
11719280	11723280	It's like, I can be either really posh or really Londoner
11724280	11726280	Like, oh, bro, you want a tussle, yeah?
11726280	11729280	Well, you know, I see a fit bird out there
11729280	11732280	And I said, you know, I'm a bagger, I'm a pull this fit bird
11732280	11734280	And then you swooped in, bro
11734280	11736280	And you just took a rifle under me
11736280	11739280	And I fucking hate you for that, you're fucking bloody wanker for that
11739280	11740280	That's all I'm gonna say, bro
11740280	11742280	That's all I'm gonna say
11744280	11747280	Went Scottish there, I did, sometimes I'll go Scottish
11748280	11751280	The way I go Scottish is I'll either say
11752280	11756280	If you had the chance to change your fate, would ya?
11756280	11759280	Or what are you doing in my swamp?
11759280	11762280	Or I'll say, um, reeflings
11764280	11766280	I just channel scrawny
11767280	11769280	Yeah, I just sound like a roadman, yeah
11769280	11770280	Yeah
11773280	11775280	Okay, what did you say?
11780280	11782280	Am I being hit on by, uh
11784280	11785280	Skull in forever
11787280	11790280	I can't do, would ya know
11790280	11793280	I can't do a Australian accent, though
11793280	11796280	I can't really do it, no, oh, no
11796280	11799280	I need to like listen to Aimee more
11799280	11803280	Absolutely, sometimes like during our Left 4 Dead 2 collab
11803280	11805280	With Aimee and Reia in Azura
11805280	11807280	I literally just sat there and I would be quiet
11807280	11810280	Because I wanted to listen to Aimee talk so I could emulate her voice
11811280	11814280	One time recently I was in the shower
11814280	11818280	And I was listening to, uh, I think like a Neander's clip
11818280	11822280	And I would just, I would, I'm a freak, guys
11822280	11825280	I was just sitting, standing in the shower, brushing out my hair
11825280	11826280	You know, doing what I'm doing
11826280	11828280	And then Neander's would say something
11828280	11831280	And I just would try to say in the same exact voice
11838280	11840280	Uh, hi everyone
11840280	11841280	Hi, hi
11841280	11845280	I, um, I can't, she like kinda goes to the front of it
11845280	11847280	And it's kind of in the back of it
11847280	11849280	I can't even do it right now
11850280	11852280	And I've tried to do like Shia Lily's voice
11863280	11866280	Shimi, I don't really want you to leave, but no, you need to go pack, fuck, you're right
11870280	11872280	Listen to laser beam for this truly an accident
11873280	11876280	Come on, come on, yeah
11876280	11879280	I need to, I'm trying to work on it
11879280	11882280	Yeah, I just really want to be able to voice act and do cool impressions
11882280	11885280	Like fuckin' Elizabeth Bloodflame
11887280	11890280	Uh, I really, if I listen to, if you give me a voice
11890280	11893280	Like I figured out I can do Kiara's voice
11893280	11895280	And I can do Mori Kaliope's voice
11895280	11897280	So that's interesting
11898280	11900280	Now you're not free, you're just dedicated to VA
11900280	11902280	Also I knew a girl who stayed out two hours in the shower
11902280	11904280	Cause she has a bathtub markers to meet art in the shower
11904280	11906280	That's actually kinda cool
11906280	11908280	I didn't know that was a thing
11914280	11918280	Yeah, she's a fucking god for that
11920280	11923280	Um, for her, for her impressions
11924280	11927280	Uh, yeah, I was trying to do, like I was trying to figure out how to do
11927280	11931280	I think I can do Doki Bird's voice too
11931280	11934280	I realized one time when I was watching her a lot
11934280	11938280	Uh, and one of my streams, this is one of my, my appeal
11938280	11941280	I realized I was accidentally talking like her
11941280	11945280	Because I just, I have echolalia, so like when I listen to something
11945280	11948280	Enough, I just start to mimic it and replicate it
11948280	11951280	And I was like doing her laugh
11951280	11955280	And I was like, I can't do it right now
11955280	11957280	I don't have the laugh down
11957280	11961280	Again, I have to listen to a voice and repeat it constantly
11961280	11966280	And I don't, I don't listen to the VTubers enough
11966280	11969280	That I want to learn imitations of, that I can just do it on command
11969280	11972280	I literally have to listen to a voice clip and then I can get into it
11973280	11975280	I could probably do Kobo's voice, actually
11975280	11977280	I'm not gonna, cause I can go that high
11977280	11983280	Like I can do, I can do Fuwawa Mokoko
11983280	11987280	Cause I can go that high
11987280	11991280	I, I realized I can do higher voices better than I can do lower voices
11991280	11995280	Which doesn't make any sense, cause my voice is naturally in a lower register
11995280	11997280	So I don't, I don't get that
11999280	12000280	Why?
12000280	12002280	I literally made a friend crap himself
12002280	12005280	I dressed up as a slender man and then he was, what?
12007280	12009280	Off topic, but okay
12010280	12012280	It's a lack of an Adam's apple
12018280	12021280	Yes, I 100% have more control of my head voice in Volsetto
12021280	12023280	Yes, I definitely do
12038280	12043280	Cause they're like, they, like, so there's a lot of VTubers that are like, breathe out a lot when they're talking
12043280	12048280	They go, like I noticed when I was trying to mimic Neanna's voice
12048280	12052280	She talks out and she breathes out like this
12052280	12059280	And when she, she gets a little bit high cause she has a naturally soft and higher voice
12059280	12061280	But I can't, but she like, breathes out
12062280	12065280	At least you don't practice your belting
12065280	12067280	Yeah, I don't think my neighbors would like that
12070280	12077280	Sounds like a mix of mocha kawawa, yeah, right, cause I need to listen to them to really like, again, to be able to do it
12079280	12083280	And like, and Shy Lily's is in the back of the throat
12084280	12086280	Hi, I can't, I can't even fucking do it
12086280	12091280	I like how she speaks like that, that's me, I know, right?
12091280	12096280	I love, VTubers have such interesting voices because a lot of them are voice actors themselves
12096280	12101280	And, you know, they became popular because they have very distinct, unique voices
12101280	12106280	For example, Doki Bird has such a distinct and unique laugh and that's just something
12106280	12111280	One of the things that made her so lovable was her such, she has such a cute laugh
12112280	12120280	And so it's so fun to mimic VTubers voices because they're all so very different and like, very unique
12120280	12129280	Me, I just, I kind of, again, I've gotten compared to like, like a deeper Maury, Calliope before
12131280	12136280	And like some other VTubers because I speak in a kind of a deeper register
12137280	12141280	Got a Master of Gen Maids, I can do Icy
12142280	12147280	Hi everybody, it's Icy Snowpaws
12147280	12153280	Today we're going to be doing some Guild Wars
12154280	12156280	I love my Dadas
12156280	12173280	My Icy is good, she has a little bit of vibration and then you just have to do some like a European accent
12174280	12188280	Um, and I don't know if I can do Amy's voice
12188280	12192280	I have to listen to Amy's voice to do it
12192280	12196280	I'm trying to think of like, I'm trying to repeat her voice in my head right now
12197280	12200280	I can go as high as Amy
12200280	12204280	And then I can be a Zara Dule
12204280	12210280	I'm working on a Zara's voice because she has a breathy voice
12210280	12214280	But I can't seem to get her Lisp down because she has a Lisp, but I don't notice it
12214280	12220280	And then Zara was just like, no, I do have a Lisp, I'm like, I don't pick up on it, so I can't do that
12220280	12228280	Um, it's a decent, I mean, yeah, no, I can 100% get Amy's voice
12228280	12231280	I will just need to practice
12231280	12235280	Um, Skinwalker skills
12235280	12240280	Is Vela actually, no, actually we're all strongies personas
12240280	12242280	I'm strongy
12242280	12246280	Are you fucking kidding me right now?
12246280	12251280	I can't even, she has a little bit
12251280	12257280	So, so, so, so I was wondering if, no, I have to listen to her voice
12257280	12260280	Are you squiddin' me right now?
12260280	12262280	Are you squiddin' me right now?
12262280	12265280	Yeah, that sounded like I see, it's because I still have Icy's voice in my head
12268280	12271280	Yeah, I'm trying to get Mercy's laugh down
12272280	12274280	I can't even do it
12274280	12283280	So, so, so, so, I have to like, I don't even, because Mercy's voice is similar to mine in terms of like
12285280	12288280	She's like a little bit higher than mine
12290280	12292280	Yeah, Mercy's laugh is in the chest
12301280	12306280	Yeah
12310280	12313280	What took you so long to come back, granddaughter?
12315280	12317280	Bye, thank you
12318280	12320280	Mercy's fill-
12320280	12322280	Yeah
12328280	12333280	Imagine a whole VTuber company that's just in person with multiple personas
12333280	12340280	I am, I think there's actually a company that's a VTuber like that
12340280	12349280	I know like, Alias has her two little like ghosty friends that she does voices for, which is very impressive
12349280	12353280	And then I believe that Clotho, who just debuted in
12358280	12362280	Mythos is actually technically playing three people
12364280	12366280	So it's pretty cool
12367280	12369280	Collabs would be tricky
12373280	12376280	I think there's a running joint, the floor, because everybody in his closet
12376280	12378280	That is funny
12379280	12381280	Oh
12385280	12389280	I'll leave in three minutes, I'll leave in three minutes, let me find someone to read
12392280	12394280	Oh, Strony is playing, yeah, I'll read Strony
12395280	12403280	She's playing supermarket simulator, I hope she isn't fucking hiking up her prices or something
12404280	12406280	I didn't know
12407280	12413280	Strony is very impressed with how far along my Scottish accent has come since I first spoke to her
12418280	12421280	Now because I since I talk to her more often
12423280	12428280	Well, my neck isn't quite on my body, hold on, let me lean back when I lean forward
12437280	12443280	Wait, is Strony not streaming? Was that, what the heck?
12448280	12450280	Am I tripping?
12451280	12455280	Was that just like an old thing? Was that old?
12457280	12460280	Strony rated me, you're right, I don't know why
12462280	12464280	I don't know why that just
12467280	12469280	What the hell?
12470280	12473280	It didn't reflect on my screen that she stopped streaming
12474280	12477280	I'm so, I'm tired, leave me alone, leave me alone
12478280	12481280	See, that's why I put that there, that's why I put that thing there
12484280	12486280	Oh wait, Phoenix, I didn't see that, $20 tip
12486280	12491280	Check her out, CB, not just on the 10k, but on all the other dreams that are and will be coming true
12491280	12494280	Oh, thank you, Phoenix
12495280	12497280	So kind, thank you so much
12498280	12502280	It's because I don't have the donor alerts on because I'm in my ASMR scene
