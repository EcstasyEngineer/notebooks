Hello.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.820
What?

06:10.820 --> 06:12.820
Is something the matter?

06:14.820 --> 06:16.820
What's wrong?

06:18.820 --> 06:20.820
What are you...

06:21.820 --> 06:24.820
Guys, what's the matter? Everybody's freaking out.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.820
Is something on my face?

06:31.820 --> 06:32.820
Weird.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.820
Anyways, how are you guys doing today?

06:41.820 --> 06:43.820
That boob has a head? What?

06:44.820 --> 06:47.820
What are you talking about? I'm looking at my model, I look fine.

06:48.820 --> 06:49.820
I don't know.

06:55.820 --> 06:56.820
Um...

06:59.820 --> 07:01.820
Did you remember to tweet?

07:02.820 --> 07:04.820
Yeah, I should do that.

07:09.820 --> 07:10.820
So no head.

07:12.820 --> 07:13.820
Smash his phone.

07:14.820 --> 07:15.820
Am I okay?

07:16.820 --> 07:17.820
I'm fine.

07:18.820 --> 07:19.820
I'm great.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.820
I'm having a great time.

07:21.820 --> 07:22.820
I'm dressed real cute.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.820
I'm wearing a t-shirt.

07:30.820 --> 07:34.820
And my t-shirt says it's Necko or it's Heckno.

07:35.820 --> 07:38.820
I bet if you google it you can see exactly what t-shirt I'm wearing.

07:40.820 --> 07:41.820
Strony raid.

07:41.820 --> 07:42.820
Ow!

07:43.820 --> 07:45.820
Ow no! Hello!

07:45.820 --> 07:46.820
Wait.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.820
Wait, you guys missed my bit.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.820
So, I was at... Do you guys um...

07:56.820 --> 07:59.820
I have a really important question for you.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.820
You guys want some head?

08:04.820 --> 08:06.820
Cause I got you.

08:12.820 --> 08:15.820
Yeah! Yeah, here it is.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.820
There's the head.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.820
Here's the head you ordered.

08:21.820 --> 08:23.820
Is this not what you wanted?

08:24.820 --> 08:26.820
See, this is my cover up for stream.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.820
What do you mean it's cursed?

08:31.820 --> 08:32.820
Mom!

08:33.820 --> 08:35.820
Mother, you don't love me.

08:35.820 --> 08:36.820
You did this to me.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.820
You bathed me from your loins.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.820
I'm stuck like this.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.820
You need bread when you have head, you know?

08:45.820 --> 08:46.820
Yeah.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.820
Can I add another head?

08:49.820 --> 08:51.820
Actually, can I?

08:53.820 --> 08:55.820
Can I add another head?

09:02.820 --> 09:03.820
Oh!

09:05.820 --> 09:07.820
I have to like get rid of the...

09:09.820 --> 09:11.820
My shadow for my stuff.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.820
We are...

09:16.820 --> 09:18.820
The madams 3.

09:18.820 --> 09:21.820
Would you like to have your way with me?

09:24.820 --> 09:26.820
Are you not entertained?

09:27.820 --> 09:29.820
Do you not want to get brain?

09:31.820 --> 09:33.820
Be not afraid.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.820
Be not afraid.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.820
I wish I had reverb so I could be like

09:40.820 --> 09:42.820
Be not afraid, my child.

09:42.820 --> 09:43.820
Wait, hold on.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.820
Wait, I think I do a reverb.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.820

Come forth, my child.

10:17.820 --> 10:19.820
I will not harm you.

10:25.820 --> 10:29.820
I care for you so, come into my warm embrace.

10:32.820 --> 10:36.820
Let me bring you into my frail against my bosom.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.820
Give me a kiss.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.820
I will not harm you.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.820
Wait, hold on.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.820
I have another idea.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.820

We interrupt this program to bring you

11:32.820 --> 11:34.820
three-headed sheebie.

11:37.820 --> 11:42.820
Please lock your doors if you see a three-headed sheebie.

11:44.820 --> 11:47.820
Do not look directly at the sheebie.

11:48.820 --> 11:51.820
If she has more, then three heads.

11:52.820 --> 11:53.820
Two is fine.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.820
Wait, hold on.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.820
I'm coming right at you!

12:16.820 --> 12:18.820
My neighbors are walking by.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.820
I thought you were a rabbit, not a hydra.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.820
Hell, hydra!

12:22.820 --> 12:24.820
Can I put it?

12:25.820 --> 12:27.820
Oh, oh, hold on.

12:27.820 --> 12:28.820
I need to make this smaller.

12:28.820 --> 12:29.820
No!

12:35.820 --> 12:36.820
Make this bigger.

12:36.820 --> 12:37.820
Oh, wait.

12:38.820 --> 12:39.820
Please hold.

12:39.820 --> 12:40.820

13:06.820 --> 13:08.820
And perfect.

13:12.820 --> 13:15.820
I got my cover up.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.820
All sorted.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.820
Do you guys like it?

13:22.820 --> 13:23.820
No?

13:25.820 --> 13:27.820
Is this distracting?

13:30.820 --> 13:32.820
Why is one bigger than the other?

13:33.820 --> 13:38.820
Breasts are like cousins more than sisters.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.820
Just like your eyebrows.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.820
Just like my eyes.

13:44.820 --> 13:45.820
My eyes.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.820
My eyes are down here.

13:48.820 --> 13:49.820
Okay.

13:49.820 --> 13:50.820
My eyes.

13:53.820 --> 13:55.820
Wait, it just toggles for all of them.

13:58.820 --> 13:59.820
Oh, god.

14:03.820 --> 14:04.820
What are you doing?

14:04.820 --> 14:05.820
I don't know what you're looking at.

14:06.820 --> 14:07.820
It will.

14:07.820 --> 14:08.820
Wait, wait.

14:08.820 --> 14:09.820
Hold on.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.820
Will this work?

14:19.820 --> 14:21.820
Be not afraid.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.820
I can't breathe.

14:38.820 --> 14:42.820
Be not afraid.

14:43.820 --> 14:47.820
Open your heart to me, Aaron.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.820
We will become one.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.820
A hive mind.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.820
Let me into your soul.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.820
Open the door.

15:00.820 --> 15:02.820
Open the door.

15:04.820 --> 15:05.820
Come on.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.820
Oh, let me in.

15:10.820 --> 15:11.820
Let me in.

15:13.820 --> 15:14.820
Let me in.

15:14.820 --> 15:15.820
Please.

15:15.820 --> 15:16.820
I won't hurt you.

15:16.820 --> 15:17.820
I swear.

15:18.820 --> 15:19.820
Please.

15:19.820 --> 15:20.820
Won't you?

15:20.820 --> 15:21.820
I'll be good.

15:21.820 --> 15:22.820
Please.

15:22.820 --> 15:23.820
Please.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.820
Okay, anyways.

15:43.820 --> 15:45.820
Well, what just happened?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.820
I think I blacked out for a moment.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.820
Let me go get a drink.

15:54.820 --> 15:55.820
I didn't grab a drink.

15:55.820 --> 15:57.820
Actually, I have some coffee next to me, but...

16:07.820 --> 16:09.820
Why don't you guys come over and do my dishes?

16:09.820 --> 16:10.820
Like...

16:13.820 --> 16:14.820
Please.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.820
I want to go home.

16:19.820 --> 16:21.820
I have money.

16:24.820 --> 16:26.820
Grab a slice of water.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.820
Oh, my cake.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.820
Is that a cat?

16:34.820 --> 16:37.820
A crazy, really chunky cat?

16:40.820 --> 16:42.820
I lost it for a bit?

16:42.820 --> 16:43.820
I don't know.

16:43.820 --> 16:45.820
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

16:46.820 --> 16:47.820
No?

16:47.820 --> 16:49.820
Do them yourself, girl.

16:49.820 --> 16:50.820
Come on.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.820
Strangle is first born child.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.820
Don't forget to tweet the stream has started.

16:55.820 --> 16:56.820
Oh.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.820
It's time for ADHD.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.820
What a count am I on?

17:06.820 --> 17:07.820
Jesus.

17:07.820 --> 17:08.820
Where am I?

17:12.820 --> 17:15.820
Well, I hope you guys had fun hanging out with Strani.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.820
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.820
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.820
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.

17:21.820 --> 17:23.820
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.

17:23.820 --> 17:25.820
Were you having a good time?

17:26.820 --> 17:29.820
I heard you got some treats.

17:29.820 --> 17:31.820
You got some candy.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.820
And some toes.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.820
Or something.

17:35.820 --> 17:36.820
Something about toes.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.820
Does she have like gummy toes?

17:46.820 --> 17:48.820
I am live.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.820
I thought you were dumb.

17:55.820 --> 17:57.820
Shut the fuck up.

18:01.820 --> 18:04.820
Stuff my stockings up your nose.

18:09.820 --> 18:11.820
Yeah, like she was having candy.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.820
There's nothing else on that stream, right?

18:15.820 --> 18:17.820
Does anyone hire a priest?

18:17.820 --> 18:18.820
I am a priest.

18:18.820 --> 18:20.820

38:43.920 --> 38:45.920
Great show, by the way.

38:48.920 --> 38:54.920
Let's see. Oh, there's different dominatrix.

38:56.920 --> 39:01.920
All right, like, I gotta pick that.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.920
I had, like...

39:14.920 --> 39:15.920
What?

39:16.920 --> 39:18.920
Ex-gymnastripper?

39:25.920 --> 39:26.920
What?

39:28.920 --> 39:30.920
It's a doom seer.

39:30.920 --> 39:35.920
Oh, she, I just have severe anxiety. Also me.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.920
Subtly insane. Also me.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.920
Occult nut. Also me. I could be deaf?

39:54.920 --> 39:59.920
Wait, if I'm deaf in the game, will I just not hear any dialogue?

40:01.920 --> 40:06.920
Gymnastripper? I know, it's like very specific.

40:06.920 --> 40:10.920
I was, like, I did do gymnastics for a little bit.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.920
But, like, I don't, and it was never a stripper.

40:17.920 --> 40:21.920
Although I do want to learn how to do pole for, like, 3D stuff.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.920
That'd be super cool. Long and little foot.

40:24.920 --> 40:29.920
Wait, I would just have one foot longer than the other?

40:29.920 --> 40:33.920
Are you fucking, why the fuck would I ever pick that?

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
Okay.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.920
But I like the crazy shit of a Malkavian.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.920
Completely bad shit.

40:48.920 --> 40:49.920
Okay.

40:49.920 --> 40:53.920
I'm probably, yeah, maybe Ventrue. We're gonna be...

40:55.920 --> 40:56.920
Oh.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.920
Why is it showing that?

41:02.920 --> 41:05.920

41:45.920 --> 41:47.920

42:04.920 --> 42:05.920

42:08.920 --> 42:11.920

42:11.920 --> 42:12.920
Shabron.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.920
I'm not putting Shibiti toilet.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.920
I'll spell it a different way, though.

42:41.920 --> 42:42.920

42:44.920 --> 42:45.920

43:04.920 --> 43:07.920

43:07.920 --> 43:08.920
I can't even.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.920
Shab- Shabelle mentioned, no.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
What was that book about the vampire rabbit?

43:13.920 --> 43:15.920
I have no idea what you're talking about.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.920
Guys, is Shabuse really winning right now?

43:24.920 --> 43:27.920
Oh, but Nikula, yes, that's true, that's true.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.920
Shabonomics, this is Finland.

43:30.920 --> 43:34.920
Shabuya, Shabelle, Delfin, Nani.

43:35.920 --> 43:36.920
Okay.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.920
Shabonomics.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.920
It was Shibuse.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.920
We are Shibuse.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.920
I'm generally surprised that it showed my last save

44:02.920 --> 44:04.920
because when I was setting everything up before,

44:04.920 --> 44:06.920
I was double checking if I had any save files

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
and it said I didn't.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.920
And then when I put in the name before,

44:09.920 --> 44:11.920
I was trying to speedrun to see if stuff worked

44:11.920 --> 44:12.920
and it was like put in a name

44:12.920 --> 44:14.920
and it didn't show any name.

44:15.920 --> 44:16.920
Spooky, okay.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.920
So I get automatic that.

44:22.920 --> 44:23.920
Where did the audio go?

44:23.920 --> 44:25.920
If there's like no audio in this part.

44:25.920 --> 44:28.920
I had an apostrophe to make it classy.

44:31.920 --> 44:32.920
But where?

44:33.920 --> 44:34.920
Shibuse.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.920
It just makes me sound so fucking ghetto.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.920
Let's see.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.920
This kind of doesn't matter to me

44:46.920 --> 44:48.920
because I might do some like cheatsy doodlin

44:48.920 --> 44:51.920
and like fucking

44:54.920 --> 44:55.920
add shit later.

44:58.920 --> 45:01.920
I think I'm gonna do firearms.

45:02.920 --> 45:03.920
Yeah.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.920
And intimidation naturally.

45:06.920 --> 45:07.920
Can I not?

45:07.920 --> 45:08.920
Yeah.

45:10.920 --> 45:13.920
And then, you know, I should do knowledge and finance.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.920
I'm making it based off of me.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.920
I'm not making it based off of anything else.

45:18.920 --> 45:19.920
Wait, what?

45:22.920 --> 45:24.920
Game is haunted by my past life.

45:24.920 --> 45:25.920

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920

45:26.920 --> 45:28.920
Rest in peace.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.920
Rest in peace.

45:32.920 --> 45:34.920
A little bit cheating for the bit.

45:36.920 --> 45:37.920
Oh, what do you mean?

45:37.920 --> 45:38.920
Like this?

45:38.920 --> 45:39.920
Hold on.

45:39.920 --> 45:40.920
I can't copy, paste.

45:40.920 --> 45:41.920
Oh, wait.

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
Question mark.

45:46.920 --> 45:48.920
Ah, that looks a lot better.

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920

45:50.920 --> 45:51.920

45:53.920 --> 45:54.920

46:00.920 --> 46:01.920
Why does the question mark show up

46:01.920 --> 46:03.920
when it goes too far?

46:03.920 --> 46:06.920
I don't even know if this still sounds the same.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
What is that?

46:10.920 --> 46:12.920
My chat just fucking

46:12.920 --> 46:14.920
exploded for some reason.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.920
What are Shibi's best attributes?

46:19.920 --> 46:20.920
Yappage.

46:21.920 --> 46:22.920
Charisma.

46:22.920 --> 46:23.920
100%.

46:24.920 --> 46:25.920
Charisma.

46:25.920 --> 46:26.920
100%.

46:34.920 --> 46:35.920
I'm pretty strong.

46:43.920 --> 46:44.920
It makes my intimidation go up,

46:44.920 --> 46:45.920
which would be cool.

46:47.920 --> 46:48.920
My research

46:49.920 --> 46:51.920
range combat would be better.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.920
Again, none of this really fucking matters.

46:58.920 --> 46:59.920
Why can't I?

46:59.920 --> 47:01.920
I wish I could put it under physical.

47:06.920 --> 47:07.920
Investigation.

47:08.920 --> 47:09.920
Scholarship.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.920
My persuasion would go up for that.

47:13.920 --> 47:14.920
Haggle.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.920
The 10 hour stream stamina.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.920
I can't add anything to stamina though.

47:23.920 --> 47:24.920
Dominate.

47:24.920 --> 47:25.920
Put that up.

47:28.920 --> 47:29.920
Knowledge.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.920
It's more important than

47:35.920 --> 47:36.920
whatever the fuck that guy says.

47:36.920 --> 47:37.920
Knowledge.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
Persuasion.

47:40.920 --> 47:41.920
I might do that for persuasion.

47:41.920 --> 47:42.920
Computer hacking.

47:50.920 --> 47:51.920
Wait.

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
Hold on.

47:52.920 --> 47:53.920
Fuck that.

47:54.920 --> 47:55.920
Put that there.

47:55.920 --> 47:56.920
Wait, what?

47:57.920 --> 47:58.920
Fuck.

47:58.920 --> 47:59.920
Can we do one?

48:01.920 --> 48:02.920
All right.

48:02.920 --> 48:03.920
Is that everything?

48:03.920 --> 48:04.920
It is.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.920
Computer kind of useless,

48:07.920 --> 48:08.920
but it

48:09.920 --> 48:10.920
fine.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.920
We are

48:15.920 --> 48:16.920
really persuasive.

48:20.920 --> 48:21.920
Christmas and Dominate.

48:22.920 --> 48:24.920
Yeah, I'm going to dummy mommy through the thing.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.920
Here in my garage.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.920
My brand new Lamborghini.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.920
Just remember the pass codes.

48:37.920 --> 48:38.920
My

48:38.920 --> 48:40.920
seduction is at three.

48:44.920 --> 48:45.920
What?

48:45.920 --> 48:46.920
Can we get a four?

48:49.920 --> 48:51.920
Yeah, I'm not really intimidating.

48:53.920 --> 48:54.920
Let's do that.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.920
You totally go cool for me.

48:57.920 --> 48:58.920
I'm going ghost.

49:01.920 --> 49:02.920
Very sweet.

49:02.920 --> 49:03.920
You guys are so sweet.

49:04.920 --> 49:05.920
So fucking sweet.

49:05.920 --> 49:06.920
What the hell?

49:07.920 --> 49:08.920
Where my mouse go?

49:13.920 --> 49:14.920
It's a phantom.

49:14.920 --> 49:16.920
It's my extensive

49:16.920 --> 49:17.920
Warhammer 40K

49:18.920 --> 49:20.920
painted figurines.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.920
Oh no, I got some paint on you.

49:30.920 --> 49:31.920
For a dominatrix.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.920
Why am I in such a shit place?

49:38.920 --> 49:40.920
Why am I in such a shit place?

49:41.920 --> 49:43.920
Why am I in such a shit place?

49:45.920 --> 49:47.920
I don't think it's ever coming out.

49:47.920 --> 49:48.920
I'm so sorry.

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
I just feel it.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.920
The thing, the company went under, didn't they?

49:52.920 --> 49:53.920
What the?

49:57.920 --> 49:59.920
Step through the heart.

50:02.920 --> 50:03.920
Good evening.

50:03.920 --> 50:04.920
Good evening.

50:04.920 --> 50:05.920
Good evening.

50:05.920 --> 50:06.920
Good evening.

50:06.920 --> 50:07.920
Good evening.

50:07.920 --> 50:08.920
Good evening.

50:08.920 --> 50:09.920
Good evening.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.920
Good evening.

50:10.920 --> 50:11.920
Good evening.

50:11.920 --> 50:12.920
Good evening.

50:14.920 --> 50:16.920
He looks like ten times shorter next to his goon.

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
They're making it.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.920
Then is there another company that's taking it on?

50:23.920 --> 50:25.920
I like it's like five people in the audience.

50:32.920 --> 50:33.920
Oh, honey.

50:35.920 --> 50:36.920
Ew.

50:36.920 --> 50:37.920
Fuck off with that.

50:42.920 --> 50:43.920
Check the watch.

50:43.920 --> 50:44.920
That's not on his wrist.

50:46.920 --> 50:47.920
Is it meant to be just subtitles?

50:49.920 --> 50:50.920
Fine, is it too quiet?

50:53.920 --> 50:54.920
Well, you're gonna have to wait.

50:57.920 --> 50:58.920
Fine.

51:12.920 --> 51:15.920
Was game about being a killer, Bella?

51:19.920 --> 51:20.920
12 vampires.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.920
Did more people get up in the audience?

51:35.920 --> 51:37.920
He is rocking that shit.

51:37.920 --> 51:38.920
He is like a cup.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.920
He's looking like he's from a clockwork orange.

51:42.920 --> 51:45.920
He got the fucking cloud sword.

51:48.920 --> 51:49.920
Everybody's faces.

51:53.920 --> 51:54.920
It's gonna be me.

52:02.920 --> 52:03.920
Bro, he spawned.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.920
Why is everybody's eyes so shifty?

52:13.920 --> 52:14.920
This is bullshit.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.920
Nine's really pretty, though.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.920
I feel like how their eyes glance about

52:24.920 --> 52:26.920
is probably the most weirdest thing

52:26.920 --> 52:28.920
that's realistic in this game.

52:28.920 --> 52:29.920
Nobody's blinking.

52:29.920 --> 52:30.920
They blinked.

52:30.920 --> 52:31.920
They blinked.

52:31.920 --> 52:32.920
They blinked.

52:32.920 --> 52:33.920
They blinked.

52:33.920 --> 52:34.920
They blinked.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
They blinked.

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
They blinked.

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
They blinked.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
They blinked.

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
Nobody's blinking.

52:40.920 --> 52:41.920
They blinked.

52:43.920 --> 52:44.920
Nine's is hot.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
Nine's is nice.

53:02.920 --> 53:04.920
Okay, now what?

53:08.920 --> 53:10.920
I was just here to dom people.

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
I don't know what happened.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.920
There was handcuffs and I handcuffed him.

53:15.920 --> 53:18.920
Then he like showed me his more hammer figurines

53:18.920 --> 53:21.920
and then stabbed me with one of his really small paint brushes.

53:22.920 --> 53:23.920
I'm not a vampire.

53:23.920 --> 53:24.920
I'm human.

53:31.920 --> 53:33.920
I hate their posture in this game.

53:33.920 --> 53:36.920
I wish I could like, it's like being with my head cut off

53:36.920 --> 53:38.920
when I'm wearing the outfit on my model.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.920
Like, what the fuck is up with the posture?

53:40.920 --> 53:41.920
My neck is broken.

53:41.920 --> 53:43.920
I have scoliosis.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.920
But honestly, this game,

53:49.920 --> 53:51.920
I fucking love this game.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.920
Like the aesthetic of this game so much.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.920
It's cord mod posture.

54:00.920 --> 54:02.920
Maybe your character is sad.

54:03.920 --> 54:05.920
So just like real life for some of us.

54:05.920 --> 54:06.920
Yikes.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.920
It was ice if that's you bro.

54:10.920 --> 54:11.920
I'm sorry.

54:13.920 --> 54:15.920
I wish I could play this on controllers.

54:15.920 --> 54:16.920
I could lean back.

54:16.920 --> 54:17.920
You know what?

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
Lay in my chairboard.

54:23.920 --> 54:24.920
Alright.

54:24.920 --> 54:25.920
Oh fuck.

54:25.920 --> 54:26.920
Oh god.

54:26.920 --> 54:27.920
Oh Jake.

54:28.920 --> 54:29.920
It's shake the dog.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.920
Ah, look you know.

54:37.920 --> 54:39.920
It's probably a lot for you to take in.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.920
So why don't you let me show you the ropes?

54:41.920 --> 54:42.920
What do you say?

54:42.920 --> 54:44.920
Show me the ropes.

54:46.920 --> 54:48.920
Show me the ropes.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.920
Did somebody say show the ropes?

54:52.920 --> 54:53.920
Okay anyways.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.920
What voice should I give her?

54:59.920 --> 55:00.920
I'm gonna put it to a vote.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.920
The game's gonna be paused for a second.

55:09.920 --> 55:10.920
Voice.

55:12.920 --> 55:13.920
Or

55:14.920 --> 55:15.920
Shibuse.

55:19.920 --> 55:20.920
My voice.

55:22.920 --> 55:23.920
Blue.

55:24.920 --> 55:26.920
Why is bro looking like that?

55:26.920 --> 55:28.920
Why is bro looking like that?

55:32.920 --> 55:34.920
Dummy mommy.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.920
AKA my patreon voice.

55:38.920 --> 55:39.920
British.

55:39.920 --> 55:40.920
Can I add a fifth one?

55:40.920 --> 55:42.920
Cause I was gonna do valley girl.

55:47.920 --> 55:48.920
Fuck my voice.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.920
We're gonna do valley girl.

55:51.920 --> 55:53.920
Oh, goodness gracious.

55:53.920 --> 55:54.920
Lord hammer.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.920
Let the games commence.

56:03.920 --> 56:04.920
I was, wow.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.920
I'm getting high praise for that.

56:08.920 --> 56:09.920
Thank you.

56:09.920 --> 56:10.920
Thank you everybody.

56:11.920 --> 56:12.920
Wow.

56:12.920 --> 56:15.920
You know, when I, when I joined this company, I didn't know.

56:16.920 --> 56:17.920
I didn't know.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.920
When I, when I joined this company, I didn't know.

56:22.920 --> 56:23.920
That's my boobs creep up.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.920
I didn't know that I would just be so in touch with my body

56:27.920 --> 56:29.920
and be able to burp on command.

56:29.920 --> 56:30.920
So I'd like to thank the academy.

56:30.920 --> 56:32.920
I'd like to thank Strani, my gen mates.

56:34.920 --> 56:35.920
Throw it in the montage.

56:36.920 --> 56:37.920
Good D volume on that one.

56:40.920 --> 56:41.920
Is it, is it Dummy mommy?

56:43.920 --> 56:44.920
Want the Dummy mommy voice?

56:48.920 --> 56:49.920
All right.

56:50.920 --> 56:51.920
From a landslide.

56:53.920 --> 56:54.920
Yes.

56:56.920 --> 56:57.920
Okay.

56:57.920 --> 56:58.920
The Patreon voice.

57:00.920 --> 57:01.920
Got again to character.

57:02.920 --> 57:03.920
Who are you?

57:06.920 --> 57:07.920
I'm Jack.

57:17.920 --> 57:18.920
Hmm.

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
I don't have much time.

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
Just give me the basics.

57:34.920 --> 57:35.920
You think I can do that voice?

57:35.920 --> 57:36.920
No.

57:41.920 --> 57:42.920
The wink killed me.

57:42.920 --> 57:43.920
Did I accidentally wink?

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
Okay.

57:48.920 --> 57:49.920
The Vtuber company?

57:49.920 --> 57:50.920
I know all about them.

57:55.920 --> 57:56.920
Lemon squeezy.

57:58.920 --> 58:01.920
Are we going in sneaky-beaky like?

58:04.920 --> 58:05.920
Wrong text.

58:05.920 --> 58:06.920
Speech voice.

58:06.920 --> 58:07.920
Wasn't it enough?

58:08.920 --> 58:09.920
I don't know.

58:09.920 --> 58:10.920
I don't know.

58:10.920 --> 58:11.920
I don't know.

58:11.920 --> 58:12.920
I don't know.

58:12.920 --> 58:13.920
I don't know.

58:13.920 --> 58:14.920
I don't know.

58:14.920 --> 58:15.920
Wrong text.

58:15.920 --> 58:16.920
Speech voice.

58:16.920 --> 58:17.920
Wasn't it an option?

58:18.920 --> 58:19.920
I'm so sorry, Heron.

58:21.920 --> 58:22.920
I'm listening.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.920
This will probably be a long stream too.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.920
I don't think I'll do another 10 hours for

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
Vampire of the Masquerade,

58:34.920 --> 58:36.920
but I do really like this game,

58:36.920 --> 58:39.920
so I might go a little bit past time.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.920
I don't want to be a homicidal maniac.

58:54.920 --> 58:56.920
But I want to be a homicidal maniac.

59:02.920 --> 59:03.920
I was like, yeah.

59:03.920 --> 59:04.920
Yeah.

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
Yeah.

59:05.920 --> 59:06.920
Yeah.

59:13.920 --> 59:14.920
Okay.

59:16.920 --> 59:17.920
I think so.

59:21.920 --> 59:22.920
That's funny.

59:22.920 --> 59:24.920
I'll sleep the day off and laugh later.

59:24.920 --> 59:25.920
See ya.

59:25.920 --> 59:26.920
Okay.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.860

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.660
There's a hair on my bro's side of my apartment

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.820
She's showering him. What the dog doing? I could go look

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:40.540
I open the door and we'll start walking again. They're walking by my door. Hold on

I'd be open to negotiations

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:02.460
Question is I have a son of chou medallion if you want it. I think it would look good on your chain

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.660
Want to send your buddy out of the room and find out wait, I forget how to

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.460

Might save because I can't remember how to um feed maybe I should have played this tutorial again

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.580

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.780

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.820

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.660

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:20.300

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:31.420
I forgot to stop feeding

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.540
Figured it out

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.780
Now it would have been awkward if I killed him. Oh any other drugs I can take

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.100
Cool

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:56.460
Uh don't worry about your boss or nothing. You guys fuck I wanted to steal shit. I'll come back when I'm stronger

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.180
Wow that was way easier from when I played the first time

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:07.180
It took me like an hour to do that because I tried to kill everybody. Let's talk to Brian

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.340
Bye Brian

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.980
He's like a roid head or something

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:22.300
I almost jumped into the fucking ocean. How the hell do I get out of here?

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.020
Hello

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.460
Oh, how am I supposed to see those fucking stairs?

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.380
Spitting in the camera isn't necessary

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:44.380
Brian's first you're gonna catch. I know sweetie, cover up a little bit

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.420

I'm going to China. What are you talking about?

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.540
Why is he smiling?

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.620
Is it the father? Is it the father behind him?

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500
You're not making any sense

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.580
Do you guys always be shirtless and say I'm not good?

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.780
Okay, maybe I won't play this for multiple hours. I'm kidding if I'm going to get motion sick

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:35.580
It's over. Oh god. Oh god. We're on

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.740
Okay, bye

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:50.240
I could go up there and see what's up with the cops, but I'm just gonna focus on the main mission

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:10.220
Is the volume too low? Oh my god, the dog is barking outside. You hear it?

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:16.060

01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:33.660
Azula

It's like the start of facade. Oh my god

01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.740

01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:49.100
I haven't heard of the game in such a long time. Holy shit. Can I watch? Let me watch

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.420

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.860
Hello, hey

Please come in. I do apologize for my sister's crassness. You're hot

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:18.140
She's unabashedly scandalous, but in the club business, I suppose that kind of personality is a necessary evil

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:20.380
I'm supposed to be watching one piece. You're good

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:27.260
Um hold on I want to make sure of something

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:33.660
But I do something properly

01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.220
You

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:03.020
Sorry don't mind me looking up a walkthrough

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:14.540
You

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.060
Face this is the way

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:27.900
Uh, I just want to make sure I can romance the both of them. So instead of just only one of them

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.140
It's very important to me

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:34.700
All right

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:39.180
I know like when I played before

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:44.540
It didn't work out and I was really depressed afterwards. I just want to make sure

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.460
So

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:58.620
I'm the proprietor of this club and the only person in this city whose good side it's in your best interest to stay on

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.180
What brings you to Santa Monica?

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.060
I

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:08.540
Call off the feud I need you to call off the feud of Bertram tongue

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:16.300
Tongue's exile is self-imposed. I assure you but then what reason would I have not to hate that lonesome nasferatu scoundrel

01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:20.780
Bloody nosferatu. Oh my god. Is that miko hatune in the background?

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.500
Is that hatune miko?

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.500
People

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.780
Why do you hate him he meddles in my affairs

01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:37.100
He's a bad influence on my sister and she on him if you were in my place

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:43.900
Would you let him compromise your authority? You're most certainly would not I'd quite like it if I never hear that name again

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.780
I'm so sorry I uh

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:55.740
I

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:15.820
I'm so sorry teres. I didn't mean to burp in your face

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:17.820
Why would I do that?

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.820
Let him think I mean to kill him that way

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.820
I didn't know this was the case

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.820
Do you realize how this is happening?

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.820
I literally cuffed the microphone and I was like

01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:27.820
Oh

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:29.820
Um

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:35.820
That's unfortunate, but I do need to see him tongue and his co-conspirators actions ruined my chance at parties

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.820
I don't know why I'm so sorry

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:39.820
I don't know why I'm so sorry

01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.820
I don't know why I'm so sorry

01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:47.420
Tong and his co-conspirators actions ruined my chance at partnership in a crucial piece of property

01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:52.140
I do have several other promising ventures and one in particular has been

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.780
To save at least an ordeal

01:41:55.900 --> 01:42:00.300
I'd be willing to put the word out that my grievances with tongue have been swept under the rug

01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:05.580
But in return you'll have to help my god. I want a burrito from chipotle suddenly

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.060
I'm looking to invest in

01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:11.420
Although every time I order from that chipotle, they always fuck up my order

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.260
Sorry, I because like I just like thought of it

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:17.980
Because I got a notification from an app

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:20.620
And I've only had

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.020
What did I eat today?

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:25.660
Serial

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.500
In a croissant

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500
I had a croissant

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.300
It was a Nutella croissant

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:41.820
No, don't I got a burrito from chipotle yesterday to ruin my stomach

01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:46.940
Yeah, every time I order they always get it wrong

01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.060
I've had

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:52.060
Like and not like oh, they

01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:55.340
Like forget to give me utensils or a straw like

01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:00.780
What I ordered a burrito and they gave me only rice and meat

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:04.700
And I ordered it from door to

01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.660
And I like what the fuck is this?

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:11.660
And then they're like

01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:15.020
I'm like but they just out of everything and then and then I ordered another time

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.900
And I went the store to pick it up

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:21.760
And there was like 50 people in chipotle

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:29.500
If you got scared, yeah, literally I'm like why like I don't even like why did he not

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:34.060
Like they must have not been it like had anything and they just put meat and rice

01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:36.780
And like cheese. I don't remember what else was there

01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:39.100
um

01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:40.700
and they

01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:45.180
There's like 50 people in chipotle people who had been waiting for 30 minutes for the food they ordered

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:47.740
And so I waited 30 minutes

01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:50.380
Then I waited an hour

01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:55.420
And then I uh went to the chipotle app and I canceled my order and they refunded me

01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.780
and then

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:02.220
At like 9 p.m. And mind you I went at 6 to pick it up

01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.940
They're like my order was ready

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.300
I still got a notification it was ready and I'm like

01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:13.500
Do I drive all the way back to fucking chipotle to

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:15.740

Feel like I'm like I'm all comfy in bed. I'm like curl up with my little show

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:31.580
With my kitty cats and I'm like I'm not crawling out of bed to get free like I'm like whatever

So I was just like really pissed and then the last time

01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.140

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:52.300
They forgot like half of the ingredients again and then for the salsa so you guys know I can't handle spice

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:59.100
Like I can only hand I can handle a little bit of spice, but like they're spiciest sauce I can't handle

01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:03.500
I put like the mild salsa in there. They gave me the spiciest one

01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:06.140
So I bit into it and I almost fucking died

01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:13.500
And then they gave so and then as a like a thing

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:20.220

01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:27.020
And it was like there's a certain amount of time I could use it

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.340

Never heard chipotle is begin what you said it must have been that yeah, I'd like don't eat there

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:05.580
Although there's another one that's like farther away from me. That one's fine

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.140
I'm like what the fuck?

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.300
Sorry white gal variant about chipotle

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:19.260
Gladly, what do I have to do rumor is that a personal item of a ghost maybe there's a taq area

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:24.060
That's open to me that I think I can order burrito from while I don't put a lot of stock in here say

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:30.780
It's my last option. So I want you to go to the ocean house hotel find an item of the spirits and bring it back

01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:35.820
I'll do it if you promise to call off the feud

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:38.300
Oh, I fully intend to do so

01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:44.060
You'll find that dealing with me on the whole is appreciably more looking to be up and down and I'm about to arc

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.060
Oh

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:49.660
So long as our business doesn't go sour. My word is gold

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.300
Can I just

01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:55.260
Unbutton

01:46:55.820 --> 01:47:00.380
Your shirt possible

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:05.900
Before I forget take this the only way to reach the ocean house

01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:11.820
It's dangerous to go alone take this that key to open the gate for that tunnel

01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:20.700
That's what it takes to get the job done baby girl if you'll excuse me I've got situations to set straight

01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.460
Right. Goodbye

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.580
Oh, let me switch. I can't see the chat

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:33.600
Oh my god, my nose is fucking itchy

01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:42.460
These assets in the game run the game star trick bridge command was made on the same time the same time graphics

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:47.500
Yeah, I actually I like I like these types of graphics. It's just like simple, but like

01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:50.380
I don't know the aesthetic

01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.780
I

01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:59.260
Know what those are not allowed. Who are you talking to?

01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:02.220
Jeanette, are you okay in there?

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.940

Hold on. Yeah, that's funny

The same color eyes and janets janets has two different colored eyes and that doesn't like always confused me in this game

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.660

02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:58.300
Yeah, great art. Thank you. Um sly ukai or yuka one

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.300
Great

02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:04.540
You wink

02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.900
And I hope we get monetization soon

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:25.020
I

02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:28.220
I'm enjoying my old twitter

02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:34.380
I don't know what you're talking about what old twitter

02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:40.700
Where do people submit fanfics yes in my maros you can submit it in my maros

02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:47.980
Um, I want it to be in the vein of like my immortals so like super cringy really bad

02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:50.700
um

02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:55.740
Some people have sent me like really nice ones like really well written and I'm like no

02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:57.900
I said

02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.020
cringy

02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:03.580
Tarot me me ones or even ones like you don't have to write them yourselves like like

02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:08.780
If you were to write one you can make about me or my gen mates and you can make it like cringy you can self insert

02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:12.300
That's fine or you can do like a your name like y slash n

02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:17.900
Um, I want the cringe. I want to be like fangs because I'm gothic like my immortal type

02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:22.780
And if I don't like anything that's submitted I'm probably just gonna read my immortal

02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:33.500
Um, if if anyone's gonna convince youtube to want to test your channel, it's definitely you um, I'm also working on

02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:37.420
Um

02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:40.380
Making the first class of 9

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:45.660
Uh play through public again. I was editing it

02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:51.180
Um, so that's fine. I left some funny stuff in there though. Uh, I don't know if it's processing

02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:56.700
Can you submit a high sonic high school fail? I'll hunt. That's what I'm looking for. That is literally what I'm looking for

02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:58.780
So that would be perfect. Um

02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:03.340
So I don't I might wait till I get monetized to

02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:06.300
Make it public again

02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:10.220
My stream was historical. Yeah, I was rewatching it like parts of it and I was

02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:12.700
cackling at myself

02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:14.700
And at my ac in the background

02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:18.220
Um, but yeah, I'm gonna wait

02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:25.580
To get monetized before I publicize that again. It was very fun. Yes, I will definitely probably play class of 9 again

02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:29.420
But that'll be like later in the future or maybe I'll do it as a gorilla sometime

02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:33.660
Um, I definitely want to play a little bit of call of the lamb again

02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:39.500
You know, I'll probably do another endurance stream for that. Riley. I just got another boss

02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:43.020
I was like endurance stream and this like kill a boss each time

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:45.500
Or or two

02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:47.500
um

02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:54.060
And then like you can also like recommend me games and my murals and stuff that you'd like me to play because again like I

02:11:55.020 --> 02:12:00.780
Grew up playing a lot of fps's. I'm not even good at them. Um, so I

02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:05.100
I want to widen my horizons in terms of games

02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:08.060
So if you have game suggestions

02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:10.380
cool

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:15.500
Or I'm just gonna end up playing flavors of the month like bunny garden. I don't even know what it's about

02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:17.500
I think there's like hot girls in it

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:24.540
Hopefully my character shows up for call of the lamb. Yeah, I actually really oh, I'm gonna play inscription with crowd control

02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:27.420
100%

02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:30.220
I'm like actually like a little bit tempted to like yoink

02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:37.340
Bunny garden and do inscription with crowd control. I I really like crowd control games. Um, because I really like

02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:40.860
You guys interacting. I wouldn't

02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:45.180
Play through inscription. I would probably just play

02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.900
the first part

02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:49.340
um

02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:54.460
Just because the game is like I I've finished inscription before it's literally one of my favorite games of all time

02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:56.860
um

02:12:56.860 --> 02:13:02.220
Like the first part is like the best and then the second part's like a little bit confusing and was really frustrating for me to get through

02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:04.300
the part with

02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:08.540
Robot version is good and then the parts after that are like, okay, so, um

02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:13.660
I really like you guys nice to get free bro wrong

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:19.900
But you don't you don't want to be my boyfriend girlfriend. You want to be my boyfriend girlfriend girlfriend boyfriend

02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:22.700
What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up?

02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:26.380
Um

02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:29.980
Bolivian is going to bucket list. Uh, I'm pretty sure

02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:33.500
Strawny's playing skyrim next week

02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:39.820
So I probably wait a little bit like a couple months. I do before I play skyrim

02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:42.380
um

02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:45.500
I have a bolivian. I could probably play a bolivian

02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:52.060
Um, I only did a little bit of bolivian before has crowd control work. It's pretty cool because um

02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:58.380
You guys get like coins and like sometimes like you can purchase coins if you want you guys don't have to

02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:02.780
I'm trying to figure it out. So you guys don't like can you get more free coins to mess around with stuff?

02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:06.780
And uh

02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:08.940
You can control aspects of my stream

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:14.620
And like my gameplay and I that's why I like I think like for example with the description because it's like

02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:17.660
It's almost like hearthstone or it's like it's a card game and stuff

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:24.540
Um, you just like make my hand all bees or whatever instead of like me having like a more boris or something

02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:29.180
So I think that would be really fun. Um, that's why I only want to do like the first part because I know you guys like I

02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:33.020
Like I fucking love inscription. Um

02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:38.140
I want to play pony island 2 when it comes out because I play pony island

02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:44.780
Could you make everything just one coin or something? No, that'd be too easy. Are you kidding? So you want to do? Hold on, let me just

02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:50.140
Like weird weird angle since you want to do more of a variety of games

02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:53.740
I've thought about trying out rts or turn based strategy games

02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:56.940
Give me an example of that

02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:59.580
and I have

02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:01.820
Like done the beam out of four and it was pretty good

02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:05.180
One coin would be chaos

02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:11.020
Um, but I'll I'll probably like look through some of the crowd control games and like get a couple

02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:13.260
balder's gate

02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:15.260
I like fire emblem three houses

02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:19.740
He he he um

02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:22.540
Because I like

02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:24.220
The romancing in the story

02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:29.180
Oh, yeah, I definitely want to play hades because people have suggested hades. It's like yeah, I turned off martyr the lamb

02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:30.860
um

02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:32.860
balder's gate

02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:35.420
I'm not

02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:37.820
I'm kind of impatient when it comes to those games

02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:45.100
I don't I'm not a huge fan of turn based games, but fire emblem three houses, which was the first fire emblem game I played kind of

02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:50.140
Um, and then I played a little bit of like the one that Iksen that I can't remember the top of my head

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:53.180
Um, and I do like it, but it just

02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:59.660
I'd have to because like I have but I literally have balder's gate on my playstation

02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:02.140
I only played like three hours of it though

02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:05.820
Yes, I play pathically a little bit of pathoradians

02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:07.740
um

02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:11.980
I'd play diablo like that would be cool. I'll like I'll play diablo. I actually like diablo

02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:14.300
um

02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:19.260
But maybe balder's gate and I also don't know if my pc would be able to handle balder's gate because it's like pretty

02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:24.140
Intensive I have slay the princess. I would I would totally play slay the princess

02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:27.820
uh, I used to play warframe a lot when

02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.220
um

02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:33.580
I needed a titanfall fix and like I don't think destiny was a thing yet

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:37.500
I'm a awakening figure it on me like oh, I mean

02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:40.380
I don't need one of those

02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:45.100
I have a capture card and I have every game console. Let me talk about

02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:49.180
Warframe at the harem. I don't know if I would play warframe again though

02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:53.980
I haven't touched that game and like

02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:58.460
To 3d yet. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about 3ds style

02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:03.020
I can make it run on the 3ds and hook it up to my computer

02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:05.020
fashion frame

02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:07.340
uh, I remember I used to just focus in all the

02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:11.180
The outfits in that game. I was like full pearl pink or whatever

02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:13.580
um

02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:16.700
I haven't touched that game in like so fucking long

02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.500
subverse. I don't know what that is

02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:22.300
Three houses or nothing

02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:27.660
You got tired of war. Yeah warframe was super grindy like I don't mind grindy games

02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:33.100
Like I played the shit out of destiny 2 and destiny 1 those things, you know around

02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:41.500
And I know like like I'm notorious for starting games and not finishing them like games really have to capture my attention

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:44.380
like

02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.620
That's why I like inscription and call the lamb

02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:50.140
If they're in the same vein as that I'll probably really like it

02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:55.980
Uh, it's an at plus game. Oh, yeah, I want to play hoony pop when we eventually get our fanslies

02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:59.740
That'd be so fun because I've been playing a lot of match three games

02:18:01.820 --> 02:18:03.820
I've yeah, I've been recommended hall and I before

02:18:04.700 --> 02:18:12.060
Um, I know that people are like bummed or whatever that there's not a like the another game hasn't come out

02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:14.060
I can't remember

02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:17.260
Um

02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:23.580
Having awful I still yeah, I I want I played the most recent diablo and I really I played it for like a pretty long time

02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:28.780
I don't even remember what level I am and then I guess got distracted by other stuff

02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:33.820
Dead cell no

02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:37.180

02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:40.780

02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:44.140

Why don't you play any game tbh? Oh, thank you hitman's a great stream game

02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:27.420

02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:32.620
In the main of skyrim, there's andral for ground stories and ma will become folio on steam

02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:35.980

It's a mechs. It's a mech souls like

02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:50.700

02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:55.260
Armored core is a mecha game and purely people want to pretend as souls with it clearly is it hold on

02:23:55.900 --> 02:23:58.540
Mecha souls gunned among I need to hold on

Oh my god, I don't want to fuck a robot

02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:05.980
Is there a post in a funny meme this morning about if your vibrator turned into a transformer?

02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:10.460
And then you anyways

02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:19.340
This looks sick. Where's the gameplay? I want gameplay. Show me gameplay

02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:29.740
Okay, there's only screenshots gameplay preview, sorry

02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.420
Elaborate mini transformers. Did you find your rose? No

02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:38.140
No

02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:44.060
Oh, I know ultra kill ultra kill. It's really fucking good

02:25:45.900 --> 02:25:51.580
It gave me like super hot vibes for some reason but gory super hot. I don't know if that's true

02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:56.700
Yeah, I'm too scared

02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:10.300
It's just taking too long. I want to see gameplay

02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:15.980
Wait, is the gameplay I asked for gameplay? I can't scroll forward

02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:24.700
What the fuck is it? Oh, it's from from front. You will say it's not a souls leg, but it's from from software

02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:28.540
Okay, I might have to I might have to cut that

02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:31.340
I gotta I might gotta get that

02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:33.900
I

02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:36.060
Gotta

02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:38.060
Oh my god

02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:40.140
Oh my god, it reminds me

02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:44.300
Of titanfall when you're in the mech. I fucking love titanfall and I miss this so much

02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:49.660
I fucking hate apex legends so much fuck apex legends. You took away titanfall 3 for me

02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:52.540
I hope the game

02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:54.540
Fucking rots

02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:58.620
Sorry

02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:03.900
Okay, yeah, I might have to get that

02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:11.980
Oh, shout out the retreat June 20. Sorry, that was like a my recommended

02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:19.740
I don't think titanfall 3 is ever gonna happen. Remember it takes July 5th 1921

02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:23.420
It's pretty hard

02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:27.020
Could you stream of titanfall 2? Yeah, I can do that

02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:33.580
I

02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:38.620
I repeat titanfall I love multiplayer like I would oh like

02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:48.380
Like that in destiny were the only like fps games that was actually good at and I would usually be a top frag

02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:52.620
If it's caught I'm just like kind of there. I'm like kind of in the middle

02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:06.060
Titanfall come out at the same time as half life 3 don't call us suckers

02:28:07.260 --> 02:28:09.260
God boo

02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:13.020
I just like the wall running. I know it's such a cool feature in titanfall

02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:17.740
I'm so guys they're not gonna do titanfall 3 apex legends

02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:25.100
Is just like a the like a little piggy bank for them full of money. They don't need to make titanfall 3

02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:33.180
You all did get alex that's true you got alex

02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:40.380
I want to be held and

02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:42.460
Cradled by my titan daddy

02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:49.260
Apex is the font titanfall 3. You'll see I wish though. I know I think they're adding

02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:53.580
I think there was like whispers of them adding one of the titans

02:28:55.420 --> 02:28:56.700
In the game

02:28:56.700 --> 02:28:58.220
In apex

02:28:58.220 --> 02:28:59.740
as something

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:05.820
And could probably fill a titanfall 2 lobby of playing with viewers. Yeah, but like the game is so fucking I think it's like super

02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:07.820
buggy

02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:11.020
And hacky and isn't right like multiplayer doesn't load properly

02:29:14.140 --> 02:29:16.140
I'm often coping over here

02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:20.940
Oh my god

02:29:20.940 --> 02:29:22.940
Loud neighbors again

02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:25.260
Angel city is an apex map. Oh

02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:26.700
I

02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:32.380
Angel city was one of my favorite maps if they added like it'd be so fucking easy to add titanfall maps

02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:38.140
To apex I would play I would I won't lie. I'll play if they added

02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:40.860
titanfall maps

02:29:42.140 --> 02:29:45.980
I would they'd rather make apex legends 2 than titanfall 3. I know it fucking sucks

02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:52.700
Or this they might be

02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:57.180
Beautiful lady tell me do you have a dream and what is it?

02:29:57.660 --> 02:30:02.940
Mine is very simple to be as close as the man in the picture on my profile's possible with life and love

02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:07.340
What the fuck is your profile picture?

02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:10.860
What is this what just cringe shit?

02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:16.380
Oh my god, somebody's calling me hold on

02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:16.460

02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:33.500
I'm surprised

02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:36.140

Clean from gacha. Yeah, I feel like I would spend so much money on gacha's like in the worst way

02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:10.540
Cooking dinner. What are you cooking?

It's like nfts preferred weaves

02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:43.580
What's the name of this place i'm gonna order from again

02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:46.380
Just lost my page

02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:51.100
Already got it right here. Haha nice riz attempt

02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:56.460
Any of those five target star weapons or characters like I tried playing honkai star rail and I was bored

02:43:57.820 --> 02:43:59.580
is that

02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:01.580
Is that a hot take

02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:10.380
Fuck what is this where did it go did my thing crash?

02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:15.820
Oh, yeah

02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:19.420
It's like new food places going up near me

02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:23.260
So I opened

02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:28.860
Google on my phone and the first thing I see is the kirby gift of him like sucking somebody's arm that I posted on strani

02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:31.180
thing

02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:33.900
If any be honest, I'm more tan on my legs than you and I'm full

02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:42.220
Listen, I haven't been outside in a very long time if you saw my face in my hair you'd be like, okay, she's brown

02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:46.540
But if you any other aspect of my body is white woman jumpscare

02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:52.300
Honkai was was me

02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:56.380
I don't really know if you squint after playing genshin weathering waves

02:44:56.860 --> 02:45:01.580
I thought weathering waves was like a book title, but I was like getting used to the weathering heights

02:45:02.700 --> 02:45:05.340
Honkai and azur lane together you see don't well. Yeah, they're all

02:45:05.980 --> 02:45:07.980
You can see these different settings

02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:11.980
What did even I don't even I just discovered weather weathering waves like

02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:16.460
Two days ago or whatever the fuck early a couple of days ago, and I'm like, where did this come from?

02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:19.980
What the heck happened

02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:21.980
Kirby is canonically a cosmic horror

02:45:22.860 --> 02:45:24.860
I believe that

02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:31.280
You are so real for posting that kirby gift. Thank you. Do you guys pronounce it gif or jiff?

02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:39.980
I

02:45:44.700 --> 02:45:46.700
Hard g

02:45:49.740 --> 02:45:54.300

02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:02.860

02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:05.180

02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:11.180

I

02:47:36.540 --> 02:47:38.540
Who am I fighting

02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:43.580
Taco bill sinabon the lights

02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:49.100
I actually trifles for the first time like a week or so ago because I didn't have

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:54.380
Um I didn't go grocery shopping. So I just ended up ordering taco bill and I had one bite of those

02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:58.060
I want and I'm like no thank you. It tastes like greasy cream cheese

02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:02.220
I was I was okay with that. I didn't even eat them. It was a waste of money. I'm sorry

02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:07.660
People take gif versus gif. What's another thing people like

02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:14.860
Like oh is a hot dog a sandwich? That's my favorite. What do you guys is a hot dog? It's all we're gonna put it to a poll

02:48:17.260 --> 02:48:19.260
Sorry you guys are dropped in my lap

02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:26.780
Is a hot dog a sandwich me personally it's a taco

02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:33.180
Is cereal soup yes

02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:36.860
Smell the ice cream soup yes

02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:41.020
Is water wet

02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:44.780
I have to think about that one

02:48:47.340 --> 02:48:49.740
Um a ravioli is just an empanada

02:48:49.740 --> 02:48:51.740
I

02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:00.460
No, I ain't never had a real taco everything hot no hot dog is a taco 100%

02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:03.980
Is whiskey catch what?

02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:10.700
Cereal first I'm not a sociopath you leave empanadas out of this

02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:14.460
Is pizza an open-face sandwich hmm

02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:18.620
Legally a hot dog is a sandwich

02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:23.580
Hot dog is a sandwich if you need to specify the kind of sandwich

02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:27.020
Uh, I think a hot dog is a kind of taco

02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:30.380
Water with cereal what are you fucking on

02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:37.500
Hot dog is a taco and tacos are sandwich no no no no no you got it all wrong

02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:41.740
Is a calzone an empanada yes just an italian empanada

02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:45.340
Water makes things wet, but it's not what itself, but

02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:48.780
but

02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:52.700
If water makes things wet and water

02:49:55.500 --> 02:50:02.620
What did I ever get what the fucking we're gonna say if water makes things wet because it's wet that just answers the question itself

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:06.060
Water's wet because it makes things wet

02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:13.260
Can water be dry I think actually technically

02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:19.100
In a different form maybe I don't know water what's water there you go

02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:26.700
Auto's neutral state is wet you know what also who's neutral state is wet your mom

I'm like looking at where my phone stand when my phone is in my hands is ice wet yeah

02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:39.580
Aper is dry water there you go

02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:43.740
Not my mom my mom

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:46.620
Okay, now I have to find another place to eat

02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:50.300
Fucking hate it here

02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:54.700
Uh

02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:56.700
There's another

02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:58.700
taqueria

02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:00.700
And I wanted that taqueria

02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:04.700
I could order sushi

02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:13.340
I haven't had sushi in a long time now I think of about it

02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:27.340
Water is a tech why am I just like how my model froze um sushi's how expensive though yeah you're right

02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:31.580
She ate it

02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:33.980
I just finished my sashimi and now I want more yeah

02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:39.660
I'd like sushi always doesn't like really fill me unless I have like like a couple rolls and I and then it'll just be expensive

02:51:42.460 --> 02:51:44.460
I guess I'll starve

02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:46.940
Because I am indecisive as hell

02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:49.340
What do I have in the fridge?

02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:55.260
I have chicken tendis frozen. I have salmon frozen

02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:58.940
I have

02:52:00.380 --> 02:52:02.380
My headphones just shut off

02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:06.860
I

02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:10.460
Don't know

02:52:11.100 --> 02:52:14.460
Definitely need to charge them. Um, oh, I forgot I looked at candle burning

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:21.740
Okay, I can't blow from there, um

02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:24.860
Just came out from all you eat sushi place

02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:27.420
I don't fairly think I have any of those around here

02:52:28.860 --> 02:52:32.140
There's literally just like a bunch of spanish food trucks around

02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:38.220
And get chilies welcome to chilies

02:52:41.260 --> 02:52:44.060
Greek food oh I could fuck up some chicken shawarma

02:52:45.980 --> 02:52:47.980
Chawarma

02:52:49.500 --> 02:52:52.460
Pasta places that's true that would fill me up

02:52:53.260 --> 02:52:57.500
There's an olive garden nearby on crustables. I think I have one on crustable left

02:52:59.260 --> 02:53:01.260
You can unfroze them in the microwave Ernest

02:53:04.220 --> 02:53:06.220
You

02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:10.780
You put them in the microwave or a stove? Hold on

02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:15.500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

You make me want to vomit

02:53:52.620 --> 02:53:54.940
I can't believe it. I'm not the one in the microwave

02:53:56.220 --> 02:53:58.700
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off!

02:53:59.580 --> 02:54:02.460
I don't microwave water anymore. I have a kettle

02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:05.420
Don't come for me

02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:07.820
Come for me

02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:20.700
Fire on crustables frozen in the first place anymore. Don't worry about it

02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:27.580
I wish I could play a game instead of not talk the entire time, but woe is me

02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:30.300
I'm so indecisive

02:54:31.900 --> 02:54:35.740
I'm like that girlfriend you ask like oh where do you want to eat and I'm like I don't know

Last time I had sushi was a day your model was revealed. What does that mean?

02:55:08.780 --> 02:55:10.940
I wonder what that means does that mean something?

02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:14.620

But my house is inside my house. What are you talking about?

02:58:39.980 --> 02:58:47.340

i love a woman that can destroy food to be honest it's funny because like i remember

03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:39.400
i like had my so like my friend went on a date and um i was like lingering nearby

03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:46.600
because i was like worried for her deeply and um because you know you can't trust these these places

03:19:46.600 --> 03:19:53.480
these sites and the guy walked out on her because she ordered food

03:19:56.040 --> 03:20:03.160
like she ordered like a normal amount of food like she ordered like entree appetizer a drink

03:20:05.720 --> 03:20:10.360
and then i like talked to her afterwards because i was like fucking off somewhere else

03:20:10.360 --> 03:20:15.240
with our other friends because it wasn't just me it was more than um did your food no i haven't yet

03:20:15.240 --> 03:20:20.440
i still haven't thought of anything um we were like eating someplace nearby me and our friends

03:20:21.160 --> 03:20:30.840
and we're like oh redacted what happened and she's just like he said i was like not like he didn't

03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:37.400
like directly call her a pig from what she was saying but like he kind of like insinuated she

03:20:37.400 --> 03:20:44.440
wasn't like ladylike because she got so much food and we're like me and the other girls are like

03:20:44.440 --> 03:20:46.200
we'll fuck him anyways margaritas

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:57.480
so he got mad because she i don't like did like i'm like did you order something expensive

03:20:57.480 --> 03:21:03.800
and she's like no i just like got a burger and i'm like okay did he wink at her oh my god that's so

03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:11.800
fucked um but well it like it sucked because like he left and so she paid for both their meals

03:21:11.800 --> 03:21:17.400
and so like me and the other girls we like took her out and she didn't have to

03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:24.360
to spend any money because like that's so fucked yeah he did the the dip

03:21:26.440 --> 03:21:30.680
none of us fucking noticed either we're like really bad not sticking stuff out we're not reliable

03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:38.280
ah the napsel she'll have the salad literally i think that's what he expected her to get like a salad

03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:45.560
and like she's like a normal sized girl too like she's not like heavy she's not super skinny

03:21:46.520 --> 03:21:50.360
but she she's like literally the most normal looking girl you could ever see

03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:56.360
but he every day he could have been just like fuck like i don't know he could have been like

03:21:56.360 --> 03:22:01.080
pulling uh like a fast one on her like to get free food i don't fucking know

03:22:03.480 --> 03:22:05.400
you got your back see something shiny literally though

03:22:09.160 --> 03:22:11.960
because we were we were enjoying our own food down the street someplace else

03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:19.080
you just need an excuse to dip

03:22:21.480 --> 03:22:27.720
guys i don't want to get okay fuck it i'm gonna order for i'm kind of wanting something soupy

03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:47.000
the girl invited me on a date and it's a korean barbecue to the keeper

03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:51.560
there's like no korean barbecue places near me i've never had korean barbecue in my life

03:22:53.400 --> 03:22:54.360
i heard it's really good

03:22:57.400 --> 03:23:00.520
the way he thought he could have still free meal unless he was trying to split something

03:23:02.760 --> 03:23:05.560
fuck it you're missing out you know

03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:08.840
okay

03:23:12.360 --> 03:23:15.400
i like this has oxtail

03:23:18.200 --> 03:23:20.840
steak and flank so that's kind of fine

03:23:25.160 --> 03:23:29.240
it comes with hoisin sauce and sriracha should i get

03:23:31.080 --> 03:23:33.480
i'm not what's fish i've never had knock mom

03:23:38.920 --> 03:23:42.440
chili oil i have some chili oil in my fridge so i don't like it by chili oil

03:23:43.320 --> 03:23:46.120
or some wagyu beef i've had wagyu beef one time

03:23:47.880 --> 03:23:51.800
and it was very underwhelming i got at this really nice restaurant

03:23:52.440 --> 03:24:00.280
my parents were um celebrating a uh like a the fuck what was it

03:24:01.480 --> 03:24:07.560
what's the word i wasn't a raise a promotion i got and we ordered like this wagyu sushi

03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:16.520
and it didn't taste like anything but except like they added like a lot of like decorative

03:24:17.400 --> 03:24:19.560
flowers to it so it just tastes like burnt flowers

03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:23.320
like a sweet sour sauce

03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:27.160
meat sweats for these

03:24:29.320 --> 03:24:31.480
tartar no it wasn't like a tartar

03:24:33.320 --> 03:24:33.800
i don't know

03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:37.240
wagyu sushi yeah it was like

03:24:38.440 --> 03:24:39.480
topped with wagyu

03:24:43.240 --> 03:24:44.760
a minute order some spring rolls

03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:55.400
like others just turn into a fucking zatsu

03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:03.480
wagyu coming yeah it was like topped with like wagyu on and it was pretty good

03:25:04.040 --> 03:25:08.040
super inconsistent it was like you just got scammed maybe probably

03:25:09.400 --> 03:25:11.960
i'd show a picture but then you guys probably like hunt down the place

03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:16.680
because it looked amazing it did not taste good at all it was a waste of money

03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:21.000
and it was like 30 bucks no it was more than that

03:25:22.520 --> 03:25:23.960
it was like 50 bucks for the roll

03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:32.920
american japanese wagyu it was like a fusion restaurant and they had said it was japanese

03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:34.680
wagyu i know american is different

03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:41.000
but you know maybe one day i'll off-cloud with the girls when we're like go to japan

03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:44.760
and have like actual wagyu that'd be really cool i always wanted to go to japan

03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:55.240
or maybe you guys misgendered my cat kind of disappointed

03:25:59.560 --> 03:26:01.640
your thigh looks rough do you have a skin condition

03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:20.360
i'm sorry i'm reading the comments under

03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:28.760
no i don't know how does it look rough like i have um

03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:31.960
um what's it called

03:26:34.600 --> 03:26:39.080
the most a lot of girls have usually just edit it out of their photos by the way

03:26:39.720 --> 03:26:44.440
um like strawberry legs or whatever it's called

03:26:46.600 --> 03:26:49.000
uh where you just get like you can kind of see like

03:26:50.280 --> 03:26:52.920
your skin is like thin enough you can almost see where the hair would grow

03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:57.640
keratosis polaris yeah strawberry skin yeah like i have strawberry skin

03:26:59.320 --> 03:27:02.680
mind you i didn't throw any filters on it if i threw filters on it then you would

03:27:02.680 --> 03:27:06.440
be like oh wow her skin is so sooky smooth don't believe anything you see on the internet

03:27:06.440 --> 03:27:11.880
everything's edited start no i'm not strawberry blonde i'm not strawberry blonde

03:27:11.880 --> 03:27:14.920
give it on your arms yeah like it's like it's like it's very normal but i like

03:27:15.560 --> 03:27:24.120
is your skin rough yes i'm like a cat's tongue it's sandpaper oh me running by

03:27:24.120 --> 03:27:30.680
um no upper arm yeah a lot of people have it the cat was edited

03:27:36.600 --> 03:27:39.480
hold on i'm i'm so tempted like it's really hard

03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:46.040
like people will send like i know that's probably like the more intentional being like me

03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:50.440
and they're like generally curious like they said um or people will send like troll stuff in my maros

03:27:51.320 --> 03:27:56.840
and it's like if i have to fight the urge to troll people back so often

03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:03.240
like you know people try to like dom me in my maros or whatever

03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:05.160
and i just want to be like

03:28:08.280 --> 03:28:16.120
i just want to just like make fun of them but i'm like no don't do it don't feed the trolls she be

03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:24.120
she really is trolling keep into the wall i did that before and it

03:28:26.200 --> 03:28:31.880
it really doesn't go well all right look at some spring rolls

03:28:34.520 --> 03:28:34.920
i'll do

03:28:41.320 --> 03:28:48.520

giving me cramps or is it something else giving me cramps

03:29:03.320 --> 03:29:08.760
she be don't go to the dark side what does that mean oh the context of trolling

03:29:11.320 --> 03:29:14.840
you probably got a few more trolls since your twitter blew up actually i don't really get

03:29:15.800 --> 03:29:16.280
trolls

03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:22.760
and then like in before

03:29:24.520 --> 03:29:27.560
50 000 people show up on maros calling me the unordered or something um

03:29:28.600 --> 03:29:33.240
it's probably hunger probably uh we've gotten so far uh we've mostly just been yapping

03:29:34.920 --> 03:29:42.040
i have attention seek and behavior um it's mostly people just being like

uh you twitter i saw you got a fan account i have a lot of there's been a couple of fan

03:29:46.120 --> 03:29:52.360

I have a dual feeder, and then I have another feeder in the other room.

04:16:51.520 --> 04:16:54.520
And Phi is patiently waiting for the one in the other room.

04:16:59.520 --> 04:17:00.520
Okay.

04:17:04.520 --> 04:17:06.520
Streaming for another 10 hours stream.

04:17:06.520 --> 04:17:08.520
How long have I been streaming for?

04:17:09.520 --> 04:17:16.520
I'm also like, I'm streaming a lot because I know I won't be able to stream as much when I go back to work.

04:17:16.520 --> 04:17:18.520
So I'm just wanting to stream as much as possible.

04:17:22.520 --> 04:17:24.520
Did they put any noodles in here?

04:17:24.520 --> 04:17:25.520
Okay.

04:17:25.520 --> 04:17:27.520
There's not a lot of meat in here though.

04:17:27.520 --> 04:17:29.520
I'm kind of bummed.

04:17:29.520 --> 04:17:33.520
It said oxtail, there's no oxtail in here.

04:17:34.520 --> 04:17:36.520
It's only like steak and flank.

04:17:37.520 --> 04:17:38.520
Whatever.

04:17:38.520 --> 04:17:39.520
5 hours?

04:17:39.520 --> 04:17:40.520
Oh, okay.

04:17:44.520 --> 04:17:49.520
Pineapple pizza that I make, I get some white alfredo sauce, salami, ham, pineapple, red onions.

04:17:49.520 --> 04:17:50.520
Ooh, some barbecue sauce.

04:17:50.520 --> 04:17:52.520
I recommend hot honey.

04:17:53.520 --> 04:17:59.520
I've had, I went to this, like, I can't remember what the brand of the place is called, but they put hot honey on it.

04:18:01.520 --> 04:18:02.520
3 a.m. for you.

04:18:02.520 --> 04:18:04.520
Go to sleep.

04:18:04.520 --> 04:18:05.520
Have a good one.

04:18:05.520 --> 04:18:06.520
Oh, this is hot.

04:18:06.520 --> 04:18:07.520
I can't really.

04:18:11.520 --> 04:18:13.520
I just burned myself a little bit.

04:18:17.520 --> 04:18:18.520
There's like, blade's pizza.

04:18:18.520 --> 04:18:19.520
Maybe it was.

04:18:19.520 --> 04:18:20.520
I don't know.

04:18:21.520 --> 04:18:22.520
Blade's pizza's pretty good.

04:18:27.520 --> 04:18:28.520
Ooh, baby.

04:18:36.520 --> 04:18:37.520
May tacos?

04:18:37.520 --> 04:18:38.520
Ooh.

04:18:39.520 --> 04:18:40.520
My leash.

04:18:40.520 --> 04:18:41.520
I require sustenance.

04:18:41.520 --> 04:18:43.520
The food and bowl is already 5 minutes old.

04:18:43.520 --> 04:18:44.520
Honestly, that's how Reina is.

04:18:44.520 --> 04:18:46.520
Reina's a very picky eater.

04:18:50.520 --> 04:18:51.520
I don't blame her though.

04:18:51.520 --> 04:18:52.520
She's 14.

04:18:52.520 --> 04:18:55.520
She deserves to be picky at her age.

04:18:57.520 --> 04:19:01.520
She has kidney disease, so normally her thing is really low protein.

04:19:02.520 --> 04:19:04.520
Sometimes I give her a little treat and I give her, like, wet food.

04:19:05.520 --> 04:19:06.520
That's, like, mostly protein.

04:19:08.520 --> 04:19:09.520
She likes it a lot.

04:19:10.520 --> 04:19:12.520
Because honestly, at her age, I just want her to be happy.

04:19:15.520 --> 04:19:16.520
And, you know, eat.

04:19:20.520 --> 04:19:21.520
Have you worked at Blade's Pizza?

04:19:21.520 --> 04:19:22.520
Oh, that's cool.

04:19:22.520 --> 04:19:24.520
I've never worked in fast food.

04:19:27.520 --> 04:19:29.520
Gotta squeeze a little bit of lime in here.

04:19:30.520 --> 04:19:31.520
Be pampered.

04:19:31.520 --> 04:19:33.520
Yeah, I pamper her so much.

04:19:33.520 --> 04:19:35.520
My cousin came over in my apartment once.

04:19:36.520 --> 04:19:38.520
And, like, I love, like, so much cat shit everywhere.

04:19:38.520 --> 04:19:41.520
And, like, the cats have really nice water fountains and automatic feeders.

04:19:41.520 --> 04:19:43.520
And she's like, do they live in a fucking five-star hotel?

04:19:43.520 --> 04:19:45.520
And I'm like, oh, I guess so.

04:19:49.520 --> 04:19:50.520
Okay, I got that.

04:19:50.520 --> 04:19:53.520
They used to put the sauces in, like, little containers.

04:19:53.520 --> 04:19:54.520
And now they don't.

04:19:54.520 --> 04:19:56.520
And then you just have to, like...

04:19:56.520 --> 04:19:57.520
Like, how am I supposed to...

04:19:57.520 --> 04:19:59.520
I like to, like, take, um...

04:19:59.520 --> 04:20:01.520
Did they even eat chopsticks?

04:20:02.520 --> 04:20:03.520
Okay, they did.

04:20:11.520 --> 04:20:13.520
Chibi's cats are Wonderland VIPs.

04:20:14.520 --> 04:20:17.520
Oh, it'd be so cool if I could get them in, like, some art.

04:20:17.520 --> 04:20:20.520
And, like, in the background or, like, sitting on my desk.

04:20:20.520 --> 04:20:22.520
And I'm, like, very, like, evil-looking.

04:20:22.520 --> 04:20:24.520
And I'm just like, I've been expecting you.

04:20:24.520 --> 04:20:25.520
Harim.

04:20:25.520 --> 04:20:26.520
Harim.

04:20:29.520 --> 04:20:30.520
Took an app.

04:20:30.520 --> 04:20:31.520
You're still streaming?

04:20:31.520 --> 04:20:33.520
Is this endurance streaming?

04:20:33.520 --> 04:20:34.520
I just, like, streaming for a piece of time,

04:20:34.520 --> 04:20:36.520
because I don't have anything else to do.

04:20:36.520 --> 04:20:40.520
Although I could, like, play or, like, watch something.

04:20:43.520 --> 04:20:44.520
Shari, like, messes me.

04:20:44.520 --> 04:20:46.520
She's like, I'm so proud of you, my daughter.

04:20:46.520 --> 04:20:47.520
You're just, like, mommy.

04:20:47.520 --> 04:20:50.520
And I'm like, I don't even know if this is because of the endurance streaming.

04:20:51.520 --> 04:20:53.520
I'm not sure if it's because of the cat.

04:20:53.520 --> 04:20:54.520
Yeah.

04:21:05.520 --> 04:21:06.520
Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles?

04:21:06.520 --> 04:21:07.520
They're so tasty.

04:21:07.520 --> 04:21:08.520
Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles?

04:21:08.520 --> 04:21:09.520
They're so tasty.

04:21:22.520 --> 04:21:23.520
I didn't know that.

04:21:27.520 --> 04:21:30.520
Normally I stream for, like, at least three or four hours.

04:21:38.520 --> 04:21:40.520
Two if I'm not super tired.

04:21:45.520 --> 04:21:47.520
Like, streaming in general?

04:21:48.520 --> 04:21:50.520
I've been streaming for five hours now, apparently.

04:21:51.520 --> 04:21:53.520
My bar time starts up on the 17th.

04:21:58.520 --> 04:22:00.520
I'm very vegan, it was my car.

04:22:01.520 --> 04:22:02.520
Not wash was,

04:22:11.520 --> 04:22:13.320
probably responsible for the puppies.

I heard some.

04:29:22.940 --> 04:29:24.940
Why are you crying?

04:29:24.940 --> 04:29:26.940
Can you hear me out in the laundry room?

04:29:26.940 --> 04:29:28.940
What's up?

04:29:28.940 --> 04:29:32.940
I think he's bored and he was looking for a toy to play.

04:29:32.940 --> 04:29:34.940
He's like, ah!

04:29:34.940 --> 04:29:38.940
Yeah, you knocked your spring under the couch.

04:29:38.940 --> 04:29:40.940
There's like 20 under there.

04:29:40.940 --> 04:29:42.940
You and your sister.

04:29:42.940 --> 04:29:44.940
Portable stove and a big pot.

04:29:45.940 --> 04:29:48.940
She has a lot of good stuff.

04:29:48.940 --> 04:29:50.940
I don't even know what she puts in her chicken or stew.

04:29:50.940 --> 04:29:52.940
All I know is that it's slaps.

04:29:52.940 --> 04:29:54.940
My mom's really good at stews and soups and baking.

04:29:54.940 --> 04:29:56.940
Really like comfort-y foods.

04:30:04.940 --> 04:30:08.940
I'm sorry, I'm speaking in bun-speak because I'm happy because I have food.

04:30:08.940 --> 04:30:10.940
So my voice is a little bit higher.

04:30:14.940 --> 04:30:16.940
Mm-hmm.

04:30:24.940 --> 04:30:26.940
Is that autism?

04:30:26.940 --> 04:30:28.940
I don't know.

04:30:28.940 --> 04:30:32.940
And those can't compare to squish and ghetto crocs.

04:30:32.940 --> 04:30:36.940
He's making a buzzer with cat crimes.

04:30:38.940 --> 04:30:42.940
You don't have to follow your true voice to find something to pick you.

04:30:45.940 --> 04:30:48.940
Oh my God, I almost tore from the sriracha again.

04:30:52.940 --> 04:30:54.940
Oh my God, I hear my neighbors again.

04:30:54.940 --> 04:30:56.940
The soundproofing in my building is really bad.

04:31:02.940 --> 04:31:04.940
Also when I'm happy, I talk fast.

04:31:06.940 --> 04:31:08.940
Aside from a shabari, unless it's just your persona,

04:31:08.940 --> 04:31:12.940
what other things do you have at your comfortable sharing?

04:31:12.940 --> 04:31:14.940
Do you do a tierless stream of that stuff?

04:31:14.940 --> 04:31:16.940
Every membership?

04:31:18.940 --> 04:31:22.940
I don't really think I can talk about that on a normal YouTube video.

04:31:34.940 --> 04:31:36.940
I think?

04:31:36.940 --> 04:31:38.940
I did a kink tierless before.

04:31:38.940 --> 04:31:40.940
I don't know if it's floating around.

04:31:40.940 --> 04:31:42.940
A lot of it I lied about anyways,

04:31:42.940 --> 04:31:46.940
because I thought I was weird if I liked that stuff.

04:31:46.940 --> 04:31:48.940
So I'm like, oh yeah, this goes on the bottom,

04:31:48.940 --> 04:31:50.940
but now I'm like, I don't like it with shit.

04:31:58.940 --> 04:32:00.940
And just so you guys know,

04:32:00.940 --> 04:32:04.940
just because we were cast as certain characters,

04:32:04.940 --> 04:32:08.940
does that mean we officially have those kinks?

04:32:08.940 --> 04:32:12.940
Like, I'm a dom,

04:32:12.940 --> 04:32:14.940
but I wear shabari ropes.

04:32:14.940 --> 04:32:16.940
But I've actually never been tied up in shabari.

04:32:16.940 --> 04:32:18.940
I feel like I would like it,

04:32:18.940 --> 04:32:20.940
and that's why I wanted to research on it.

04:32:20.940 --> 04:32:22.940
I don't want to do membership streams,

04:32:22.940 --> 04:32:24.940
where I tie myself up in shabari, but yeah.

04:32:32.940 --> 04:32:34.940
I'm kind of just learning.

04:32:35.940 --> 04:32:38.940
And you guys are helping me learn.

04:32:40.940 --> 04:32:42.940
And being corrupted.

04:32:42.940 --> 04:32:44.940
As to your bionicles.

04:32:44.940 --> 04:32:46.940
Lying on the internet, how could I?

04:32:48.940 --> 04:32:50.940
No way that you were involved.

04:32:50.940 --> 04:32:52.940
Yeah, that's true. Some of you guys are major degenerates.

04:32:58.940 --> 04:33:00.940
Like the guy in my Marrow said.

04:33:00.940 --> 04:33:02.940
Never mind, I'm gonna put him on blast.

04:33:02.940 --> 04:33:04.940
He got his own stuff to deal with.

04:33:16.940 --> 04:33:18.940
Yeah, I won't kink shame.

04:33:24.940 --> 04:33:26.940
Some of you do deserve to be shamed.

04:33:28.940 --> 04:33:30.940
I haven't looked at my Marrows today though.

04:33:30.940 --> 04:33:32.940
I think it was all like one or two.

04:33:36.940 --> 04:33:39.940
I'll probably end up answering Marrows tomorrow instead of today.

04:33:42.940 --> 04:33:44.940
Alabama guy.

04:33:46.940 --> 04:33:48.940
You're my cats and macros.

04:33:52.940 --> 04:33:54.940
Because of my reaction, he's like,

04:33:54.940 --> 04:33:56.940
I'm not gonna watch you.

04:34:00.940 --> 04:34:02.940
I was mostly just a meming reaction if anything.

04:34:24.940 --> 04:34:26.940
I might be slightly daffy when I'm Marrows.

04:34:26.940 --> 04:34:28.940
Yeah, Marshmallow. It's almost like Curious Cat.

04:34:28.940 --> 04:34:30.940
Or you could like ask anonymous questions.

04:34:36.940 --> 04:34:38.940
Yeah, IRL, that's so true though.

04:34:38.940 --> 04:34:42.940
Cause I'm like, oh, if it's like anime, hentai based,

04:34:42.940 --> 04:34:44.940
I'm like, yeah, but if it's IRL,

04:34:44.940 --> 04:34:46.940
I'm like, wait a second.

04:34:48.940 --> 04:34:50.940
Just woke up, hello.

04:34:50.940 --> 04:34:52.940
We hanging out.

04:34:52.940 --> 04:34:54.940
Cause like,

04:34:54.940 --> 04:34:56.940
for example,

04:34:56.940 --> 04:34:58.940
I like monsters.

04:35:00.940 --> 04:35:02.940
I'm not gonna fuck a monster in real life.

04:35:04.940 --> 04:35:06.940
Cause one, they don't exist and two, out.

04:35:16.940 --> 04:35:18.940
It's all in Japanese though.

04:35:18.940 --> 04:35:20.940
Link is in the description if you want to try it.

04:35:20.940 --> 04:35:22.940
Yeah, yeah, it says Japanese,

04:35:22.940 --> 04:35:24.940
but you could like, usually depending on,

04:35:24.940 --> 04:35:26.940
like I, to be honest with you guys,

04:35:26.940 --> 04:35:28.940
I just answer all Marrows on my phone.

04:35:28.940 --> 04:35:30.940
Cause my phone,

04:35:30.940 --> 04:35:32.940
I mean, honestly, a lot of web pages just auto translate,

04:35:32.940 --> 04:35:34.940
like, or there'd be Cromer Safari.

04:35:34.940 --> 04:35:36.940
Oh my God, children are running in the hallway.

04:35:38.940 --> 04:35:40.940
It's over for Venom cells.

04:35:40.940 --> 04:35:42.940
Oh my God, Venom in the tongue.

04:35:46.940 --> 04:35:48.940
I haven't even watched the most recent one.

04:35:48.940 --> 04:35:50.940
What are your hobbies?

04:35:50.940 --> 04:35:52.940
It's important to know things when you're dating somebody.

04:35:54.940 --> 04:35:56.940
Well, it seems like you weren't paying attention

04:35:56.940 --> 04:35:58.940
to the first date that we had,

04:35:58.940 --> 04:36:00.940
which was my 2.0.

04:36:00.940 --> 04:36:02.940
So I'm kind of offended that you're not a good listener.

04:36:02.940 --> 04:36:04.940
Cause I talked to you all about all my hobbies in my 2.0.

04:36:08.940 --> 04:36:10.940
And usually when people say like,

04:36:10.940 --> 04:36:12.940
oh, keep this to yourself.

04:36:12.940 --> 04:36:14.940
Cause no matter what, usually

04:36:14.940 --> 04:36:16.940
I can answer Marrows.

04:36:18.940 --> 04:36:20.940
And they are public,

04:36:20.940 --> 04:36:22.940
unless you're logged in

04:36:22.940 --> 04:36:24.940
and then you can send them privately

04:36:24.940 --> 04:36:26.940
and I can respond privately.

04:36:28.940 --> 04:36:30.940
And I can present you like something

04:36:32.940 --> 04:36:34.940
like a pretty picture

04:36:34.940 --> 04:36:36.940
or video.

04:36:38.940 --> 04:36:40.940
But what if you were a rubber bunny?

04:36:40.940 --> 04:36:42.940
Like a rubber ducky?

04:36:42.940 --> 04:36:44.940
Huh?

04:36:46.940 --> 04:36:48.940
What's your favorite monster?

04:36:48.940 --> 04:36:50.940
I don't know why I keep joking.

04:36:52.940 --> 04:36:54.940
Movie from a TV show?

04:36:54.940 --> 04:36:56.940
Oh, alien? The alien from alien?

04:36:58.940 --> 04:37:00.940
Do other people see the Marrow sent to you?

04:37:00.940 --> 04:37:02.940
It's private unless you respond.

04:37:02.940 --> 04:37:04.940
It's private unless they respond.

04:37:04.940 --> 04:37:06.940
And then sometimes you guys will say stuff

04:37:06.940 --> 04:37:08.940
and you're not logged in.

04:37:08.940 --> 04:37:10.940
So if I respond, it will be made public.

04:37:10.940 --> 04:37:12.940
Ow.

04:37:12.940 --> 04:37:14.940
But to remind you,

04:37:14.940 --> 04:37:16.940
it's anonymous no matter what.

04:37:16.940 --> 04:37:18.940
If you have a username, I can't see it.

04:37:18.940 --> 04:37:20.940
But

04:37:22.940 --> 04:37:24.940
if you are not logged in

04:37:24.940 --> 04:37:26.940
and you send me something

04:37:26.940 --> 04:37:28.940
that has a sense of stuff in it,

04:37:28.940 --> 04:37:30.940
I can't...

04:37:30.940 --> 04:37:32.940
I'm not going to respond

04:37:32.940 --> 04:37:34.940
because if I respond, it's going to

04:37:36.940 --> 04:37:38.940
show everybody else what you said.

04:37:38.940 --> 04:37:40.940
So I'm not going to do that to you.

04:37:40.940 --> 04:37:42.940
So sometimes it will be like, oh,

04:37:42.940 --> 04:37:44.940
she didn't respond to my Marrow

04:37:44.940 --> 04:37:46.940
or what I said to her.

04:37:46.940 --> 04:37:48.940
It's because you weren't logged in

04:37:48.940 --> 04:37:50.940
and it was really sensitive

04:37:50.940 --> 04:37:52.940
and I don't know if you want other people

04:37:52.940 --> 04:37:54.940
to see what you sent me.

04:37:56.940 --> 04:37:58.940
My hobbies?

04:37:58.940 --> 04:38:00.940
Do you like to play video games?

04:38:00.940 --> 04:38:02.940
Go for a long run across the beach?

04:38:02.940 --> 04:38:04.940
I like to play instruments.

04:38:04.940 --> 04:38:06.940
Okay.

04:38:06.940 --> 04:38:08.940
Okay.

04:38:08.940 --> 04:38:10.940
Marrow is so hot.

04:38:10.940 --> 04:38:12.940
Is the rock so hot? No, I just...

04:38:12.940 --> 04:38:14.940
I just choked.

04:38:14.940 --> 04:38:16.940
Now I have something stuck in my throat.

04:38:18.940 --> 04:38:20.940
Oh, the A.I.

04:38:20.940 --> 04:38:22.940
Yeah, the A.I. also filters stuff.

04:38:22.940 --> 04:38:24.940
Cat box link

04:38:24.940 --> 04:38:26.940
waxes to the public. I almost did that once.

04:38:26.940 --> 04:38:28.940
I think I sent you an Instagram

04:38:28.940 --> 04:38:30.940
link on Marrow.

04:38:32.940 --> 04:38:34.940
I've said this before in my Marows.

04:38:34.940 --> 04:38:36.940
I feel like I'm from...

04:38:39.940 --> 04:38:41.940
I'm Nick Cage from National Treasure

04:38:41.940 --> 04:38:43.940
trying to put these links together

04:38:43.940 --> 04:38:45.940
so I can understand what you guys are trying to send to me.

04:38:45.940 --> 04:38:47.940
And then you guys send me litter box ones

04:38:47.940 --> 04:38:49.940
and I can't...

04:38:49.940 --> 04:38:51.940
I can't...

04:38:53.940 --> 04:38:55.940
I can't see them the next day

04:38:55.940 --> 04:38:57.940
when I'm not responding immediately

04:38:57.940 --> 04:38:59.940
because it only has like two hours.

04:39:05.940 --> 04:39:07.940
Why are you role playing?

04:39:10.940 --> 04:39:12.940
I'm sorry, this is funny.

04:39:14.940 --> 04:39:16.940
Marrow is a pain for cat box lately.

04:39:16.940 --> 04:39:18.940
Well, cat box has been like

04:39:18.940 --> 04:39:20.940
not working properly

04:39:20.940 --> 04:39:22.940
because I know like Shawnee used to use cat box a lot.

04:39:22.940 --> 04:39:24.940
Yeah, nobody uses cat box anymore

04:39:24.940 --> 04:39:26.940
because it's just like not...

04:39:26.940 --> 04:39:28.940
like sometimes cat box will just break.

04:39:29.940 --> 04:39:31.940
Why do we have therapists here?

04:39:31.940 --> 04:39:33.940
I don't know.

04:39:34.940 --> 04:39:36.940
Do you want me to be your therapist for a moment?

04:39:36.940 --> 04:39:38.940
Let's become more parasocial.

04:39:38.940 --> 04:39:40.940
It's up to you.

04:39:43.940 --> 04:39:45.940
A little bite.

04:39:55.940 --> 04:39:57.940
I haven't seen the...

04:39:58.940 --> 04:40:00.940
Freddie Fazbear guy.

04:40:00.940 --> 04:40:02.940
I'm just a bummer

04:40:02.940 --> 04:40:05.940
because I like reading his comments in my Gregory voice.

04:40:08.940 --> 04:40:10.940
If you're gonna role play

04:40:10.940 --> 04:40:13.940
at least type correctly

04:40:18.940 --> 04:40:20.940
your grammar is atrocious

04:40:20.940 --> 04:40:22.940
and it's disappointing to me

04:40:23.940 --> 04:40:26.940
this date is over if you don't have proper grammar.

04:40:26.940 --> 04:40:28.940
I was kidding, I don't talk in proper grammar.

04:40:28.940 --> 04:40:30.940
At least put in some effort, man.

04:40:32.940 --> 04:40:34.940
I'm just kidding.

04:40:34.940 --> 04:40:36.940
Any case, if I can add a parasocial

04:40:36.940 --> 04:40:38.940
right up on top of everything.

04:40:38.940 --> 04:40:40.940
I don't know, we're just here to hang out.

04:40:40.940 --> 04:40:42.940
You don't have to be parasocial.

04:40:42.940 --> 04:40:44.940
Like for me a parasocial

04:40:44.940 --> 04:40:46.940
because I'm only like talking to you guys.

04:40:46.940 --> 04:40:48.940
Like I could have logged out hours ago

04:40:48.940 --> 04:40:50.940
and stopped streaming

04:40:50.940 --> 04:40:52.940
but I just like hanging out

04:40:52.940 --> 04:40:54.940
because I like people to talk to.

04:41:02.940 --> 04:41:05.940
It fucking got me, Jesus Christ.

04:41:11.940 --> 04:41:13.940
I did not read the full sentence.

04:41:14.940 --> 04:41:16.940
That's funny.

04:41:18.940 --> 04:41:20.940
I actually really like

04:41:20.940 --> 04:41:22.940
I would 100%

04:41:22.940 --> 04:41:24.940
fuck any of the animatronics

04:41:24.940 --> 04:41:26.940
from that

04:41:26.940 --> 04:41:28.940
iteration

04:41:28.940 --> 04:41:30.940
of Five Nights at Freddy's.

04:41:31.940 --> 04:41:33.940
What is it?

04:41:34.940 --> 04:41:36.940
Is it the glam rock?

04:41:37.940 --> 04:41:39.940
Like rock is kind of hot

04:41:39.940 --> 04:41:41.940
and so is Freddy.

04:41:42.940 --> 04:41:44.940
Especially Monty.

04:41:45.940 --> 04:41:48.940
I can't remember the other ones.

04:41:52.940 --> 04:41:54.940
Chica.

04:41:54.940 --> 04:41:56.940
Chica is kind of, you know, she kind of

04:41:56.940 --> 04:41:58.940
she's a little bit, she's a bit loka.

04:41:59.940 --> 04:42:01.940
So the question is

04:42:01.940 --> 04:42:03.940
are you, fuck, I can't read that.

04:42:03.940 --> 04:42:04.940
Are you dominating them?

04:42:04.940 --> 04:42:06.940
Are you the one getting dominated?

04:42:07.940 --> 04:42:09.940
I'm not answering that.

04:42:09.940 --> 04:42:11.940
You don't need to know.

04:42:11.940 --> 04:42:13.940
Gregory, if you want to escape

04:42:13.940 --> 04:42:15.940
you need to donate at least $30

04:42:15.940 --> 04:42:17.940
to SheebieCarve.

04:42:17.940 --> 04:42:21.940
Please, Sheebie, look at my marrows.

04:42:21.940 --> 04:42:23.940
I put my tiny peepee in cat box

04:42:23.940 --> 04:42:25.940
so you can make fun of me, please.

04:42:26.940 --> 04:42:29.940
Chica eats garbage, just like me.

04:42:29.940 --> 04:42:31.940
He's just like me for real, for real.

04:42:34.940 --> 04:42:36.940
Where you probably got pneumatic dong?

04:42:37.940 --> 04:42:39.940
Let me be silly for a second.

04:42:39.940 --> 04:42:41.940
So a lot of my OCs

04:42:41.940 --> 04:42:43.940
were 100% like tulpas.

04:42:45.940 --> 04:42:47.940
When I was growing up and I would draw my OCs

04:42:47.940 --> 04:42:49.940
I would just like talk to them in my head

04:42:49.940 --> 04:42:50.940
because they were real.

04:42:50.940 --> 04:42:52.940
It would be just like a little schizophrenic and everything.

04:42:53.940 --> 04:42:55.940
I can't wait to cut this out of the vlog.

04:43:04.940 --> 04:43:06.940
His name was Zero and he was an android.

04:43:07.940 --> 04:43:10.940
I'm a pent-up religious Christian girl

04:43:10.940 --> 04:43:12.940
with OCs and I draw,

04:43:12.940 --> 04:43:14.940
so I would just draw smut of me and my OCs.

04:43:16.940 --> 04:43:19.940
I need to stop talking in my cute and funny voice.

04:43:19.940 --> 04:43:21.940
I'm sorry.

04:43:22.940 --> 04:43:24.940
My peepee.

04:43:26.940 --> 04:43:30.940
And he had a go-go gadget peepee.

04:43:31.940 --> 04:43:33.940
I wrote an OC name Zero.

04:43:33.940 --> 04:43:35.940
I probably could draw him again and I had another OC.

04:43:37.940 --> 04:43:39.940
His name was,

04:43:39.940 --> 04:43:41.940
he was my sole eater OC.

04:43:42.940 --> 04:43:44.940
So I had,

04:43:45.940 --> 04:43:47.940
it would be really funny if the girl that I used to role-play with

04:43:47.940 --> 04:43:49.940
with our OCs all together

04:43:49.940 --> 04:43:51.940
because she was like my best friend.

04:43:51.940 --> 04:43:53.940
She would totally like VTubers and if she comes across this,

04:43:53.940 --> 04:43:56.940
I will actually probably pass away from this earth

04:43:57.940 --> 04:43:59.940
if she recognizes who I am.

04:44:00.940 --> 04:44:02.940
But I had another character.

04:44:03.940 --> 04:44:05.940
He was my weapon.

04:44:05.940 --> 04:44:07.940
So my OC was Kiri.

04:44:07.940 --> 04:44:09.940
Kiri was,

04:44:10.940 --> 04:44:13.940
she was essentially me but she had pink hair.

04:44:13.940 --> 04:44:16.940
She's very cute, very pastel goff.

04:44:16.940 --> 04:44:20.940
And then James Sinner was her

04:44:20.940 --> 04:44:22.940
weapon.

04:44:22.940 --> 04:44:24.940
And he was a scythe.

04:44:24.940 --> 04:44:26.940
And he was kind of like almost like

04:44:26.940 --> 04:44:28.940
he got a scythe from Akatsuki

04:44:28.940 --> 04:44:30.940
from Naruto.

04:44:30.940 --> 04:44:32.940
And he had like three

04:44:34.940 --> 04:44:36.940
three blades.

04:44:36.940 --> 04:44:38.940
And he also had like three beauty marks on his face.

04:44:40.940 --> 04:44:42.940
And he had bright red hair.

04:44:44.940 --> 04:44:46.940
And his family

04:44:46.940 --> 04:44:48.940
were all

04:44:48.940 --> 04:44:50.940
representations

04:44:50.940 --> 04:44:52.940
of the seven license.

04:44:54.940 --> 04:44:56.940
He was pretty, he was pretty sick.

04:44:58.940 --> 04:45:00.940
Which out of the viewer girlies

04:45:00.940 --> 04:45:02.940
would pull up pastel goff?

04:45:02.940 --> 04:45:04.940
Look, I would say Icy.

04:45:10.940 --> 04:45:12.940
Just checking, you mentioned people

04:45:12.940 --> 04:45:14.940
setting a sense of contramarrow.

04:45:14.940 --> 04:45:16.940
I appreciate it.

04:45:16.940 --> 04:45:18.940
Every time I like tributes, I accept those.

04:45:18.940 --> 04:45:20.940
I don't mind.

04:45:22.940 --> 04:45:24.940
I may, I don't respond right away.

04:45:26.940 --> 04:45:28.940
I like kitty on Twitter, she's adorable.

04:45:28.940 --> 04:45:30.940
Yeah.

04:45:30.940 --> 04:45:32.940
I don't mind them, I like videos.

04:45:36.940 --> 04:45:38.940
Am I supposed, am I not supposed to be saying the quieter part out loud?

04:45:44.940 --> 04:45:46.940
Are my kitty's there? Okay.

04:45:46.940 --> 04:45:48.940
Oh, chilling.

04:45:48.940 --> 04:45:50.940
Oh, Mercy, she's not fit for the goff thing.

04:45:50.940 --> 04:45:52.940
Yeah, pastel goff is different though.

04:45:52.940 --> 04:45:54.940
She would be, if anyone's so like,

04:45:54.940 --> 04:45:56.940
I can like bright, so like

04:45:58.940 --> 04:46:00.940
excuse me, Emmy would be just emo goff,

04:46:00.940 --> 04:46:02.940
like a typical goff.

04:46:06.940 --> 04:46:08.940
Mercy would be a seeing goff.

04:46:08.940 --> 04:46:10.940
Icy would be pastel goff.

04:46:10.940 --> 04:46:12.940
Icy

04:46:14.940 --> 04:46:16.940
would be

04:46:16.940 --> 04:46:18.940
just normal goff,

04:46:18.940 --> 04:46:20.940
like Dami mommy alternative

04:46:20.940 --> 04:46:22.940
black girl goff.

04:46:24.940 --> 04:46:26.940
And then I would

04:46:26.940 --> 04:46:28.940
I don't know what type of goff I would be

04:46:28.940 --> 04:46:30.940
to be honest with you.

04:46:32.940 --> 04:46:34.940
I didn't think about that.

04:46:36.940 --> 04:46:38.940
What does not

04:46:38.940 --> 04:46:40.940
being per socialist or king

04:46:40.940 --> 04:46:42.940
around in the gathering of different

04:46:42.940 --> 04:46:44.940
what the fuck are you saying, dude?

04:46:48.940 --> 04:46:50.940
Are you wearing a fedora right now?

04:46:54.940 --> 04:46:56.940
Base goff. Yeah.

04:46:56.940 --> 04:46:58.940
I'll be one of those like industrial goffs.

04:47:00.940 --> 04:47:02.940
Like, you know those like goffs that like the dancing goffs

04:47:02.940 --> 04:47:04.940
and that one meme and them.

04:47:04.940 --> 04:47:06.940
I'll be shuffling.

04:47:09.940 --> 04:47:11.940
Superstar DJ.

04:47:13.940 --> 04:47:15.940
It was funny when we were

04:47:15.940 --> 04:47:17.940
me and Icy and manager

04:47:17.940 --> 04:47:19.940
and the other girls were talking about like her DJ set.

04:47:19.940 --> 04:47:21.940
We were talking about like

04:47:23.940 --> 04:47:25.940
shuffling and stuff and we

04:47:25.940 --> 04:47:27.940
and then managers post that song

04:47:27.940 --> 04:47:29.940
with the OG like

04:47:29.940 --> 04:47:31.940
Sydney shuffle, I think what it's called

04:47:31.940 --> 04:47:33.940
video and I'm like, oh my fucking god, then be

04:47:33.940 --> 04:47:35.940
and Icy were just fucking jamming.

04:47:35.940 --> 04:47:37.940
We're just like don't don't don't don't don't

04:47:37.940 --> 04:47:39.940
don't don't

04:47:39.940 --> 04:47:41.940
don't don't don't don't

04:47:41.940 --> 04:47:43.940
don't don't don't

04:47:43.940 --> 04:47:45.940
I can't shuffle. I used to be able to shuffle.

04:47:46.940 --> 04:47:48.940
Vampires in the club scene.

04:47:48.940 --> 04:47:50.940
Oh, no, actually, I would be

04:47:50.940 --> 04:47:52.940
the true blood goff.

04:47:52.940 --> 04:47:54.940
Like I would be like fantasia.

04:47:55.940 --> 04:47:57.940
One Eric Northman

04:47:57.940 --> 04:47:59.940
is.

04:47:59.940 --> 04:48:01.940
I love him

04:48:01.940 --> 04:48:03.940
and

04:48:03.940 --> 04:48:05.940
his

04:48:05.940 --> 04:48:07.940
prod her knee. She was pretty hot too. I can't remember her name.

04:48:09.940 --> 04:48:11.940
The second I'm dancing vampire game.

04:48:11.940 --> 04:48:13.940
Yeah, that's my seed.

04:48:13.940 --> 04:48:15.940
Wow. Can you put it that way?

04:48:15.940 --> 04:48:17.940
Either way is fine. How long will he have?

04:48:20.940 --> 04:48:22.940
Can someone help him?

04:48:23.940 --> 04:48:25.940
It can someone.

04:48:27.940 --> 04:48:29.940
What bro?

04:48:29.940 --> 04:48:31.940
Bro, it's tweaking.

04:48:31.940 --> 04:48:33.940
Are you?

04:48:33.940 --> 04:48:35.940
Are you?

04:48:35.940 --> 04:48:37.940
I know English is probably just not their first language.

04:48:41.940 --> 04:48:43.940
I am wonder.

04:48:43.940 --> 04:48:45.940
I wonder what would happen if a werewolf

04:48:45.940 --> 04:48:47.940
and a vampire hook up? How would that work?

04:48:47.940 --> 04:48:49.940
I'm very curious for your answer.

04:48:49.940 --> 04:48:51.940
They would probably just hook up normally.

04:48:51.940 --> 04:48:53.940
I don't know.

04:48:57.940 --> 04:48:59.940
I think they would just hook up normally.

04:49:01.940 --> 04:49:03.940
I don't think the wolf is going into wolf form

04:49:03.940 --> 04:49:05.940
although

04:49:05.940 --> 04:49:07.940
maybe I don't fucking know.

04:49:07.940 --> 04:49:09.940
That's forbidden but that's true.

04:49:09.940 --> 04:49:11.940
You know, it's a little Romeo and Julie at moment.

04:49:13.940 --> 04:49:15.940
There's too much DMT.

04:49:19.940 --> 04:49:21.940
Wolf vampire hybrids?

04:49:21.940 --> 04:49:23.940
I am wonder.

04:49:23.940 --> 04:49:25.940
Not now again.

04:49:25.940 --> 04:49:27.940
Mr. Wolf

04:49:27.940 --> 04:49:29.940
I think it's time to sleep.

04:49:31.940 --> 04:49:33.940
Hold on.

04:49:33.940 --> 04:49:35.940
What's that?

04:49:35.940 --> 04:49:37.940
So SZA

04:49:37.940 --> 04:49:39.940
What is the party over?

04:49:39.940 --> 04:49:41.940
Get your ass to bed. You got school tomorrow.

04:49:41.940 --> 04:49:43.940
Let's take a talk. Hi Rena.

04:49:43.940 --> 04:49:45.940
You gonna come up here?

04:49:47.940 --> 04:49:49.940
Miss Rena

04:49:51.940 --> 04:49:53.940
Hey, could you not?

04:49:53.940 --> 04:49:55.940
You guys are bad.

04:49:57.940 --> 04:49:59.940
Well, when a werewolf and a vampire

04:49:59.940 --> 04:50:01.940
love each other very much, they give each other a special hug.

04:50:03.940 --> 04:50:05.940
Honestly, if I ever had a child

04:50:05.940 --> 04:50:07.940
I would probably explain it like that.

04:50:09.940 --> 04:50:11.940
I don't know why my model is lying.

04:50:11.940 --> 04:50:13.940
Usually around this time my internet just like fucking dies.

04:50:15.940 --> 04:50:17.940
Will I sleep? I think I'll sleep.

04:50:17.940 --> 04:50:19.940
I didn't sleep.

04:50:19.940 --> 04:50:21.940
I didn't sleep.

04:50:21.940 --> 04:50:23.940
Yesterday

04:50:23.940 --> 04:50:25.940
So

04:50:25.940 --> 04:50:27.940
I am not.

04:50:27.940 --> 04:50:29.940
Oh my god, not.

04:50:29.940 --> 04:50:31.940
I mean, the real question is

04:50:31.940 --> 04:50:33.940
Where will fuck the vampire human formable form?

04:50:33.940 --> 04:50:35.940
I think it's funny because I got one of those toys

04:50:35.940 --> 04:50:37.940
and people were like

04:50:37.940 --> 04:50:39.940
So should we must really like dogs?

04:50:39.940 --> 04:50:41.940
No, what the fuck is wrong with you?

04:50:45.940 --> 04:50:47.940
My marrow is like hey

04:50:47.940 --> 04:50:49.940
You like dogs?

04:50:49.940 --> 04:50:51.940
And I'm like

04:50:51.940 --> 04:50:53.940
I'm not Whitney Wisconsin dude

04:50:53.940 --> 04:50:55.940
I made the joke before, I'll say it again.

04:50:57.940 --> 04:50:59.940
Call her a leisure for you guys exactly.

04:51:01.940 --> 04:51:03.940
Bark

04:51:03.940 --> 04:51:05.940
Bark for me

04:51:11.940 --> 04:51:13.940
Sorry, you just know many times.

04:51:15.940 --> 04:51:17.940
Good puppies, good puppies.

04:51:19.940 --> 04:51:21.940
Do you need to go outside and do pee pee?

04:51:21.940 --> 04:51:23.940
Do you need to do pee pee puppy?

04:51:23.940 --> 04:51:25.940
A lot of you guys asked me to talk to you like I talk to my cats.

04:51:29.940 --> 04:51:31.940
Rina, Rina, what are you doing?

04:51:31.940 --> 04:51:33.940
Are you purring?

04:51:33.940 --> 04:51:35.940
Are you gonna purr for stream?

04:51:35.940 --> 04:51:37.940
Reapers?

04:51:49.940 --> 04:51:51.940
Rina

04:51:55.940 --> 04:51:57.940
Oh to be a cat

04:52:01.940 --> 04:52:03.940
She's a smugly.

04:52:03.940 --> 04:52:05.940
Based on the cult stream we

04:52:05.940 --> 04:52:07.940
Hi guys, we're just not finishing your sentences.

04:52:07.940 --> 04:52:09.940
Yeah, I saw that.

04:52:09.940 --> 04:52:11.940
I saw that. I saw that.

04:52:11.940 --> 04:52:13.940
Adorable.

04:52:13.940 --> 04:52:15.940
Rina is my soul kitty.

04:52:15.940 --> 04:52:17.940
She's my best friend.

04:52:17.940 --> 04:52:19.940
My mom

04:52:19.940 --> 04:52:21.940
And

04:52:21.940 --> 04:52:23.940
Me went to go pick up her and her sister.

04:52:23.940 --> 04:52:25.940
Her sister has passed away a couple years ago.

04:52:25.940 --> 04:52:27.940
She was 11.

04:52:29.940 --> 04:52:31.940
We went to the cat breeder.

04:52:33.940 --> 04:52:35.940
Sorry, I got you my nose.

04:52:35.940 --> 04:52:37.940
And they're like

04:52:37.940 --> 04:52:39.940
Oh yeah, these are the kittens that were reserved for you.

04:52:39.940 --> 04:52:41.940
We went to a cat breeder because we had to

04:52:41.940 --> 04:52:43.940
My mom has allergies so she wanted to make sure they were fine.

04:52:43.940 --> 04:52:45.940
Although

04:52:45.940 --> 04:52:47.940
Fia and Bumi don't even give me allergies.

04:52:47.940 --> 04:52:49.940
Rina does.

04:52:49.940 --> 04:52:51.940
So what was up with that?

04:52:53.940 --> 04:52:55.940
Yeah, it's always an awesome cat.

04:52:55.940 --> 04:52:57.940
She was a great cat. She was like a dog.

04:52:57.940 --> 04:52:59.940
It was funny. She was my fetch.

04:52:59.940 --> 04:53:01.940
She would like work at you.

04:53:05.940 --> 04:53:07.940
But I held Rina

04:53:07.940 --> 04:53:09.940
And I knew she was

04:53:09.940 --> 04:53:11.940
Gonna be my best friend.

04:53:11.940 --> 04:53:13.940
And

04:53:13.940 --> 04:53:15.940
And I just held her like a little baby

04:53:15.940 --> 04:53:17.940
And she was in my arm. She just looked at me

04:53:17.940 --> 04:53:19.940
And she just purred.

04:53:19.940 --> 04:53:21.940
And I'm like, yep.

04:53:21.940 --> 04:53:23.940
And she has been

04:53:23.940 --> 04:53:25.940
Back to me like glue ever since.

04:53:25.940 --> 04:53:27.940
I'm gonna be very sad when she passes.

04:53:27.940 --> 04:53:29.940
Cause she's getting up in age.

04:53:29.940 --> 04:53:31.940
And she has, like, I saw the kittens and stuff.

04:53:31.940 --> 04:53:33.940
So I just wanted to be happy

04:53:33.940 --> 04:53:35.940
And healthy.

04:53:35.940 --> 04:53:37.940
Yeah

04:53:37.940 --> 04:53:39.940
She was 11

04:53:39.940 --> 04:53:41.940
She was a seal point Siamese

04:53:41.940 --> 04:53:43.940
So she was the typical

04:53:43.940 --> 04:53:45.940
Siamese that you see.

04:53:45.940 --> 04:53:47.940
They're Applehead Siamese

04:53:47.940 --> 04:53:49.940
They're not Oriental Siamese

04:53:49.940 --> 04:53:51.940
Which are those

04:53:51.940 --> 04:53:53.940
The ones from Lady and the Tramp

04:53:53.940 --> 04:53:55.940
Which are like the really

04:53:55.940 --> 04:53:57.940
Skinny looking ones.

04:53:59.940 --> 04:54:01.940
Oriental cats are so cute though.

04:54:01.940 --> 04:54:03.940
They're kind of like goofy looking with their muzzles.

04:54:06.940 --> 04:54:08.940
Almost have a future status.

04:54:08.940 --> 04:54:11.940
But then I like think and I think all the

04:54:11.940 --> 04:54:13.940
Sorry, my voice is broke for a second.

04:54:13.940 --> 04:54:15.940
All the

04:54:15.940 --> 04:54:17.940
Memories are just so worth it.

04:54:17.940 --> 04:54:19.940
And you give them like a good little life.

04:54:19.940 --> 04:54:21.940
Cause I rescued Fia and Bumi.

04:54:21.940 --> 04:54:23.940
They initially came from Mississippi

04:54:23.940 --> 04:54:25.940
In the south

04:54:25.940 --> 04:54:27.940
They're not actually related.

04:54:27.940 --> 04:54:29.940
They're a month apart.

04:54:29.940 --> 04:54:31.940
They're not from the same litter.

04:54:31.940 --> 04:54:33.940
I just refer to them as the twins, brother and sister. Cause they act like it.

04:54:33.940 --> 04:54:35.940
And yeah

04:54:35.940 --> 04:54:37.940
Fia's sister died

04:54:37.940 --> 04:54:39.940
When they were kittens

04:54:39.940 --> 04:54:41.940
And that's why I was very determined

04:54:41.940 --> 04:54:43.940
To make sure Fia was okay.

04:54:43.940 --> 04:54:45.940
And then Bumi

04:54:47.940 --> 04:54:49.940
Came from a litter of like six kittens

04:54:49.940 --> 04:54:51.940
And they were just like found on the street.

04:54:53.940 --> 04:54:55.940
Yeah, it's really

04:54:55.940 --> 04:54:57.940
It is really devastating losing a pet. Cause they're like

04:54:57.940 --> 04:54:59.940
People are like oh, but if you never had a pet

04:54:59.940 --> 04:55:01.940
You don't get it, but like they really are part of the family.

04:55:03.940 --> 04:55:05.940
I like cats because

04:55:05.940 --> 04:55:07.940
A lot of their stuff is instinctual

04:55:07.940 --> 04:55:09.940
And I don't have to train them to do anything

04:55:09.940 --> 04:55:11.940
Although it is very impressive that I managed to

04:55:11.940 --> 04:55:13.940
Create train Fia and Bumi

04:55:15.940 --> 04:55:17.940
I don't know how that works, but

04:55:17.940 --> 04:55:19.940
You can create train a cat

04:55:23.940 --> 04:55:25.940
Cats are pretty independent

04:55:25.940 --> 04:55:27.940
They clean themselves

04:55:27.940 --> 04:55:29.940
They groom themselves

04:55:29.940 --> 04:55:31.940
Use the bathroom

04:55:31.940 --> 04:55:33.940
And what you really gotta do is feed them

04:55:33.940 --> 04:55:35.940
And give them toys

04:55:35.940 --> 04:55:37.940
In a nice comfy bed

04:55:39.940 --> 04:55:41.940
Yeah, and they can be pretty independent

04:55:43.940 --> 04:55:45.940
Family have had seven cats

04:55:45.940 --> 04:55:47.940
To all the creature

04:55:47.940 --> 04:55:49.940
My friend has 20 cats

04:55:49.940 --> 04:55:51.940
He thought I was a cat lady

04:55:51.940 --> 04:55:53.940
She has 20 cats

04:55:55.940 --> 04:55:57.940
And she just got like

04:55:57.940 --> 04:55:59.940
Four more

04:55:59.940 --> 04:56:01.940
So like 20 are at her parents house

04:56:01.940 --> 04:56:03.940
And then she moved out and she got four cats of her own

04:56:05.940 --> 04:56:07.940
I'm like girl, you need to stop

04:56:09.940 --> 04:56:11.940
Yeah

04:56:11.940 --> 04:56:13.940
And they have like

04:56:13.940 --> 04:56:15.940
Her and her boyfriend

04:56:15.940 --> 04:56:17.940
They're building like a

04:56:17.940 --> 04:56:19.940
Like a cat patio

04:56:19.940 --> 04:56:21.940
Or a cat room for all the cats

04:56:21.940 --> 04:56:23.940
And I'm like, honestly, he's a real one for that

04:56:23.940 --> 04:56:25.940
I don't think anybody I meet

04:56:25.940 --> 04:56:27.940
Would help me make one of those

04:56:29.940 --> 04:56:31.940
I

04:56:31.940 --> 04:56:33.940
I mean

04:56:33.940 --> 04:56:35.940
He just looks at me up with me

04:56:35.940 --> 04:56:37.940
With her big blue eyes

04:56:37.940 --> 04:56:39.940
How do they take care of all of them?

04:56:39.940 --> 04:56:41.940
I think, uh

04:56:41.940 --> 04:56:43.940
I don't know, to be honest

04:56:43.940 --> 04:56:45.940
It's really just like, again, staying on top of the litter boxes

04:56:45.940 --> 04:56:47.940
And then feeding them

04:56:47.940 --> 04:56:49.940
So I'm making sure they have like clean water

04:56:49.940 --> 04:56:51.940
And toys

04:56:51.940 --> 04:56:53.940
And like brushing

04:56:53.940 --> 04:56:55.940
The ones that need to be brushed

04:56:55.940 --> 04:56:57.940
I brush Rena a lot more often now

04:56:57.940 --> 04:56:59.940
Although she's a short-haired cat

04:56:59.940 --> 04:57:01.940
She's been shedding a lot more

04:57:01.940 --> 04:57:03.940
Because it's around the summer

04:57:03.940 --> 04:57:05.940
And she tends to get hairballs

04:57:05.940 --> 04:57:07.940
And Rena also likes to fucking eat my hair when I sleep

04:57:09.940 --> 04:57:11.940
Two, four snakes and two leopard geckers

04:57:11.940 --> 04:57:13.940
That's really cool

04:57:13.940 --> 04:57:15.940
I always wanted a snake

04:57:15.940 --> 04:57:17.940
My parents said no

04:57:19.940 --> 04:57:21.940
I wanted a ball python

04:57:21.940 --> 04:57:23.940
And I also wanted tarantulas

04:57:23.940 --> 04:57:25.940
And my mom was like, nope

04:57:25.940 --> 04:57:27.940
What about isopods?

04:57:27.940 --> 04:57:29.940
And my mom was like, what the fuck is an isopod?

04:57:29.940 --> 04:57:31.940
I'm like, it's a really pulley

04:57:31.940 --> 04:57:33.940
She's like, you can keep it outside

04:57:33.940 --> 04:57:35.940
And I'm like, that doesn't make any sense

04:57:35.940 --> 04:57:37.940
She's like, exactly, why would you want one?

04:57:39.940 --> 04:57:41.940
Two ball pythons on morphs

04:57:43.940 --> 04:57:45.940
My friend had a

04:57:45.940 --> 04:57:47.940
Wild type

04:57:47.940 --> 04:57:49.940
Ball python in a

04:57:49.940 --> 04:57:51.940
Albino corn snake

04:57:51.940 --> 04:57:53.940
They're pretty cool

04:57:53.940 --> 04:57:55.940
She had to give them away to her

04:57:55.940 --> 04:57:57.940
Friend though, when she moved though

04:57:57.940 --> 04:57:59.940
Well, actually not her friend

04:57:59.940 --> 04:58:01.940
To her, her cousin

04:58:01.940 --> 04:58:03.940
Really pulley, they're called isopods

04:58:03.940 --> 04:58:05.940
Yeah, they're invertebrates

04:58:05.940 --> 04:58:07.940
There's actually a lot of different types of them

04:58:07.940 --> 04:58:09.940
My favorite is the ducky isopod

04:58:09.940 --> 04:58:11.940
They look like little ducks

04:58:13.940 --> 04:58:15.940
Do you do out yellow pythons?

04:58:15.940 --> 04:58:17.940
Like a Burmese python?

04:58:17.940 --> 04:58:19.940
They're kind of

04:58:19.940 --> 04:58:21.940
I think Burmese pythons

04:58:21.940 --> 04:58:23.940
Are very gorgeous

04:58:23.940 --> 04:58:25.940
But they're very invasive

04:58:25.940 --> 04:58:27.940
Especially in Florida

04:58:27.940 --> 04:58:29.940
People just release them

04:58:29.940 --> 04:58:31.940
So they've really kind of ruined their ecosystem down there

04:58:35.940 --> 04:58:37.940
All the snakes and cats don't get along

04:58:37.940 --> 04:58:39.940
Yeah, my friend also

04:58:39.940 --> 04:58:41.940
Had gotten cats too

04:58:41.940 --> 04:58:43.940
So that's another reason

04:58:43.940 --> 04:58:45.940
Actually, they would kind of just sit and watch the snake

04:58:45.940 --> 04:58:47.940
But then at some point

04:58:47.940 --> 04:58:49.940
They just knew it was better

04:58:49.940 --> 04:58:51.940
You don't want to stress out the snake

04:58:51.940 --> 04:58:53.940
You be such a big girl

04:58:53.940 --> 04:58:55.940
Thank you

04:58:55.940 --> 04:58:57.940
I'm a bug girl, yeah

04:58:57.940 --> 04:58:59.940
Hog noses are so cute

04:58:59.940 --> 04:59:01.940
I remember me and my dad

04:59:01.940 --> 04:59:03.940
Begging my mom to get a hog nose

04:59:05.940 --> 04:59:07.940
I can't remember what my dad wanted to name it

04:59:07.940 --> 04:59:09.940
Like Miss Piggy or something

04:59:09.940 --> 04:59:11.940
One's a pie ball, then that's a pastel champagne lesser

04:59:11.940 --> 04:59:13.940
Ooh, pretty

04:59:13.940 --> 04:59:15.940
I remember I wanted a pie ball so bad

04:59:15.940 --> 04:59:17.940
And keeping

04:59:17.940 --> 04:59:19.940
And keeping is cool

04:59:19.940 --> 04:59:21.940
Occasionally that like one

04:59:21.940 --> 04:59:23.940
What's that guy's name

04:59:23.940 --> 04:59:25.940
He like does a lot of

04:59:25.940 --> 04:59:27.940
He has this whole like bioactive enclosure

04:59:27.940 --> 04:59:29.940
And he releases like a lot of ants and bugs in it

04:59:29.940 --> 04:59:31.940
And it's so cool

04:59:31.940 --> 04:59:33.940
Like ants are very interesting

04:59:33.940 --> 04:59:35.940
I used to like ants

04:59:35.940 --> 04:59:37.940
It was weird

04:59:37.940 --> 04:59:39.940
My mom said that

04:59:39.940 --> 04:59:41.940
We had in our

04:59:41.940 --> 04:59:43.940
Like our little like don't be apartment

04:59:43.940 --> 04:59:45.940
But um

04:59:45.940 --> 04:59:47.940
We lived in

04:59:47.940 --> 04:59:49.940
We had like an ant problem

04:59:49.940 --> 04:59:51.940
And so my mom like hired an exterminator

04:59:51.940 --> 04:59:53.940
And like was getting a lot of traps and stuff

04:59:53.940 --> 04:59:55.940
And I was

04:59:55.940 --> 04:59:57.940
My mom said that I was um

04:59:57.940 --> 04:59:59.940
Trying to take the ants outside

04:59:59.940 --> 05:00:01.940
And I was saying

05:00:01.940 --> 05:00:03.940
Little ant turn away

05:00:03.940 --> 05:00:05.940
Go back to your family

05:00:05.940 --> 05:00:07.940
My mom is gonna kill you

05:00:07.940 --> 05:00:09.940
You gotta go

05:00:09.940 --> 05:00:11.940
And I was like trying to save the ants

05:00:11.940 --> 05:00:13.940
I watched one of my um

05:00:13.940 --> 05:00:15.940
Favorite channels

05:00:15.940 --> 05:00:17.940
They don't really upload as much anymore

05:00:17.940 --> 05:00:19.940
Was um

05:00:19.940 --> 05:00:21.940
Uh

05:00:21.940 --> 05:00:23.940
Something flower horn

05:00:23.940 --> 05:00:25.940
Something the flower horn

05:00:25.940 --> 05:00:27.940
That was a cool and it was like

05:00:27.940 --> 05:00:29.940
They always played like classical music

05:00:29.940 --> 05:00:31.940
And I would just like watch and they like

05:00:31.940 --> 05:00:33.940
Had a lot of beta fish

05:00:33.940 --> 05:00:35.940
But then like I was like

05:00:35.940 --> 05:00:37.940
No my mom

05:00:37.940 --> 05:00:39.940
Then my dad told me that

05:00:39.940 --> 05:00:41.940
I would take magnifying glasses

05:00:41.940 --> 05:00:43.940
And set ants on fire

05:00:43.940 --> 05:00:45.940
So I like was nice and then I would try to kill ants

05:00:45.940 --> 05:00:47.940
And you know like

05:00:47.940 --> 05:00:49.940
Out some part of the year

05:00:49.940 --> 05:00:51.940
Like a lot of ants will rise

05:00:51.940 --> 05:00:53.940
Come out of the ground

05:00:53.940 --> 05:00:55.940
Sometimes when after like it rains or something

05:00:55.940 --> 05:00:57.940
And there's like a just a giant

05:00:57.940 --> 05:00:59.940
Riving mass of them

05:00:59.940 --> 05:01:01.940
Food the flower horn

05:01:01.940 --> 05:01:03.940
Yes food the flower horn so good

05:01:03.940 --> 05:01:05.940
I love that channel

05:01:05.940 --> 05:01:07.940
I was allowing them to have full sense of security

05:01:07.940 --> 05:01:09.940
So because

05:01:09.940 --> 05:01:11.940
We didn't want ant problems

05:01:11.940 --> 05:01:13.940
Me and my dad are gonna sound like fucking psychopaths

05:01:13.940 --> 05:01:15.940
We would just dump

05:01:15.940 --> 05:01:17.940
Rubbing alcohol

05:01:17.940 --> 05:01:19.940
On the

05:01:19.940 --> 05:01:21.940
Giant ant mess

05:01:21.940 --> 05:01:23.940
And then we would set them on fire

05:01:23.940 --> 05:01:25.940
And it smelled like bacon

05:01:27.940 --> 05:01:29.940
Kind of fucked

05:01:31.940 --> 05:01:33.940
But

05:01:33.940 --> 05:01:35.940
I don't do that

05:01:35.940 --> 05:01:37.940
It's really just to fight the ant problem

05:01:39.940 --> 05:01:41.940
I need citizen gasoline

05:01:41.940 --> 05:01:43.940
So yeah I've seen that

05:01:43.940 --> 05:01:45.940
We have

05:01:45.940 --> 05:01:47.940
Because my mom has like a really

05:01:47.940 --> 05:01:49.940
She has a garden because that's her thing

05:01:49.940 --> 05:01:51.940
She loves gardening

05:01:51.940 --> 05:01:53.940
That's why she says she wants to hijack my channel

05:01:53.940 --> 05:01:55.940
So she can garden

05:01:55.940 --> 05:01:57.940
She's like there's a gardening niche

05:01:57.940 --> 05:01:59.940
In redacted

05:01:59.940 --> 05:02:01.940
Area that needs to be filled

05:02:01.940 --> 05:02:03.940
It's my time like mom no

05:02:05.940 --> 05:02:07.940
She being a cheep

05:02:07.940 --> 05:02:09.940
And

05:02:09.940 --> 05:02:11.940
So they had to I think they had to get rid of

05:02:11.940 --> 05:02:13.940
Boss that way

05:02:13.940 --> 05:02:15.940
Because they also we have like a

05:02:15.940 --> 05:02:17.940
Really old shed that like the bees just like to hang out in this

05:02:17.940 --> 05:02:19.940
There's some

05:02:19.940 --> 05:02:21.940
Yellow jackets that I

05:02:21.940 --> 05:02:23.940
Are under my balcony

05:02:23.940 --> 05:02:25.940
And I still haven't

05:02:25.940 --> 05:02:27.940
Figured out how my lower neighbors hasn't

05:02:27.940 --> 05:02:29.940
Seen their nest yet because every summer

05:02:29.940 --> 05:02:31.940
Like I used to let

05:02:31.940 --> 05:02:33.940
Rain out on my balcony

05:02:33.940 --> 05:02:35.940
Had not the other cats because I know

05:02:35.940 --> 05:02:37.940
They will just fucking kamikaze themselves off

05:02:37.940 --> 05:02:39.940
I also had like a border around

05:02:39.940 --> 05:02:41.940
So that they couldn't like put their head through the bars

05:02:41.940 --> 05:02:43.940
Just in case they did get out if I opened it

05:02:43.940 --> 05:02:45.940
And um

05:02:47.940 --> 05:02:49.940
Fucking excuse you neighbor

05:02:49.940 --> 05:02:51.940
Coughing super fucking wildly as they walk by

05:02:53.940 --> 05:02:55.940
And um I remember

05:02:55.940 --> 05:02:57.940
There was like a bunch of wasps that like

05:02:57.940 --> 05:02:59.940
Early yellow jackets or whatever

05:02:59.940 --> 05:03:01.940
That were like right near where I would sit

05:03:03.940 --> 05:03:05.940
I just crashed fucking coughing up a lung dude

05:03:05.940 --> 05:03:07.940
And um

05:03:07.940 --> 05:03:09.940
I like ran

05:03:09.940 --> 05:03:11.940
To bring Raina inside

05:03:11.940 --> 05:03:13.940
Because I didn't want her getting stung

05:03:13.940 --> 05:03:15.940
Although cats look kind of funny when they are stung by a bee

05:03:15.940 --> 05:03:17.940
Because they are like little doofy faces

05:03:17.940 --> 05:03:19.940
Because it sucks

05:03:19.940 --> 05:03:21.940
But it's funny at the same time

05:03:21.940 --> 05:03:23.940
I didn't want that to happen to her

05:03:23.940 --> 05:03:25.940
Normal fish have fairly high maintenance

05:03:25.940 --> 05:03:27.940
But betas are real chance

05:03:27.940 --> 05:03:29.940
Yeah betas like survive on fucking anything

05:03:29.940 --> 05:03:31.940
It's crazy

05:03:31.940 --> 05:03:33.940
Fish enthusiasts

05:03:33.940 --> 05:03:35.940
And one of them likes to raise shrimp

05:03:35.940 --> 05:03:37.940
Um

05:03:37.940 --> 05:03:39.940
Like aquascaping seemed really cool to me

05:03:39.940 --> 05:03:41.940
But I just I don't have the patience

05:03:41.940 --> 05:03:43.940
To maintain stuff

05:03:43.940 --> 05:03:45.940
Gardening Shibi's mommy somewhere

05:03:45.940 --> 05:03:47.940
No

05:03:47.940 --> 05:03:49.940
I've seen so many brutal ant

05:03:49.940 --> 05:03:51.940
Wasps nest instructions

05:03:51.940 --> 05:03:53.940
Bids, yeah

05:03:53.940 --> 05:03:55.940
Drop, yeah I've seen people

05:03:55.940 --> 05:03:59.940
I've actually seen the aluminum stuff before

05:03:59.940 --> 05:04:01.940
People pouring aluminum into the

05:04:01.940 --> 05:04:03.940
Into the nests

05:04:03.940 --> 05:04:05.940
And then thinking it out

05:04:05.940 --> 05:04:07.940
It's very interesting

05:04:07.940 --> 05:04:09.940
Well if I

05:04:09.940 --> 05:04:11.940
The model if I like cover my face

05:04:11.940 --> 05:04:13.940
I'll fall asleep

05:04:15.940 --> 05:04:17.940
I lose tracking

05:04:17.940 --> 05:04:19.940
So I usually before I know I'm gonna lose tracking

05:04:19.940 --> 05:04:21.940
I try to close my eyes

05:04:21.940 --> 05:04:23.940
So I look like I'm sleeping

05:04:23.940 --> 05:04:25.940
I see does it automatically but mine doesn't

05:04:25.940 --> 05:04:27.940
I have to like be like

05:04:27.940 --> 05:04:29.940
And then move myself to the side

05:04:47.940 --> 05:04:49.940
It's like sleeping face

05:04:53.940 --> 05:04:55.940
I know it is kind of weird

05:04:55.940 --> 05:04:57.940
To think about the aluminum ones

05:04:59.940 --> 05:05:01.940
I like to watch this channel called snake discovery

05:05:01.940 --> 05:05:03.940
I learned a lot from them

05:05:03.940 --> 05:05:05.940
I like during

05:05:05.940 --> 05:05:07.940
Covid and lockdown and stuff

05:05:07.940 --> 05:05:09.940

05:05:09.940 --> 05:05:11.940
Animal facts stuff

05:05:11.940 --> 05:05:13.940
So like I learned a lot about snakes

05:05:13.940 --> 05:05:15.940
I'm 100% sure

05:05:15.940 --> 05:05:17.940
If somebody handed me a clutch of bottle python eggs

05:05:17.940 --> 05:05:19.940
I could raise them no problem

05:05:21.940 --> 05:05:23.940
And like invertebrates and

05:05:23.940 --> 05:05:25.940
Reptiles

05:05:25.940 --> 05:05:27.940
And it was really cool

05:05:27.940 --> 05:05:29.940
Yeah snake discovery is awesome

05:05:29.940 --> 05:05:31.940
Really awesome

05:05:31.940 --> 05:05:33.940
Like if um

05:05:35.940 --> 05:05:37.940
If they ever do like

05:05:37.940 --> 05:05:39.940
If I ever become big and they do a charity event

05:05:39.940 --> 05:05:41.940
I will 100% like donate to them

05:05:41.940 --> 05:05:43.940

05:05:43.940 --> 05:05:45.940
And uh yeah

05:05:45.940 --> 05:05:47.940

Ants Canada

05:05:51.940 --> 05:05:53.940
Dark Den

05:05:53.940 --> 05:05:55.940
There was another one I used to watch

05:05:55.940 --> 05:05:57.940
But I don't think they posted it anymore

05:05:57.940 --> 05:05:59.940
I don't remember

05:05:59.940 --> 05:06:01.940

Ranchos

05:06:05.940 --> 05:06:07.940

05:06:07.940 --> 05:06:09.940
Catching up on

05:06:09.940 --> 05:06:11.940
Like

05:06:11.940 --> 05:06:13.940
I was watching an Ants Canada video

05:06:13.940 --> 05:06:15.940
Where he released like a huntsman

05:06:15.940 --> 05:06:17.940
And her baby is into an enclosure

05:06:17.940 --> 05:06:19.940
And I was like I was just fucking sick

05:06:19.940 --> 05:06:21.940
Cause I hadn't like consumed like bug media

05:06:21.940 --> 05:06:23.940
In a long time

05:06:23.940 --> 05:06:25.940
I really like bugs

05:06:25.940 --> 05:06:27.940
Bugs are cool

05:06:27.940 --> 05:06:29.940
And animals in general

05:06:29.940 --> 05:06:31.940
I like watching um animal documentaries

05:06:31.940 --> 05:06:33.940
And also like

05:06:33.940 --> 05:06:35.940
A comfort thing that I do cause

05:06:35.940 --> 05:06:37.940
Soleil would sit and watch

05:06:37.940 --> 05:06:39.940
Like you know like night on earth

05:06:39.940 --> 05:06:41.940
On Netflix

05:06:41.940 --> 05:06:43.940
Like Soleil loved to watch that

05:06:43.940 --> 05:06:45.940
With me

05:06:45.940 --> 05:06:47.940
She loved to watch animal documentaries with me

05:06:47.940 --> 05:06:49.940
She used to pay attention to the tv

05:06:49.940 --> 05:06:51.940
She just hang out

05:06:51.940 --> 05:06:53.940
Beetles are cool

05:06:53.940 --> 05:06:55.940
I actually don't know a lot about beetles

05:06:55.940 --> 05:06:57.940
I know very little about beetles

05:06:57.940 --> 05:06:59.940
I mostly like isopods

05:06:59.940 --> 05:07:01.940
And uh spiders

05:07:01.940 --> 05:07:03.940
And like um

05:07:03.940 --> 05:07:05.940
Praying mantises

My genetic spiral arm case in our huntsman

05:07:09.940 --> 05:07:11.940
Yeah those enclosures are crazy

05:07:11.940 --> 05:07:13.940
I know a little bit about like long horn beetles

05:07:15.940 --> 05:07:17.940
I think the coolest thing I've seen

05:07:17.940 --> 05:07:19.940
Um I saw those like beetle tattoo ones

05:07:19.940 --> 05:07:21.940
Of this girl who had like

05:07:21.940 --> 05:07:23.940
When she closed

05:07:23.940 --> 05:07:25.940
Like I don't really know how to explain it

05:07:25.940 --> 05:07:27.940
But when it was on her

05:07:27.940 --> 05:07:29.940
The side of her knee

05:07:29.940 --> 05:07:31.940
When her thigh and her calves were touching

05:07:31.940 --> 05:07:33.940
It looked like the beetle was

05:07:33.940 --> 05:07:35.940
Closed and then when she would spread

05:07:35.940 --> 05:07:37.940
Like um stretch out her leg

05:07:37.940 --> 05:07:39.940
And she would like

05:07:39.940 --> 05:07:41.940
Stretch out her leg

05:07:41.940 --> 05:07:43.940
It looked like the beetle was

05:07:43.940 --> 05:07:45.940
Extending its wings and it was like the coolest

05:07:45.940 --> 05:07:47.940
Fucking tattoo I've ever seen in my life

05:07:49.940 --> 05:07:51.940
I've seen that with like moths and stuff too

05:07:51.940 --> 05:07:53.940
People do that

05:07:53.940 --> 05:07:55.940
You've seen that tattoo? Yeah

05:07:55.940 --> 05:07:57.940
I've also seen um

05:07:57.940 --> 05:07:59.940
Yeah roaches like how people raise

05:07:59.940 --> 05:08:01.940
Dew beer roaches

05:08:01.940 --> 05:08:03.940
It's really cool

05:08:03.940 --> 05:08:05.940
I like tattoos a lot, tattoos are really cool

05:08:05.940 --> 05:08:07.940
I think it's a beautiful art form

05:08:07.940 --> 05:08:09.940
Um

05:08:11.940 --> 05:08:13.940
Ladybugs

05:08:13.940 --> 05:08:15.940
Ladybirds, do people call them ladybirds?

05:08:15.940 --> 05:08:17.940
I know you can order ladybugs on amazon

05:08:17.940 --> 05:08:19.940
My mom likes um ladybugs

05:08:21.940 --> 05:08:23.940
Was it a single beetle?

05:08:23.940 --> 05:08:25.940
Yeah it was

05:08:25.940 --> 05:08:27.940
I bet if you could do it if you look like

05:08:27.940 --> 05:08:29.940
The beetle knee tattoo I bet you can find it

05:08:33.940 --> 05:08:35.940

Fumi um weird undertone to it

05:08:59.940 --> 05:09:01.940

05:10:17.940 --> 05:10:19.940
Cause I know

05:10:19.940 --> 05:10:21.940
Some people

05:10:21.940 --> 05:10:23.940

Like cause I used to be really shy

05:10:55.940 --> 05:10:57.940
Cause I didn't talk at all

05:10:57.940 --> 05:10:59.940
And then when I did start talking I got told I talked too much

05:10:59.940 --> 05:11:01.940

There's something called marshmallow

05:11:07.940 --> 05:11:09.940
You can send it there

05:11:09.940 --> 05:11:11.940
Found me today

Hi welcome welcome to harem

05:11:13.940 --> 05:11:15.940
Welcome harem

05:11:17.940 --> 05:11:19.940
I need to think of like

05:11:19.940 --> 05:11:21.940
So

05:11:21.940 --> 05:11:23.940
So harem is your collective name

05:11:23.940 --> 05:11:25.940
But what is the singular

05:11:25.940 --> 05:11:27.940
Of the harem name

05:11:27.940 --> 05:11:29.940
What's the singular

05:11:29.940 --> 05:11:31.940
A harem

05:11:31.940 --> 05:11:33.940
A harem

05:11:37.940 --> 05:11:39.940
Woomi

05:11:39.940 --> 05:11:41.940
Can you have a toy right here at resp.

05:11:41.940 --> 05:11:43.940
I don't want to roll over her she's below my chair

05:11:43.940 --> 05:11:45.940

They literally have a toy box

05:11:55.940 --> 05:11:57.940
And they know they can take some out of their toy box

05:11:57.940 --> 05:11:59.940
Cause they're smart enough to do that

05:11:59.940 --> 05:12:01.940
Fiya usually will go into her toy box

05:12:01.940 --> 05:12:03.940
And take some out

05:12:03.940 --> 05:12:05.940

05:12:13.940 --> 05:12:15.940
That was an impressive roll

05:12:15.940 --> 05:12:17.940
Woomi just somersaulted to get a toy

05:12:17.940 --> 05:12:19.940
Woomi

05:12:19.940 --> 05:12:21.940
Fiya came out of the

05:12:21.940 --> 05:12:23.940
Out of nowhere and Woomi went into that

05:12:23.940 --> 05:12:25.940
Like that typical arched cat back

05:12:25.940 --> 05:12:27.940
Cause he's such a

05:12:27.940 --> 05:12:29.940
He's literally such a menace but he's such a pussy

05:12:29.940 --> 05:12:31.940
Like he's scared of everything

05:12:33.940 --> 05:12:35.940
Like if I'm

05:12:35.940 --> 05:12:37.940
If somebody came in broken

05:12:37.940 --> 05:12:39.940
Reina my 14 year old elderly cat

05:12:39.940 --> 05:12:41.940
Would launch themselves at them

05:12:41.940 --> 05:12:43.940
Woomi jumps behind the dryer

05:12:43.940 --> 05:12:45.940
Fiya would probably just watch

05:12:45.940 --> 05:12:47.940
See how everything plays out

05:12:47.940 --> 05:12:49.940
Fiya

You guys will be called a Harlots

05:13:07.940 --> 05:13:09.940
Not a Harlots, a Harlots

05:13:09.940 --> 05:13:11.940
It's spelled Harlots

05:13:11.940 --> 05:13:13.940

05:22:35.780 --> 05:22:38.900
up really like in the show because i'm very someone like me and my mom are usually very much

sticklers for wow out of context that sounds really bad guys in half black um i feel like i have

indian royal families were understandable like forget it like it doesn't even matter version's

05:23:24.260 --> 05:23:30.420
a great show once i got the premise because i thought they were trying to be true to the time period

05:23:31.940 --> 05:23:38.980
like tutors ask because i liked tutors um and like the white princess the white queen

05:23:40.900 --> 05:23:49.220
and the past can't wait to get my past toggle um three fours of the whole

05:23:49.220 --> 05:23:50.180

05:23:54.020 --> 05:23:58.900

hey you got you got me which makes those jokes you got emmy which says does gay jokes

05:24:51.460 --> 05:24:57.780
you got everybody else who is politically correct i don't know what to do

05:25:03.700 --> 05:25:10.500
i need vods to watch she be she be dumping problems see if i was in a normal agency i would not have survived

05:25:11.540 --> 05:25:17.860
uh she's black it's fuck is there so much easier when i had a tan model

05:25:19.700 --> 05:25:24.260
although i could actually i could probably just change my skin tone in my um

05:25:27.060 --> 05:25:34.420
in my uh meshes for the model i could probably do that actually

05:25:42.420 --> 05:25:46.020
i might wait it's probably not going up doing fucking blackface if i do this

05:25:49.700 --> 05:25:50.420
fuck it weeble

05:26:03.860 --> 05:26:06.260

05:26:07.220 --> 05:26:10.580
these are all fucking layers rgb

05:26:37.220 --> 05:26:39.220

05:27:31.220 --> 05:27:42.580
no keep going

05:27:51.460 --> 05:28:02.100
you know it's funny when i became a streamer my ultimate goal

05:28:04.100 --> 05:28:09.140
was to be a role model for other little black girls just like myself who liked video games

05:28:09.140 --> 05:28:16.100
and were female and i wanted to be a role model role model for women of color i am not that

05:28:16.900 --> 05:28:21.540
i failed myself

05:28:29.860 --> 05:28:37.220
i think i just sometimes you just don't you don't it's fun not to take yourself seriously you know

05:28:42.980 --> 05:28:45.780
this is really fun to do though i'm just moving my mouse around for this

05:28:46.340 --> 05:28:47.700
ah kings are glowing

05:28:51.380 --> 05:28:52.500
this is hypnotizing you

05:28:56.500 --> 05:29:00.820
keep up the dream yeah it's always been my goal especially because there's like

05:29:00.820 --> 05:29:06.020
what i loved about being in this company is that um not only do you have

05:29:08.420 --> 05:29:11.780
one black girl that has a black model you have two black girls and one has a white model

05:29:12.260 --> 05:29:22.260
um and usually there is no other there's no other company that has a tan or a racial

05:29:22.260 --> 05:29:29.780
ambiguous model or black model and i think that's pretty cool that we're kind of branching out

05:29:29.780 --> 05:29:37.700
because people are like oh people won't like a tan model look at fucking koinako or waifu baby

05:29:38.660 --> 05:29:46.980
like giaru or tan or whatever like it's still a popular niche yeah before serena

05:29:49.060 --> 05:29:55.460
rest in peace um avi cadavera she was a fucking amazing creator and it's really sad

05:29:55.460 --> 05:30:02.020
to see her go by the way uh amazing comedian and sketch artists she was very very unique

05:30:02.100 --> 05:30:08.420
and um vtuber sphere it's i'm congrats to her though for landing some sort of thing

05:30:08.420 --> 05:30:15.060
woomi what are you doing i'm gonna give you a hug come here big man kiss you how are you doing

05:30:15.620 --> 05:30:16.820
how are you doing mr titties

05:30:20.020 --> 05:30:23.700
um yeah sanas sanas.com sana sana i can never pronounce my name right

05:30:24.660 --> 05:30:31.780
but uh yeah i feel like azura and serena feel those niches and i feel like it just shows

05:30:32.100 --> 05:30:36.740
that there can be there's plenty in the indie sphere let's bring it more into the corporal sphere

05:30:36.740 --> 05:30:43.060
you know yeah abby's graduating serena staying this sucks because there's only two of them in their

05:30:43.060 --> 05:30:47.620
gen and now serena's alone so i kind of hope they do like for v4 mariah like in some sort of

05:30:47.620 --> 05:30:53.300
invader gen um just so like she doesn't have to feel like she's alone

05:30:55.860 --> 05:31:01.300
yeah i'm i'm eventually getting like i know emmy um can rig i know she said she

05:31:01.300 --> 05:31:06.020
just like like um she i can just hand over the model files to her and she'll just

05:31:06.020 --> 05:31:13.860
like slap toggle on so i might just do that although i think um i think um strani is talking to

05:31:14.660 --> 05:31:24.740
our um rig papa mama because she's a girl nori um about getting me a cover-up official cover-up

05:31:24.820 --> 05:31:27.220
for my biddies in a tan toggle

05:31:30.500 --> 05:31:37.380
not that i don't like like you know this model and i would just i'd be like i kind of i want to i

05:31:37.380 --> 05:31:40.820
would pull like an iron mouse and just switch between the two because it kind of makes sense

05:31:40.820 --> 05:31:42.980
because i am irish also

05:31:48.180 --> 05:31:54.020
yeah i wish like some people who had like um like swimsuit models like had like a tan toggle on them

05:31:54.020 --> 05:32:00.260
like that would be really cool depends on the audience so i wasn't forced to retire yeah that's true

05:32:03.700 --> 05:32:09.220
it's hard to get to colored models yeah yeah because like um for my model i had before

05:32:09.220 --> 05:32:19.940
in my past life i literally mostly use a little one uh my former artist mama uh swal koi

05:32:19.940 --> 05:32:27.140
fucking amazing because i was like i was a cute funny vtuber um they did such a fucking good job

05:32:27.140 --> 05:32:33.940
and sorry that model will never be seen the model i i was going to do a whole debut but then

05:32:33.940 --> 05:32:40.180
i got into a veal or that model will never be seen um but they did such a fucking good job on my model

05:32:40.180 --> 05:32:47.700
because um they nailed the skin tone how horny was it

05:32:50.660 --> 05:32:58.820
uh it wasn't actually uh because i was i was a cute and funny priestess so i kind of had almost

05:32:58.820 --> 05:33:07.620
like a gypsy look to me i don't really know how to explain it um there's there was tommy showing

05:33:07.620 --> 05:33:15.380
i don't know um and then i had my nun model that i used a lot and i just like edited the mesh like

05:33:15.380 --> 05:33:25.380
how you just saw me almost doing something terrible and i just did that and um i just made it tan

05:33:28.020 --> 05:33:34.100
but yeah there isn't it's mostly like i think yeah getting like the coloring right because

05:33:34.100 --> 05:33:41.300
sometimes it can be gray or like too orange or red it's it's those different tones in uh tan

05:33:41.300 --> 05:33:48.900
colors um that's why i provide i provided as many references as possible with the skin tone that i wanted

05:33:52.420 --> 05:33:56.900
all right she's a shark she's spanish yeah i feel like there's also like a lot of spanish

05:33:57.300 --> 05:34:02.500
and like it honestly kind of makes sense to me to have more tan models because you have a lot

05:34:02.500 --> 05:34:09.860
of spanish fans and you also have a lot of um uh agent fans that are more darker skins because

05:34:09.860 --> 05:34:19.860
like not every japanese korean filipino tai vietnamese lai ocean etc etc etc etc is snow white

05:34:22.500 --> 05:34:32.100
ending of purple yeah i actually at one point i was tempted to um brand into like when i first started

05:34:32.100 --> 05:34:35.700
v2 being just to be like a dark elf and just be like drow colored

05:34:36.020 --> 05:34:49.220
that's because i feel like people have it or more easily do that than something else i don't know why

05:34:49.220 --> 05:34:51.380
why do my eyes look like weird colors

05:34:54.100 --> 05:34:59.620
i feel like one's darker than the other with the whole i think i have the like the light in the

05:34:59.700 --> 05:35:01.460
center of my eyes and shade it properly

05:35:05.700 --> 05:35:10.500
modernizing the end of it yeah half heart yeah tricksy who

05:35:11.300 --> 05:35:18.340
the tricksy yeah i know what you're doing um jarby super tight yeah

05:35:20.900 --> 05:35:22.500
um trust fit on the nose yeah

05:35:22.500 --> 05:35:33.060
i don't want to um flashbang by turning on my turning off the overlay i have on this

05:35:36.580 --> 05:35:37.060
but like

05:35:41.620 --> 05:35:42.740
i don't know how to word that

05:35:44.900 --> 05:35:48.500
but yeah i just think it's cool and like i also think it's like i was almost like i just

05:35:48.500 --> 05:35:55.940
a like i wanted i drew this really cool picture of this um i made a slime based vtuber

05:35:57.060 --> 05:36:00.980
um made her an oc of mine can you what the fuck are you guys doing

05:36:03.140 --> 05:36:06.820
i can hear you fucking about what's up marina go check it out

05:36:08.340 --> 05:36:10.820
marina's walking towards the laundry room she's gonna go investigate

05:36:11.780 --> 05:36:21.540
um um what the fuck was i saying oh yeah i was gonna be a this was before like this was

05:36:21.540 --> 05:36:26.580
just me when i was going indy for the first time by the way because i didn't like again i didn't

05:36:26.580 --> 05:36:36.020
conceptualize or create myself as you see now um and no no no she wouldn't she wouldn't be a model

05:36:36.020 --> 05:36:42.660
like she be will be my only only one and only model although i'm i'm begging strony for a slime

05:36:42.660 --> 05:36:49.780
girl gen two please hello i will sell this oc so this comes to life so i had an oc her name was

05:36:49.780 --> 05:36:56.580
saliva and i called her live saliva saliva and she was a slime girl but she was made of spit

05:36:58.100 --> 05:37:03.780
she was like blue colored so she was like spit personified um

05:37:03.780 --> 05:37:08.340
um and i was like oh i was good so i was gonna be that

05:37:11.540 --> 05:37:14.580
so i'm like hey that would actually be a pretty cool idea for gen two

05:37:16.580 --> 05:37:20.020
oh it sounds kind of gross well fuck you

05:37:22.660 --> 05:37:28.740
um but then she could like you know make herself not spit like she could like change her

05:37:28.740 --> 05:37:33.380
form or whatever the fuck um imagine the smell

05:37:37.460 --> 05:37:43.620
the spit part not the slime girl the spit part um i thought it was just really on theme

05:37:45.940 --> 05:37:53.860
and uh yeah i want i want i want a monster girl i want a bug girl i want a slime girl

05:37:53.860 --> 05:37:55.460

05:38:37.220 --> 05:38:45.060
lamia lamia can i pronounce that what led you to joining vealer um i was a huge fan of strawnee

05:38:46.420 --> 05:38:57.700
for all her iterations um i watched her grow as a vtuber and when she had other things go on

05:38:58.980 --> 05:39:04.340
and she mentioned hey i want to do my own um company i was like oh that'd be sick

05:39:04.340 --> 05:39:09.460
so i worked really hard because i um i really only

05:39:11.460 --> 05:39:17.700
like i i'd streamed it as a flushtuber in the past and i do have content creation um history

05:39:17.700 --> 05:39:24.980
and experience but i was never a vtuber so i'm like if i work really hard i'm gonna stream

05:39:24.980 --> 05:39:30.900
i'm gonna get a model like just got one right off at etsy change the colors of it um gonna make

05:39:30.900 --> 05:39:37.940
content gonna do my own thing and i'm gonna if when she ever makes this company i want to apply

05:39:38.900 --> 05:39:44.660
and because mean i and she'll say the same thing about me because she's called me her 2.0

05:39:46.420 --> 05:39:51.380
i saw a lot of shared values in her she was like we have a lot of similar tastes

05:39:52.340 --> 05:39:56.020
as you can see we like to stream for very long times and we just like to talk and

05:39:56.020 --> 05:40:00.820
yep and hang out with people and we like um as you said like a lot of the same things

05:40:02.420 --> 05:40:11.140
and uh it was it was just like what like it's i know like it was the type of

05:40:12.580 --> 05:40:18.420
relationship like watching a uh a content creator i hadn't felt in a long time where i'm like

05:40:19.300 --> 05:40:22.180
oh i'm gonna watch you and i feel like i'm just hanging out with a friend

05:40:22.900 --> 05:40:28.500
and i'm like i want to be that person so bad where you just come home and you're like oh my friend

05:40:28.500 --> 05:40:34.580
streaming i'm like we're gonna hang out we're gonna chat we're gonna talk simping paid off um

05:40:35.700 --> 05:40:41.540
and like just seeing her like roadmap and what she wanted to accomplish i was like i want to do

05:40:41.540 --> 05:40:50.020
everything in my power to try to be in this company um i i honestly don't know how i ended up here

05:40:51.140 --> 05:40:58.180
it literally i was bawling my eyes out when i got accepted it was it was it was crazy it was

05:40:58.180 --> 05:41:04.660
genuinely wild um but it's but like i'll be honest with you i did apply to other companies

05:41:04.660 --> 05:41:09.940
because i didn't think i would get in i also applied for the experience um because i didn't

05:41:09.940 --> 05:41:19.460
know what it was like applying to a vtuber agency um yeah i was i was a i was an og refling

05:41:21.940 --> 05:41:27.620
some of you already know that um i ended up here because you're awesome oh thank you um

05:41:28.820 --> 05:41:33.620
and then you blackmailed her yes and then i blackmailed her so i got her um

05:41:33.620 --> 05:41:41.060
um i think yeah she said she so she made notes on our interviews of like why she

05:41:41.060 --> 05:41:47.860
oh my internet's starting to go because it's getting late uh they're like shut up we're taking

05:41:47.860 --> 05:41:53.300
away your internet so she said i got to see some notes of what she wrote down about me during

05:41:53.300 --> 05:41:58.420
her interview and when she took when she was like doing research on the people that applied and

05:41:58.420 --> 05:42:04.820
she wrote down i'm way too knowledgeable about the industry for only being around for six months

05:42:06.020 --> 05:42:11.060
which is true although it's been um more than six months now that i've been a vtuber

05:42:12.260 --> 05:42:20.900
and uh i was very good at voice acting and at a range but i needed to work on my cute and funny

05:42:20.900 --> 05:42:25.620
voice is what she said because i mostly streamed it was like cute and funny but i had a lot of

05:42:25.620 --> 05:42:31.620
vocal fry when i did my cute and funny voice but now i don't not now it's um i've trained it since

05:42:31.620 --> 05:42:42.340
then and um and she saw again like a lot of herself in me and i think she said that i wonder

05:42:42.340 --> 05:42:50.580
if i can find it she said that you know i was what she should have been in another life and i was like

05:42:50.740 --> 05:42:59.860
and i i disagreed with her on that how long i've been so i've been a streamer for almost like for

05:42:59.860 --> 05:43:08.020
about five years i had to take a break because of school and work and then i got back into vtubers

05:43:08.020 --> 05:43:18.020
again and i um yes i was like when she told like when when i asked the manager for the notes

05:43:18.980 --> 05:43:22.980
because i'm like okay how can i improve and i saw that i literally broke down crying

05:43:26.500 --> 05:43:37.140
um so it was i was blown away by that fucking um statement and i it is my goal to live up to it now

05:43:38.740 --> 05:43:42.740
did you try any other kind of voice acting besides stream uh actually no i don't have

05:43:43.700 --> 05:43:50.500
any other voice acting under my belt i only did it for fun in my streams i was always good at

05:43:50.500 --> 05:43:56.580
doing wacky voices when i hung out with my friends i was that the funny one in the friend group

05:43:57.300 --> 05:44:01.540
the girl who managed to have a sense of humor um

05:44:03.700 --> 05:44:08.580
then you said the acceptance note it's april first yes and then two days later i think i i

05:44:08.580 --> 05:44:15.380
interviewed the strawney she was like you're in like excuse me she's like yeah uh here's the model

05:44:16.020 --> 05:44:21.620
slide shebe's first um model iteration because we did like had some adjustment since then

05:44:21.620 --> 05:44:25.700
like i had i used to have a lipstick then i pointed out that i'm like i had like the same

05:44:25.700 --> 05:44:34.660
lips as a zura so they yoinked my lipstick away um i can't wait to be picked up a cruncher

05:44:34.660 --> 05:44:40.500
although it would be it would literally it would be so crazy if i got to voice for an anime

05:44:41.300 --> 05:44:48.100
that is like oh my god that'd be so insane that'd be so amazing queen must my emergency

05:44:48.100 --> 05:44:59.140
oh queen uh so um some of you know like i wasn't uh technically supposed to be shebe it was supposed

05:44:59.220 --> 05:45:08.020
to be another um asa mark creator uh but life uh commitment's gone the way so she couldn't sign on

05:45:10.340 --> 05:45:18.420
so uh she goes dub stories dub that'd be so fucking funny i don't love you because you're a rabbit

05:45:19.300 --> 05:45:28.420
i don't love you because you're wow why am i i am so fucking bad today what the fuck dude

05:45:30.100 --> 05:45:35.300
um anime series voice acting i don't really particular series does anything fantasy related

05:45:35.300 --> 05:45:37.860
i'm never gonna be hired at this rate um

05:45:43.140 --> 05:45:48.660
i think i use that sort of humor as a coping mechanism or like a defense mechanism because

05:45:50.020 --> 05:45:54.580
younger me would just ball her eyes out if somebody said that to me and i think i've just adapted

05:45:55.460 --> 05:46:04.100
um yeah oh yeah so uh thank you for reminding me so yeah i wasn't supposed to be shebe um

05:46:05.300 --> 05:46:13.300
but but shebe wasn't shebe back then because the other asa martis and strani were conceptualizing

05:46:13.300 --> 05:46:20.580
the og shebe together and then other asa martis could not sign on because um and this is like way

05:46:20.580 --> 05:46:29.700
early in development like before buehler had a fucking like name um and so then you know strani was

05:46:29.700 --> 05:46:37.780
on the hunt for a different creator and i just happened to fit that and but it's she's always

05:46:37.780 --> 05:46:41.060
reassured me she's like you're always gonna be my sheepsters like you're always my shivers

05:46:41.620 --> 05:46:49.140
you're always gonna be my she my sheepsters um yeah when it was still a b sucky yeah um but yeah

05:46:49.140 --> 05:46:56.260
she i originally had like i was i was as thick as a zura and i was purple i was purple

05:46:58.580 --> 05:47:05.940
um and then yeah then they changed it and worked through the conceptualization and then

05:47:06.900 --> 05:47:15.860
i'm like i hired on and it's me and i'm a bunny yeah i was barney your voice seriously suits shebe to a

05:47:16.820 --> 05:47:23.620
i don't think my voice suits it at all i i'll be on it like when i first got my model

05:47:24.420 --> 05:47:30.260
and i was watching myself talk out of it it was very weird and it still is weird to me

05:47:31.620 --> 05:47:41.300
so you were out only yes oh my god out only such a fucking great game um yeah i never like i'm

05:47:41.300 --> 05:47:47.620
still getting used to hearing my honestly i think my normal speaking voice fits better

05:47:48.340 --> 05:47:56.100
but some i use like my patreon voice when i get really like like i don't like my like my voice

05:47:56.100 --> 05:48:03.780
in the trailer and in my um like one of my shorts i'm like my i like really deep in my voice

05:48:03.780 --> 05:48:07.220
and i really put my voice on and it's like they always say like you always put on a voice

05:48:08.020 --> 05:48:12.100
when you first stream and then you either get higher or you lower your voice like a lot of girls

05:48:12.100 --> 05:48:16.180
mostly pitch their voices up because they want to be cute and they want to talk like this

05:48:19.300 --> 05:48:22.340
and then they'll be like hey what's up like later like a couple months down the line

05:48:23.540 --> 05:48:33.460
um you went musky deep hefty hefty hefty uh i think you lost us on that one

05:48:34.420 --> 05:48:37.380
well i mean a large white guy for some of my voice talk of a giant bird

05:48:37.380 --> 05:48:44.420
yeah exactly like it's it's uh i've also was so used to seeing my voice come out

05:48:45.460 --> 05:48:55.060
of my pl that i think that was like if if i had not started v2 being they just gave me this model

05:48:55.060 --> 05:49:04.420
i think it would have been way so pl means past life um and i yeah i don't think i would have had the

05:49:04.420 --> 05:49:09.940
problem but because i was cute and funny in tan and then being this i was like huh

05:49:12.500 --> 05:49:18.740
um one of my favorite things about being trans is still having a deep voice i can slip into

05:49:18.740 --> 05:49:24.580
one of my uh one of my gorex is is trans and she always pulls that on me

05:49:25.940 --> 05:49:31.700
because and it throws me off each time because she'll come up to me behind me at work

05:49:32.980 --> 05:49:37.700
and she'll be like hey excuse me and i'll be like what the f**k if then it's her and i'm like

05:49:38.180 --> 05:49:45.140
f**k you and she's like hey sorry skat skadaddles away i'm like b**ch um

05:49:48.820 --> 05:49:49.860
yeah pl past life

05:49:52.340 --> 05:50:03.300
my mom nice to go yeah like oh when i saw the model when strawnee showed me the model i was like holy s**t

05:50:03.620 --> 05:50:12.100
i'm a hot as f**k like holy and you want me to be that also why is she wearing so many

05:50:12.100 --> 05:50:19.700
bonnage ropes i also um i might ask nari to get a toggle where i can take off the ropes

05:50:21.620 --> 05:50:28.820
they're starting to chafe none the good way but i can like i want to be able to toggle them in my uh

05:50:29.460 --> 05:50:38.580
gag just for like um content reasons because i feel like i honestly i i personally out of all the girls

05:50:38.580 --> 05:50:47.860
don't think i'll get monetization because of my model because i'm wearing a ballgag

05:50:49.300 --> 05:50:54.900
i don't know and then azura has really big boos who knows silk rope not have yeah

05:50:58.820 --> 05:51:06.980
what lore yeah i know um it's funny when i became a vtuber i was like you know what i

05:51:06.980 --> 05:51:10.900
want to do definitely i really want to stick to a character like i really just want to role play a

05:51:10.900 --> 05:51:17.940
character and i'm like then streaming yeah my cute my really cute necklace my cute choker it's

05:51:17.940 --> 05:51:28.180
very unique then streaming i realized i just somebody had said about me that they wish i would

05:51:28.180 --> 05:51:36.340
be myself and then when i started being myself i had the most fun and when i started being myself

05:51:37.380 --> 05:51:43.140
i made better content and i think that's why people have a hard time sticking to cave ape because

05:51:43.140 --> 05:51:50.820
they realize when they're you're already kind of hiding yourself behind you know an anime character

05:51:50.820 --> 05:51:57.300
on the internet like why can't you be yourself but also have aspects of that character you really

05:51:57.300 --> 05:52:05.620
enjoy like um for this i do like learning how about how to be a dom and you know i like pretending

05:52:05.620 --> 05:52:11.860
and role playing that like you're my either my clients or my staff at waterland hotel like that's

05:52:11.860 --> 05:52:19.780
just so fun to me like oh did you uh go make sure that mr withamall was taking care of

05:52:20.660 --> 05:52:23.060
him he needs his dick suck now

05:52:25.860 --> 05:52:35.300
and he also needs his his bed made in his his clothing pressed um and and i think you know people

05:52:36.260 --> 05:52:40.500
do complain sometimes like oh cave ape cave ape cave ape that's taking a cave ape

05:52:41.300 --> 05:52:46.500
but then you look at the most popular vtubers and you see that people fell in love with them

05:52:46.500 --> 05:52:54.340
because they were themselves you know like like gir for example she was always like you know really

05:52:55.220 --> 05:53:05.220
cute in childlike like she like that sort of silly um person like personality you know if she

05:53:06.340 --> 05:53:12.100
she's not gonna really lean into being a shark and being like i want to kill everybody or whatever

05:53:12.100 --> 05:53:19.220
like she like yeah cave ape is a wrestling term it means like um kind of like your role

05:53:19.220 --> 05:53:26.660
like with the act that you put on your your lore aka your story your backstory um because that's her

05:53:26.660 --> 05:53:35.780
exactly it's her she didn't have to put any like and that's why at first i was frustrated when applying

05:53:35.780 --> 05:53:45.060
to companies because i was like oh why are they like why am i not getting hired and then

05:53:46.660 --> 05:53:52.900
and then watching like places i applied for because like i applied to idol i applied to pixel link i applied

05:53:52.900 --> 05:54:02.100
to um like vnu and all that stuff and then i see the people who play and um are those vtubers

05:54:02.100 --> 05:54:10.420
and i'm like i don't i do not see myself as that bird like i would not want to have hired anyone

05:54:10.420 --> 05:54:17.220
else besides the person playing this um this character like not even because they they always

05:54:17.220 --> 05:54:20.740
say oh they're looking for people to fit the character they're looking for people to fit the

05:54:20.740 --> 05:54:25.780
role fit the voice and i totally get it now because after applying for so much and then getting

05:54:26.580 --> 05:54:31.860
um shot down i was like i just didn't fit them and i and i see myself not fitting them

05:54:33.540 --> 05:54:42.420
and i couldn't see myself growing into that character so it's really cool to kind of see

05:54:42.420 --> 05:54:49.460
what people get cast as and how like their true personalities come out like i'm getting i remember

05:54:49.540 --> 05:54:58.100
i watched a lot of vnu girls before i was um hired and i like um like mesmerizing i was i was um

05:54:58.660 --> 05:55:04.980
chatting with her the other day in her in her stream and i'm like i could not see myself playing it

05:55:04.980 --> 05:55:10.900
like you're also kind of like a mommy character but you're also like classy you know about drinks

05:55:10.900 --> 05:55:18.980
like she's very like like she's so like i don't know like it's just it's just like everybody fits

05:55:19.460 --> 05:55:25.700
so perfectly you know agencies are picky and also you know there's like nepotism and

05:55:25.700 --> 05:55:29.940
shit like i didn't think i was gonna get into veal or because i didn't know if strani was going

05:55:29.940 --> 05:55:34.740
to go the route of like hiring friends or hiring people that because you know it is it's more

05:55:34.740 --> 05:55:39.460
smarter to hire people that already have a history and experience of being in a corporate agency

05:55:40.500 --> 05:55:45.380
but she took a chance on me and i appreciate her for that dom the role i was born to play

05:55:45.380 --> 05:55:56.820
oh that's funny no i like i like um i like switching and putting you guys like i'll be

05:55:56.820 --> 05:56:04.580
like hey i'm a dark girl failure then i'm like open your mouth say ah okay hold it and i just

05:56:04.580 --> 05:56:12.740
rule into your fucking mouth now swallow good boy like i like it's fun just like pulling it out of

05:56:12.740 --> 05:56:22.340
nowhere he's a bishop principal is there reading material how to dom i mean i watch a lot of

05:56:22.340 --> 05:56:29.620
fucking porn to learn and uh you guys have already also given me suggestions of stuff to watch

05:56:30.660 --> 05:56:37.460
and i also learned i did i watch a lot of youtube videos about the culture of like um like bdsm culture

05:56:37.460 --> 05:56:45.540
um like i know somebody was kind of frustrated with me at first because i made a joke that i didn't

05:56:45.540 --> 05:56:48.980
believe in safe words yes i believe in like safe words are very important they're important with

05:56:48.980 --> 05:56:54.260
consent and all that stuff um sometimes i like to be a bit and sometimes people are into that

05:56:54.260 --> 05:56:59.940
sometimes people like so i will cater to different niches and fetishes and all that other stuff calm down

05:56:59.940 --> 05:57:06.020
i'm not gonna hurt anybody i'm not actually in the bdsm community promoting like

05:57:06.900 --> 05:57:07.460
abuse

05:57:14.660 --> 05:57:20.980
good for homework yeah and it's like uh it's funny because looking at the girls i don't

05:57:22.260 --> 05:57:26.820
like we would see people guessing about who was gonna play who like people thought i was gonna

05:57:26.820 --> 05:57:31.380
be icy or someone or whatever the fuck um just because i was cute and funny in another life

05:57:31.380 --> 05:57:41.220
another reincarnation reincarnation and i don't see like i don't see myself as like even loving

05:57:41.220 --> 05:57:45.700
playing a cute funny character i don't see myself like they everybody was casted so perfectly

05:57:46.660 --> 05:57:49.460
and people thought i was gonna be icy or emmy because i was cute funny

05:57:51.060 --> 05:57:57.140
and i i i was very um yandere masochistic type

05:57:57.220 --> 05:58:07.140
i've got a dmg manager yeah yeah i did it twice my manager was like what the fuck

sorry i'm reading something that i didn't in the context of

05:58:45.060 --> 05:58:47.060
um

05:58:49.700 --> 05:58:55.780
but yeah no i i read a lot about so rgb rgb rgb rgb rgb i um

05:58:57.460 --> 05:59:01.220
i'm right up on a lot of stuff uh you guys also gave me some advice which is actually

05:59:01.220 --> 05:59:06.820
very helpful i did read it even if i didn't respond to you um i always read all the maros even

05:59:06.820 --> 05:59:11.700
if i don't respond um usually because i don't respond because i want to give the same energy

05:59:11.700 --> 05:59:15.620
back or i don't know what to say to be honest although i can yeah sometimes i don't know how to

05:59:16.500 --> 05:59:19.300
talk over text um

05:59:23.540 --> 05:59:29.620
real shibi better than pretend shibi um and i think i think people like it's been like because

05:59:29.620 --> 05:59:35.700
you i totally get it you have these expectations of a streamer because that's how they're marketed um

05:59:36.660 --> 05:59:44.340
and but then you have to realize that they're not going to be able to play the character all the time

05:59:44.340 --> 05:59:51.460
and if they can't impress it but yeah everybody everybody that was hired in my gen they all are

05:59:55.220 --> 05:59:58.660
it's just like so much like their characters in ways you know

05:59:59.540 --> 06:00:01.540
you

06:00:05.140 --> 06:00:09.860
all right no i like i always had respect like i'm i'm not someone who is like uh

06:00:10.580 --> 06:00:16.820
bsm oh like i always had respect for different niches and um

06:00:18.820 --> 06:00:26.020
different uh communities like that like um like sometimes i'll find something silly like pony play

06:00:26.980 --> 06:00:33.460
or like uh leather puppies or whatever the fuck like those are funny um and that's just not my thing

06:00:33.460 --> 06:00:37.380
i'm not gonna go and like outwardly just like go up to someone who i know is into that to be like

06:00:37.380 --> 06:00:43.140
you're fucking stupid like i don't i don't have the energy for that stuff you've been the best

06:00:43.140 --> 06:00:50.260
cap most surprised ever but then like i said the nice surprise you i turn it on i get real

06:00:51.220 --> 06:00:55.700

06:00:56.980 --> 06:01:00.500

06:01:09.540 --> 06:01:14.260
i'll put madam stockings in your mouth okay i need you to be crying

06:01:20.500 --> 06:01:22.260
um

06:01:27.140 --> 06:01:32.740
fuckles is that a new emoji i've no thing i've seen a kneeling emoji before

06:01:37.700 --> 06:01:43.060
like for me first yeah the algorithm works in mysterious ways um

06:01:45.060 --> 06:01:46.820
i actually got on my knees help um

06:01:46.900 --> 06:01:47.620
um

06:01:49.220 --> 06:01:58.980
strani said to all of us she wanted us to be ourselves because ourselves were how she saw

06:01:58.980 --> 06:02:06.580
the characters and i couldn't agree with her more and if you disagree with that you're totally

06:02:06.580 --> 06:02:17.220
entitled to that opinion um but i feel like people have really started to appreciate our

06:02:17.220 --> 06:02:23.300
personalities over the last week and it makes me happy like it makes me very happy i'm happy

06:02:24.420 --> 06:02:32.580
that there's somebody for everybody in this company like sometimes you don't like every girl

06:02:32.660 --> 06:02:37.380
or you like one or two but it seems like the consensus is

06:02:40.660 --> 06:02:46.340
like you all like us for our different quirks and our different hobbies and our different

06:02:46.340 --> 06:02:49.300
skills and talents and it just makes me so happy

06:02:52.660 --> 06:02:56.900
and i feel bad because you know people are like oh

06:02:56.900 --> 06:03:00.340
feeler is going to be dead on arrival just because you know the type of content we do on the side

06:03:01.300 --> 06:03:09.780
and i just i'm so excited to see like the next year when we've proved them wrong and we show that

06:03:10.340 --> 06:03:13.460
we're a normal company we just do patreon 18 plus content

06:03:15.620 --> 06:03:18.820
that's it like that's the only difference i'm still a normal streamer

06:03:21.300 --> 06:03:24.660
swimming around about strani's pale she's always been supportive and encouraging as

06:03:24.660 --> 06:03:30.020
content creator yeah like this is the most self-sacrificing woman i've ever met like

06:03:31.700 --> 06:03:36.100
just like what she did for some girls one time she's like collab with me i'm gonna give you the

06:03:36.980 --> 06:03:41.140
the the money for it because you've been screwed because of your past cut like that just

06:03:42.500 --> 06:03:45.380
like why wouldn't i want to work for someone who's like that you know

06:03:47.300 --> 06:03:53.300
why wouldn't i want to work with the other girls who their previous content shows

06:03:55.140 --> 06:03:59.860
positive character their silliness their talents

06:04:02.820 --> 06:04:05.780
i like you guys because you guys are way more mellow than other creators i know delman

06:04:06.580 --> 06:04:10.020
yeah you know what's a bummer is you know as an agency

06:04:11.460 --> 06:04:14.980
vtuber you do have to be a little bit you know more corporate professional

06:04:15.780 --> 06:04:19.620
and i will i'll be like that sometimes i have my moments where i'm like that because i want

06:04:19.780 --> 06:04:29.220
i truly want this company be great i i said to myself have i managed to get into

06:04:29.220 --> 06:04:39.460
velar i will do everything in my power to make it great and succeed because i know if we do

06:04:40.500 --> 06:04:47.060
you will set different precedents for deep vtuber agencies showing that you can still treat your

06:04:48.020 --> 06:04:57.700
talents as human beings you can pay them well you can still make a profit you can invest in the right spots

06:05:00.660 --> 06:05:08.020
um and you can branch out to other platforms safely and you can allow 18 plus content in

06:05:09.060 --> 06:05:15.060
monitor and manage it safely and there's a way like there's a lot of things in place that

06:05:16.020 --> 06:05:22.900
our management team do so that we have peace of mind so that we are have good mental health

06:05:23.860 --> 06:05:29.460
um yeah i want i want it to be a positive for it because a lot of people say we're not going to be

06:05:29.460 --> 06:05:37.220
we're like uh i've seen like even this before i was joined this is before i applied um like watching

06:05:37.220 --> 06:05:42.100
like the drama channels or whatever or people talking about it people are like oh they're

06:05:42.100 --> 06:05:48.260
going to be dead on arrival oh they're sketchy it's a scam it's this that it is it just bums me out

06:05:50.580 --> 06:05:56.740
just because of what happened in strice past you're going to damn the people that are going

06:05:56.740 --> 06:06:04.740
to be in the company in the future um it's a bummer i know we're going to miss out on a lot of

06:06:04.740 --> 06:06:09.700
opportunities before that for because of that but i don't give a shit because i'm going to

06:06:09.700 --> 06:06:14.020
fucking show everybody we're going to be fucking amazing i've been waiting for false to make a video

06:06:14.020 --> 06:06:19.060
and you guys will be probably they're probably not going to and i actually don't mind it because

06:06:19.060 --> 06:06:30.020
we don't give a kind of attention we don't get haters so when we see 18 plus content you will

06:06:30.020 --> 06:06:35.780
never see my flesh in 18 plus content i will say that right now you will never see i'm not going to

06:06:35.780 --> 06:06:42.740
be fucking finger blasting myself my rtx form i will only be doing um patreon like and i'm sorry if

06:06:42.740 --> 06:06:48.020
you were expecting that i'm not going to be doing that i don't feel comfortable doing that um i will be

06:06:48.020 --> 06:06:57.140
doing uh loot audio and that is on my patreon in my description and i will probably be um doing like

06:06:57.140 --> 06:07:06.340
3d stuff like project melody style or uh playing like iregames um i want to learn

06:07:06.820 --> 06:07:11.540
poll so i can do 3d dancing and stuff because that'd be really fucking cool i feel like that'd

06:07:11.540 --> 06:07:18.500
be good like work out yeah i'm already kind of broken

06:07:25.940 --> 06:07:26.580
i'm reading up

06:07:29.300 --> 06:07:32.180
i feel like a lot of people in this news especially if you drop the act because

06:07:32.180 --> 06:07:35.380
like more natural probably because of the company and people back into the fan

06:07:36.180 --> 06:07:42.900
yeah don't knock it till you try it i always say give something jujitsu on stream that'd be funny

06:07:43.460 --> 06:07:45.620
um haven't done jujitsu in a bit though so

06:07:49.220 --> 06:07:54.340
um i forgot what i was gonna say but yeah yeah i can't wait to do hoonipop

06:07:54.340 --> 06:07:59.540
we want to establish ourselves on other platforms first before we kind of branch out um

06:07:59.540 --> 06:08:06.980
starting to explain it into her like exposing vealer thing that she wants us yet to be established

06:08:06.980 --> 06:08:12.740
on the main platforms it's because you know you'll be more successful she knows the algorithm

06:08:12.740 --> 06:08:17.940
she's working the industry for a while and then you'll branch out to other ones once we've been

06:08:17.940 --> 06:08:21.220
you know solidified on youtube and patreon

06:08:21.220 --> 06:08:30.900
i mean like want to see what she has to say

06:08:30.900 --> 06:08:38.580
uh yeah that's on yeah like i feel like when when false first announced and even like kaiyo

06:08:38.580 --> 06:08:46.180
like that other guy um they were covering vealer it was mostly about the negative reaction

06:08:46.180 --> 06:08:52.820
and then like there's like a minute of positive because that's just how news and media works

06:08:52.820 --> 06:08:59.780
you get more clicks and more views when you cover the negative aspects of stuff so it makes sense

06:08:59.780 --> 06:09:11.220
that when you do a report on a company and you really mostly highlight the vocal minority because

06:09:11.220 --> 06:09:16.420
a lot of people were actually pretty positive about vealer when i was like to my own uh lurking

06:09:18.100 --> 06:09:22.500
people are all gonna assume that oh this is actually the majority so it just it really did

06:09:22.500 --> 06:09:25.460
you know it's it's what drives the clicks yeah exactly

06:09:27.540 --> 06:09:30.980
great turn on you feels a lot more personal compared to the best of two that makes us yeah

06:09:30.980 --> 06:09:39.540
like i i love like i didn't think i would love like i'm uh so people wonder about like my history

06:09:39.540 --> 06:09:47.540
with like because i didn't do any sfw stuff on my past life um except my sfw history it was

06:09:48.180 --> 06:09:54.340
i don't only fans for like a month and i was like nah i'm fine i was like i needed like some

06:09:54.340 --> 06:10:07.620
extra cash real quick and then i um drew uh sfw content and i i haven't ever used i hadn't ever

06:10:07.620 --> 06:10:19.300
used a 3d o before um i never recorded super loot content like i would make like jokes and stuff

06:10:19.300 --> 06:10:26.900
from like read silly um scripts from like a mars a smart script haven't like read it or whatever

06:10:27.940 --> 06:10:36.260
but like i realized i actually like making this content and i love voice acting in this way for

06:10:36.260 --> 06:10:46.500
you guys um see yeah it's it's a completely new world for me and i'm realizing i enjoy a lot and

06:10:46.500 --> 06:10:53.700
like don't think oh she was corrupted all this or that no i'm an adult woman no one's coercing me into

06:10:53.700 --> 06:11:00.180
fucking anything relax um con while i've heard of that i've never been there before

06:11:00.180 --> 06:11:08.180
and yeah and it's like i i realized i was good at it the first time i sent a script the like i

06:11:08.180 --> 06:11:14.660
filled something for strani she it was just like did you edit this and i'm like no she's like

06:11:14.660 --> 06:11:20.260
because i sent this to the editor and they were like all i had to do was to add the effects

06:11:22.500 --> 06:11:28.260
and i'm like really she's like fuck yeah that was fucking if she's like if you record like this

06:11:28.260 --> 06:11:31.780
it's everything's gonna be a breeze and she's like you've never done this before and i'm like no

06:11:33.620 --> 06:11:37.140
she's like what the fuck anyways here's some more scripts and so yeah

06:11:38.500 --> 06:11:43.780
and like i'm still learning like i'm still growing as i do voice acting for this stuff

06:11:44.660 --> 06:11:48.820
and i feel like you'll notice as i because she gave us scripts like for month like

06:11:49.540 --> 06:11:54.900
dune audios for this month july audios for this month august audios september audios blah blah blah

06:11:54.980 --> 06:12:01.300
i think you'll notice as i record different months um i do improve and stuff

06:12:03.620 --> 06:12:08.100
and we'll be able to donate super chats as always oh no that's okay that's okay that's a good question

06:12:08.100 --> 06:12:13.620
um we all just applied for monetization so hopefully soon um i know strani is worried about me

06:12:13.620 --> 06:12:23.060
and azura being monetized because of um because of our what we look like with our cake old bitties

06:12:25.220 --> 06:12:31.540
halloween's gonna be hectic yeah it'd be cool what should i be for halloween

06:12:32.740 --> 06:12:39.940
i don't even like it's but also like i also want you guys to know um when strani sent me a lot of strips

06:12:39.940 --> 06:12:47.540
a strips oh uh scripts a lot of the stuff was like office related because my lore is like i work

06:12:47.540 --> 06:12:53.940
to an office so a lot of it's like your boss does this and so she for for a couple of months

06:12:53.940 --> 06:12:58.980
you're not gonna get any like super i'm sorry like and if you can remove yourself from the

06:12:58.980 --> 06:13:02.100
patreon if you want that'll be honest with you you're still gonna enjoy what you hear

06:13:02.980 --> 06:13:08.180
trust me um i've heard some of the girls they for some of mine everybody's fucking good

06:13:08.660 --> 06:13:13.620
um the heart she wants to do a whole like month for like hard dom for me because it seems

06:13:13.620 --> 06:13:19.060
like that's what people want our boss does what your boss catches you doing something that's all i'm

06:13:19.060 --> 06:13:24.820
gonna say um yeah my next audio she she's staggering out the audio so you guys technically

06:13:24.820 --> 06:13:30.980
get an audio every day if you're subscribed to all of us which is pretty fucking awesome my opinion

06:13:30.980 --> 06:13:40.260
so you never like you just be mindless for a week um but yeah it knows i like i feel like i'm a

06:13:40.260 --> 06:13:46.420
there are some where i'm like heart like but it's always in the a lot of it is in the environment

06:13:46.420 --> 06:13:51.620
of an office that's what i mean it's not like there's not a lot in the environment of like a fucking

06:13:51.620 --> 06:14:02.340
sex engine that's like which is what people are expecting big brain scheduling again can't just

06:14:02.340 --> 06:14:11.380
be that yeah essentially pretty much um so yeah i feel like because but like there's also cool stuff

06:14:11.380 --> 06:14:18.660
like i don't i don't really think i'm it's a it's bad thing to spoil it and she never said we couldn't

06:14:18.660 --> 06:14:24.500
like talk about the scripts you felt but like i'm also like your roommate in one of them i'm also

06:14:24.500 --> 06:14:33.220
your um classmate i'm also like someone you just match with until like it's so it's a lot of cool

06:14:33.220 --> 06:14:40.820
different scenarios um i'm dom and generally the majority of them um literally of course the

06:14:40.820 --> 06:14:48.580
first one you guys vote to listen to was my literally my one sub audio i recorded out of

06:14:49.860 --> 06:14:59.460
like 27 well i don't think it was that much but it was just funny uh and first yeah

06:15:02.980 --> 06:15:09.700
i know and then i was just like and so it tied with uh with a different one that was me dom

06:15:09.780 --> 06:15:13.620
and i'm like strani please pick the one that's dom or they're gonna be like what the fuck is this

06:15:13.620 --> 06:15:17.700
this is not what we signed up for she's like oh i already uploaded the other one and i'm like god damn it

06:15:21.540 --> 06:15:27.380
any of them considers rich uh i don't really know you guys will have to tell me to be honest

06:15:27.380 --> 06:15:30.500
or like um tell strani cuz strani is the one who puts the tags in

06:15:31.300 --> 06:15:40.900
yeah i know i'd not like even when i before i read the script like i read the title i was like oh

06:15:40.900 --> 06:15:47.540
this is what's gonna happen i'm like that's not what happened like it was it's i love reading the

06:15:47.540 --> 06:15:54.340
scripts before i like um read them out you're like record them because then i just get like really

06:15:54.340 --> 06:16:05.220
surprised and i'm like oh man oh whoa oh gosh um but yeah so like this like we're all gonna be

06:16:05.220 --> 06:16:18.420
doing a variety of content and roles situation it's really fun um i also like i want to do

06:16:18.420 --> 06:16:22.980
cuz i really like asmr role plays like i like just reading scripts and doing like guided

06:16:22.980 --> 06:16:28.740
meditations and like sleep aids and stuff so i'm gonna have a lot of that on my channel um just

06:16:28.740 --> 06:16:37.540
like safer work stuff i think strani is having someone edit my um one of my safer work audios

06:16:39.380 --> 06:16:43.380
and we're waiting for monetization for her to and then she's gonna put it it's like a

06:16:44.020 --> 06:16:47.460
i'm so excited for it i worked really hard on it so i hope it comes out good

06:16:47.620 --> 06:16:56.020
um yeah like uh i think guided meditation would be really cool

06:17:01.300 --> 06:17:03.860
you read watershed down in fifth grade yes i did

06:17:06.820 --> 06:17:12.100
cuz i was weird and i like warrior cats and watershed down is actually very similar to warrior

06:17:12.100 --> 06:17:17.060
cats i'm entire playlist asmr so you know how i've been watching lately and this is

06:17:17.060 --> 06:17:23.460
they're one of my favorite um asmr this lately i don't know if you guys know who king hobbit is

06:17:23.460 --> 06:17:31.940
but she's the cutest uh girl i think she's from the uk and um and it's like she's just like

06:17:31.940 --> 06:17:38.340
so fucking goofy and she's all over the place and she has the cutest like accent uh i highly

06:17:38.340 --> 06:17:44.980
recommend you watching king hobbit she's so adorable i definitely wish i could make content

06:17:44.980 --> 06:17:51.300
like i want to learn how to make like um content or i can kind of like smack my head

06:17:51.300 --> 06:17:59.300
on over my rtx face and do like visual triggers you know like i'm like wave my hands in your face

06:17:59.300 --> 06:18:03.940
and shit because i feel like like the lag with a 3d model oh you know or maybe i could try

06:18:03.940 --> 06:18:10.100
with 3d model um i know there's some vtubers that do that but if i could like motion track

06:18:10.180 --> 06:18:17.140
my models head over my body i think that would be and do like visual triggers i think that'd be

06:18:17.140 --> 06:18:24.020
really fun yeah exactly like how onigiri does it with her cooking like i would love to do that with

06:18:24.660 --> 06:18:29.620
asmr and i've seen like there was one creator i saw that actually was doing it for like music

06:18:29.620 --> 06:18:35.300
related stuff i think he was like playing a ukulele he's like a really goofy looking um really cool

06:18:35.300 --> 06:18:41.860
stylized um almost looks like something from like cyberspace what was that gay what was that tv show

06:18:42.500 --> 06:18:49.060
cyber kids i don't know looks like something out of that and i was like oh that'd be sick to apply

06:18:49.060 --> 06:18:55.220
to asmr and there's also somebody who did that something similar before that um tv ties you

06:18:55.220 --> 06:19:02.100
have asmr reply there's actually something like that i don't like android no not cyberpunk

06:19:02.100 --> 06:19:08.820
cyberchase thank you cyberchase spy kids great oh yes spy kids game over

06:19:10.180 --> 06:19:16.580
i can love those movies yes cyberchase like he's he's like a cyberchase stylized

06:19:17.300 --> 06:19:22.580
um vtuber vtuber model and i think they rigged and drew it themselves but they yeah they

06:19:23.140 --> 06:19:28.420
uh they motion tracked their models head over their body but you could see like their hands and he would

06:19:28.900 --> 06:19:35.620
play guitar or ukulele i was like oh my gosh imagine this applied in like asmr sense

06:19:35.620 --> 06:19:42.100
and i feel like it would be easier for monetization because um you like

06:19:43.860 --> 06:19:50.260
like when a human if a human gets to review a video um they would see that no i'm not doing

06:19:50.260 --> 06:19:56.180
something inappropriate i'm just like doing a trigger and with like because a lot of times um

06:19:57.140 --> 06:20:02.980
like people do like ear oil stuff and they're like oh it's sucking pee pee

06:20:06.420 --> 06:20:08.260
yeah the only the three original movies 100%

06:20:10.820 --> 06:20:17.140
be locally accurate asmr yeah i can't wait to go i think i might go to like a craft store and um

06:20:18.580 --> 06:20:23.380
get some stuff for the like like a michael's or something or joined fabrics and get some

06:20:24.100 --> 06:20:27.540
stuff for the asmr stream that's me

06:20:30.500 --> 06:20:34.900
a human i know right and i'll like or at least like maybe with bots like they would be like oh there's

06:20:34.900 --> 06:20:40.340
a person in this but they have a cartoon head that's fine i don't know because like asmr is being

06:20:40.340 --> 06:20:46.580
really cracked down on lately on um youtube no matter what type of creator you are whether you're

06:20:47.220 --> 06:20:55.620
flash or vtuber so it's kind of a bummer like any like like recent um asmr content old stuff

06:20:55.620 --> 06:21:02.020
hasn't been flagged by bots but new stuff that's being uploaded gets um gets pretty

06:21:02.020 --> 06:21:03.060
shadow on which sucks

06:21:06.180 --> 06:21:09.860
can't wait for the learner to probably tie shabarovs i know i need to get like shabarovs

06:21:09.860 --> 06:21:15.140
so i can learn that time i don't i don't know what the f**k up so bad you guys are gonna laugh at me

06:21:16.980 --> 06:21:23.780
oh i think mercy is streaming now so if you guys um want to hang out with mercy i understand

06:21:23.780 --> 06:21:27.860
the rumors i'm just gapping we're just talking about industry stuff maybe alert stuff

06:21:28.660 --> 06:21:32.740
like some big yaptos of course yeah yeah of course

06:21:33.780 --> 06:21:40.980
magic ram harness to start i've seen what those look like i was thinking about um tying my legs

06:21:40.980 --> 06:21:45.140
because i was watching somebody tie their legs and i'm like oh that'd be cool because then i can just

06:21:45.140 --> 06:21:51.300
do like like i can just like angle my camera on my desk i think properly and just like tie my legs

06:22:06.500 --> 06:22:11.780

maybe maybe i'll do that as a freebie

06:25:07.220 --> 06:25:12.340
i like adding my own sound effects to stuff like when i did like the one of my all of you

06:25:12.340 --> 06:25:19.140
being in a cage in like me having breakfast i literally i literally had placed my phone

06:25:19.140 --> 06:25:25.460
in my cat's crate opened the door took my phone out walked all the way to my closet and then recorded

06:25:25.460 --> 06:25:38.900

06:25:43.220 --> 06:25:47.780
beef round beef no was it a beef no i made like a really good beef stew from this beef that i got

06:25:47.780 --> 06:25:54.900
and i also got like a giant ass salmon now i was like jiggles tits excitedly

06:25:59.860 --> 06:26:05.940
it'd be so much more colorful yeah what sucks is like i i genuinely don't know how

06:26:05.940 --> 06:26:11.700
i'm gonna do like i need to figure like ever corded me cooking and baking before but it was

06:26:11.700 --> 06:26:15.940
hard and i had to use another laptop i don't know if i'll have that laptop much much longer

06:26:15.940 --> 06:26:21.540
because it's a company laptop and if i leave this company they're gonna yoink it for me maybe i don't

06:26:21.540 --> 06:26:32.740
know um so who knows i was supposed to give it back a year ago but they haven't they haven't

06:26:32.740 --> 06:26:40.180
asked for it back yet so they're like you'll be you'll expect the the uh the boxes to return

06:26:40.260 --> 06:26:44.900
from when i worked from home the boxes to return died nice how am i gonna let me out

06:26:46.740 --> 06:26:50.260
i got a 5k display just chilling and a computer

06:26:52.980 --> 06:26:56.660
and i'm like please don't ask from the back because i can sell that display or i can use it

06:26:57.540 --> 06:27:08.340
yeah i definitely choked on a kinder egg when i was a kid

06:27:09.380 --> 06:27:12.820
did i or was it something else i don't know i put a lot of stuff in my mouth as a kid

06:27:13.860 --> 06:27:17.220
that sounded so fucked up i meant like toys i like to chew on things

06:27:17.540 --> 06:27:26.340
but xlossin should be not true no but the thing is like they um

06:27:28.340 --> 06:27:36.340
they remote manage it so well the the the display i could probably keep but the the

06:27:36.340 --> 06:27:37.460
laptop they remote manage

06:27:41.060 --> 06:27:45.780
i remember i swallowed a quarter when i was a kid and i had to poop it out

06:27:47.300 --> 06:27:48.900
or it might still be in my system i don't know

06:27:53.380 --> 06:27:56.900
i literally just remembered that right now holy shit that i swallowed a quarter

06:27:56.900 --> 06:28:01.140
my mom was so frustrated with me i have to ask my mom about that i was like oh yeah

06:28:01.140 --> 06:28:03.380
i didn't swallow it what the fuck i did swallow weird stuff

06:28:07.540 --> 06:28:09.860
what what the cookie put what the fuck is that

06:28:10.500 --> 06:28:17.540
i was i'm tempted to like jailbreak it i really am

06:28:19.140 --> 06:28:26.100
it's been seven hours holy shit bro hi well a bunch of us is gonna get chopped i'm probably gonna

06:28:27.300 --> 06:28:33.700
right now are you gonna jump there we go um i'm probably gonna cut from when i

06:28:33.700 --> 06:28:52.340
came back crying and shit um and what else and then probably rena is rubbing against my

06:28:52.340 --> 06:29:01.460
microphone lady um and i'll probably keep in when i got my food and when

06:29:03.700 --> 06:29:15.540
i got to the house we're not keeping that listen i was trying to make my model more

06:29:15.540 --> 06:29:22.980
accurate to my skin tone i was trying to find it and i should have done it off stream because

06:29:22.980 --> 06:29:25.700
it just looked bad against this mall

06:29:31.060 --> 06:29:35.860
yeah i'm gonna when i went on brb i'm gonna cut out when i came back

06:29:37.380 --> 06:29:40.660

06:32:03.540 --> 06:32:05.700
yeah so yeah

06:32:12.180 --> 06:32:19.300
my mom calls it fibro fog because you just kind of like forget because my mom is fibro and i have fibro

06:32:20.260 --> 06:32:25.620
well my fibro is actually been finitely i haven't been stressed so i haven't been having flare-ups and my

06:32:25.620 --> 06:32:32.420
bodies feel okay my arm kind of hurts i've had like maybe like one migraine i'm actually doing okay

06:32:32.420 --> 06:32:37.220
i think because i'm happy that i'm streaming again it was hard being away from streaming for so long

06:32:39.540 --> 06:32:40.980
i was only like dying

06:32:43.140 --> 06:32:48.500
yeah and like i'm a little stressed because like my fucking you know my dad and now my

06:32:48.580 --> 06:32:53.060
my landlord and all that but you know i just i have faith that everything will be okay

06:32:54.980 --> 06:33:01.940
we're together we're good i got you guys i got my girls i got my management team

06:33:04.980 --> 06:33:11.380
i got my parents i got my therapist i got my friends i will be a okay and that's what i

06:33:11.380 --> 06:33:12.500
always have to remind myself

06:33:17.780 --> 06:33:24.340
sometimes i tend to be like kind of a doomer and just like really get really down and

06:33:25.220 --> 06:33:30.260
i've been trying to practice on not doing that then it only just makes me have a flare-up

06:33:30.260 --> 06:33:34.420
and i'm just like can't fucking move yeah

06:33:34.660 --> 06:33:36.660
yeah

06:33:40.660 --> 06:33:50.500
and my dad has um diabetes genetic though not like um health like diet related i forget is it

06:33:50.500 --> 06:33:54.580
like i was gonna type one and type two confused but it doesn't even matter because he actually

06:33:54.580 --> 06:34:01.460
technically has both he has like that weird rare one where it's like the he needs he can manage it

06:34:01.460 --> 06:34:07.700
with his diet but he like he still has an insulin pump um i will actually which really sucks i'll

06:34:07.700 --> 06:34:12.100
probably end up being diabetic too because genetically um all the women in my family have it

06:34:13.540 --> 06:34:22.020
so i'm more like so i try to eat right um i try to you know stay on top of my a1c

06:34:24.020 --> 06:34:28.100
i know there's like another a couple of other v2 births that have diabetes

06:34:28.820 --> 06:34:38.100
and like i'm my dad has educated me a lot on stuff and i'm not like scared of needles or

06:34:38.100 --> 06:34:43.220
anything if i had to do that so yeah i'm very like my my dad's like very hard on me because he

06:34:43.220 --> 06:34:48.500
doesn't want me to get it but it's very much a possibility all of my other members my dad's

06:34:48.580 --> 06:34:50.740
side have gotten it like literally before the age of 35

06:34:54.820 --> 06:34:56.660
and i'm 56 so you never know

06:35:02.660 --> 06:35:07.140
oh my homies hate genetic predispositions i always like to tease my parents i'm like you guys just

06:35:07.140 --> 06:35:13.620
had to have a kid and sit off this genetic bomb of all these fucking issues that i get to

06:35:14.260 --> 06:35:22.500
do stupid genes like a rid of all mine i don't wear denim anymore

06:35:22.500 --> 06:35:34.100
fuck denim um but yeah i'm on top of it and i like i know like i've encouraged some

06:35:34.100 --> 06:35:39.220
of you guys to be healthy from what you guys have said in my marrows with like um with my

06:35:39.300 --> 06:35:47.540
asthma and stuff that i was like telling people to um you know tell tell like five good things about

06:35:47.540 --> 06:35:52.340
them and like try to eat better and work out that's actually motivated me back that like you guys

06:35:52.340 --> 06:35:57.140
are like yeah i'm trying to work on myself and i'm like you know what i'm working on myself too

06:35:58.500 --> 06:36:01.300
we're all here working on ourselves

06:36:01.540 --> 06:36:09.380
we're improving because you know my mom always told me that um

06:36:11.460 --> 06:36:17.940
what is it a relationship you always want to grow from a relationship

06:36:19.060 --> 06:36:22.580
you always want to grow into another person no matter what the relationship is you know

06:36:24.900 --> 06:36:29.780
are you feeling it no i didn't sleep last night i think i probably fucked up my sleep schedule

06:36:29.860 --> 06:36:34.500
because i'm actually okay right now i also had like a really big coffee

06:36:37.060 --> 06:36:38.100
in the middle of the day

06:36:41.380 --> 06:36:42.740
i'm girl feeling again

06:36:50.740 --> 06:36:53.700
now that you mentioned it actually i'm getting like a little eepy

06:36:55.300 --> 06:36:59.700
i just don't want to stop talking to you guys oh i feel so fucking cringe when i say that

06:36:59.780 --> 06:37:01.140
i hate it so much i'm sorry

06:37:06.020 --> 06:37:07.780
do you have like teardrops what do you mean

06:37:12.500 --> 06:37:16.820
it's highlighted on my model my eyes

06:37:23.460 --> 06:37:28.500
no i don't like i don't like you baka what are you talking about i don't like you

06:37:30.740 --> 06:37:33.460
i don't know what kind of like you you're stinky

06:37:36.580 --> 06:37:38.020
who could like someone like you

06:37:42.420 --> 06:37:45.780
not me that's for sure

06:37:45.940 --> 06:38:01.780
you're gonna call me a stinker fuck you mods take them out

06:38:06.100 --> 06:38:13.700
was i talking like her they actually like her i know i accidentally did like

06:38:13.780 --> 06:38:20.100
doki birds exact voice one time i didn't even mean to because she has like a

06:38:22.660 --> 06:38:28.580
she has like a little bit this is me analyzing her voice patterns not like insulting or anything

06:38:28.580 --> 06:38:34.740
she has like a little bit of like a nasal thing and when she laughs i can't i have to listen to her

06:38:34.740 --> 06:38:42.420
right now but again but i realized i could i could do her voice pretty well and like it does

06:38:42.420 --> 06:38:47.540
have the and she has like a little bit of a cry but it's very very subtle

06:38:52.500 --> 06:38:58.660
involve the doki laugh if i could actually i can listen to it and i can probably do it

06:38:59.060 --> 06:39:10.500
i can turn my headphone back on

06:39:15.220 --> 06:39:16.260
playing death mark

06:39:18.580 --> 06:39:22.900

I got it earlier.

06:43:26.740 --> 06:43:30.740
I just flipped my spoon and it was really cool.

06:43:30.740 --> 06:43:32.740
I don't know.

06:43:32.740 --> 06:43:34.740
I just don't feel like...

06:43:34.740 --> 06:43:36.740
I need to learn more.

06:43:36.740 --> 06:43:38.740
I just listen and I mimic.

06:43:38.740 --> 06:43:40.740
That's all I do.

06:43:40.740 --> 06:43:42.740
I'm not trained or whatever.

06:43:46.740 --> 06:43:48.740
My model looks so funny when I eat.

06:43:48.740 --> 06:43:50.740
I'm really having...

06:43:50.740 --> 06:43:52.740
I'm really having a bad time.

06:43:52.740 --> 06:43:54.740
I'm having a bad time.

06:43:54.740 --> 06:43:56.740
I'm having a bad time.

06:43:56.740 --> 06:43:58.740
I'm having a bad time.

06:43:58.740 --> 06:44:00.740
I'm having a really bad fucking cramps.

06:44:04.740 --> 06:44:06.740
I think it's my tummy though.

06:44:14.740 --> 06:44:16.740
I don't even know how I would train.

06:44:16.740 --> 06:44:18.740
How the fuck? It's cold.

06:44:18.740 --> 06:44:20.740
But it's okay.

06:44:24.740 --> 06:44:26.740
Do I have to fart real bad or something?

06:44:26.740 --> 06:44:28.740
What the fuck is wrong with me?

06:44:34.740 --> 06:44:36.740
I never try to do Amelie's voice.

06:44:38.740 --> 06:44:40.740
I'm actually better at doing higher voices

06:44:40.740 --> 06:44:42.740
than I am voices that are similar

06:44:42.740 --> 06:44:45.740
and like deep like a mature as mine.

06:44:45.740 --> 06:44:46.740
I don't know.

06:44:46.740 --> 06:44:48.740
I only have a bunch of a mommy voice.

06:44:48.740 --> 06:44:50.740
Naturally.

06:44:52.740 --> 06:44:54.740
I do put on my mommy voice just a little bit.

06:44:56.740 --> 06:44:58.740
I don't know what I would do with it.

06:45:02.740 --> 06:45:04.740
Go to bed!

06:45:04.740 --> 06:45:06.740

06:46:46.120 --> 06:46:48.120
I'll do karaoke, like that'll be fun.

06:46:48.820 --> 06:46:50.820
Cause I just don't take karaoke seriously.

06:46:50.820 --> 06:46:53.320
Like none of my singing stuff will be a professional.

06:46:53.820 --> 06:46:58.520
My cover only sounds okay cause I'm good at like rapping.

06:46:59.320 --> 06:47:00.220
And um...

06:47:01.320 --> 06:47:05.220
Sorry I'm fine for my life cause I feel like I just got stabbed in the fucking gut.

06:47:07.520 --> 06:47:10.320
Rapping, maybe am I getting food poisoning from this shit?

06:47:11.020 --> 06:47:13.320
I swear to fucking god this will give me food poisoning.

06:47:16.520 --> 06:47:17.520
I hate it here.

06:47:17.520 --> 06:47:18.520
Um...

06:47:20.020 --> 06:47:22.020
I'm doing, yeah I would definitely rap.

06:47:23.020 --> 06:47:24.020
Um...

06:47:25.720 --> 06:47:27.520
I really want to learn how to scream.

06:47:27.520 --> 06:47:29.520
I've already said that, scream and growl.

06:47:34.720 --> 06:47:36.020
I'm in mume's range?

06:47:36.820 --> 06:47:40.720
I'll be honest, I don't watch a lot of holo girls because...

06:47:42.620 --> 06:47:45.220
They scare me cause they're so talented.

06:47:47.020 --> 06:47:49.020
Rap god, she be.

06:47:51.020 --> 06:47:58.020
I have done rap god and oh my god I'm not gonna eat the rest of this fuck cause my stomach is fucking killing me now.

06:47:58.020 --> 06:47:59.020
Um...

06:48:01.020 --> 06:48:02.020
Who do I watch?

06:48:02.020 --> 06:48:03.520
I only watch small corpos.

06:48:07.020 --> 06:48:08.520
And I watch indies.

06:48:10.020 --> 06:48:13.020
And I watch my friends from appeal.

06:48:14.020 --> 06:48:16.020
Maybe I need to fart holo.

06:48:17.120 --> 06:48:18.120
I'm not sure I can say this.

06:48:22.020 --> 06:48:23.520
That did not help.

06:48:26.020 --> 06:48:28.020
I don't know who Lauren would be back.

06:48:29.020 --> 06:48:33.020
When my use is a higher register most of the time if she stops and breaks the cafe if she goes into a v-boy.

06:48:33.020 --> 06:48:34.520
Oh I didn't really know that.

06:48:34.520 --> 06:48:36.520
Pia what the fuck are you doing?

06:48:36.520 --> 06:48:38.520
Why are you clawing at my chair?

06:48:38.520 --> 06:48:41.520
Sometimes she's lazy, sometimes she takes off and helps.

06:48:41.520 --> 06:48:43.520
Because she's jumping into my lap.

06:48:43.520 --> 06:48:44.520
