01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You

03:30.000 --> 03:41.640
Okay, hold on. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. My 3d. Oh

03:45.080 --> 03:53.440
I tested everything before I started I tested everything this is my normal microphone

03:53.440 --> 03:55.980
I was gonna whisper for some reason

03:56.980 --> 04:01.020
My scarlet isn't working, so I'm trying to trouble you

04:02.460 --> 04:06.380
But don't worry we're going to really get it

04:07.860 --> 04:09.860
So just give me a moment. I

04:11.700 --> 04:15.780
Apologize I literally have been ready for over an hour

04:16.900 --> 04:21.180
Over an hour and then it decided I don't understand

04:21.300 --> 04:23.300
I

04:24.820 --> 04:29.700
Think my cat might have unblocked my scarlet from my computer hold on

04:51.300 --> 04:53.300
I

05:01.420 --> 05:03.420
Know it doesn't mean

05:07.300 --> 05:09.300
I

05:21.180 --> 05:23.180
I

05:51.180 --> 05:53.180
I

06:22.180 --> 06:24.180
Quiet

06:36.620 --> 06:38.620
Okay

06:51.180 --> 07:00.780
You might

07:05.140 --> 07:07.140
You might hear my cat

07:08.060 --> 07:10.060
Munching in the background

07:11.100 --> 07:13.860
There's a lot of home you hear something

07:21.980 --> 07:24.540
I'm going to commit

07:32.700 --> 07:34.700
So

07:36.060 --> 07:38.060
Okay

07:51.660 --> 07:53.660
I

08:01.900 --> 08:03.900
Don't

08:06.660 --> 08:08.660
Kind of frustrated

08:13.140 --> 08:15.140
Scarlet

08:15.140 --> 08:25.140
I have to get like really in there, don't I?

08:25.140 --> 08:26.140
Okay.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.140
Hello, darlings.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.140
Headphones are maxed.

08:28.140 --> 08:48.140
Anyone as you go says you can't do me.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.140
Okay.

08:49.140 --> 08:54.140
Listen, I'm doing the post down here.

08:54.140 --> 09:04.140
A little different because if you have a certain type of headphones, it may not work.

09:04.140 --> 09:14.140
Alright, I'm on my keyboard.

09:14.140 --> 09:18.140
I'm picking up the 3DO.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.140
Okay.

09:19.140 --> 09:37.140
I don't really care because I think this would be really funny.

09:37.140 --> 09:48.140
It was really fun messing around with the settings on the VTube studio.

09:48.140 --> 09:54.140
My neighbors are walking by and they're being very loud.

09:54.140 --> 09:57.140
Good luck on your exam.

09:57.140 --> 10:04.140
Alright, so I thank you.

10:04.140 --> 10:08.140
Thank you for meeting me at the bar.

10:08.140 --> 10:21.140
I'm happy that you followed directions in my Tinder message that I sent to you.

10:21.140 --> 10:30.140
Because I sent you directions to this bar, don't worry that there's nobody else here.

10:30.140 --> 10:37.140
I especially reserved it for the both of us.

10:37.140 --> 10:47.140
I hope you don't mind what I don't know what a big bumping up is.

10:47.140 --> 10:54.140
I generally don't know why it's doing that.

10:54.140 --> 10:59.140
It's a big bar, but don't worry about anyone else.

10:59.140 --> 11:03.140
It's just me and you.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.140
I'm not rich.

11:05.140 --> 11:10.140
Why do you think I'm bartending behind this bar right now?

11:10.140 --> 11:15.140
I'm sorry I had to burp, but I didn't want to burp in your ear.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.140
Unless you want me to.

11:17.140 --> 11:22.140
But I'll be a professional madam for you tonight.

11:22.140 --> 11:30.140
So my darling, what would you like to drink?

11:30.140 --> 11:34.140
I can make you something.

11:34.140 --> 11:44.140
If you're under the age of drinking, I can also make you a mocktail if you'd like.

11:44.140 --> 11:46.140
I've been studying.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.140
I'm going to forgive you a little bit.

11:48.140 --> 11:52.140
I don't know, Mike.

11:52.140 --> 11:55.140
You want chalky milk?

11:55.140 --> 11:57.140
I can make you chalky milk.

11:57.140 --> 12:02.140
I almost went out and bought Vanta because I realized I had an advantage in a decade.

12:02.140 --> 12:05.140
Madam, your neck, don't worry about my neck.

12:05.140 --> 12:07.140
I still got that, though.

12:07.140 --> 12:12.140
And don't you forget it.

12:12.140 --> 12:15.140
So you'd like some cold water.

12:15.140 --> 12:21.140
You'd like dark coke, bloody Mary, strawberry milk.

12:21.140 --> 12:25.140
So no head.

12:25.140 --> 12:29.140
You'd like a bloody Mary, non-alcoholic.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.140
Okay.

12:30.140 --> 12:36.140
I have some lemonade and I have strawberry milk.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.140
Get out of here.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.140
I love oil.

12:38.140 --> 12:42.140
What is wrong with you people?

12:42.140 --> 12:43.140
Coke milk?

12:43.140 --> 12:44.140
Yes.

12:44.140 --> 12:45.140
I am milking.

12:45.140 --> 12:50.140
Is there a buyer in the bar?

12:50.140 --> 12:51.140
A shipping aid?

12:51.140 --> 12:54.140
Yes, that can be arranged.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.140
A bucket of soda.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.140
Got some bleach.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.140
Yeah, I got some bleach.

12:58.140 --> 13:02.140
I also have some ammonia as well.

13:02.140 --> 13:07.140
But yeah, don't worry that there's nobody else here.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.140
It's just me and you tonight.

13:09.140 --> 13:14.140
Okay, I'm going to take very good, very good care of you.

13:14.140 --> 13:18.140
All right, let me get some ice.

13:18.140 --> 13:20.140
All right, let me get some ice.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.140
Let's come right here.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.140
All right, go.

13:59.140 --> 14:01.140
I have some ice.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.140
I have no idea.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.140
I had to go to the back.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.140
I had to step away for a moment.

14:06.140 --> 14:09.140
In fact, I have to, hold on.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.140
I have to step away.

14:11.140 --> 14:13.140
I have to step away to do it.

14:13.140 --> 14:20.140
Let me just, I can't part.

14:20.140 --> 14:22.140
I'm trying really hard and I can't.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.140
Because I know the microphone.

14:24.140 --> 14:27.140
I'll pick it up.

14:27.140 --> 14:32.140
But I also have some ice.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.140
I have a nice setup.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.140
Not long.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.140
I am.

14:36.140 --> 14:38.140
You know, I worked really hard.

14:38.140 --> 14:39.140
I don't, hold on.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.140
I'm like very tall.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.140
Let me just, sorry.

14:43.140 --> 14:45.140
Do you know how to share it?

14:45.140 --> 14:46.140
Don't worry.

14:46.140 --> 14:48.140
I run very fine establishments.

14:48.140 --> 14:51.140
This is a bar within Wonderland Hotel.

14:51.140 --> 14:56.140
So, one long island ice tea.

14:56.140 --> 14:58.140
All right.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.140
Coming right up, you know.

15:00.140 --> 15:03.140
No one would want to like about ice though.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.140
I like about ice.

15:21.140 --> 15:39.140
Wow, that was like really, my teeth are sensitive.

15:39.140 --> 15:42.140
I just, I live, I live dangerously.

15:42.140 --> 15:45.140
I live very dangerously.

15:45.140 --> 15:48.140
I can't go over like this or that.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.140
We can ask for crushed ice, oh well.

15:50.140 --> 15:52.140
That's the only type of ice we serve.

15:52.140 --> 15:54.140
Hold on, let me crush it again for you.

16:18.140 --> 16:27.140
There, I spit it right into the glass for you.

16:27.140 --> 16:31.140
So, take a sip of that.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.140
What do you mean?

16:33.140 --> 16:36.140
You don't, you need a drink to go with it.

16:36.140 --> 16:40.140
Okay, let me, let me pour you something then, hold on.

16:48.140 --> 17:03.140
Okay.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.140
My favorite ambiance is here.

17:05.140 --> 17:16.140
It's my, it's my, my AC has made its arrival.

17:17.140 --> 17:31.140
I'm so happy I put a towel down because it just smells drinkable.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.140
Is it monster?

17:32.140 --> 17:42.140
No, it's not do.

17:42.140 --> 18:08.140
Because, you know, I got some out due because I'm going to mount it to you later.

18:08.140 --> 18:21.140
So it's only fair.

18:21.140 --> 18:36.140
The candle, oh god.

18:36.140 --> 18:51.140
All right, here, let me come out from behind the bar.

18:51.140 --> 18:55.140
Yeah, I teleported, whatever.

18:55.140 --> 19:15.140
So, uh, the effects are really nice.

19:15.140 --> 19:19.140
So, do you like my outfit?

19:19.140 --> 19:22.140
Only, you know, a torso.

19:22.140 --> 19:25.140
But do you like it?

19:25.140 --> 19:28.140
Uh, don't mind that.

19:28.140 --> 19:33.140
I'm not attached to my back.

19:33.140 --> 19:37.140
Don't worry about it.

19:37.140 --> 19:40.140
Don't worry.

19:40.140 --> 19:51.140
I was like, so ready to be so serious.

19:51.140 --> 19:55.140
And then I was messing around with all this stuff this morning.

19:55.140 --> 19:58.140
And I couldn't stop laughing.

19:58.140 --> 20:17.140
I don't know why my fingers break.

20:17.140 --> 20:24.140
There we go.

20:24.140 --> 20:38.140
Does that work for you?

20:38.140 --> 20:44.140
Do not be afraid.

20:44.140 --> 20:47.140
You are safe with me, my dear.

20:47.140 --> 20:51.140
My cat is climbing on my monitor.

20:51.140 --> 20:58.140
Hold on.

20:58.140 --> 21:07.140
My love, my god, please get down.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.140
Don't worry about it.

21:10.140 --> 21:13.140
Okay.

21:13.140 --> 21:18.140
She's like, was that only climbing over everything?

21:18.140 --> 21:40.140
You guys like me, like, is this okay with you?

21:40.140 --> 21:47.140
Like, what sucks is that when I turn to the side, it just disconnects.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.140
Don't use it.

21:50.140 --> 22:03.140
Okay.

22:03.140 --> 22:11.140
I got a new cup, and it's like textured.

22:11.140 --> 22:16.140
I'm very happy with it.

22:16.140 --> 22:24.140
It makes really nice taps.

22:24.140 --> 22:36.140
Do you want to sip out of my cup?

22:36.140 --> 22:44.140
I'll give you a little taste, but only if you behave.

22:44.140 --> 22:46.140
What do I have in my cup?

22:46.140 --> 22:52.140
It's just tea.

22:52.140 --> 23:01.140
It's just green tea in here, but I'm going to make myself a drink in a moment.

23:01.140 --> 23:06.140
I'm going to show you tea.

23:06.140 --> 23:30.140
I'll crouch over you when you can open your mouth.

23:30.140 --> 23:56.140
Okay, if you say shippity toilet, I'm literally going to sick of my mods on you.

23:56.140 --> 24:08.140
I swear to God.

24:08.140 --> 24:12.140
We're not 12, and if you are 12, well, fuck are you here?

24:12.140 --> 24:39.140
Get the fuck out of here, you little bitch.

24:39.140 --> 24:43.140
I hope that you're having a good day today.

24:43.140 --> 24:57.140
Thank you for swiping right on me, on my Tinder profile.

24:57.140 --> 25:03.140
We're going to have this nightcap, and I guess maybe, but just maybe.

25:03.140 --> 25:08.140
Hopefully I can keep my head on my shoulders.

25:08.140 --> 25:17.140
You can come back to my place.

25:17.140 --> 25:40.140
I don't know German, but cool story.

25:40.140 --> 25:50.140
My head was attached in my pictures, but sometimes you kind of get a little crazy with it.

25:50.140 --> 25:53.140
Sometimes it's good to lose your head.

25:53.140 --> 25:55.140
Said it would be an old woman.

25:55.140 --> 25:57.140
His maintenance still there.

25:57.140 --> 26:06.140
Yeah, he's died up in my closet.

26:06.140 --> 26:08.140
Did you hear his screams?

26:08.140 --> 26:12.140
I stuffed my panties in his mouth.

26:36.140 --> 26:51.140
I can make you guys whimper.

26:51.140 --> 27:01.140
Do you want me to make you whimper?

27:01.140 --> 27:03.140
Pop the bag.

27:03.140 --> 27:18.140
Can you bag for a moment?

27:18.140 --> 27:30.140
Are you tingling yet?

27:30.140 --> 27:35.140
Do you want me to make you whimper?

27:35.140 --> 27:43.140
I can give her a really strong drink.

27:43.140 --> 28:12.140
In fact, actually, I need to pour myself a drink before I get to work on you.

28:12.140 --> 28:36.140
I'm a little bad at it.

28:36.140 --> 29:05.140
I'm going to grab some peach tea from the bird.

29:05.140 --> 29:16.140
I don't know why.

29:16.140 --> 29:29.140
I don't want to go in.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.140
I don't want to go in.

29:31.140 --> 30:00.140
I don't want to go in.

30:00.140 --> 30:13.140
So there's three steps I have to take.

30:13.140 --> 30:42.140
First step is pouring the peach tea.

30:42.140 --> 31:11.140
I'm going to pour the peach tea.

31:11.140 --> 31:25.140
I hope your hands are where they should be on your desk.

31:25.140 --> 31:34.140
No, my ass is not as superior as Strone's.

31:34.140 --> 31:54.140
So the second step is to pour the Jack Daniels.

31:54.140 --> 32:11.140
I hope you're being good.

32:11.140 --> 32:38.140
I don't know what happens if you're being bad.

32:38.140 --> 33:07.140
I don't know what happens if you're being bad.

33:08.140 --> 33:33.140
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

33:33.140 --> 33:46.140
I just need to get a new candle burner.

33:46.140 --> 34:07.140
Okay, so I'm going to get them to open up more.

34:07.140 --> 34:36.140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

34:36.140 --> 35:05.140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

35:06.140 --> 35:35.140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

35:35.140 --> 36:04.140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

36:05.140 --> 36:34.140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

36:34.140 --> 37:00.140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

37:00.140 --> 37:27.140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

37:27.140 --> 37:40.140
I wish you could open that candle burner.

37:40.140 --> 37:52.140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

37:52.140 --> 38:15.140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

I don't know why I'm struggling.

03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:39.140
My head disconnected from my body.

03:08:39.140 --> 03:08:49.140
Do you know how long it took me to actually, because like in order to have one of these outfits on, you have to make every layer transparent.

03:08:49.140 --> 03:08:56.140
And I didn't know how many parts of my model that there were that my rigor had to cut up and animate.

03:08:56.140 --> 03:09:06.140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

03:09:06.140 --> 03:09:16.140

I don't know why I'm struggling.

03:09:26.140 --> 03:09:37.140
Yeah, because like, you know, all like all the Shibari ropes on my model, on my body are all individually cut.

03:09:37.140 --> 03:09:44.140
They're all separate pieces along with the rings and the shadows are all separated.

03:09:44.140 --> 03:09:50.140
I was like, and then I understood why Strani paid so much money.

03:09:50.140 --> 03:10:02.140
Like, if you know anything about live 2D and rigging, I personally would look at the file and be like, no.

03:10:02.140 --> 03:10:07.140
It only took me like 20 minutes to make everything transparent, but like so, yeah.

03:10:07.140 --> 03:10:11.140
Shout out to fucking Nari.

03:10:11.140 --> 03:10:16.140
Holy shit. Yeah, Nari's got it.

03:10:16.140 --> 03:10:32.140
Truly, I would love to learn how to rig or make model art a really cool and lucrative skill to have.

03:10:32.140 --> 03:10:52.140
Okay.

03:10:52.140 --> 03:10:58.140
Okay, just come down easy sweetheart.

03:10:58.140 --> 03:11:04.140
I know that was quite a ride.

03:11:04.140 --> 03:11:10.140
Are you okay? Do you need me to get you anything?

03:11:10.140 --> 03:11:16.140
Here, let me help you to the bathroom.

03:11:16.140 --> 03:11:21.140
Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?

03:11:21.140 --> 03:11:29.140
Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?

03:11:29.140 --> 03:11:53.140
Let me just run this nice, warm towel Oreo and wipe everything away from my darling.

03:11:53.140 --> 03:12:00.140
Pissing all about yourself, handsome.

03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:08.140
Oh, you're such a mess.

03:12:08.140 --> 03:12:14.140
Oh, I've utterly destroyed you. I'm so sorry.

03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:19.140
Oh, you would rather stand. I understand.

03:12:19.140 --> 03:12:26.140
It might be hard for you to sit.

03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:42.140
No shame in it.

03:12:42.140 --> 03:12:47.140
There, you're all clean.

03:12:47.140 --> 03:12:58.140
Did you want me to make you a bath instead?

03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:10.140
I don't mind running you a bath.

03:13:10.140 --> 03:13:14.140
You deserve it.

03:13:14.140 --> 03:13:19.140
It worked so hard to clean me.

03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:36.140
You did such a good job.

03:13:36.140 --> 03:13:40.140
I don't know how to make running water noises.

03:13:40.140 --> 03:14:02.140
I can't take my mic over to the sink.

03:14:02.140 --> 03:14:08.140
Hold on, let me put my 3DO back on the stand.

03:14:32.140 --> 03:14:57.140
I don't know.

03:14:57.140 --> 03:15:15.140
Oh, you weren't the good boy. You were the best boy.

03:15:15.140 --> 03:15:28.140
Just relax.

03:15:28.140 --> 03:15:52.140
I'm going to pour some water down your back.

03:15:52.140 --> 03:16:05.140
You have such beautiful hair.

03:16:05.140 --> 03:16:15.140
You know, you also smell so good.

03:16:15.140 --> 03:16:22.140
You smell like the aftermath of us.

03:16:22.140 --> 03:16:50.140
You smell like the way it smells.

03:16:50.140 --> 03:17:05.140
You don't even have enough water to tell you how wonderful you are.

03:17:20.140 --> 03:17:33.140
You brought me so much pleasure.

03:17:33.140 --> 03:17:43.140
You made me so happy.

03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:51.140
I love you so much.

03:17:51.140 --> 03:18:05.140
You always want what's best for me.

03:18:05.140 --> 03:18:27.140
So let me take care of you right now.

03:18:27.140 --> 03:18:52.140
Let me rinse your hair out my love.

03:18:52.140 --> 03:18:59.140
I'm sorry, I don't have that much.

03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:11.140
My supplement is just a little chat.

03:19:11.140 --> 03:19:19.140
I'm close to being under 3K.

03:19:19.140 --> 03:19:46.140
Hopefully after a week I know why I feel like we would have been past 5K by now.

03:19:46.140 --> 03:19:53.140
But anyways, let me focus on you. You're all that matters to me right now.

03:19:53.140 --> 03:20:04.140
I want to make sure that you feel safe and loved.

03:20:04.140 --> 03:20:14.140
I have to make sure that I don't break too much.

03:20:34.140 --> 03:20:51.140
You took it so well. You didn't break under the pressure. I'm so impressed with you.

03:20:51.140 --> 03:20:59.140
I think you deserve a present.

03:21:21.140 --> 03:21:43.140
You deserve the world, you know that right?

03:21:43.140 --> 03:22:12.140
I think that means you need to be reminded more often that you are loved, that you are worth it.

03:22:12.140 --> 03:22:21.140
That you're someone always there when you offer you love.

03:22:21.140 --> 03:22:32.140
And that's me, because you're mine. You don't ever stop being mine.

03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:45.140
You work so hard to please everybody, but you need to please yourself.

03:22:45.140 --> 03:23:00.140
I want you to do something for yourself, because you deserve it.

03:23:00.140 --> 03:23:17.140
You deserve happiness.

03:23:17.140 --> 03:23:29.140
And I know the part of you, the part of you, takes the pain because I think that you're worth it.

03:23:29.140 --> 03:23:38.140
You're loved. You mean so much to me.

03:23:38.140 --> 03:23:58.140
I never feel like you have to punish yourself, all I do for pleasure.

03:23:58.140 --> 03:24:05.140
Do you want me to tell you what I like about you?

03:24:05.140 --> 03:24:23.140
I might never stop talking if I do.

03:24:23.140 --> 03:24:29.140
I like how dedicated you are.

03:24:29.140 --> 03:24:35.140
I love how warm you are.

03:24:35.140 --> 03:24:47.140
You're so smart and intelligent and I can talk to you for hours.

03:24:47.140 --> 03:25:04.140
You're welcome for my talk act.

03:25:04.140 --> 03:25:17.140
I can't get my hands off of you.

03:25:17.140 --> 03:25:30.140
Yes, you are so obedient. Another, you know, desired trait.

03:25:30.140 --> 03:25:35.140
You need to cry then cry.

03:25:35.140 --> 03:25:44.140
Let it out. It's not good to keep those things locked inside you.

03:25:44.140 --> 03:25:54.140
Here, why don't you lay on my chest and just relax my thigh.

03:26:14.140 --> 03:26:37.140
It's okay. Let it out.

03:26:44.140 --> 03:27:06.140
Let it out.

03:27:06.140 --> 03:27:13.140
I hope you realize how tough you are.

03:27:13.140 --> 03:27:18.140
You can't do so much.

03:27:18.140 --> 03:27:28.140
No matter how many times the world tries to break you.

03:27:28.140 --> 03:27:31.140
You're still standing.

03:27:31.140 --> 03:27:49.140
You're not going to ever forget that.

03:27:49.140 --> 03:28:02.140
Do you want me to watch you?

03:28:02.140 --> 03:28:04.140
Do I have you?

03:28:04.140 --> 03:28:08.140
Yes, and I still have you.

03:28:08.140 --> 03:28:17.140
No matter how strong you are.

03:28:17.140 --> 03:28:26.140
Even though the world might seem harsh,

03:28:26.140 --> 03:28:38.140
you can still find your way.

03:28:38.140 --> 03:28:48.140
Always look like you're in somebody's happiness.

03:28:48.140 --> 03:28:57.140
You can go and do anything you want to.

03:28:57.140 --> 03:29:10.140
You can do anything you want to.

03:29:10.140 --> 03:29:18.140
You may not think it. You may not have the confidence.

03:29:18.140 --> 03:29:29.140
But that's the one thing I found out about that confidence in you.

03:29:29.140 --> 03:29:36.140
You have accomplished so much.

03:29:36.140 --> 03:29:45.140
What I want you to do when you go home after spending time with me.

03:29:45.140 --> 03:29:53.140
I want you to look at the mirror and look at yourself.

03:29:53.140 --> 03:30:03.140
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.

03:30:03.140 --> 03:30:14.140
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.

03:30:14.140 --> 03:30:29.140
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.

03:30:29.140 --> 03:30:31.140
You're welcome.

03:30:31.140 --> 03:30:36.140
I know what you're doing.

03:30:36.140 --> 03:30:39.140
I'm glad that you thought you'd do that.

03:30:39.140 --> 03:30:48.140
A lot of the things that bother us the most are like what you think you are.

03:30:48.140 --> 03:30:55.140
I wish you had been strong and you didn't do so well.

03:30:55.140 --> 03:31:03.140
You want me to come in five good things about you?

03:31:03.140 --> 03:31:07.140
Hard work there.

03:31:07.140 --> 03:31:12.140
You get up early morning and you take home the thing you might not want to be.

03:31:12.140 --> 03:31:18.140
Some people might be simple by getting out of bed is a hard part.

03:31:18.140 --> 03:31:23.140
You did it?

03:31:23.140 --> 03:31:28.140
You probably, you know, had a choice in it.

03:31:28.140 --> 03:31:31.140
You don't really do the time.

03:31:31.140 --> 03:31:35.140
You probably completed the time.

03:31:35.140 --> 03:31:39.140
You did the most simple as time and got through it.

03:31:39.140 --> 03:31:41.140
Just don't take care of it.

03:31:41.140 --> 03:31:53.140
You're also so very loving.

03:31:53.140 --> 03:31:56.140
This is stuff like that.

03:31:56.140 --> 03:32:05.140
I don't think I've experienced the type of love you've shown me before.

03:32:05.140 --> 03:32:10.140
So intense.

03:32:10.140 --> 03:32:22.140
So powerful.

03:32:22.140 --> 03:32:28.140
So much love to you.

03:32:28.140 --> 03:32:30.140
There's so much love to you.

03:32:30.140 --> 03:32:34.140
So why don't you give it to yourself?

03:32:34.140 --> 03:32:54.140
Shhh.

03:32:54.140 --> 03:32:57.140
That's so good.

03:32:57.140 --> 03:33:05.140
Just like that.

03:33:05.140 --> 03:33:22.140
Just like that.

03:33:22.140 --> 03:33:31.140
Just like that.

03:33:31.140 --> 03:33:35.140
Think about other things too.

03:33:35.140 --> 03:33:51.140
You don't know me at all.

03:33:51.140 --> 03:33:55.140
It's going to be my fault.

03:33:55.140 --> 03:33:58.140
Your safety.

03:33:58.140 --> 03:34:02.140
And my love.

03:34:02.140 --> 03:34:12.140
Even if it's just for tonight.

03:34:51.140 --> 03:35:17.140
Don't cry.

03:35:17.140 --> 03:35:19.140
Oh my sweet, don't cry.

03:35:19.140 --> 03:35:21.140
Oh my floating fucking head.

03:35:21.140 --> 03:35:23.140
Laugh, laugh at my floating head.

03:35:23.140 --> 03:35:25.140
Do it now.

03:35:25.140 --> 03:35:28.140
Laugh away.

03:35:28.140 --> 03:35:34.140
I want you to be happy.

03:35:34.140 --> 03:35:38.140
Wow.

03:35:38.140 --> 03:35:45.140
My child.

03:35:45.140 --> 03:35:47.140
Yeah, I can do aftercare too.

03:35:47.140 --> 03:35:49.140
I'll insult you.

03:35:49.140 --> 03:35:51.140
You won't take care of you.

03:35:51.140 --> 03:35:54.140
Oh, please don't.

03:35:54.140 --> 03:36:01.140
I'm a very empathetic person.

03:36:01.140 --> 03:36:06.140
So I get it.

03:36:06.140 --> 03:36:08.140
I can be soft dumb.

03:36:08.140 --> 03:36:10.140
I can be hard dumb.

03:36:10.140 --> 03:36:13.140
I can be a goofy dumb.

03:36:13.140 --> 03:36:20.140
Which is mostly what I am.

03:36:20.140 --> 03:36:23.140
Look at when I go to the side.

03:36:23.140 --> 03:36:25.140
I was not doing it.

03:36:25.140 --> 03:36:28.140
It was like these crazy stuff that was funny.

03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:33.140
Happy hair end.

03:36:33.140 --> 03:36:36.140
Okay, let's go to my bedroom.

time and oh yeah what was there I did a voice for a Zura oh speaking of what so

03:53:57.680 --> 03:54:04.360
you know that clip from Emmys stream that she used of me like what about your cock

03:54:04.360 --> 03:54:12.200
like oh my god my voice is cracked because I've been doing a lot of voices so that

03:54:12.200 --> 03:54:22.720
was from I was testing my microphone for recordings I think for the game because

03:54:22.880 --> 03:54:28.520
I didn't use the we didn't use the 3D os to record the game lines and so I was

03:54:28.520 --> 03:54:33.160
just like fucking around and I was just like what about your cock yeah and I

03:54:33.160 --> 03:54:37.760
would like go high and like do so she cut specifically those lines and use

03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:43.240
because I would I would just say normal lines like oh we got to go fight these

03:54:43.240 --> 03:54:48.520
monsters blah blah blah blah blah and then and then but then I would like

03:54:48.560 --> 03:54:53.600
usually when I sent my line because I would send my lines to the group chat so

03:54:53.600 --> 03:54:57.040
they could like so I could be like oh what do you guys think and then I would

03:54:57.040 --> 03:55:02.280
usually throw in something funny at the end like for one of them oh my god I'll

03:55:02.280 --> 03:55:09.720
just play one for you hold on let me find it because a Zura was said I sounded

03:55:09.720 --> 03:55:18.800
like a lead character and so I recorded a league lead character lines for her

03:55:20.960 --> 03:55:29.960
there is it well me what are you doing oh yeah I saw she said I sounded like

03:55:29.960 --> 03:55:36.520
Timo so I recorded Timo lines for her and she was geeking out

03:55:36.840 --> 03:55:42.840
tell them I turn this off real brief like

03:55:45.720 --> 03:55:54.160
size doesn't mean everything never underestimate the power of the scouts

03:55:54.160 --> 03:56:00.920
code swiftly I didn't even know the voice that I can do sounds like Timo

03:56:00.920 --> 03:56:15.640
cuz I don't play league ow I just hit my arm so it was like really funny and I

03:56:15.640 --> 03:56:26.560
let me see if I can find the one I set let me find the one that I am that that

03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:38.480
came from let me see this one that's not it wait was it cuz yeah it was the it

03:56:38.480 --> 03:56:45.400
was also like the trailer lines that we were working on for the for the for the

03:56:45.400 --> 03:56:52.920
trailer that was a mutual no no it's not really

03:56:52.920 --> 03:57:03.680
peachy no I don't think that sounds really peachy at all that was almost my

03:57:03.680 --> 03:57:14.960
line for the trailer hard hard because the editor kept sending like for the

03:57:14.960 --> 03:57:22.520
video first like when they sent in the lines my mic would always peak for the

03:57:22.520 --> 03:57:26.880
work hard so that's why I didn't make it into the trailer cuz I'm like hard and

03:57:26.880 --> 03:57:31.680
it just sounded like shit but first but when I play it back it sounds normal so

03:57:31.680 --> 03:57:43.120
I'm like huh brother and they're editing that's fucking up my audio because I
