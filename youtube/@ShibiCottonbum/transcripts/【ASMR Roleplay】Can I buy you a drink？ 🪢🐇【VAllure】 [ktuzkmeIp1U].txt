So just give me a moment. I
Apologize I literally have been ready for over an hour

So

Kind of frustrated
Scarlet
I have to get like really in there, don't I?
Okay.
Hello, darlings.
Headphones are maxed.
Anyone as you go says you can't do me.
Okay.
Listen, I'm doing the post down here.
A little different because if you have a certain type of headphones, it may not work.
Alright, I'm on my keyboard.
I'm picking up the 3DO.
Okay.
I don't really care because I think this would be really funny.
It was really fun messing around with the settings on the VTube studio.
My neighbors are walking by and they're being very loud.
Good luck on your exam.
Alright, so I thank you.
Thank you for meeting me at the bar.
I'm happy that you followed directions in my Tinder message that I sent to you.
Because I sent you directions to this bar, don't worry that there's nobody else here.
I especially reserved it for the both of us.
I hope you don't mind what I don't know what a big bumping up is.
I generally don't know why it's doing that.
It's a big bar, but don't worry about anyone else.
It's just me and you.
I'm not rich.
Why do you think I'm bartending behind this bar right now?
I'm sorry I had to burp, but I didn't want to burp in your ear.
Unless you want me to.
But I'll be a professional madam for you tonight.
So my darling, what would you like to drink?
I can make you something.
If you're under the age of drinking, I can also make you a mocktail if you'd like.
I've been studying.
I'm going to forgive you a little bit.
I don't know, Mike.
You want chalky milk?
I can make you chalky milk.
I almost went out and bought Vanta because I realized I had an advantage in a decade.
Madam, your neck, don't worry about my neck.
I still got that, though.
And don't you forget it.
So you'd like some cold water.
You'd like dark coke, bloody Mary, strawberry milk.
So no head.
You'd like a bloody Mary, non-alcoholic.
Okay.
I have some lemonade and I have strawberry milk.
Get out of here.
I love oil.
What is wrong with you people?
Coke milk?
Yes.
I am milking.
Is there a buyer in the bar?
A shipping aid?
Yes, that can be arranged.
A bucket of soda.
Got some bleach.
Yeah, I got some bleach.
I also have some ammonia as well.
But yeah, don't worry that there's nobody else here.
It's just me and you tonight.
Okay, I'm going to take very good, very good care of you.
All right, let me get some ice.
All right, let me get some ice.
Let's come right here.
All right, go.
I have some ice.
I have no idea.
I had to go to the back.
I had to step away for a moment.
In fact, I have to, hold on.
I have to step away.
I have to step away to do it.
Let me just, I can't part.
I'm trying really hard and I can't.
Because I know the microphone.
I'll pick it up.
But I also have some ice.
I have a nice setup.
Not long.
I am.
You know, I worked really hard.
I don't, hold on.
I'm like very tall.
Let me just, sorry.
Do you know how to share it?
Don't worry.
I run very fine establishments.
This is a bar within Wonderland Hotel.
So, one long island ice tea.
All right.
Coming right up, you know.
No one would want to like about ice though.
I like about ice.
Wow, that was like really, my teeth are sensitive.
I just, I live, I live dangerously.
I live very dangerously.
I can't go over like this or that.
We can ask for crushed ice, oh well.
That's the only type of ice we serve.
Hold on, let me crush it again for you.
There, I spit it right into the glass for you.
So, take a sip of that.
What do you mean?
You don't, you need a drink to go with it.
Okay, let me, let me pour you something then, hold on.
Okay.
My favorite ambiance is here.
It's my, it's my, my AC has made its arrival.
I'm so happy I put a towel down because it just smells drinkable.
Is it monster?
No, it's not do.
Because, you know, I got some out due because I'm going to mount it to you later.
So it's only fair.
The candle, oh god.
All right, here, let me come out from behind the bar.
Yeah, I teleported, whatever.
So, uh, the effects are really nice.
So, do you like my outfit?
Only, you know, a torso.
But do you like it?
Uh, don't mind that.
I'm not attached to my back.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry.
I was like, so ready to be so serious.
And then I was messing around with all this stuff this morning.
And I couldn't stop laughing.
I don't know why my fingers break.
There we go.
Does that work for you?
Do not be afraid.
You are safe with me, my dear.
My cat is climbing on my monitor.
Hold on.
My love, my god, please get down.
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
She's like, was that only climbing over everything?
You guys like me, like, is this okay with you?
Like, what sucks is that when I turn to the side, it just disconnects.
Don't use it.
Okay.
I got a new cup, and it's like textured.
I'm very happy with it.
It makes really nice taps.
Do you want to sip out of my cup?
I'll give you a little taste, but only if you behave.
What do I have in my cup?
It's just tea.
It's just green tea in here, but I'm going to make myself a drink in a moment.
I'm going to show you tea.
I'll crouch over you when you can open your mouth.
Okay, if you say shippity toilet, I'm literally going to sick of my mods on you.
I swear to God.
We're not 12, and if you are 12, well, fuck are you here?
Get the fuck out of here, you little bitch.
I hope that you're having a good day today.
Thank you for swiping right on me, on my Tinder profile.
We're going to have this nightcap, and I guess maybe, but just maybe.
Hopefully I can keep my head on my shoulders.
You can come back to my place.
I don't know German, but cool story.
My head was attached in my pictures, but sometimes you kind of get a little crazy with it.
Sometimes it's good to lose your head.
Said it would be an old woman.
His maintenance still there.
Yeah, he's died up in my closet.
Did you hear his screams?
I stuffed my panties in his mouth.
I can make you guys whimper.
Do you want me to make you whimper?
Pop the bag.
Can you bag for a moment?
Are you tingling yet?
Do you want me to make you whimper?
I can give her a really strong drink.
In fact, actually, I need to pour myself a drink before I get to work on you.
I'm a little bad at it.
I'm going to grab some peach tea from the bird.
I don't know why.
I don't want to go in.
I don't want to go in.
I don't want to go in.
So there's three steps I have to take.
First step is pouring the peach tea.
I'm going to pour the peach tea.
I hope your hands are where they should be on your desk.
No, my ass is not as superior as Strone's.
So the second step is to pour the Jack Daniels.
I hope you're being good.
I don't know what happens if you're being bad.
I don't know what happens if you're being bad.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I just need to get a new candle burner.
Okay, so I'm going to get them to open up more.
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

My head disconnected from my body.
Do you know how long it took me to actually, because like in order to have one of these outfits on, you have to make every layer transparent.
And I didn't know how many parts of my model that there were that my rigor had to cut up and animate.
I don't know why I'm struggling.
I don't know why I'm struggling.
I don't know why I'm struggling.
Yeah, because like, you know, all like all the Shibari ropes on my model, on my body are all individually cut.
They're all separate pieces along with the rings and the shadows are all separated.
I was like, and then I understood why Strani paid so much money.
Like, if you know anything about live 2D and rigging, I personally would look at the file and be like, no.
It only took me like 20 minutes to make everything transparent, but like so, yeah.
Shout out to fucking Nari.
Holy shit. Yeah, Nari's got it.
Truly, I would love to learn how to rig or make model art a really cool and lucrative skill to have.
Okay.
Okay, just come down easy sweetheart.
I know that was quite a ride.
Are you okay? Do you need me to get you anything?
Here, let me help you to the bathroom.
Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?
Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?
Let me just run this nice, warm towel Oreo and wipe everything away from my darling.
Pissing all about yourself, handsome.
Oh, you're such a mess.
Oh, I've utterly destroyed you. I'm so sorry.
Oh, you would rather stand. I understand.
It might be hard for you to sit.
No shame in it.
There, you're all clean.
Did you want me to make you a bath instead?
I don't mind running you a bath.
You deserve it.
It worked so hard to clean me.
You did such a good job.
I don't know how to make running water noises.
I can't take my mic over to the sink.
Hold on, let me put my 3DO back on the stand.
I don't know.
Oh, you weren't the good boy. You were the best boy.
Just relax.
I'm going to pour some water down your back.
You have such beautiful hair.
You know, you also smell so good.
You smell like the aftermath of us.
You smell like the way it smells.
You don't even have enough water to tell you how wonderful you are.
You brought me so much pleasure.
You made me so happy.
I love you so much.
You always want what's best for me.
So let me take care of you right now.
Let me rinse your hair out my love.
I'm sorry, I don't have that much.
My supplement is just a little chat.
I'm close to being under 3K.
Hopefully after a week I know why I feel like we would have been past 5K by now.
But anyways, let me focus on you. You're all that matters to me right now.
I want to make sure that you feel safe and loved.
I have to make sure that I don't break too much.
You took it so well. You didn't break under the pressure. I'm so impressed with you.
I think you deserve a present.
You deserve the world, you know that right?
I think that means you need to be reminded more often that you are loved, that you are worth it.
That you're someone always there when you offer you love.
And that's me, because you're mine. You don't ever stop being mine.
You work so hard to please everybody, but you need to please yourself.
I want you to do something for yourself, because you deserve it.
You deserve happiness.
And I know the part of you, the part of you, takes the pain because I think that you're worth it.
You're loved. You mean so much to me.
I never feel like you have to punish yourself, all I do for pleasure.
Do you want me to tell you what I like about you?
I might never stop talking if I do.
I like how dedicated you are.
I love how warm you are.
You're so smart and intelligent and I can talk to you for hours.
You're welcome for my talk act.
I can't get my hands off of you.
Yes, you are so obedient. Another, you know, desired trait.
You need to cry then cry.
Let it out. It's not good to keep those things locked inside you.
Here, why don't you lay on my chest and just relax my thigh.
It's okay. Let it out.
Let it out.
I hope you realize how tough you are.
You can't do so much.
No matter how many times the world tries to break you.
You're still standing.
You're not going to ever forget that.
Do you want me to watch you?
Do I have you?
Yes, and I still have you.
No matter how strong you are.
Even though the world might seem harsh,
you can still find your way.
Always look like you're in somebody's happiness.
You can go and do anything you want to.
You can do anything you want to.
You may not think it. You may not have the confidence.
But that's the one thing I found out about that confidence in you.
You have accomplished so much.
What I want you to do when you go home after spending time with me.
I want you to look at the mirror and look at yourself.
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.
You're welcome.
I know what you're doing.
I'm glad that you thought you'd do that.
A lot of the things that bother us the most are like what you think you are.
I wish you had been strong and you didn't do so well.
You want me to come in five good things about you?
Hard work there.
You get up early morning and you take home the thing you might not want to be.
Some people might be simple by getting out of bed is a hard part.
You did it?
You probably, you know, had a choice in it.
You don't really do the time.
You probably completed the time.
You did the most simple as time and got through it.
Just don't take care of it.
You're also so very loving.
This is stuff like that.
I don't think I've experienced the type of love you've shown me before.
So intense.
So powerful.
So much love to you.
There's so much love to you.
So why don't you give it to yourself?
Shhh.
That's so good.
Just like that.
Just like that.
Just like that.
Think about other things too.
You don't know me at all.
It's going to be my fault.
Your safety.
And my love.
Even if it's just for tonight.
Don't cry.
Oh my sweet, don't cry.
Oh my floating fucking head.
Laugh, laugh at my floating head.
Do it now.
Laugh away.
I want you to be happy.
Wow.
My child.
Yeah, I can do aftercare too.
I'll insult you.
You won't take care of you.
Oh, please don't.
I'm a very empathetic person.
So I get it.
I can be soft dumb.
I can be hard dumb.
I can be a goofy dumb.
Which is mostly what I am.
Look at when I go to the side.
I was not doing it.
It was like these crazy stuff that was funny.
Happy hair end.

you know that clip from Emmys stream that she used of me like what about your cock
like oh my god my voice is cracked because I've been doing a lot of voices so that
was from I was testing my microphone for recordings I think for the game because
I didn't use the we didn't use the 3D os to record the game lines and so I was
just like fucking around and I was just like what about your cock yeah and I
would like go high and like do so she cut specifically those lines and use
because I would I would just say normal lines like oh we got to go fight these
monsters blah blah blah blah blah and then and then but then I would like
usually when I sent my line because I would send my lines to the group chat so
they could like so I could be like oh what do you guys think and then I would
usually throw in something funny at the end like for one of them oh my god I'll
just play one for you hold on let me find it because a Zura was said I sounded
like a lead character and so I recorded a league lead character lines for her
there is it well me what are you doing oh yeah I saw she said I sounded like
Timo so I recorded Timo lines for her and she was geeking out
tell them I turn this off real brief like
size doesn't mean everything never underestimate the power of the scouts
code swiftly I didn't even know the voice that I can do sounds like Timo
cuz I don't play league ow I just hit my arm so it was like really funny and I
let me see if I can find the one I set let me find the one that I am that that
came from let me see this one that's not it wait was it cuz yeah it was the it
was also like the trailer lines that we were working on for the for the for the
trailer that was a mutual no no it's not really
peachy no I don't think that sounds really peachy at all that was almost my
line for the trailer hard hard because the editor kept sending like for the
video first like when they sent in the lines my mic would always peak for the
work hard so that's why I didn't make it into the trailer cuz I'm like hard and
it just sounded like shit but first but when I play it back it sounds normal so
I'm like huh brother and they're editing that's fucking up my audio because I
really like to work hard play harder I want to hear boomy I have I have some
bloopers from me do recording some naughty stuff I'll play them for you
you can hear him go in the background that was actually yeah I was behind the
scenes for the the thing that was released can I do stitch I'd have to
listen to stitch voice I'm trying to find specifically the one that Amy used
where is it well this one's called giggles nefariously I just label stuff
random oh strongy asked me this she's like can you send me some of your giggles

bread Gregory you guys can't hear stuff can you do it evil lioness from the
lion king ever got her name like Shiva something

drawing of me of course you can I love fan art Zira I haven't heard Zira's
voice in a very long time I would have to listen to that do-do-do I'm like so
determined to find this

like oh wow yeah reina likes to sing the song of her people very often especially
she'll like just go into my closet and just scream for some reason I don't know
why she does that
no that's not the one I
damn it I had a muted so you guys didn't even hear what I was playing
hold on I'm being a goofball you hear the bloopers
I did it twice on accident
accidentally deleted some
you wrote maybe I need my special playtime I'll get you to fuck me with my
toys huh giggles I have a couple I have a couple bloopers and then like I would
just like mess up a line or again like so scrawny has written some of the
scripts that I read for patreon and she is bad at typing English I would have
in the sweetest I love her to death but in the sweetest way possible sometimes
unlike she this is a Scottish ism that she's put into the script but yeah it's
a little it's a little bit of behind the scenes for you I can't find the clip
that Emmy used but it was it was pretty funny I think it was another trailer
like me taking things for trailers
get the game out of here the Scots the Scots hi you're bloody we do in there

much longer thank you for the raid in me was the hello I we ended the ASMR cuz I

stuck with me you're even strong oh you know I could actually just pass you guys
off to straw me you missed it yes I'm sorry you did and the Vaude might be
nuked because although I know somebody probably archived it but there was some
very sassy things that were going on oopsies and that wasn't even me with my
full power let's just say I did way worse than what you did in me the archive I
don't think will appear anywhere until I end stream as we if strong is still

fall down some stairs at one point that was pretty funny that was quite funny
