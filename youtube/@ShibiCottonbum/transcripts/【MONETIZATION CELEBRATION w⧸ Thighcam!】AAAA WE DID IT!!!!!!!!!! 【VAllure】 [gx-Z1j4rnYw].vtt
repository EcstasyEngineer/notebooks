I need to sneeze.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.600
Oh, that felt funny.

05:13.600 --> 05:21.600
I'm also, you know, I'm, let me just, I'm wearing my lovely necklace.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.600
Thank you. I'm gonna be sneezing a lot because I've had allergies all day.

05:25.600 --> 05:31.600
I'll only pull my shorts down a little bit, so it's obvious I'm wearing pants.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.600
Yes, I'm wearing a Doctor Strange shirt that looks like a tarot card.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.600
Some of you also may know that I'm a Marvel nerd.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.600
And I'm wearing a hoodie because I got really cold.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.600
Thank you. I don't have my headphones on.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.600
And I, hold on. I'm a mess. I'm literally such a...

05:53.600 --> 05:59.600
I'm like so overwhelmed right now.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.600
Bless you. Thank you.

06:03.600 --> 06:09.600
Thank you Namesword for the 50. Jesus Christ.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.600
Okay, I might also just save tips till the end as well.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.600
So we're gonna do that. I'm gonna save tips for the end as well.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.600
How's the party? It was good.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.600
I came to bargain.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.600
So my friend Olive, I've talked about before, she is leaving the job that we work at.

06:30.600 --> 06:37.600
So she had a bunch of like our coworkers and people that used to work at the place we work at.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.600
Over and we had a little barbecue.

06:40.600 --> 06:46.600
I might have had a Margar too, you know, got a spoil myself.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.600
And though I realized I shouldn't have really done that because

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
I regretting it today.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.600
I'm like, I'm only a lightweight because of the medication I'm on.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.600
Because I'm on like several different medications for pain management.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.600
And also mentally with no way.

07:02.600 --> 07:07.600
And I need to make sure like...

07:07.600 --> 07:11.600
So I had like one and then I had like...

07:11.600 --> 07:13.600
Actually, did I have one or two?

07:13.600 --> 07:17.600
I think I only had like one and I took a sip of another but I never finished it.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.600
But yeah, I get I'm a major lightweight.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
I also just don't like to drink alcohol a lot.

07:22.600 --> 07:28.600
I literally have only done it for stream and then rarely when I usually I'll just like...

07:28.600 --> 07:31.600
I was drinking ginger ale after that chilling.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.600
Also don't be surprised what that's normal.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.600
I'm so overwhelmed right now.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
And that's why I'm like I'm being very got mo because I'm just like...

07:43.600 --> 07:46.600
I'm also very self conscious.

07:47.600 --> 07:52.600
I'm very appreciative of S.R.I.S.M.C. The Night Out.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.600
I'm usually...

07:56.600 --> 08:01.600
I'm against showing skin but because this is a special occasion.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.600
I'll probably only ever do handcams.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.600
You probably won't see my thighs for a while.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.600
Unless I have like a cat cam on.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.600
And then I'm the camera might get like knocked over by like Bumi or Fia.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.600
Bumi is actually by my feet right now.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.600
But yeah, I'm happy you guys enjoyed those.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.600
Hopefully I don't delete him later out of...

08:29.600 --> 08:34.600
I can't talk because I'm very stuffed stuffy.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.600
Ooh, these are like this is like a bird treat.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.600
But okay, we're going to go through these snacks.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.600
And I'm going to determine what I like and I don't like.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.600
YouTube might delete it.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.600
I definitely have my...

08:56.600 --> 08:59.600
I was debating whether or not for like certain doughnose.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.600
I like, you know, beat your ass or something.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.600
But who knows?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
Rare thighs, yes, they're very rare.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.600
Because like I'm someone like a VTuber is a VTuber.

09:11.600 --> 09:17.600
Like I don't like breaking immersion unless it's for a special occasion.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.600
And you know, today's a special occasion is Bumi name.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.600
Yes, Bumi is Bumi King of Amashu.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.600
But thank you guys so much for remembering already.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
I'm very overwhelmed with like how many members.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
Feed us please.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
Yes, I'll feed you.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
Yeah, I can understand I wanted to do also.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
Yeah, yeah, like I used to be a flash streamer.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.600
But like I just...

09:41.600 --> 09:46.600
I didn't do stuff like this when I was like it wasn't did not do stuff like this.

09:46.600 --> 09:53.600
I was a very say so person when I flash streamed honestly.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.600
Minus like being toxic in like counter strike.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
I don't know.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
Thank you for the number.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.600
But I didn't think I would get monetized.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.600
And honestly my heart goes out to Azura who is also being hated on by YouTube.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.600
I get limited ads on everything and then I get adult restrictions.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
I'm definitely going to change.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.600
I'm actually going to probably do that right now.

10:18.600 --> 10:24.600
I'm going to just edit my thumbnail to something else.

10:24.600 --> 10:36.600
I'm going to take my greasy little toes out of there.

10:36.600 --> 10:42.600
Yeah, I know Azura they need to cut Azura break.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.600
It's it was pissing me off.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.600
Like how I'm like I'm like cut off my tits.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
Just do it.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.600
Just do it.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.600
I just cut off our tits just so we can get monetization.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.600
I'll just do feet.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
Feet in the thumbnail.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.600
Forget boobs in the thumbnail.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.600
Feet in the thumbnail.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.600
I'm trying to look for a good pair of feet to smack on this.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.600
I took like several feet pictures.

11:18.600 --> 11:23.600
I'll do high feet and feet in high heels.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.600
Oh, where'd it go?

11:25.600 --> 11:29.600

11:29.600 --> 11:39.600
I was I'm wishing I left because manage it was just like do you want me to send over to the graphic artists like like do you want me to have them make you thumbnail.

11:39.600 --> 11:47.600
I'm like no no I got it because I'm like I'm not going to send my feet pics to the graphic artists and be like hey can you like slam this in here.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.600
I'm pretty sure Emmie also like edited her own.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.600
Feet in high.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.600
Oh perfect.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600

12:12.600 --> 12:16.600
Okay, let me just change the thumbnail.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.600

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
You want me to put doctor straight?

12:21.600 --> 12:22.600

12:22.600 --> 12:27.600
Like Marvel will come out of nowhere and just like attack me.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.600
Perfect.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.600
Oh, you know, I should have probably covered my boobies as well.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
Whatever.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.600
I'll do that later.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.600
It's not the point.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.600
It's not why we're here today.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
You know, we're here.

12:43.600 --> 12:52.600
We're gathered together today to celebrate monetization of this channel.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
I can't get back to my chat with them.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
I can't see what you guys are saying.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
There we go.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.600

13:13.600 --> 13:15.600
Okay, so let me open this up.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.600
This one's different from the other one I just had.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.600
You're too weak.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.600
Oppa!

13:35.600 --> 13:37.600
This one is strawberry flavored.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
Ooh, that's good.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.600
With my palm.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
I always do it with my thumbs.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.600
I don't know.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.600
These are calling my name, so I want to eat them.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
Okay, so this.

You can see it right here.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.600
But I'm gonna have one of each.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.600
Okay, that's a peanut.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.600
It's pretty good.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.600
I need like a pile of good and bad.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.600
Everything good is gonna be on gushin.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.600
I love like Japanese savory snacks.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.600
In fact, I might like separate them.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.600

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
Wait, is Mercy here?

16:22.600 --> 16:24.600
I can't see.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.600
If Mercy's here, thank you!

16:26.600 --> 16:28.600
Jeez.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.600
Dude, what?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.600
Another 50.

16:34.600 --> 16:40.600
I guess you shall have some toes for that.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.600
There's the covered in cat hair, don't worry about it.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.600
Okay, let's try this.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.600
Jesus, congrats. I love you, Mercy.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.600
Thank you.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.600
Shnifa, shnifa.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.600
Okay.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.600
This is kaiofumi.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.600
Translating to flavor Kyoto.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.600
These uniquely Japanese snacks have been around for over 200 years.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.600
Created with high quality millet and rice.

17:10.600 --> 17:14.600
Okoshi are an okasa specialty known as luck bringing the sweet.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.600
Wait, that's a sweet?

17:18.600 --> 17:20.600
Sometimes the packaging is different.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.600
You get free.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.600
Maybe, I don't know. Maybe if I'm feeling nice.

17:34.600 --> 17:41.600
It sucks cause like I'm still a little bit like nauseous and queasy from like three days ago.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.600
This is like bird food.

18:03.600 --> 18:10.600
There's a flavor in this but I can't place in it but I don't like it.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.600
Like it's not bad but it's like it's not good.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.600
I'm gonna put this off to the side.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.600
It does not taste like a rice krispie treat.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
Oh my god, my cats are like running around.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
What is this?

18:23.600 --> 18:26.600
I'm trying to find the savory stuff first.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.600
Ooh, these are tasty.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
It's amazing.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.600
My like microphone might sound a little bit bad because it's like behind me.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.600
Cause like I have an L shaped desk and like this is, you can't see.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.600
Over there is where my microphone is.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.600
It's like over my shoulder.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.600
It looks good but it didn't taste that good.

18:53.600 --> 19:00.600
These are Happy Turn, a pack of mini soft rice crackers with a sweet and sour seasoning for deliciousness that does not stop.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.600
Deliciousness that does not stop.

19:05.600 --> 19:10.600
L shaped butt.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.600
That's why I have scissors.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.600
Shiba mouse, like mouse pad.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.600
Ooh, these smell weird.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.600
Welcome to my channel.

19:32.600 --> 19:36.600
Today we're going to be trying this new makeup product.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.600
This isn't bad. I like these.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.600
They're not sweet and sour though. They're just sweet.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.600
These look like Doritos.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.600
I feel like I dropped one.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.600
I guess not.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
I can't open this.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.600
Ooh, little baby Doritos.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.600
Wait.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.600
What are these?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.600
What are these? What are these? What are these?

20:37.600 --> 20:39.600
What the fuck are they?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.600
These are triangle crackers.

20:42.600 --> 20:48.600
Cute triangle shaped bite sized crackers with a salty nori seaweed flavor. Wow.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.600
What are those? They're pretty good though.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.600
I'm going to...

21:06.600 --> 21:08.600
They don't taste like seaweed.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
They don't taste like seaweed though.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
I like them.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.600
I already know. This is my favorite Japanese snack.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.600
I'm going to take one bite, but I'm going to destroy this after stream.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
I'm telling you that right now.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.600
Happy Sunday. Happy Sunday.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.600
I know it's Father's Day.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.600
Shout out to my dad. That's a Chad.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.600
Hold on. What is this called again? I forget.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
Those are the giant.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.600
Yes, they're so good. High Serenity. They're so fucking good.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.600
Big pippe.

22:00.600 --> 22:04.600
This is Omibode. This is sticks. Crispy hollow tube corn puff sticks.

22:04.600 --> 22:09.600
This one. I don't know what flavor it is, but I'm just going to eat it.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.600
Oh.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.600
This is so good.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.600
Thank you Serenity.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.600
Speaking of which, my parent.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
That goes in the tasty pile.

22:38.600 --> 22:42.600
You guys know that my dad wasn't feeling so good the other day.

22:44.600 --> 22:49.600
You guys were very nice enough and you guys donated around $200 to my parents.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.600
Just to be like, hey, I hope their parents are okay.

22:52.600 --> 22:58.600
I decided I'm not going to take that because I just told you a story about my dad being sick.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.600
I'm going to be like, thank you pocket money.

23:00.600 --> 23:04.600
No, I gave it to my parents. I took them out for breakfast yesterday.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.600
My dad and my mom got so much food because of me.

23:08.600 --> 23:12.600
They were just like, we haven't eaten out like this is such a long time.

23:12.600 --> 23:17.600
And then I literally, this is before we sat down too.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.600
I literally was making a joke.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.600
I'm like, dad, you know how I always ask you for your cut?

23:23.600 --> 23:31.600

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
She's like, what the fuck?

23:55.600 --> 24:01.600

25:44.600 --> 25:46.600
Yes, they do know what I do.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
They don't care.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
They know I'm a grown woman.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.600
So they're like, I make my own choices.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.600
So and they're still supportive, especially when I can pay my bills.

25:57.600 --> 26:02.600

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
Wait, what?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.600

I was just like, they knew that we didn't go to celebrate because I'm a successful whore.

27:03.600 --> 27:09.600
We went on to celebrate because they've known I wanted YouTube partner since I was younger.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.600
And I remember I was saying it to my dad.

27:12.600 --> 27:17.600

27:41.600 --> 27:45.600
I'm not going to say how old, but it's been a long time.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.600

28:31.600 --> 28:33.600
I'll get like longer almond shaped nails.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.600
But I can't play games when my nails are long.

Like, I can't.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.600

So, unless I'm playing with a controller.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.600
So, I might forget it.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.600
I'm like sweating.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.600
I'm suddenly sweating, but I'll be fine.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.600
What is this?

28:55.600 --> 28:57.600
Oh, I get to make shit later.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
It's longer.

29:18.600 --> 29:19.600
It's longer.

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600
That's all I can say.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.600
Cause like, I don't like having short nails.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.600
Cause it makes my hands are like, my fingers are really long.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.600
But this makes my hands like fucking stubby.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.600
I got stubby little paws.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600

my mom was telling me a story one time that so my mom would like um model like the shoes that she

would get because she like my mom used to be obsessed with shoes um and she was an office

48:34.160 --> 48:39.360
woman that's why she also identifies with she be a lot because she was uh she was always assistant

48:39.360 --> 48:44.560
to a ceo type thing and um although she should have been running the company to be honest with you

48:45.200 --> 48:51.040
um and apparently like some of the people from her office found like her page of like where she

48:51.040 --> 48:54.560
would like show off her shoes and it's because she had really nice feet and then she found out

48:54.560 --> 48:59.280
that was on fetish sites and so uh her and my dad had to go get it taken down and then she stopped posting

49:03.840 --> 49:06.400

and the ace is the assassin and then there's like um like a king is like the cop

50:53.920 --> 50:58.160
and so you have to figure out like which one has the ace who is the assassin and then like this is

50:58.160 --> 51:06.080
like the candy equivalent like everybody you're either a um uh just a sweet candy but if you have

51:06.080 --> 51:12.720
the sour candy you're like the killer yeah if you yeah help find the suspect each fruity candy

51:12.720 --> 51:16.560
starts purple and changes color in your mouth to reveal the guilty or innocent everyone takes

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.640
member strip streams i was talking to like strawney and the other girls because i've never done a

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:22.640
watch a long stream but i want to do the master disguise next week um also uh what's it called

transparency i go back to work next week well tomorrow like is my first day back

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.000
and i have to work full time for whatever stupid reason although i got the part time position so

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:40.160
i don't know what's up with that um i'm like this close you guys can't see but i'm like

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:46.320
holding my fingers like really close together um until just like quitting i might just like

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:52.160
go to work tomorrow see how the vibes are and if it and if the vibes aren't good i might just dip

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.920
i might just dip who knows i'm thinking about it

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.680
it's just like it's or like and i say dip probably like dip and like find another job just

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:11.680
because um streaming wouldn't sustain me although it would be nice but we'll be maybe we'll be full

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:15.360
time eventually um but like

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:22.080
it's just like the place changed i've been there for almost six years

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:28.000
and it just yeah it's just like changed a lot don't care about their staff anymore so i'm like

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:38.000
i'm outy i'm outy yeah i appreciate you guys so much yeah retail slugs work sucks i know

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:44.560
i guess i've done retail as one month can we watch the princess ride oh yeah we're 100%

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:49.840
going to watch the princess ride remember it ships streams we do karaoke asmr we're playing

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.880
oh yeah i'm probably going to call my asmr stream something else i'm probably not going to

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:59.840
call them asmr streams just because youtube has just hated people who do any sort of asmr

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:06.480
whether you're a fleshy or a fear of youtuber a fleshy sounds like a slur i sh that doesn't

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:20.480
sound good um if you're a regular human streamer um and or youtuber but so i might call them like

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:29.680
3do roleplays smoothskins it's like a like calling somebody in a knife ear poor elves

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.560
youtube is kind of on yeah

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:43.120
so i'll probably call them 3do roleplays or uh audio roleplays um and i'm not like

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:50.960
really an asmr like i do do asmr but i i'm not i'm still work like i haven't done asmr with

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:54.960
the 3do before with like triggers and everything i'm used i usually just do whispering and like

01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:02.400
rambling anytime i did asmr but i'm gonna be working on like actually doing asmr oh anonymous
