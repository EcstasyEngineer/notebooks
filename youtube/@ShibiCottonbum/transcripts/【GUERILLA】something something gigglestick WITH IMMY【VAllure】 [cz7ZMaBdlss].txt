Work. OBS. Sometimes it just ends after I started. I love it when it does that. Okay, I didn't do it though.
Yippee!
Maybe you mute myself so I don't hear myself.
Oh my god.
Yeah.
Because you are so fucking small.
You are on us. Okay, if we're legit with how tall you are and how tall I am.
So I am like this. My legs are so fucking long, bro. And then there's you. You'd be like down here.
You'd be like that.
Wasn't you? Yeah, you a shawty.
Oh, you're so small. I can just move you around. Yeah, she's like my little doll. Oh wow, she's like my little...
Oh, you're muted? Oh, you are muted.
You attached me. You attached me to you.
Get me off!
Oh, you're so cute. It's like I'm holding onto you like a little puppet.
Set me free. Let me go.
My cute little sister and me.
Okay, I'll make you bigger.
Oh my god.
Thank you. Perfect.
A happy family. I can't even see my chat. That's why I didn't know you were muted. Hold on.
Oh my god. So how's everybody doing?
Hope everyone's doing well. Yeah, I'm getting ads on my own video.
Wait, really? Yeah.
I should have just not monetized it. She's a little brats. The immuppet. Oh my god, Emmy Muppet.
No, oh my god, people are gonna fuck the immuppet.
Toma's already working on a Muppet for you.
Oh, now I gotta use it.
She just was doing it for fun for our designs, but she's like, yeah, I just want to make one based off of Muppets.
She's making you, she's basing you off of the rat.
And I'm like, she'll love that.
Um, but yeah, me and...
G-U-E-R-I-L-L-A.
Did I add an extra L? Okay, no, I didn't.
So you probably saw the silliness that took place. It looks like we're about to do an apology video.
We're sorry for getting Strawny's channel a-straked.
We're sorry for cooking you by having sex with each other.
In discord.
We will never do such a thing again.
Oh, really?
Um, no, but we were just hanging out after our collab earlier and me and Emmy had been cooking up something for you guys.
And so then we wanted to make a joke.
Then I was going through my scripts because I realized I could record scripts at the same time as being in a discord call.
So I'm like, ah, maybe Emmy can give me some pointers or whatever.
Am I moaning? Well, you can tell me.
And I'm reading the scripts and I'm like, wait, what the fuck is off the entirety of October?
Like, what is this? I can't.
And so I'm just posting screenshots and glimpses of the script.
And so I sent it to Emmy.
Um, and I don't know what we're going to do with it.
You want to act it out together?
I think that'd be cool if we just pick the worst one, you think?
Okay, okay.
Because I know for a fact that Strani's not going to have me do the scripts now.
You actually have the names of your scriptwriters. I never have names online.
The last one I don't have names on the scriptwriter and if I figured out who it was, I would fight them.
Because my scripts literally before October are fine.
Okay, okay.
Most of them are not that bad.
In October?
Yeah, I think it's just that one.
That one? I'm trying to find it. I don't know what that could just do with it.
I'm reading the other ones and they're not that bad. It's just that one.
Was that number two?
Um, it's number one.
Oh no, you didn't look at number two then.
What's wrong with number two?
Uh, face-mashing and slurping in a better mood, good snogging.
I'll make you forget all about her.
Here on Clash Rock, remember these?
The most mouth-watering tits you've ever put in your mouth. Play with those.
What the fuck are you reading?
I'm reading! I'm reading the second one.
I think it's like a third paragraph down.
Tummy Gurgle. Oh, look who's hungry now.
Sorry funnel cake is gone and the truck usually leaves by now.
I'm only teasing. I know this is a bit backwards, but how about there?
That's not that bad.
It's not, it's really...
Here, let's start, let's start around the...
She glurps his giggle stick against her face so much.
Where is, I can't add up to it.
Hold on, let me, let me control find giggle stick.
It's up medium.
I have like 101 things that contain giggle in my entire master's group.
Is the giggle stick two words? Okay, it is. I found it.
Okay, do you want to, do you want, I'll do the voice acting part and then you can read the direction?
Sure, sure, sure.
Okay, okay. So I'm going to start at enough.
Enough.
So if you go a couple sentences up, it's at the beginning of the paragraph.
Enough. She forces herself up.
Oh, I found it, I found it.
Okay, ready?
Take a sip of the water.
You guys are getting glorps on you.
Okay, you guys are getting insider information.
Although I know for a fact the script is not going to be used, but...
Enough.
She forces herself up and splurts his gock from her pummeled vagine.
You didn't have that bad a day to where I'm just going to let you forget your manners. Sit.
The toilet squeaks in resistance to both of their weight.
You're way too cocky for a man risking his entire livelihood in a public restroom.
And you forget that this rabbit...
She glorps his giggle stick against her fasal nut.
Is mine.
She begins sliding down and riding.
Aha, now who look who's whimpering like a bitch?
That's right, bitch.
Ha.
Domineering Humpery.
You ain't nothing but a bitch to me.
And y'all know, bitches ain't shit to me.
Fucking take it.
Ha.
If I were caught in make national headlines,
a bitch like you would probably be a single HR email.
Look at that pathetic fucking face.
He comes.
Huh? You came?
So...
Plop.
What?
Plopping intensifies.
I still need mine, bitch.
You selfish motherfucker.
You think you're better than me?
You think you're hot shit?
You think now that you've got a bit of cash?
You can have any girl you want.
Look at you.
You can't even have a girl show up to date you.
And you think you can come before me?
Ha ha.
I bet.
Door opens.
Get the fuck out.
Do the slams, cops!
Ha.
You're nothing.
Nothing.
You're fuck.
Fuck.
She whimpers into a shuttering orgasm.
Ha.
Oh.
You came again?
Ha.
Oh.
Ha.
Oh.
Wind down.
Like, wait.
Did he leave?
Like the door shut.
I don't...
No, someone walked in while they were doing it.
And then left.
That's what it was.
I'm dead.
Okay.
Ha.
That was amazing.
Ha.
Ha.
She takes some toilet paper to wipe the mess.
Here.
Let me clean you off.
Slurp.
Pop.
Ah.
You all right?
She begins dressing herself.
I kind of mashed you down into the toilet there.
Here.
Give me your hand.
She helps him up.
Up you go.
Oh.
Careful.
That's what it says.
Can't feel your legs.
Come on.
Lean on me.
Door opens.
Uh, or excuse us.
Time skip.
Okay.
Slowly.
Slowly on the bench.
They sit.
Oh.
I'll be right back.
She leaves.
Returns a bit later.
Here.
Some water.
Hold.
So nice.
I know.
It's looking nice.
Huh?
Oh, I just have sensitive teeth.
So, oh yeah.
They both drink?
How about the same cup?
I mean, they just, they just fucked in the bathroom.
So whatever.
Listen, I, uh, I'm sorry for what I said back there.
I know.
I know.
I know you're already having a shitty day and, uh, really?
Huh?
So you like that kind of talk, huh?
I guess with my line of work, I can pick up the kind of person who likes being talked
down to.
Tell me, Gurgle.
Oh, look who's hungry now.
Sorry.
Funnel cake is gone.
The truck usually leaves by now.
I'm only teasing.
I know this is a bit backwards, but how about dinner?
My treat.
Can you stand?
No rush.
All right.
Come on.
I know a place.
It's not far.
Wow.
How romantic.
Oh, look at that.
The bathroom and then went to, to a park bench.
I don't know.
No, I'm not.
We're not even reading fanfics, guys.
This is a script.
We're reading Shibi's scripts.
This is my, that was a script that was handed to me.
And thank you for that.
Do you want to read the first one?
Yeah, we can do it.
Oh, I think, I think the first one's a little bit.
This has to be an audio.
Come on.
You guys want that to be an audio?
All right.
That's the first one.
Oh, this one's ridiculous.
Is it all the pants and part?
Yeah.
My cat's trying to hop up on my lap.
Not now, Fia.
We're busy.
Okay.
We're fucking busy, Fia.
You can start.
Okay.
Beeping key card lock.
Unlock door.
Heels approaching.
Long night.
I startled you, didn't I?
I would have knocked, but I own the place.
I'm sorry.
She doesn't burp.
Your hotel room.
Your hotel room.
No, you're right.
This is a misunderstanding.
Just not the one you think it is.
Here.
Sit.
She pats the bed.
You're the one who is with that rowdy crowd at the bar, right?
The one's cheering like a Super Bowl riot.
She clicks her tongue shamingly.
No social awareness whatsoever.
Look at you.
Apologizing.
You're not in trouble.
Not yet, anyway.
Here.
Compliments of the hotel.
She pops a bottle, pours two drinks.
Actually, I would have celebrated with you all then and there if I wasn't paraded around
by my usual ass kissers and yes men.
So, what are we celebrating?
A promotion?
Oh, cheers to that.
She swirls her icing soups.
This is not bad.
Yeah, this one's not that bad, actually.
I don't know if you can hear the...
You probably can't hear the, um, the donos.
But someone said, thank you for the $2 tip.
Damn, I need a cold shower to calm my giggle stick after that slurping scenario.
Crick the fuck up.
Calm your giggle stick.
Oh, you can't hear them?
That's fine.
This was just lily a girl.
Guys, you don't have to donate for this.
Um, okay.
Let me see where was it.
Oh, you sounded...
What?
Go ahead, sorry, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Hmm, you all sounded like you were having so much fun.
So, why did you leave early?
Tired?
Tired of what?
Huh, you know, I always like that phrase,
drain social battery.
It's a way more polite and succinct than fed up with everyone's bullshit.
Straight to the point, you know.
She takes one more sip and sets her drink down.
Ooh, which is how I like it.
Hmm, how I like everything, really.
Which brings me to you.
Even as the obvious quiet one of your group of friends,
you made it so hard not to notice you in that zoo of a booth.
A cutie.
She steps forward.
Like.
She steps forward.
You.
She kisses the viewer.
Making out.
What's this here?
She rubs his erect stick through his pants.
That doesn't feel like the stick of a man who's tired.
In fact, it feels more of a stick that needs to be drained.
So how about it?
Shall we get to the point?
Good boy.
She nibbles at his neck kissing while she unbuckles his pants.
Disrose.
Here, let me slide these off.
Now, on the bed.
Good boy.
She crawls into the bed kissing and rubbing at his hips.
What is rubbing at his hips mean?
And now these.
Rubbing those hip bones.
She slides his tiny lighties off.
His tiny lighties off.
I didn't catch that one when I read it before.
It's always the quiet ones with the biggest sticks.
Why is that?
Rubbing a man with absolutely nothing to compensate for.
Glock suckering.
Feel nice.
Of course it does.
Slippery slobbering until she stops mid popsicle slurp.
Hey, do not touch the ears.
Good boy.
She continues into throating.
I think now that we should really get the celebration started.
What do you say, big shot?
That's what I like to hear.
Light teasing.
She slinks out of her ponzu.
Bring that dick here, boy.
She starts to grind on the tip before lightly slapping him.
Ah, ah, ah, don't get greedy now.
What's wrong?
Don't like my cat kissing the top of your stick?
Aw, but you're celebrating.
There's no need to rush this, baby.
We can party all night if you're able.
Just allow me to savor this a bit slowly.
Slowly on the tip.
She laughs as she swirls her hips just the bellend half inside.
And that's what it says.
It says bellend, everyone.
My big, heavy hips need to savor the shape of the tip.
Aw.
She slides her kitty down the top of his popsicle.
Glides so smoothly against the top of your popsicle.
Look at you.
We're supposed to be celebrating, weren't we?
I shouldn't be having all the fun, but I'm not fully sure you want this.
Say, if you had to choose between your new promotion and losing that position in exchange
for sliding the full length of your cat.
I mean, your dog all the way to the base inside of my tight, gripping cat.
What would you say right now?
Hmm?
Oh, I can't hear you.
Please?
Please, what?
That's please, madam.
Louder, boy.
Ah, good boy.
Now we can celebrate.
Segs, slow and heavy.
And it said with two G's.
With two G's, it says.
Hmm, almost.
She be laughs, releasing desperate exiles as she restrains herself to slowly descend down.
The popsicle in capital letters.
The Triton.
The Triton.
Yeah, the Triton's filling me so good.
Here, put your hands here.
Now, little man.
A nasty laughter.
You're going to want to hold on.
Heavy slapping, no pants dance, followed by animal grunting.
Yeah, all the way in.
Wetness increases.
Making your way up in the world.
Still yet, ungh, fucking beneath me.
No matter how hard you work, you'll always be nothing but a popsicle to do.
You want that, don't you?
That's yes, mistress.
Segs pauses.
Wait, wait, wait.
I need this bra off.
She releases her fat tiddage free from the burdens of a bra as she catches her breath.
Now.
Oh fuck, sex medium pace.
Have you ever seen a more perfect pair of fucking tits?
Oh, don't even answer that because you haven't.
And now, I want them in your mouth.
Sex reasons.
Ah, that's it.
Ah, that's...
Monkey noises.
Wait, this does monkey noises?
It says monkey noises.
Go on, make the monkey noises.
Ah, another one.
Ah, fit bath for those fat fuckers in your mouth.
Yes, yes.
Sex fast paced.
More, I want more.
Her pace becomes rapid and animalistic.
You small time bitch.
Fuck me, you're fucking nobody.
Are you coming?
Coming?
Are you coming?
Fuck.
He fills sheebie to the brim with a nasty load of pent-up gunk.
Fuck.
Wind down, catching her breath.
Nothing like a little fireworks to cap off a party.
She slips from her drink.
Oh, goodness.
Look at all that flowing out.
I can tell you're a workaholic with no time to let loose.
Just look how much you let loose in me.
She laughs and then kisses him.
Look at that.
Such a content little smile.
Not that forced uncomfortable smile around your friends from the bar,
but a real one.
It's beautiful.
Oh, me.
You're too sweet.
I don't want anyone folk in my life,
but you, I can tell you're different.
Awkward pause.
Oh, um, that's stuff about you being a nobody.
I, um, I was just dirty talk.
I didn't mean that.
Any of it.
Everything good.
That's um, that's good.
Even more awkward pause.
Oh, um, I forgot that I had more work to do tonight.
She begins putting her clothes back on.
Oh, um, uh, keep the bottle top shelf stuff.
Or so they tell me.
I just told the bartender to give me something impressive and stiff.
Sounds like you.
Laughter trails off.
So, um, see ya.
Door closes.
Why was the ending so fucking unsexy?
Oh, come on.
That was it.
That was the first group.
The deku accent.
I literally, I have tears running down my face.
I know me too.
Oh, ooh, ooh.
Oh, tidy whitey.
Tidy whitey.
Oh, my God.
I just had to share this with you guys.
I know, I just tried to do a loser at the end.
Thank you for this super LP, 4145.
If this becomes an audio, I will seriously consider
something to my Patreon.
Oh my God.
No, guys, there's literally a full month of October
like this, the fucking monkey noises.
I'm like, do they hate me?
Why did they even write monkey noises?
Oh my God.
Whoever wrote those scripts cooked with gas.
Thank you, feel their love for this super.
All right.
Aside from the mildly racist undertones,
this is pretty funny.
Oh my God, I didn't even think about that.
I didn't notice.
Oh, you see, the sweet precious child.
I love you so much, Emmy.
When you said monkey, I just thought it related
to like animalistic, you know?
Yeah, the animalistic monkey noises.
Yeah, but he did write you a little stupidly.
Yeah.
No, so if you guys are new coming in,
I was in call with Emmy and we were working
on an audio together for something else
that she will probably finish up at some point.
And I can't wait for you guys to hear that.
We're very excited.
But I was like, oh, since I figured out
I can record during a call,
let me look at my stuff right now
and we can just like hang out and I can record
and you can like make fun of me, whatever.
So I'm looking at my October scripts.
I haven't recorded September yet.
I was looking at October because I was like,
oh yeah, what are my scripts again?
I didn't read it that far ahead.
And I'm just like, I'm like, what is this?
And I'm like sending screenshots in our discord
with the other girls.
And I'm like, Strani, Strani, please.
What is it?
What is this?
And I'm like, what are these?
What are these?
Oh, I'm like, she definitely, I'm like,
Strani probably had faith in the script writer
or that somebody was trolling
and just fucking just did something.
Or I don't know.
Maybe someone got hold of the link for my scripts.
I don't know.
So who knows?
I think it's genuinely the script writer.
I want to just note,
because my script writers usually write off
what they've written and this person did it.
And I feel like they did that on purpose.
They were ashamed, they were ashamed.
It's great though.
So that was, that's the first script for,
it's called Entanglements.
It's a Shelby or Shibi.
And it's supposed to be, that was,
it's a four for the entire month.
It's just a continuation.
It's a story.
You know what I think we should do, Amy?
I think we should do the other scripts.
You want to spoil them?
At a later time.
I'll ask Strani if we could do,
I think she'll be fine if we did this one.
But I think if we did that as like a little Mimi joke,
or if I record them seriously with you narrating the activity,
I think that would be absolutely peak.
It would.
Yeah.
And we can just like upload both to our,
both of our Patreons.
That would be funny.
I don't think any of the other girls had stuff like this.
I think it was just me.
Yeah, I don't have anything like that,
but I haven't like,
they haven't written up to October for me.
Yeah.
So that's why.
Yeah.
So I don't know if like the script writers,
but it's good because it's good that I fucking noticed it
because I would hate for the girls to get other stuff.
And like, like I see who I know,
Strani was saying who's ESL might not like,
quite understands like, okay,
I guess I just read this then.
And think that it's like sounds okay when it doesn't.
Honestly though, I think I see would have noticed
and been like, what is this?
Yeah.
I don't think I see would just like read out like,
yeah.
Lucky noises.
Oh, this is, this would be funny for April Fool's as well.
Just do like a meme-y, like really meme-y,
lewd audios for, oh my God.
I'm asking Strani about that.
I think that's a good idea.
Yeah.
It's Tracy and Daddy ESL.
Yeah.
I don't think, yeah.
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
Kickles.
Oh my God.
But I hope we didn't stress Strani out too much.
I mean, she was gonna find out sooner or later.
It'd be funny if I like center the audio.
I should, I imagine if I didn't say anything
and I just recorded it, it just said it to her.
I don't think she listens to our audio,
so I think it would have passed.
I think you're the only one who got scripts like this
because you're the only one to view a letter
that can turn a sex script into a joke
with my impersonations.
It's beat comedy.
Thank you for this, I like that.
That's good.
Give that a little heart.
It's for myself.
That's so great.
I guess Strani was more,
way more stressed by her card game.
Yeah, I saw she was, she was sweating a little bit.
Oh my God.
But thanks for stopping by Emmy.
I just asked,
because I know Emmy has some stuff to get done.
So thank you for spending time with me real briefly.
Thanks for having me.
I love you, Emmy.
I love you too.
Have fun, what are you doing next?
I don't know, I'm probably just gonna yap.
Okay, have fun yapping.
Yeah, I'm something, I don't know.
I'll see you later.
Bye, Harold.
And the pin pals.
We got some pin pals in the chat.
Pin pals, goodbye, goodbye.
See you later.
Bye, bye, bye.
Wait, I forget that I have to like, quit the collab.
She's like, stop it.
She's like, doing stuff.
All right, I'm sorry, little sister gone.
Okay.
I'm like so far behind in my own bond.
I'm like, what the fuck?
Oh, I'm not leaving it.
I'll probably like stay on for a little bit,
but like, yeah, I just had to share that with you guys.
I love Emmy so much.
We've been in call.
We were in call together for a little bit,
and then Mercy had some stuff to do too.
Cause it was literally like me, I see Mercy and Emmy
and Strani for a little bit, just hanging out.
And Strani had a stream.
I see how to go to bed to pour a little polar bear.
And Azura was streaming,
and then Mercy had to go take care of some stuff.
So, but that was, it was,
so yeah, me and, me and Emmy were just like chatting.
And I'm just like, you know,
cause she has a lot more experience with me
than me with like audios and stuff.
So I was just like grabbing pointers from her.
And she's like, you're doing really good.
I'm like, yeah.
And then I'm like, let me look at my audios.
And let me look at my script.
And I was like, wait a second, something's not right.
Something's not right.
This is the most feeler.
I was really funny.
It was really funny.
It was really fun.
Yeah, so the whole month of October is like that.
November and December are still on the writing stage.
I haven't started recording September yet,
but I was gonna record September
after the, I got off Call of Emmy,
but then I got distracted with this.
But yeah, cause I think October was supposed to be the month
where I was like the Dommie month,
but like, I'll be honest with you.
There's just, you can just like,
some of my first scripts were written by like Strani.
And you could tell like a woman wrote them
versus like a man writing this,
although this is definitely very meme-y.
So I don't know if like they were taking it serious.
I don't know.
But then I have like one of our other script writers,
Etwa, and they have good scripts too.
So I'm like, they wrote very similarly to Strani.
So I'm like, okay, maybe, I don't know.
Maybe they just like never written before.
I don't know what happened.
I also didn't tweet.
I'm sorry.
I didn't like tweet to say I was live or anything.
I was just like, I'm here.
So I apologize.
Cause I was just like, okay, we need to tell the people this
and give them an explanation as to what we were doing in Call.
Although we immediately prepared ourselves
and we heard Strani's like, we're gonna hop and call.
And we were like, okay, start moaning.
Start doing stuff.
But I hope that gets clipped cause it would be so funny.
Um, yeah.
It was literally, but it's not even chat, GPT,
chat, GPT would not write something like that.
Chat, GPT would never write something like that.
I don't think.
But it was, yeah, it was so bad.
It was great.
I can imagine the script writer must have felt bad
about writing a lot of script
and so I had some meme humor in the parentheses
since narration isn't meant to be read out loud.
Yes, but even like, even with the dialogue
in the later scripts, it's not good.
And that was just the first script.
It gets progressively worse.
And we have more than one script writer.
So it's not like one person is writing 30 scripts a month.
It's like there's multiple people writing us scripts.
And then Strani will also like chime in
every once in a while as well.
As a lead translator myself,
these scripts were not something I never considered
except it will work for me.
Kind of, exactly.
It's like when I, one, they're doing a lot of like direction
and then like when I, I don't know,
maybe it's because like one of our other script writers
and Strani just writes differently when they give me scripts,
but they do a lot of like direction and what's going on.
They're doing a lot of saying and not,
or they're doing a lot of showing and not saying,
which is not what you do for an actual script.
At some point you should hold script writing competitions
and pick the best four for each month.
Oh, that'd be pretty cool.
For like maybe like a special month, we do that.
That'd be really nice.
That's a good idea.
Bring out with Strani.
She be a bridge.
That's literally, this is the month of October,
she be a bridge.
Big shout out to Smoothie for a good evening.
Big shout out to Smoothie for their viewer debut.
Oh, a hundred percent, yes.
Thank you so much to Smoothie
for doing a debut compilation of us.
I was like, holy crap, this is awesome.
It was so good.
I was laughing.
I'm like, I was so embarrassed.
The first opening line for the video
is welcome to be sucky fucky.
Well, where did you fucky?
You're sucking whatever the fuck I said.
I was like, oh my God.
Yeah, mommy's scripts are very, very good.
And I've also learned a lot
since I've started doing scripts,
like what you guys like, what you guys don't like
and like how you want me to read things.
I've also fixed my 3DO.
So it's, yeah, please watch Smoothie's video.
It was really, really funny
how he edited us all together.
But yeah, so, and I'm probably gonna hold
some sort of like script writing stream when I come back
because, and I've mentioned doing this before,
before I read the script, but I'm like, okay,
if this is the script that gets submitted,
I know I can write better than this.
Because like for example,
it's like everything's like, when like Shrani writes,
it's like everything's guided and like by word of mouth
and it's very, it's very like seductive and alluring.
And it's like, she's through the dialogue,
she's telling you what's happening.
But this person was mostly just writing direction
and it was very odd.
I'm like, we're not acting it out,
but I'm so sorry to the script writer if you're watching,
but that was very silly.
There were some very, very good things in there.
Hi, hi, hi.
But yeah, I wanted to like hop on and show you guys that,
but I can't wait for you guys to listen to the audio
that me and Amy just did together.
It was really nice.
You guys don't like it.
But yeah, it's inspired by a certain someone
who did a similar script in the past
that a lot of people enjoyed.
And so we wanted to do one ourselves.
Script writer, you cooked, but it was the wrong menu.
Honestly, facts, like the script is awesome,
but it's awesomely bad.
But it's like, you know, like it's like,
I'm trying to say this as nice as way possible.
Yeah, a certain someone.
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
Hello, hello.
Where is the audio gonna be uploaded?
I think she's uploading it to Twitter.
I think part one, there's two parts,
part one, I think will be on mine
and I think part two will be on mine,
either one, we each have a part.
Amy's a good script writer.
She's also a very good actress
because we were in call together, working out the script.
And so I had to sit there and listen to her, do her lines,
and I'm trying so hard not to laugh.
Yeah, it'll be a Twitter audio, I'm pretty sure.
Just so everybody can see it.
Yeah, it's a short thing.
It's not like 10 minutes long.
It's literally like two minutes, if not shorter than that.
Her audio with IC was base.
I heard it was, I heard it was really good.
You're gonna piss myself laughing.
I lost it, yeah.
Dude, I was literally losing it in the call with Emmy.
I'm like, Emmy, please look at this.
Please tell me I'm not going crazy.
And then I posted it and I was like, manager,
is this your fault?
And they were just like, why am I catching strays?
No.
And I'm like, I'm telling Strani.
And I'm like, Strani, please, please.
That's when I hopped around like Emmy, let's hop in the call.
And she's like, oh my God, but we were cackling so hard.
But now I know what you guys get for Emmy's audios.
She gave me a little taste and I'm like, okay.
All right, all right.
Oh my gosh, I can see.
Like, damn, my little sister's so talented.
And I'm like, how do I sound like that?
Like teach me your ways.
She does spoil you.
I was like, damn.
I was gripping my mouse, listening to her like, excuse me.
I want to be just like Emmy.
But it was, yeah, it was really fun to record.
And then now that I know that we both know
that we can record stuff in calls with each other,
we definitely want to get the other girls
to record stuff with us in calls
because it would just be so funny.
And then we can also give each other like tips and stuff.
And then like, yeah, I think it would just be great.
Nilsis, Emmy, Big Sis, Gibi, exactly.
But yeah, I'm sure, like the pin pals
are definitely gonna like it.
Harem is definitely gonna like it.
But yeah, the wholesome bonding, 100%.
Yeah, I like, I love spending time every time.
One of the girls left the call
when we were like all like kind of trickling off
to do our stuff that we had to get done,
whether it be like audios, scripts or whatever.
Smacked my hand on the table.
I'm like, like I see left.
I was like, I love that bear.
And Mercy left.
I'm like, I love that yandere.
Amy left.
I didn't say anything, but you guys know that I love her.
I love that little pumpkin girl,
that little hex maniac.
Anyone idea what's gonna drop?
Oh, I don't know.
Emmy has a lot of projects going on right now.
She's cooking up a bunch of stuff for you pin pals.
So just wait, don't worry.
But we both recorded it in like 10 minutes.
So it's really, she has to edit and stuff.
I asked her if she needed help.
She says, she's like, oh, I'm just gonna edit.
I'm like, okay.
I kind of want to teach her to teach me how to edit
and as well as Strani to teach me how to edit that stuff.
Cause usually I just like send it off to the audio editor
and then like insert all the like sound effects
and all that stuff.
It would be cool to like learn how to do that.
But yeah, it was, it was really fun and it was funny.
Like I would be using like my mommy voice.
I'd be like, come on little girl and be like, hey.
And she was like, it was really funny.
And then when she was making like her portion
that I'm not going to spoil.
I was like screaming internally.
So I hope you guys like it.
But yeah.
I hope you guys liked also the title of my stream,
something simple, something giggle stick.
I need to sneeze.
Thank you.
But yeah, it's really small and short,
but I think you guys will like it.
So short, sweet to the point.
Thank you, thank you.
But yeah, it means converting she be into someone.
I think honestly, I think, yeah.
I think I'm definitely being, I'm getting Emmy Pilled.
Can my allergies have been acting up like for the past few days?
I've been like sniffing a whole bunch.
But yeah, I hope you guys shibbling.
Don't get me started on the cotton bum family.
I literally just did that off the rip, by the way.
I don't even, I was possessed by some incestuous devil
to just do all that random ass lore.
I'm so sorry for some of you.
I thought it was funny as hell.
Based on yesterday's stream,
I think Emmy fully converted you already 100%.
Bro, imagine she being Emmy playing Kauffman,
Andy and Lillie.
That would be so funny.
If we did a collab stream playing Kauffman,
Andy and Lillie.
And like I voiced Andy and she voices Ashley.
I think that would be really, really funny
before building that day was wild it was.
But I just wanted to like do something kind of silly
and kind of like ridiculous.
Well, you guys literally watched me farm for four hours.
Honestly, I don't even remember farming.
I don't even, I generally don't even remember
what I was doing.
I just like shot a bird for four hours.
I got four million runes.
And yeah, and I just wanted you guys to laugh a bunch.
Don't lie, you've been playing this lore
since before your debut.
No, I usually actually was like never really
into that sort of stuff.
But like I get the allure.
Ha ha, ha ha, the V allure.
So I'm like, you know what?
Let me do a little treat for like the harem
cause usually you don't get that from me.
Let me do that.
And you guys know like I love being cute and funny sometimes.
Like it kind of like, I can like,
I feel like I show a different side of myself
when I get to be like shebethany and be cute and funny.
And then when I'm sheby, I can be like, you know,
my more like mommy adult self.
Oh, and you know, it's very, it's always fun.
I like, cause I, you guys know,
I used to be cute and funny on the daily.
So I'm at my PL.
So it's, I kind of miss that sometimes.
But I also just love being a big powerful woman
with drill hair.
Yeah.
I think you're always cute and funny.
Oh, thank you, so sweet.
But yeah, I think I'm, I mean, I see they've got me.
I'm like, oh man, I miss like that sort of stuff.
I miss being a princess.
And then Mercy makes me be like,
oh, I miss being kind of yandere.
But what I like about all of us is like,
we don't feel like we all can like do each other's niches.
Like, you know, like sometimes it means Dom,
sometimes Mercy's Dom, sometimes it means yandere.
Sometimes I see is like a little bit yandere.
Sometimes Azura is more Dom.
Like I remember Azura like said some like crazy stuff
on my stream that was like very Dommy
when during our collab stream with Emmy and Mercy.
And I was like, excuse me.
Sorry, I'm talking so fast, by the way.
I think I had caffeine.
So I'm like, I also feel really bad
because I feel like I talked a lot during the,
let me slow down.
Deep breath, sheepie.
I feel like I talked a lot during the collab.
So I'm sorry if I like talked over your Oshii
or what, then I'm sorry.
Don't hurt me.
Yep, God.
Kicking in.
Someone that will allow you,
so it's not a human.
I don't know guys, it's a human.
I'm super human as well.
I'm gonna get in, I'm gonna get in.
All I see is the beginning of multiple personality disorder.
It's gonna be great.
Oh my God.
Bunspeak, no, Bunspeak would be when I get a pyre.
When I get a pyre, when I get like this,
when I get Bunspeak, that's Bunspeak.
That's when I get a mulliness and I sound really cute.
What's next, loving girlfriend, Sheebie?
You kind of already gotten that the past couple days.
Oh my God, Eminem's a YouTuber now.
Rap got Sheebie in the house, yeah.
But yeah, you just carry the conversation.
Yeah, sometimes I like,
sometimes I have to tell myself if there's a silence,
like I can be comfortable in the silence.
Sometimes I feel like I need to fill a silence.
Sheebie popping off today.
I'm full of, I'm full of all the jokes, you know.
Are you happy you're at 8K subscribers?
Yes, it was such a pleasant surprise
that I noticed that this morning,
because only like yesterday or the day before,
I was at 7.7, so that the clip,
the debut stuff probably helped a lot in the collab stuff.
So I'm glad that you guys like me and enjoy me.
Like I said, and one of my goals was to get 10K subs,
and I'm literally almost close to that,
and it's surreal to me.
Younger me would be confused, but proud
of how I got 10K subs,
because I've always wanted to be, you know,
a YouTuber and stuff or a streamer,
and my dreams are coming true.
And I get to be a whore, like it's great.
Affectionate, you know.
But yeah, it'll be super cool.
I'm trying to think of what to do for 10K.
I think I was, I'm probably gonna do
another hand cam for 10K.
I was, or maybe like a hand cam ASMR,
but that'd be cool.
You guys can see the stupid shit that I do.
But yeah, I prefer to give me ideas for 10K
because I would love to celebrate that milestone with you,
but I'm so very, very, very thankful for all of you.
8K is a really big number to me,
and I just can't wait.
And it's funny, because like,
Strawny's like, just you wait,
just until you wait until I get you that 100K play button.
And I'm like, oh, don't say that.
Like, oh my God, like that just seems so surreal to me.
And like, you're doing great, Shabrowski.
You got to be a woe.
What's a woe?
Lovingly?
Oh, a woe.
Oh, I got you, me.
Very funny.
But yeah, and I'm proud of the other girls too.
Like, I think Strawny is about to hit 10K
or probably has hit 10K.
I noticed it when me and Emmy were watching her stream
and giggling like a bunch of maniacs that I was like,
oh, she's at 9.9.
So like, Strawny's about to hit 10K.
Emmy is past 10K.
Icy finally hit 10K, 6K.
And I'm like, we're all growing at a steady pace.
And I'm so proud of all of us in the hard work
that we're all putting in.
It really shows.
And then again, the algorithm works in mysterious ways.
So sometimes like, one of us lag behind,
but we like make sure we lift each other up
because like, I'll say it like, Corpo Unity,
like we are unified.
Like we want to support everyone.
Strawny at 9.9, 4K.
Oh, see, like very close.
Like she'll probably hit 10K by the end of the night
or like tomorrow.
So I'm just really happy.
I'm happy that Strawny's dream is coming true.
She's giving us a platform to lift up smaller creators up.
They usually wouldn't have certain opportunities
and they're happening and it's great.
Like she was telling us about other opportunities
we might be able to have in the future.
And I literally was like, what?
Like we could have that.
We could get this.
Like, are you kidding me right now?
Like what?
Yeah, I'm so thankful for the girls.
I'm so thankful for them.
They're so wonderful.
I was literally in college before everybody left.
And I was like, can I just say, I love you all.
And Mercy's just like, I love you too.
And one, Mercy's a very lovey person.
Oh my gosh.
I walked away to use the bathroom,
but I still had my headphones on.
And it was, and then I think like Amy and Strawny
also like stepped away to like get tea and stuff and water.
And I'm like just like sitting on the toilet
using the bathroom with my headphones on.
And I just hear Mercy talking to Icy.
And she's just like, hi, Icy.
And Icy's like, hi.
And then she's just like, I love you, Icy.
And Icy's like, I love you too.
And I'm just like laughing on the toilet
because they're so fucking cute guys.
I swear to God.
But yes, like we all very much love each other.
We're all very supportive of each other.
And it's really cool.
Like I was, I liked talking, cause I was talking to Amy.
I'm like, oh, what'd you got going on?
Like what do you want to, like projects you want to do?
She was telling me and I'm like, aw, sick.
And I love the opportunity.
Like I always look forward to all of our collabs and stuff
because I just, we're usually busy with our own like streams
or like working on stuff.
So it kind of stinks when we can't like sit
and talk with each other.
And I was kind of bummed
cause like I know Azura had to stream afterwards.
And I was like, I wanted to hang out with Azura too.
I miss Azura.
I miss Azura.
I'm going to hang out with her
and have her just make funny noises on call.
Cause that's what she does.
She just giggles and cackles and just goes,
she's like, a little maniacal.
I love her for that.
Yeah, we got to hang out a lot, lots today.
And it was really awesome.
It was really great.
I can't wait.
We get to hang out.
Well, technically we don't get to hang out tomorrow, sad.
Cause we have the watch along, but like,
I kind of want to like be in call with them.
I'm going to ask actually, can we all be in call together
and we do the watch alongs
and I'll react at the same time.
I think we are going to do that.
I don't know.
At last, cause that would be great.
I'm still in call.
Whoops.
Let me just, I forgot I was still in call.
Any one of them could have walked in and been like, hey.
Oh.
Yeah, we're already like trying to make plans
to like see each other and stuff.
A monthly Jen collab.
Yeah.
We try for, we aim for that.
We try to aim for a month and then we might do
of like all of us.
And then like sometimes like, like me and Mercy
just like kind of just like jumped in call together.
Like we had a collab with other girls from mythos,
but then we kind of hung out with each other.
And then I did the same thing with Amy today.
And like, I want to do that with Icy.
And I want to do that.
And I've done, I want to do that with Azura and Strani.
Like I haven't even gotten into a collab with Strani yet.
Like what the hell?
But we all like definitely, like I'll just like wake up
and look at our Discord chat.
And yeah, Mercy collab's happening next week.
Yes, yes, yes.
We're playing Super Bunny Man.
I look at my, the Discord general for our company.
And it's just a bunch of us.
We're all just like, I love you.
I miss you.
We're gonna hang out.
I miss you guys.
What are you guys doing today?
What's going on?
Oh, that's really tasty food you posted.
Oh my God.
Your cat's so cute.
Like it's, it's great.
We need the viewer house to be real.
Imagine that would be so fun.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
It's just like, it's really nice to be a part of something.
And I didn't realize how much I wanted that.
Cause like I went into a company wanting to grow as a creator.
And I know, like I work well with others,
but I didn't know I would be so devoted and dedicated
to all the other girls.
I was just like, okay, am I gonna see them as coworkers?
And I'm like, no, I don't see them as coworkers.
I see them as very close friends.
Um, I know I'm bad when it comes to watching streams
of all kinds of everyone,
but generally I hope you all continue to grow and be happy.
I think we will.
And it's like, it's okay.
You don't have to like, you do what you can.
And we appreciate that.
We appreciate all of that.
How much do we need to donate to get the viewer house
to become real?
I think it would be way too much.
Viewer house turned into a battlefield by the pets.
Yeah, that's a good point.
We all have pets.
That'd be bad.
My cats would probably eat in these rats.
How are you doing?
I'm glad I can see my favorite bunny waifu.
Oh, thank you.
Hello, I'm doing really great.
I got to hang out with cute girls today
and I got to look at really awesome designs.
I really wish we could have done more.
Yeah, it does feel great to feel like you belong somewhere.
I've never like felt more meant to do something,
to be honest with you.
Like I am like, I am supposed to be here.
I belong here.
And like, I remember like hoping to the freaking universe
I got into Veealer and because I'm like,
I know I'm meant to be here.
And that's why I recorded my audition video
three days before auditions opened.
And I thought of all the possible questions
they may ask in the form so I could prepare
and send it in as fast as possible.
And that's why I was the first one
to submit my audition to the Veealer.
Veealer at her, so I need soundproofing in every room.
You're so right though.
Like all of us fucking just moaning.
Hi, she being fellow harem.
Hello.
I do really hope you all get many,
many years of streaming and growing.
Me too.
Like I am only thinking like,
this is only like the second month guys.
Like we're halfway through the second month
and I can't believe how much has happened and changed.
And it's all thanks to you guys.
Like what the heck?
My God.
But do you also belong to the October series?
No.
Oh.
Hi, hi, everybody coming in.
I was never into VTubers much
until I saw all of your debuts last month.
But now I'm glad I came and stayed.
I've had more laughs recently than I had in a while.
I'm so glad that all we want to do is make you laugh
and coom.
I love you and all of you are giggle sticks.
I think if I ever,
I think I'm gonna call it that from now on.
No, wait, no, but I really like the idea of Bible.
But giggle sticks is funny too.
I just think it's so funny.
That that happened.
Hold on, let me see.
Oopsies.
I didn't mean to go into the freaking,
I didn't mean to join another call.
Oh, my manager sent me my thumbnails for the month
and I'm like awkward
because we're doing a Twilight watch along next week.
And it's funny because it's just like me as like Bella
next to day, next to Edward.
Oh, so funny.
Well, as Vod say, oh, the Vod staying up.
I was kind of like talking to Emmy
and Emmy was kind of explaining to me
how like Vod limited stuff works
and she was kind of like showing me.
And I'm like, it's not,
as long as I don't get a strike, I think it's fine.
So I'm like, you know what, it's funny.
It's hilarious.
I'm leaving it up.
I'm glad you found something that was meant for you.
I know what I'm after.
There's some obstacles in between.
And for that, I hope to find something that clicks
like you did with the other.
Yeah, like it took some effort to get here.
Like I had to stream, I had to prove my worth.
You don't like, some companies will say like,
oh, you don't need any prior streaming service,
like experience, but you really do.
And so it is really recommended.
If you want to become a VTuber
and you want to join a company,
please stream for a little bit
because you might find out you don't like it
or it might not fit into your schedule
or it's not the type of lifestyle.
You might not be used to the hate or the positivity.
Like, you know, oh, thank you, Paul for the 10 gifted.
Thank you.
What the heck?
My gosh, I'll forgive the Bible.
The script master should release a new
English translation of the Bible.
I agree with that.
Thank you so much.
You're so sweet.
Team Edward or Team Jacob?
Team Jacob.
Team Jacob.
Celebratory pod keeping gifts.
Oh, mad I'm putting in that work in a show.
It deserves success.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I'm happy you guys are enjoying the work that I put in.
Should be the trolley deserve better into, oh, 100%.
Trolley deserve way better.
Are you kidding me?
I would hate my child if my child was, you know,
whatever that happened.
All that jazz.
What's a giggle stick?
I want you to look down in between your legs.
Um, and yet I guess, oh no.
We got touched again, bro.
Oh, we all know why Team Jacob don't look at me like that.
Shibi, can I ask the reason for why we can't give
the full memberships to the girls
and instead only the emotes here?
I, to be honest with you, again,
I'm not super familiar with YouTube,
but I think the idea is that only really dedicated people
will want to spend time with you in the membership streams
and they're the ones who watch all your streams
and know what you're about.
If kind of like anybody went into a membership stream
and they're kind of like, I don't know, like normie,
then they might like kind of be off put,
but like for example, like my tag stream,
a lot of people were thrown off by that.
And oh my God, no, it is still got missed, bro.
Thank you for the other.
Oh my God, what?
Thank you for the other 20 and another 20 by 30 to you, Paul.
Oh my God.
All right, here are my little PogChamp.
Shibi likes furries.
No, I don't.
Damn.
But I think, yeah, it basically makes it
so you do have to spend at least some money to attend.
Gifts still give you a nice discount.
Yeah, like you just pay the remainder.
But yeah.
Oh my God, why are you guys so nice today?
Thank you for the 10 gifts, what the hell, guys?
Oh, they're like really trying to help that bro out.
I want to see, did he get it?
Oh my God, he did it!
Bro, your settings must be off.
There can be no way.
There can be no way, you must have settings off
so you can't get this gifted.
Dodged.
Just a running gag.
There's always one person that just misses it.
Where's mine?
You have one, it's right there.
Oh, you guys are so nice.
You're like, let's get all green in here.
Or is a brand account?
That's a good point, it could be a brand account.
She be punishing me lovingly, thank you.
Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.
I think that's gonna be a bit now.
Sorry.
See, I'm punishing you lovingly.
That's loving, me punching you.
One day it'll work, what's a brand account?
I don't...
All right, round three.
Third time's a charm, thank you Paul.
I wanna see, I wanna see, is it gonna work?
Come on, speak.
The punches of love, oh no.
No, no, oh brother.
It's so shib over.
You probably only have to worry about the brand account thing
if your account is really old, that's a good point.
Okay guys, stop for real.
You gotta need to calm down.
Someone just paypal my bro like five bucks
and call it a day.
I'm getting soaked, oh.
Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.
No.
Oh my.
It doesn't end, okay.
You poor thing.
All right, chat, I'm taking you close to my chest.
I love you guys so much.
It's got you, your luck is just not good.
As I'm giving you a kiss, mwah, mwah.
Oh my god, okay.
Is this a game to you guys?
Oh my god.
Mwah.
Guys, guys, calm, the ward is, did he get it?
No, he still did.
Guys, this is, stop, stop, stop, stop.
The gacha needs to end, guys, stop.
Thank you, thank you.
On a gorilla stream.
Oh my god, thank you, hold on.
Let me say thank you.
Thank you, viewer lover.
Thank you, dragon and Dante.
And Dante, dragon and Dante.
Thank you, Paul, again.
Thank you, Joker.
Thank you, average amphibian.
You're not average.
You're great.
Thank you, Ken, at 30.
Oh my god.
You could be a lucky recipient
of a Shippee-Kan-Wambiola membership.
Oh my goodness.
Oh my god.
Thank you, Usmami.
Next one.
Next one, did he get it?
Did he, no, no.
No.
I think it's an ultra rare, apparently I'm not eligible.
Okay, that explains a lot then.
Oh no, oh guys, see that's why I told you to stop
because I'm like, there's probably something else going on.
That's preventing him from getting one.
He must have a brand account then.
Oh, it was rigged from the start, guys.
No, you tried.
Thank you for the gifted.
That's why I was like, stop, stop.
Oh.
But congrats to everybody else who got gifted stuff
and now you can have my emotes.
My other emotes should be done at some point very soon.
Oh, the brand account debuff is real.
Thank you again, Joker.
You guys are absurd.
I guess this is like, you guys paying me
for the silly script that I read for you.
I'll have to split these with Emmy.
I'll be like, throw some money at her.
Just be like, there's your cut.
Yeah, you'd have to make a whole new account.
I don't care if I'm actually not eligible.
Oh, but you should probably get that checked out, bro.
And you get access to member streams, yes.
And then I have an archive karaoke
and when I come back from my vacation,
from the 18th to the 23rd,
and then we have a watch along on Monday.
What's the day?
Today's Saturday.
I have to go to my parents' house tomorrow.
So I get a suitcase,
because I forgot I don't have a suitcase.
Ooh, I got a sub, but doesn't tell me from who.
Yeah, say, make sure you say thank you.
Say thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
You will be green in madam's presence.
I was like, next time drinking is right.
Like if you don't, yeah, they're just emotes.
If you want to get an actual, you have to upgrade.
Oh my God.
Sorry, it's your favorite character.
My cat's food going off.
The gray harlot is still valid.
You're still appreciated and loved.
You still show up to my streams.
I still appreciate you.
As well as the Lurkers.
But yeah, we did a really fun tag list.
We watched Sucker Punch the other day.
It was really fun.
Yeah, so it's only a couple bucks.
I feel like I'm like shilling myself.
Check out my Patreon in the description below.
Check out Emmys' Patreon in the description below.
We'll actually go to her.
I don't think I have her Patreon
or any of the other girls' Patreon.
Um, go to her channel.
Stop to her Patreon.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I was once a gray harlot too, long time ago.
You were like, they were gray like five minutes ago.
My cats are eating.
Alphia is eating.
Hi, Pia.
Raina is asleep.
Raina is knocked out on the chair.
Raina, are you good?
Raina.
Raina, what are you doing?
Oh, you're licking your paws.
Okay, sorry.
And Boomi is knocked out on the cat tree.
He has passed out.
My little handsome man.
All his paws are all together.
He's very cute.
Just checking you're still streaming longer.
I don't know.
I was just talking.
I guess I'll stream longer.
It's only the least I can do
after getting a bazillion freaking gifted.
So yeah.
Where's Yappin?
Where Yappin?
You remember dogs and lizards over cats or reptiles?
Do I redirect her to you?
Yes, mom, you can.
Strani, I definitely recommend that you watch this VOD,
by the way.
At least like the first like 30 minutes to an hour
or like go through it
because you'll laugh because of me
and Amy did something funny.
Amy was on my stream.
Oh, thank you for the gift and Mr. Black's silence.
I've gifted Mr. Black's silence.
26, whose name makes me crack up every time I see it.
Well, I leave for 10 minutes and so many gifted.
Yeah.
People were trying to hit this one dude
with a gifted membership, but he moans
and then I think he just doesn't, he's a brand account.
Oh my God.
Very silly.
Okay, where is,
I feel like I need to make myself a little bit bigger.
I'm a little bit far away.
Let me get up close and personal.
With y'all.
Hi, welcome to my room.
Yes, I wear a sign on my shirt because YouTube hates me.
You know what? It's coming off.
A limiter coming off.
Everybody gets to see.
I'm not ashamed of myself anymore.
I am here to stay.
Imagine if I was flat, Tristan.
That'd just be weird.
But what if the justice,
I forgot to put my ooo-oo mouth on.
Wait, where'd my track go?
I want to see what you guys are saying.
She be on these.
YouTube hates body positivity.
I know, imagine my video just like disappears.
Cutting bird.
Well, I could take them off.
Actually, let me see if I can do that.
I think I could take them off.
Can I take them off my boobs?
I feel like this is a bad idea for me to try,
just like I did when I accidentally was changing
my skin color on stream.
Let's not do that.
Let's not do that.
I would, so I wouldn't remove that.
Like I wouldn't, it just,
I would just make myself transparent.
They would just be transparent.
So you guys would be able to see through me.
Shawty, Mama Raid.
Hello.
I hope you have your giggle sticks ready.
Cause we're about to shlorp, shlorp.
I'm sorry.
Oh my God, my headphones are dying.
Hi, writers.
Hello, Raiders.
Welcome in.
I have no idea where you guys are up through this stream.
You'll laugh really hard, mom.
You'll laugh really hard, Shawty.
If you watched like the first hour of it,
or a little bit less.
Is this the R greeting session?
We might have read the first script
and heavily censored it because of how silly it was.
Herm.
Did she win?
Was she winning?
Was she winning, Riftlands?
Did she win Baltaro?
Baltaro?
Was she winning?
Strony equals Shibi's top?
What?
I don't know.
Honestly, I don't know the power dynamic
between me and Strony.
Oh my God, here we go again.
Thank you a third of the time he gifted.
Jesus Christ.
He did so great.
I'm glad.
Remember to like and subscribe.
Have all three flinks to support Shibi.
Oh yeah, like and subscribe.
Also send that love over to Amy
cause she was on over here as well.
Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe.
On any of our VODs and streams,
just like at Strony's.
I can't even talk because people won't stop gifting.
Guys, relax.
Thank you to X2Doki for the 10 gifted.
My God.
The gotcha must flow.
It's literally like just like pull
and hope that you win.
Oh my.
Thank you for the 20 gifted Paul, but yeah.
Oh my God.
I'm so good at dodging.
You're good at dodging too.
Everybody's dodging.
Everybody's taught like all my Lakers
are poking popping up like did I win?
Hopefully.
Guys, at this rate, I'm going to literally
have only greenies.
No harlot left behind.
Yeah, everybody should be able to use the emotes.
Oh, you guys are so sweet.
I'm pretty sure I can get gifted membership.
It's just my luck, I guess.
It is very, very odd.
You know what?
I honestly don't care about getting a membership.
I'm just happy to support a Vtuber I like watching.
I don't even need a Vtuber.
Whatever guys, I don't need a membership from you guys.
Whatever.
No, but you're right.
I still appreciate you even if your name is gray,
even if you're a Laker,
as long as you watch and support me and the girls,
that's all that really matters.
Thank you.
Thank you, Average and Phibian.
Is this going to be a stream of me just saying thank you
for all the gifted?
Thank you, Average and Phibian for the 10 gifted.
Believe me more.
Plop, plop, plop, good gifted, good gifted, good gifted.
Sundare Chat, Sundare Streamer, it works.
Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.
Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.
Maybe I just want to be plain.
If it is when I'm out of here,
what do you mean?
Where are you going?
Get the fuck back here.
You don't get to leave.
You thought you could leave.
You thought you could leave.
You don't get to go.
Oh, wait, guys, I've,
since there's a lot of you here.
Jay Santorillo.
Hey, welcome to the members, the members here.
Do you like my reverb?
Should we, should we start singing songs?
Hold on.
Where's my,
can I put on the cute and funny?
Hi, everybody.
It's me, British Stevie, once more.
Hello.
Thank you so much for all of the gifted subs.
You are also very sweet.
I appreciate you so much.
You've been reverbed.
Get reverbed, get reverbed, get reverbed.
As long as you don't start singing
the Darren Waller classic Cook On Shibs.
Oh, I'm Jeet Shibathani.
Hi, yes.
I'm Shibathani's British sister.
I'm not the older one that's in Britain.
I'm the younger one that's in Britain.
The older one sounds like this.
She talks like this.
Yeah.
Well, go on, Solar.
I never stopped working.
Let's see.
Let me think of a song to sing.
I need to put in my right headphones for this
because I'm using my different headphones.
I need to put in my IEMs for this.
Doing your shit, Britannia.
Oh, my God.
This fucking echo.
Echo, echo.
Sing me a song.
Wait, what's that song?
Let me take the echo down.
What's the viewer about?
Oh, Misty.
Whoa, my voice cracked.
How I just hurt my mouth.
It's like bumped my straw against my gum.
Ow.
Hi, Boomi.
Oh, thank you for that.
I was just a gifted because I'm so used to saying gifted.
The gifted, the gifted.
Boomi, why are you going in the box?
A viewer lover.
Thank you for the $5.
Dr. P, thank you for the 10 gift.
Guys.
You're absolutely fucking going bonkers right now.
How I'm the grafted.
Oh, my God.
It will never stop.
It's just going to be a constant stream.
Get spoiled.
Get spoiled.
God, I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve this.
Stop it.
Okay.
This song.
Hold on.
I need to look at the lyrics.
It goes out to Strawny.
I want to do this.
I want to, uh, I want to clap on this song with her.
I'm not going to put the music because then everything will just get claimed.
Oh, misty high up the mountain below.
Keep careful.
Watch off my brother's soul.
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke.
Keep watching over do more in the sun.
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together.
Watch the flames cry high into the night.
Calling out father home.
Stand by and we will watch the flames burn hot burn on the mountain side.
I can't sing that well.
I'm sorry.
Strawny did it.
Wait, I wasn't looking at my chat.
I was looking at the lyrics.
Did Strawny just give fire?
Why did you give fire?
Thank you, Strawny.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
I'm living in a freaking cry at this rate.
So you guys are too good to me.
Strawny, do you want to collab with me on this song?
I think we could do a really good job.
And then later she's like, that'll be coming out of your paycheck.
No kidding.
This really is a member song.
I can't sing.
RIP broke my vocal cords.
We can like throw some auto tune on it.
Honestly, I love your memer song.
I'm just a memer.
Oh my God.
Thank you, Mr. Black.
I love fire.
I imagine, because you mentioned when you get rated,
I'm like minus $25 for kids.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah, that doesn't mean you can't.
It doesn't mean you shouldn't.
Exactly.
I just love Ed Sheeran's voice in that.
Waiting for the one person to drop 50 gifted.
No.
Stop it.
Get your hand away from that freaking button.
She does have a good voice.
I don't know what she's talking about.
Stop it.
Get some help.
Okay.
I'm not going to sing the whole song.
That's a little test.
Don't tempt fate.
Are the gifted part of my allowance?
Yes.
Sing yellow.
Oh, I like yellow.
Yeah.
And it was all yellow.
Yellow.
But I can't play.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
It's a little bit too much.
I go more reverbs so I sound more ethical.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Okay, sorry.
Whoa.
Oh, I knocked something over my desk.
Look at the stars.
Look at the skies.
I'll put some autotune on and see if that helps me a little bit usually the autotune just actually makes my stuff worse

I am good at repairs and I'm under each snare, each tangible.
But you didn't think so.
I command you to panoramic you.
Look, I'll make it all manageable.
Pick and choose, sit and lose all your different crews.
Chicks and dudes who you think is really kicking tunes.
Picture you getting down in a picture tube.
Like you lift the fuse.
You think it's fictional, mystical, maybe.
Spiritual, hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy.
Lifeless, but to those who definition for life is priceless to you
because I put you on the hype shit you like it.
Done smoking righteous with one token.
Psychic among those possess you with one dose.
Breathe.
Useless, but not for long.
The future is coming on.
I ain't happy.
I'm feeling glad I got harem in a bag.
I'm useless, but not for long.
The future is coming on.

The essence, the basics.
Without it, you make it.
Allow me to make this childlike in nature rhythm.
You have it or you don't.
That's a fallacy.
I'm in them.
Every sprout and tree.
Every child piece.
Every cloud and sea.
You see with your eyes.
I see destruction and demise.
Corruption and disguise from this fucking enterprise.
I'm sucked into your lies.
We wrestle not as muscles, but percussion he provides for me as a guy.
Y'all can see me now because you don't see with your eye.
You perceive with your mind.
That's the inner.
So I'm a stick around with Russ and be a mentor.
That's a few rhymes.
So motherfuckers remember what the thought is.
I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless.
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead.
No squealing.
Remember that's all in your head.
I ain't happy.
I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.
I'm useless, but not for long.
My future is coming on.

too because we're all just gonna be you know actually i don't know don't don't don't take
anything i say because i don't know it is a watch along i don't we're not watching along is like
because when they announced it they announced this individually so maybe we all doing it we
are doing it all together i don't know you know i should have looked at the prompt that strawney
sent me like a good little gen mate um but i had a lot of fun today uh i'm generally floored by
all the support that you guys have given me um let me get rid of my microphone let me
untuck this from my bosom
time is racing towards us um thank you for pointing up with my my singing um i really want to definitely

using you as a guinea pig for makeup looks so i think that would be cute um i'll be honest with
you i'm a little stressed about my flight and like leaving and stuff and i'm very anxious and you
guys have been kind of really helping me get that anxiety off because i'll be flying by myself
and have a phone by myself in a very long time seeing my grandparents i'm gone from the 18th
through the 23rd i'll miss you guys so so so dearly i'll try to do um some sort of
like twitter space while i'm there maybe when my grandparents are out at like church or something
i can do they're at church and i'm just like hey guys welcome to the twitter space um but yeah
flying can be scary it's not i'm not worried about like flying it's like it's like moving
through an airport that i haven't been to in a very very long time um it's like it's all the
unknown like i know on a plane like i'm just on a plane that's fine i'm fine i'm fine flying but
like traveling by myself is scary especially as a girl um but yeah you guys over skipping bible
study for bible study being a makeup guinea pig is basically much okay so nothing will be changed
for you then yeah you know touching the bible when i'm gone by the way you cannot speak to the lord
you must you can't have any verses that stream will be really cathartic for me i've never had
anyone teach me how to do makeup growing up yeah hope everybody enjoys it i don't think you'll
actually get like actual makeup tips from me it's really just the triggers but yeah
i hope florida whatever yeah for the it's gonna be super hot i'm gonna die
make us like i'll make you so pretty yes ma'am during the twitter space what do you mean
no no we're not bible studying during the twitter space if you want to i will legit pull out the
bible that i probably have laying around and i will start reading you scripture do you think i'm
joking just like just to kill kill your bible i'll bring out my bible i hope i get to look as pretty
as you look of course you will i only wear like a little bit of eyeliner and i wear false eyelashes
and mascara as you can see my eyelashes are very long and i have very wonderful eyeliner and then
sometimes i like underline my eye you can kind of see it right on the side yeah i'm very minimalist
for makeup i should be you know you can't kill my bible messed up work for some of us that's too
bad i'm just doing my job you just got to do yours i don't know what's the problem
yes i overpower my bible with your bible i mean my bible with but i i'm tired

i didn't know you had debuted yet just saw the video came over easy subscribe oh
welcome yeah it seems like some people forgot that we debuted in June that's fine
they fill a niche but they're also amazing even when not playing into the roles exactly
exactly and then sometimes we play into each other's roles it's fun sometimes we just improv
like me and just say out totally crazy stuff oh my reina i have three cats and they like to
knock stuff over reina you're pulling out my headphones has already been three hours apparently
so um i also usually do endurance streams so like you might see the nice dream for like nine hours
of an elden ring because i love elden ring um and i also played elden ring for four hours and
formed and just improv the entire time he's telling you to stop before midnight it's 11 11
everybody make a wish my wish is that i hit 10k soon oh reina's purring and she's crawling into
my arms two hours of elden ring and seven hours of yapping oh yeah i also live hades i wanna play
hades when they come back it's 5 a.m here oh my god go to bed i wish for cats to be immortal me too
you also have elden ring no way
and sometimes i burp so i hope you don't mind i am now lady
the compilation of all your girls debuses hilarious i saw you shared it on twitter yeah
it's really awesome it's really funny we have we had so much fun with our debus we're all so nervous
we're like oh what if people don't like us but it's like i'm so thankful for the um
the type of reception that we've gotten it's really nice it's hotter with the purr sorry i
said my desk reina what's up mama come on she's like purring so hard on my shoulder
all right have a good night we get to hear burps and she's feeling i know sometimes
i used to give them out willy nilly but now i'm like you know what i'm too nice let me withhold
my burps because you know i'm running an establishment as madame of wonderland a
hotel that also doubles as a brothel don't tell anybody and i'm the madame of that establishment
uh it's only fair that a woman of my caliber upholds her professionalism while streaming to the masses
you know my favorite moment of view was when you had three heads on top of one in your chest
yeah be not afraid
so now we're kidding her reina makes you think of a gender swapped reign from the owl house
i never watched owl house as a kid
boomy king of umashu and he was another one of my cats he was in my desk with his paws crossed
like a gentleman i don't know where fia the deathbed companion who's my other cat her name is actually
fia the deathbed companion by the way because i love elden ring that much i think she's sleeping
under my bed boomy why are you just like laying his head in my hand
you're mad though because i touched his shoulder he only likes his head pat and now he's grooming
himself named us another cat d that would be so funny
what's a game that all the six dealer girls want to collab together one day well we wanted to do
power wash simulator but it didn't work out it like the for someone reason it just wasn't working
it like it would crash when there was four of us in there and you can have up to six people it was
really weird so i would like to play power wash simulator and i oh my god in the worst way i want
to play prop hunt and gary's mod i i have like over just like i have over 600 hours in counter
strike and i have over 600 hours in gary's mod because all i would do was play trouble in terraced
town in prop hunt and it was so great also uno yes i want to play uno i love if we had to play
like prop hunt with the you may plus girls or like with my thos it would be so funny so funny
so i'm trying to convince the girls to buy um very small it's only like five bucks or
i think might have been on five bucks for the steam sale but i think that's over so might be nine again
for ten
and i'm a i'm a prop hunt veteran so gonna go yes go to sleep go to sleep thank you so much
for your support and thank you for the song suggestions thank you gt you three different
youtuber agencies would be cool crazy it really would though it really would
you don't need counter strike source for some apps yeah that's true i forgot sometimes you
did desource for some of the maps nowadays i think you can just like download most of them out
mod packs oh my god i probably just do like the minecraft map one of my faves or office
i clocked seven forty five hours just messing with friends playing so they capture the classic
games you see plus mine so that strani would probably like thrive in that game she would i
think she would like it a lot i just i would love hearing her scream when she get discovered she'd
be like all right three flings i don't think they all fucking shit now they spotted me and then
she just fucking runs off i think it'd be so so funny
counter strike source is defensive or some random stuff but it happened or not that's
true honestly i'll buy it for everyone i literally i just don't give a shit be like here we go the
masses want gary's mod the masses will get gary's mod i can already hear mercy screaming whether
she's the hunter being hunted guys and then when she's chasing one of us to be like i can't do her
wait let me think of her laugh can't do her laugh that well
and then she'd laugh and like shoot us explode us
okay hey do do your part tell the other girls hey you guys should play this game because get
those suggestions out there if you watch the other girls and i hope you do give them their suggestions
tell them what's up i guess strani do impressions she does too many of them well
strani does really funny american accents i think i remember she was like trying to be southern
ones and i'm like what is this strani's rage heals my soul as well some scottish rage is a
different type of rage yes cool
you know we all get really goofy i think we really just like become our truest selves
in a collab especially the among us collab i can't get over how fun that was the among us
collab i want to do that again so bad i'm thinking of having some of my um friends on for the next
one like uh nori and chai chan it can be really fun
and then yeah emi and ic didn't get to do it last night last time
so i have a whole cute and funny and then there's me
i bet i could get like hexa and stuff
can't be funny some of the other hickenwashi girls
watch the clip of the among us collab in a sense of freaking funny yeah it was so funny
and it was well edited there was one i think that uh discount ostrich made he did like a really
meanie one that was really good shout out to discount ostrich he makes really good compilations
of us um and he did one of the among us collab and it was literally just so funny and then like
distrawni just like tricking all of us and like i knew i was on distrawni so many times when i
doubted myself because i'm like no she would never do that and then i was like why didn't i
listen to my gut i knew these people were the freaking uh imposters i would also like to do
like town of salem um i love you still love playing town of salem
and i feel like that would be kind of better because then we wouldn't have to move around
as much we could just like talk and just debate the entire time i think that'd be funny
i'm drunk hello mom are you behaving young man you can only drink at the house you know make sure
you're safe town of salem super dead oh no i know i haven't played that in a long time i've seen
like there's like among us adaptations of it so i think maybe that the company was absorbed or whatever
and then they started with just angrily shouting i remember someone accused her but switched it up
when you all caught on literally she was like i'll be quiet almost like something's up
all right i'm getting eepy i have a lot to do tomorrow i have to go
guys what are you i need to tell you something funny my um
yeah oh hi fia oh hi where have you been she's like very excitedly trying to jump over my lap
