1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Oh my gosh, hi, I like just woke up from a nap

3
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,920
Let me just hold on I'm like really in the middle

4
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Tee hee, how are you guys doing? Oh, I forgot I

5
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
I

6
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,400
Flipped myself. I need to flip myself off

7
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,720
No, they normally just bouncing around

8
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,800
You'll soon learn that my streams are just a constant wave of scuff. I don't

9
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Know what to tell you

10
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,260
Okay, doesn't really matter that much I suppose

11
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,000
How are you guys doing today? I was um took a little nappy. I feel good. I have some lemon odd

12
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Sipping on some lemon odd

13
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm

14
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,840
Everything I do is perfect you will learn that is far from the truth my dear

15
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,880
But I know

16
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,520
People have some

17
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,640
qualms with my sound so let's

18
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,760
If you don't mind and you don't because I'm telling you you're gonna help me

19
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
with my sound

20
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,080
With my microphone right now. I look great today

21
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,520
Brother in Christ. I look the same. I'm like a I'm a cartoon character

22
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
This is this I wake up

23
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,040
I'm in the same outfit. I open my closet. It's constant Shabari ropes in office wear

24
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,240
Okay, so let's let's let me pull up my

25
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,440
Maya Feltas I had some in my Maros go like they

26
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Gonna gave me a giggle

27
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,840
They're like wow you really offended me yesterday, and I'm like in my head like reading I'm like, oh

28
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,480
What did I do? Not that I give a shit, and it was like I can't believe you said, but oh whoa

29
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,900
Like that was the most terrible thing you could ever say to make fun of British people and it gave me a chuckle

30
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,120
How do we know you're not secretly an Android you don't I

31
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,840
Could be an Android you do not know, but why do I sound like um?

32
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,120
the robot from Power Rangers alpha

33
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,520
Okay, so I have a noise gate and I have a compressor and

34
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
I have some other filters here

35
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,740
But I feel like they tend to

36
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,000
Mess up my voice in terms of when I scream it

37
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,320
Kind of just blocks me out, so I took off the the noise suppression one

38
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Bit cringe in you, bro. Oh

39
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,200
Wait, what what days it today? Oh fuck. It's Monday. Damn it. I can't do the bit

40
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Do you pay on to be screaming a lot? I I was doing a lot of errands this morning because I lost my bank card because

Uh, so I was blasting

44
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Just like scream music

45
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Probably I was like, I probably shouldn't

46
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,880
Be singing right now so I can save my voice and I'm like fuck that

47
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,400

48
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,240
Dembo because I like a bit of Dembo to get me hype

49
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,680

Would you revive the queen if you could of course I would I the woman that woman

62
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,560
Practically raised me now. She didn't we knew we knew each other for a good amount of time

63
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
It was a good like

64
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,080
Like three or so years and we got super close in those years, but

65
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,320
Yeah, I'm still I'm still healing from those wounds

66
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,200
She is a she was a big part of my life

67
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
What color was the chowder?

68
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,120
White I don't it's it's fucking chowder. I don't

69
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
It was clam chowder

70
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
I was late. I'm sorry

71
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,320
Somebody flog him you can choose amongst yourselves who gets the privilege to beat that guy. So go ahead

72
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,160
Did you ever Dom Queen? I didn't Dom Queen so in my

73
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
early

74
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Adolescence that's fucked

75
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,640
In our early time together. I was very submissive. I actually you can even say I keep these ropes on as

76
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,560
That homage to her, you know

77
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,960
She did teach me about doming, but I didn't dom her I

78
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Did not dom her Lord dump

79
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,360
Um, it's crazy because I'm making this up for the spot. So I'm happy you guys are cool with that. I

80
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,480
Say we take turns at flogging. I agree with that not

81
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Not the blind cane

82
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Even with the blind cane

83
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Okay, um, so yeah

84
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
as I was saying

85
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,080
So I'm gonna fiddle around with my settings real quick. So

86
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,360
You can hear my fan because I have a fan for my phone for when I stream

87
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,540
So it doesn't overheat and then naturally my computer has a fan

88
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,800
So you might be hearing the fans and you might also be hearing my AC. Can we jump them?

89
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,680
Of course, you can jump them. Wait, did your beauty mark switch size? No, I'm mirrored and I can't un-mirror myself

90
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
It like won't let me

91
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,200
Flip myself for some reason like I'm trying desperately to flip

92
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,600
my

93
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
thinking it won't let me flip

94
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
If I flip vertical oh

95
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,800
I know why it's because I had it locked aren't I a silly goober?

96
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Hey

97
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Now my moles on the right side

But I'd like my legs, you know, I would just add some supple thighs

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Okay, anyway, sorry I'm getting distracted

So we're gonna do some membership streams where I learn how to tie myself up

129
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Pog okay, I

130

Thought she was gonna purr. I'm not gonna just do that. I

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,160
Haven't had anything yesterday

132
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,840
I had had seltzer water and when I also get super anxious and I also had something that upsets my tummy

133
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,760
So I was burping a lot, but you know, it's a normal bodily function. So I'm sorry. I'm not gonna mute

134
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Myself if I burp one I I don't have the speed to do so

135
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,800
I remember one time I went to mute for a two and I totally didn't make it in time

136
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,040
People were like, what was that? And I was like, wow my cat just

137
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,520
Totally ripped ass next to me. That was wild. Oh, wow

138
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,440

What were we doing again? Oh, yeah, we were helping my microphone issues

141
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay, so if I do the open threshold if I do this

142
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Well

143
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Well, I

See, I'm I supposed to it's an unconscious thing to do

147
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,160
Not much of a difference at all. Okay, cuz that was my open threshold. So I'm just gonna ooh

148
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
What about my clothes threshold? What if I?

149
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,840
Does that make a difference? I don't freaking know

152
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,520
Four out of ten, sorry, you know what I'll take them as I take them

153
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,640
My air conditioning is about to get gone. This will be helpful. Um

154
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,040
So my clothes threshold is that you can't tell. Oh my god, okay

155
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,560
I'll just put these but they were before so it could be my compressor

156
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
so

157
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
What if I

158
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
What if I do this

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,480
Isn't working so this is me with nothing on

160
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,880
And not in terms of clothes though that would be pretty crazy for YouTube

161
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,480
She be cotton bun ripped off her clothes on her third stream

162
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,160
I still hear the AC. Well, I just took off the filters. That's why

163
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,440
Your sound's going all over the place because yeah, I just it was better for a moment

164
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,160
Huh picture can't hear me

165
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160

What about now super quiet super quiet can't hear oh that was the current compressor

167

Crap

311
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
No, I looked at the viewer count

312
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
as I opened the tab

313
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
We were count jump scare

314
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,680
So that's you you look so again as

315
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,840
People may not know I didn't hot I did not design the mascot. I did not design she be I was hired on to play

316
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,000
Myself although I am who I am I was meant to be I was meant to be she be my entire life

317
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You know then week before I or

318
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah, like the week before I

319
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,760
Streamed like I did debut I saw rabbits every day outside my apartment never before I'm like the universe is telling me

320
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm meant to be a bunny girl, or I meant to be a playboy bunny which one um

321
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:06,080
But I the moment I saw this I was like this looks like like tuxedo mask or a persona character

322
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,920
And I like it a lot. I think it's cute

323
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,400
Use of the harem and you know what I was like I'm like, oh

324
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,680
You can change your hat

325
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,560
You can change the type of ropes you're wearing if you don't want to have a scarf on because I also like I

326
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,000
Know I do have female viewers you can feminize this you can do like a more feminine mask or like a

327
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,560
More feminine hat, so I just I want you to be able to you know

328
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,480
Mix and match, but that's that's you got you guys look a little mafia bosses. It's a rabbit Junkler for

329
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,920
I

330
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,840
Can't think about persona five. I've actually never played persona five don't come at me

331
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,160
so

332
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,600
But I was trying to think of like some sort of goofy little thing

333
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,240
She'd be representing the 3% female audience so out of curiosity

strongy and management is like worried about

362
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,640
Applying for monetization because like we definitely have it already

363
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,120
for me and Azura because we get we like ran ads on our shorts just to like to test stuff out and

364
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,880
YouTube took a cent from us, but didn't run the ads

365
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,160
Because of the boobs in the thumbnail bitch because of boobs in the thumbnail bitch

378
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,760
It's like I just don't know for the life of them. I just I can't do it right now. I haven't heard her today

379
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,200
I just can't for the life of me

380
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,840
Fathom why they wouldn't run ads and they took a cent and I'm like mom

383
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,640
Let's see, I'm gonna look over right there

384
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,600
So it looks like I'm saying your names above my head

385
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm not that see I'm not I was in chorus when I was younger and we had to

386
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,120
Sing what's it called? Um, we did a lot of Disney songs. So I know a lot of Disney songs

387
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,920
And we did under the sea in kiss to go

388
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,040
Yeah, you see her sitting here across the way

389
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,600
She don't got a lot to say but there's something about

390
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,080
Oh, I can hear myself what the hell gross oh

Oh my god, this is my favorite Titanic song. Oh, are you ready kids?

394
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,640
I can't hear you

395
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
It's probably not scream

396
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,280
The sound of the AC is the sound of the waves exactly you get it

397
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Hold on that's gonna so bother me that you guys can hear it though

398
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,120
Didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi

399
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,920
Is that better it's gonna suppress me in it and I'll I'll get cut out but

400
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
It's better, okay I

401
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,600
Just threw a noise suppression on but if I screw

402
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,080
It's not gonna it's not gonna be fun

403
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Just so you know

404
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,520
Just so you know I'm gonna cut out

405
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
What why are you laughing

406
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,320
Did it did it get like crunchy in the end? Yes, it suppressed as you said

407
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Can you try whispering

408
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,440
You can't hear me scream the cutout screams. I don't think this is a horror game

409
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
How about whimpering

410
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,320
Did it pick out up this first cutout oh look

411
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,600
Suppression level all right suppression level. What is that?

412
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
How about this how about this?

413
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,600
Wow, how would you be streamed today? Oh, but it was great

414
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,960
We just sat for 30 minutes and she talked about nothing and we distilled didn't help her fix her microphone

415
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Okay, but if I

416
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,720
Did it cut me off though did it cut me off

417
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,160
You can still hear me. Are you sure are you positive? No, you hear it. No

418
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,260
What the screams are fine. No. Yes. No, you guys are not helpful

419
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,000
No, no cutting off. Oh no cutting off

420
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,440
Okay, whatever the fuck. It's cool. We ball

421
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,640
The mic peaked. Okay, cool

422
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,880
But it's funny cuz my air conditioning shut off, so we'll never know if it actually worked. Okay

423
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Anyways

424
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,600
This is working. I haven't charged this controller in a bit

425
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:18,200
What word comes to mind when you think of the earth fucking sucks that word might be beautiful

426
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
No dog

427
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
or

428
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600

Hey, it's my word of the year I like to pick a word of the year

Where the crab vtubers at put your claws up

434
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,720
Can I get a ooo Connie in the chat? Oh

435
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,600
Well, that's not a sea turtle. He's just a turtle

436
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
I

437
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:19,040
Don't need this by the way. Oh, it's last year's word. It was um, I think it was patience after a member. What the hell

438
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,200
Please open up. Oh, I'm so cute

439
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200

They close this

443
00:38:52,640 --> 00:39:01,200
Oh crap the tack shark he's called a lone shark and he sounds like he's like Italian mafia. That's funny as hell

444
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
What are taxes me

445
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
This whole area

446
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:22,080
Commit tax evasion now I have to like get an accountant now. What's a V sucky? You don't need to know

447
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
So the lore is

448
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I evaded taxes

449
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You're somewhere

450
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
I oh

451
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Oh

452
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,360
On da da sea oh, there's a freaking bird there. Oh my god. I'm scared

453
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,600
Game is quiet. Can you turn it up? Is it? I have it pretty high

454
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,320
Oh

455
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,440
Wow was randomly super quiet. I don't know why

456
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
All right

457
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Quick poster on oh shit, you're right

458
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,720
I keep forgetting guys. I'm not

459
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,840
I'm not used to being a streamer. No, that's that's a fucking lie. I'm not used to

460
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,080
Like streaming on youtube has because I used to be a twitch streamer streaming on youtube is very

461
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,280
Very confusing and very annoying to set up

462
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,560
But it's the easiest thing to do in terms from v2 management. That's why there's a lot of v2 corpos on um

463
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
agencies on

464
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
YouTube because you can manage

465
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,920
No, I don't want to upgrade to premium. You can manage multiple accounts and payouts and all that jazz

466
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Can I please tweet?

467
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I

468
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Manager tweet for me

469
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Uh

470
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
There it is

471
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,720
The temptation to speak like live from new york is saturday night

472
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,480
I'm live link in thread

473
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,640
I've been streaming for

474
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
40 minutes

475
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,160
And forgot for gore to tweet again

476
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,480
I forget to do a lot of things I forget I forget to do a lot of things twitch sucks

477
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Ah

478
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,240
Twitch sucks. I know um, sorry I sing a lot

479
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
But I'm not a good singer

480
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,440
Uh, it's okay. I think just because I I'm it's what I'm used to okay. So heart kelp

481
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
heart kelp is

482
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,480
Is currency but also health question mark

483
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Hey, I know this isn't much but

484
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,800
What the shell is it wait, I don't forget what he sounded like

485
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,520
What that shell is this or he sounded like he was from joysie

486
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
They're help kelp heart kelp pods

487
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Don't tell me you don't even like heart kelp

488
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,400
I hope you're joking no one uses these dub things as money anymore

489
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,160
The oceans moved as the trash stand and now trash you got it

490
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,920
Trash so like no pearls either no shiny pirate coins

491
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
That's right. None of that crap

492
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,000
So you better find some bread clips or some sauce packets back there. I'm losing my darn patience

493
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,000
Look if if you just give me a couple more tides

494
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,000
All right. I've had enough say. Goodbye to your shallow idiot

495
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Wait, what?

496
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Oh crab

497
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840

498
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,160
Oh crap. Oh crap crap crap

499
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,400
Oh

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,840
Not my booty hole not my crab bussy being out

How's a shark is there like a shark?

507
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
It's tide pools

508
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
Who's controlling the shark?

And I'll tell you

515
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Running ninja style is very effective

Uh, I was one of the fastest girls in middle school. I'll have you know because I ran

517
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
ninja style

518

Not my problem. You want your shell back. You better get a job to pay up. I hear they're always hiring in the reef

527
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,520
Uh reef, isn't it super busy there? I don't want to talk to people

528
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,680
Again, not my problem. I don't care where you get the trash from but I'm keeping this until you do

529
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,160

All I want to do is I'm a zoom zoom zoom and a boom boom. Just shake your shell

540
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,800
Check baby check baby one two three. This is really pretty. This is a pretty game. I'm surprised my computer can run it. Oh

00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,160
Oh, okay, so I like I glide

542
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Well, I fucked that up. Okay

543
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,920
Nope, uh another thing you'll learn about me is I suck at platformers

544
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,960
Blight town or whatever the fuck it's called from um

545
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
From lives of

546
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,920
I keep I'm so used to lives of pee. I'm like pressing my joystick to run but that's not the case

547
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
Okay, all right

548
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Wait, can I

549
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,920
Oh frick yeah, okay

550
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,680
Oh, that's not what I meant to do. How do I pick up?

551
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,640
breadclaw

552
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
it's

553
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,880
It's one of those things you used to cook trip to fucking bread with he

554
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,440
Acknowledge knowledge. That's cute

555
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,360
Church section. Blight town be tasty. Blight town is dark souls. Oh, I know I remember

556
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Some people who've watched me before

557
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,880
It took me like six hours to beat that stupid

558
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,120
clown looking

559
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,160
Mini boss like it wasn't even a major boss mind you like the hardest boss in lives of pee. I beat no problem

560
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,960
like maybe like three tries but then

561
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,360
The fucking mini clown boss one where he like pushes a boulder at you

562
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,520
I

563
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,520
I had to I got mad. I raged. I closed my stream off

564
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,720
And then I had to um, oh, who's that? Let me just stand over here. He's probably an enemy

565
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,280
And then I had to

566
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,640
I was like, you know, fuck it. I'll beat it offline because I'm getting too frustrated. I don't think it's fun to watch someone rage too hard

567
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,480
um

568
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,000
and

569
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,760
I'm playing

570
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,480
Playing an hour passes. I still haven't beat him. I get so pissed. I spike my

571
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,680
I'm wearing razor black shark headphones. I spike them and they just shatter

572
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,920
So I have little chunks taken out of my headphones where the plastic is

573
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,200
Beat it off line versus beat it beat it off live versus beat it offline

574
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,920
for a rage to whining

575
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
The mother of a clown man. I feel it. What?

576
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,240
Tree get woke. Yeah, you know, I got my moments

577
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh

578
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh, yeah, I'm like spiked

579
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,480
Keyboards I've I pulled some Tyler ones. I've spiked. Uh, what's it called?

580
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,560
Um controllers

581
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,080
I like I remember I smashed my xbox controller at one point everyone was playing them

582
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,600
Work work work work work. That's what I'm trying to not do. That's why I got to catch up with

583
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
worthless

584
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,960
Holy crap. What's wrong with your eyes? I haven't been sleeping or oh god get the way for me

585
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,520
I'm not gonna fight you. Oh, there's so fucking many of them

586
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,680
Oh

587
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,760
Climb climb ha ha you bitches can't climb can you you?

588
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh wait, you kind of can uh, no, you're just big

589
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,960
All right, I hope I don't miss anything back there if I did

590
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:34,160
She's a rager. It's funny. I used to not be rager until I started playing souls like games

591
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,360
But I like the rage from a souls like game. Although, you know, I would rage when I played like cotton stuff

592
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,480
Or like counter strike. Oh, I was so toxic when I played counter strike

593
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
I was bad

594
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,920
I was one of those bitches in the lobby that would try to talk like a little boy

595
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,200
So people wouldn't be like is that a girl? Huh going to kitchen

596
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,480
Ooh

597
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,480
Is this my weapon?

598
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,080
I guess I couldn't hurt to have a way to defend myself

599
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,360
This thing's here. I can't talk

600
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,200
If anyone else attacks me, I guess I'll poke him with the pokey bit

601
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,840
Might as well give this bad boy a few practice swings

602
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Found a rusty fork

603
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,240
That suspiciously sounds like the call of the lamb

604
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
Thing when you

605
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,840
Like upgrade something attack charge attack

606
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
Oh, okay

607
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,680
And this is block. I wonder if I can parry

608
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,920
Please rage on us if you insist. I stopped playing multi games because I raged so much I wasn't able to sleep

609
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,760
Black ops 6 looks actually good. Yeah me and strawnee and a zero are like do we cop? Do we cop and we play?

610
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,000
Because like come on imagine me and azura and strawnee playing

611
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
That that'd be funny as fuck

612
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,080
How do I

613
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,080
Can I

614
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
Uh, I don't maybe I loop around

615
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,320
R3 to focus on enemies

616
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
All right

617
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,640
No, I'm pressing the wrong thing. Oh

618
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,880
Uh now how do I heal? Okay

619
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,280
Sounds like content

620
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,240
Going for fours of six and ever I play like a little bit of fours of an xbox grown up

621
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,240
I

622
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,800
Boy at hands if you play this kind of games or all the same level of skill in your line for a lot of fun. I

623
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,840
Used to I remember I got like

624
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
one of my

625
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,720
I play a lot of uh the

626
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,200
Battle royale, whatever the Frick version. Um

627
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,080
Of like the latest caught or like

628
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
Whatever and

629
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
I got like a golden

630
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,360
Gale like two days because there's no life to fuck out of it

631
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,440
I keep pressing trigger instead of r1

632
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,280
She may congratulate debut

633
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Hold on

634
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Hello sweet rain

635
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,640
Hope you're doing well

636
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,600
You may plus love

637
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,360
Warzone yes, thank you. Uh, yeah, I know life's warzone

638
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,840
I used to play fortnight, but I was just shit at building like my my my baby cousins. They're like, um

639
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,960
14 and 10 now they

640
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
smoke me in fortnight

641
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,640
And it's hilarious

642
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
Like like this like little 10 year old boy

643
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:15,200
Like I'm like, is there I'm telling my aunt. I'm like, can you put these kids like one of those like esport colleges?

644
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,200
Like this is ridiculous

645
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:26,320
I remember when I first started streaming in general. I used to be a fleshy. Um, I wanted to go pro and

646
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,800
Counter strike real bad

647
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,560
Because I was like, oh, I'd be sick to be like a female pro counter strike player

648
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,640
But I was not good enough

649
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,800
That's for sure. What is this? Can I hit it? Why is this pretty sick looking?

650
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,320
All right, no explanation for that. That's cool. Nice

651
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,800
Yeah, I know like they're like I'm doing 90s. Um, blah, blah, blah

652
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,600
I liked I played a lot of fortnight when it first came out and people didn't get the meta yet

653
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,920
About how building is super freaking helpful and they would just build

654
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,760
Pathetically, no, it's great. I miss those days

655
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,560
Whoa, what is that thing?

656
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,120
The current starts getting warm close to this platform. It's kind of comfy. I like I'm skipping every other word

657
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
Maybe I caress my feet here. He isn't

658
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,920
So you have feet

659
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,280
for a little while

660
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,440
Where are oh he has like

661
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
feet and then he has

662
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Excuse me

663
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,720
He has a little feet that I guess he just doesn't use and then he has

664
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,120
Like one of them is like more raised. What's what's up with that?

665
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,760
Is that one like higher than this one? And then I have my little booty tail that

666
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,840
Hermit crabs used to like hold onto their shell. How many

667
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,240
Legs do crabs have? I don't know. I eat them, but I don't know

668
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,160
Oh

669
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,560
Oh moonshow

Cave of respite, I like the damn this game is so beautifully like it's just so aesthetically pleasing to me

672
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Poppers and moonshows and my classic

673
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,680
Okay

674
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,680

678
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:00,640
Is anybody am I gonna get like a explanation for like the lore of the moonshell?

679
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,760
No, all right

680
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,160
I don't know where I came from. You'll also learn that what the fuck is that?

681
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,000
Oh, it's him. I don't know why it looked like a bird to me. Um

682
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,000
And I'm I have a terrible sense of direction. I get turned around a lot

683
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
Too many legs six spiders in the sea

684
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
I

685
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,920
There's a dark souls mode and the options

686
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,520
I don't know that

687
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
You're lying. You gotta be lying

688
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
shibuti

689
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000

Go clean your room. I can't believe you got a b on your homework instead of an a

691
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Mommy face attacks are perfect for Zara

692
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,560
Uh, I want to watch a Zara game. She's a great gamer. She kicked everybody's asses in uh among us

693
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,440
although

694
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
I kicked ass

695
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,720

696
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,320
Quiplash like one time I forget who won the most was a mercy that one more or was there Zara again

697
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
Who's the funniest?

698
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,600
Come on, man, there's gotta be something I can do

699
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:19,680
Yeah, now that you mentioned it, I can think of something drop your pants. Just kidding. You're not weighing any pants

700
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,080
You can lick my freaking ventral fins and stop bothering me

701
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,480
Lay the kid you can suck my two-headed cock

702
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,440

I was like so I watched everybody's two point os

705
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,880
And I just love listening to his airs voice and I was falling asleep listening to mercy because mercy also suits me

706
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
The fuck is this music

707
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,600
Ayo, is that my mouth? Oh, it's my heart inside my chest

708
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,320
Huh, it's very interesting that that's there. That's the asset

709
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't say your type leaving the type pool too often

710
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,080
Yeah, well, I didn't have a choice. Can you tell me what's going on here?

711
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,400
I heard like there's a duchess in charge now

712
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:19,520
Yep, sure is real piece of work takes all my hard-earned micro plastics every tie just for existing around here

713
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:26,000
What do I see for it? Nothing just keeps building up her castle and hiring more soldiers to defend it

714
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,480
Oh, that's cool. Where can I find her? I think she has something in mind

715
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,960
So that's when I thought you're getting brand new models the day after debut

716
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,520
Why?

717
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,520
Why would you think that?

718
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,680
That's not gonna happen

719
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,720
Mommy put so much time and offered her money into these models. Oh my god. You guys don't even know the half of it

720
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,920
Kind of freeloader area, but you think you skirt your taxes while the rest of us keeps the side together, do you?

721
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,920
You just said

722
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,760
You hermit crabs are all the same wearing the shells the rest of us worked so hard to create with our own mantles

723
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,520
That's a good point. You gotta stayed in your tide pool small fry

724
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,440
Yeah, well how's about something I do something to you

725
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,120

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,240
Siegel breeze season

729
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Okay

00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,320
Killed him forked him fork you

731
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,160
You tell me I can't wear that on my butt

732
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,560
I could totally fit that on my ass

733
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,560
Like I know my ass is fat, but like I could totally slide that I can totally like, you know

734
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,800
Stretch them out stretch you out

735
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,680

737
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,600
Oh, no, fuck you. I don't want to talk to you right now. Can you come up here? Oh, you can't

738
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,280
Okay, um

739
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:28,880
Wait, is that like a lure can I like there's plenty of plastics here. There's plenty of trash. Can I grab this?

740
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,080
I'll make my own micro plastics. Oh, this is really sad though

741
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,040
It was probably what the ocean. Oh looks like

742
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,880
I know I should be focusing on them, but I don't really care what that

743
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,880
Oh sick

744
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,960
Off to see the wizard

745
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,720
I'm wondering if there's anything off to the side. What's that?

746
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,720
Is that a shell?

747
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,840
Oh

748
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,840
No, it's just some weird party popper shit

749
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,600
Damn, this isn't big. Can I like go off the beaten track because I'm guessing that little

750
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,960
Little road the little micro plastic brick road is a um

751
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,840
It's like the main quest, but

752
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,240
I gotta what is this called

753
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,560

01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,960
Bicolas sort of a big lighter

Have a fun so far. Uh, I just started

756
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,720

Okay, oh

01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,960
Oh shit, I should probably run

01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,840
What the

764
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,240
They're just doing absolute bangers

765
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,920
Yo, I need to get up and twerk. What is this?

766
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,680
Oh, oh, I went away. Fuck. I was about to get up. That's our cheek in my ass

767
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,600
Oh

Anyways

769
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,640
This game is cooler than I expected

770
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,680
I've seen like a little bit of gameplay from this

771
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,040
No, like spoiler. Oh, can I stick my mouth on that?

772
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,400
They're shiny so it means I can interact with them, right?

773
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,160
Just like uh from my spongebob. Oh, what's up there?

774
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,160
Oh

775
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,960
I should be able to platform up there. I just don't know how

776
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,280
If I

777
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,840
Maybe if I we're running start

778
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,400
Nope because I'm like, okay. What if I get up there

779
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:07,120
And then jump over there, but I don't think so. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother

780
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,840
Oh

Why did the crab cross the road?

782
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,960

Spherulin my blood star easily

Okay

789
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,920
They won't notice me

790
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,960
Oh, I like how it kind of shimmies side to side like a crab

791
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,200
Can I am I dead? Oh shit

Put that up there, you know, I need to put these bitties on display, you know

Frick I'm not paying attention

806
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,240
Of dark souls that I learned the hard way is that you don't have to fight everyone again

807
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,760
I would go through and I would just try to fight people

808
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,840
And I'm like, oh wait

809
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:51,040
I can just run past you and come back to this later if I really need to talk to you or do this

810
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,680
thingy

811
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,840

Telling you music is good

816
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,880
I'm assuming I drop stuff. I think they did say that

817
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,880
Yeah, it's over there. I don't know why I press that but go off says

818
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,360

Why are you down there? Come on

825
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,320
I don't have to take on both of you at the same time. It's too much work

826
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:09,840
Do you have more? Oh, I wasn't locked on. Oh, I didn't even mean to

827
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,400

Check out laughs. Have you beat dark souls one play about that? No

830
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,960

I remember I played Sekiro and I'm like wow. Sekiro was the first um

Souls like I played I didn't even know it was a souls like I just was like, oh this game is getting a lot of hype

Was severely mistaken

836
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,320
What the fuck?

837
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,360
Are you why are you flying away? Oh god

01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,640
Why can't I pick it up? I'm clicking try

840
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,400
Is this a joke? Oh wait, it's because

841
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,600
I

842
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,160
Mentioned I'm blonde

843
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,680
She be shut up

844
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,600
How can you

845
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,360
Oh fuck

846
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
I

847
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,240
Why do they cry like a puppy? Uh, I think I'm good. I don't know what that is. Is it a bird claw?

848
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,000
Is this the right way? I feel like it's barp talk ramping along distance

849
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:06,560
Oh, okay, cool beans. I think I keep going this way

850
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Gotta go to the bonfire over here

851
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:17,040
You know blonde emo well, there is an emo of me going do so

852
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:29,520
I still don't think I have enough micro plastics or whatever the fuck to upgrade

853
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
Yeah

854
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
All right

855
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,440
Hey brother

856
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,760
Oh

857
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,160
That's all give me your fucking money

858
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,280
Oh, there's two in nature. Let's get that's my emmy impression

859
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:04,160
Just kidding. No, I actually I think if I'd really tried I want to do a stream where I try to do impressions of the girls

860
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,560
I

861
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,680
Think I could do icy's voice. I think I could do emmy's voice

862
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,720
I can't do strongy's voice because I can't get her accent down. I can kind of do Azura's voice

863
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,400
But

864
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,920
Mercy mercy is actually also kind of hard to do I really think about it

865
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,520
I realize if a girl's voice is like higher pitched. I can usually do it easier

866
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:41,520
I'm just going crazy and

867
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,040
Just talking to myself back ruffians back. I say

868
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,200
You there. I don't suppose you lend a claw to a fellow in need

869
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
I dare say I'd die for sure if you don't

870
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,680
Doesn't respond

871
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,760
um

872
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,760
Yeah, I'll kill them. Okay

873
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,240
I need them to come at me one at a time

874
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,960
Who's is don't fucking run away one of you guys come at me

875
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,760
Please

876
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,480
Oh

877
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:35,040
Is there no limited amount of times I can do that? Okay. No, there isn't it seems like I don't have like some sort of stamina, which is nice

878
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:45,680
Oh, you can dodge sweetie. Oh, so can I oh, oh you think you're so cool mean well you are

879
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,120
Oh fuck your mother

880
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,240
Oh

881
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,760
Why can you dodge stop it

882
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,800
Fine swordsmanship my boy. I dare say these ruffians ruffians

883

Not tomorrow today

884
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:18,800
These ruffians have become bolder and bolder as of late. Well, that's just life on the frontier. How exciting

885
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,320
Why not move away if it's so dangerous

886
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,880
Can't get off this prime land the justice offered me no way moray

Ah the simple insights of country folk this really is the life

01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:54,000
You deserve something for saving my carapace's country boy. Surely this could be of use. Good luck with your country travels

892
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,360
Sure

01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,160
Get that thing over there. Oh jump scare

894
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,680
Hope I can like level this thing up or I wonder what other sort of weapons I can get

895
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,960
Oh, you see that broke the game. Let's get I know I did it

896
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,520
Okay, let's go back to where we oh there's one right next to me. I didn't even notice that

Not tomorrow now. Oh fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me. Oh

913
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,940
Oh

914
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,540
Where is it

915
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:38,700
No, I like how they like growl a little bit

916
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,340
Oh, you're telling me I can't jump up here

917
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,980
At least I can kind of like swim past them

918
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,660
Doobie doobie dooba

919
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:09,180
I I do wish I had some sort of

920
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,340
Like

921
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,980
Actually, no, I'm not gonna say that because I actually loved Elden Ring because of how open world it was

922
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,740
I feel like I'm close. I'm just gonna go around

923
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,980
Can I like

924
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:32,060
Plastic I can't I cut fuck you stop pumping my backside Jesus

01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,940
Either ninja run or Ed's run

926
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:43,020
Me money. Yeah, no stamina bar is a good thing. What is that?

927
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,580
Hello

928
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:53,820
Why you got a fucking comb he's about to give me he's about to get the capsis the fade

929
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,260
Oh did not dodge in time

930
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:04,060
What the fuck was that? I'm like I'm crying. I just noticed I'm crab crawling

931
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:10,700
Oh, oh shit, okay, that's a two hit kill. That's good to know

932
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,020
Oh

933
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:24,140
Did I slice the glass bottle in half? Well, yes, I did. All right, uh, at least I know that I go this way

934
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,340
Oh, oh, okay, this must be the duchy

935
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:43,900
Okay, so let me just oh god a moment. I need to go get my stuff

936
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:51,100
So, yeah, this is like the path that I'm supposed to take of cigarette butts loveliness

937
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,420
I've asked you

938
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
Oh

939
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:16,620
Nope not this way oh for the love of god, where am I?

940
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:23,420
I want you to squeeze me while I'm on my period and call me your little catch-up packet

941
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:31,180
Call me your little fruit gusher. What a yo

942
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,140
Huh um base

943
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:49,180
Gushy-ushy someone sent in my marrow something

944
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,900
They said shabussy

945
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:02,140
And it gave me a good laugh, so thank you really I'm sorry for what I'm about to say and then they just said shabussy

946
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,380
What okay, what was that like in the wall?

947
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,220
Should I fight him should I fight him guys

948
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:23,500
My hands are sweating. Let me just wipe a mama titties

949
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:33,340
Shabby woody, I don't know what I'm talking about half the time do it for the plastic kill. Okay

950
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,500
We'll creep up

951
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,060
Oh

952
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,300
Shit, uh

953
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:05,500
I'm stuck. Oh god. What the fuck?

954
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,980
He needed me

955
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,980
He

956
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:19,180
Slam me against a wall. Okay. Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna fight him right now. I'm just gonna try to progress

957
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:24,220
It's kind of like the thing like you know you got to pick and choose your battles. It's okay

958
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,540
I don't

959
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:34,540
Like I definitely could beat him, but like I just hate running all the way back to get my shit and it's just annoying

960
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,100
I

961
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,580
Would just take a couple of tries

962
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,900
Folded me like a steel chair. I

963
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:45,660
Admit that is true. Well, there's one of those things up top there

964
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,860
Then I can level up anyways

965
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,060
Hello Krabos

966
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:11,260
All right, oh fuck you saw me

967
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,900
Okay, he didn't see me

968
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,740
But oh, I hate the crabs

969
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,780
It'll wait on later exactly run

970
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:30,700
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I'm guessing those are sea urchins and they would hurt me so

971
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,660
It's not fuck with those things

972
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,900
Do you want to like farm a little bit?

973
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,260
All right

974
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:50,380
I just like don't like I want to see if I can parry but I'm I also just don't want to waste health

975
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,620
Yeah, like uh

976
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,180
Like one hit just fucks me so

977
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,500
Yeah, can I

978
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,460
Yeah, I have to figure out the timing

979
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,900
Come on

980
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,700
No, see I feel like I timed that right

981
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,540
All right, I give up

982
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,380
Da-da-da-da-da

983
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
He shelled a pair oh

984
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:28,140
Look at me. I'm like trying to fucking parry and it's not an ability I have yet

985
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,860
What the hell

986
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,460
Why are you rolling up on me like that, bro?

987
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,260
Insha'Allah

988
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:46,700
All right, I'm guessing I can find a show with these guys or with the duchy

989
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,060
Yo, yo, yo

990
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,980
Halt trespasser

991
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:57,740
By order of the duchess all suspicious characters are to be bored from slack tight

992
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,700
Suspicious

993
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,420
I forgot the voice of them

994
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:08,540
Suspicious, I thought I looked pretty harmless downright adorable. Huggable even

995
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:15,100
Perhaps you speak of truth vagrants, but I shalt ne'er grant you entry twix these mighty gates

996
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,860
Whilst thy loins remained unguarded

997
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,660
Ex shucking excuse me

998
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,300
Dude take a hint she says you're naked

999
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,340
Oh, yeah, I guess I hadn't thought about that. Is that important these days?

1000
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:33,900
I feel like society has really moved on without me while I've been practicing self-care

1001
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,940
Sure seems like it

1002
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,300
The duchess would have our heads if we let you in wearing nothing but a rag

1003
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,500
Fret not little crustacean

1004
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:47,580
nearby to the east layeth a repository laden with complimentary commentary

1005
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:53,340
Face the gate you turn right you'll find a cherry center where you get something to wear

1006
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,580
Captain is stationed right there now. I think great guy. He'll get you sorted

1007
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,540
Sounds cool. Let me in

1008
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:06,540
Assuming nothing sketchy comes up in your background checks. Sure. Just how the fuck are you gonna run a background check on me?

1009
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:12,780
Okay, so I must be past the berserker crap then my hands just went

1010
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,540
I have to get drip

1011
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,540
I

1012
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,740
Can't climb up stuff. Oh

1013
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,620
Oh, how convenient what am I doing?

1014
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,580
I like I stick in my little pocket

1015
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,220
All right

1016
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,500
I see a blinking thing over there

1017
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,860
But I felt like I saw something behind it hold on

1018
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:59,020
Hello

1019
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,700
Are you fucking dead?

1020
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:09,260
Wake the fuck up. What do you have an egg on your head? Do you have a ramen? What's happening?

1021
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,780
Oh, I can't go past. Oh

1022
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,820
All right

1023
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,900
Durer show

1024
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:21,180
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just I still want to explore a little bit

1025
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:29,020
You like her because she's dead. Oh, are these guys dead?

1026
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,100
You know, you're in what you're into but I think that's breaking a law

1027
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:41,020
Oh, no, I forgot to check on the last popsicle sticks that I saw back near the moon shell

1028
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,940
Did you hear about the crab that went to the gym?

1029
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,780
He pulled a muscle

1030
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:03,580
What's she guys doing can I hang out with y'all? Oh, his legs are uh, you know, it's a good time. What this?

1031
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,380
Captain there's a captain not around

1032
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,700
Oh

1033
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,940
Oh, it's like a it's like a little lobster neck tie thing

1034
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:31,260
Oh the son of music. Oh, why are these?

1035
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:36,380
I generally can't tell if they're dead or they're just tied to poles

1036
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,340
I thought that was the shark dude for a second, but it's just a broom

1037
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:45,500
And that is a gas thing. That's nice

1038
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,220
And there's fishies

1039
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,700
Uh

1040
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:55,820
Excuse me. Why do you have a ravioli head and the other one had a ramen head?

1041
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,460
Oh sick nasty brother

1042
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,740
Do-do-do-do

1043
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,380
Oh, are they all the same?

1044
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,060
Yeah, seems like it. Okay. I like

1045
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,620
this one

1046
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,620
Oh

1047
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,620
I can do the can can

1048
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:26,780
Wait, that wasn't it. Oh, I accidentally took a screenshot

1049
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:39,980
I'm gonna keep my little my little face on my little my little a real mouth. I think my a real mouth is very fitting

1050
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:47,020
This shell chafes like heck compared to my what the hell

1051
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:52,460
Found a weird it's got a can of my booty press old l1

1052
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:03,980
So is that the parry because you said once I get a shell

1053
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,620
Okay

1054
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:15,180
Sick

1055
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
Excuse me

1056
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:36,700
What did you say you're so far away I can't

1057
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,660
Hear you cross the ocean

1058
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,940
Should be can bum

1059
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:57,260
The voice actor went so hard I love it

1060
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:04,220
Okay, I'm assuming. Okay. I got like chug jug energy in the bottom. So holy shit. Oh, okay

1061
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,700
Uh, all right treason. Oh, let's go

1062
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:13,980
All right, what else you got? All right

1063
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:23,980
Oh, I pressed the wrong thing. Oh, I pressed it l2 instead of l1

1064
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,260
There's a moon jelly location

1065
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:32,220
What the fuck

1066
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,180
Huh

1067
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,820
Is that like the america thing

1068
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:44,700
Gianni

1069
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:48,460
Mattagrano stays America. No, it's his market

1070
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,900
It's leaving with the fishes

1071
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,500
Oh, let me stretch my leggies

1072
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,740
Oh

1073
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:04,460
No, no, I have a strap have a strap. So I'll bring him closer to me so I can jump between the cans

1074
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,140
And I usually I like let the

1075
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:17,100
Okay, can I like skip it? Um, although he's an amazing voice actor, but

1076
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:22,300
Wait, where is he coming from? Oh, uh, I usually like to see what their move set is

1077
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:29,980
But I kind of he just swings his thing and then also side dashes and he probably does a charge too. I'm guessing

1078
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,060
Yeah, that's a charge

1079
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,780
See oh, all right

1080
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:55,020
Um

1081
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,540
Well

1082
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,860
Listen, I'm just

1083
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,860
I'm just figuring out the game

1084
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,860
so

1085
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:08,860
Can you be nice to me?

1086
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,980
Okay

1087
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:16,140
Okay

1088
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,140
Third time's the charm let's fucking do this

1089
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:23,020
Oh, all right

1090
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:28,140
Palms are sweaty there's vomit on his sweater already mom's canned spaghetti

1091
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:35,500
I wish after like the third time this happens he would just stop

1092
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:38,380
all right

1093
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,380
Come on. Come on. Come on

1094
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:52,620

01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,060
Oh shit

1096
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,060
Oh

1097
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,300
Damn

1098
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:28,380
And I literally can't leave this fucking area until I beat him. Okay. Yeah, he is big range

1099
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,300
We're learning

1100
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,940
Hey, I never said I was good at games. All right, so

1101
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,780
Take that with what you will

1102
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,900
Body

1103
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:51,820
It's kind of jarring to hear milf is an uwu voice. Well, we're gonna hear it all today, right?

1104
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,700
I've been told I have like a big sister sounding voice

1105
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,980
It's only when I get really deep and I talk in my

1106
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,260
patreon audio recording voice

1107
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,860
Then I sound like a mommy

1108
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,500
What the fuck I went in my shell the timing is hard

1109
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,700
I did it again

1110
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,260
Okay

1111
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,580
Can I switch? Okay

1112
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:44,140
Oh he can donkey kick. All right

1113
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,460
Oh

1114
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,260
I should probably lock on to him

1115
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,540
Sorry, I go I go non-verbal when I'm focused

1116
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:20,380
Oh we fucking donkey kicked me

1117
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:29,180
Shit fuck that up

1118
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:34,220
Oh fuck me brother

1119
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:39,020
Oh, I can like roll away

1120
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,740
Oh

1121
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,620
Can you believe the range on that?

1122
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:52,140
I would advise against sucking justice out of his book. What?

1123
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,420
Why have you done it? Are you serious from experience?

1124
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:03,260
My image of playing you shooting me a pro CS player is quickly falling apart

1125
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,620
No, I never said I said I wanted to go pro

1126
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,580
I never said I was pro

1127
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,380
Okay, hold on and you get some drink

1128
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:22,860
She please I can't give you money. There's a seller restriction on stream elements. What?

1129
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,820
Huh, I don't know what that means

1130
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:34,540
Wait, have you guys been trying to donate this entire time from stream element?

1131

I'll take a peek at that real quick before I go get some water. Thank you though. Thank you for supporting

1132
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:55,180
Yeah, because sometimes the donations don't go through. Oh, yeah people tipped

01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,940
I can't tell

1135
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:05,820
Whoever tipped thanks for thanks for just the tip. Well, I sound like a zero

1136
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:17,020
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what's up with that or if you're making a joke. I don't know. Yeah, it doesn't work

1137
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:23,980
There has been a problem with PayPal getting suspicious of the transactions. Yep. We got too many donors earlier

1138
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:29,020
PayPal mark the account is sus. Gotta call this a fortune. Okay. Thank you. My next son

1177
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:09,980
The design for this they initially had my hands backwards like

1178
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,620
My like my thumbs were

1179
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:14,540
Facing forward

1180
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,220
So I had to send a picture

1181
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:21,260
I sent a picture to scrawny of my hands like in this position that you see now and i'm like

Draw them like this tell the artist from ooloo market to draw them like this

1183
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,260
So i'm just like pretending to be tied up with my hands above my head

1184
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,620
So yeah, it's pretty sick

1185
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:36,780
I love it. Awesome

1186
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,500

1205
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,780

01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:17,980
My burrito broke and I have to get another one

1209
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,220
Oh

1210
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:33,100
Literally a cat girl

1211
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:38,860
Yeah, I don't know why the price has come up like that for some of the items

1212
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:43,420
It's really weird because I saw that for mine at 1.2. So I think it's some weird sight thing

1213
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,300
It's a bussy hitting right just right

1214
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,940
Fia my beloved

1215
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,060
Yeah, Fia Fia's Fia's been through a lot

1216
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:57,580
Um at one point

1217
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,860
She had uh recently back in like march

1218
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:04,060
She had some um weird thing going on where

1219
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:07,580
Her legs didn't work at all. She couldn't move

1220
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:12,700
Uh, they still don't know what caused it. They gave her they didn't know if she had some sort of

1221
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:18,060
That she snapped her Achilles tendons. They didn't know if she had some spinal issues. We ran so many tests

1222
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:21,260
They're like, oh, she has like the wobble syndrome and they're like

1223
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:27,980
Then she didn't end up having the wobble syndrome or where you can't like cats can't move properly neurologically

1224
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,380
um

1225
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,900
and

1226
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:37,260
Then another random like and like so many vets so many doctors were like

1227
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:43,420
What but like they were they had never seen a case like this because like they ran so many tests on her

1228
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:46,140
and my credit card is

1229
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,220
Still crying

1230
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:53,660
Because of that, but I will do anything for her. Um, why is the chat so weird? There we go

1231
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:56,940
and um

1232
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:03,260
And then they some random doctor was like, maybe it's toxoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis is like it's a

1233
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:11,340
It's a bacteria or a virus you can get from like usually like pregnant women get it when they like scoop a cat's litter box

1234
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:14,140
Which doesn't make sense to me. Um

1235
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,500
But she

1236
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:24,300
Or if you like eat raw meat, it's like the cat equivalent for like salmonella and um

1237
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:30,140
My cat had that when she had an infection on the bone's intertail. Oh snap. Wow. I hope your cat's okay now

1238
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:31,740
um

1239
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:36,140
And so they're like to give her some antibiotics and so they did

1240
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:38,540
And it worked

1241
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:40,540
And she can walk and it's great

1242
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:45,580
It's freaking amazing now she can she's still working on jumping because she's building up her confidence again

1243
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,580
Because she couldn't move for like a month and a half

1244
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:52,380
I carried her around in her little cat bed and I had to like hold her up to use a bathroom and stuff

1245
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:56,540
It was very sad, but she's a good she's she's zooming everywhere now. She's my baby

1246
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:01,260
She's like you might hear her screaming at some point because she likes to play with a little spring toy

1247
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,740
And she gets really excited and she be house with it

1248
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:09,580
But yeah, she's good. She's good. Don't worry about it. Um, she's I usually I have a cat bed on my desk

1249
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:13,580
And her boomy and rena will sometimes lay in the cat bed

1250
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:18,300
And so I usually I like to have a cat cam up so you guys can see the cats and then I can also like

1251
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:20,860
flip you off um

1252
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:23,020
in the

1253
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,500
On camera, um, so yeah

1254
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:31,500
At least she has you as a caretaker. Yeah, I'm very devoted to my animals

1255
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,740
I growing up I almost became a veterinarian

1256
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,940
but um

1257
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:38,380
I was a slacker

1258
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:40,220
I slacked

1259
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:43,180
Wait, did did management finally tweet out that we have merch?

1260
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,220
Hold on

1261
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:51,980
Hold on, but yeah, don't worry about the donation thing so you can always support through patreon

1262
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:57,580
um, patreon is also in the description below if uh, you can just throw five bucks my way and

1263
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,940
Again, you don't have to consume what's on the patreon if you're not into that

1264
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:05,580
But if you're like I want to help out or you know like comment subscribe

1265
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:11,660
Wait or is it did they tweet I will retweet

1266
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:18,300
I just I know I'm weird and I prefer Twitter on mobile

1267
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:23,180
Oh

1268
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:34,220
Why can't you mean no okay, they did oh crap

1269
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:46,940
But um, yeah anything you guys donate uh, or like if support honestly just you just being here is support enough for me to be honest

1270
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,940
um

1271
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:55,420
But that goes towards my dream of buying my own house and having an animal sanctuary and also paying all my debt

1272
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:58,380
because

1273
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:05,100
Man, I love college

1274
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:08,700
That party last night was awfully crazy

1275
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:13,580
I miss your day, but don't feel pressured to buy like I don't want you to be like wow

1276
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:17,500
You know Dami mommy she be was said I had to buy her merch

1277
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:24,780
You don't have to it's great because a hundred percent of it the money goes to me minus my split with ubu market

1278
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:31,660
But only what you can't I don't want you if you're like I need this to eat this week

1279
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,900
Do not give me your money

1280
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:36,860
And also make sure you support the other girls as well

1281
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:44,940
Guilty us now or no no no no buy buy my merch. I'll be homeless. No, I'm fine again. Remember guys. I have a job

1282
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:49,660
I still have a job like I would like to stream full time, but

1283
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:51,980
that is

1284
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:55,100
Based off of you guys. I'm not going to put the pressure

1285
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:59,820
My livelihood on people who just want to sit back and watch a buddy girl, you know

1286
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:03,420
Food is temporary. I am forever

1287
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:10,060
No, no stop. Okay. Anyways, I'm losing my voice

1288
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:14,780
Someone please help me with my monthly budget 40% for after

1289
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:20,300
Finda no, I'm not into finda people somebody that has asked me that before

1290
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:26,380
In my maros if I if I am one of the financial domination ones and I do not

1291
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:31,500
Like that because sometimes people can be really taken advantage of

1292
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:35,100
Not a fan of that

1293
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,220
That's why I'm like only get what you can don't feel pressured

1294
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:43,980
If you can't give it all just like comment retweet spread word of my

1295
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:48,140
Terribleness to other people. I somebody's tell me that

1296
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:54,300
In my maros that they're like, oh, yeah, I showed my my stream your stream to a friend and I'm like

1297
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:56,460
oh

1298
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:01,100
No, and then that person left a mirror. I was like, thank you. No, no the same person

1299
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:04,940
somebody showed the stream to them and they were like

1300
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:12,140
They left me a really nice message about how I reminded them of someone that they used to be close to in the past and it was nice

1301
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:19,100
And I was just like, oh, I'm happy I could touch that person in a different way than I would normally touch people

1302
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:20,780
What that sounds?

1303
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,780
predatory

1304
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:29,900
We went from we want fdom not fdom in this one

1305
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:35,100
Just a little sus. Don't worry about it. She loves us. I don't love you

1306
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,500
debatable

1307
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:43,900
Yeah, I have to tell myself that or I'll get parasocial

1308
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:47,740
base take actually

1309
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:50,220
You can't get a pair of social guys

1310
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:55,420
She hates us. I totally hate you. I hate you so much

1311
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,260
You know what

1312
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:06,220
Oh, okay. I think I'll stream it for a little bit longer

1313
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:10,060
But if you I know like I think stronti is still streaming

1314
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,220
But if you also want to watch

1315
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:14,860
Amy when she starts streaming

1316
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:19,820
Feel free to again. No pressure support all the girls all the girls deserve them the most

1317
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:27,980
Law breaker. Oh

1318
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:33,820
I don't know why I sound like prince. Am I blind?

1319
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,220
Oh

1320
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:40,220
I am blind

1321
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:50,860
I pressed the right thing I will tell you that much

1322
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:56,060
Bro, I'm

1323
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,300
I don't

1324
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,980
It might be me

1325
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:07,180
But I don't like the timing of because I'll press I think the animation of me hopping in the shell

1326
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,260
Like I have to do it before

1327
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:14,860
No, I don't ma I'm not winning. I'm doing terrible

1328
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:24,540
I tended to leave stuff because I'm about to say something parasocial

1329
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,660
Bro, I get it. I totally I remember

1330
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:32,380
When so I worked from home for a little while. I'll tell

1331
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,420
Trigger it after I tell my story

1332
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:43,260
And I like was very agoraphobic didn't leave my house for six months. Well, I um, I was like real neat

1333
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,900
Hickey morey neat girl. Um

1334
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:48,860
And so I just watched this one vtuber

1335
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,820
Well, I watched multiple vtubers, but I was like, oh my god

01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:54,620
I want to be her friend. She makes me so happy

1337
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:58,060
My god, she's my oh she so like I get it. I totally get it

1338
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:01,180
Like everybody wants that sort of

1339
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,660
connection

1340
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,500
He has never known defeat

1341
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:10,060
Yeah, timing I'm still getting used to the timing

1342
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:15,260
I think if I put him up against like the

1343
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:20,060
I like I'm wondering if I will he kicks up. Okay. Well

1344
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,020
Oh

1345
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:25,660
And he also does the fucking back kick too though

1346
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:34,620
Oh, is my game lagging no, well, I'm already fucked

1347
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,300
I'm already fucked

1348
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:41,020
Can I just give me a moment

1349
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:45,820
Give me a moment, please for the love of god

1350
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:54,700
I like bugged out for me to wear the shell

1351
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:00,940
Oh, yeah, no, like

1352
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:07,180
I'm trying. Let's go parasocial. Yeah parasocialism has its pros and cons because obviously it gives you something

1353
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:09,180
but it takes stuff away because um

1354
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:13,500
Yeah, you then you remember. Oh just a person on the internet

1355
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:18,380
Playing a really cute anime buddy that makes you

1356
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:21,260
Um

1357
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,660
But

1358
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:29,820
Like but it's totally natural to want to develop a relationship with someone that you have similar interests with and

1359
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:32,540
But it just like

1360
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:36,300
Understanding like oh, you know, I might I will never probably meet them

1361
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:39,020
I never

1362
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:42,960
Can have that sort of thing. Yeah, it's hard

1363
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:55,100
I I I'm pressing circle. I'm pressing circle for the love of god. I'm pressing circle

1364
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:59,420
I hate

1365
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,700
Oh, don't back kick me, please

1366
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:16,380
I hate that straw, dude. Why am I getting ganked by a straw?

1367
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,020
Should be his tongue fellow

1368
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:26,380
That's on my side. Why are you talking on that?

1369
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:32,140
Why is he still talking?

1370
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:41,420
Do you have tongue physics? I I can stick out my tongue. That's it

1371
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,980
But I think it's funny because

1372
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:45,980
artists never rendered the tongue

1373
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:48,940
So I guess how about pink tongue?

1374
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:56,220
You know what I should fucking do I should uh, I really should level up but

1375
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:05,420
Yeah, I'm uh, I'm someone who falls so hard like

1376
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,780
Like tomah said

1377
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:13,020
Like when I care about someone I care deeply like the girls I'm like, I love you

1378
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:17,980
You're my best friends now and they're like girl. We just met now. I'm kidding. They're just like me us too

1379
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:20,860
We're all just fucking parasocial towards each other

1380
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:31,820
My game is lagging a little bit. I just have to get them running in a circle and then

1381
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:39,980
And then when he does that, okay

1382
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:47,660
Some attacks are unblockable agro attacks

1383
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:53,900
Signaled by the agro symbol that appears above krill. Can you see it? Be sure to dodge run or jump out of the way

1384
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:56,460
Okay

1385
01:54:57,660 --> 01:55:00,060
If it's parasocial we're all doing it to each other

1386
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:06,460
Can't escape para especially not in this industry you can knowledge. Yeah. Yeah

1387
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:10,620
Girls of great chemistry. We do I know like, um

1388
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:17,180
Some companies probably may not have that because some people like see

1389
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:24,620
That as like, uh, fuck hitting it. I mean with enough tech smack out the balance. We never know. We capsize now starts to flash

1390
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:26,620
Okay, so it's like a

1391
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:29,580
Okay

1392
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,060
Oh, please

1393
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:36,060
I

1394
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,500
Fucking up

1395
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:45,660
Oh, I like I don't know why the fuck

1396
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:50,220
That happened but it did

1397
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:53,020
Huh, I like the artwork. Okay. It's fine

1398
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:57,980
Now we know what to do. I think I was starting off while the freaking

1399
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,340
Dialogue boxes that just shy to show up

1400
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:07,020
Yeah, yeah, I got I got the strut I got the strut struts there struts all there

1401
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:11,100
All right, bitch

1402
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,900
Oh my god

1403
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:22,060
Oh, you want to come get this crap busty so bad. Oh my god, you want this crap busty?

1404
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,460
What the fuck was that?

1405
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:31,660
I see that. That was so weird. He just like jolted to the side a little bit

1406
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:43,180
Oh, okay, I did dodge in time. All right. I I'm pressing it when he's about to swing. So it's so weird to me

1407
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,740
Holy shit that flings me back. Okay

1408
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:04,620
Oh, no

1409
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:07,180
Please

1410
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,980
Oh, thank god

1411
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:12,220

My nose is a chief fuck

1414
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:37,020
I

1415
01:57:39,820 --> 01:57:42,700
Why do I feel like I've done more damage than I actually have

1416
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:56,460
Oh, this is not a good show

1417
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:03,980
Oh fuck

1418
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,860

Dude's giving you hella bot backshots. Yeah, not even the good good good way. This is a backshot roulette

1421
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:26,700
It's fun to be a little parasocial but as a viewer, I don't want to come off like I don't understand boundaries

1422
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:31,020
It's funny because tomorrow I have a drunk asmr stream and spoiler

01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:44,700
wine hag

1427
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:50,220
In the role play I usually don't drink but I'm gonna go out and grab some stuff to make um some mixed drinks

1428
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:53,180
Uh, so if you fall in love with me tomorrow

1429
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:56,380
You can't tell about a bite of my lip

1430
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:58,060
It's okay

1431
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:00,060
I understand

1432
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,500
I

1433
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:10,140
Make a drink of choice. Uh, I prefer fruity drinks. Um, I went to this really awesome barbecue spot one time and they made a

1434
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:15,980
Uh, honey jack daniels with peach

1435
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:18,780

Fresh peaches and ice and then some other but they made like their own like peach iced tea

1448
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,780

Horse riding or like mounted enemies. I just like running in a circle

Circle around this dead body while we're at it

1458
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:31,660
Oh

1459
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:44,320
I knew he's gonna fucking do that. I was trying to roll out the way

He was up my ass. Okay. So I kind of have to make sure he's far away

1465
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:47,100
Wait, no, I'm not back sitting. I just noticed animation when dark souls circle strafe is so good

02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:50,140
It is to give enemies mine which gives cops it

There's a child screaming down the hallway or a dog. I can't tell

02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,580
It's a dog

1497

1518
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:23,340

And you guys can't see how much I'm moving my hands

1669
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:36,620
um

1670
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:38,060
uh, but

1671
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:39,740
it's

1672
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:44,460
I just get so far I'm like, why do you want me to pay this much money to play a game that's already out?

1673
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,540
It's just a dlc and it's 60 bucks

1674
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:52,300
The only excuse I'd give that to is elden ring. I don't know how I don't know how much elden ring

1675
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:55,260
Erie tree one is gonna be though

1676
02:20:56,220 --> 02:21:01,180
No fans, but they said destiny 2 would get its root back last three. Yeah, no that that game is

1677
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:05,260
Shit shite fellow hand talker, of course

1678
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:08,540
Oh what the fuck look at this little animation

1679
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:12,700
That's so adorable

1680
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:18,220
What the hell um

1681
02:21:20,220 --> 02:21:22,220
Oh

1682
02:21:22,860 --> 02:21:26,060
Wait, can I can I have that?

1683
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:31,660
I'm a balder skate

1684
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:36,620
Like it's weird because

1685
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:38,860
I

1686
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:40,860
love fantasy

1687
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:45,980
And I thought I would really like balder's gate

1688
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:50,860
I've never played balder's gate. I had never played diablo and I like diablo

1689
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:54,300
I'm usually not good at like or like

1690
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:59,980
Not like not good, but I don't like turn-based games. I realize

1691
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:02,060
um

1692
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:07,980
In like party management and like I like the story like if I could just run around like a skyrim and just like

1693
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:15,660
Gang people that'd be cool. But I think because it wasn't what I like. I literally have balder's gate three sitting on my ps5

1694
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:20,060
Because I bought it and I played like three hours and I got nowhere

1695
02:22:20,860 --> 02:22:25,340
And I'm like, when do I get to fuck a starion? Like I just want to fuck a starion

1696
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:27,420
the vampire dude

1697
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:30,940
Who apparently is the also the voice of hyzenberg?

1698
02:22:31,580 --> 02:22:34,300
From a resident evil village. Hello

1699
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,260
What I'm playing on easy difficulty

1700
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:40,540
Uh, sorry about 20 20 77

1701
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:48,540
Yeah, sorry about 27 7 redeemed itself. Good great game. Great game pan am

1702
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:51,260
hell yeah

1703
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:55,900
Did can I have that? Oh fuck, you know what? Give me that

1704
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:00,140
I don't know where the fuck that came from

1705
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:03,100
But like

1706
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:06,140
I won't lie to you

1707
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:14,780
I love fps's, but I haven't played any like I haven't played cod or black ops and I haven't played um

1708
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:20,700
Valorant and I haven't played like because everything's just so different and I just

1709
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:23,820
I just can't

1710
02:23:23,820 --> 02:23:28,220
Stand them anymore and I'm like because I played like I played counter strike. Um

1711
02:23:30,460 --> 02:23:36,140
Oh, come on. I played the newest counter strike and I'm like, no this doesn't feel the same like I don't

1712
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,940
I don't like it

1713
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:41,020
It just felt whatever

1714
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:46,140
And everything I'd like it was like games used to be so much more simple

1715
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:51,340
But now with like skin like like oh like the counter strike definitely introduced like the concept of like

1716
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:54,940
skins and like it was literally its own little

1717
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:57,500
system

1718
02:23:57,580 --> 02:24:03,020
Little stock market. I know that for a fact because I spent thousands of dollars on stuff, but yeah

1719
02:24:04,940 --> 02:24:06,940
Staring as the hardest romance

1720
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,100
Difficulty just track through one

1721
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:13,900
But I pretty sure I had it on easy mode because I like usually I'll play a game on easy mode

1722
02:24:14,060 --> 02:24:16,220
I'm not afraid. I'll say it. I'm a little bitch

1723
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:21,260
Um when it comes to games that I don't know so I'll usually play stuff on that

1724
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:23,260
That

1725
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:27,100
It caused generational trauma to my imaginary fit. What?

1726
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:35,420
My friend group more like half-life pvp enjoyers to gorgeous. Yeah, I never I played a lot of gary's mod

1727
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:37,920
I never played team fortress. I'll be honest with you

1728
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:44,380
I played so much trouble in terrorist town um and murder

1729
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:47,900
So I supposed to do this

1730
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:50,940
The fuck is that

1731
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:53,420
Dude

1732
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:55,420
I'm like pretty lost

1733
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:03,500
Oh

1734
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:06,860
Okay, let's start a piece of string. Amen. Oh, okay

1735
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:12,460
I was like, I see all these fish hooks. When am I gonna learn to like grapple?

1736
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:21,020
Okay, well, I don't know where to go though

1737
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:31,980
Am I too far away?

1738
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:35,820
What the hell

1739
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:39,420
The fuck am I doing?

1740
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:41,500
Oh

1741
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:46,220
How was it watching she be? Oh, yeah, she was like stuck platforming for like

1742
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:49,420
An hour. It was great

1743
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:52,860
All right, do I need more string? I don't

1744
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:57,180
Should I just kill myself in minecraft?

1745
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:06,940
Oh my god, hello

1746
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:08,940

1747
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:18,780
The fuck dude it would have let me go up

1748
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:23,020
I hate it here

1749
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:34,940
I think it's because I need a snack and I'm getting grumpy

1750
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:39,020
Oh

1751
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:45,020
Don't do this to me again

1752
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:51,180
What what is that if why wouldn't let me just go up straight

1753
02:26:54,860 --> 02:27:02,220
Getting angry maybe so this is gonna make matter race platform. Oh, no, it's literally always the platforming the platforming pisses me off

1754
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:09,420
Can I

1755
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:28,860
Oh, that's cute it's like a uh medallion badge thingy

1756
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:33,740
That's real cute

1757
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:37,340
It's an adaptation

1758
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:41,740
I'm guessing those are powers

1759
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:46,780
He's so cute what the fuck

1760
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:52,780

1762
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:06,220
Oh

1763
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,820

1764
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:22,460
Can I why doesn't it let me go?

1765
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:32,460

I just got yeeted for some reason but you know ended up being helpful I guess

1767
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:44,300
Okay, all right

1768
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:51,340
Because I'm like I don't know if something's a bug or if it's a feature

1769
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:01,260
Ow

1770

It was supposed I wasn't supposed to try to spider-man my wake. Okay. See I'm not bad at games

1831
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:57,900
That was not supposed to be the mechanic to get up there

1832
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:04,460
It was supposed to go by so I could walk up

1833
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:09,500
Oh my god

1834
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:13,500
This game's killing me, but in a good way. I like it

1835
02:37:14,460 --> 02:37:18,460
Oh shell, are you okay? I can't believe I dropped it. I'm so stupid

1836
02:37:19,500 --> 02:37:22,220
I one job and it was oh, it's your fucking fault

1837
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:32,140
Yeah, he he we had a date and he fucking stood me up your captain we were supposed to battle and you just left

1838
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:39,420
Skip the boss we get slowed down on the stairs, but then it just oh my god, I can

1839
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:42,380
I

1840
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:46,540
Was so like I was so ready to fight that boss too. I'm so mad

1841
02:37:47,820 --> 02:37:50,380
But I'm like happy, but I'm mad. Was that a marshmallow?

1842
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:53,740
Do I get a little hat?

1843
02:37:56,780 --> 02:37:59,580
You're telling me I could put this on my booty cheek, but

1844
02:38:01,420 --> 02:38:03,420
Am I got that cut pussy?

1845
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:07,900
But um, but I couldn't wear that snail shell

1846
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:11,420
Barnacle

1847
02:38:11,980 --> 02:38:13,980
Oh, that's cool

1848
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:18,300
Damn you get on a lot of stowaways right off the bat. I wonder if that's normal

1849
02:38:19,340 --> 02:38:21,340
Oh, okay

1850
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:28,300
It's for attack vitality. Oh, I see how that works and then you can get more and promote. I'm oh, I didn't mean to do that

1851
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:31,900
Ooh

1852
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:35,900
Oh, okay, so it's either one or two in this and that

1853
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:39,340
defense

1854
02:38:39,820 --> 02:38:41,820
I'll do that. Yeah

1855
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:44,300
Doesn't uh

1856
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:47,100
I need to go to a moon shell. What the fuck

1857
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:50,140
What is this?

1858
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:52,940
Drop I don't want to drop. Where am I dropping?

1859
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:58,380
Did you say something to me hand-pressed and then make it a bit as interesting as I were

1860
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:02,060
Can you be favorite?

1861
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:04,780
Yeah, sure thing chicken wing

1862
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:07,580
What's that do

1863
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:10,540
Now we're gaming

1864
02:39:10,780 --> 02:39:12,780
Gotta go. Oh, of course. Bye

1865
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:18,380
If you guys you leave you to watch how cute Emmy is totally understand

1866
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:21,900
She might be like looking some of your ears right now or something. I think she's ASMR today

1867
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:25,660
Oh

1868
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:27,660
So that's the re oh

1869
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:29,660
Okay, so if I fall I climb up

1870
02:39:30,220 --> 02:39:32,220
So if I didn't drop that I

1871
02:39:32,220 --> 02:39:34,220
would just be fucked I

1872
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:36,380
presume

1873
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:44,940
All right, all right

1874
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:48,940
We're here we're vibing

1875
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:54,220
I feel like if I touch that it's bad. So I'm not gonna

1876
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:56,460
I

1877
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:04,940
Must be like oil wait, what's that there's cool stuff up there

1878
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:08,860
I mean down there. I'm sorry

1879
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:13,100
Excuse you

1880
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:16,620
Give me your micro plastics

1881
02:40:17,740 --> 02:40:20,540
Oh, I wonder if I can just like jump down

1882
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:23,180
I probably can

1883
02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:26,940
I'm tempted but then I have to do all this shit again, but I don't really care too much

1884
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:40,860
What that

1885
02:40:45,580 --> 02:40:47,580
I don't know what the shell means

1886
02:40:51,020 --> 02:40:53,020
Oh, it's pretty cool

1887
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:55,660
Oh

1888
02:40:55,900 --> 02:40:57,900
Can I like

1889
02:40:59,740 --> 02:41:01,740
Oh, I thought I could like

1890
02:41:03,100 --> 02:41:05,100
The fuck I wasn't locked on

1891
02:41:06,460 --> 02:41:08,460
Can I have that?

1892
02:41:08,460 --> 02:41:10,460
Ew, I don't know what that does

1893
02:41:11,900 --> 02:41:14,220
I'm more into drunken bunny ASMR

1894
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:18,780
You're just gonna see how much of a babbling idiot I get

1895
02:41:21,100 --> 02:41:23,100
Is there

1896
02:41:23,180 --> 02:41:26,140
Is that where the cave is supposed to be I thought or is that someone else

1897
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:32,540
An effort to recover his home the plucky hermit crab ventures to a mysterious cave

1898
02:41:33,580 --> 02:41:37,500
But he quickly discovers that return journey will be significantly more challenging

1899
02:41:38,540 --> 02:41:42,540
Hello, who's talking he approaches the ghostly figure in front of him

1900
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:48,620
I like that

1901
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:54,060
I'll be different from now me good. Hey, let me just

1902
02:41:55,820 --> 02:41:57,820
And then getting banned

1903
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:04,860
Oh shit

1904
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:17,260
Well, I have the nail so I already have a tack up. Okay. I'm good for now. Yeah

1905
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:25,740
Or I can put because I got a small but the can can get hit so

1906
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:29,580
Yeah, that's fine. Oh, you're so cute

1907
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:37,660
Who's talking

1908
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:42,540
Hi, um, my name's krill. Do you know anything shiny in this cave?

1909
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:46,620
Something that might like impress a huge beautiful crab lady

1910
02:42:46,860 --> 02:42:48,060
Yeah

1911
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:51,740
Confused and desperate the hermit crab begins begging help from strangers

1912
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:54,780
Hey, I'm not desperate

1913
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:55,980
yet

1914
02:42:55,980 --> 02:43:00,940
Thus far he is preserved persevered by taking refuge in artifacts from beyond the waves

1915
02:43:01,580 --> 02:43:06,220
But to survive here from here on out. He must awaken the currents inside of him

1916
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:10,460
He must access the power of

1917
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,500
a mommy

1918
02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:16,460
A mommy

1919
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:19,020
Mommy, sorry

1920
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:21,420
You know the voice acting crazy in this game

1921
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:25,260
I mean drunk funny content and some of the best

1922
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:27,900
I'm looking at a bite. I'm looking at a bite

1923
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:31,980
Wiggles eyebrows

1924
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:33,980
You mommy I'll stop

1925
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:40,540
Food wars rough should get out of here food wars is so weird. I'm like I

1926
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:46,620
I really like food related enemies and I was watching it and like I'll fall asleep to that

1927
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:51,020
But sometimes I'll like wake up and people will have their clothes off and I'm like

1928
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:55,660
Why am I

1929
02:43:56,540 --> 02:43:58,540
Why

1930
02:43:58,860 --> 02:44:00,860
Never I'm not gonna finish that joke

1931
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:08,140
What

1932
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:10,540
What the shell was that I feel tingly

1933
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:16,060
The hermit crab crab dawns a metal shell and feels a new ability awaken

1934
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:18,620
I do

1935
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:20,620
Yes, he does

1936
02:44:21,740 --> 02:44:27,660
While wearing a shell press book to consume umami charges an evaporating new shell spell. Oh, that's cool

1937
02:44:28,380 --> 02:44:30,380
Oh

1938
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:35,260
Shell shock or fizzle that's so cool

1939
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:38,060
Can I talk to you again?

1940
02:44:38,060 --> 02:44:45,100
So what's this umami stuff exactly the hermit crab continues into the cavern excited to make the use of its new ability

1941
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:47,900
Uh

1942
02:44:47,900 --> 02:44:49,900
This is like I'm not gonna fucking talk to you

1943
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:51,980
I

1944
02:44:52,460 --> 02:44:59,180
Creature blocks the hermit crabs path immune to his physical attacks. It may only be dispatched by his newfound umami powers

1945
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:02,300
Well, isn't that convenient?

1946
02:45:02,380 --> 02:45:06,380
The noble moons now denies any involvement in manufacturing the scenario

1947
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:17,260
How do I is it really seemed to me

1948
02:45:20,060 --> 02:45:22,060
Oh when it touches me

1949
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:27,500
It just

1950
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:35,740
Oh, that kind of sucks actually it has it has to hit me to be affected

1951
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:43,500
The one's innocent hermit crabs ability to slaughter his enemies has increased dramatically

1952
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:46,940
Did you have to put it that way

1953
02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:49,740
Your voice is so nice for how dorky you are

1954
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:54,940
You wanted a dummy mommy you got a fucking nerd

1955
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:02,220
Are you supposed to like charge the shell and then block? Oh

1956
02:46:09,180 --> 02:46:13,420
My model's lagging, but you're probably right. It's probably probably blocking

1957
02:46:14,380 --> 02:46:18,780
When I have my controller plugged in I have to have run my model off of my wi-fi and so

1958
02:46:20,140 --> 02:46:22,140
I'm gonna move in slow motion for a bit

1959
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:30,060
He senses that the reward he seeks lies further within this cavern

1960
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:36,380
As well as the opportunity to meet his newfound idol the mysterious and attractive moons now in the flesh

1961
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:40,540
Guess I have no choice

1962
02:46:44,380 --> 02:46:47,900
I kind of wish I gave the moonsail a dorkier voice than like a hot

1963
02:46:49,740 --> 02:46:53,580
Lady voice pop off interesting

1964
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:07,420
Keeping the shelf for now because of the defense, but I do want to oh look at the sea anemone anemone

1965
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:12,060
um

1966
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:14,620
He can just to play around the stuff. Ooh

1967
02:47:15,900 --> 02:47:17,900
Don't fall into the abyss

1968
02:47:19,180 --> 02:47:21,180
Can I okay

1969
02:47:25,420 --> 02:47:33,500
Sometimes I keep pressing l1 sort of I don't like that it does that that it sometimes it gets stuck and doesn't climb up

1970
02:47:38,300 --> 02:47:40,300
And I have to wiggle around

1971
02:47:42,460 --> 02:47:44,460
Whoa

1972
02:47:51,260 --> 02:47:54,380
Why am I getting beat up by this stupid thing

1973
02:47:58,220 --> 02:48:00,220
Eep

1974
02:48:01,900 --> 02:48:04,540
Oh, it's on the games. I like it. I like it

1975
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:10,060
Uh, you guys can let me know if you'd like me to continue this. Otherwise, I'll probably just like play by myself

1976
02:48:11,020 --> 02:48:13,020
If you guys like watching this

1977
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:20,140
Me trying to dumbly figure out a game

1978
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:24,940
What the hell

1979
02:48:26,940 --> 02:48:28,940
Hmm

1980
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:33,100
Do I want to try to get over there

1981
02:48:34,060 --> 02:48:37,980
Because I'm just gonna get caught. Yeah, I'm just gonna get caught in a stupid net weird net bug

1982
02:48:38,860 --> 02:48:40,860
All right

1983
02:48:41,100 --> 02:48:43,100
I'm coming for you

1984
02:48:46,380 --> 02:48:49,420
I'm pressing the wrong. Oh god. Oh god

1985
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:03,100
Abraced r2 again instead of r1

1986
02:49:04,060 --> 02:49:06,060
I

1987
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:09,740
Whoopsies

1988
02:49:12,060 --> 02:49:14,060
What's that

1989
02:49:15,580 --> 02:49:18,220
Oh the charges my umami question mark

1990
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:25,740
Wait

1991
02:49:27,820 --> 02:49:30,540
Can I guess I can

1992
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:35,100
I

1993
02:49:42,060 --> 02:49:44,060
Don't need to fight you

1994
02:49:44,140 --> 02:49:50,060
Oh, I see there's like little parts where I actually can't climb up. What the hell

1995
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:56,220
That was a weird ass noise that crab man

1996
02:49:58,140 --> 02:50:00,940
The animation for the grappling is pretty pretty sick

1997
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:08,140
Okay, that makes a lot more sense now because I'm like, why can't I wait, but I just did it right now

1998
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:11,020
I'm confused

1999
02:50:16,060 --> 02:50:18,060
Oh

2000
02:50:34,060 --> 02:50:36,060
What the fuck just happened

2001
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:49,500
I'm so confused

2002
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:01,740
I just fell into nothing twice

2003
02:51:02,540 --> 02:51:04,540
I thought it was gonna drop me

2004
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:07,020
Back at the moon

2005
02:51:09,980 --> 02:51:16,220

If I'm playing a game

2131
03:02:20,860 --> 03:02:22,860

2132
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:26,700

Get on your knees

I know that's like subby

2162
03:04:04,620 --> 03:04:08,300

Um, and then for the crop I could just I don't know saw my ass with it

03:04:41,820 --> 03:04:43,980
Something similar because that'd be fun

I I could easily like streaming is so fun. I love streaming. It's not hard for me to stream

2174
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:59,580
It's not hard for me to yap and talk at you. I'm not like I could be a shy person on my hand is red from

2175
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:02,540
slapping this um

2176
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:09,020
But uh, that's usually like outside of streaming and in streaming I can be

2177
03:05:09,580 --> 03:05:11,580
I feel like I'm more myself when I'm streaming

2178
03:05:12,300 --> 03:05:16,060
um, so I like I I take the opportunity during streams to beat myself

2179
03:05:17,020 --> 03:05:19,900
And I hope youtube gives this gumbo currency

2180
03:05:23,100 --> 03:05:27,740

03:15:59,180 --> 03:16:03,020
British kids you just like a like a chop like

2337
03:16:03,980 --> 03:16:06,780
Just like a london herb heavily bronze

2338
03:16:07,500 --> 03:16:09,500
Just shakes you

2339
03:16:09,740 --> 03:16:14,300
That's so funny. Oh, yeah, I was I was like I was talking to my parents

2340
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:18,860
I like oh, how you doing? I'm like, I'm good. Now. I'm like thinking about getting another cat

2341
03:16:19,740 --> 03:16:24,060
And my parents are like why and I'm like, I don't know. I'm feeling more lonely and they're like you already have three

2342
03:16:24,060 --> 03:16:26,780
What's it gonna be? I'm like, I don't know. So like I got

2343
03:16:27,660 --> 03:16:31,580
Boomi so reina could have a friend and then reina hated boomi. So then I got

2344
03:16:32,140 --> 03:16:34,140
Fia so boomi could have a friend

2345
03:16:34,460 --> 03:16:39,660
But Fia also hates boomi because he's a menace to society. Well, she doesn't hate them. They actually love each other very much

2346
03:16:40,220 --> 03:16:46,140
Um, he just likes to chase her around and sniff her ass too much. That's kind of annoying for um, and I'm like, maybe

2347
03:16:46,780 --> 03:16:51,500
Fia needs a friend, you know, like everybody needs friends. Everybody needs friends

2348
03:16:54,140 --> 03:16:57,180
Don't say a poor boomi boomi like what do you do the other day? He

2349
03:16:58,460 --> 03:17:02,860
Fucking attacked my feet. I was like I got out of the shower and he

2350
03:17:03,420 --> 03:17:07,980
Has this weird thing where he likes to be held right after I shower. I don't know why he does that

2351
03:17:07,980 --> 03:17:12,380
I'm like, oh, maybe he wants me to smell like him or something and he gets really snuggly and purry

2352
03:17:13,340 --> 03:17:18,140
So I'll hold him a bit and then I put him down. He got mad and he started attacking my ankles

2353
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:22,700
Everyone needs a friend

2354
03:17:23,500 --> 03:17:27,900
Yeah, and you won't be sleeping, chilling, eating. I'm surprised they're not like running a muck right now

2355
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:34,780
Boomi, boomi isn't a crate. I I had to put Fia in a crate for a long time because um

2356
03:17:35,500 --> 03:17:38,940
Boomi would try to pounce on her and play with her when she couldn't walk

2357
03:17:39,580 --> 03:17:43,420
And so um, I had to for her safety just put her in a crate

2358
03:17:43,420 --> 03:17:46,380
But now boomi and reina and fia just like sleeping in it

2359
03:17:47,180 --> 03:17:52,140
I didn't know I could crate train a cat, but I crate trained a cat. They're actually all crate trains. So

2360
03:17:53,100 --> 03:17:58,540
Cats are really pretty cool. But I like dogs too. I always want like when I get my own house eventually

2361
03:17:59,500 --> 03:18:01,500
um save up and all that stuff

2362
03:18:02,140 --> 03:18:04,140
off my debts

2363
03:18:04,220 --> 03:18:08,300
Um my house I want to get dogs. I really like great piranhas

2364
03:18:09,020 --> 03:18:13,740
They're so big and I want to get some like because great piranhas are livestock guardian dogs

2365
03:18:14,380 --> 03:18:16,380
and I would like to um

2366
03:18:17,180 --> 03:18:24,140
Get some like chickens and goats for the dog to protect and my friend told like taught not told

2367
03:18:24,460 --> 03:18:28,140
Taught me but she tells me how she makes like candles from goat's milk

2368
03:18:28,780 --> 03:18:33,500
And her candles smell fucking amazing because she does like those like farmers markets and stuff

2369
03:18:34,940 --> 03:18:37,660
And I'm like yo what doggie brings you like I like big dogs

2370
03:18:39,340 --> 03:18:42,060
Small dogs are yappy. I used to be obsessed with huskies

2371
03:18:43,740 --> 03:18:49,740
Cats are cats territorial. Oh, yeah, not really like it really depends. Go smell because they're mentioned

2372
03:18:51,420 --> 03:18:52,780
um

2373
03:18:52,780 --> 03:18:53,980
I like

2374
03:18:53,980 --> 03:18:59,020
I remember I really like feral hounds. I also really like coon hounds like hound dogs. Um

2375
03:19:00,780 --> 03:19:06,540
One of my close friends recently had a hound dog that passed and I loved him so much his name was copper

2376
03:19:06,620 --> 03:19:08,380
He would be like

2377
03:19:08,380 --> 03:19:12,540
He was a sweetheart. Um, I usually I usually don't like um

2378
03:19:13,740 --> 03:19:15,740
hound dogs, but

2379
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:22,380
He won me over with his floppy ears and his like he would like almost like purr like a cat when you pet him

2380
03:19:23,980 --> 03:19:25,980
He would just be like, um

2381
03:19:26,620 --> 03:19:28,620
He just pet him. He's like

2382
03:19:28,620 --> 03:19:30,620
It was funny

2383
03:19:31,100 --> 03:19:34,140
Yeah, he was he was a nice old man that old boy

2384
03:19:35,020 --> 03:19:36,540
um

2385
03:19:36,540 --> 03:19:38,540
sweet sweet boy, uh

2386
03:19:39,420 --> 03:19:40,860
and

2387
03:19:40,860 --> 03:19:44,700
I also want to get a dog because again, like I said, I'm a woman who lives alone

2388
03:19:44,780 --> 03:19:50,140
So I would like scary dog privilege for when I go on walks and stuff because I I don't usually I hate

2389
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:56,700
I also have really bad anxiety going outside. Uh, like I said, I was a gore phobic at one point and I feel like if I had a dog

2390
03:19:57,580 --> 03:19:59,740
It would be I would have a lot more

2391
03:20:00,620 --> 03:20:02,620
confidence

2392
03:20:02,620 --> 03:20:09,660
A dog named copper as well. He's rich back. Oh, yeah rich back religion rich bags. Uh, I have the weird talent of being able to

2393
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:13,900
Look at a dog and almost guess it's breed exactly

2394
03:20:14,860 --> 03:20:21,500
Because I used to my grandfather got me a dog book a book of dog breeds when I was younger. So I'm very good at um

2395
03:20:22,540 --> 03:20:28,940
Identifying rough area. Uh, where I used I like I moved down to my parents house. Um, that was a rougher area

2396
03:20:30,140 --> 03:20:32,300
Somebody got decapitated like a block away

2397
03:20:33,980 --> 03:20:38,460
That was crazy and a kid got stabbed in the butt in my high school. Um, but

2398
03:20:39,260 --> 03:20:40,380
Uh

2399
03:20:40,380 --> 03:20:43,580
Where I am now it's a little bit better, but people are rowdy

2400
03:20:45,020 --> 03:20:47,020
And excuse me. Yeah

2401
03:20:47,580 --> 03:20:49,580
It's crazy out here. He's crazy

2402
03:20:50,220 --> 03:20:53,740
Um, yeah, some kid that was like gang violence got stabbed in the ass. Um

2403
03:20:55,420 --> 03:20:57,420
And that's good

2404
03:20:57,580 --> 03:21:01,100
But I think yeah, I remember I was looking into like dobermans for a long time

2405
03:21:01,420 --> 03:21:05,100
Because I was like and then I was like, oh, how much would like an actual

2406
03:21:05,820 --> 03:21:07,820
guard dog be

2407
03:21:07,980 --> 03:21:09,980
They're like $40,000 and I'm like

2408
03:21:11,420 --> 03:21:12,780
What?

2409
03:21:12,780 --> 03:21:14,780
Uh, I used to work at a dog kennel

2410
03:21:15,580 --> 03:21:17,900
for um protected protective dogs

2411
03:21:18,380 --> 03:21:24,940
I hate I only lasted a week because the the way they treated the dogs was terrible. I reported them to um authorities to like, um

2412
03:21:26,060 --> 03:21:29,340
Animal control and all that stuff because they were a hundred percent

2413
03:21:30,300 --> 03:21:34,300
of using the dogs with uh shot callers and other

2414
03:21:34,860 --> 03:21:41,100
Methods to prop to improperly train them for for guard guard dogs a guard gone is only 530

2415
03:21:41,100 --> 03:21:43,820
Yeah, I want to get my um my license as well for that

2416
03:21:44,380 --> 03:21:48,460
I think it'd be cool imagine the IRL stream where I was taking to a gun range and I'm a good shot too

2417
03:21:48,940 --> 03:21:54,940
You know when I was in camp I got a Davey Crockett award because I'm really good with airsoft rifle

2418
03:21:57,900 --> 03:22:03,980
Um, but yeah, they had I love Belgian Malinois, um bellmells are so awesome. They're so smart

2419
03:22:04,300 --> 03:22:10,940
You know like I I also want to be able to get a dog that I can work like I don't want to take a dog to get bite training

2420
03:22:11,420 --> 03:22:12,220
um

2421
03:22:12,220 --> 03:22:14,860
Take a yeah, take uh get a dog that can

2422
03:22:16,060 --> 03:22:18,860
Like do agility courses and stuff. Um

2423
03:22:19,580 --> 03:22:23,420
And they also had like a rottweiler. I think his name was huxley. He was such a sweet boy

2424
03:22:23,500 --> 03:22:28,540
He was like, you're such a doofy little guy. I'm like, how are you gonna protect anybody? You're too sweet. Um

2425
03:22:29,900 --> 03:22:31,900
And they also had a lot of german shepherds

2426
03:22:32,140 --> 03:22:33,260
uh

2427
03:22:33,260 --> 03:22:35,260
one of my

2428
03:22:35,900 --> 03:22:37,020
co-workers

2429
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:40,860
Could I be your cart top? Sure. You guys are all my little my little dogs

2430
03:22:41,660 --> 03:22:44,540
Put you on leashes and put those little puppy masks on you

2431
03:22:45,660 --> 03:22:47,500
um

2432
03:22:47,500 --> 03:22:55,420
One of my co-workers at that place another big reason why I left one they only lived in like five by six

2433
03:22:56,380 --> 03:23:00,700
Kennels like it was so small kennels and that's where they were 24 seven

2434
03:23:01,500 --> 03:23:07,980
Unless they were taken out to train and it was bad and they didn't get like walks. They didn't like I wasn't allowed to pet them

2435
03:23:08,300 --> 03:23:09,820
couldn't pet the dogs

2436
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:10,780
um

2437
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:12,780
couldn't have any sort of

2438
03:23:12,860 --> 03:23:14,380
interaction with them

2439
03:23:14,380 --> 03:23:15,500
um

2440
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:21,260
I remember I was almost bit by this really beautiful black long-haired german shepherd calls called her miney when I was giving her her food

2441
03:23:22,140 --> 03:23:25,660
She was like and I I know it's because they're trained to do that. They're trained to be

2442
03:23:26,460 --> 03:23:30,540
Aggressive, but like it was just not the right way to go about it. Um

2443
03:23:31,340 --> 03:23:33,340
I'm pretty hard to be horrified

2444
03:23:33,420 --> 03:23:35,180
um

2445
03:23:35,180 --> 03:23:40,140
But my we were taken one of the dogs slipped out of their kennel and

2446
03:23:41,500 --> 03:23:43,500
Like I said, they're very aggressive

2447
03:23:43,900 --> 03:23:46,860
I didn't say I left me. I was like correctly and he

2448
03:23:47,980 --> 03:23:50,460
decided like a freaking asshole

2449
03:23:51,340 --> 03:23:52,780
to um

2450
03:23:52,780 --> 03:23:54,780
Hold on. I'm taking my cat mouth off because I'm

2451
03:23:55,740 --> 03:23:58,460
frowning this guy was a piece of shit and I hope he's

2452
03:23:59,740 --> 03:24:01,740
fucked up somewhere. Um

2453
03:24:02,380 --> 03:24:05,020
he was egging the dog on and

2454
03:24:05,820 --> 03:24:07,020
she

2455
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:10,300
Launched at him and tore up his sweatshirt, but his arm would have been gone

2456
03:24:11,260 --> 03:24:13,100
uh

2457
03:24:13,100 --> 03:24:15,820
Because he was just like trying that I was it was messed up

2458
03:24:15,900 --> 03:24:19,580
I was so pissed off and then I reported the company reported that employee

2459
03:24:20,140 --> 03:24:22,140
and I dipped um

2460
03:24:22,300 --> 03:24:25,820
And you know how I said they lived in only like five by six things

2461
03:24:26,220 --> 03:24:31,580
Uh, that's where they peed and they pooped and they ate and so my job was to go in and just clean their pee and their poop

2462
03:24:31,660 --> 03:24:34,220
And so I always came home smelling like shit. My mom hated it

2463
03:24:35,660 --> 03:24:40,780
I had to get special boots and I had like shock back all her piss and then pick up their dog. It was bad

2464
03:24:41,340 --> 03:24:45,340
It was so bad. I hated it there. They're gone now. I'm so happy. They're gone

2465
03:24:46,300 --> 03:24:48,300
I'm very passionate about animals

2466
03:24:49,660 --> 03:24:53,500
I remember when I was younger I also wanted to be a wolf um conservationist and biologist

2467
03:24:55,100 --> 03:24:56,700
and um

2468
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:58,700
run a wolf sanctuary

2469
03:24:59,420 --> 03:25:01,580
and so, uh

2470
03:25:01,580 --> 03:25:05,820
It's just like when like animals don't have the same

2471
03:25:07,900 --> 03:25:14,620
Comprehension as humans and they deserve to be protected. Do they pay good? They did not I think I got paid like 12 dollars an hour

2472
03:25:15,740 --> 03:25:17,740
Or less than that like nine dollars an hour

2473
03:25:18,700 --> 03:25:20,220
um

2474
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:22,220
But yeah, I was

2475
03:25:22,940 --> 03:25:27,900
I've had a lot of interesting jobs in my life. I know I was telling strani about one particular job

2476
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:30,380
That she's like, oh you have to tell

2477
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:33,020
You have to tell your stream about that

2478
03:25:34,620 --> 03:25:38,220
And yeah, because I used to I used to be an intern for drama alert

2479
03:25:40,140 --> 03:25:43,500
That's all I'll say though. That's all I'll say on it for now. Um

2480
03:25:43,500 --> 03:25:45,500
um

2481
03:25:45,740 --> 03:25:48,380
Let's get right into the news

2482
03:25:49,260 --> 03:25:51,260
and

2483
03:25:51,980 --> 03:25:56,540
That's crazy. Oh, yeah, you guys you guys don't know you guys don't know

2484
03:25:57,900 --> 03:26:00,860
Um, if you weren't a bunny, what would you be instead?

2485
03:26:02,620 --> 03:26:04,460
Does he know

2486
03:26:04,460 --> 03:26:06,460
does he know

2487
03:26:07,260 --> 03:26:11,980
Where you were hanging I wasn't hanging out with him. I was in a group chat with him on twitter

2488
03:26:12,940 --> 03:26:17,580
My job as an intern really all right, uh go out scour the internet

2489
03:26:18,300 --> 03:26:20,300
And tell him give me some stories

2490
03:26:21,820 --> 03:26:24,780
And it was funny because I was also working with celestia vega at the time

2491
03:26:24,940 --> 03:26:29,980
If you don't know who celeste vega is she was one of the zoeberger girls e-girls um

2492
03:26:31,820 --> 03:26:33,340
And

2493
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:38,540
We would just I remember just chatting with her and we would just be like, uh, what about this news thing and she was just like

2494
03:26:38,620 --> 03:26:42,380
I don't know. I'm gonna be like this news things doing what drama alert is good

2495
03:26:43,820 --> 03:26:45,820
He don't need to know

2496
03:26:46,060 --> 03:26:51,580
Um, oh my gosh, but oh, yeah, yeah, no, and he was uh very well connected to the commentary community

2497
03:26:52,380 --> 03:26:54,380
very interesting place, uh

2498
03:26:54,700 --> 03:26:57,820
It's when I first became a vtuber. I almost became

2499
03:26:58,700 --> 03:27:00,700
a drama tuber

2500
03:27:01,180 --> 03:27:03,180
But I

2501
03:27:03,340 --> 03:27:05,580
I wanted and I probably actually might still do this

2502
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:09,340
Not be like report on news, but just um

2503
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:12,780
Do you like synopsis of

2504
03:27:13,100 --> 03:27:14,540
creators

2505
03:27:14,540 --> 03:27:16,860
Kind of like a like a I know I've been watching

2506
03:27:17,420 --> 03:27:25,580
Uh, who was I watching recently? I like was recommended like a rima evan star even star video about like bow the whale

2507
03:27:26,300 --> 03:27:27,020
um

2508
03:27:27,020 --> 03:27:31,180
And what happened with that and I I just I was really I was like, oh, yeah

2509
03:27:31,180 --> 03:27:34,380
Like that's exactly and that's the type of content that used to make was that sort of stuff

2510
03:27:35,740 --> 03:27:39,900
If you don't know cook stars to stay that way gossiping stream, I wouldn't be so bad

2511
03:27:39,980 --> 03:27:43,020
but like that's like I wouldn't I would only

2512
03:27:43,900 --> 03:27:45,900
comment in like

2513
03:27:46,220 --> 03:27:48,220
document

2514
03:27:48,300 --> 03:27:50,300
Things that happened. I wouldn't

2515
03:27:51,100 --> 03:27:55,420
Want to gossip because one I don't like gossip and it's kind of catty

2516
03:27:56,620 --> 03:27:58,620
And I'm not one of those types of girls

2517
03:27:59,660 --> 03:28:01,420
And I wouldn't want to

2518
03:28:01,420 --> 03:28:06,460
Step on people's toes by being like, oh my god, there's person in eezy song you did

2519
03:28:07,740 --> 03:28:10,060
And then like all that shit like that's just

2520
03:28:10,780 --> 03:28:12,620
I'll leave that to false

2521
03:28:12,620 --> 03:28:15,020
In the press new soggy whatever his name is

2522
03:28:17,820 --> 03:28:22,940
Yeah, documentary documentary deep dive stuff. Yeah, like and you know like I

2523
03:28:24,060 --> 03:28:27,740
You know, it's really funny the people who used to watch my commentary videos

2524
03:28:28,220 --> 03:28:30,940
Um, we were like you should do ASMR

2525
03:28:32,380 --> 03:28:35,900
Because I talked in a really wispy voice because I wasn't super confident

2526
03:28:36,060 --> 03:28:42,460
So I'd be like this time in this community. I would just uh and some people are like, please I'm falling asleep

2527
03:28:42,540 --> 03:28:44,540
But I'm also entertained

2528
03:28:44,700 --> 03:28:46,700
Please do ASMR

2529
03:28:47,500 --> 03:28:49,100
Surprise

2530
03:28:49,100 --> 03:28:51,100
I'm doing ASMR

2531
03:28:51,340 --> 03:28:53,340
I'm gonna be real hella respectful for that. Yeah, like

2532
03:28:54,380 --> 03:28:57,660
I'm not like I'll like I won't lie to you. I watch those

2533
03:28:58,540 --> 03:29:00,060
channels

2534
03:29:00,060 --> 03:29:04,380
Can I be honest with you right now? Can I be can I be real with you? Let me get real close to

2535
03:29:07,500 --> 03:29:09,900
I've only been a vtuber for

2536
03:29:11,980 --> 03:29:13,660
Maybe

2537
03:29:13,660 --> 03:29:15,660
Six or seven months now

2538
03:29:16,220 --> 03:29:21,900
So I had to do a lot of research about the state of the community

2539
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:24,540
So I watched a lot of shitty

2540
03:29:25,500 --> 03:29:28,620
Stuff I watched a lot of like drama

2541
03:29:29,580 --> 03:29:32,700
Drama alert. I watched a lot of like drama tubers

2542
03:29:33,420 --> 03:29:37,340
Um, I had to go back and figure out who the hell marushia was

2543
03:29:37,900 --> 03:29:40,940
And why was everybody hating on her because she was dating so-and-so

2544
03:29:41,660 --> 03:29:44,540
Like I I did a lot of research

2545
03:29:45,340 --> 03:29:46,300
about

2546
03:29:46,300 --> 03:29:49,900
The vtuber community prior to being a vtuber

2547
03:29:50,220 --> 03:29:57,660
I always I watched vtubers like I would watch clips like I watched shy like I watched like the mainstream people like shy lily iron mouse

2548
03:29:59,020 --> 03:30:02,940
Um, I watched them from time to time, but really just clips. I wouldn't sit and watch streams

2549
03:30:03,740 --> 03:30:05,740
and um

2550
03:30:05,820 --> 03:30:07,420
but

2551
03:30:07,420 --> 03:30:12,140
So I did like a lot of freaking research. I don't know like strani was in my interview

2552
03:30:12,220 --> 03:30:18,860
She was wary about hiring me for a second because she was confused because she's like you've only been a vtuber for five months

2553
03:30:20,220 --> 03:30:22,380
How do you but why do you know so much?

2554
03:30:23,260 --> 03:30:24,940
and I'm like

2555
03:30:24,940 --> 03:30:27,900
Because I was a streamer for five years before that

2556
03:30:28,380 --> 03:30:32,540
And I do a lot of research because I know how to do research and so I know a lot of stuff

2557
03:30:34,780 --> 03:30:40,060
So I only have a couple months on strani for vtubing experience, but I love it. It's great

2558
03:30:40,220 --> 03:30:44,220
I remember I tried vtubing back when it first popped off in 2019, but um

2559
03:30:45,820 --> 03:30:47,820
I uh

2560
03:30:48,620 --> 03:30:52,700
I yeah, I had like a v-royd model and I remember editing it. It was really fun

2561
03:30:53,420 --> 03:30:55,980
I didn't even have like a character. I she just had a red hair

2562
03:30:56,780 --> 03:31:01,260
And like maroon hair and like a purple outfit. I can't remember like tan skin or whatever

2563
03:31:02,300 --> 03:31:03,580
um

2564
03:31:03,580 --> 03:31:09,420
I dived into the matrix during oh, yeah. No, I do my research. I like to be educated like when something happens

2565
03:31:09,500 --> 03:31:16,620
I'm immediately researching it. So like for example, that's a reman even star even star. I don't know perhaps her name um video

2566
03:31:17,340 --> 03:31:19,260
I was like

2567
03:31:19,260 --> 03:31:24,220
I didn't I haven't watched it yet. I saw the thumbnail and I'm like, oh looks like I have to go back in time and research

2568
03:31:24,300 --> 03:31:29,980
on what this was. So I watched like several different videos and looked at different um tweets and was like, huh interesting

2569
03:31:31,260 --> 03:31:35,900
I'm a secure. I'm just someone who just loves absorbing information and um

2570
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:43,100
Vtubing is definitely one of my special interests. So I will hyper fixie and try to learn everything there is about it. Um

2571
03:31:43,660 --> 03:31:45,660
Yes, I was before this

2572
03:31:45,660 --> 03:31:52,300
Yeah, I had so in order to apply to be a lurid you had to have um some sort of experience of streaming under your belt

2573
03:31:52,940 --> 03:31:54,780
um

2574
03:31:54,780 --> 03:31:55,820
and

2575
03:31:55,820 --> 03:32:00,940
The scrawny preferred a long lengthier amount of time and in my interview that's when I was like, oh, I actually

2576
03:32:01,020 --> 03:32:04,220
I've streamed five years before that. I've been in content creation for longer

2577
03:32:05,180 --> 03:32:07,500
But yeah, but I I went down that rabbit hole

2578
03:32:08,220 --> 03:32:09,340
um

2579
03:32:09,340 --> 03:32:11,820
But yeah, I like I love deep diving on the internet. Um

2580
03:32:12,780 --> 03:32:17,180
Another thing I'm just I they don't they don't know this. I'm just like mercy. I am a

2581
03:32:19,180 --> 03:32:21,180
Allude ASMR virgin

2582
03:32:23,260 --> 03:32:25,260
Um, I never made

2583
03:32:25,820 --> 03:32:29,740
audio content like that before. Um, I

2584
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:32,780
did like I teased a little bit

2585
03:32:33,260 --> 03:32:35,260
on stream

2586
03:32:35,420 --> 03:32:37,420
for my uh, my past life

2587
03:32:37,900 --> 03:32:42,220
And like tried to read like skirting the edge ns of w on twitch

2588
03:32:43,100 --> 03:32:45,100
and um

2589
03:32:45,980 --> 03:32:49,900
That I was like, but I'm like, you can't corrupt me. I'm already messed up

2590
03:32:50,540 --> 03:32:55,580
And the she forgets that the minimum that she said you could apply with was just drawing stuff

2591
03:32:55,580 --> 03:33:02,460
And I drew a lot of smut of my character and I commissioned a lot of smut art. I'm like, so um

2592
03:33:03,580 --> 03:33:06,060
And in my in my audition, I didn't even do anything

2593
03:33:06,300 --> 03:33:12,860
Uh, lewd. I was just like, hi, I'm redacted and this is my redacted for vealer

2594
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:18,620
Can you give us a sample of your ASMR? Well, you'll get that tomorrow

2595
03:33:19,180 --> 03:33:21,180
You can wait until tomorrow

2596
03:33:21,260 --> 03:33:23,740
Or you can I don't know go to my alt account or whatever

2597
03:33:25,580 --> 03:33:28,540
I hoping the alert is a male gen. I'm sorry that will never happen

2598
03:33:29,820 --> 03:33:33,660
And strani said it in her exposing vealer. We will not have a male gen

2599
03:33:34,540 --> 03:33:36,860
I'm sorry if you want to honestly

2600
03:33:37,820 --> 03:33:39,420
There is such

2601
03:33:39,420 --> 03:33:46,860
Like I think what will be cool about vealer is that people will be like, oh, yeah, that's right sex house and um

2602
03:33:47,580 --> 03:33:50,460
I won't be surprised if like like, uh

2603
03:33:51,900 --> 03:33:58,060
Not like needy, but like somebody out there with like a lot of money is like, you know what I want to make a male

2604
03:33:58,620 --> 03:34:01,580
um equivalent of vealer, um

2605
03:34:02,540 --> 03:34:09,740
But yeah, because people will be like, I know like people probably like, oh male gen because you want to make the content too, but like

2606
03:34:10,460 --> 03:34:11,980
um

2607
03:34:11,980 --> 03:34:14,540
people some viewers will anticipate like

2608
03:34:16,380 --> 03:34:18,540
Interacting like with um

2609
03:34:19,900 --> 03:34:21,900
talents from other gents and like

2610
03:34:22,700 --> 03:34:29,580
What's unique about vealer is that although we do the content that we do which is ASMR lewd roleplay content

2611
03:34:29,740 --> 03:34:31,740
We are also kind of

2612
03:34:32,140 --> 03:34:35,100
In the vein of japanese idol stuff because we don't

2613
03:34:36,220 --> 03:34:37,980
Talk to guys

2614
03:34:37,980 --> 03:34:39,980
And like they're fine and all um

2615
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:42,700
But also like

2616
03:34:42,700 --> 03:34:45,020
Like strani said in her exposing me a lure video

2617
03:34:45,580 --> 03:34:47,180
uh

2618
03:34:47,180 --> 03:34:49,180
She's not a dude

2619
03:34:49,420 --> 03:34:51,180
I don't like we can't

2620
03:34:51,180 --> 03:34:53,340
We can't the management company

2621
03:34:54,620 --> 03:34:57,340
Then strani can't they're not dudes like can't

2622
03:34:57,420 --> 03:35:03,740
How are they gonna advise dudes like if they're not dudes, you know, no femme boys

2623
03:35:04,140 --> 03:35:06,620
I'll be the the emmy could be your femme boy

2624
03:35:07,980 --> 03:35:09,740
Gender bent no

2625
03:35:09,740 --> 03:35:14,540
There's death. There's so many lewd tubers out there. So many lewd tubers

2626
03:35:14,940 --> 03:35:18,780
There's male lewd tubers that you can find that make that sort of content

2627
03:35:18,940 --> 03:35:23,100
So you're not gonna die if you don't get femme boys at vealer

2628
03:35:24,060 --> 03:35:28,700
Well, we're on the topic of the old stuff. Do you saw the cursed ass monkey and

2629
03:35:29,820 --> 03:35:31,820
I need everyone that yeah, I do

2630
03:35:33,660 --> 03:35:36,940
Wait, no, it's long this it's not on this though. Wait, can I

2631
03:35:39,340 --> 03:35:41,340
Hold up

2632
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:44,860
I don't know if it's I don't know if it's on this computer

2633
03:35:46,860 --> 03:35:49,260
I have a very funny picture of Ed Sheeran

2634
03:35:49,500 --> 03:35:53,020
Let's see if I can find it

2635
03:35:59,660 --> 03:36:03,820
This might take me a minute, please. Oh, oh shit. What the fuck?

2636
03:36:14,860 --> 03:36:16,860
Nope, nope, that's not it

2637
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:21,340
Oh

2638
03:36:22,860 --> 03:36:27,020
Guys, don't worry. It's worth it. It's just gonna take me a moment to find

2639
03:36:31,900 --> 03:36:41,340
Um, but as for like past life stuff, I'm I'm probably not going to talk about it. I know like, um

2640
03:36:45,660 --> 03:36:47,660
I know that

2641
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:50,860
I know that, um, Amy did but

2642
03:36:53,260 --> 03:36:55,260
That's

2643
03:36:55,260 --> 03:36:58,460
That that's another I'm moving on to a different chapter in my life

2644
03:36:58,540 --> 03:37:04,700
So I'm not really gonna brush on it. If you know, you know, if you don't then sucks because my past life was awesome

2645
03:37:05,500 --> 03:37:07,500
All right

2646
03:37:07,740 --> 03:37:10,620
Yeah, this is a great great image

2647
03:37:14,940 --> 03:37:16,940
What is that creature

2648
03:37:17,820 --> 03:37:19,820
I

2649
03:37:20,060 --> 03:37:22,060
It's Ed Sheeran

2650
03:37:22,540 --> 03:37:24,540
Okay, little monkey

2651
03:37:26,300 --> 03:37:33,500
All right, let me get rid of that. Um, yeah, we whatever you feel like doing is he coming or is he returning?

2652
03:37:35,020 --> 03:37:37,020
Is he returning an iPhone?

2653
03:37:38,860 --> 03:37:43,100
This is me every a psycho eyes. Yeah, you know, I don't like I want to know what picture

2654
03:37:43,740 --> 03:37:49,980
They took that from like obviously like they just like put his face on this person in an apple store wearing a monkey outfit

2655
03:37:50,300 --> 03:37:53,820
But I'm like where's it's like so well deep faked

2656
03:37:56,940 --> 03:37:58,220
Um

2657
03:37:58,220 --> 03:38:05,420
You do you mind diving into my past life? I'm not really any different to how I am now like my void like I was

2658
03:38:06,060 --> 03:38:09,100
I was um cute and funny in my past life

2659
03:38:09,900 --> 03:38:13,580
That's really the only difference, but like I did the same things

2660
03:38:14,220 --> 03:38:16,540
I'm still the same person. I'm just a little bit more

2661
03:38:17,340 --> 03:38:19,340
Dummy

2662
03:38:19,500 --> 03:38:21,500
Um

2663
03:38:22,700 --> 03:38:28,540
But all my content scrub, you don't you might be able to find a clip somewhere, but I doubt it

2664
03:38:29,740 --> 03:38:31,340
um

2665
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:33,340
Capacity of sheebie dunk of

2666
03:38:33,740 --> 03:38:35,740
basketball, no

2667
03:38:35,980 --> 03:38:37,500
too short

2668
03:38:37,580 --> 03:38:43,020
All I think I know about your past level you're supposed to be a brown cat girl, which is like 50% of youtubers. Yeah, literally

2669
03:38:43,980 --> 03:38:45,980
Cat girl, that's all you need to know

2670
03:38:47,500 --> 03:38:52,540
Can you do some green screens? It's mostly being oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be that'd be actually pretty smart to do

2671
03:38:53,020 --> 03:38:55,660
Um, I was thinking about that the other day because I was going through

2672
03:38:56,380 --> 03:38:58,460
Like the pictures I post I just take them on my phone

2673
03:38:59,740 --> 03:39:02,620
Um and vtube studio on my phone because I've exported my model

2674
03:39:03,260 --> 03:39:07,180
And I'm like, oh, I should use the green screen so people can like use them and put them in be like

2675
03:39:07,740 --> 03:39:09,740
Put them in silly memes

2676
03:39:11,820 --> 03:39:14,140
Same just a dump. Yeah, essentially and then I just make

2677
03:39:15,340 --> 03:39:16,940
naughty content

2678
03:39:16,940 --> 03:39:18,940
Check out my patreon

2679
03:39:18,940 --> 03:39:23,820
Um, can we get black hair sheebie probably do you get past life flashbacks?

2680
03:39:25,100 --> 03:39:32,860
Not really like I was a very small creator like I wasn't like emmy or anything. I was very unknown

2681
03:39:33,820 --> 03:39:36,540
Um, so that's why I'm even more thankful that I'm here

2682
03:39:36,860 --> 03:39:38,860
Like I'm very thankful that

2683
03:39:38,940 --> 03:39:42,860
scrawny picked me and nobody to be part of this

2684
03:39:43,740 --> 03:39:51,100
Because she saw something in me. She said she saw a 2.0 version of herself and that made me cry when she told me that in the interview

2685
03:39:51,580 --> 03:39:53,580
um

2686
03:39:54,220 --> 03:39:56,220
But uh, but yeah

2687
03:39:58,060 --> 03:40:00,060
Yeah, but

2688
03:40:00,300 --> 03:40:03,820
You don't okay, just because you don't have to talk about it

2689
03:40:04,620 --> 03:40:07,340
So that's that's the end of it. That's the end of the past life talk

2690
03:40:08,460 --> 03:40:10,460
She's she's gone

2691
03:40:11,100 --> 03:40:13,100
She's she's been let go

2692
03:40:14,540 --> 03:40:16,540
Because I'm determined to

2693
03:40:17,420 --> 03:40:19,420

An amazing place. I want like people are like, ah

2697
03:40:28,540 --> 03:40:35,980
Like how are these girls are going to be gone? You do not know how determined we are to make this like when you have a

2698
03:40:36,780 --> 03:40:38,780
person like

2699
03:40:39,420 --> 03:40:41,420
scrawny um

2700
03:40:41,500 --> 03:40:46,620
Heading things like you and like some of the reeflings know like you want to ride or die like

2701
03:40:47,900 --> 03:40:50,860
Uh, we're all so motivated to make vealer

2702
03:40:51,820 --> 03:40:53,820
amazing, um

2703
03:40:54,620 --> 03:40:55,820
Um

2704
03:40:55,820 --> 03:41:02,780
And we're like, oh, they're gonna have woman moments. Oh, they're gonna. Yeah. Oh like but we all got good heads on our shoulders

2705
03:41:03,740 --> 03:41:09,580
Um, I'm really proud of the other girls how like mature and talented they are

2706
03:41:11,020 --> 03:41:13,020
vealer is not here

2707
03:41:14,220 --> 03:41:17,340
For a short time. We are here for a long time and a good time

2708
03:41:19,500 --> 03:41:21,500
And uh, yeah

2709
03:41:21,820 --> 03:41:23,820
You can freaking clip this

2710
03:41:24,540 --> 03:41:27,900
And really you could you'd be like, oh, let me clip this so that

2711
03:41:28,780 --> 03:41:30,940
We see if his age is terribly it won't

2712
03:41:31,980 --> 03:41:33,980
It won't we have so much stuff planned

2713
03:41:35,260 --> 03:41:38,780
Can't wait. I'm so excited. I'm so happy to be here. You guys have no idea

2714
03:41:41,180 --> 03:41:44,380
Um yapping is literally what we want. Yeah, I'm here to get

2715
03:41:45,340 --> 03:41:49,100
All the ladies seem absolutely fantastically. This would be not an exception. Thank you. I appreciate that

2716
03:41:50,060 --> 03:41:52,060
Um and even like

2717
03:41:52,460 --> 03:41:57,340
Like again, like I said, I was small. I was a small vtuber people

2718
03:41:57,580 --> 03:42:00,540
I had like maybe like max 20 people watching me

2719
03:42:01,100 --> 03:42:06,780
I already feel like I've succeeded. It was my goal to be in a in a corpo. It was my goal to join an agency

2720
03:42:07,660 --> 03:42:09,420
and I didn't

2721
03:42:09,420 --> 03:42:12,860
I didn't expect to have 11k views on my baby like that

2722
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:19,900
Boggled my mind like I never thought people would actually want to watch me and that people thought I'd be entertaining, you know

2723
03:42:21,020 --> 03:42:26,460
But I'm I'm just happy. I make you happy and I'm happy that you find me entertaining and the other girls are entertaining

2724
03:42:27,100 --> 03:42:31,660
Like I like watching the girls like again, like I said, I don't usually watch a lot of vtubers

2725
03:42:31,740 --> 03:42:36,620
But I will sit and watch strawny for hours. I was watching her a little bit. I was watching icy

2726
03:42:37,500 --> 03:42:39,980
Is there like they're all such wonderful entertainers to

2727
03:42:40,700 --> 03:42:42,700
She really picked good ones

2728
03:42:43,100 --> 03:42:44,220
Um

2729
03:42:44,220 --> 03:42:49,180
So I didn't read his character till I should be yeah, I remember. Yeah, uh, somebody like asked if I um

2730
03:42:51,180 --> 03:42:53,740
I'll I'll give you some all exposed to be alert some more

2731
03:42:55,100 --> 03:42:57,100
I'll tell you who we all went for

2732
03:42:57,420 --> 03:42:59,020
um

2733
03:42:59,020 --> 03:43:04,940
In terms of models and how it ended up being so much better that we didn't get who we wanted

2734
03:43:07,260 --> 03:43:09,180
Um

2735
03:43:09,180 --> 03:43:10,620
so

2736
03:43:10,700 --> 03:43:15,020
Again, like as I mentioned, I was I was cute and funny in my past life. So I went for

2737
03:43:16,300 --> 03:43:19,740
Pins I went for well, I didn't go for like anybody in particular

2738
03:43:19,820 --> 03:43:25,180
But I was hoping for like I said, please give me anybody but I was hoping for pins aka emi

2739
03:43:26,460 --> 03:43:27,900
um

2740
03:43:27,900 --> 03:43:29,900
And it's funny because emi

2741
03:43:29,900 --> 03:43:36,700
I think was going for mercy and mercy was going for icy and icy was going for emi and azura was just azura

2742
03:43:36,700 --> 03:43:40,300
Because she's just perfect for azura and then strani strani, but it was just funny

2743
03:43:40,700 --> 03:43:43,180
And then we're all here and we're all looking at each other and we're all like

2744
03:43:43,980 --> 03:43:46,540
I wouldn't want it any other way. Like I feel

2745
03:43:47,420 --> 03:43:51,580
Really good being she be and everybody else is so good

2746
03:43:52,700 --> 03:43:54,300
being

2747
03:43:54,300 --> 03:43:56,300
their respective

2748
03:43:56,540 --> 03:44:00,540
People and we're still like learning about ourselves and like getting into the characters and like

2749
03:44:01,100 --> 03:44:05,260
Getting the kayfabe and like we're still like so thank you for your patience with us

2750
03:44:05,340 --> 03:44:09,500
And yeah, like I think it worked out in the end. I hundred percent worked out in the end. Um

2751
03:44:10,860 --> 03:44:13,100
You cute and funny what you don't

2752
03:44:14,140 --> 03:44:19,420
You don't think I can be going funny. I don't be really going funny. I don't know what you're talking about

2753
03:44:24,380 --> 03:44:26,380
My mom

2754
03:44:26,620 --> 03:44:32,060
Yeah, it's gonna take something like I can't wait. We're gonna learn we're gonna grow and we'll make mistakes

2755
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:34,460
And we'll learn from those mistakes

2756
03:44:35,340 --> 03:44:38,380
And we'll take the feedback. We'll take the critique

2757
03:44:39,100 --> 03:44:41,820
We'll take the trolling with a grain of salt, but like

2758
03:44:43,340 --> 03:44:48,300
I just I can't wait to see where we'll be a year from now because in a year gen two

2759
03:44:49,580 --> 03:44:51,180
gen two

2760
03:44:51,180 --> 03:44:53,180
Maybe after that gen three

2761
03:44:54,060 --> 03:44:56,060
I just want to help strani build like just

2762
03:44:57,100 --> 03:44:58,380
realize

2763
03:44:58,380 --> 03:45:00,380
her dream and then

2764
03:45:01,340 --> 03:45:04,540
This is a dream of mine to be part of something bigger

2765
03:45:05,420 --> 03:45:07,420
You know

2766
03:45:07,980 --> 03:45:10,620
I think I always stop pretending. It was a crab game shooting in the goth

2767
03:45:13,900 --> 03:45:19,020
And then one year two fast no actually like what I've noticed recently is a lot of

2768
03:45:19,580 --> 03:45:25,980
Companies have been putting out generations like six months after and I'm like I thought that was too fast

2769
03:45:26,460 --> 03:45:28,220
um

2770
03:45:28,220 --> 03:45:34,060
And I think a year for v2 like the first generation to get it established is pretty good

2771
03:45:34,860 --> 03:45:36,860
um

2772
03:45:37,180 --> 03:45:40,620
So no, she's an investor detail is an investor

2773
03:45:41,900 --> 03:45:43,100
She's an investor

2774
03:45:43,100 --> 03:45:47,580
Sean is our creative director. We have management. We got editors like we have this whole team behind us

2775
03:45:49,420 --> 03:45:52,380
Um, I feel like six months. It's hard to get established

2776
03:45:53,340 --> 03:45:55,340
as a

2777
03:45:55,340 --> 03:45:57,340
especially like a first gen um

2778
03:45:58,060 --> 03:46:00,060
So I'm happy we have a year

2779
03:46:00,220 --> 03:46:02,220
And like another thing

2780
03:46:02,300 --> 03:46:06,700
But then you can argue like okay, if you've been streaming longer before that in your past life

2781
03:46:06,700 --> 03:46:09,980
Which most have been like because let's be honest a lot of the

2782
03:46:10,940 --> 03:46:12,460
people in

2783
03:46:12,460 --> 03:46:17,100
corpos and agencies right now are already formal corpo and agency girls like

2784
03:46:17,900 --> 03:46:20,780
Ex Sundaria members x this x that

2785
03:46:21,340 --> 03:46:27,900
Um, so they already have that stuff under their belt. So it kind of makes sense when they go into another company and they're like

2786
03:46:28,860 --> 03:46:33,340
Okay, you're good. And then they send another like sick because there hasn't been like I think

2787
03:46:34,620 --> 03:46:37,420
Villalur and even like you may plus have been

2788
03:46:38,220 --> 03:46:39,580
uh

2789
03:46:39,580 --> 03:46:41,580
in recent

2790
03:46:41,580 --> 03:46:48,380
Years like the only companies to hire brand new girls if that makes sense because like

2791
03:46:49,580 --> 03:46:55,500
None of us like none of the girls in Villalur are former corpo like we've all been indies before that

2792
03:46:55,740 --> 03:46:58,380
So then we all really worked really hard to be

2793
03:46:59,260 --> 03:47:01,260
in Villalur, so

2794
03:47:02,380 --> 03:47:04,380
Yeah, Jenny it doesn't seem so

2795
03:47:05,180 --> 03:47:07,180
Yeah, um

2796
03:47:07,500 --> 03:47:09,500
it you know

2797
03:47:09,740 --> 03:47:12,700
It really depends I think it really depends on the company

2798
03:47:13,100 --> 03:47:19,020
I know some people like beg for second gents because to be honest they probably get bored of um

2799
03:47:20,620 --> 03:47:24,860
The other gen or they're just like okay. This gen isn't my cup of tea

2800
03:47:25,660 --> 03:47:30,540
Can I please get another one? And so I think that's another reason why companies put out

2801
03:47:31,260 --> 03:47:35,500
Agencies so fast because they just want to appeal to the masses which is not what you should

2802
03:47:35,820 --> 03:47:40,940
Which is well, of course is like you should appeal to them, but you can't just accelerate in your company

2803
03:47:42,940 --> 03:47:47,100
Just try to find try to hit like one person correctly

2804
03:47:47,820 --> 03:47:49,820
that everybody likes

2805
03:47:50,140 --> 03:47:53,420
You know ball gen one. I know I want to get a bald toggle. It's like

2806
03:47:54,140 --> 03:47:56,140
And this is my ears

2807
03:47:57,420 --> 03:48:00,140
Very embryo glad hearing voices. Yeah, I like was

2808
03:48:01,180 --> 03:48:08,460
Really worried I wasn't gonna get into Villalur because I wasn't a former agency girl and like I'll say this

2809
03:48:09,900 --> 03:48:15,580
So like I mentioned in my 2.0. I applied for like 10 different auditions several different companies

2810
03:48:16,220 --> 03:48:18,060
um

2811
03:48:18,060 --> 03:48:23,020
And honestly it was kind of stupid of me to apply those companies because at that point I didn't have any

2812
03:48:23,980 --> 03:48:27,660
V2 being experience only normal streaming experience. So I um

2813
03:48:28,300 --> 03:48:31,340
This is kind of they're like why is this flesh person applying?

2814
03:48:33,100 --> 03:48:37,740
Um, and then I applied as appeal to a couple of them and it's funny because then I like I look at like

2815
03:48:38,620 --> 03:48:40,620
like I applied to vnu

2816
03:48:41,260 --> 03:48:43,340
And I look and I'm like

2817
03:48:43,340 --> 03:48:47,740
You know, I'm kind of happy I didn't get in because they fit their characters so well, you know

2818
03:48:48,780 --> 03:48:52,780
And um same for like idle and stuff. I applied to idle. Um

2819
03:48:53,500 --> 03:48:55,500
and I was like

2820
03:48:55,500 --> 03:49:00,700
I don't see myself like they're everybody like fits their people so well, you know

2821
03:49:01,580 --> 03:49:06,300
It's hard to see them as anybody else or see myself as one like oh, I could have been a better version

2822
03:49:06,380 --> 03:49:08,460
like I don't I don't ever really say that because

2823
03:49:09,740 --> 03:49:11,420
yeah

2824
03:49:11,420 --> 03:49:16,460
Most industries are passing around the same people especially entertainment though. Yeah, there's always a thing of like nepotism

2825
03:49:16,940 --> 03:49:18,620
um

2826
03:49:18,620 --> 03:49:20,140
I know

2827
03:49:20,140 --> 03:49:22,140
Yeah, like a lot of companies

2828
03:49:22,940 --> 03:49:27,900
Usually like we'll have their talents vouch for other like indies or a talents from like

2829
03:49:28,620 --> 03:49:34,620
Former talents from companies and stuff. So it's like, yeah, it's pretty common in the um in the entertainment industry

2830
03:49:37,020 --> 03:49:39,740
Clapping with no handlebars one, excuse me

2831
03:49:42,140 --> 03:49:44,140
She be as Kai

2832
03:49:44,780 --> 03:49:46,780
um

2833
03:49:46,860 --> 03:49:51,660
This is a very long invitation to show business. Yeah, like what I like what really attracted me

2834
03:49:52,300 --> 03:49:53,340
to

2835
03:49:53,340 --> 03:49:57,420
Vila and honestly just like straw knees ideas in general was that she isn't

2836
03:49:58,540 --> 03:49:59,500
Uh

2837
03:49:59,500 --> 03:50:03,100
She's kind of breaking the mold to my voice is cracking

2838
03:50:03,820 --> 03:50:08,060
Of some btuber standards like for example, she doesn't care if we talk about our past lives

2839
03:50:08,460 --> 03:50:14,460
So that's why and we talked about hers and you probably already know the other girls past lives and I know some of you know mine, but um

2840
03:50:15,420 --> 03:50:19,180
Uh because it's like taboo normally to do that. Um

2841
03:50:20,380 --> 03:50:25,980
Or just like having a collab ban for the first week like I could collab with an indy tomorrow

2842
03:50:27,020 --> 03:50:35,340
But I'm settling in a she be first. So that's why I haven't done that indy or another kropa girl tomorrow. Um, also like in terms of

2843
03:50:36,700 --> 03:50:40,780
The transparency with how much they pay us like all that stuff

2844
03:50:41,340 --> 03:50:45,660
Do you know I know your past lives? Yes. I do know who you were

2845
03:50:46,540 --> 03:50:50,700
I'll do I'll do like a past life regression stream where I just

2846
03:50:52,620 --> 03:50:55,420
Pretend to spiritually know who you were in a past life

2847
03:50:57,580 --> 03:50:59,820
How can you get a job experience though getting hard? Yeah

2848
03:51:00,540 --> 03:51:03,660
That's not yeah, it's like that thing where companies are like

2849
03:51:03,820 --> 03:51:07,260
Oh, you must have eight years of this and the company's only been open

2850
03:51:07,660 --> 03:51:10,220
Like or the industry's only been around for like two years

2851
03:51:11,980 --> 03:51:15,340
So like it kind of does make sense that there is a lot of nepotism in the industry

2852
03:51:16,460 --> 03:51:18,460
You know because they're like, oh this person

2853
03:51:19,020 --> 03:51:23,740
Wants to join a corporation their former agency kind of you know, shit the bed

2854
03:51:24,300 --> 03:51:28,220
Let's give them another chance. We've seen their content. They know how to do this this and that

2855
03:51:28,380 --> 03:51:31,980
So like it makes it it is like business wise

2856
03:51:32,460 --> 03:51:34,300
It makes a lot more sense

2857
03:51:34,300 --> 03:51:37,020
To do that instead of like a bunch of nobodies like

2858
03:51:38,620 --> 03:51:40,380
Like me

2859
03:51:40,380 --> 03:51:42,380
I could have been completely crazy

2860
03:51:42,460 --> 03:51:44,460
I still am crazy

2861
03:51:45,500 --> 03:51:49,260
Was I a frog? Uh, no, you were a salamander. Sorry

2862
03:51:51,500 --> 03:51:53,500

Especially with like how we communicate nowadays

2877
03:52:50,940 --> 03:52:52,940
It's like social media

2878
03:52:52,940 --> 03:52:54,940
Hello, I'm an anime girl right now

2879
03:52:55,660 --> 03:52:57,660
Um

2880
03:52:57,820 --> 03:52:59,420
and

2881
03:52:59,420 --> 03:53:01,420
I wish someone would touch my tism

2882
03:53:02,460 --> 03:53:03,660
um

2883
03:53:03,660 --> 03:53:05,660
and like honestly

2884
03:53:06,220 --> 03:53:10,540
A lot of like we know a lot more about mental health now anyways like

2885
03:53:11,100 --> 03:53:17,740
Like my dad, for example, like he a hundred percent probably is adult ADHD because I am my carbon copy of my dad

2886
03:53:18,460 --> 03:53:20,460
I'm just woman form

2887
03:53:21,500 --> 03:53:24,380
We are exactly like I have something called adjustment disorder

2888
03:53:24,940 --> 03:53:26,940
As well and he definitely probably has it

2889
03:53:27,500 --> 03:53:30,700
And I'm like if I get tested for ADHD and I have it

2890
03:53:30,700 --> 03:53:34,620
And I know my dad has it because I didn't really know about that stuff back then, you know

2891
03:53:35,340 --> 03:53:35,900
um

2892
03:53:35,900 --> 03:53:39,340
I used to work in human services and all the people I used to support were

2893
03:53:40,460 --> 03:53:46,220
Institutionalized for the longest time because he didn't understand these poor amazing people and how they just work differently

2894
03:53:47,900 --> 03:53:49,420
Will they form

2895
03:53:49,420 --> 03:53:51,500
Every day I see something that makes me want to get tested for autism

2896
03:53:51,740 --> 03:53:57,180
Yeah, and then on the other hand, there's a lot of people that like self-diagnose when they are like kind of put on

2897
03:53:57,820 --> 03:53:59,820
stuff so that they can feel

2898
03:54:00,700 --> 03:54:03,660
quirky with the label, but you know, that's another conversation

2899
03:54:04,380 --> 03:54:06,140
um

2900
03:54:06,140 --> 03:54:08,140
Daddy Davey when

2901
03:54:09,340 --> 03:54:12,780
I don't know probably I'll probably I think like strawnee said she'll

2902
03:54:13,740 --> 03:54:18,060
She'll have her dad or in record a video with him about like guessing vtuber names

2903
03:54:18,540 --> 03:54:22,220
And I might I might yoink that idea and do that as well after her

2904
03:54:23,180 --> 03:54:30,540
I took a google quiz and it said so and I took that like I don't know what's called. Is it like rad's test to test you for autism?

2905
03:54:31,420 --> 03:54:33,180
because my chat

2906
03:54:33,180 --> 03:54:37,500
In my past life was convinced. I had autism. I don't have autism

2907
03:54:38,220 --> 03:54:43,260
Um, I just really like slime. Okay? Um, and I get distracted easily

2908
03:54:44,620 --> 03:54:46,380
um

2909
03:54:46,460 --> 03:54:52,860
And I did that test and I scored like 104 which is like high and they're like medium indications of autism

2910
03:54:52,860 --> 03:54:54,860
I was like I literally was like

2911
03:54:56,060 --> 03:54:59,500
I was like non-verbal for like two minutes because I'm like wait do I have autism

2912
03:55:00,380 --> 03:55:03,900
Then I'm like no no no it's like these silly things on the internet the like you're like

2913
03:55:07,260 --> 03:55:11,420
Everyone loves slime slime is awesome. I have I have like a bunch of slime. Where did my slime go?

2914
03:55:12,620 --> 03:55:14,620
It's on my it's on my bookshelf

2915
03:55:15,580 --> 03:55:21,500
Um, definitely like slime stream slime ASMR stream. Um, I'm just chat is so cool

2916
03:55:23,020 --> 03:55:27,820
Uh, yeah, I I do have a zoomer energy. I do have a zoomer interests. I um

2917
03:55:28,620 --> 03:55:30,620
despite being a high

2918
03:55:31,580 --> 03:55:36,140
We stay sliming we sliming up in here. That's why I'm begging for a slime girl for gen 2

2919
03:55:37,180 --> 03:55:40,380
because strani's already conceptualizing stuff and

2920
03:55:41,340 --> 03:55:45,020
I've seen some of the concepts and you guys are not ready

2921
03:55:47,020 --> 03:55:51,020
And I'm just like but um, can we please go slime girl?

2922
03:55:54,780 --> 03:55:59,500
No, what hell you don't need today. No, I don't know, you know, I could just be quirky. I could just be weird

2923
03:56:00,380 --> 03:56:02,380
I could just be odd

2924
03:56:03,100 --> 03:56:05,100
Sometimes you're just

2925
03:56:05,260 --> 03:56:07,260
you're just

2926
03:56:08,220 --> 03:56:10,220
A little bit different than

2927
03:56:11,260 --> 03:56:15,500
Society's expectations and but that doesn't also mean you have something, you know

2928
03:56:16,700 --> 03:56:18,700
hag love

2929
03:56:19,340 --> 03:56:21,340

I also want like a vor chuba. I mean what?

2931
03:56:26,700 --> 03:56:28,700
There's a lot of like, uh

2932
03:56:29,180 --> 03:56:31,180
Tags and kinks. I think that would be funny

2933
03:56:31,980 --> 03:56:33,980
for that sort of stuff

2934
03:56:34,380 --> 03:56:36,380
We love older women hag love

Some people are just not like the other girls. I know, right? Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline. Eat me mommy

2938
03:56:54,780 --> 03:56:56,780
My face went funny there

2939
03:56:57,820 --> 03:57:00,380
She was on that deviant art, you know, I was on that deviant art, bro

2940
03:57:01,340 --> 03:57:07,100
Although I was on deviant art because I was making really cool photo manipulations of dogs and wolves because

2941
03:57:07,980 --> 03:57:09,740
that was weird

2942
03:57:09,740 --> 03:57:11,740
and I was an avid wolf role player for

2943
03:57:13,420 --> 03:57:15,420
10 years

2944
03:57:17,420 --> 03:57:19,580
I'm saying make myself sound older than I am

2945
03:57:21,260 --> 03:57:23,260
No, it wasn't 10 years. It's more like

2946
03:57:25,100 --> 03:57:27,740
We love a drop of yado vtuber and my life is yours

2947
03:57:28,700 --> 03:57:35,420
Wolf of rabbit's clothing. Yeah furry affectionate. Uh, I probably was a furry, but I don't think I want

2948
03:57:35,420 --> 03:57:40,860
I just really liked post-by-post role play like I'd be on like role players guild and stuff because I like to write a lot

2949
03:57:41,420 --> 03:57:44,860
I love my creative writing class in school. And so I just um

2950
03:57:46,460 --> 03:57:47,580
I

2951
03:57:47,580 --> 03:57:51,100
I was on this website called like wet paint, which is like

2952
03:57:51,980 --> 03:57:55,420
Site hosting place and a lot of people did like role play like whether it be like warrior cats

2953
03:57:55,820 --> 03:57:59,340
Or like human role plays gifted role plays. Um, all that stuff

2954
03:58:00,620 --> 03:58:03,660
And I was in a lot of like wolf, uh role plays

2955
03:58:04,380 --> 03:58:06,220
and dude

2956
03:58:06,220 --> 03:58:11,020
I thought those were my golden years. I was no life and I think pewter for like eight hours or day

2957
03:58:11,100 --> 03:58:16,780
Just being a wolf, but it was just cool because I know I was I like I'm not only child. Um, so I had

2958
03:58:17,580 --> 03:58:20,060
No one to talk to you. I still just hung out on the internet all the time

2959
03:58:21,260 --> 03:58:23,420
and just did uh role play stuff

2960
03:58:24,380 --> 03:58:26,380
Howling at the moon. Oh

2961
03:58:27,340 --> 03:58:29,820
On all levels except physical. I am a wolf

2962
03:58:33,100 --> 03:58:38,700
Um, but I remember one of my favorite things about wolf role playing was, um

2963
03:58:40,220 --> 03:58:42,220
Oh dude

2964
03:58:42,700 --> 03:58:44,700
First of all wolf quest

2965
03:58:44,780 --> 03:58:49,260
Wolf quest learning that side note learning that doki bird played wolf quest

2966
03:58:49,740 --> 03:58:55,740
Made my life because I thought I was like the only one that played wolf quest. It was funny on my pl

2967
03:58:55,820 --> 03:58:57,820
I had played wolf quest like, um

2968
03:58:57,820 --> 03:59:00,140
Like a couple months before she did and I was just like

2969
03:59:01,820 --> 03:59:06,220
Because I used to do role playing on wolf quest. That was a gay. Oh, well, we're gonna play wolf quest

2970
03:59:06,780 --> 03:59:09,260
I have wolf quest we're playing it. Um

2971
03:59:10,060 --> 03:59:13,660
And now you tell other people to bark for you exactly. I still told people to bark for me back then

2972
03:59:14,220 --> 03:59:20,700
Wolf quest the real origin one went. I know right. Um, but uh

2973
03:59:22,540 --> 03:59:24,540
I know it was a g

2974
03:59:28,220 --> 03:59:29,900
But um

2975
03:59:29,900 --> 03:59:33,100
I used to do this it was called it's gonna make it sound like I did a drug

2976
03:59:33,340 --> 03:59:37,980
But we there was a type of role playing called speed

2977
03:59:38,940 --> 03:59:43,660
So speed role playing was one sentence post by post role playing

2978
03:59:43,980 --> 03:59:46,460
But you had you would get hits

2979
03:59:47,340 --> 03:59:53,180
On the other character because it was it was like fighting you get hits on the other character by how fast you type

2980
03:59:53,180 --> 03:59:55,180
So if I managed to um

2981
03:59:55,740 --> 04:00:00,540
Type faster than you did a sentence of me doing an act and you took damage then I then I beat you

2982
04:00:01,020 --> 04:00:06,140
Um, and then there's like a certain amount of hits you would do and different like you had a cross distance

2983
04:00:06,860 --> 04:00:11,020
um, and you had to I show speed and you had to um

2984
04:00:11,900 --> 04:00:16,540
Uh, like get certain holds like I remember it was like eight

2985
04:00:17,980 --> 04:00:19,980
Hits to break a spine

2986
04:00:20,300 --> 04:00:22,300
or like six hits to

2987
04:00:23,340 --> 04:00:26,060
Get the throw and you could like throw people off. It was really fun

2988
04:00:27,180 --> 04:00:30,140
Um, so I had like a hundred plus word per minute

2989
04:00:31,340 --> 04:00:33,340
Yeah, it was really it was actually

2990
04:00:33,900 --> 04:00:36,540
In Minecraft. Yes, of course in Minecraft. It was really fun

2991
04:00:36,620 --> 04:00:40,940
I think that was like I I prided myself on being such a fast fucking typer

2992
04:00:41,820 --> 04:00:43,340
um

2993
04:00:43,340 --> 04:00:48,620
I can't do it now though. I think my words per minute is probably only like 60 or less than that

2994
04:00:49,660 --> 04:00:51,660
Punchy. Yeah, I was running around punching people in the spine

2995
04:00:54,060 --> 04:00:57,500
Um, I think what I liked about role playing as well

2996
04:00:57,580 --> 04:01:04,140
It was like I could take out aggression because we would raid other packs and go on their website and raid their chats

2997
04:01:04,220 --> 04:01:06,220
and just start fucking marking people

2998
04:01:06,700 --> 04:01:08,220
out I

2999
04:01:08,220 --> 04:01:11,500
I killed children. I killed pregnant children pregnant children

3000
04:01:12,140 --> 04:01:17,500
I killed pregnant wolves and I killed children. I took lives blood in my ma

3001
04:01:18,780 --> 04:01:20,540
um

3002
04:01:20,540 --> 04:01:24,220
But uh, what do you think of your chat? Um, I get

3003
04:01:25,180 --> 04:01:28,940
I I'm also like mercy and I get can get motion sick. So I can't do VR

3004
04:01:29,020 --> 04:01:33,500
So VR chat like I've done it without VR headset, but it still makes me a little bit dizzy

3005
04:01:34,540 --> 04:01:36,540
Not the young links

3006
04:01:36,940 --> 04:01:41,980
Um, but yeah, I was I remember the crafting really cool stories. I think I have like

3007
04:01:43,500 --> 04:01:50,620
I think oh, maybe I could like log into my super fucking old email and try it because I remember I saved some posts

3008
04:01:51,340 --> 04:01:56,620
Of um some role plays that I did with my friend. Um, because we had like our ocs in your role play with each other

3009
04:01:57,420 --> 04:01:58,940
and then

3010
04:01:58,940 --> 04:02:02,860
We had like a almost like a john carter esque like princess of mars

3011
04:02:03,420 --> 04:02:06,220
role play. It was really funny. Um, and then

3012
04:02:07,260 --> 04:02:10,380
Like I think I had one of like a really dramatic

3013
04:02:11,900 --> 04:02:14,060
Posts of like my wolf character dying

3014
04:02:15,820 --> 04:02:19,980
Um, but I yeah, no, I I I really miss that because I love creative writing

3015
04:02:19,980 --> 04:02:27,820
I would I remember my dad um said that and my mom were like, oh, she's gonna grow up to be an author and that did not happen

3016
04:02:29,180 --> 04:02:30,460
but um

3017
04:02:30,460 --> 04:02:34,540
Yeah, writing's fun reading's fun for me. I haven't done any of that stuff in a bit though. I've been

3018
04:02:35,500 --> 04:02:39,900
It just sucks when you get like older and like real stuff gets in the way, you know

3019
04:02:40,700 --> 04:02:43,900
Like life adulting. I'm like, oh, I have to have a job

3020
04:02:44,620 --> 04:02:46,620
Oh, I have to pay bills

3021
04:02:46,700 --> 04:02:50,700
Oh, I have to take care of my health and well-being

3022
04:02:51,740 --> 04:02:58,060
I can't just rot away. I'm like what I'd give to be like 10 again. Just do fuck all, you know

3023
04:03:01,260 --> 04:03:04,060
If you dig john carter read jane carver of war interesting

3024
04:03:05,100 --> 04:03:10,460
Does she we have a bunny? Yeah, I have a bunny tail. You can't see it on my model

3025
04:03:11,500 --> 04:03:13,500
But I do have a bunny tail

3026
04:03:13,820 --> 04:03:15,820
Oh

3027
04:03:16,140 --> 04:03:21,500
Yeah, adulting does suck. I hate adulting like I was um, I was talking about my alt this morning

3028
04:03:21,500 --> 04:03:24,220
I had to like go to the bank because I lost my bank card

3029
04:03:24,620 --> 04:03:29,260
I'm like, I need I'm late on my rent and the banks were closed over the weekend

3030
04:03:29,660 --> 04:03:32,940
And I couldn't pay my rent and then it still wouldn't work

3031
04:03:33,020 --> 04:03:37,180
So then I had to write a check and then I had to remember how to write a check and I'm like, uh

3032
04:03:38,780 --> 04:03:40,780
Being an adult

My parents just like started entering into their 50s. Um

3049
04:04:35,020 --> 04:04:37,260
Ha that still doesn't give away how old I am

You don't know how old my parents were when they had me so fuck you. Um

3062
04:05:21,020 --> 04:05:22,700

um

3065
04:05:29,980 --> 04:05:31,980
I like being honest with you guys, but um

3066
04:05:33,500 --> 04:05:39,260
When you're always down, you kind of don't see a future so you don't work on your future. So like I didn't

3067
04:05:40,780 --> 04:05:42,380
Really focus on

3068
04:05:42,380 --> 04:05:47,580
Like going to college a lot and focus on this and I focused on that. I didn't like pick up certain skills

3069
04:05:48,300 --> 04:05:50,300
um

3070
04:05:51,020 --> 04:05:52,220
But

3071
04:05:52,220 --> 04:05:57,980
In hindsight and like and obviously like hindsight's always 2020 like I wish I wish I could like give my little younger self a hug

3072
04:05:57,980 --> 04:06:02,780
And be like you're fine. I know you have severe social anxiety and you can't talk to people

3073
04:06:03,340 --> 04:06:07,900
Um, but you're gonna be okay and now you're talking to hundreds of people on the internet

3074
04:06:08,700 --> 04:06:11,740
And they like to watch you and talk about stuff. Um

3075
04:06:13,100 --> 04:06:20,140
But but you know things change and I'm I hope the same for you guys like if you're um

I don't know why I'm being motivational, but there's light at the end of the tunnel

3081
04:06:39,980 --> 04:06:41,980
You just have to find something that you want to

3082
04:06:42,620 --> 04:06:44,620
Work and live for for me. It's my cats

3083

To like have me find an interest that wasn't being on the computer and doing games

And doing an activity to keep me engaged being an only child and everything then like

3122
04:09:09,340 --> 04:09:11,820
Get something for herself

3123

to be honest

3124
04:09:14,220 --> 04:09:15,820

04:09:37,820 --> 04:09:39,820
To give back

To my parents, you know

3132
04:09:41,900 --> 04:09:46,700
They were like, why are you a whore and you have such a good relationship to your parents? I don't know

3133
04:09:49,580 --> 04:09:51,580
It's always the christian girls, is it?

3134
04:09:52,860 --> 04:09:54,860
When you're hyper repressed

3135
04:09:55,580 --> 04:09:57,580
This is what happens

3136
04:10:00,140 --> 04:10:01,580
Boney

3137
04:10:01,580 --> 04:10:06,140
Hey, stop fucking fighting for you. Hold on my cats have all just woken up and they're just fighting each other now

3138
04:10:06,460 --> 04:10:08,460
Raina, I need to put you up to

3139
04:10:09,980 --> 04:10:13,020
Stop what are you doing to her?

3140
04:10:15,820 --> 04:10:18,140
Don't get dick. She's trying to sleep

3141
04:10:21,580 --> 04:10:23,580
Going

3142
04:10:27,580 --> 04:10:31,980
Wait, where's the score bottle because I know who he's already acting up. He's gonna start

3143
04:10:31,980 --> 04:10:33,980
I

3144
04:10:41,260 --> 04:10:43,260
Don't like

3145
04:10:44,540 --> 04:10:47,740
She is just like screams. He probably heard her like

3146
04:10:49,180 --> 04:10:51,180
Like making funny noises in the background going

3147
04:10:53,100 --> 04:10:56,060
Because he's like was biting her throat. I'm like, dude, you're killing her

3148
04:10:57,100 --> 04:11:00,460
He could he just plays too rough because he's he's my he's my first male cat

3149
04:11:00,460 --> 04:11:04,140
I've ever had I've only grown up with like female cats and I'm like, oh god

3150
04:11:04,380 --> 04:11:06,780
Maybe I should get another male cat. So he has someone to like

3151
04:11:07,340 --> 04:11:10,220
wrestle with because rain is like 14 years old she

3152
04:11:10,860 --> 04:11:13,820
But she she's the she runs this shit. I'll tell you that much

3153
04:11:14,780 --> 04:11:16,540
Fia's the baby

3154
04:11:16,540 --> 04:11:20,460
Boomi just turned a year old and fia just turned a year old. Um, but fia's

3155
04:11:21,100 --> 04:11:26,620
Much smaller. I think because of the issue she had with her like not being able to move and walk her

3156
04:11:27,580 --> 04:11:31,020
Her like muscles astrophied and she was she's really really small

3157
04:11:31,100 --> 04:11:35,420
Like she's literally the same size when she was a kitten. So Boomi just fucking beats the shit out of her

3158
04:11:35,500 --> 04:11:38,460
So I have to there's like a clip out there somewhere of like Boomi like

3159
04:11:39,820 --> 04:11:46,780
slamming her on the ground. Um, well, I had a cat cam on it was so sad. It was like

3160
04:11:49,820 --> 04:11:54,300
Far cats is like, oh, I'm getting myself bigger when I'm trying to scroll up. Uh, whatever

3161
04:11:55,260 --> 04:11:57,740
You be issues don't include Bonnie issues

3162
04:12:00,300 --> 04:12:04,940
No, I got you, you know, I got I got my mommy and daddy issues. I'm not telling you any of that stuff though

3163
04:12:07,500 --> 04:12:09,500
Religious trauma

3164
04:12:10,540 --> 04:12:15,340
Cat Jen when I hope we get a cat girl for next time. That'd be cool. Like a pet play girl

3165
04:12:15,820 --> 04:12:18,380
Ooh, a pet play girl would be so good

3166
04:12:19,420 --> 04:12:21,420
Because I'll be honest with you

3167
04:12:21,980 --> 04:12:23,980
I didn't when I first saw

3168
04:12:24,540 --> 04:12:25,500
um

3169
04:12:25,500 --> 04:12:28,460
My model I had the same idea as you I didn't know

3170
04:12:29,100 --> 04:12:33,900
If I was gonna be a dummy mommy because I'm like, oh, she's wearing shabari. Maybe she's like a rope bunny

3171
04:12:34,620 --> 04:12:36,620
Submissive so like I totally get it

3172
04:12:36,700 --> 04:12:41,980
I'm like, oh like well, I have a pet play angle and then she'd be like she'd be strong. He's like no

3173
04:12:42,780 --> 04:12:44,780
But I'm like, oh, okay

3174
04:12:44,940 --> 04:12:47,580
She's like you're dumb. I'm like got you on it. Fuck you

3175
04:12:48,540 --> 04:12:50,540
Why do I see a waifu

3176
04:12:51,340 --> 04:12:56,140
And beginning of she I don't know what that means you see official cat throw down

3177
04:12:58,140 --> 04:13:04,700
Yeah, our dog a dog. Oh like a dog pet play girl. It'd be sick. She'd be your top down. Okay. I can work with that

3178
04:13:07,500 --> 04:13:14,540
But um, yeah, I think one of the biggest things that sticks to me, um with uh my interview

3179
04:13:15,500 --> 04:13:20,940
With strongy is she was like you were always going to be my sheepsters and I was like

3180
04:13:22,940 --> 04:13:25,900
Crop wait cries profusely

3181
04:13:28,220 --> 04:13:30,220
Um wolf girl for wolf quest

3182
04:13:32,940 --> 04:13:38,540
Uh, I don't someone also asked my mirror I was like boomie leave her alone

3183
04:13:39,100 --> 04:13:41,100
Oh

3184
04:13:41,420 --> 04:13:43,420
Stop

3185
04:13:43,420 --> 04:13:44,700
You hear that?

3186
04:13:44,700 --> 04:13:46,140
That's boomie

3187
04:13:46,140 --> 04:13:48,060
He doesn't meow. He just

3188
04:13:48,060 --> 04:13:51,820
Coo's weird chicken girl that actually be pretty funny. Um

3189
04:13:54,220 --> 04:13:59,100
Sounds like babe, this is your sheepster academia

3190
04:13:59,500 --> 04:14:01,500
Oh

3191
04:14:02,220 --> 04:14:05,740
Yes, Johnny is Johnny's base. Love that woman

3192
04:14:07,100 --> 04:14:09,100
How to pat cattle you just pat

3193
04:14:09,900 --> 04:14:13,100
But someone that asked like oh if you could be another thing

3194
04:14:13,100 --> 04:14:18,140
What would you be like a like animal and I don't honestly want to pick something

3195
04:14:19,660 --> 04:14:22,940
Boomi can you chill the fuck out dude? Um

3196
04:14:24,140 --> 04:14:27,020
I want to pick so I would pick something that like nobody

3197
04:14:27,980 --> 04:14:32,140
Really ever like I like strong is because she's like a cuttlefish. She's not like an octopus

3198
04:14:33,100 --> 04:14:37,740
Um, I would probably do some sort of like reptile because it's not a reptile girls

3199
04:14:37,740 --> 04:14:42,700
There's like some snakes and there's some dino girls, but I'd like I think there was like one

3200
04:14:43,820 --> 04:14:46,540
Crocodile girl. I think that was like a Japanese

3201
04:14:47,340 --> 04:14:50,380
Talent and I was like yo, that's so cool

3202
04:14:51,340 --> 04:14:53,340
Boomi

3203
04:14:54,140 --> 04:14:57,500
I'm gonna create you if you don't behave. You can hear her run by go

3204
04:14:58,540 --> 04:15:02,620
Because I shake the water bottle at him. Well, there's a billion axolotls. What are you talking about?

3205
04:15:05,260 --> 04:15:09,740
Like coming out as a cook. Yeah, like like uh like when Madara was a cockroach. I was like

3206
04:15:10,620 --> 04:15:16,780
Yo, I love bug girls bug girls out. So I'd either be a reptile or a bug girl 100 percent 100 percent

3207
04:15:17,740 --> 04:15:19,740
Like I thought that was so cool that she was a cockroach

3208
04:15:21,420 --> 04:15:23,420
Um Aunt Eater girl

3209
04:15:26,220 --> 04:15:30,140
What type of bug um, I was thinking of like a praying mantis

3210
04:15:31,580 --> 04:15:35,340
Like an orchid mantis then I saw that somebody actually had done that. Um

3211
04:15:37,900 --> 04:15:40,940
What is that's broken hey

3212
04:15:41,180 --> 04:15:43,180
Hey

3213
04:15:43,500 --> 04:15:45,500
You galloped by um

3214
04:15:46,380 --> 04:15:49,900
I've seen a centipede girl. I'm actually I love bugs

3215
04:15:51,340 --> 04:15:54,220
Centipedes are the only bugs that freak me out and not even like

3216
04:15:55,180 --> 04:15:59,580
It's like the silver like the house centipedes. I don't like house centipedes

3217
04:16:00,380 --> 04:16:02,380
Google it if you don't know how centipedes

3218
04:16:03,500 --> 04:16:06,620
Hydra be cool. I've seen there's like a Cerberus one

3219
04:16:07,580 --> 04:16:11,020
Um, but I was kind of disappointed that she like didn't have multiple heads

3220
04:16:11,740 --> 04:16:14,060
Or something. I would have liked to see that incorporated

3221
04:16:14,780 --> 04:16:19,660
Slime girl. I've seen like a couple slime girls. There's there's definitely a couple spider girls

3222
04:16:21,420 --> 04:16:22,700
Um

3223
04:16:22,700 --> 04:16:30,780
My friend Nori, uh, I think she's just rebranded to an isopod which I'm like hell yeah isopods. There's so many cute isopods

3224
04:16:31,500 --> 04:16:35,580
You might have to do like a bug stream where I just talk about isopods or just bugs

3225
04:16:37,420 --> 04:16:43,820
Um, I used to have a little bug book and I would go around in my um, boomi. Are you behaving?

3226
04:16:46,620 --> 04:16:51,420
Fia is playing with like some toy in the in a blanket and boomi's like mad

3227
04:16:51,500 --> 04:16:56,940
Like boomi doesn't like it when the cats play independently like if rain is playing by herself or fias bang by himself

3228
04:16:56,940 --> 04:16:59,900
He like has to insert himself and be a part of it. Um

3229
04:17:01,260 --> 04:17:04,860
But this is a vtubing industry is you yeah, I don't know why everybody's like

3230
04:17:05,340 --> 04:17:08,940
What's it called a ca-ma-ma me me me me me. I can ever pronounce it. But

3231
04:17:09,740 --> 04:17:11,740
Yeah, everybody's like an animal person

3232
04:17:12,220 --> 04:17:17,980
Um, what I would like to see more of is food based vtubers. I have seen a couple food based vtubers

3233
04:17:18,540 --> 04:17:20,540
Um, I think that's funny

3234
04:17:20,540 --> 04:17:22,300
Yes

3235
04:17:22,300 --> 04:17:24,300
Yeah

3236
04:17:26,780 --> 04:17:31,100
It's either like or like a unique mystical creature like I wanted um

3237
04:17:32,140 --> 04:17:34,140
But when I was first conceptualizing

3238
04:17:34,860 --> 04:17:38,420
my VTuber model, not Shibi, like prior to Shibi.

3239
04:17:39,460 --> 04:17:41,620
This was made by Shani herself.

3240
04:17:41,620 --> 04:17:45,700
I was birthed from the loins of Shone of Momhe.

3241
04:17:45,700 --> 04:17:49,900
But I was thinking about like doing

3242
04:17:49,900 --> 04:17:52,780
like Cthulhu Outer Worlds type character,

3243
04:17:52,780 --> 04:17:54,980
like Outer Realms, and this would be like

3244
04:17:54,980 --> 04:17:59,980
have a Hydra sort of like multiple tentacles, tails,

3245
04:18:00,980 --> 04:18:03,140
like really like spooky, freaky,

3246
04:18:03,140 --> 04:18:05,620
like I was tempted to do that.

3247
04:18:05,620 --> 04:18:08,180
Yeah, like I should go off, see Waffles.

3248
04:18:08,180 --> 04:18:09,020
Yeah.

3249
04:18:11,700 --> 04:18:14,940
Rest in peace, Waffle and the Toaster, they miss her.

3250
04:18:16,060 --> 04:18:18,940
She was a, she was a girl, she was a friend.

3251
04:18:20,380 --> 04:18:21,300
Via Girl Girl.

3252
04:18:21,300 --> 04:18:24,060
Yeah, like Mecha Girl, that'd be cool.

3253
04:18:24,060 --> 04:18:26,100
I don't see, and that's another thing.

3254
04:18:26,100 --> 04:18:29,300
A lot of artists don't, and the VTuber stuff,

3255
04:18:29,300 --> 04:18:32,020
don't do Mecha unless it's like cybernetic

3256
04:18:32,020 --> 04:18:34,700
and it's usually for guys for some reason.

3257
04:18:34,700 --> 04:18:37,100
Like I don't see, or like there's some cybernetic girls

3258
04:18:37,100 --> 04:18:38,980
or like androids and stuff,

3259
04:18:38,980 --> 04:18:42,380
but like I want like a full ass transformer.

3260
04:18:42,380 --> 04:18:43,860
Like give me a Voltron.

3261
04:18:46,100 --> 04:18:47,820
Give me a pterodactyl.

3262
04:18:51,340 --> 04:18:53,020
Honda Accord, Chan.

3263
04:18:53,020 --> 04:18:55,340
I offer you an Accord.

3264
04:18:55,340 --> 04:18:56,500
Just a Honda Accord.

3265
04:18:59,220 --> 04:19:01,460
Chick stick, giant robots, you got that, right?

3266
04:19:01,460 --> 04:19:02,820
That's why I like Robotech.

3267
04:19:02,820 --> 04:19:04,900
Somebody who's mad, they're like,

3268
04:19:04,900 --> 04:19:06,820
you don't like just Macross.

3269
04:19:06,820 --> 04:19:10,220
Robotech was like the first super old anime

3270
04:19:10,220 --> 04:19:11,780
my dad introduced me to.

3271
04:19:13,300 --> 04:19:17,700
It was like Studio Ghibli stuff and then Robotech

3272
04:19:17,700 --> 04:19:20,660
and then yeah, just like a bunch of other shit.

3273
04:19:20,660 --> 04:19:22,220
Like I watched a lot of anime.

3274
04:19:22,220 --> 04:19:25,060
I don't know why, I like blank on all the anime I've watched.

3275
04:19:27,460 --> 04:19:28,660
What are you doing?

3276
04:19:28,660 --> 04:19:29,660
What are you doing?

3277
04:19:31,980 --> 04:19:33,660
Do you just want attention?

3278
04:19:33,660 --> 04:19:35,380
Hi handsome.

3279
04:19:35,380 --> 04:19:37,700
Mail on stream, it's my cat, relax everybody.

3280
04:19:39,020 --> 04:19:41,020
He doesn't even have any balls.

3281
04:19:41,020 --> 04:19:42,420
What are you doing big man?

3282
04:19:43,660 --> 04:19:44,940
Are you trying to seduce me?

3283
04:19:44,940 --> 04:19:46,980
Are you trying to get treats and pets?

3284
04:19:46,980 --> 04:19:49,020
He's just dragging a toy across the floor.

3285
04:19:52,900 --> 04:19:54,260
Have a good night, if you need to go.

3286
04:19:54,260 --> 04:19:56,180
I know I've been streaming like for four hours

3287
04:19:56,180 --> 04:20:00,260
so like if you guys need to leave, that's totally fine.

3288
04:20:00,260 --> 04:20:04,780
I'm also a yapper and talker like strongy.

3289
04:20:04,780 --> 04:20:07,540
I don't think I could, I can endurance yap.

3290
04:20:07,540 --> 04:20:09,660
I can't endurance game like she does.

3291
04:20:09,660 --> 04:20:13,180
Like if she's still playing, hold on, now I want to check.

3292
04:20:13,180 --> 04:20:15,140
Is she still playing something?

3293
04:20:15,140 --> 04:20:15,980
I bet she is.

3294
04:20:22,180 --> 04:20:24,220
Forever be online.

3295
04:20:24,220 --> 04:20:26,060
I generally, when I first met her,

3296
04:20:26,060 --> 04:20:28,300
I'm like how do you get any work done?

3297
04:20:28,300 --> 04:20:29,740
Cause you just play games.

3298
04:20:29,780 --> 04:20:31,620
Like how do you have time to record stuff?

3299
04:20:31,620 --> 04:20:33,340
She recorded like months and months and months

3300
04:20:33,340 --> 04:20:34,780
of stuff in advance.

3301
04:20:34,780 --> 04:20:36,420
Oh my gosh, she still is streaming.

3302
04:20:41,420 --> 04:20:42,980
She's still streaming as I said,

3303
04:20:42,980 --> 04:20:45,340
I love Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

3304
04:20:45,340 --> 04:20:47,460
That was the first one I played.

3305
04:20:47,460 --> 04:20:49,020
Was there a streaming too?

3306
04:20:49,020 --> 04:20:49,860
Cool.

3307
04:20:55,580 --> 04:20:58,180
I was hoping for Ace Combat or Armored Core

3308
04:20:58,180 --> 04:20:59,580
but it was just Assassin's Creed.

3309
04:20:59,580 --> 04:21:01,700
I officially play Armored Core.

3310
04:21:01,700 --> 04:21:03,700
What time are you in Merca's right now?

3311
04:21:03,700 --> 04:21:08,340
It's 8 20 p.m. into Merca's Eastern Time.

3312
04:21:08,340 --> 04:21:09,900
East Code, represent it.

3313
04:21:11,340 --> 04:21:13,900
You just don't want to leave us as a good, yeah, I don't.

3314
04:21:13,900 --> 04:21:17,140
Like after, I have to, I'll probably end stream soon

3315
04:21:17,140 --> 04:21:18,700
cause I need to go eat dinner.

3316
04:21:21,060 --> 04:21:25,460
And I'm going to be sad because I have no one to talk to.

3317
04:21:25,620 --> 04:21:30,620
I have been like, I don't know what to do.

3318
04:21:32,060 --> 04:21:33,340
I like, I have friends.

3319
04:21:33,340 --> 04:21:35,540
I just don't feel like hanging out with them.

3320
04:21:35,540 --> 04:21:38,580
I don't feel like, I have to go and get ready

3321
04:21:38,580 --> 04:21:41,660
and get dressed and blah, like I have to do that tomorrow.

3322
04:21:41,660 --> 04:21:43,940
Like tomorrow, just reminded me, I have to get up

3323
04:21:43,940 --> 04:21:47,540
and go to like the store and go buy some alcohol

3324
04:21:47,540 --> 04:21:48,780
cause I normally don't even drink

3325
04:21:48,780 --> 04:21:51,180
but I just know it'd be funny to do a drunk stream.

3326
04:21:52,180 --> 04:21:55,260
Where's my fellow Europeans starting to pass midnight?

3327
04:21:57,100 --> 04:21:58,740
Go to bed, go to bed.

3328
04:21:58,740 --> 04:22:02,660
I used to stream around like very European friendly times

3329
04:22:02,660 --> 04:22:06,060
like 12 a.m. and sometimes 10 a.m.

3330
04:22:07,940 --> 04:22:10,300
And the boomy, what are you doing?

3331
04:22:10,300 --> 04:22:12,420
He's literally just staring at my window

3332
04:22:12,420 --> 04:22:13,780
and just like tweaking out

3333
04:22:13,780 --> 04:22:15,460
cause there's probably a bug on it.

3334
04:22:15,460 --> 04:22:19,220
Hi handsome, what are you doing?

3335
04:22:19,260 --> 04:22:21,180
He has like a cat tree that he sits on

3336
04:22:21,180 --> 04:22:22,700
but he sticks his arm over the side.

3337
04:22:22,700 --> 04:22:25,020
Like he's a truck driver and it's really funny to see.

3338
04:22:25,020 --> 04:22:26,700
I'll probably post a picture of it.

3339
04:22:29,500 --> 04:22:31,620
Hit him with a kitty, no he doesn't.

3340
04:22:31,620 --> 04:22:34,740
Little, my cats don't answer to, they answer to

3341
04:22:36,540 --> 04:22:38,340
my little mousy call.

3342
04:22:40,780 --> 04:22:45,020
We dare not see the things only cats can see.

3343
04:22:45,020 --> 04:22:46,780
Your longer streams go into the night a bit here

3344
04:22:46,780 --> 04:22:47,620
but it's not too bad.

3345
04:22:48,460 --> 04:22:53,460
I stream from like 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. before.

3346
04:22:56,380 --> 04:22:58,540
Like I don't mind doing super long streams

3347
04:22:58,540 --> 04:23:00,020
if I have the time for it.

3348
04:23:00,940 --> 04:23:04,940
And then again, I can talk about anything for hours.

3349
04:23:04,940 --> 04:23:09,940
As you can see, I've only played two hours of game

3350
04:23:10,380 --> 04:23:12,540
and then there's two hours of yapping.

3351
04:23:13,260 --> 04:23:17,940
My black cat sits in her cat stand

3352
04:23:17,940 --> 04:23:19,780
with her back legs just dangling off.

3353
04:23:19,780 --> 04:23:20,620
I love that.

3354
04:23:20,620 --> 04:23:21,460
I love it.

3355
04:23:21,460 --> 04:23:23,820
Like Fia likes to stick out her legs a lot.

3356
04:23:23,820 --> 04:23:26,060
Like she's the most stretchy, floppy-est cat.

3357
04:23:26,980 --> 04:23:29,580
When cats like just lay on their back

3358
04:23:29,580 --> 04:23:32,220
and like stick their little feeties out and just kick them.

3359
04:23:32,220 --> 04:23:33,500
It's great.

3360
04:23:33,500 --> 04:23:35,580
69, 420 hours stream went.

3361
04:23:35,580 --> 04:23:37,780
Ooh, it is my goal.

3362
04:23:37,780 --> 04:23:39,020
I'm gonna say this right now.

3363
04:23:39,020 --> 04:23:44,020
I would love to do an actual 24-hour stream.

3364
04:23:44,980 --> 04:23:47,900
Like I will sleep on,

3365
04:23:47,900 --> 04:23:51,100
I don't know if this YouTube allows sleeping on stream

3366
04:23:51,100 --> 04:23:54,060
but like just like have a day.

3367
04:23:54,060 --> 04:23:56,060
Like I don't know, like you cook, play games

3368
04:23:57,700 --> 04:24:00,660
and maybe I'll do that for my birthday.

3369
04:24:01,700 --> 04:24:04,820
And like, but actually do like a 24-hour don't-a-thon.

3370
04:24:04,820 --> 04:24:06,060
And then like I'm sleeping

3371
04:24:06,060 --> 04:24:07,380
and then I just have like my 3DO.

3372
04:24:07,380 --> 04:24:11,580
So you guys can hear me like fart in my sleep and just, yeah.

3373
04:24:11,580 --> 04:24:16,580
And I think that would be pretty, pretty fun.

3374
04:24:18,820 --> 04:24:22,060
Just to like, or like I sleep with my 3DO

3375
04:24:22,060 --> 04:24:22,900
pressed to my chest.

3376
04:24:22,900 --> 04:24:24,460
So you guys can hear my heartbeat.

3377
04:24:24,460 --> 04:24:25,620
Do I sleep talk?

3378
04:24:26,700 --> 04:24:28,020
I don't know.

3379
04:24:29,780 --> 04:24:33,620
I know that I snore from like what my parents have told me.

3380
04:24:35,140 --> 04:24:36,580
I snore sometimes.

3381
04:24:37,500 --> 04:24:40,220
My mom one time said that she freaked out

3382
04:24:40,220 --> 04:24:42,540
because I stopped breathing in my sleep.

3383
04:24:42,540 --> 04:24:44,500
She was like still awake at night,

3384
04:24:44,500 --> 04:24:46,740
like watching her shows and I was sleeping.

3385
04:24:46,740 --> 04:24:49,460
And then she heard me snore, my breath get caught

3386
04:24:49,460 --> 04:24:51,620
and then just like, I choked but I didn't wake up.

3387
04:24:51,620 --> 04:24:54,460
And so she was like, wake up, you're so exciting.

3388
04:24:54,460 --> 04:24:55,940
And I was like, what the fuck?

3389
04:24:55,940 --> 04:24:58,300
And she's like, I, you were not breathing.

3390
04:24:58,300 --> 04:24:59,460
And I'm like, oh.

3391
04:25:03,300 --> 04:25:04,340
Time to get a CPAP machine.

3392
04:25:04,340 --> 04:25:05,180
Yeah, my dad is sleeping.

3393
04:25:05,180 --> 04:25:06,580
I mean, I probably have a doom.

3394
04:25:08,140 --> 04:25:08,980
Fucking.

3395
04:25:11,220 --> 04:25:12,580
No, it's weird.

3396
04:25:12,580 --> 04:25:13,420
It's really weird.

3397
04:25:13,420 --> 04:25:14,540
I hate that.

3398
04:25:14,540 --> 04:25:19,260
I would not want to sleep like a Darth Vader mask on me.

3399
04:25:19,260 --> 04:25:21,340
It's mostly cause like, I just like,

3400
04:25:21,340 --> 04:25:23,820
I think it's cause I sleep with my mouth open.

3401
04:25:23,820 --> 04:25:26,660
All the little spiders can crawl inside.

3402
04:25:26,660 --> 04:25:28,020
Have you already tested if the boob bug

3403
04:25:28,020 --> 04:25:29,980
in the way of heartbeat ASMR?

3404
04:25:29,980 --> 04:25:34,980
I just push my titties to each side of my body accordingly.

3405
04:25:35,980 --> 04:25:39,980
And put it like, I have to like push my titties to like,

3406
04:25:39,980 --> 04:25:41,900
I can't tell when I'm touching myself right now.

3407
04:25:41,900 --> 04:25:43,740
And I just push my titties to the side

3408
04:25:43,740 --> 04:25:48,740
and then I have to like mush my, the 3DO against my chest.

3409
04:25:50,700 --> 04:25:52,380
She'd become cyborg.

3410
04:25:52,380 --> 04:25:54,580
If I could just cut off my tits, that'd be great.

3411
04:25:54,580 --> 04:25:56,740
I hate having tits, man.

3412
04:25:56,740 --> 04:25:58,420
I'd rather have a fatter ass.

3413
04:25:59,940 --> 04:26:03,380
But yeah, cause it's a boiler alert.

3414
04:26:03,460 --> 04:26:07,140
There might be a heartbeat ASMR coming out soon.

3415
04:26:08,980 --> 04:26:11,820
So I had to record a lot of heartbeat stuff.

3416
04:26:11,820 --> 04:26:15,140
So I am already experienced with that.

3417
04:26:15,140 --> 04:26:17,340
I have to like adjust myself,

3418
04:26:17,340 --> 04:26:21,060
like a manager manages his, his ball sack.

3419
04:26:21,060 --> 04:26:22,460
Now adjust my titty sack.

3420
04:26:24,940 --> 04:26:26,300
Chibi, you can only stream 12 hours

3421
04:26:26,300 --> 04:26:27,860
and Vaude has gone on YouTube.

3422
04:26:29,460 --> 04:26:30,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3423
04:26:30,300 --> 04:26:31,140
No, I know that.

3424
04:26:31,140 --> 04:26:31,980
I know that.

3425
04:26:31,980 --> 04:26:32,940
I'll do that.

3426
04:26:32,940 --> 04:26:33,780
I'll do that.

3427
04:26:35,140 --> 04:26:36,780
Does it like,

3428
04:26:36,780 --> 04:26:39,100
does it like automatically end

3429
04:26:39,100 --> 04:26:40,900
if you stream 12 hours?

3430
04:26:40,900 --> 04:26:42,060
Does it just end?

3431
04:26:43,580 --> 04:26:45,020
Like it doesn't just like be like,

3432
04:26:45,020 --> 04:26:47,820
you're done and just cut you off or.

3433
04:26:50,460 --> 04:26:51,780
I got a piss.

3434
04:26:53,260 --> 04:26:54,260
I got a pee.

3435
04:26:56,660 --> 04:26:58,580
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

3436
04:26:58,580 --> 04:26:59,420
Hold on.

3437
04:27:03,580 --> 04:27:05,140
Let's see.

3438
04:27:05,140 --> 04:27:06,540
I think I might,

3439
04:27:10,260 --> 04:27:13,180
might end here cause I do need to eat something.

3440
04:27:13,180 --> 04:27:14,220
I'm streaming for four hours.

3441
04:27:14,220 --> 04:27:16,180
It looks like Amy is still streaming.

3442
04:27:17,340 --> 04:27:19,740
It's funny cause it looks like

3443
04:27:19,740 --> 04:27:22,180
because I just started streaming.

3444
04:27:22,180 --> 04:27:23,420
Strawny is still streaming.

3445
04:27:23,420 --> 04:27:24,740
We are the overlap corporal

3446
04:27:24,740 --> 04:27:27,580
cause we all stream for very, very long amount,

3447
04:27:27,580 --> 04:27:28,620
amounts of time.

3448
04:27:30,260 --> 04:27:31,380
The Vaude doesn't get saved.

3449
04:27:31,380 --> 04:27:32,220
That's so weird.

3450
04:27:33,940 --> 04:27:36,460
It stops recording the vlog.

3451
04:27:36,460 --> 04:27:37,860
Oh, okay.

3452
04:27:37,860 --> 04:27:38,700
Yeah.

3453
04:27:38,700 --> 04:27:40,580
I'll probably go get something to eat.

3454
04:27:40,580 --> 04:27:43,060
Let me send you guys to Azura

3455
04:27:43,060 --> 04:27:46,180
cause I see that like she's just streaming.

3456
04:27:46,180 --> 04:27:47,500
She just started.

3457
04:27:47,500 --> 04:27:48,340
What the fuck?

3458
04:27:49,220 --> 04:27:53,220
Oh, I just have major deja vu video details.

3459
04:27:54,060 --> 04:27:56,220
Reader X are so weird.

3460
04:27:58,940 --> 04:28:00,900
Like why can't I just raid?

3461
04:28:00,900 --> 04:28:02,820
Jesus Christ, let me raid.

3462
04:28:03,780 --> 04:28:06,380
A place forbidden.

3463
04:28:06,380 --> 04:28:08,660
I don't know what that's about.

3464
04:28:08,660 --> 04:28:12,340
But yeah, I hope you guys had a good time.

3465
04:28:12,340 --> 04:28:14,380
Thank you for letting me out.

3466
04:28:14,380 --> 04:28:15,340
I tend to overshare.

3467
04:28:15,340 --> 04:28:17,340
So I'm slightly embarrassed right now.

3468
04:28:17,340 --> 04:28:22,260
