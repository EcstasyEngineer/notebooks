I fell asleep from ICStream, I did. I fell asleep to her ASMR.
I woke up momentarily because her redirect was strawny.
So I heard strawny's voice for a couple seconds and I took off my headphones because she was like...
I need to wake up.
I need to wake up.
I need to wake up.
My cats also are eating in the background.
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
Thank you.
You have with you to wake up.
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
Here is my donation of virginity.
Oh, I can hear myself.
Oh no, fuck.
Gross, gross, gross, I hate that.
It's because I went and after the last stream,
I tried fixing my microphone again.
But I guess it's still not good enough.
Alas, I give up.
I like...
Am I going to have to like get strawny in here or something?
Are we going to bring double sheebie?
No, no double sheebie.
Oh, Reina's here.
Hello, Reina.
What's up?
Oh, let me move my headphones so you can lay in your bed.
And Fia must be munching.
Oh my gosh, please don't knock over my drink on my own keyboard.
I usually just throw my headphones above my mic arm.
I'm not hearing double sheebie ads because I shut myself up real quick.
Because I was like, why is my desktop audio going crazy?
And I realized my thing was unmuted because I had been listening to myself,
fighting with my lovely AT2020 that I've had for over a decade.
You're the best microphone ever, baby girl.
But yeah, double sounds twice as good.
I remember my ASMR stream, I was double for like half the stream
and everybody was like, yeah, it was actually sounded okay.
And I'm like, what the fuck?
Reina, are you waking up?
Reina, I was also almost late because Reina was coughing up her ball.
My poor old lady.
Now she came out to snuggle with me.
So I was like watching her.
And then I'm like, oh fuck, I have to pee.
And I'm like, lady, are you okay?
And then I'm like, oh, oh.
Imagine having an ass in an AT2020 mic as opposed to a shirt.
Okay.
They cut, I thought it was fine.
Although what, do you want me to throw a shirt on my, my throne?
Do you want you guys want to drop $400?
Sure, go for it.
I don't think that'll fix my audio.
It's definitely more of a, what's it called?
Settings thing.
Because my AT2020 is fine.
I see only pokes fun at you.
I haven't heard a poke phone at the others yet.
It's because I, you said I have nice reactions.
And they are the only ones that I will allow that tease me, my girls,
because nobody else can tease me.
Or you will get caught.
I will come to your house and something will go up your butt.
It's not going to be nice.
It's probably going to go out of your mouth and then you'll pass away.
Haha, no, it's fine though.
I think your levels had steam percent to be fine for the mother should be cool.
Nice promise.
Yes.
Pinky swear promise.
Don't shame others of using other mics on the processing.
I could, you know, I could just be like,
for the first like month of being in calls with strongy,
she just had this gamer microphone.
She sounded like fucking Tyler one.
And I was funny as hell.
It was so good.
Yeah, keep you in line.
I don't know where my crop is.
It's behind me.
I feel like reaching for it.
Because I'm raining on my arms.
Oh, hey, fancy meeting you again so soon.
Oh, hello.
Scots is from Tyler one.
I'm funny.
Yeah, I've had my I've had a lie detector C920 for a webcam
that I use for like the cat cam and hand cams and stuff.
And then I've had my 80 2020 for such a long time.
Those are the only things that have not broken on me.
Everything else broken.
Like my I had like my favorite.
I forget what the mouse is called.
Let me see if I can pick it up with my feet because it's just on the floor.
Still plugged in.
It's a I love this mouse.
It's a large attack.
I can't see it.
Does it have the number on it?
I don't know.
It's the one that shroud uses.
I had just the regular one before that and the prices shot up on them
because shroud whatever was using it or someone else.
Yeah, it's audio technica.
Yeah, it's audio technica.
And I asked him starting talking to Xbox controller microphone.
Feet mouse.
Yeah, I don't know if you guys heard that lovely ASMR if my microphone picked it up.
I was so mad at like all the ones I got of that Logitech mouse
just that one of the keys gets sticky like my right click gets sticky.
And I was I took it apart to clean it and there's nothing wrong with it.
And this is like just gets fucked up.
And I asked the person, oh, is it like ghost clicking or double clicking
because it would do that too.
And they're like, no, when I bought off eBay and I'm like, fuck you guys.
I'm an AT 2035.
I love and I do it.
Logitech G502.
I might I might be.
Yeah.
Sticky.
No, like the not like sticky like something's in it.
Like sticky like it is sticks.
I can't I don't know how else to explain it to you.
That's a switch probably.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Like it's it's notorious for that.
And so because I was doing research on it and I'm like, I'm not going to try to even bother with this.
Okay, let me just read out in the Dario's because I don't know if the text speaks works.
Let me see.
Actually, can I?
Nadario tipped $5.
Apologies for underestimating your knowledge in IC's stream earlier, madam.
Please forgive me.
Hey.
Buying deeply.
Guys.
Here is my donation virginity.
I think it's working.
Thank you for giving me your donation virginity.
It is an honor.
Switch to the G.
Oh, are you okay?
Just needs anything?
I just switched to the G.
305 for seven years.
What a valuable part.
Yeah.
Let's go text to speech.
Hell yeah.
Okay, cool.
Just don't say anything bad.
I'll fight you.
Relatively.
Please.
Like guys, they won't want a decision.
But yeah, I set that all up.
So it's cool.
I remember the first time someone ever donated to me.
I cried so hard.
I would ever get how old I was.
And I think I was like 18.
Streaming on Twitch.
And I was streaming to like seven people.
Like Counter Strike.
And my setup was worse than it was now.
And they sent me like five bucks and they're like keep it up.
I think literally that like that one person donating
motivated me because I was just so honored
that someone took their cash that they worked really hard for.
They had a day job.
Or like hell if it was their parents money.
And they decided to give it to me out of everybody else.
And so I literally cried on stream for 10 minutes.
Like for yeah, Rose investment is paying off 100%.
Yeah, shout out to that first person who ever donated to me.
No idea who you are, but thanks.
Don't know and subscribers milestones.
And here we are a niche internet celebrity.
They don't know I'm a VTuber.
Every time I leave my apartment, that's what I think about.
They don't know I'm a VTuber.
I think it's a patine.
Wondering if I can pick up Rena's purrs.
Purr to like.
Good mums.
Miss mums.
Okay.
Yeah, she's she's my lovely girl.
Cat docks.
Rena just like to hang out with me.
And even if I'm not touching her if she's just there next to me,
she just she's purrs.
She just loves hanging out with me and I love hanging out with her.
I've had her since I was very, very young.
She's very old now.
But she's still got it.
She's still kicking.
She's my.
She like is one of those pets that knows if you're like super stressed out.
And she'll so anytime I'm super stressed out,
she'll just come and she'll purr on me.
Or her sister,
she had a sister named Solay,
Rena and Solay and they were very sweet.
And her sister would come if I was having a really bad day.
She would lick my tears off my face.
Solay and then Rena would just purr on me.
And it was very cute.
My cat there.
I love them to death.
I love Siamese cats.
They're so sweet.
So sweet.
And they're also really dog-like because they like will play fetch with you.
And they're very vocal and I like that because Rena will just yell at me.
My cat, me and his me house farts and leaves all.
I've got a 17 year old cat myself.
Old pet suppressors.
Yes, exactly.
With this one audio,
I can determine the size and shape of your cat.
And then I can use algorithms to narrow down whereabouts to.
That'd be impressive.
I'd be like, okay, you know what?
You earned it.
I have cat hair in my mouth.
Oh my God.
Rena.
But enjoy a tipped $5.
Oh, she be my madam.
How I love to hear you don't really hear the words.
I just think of your.
What?
You think of my what?
I'm happy you guys are enjoying the Texas beach.
Honestly, when TTS kind of like messes up stuff,
it's like even funnier.
Cause it's like, huh?
Oh my God.
I still have cat hair in my mouth.
Rena.
But oh my God.
There's cat hair over my mic.
Rena sheds a lot.
For some, for a Siamese cat.
I don't know why.
She's a pure bread Siamese.
I don't know why she sheds so much.
Okay.
Let's I want to see if this.
Well, I'm going to give it another try.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Bon enjoy a tipped $5.
Oh, she be my madam.
How I love to hear you don't really hear the words.
I just think of your strap.
It's funny because it's just a comment.
It says how I love to hear you.
Yeah.
I don't really hear the words.
I just think of your shit.
I don't know why it skips over how I love to hear you.
Yeah.
And so I'm going to give it another try.
Thank you, sweetheart.
I love to hear you.
Yeah.
It's so funny to me.
Quick.
Someone put this track script.
Yeah.
If you do that, I can just end it.
It's poetic.
You know, yeah.
It's very poetic.
Cat hair gets everywhere.
Very true.
Shedding is healthy though, right?
Well, she's older.
So I feel like she's can't groom herself that well.
So I usually brush her once a day.
But she's a, she's a sheddy motherfucker.
I don't mean no.
She likes, she likes to be held in my arms like a little baby.
And she looks up at me as I give her forehead kisses.
Even though she's, she's 14 years old.
She's still, she's still kitten in my eyes.
She also still acts like a kitten.
Because she'll chase Boomi around if he's pissed her off enough.
And it's the funniest thing to see.
And then she'll like launch herself that a cat tree and jump there and then start yelling.
And I'm like, ma'am, you're going to bust a hip.
Yeah, so the best for me.
Yeah, I could talk with my cats for hours.
I mean, they put on my headphones.
I'm just going to hear some scope.
Sorry, is yawning?
Cleverly disguised Samoyed Dog.
Oh my gosh.
One of my teachers had a Samoyed Dog and she brought,
in his name was Sammy.
You know, they always call him Sammy, like Samoyed Sammy's.
So I don't know why she named the dog Sammy.
But he was the fluffiest dog and I loved him.
He was so fluffy.
He was also giant because I was like seven when she brought him into class one time.
I don't even know how she was allowed to do that.
I think she was on vacation and she had a sub and she just came in anyways to show her dog.
I don't even know.
Yeah, they do shed a lot.
Have you seen the acolyte? Is that out?
I was pretty psyched by the trailer.
I didn't even watch...
I was at Dagobah.
No, I didn't watch.
Oh my God, I haven't kept up.
I haven't even watched the third season of the Mandalorian.
Yeah, I never watched Andor because I watched like the first two episodes and I was like, I'm bored.
Obi-Wan Kenobi was fucking bomb.
I got those like lights, like those LED lights that match what's on the screen of your TV.
And watching the fight between him and Vader with that just like with all the lights turned off was literally incredible.
I didn't watch Ahsoka either.
Although I should because I like that actress.
I should watch the Bad Batch as well.
I should have kept her in my throat.
Also congrats on the order of magnitude Twitter growth.
Thank you. Thank you.
It's probably mostly just sex bots.
So I'm not too concerned.
Some ways are so hyper in my experience.
Whenever I say hi to my dog or they want to do his play.
Oh, that's cute.
I like behind the TV.
Yeah, Boba Fett went downhill.
I liked the first part of Boba Fett, but then they brought up the fucking street gang Power Rangers that were like Victorian British people, cyberpunk, steampunk dudes.
And I'm like, I'm done.
I'm good.
Who are these guys?
I like the first half when he was with the the I'm blanking on everything man because I haven't watched the show since it came out.
And again, I just woke up.
So I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Boba Fett.
Boba Fett.
You know, the sand peoples.
Right.
I remember.
Yeah, and then it becomes.
Yeah, then Mando shows up and I'm like, it's just a cleverly disguised like filler season of Mandalorian.
Although I fucking love Pablo Pascal, Pedro Pascal.
I never watched anything in your Star Wars or the Mandalorian was one of the good stories.
Yeah, I highly recommend watching Mandalorian.
Boba Fett got his loon Skywalker, but the newer Star Wars movies, I like like the first one was really good.
But the last one and the one before it like I was, I was, I know me and my dad were disappointed.
My mom was like also like what the hell is this?
But like it.
Yeah, I'm just too disappointed with the end of the second season to continue.
Yeah, second season was a bummer.
Wait, yeah, I just wrote all Rogue One is one of my favorite movies, Star Wars movies.
Like I think it's like I have a soft spot in my heart for the prequels just because of how camp they are.
But like for like newer movies, the Rogue One, I've seen so many times in the prequel.
I'm not watching any Star Wars in the original movies and prequel movies.
Yeah, like the first one, like what I wish they did is I wish they focused on Finn more because I feel like he should have been the main character instead of what's her fucking face.
They gave him like it seemed like he had super pivotal role.
They just joined it away from him.
And I know like that actor was also really pissed off about that because just how the movies were flowing.
It seemed like he was going to be whatever.
And like how he like used the force and like lightsaber then he just fucking doesn't do it anymore.
I'm like, all right.
Actor something bodega whatever his name is.
It's pretty pretty good actor too.
And I like I like Daisy Ridley, but yeah, and I also just hate like the random love shit thrown in like spoiler alert.
Well, I'm not going to say it in case you want to just like watch it after this.
But at the in the last movie with the like love stuff or like the random like it just ended so poorly like the last movie and I'm like this is fucking stupid.
This is so dumb.
I was so mad.
And I'm like, who's this random chick?
Like who's that person?
These are this is a whole side plot that I did not give a shit about.
The tiger got me.
I peed it because I was were abling the phone.
You're trying to help me out, right?
And I should have spread it.
Yeah, exactly.
I wish it kind of would have been like because like it's such a cool story what Finn had.
Being a former trooper and then deciding to like like branch off from that and like go his own way and then meeting up with like I thought that was so cool.
John Boyega.
Yeah, I'm not Bodega.
But like I was I was so.
I was like, oh my God, like I want a cosplay as female Finn and now I'm like, no.
No thanks.
You play the follow series.
I actually did not.
I never play follow.
I know I liked the TV show, although I know people were like crying because they people thought they retcon something.
I did a lot of research on it because I'm a type of person just reads like every everything up on this series.
If it's if I watch the show and don't do the original and I haven't consumed the original media of it.
Yeah, exactly.
It was such a bait switch.
But however, I look when he fights that like shock trooper is probably one of my favorite scenes.
The follow series was pretty good.
I liked it.
I hated Maximus's character with a passion because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for me.
Because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for a knight in a squire to like deal with stuff or if he ended up doing what he did, just not being such a little bitch.
Like, oh, his character was so annoying to me.
Like the main girl, I really like the main girl because I watched this show recently before Fallout came out called Yellow Jackets.
Seriously, highly fucking fucking recommend you watch Yellow Jackets.
It is one of the best survival horror TV shows I've ever watched and so fucking good.
I binged it in the first two seasons.
Oh, no, don't worry.
I'm not going to spoil it.
But but she is one of the main characters in Yellow Jackets.
And so I was already kind of biased.
But then watching her in this, I just really, really fucking like the show.
That the female volleyball team, it was actually a soccer team and they get lost in the wilderness and they have to do fucked up shit to survive.
It was literally like, it reminded me a lot of the ritual and it reminded me a lot of what's it called, the game, Sons of the Forest.
Yeah.
So that was it was a really good show.
And then I ended up watching Euphoria after that, not the one that you're thinking of the one about the angsty teenagers that do a lot of drugs.
Because my friend was like, oh, you remind me of this character and I watched it.
I'm like, why the fuck do I remind you of this character?
I am nothing like this character.
It's only because we look alike because I look like Zendaya.
I don't I don't look like Zendaya.
No, I'm taking that back.
That woman is gorgeous beyond my beyond my dreams that I could ever be.
But in terms of like the hair, the fit, sometimes the attitude, not the drugs.
The only drugs I've only taken is my antidepressants.
Before.
Okie-tokie.
Lucy and the ghoul felt like nails on the truck.
But yeah, yeah, I also yeah, the ghoul story is really cool.
Yeah, everybody everybody else.
I was just like, I don't care about you.
Yours and Dan.
No, I'm not Zendaya.
I'll go out together.
You'll have to ask my boyfriend, Spiderman.
But it was just it was just funny, but I really like that show.
It's a shame that one of the one of the producers died and then one of the actors actually died.
So from that show, so that's why it's been put off.
But it was it was really like it was kind of depressing because I've known people that have grown up in similar situations.
How is Timothy Shamalama Dingdong?
I feel like he would be very whiny.
It's the day of my favorite actress is VTuber.
It's really cool.
One of my friends was actually in a movie with her because she's an actress and she said she's super sweet.
If I ever got okay VTuber ghoul meets Zendaya.
I'm putting it up there.
Never seen Zendaya.
She'd be in the same room.
What about the other Zendaya again?
She gets it too.
I'm not throwing shade at the series.
Just pointed out in terms of the lower retcons.
But there wasn't even lower retcons.
There wasn't even lower retcons though.
Like I will argue with that that for you because everybody's worried about shady sands.
But just because they didn't specify the time that this thing went off that people are getting frustrated with it.
Because I don't feel like they retcons fall out.
What was it? 74?
I can't remember.
I just want to say a quick hello before going to work.
Enjoy work.
I just remember that Tom Holland and Zendaya got engaged.
Honestly, would 100% ship it because they're wholesome.
76, New Vegas.
I don't fucking know.
We're all New Vegas.
Again, I haven't played them.
I literally own all of them because I buy stuff when it's on sale.
I haven't played some.
I was debating whether or not to play fall out New Vegas.
Because I bought it and everything.
When I was going to like the first thing that I play when I debut.
But I think Shibi, Shibi.
Strony is streaming it.
Me and Strony like the same exact fucking games.
Because I was like, I was going to do Assassin's Creed.
I was going to do Skyrim.
I was going to do fall out.
You would watch her for like actual skill and endurance streams.
And then you'd watch me for my absolute shit show that it would be.
Maybe I'll get to those eventually, but I'll probably do them like months down the line.
You went off after New Vegas.
Yeah, exactly.
Like he said, it's like in people.
People think that it went off before.
So.
Sharon Brainsall.
Strony 2.0.
Hey, she calls me her 2.0.
I'm her twin.
I'm just the round American version.
It's always fun watching the first time I play New Vegas.
I've heard, I've heard.
I remember reading places.
They're like, oh, this person is playing New Vegas because the show like a bunch of people will play New Vegas.
And they're like.
I only watch like the first two hours because most of the time they only play the first two hours.
But it's still a fun unique experience because everyone experiences is differently.
What you drinking?
I'm drinking some iced lemon and a tea.
I, uh, was it called Vokeby is like a Korean brand.
They have this really delicious ginger lemon tea that I adore.
Skyrim together and co-op.
Oh, is that a thing?
That'd be sick.
I know people are like, oh, you can play Elden Ring.
And I'm like, maybe.
You guys see me play.
Crab souls.
I don't know if you want to watch me play Elden Ring.
And someone's like, oh, you can call up with Strony.
I'm like, oh, shit, true.
But then I would have to buy the game again because I played, I played and finished the game on my PlayStation, but I didn't finish it or have it in general on my.
Oh, my nose on my PC.
Hold on.
My manager fixed my overlay, so I should be able to use it properly now.
And then we'll get started.
Let me do that.
My own background music is stuck in my head a good chunk of the time.
You're not going to see anything for a second.
It's going to fix this real quick, like.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, I found my.
Skyrim co-op kind of jank though.
Yeah, but that's what makes it fun.
Hey, look at you guys down there near my boobs.
Um.
Hey, what a guan.
What a guan, what a guan.
Hold on.
You ride at dawn.
Well, shit, there's, you guys are too tall.
See now it's just on a circle that just is there.
Is there.
It was fun while it lasted.
What do you mean?
The app?
I'm still going to yap a bunch during Stanley Parable.
It's like a perfect yapping game.
Music stuck in your head.
Oh.
I can't die.
Okay, there we go.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, there's a child screaming running down the hallway.
I'll hear them in a moment.
I think it's finally filtering them out.
Oh, I can't.
Oh, I know why.
I was like, why can't I edit the properties of this
and change the transformation?
Because anytime I lock something, you can't do that.
We're up all night to get lucky.
If we are too tall, you could step on us.
Yeah, put your lucky down for size.
What just happened?
You guys just flew away.
What's up?
Why is it working?
Oh.
I've got to lock a whole thing.
All right, there you go.
Are you happy now?
Is that good?
We did it.
Yeah, I didn't see him out.
We did it.
She finally fixed her overlay and whatever.
She did it.
She did it.
She did it.
She did it.
Okay, fuck my BGM for a second.
Hey, what's up?
Oh my God, what the fuck just happened?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stanley Parable is fucking with my overlord.
Is fucking with my pages.
Oh my God.
That is wild.
Okay, let's try again.
Oh my God, I need to take it off a full screen.
My head in the way.
Actually, I kind of might stick it over there like that
and then move myself.
Phoebe, you should have done this before a stream.
I don't care.
It's funnier when things are scoppy.
Yeah, because it's cutting off the bottom of the screen.
I might have to do a window.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Give it to me now.
Give it to me now.
My dad is asking me why he hasn't heard from me.
What's up, redacted?
What are you doing?
Where are you?
Where are you?
What's up, redacted?
What are you doing?
Where are you?
Sometimes my parents will just text me
and they'll be like, are you alive?
I'm like, yes, I'm alive.
They're like, okay, why haven't you called?
I'm like, because I don't know.
I was like, what is this?
What is this?
Yeah, I don't know why it's the demo.
Yes, because it's only 30 minutes.
I'm not paying for a full game that I know
I'm not going to finish, guys.
Sorry to break it to you.
I'm playing the 30 minute free demo
because I can stretch that shit to five hours
if I really want.
Demo.
I'm alive.
It's the same.
Wait for it to notice.
What do you mean?
Oh, wait, I forgot.
The chats delayed.
I should put the newest stuff first, actually.
No, the demo is actually just like
literally just the first 30 minutes of it.
Oh, my, the game is $24.
I'm, I am a broke bunny.
So I am selling my voice to a weird cuttlefish
I met on the street.
Yeah, but, you know, we just started up.
Don't ignore me.
Just like sweating and being mad.
Aren't you happy I streamed twice today?
You get double the scope.
Listen, I've only been here for a week.
You got to cut me some slack.
Adam's already upset.
No, I'm not upset.
I'm just tired.
I'm just tired.
I just woke up.
It's like my first week here.
I'm just tired.
I'm just tired.
I'm just tired.
I'm just tired.
I'm just tired.
I just woke up.
I think I've done it.
I think I've done it.
I think I've done it.
I think I've done it.
I think I've done it.
I think I've done it.
I think that's good.
Wait, what?
Where did the, huh?
Your names aren't coming up from a little ticker.
But, oh.
Why does stuff break?
Why does it break?
Why do it break?
Why do it break?
Why do it break?
Oh, I know why.
Oh, I know why.
No, I don't know why.
Why is it?
Is it showing y'all?
It's just not.
Please.
Please.
Please, it's all right.
Please, it's all right.
It's all right.
Please, it's all right.
Please, it's all right.
Please, it's all right.
Please, it's all right.
Please, it's all right.
Please, it's all right.
No, I didn't want that in there,
or whatever.
I'm just going to cry quietly
as I do,
as one does, you know.
Oh, crap.
No, wait.
No, wait

It doesn't even matter.
I'm just gonna run in a window anyways.
Okay!
Hey-yo!
Where'd my OBS go?
Oh, there she is.
Oh my god, this still is not the way I want, so I'm just gonna tuck it like that.
How good is this gonna get, ladies and gentlemen?
I also don't know what the master class is.
Age is 16? 9?
An alt becomes a main? No! My alt's not gonna be my main.
I don't know.
I was thinking about it, because I'm like, should I make my alt that my main?
And then I'm like, no, because I get a lot.
It's easier for me to talk to you guys on my actual main than my parent.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
My actual main and my parent.
In my opinion.
Oh!
What the f-
I was like waiting for it to change.
That's quite loud.
It's quite loud. Hold on a moment.

What?
Is this the demo?
What?
Did I go in a circle?
My number is 27.
Oh.
Hi.
Okay.
Waiting room.
Why does that coffee look like blood?
Can I pick stuff up?
What does it say? Stanley Parable demo.
Should I?
Alright, looks like I got to wait.
Sorry guys. I can't sit down, so I'll just...
Okay, I'll sit down over here.
Almost my turn.
Wait, I can't see the chat. What happened to the chat?
Yeah.
Yes, my stuff is clicky.
I made it.
Gorgeous.
Famous demos.
We got...
We got Snake there. We got...
I thought it was Game & Watch for a second.
What is that?
I don't know what these games are.
We were playing the demo. Yes, I'm not spending money on the real game when I'm not going to finish it.
Oh, man.
Wash over you.
I wonder if I get a cool ending if I literally just walked away from my computer and didn't touch anything.
Because I know that shit happens in this game.
That explains clearly and concisely exactly what the Stanley Parable is.
How it plays...
I feel like I'm in office in Counter Strike.
It's probably the same assets.
Oh my god, it is the same assets. I'm nostalgic.
I only just realized that now that they use the same assets.
Let's go with the demo counter.
Here is one such technology.
These buttons are meant to convey the meaning of choice and the impact of the decisions you make.
Can I press a button?
Please. Please let me press the button.
Please.
What is this? Oh, I want to do this one.
All people who select that particular button are sexual predators.
You see, our choices really do illuminate the very intangible nature of our minds and souls.
What the hell is this?
I'm the 6% that's not a sexual predator.
I'm just a sexual deviant.
The buffalo.
Well, technology, oh my god.
No way.
Oh, what the fuck?
Oh, I wanted to walk through the wall like a badass.
I'm actually like pretty out of work. How do I get up there?
I can't get up there, can I? I can't parkour.
Down here.
Just a isolation chamber. They put me in one of those.
Put me in a room, a rubber room.
Rubber room filler ads.
I'm like too low to the ground. I can't reach my keyboard properly.
Raise my chair.
Okay, there we go.
Discovery or despair? Let's go with despair.
These crags that we stood upon, they shielded us from our own ignorance.
I'm not short.
We're probably taller than the majority of you.
Can I see the other ones?
Is there like...
Okay, fine.
Ooh, you went in both boos? Oh, how vulnerable of you.
If at any point during the demo you need to cry, just let me know and we can take a minute.
Demo status, demo compliments.
One of the most important parts of administering any demonstration is pumping out your ego.
Yeah!
...in securities about your sense of self-worth.
I'm ready!
That's why we use this room to develop cheap compliments to share on the production of the demo.
Go ahead and press that button to see some of the superficial flattery we've been cooking up.
I'm excited, okay.
My heavens, I've never met someone who can consume as much uranium in a single sitting as you can.
Just look at you go.
Can I get another compliment?
Of all the people I know who are playing this exact demo at this exact moment
and standing in this exact room, your performance is easily in the top 5,000.
Oh my god.
Oh!
I won't go as far as 4,600.
Oh.
Yeah.
This device tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.
I think I am.
There's also a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.
This game is so meta.
Ooh!
Wait, what?
Wait.
I get turned around a lot.
Ah, now this room is perhaps the most important Joel encounter in the demo.
This is where we determine whether or not the demo has been effective.
No!
What are you doing?
You can't make that decision.
Yeah, you haven't played the demo.
We've put so much work into it.
Is this not the demo?
I was so ready to press no.
Do you want me to turn up the game?
Is it too quiet?
And there you have it.
Everything you need to know about how video game demos are made.
Let them cook.
It's a little quiet.
Okay.
I thought it was too loud.
Meow.
You don't want to simmer or want to broil?
Mmm.
Makes you want to broil you like a little crab and eat you up.
You suck on your little leggies for your sweet, sweet flesh.
However, it's still important that we address safety concerns.
I'm going to jump us up.
Emotion sickness.
Another reason I didn't get this is I think I was going to get really motion sick.
I see you right there.
Please do not press the large red glowing disagree button at this time.
Nothing.
No objections.
You're quite sure about that.
There's no disagree button.
Well, all right then.
In the event that you do experience one or all of the previously listed symptoms.
I'm going to bleed for my anus from playing this game.
You need to convey to me that you wish the demonstration.
Oh, a reflex.
I probably case a calamari.
Ooh, I love calamari.
Don't tell Strani.
What the?
Dance perimeter.
Please perform a dance.
Oh, fuck.
Your dance has been recorded in the event that you feel confused or disoriented by anything you see inside the demo.
Perform that dance and I will terminate the demo immediately.
Okay.
Right.
All preparations have been made.
It is time at the fast.
Are you prepared for a dance perimeter?
Whoa.
It's kind of terrifying.
What?
It kill me?
What's that?
Forget waiting.
Dance perimeter.
I'm so excited.
Oh my God.
Oh well.
I'm making myself dizzy.
Oh wait.
What's this?
Huh?
Can I leave?
Okay.
It's a giant eight.
Eight.
Damn girl.
You really.
Eight.
The outfit up.
Hey man.
Do you eat?
Do you?
Fuck.
I really.
Her pussy the other day.
I really.
His ass.
Running out of the game.
It's like the equivalent of 42.
Should I check who's guy?
I like this game.
Why six or three to seven because 79.
Oh, okay.
I can go backwards.
All right.
I would have been very happy.
I didn't pay for the full game.
No, I like.
I like the Stanley parable.
Stanley parable is a great game.
I've watched people play it.
But again, I don't.
Because it's a long ish game.
I just didn't think I would be able to get through it.
Okay.
Now let's take a minute to get something straight here.
Can I get a soda?
You are assuming an amount of responsibility for its outcome.
Is there anything?
We had us eight in Runderland.
Eight.
I wish I could jump.
This time, please take a minute to think about all of the mistakes you've made in playing this demonstration.
As well as your lack of respect for demo taking in general.
Opening the game.
I shouldn't have gotten the game.
I'm kind of happy.
I didn't make the mistake of buying the full game.
But I kind of like walked and I got turned around a bunch.
Okay.
Why am I so small in the corner?
Hold on.
I just realized I looked over.
I noticed how small I was.
Oh.
I went back.
Well, hello there.
All right.
What is this black void?
I didn't know your asshole was a feature of the game.
Okay.
I can't see shit.
Oh.
Wow.
Did she not detach yet?
I'm sure of it.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We have to get out of here.
We have to find something for you to do anything.
The demo cannot.
It is a good song by Marilyn Martinez.
This way.
Okay.
I love the narrator's voice though.
Surely there must be a game somewhere in here.
Got a giant TV.
Vine boom noise.
Pick it up.
Whoa.
What the fuck?
I can't.
Now put it in the bin.
What if I just wait?
I can't.
What the hell?
Did I just stand on it?
I'm standing on it.
What the fuck?
Can I just fucking break it?
Break stuff.
Disrespect your surroundings.
Oh, I missed.
Okay, I got it.
Disrespect your surroundings.
You did it.
You won.
You know what you get for winning?
An achievement.
Four ton narrator.
I won?
Oh my god.
Can't even see it in there.
I can't see that.
I didn't even see what that said.
She threw it on the ground.
What?
Let me out.
Help me, I'm on fire.
Can I throw myself in the trash?
Don't be on that now, aren't we?
Come along, let's get to the end and the final choice.
I just hope they paid this man so well
because he did such a good job narrating this game.
Ending, ending, where are you?
Where are you?
Oh.
This is where the red disagree button went.
What?
Is this a horror game?
Yes, the end.
Now this is where we want the demo to be.
I think it's time for you to log your final decision
as to whether or not the Stanley Parable is any good.
Oh, sweet.
Please consider very carefully before answering.
Much is at stake.
Is it?
Is it working?
Are you sure?
Are you sure you pressed the button?
Oh, jeez, fuck.
We finished the demo.
Did it start again?
Hello?
Is anyone there?
They already finished.
They said they liked it.
I need someone to stop the demo.
Hello?
Hello?
We need to get out of here.
Let's blow this popsicle stand.
I can't run.
I can crouch.
What the frick?
Let me just go.
No?
All right.
Time to go to the fun room.
What's going on?
Where is everyone?
Okay.
Over to the left.
Down this way.
Ow, my ears.
Quick in the isolation chamber.
Oh, nice and quiet.
Finally.
I suppose we can both agree that I failed.
My job was to be a teacher.
You remember the isolation chamber?
Yeah, I was.
I saw it.
Exactly what the Stanley Parable is supposed to be.
But somehow I couldn't.
Well, at any rate, I don't know if I care for the Stanley Parable anymore.
Scammed.
Do you think any of this is actually in the main game?
Honestly, I don't think so.
Ever ball out of time, chamber?
That even looked like.
No.
I think I've had enough of it.
No more doors.
No more demonstrations.
No more endings.
I wonder if this guy has voice acted like anything else,
or like, because I just feel like he should be an actor in a movie.
It's so lovely.
I kind of want to eat the leaves on this plant.
They're edible, right?
Excuse me.
Can I eat this chair?
Can I pick anything up?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
What the fuck?
How the hell did I get here?
God?
Jesus, please.
Holy ghost.
Make it stop.
Thank you, the cup.
What?
We never did that until now.
What?
Huh?
What?
Ah!
What?
This is such a creative thing to do for a demo, though.
Ah!
What the fuck?
He's just teleporting me.
Let's eat everything.
I just like to chew on stuff, to be honest with you.
Where is it?
Where is it?
I'm in an elevator, please.
I'm getting so much motion sickness from the...
Yeah, that's another reason why I didn't think I could play it.
I'm also whipping around.
It's easier, like, it's easier on me right now
because I'm controlling it and I know what I'm going to do.
But for you guys, I'm just like,
Sorry.
Release me.
The madam cannot be caged.
Oh, this looks like their original game.
Taking sippies.
Hell yeah, guys, it's out now.
Okay, maybe I should have gotten the game.
Because I thought the demo was like the first 30 minutes of the game.
But I was wrong.
I was incorrect.
Out now? No way.
It's always the next time.
It really depends.
Like, I don't know if you guys want me to play it.
Oh, for real, damn.
They should bring Stanley Paramore to our attention.
Don't buy it.
Commit to the bit.
Yeah, you know, I'm not going to, you know,
purchase a game from a company
that's, you know, romanticizing,
working,
working for the man, you know?
You never do the demo.
How do you need content as a new one?
Did you, if I did buy the game for the bit?
Yeah, for the bit.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Should I get it?
Do you know for the bit?
We've been troll requests for a second.
Yeah.
What's the difference between the ultra deluxe
and the,
and the normal one?
You could go back to Class of 09.
Maybe.
We could, we could.
Yeah, I get it.
Has a bucket ending.
Play games usually.
Yeah, I know.
I just,
I'm sorry.
I feel like this is not one of my better streams
since I'm like half asleep.
I shouldn't have fallen asleep
to, um,
to, to icy stuff.
Hmm.
Oh, don't give me a second.
I'll do better for you.
Oh, what the fuck?
Where did I go?
What's happening?
Guys?
Are you there?
Are you there?
Hello?
Guys?
With that, she's gone.
I'm just a disembodied voice
with some background music now.
I just got Thanos snapped.
Oh, man.
Guys.
I can't.
I can't.
Wait, I woke up.
She's gone.
We're free.
Guys, I don't know what happened.
I guess.
I guess I was just a figment
of your imagination the entire time.
I'm so sorry.
My whole body flew away.
I'm in the walls.
I'm just talking to you
within the walls.
I'm in your walls.
I'm in your walls.
I'm in your walls.
Next evolution of VTubing.
No one there.
What happened?
That's crazy.
Hold on.
I had the ropes and whips.
This is truly the meaning
of the Stanley Parable.
Bad ending.
We took the meds.
So I played Needy Schumer Overdose.
Overloaded Overdose.
I forget.
You have to play Uno.
I'm wide awake.
Yeah, I was in the dark.
Hello?
Oh, no.
I broke myself.
Could you believe me
if I told you this was all intentional?
Because it actually is.
It's all...
It's all a figment
of your imagination.
Whoa.
Wait, but why am I not moving?
Please.
What the hell just happened?
Why am I moving in slow mo...
Guys, I'm not even...
That was so creepy.
What is happening?
Guys, I had closed...
I closed the app
and it was still moving and talking.
What's going on?
Why do I look so creepy?
My models are slowly moving back and forth.
Okay, okay.
What's going on?
I don't know.
What happened there?
Oh, we're broke broke.
We always been broke broke.
I'm stalling.
I'm just stalling.
Don't worry about it.
I'm stalling
for time.
We're reaching levels of scoff.
That shouldn't be possible.
You know what my temptation is right now?
Is
is
is just going to play in RuneScape
and stream sniping her.
That sounds fun.
Text...
I've never played RuneScape before.
Excuse me.
I remember growing up
in that aforementioned
after school program.
We had like a computer room and stuff.
And um,
I don't know why my model is like freaking out,
but I'll just let her do her thing.
And this kid was playing RuneScape
on one of the computers.
And I'm like, oh, that looks really fun and cool.
Can I play?
And he's like, nah,
this is only for boys.
And I'm like,
oh, and I like genuinely believed him
that only boys could play for some reason.
So I never played RuneScape.
Secret cheapy horse stream.
But I just stare awkwardly at you.
And my body jerks around.
Mastered the power of scuff and nightmares.
If only I had like multiple models
to run right now.
Maybe I can like cut off my head.
That would take too long though.
As I cut off my head.
Damn it.
Damn it.
So um,
how was your day?
My stall,
I'm losing,
I'm losing my stalling ability.
Finishing levels.
Yeah,
I just beat the entire game.
That's crazy.
Pass bad at your per...
Yeah, I know.
I'm like...
For the funny.
RuneScape is 90% male player base
even today.
Most MMOs at 50-50.
Oh, interesting.
Although,
I would probably just like make,
see if I can um,
see if I can like trick
strongy
into falling in love with me online.
You think I can groom my gen mate
in RuneScape
without her knowing?
Streep's not the color fish.
Got to like kick out.
Be like,
hey, I'm Kyle.
I'm Kyler.
I'm a huge fan.
I'm also from
insert where strongy is from
here.
Headless sheebie return?
Show sports and such huh?
Talk,
taking sheebie to the
willdy?
Alright,
I forgot we had the prehensile
hair.
That was a real horror stream.
Yeah, I'm trying to think of
something funny to do
for 6K on Twitter
with the
3D thing.
I'm like trying to get
manager to make something for me,
but I have to think of a song
in a dance.
Uh huh.
I've had Karba stuck in my head
for a long time.
Don't worry about my models.
She,
we're fine.
She's good.
I'm good.
It's good.
Don't worry about it.
Oh no.
My stream just
disappeared.
Oh no.
Oh god.
Hahaha.
Karba's a bitch.
I should have known better
if I was a bitch.
Oh wow.
Whoa.
Holy crap.
Hold on.
Something's happening.
I don't know what,
but something's going on.
Going on.
Like Donkey Kong.
Oh my god.
Where did I?
What is happening?
Whoa.
Wowee, Zowie.
My stream for a little bit longer today.
Just to make up for all the scuff
and me just talking about nothing.
I just look,
why do I look high as fuck?
Whoa, what is this?
That's crazy.
Where did this come from?
Whoa.
This is not what I was stalling for
or anything.
I'm having absolute fuck all.
Oh wow.
What a cool game.
Nice zoo.
Yeah.
I'm starting over
because I beat the game.
So you know,
I'm just going to start over.
Let me just,
that's fun.
Is she beyond the saw?
No.
Well, I'm tired,
so I bet some people will be like,
I'm pretty sure she was high as fuck.
No, I'm just tired.
Especially because it was up at 6 a.m.
Come as a bitch,
I should know better.
I wonder why she lagged.
I know, right?
I don't.
Really crazy how that's,
you know,
V-Soup Studio just has its moments.
Crazy.
Wow, that's crazy.
You'll never know,
Somnis Vivarum.
You'll never know.
Your name sounds like a spell from Elden Ring.
How weird, huh?
Of a girl named Sheebie.
Sheebie worked for a big company.
This is clearly source.
I'm playing the normal one.
The source is funny anyway.
The source is funny anyway.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.

I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
I'm playing the normal one.
Stanley was happy.
And then one day something peculiar happened.
This is the arrow.
This is me right now.
Something that would forever change Stanley.
Something he would never quite forget.
He had been at his desk for nearly an hour
when he realized that not one
single order
had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.
No one had sure not to do this.
Yeah, yeah, you have no regrets.
You know mods destroy him.
就可以
not kitchen
thank you
man this sound horrible. what do you mean?
what doesn't sound horrible?

My stream died for me.
And I lost like half of everybody.
Oh my god.
He really got teleported to Kiara's stream.
Oh no.
Everybody literally is gone.
Do I give up?
Do I just...
Do I just end it here?
I got the funniest ending just by sitting in the thing as I died.
I didn't even fucking notice.
What the fuck?
Why can't I leave?
No mourners, no funerals.
Come on.
Please.
Forever.
I will be happy.
Stanley waited.
Hours passed.
Then days.
Had years gone by.
He no longer had the ability to tell.
But the one thing we knew for sure...
Give me the fuck out of here.
Was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.
Oh my god.
I'm literally gonna go crazy.
Soon.
Very soon now.
This will end.
He will be spoken to.
He will be told what to do.
Please, please, please, please, please.
I'm just getting claustrophobic.
The walls are closing in.
Stream is having serious issues.
What the fuck?
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
I think because the stream is just being so fucky for some reason, I might...
I'm also having really bad lagging issues looking back at my own stream.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh my god.
What the fuck?
Jesus.
I just know it's gonna die on me again because when this happens a bunch...
When this happens a bunch, I know my stream is gonna hold on,
but I'm like super tempted to do something before that.
I like really want to go on RuneScape and bother Shawnee.
Let me turn off Stanley Parable.
I'm sorry guys.
How do I... Do I have to make an account?
Okay.
Old school RuneScape.
I'm just gonna casually stream.
Don't tell her.
Don't fucking tell her.
Don't tell her.
You little bitches.
I know you fucking want to.
You little bitches.
It's free to make the account.
All right.
I've never played RuneScape in my life.
My internet lasts long enough.
Hold on.
We'll find out.
I just think my computer just can't handle the Stanley Parable for some reason.
That's kidding.
No, it's just my...
Oh, what the fuck?
I'm so done with the asking for cookies.
What's my birthday?
September 28th.
September 28th.
Oh, I have to check a verification code.
Fuck me.
Please choose an account name.
Hold on.
I need a cool name.
Guys, help me pick a name.
Can you guys help me think of a name?
Stanley Parable is running through Portal 2.
Oh, is it?
Why do I look so demonic?
Why are my eyes just like...
The child in yellow, whatever that game is called.
Help me think of a cool name.
I need a cool badass name for RuneScape.
Oh, wait.
Does it matter if I have a username?
And then I just make a character name.
Is the username different from the character name?
Not Sheebie.
The Sheedmeister.
Mr. Siappet.
Darkened McOrphan Pain.
Sheebie Detroit.
No, Ben.
Get destroyed.
Remove yourself from the premises.
Terrible.
Shubby.
The Sheebie Parable.
Baroness, cotton bum.
Hold on.
Let's do this for my account name.
Why is that not allowed?
Serious?
Why is this name not allowed?
Oh my god.
Wait, I forgot how to spell Mistress.
What?
That's what works.
Are you serious?
It wouldn't let me do Sheebie Cotton Bum
or Sheebie Cotton.
It wouldn't let me do Cotton or Sheebie.
I don't...
Wait, I have to download the game?
I just want to play Old School RuneScape.
I thought that was a game you just play in the window.
I'm literally gonna cry.
Can you...
I'm gonna strangle their webpage
because this is not loading.
Okay, Cotton.
Yeah, but like...
Oh.
There's almost 200 people on this.
On this game.
Come on, I just want to play RuneScape.
I'm gonna strangle too.
Holy crap.
You created a new character for me.
Lovely.
Create.
Manage.
Why is this so confusing?
What is...
Am I dumb?
Wait, I have to get to...
Okay, I'm done. Never mind then.
If I have to do the tutorials and everything
and I just can't go and just like try to kill Strawny as a joke
or like try to flirt with her or something
and be a cringe
then I'm not dumb enough.
I'll do that later then.
Tutorial, I could speedrun through it?
No.
It was all fine.
We're just gonna raid...
Just gonna raid mom.
We're just gonna raid mom.
I don't know why I'm so tired.
Maybe because I didn't go to sleep till 1am again.
Then I woke up at 6am.
I'm not the best bunny.
I'm a bad bunny.
Are you seeing bad bunny?
Wait.
Hold on, let me see who's streaming.
I see the...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
God!
Too many windows open!
Strawny it is.
Alright.
Later nerds.
I'm gonna go in a...
Emen Hera somewhere.
Somewhere else.
So I apologize for the scuff.
But um...
I think you know.
It's just you know...
It's a part of me.
I was born with it.
I was molded by the scuff.
And my internet keeps changing.
I love you.
Bye!
No I don't.
I don't fucking love you.
Don't get the fucking head.
Fuck you.
