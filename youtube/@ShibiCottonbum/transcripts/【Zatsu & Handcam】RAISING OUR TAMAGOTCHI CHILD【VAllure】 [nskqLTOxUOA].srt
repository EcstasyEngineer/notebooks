00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,640
Um, but yes, I fixed my camera as you can see everything is fine

26
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,120

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,160
Um, so I think we're gonna be okay

35
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520

He's helping with cable management. I don't think so

324
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,800
At least he's laying the other way now, but now his back feet are kicking at the keyboard

325
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
No, boomie, please

326
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
You left me with our child

327
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,840
I'm not even I haven't even like gotten to the actual tomagotchi part

328
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Oh

329
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840

00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,200
I have to do this again. Oh my god

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Oh my god, boomie

333
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Boomie

334
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,880
Stop I'm begging you boomie

335
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
boomie

336
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Please don't bite me

337
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,640
No, no, please. I'm being assault

338
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
guys

339
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,280
No, I'm not going for you. I'm trying to tap my keyboard and you're in the way

340
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Okay

341
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,120
I was like, oh this will probably like be a quick stream or something today

342
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,000
Because there's probably not a lot to do no boomie just takes over and I have any bits but 40 minutes

343
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And I have even typed in my freaking name yet

344
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:29,120
Boomie stop you almost log you almost you almost I can't even

345
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,440
This is another like I I understand the girls play it when they can't

346
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,120
Get stuff done because of stuff around them

347
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:55,440
Uh because boomie is the reason why I can't record sometimes because he just makes a lot of noise or he'll lay on my desk like this

348
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,120
But if I tried putting him in another room he would probably um

349
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
Start screaming so

350
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
I

Okay

497
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,360
I don't understand

498
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,680
I got a care icon

499
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,920
I don't know what that means

500
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Sheebie

501
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,720
Why are you saying my name?

502
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,640
Guys, I don't know what's wrong with this thing. Hold on. What status?

503
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,480
I don't have any money you're not happy

504
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,680
I don't know what to do in this situation

505
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,120
Look at that

506
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,360
A thing I've been around babies

507
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,680
This one's just annoying

508
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,360
Are you hungry?

509
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:11,920
No snacks. I'll give you a cookie. Want a cookie? Can a baby eat a cookie?

510
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,080
You

511
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:23,920
Can have a cookie and some milk that sounds like a balanced uh a balanced breakfast

512
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,240
Just give him an iPad. No, no kid child of mine would be an iPad kid

513
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,560
Okay, I want to see

514
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,680
Does that make it less hungry? Okay, so maybe I have to feed him all the way

515
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,160
Because you can see the

516
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
I guess I have to feed you just a bunch

517
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,640
Have we named our child? No, the child's name is Thing

518
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:29,280
You want to name the child jelly donut bar? I wasn't starving our child

519
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,040
The child should learn to communicate its wants

520
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,320
Give it a good do I just ever run out of these things?

521
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,800
You

522
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,520
The thing from fantastic four it's a baby. No, it's a tomagotchi

523
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:02,720
The child wouldn't learn a name when it gets into medical school. Yeah, no child of mine is going to be walking around crying

524
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:08,400
At the age of zero. I don't care if you were just born. Where are you going?

525
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,760
Oh my god, is it point with the toilet seat?

526
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
My kids in imbecile

527
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:24,480
Just played with the toilet seat. Why are you doing that? Do you need to use it?

528
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,200
Do you need to sleep?

529
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,520
Why does it sleep like that? Girls look like a cat

530
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,640
Did you have a good nap at least you're like starting to interact with the environment

531
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,080
Is he drinking from the toilet?

532
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,040
Are you staring at those flowers like that, bro?

533
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,720
I don't know about this one guys this baby might need to be put down

534
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,320
Okay, I'm gonna feed it one more time. Okay, at least it's not okay. Okay. I think I think I got it. I think I got it

535
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,000
Come back inside and have some milk

536
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,520
Before I take you out behind the shed

537
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Okay, so you're full now

538
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,480
So like when do you evolve and go to college? This is called tomagotchi uni

539
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,440
What does this do actually

540
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,680
Can't use now

541
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:51,760
I can't believe it's just a why do they think like a cleaning robot is a good kids toy

542
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,040
We could step on their role play that'd be funny

543
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:08,640
Yeah, the moment he turns 18 gone his child's gone. What are you doing?

544
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,600
Why is it like excited about jelly beans

545
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,840
Get off the table. Why are you jumping around the table?

546
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:28,480
Why is this child like a weird apostrophe? I gave birth to an apostrophe

547
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,760
You know what this is a travesty

548
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,440
Come on focus the camera doesn't even want to focus on this weird ass baby

549
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
What

550
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:54,320
Are you good are you fine with the hellscape that is the background can you like watch tv or something?

551
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
I

552
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,640
Don't like jelly beans

553
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,520
Me once we kick it out at 18 and get back to the fun business we can have the fun business now

554
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,440
He looks like an yeah, look at that never mind

555
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,480
Look at the camera instead it's you look at this

556
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:28,880
This this is a why does it do that? What are you doing? Are you stinky?

557
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,880
It looks it looks kind of weird. I don't like it that it moves like that

558
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,720
Get your stinky self out the kitchen

559
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,720
Oh

560
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,640
What the heck how does it poop?

561
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,200
Okay

562
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,520
I feel like you need a shower after that. I feel like you just dropped a log

563
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,120
You guys know I have maternal instincts not for whatever this thing is

564
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:29,040
Okay, maybe if it gets still a hundred percent happy it will

565
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,320
Die, I mean it will evolve into a better pokemon

566
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,160
And when I say pokemon I mean tomagachi

567
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,440
Why does everything have a face that's a great question

568
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:57,200
Yeah, it'll die happy milk. Okay. Yeah, I get it. You're not hungry

569
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,580
What if I let you play with the Roomba

570
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,160
Focus

571
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,600
Why was that so funny

572
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,400
Yeah, my child is small everything has faces

573
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,400
Okay, at least it's not crying immediately. What's the care I'm calling?

574
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,120
Oh

575
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,440
My god

576
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,640
Okay, this game is a lot more elaborate, maybe it'll be funner when um

577
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,480
Social

578
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,360
You can see who who died in the past

579
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:08,240
Let's use the rattle for a moment

580
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,720
My favorite toy is a child who's Roomba

581
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,080
To be fair he's almost 30 minutes old now. I know why doesn't he have a 401k?

582
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,600
Why does he have a raw IRA?

583
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,960
I don't know these things

584
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,080
Rattle the child

585
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880

That's it.

699
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,120
Time to take your kit away.

700
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,120
I'll see you in court.

701
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
Actually, you know what?

01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,320

703
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,320

704
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,320

705
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,320

01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:52,820

01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,120
I'm gonna take a bath.

709
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,120
Actually, he's a toilet.

710
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,120
No?

711
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,120
I always gotta drop a deuce when I wake up.

712
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,120
What are you talking about?

713
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,120
Alright, well, we're bathing you.

714
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,120
You're gonna divorce me!

715
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,120

716
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,120

Anybody who mentions divorce?

718
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,120
Time them out.

719
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,120
Mods?

720
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,120
Anybody who tries to take away my child?

721
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,120
Time them out.

722
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,120
Mods?

723
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,120
Cast a stickler torsion.

724
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,120
Make it so they can never have kids again.

725
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,120
Or use their pee-pee.

726
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,120
Sheepie has mods.

727
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,120
Today I do, apparently, because it worked.

728
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,120
What was I gonna say?

729
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,120
You know why I hate this child?

730
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,120
Because you left me.

731
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,120
Wait, my neighbors are walking by.

732
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,120
I don't want to think I'm on the phone with somebody.

733
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:23,120
You left me alone to fend for myself.

734
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,120
Because you didn't wrap it up.

735
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,120
I never wanted a child out of wedlock.

736
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,120
And you left me.

737
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,120
You left me.

738
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,120
Don't like time them out for too long, though.

739
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,120
Mods, be gentle.

740
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,120
Add lore to my apartment.

741
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,120
Okay, they're close to being full happy.

742
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,120
Milk.

743
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,120
Pheromband.

744
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,120
You can't get pheromband on youtube, I don't think.

745
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,120
Well that wouldn't make sense, because 1.

746
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,120
It was with B.B.

747
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,120
2. It was her bum.

748
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,120
What are you doing, child?

749
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,120
Play with the rattle.

750
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,120
Mommy's busy.

751
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,120
Go play with the Roomba.

752
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,120
Mommy's busy.

753
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:48,120

01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,200

01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:18,000
I'm not even looking at the screen. I'm looking at my OBS as I go through

01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:32,460

I

01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,200
When my mods are around I wield too much power

763
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200
I

764
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:30,960
At least he isn't watching vTubers. That's a good point. No child of mine will watch vTubers or be a weeb

765
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,480
No child of mine. I

766

01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,900
Toma fashion, ooh

1052
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:58,180
That's great, but like how do I do that these are ugly

1053
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:05,140
Wait, isn't that from I swear that was from Zelda what the glasses

1054
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:11,380
Toma means ball ball fashion

1055
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:17,060
Buying a haptic suit right now that sounds so cool though

1056
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:21,780
God, I don't know how that works, but I want to do it so bad now. I have to do research

1057
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:26,580
Because I've never done like 3d and I get usually like motion sick in a VR headset

1058
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:28,820
So I'd probably be like for like an hour. I could do stuff

1059
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:31,620
Oh

1060
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:39,620
Okay, isn't that from Zelda the glasses and that's a samurai

1061
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:43,860
Oh, this is cute

1062
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:48,500
I'm feeling it. I don't know what that is. Is that a sleeping mask?

1063
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:52,180
Is that like an America thing?

1064
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:55,380
That's just nothing

1065
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:58,100
How much is how much is this fit

1066
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:01,220
I like the bow on it

1067
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:09,380
It's from Toma, North America. Why do we have the most horrible fashion sense?

1068
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,500
No, I don't have any money

1069
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:25,940
VR chats very Pete very very there's like clubs and stuff I have no idea about that

1070
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:33,540
Until I figured out that a certain vtuber used to do those things and they're a big vtuber in a certain company now

1071
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:38,580
And I and then there was a whole drama about that and I'm like wait what that's a thing and then

1072
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:45,060
Like I don't know. It was like something something people used to go to these clubs and chats. I don't know

1073
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:54,980
Project melody yeah, I've seen like I know like I think like a lot of them have VR chat models

1074
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:57,940
I don't know how much those are though

1075
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:03,140
That's the travel. Where's the games?

1076
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:15,060
Wait, hold on. I don't want it to talk sweet if it does

1077
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,300
You

1078
01:57:25,460 --> 01:57:30,820
Your chat's pretty crazy. Well, that's fine. Like I'm pretty crazy. So like that'd be super fun

1079
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:33,700
like come on like

1080
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:36,020
I've been on

1081
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:40,820
Orange house of orange and I've seen VR chat stuff on there and I'm like, hey

1082
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:48,020
That just checks my updates

1083
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:53,380
How did I get back home? What the frick?

1084
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,100
I was doing stuff

1085
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:08,020
Guys how much are VR chat models looking up right now?

1086
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:18,020
I might go back

1087
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:25,380
How much are the haptic stuff? Look it up right now. I'll start crowdfunding it

1088
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:30,260
Update required

1089
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:43,860
Okay

1090
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:48,740
It costs between 101k that's fine

1091
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:54,340
Scratch would be pricey

1092
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:03,220
How much is um the like body tracking stuff

1093
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:12,500
Well, I don't need like a crazy model like my model is not that elaborate good suits can be $5,000

1094
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:18,820
Yeah, there's like a VR chat like strip club. I would like I'm like yo

1095
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,020
I can get my copy for like 500 bucks

1096
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:30,260
Hmm

1097
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:33,700
Interesting

1098
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:36,020
Be cool. I never used VR chat

1099
01:59:36,020 --> 01:59:41,220
I've actually no I've been in VR chat once and that was when it was the whole like knuckle knuckles thing

1100
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:43,700
Wakanda knuckles and be like, do you know the way?

1101
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:46,980
And the first time I went in there

1102
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:50,500
I was on a cute little anime girl and I'm walking around and they're just like

1103
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:54,580
Are you the princess? Are you the queen? Are you the queen? Do you know the way? Do you know the way?

1104
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:57,060
And I'm like what's that there's like 50 of them surrounding me

1105
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:59,620
Show us the way

1106
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:02,180
That was one of the best times in internet history in my opinion

1107
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:05,780
You can't take me back to those simpler times

1108
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:10,020
Are you the queen

1109
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:16,420
These VR chats desktop mode. Is there a desktop mode? Oh, that's what I did. I didn't have a VR headset. So

1110
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:23,300
Yeah, I went on there for like an hour and then just never went back. I'm trying to find the games

1111
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:30,900
Speak speak to the my brothers to hook to the original hoktua

1112
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:37,460
Is this games no

1113
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,500
Oh

1114
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:47,460
Yes, hello that's in japanese

1115
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:54,500
That must be these must be people who are actually like in the tomiverse right now, which is cool

1116
02:00:55,940 --> 02:01:00,420
Oh my god, that guy is cracked out. He's high af

1117
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:03,380
I

1118
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:09,700
Just assuming because he's let's that was rude of me to assume because he's just fine

1119
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:22,020
Why is a sad shark have a trumpet these are adult tomas why am I just a child walking around?

1120
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:29,300
Hello welcome back

1121
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,660
I

1122
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:35,300
Plugging from the matrix

1123
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:41,940
I already got crap all over the screen

1124
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:52,980
So some of the vive trackers

1125
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:59,540
Parastrictions gloves pro con warudo. Oh, yes. I've seen warudo

1126
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:04,820
I probably would use warudo for tracking because wario is pretty good and it's like kind of made for vtubers

1127
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:15,060
How do I get more money

1128
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:25,140
I

1129
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:27,380
When do I get to play games?

1130
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:32,980
Guys I can't play any games

1131
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,500
Full body stuff would be cool

1132
02:02:53,700 --> 02:02:55,700
You

1133
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:08,340
Is very aesthetically pleasing I like pastel pink this pink is my favorite color as you can tell

1134
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:15,620
Tomodachi life isn't tomodachi life still around

1135
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:20,100
No, wait. No, it's not I'm thinking of something else

1136
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:24,100
You mainly used it to sit in front of me hers

1137
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:32,500
Guys my tummy hurts it's your fault. Why didn't you why did you let me have a milkshake with no lactate?

1138
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:56,740
Did it clean up the blocks no, I didn't

1139
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:10,740
I was freaking yoinked those

1140
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:18,340
I thought they were gonna announce tomodachi life at the last Nintendo direct

1141
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:23,060
It was super janky

1142
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:32,100
Yeah, instead of con meetups, I'll give you like a little a little dancey poo

1143
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:38,420
Your VR chat, I don't think I'd ever do a con meetup. That sounds scary

1144
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:41,060
I

1145
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:50,900
Would be scared to cosplay myself because I know people would know it'd be me immediately

1146
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:58,180
You get on your knees for me did a con meetup

1147
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:04,740
I would only do a

1148
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:10,180
A IRL con meetup if all the other real or girls were there too

1149
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:19,780
Some very freaky people in VR chat

1150
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:24,340
I need to do research on this because that sounds very interesting

1151
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:30,100
Because I think I like I've seen VR chat stuff on the house of orange and it looks kind of stupid, but um

1152
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:34,500
You know it gets I get some people going so I'd be willing

1153
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:40,580
No robot that'd be fun too. I would chase you guys down

1154
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:44,500
We were supposed to go to a con but then they kicked us out

1155
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:52,100
Well, that's because of just like certain people telling management. We shouldn't be there

1156
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,420
Hey

1157
02:05:56,020 --> 02:06:00,340
Which bummed me out, but it's whatever we'll get new more con appearances

1158
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:15,380
I've seen girls do stuff on VR chat with fans their force mute and give inset models

1159
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:17,380
What

1160
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:23,620
You meet like

1161
02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:29,220
Like the girls were of you or the oh, yeah, no you yeah, no no everybody we force muted

1162
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:34,500
But you can have any models so if you come in looking like Shrek, you know what I'm there

1163
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:41,860
Yeah, there's this there's this people that just still have a hate boner for us

1164
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:47,140
For for past stuff that has nothing to do with us. So they're just like, oh wait, they're part there

1165
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:50,100
They know that person. Well, we're going in the mouth

1166
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:54,180
Oh, we're full

1167
02:06:54,260 --> 02:07:00,180
But you just you reached out to us months in advance and we were finalizing things and you're suddenly full. Okay

1168
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:04,820
You give me default model

1169
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:12,740
But mad on people can get offensive models, uh, stop rolling the child. Well, I'm bored

1170
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:16,340
Oh, that's a good point

1171
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:23,060
No, I know I know literally guys. I got it wasn't about us. It was like how we are it was because people don't like

1172
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:26,820
Strutting

1173
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:29,780
Uh

1174
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:39,460
Because of past stuff which makes has nothing to do with stuff currently and she's the most loveliest person a lot of people have realized that so

1175
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:43,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you didn't hear it from me

1176
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:50,500
But yeah, certain certain people

1177
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:56,420
Told certain management of a certain place that we shouldn't be invited there

1178
02:07:57,300 --> 02:08:02,740
And then because that person was on the team there, but uh, yeah

1179
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:05,700
She's a good she's good soup

1180
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:07,540
She's a good egg

1181
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:09,540
She doesn't deserve it

1182
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:15,220
Like I don't care. Like I'll like if they're just like everybody else can go except for her. I'll be like nah, bro

1183
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,460
That's not happening

1184
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:28,660
Why do people act like you guys are prostitutes? No, it's literally guys. It's not because of the content we do because there's also

1185
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:31,860
YouTubeers and stuff, but um, it's just other stuff

1186
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:35,940
Was that the bite of 87 is this?

1187
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,300
But I'm so bitter about it

1188
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:46,420
I probably shouldn't be talking about it, but it is what it is. I'm being vague enough. I think

1189
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:50,820
Yeah, it's personal stuff, which makes me sad

1190
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:58,020
People people already draw lines in the sand. Um

1191
02:08:58,820 --> 02:09:04,660
Because of past stuff that happened over a year ago. Like it's so silly for me

1192
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:09,300
I'm very unfortunate

1193
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:15,380
But there'll be more cons and I'm excited to go to more cons. I've never been to a vtuber con before

1194
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:21,780
Yeah, there's always people that like yeah, it's not like just us like I know

1195
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:28,580
Like what there's people like off-kai like got like stuff before or like other cons

1196
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:31,460
I don't know if it happened at Vexpo or anything

1197
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:36,420
Um, or like any other vtuber conventions or like anime or whatever

1198
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,060
Yeah, we'll get invites. Yeah

1199
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,860
Hello, hi, my name is sheebie cotton bum

1200
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:48,340
If you're someone who's looking to have people be on panels at a con

1201
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:49,940
It would be really cool

1202
02:09:49,940 --> 02:09:55,540
If you got us because we're really swell and we can educate people about avtubers and that they're all not all bad

1203
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:57,700
Okay, thank you

1204
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:01,460
I'm quite nice

1205
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,300
Beat child beat child beat child

1206
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:16,180
It's more so that I get angry because like she doesn't deserve it, you know, she's so sweet. She's too sweet for that

1207
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:27,460
Eat cereal, okay, you're not hungry. Dang you look really sad

1208
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:39,540
I don't think they got do they have they got in the baths sons

1209
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:44,740
You think that has a bidet

1210
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:48,340
You think you hear cps

1211
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:56,420
I'm gonna say something slightly out of pocket but mad at calling a good boy

1212
02:10:57,060 --> 02:11:04,180
If no, I understand. I was just asking what makes you think you deserve to be called a good boy

1213
02:11:04,580 --> 02:11:06,580
Huh, what have you done?

1214
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,900
What have you done for me?

1215
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:11,860
Hmm

1216
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:14,980
Explain

1217
02:11:16,180 --> 02:11:18,180
Explain yourself

1218
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:22,580
You just waltz up in here and ask to be called a good boy for no reason

1219
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:26,980
You think wrong

1220
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:30,020
You think this is me poking your eye out

1221
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:32,820
You think wrong

1222
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:36,500
Oh

1223
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:38,820
The good boy isn't for free

1224
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:51,060
I should not have a hand cam

1225
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:58,100
Poke the eye poke the eye poke the eye

1226
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:00,340

Wait, hold on I need to do this my sleeve up

1233
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:54,900
Oh

02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:56,980
Get the contact. Oh my god

1235
02:12:57,860 --> 02:13:00,900
Shibi that's when you were to show for the gamer subs

1236
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:04,180
Well, this is just lemonade

1237
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:08,180
It's lemonade with like I don't even know

1238
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:14,820
I don't even know what it's called. It's a type of lemonade. It's called berry blast

1239
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:24,180
I

1240
02:13:25,060 --> 02:13:31,620
Um, bro, when when mad I'm responding to my messed up body temperature started to increasing am I cooked?

1241
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,540
Yeah, you're cooked

1242
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:35,700
You're cooked like an egg on the sidewalk, brother

1243
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:44,020
This looks like a wi-fi symbol

1244
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:48,660
That was gonna play with

1245
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:51,620
I

1246
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:58,580
Saw I see added a Tibetan singing bowl to her throne for whatever reason I have one

1247
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:20,660
Yeah, I can get pretty big

1248
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:24,020
Uh

1249
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:29,540
You guys forget that in my PL. I was a priestess. So I have a lot of um

1250
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:36,900
I'm gonna see is there anything in here that will expose me. I have a lot of like witchy stuff up here. This is my altar

1251
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:41,780
I've got a bird skull and I have a crystal ball

1252
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:44,420
And I have some sage and some other stuff

1253
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:46,420
And I have some sage and some other stuff

1254
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:56,420
I'm a pagan

1255
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:03,700
I see as a kalimba, I would love a kalimba

1256
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:09,140
Pagan she be a some more when uh, I'm probably not gonna do that

1257
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:15,780
Uh until emmy does because that's kind of her niche. So I'm not gonna do that

1258
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,900
Um until she does it

1259
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:27,460
Uh, because I have like I used to do a lot of tarot card reading and stuff when I was rena

1260
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:34,580
And I would have witchy streams or educated people about the pagan origins of holidays and stuff and that was really fun

1261
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:36,820
Um

1262
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:45,460
Killed a bird for decoration. No, this bird was already dead my friend, uh, salem

1263
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:50,580
Um found the bird skull and gave it to me

1264
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:54,820
Me and emmy do it together

1265
02:15:54,820 --> 02:15:58,340
Uh, probably I know she's wanted me because emmy's new to

1266
02:15:59,060 --> 02:16:00,260
Uh

1267
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:05,060
Like the to to practicing so I would totally um teacher stuff

1268
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:12,660
And I know uh mercy is also into that

1269
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:18,820
And I was gonna do tarot reading with dempa, but I was sick. Oh, no, uh, sorry. Fio was sick

1270
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:27,140
Loved another pagan origin of christmas. Uh, I would love to redirect you to my

1271
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:34,180
My pl because I had a video literally I had I made a whole ass slideshow about the pagan origins of christmas

1272
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:36,420
But I can't do that. So I'm sorry

1273
02:16:40,580 --> 02:16:42,580
I never watched owl house

1274
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:45,460
It would be a great, uh, great collab. Yes, indeed

1275
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:48,900
Do I still have the slideshow actually?

1276
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:53,460
Let me see

1277
02:16:57,780 --> 02:16:59,780
I

1278
02:17:01,460 --> 02:17:06,340
Would have to pull up all the image files. No, I'm not doing that. I'd have to dig for those

1279
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:17,220
But um, no, I'm not one of like the astrology bitches. I just like crystals crystals. I do a lot more than that. Um, I'm not a poser

1280
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:20,100
I've been practicing for many years

1281
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:23,300
Because christian trauma

1282
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:30,420
Uh, but yeah, that's that's a little bit about me, but I don't really include it in any of my content because there's really no point

1283
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:34,020
Because it's not my niche

1284
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:41,620
Um, what viewers are reacting and joking about streamer performing ASMR various objects including chicken nuggets a bird skull and a baby

1285
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:45,860
Okay, AI

1286
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:50,420
We can sacrifice it and turn this into a pagan stream

1287
02:17:51,380 --> 02:17:53,860
No, that would be so bad

1288
02:17:56,420 --> 02:17:58,420
Um

1289
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:04,260
Are you okay, baby? My tommy horde

1290
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:07,780
Hold on

1291
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:10,020
Put this in

1292
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:12,020
Wooper straw knees crotch

1293
02:18:13,060 --> 02:18:15,060
Stay

1294
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:17,060
Perfect

1295
02:18:17,940 --> 02:18:22,660
It's like a rakey master. Uh, no, I've actually I've wanted to learn rakey

1296
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:30,180
rakey, I would love like when I was written. I actually wanted to like, um, do ASMR where I would learn how to do rakey

1297
02:18:30,180 --> 02:18:32,180
And I would do rakey healing

1298
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:35,780
Um, and energy like moving energy and stuff. So that would have been super cool

1299
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:38,180
But again, it doesn't make sense for me to do that now

1300
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:41,860
I will leave that to emmy who, um

1301
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:48,260
It's funny. Uh, I'll I'll talk a little bit about the ritual

1302
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:52,260
That uh, emmy did on the pin pals

1303
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:57,780
If you're a pin pal watching you're probably wondering why am I so obsessed with her?

1304
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:03,300
Why do I love emmy so much? I think about her every day. I ache when she's gone

1305
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:06,900
This has never happened to me before with a uh

1306
02:19:06,980 --> 02:19:13,620
With a with a vtuber. Yeah, I remember that picture she posted with like the candles and the altar and the and the

1307
02:19:14,660 --> 02:19:18,180
And you know with with her name on it. That's why

1308
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:20,980
That's why you think I'm joking

1309
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:24,260
Her intention was clear

1310
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:35,140
Her intentions were clear. Yeah, no your pin pals aren't cursed. They've been bewitched

1311
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:38,100
They've been bewitched

1312
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:41,060
Uh

1313
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:47,300
And you're like, oh, it's just for fun. It's just it's just silly stuff. It's just cute. It's just for the it's for the kid. No

1314
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:51,060
No, no, no, honey

1315
02:19:51,700 --> 02:19:55,700
It's not just for the cave wave that that was real. I felt

1316
02:19:56,340 --> 02:20:00,820
The energy from that freaking just the photo alone and I'm like, oh she got them

1317
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:03,620
I literally met a chair. I was like girl

1318
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:11,140
I can't tell if you fucked up or not because I'm scared. They're gonna be too obsessed with you to a dangerous degree

1319
02:20:13,380 --> 02:20:17,140
But yes, uh, you guys are under her spell. Enjoy it

1320
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:20,660
She treats you well

1321
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:24,260
Yeah, the pin pals know what they signed up for exactly exactly

1322
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:27,060
They got the voodoo

Easy. Why won't this sit?

1336
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:18,820
Perfect

1337
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:31,940
How come I haven't done it for harem um because that type of

1338
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:37,700
Work like that. I just leaked all over myself a type of stuff can be dangerous

1339
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:41,380
So I don't really

1340
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:43,540
Like messing with stuff

1341
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:49,780
But I have a couple of spell jars up here. I can show you guys so like I made some spell jars

Can you get those ingredients at your local walmart no

1359

I go to specific stores. Is it me teaching you some black magic? Uh, no, I already know black magic

1360
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:54,500
I already know that stuff you guys were get them Haitian

1361
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:57,540
voodoo was one of the strongest forms

1362
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:03,460
Do you have nice handwriting? I don't you guys probably wouldn't be able to read it

1363
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:09,060
All right, so no ritual needed um

1364
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:14,100
I remember I'll tell you a story

1365
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:16,100
um

1366
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:18,900
When I was uh first getting into it

1367
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:25,380
I had a crush on this person and I wanted them to love me

1368
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:31,380
And um, mind you this was like someone I met on like the internet

1369
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:38,340
Like I was like, oh my god, I want to eat at you and I did a little spell

1370
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:40,580
And um

1371
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:44,660
They became so obsessed with me

1372
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:51,700
It was on gaya online, wasn't it? No, it wasn't gaya. They became so obsessed with me. They started stalking me

1373
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:54,340
they started um

1374
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:57,300
When I wasn't answering them, they would start sending me threats

1375
02:23:57,940 --> 02:24:00,900
And then when I cut them off completely

1376
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:06,420
Um, they would come to my streams and pretend to be multiple people and they would call me slurs

1377
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:11,300
And they would like just like and they're like and then a couple like a week later

1378
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:15,060
They'd say they missed me and then they had to be like try to like it was crazy

1379
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:18,660
And then literally like probably like two years ago

1380
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:26,900
They came out of the woodwork. Uh, they found like my old um my a past life past life account when I was like

1381
02:24:26,980 --> 02:24:30,820
Still flush streaming and they're like, hey, I miss you and I'm like

1382
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:33,220
What?

1383
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:35,380
And I didn't learn my lesson because I did it again

1384
02:24:37,220 --> 02:24:39,220
I did it again

1385
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:45,300
And then um and this person was like, yeah like across the country not across the country there and like

1386
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:47,780
I think they were in like Asia somewhere in Asia

1387
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:50,500
and I'm like, oh

1388
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:53,380
I'm gonna make you love me

1389
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:58,260
And so I did it again and then they became so obsessed with me and started

1390
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:01,940
I feel like you can't see right

1391
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:04,660
I see everything through rose tinted glasses and um

1392
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:07,540
and they uh

1393
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:11,380
They were kind of weird because they're the people who made me watch a serbian film

1394
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:16,900
They're like, I want to watch this movie with you and I'm like, oh, okay. And then that was yeah, that was bad

1395
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:19,780
Do you remember rabbit like that? It's a website

1396
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:22,740
um

1397
02:25:23,220 --> 02:25:25,220
Harry's like what?

1398
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:27,140
um

1399
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:28,660
and then

1400
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:31,940
I was like after I watched a part of the film. I was like, uh

1401
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:33,460
Uh

1402
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:35,940
No, I have to leave. I'm sorry

1403
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:38,740
Like that's messed up

1404
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,300
um

1405
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:44,660
And then they kept threatening to kill themselves

1406
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:53,300
Mind you, I'm like 18 or 17. I can't remember how old I was

1407
02:25:56,660 --> 02:25:58,660
And I just like in like korea

1408
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:04,260
I

1409
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:07,860
Can't like no you can't cancel the spell

1410
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:14,820
So I don't mess with love magic

1411
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:18,740
I don't mess with love magic, man

1412
02:26:19,860 --> 02:26:21,860
Oh, yeah, these people are completely gone

1413
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:25,380
Although they no, no, no, that's a lie actually so this person

1414
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:28,820
Anonymous tipped four dollars and 20 cents

1415
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:31,780
What?

1416
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:38,260
Could it be that the pimpels are a little gay that could be the reason

1417
02:26:39,140 --> 02:26:42,580
You guys are all linked with the sexual stuff that you're all a little gay

1418
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:46,500
Um, no, so when I was rena

1419
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:51,380
This person I don't know how they found me

1420
02:26:52,820 --> 02:26:57,300
Could I never announce on my flesh streaming account who I was

1421
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:02,740
Back when I would like that was when I was a commentary person

1422
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:05,940
They were like, hey

1423
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:11,860
Um same thing. I missed you. I've been thinking about you a lot. I blocked them immediately

1424
02:27:12,820 --> 02:27:15,860
Immediately, I'm like, how did you find me? They're like, oh, it's me

1425
02:27:17,060 --> 02:27:21,620
I can't remember. They just have like a name in korean mind you like again. This is all like

1426
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:25,060
Date stuff. So it's not like it doesn't

1427
02:27:26,020 --> 02:27:33,140
It's just fucking stupid over the internet and again, I was young and stupid these things were like like a week

1428
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:35,540
Or a couple weeks

1429
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:39,300
Restraining order one of them. Um, I had to almost get a restraining order

1430
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:43,620
Because he found out where I lived and he said he was gonna kill me

1431
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:49,700
Um, if I didn't get back together with him and so I told my parents

1432
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:53,540
And this was somebody I met and like CS go

1433
02:27:55,460 --> 02:27:57,860
And we had met like for like a talk for like a month

1434
02:27:59,220 --> 02:28:01,220
Uh

1435
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:05,220
Yeah, yeah, he said he was gonna kill me. Um

1436
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:15,620
But it's in minecraft this is all takes place in minecraft by the way

1437
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:19,140
Why does this out feel fully found in the flash drive?

1438
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:24,740
Yeah, yeah, it was oh CS go player of course makes sense

1439
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:26,740
um

1440
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:31,460
Especially he did the like, you know how I said I gambled stuff like my skins

1441
02:28:31,780 --> 02:28:35,540
They're the ones that made me gamble stuff. So I lost like a couple thousand dollars in skins

1442
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:39,460
And then they had me give the money so they can get skins

1443
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:42,500
And then they lost all the money

1444
02:28:42,820 --> 02:28:46,900
And then they said they're like they wanted to kill me because the money was gone

1445
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:53,860
And then another person I'm just really people would just love to take advantage of me. Um

1446
02:28:55,140 --> 02:28:57,140
The other person

1447
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:00,580
This is

1448
02:29:00,580 --> 02:29:02,580
Did you have a dragon lore?

1449
02:29:02,580 --> 02:29:04,020
No

1450
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:06,020
I didn't have like a crazy op

1451
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:09,380
Guys i'm just too nice

1452
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:13,940
Like yeah, like I think I gave like two thousand dollars in skins to this person

1453
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:16,420
Like I wasn't the discord kitten. They were

1454
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:19,780
And this is when I was like again like 17

1455

1456
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:25,460
Wait, I think they were like 23

02:29:27,940 --> 02:29:32,660
Uh, was I groomed? Oh, should I end the stream now?

1458
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:34,660
I'm so talking

1459
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:54,420
The new lore actually we was grooving into buying stuff for people on cs go

1460
02:29:57,380 --> 02:29:59,380
Oh no

1461
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:05,380

1463
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:26,340

Looks like they're hungry better feed them. Here's a bowl of cereal for your troubles

1467
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:52,660
I need to talk to my therapist ASAP

1468
02:30:52,900 --> 02:31:04,740
Because I was thinking I'm like wait, how old was I and I was like wait, how old were they? I'm like

1469
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:09,140

02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:22,740
You guys know there's there's a lot of stuff about saying out loud that I'm like realizing how bad

1472
02:31:25,220 --> 02:31:27,220
When you turn 18

1473
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:35,460
Oh my god

1474
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:41,700
It gets worse

1475
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:46,820
Hindsight is 2020 bro

1476
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:53,300
I've been through a lot. I don't talk about it. You get you get a little you get a little piece of lore there

1477
02:31:55,940 --> 02:32:00,180
I didn't learn my lesson because it happened again with a another csgo person

1478
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:02,980
But that was just like friendship

1479
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:05,380
I wasn't like

1480
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:07,460
They weren't trying to like to eat then they were like

1481
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:10,260
26

1482
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:12,580
And I

1483
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:16,340
And I definitely and remember they like were like hey

1484
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:20,420
Can you get me some money for skins and then mind you like I had a job and I'm just nice

1485
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:23,780
So I was like, oh, yeah, sure. If you've got anything like show me blah, blah, blah

1486
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:28,740
They pulled like they they didn't know they pulled like some like a dumb stuff

1487
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:33,780
And then they went and they bet it all I like roubet

1488
02:32:34,900 --> 02:32:36,900
And then they lost it all

1489
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:45,380
She be why because I'm nice and I get taken advantage of okay

1490
02:32:52,100 --> 02:32:54,340
It's like 10 times funnier because my my models is like

1491
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:58,580
You know this explains a lot she be

1492
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:05,620
You're the woman in the horror movie that buys a haunted house because you like to crowd molding

1493
02:33:05,860 --> 02:33:07,860
Don't check the ai summary. Hold on

1494
02:33:14,020 --> 02:33:16,260
Viewers are discussing how wild the current streams become

1495
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:18,260
They're joking about the streamers digging deep with their lower reveal

1496
02:33:18,260 --> 02:33:22,340
They're making comments how the lord is taking unspectators. How does going in dark in an unexpected direction?

1497
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:27,380
She be connected like 20 literally

1498
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:31,060
Oh my god

1499
02:33:32,020 --> 02:33:38,180
Guys we're not like I was very I'm sorry. I'm a very giving no I need to book a therapy appointment

1500
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:41,540
I haven't seen my therapist since I went on my trip and I definitely need to see her

1501
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:45,140
Because of what's been going on with fia. I need to talk about that. Um

1502
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:53,700
But yeah, no, I again, I've always been keep my car. I've always won. I'm a hard worker

1503
02:33:54,020 --> 02:33:59,300
So I would make good money. Um when I was younger. I was I started working when I was 15. Um

1504
02:34:00,260 --> 02:34:03,460
for us at working for my dad and um

1505
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:15,540
And I was just not like I'm an only child. I worked really hard. I wanted people to like me so I

1506
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:20,420
Gave people my money. I remember when I was like like 12

1507
02:34:20,660 --> 02:34:27,300
I gave a girl five dollars and my mom later explained to me that that girl had bullied me out of five dollars

1508
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:33,700
When I when we were going on like a field trip and that was the only five dollars I had and I just wanted her to like me

1509
02:34:34,580 --> 02:34:40,180
People say Valorant is bad today. Oh, no CS go was trash bro Valorant doesn't have anything on CS go

1510
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:45,460
Um, yeah, I got taken advantage of a lot

1511
02:34:53,220 --> 02:34:55,220
I'm so sorry

1512
02:34:55,460 --> 02:34:57,460
I just brought that down

1513
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:59,380
um

1514
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:03,620
But I think maybe that's why I the dom is

1515
02:35:04,580 --> 02:35:08,740
Hard for me because I'm very nice and I just want to give and love and all this stuff

1516
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:16,180
But it's also teaching me to stand up for myself. I think I think being a dom is teaching me to stand up for myself

1517
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:19,780
I'm so sorry this happened to you may have a ps5. Uh

1518
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:23,540
Don't even get me started

1519
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:26,980
I'm buying it for you instantly. Um

1520
02:35:29,380 --> 02:35:33,060
I need to apologize is you I'm sorry

1521
02:35:37,220 --> 02:35:43,060
Yeah, it makes you guys happy but it's it's interesting to me because I think because I've always been kind of pushed around

1522
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:47,300
My mom always said she was sad because I was a follower and I was never a leader

1523
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:49,780
um

1524
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:52,340
This is so sad I can't get to kick like this guys

1525
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:59,540
Um that and but ever since I worked for my last job, I think I've gotten better at kind of standing up for myself

1526
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:02,180
um

1527
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:07,540
And but yeah, I know I got I got bullied a lot when I was a kid. Uh, I was pushed around a lot

1528
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:11,780
Um, that's a crazy statement, but she meant that in the sweetest way like she wanted me

1529
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:13,860
She knew that I could be a great leader

1530
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:17,380
Um, but I was too sweet like I couldn't say no to stuff

1531
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:24,900
Hey, she be a new place today, but like I'm like that like I've had I've had like one of my um co-workers. Um

1532
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:28,900
She had broken up with like her super abusive

1533
02:36:29,700 --> 02:36:31,140
Uh

1534
02:36:31,140 --> 02:36:33,140
Boyfriend and I was just like if you stay with me

1535
02:36:34,580 --> 02:36:38,020
Bro come crash like you can come stay with me. Um

1536
02:36:39,220 --> 02:36:41,940
Because that's just how I am I don't like we weren't even close

1537
02:36:42,100 --> 02:36:44,580
But like I'm very protective of people that I work with

1538
02:36:45,140 --> 02:36:49,460
And people and especially like women because I think maybe I see myself in them

1539
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:52,740
God

1540
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:55,060
I'm trying not to cry bro. What's wrong with me?

1541
02:36:57,220 --> 02:36:59,220
Oh my god

1542
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:06,180
Oh, literally I was on the phone with my dad the other day

1543
02:37:06,980 --> 02:37:14,660
And he was scolding me because he's like when are you gonna start doing stuff for yourself?

1544
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:21,540
Because I've always been doing stuff for other people

1545
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:27,220
I know

1546
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:31,380
And because he's like I need you because I hadn't like gone outside

1547
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:33,700
I hadn't done anything I've kind of just been in my house and yes

1548
02:37:33,700 --> 02:37:35,220
I've been streaming and yes, that's for me

1549
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:40,180
But my dad's like you need to take care of yourself because you always take care of the people around you

1550
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:55,780
She'd be so soft because all the way around she's trying to dump now. Yeah

1551
02:38:00,100 --> 02:38:02,100
Thank you

1552
02:38:04,420 --> 02:38:13,620
Damn I wanted a dom why is she such a little bitch if you're gonna call me a bitch you better put

1553
02:38:18,740 --> 02:38:22,260
Oh, just find someone who take care will take care of you

1554
02:38:22,980 --> 02:38:26,420
As much as you take care of them. I've already found them. It's you guys

1555
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:31,540
You guys guys why is my dom crying?

1556
02:38:33,940 --> 02:38:36,900
Do you guys still love me even though I have lots of trauma?

1557
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:41,060
Laughs through the tears

1558
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:48,980
Yes, I have my cats I have you and I have the voices in my head and my sock puppet friends

1559
02:38:51,700 --> 02:38:53,700
Shit

1560
02:38:53,940 --> 02:38:56,820
Damn that emotional cooch is fire facts, bro

1561
02:38:57,060 --> 02:39:02,180
You know the crazy bitches the emotional bitches the traumatized bitches always got the tightest pussy, bro

1562
02:39:02,980 --> 02:39:08,500
I mean, but to see this is probably gonna get limited. It's fine. I don't really make any money from youtube videos

1563
02:39:14,580 --> 02:39:18,180
I hope she never has to experience a dom drop. What does that mean?

1564
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:26,100
Grippiest the grippy bipiest, you know it. How's the baby?

They fine

1567
02:39:40,180 --> 02:39:46,580
Oh, yeah, we got a kid is that why strongy says she's only hiring girls that have a screw loose, uh

1568
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:53,380
I think strongy said she hired me because she literally saw me

1569
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:58,260
She's like this is me

1570
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:00,260
in a different form

1571
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:05,140
She's like you remind me so much of myself. Oh, thank you

1572
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:09,620
Thank you monkey. We still love you even if I was a worm

1573
02:40:14,740 --> 02:40:16,740
Oh, thank you

1574

1576
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:31,780
Or the hoodie for me. Oh, no. Oh, thank you. I'll I'll take a picture of myself on it

1578
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:41,860

No

1580
02:40:44,340 --> 02:40:47,300

Guys, it's the camera

1642
03:09:00,820 --> 03:09:07,300
I turned back on the color correction. See I'm brown. I am so brown

The browniest brown

1646
03:09:14,900 --> 03:09:16,900
Well, I'm over inch

1647
03:09:18,980 --> 03:09:20,980
What is this? Whoa

03:09:25,540 --> 03:09:27,540
Whoa

03:09:52,740 --> 03:09:54,740
Turn up

03:09:55,940 --> 03:09:58,260
Turn down the saturation a tad

Turn down the saturation a lot. I'm just going to be a

1658
03:10:08,980 --> 03:10:13,300
This is probably the most accurate but it still looks weird

1659
03:10:20,900 --> 03:10:27,060
And I have the brightest light on too if I turn off the light it would be so dark

1660

And everything is blue for him and himself and everybody around because he ain't but nobody to listen

I like to squeeze this

1729
03:18:24,660 --> 03:18:26,660
It's a little stressful

1730
03:18:31,460 --> 03:18:33,220
Raina and fia don't scratch

1731
03:18:33,220 --> 03:18:38,340
Uh, if raina like slips when like walking on me, she might but like when boomi plays

1732
03:18:38,340 --> 03:18:40,500
He'll help sometimes play with his claws out

1733
03:18:40,580 --> 03:18:45,700
So I have to scold him and tell him to use his soft paws and then he'll he'll he'll start using his soft paws

1734
03:18:46,260 --> 03:18:48,260
Boomi understands me

1735
03:18:49,780 --> 03:18:51,780
Whip the child

03:18:56,980 --> 03:18:58,980
Pusheen is gonna play

1737
03:19:00,660 --> 03:19:02,660
Pusheen looks very intent

1738
03:19:11,140 --> 03:19:13,700
Like how fondly pusheen is looking at the child

1739
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:24,740
You're a whore

1740
03:19:29,060 --> 03:19:31,060
No footage of it

1741

I'm not gonna be like boomi come scratch me

1742
03:19:35,060 --> 03:19:39,700

1749
03:20:20,500 --> 03:20:30,820
You know what all we wait for that kid to do some stupid stuff

03:20:36,980 --> 03:20:38,980

1751
03:20:39,380 --> 03:20:41,380
Oh

1752
03:20:49,620 --> 03:20:51,620
I rolled over multiple toes actually

1753
03:21:02,900 --> 03:21:04,900
That's not what I wanted

1754
03:21:08,980 --> 03:21:10,980
I

1755
03:21:30,500 --> 03:21:32,900
I'm shibbing and I'm shibbing on my toes

1756
03:21:38,980 --> 03:21:40,980
I

1757
03:21:46,340 --> 03:21:50,980
Let's do some tarot because I'm bored. I haven't done tarot in a bit

1758
03:21:54,660 --> 03:21:56,660
Like a freaking shuffle

1759
03:21:59,300 --> 03:22:01,300
Read boomi's tarot no

1760
03:22:03,700 --> 03:22:05,700
I'll read your tarot

1761
03:22:08,980 --> 03:22:10,980
I

1762
03:22:18,180 --> 03:22:20,180
Predict our child's future

1763
03:22:24,980 --> 03:22:28,340
There's a lot of mother flipping persona reference

1764
03:22:33,940 --> 03:22:35,940
Oh jesus christmas

1765
03:22:39,780 --> 03:22:50,020
This isn't weed it's palo santo

1766
03:23:00,500 --> 03:23:02,980
Read it for the child the child isn't real

1767
03:23:05,060 --> 03:23:07,060
Probably gonna say it's gonna die I've

1768
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:09,780
Sit on my hand

1769
03:23:11,380 --> 03:23:13,860
You never seen a tarot reading done outside of cyberpunk

1770
03:23:16,020 --> 03:23:18,020
The child is real to me

1771
03:23:23,140 --> 03:23:26,020
He is real to me like that one kid on that bunch

1772
03:23:27,540 --> 03:23:32,340
They're like she is beautiful to me or whatever he says. All right. Who wants a reading?

1773
03:23:32,340 --> 03:23:36,580
I was bummed. I didn't get to do this with dempo

1774
03:23:40,660 --> 03:23:48,260
If you want a reading tell me your question and your star sign

1775
03:23:54,180 --> 03:23:57,620
And give me a thousand dollars. No, can I get off the paper that?

1776
03:23:58,580 --> 03:24:02,920
What our tarot cards, how do they work? Um, I always put it like this

1777
03:24:04,660 --> 03:24:08,980
Uh, you don't have to believe in this shit. That's fine. That's your your title to your opinion

1778
03:24:08,980 --> 03:24:12,900
You think you can think it's dumb as fuck. Uh, you can be like, oh spirits don't exist

1779
03:24:12,900 --> 03:24:19,780
You can think oh ghosts don't exist. You can think the demon whatever doesn't matter. Uh, these are good even if you don't

1780
03:24:21,140 --> 03:24:26,260
Believe in them because they're good at reflection like like you can use them as almost like a therapy tool

1781
03:24:26,260 --> 03:24:33,220
So like for example, I'm like, man, I wish I could, you know, work on my career more and then this says

1782
03:24:34,660 --> 03:24:43,060
Collaboration teamwork skills shared goals. Oh, maybe I should start working on how to collaborate better. Um, or the devil. I'm like, oh

1783
03:24:44,180 --> 03:24:51,060
Toxic energies of shut sessions attachments. Oh, maybe I should work on, you know, cutting people a lot off

1784
03:24:51,380 --> 03:24:57,220
They don't do anything for me. So you don't have to like be like, oh the spirits are telling me. Oh my god

1785
03:24:57,220 --> 03:25:05,380
You can just be like, um, this is I'm just using this as a tool for like self-reflection. You don't have to believe in it. Um,

1786
03:25:06,180 --> 03:25:08,180
yeah

1787
03:25:08,660 --> 03:25:13,860
But tarot cards are a divination tool. I also have, uh

1788
03:25:14,980 --> 03:25:16,980
What's it called?

1789
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:20,180
Oh my god, I forgot what it's called

1790
03:25:21,060 --> 03:25:23,060
I have other stuff too

1791
03:25:26,100 --> 03:25:29,860
Well, the child live I'm a cancer. Yeah to society

1792
03:25:34,180 --> 03:25:36,660
Will I make it? What are you dying?

1793
03:25:39,860 --> 03:25:42,580
Pisces should I get another job? Okay, I'll do you first

1794
03:25:45,380 --> 03:25:49,780
Connecting with the no, I'm not gonna be uh, I'm not gonna be

1795
03:25:50,340 --> 03:25:53,460
sarcastic when I ask for guidance

1796
03:25:54,500 --> 03:25:58,740
Connecting with the spiritual team of yeah, what do you have to say?

1797
03:26:00,900 --> 03:26:02,900
About this

1798
03:26:04,740 --> 03:26:10,180
I can't even shuffle properly the cards are jumping out. So normally I usually pick three because I like reading that much

1799
03:26:10,740 --> 03:26:12,740
Um, I feel like these

1800
03:26:12,740 --> 03:26:14,740
So you're correct

1801
03:26:18,420 --> 03:26:20,420
Oh, okay

1802
03:26:21,140 --> 03:26:23,700
All right queen go off

1803
03:26:25,300 --> 03:26:27,300
Hold on

1804
03:26:28,420 --> 03:26:30,980
How will my career go? All right

1805
03:26:31,620 --> 03:26:34,260
So you have a three of cups upright

1806
03:26:34,980 --> 03:26:41,140
You have strength upright and you have king of swords upright. So

1807
03:26:41,940 --> 03:26:43,940
These are very positive

1808
03:26:44,740 --> 03:26:46,740
so

1809
03:26:46,900 --> 03:26:51,700
Cancer slender and if you guys like lie about your star signs, no, I just say that for you

1810
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:55,860
So you guys are paying attention. That's what I asked to be like if you're paying attention, then you'll say what I asked

1811
03:26:56,340 --> 03:26:57,540
Um, so three of cups

1812
03:26:57,540 --> 03:27:00,260
So I like to use these because they're more easy for people to follow

1813
03:27:00,820 --> 03:27:03,300
Um, but you can uh, because they have like information on the top

1814
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:07,940
Um, but these three you can see these lovely ladies having a great time

1815
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:13,860
Dancing they're naked. They're they're hot. They're just living it up. Um, this represents, uh

1816
03:27:14,660 --> 03:27:17,380
celebrations friendship collaborations community

1817
03:27:18,020 --> 03:27:20,020
A circle of support social events

1818
03:27:20,660 --> 03:27:22,820
Creativity and your place of shared joy

1819
03:27:23,300 --> 03:27:27,060
I feel like something tells me that you're not super like a huge fan of your job yet

1820
03:27:27,300 --> 03:27:30,420
But it will get better because you know what it makes things better friends

1821
03:27:30,660 --> 03:27:35,140
So I think you'll gain some friends and you'll be able to collaborate with some people and do some really really creative stuff

1822
03:27:35,620 --> 03:27:36,740
um

1823
03:27:36,740 --> 03:27:40,500
But in order to do this in order to make these friends you need to work on your self-love

1824
03:27:40,980 --> 03:27:44,900
And I can't and uh, it says yeah self-respect, respect, courage, inner strength

1825
03:27:45,060 --> 03:27:48,660
I feel like you doubt yourself a lot. You think you're not good enough. Um, but you are good enough

1826
03:27:48,740 --> 03:27:50,740
You have the strength to do so you just have I've

1827
03:27:51,300 --> 03:27:56,340
Something draws me you see this infinity usually stands for enlightenment and this stands for instinct

1828
03:27:56,820 --> 03:28:02,980
So it's like this woman is taming. She is the wherewithal to tame her instincts her negative opinions and her negative emotions

1829
03:28:03,300 --> 03:28:05,460
So I feel like you need to work on that a little bit more

1830
03:28:06,020 --> 03:28:09,860
Um, yeah inner stillness. I feel like you're kind of fighting a war within yourself

1831
03:28:10,740 --> 03:28:12,740
Oh my god, that's true queen

1832
03:28:12,980 --> 03:28:20,740
King of swords. I love the king. This is you this represents you. I already know. Um, so when you attain these things you will

1833
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:25,300
Be the pinnacle of someone who is action

1834
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:26,660
um

1835
03:28:26,660 --> 03:28:30,500
mental clarity intellectual power truth authority reason discipline

1836
03:28:30,980 --> 03:28:34,500
I feel like these are things that you value. Um, and then once you you know

1837
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:43,220
Practice some self-love kind of get um learn some stuff about yourself do some self-reflection make some friends gain that confidence

1838
03:28:43,380 --> 03:28:44,980
You'll realize

1839
03:28:44,980 --> 03:28:47,300
These are these wonderful skills that you have

1840
03:28:48,020 --> 03:28:50,020
um

1841
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:53,380
Yeah head over heart integrity very very thoughtful person

1842
03:28:54,580 --> 03:28:57,300
There you go. There you have it. That'd be a million dollars

1843
03:28:58,500 --> 03:29:00,900
Again, you don't have to believe in this stuff. That's totally fine

1844
03:29:03,060 --> 03:29:05,060
They become Chad

1845
03:29:06,100 --> 03:29:08,100
All right, who's next?

1846
03:29:29,060 --> 03:29:32,820
I don't need to pull cards to answer that question your business will uh

1847
03:29:33,540 --> 03:29:37,060
Fail or succeed and that is up to you and your mentality and your mindset

1848
03:29:37,140 --> 03:29:40,340
If you think it's gonna fail if you already started working on it and you're like this is gonna fail

1849
03:29:40,420 --> 03:29:44,260
And it's gonna fail if you work really hard and you put your mind to it then it will thrive

1850
03:29:46,260 --> 03:29:51,140
I'm a scorpio should I start v-tubing you're a male. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding

1851
03:29:52,100 --> 03:29:54,100
I'm kidding. Um

1852
03:29:59,060 --> 03:30:01,220
Can you riffle no I can't shuffle at all

1853
03:30:02,980 --> 03:30:04,980
I

1854
03:30:08,020 --> 03:30:13,540
Am changing am I changing for the better torus. All right, that's a very good question. Um

1855
03:30:15,300 --> 03:30:18,580
Spirits, please connect me with the spiritual team of tap potential

1856
03:30:21,620 --> 03:30:27,540
What wisdom do you have to impart what should they be working on should they be scared of this change should they embrace this change

1857
03:30:29,140 --> 03:30:30,820
I can't

1858
03:30:31,460 --> 03:30:33,460
It's hard to shuffle at this angle

1859
03:30:47,220 --> 03:30:51,780
So you're definitely right in terms of so you got the ace of cups

1860
03:30:52,740 --> 03:30:54,740
You uh upright

1861
03:30:54,740 --> 03:30:59,380
Ace of cups upright you got the page of swords in reverse

1862
03:31:00,100 --> 03:31:02,420
And you have the knight of wands upright

1863
03:31:04,500 --> 03:31:05,700
So

1864
03:31:05,700 --> 03:31:07,700
The camera is leaning for some reason

1865
03:31:08,500 --> 03:31:11,620
Ace of cups so ace in the deck ace one

1866
03:31:11,940 --> 03:31:17,460
Uh means a beginning and you're already recognizing. Um that you are changing and that self-awareness is good

1867
03:31:18,100 --> 03:31:23,380
Um, so what's interesting is that the cups usually represents your emotional state

1868
03:31:24,100 --> 03:31:28,260
Water is seen as a source of emotion. Um, usually a lot of uh

1869
03:31:29,140 --> 03:31:32,100
Water signs are more emotional more into in their emotions

1870
03:31:33,460 --> 03:31:35,460
um, so this

1871
03:31:35,460 --> 03:31:37,460
um

1872
03:31:37,460 --> 03:31:38,980
You're having

1873
03:31:38,980 --> 03:31:40,980
a sort of

1874
03:31:41,540 --> 03:31:48,500
Emotional awakening and I really want you to tap into that. I really want you to feel your emotions

1875
03:31:48,500 --> 03:31:54,660
I feel like you haven't been allowing yourself to feel your emotions feel them explore them find out what they mean to you

1876
03:31:56,820 --> 03:31:58,820
Uh page of swords, um

1877
03:31:59,220 --> 03:32:01,780
Things I feel like these are this is something I could get in the way

1878
03:32:02,340 --> 03:32:09,460
Because it says talk no action gossip insulting scatterbrains cynical sarcastic lack of planning. These are traits you want to avoid

1879
03:32:10,500 --> 03:32:14,340
Um people can turn yourself against you you might go to someone

1880
03:32:15,220 --> 03:32:19,860
And you're like, hey, this is how i'm feeling and they might say something negative about it. Don't listen to those people

1881
03:32:20,820 --> 03:32:24,580
You know your gut best go with your gut. Um

1882
03:32:25,380 --> 03:32:31,460
If you you are the one that that knows your emotions the most sometimes people might not understand where you're coming from

1883
03:32:31,460 --> 03:32:33,460
So please don't let them uh

1884
03:32:34,020 --> 03:32:36,420
Kind of prevent you from taking action

1885
03:32:37,060 --> 03:32:42,500
Uh positively in your life because they're like, oh, that's weird or oh that's not important right now or oh

1886
03:32:42,740 --> 03:32:44,740
But you know what's best for you

1887
03:32:46,100 --> 03:32:47,220
Um

1888
03:32:47,220 --> 03:32:49,220
And then when you kind of tap

1889
03:32:49,860 --> 03:32:56,340
Into this, you know new emotional side these deep feelings you you're realizing about yourself

1890
03:32:56,980 --> 03:33:03,060
Um, these are some traits that you could have so the uh night of wands is um

1891
03:33:04,580 --> 03:33:07,220
Courageous energetic charming passionate adventure

1892
03:33:07,700 --> 03:33:15,780
Venturous free-spirited hero. However, they can be impulsive rebellious hot-tempered, but they can have a good drive. So, um

1893
03:33:17,860 --> 03:33:23,380
You can kind of see here that the night is looking forward ahead

1894
03:33:24,820 --> 03:33:29,460
And I feel like you should kind of just have your eyes on the future and that will motivate you. Um

1895
03:33:30,340 --> 03:33:31,940
Have a good one. Bye

1896
03:33:31,940 --> 03:33:33,780
and uh

1897
03:33:33,780 --> 03:33:38,900
But be wary of being impulsive like emotions can run rampant and they can kind of

1898
03:33:40,260 --> 03:33:45,380
Triumph over reason so you do have to be wary of that but allow yourself to change

1899
03:33:46,820 --> 03:33:50,100
But just make sure you go into the right direction and do it in a healthy way

1900
03:33:52,500 --> 03:33:54,500
That's it that is all

1901
03:34:04,340 --> 03:34:06,340
That'll be good questions

1902
03:34:06,980 --> 03:34:11,620
I don't want to ask something out of all you asked if you wanted to be a vtuber. That's not a bad question

1903
03:34:14,260 --> 03:34:19,700
Should I keep traveling to keep friendships alive? Are you the only one traveling because if you're the only one traveling

1904
03:34:19,780 --> 03:34:23,860
Then it just seems like your friends are using you. Wait, there's a card flipped over in this deck

1905
03:34:25,620 --> 03:34:27,620
Page of pentacles interesting

1906
03:34:33,780 --> 03:34:35,780
Yeah

1907
03:34:39,860 --> 03:34:41,860
Yeah, well, there's city folk, um

1908
03:34:42,580 --> 03:34:45,620
That's great. Are they gonna try to get to you more of my

1909
03:34:46,660 --> 03:34:48,660
accidentally flip my cards the wrong way

1910
03:34:49,060 --> 03:34:51,380
Why are my cards so pretty? I love my cards

1911
03:34:51,380 --> 03:35:06,660
What does it mean um manifestation I was uh page of pentacles. There's manifesting monetary things

1912
03:35:07,060 --> 03:35:09,060
I don't know if that's applicable to anyone

1913
03:35:09,380 --> 03:35:12,820
Kind of just like was like that but that I just because it's because I noticed on my card here

1914
03:35:13,460 --> 03:35:15,460
So

1915
03:35:20,980 --> 03:35:27,700
How are things generally looking for the month rabbit lady of the forest in parts upon us your wisdom

1916
03:35:32,500 --> 03:35:39,540
Yeah, let's get a general reading for the month for everybody just things. Yes, they're very nice artwork. Look at that. I love them so much

1917
03:35:40,020 --> 03:35:42,020
Um

1918
03:35:43,300 --> 03:35:46,340
Get a general reading for everyone. Well, boomie win his case

1919
03:35:47,140 --> 03:35:49,460
Shibidi of the toilet. What is your wisdom?

1920
03:35:51,700 --> 03:35:54,580
I can't do it's hard to do a bridge with these cards because they're super stiff

1921
03:35:59,140 --> 03:36:04,420
All right, what's a general reading for everyone that they can focus on this month of august including myself

1922
03:36:05,140 --> 03:36:09,940
That's something that we should all be kind of focusing on meditating on

1923
03:36:14,980 --> 03:36:16,980
Hello

1924
03:36:19,540 --> 03:36:25,140
Little boomie get a juicy settlement in court. How do we better help be a lure keep doing what you're doing

1925
03:36:25,460 --> 03:36:27,460
So

1926
03:36:34,260 --> 03:36:37,060
Interesting interesting interesting very very interesting

1927
03:36:39,140 --> 03:36:43,060
There's a general reading for the month for everyone including myself

1928
03:36:45,140 --> 03:36:47,140
Don't take the lactate

1929
03:36:49,220 --> 03:36:52,420
So we have ace of wands in reverse

1930
03:36:53,380 --> 03:36:56,260
We have temperance upright

1931
03:36:57,460 --> 03:37:00,500
I've actually never pulled this card because I don't recognize it

1932
03:37:01,140 --> 03:37:06,340
I don't think I ever pulled that card for myself. I don't know and then six of cups upright

1933
03:37:08,740 --> 03:37:10,740
Let me just read this

1934
03:37:16,260 --> 03:37:21,700
So this um in reverse so reversal sometimes can mean something negative sometimes something positive

1935
03:37:22,260 --> 03:37:23,540
um

1936
03:37:23,540 --> 03:37:28,180
So this means rejection false start delays blocks lack of direction passion

1937
03:37:28,900 --> 03:37:34,660
Distractions lack of energy hesitancy and creative blocks. So it seems like um the month of august

1938
03:37:34,660 --> 03:37:38,900
Some of us may not be able to kind of connect creatively with ourselves

1939
03:37:39,380 --> 03:37:43,220
Um, we might get delays in our work projects like if you're like I started this project

1940
03:37:43,220 --> 03:37:47,700
Why is it taking so long and I think this is applicable to that person who asked about their paper

1941
03:37:48,660 --> 03:37:54,420
You might get delayed. So I feel like you do an ASAP so you can avoid delays. Um, so yeah, it just seems like

1942
03:37:55,460 --> 03:37:58,980
There's we're all kind of I feel like a lot of people have burnt out

1943
03:38:00,100 --> 03:38:05,300
There's a lack of direction. We need to do something to get our our creativity back. Um

1944
03:38:06,740 --> 03:38:08,740
So, uh

1945
03:38:09,220 --> 03:38:15,460
Yeah, a false start delays are like something might pop up and you're just like, oh what the frick I've been working on this

1946
03:38:16,020 --> 03:38:18,020
Yeah

1947
03:38:18,180 --> 03:38:22,740
Something might pop up just right or you might be working on something and something keeps coming up and coming up and coming up

1948
03:38:22,900 --> 03:38:25,380
So maybe it's not the time to start new things

1949
03:38:25,780 --> 03:38:31,140
Just try to finish what you already got or just try to work on things that make you happy so you can get their creativity back

1950
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:39,060
And I think this is definitely applicable temperance is a beautiful card by the way. Oh my god, um temperance

1951
03:38:39,460 --> 03:38:45,300
Represents balance harmony healing patients. I feel like we need patients to deal with, you know, what's going on there?

1952
03:38:45,780 --> 03:38:49,860
um self-control moderation purpose peace calm tranquility and

1953
03:38:50,580 --> 03:38:54,500
Serenity, so I think we need to forgive ourselves a little bit. It could see um

1954
03:38:55,460 --> 03:39:01,620
She's pouring the cup into another. Um, maybe almost this is kind of reminiscent of um

1955
03:39:02,180 --> 03:39:05,220
Almost like an outpouring of emotions from one person to another

1956
03:39:05,300 --> 03:39:09,380
Maybe just that balance that balance can be achieved if we kind of vent to somebody

1957
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:14,020
Or like if you have someone that's like a close companion, you can kind of tell them what's going on

1958
03:39:14,020 --> 03:39:17,540
And maybe they can give you new ideas. You also see there's a little crown right there

1959
03:39:18,180 --> 03:39:23,140
So I feel like that crown um, maybe someone who's like a masculine person in your life

1960
03:39:23,540 --> 03:39:25,540
um, you can kind of open up to them

1961
03:39:26,340 --> 03:39:30,500
Or just like just have to be a masculine person like a like a male. It could be just like a

1962
03:39:30,980 --> 03:39:35,540
Maybe like a more masculine female like or someone just in touch with their divine

1963
03:39:35,940 --> 03:39:38,660
masculine energy, which is you can look up what that is

1964
03:39:39,140 --> 03:39:43,220
I can't remember what's all in my head. Um, but yeah, maybe some time to do some healing

1965
03:39:43,220 --> 03:39:46,500
Maybe not to do some creative stuff. Maybe time to do some like self work

1966
03:39:47,060 --> 03:39:50,260
Some healing stuff on yourself. Maybe you've not been feeling well

1967
03:39:50,340 --> 03:39:54,260
Maybe you need to attain that balance and the harmony within your body before you can work on stuff here

1968
03:39:55,780 --> 03:39:57,780
your little tombore

1969
03:39:57,780 --> 03:39:59,780
Um

1970
03:39:59,780 --> 03:40:01,780
It's there. Oh

1971
03:40:01,780 --> 03:40:06,900
Should I make cheesecake tonight even though it's a bitch? Yes, because you'll be so happy you did afterwards

1972
03:40:07,460 --> 03:40:09,460
um

1973
03:40:10,340 --> 03:40:13,940
And I think a way for us to help tap into our creative side

1974
03:40:14,580 --> 03:40:21,060
Um, or someone that you can reach out to because it says nostalgia childhood the past memories

1975
03:40:21,540 --> 03:40:23,540
Familiarity innocence reunion

1976
03:40:23,620 --> 03:40:27,940
Maybe someone from your past will pop up and you can talk to them and be like, hey, this is what I've been up to

1977
03:40:28,180 --> 03:40:31,620
They've been like, oh, this is what I've been up to and you're like dang. That's really cool. That inspires me

1978
03:40:32,020 --> 03:40:36,980
Um, or maybe you can go check out some stuff that like nostalgic from your childhood that just brought you a lot of joy

1979
03:40:37,220 --> 03:40:42,900
Like maybe you want to play that one game you haven't played or touched in years and you remember you wanted to beat it

1980
03:40:43,140 --> 03:40:45,140
And so maybe you want to do that

1981
03:40:46,020 --> 03:40:50,100
Yeah, then that may will bring you some comfort some sentimentality will be really good

1982
03:40:50,980 --> 03:40:54,900
Um, but yeah some wholesome wholesome nostalgia is an order folks

1983
03:40:58,500 --> 03:41:00,500
Cheesecake pog see the people have spoken

1984
03:41:01,220 --> 03:41:03,220
Yeah, I think uh

1985
03:41:03,220 --> 03:41:07,860
I kind of been experiencing that myself already just like creative delays and stuff. So I totally I totally get that

1986
03:41:08,900 --> 03:41:10,900
Put it all in black, of course

1987
03:41:11,860 --> 03:41:13,860
You

1988
03:41:18,100 --> 03:41:24,820
Are out of the game there. I'm so sorry. Yeah, maybe sometimes you need to face your face past trauma like I just did

1989
03:41:28,580 --> 03:41:30,980
Should I ask her she's still with Peter?

1990
03:41:31,780 --> 03:41:42,100
Yeah, wait it happened

1991
03:41:44,260 --> 03:41:49,380
I can't I can't do the face because my my physics are low because I had to turn up turn my physics down

1992
03:41:49,540 --> 03:42:06,580
We build ourselves together don't you worry she should go up here. Do you have a chance with the person you're interested in?

1993
03:42:08,740 --> 03:42:15,380
I feel like this I'm gonna pull one card for that because I feel like you already know the answer to this and you're just looking for validation

1994
03:42:15,780 --> 03:42:19,620
And I'll give you that validation

1995
03:42:24,020 --> 03:42:25,380
The card you're taking forever to come out

1996
03:42:25,380 --> 03:42:28,420
So it seems like you already know the answer because they don't want to say nothing

1997
03:42:28,820 --> 03:42:31,860
A card just flew across the room. Hold on

1998
03:42:39,780 --> 03:42:43,620
Oh, so it's positive kind of pentacles

1999
03:42:45,380 --> 03:42:48,980
If you wish it it can happen. So you gotta believe in yourself, bro

2000
03:42:49,940 --> 03:42:51,940
Believe in yourself believe it

2001
03:42:57,140 --> 03:42:59,140
Pull yourself out there

2002
03:43:00,980 --> 03:43:03,220
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna start pulling one cards for people

2003
03:43:05,620 --> 03:43:07,620
Hello, hello

2004
03:43:08,340 --> 03:43:11,540
Guys, I'm not gonna give you financial advice

2005
03:43:12,900 --> 03:43:14,580
I'm not gonna be like

2006
03:43:14,580 --> 03:43:20,500
Yes, buy a house buy a car. I'm not gonna tell you about a pregnancy. I'm not gonna tell you about somebody who's died

2007
03:43:22,740 --> 03:43:24,740
Yesterday you said today just do it exactly

2008
03:43:30,420 --> 03:43:33,700
Will I be a better person in the future that's up to you. What do you mean?

2009
03:43:34,260 --> 03:43:36,260
You can change start changing yourself now

2010
03:43:37,060 --> 03:43:40,020
If you think you're not a good person now, that means something is up, bro

2011
03:43:40,980 --> 03:43:42,980
I don't need cards to tell you that

2012
03:43:44,420 --> 03:43:48,820
Or you're not giving yourself enough grace should I bet on the Mets? Yes

2013
03:43:53,060 --> 03:43:54,980
Should I sell all I own and move to the woods? Yes

2014
03:43:56,340 --> 03:43:58,740
Should I start heading down a new path in my life?

2015
03:43:59,940 --> 03:44:02,820
I feel like you think you're stagnant and if you're stagnant you should move

2016
03:44:03,780 --> 03:44:08,740
There I one of my favorite tropes within Elden Ring is

2017
03:44:10,020 --> 03:44:11,700
Um

2018
03:44:11,700 --> 03:44:13,860
There's a theme of stagnant water

2019
03:44:14,660 --> 03:44:17,860
Stagnant water does not have life or energy in it

2020
03:44:18,500 --> 03:44:22,180
And you want and moving water is full of life

2021
03:44:22,980 --> 03:44:24,980
That's a common theme within Elden Ring

2022
03:44:26,100 --> 03:44:30,820
Uh, I don't know people notice that and I the Mets, baby

2023
03:44:31,220 --> 03:44:33,540
And uh, I reckon I I recommend

2024
03:44:35,140 --> 03:44:37,860
You do something about it if you're stagnant you need to move

2025
03:44:38,500 --> 03:44:43,460
Not like move physically, but like like to a new house. I mean like you need to start doing stuff

2026
03:44:45,300 --> 03:44:48,020
Should I tweet a vtuber picture of my pets unnaturally?

2027
03:44:48,740 --> 03:44:50,740
You should love yourself now

2028
03:44:51,300 --> 03:44:53,940
Starting the process butterscotch or vanilla butterscotch

2029
03:44:55,140 --> 03:44:57,140
Because that sounds delicious

2030
03:44:57,540 --> 03:45:01,540
Am I currently heading down a fulfilling career path?

2031
03:45:02,180 --> 03:45:06,740
There's a lot of Libras. I'm a Libra and you guys are all Libras. That's so cool

2032
03:45:09,860 --> 03:45:12,020
A lot is a lot is a lot is Libra babies

2033
03:45:13,060 --> 03:45:15,860
Should get new shoes or shirts. What do you need more of?

2034
03:45:16,580 --> 03:45:20,020
I feel like you I feel like you guys already know the answer to these questions

2035
03:45:20,020 --> 03:45:23,620
I feel like your shoes are broke like messed up and you need new shoes

2036
03:45:24,660 --> 03:45:26,660
They're Libra too. Yes

2037
03:45:28,100 --> 03:45:30,100
Why is everybody Libra?

2038
03:45:37,780 --> 03:45:40,420
Compatibility if you Libra and Taurus, oh

2039
03:45:41,300 --> 03:45:47,220
I don't really know compatibility stuff because again, I'm not really like I don't read like birth charts, but I'm pretty sure

2040
03:45:48,500 --> 03:45:52,660
Libras are a little bit too much for a Taurus because Taurus are a little bit more chiller

2041
03:45:53,620 --> 03:45:56,820
Whereas Libras can be kind of very flirty

2042
03:46:00,980 --> 03:46:04,980
Who was this for? Who was it? I read a chat

2043
03:46:06,660 --> 03:46:08,660
My mom's a Capricorn

2044
03:46:12,180 --> 03:46:17,460
Am I heading down a fulfilling career path? This is interesting. Um

2045
03:46:23,620 --> 03:46:25,380
Very interesting

2046
03:46:25,380 --> 03:46:29,940
You got the tower in reverse. Oh by the way if there so this is called a major arcana card

2047
03:46:30,260 --> 03:46:33,060
If there's a major arcana card, these are like the minor arcana

2048
03:46:34,020 --> 03:46:39,300
The suits when you get a major arcana card, please pay attention to what I tell you because that means it's a big pivotal thing

2049
03:46:39,700 --> 03:46:41,700
big phase in your life or whatever

2050
03:46:42,020 --> 03:46:44,020
um

2051
03:46:44,100 --> 03:46:46,820
So you got four of cups in reverse

2052
03:46:47,700 --> 03:46:49,780
And then you got the tower in reverse

2053
03:46:50,500 --> 03:46:52,500
No, the tower

2054
03:46:53,300 --> 03:46:59,140
The tower people find the tower more scary than it is. Um, it was really not this isn't funny actually

2055
03:46:59,380 --> 03:47:01,380
The last time I pulled the tower for my friend

2056
03:47:02,500 --> 03:47:03,940
um

2057
03:47:03,940 --> 03:47:05,940
Because he was like, I don't know what I'm doing with my life

2058
03:47:06,020 --> 03:47:11,060
And so I pulled and I pulled a tower for him and he ended up it was so sad

2059
03:47:11,460 --> 03:47:12,420
um

2060
03:47:12,420 --> 03:47:14,420
because he's like, I don't know where I'm going in my life

2061
03:47:15,380 --> 03:47:16,500
and

2062
03:47:16,500 --> 03:47:20,660
Pulled the tower and then literally a couple days later

2063
03:47:21,380 --> 03:47:22,260
um

2064
03:47:22,260 --> 03:47:26,900
His family members died in an accident and he had because he was the godparent

2065
03:47:26,900 --> 03:47:30,100
He adopted their child their baby that they had left behind

2066
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:33,940
And that was definitely an earth shattering thing and I was like

2067
03:47:35,620 --> 03:47:37,620
Yeah, it was crazy. That baby's so adorable though

2068
03:47:39,380 --> 03:47:42,660
But yeah, that definitely rocked their life. Um

2069
03:47:43,620 --> 03:47:47,140
The baby's okay, but it was very sad the family, you know

2070
03:47:49,780 --> 03:47:51,140
Um

2071
03:47:51,140 --> 03:47:53,140
But anyways back to this

2072
03:47:53,380 --> 03:47:55,700
So you asked about so this is for

2073
03:47:58,020 --> 03:47:59,860
Hi

2074
03:47:59,860 --> 03:48:01,300
this is for

2075
03:48:01,300 --> 03:48:03,300
Ergansson

2076
03:48:03,940 --> 03:48:05,940
Is your name like swedish? No, no

2077
03:48:07,620 --> 03:48:09,620
um

2078
03:48:10,340 --> 03:48:14,820
Pisces and a Pisces Pisces are both dreamers. They're very like down to earth

2079
03:48:14,820 --> 03:48:19,140
So I think Pisces really get along with each other. One of my best friends growing up was a Pisces

2080
03:48:20,260 --> 03:48:21,060
um

2081
03:48:21,060 --> 03:48:27,540
A new outlook a new option retreat clarity awareness time to snap out of it choosing happiness aside. I so I feel like

2082
03:48:30,100 --> 03:48:34,980
If you wait, I keep forgetting what you've actually said. Oh, it's german interesting. Um

2083
03:48:35,940 --> 03:48:37,940
I

2084
03:48:38,820 --> 03:48:40,820
Feel like

2085
03:48:41,220 --> 03:48:42,820
You are

2086
03:48:42,820 --> 03:48:45,140
Like this is a whole new thing going on

2087
03:48:45,940 --> 03:48:48,100
You're gonna gain a lot of skills from this

2088
03:48:49,220 --> 03:48:51,620
It's gonna be helpful for you

2089
03:48:53,700 --> 03:48:55,140
Because

2090
03:48:55,140 --> 03:48:59,860
But it's time to jump into action time to snap out of it. You got to be on your guard

2091
03:49:00,660 --> 03:49:05,060
Because a lot of shit's gonna happen a lot of shit is gonna hit the fan

2092
03:49:06,340 --> 03:49:10,900
This isn't don't think this is negative honestly when it's in reverse. It's actually better. Um

2093
03:49:12,100 --> 03:49:16,580
Because it's gonna be a major upstart you're gonna experience a lot of change and you can't

2094
03:49:17,300 --> 03:49:23,220
Be scared of it. You see fear of change averting disaster moment has already passed oppression carouselous negligence apathy

2095
03:49:23,460 --> 03:49:26,740
You have to be on top of your game. Otherwise

2096
03:49:27,220 --> 03:49:29,220
It's not gonna go in the way that you want

2097
03:49:29,860 --> 03:49:31,860
You

2098
03:49:33,380 --> 03:49:35,380
My german friend

2099
03:49:40,500 --> 03:49:47,460
Who do cancers get along with the best? Um, I'm a cancer rising. Um cancers

2100
03:49:49,460 --> 03:49:51,460
Cancers get along with a lot of people

2101
03:49:52,420 --> 03:49:56,820
Gemini's get along with a lot of people but they get about bad rep. I'm a gemini moon. Um

2102
03:49:57,540 --> 03:49:59,140
I

2103
03:49:59,140 --> 03:50:01,460
Don't get guys. I don't really know birth chart stuff

2104
03:50:02,660 --> 03:50:08,340
I can tell you like I can kind of suss who you are from your your big five and your big three, but otherwise

2105
03:50:10,420 --> 03:50:16,740
Your family is going on vacation while they're staying home. Will they be okay cancer? Oh, that's such a cancer thing to ask

2106
03:50:16,820 --> 03:50:20,420
We're such a caring person, aren't you? You're very emotional. You're very you're very like

2107
03:50:21,380 --> 03:50:23,780
I just want them to be okay. They'll be fine

2108
03:50:24,020 --> 03:50:26,020
They'll be okay

2109
03:50:28,980 --> 03:50:30,980
While she comes back he's like my whole family died

2110
03:50:32,500 --> 03:50:34,500
He'll they'll be don't don't fret

2111
03:50:36,100 --> 03:50:39,220
Um, I've been hurt by a lot of people I trusted how can I learn to trust again?

2112
03:50:39,940 --> 03:50:46,260
Morgan you threw like 50 different questions at me. I'm just gonna give you a general reading because you seem to be going through a baby girl

2113
03:50:48,820 --> 03:50:50,820
Am I gonna die filthy rich? No

2114
03:50:51,620 --> 03:50:54,660
What am I got your rules? They're gonna look like shit. I'm so sorry, but they're gonna be shit

2115
03:50:54,660 --> 03:50:58,660
You're gonna pull one really good person are a couple, but like I'm mostly they're gonna be shit

2116
03:51:05,220 --> 03:51:09,380
There's a lot of there's a lot of water in this chat. There's a lot of Pisces a lot of cancer

2117
03:51:10,740 --> 03:51:12,740
there's some

2118
03:51:12,900 --> 03:51:15,700
The lebras and stuff. I can't remember what labor is

2119
03:51:17,140 --> 03:51:18,900
That's fine

2120
03:51:18,900 --> 03:51:20,900
Tall rose that's a pokemon

2121
03:51:21,860 --> 03:51:23,860
None of you are dying rich

2122
03:51:24,500 --> 03:51:27,860
Your tars. Okay. We got some we got all the signs. We just don't have a lot of fire in here

2123
03:51:29,300 --> 03:51:34,020
You don't need fortune to know about gotcha. You're in areas. Okay, so you do got some fire signs in here

2124
03:51:35,860 --> 03:51:39,620
Oh my god, your life is a mess

2125
03:51:42,180 --> 03:51:44,180
Really pop

2126
03:51:44,500 --> 03:51:47,540
But don't worry the wheel keeps turning

2127
03:51:48,900 --> 03:51:50,900
Oh

2128
03:51:52,740 --> 03:52:00,180
Shit you actually got six cards and I feel like they're applicable. So I'll speed run all your cars more again

2129
03:52:03,780 --> 03:52:07,700
Of course, this is an air car. I know that makes me mad too. I'm like, why did they call it an areas?

2130
03:52:08,900 --> 03:52:10,900
So you got eight of cups

2131
03:52:11,140 --> 03:52:15,140
You got ace of swords. You got wheel of fortune. You got

2132
03:52:15,380 --> 03:52:22,980
What is this nine wands you got the devil you got nine of pentacles

2133
03:52:26,740 --> 03:52:29,240
The baby baby you're going over here

2134
03:52:39,940 --> 03:52:43,140
I'm gonna I'm gonna lay I do you want me to be blunt?

2135
03:52:46,100 --> 03:52:48,100
Because you will cry

2136
03:52:52,340 --> 03:52:55,060
All for the lios in the chat. All right

2137
03:53:00,020 --> 03:53:06,820
You gotta move on some shit happened to you gotta leave it behind you've been holding on to stuff you gotta let it go

2138
03:53:09,220 --> 03:53:14,740
You gotta let stuff go you tend to attach yourself to an idea or person and you

2139
03:53:16,020 --> 03:53:18,020
Beat yourself up over things

2140
03:53:18,660 --> 03:53:20,580
You need to stop

2141
03:53:20,580 --> 03:53:22,580
That's represented by the eight of cups

2142
03:53:22,740 --> 03:53:25,940
Moving on unfulfilled from current situation abandonment

2143
03:53:27,060 --> 03:53:29,860
Walking away into the unknown letting go is searching for truth leaving

2144
03:53:30,900 --> 03:53:32,820
You victimize yourself so much

2145
03:53:33,780 --> 03:53:36,180
And you're very valid for that. You've been through a lot of shit

2146
03:53:37,060 --> 03:53:42,340
But you gotta let it go you gotta move forward. You're never gonna move forward unless you release it

2147
03:53:42,420 --> 03:53:44,420
You gotta release that pain girly pop

2148
03:53:45,860 --> 03:53:50,660
If you do this if you manage to do this ace of sorts you'll be having a new mentality ace again

2149
03:53:51,540 --> 03:53:53,540
beginning

2150
03:53:53,620 --> 03:53:58,100
You'll have a breakthrough truth new insights new ideas vision focus mental clarity success

2151
03:53:58,260 --> 03:54:00,660
You'll allow yourself to heal and move forward

2152
03:54:02,100 --> 03:54:07,620
You'll have a you'll realize things about yourself that you never had before you'll have this mental clarity

2153
03:54:08,740 --> 03:54:10,900
You'll have a new focus rather than

2154
03:54:11,620 --> 03:54:16,100
Lingering on the past so much you've been so wrapped up. You can't focus you've been stuck in this negative mental state

2155
03:54:18,260 --> 03:54:25,140
Good luck will come your way the wheel of fortune is always turning. It's always turning for everybody

2156
03:54:25,860 --> 03:54:27,860
when it's upright

2157
03:54:30,180 --> 03:54:32,820
Good luck fate life cycles destiny

2158
03:54:33,300 --> 03:54:38,500
A turning point universes in control changes cycle karma unsuspected unexpected events

2159
03:54:38,660 --> 03:54:41,540
You gotta lot should happen. You gotta let things go

2160
03:54:42,420 --> 03:54:44,420
Allow yourself to grow mentally

2161
03:54:44,820 --> 03:54:49,380
And just leave it up to you know, if you believe in god, I don't know if you believe in spirits

2162
03:54:49,460 --> 03:54:53,460
I don't know your ancestors will have you you gotta leave it up to the universe leave it in their hands

2163
03:54:57,540 --> 03:54:59,940
Because however

2164
03:55:02,820 --> 03:55:04,820
If you don't do this, this is what will happen

2165
03:55:04,900 --> 03:55:12,580
If you can't let things go you will continue to struggle and you'll be overwhelmed you'll be a defensive person

2166
03:55:12,580 --> 03:55:13,940
You won't be yourself

2167
03:55:13,940 --> 03:55:18,100
You'll be someone like someone can tell you something and then you'll feel and this isn't a bad thing

2168
03:55:19,540 --> 03:55:21,540
Because of course you're entitled to your trauma

2169
03:55:22,340 --> 03:55:27,940
But you make it about you and you get really defensive and you got paranoid that you think people are coming to attack you

2170
03:55:27,940 --> 03:55:29,940
They're not you see this person

2171
03:55:30,100 --> 03:55:31,700
They're standing

2172
03:55:31,700 --> 03:55:34,180
Around some stuff they can walk out of these

2173
03:55:34,820 --> 03:55:37,300
They can just walk away from all of these they but they choose not to

2174
03:55:39,140 --> 03:55:41,140
And then you'll be just so exhausted

2175
03:55:41,380 --> 03:55:42,740
You can't be stubborn

2176
03:55:42,740 --> 03:55:45,300
virginity refusing compromise you need to allow yourself

2177
03:55:45,940 --> 03:55:47,940
to move forward

2178
03:55:47,940 --> 03:55:49,940
the devil oh

2179
03:55:50,260 --> 03:55:54,580
Beautiful card. I love the devil card. Isn't this sick? Look at all. This is this is me with you guys

2180
03:56:01,220 --> 03:56:04,180
So you see the devil here people think oh demons no

2181
03:56:05,540 --> 03:56:08,500
So you can see the devil the devil represents bad habits

2182
03:56:09,220 --> 03:56:13,620
But you can see he's loot and these people are chained to him, but he's loosely holding these chains

2183
03:56:14,180 --> 03:56:15,700
People think they're

2184
03:56:15,700 --> 03:56:20,100
They tend to put blame on things that is only up to them. They could leave if they wanted

2185
03:56:22,180 --> 03:56:24,740
But they choose not to they are they are slave to their bad

2186
03:56:25,700 --> 03:56:27,540
bad habits

2187
03:56:27,540 --> 03:56:30,260
It was in reverse initially, so I'll tell you what's in what that means reverse

2188
03:56:30,660 --> 03:56:32,660
So recovery

2189
03:56:32,740 --> 03:56:39,780
Leaving abusive toxic situations attachment freedom facing shadows independent reclaiming power release you need to face that trauma that you've been through

2190
03:56:40,420 --> 03:56:44,260
I've heard you talk about stuff before you need to face it. You need to accept it. You need to let it go

2191
03:56:44,900 --> 03:56:47,780
Move on again. That is a trend here. Let it go

2192
03:56:48,820 --> 03:56:50,420
Let it go

2193
03:56:50,420 --> 03:56:52,020
Let it go

2194
03:56:52,020 --> 03:56:54,020
you know

2195
03:56:54,020 --> 03:56:58,580
Um, if you're some sort of toxic situation get the fuck out of there, bro

2196
03:56:58,580 --> 03:57:03,940
I don't know if you got someone who's like a really shitty friend, but cut them off

2197
03:57:05,140 --> 03:57:07,140
They're not serving you

2198
03:57:11,220 --> 03:57:13,460
I feel like you'll this I feel like there's a person somebody

2199
03:57:14,340 --> 03:57:17,780
Um, I don't know if it's a another friend or like a romantic relationship

2200
03:57:18,020 --> 03:57:21,940
But I feel like you'll meet someone who will be willing to guide you. You just have to accept the hell

2201
03:57:22,820 --> 03:57:24,820
And they are practical reliable stoic

2202
03:57:25,300 --> 03:57:29,060
Um, they take things slow and steady so they'll be patient with you while in your healing process

2203
03:57:29,700 --> 03:57:31,460
Um, they'll be committed

2204
03:57:31,460 --> 03:57:36,020
They're grounded. They're patient. They're efficient. They're conservative. They're pragmatic. So they they're reasonable

2205
03:57:36,660 --> 03:57:41,060
Look out for this person if you already have a friend like this rely on them, you know, they'll help you out

2206
03:57:43,220 --> 03:57:45,220
I hope that resonates

2207
03:57:49,700 --> 03:57:52,020
What's the name of the deck, uh, I can tell you right now

2208
03:57:52,580 --> 03:57:56,180
It is lucid dreams beginner tarot

2209
03:57:57,140 --> 03:57:59,140
um

2210
03:57:59,940 --> 03:58:03,140
From st. Soleil, which is funny because my cast name is Soleil. That's why I got this deck

2211
03:58:04,820 --> 03:58:08,100
I have several decks. I have this deck as well

2212
03:58:12,100 --> 03:58:19,700
This is the um writer weight tarot except it's like a different edition. So it's like gold and shiny and stuff

2213
03:58:22,740 --> 03:58:25,700
Page of pentacles also. Thank you for reading so many

Of course more again, of course

2217
03:58:34,500 --> 03:58:36,500
Get this flower out of the way

2218
03:58:38,980 --> 03:58:40,980
That's why I asked

2219
03:58:41,700 --> 03:58:43,700
That's why I asked

2220
03:58:44,580 --> 03:58:46,580
Everybody give some love to Morgan

2221
03:58:47,940 --> 03:58:50,420
It'll be tough, but you'll be able to do it. It'll take time

2222
03:58:50,420 --> 03:58:52,420
It's not gonna happen overnight. You're pop

2223
03:58:54,980 --> 03:58:56,980
I love doing tarot. It's so fun

2224
03:59:01,460 --> 03:59:07,300
I just hit my fingy it's over a hundred bucks. Yes. I size it was on sale. I think I got it for 70

2225
03:59:18,020 --> 03:59:20,020
What about the page of pentacles

2226
03:59:20,660 --> 03:59:22,660
Yeah, page of pentacles, uh

2227
03:59:23,380 --> 03:59:25,380
That was about like manifestation and stuff

2228
03:59:26,580 --> 03:59:31,060
If that resonated with you, maybe you need to work on your manifestation and you're getting that money up, bro

2229
03:59:32,820 --> 03:59:36,660
Yeah, yeah, I just I just slammed my pinky finger. I'm fine

2230
03:59:37,620 --> 03:59:39,620
kind of red

2231
03:59:40,420 --> 03:59:42,420
I didn't run over my toes

2232
03:59:44,900 --> 03:59:47,940
That's where I call lucid dreams like I should come back to stream

2233
03:59:50,980 --> 03:59:55,460
Yeah, I popped out of the deck. Yep. That's true

2234
04:00:00,660 --> 04:00:07,380
It's funny. I forget what happened. I was streaming and then no, I wasn't streaming. I was about to start streaming and um

2235
04:00:10,020 --> 04:00:12,020
A card randomly fell

2236
04:00:12,900 --> 04:00:16,420
From up here. So like this is where I keep a part of my deck. It's kind of dark

2237
04:00:16,580 --> 04:00:21,300
But like where the bird skull is mind you the bird skull is on it and it just like fell out

2238
04:00:21,460 --> 04:00:23,460
And I was like this was tucked in though

2239
04:00:23,700 --> 04:00:28,020
Um, it fell out from the top and I forget what card it was but I was like what the heck

2240
04:00:28,660 --> 04:00:29,860
um

2241
04:00:29,860 --> 04:00:31,860
Like why are you throwing stuff at me?

2242
04:00:33,060 --> 04:00:35,060

2244
04:00:43,780 --> 04:00:45,780
So I like I'm sitting like this

2245
04:00:47,060 --> 04:00:50,580
And I just like I have like my foot like this and then I just roll over

2246
04:00:57,940 --> 04:00:59,940
I don't know why I knew that

2247
04:01:01,140 --> 04:01:03,140
It's tucking my foot up in that

2248
04:01:04,500 --> 04:01:08,580
I'm not no, it's to be to uh, I don't know what type of bird it is

2249
04:01:11,300 --> 04:01:13,140
I'm just gripping it

2250
04:01:13,220 --> 04:01:18,340
I'm just I just almost did it myself again. I can't I'm just I'm just like the wheel is there. So I'm just

2251
04:01:19,460 --> 04:01:21,460
Hold on to it and then I rolled forward

2252
04:01:28,260 --> 04:01:30,260
Okay

2253
04:01:30,980 --> 04:01:34,820
You have a foot rest, don't you? Yes, but I'm turned the other way my foot wrist is on the other side

2254
04:01:35,620 --> 04:01:39,380
On all my chair. Yeah, but I'll still actually I could put my feet up

2255
04:01:43,460 --> 04:01:45,460
Yeah

2256
04:01:45,780 --> 04:01:47,780
There you go

2257
04:01:48,100 --> 04:01:50,100
I'm wearing a really big hoodie

2258
04:01:50,340 --> 04:01:56,580
It's like I'll show you I'm wearing a really big hoodie. This is not these are my knees and then my feet are down there

2259
04:01:57,380 --> 04:01:59,380

2260
04:02:00,980 --> 04:02:02,980
They're tucked in

2261
04:02:06,100 --> 04:02:08,100
Those were my knees

2262
04:02:08,900 --> 04:02:10,900
I'm tucked into my hoodie

2263
04:02:13,220 --> 04:02:15,220

04:02:17,140 --> 04:02:22,260
Bundled up I like being bundled up and cozy. That's why I like oversized hoodies. Thank you for buying me the oversized

2265
04:02:23,860 --> 04:02:25,860

04:02:29,140 --> 04:02:31,380
Oh, he doesn't feel like dating. Oh

04:02:33,940 --> 04:02:35,300
Well, if you guys have different

2268
04:02:35,300 --> 04:02:40,900
I don't need cards to tell talk about that if you guys have different ideas of what you want in a relationship

2269
04:02:40,900 --> 04:02:44,020
Like she just wants to hit it and quit and you actually have like a deep crush

2270
04:02:44,900 --> 04:02:50,660
Then I really do feel like you should look elsewhere because I'll just cause more problems on the road and you might get hurt

2271
04:02:51,300 --> 04:02:53,300
um, however

2272
04:02:54,900 --> 04:02:59,460
It might give you the opportunity to change her mind, but do you want to go through that? You know

2273
04:03:01,140 --> 04:03:03,140
Oh, we're gonna get so cozy together

2274
04:03:03,940 --> 04:03:05,940

2278
04:03:28,900 --> 04:03:30,900
Hmm, okay, the child is sleeping

2279
04:03:31,620 --> 04:03:33,620
You

2280
04:03:37,780 --> 04:03:41,380
She doesn't feel mentally ready for a relationship. Oh, okay, then um

2281
04:03:43,380 --> 04:03:47,860
I feel you feel like you should disrespect her wishes and she's not mentally ready, you know

2282
04:03:48,980 --> 04:03:52,100
Might not have a good time if you're like, hey try to convince her

2283
04:03:53,940 --> 04:03:55,940
We're variety streaming now

2284
04:03:56,500 --> 04:03:57,700
I

2285
04:03:57,700 --> 04:04:02,100
Did a hit and quit with the girl asked for something more about she refused you didn't want me to catch feelings

2286
04:04:02,660 --> 04:04:04,660
I don't get how people can do that

2287
04:04:05,140 --> 04:04:07,060
I don't know how people have

2288
04:04:07,060 --> 04:04:12,580
Like hit and quit and then like can't catch feelings. I forget what that's called

2289
04:04:13,380 --> 04:04:18,420
Like was it if you have to in order to do stuff if you have to give romantic feelings is like demisexual

2290
04:04:19,140 --> 04:04:21,140
Like I could have not

2291
04:04:21,300 --> 04:04:23,300
do that

2292
04:04:23,540 --> 04:04:28,900
I'm impressed by people who can like set their emotions aside to do that

2293
04:04:29,620 --> 04:04:35,620
But then I'm not knocking like if you guys do that. I'm not like hating on you or whatever. I'm just I just don't care

2294
04:04:35,620 --> 04:04:37,620
I had around it

2295
04:04:39,780 --> 04:04:43,060
I won't try to force her. Yeah, I'm sorry. I was a poor choice of words

2296
04:04:43,940 --> 04:04:45,140
um

2297
04:04:45,140 --> 04:04:48,900
Maybe you should speak to her and ask her like when she thinks she could be ready

2298
04:04:49,060 --> 04:04:55,460
I want to be surprised if you already had that conversation, you know, this is turning into an advice stream an advice stream

2299
04:04:56,100 --> 04:04:58,100
with my hands

2300
04:04:59,860 --> 04:05:01,860
Can I point the camera down?

2301
04:05:06,340 --> 04:05:08,340
The camera's gonna fall

2302
04:05:13,620 --> 04:05:15,620
The looper of this was like

2303
04:05:15,780 --> 04:05:17,780
Honey

2304
04:05:18,660 --> 04:05:20,660
Yeah, you guys already know how I am

2305
04:05:21,220 --> 04:05:26,420
I'd catch feelings so easily too if you're a cancer you'd catch feelings by the way cancers are so like

2306
04:05:27,300 --> 04:05:30,500
Have feel so hard as someone who is a cancer rising myself

2307
04:05:33,540 --> 04:05:36,980
Where's the sock puppet? Oh, it's a good point. Where's the sock though?

2308
04:05:37,380 --> 04:05:39,380
Oh

2309
04:05:44,820 --> 04:05:46,820
Is it cheating to bring a knife

2310
04:05:48,260 --> 04:05:53,380
Why would you why why are you making fights with the bear? What did the bear do to you? Don't fight with it

2311
04:05:54,100 --> 04:05:56,100
The child is sleeping

2312
04:06:07,300 --> 04:06:09,300
Oh

2313
04:06:23,860 --> 04:06:25,860
The bear started it

2314
04:06:25,860 --> 04:06:27,860
Why are you fighting the bear?

2315
04:06:28,100 --> 04:06:34,020
Respect mother nature's creatures. This is hard to do because my nail so this looks like a really sharp chin

2316
04:06:37,540 --> 04:06:39,540
Has to call with me

2317
04:06:39,700 --> 04:06:42,900
I'm gonna bring the self-conditioned your conversation

2318
04:06:44,580 --> 04:06:49,300
Well, it's up to you if you want to avoid the conflict. That's not conflict, but you want to avoid the conversation enough

2319
04:06:50,580 --> 04:06:52,580
And what sword is more honorable

2320
04:06:55,860 --> 04:06:57,700
Too much reach

2321
04:06:57,700 --> 04:07:03,940
Well, the bear is like you have to even the playing field. I don't know why do you insist on

2322
04:07:04,980 --> 04:07:06,900
like

2323
04:07:07,060 --> 04:07:11,940
You can't win a bear in a fist fight. You gotta bring something with you, bro. You know

2324
04:07:13,060 --> 04:07:15,060
Like I don't know what to tell you

2325
04:07:19,940 --> 04:07:24,420
Okay, but then it has like multiple knives then because they have paws

2326
04:07:25,060 --> 04:07:27,220
So are you gonna bring multiple knives?

2327
04:07:28,020 --> 04:07:31,300
Or would you lay out the length of

2328
04:07:32,100 --> 04:07:34,100
The bear's claws

2329
04:07:34,180 --> 04:07:36,180
To see if it is as long as a sword

2330
04:07:37,540 --> 04:07:39,540
I think that's interesting

2331
04:07:44,740 --> 04:07:46,740
Puppet streams, I don't know

2332
04:07:46,740 --> 04:07:49,540
I have to work on that. I would actually get probably get like

2333
04:07:50,180 --> 04:07:52,180
actual puppets, you know

2334
04:07:53,620 --> 04:07:56,420
Is this is this a fringing upon socks agency?

2335
04:07:57,780 --> 04:07:59,780
Isn't this their thing?

2336
04:08:06,980 --> 04:08:08,980
I

2337
04:08:24,180 --> 04:08:29,940
It's like that one it's like that one, uh, that one mine goes

2338
04:08:31,540 --> 04:08:33,540

2357
04:11:22,180 --> 04:11:28,180
Oh, I forget. I'm like what like negative three or something. Are they really that nasty?

2358
04:11:30,340 --> 04:11:32,340
No

2359
04:11:33,540 --> 04:11:35,540
Actually, I just put fingerprints on them again

2360
04:11:36,340 --> 04:11:41,380
Hold this. Oh, sorry. Hold on a second. I can't see the chat

2361
04:11:41,380 --> 04:11:43,380

2362
04:11:51,380 --> 04:11:53,380

2363
04:11:53,540 --> 04:11:55,540
R

2364
04:12:09,460 --> 04:12:11,700
Brand new whip for these shebees like

2366
04:12:23,380 --> 04:12:25,380
I

2367
04:12:40,100 --> 04:12:44,820
Didn't want to cover fuck shit stack by Reggie Watts. I've said this multiple times

2368
04:12:49,620 --> 04:12:51,620
I'm drinking my lemonade

2369
04:12:53,780 --> 04:13:00,900
Lemonade country ice beat it once beat it twice

2370
04:13:06,500 --> 04:13:08,500
You guys ever do like those hand games

2371
04:13:08,900 --> 04:13:10,900
Oh

2372
04:13:23,140 --> 04:13:25,140
I can't even do it

2373
04:13:32,420 --> 04:13:34,420
I can't even remember how to do it

2374
04:13:38,980 --> 04:13:40,980
I

2375
04:13:43,860 --> 04:13:46,500
Imagine this if this sock was like rock hard like

2376
04:13:51,380 --> 04:13:53,380
What was it I

2377
04:13:55,300 --> 04:13:57,860
What if it was a rock hard sock and I just chewed on it

2378
04:14:01,220 --> 04:14:04,020
You're like, oh, thank you for the snack. How been?

2379
04:14:04,580 --> 04:14:06,580
Oh

2380
04:14:09,460 --> 04:14:12,260
Delicious, I'll finish the rest later

2381
04:14:14,660 --> 04:14:20,500
Oh strani, dude, maybe that's why I thought of it. I think maybe she said it in passing and I forgot

2382
04:14:24,660 --> 04:14:26,660
Eating on the crust to be it's

2383
04:14:27,940 --> 04:14:30,340
I'm down. I'm down. I'm down. That is yours. Oh

2384
04:14:30,340 --> 04:14:32,340
Oh

2385
04:14:33,860 --> 04:14:38,900
Krusty sock comes a little bit too good. Is there a hole in this? Oh, no

2386
04:14:42,740 --> 04:14:44,740
Hi

2387
04:14:47,540 --> 04:14:57,700
That's definitely why I'm naked. Oh, no someone save me. I'm so overtired guys

2388
04:15:00,420 --> 04:15:02,420
Krusty sock for dead

2389
04:15:10,020 --> 04:15:12,020
She be sock fancy I just like wrap

2390
04:15:14,500 --> 04:15:16,180
Like

2391
04:15:16,180 --> 04:15:23,220
Just like put the sock over that you know what I'm talking about the bible a pink bible and then yeah

2392
04:15:23,460 --> 04:15:25,460
I

2393
04:15:27,220 --> 04:15:30,740
Really no, I would not do handgabs for fancy

2394
04:15:33,780 --> 04:15:40,260
Actually for a for a an instruction manual that would actually be pretty good

2395
04:15:41,620 --> 04:15:46,820
Although I've never done that before so I probably wouldn't be good at it visually

2396
04:15:46,820 --> 04:15:48,820
Okay

2397
04:15:52,580 --> 04:15:56,500
Be more of these terrors ask you streams maybe if people like them

2398
04:15:57,460 --> 04:16:02,260
Again, I probably won't do that for a long time because it's emi's niche. That's her that's her thing. So

2399
04:16:04,340 --> 04:16:06,340
I don't want to

2400
04:16:06,500 --> 04:16:08,500
Yeah

2401
04:16:08,820 --> 04:16:10,820
What's that dolls action figures?

2402
04:16:11,540 --> 04:16:16,100
It's okay, we'll pull in the gaps

2403
04:16:20,820 --> 04:16:22,820
So, uh

2404
04:16:30,740 --> 04:16:34,180
You like jazz I'm just gonna go

2405
04:16:40,820 --> 04:16:42,820
I

2406
04:16:48,340 --> 04:16:50,500
I'm holding my boobs and laughing hysterically

2407
04:16:51,460 --> 04:16:53,460
Hysterically

2408
04:17:06,980 --> 04:17:12,580
No, no the minecraft yourself you're so beautiful. No, I kill yourself. You're so sexy

2409
04:17:12,740 --> 04:17:14,740
Yeah

2410
04:17:18,820 --> 04:17:21,700
How can I read I should just I just end it

2411
04:17:23,060 --> 04:17:27,460
My nails look nice. Thank you. I should I should stop prolonging the inevitable

2412
04:17:29,220 --> 04:17:31,220
Killing myself in minecraft

2413
04:17:31,300 --> 04:17:33,300
um

2414
04:17:34,740 --> 04:17:38,740
I'm kidding you right now. Where's there's more bunny puns? I can't really think of bunny puns

2415
04:17:39,700 --> 04:17:44,580
Strani's playing verma tide vermin tide. I don't know what that is

2416
04:17:52,580 --> 04:17:56,420
She's playing with people you stream snipe

2417
04:17:58,740 --> 04:18:00,740
I don't know what that game is

2418
04:18:00,740 --> 04:18:02,740
is that like a

2419
04:18:02,980 --> 04:18:04,980
vampire

2420
04:18:05,060 --> 04:18:12,020
Why would I raid nanashi mume? Why are you guys trying to groom me into raiding hollow girls?

2421
04:18:16,420 --> 04:18:20,740
She's playing with raflins. She's a wolf. It's a wolf hammer horde game. Okay

2422
04:18:22,980 --> 04:18:26,340
I'm not raiding nanashi mume. I don't want to

2423
04:18:27,060 --> 04:18:29,060
know

2424
04:18:29,940 --> 04:18:33,620
Because they want me to like die they want me to raid

2425
04:18:34,420 --> 04:18:36,420
People so much huger than me

2426
04:18:38,180 --> 04:18:41,860
Like I was embarrassed raiding pipa because I just raided her

2427
04:18:42,980 --> 04:18:45,940
But you would raid no, I couldn't raid she already she already my wife bro

2428
04:18:45,940 --> 04:18:50,660
I can't even don't even get me started bro. I can't talk about her. She messed me up bro my heart

2429
04:18:51,780 --> 04:18:53,780
I fell in love with her

2430
04:18:53,780 --> 04:18:55,780
I can't stop

2431
04:19:02,180 --> 04:19:06,900
Guys are cute girls. I don't hollow would never look my way bros

2432
04:19:06,980 --> 04:19:13,780
I would love to befriend some of the hollow girls. That'll never happen. I'm a whore. What don't you understand?

2433
04:19:23,940 --> 04:19:25,940
Oh

2434
04:19:32,660 --> 04:19:34,660
Guys I don't want

2435
04:19:34,980 --> 04:19:36,980
If I raided

2436
04:19:36,980 --> 04:19:38,980
those people

2437
04:19:39,060 --> 04:19:41,780
If I raided vtubers that were like that large

2438
04:19:43,220 --> 04:19:45,860
Because people like it's not like people don't know who I am

2439
04:19:46,820 --> 04:19:48,740
Well, they like they obviously might not know who I am

2440
04:19:48,740 --> 04:19:55,940
But they don't know who viola is and so they'll be like why is this whole raiding or oh, she and then they'll try to kill me

2441
04:20:00,500 --> 04:20:02,500
They're be replied to body marks well

2442
04:20:14,340 --> 04:20:16,500
I don't want I don't want I don't want

2443
04:20:16,740 --> 04:20:20,100
I don't want to get bait threats about me

2444
04:20:20,420 --> 04:20:25,140
But like why are those whore raiders? Why did the why did they do this epic rap battles?

2445
04:20:25,220 --> 04:20:29,460
I didn't notice you shared the same thing. That's so funny. No, Elizabeth Rose black plane

2446
04:20:31,700 --> 04:20:33,700
Um

2447
04:20:34,260 --> 04:20:35,460
I also

2448
04:20:35,460 --> 04:20:37,460
Yeah, I just don't want to offend

2449
04:20:37,540 --> 04:20:42,260
Anyone again. I'm very nervous when it comes to other people because I just

2450
04:20:43,220 --> 04:20:48,660
I am scared and I want everybody to like me and that's not the case

2451
04:20:51,380 --> 04:20:53,380
And it makes me sad

2452
04:20:54,660 --> 04:20:56,660
Proceeds to cry

2453
04:20:57,460 --> 04:20:59,460
I don't know why that puts on the mask

2454
04:21:01,780 --> 04:21:04,740
They only cared about me when I put on the mask

2455
04:21:07,780 --> 04:21:09,780
She already would love me

2456
04:21:13,220 --> 04:21:15,220
Nobody

2457
04:21:17,220 --> 04:21:19,220
People think we're prostitutes

2458
04:21:22,420 --> 04:21:24,420
Girl pillars together

2459
04:21:24,500 --> 04:21:31,540
I know like no like I I see streamers and I'm like wow we would get along really well and

2460
04:21:32,820 --> 04:21:34,820
And it's funny because like

2461
04:21:35,540 --> 04:21:36,100
um

2462
04:21:36,100 --> 04:21:39,860
That's happened a few times the few people that collabed with because like they were much bigger than me when I was

2463
04:21:39,860 --> 04:21:41,300
Rinnner

2464
04:21:41,300 --> 04:21:44,980
When I was Rinnah and I was just like oh, I'll never ever have a chance

2465
04:21:45,300 --> 04:21:50,260
But they're so cool. But then I collabed with someone like like beside it in an Apollo and

2466
04:21:51,460 --> 04:21:57,460
And I'm like wow, that's just cool. And then I just look at other vtuber's and I'm like they never like me

2467
04:22:02,500 --> 04:22:04,500
I don't know

2468
04:22:06,020 --> 04:22:09,460
It's funny because I don't give a shit about like the negative things people say

2469
04:22:10,020 --> 04:22:13,940
I've said this the last stream like I don't care someone like whines about me

2470
04:22:14,820 --> 04:22:21,060
I'm like write it or whatever. I don't care about that. It's literally like I'm so worried about other vtubers think of me

2471
04:22:22,660 --> 04:22:26,340
And I'm trying to find a way to get over that but it's mostly because I just want to set a good example

2472
04:22:28,180 --> 04:22:33,380
But I know um emmy's short is popping up popping off about the avtuber stuff

2473
04:22:33,380 --> 04:22:38,260
So that makes me happy because I think I hope that reaches people and teaches them that would chill

2474
04:22:40,820 --> 04:22:43,860
I couldn't raise I couldn't raise she or me

2475
04:22:45,860 --> 04:22:47,860
I am just lowly

2476
04:22:48,260 --> 04:22:50,260
I'm a lowly three view

2477
04:22:50,980 --> 04:22:54,980
I'm not even a high three view. She would never look my way

2478
04:22:57,700 --> 04:23:03,380
No one would look my way. I'm such a I'm gonna I'm gonna number number cry for a moment

2479
04:23:04,340 --> 04:23:07,460
I am small actually. No, I'm not small. That's a freaking lie

2480
04:23:09,940 --> 04:23:13,380
Oh, that's a freaking lie carry me to the top

2481
04:23:18,820 --> 04:23:22,340
Vtubers or something at a starter take your time. Yeah, I don't know

2482
04:23:22,500 --> 04:23:28,580
I just feel like a lot of people have already been kind of like poisoned against us. So like what like I don't

2483
04:23:29,380 --> 04:23:32,340
What's that quote the best way to avoid?

2484
04:23:33,460 --> 04:23:35,460
disappointment

2485
04:23:35,540 --> 04:23:38,260
Or being disappointed to not do something at all

2486
04:23:40,820 --> 04:23:45,460
She really move my clips at the time you play with my cat. Yeah, I'm growing

2487
04:23:50,820 --> 04:23:52,820
Sacks work

2488
04:23:59,940 --> 04:24:03,060
I need to draw a tarot for these feelings. All right

2489
04:24:10,820 --> 04:24:15,860
That's not true though, because I've already have people say that they don't like me so that makes me

2490
04:24:24,100 --> 04:24:26,100
Record myself feeding Fia

2491
04:24:28,420 --> 04:24:30,420
That's true

2492
04:24:39,860 --> 04:24:41,860
So

2493
04:24:51,460 --> 04:24:58,100
Yeah, that's why I'm a little bit more cautious like you might be see me do less collabs because I'm just anxious about that sort of stuff

2494
04:25:00,980 --> 04:25:04,580
Why is the chat summary that let me see what's the chat summary

2495
04:25:04,980 --> 04:25:06,980
You

No, a justice stands for in reverse

2518
04:27:56,100 --> 04:27:58,100
dishonesty

2519
04:27:59,940 --> 04:28:04,260
Unfairness a bigotry lack of accountability

2520
04:28:09,940 --> 04:28:11,940
Guys I'm never making any fucking friends

2521
04:28:13,540 --> 04:28:15,540
I

2522
04:28:19,940 --> 04:28:22,420
Been called that surprisingly I've seen it forms

2523
04:28:27,700 --> 04:28:35,700
Which I don't understand because it doesn't make any sense. Um, hollow justice laugh

2524
04:28:37,860 --> 04:28:41,860
That'd be sick. I would love to call out. I have already said, um

2525
04:28:44,100 --> 04:28:46,100
Uh

2526
04:28:47,780 --> 04:28:50,740
Um gg was one of my oh she's

2527
04:28:54,020 --> 04:29:01,220
Maybe maybe I'll become bfs with urb and she'll teach me some ways for voice acting

2528
04:29:07,460 --> 04:29:09,460
Guys

2529
04:29:09,700 --> 04:29:13,700
This isn't good

2530
04:29:18,580 --> 04:29:22,820
But like I feel like this is just I feel like this isn't a reflection of me

2531
04:29:30,980 --> 04:29:32,980
I feel like

2532
04:29:33,540 --> 04:29:39,300
This has to do with just how the community sees us like they're kind of

2533
04:29:41,940 --> 04:29:45,140
Yeah, or like they're treating us unfairly

2534
04:29:46,980 --> 04:29:48,980
Yeah

2535
04:29:49,380 --> 04:29:52,900
Yeah, it is what you make it you right you right

2536
04:29:54,580 --> 04:29:58,820
Yeah, I feel like I feel like you're right. It is a reflection of the people judging us and not just

2537
04:29:59,620 --> 04:30:03,540
That's very valid. Like it's kind of validating that it's just like

2538
04:30:04,340 --> 04:30:10,420
But like will it turn to be like this like will will I get to clap with hollow justice?

2539
04:30:14,420 --> 04:30:17,460
Like I know I know this is a reflection of I like I knew that when I pulled it

2540
04:30:17,460 --> 04:30:21,220
I just I was upset because it was just telling me something I already knew

2541
04:30:23,300 --> 04:30:25,620
What do I do what do I do?

2542
04:30:28,980 --> 04:30:30,980
Yeah

2543
04:30:32,500 --> 04:30:37,700
Oh now oh now you want to talk now you want to talk, okay

2544
04:30:41,300 --> 04:30:45,540
Ain't big I just start coasting up to the home okay, but like mind you

2545
04:30:46,660 --> 04:30:48,660
I don't do that for like

2546
04:30:49,460 --> 04:30:51,460
personal gain like I don't

2547
04:30:51,780 --> 04:30:52,820
I don't

2548
04:30:52,820 --> 04:30:55,540
Collab with people and see it as a business thing

2549
04:30:55,540 --> 04:31:00,980
I see it as like I'm someone to build friendships with and that's why I feel like a lot of people

2550
04:31:00,980 --> 04:31:05,220
wouldn't want to people think like I'm talking to them because they want something from them and I'm just like

2551
04:31:05,220 --> 04:31:07,220
I just want to be your friend

2552
04:31:16,180 --> 04:31:18,180
You trying to make me cry cards

2553
04:31:18,340 --> 04:31:24,900
So when I pull the magician, I know it's usually representing myself and this is in reverse

2554
04:31:27,860 --> 04:31:29,860
So let me pull another card

2555
04:31:31,460 --> 04:31:35,060
You nearly made my one of the nicest speech ever since we're going to you feel. Thank you, Miwa

2556
04:31:38,980 --> 04:31:45,380
I wanted to collab with grot. No, you got you with grot. Oh my god. No way. She's in my life

2557
04:31:45,620 --> 04:31:47,620
Oh

2558
04:31:49,540 --> 04:31:52,500
Why am I only pulling major arcana?

2559
04:31:55,380 --> 04:31:57,380
I'm gonna cry

2560
04:32:00,260 --> 04:32:02,260
Okay, so this is what I pulled

2561
04:32:03,380 --> 04:32:07,860
I pulled the justice in reverse. I pulled the magician in reverse and I pulled the lovers upright

2562
04:32:08,100 --> 04:32:10,100
Okay

2563
04:32:14,260 --> 04:32:16,260
Hi boomy

2564
04:32:20,500 --> 04:32:23,940
So we already talked about justice just dishonesty and unfairness

2565
04:32:24,820 --> 04:32:26,820
She be you're gonna make me cry

2566
04:32:27,780 --> 04:32:29,780
magician um

2567
04:32:30,100 --> 04:32:35,940
Represents manipulation unfulfilled potential scattered energy wasting resources illusions out of touch deception

2568
04:32:36,900 --> 04:32:41,380
Uh, I love the magician's card. That's my favorite card. This is my favorite card of everything

2569
04:32:42,180 --> 04:32:44,180
um

2570
04:32:44,260 --> 04:32:46,340
I've been told I am represented by the magician

2571
04:32:46,900 --> 04:32:53,380
So this being a reverse I feel like I'm really focused on the scattered energy and wasting resources

2572
04:32:53,460 --> 04:32:56,740
Maybe I think I think it's telling me I'm wasting resources

2573
04:32:58,980 --> 04:33:02,740
Having a mentality and like trying to make people like me

2574
04:33:04,180 --> 04:33:05,620
um

2575
04:33:05,700 --> 04:33:10,260
Because and like it was unfulfilled potential like I have a lot of unfulfilled potential

2576
04:33:10,820 --> 04:33:16,340
Manipulation people are manipulating things so that things can't come to be so I feel like it's stuff out of my control

2577
04:33:18,260 --> 04:33:20,580
Um and people are yeah people are out of touch

2578
04:33:24,580 --> 04:33:26,580
Me was real she is

2579
04:33:27,780 --> 04:33:31,780
Soon she be hates you and didn't have to be when she says otherwise. Um

2580
04:33:35,700 --> 04:33:37,700
Hello

2581
04:33:43,780 --> 04:33:50,740
Can you move your tail? Okay. Bye. Um, then the lovers popped up which is positive. Um

2582
04:34:01,300 --> 04:34:03,940
Sorry, I'm trying to ball my eyes out. Um

2583
04:34:06,340 --> 04:34:12,660
So you have divine love deep soul connection choice harmony relationships value alignment unions balance unity romance

2584
04:34:14,740 --> 04:34:16,740
It's us

2585
04:34:21,700 --> 04:34:23,940
Make shorts of my cats. Yeah

2586
04:34:27,060 --> 04:34:29,880
Uh, well, you guys have to clip it and then I'll make shorts of my cats

2587
04:34:30,280 --> 04:34:39,480
My mom got sage from book simile and a bird in our house really only folks have lived in our house

2588
04:34:39,640 --> 04:34:42,840
That's great, but stuff can still come into your house and attach themselves to you

2589
04:34:42,920 --> 04:34:47,960
So it's just good for like if people forget sage is like antibacterial properties

2590
04:34:49,480 --> 04:34:51,480
um

2591
04:34:51,560 --> 04:34:56,200
Yes, I think this is you embracing me and telling me everything will be okay

2592
04:34:59,880 --> 04:35:01,880
Um

2593
04:35:04,680 --> 04:35:06,680
And I think this is telling me that

2594
04:35:10,840 --> 04:35:17,640
There will be like unity there will be people will align their values with us

2595
04:35:19,640 --> 04:35:24,520
Unions will happen as in like friendships. I feel like this also means like I'll

2596
04:35:25,400 --> 04:35:27,400
deeply connect with people

2597
04:35:28,280 --> 04:35:30,280
At least a handful of people

2598
04:35:30,920 --> 04:35:32,360
that I meet

2599
04:35:32,360 --> 04:35:35,320
In collabs. I'm already deeply connected to scrawny

2600
04:35:38,760 --> 04:35:40,760
Me was next

2601
04:35:43,000 --> 04:35:45,960
Um, I'm like a compilation every time he's helping me

2602
04:35:48,760 --> 04:35:51,160
Oh, I think it was a big hug from harem

2603
04:35:52,520 --> 04:35:55,880
I was supposed to be ending stream. Why am I still here?

2604
04:35:56,840 --> 04:35:58,840
I'm gonna cry off stream. That's what I'm gonna do

2605
04:36:04,680 --> 04:36:07,800
I haven't pulled cards in a very long time, so this is very interesting

2606
04:36:14,600 --> 04:36:16,600
Try not to laugh

2607
04:36:16,920 --> 04:36:18,920
Thank you, mima. Thank you, mima

2608
04:36:20,520 --> 04:36:22,520
You mentioned she already got you hooked

2609
04:36:23,240 --> 04:36:29,480
Yeah, it's been it's been a while since I said it was ending. I can write into shiori

2610
04:36:31,560 --> 04:36:33,560
Crying all by yourself beautiful

2611
04:36:39,240 --> 04:36:43,880
When is shiori streaming, you know what fucking I'll stream I'll rate shiori

2612
04:36:45,240 --> 04:36:47,400
I'm not even following shiori on twitter

2613
04:36:48,520 --> 04:36:50,520
I can't do it. No, I can't

2614
04:36:50,840 --> 04:36:53,960
I'm too shy. I'm too shy to follow people

2615
04:36:55,960 --> 04:36:57,960
No

2616
04:37:05,800 --> 04:37:12,120
The ai thing is probably going shebe is crying as she's trying to fight the urge to raid shiori

2617
04:37:12,120 --> 04:37:15,720
Because she looks up to her and a lot of the hololive girls so much

2618
04:37:16,040 --> 04:37:20,360
That it terrifies her if they ever looked her way or liked her tweet. She'd have a heart attack

2619
04:37:21,000 --> 04:37:23,000
Wow

2620
04:37:38,120 --> 04:37:40,280
She streams at 10 p.m. I can't do that

2621
04:37:43,080 --> 04:37:45,080
Wait, no

2622
04:37:51,080 --> 04:37:56,280
I don't even know what her next stream is

2623
04:37:59,720 --> 04:38:01,720
What does it say

2624
04:38:03,480 --> 04:38:05,480

04:38:07,720 --> 04:38:11,240

2626
04:38:11,720 --> 04:38:21,160
So she's not streaming she's not streaming

2629
04:38:34,920 --> 04:38:36,920

04:38:39,720 --> 04:38:42,360
Get automatically loaded the picture of the turtle

2632
04:38:49,960 --> 04:38:55,320

I'm so anxiety-ridden right now. I'm just full of anxieties

2635
04:39:35,320 --> 04:39:37,320
Yeah, that's snapping turtle

2636
04:39:39,320 --> 04:39:45,560
No, it's like you guys are the what's important about relationships is that you want to be in a relationship

2637
04:39:52,360 --> 04:39:54,760
I'd hurt her squeak um

2638
04:39:56,280 --> 04:40:02,280
The thing about relationships is you want to be with someone that makes you a better person and pushes you outside your comfort zone

2639
04:40:03,240 --> 04:40:05,000
Uh

2640
04:40:05,000 --> 04:40:07,880

04:40:11,320 --> 04:40:15,000
Just getting viewers in the chat cheering on the streamer madame and encouraging her to do something

2643
04:40:15,000 --> 04:40:19,080
She's been talking about on stream. Some viewers think it'll be happen while others are doubtful

The time is of that

2652
04:40:58,360 --> 04:41:01,800
In two hours, I cannot last that long emotionally

2653
04:41:12,760 --> 04:41:16,360

She's really cool because she had like literally the same kind of um

2668
04:42:47,880 --> 04:42:51,720
I said it goes my p.l. So I was really cool. I liked it a lot

2669
04:43:05,160 --> 04:43:12,120
She has 6.6 k people watching her and you expect me to raid her

2670
04:43:14,200 --> 04:43:16,200
My god

2671
04:43:17,480 --> 04:43:19,480
I

2672
04:43:22,520 --> 04:43:27,880
Hope I don't pop up as someone who subscribed because that makes me shy. What is she playing?

2673
04:43:30,840 --> 04:43:32,840
Oh

2674
04:43:39,320 --> 04:43:41,320
Her model looks so great

2675
04:43:47,720 --> 04:43:49,720
I can't do it

2676
04:43:57,000 --> 04:44:02,040
Coney may have is playing Alden ring I read it may be the other day rena's sleeping

2677
04:44:07,240 --> 04:44:09,240
Maybe Connie

2678
04:44:11,640 --> 04:44:15,320
Give some love to the idle girls because they're going through all some stuff

2679
04:44:17,080 --> 04:44:23,160
Yeah, I'm trying to raid people outside of

2680
04:44:24,520 --> 04:44:26,520
Um

2681
04:44:38,200 --> 04:44:40,200
I should blame

2682
04:44:41,720 --> 04:44:42,920
Viewers react to cody's reaction

2683
04:44:42,920 --> 04:44:47,000
She plays a horror game. They're joking with the dog not being scared making no of the funko pops in the house

2684
04:44:52,920 --> 04:44:56,280
I thought Connie wasn't wearing a shirt for a second

2685
04:44:59,240 --> 04:45:01,240
And she goes

2686
04:45:02,520 --> 04:45:04,520
