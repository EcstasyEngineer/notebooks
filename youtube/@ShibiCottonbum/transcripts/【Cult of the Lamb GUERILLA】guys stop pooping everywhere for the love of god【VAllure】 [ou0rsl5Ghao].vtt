You're all repeating yourselves. All right, fuck that bird

31:28.300 --> 31:32.140
But I took off the really annoying ones like just kill me right before a boss

31:33.500 --> 31:39.680

Relic beast I see she must have seen so though creation because destruction

33:30.220 --> 33:36.860
Hatched as we were in the bosom of the last first gods to bestow godly instruments and yet never wield them ourselves as these are demands

33:37.340 --> 33:40.620
Some place I feel darkness something with me now in the belly of some great beastie

At least I have the breakable ones like a lot of stone this way

49:53.580 --> 49:58.220
Hey, I need to go by I need to sell stuff. I need to get more tarot cards

49:59.740 --> 50:02.940
One of my pet peeves is what people call tarot cards tarot cards

50:12.540 --> 50:14.540
Although I get it

50:15.820 --> 50:19.580
Oh, he gave me divine blast back or something else. I don't know what that was

50:23.260 --> 50:25.260
What is the relic I need to

50:27.260 --> 50:29.260
I never completed that last time I played

50:34.060 --> 50:41.100
I looked that up one of you guys can look that up for me. What the relic kudai is asking about

50:41.100 --> 50:56.140
Okay, okay, do you know tarot is not a game

50:58.060 --> 51:03.660
Just so you know don't recommend treating tarot as a game

51:03.900 --> 51:10.620
Because you can do accidentally do some fucked up shit if you do that

51:12.780 --> 51:15.740
There's someone who is knowledgeable about reading tarot cards

51:21.500 --> 51:25.820
Watch 100% get rid of any more relics. I'm gonna go this way. Maybe the relic is over here

51:34.220 --> 51:36.220
Oh

51:37.260 --> 51:39.820
Why did you just I didn't even press anything you just stopped talking

51:48.780 --> 51:50.780
All right

51:53.180 --> 51:56.860
Fuck oh I need more money

51:59.580 --> 52:01.580
God damn it

52:04.540 --> 52:06.540
God damn it

52:16.220 --> 52:20.140
It's a follower meet because I want to be able to do the thing where we can eat each other

52:23.180 --> 52:29.420
All right, let me just look that up real quick. Yeah, don't treat weija weija

52:31.420 --> 52:33.420
Ouija boards

52:34.460 --> 52:36.460
Weija Ouija

52:38.060 --> 52:43.740
Ouija you're Ouija. Um, it's a cavey that guy because you'll just invite some fucked up shit into your home

52:48.940 --> 52:51.420
What is kudai

52:53.020 --> 52:55.020
Not kudai

52:58.460 --> 53:00.460
Why is a pee

53:01.580 --> 53:03.580
Uh cult

53:03.660 --> 53:05.660
Oh

53:30.380 --> 53:32.380
Okay interesting

53:34.540 --> 53:41.340
Uh, yes, I actually I can read tarot. Um, I liked doing tarot card readings

53:42.540 --> 53:49.660
When I was a priestess in another life, I did a lot of occult stuff. I did a lot of occult research for people. I um

53:51.980 --> 53:53.980
Uh

53:54.300 --> 53:56.300
Like I did like the pagan

53:57.900 --> 53:59.500
Uh

53:59.500 --> 54:04.860
Pagan roots of like holidays every time there was a holiday. I did a video on it. They'll just I mean stream on it

54:05.820 --> 54:07.820
It's really fun

54:09.020 --> 54:11.020
I'll probably only do that though

54:11.980 --> 54:16.780
When I do it with emmy because I just feel like I wouldn't fit my content if I did it

54:16.780 --> 54:21.740
I'm also like that's any content. There's a lot of reasons why people thought I was gonna be emmy because she was the occult one

54:25.500 --> 54:27.500
I'll give me some rocks

54:29.820 --> 54:38.300
Yeah, tarot's before yes, uh, come on. No, Sarah as well. Yeah, one day. Maybe a collab with emmy

54:40.300 --> 54:42.300
I remember tarot in a while

54:45.660 --> 54:51.340
The last time I remember tarot for myself was before I got accepted into Bueller

54:51.340 --> 54:53.340
I

55:15.260 --> 55:17.660
I will always die to these things no matter what

55:18.540 --> 55:23.100
There was a way to be like spawning that type of monster you would guys would just fuck me the entire time

55:23.900 --> 55:27.580
Um how to fate super no, I don't know. I kind of like my

55:29.180 --> 55:31.420
My area of attack one when I go back to the other one

55:34.220 --> 55:36.300
Tarot like most of these were occult stuff in the west

55:37.740 --> 55:40.380
French tarot, uh, I feel like

55:40.460 --> 55:47.660
I've never heard of french tarot to be honest with you unless it's just like in french culture to use tarot like the

55:47.660 --> 55:49.660
because the writer, writer waits tarot

55:53.100 --> 55:55.100
To use that for

55:57.500 --> 56:02.540
Just like every day because some people just like do stuff in their day to day just to um

56:03.660 --> 56:08.620
It's like predictions like or just for advice. So I wouldn't be surprised if like the fucking french do that

56:10.700 --> 56:14.300
It sounds like a french thing to do

56:20.700 --> 56:23.820

56:48.220 --> 56:50.220
Uh, but also in like

56:50.540 --> 56:52.540
I feel like a lot of like native cultures

56:53.020 --> 56:55.020
Tarot is used as a divination tool

56:55.580 --> 56:58.620
Um, I when I would do streaming with tarot

56:58.620 --> 57:02.940
I would usually just recommend if you didn't believe in it or you feel comfortable with it

57:02.940 --> 57:05.340
You can use it as a reflection or introspection tool

57:07.660 --> 57:14.140
That would be the little oh those cards. Yeah, I've not used those cards before

57:14.860 --> 57:23.260
Because I'm always like you can do you don't have to believe in what it is. We can just have fun

57:23.660 --> 57:26.940
See what it has to say and then 99 percent of the time

57:27.580 --> 57:29.580

Well, I can replicate her accent is just getting the pitch right

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.700
In her cadence because she tends to draw out her

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.100
Her words like she's constantly thinking

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.860

In front of my apartment and there is a father outside

Pushing his kids in a stroller

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:59.180
And then he lets them go down the hill and he runs behind and then he runs forward to push it

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:05.020
He's like doing a workout with his kids in the stroller and I was his all I saw was a stroller going backwards towards the road

It's not a busy road, but I was like what the fuck

Okay, so I can get five or again. Oh, yeah, I'll do that that actually

01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:53.260

01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:27.580
I didn't mean to do that

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:34.140
I literally just need lumber that's all I need in this world

01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:42.300
I really don't feel like going to dark wood. I don't know if that should just let the tree grow

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.980
Uh, yeah, there's really nothing I can do to

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:53.340

Coolio all right, excuse me mushroom dude

02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:09.900
Oh

02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:20.060
I was saying like the what do you buy it because I was watching I've been watching gamecrumbs play through um

02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:23.100
resident evil

02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:28.780
Eight and the duke was like making the reference to resident evil floor going what do you buy it?

02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:31.820
And I was just like

02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:34.300
Okay, uh

02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:40.780
Some of you guys might get sick. It's fine though. Don't worry about it late 5% chance

02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:03.980
Great

02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.740
Okay, we're gonna go darkwood

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:24.140
Sorry I'm more so focusing on

02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:28.540
Building stuff and building resources

02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:35.180
I'll probably play a little bit of this off stream when I say a little I'll probably end up like beating two bosses

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.660
Oh, hey

02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:55.100
Oh, it's uh, Voldemort was kidding around us the world creaks and turns before it stood immobile motionless sentries go frost

02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:57.340

Unless she has fallen hair upon the inhabitant of the sand together fight to new to presume power

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:04.860
You shall not find them so easily dispatched again

02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:11.820
Ah fun

02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:15.340
My least favorite combo

02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:18.940
Or would rock was young what?

02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:27.340
Ah

02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:39.740

02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:44.780
It's time to pop up

02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:57.100
Oh

02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:27.100

Hi, shimmy. It's me again fun time Freddy and welcome to the cult of the lamb. Well, I'm here. See what happens next

02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:34.140
Let's find out and see

02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:38.220
I love it

02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:40.300
I love it so much

02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:43.180
I'm gonna make a pb and j real quick

02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:47.580
You guys can hear me talk

02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:51.180
Hello

02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:58.060
How does it get crowded like

02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:01.100
I don't even think that's your thing

02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:06.220
There's paint on bottom here

02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:08.940
Okay, I hope my brother's a pony

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:30.380
He are safe

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.540
I toast the bread

02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:40.220
Usually I toast my breath around pb and j's

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:43.580
then

02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:46.060
We're super human in old school

02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:50.140
That one does

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.260
Right

02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:55.980
I'm being surrounded by cats

02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:15.020
I'm thinking I beat a cat heck it

02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:19.020
Um

02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:25.340
I'm getting a wave at 8 3

02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:31.820
Moving into peanut butter and can't eat it

02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:40.700
Catch crab with light

02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:42.940
What's that? Oh no

02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:57.980
No, it's not good pb and j though or is the sandwich in general unless you cut it diagonally

02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:02.780
It's a diagonal

02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:08.460
I don't even know if you guys can hear me

02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:25.500
I

02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:31.020
Prefer raspberry preserves

02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:35.580
Bounds of tartness and speed

02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:42.140
But if there's no raspberry preserves, I will just get strawberry jam

02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:45.820
I really don't like grape jump or create flavor thing

02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:47.820
I

02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:55.180
Don't think you like grape kind of like is that honest kids grape juice

02:10:56.860 --> 02:11:00.540
Doesn't taste like okay, I could later for pre-sum

02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.260
I'm not a grape soda kind of gal either

02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:18.780
I

02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:47.980
I

02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:56.780
Whoa that emo red riding hood

02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:01.900
Precisely

02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:13.180
It's not a phase chat it's not a phase

02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:18.780
I'm eating pb and j

02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:37.980
Okay, everyone settle down settle down

02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.380
I don't want you guys to get crazy and wild

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:44.860
But please don't spoil the cult the lambs story. I don't want the story to get spoiled. Okay, you got it freddie

02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:47.260
No spoilers here

02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:59.420
Um, it's a phase connect. Um, it is whole green bread

02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:09.820
It's a lifestyle

02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:14.060
There's a story to the game totally

02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:21.980
It's the the gods and the cult. Yep

02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:32.300
Yeah, it's like the like 10 seed whole grain

02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:47.820
How you guys doing

02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:53.820
Hanging in there while you're starving and stuff

02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:01.660
Yeah, tag your spoilers guys

02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:03.820
I

02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:17.200
Hang it on cool. I'm doing good

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:19.200
I

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:33.680
Be honest with you, I haven't been really that productive lately besides like streaming related stuff

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.560
So i'm like i'm trying to

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:43.200
Think tomorrow i'm on my goal to be like to do like three productive things, you know, it's my head flies away

02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.200
I

02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:48.320
So i'm like, okay

02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:52.080
Mostly as i'm like, maybe I just do just clean. I like cleaning. Cleaning's relaxing

02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.880
So I really just gotta do the dishes. That's all i'm only gonna do

02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:01.520
Um, i'm like, uh, you know, i've been putting it off going food shopping, but I need to do it

02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:08.240
Need to go food shopping. I can't keep door dashing forever. So that would be the dream

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.200
I

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:14.400
Need a bar in july before bed naughty or

02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:18.320
What

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:20.560
mods

02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.560
mods

02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:24.560
Slap his ass

02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:26.800
And tell him i'm his daddy

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:28.640
Thank you

02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:32.080
Instacart not like I need to leave my house like I definitely need to leave

02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:35.680
My house

02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:40.560
I haven't oh, I need to text my parents. I haven't talked to my parents in a long time. Well, not a long time

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:43.440
I need to text my parents as an update from yesterday

02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:46.480
So i haven't texted them and talked to them since yesterday

02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:54.480
Remember I get plenty of food to imagine maybe i'll go and i'll

02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:59.120
I didn't I didn't go and see my dad. So like maybe I should go and see my dad

02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.960
Although he's out of the hospital, but no

02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:07.120
Because usually the last time it's happened he was there for like two days

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:12.320
But they usually kind of got down to a science what they got to do for him

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:16.960
Stand up and be your own mom

02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:19.680
Now my mods mods are locked in they there

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:22.960
To live far not too far

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:25.360
Not too far

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:27.760
But uh, yeah

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.960
Yeah, just just a weird thing that happens to him sometimes

02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.960
But um

02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:41.120
Who's it called what tactic are you something cardio

02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:46.320
Inflation around the heart i'm like blinking because i'm tired

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.680
Around the heart sack

02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:08.720
Our carditis thank you. I'm like they're a cardium. I'm like that's the lining but what's the what's the thing

02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:15.760
Mom's take his reactions. No, he's good. He's good

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:20.960
Although like I said, I haven't heard from them since yesterday, but

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.920
Again, usually only takes like a day or two for him to leave. So I'm just assuming that to be honest with you

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:31.040
I could be a really shitty daughter sometimes

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.960
And they'll stay up

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:37.440
They call my grandparents

02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:40.320
Like yeah, how are you? I'm like, uh

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:43.120
I'm all right

02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:45.760
I'm just like I just don't like talking to people

02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:50.080
If we don't we're gonna cover this over. Yeah

02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:55.760
It's like I just I tend to overreact for stuff because I'm a very emotional person

02:17:56.560 --> 02:17:59.600
And that's why my mom tries to like tell me stuff and like let's me down easy

02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:02.080
Whatever the the thing is

02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:05.600
Um, she's just like I don't want you to panic because I'm like

02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:11.440
I just tend I'm just like very worried very attached to my mom and my dad

02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:17.120
Being the only child and shit, but actually let me text

02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.760
So

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:50.860
You know, it's really funny know how I told you guys that my

02:18:56.240 --> 02:18:58.240
Extra cat because you're supposed to only have two

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:03.360
I said like the whole cat setting thing and they haven't even responded to me. I'm like

02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:11.360
So you threaten me and then you wait like a couple days to like tell me if I need to make any adjustments to my friend or anything

02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:13.520
Like what the fuck

02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:15.760
Come on

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:17.760
Let's be real

02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:24.960
All right, well, you'll see you you'll see if you ask my mom is still say

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:32.480
What's that thing where you're like or where like you overreact a lot stuff? Is it like hysterics your hysterics?

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:38.400
When you overreact to stuff

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:50.480

It's a Hispanic man this google ai thing is so fucking stupid. What is the word?

02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:09.360

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:19.120
React not overreach

02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:27.840
No, it's not borderline personality disorder

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.520
Okay, I give up

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:44.000

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.080
Especially about birds

02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:37.440
Or or gardening. She's there

02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:40.400
She's having a great time

02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:44.240
In cult of the lamb you must defeat all the bosses on your path and what you're there

02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:46.560
You might confront the one who weighs what?

02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:49.440
Freddy no spoilers

02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.160
Freddy

02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:59.280
Goodness gracious ready

02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:03.120
My tracking is not that good because I'm in the dark

02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:13.600
You know what is a show? Oh, I'm sorry. No a movie. I haven't seen her favorite flower. Um

02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:21.760
Dahlia to Dahlia

02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:24.000
Then she likes peonies

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Although it was really funny because when she first started gardening she's called them peonies and I'm like mom

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.360
It's called a peony. She's like a peony. I'm like peony

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:34.560
She likes yeah, she likes Dahlia's and uh peonies

02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:38.960
And then

02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:40.960
My what's my dad's favorite flower?

02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.200
It's not foxglove

02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:48.320
I think my dad's just like

02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:55.520
I'd probably say like the shrubs that we we helped pull out. He'd be like, yeah, I did that one. That's that's the one I like

02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:59.280
No, it's not pronounced peony

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:04.160
It was really cool though. I got to help her plant Dahlia's

02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:06.000
um

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.440
She's been working on like like a vegetable garden and just like

02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:13.280
You know, like when you hear someone just be like super passionate

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
We'll something they oh

02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:20.480
I thought mercy died. I was really nervous. Um, super passionate about something

02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:22.320
I

02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:24.320
Love this like listening to my mom

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:28.560
Yeah, and her eyes light up when she talks about like making her vegetable garden

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:32.000
And like all the stuff she's gonna cook with it and it just makes me so happy

02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:38.800
She is doing something that she loves and like that's like what v-tubing is for me, but I kind of wish I also had

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:42.640
What the hell

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:47.600
Um

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.600
But I wish I had

02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.320
Like another hobby

02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:55.040
Like maybe like an outdoors one

02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:00.960
Or like a more active one because like it was really cool doing jujitsu, but after

02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:07.360
I got like could like having fibro and stuff and they're on fire this in my neck. Although I'm like

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:11.360
fucking young at age 56. Um

02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:16.880
I just I couldn't do it anymore because it was just painful

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:19.680
It was such a good full body workout

02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:26.000
And it's usually what happens to people like I got injured and I can't train

02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:32.640
It was cool though, I went to my old school and I watched people get um promoted to belts

02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:36.720
I'm like wow, they'll never be me

02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:40.240
It is like I hadn't been so passionate about something

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.280
So sucks when the source things happens

02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:46.080
Uh, I was Brazilian jujitsu

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:49.120
I

02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:58.880
There's this one dude, um, you remember how I told you that I accidentally put one of my um

02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:03.760
Like spar sparring partners to sleep so

02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:09.920
Mind you he didn't tap like if it was if he tapped

02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.600
Then

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.160
I wouldn't have I would have let up, you know

02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:20.640
He never tapped he just like went to sleep and it's not like he didn't couldn't tap

02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:24.720
He could have easily tapped

02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:30.800
But um, so his friend

02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:37.200
His friend, um

02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:41.760
Bumi what are you saying?

02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:45.200
Put me in a

02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:47.520
Uh

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:52.560
To lock and just fucking cranked my ankle

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:59.280
And he was like and then I had to tap during our our spar and it fucking hurt so bad

02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:01.360
My ankle was swollen

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.440
He's like that was putting putting that kid to sleep

02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:08.640
And I'm like you're a fucking piece of shit. You're lucky that you're better than me or I put you in the ground

02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:11.600
Um because he was a blue belt

02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:15.520
And I also fucking hated him because every time I rolled with him you just smelled like fucking cum

02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:19.520
I'm like who sweats and they smell like this. It's like so gross

02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:28.960
And at that time I was the only girl in my class because the the girls they used to I used to train with stopped going and I was like, come on

02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:40.960
Like I can put you I can probably put like an unexperienced person in a holds

02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:43.040
um

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:45.040
like I remember um

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:47.840
Salem one of my best friends, um, she

02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:54.560
I was like showing her some moves and so I put her in a rear naked chokehold in the middle of our store

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:58.400
In a retail store that we worked at and she just let out the like the most like

02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:02.720
The most cute and funny scream because she's a high-pitched voice. She was like

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:05.360
Like she sounded like fucking r2d2

02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:08.480
It was so funny

02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:11.520
And um

02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:14.560
Come here squirrel

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:21.760
So like for her it was it was easy. Oh sweet. I think it would um, let's see

02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:25.120
I don't know

02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:27.120
This way because I think we have what a second time

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:31.440
This is french perfume, but like I had never

02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:36.160
Experienced that because like being in gym class with people from school

02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:39.120
um

02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:44.640
Like or the other guys that I would roll with I'm just like why the fuck do you smell like

02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:47.840
Nutt

02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:50.960
Like that's so fucking gross

02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:01.360
Like

02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:03.840
Like like you know how like people have like pheromones

02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:08.560
And stuff and like sometimes when you sweat you smell good

02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:12.080
Like

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:14.560
I've had people certain people tell me like I um

02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:18.880
When I sweat I smell good. I remember like reading that right now. What are you doing?

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:24.160
She's like on my lap that if you like have something that's like someone's like sweating and they smell good to you

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:26.880
you're like

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:31.120
You know, you're like genetically pre-disposed to want to like be with them or something

02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:35.600
Uh, it was a mix of gi and no gi

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:41.280
Um, we were doing that when I was rolling with them, then we were we were doing um

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:44.080
I don't know if it was up

02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:47.600
We were doing a gi and we were trying a collar

02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:52.880
Collar submissions

02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.200
My favorite was

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.240
Doing a bow and arrow choke

02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:02.080
You start the last time

02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:04.240
I got the money for it. We're not

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
You

02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:14.960
Don't think you feel like dislikes anyone sweat smell. Well, that means that you know, I guess you're genetically pre-disposed like those people

02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:25.120
Someone if you means like I think it's like I remember reading that like if someone smells good to you that

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:30.240
You would have you would have it's because they're like genetically

02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:33.040
healthy

02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:35.040
To your mind and you want to

02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:37.920
appropriate with them

02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:42.160
Some creates strong babies very like

02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:45.440
Basic instincts come here bird

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:53.920
Yeah, something to do the microbiome immune system. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Like it's like, oh, I if you smell bad

02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:56.480
You like must be sickly or like you're just disgusting

02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:02.720
Forgive me. She forgive me. She be chat. I accidentally spoiled the story. That was very not cool

02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:08.400
I said too much. I'm sorry. Don't want to spoil it again. No more spoilers. No, it's all right, freddy

02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:12.480
We forgive you freddy. Don't worry about it. I'm as happy you're here freddy

02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:25.760
Oh, it explains a lot my teacher demonstrated it bow and bow and arrow on me and this is so it's so fun to do

02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:28.400
I just drive my fucking knees into the person's back

02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:33.920
To create a large brood

02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:37.920
Yes, a large brood

02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:47.680
Oh, it's not really I need like one more flower thing

02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:49.680
I

02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:59.520
Am I here rain and plowing because she's right next to the mic. Oh, hello

02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:03.760

02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:07.680
So I started blasting. I think I'm fine. I think I'm good

02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:15.200
Oh

02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:20.560
Yeah

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:38.640
Yeah, I think for me smell is like a

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:43.920
Very big thing to me because of big your breath smells. I don't want you anywhere near me

02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:47.920
You got the helitosis stay the walk away from me bud

02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:55.120
Like I remember having customers and like such like I had one guy that I could smell his breath

02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:57.600
from like

02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:59.600
Five feet away. It was bad out

02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:16.720
I think didn't go off

02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:27.200
Like helped you get into dumb of nature it really did though because like

02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:31.280
It was a really good like if

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.880
I always recommend if you like have anger issues or something

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.160
Going to the gym or like doing a contact sport

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:42.400
Is so

02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:45.360
satisfying

02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:47.520
because I would like

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:49.840
I would just be like so

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:52.720
angry and pent up and like fucking depressed and then

02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.480
I would just go and beat up dudes like it was so great. It was so awesome

02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:00.480
I

02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:11.040
Was just super satisfied and it also was just like super

02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:16.800
Empowering in a way because like I knew I like if course came just

02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:21.840
Fucking rain. I just stepped on my nipple. Holy shit. Oh my god claw just

02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:25.280
Essentially just pierced my nipple

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:31.440
Oh

02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.640
Oh, not you guys

02:36:56.960 --> 02:36:58.960
Oh, not you guys

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Especially mixed with the fucking bats

02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:28.960
What's why did you have to spawn more?

02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:44.400
Uh, I was not paying attention. Oh, fuck me

02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.760
Thanks guys accidents do happen a lot. I'm just gonna let the story narrate itself. See you guys later. Bye freddy

02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:56.560
Stay fun time

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.800
Yeah, it's just like you're just like a good type of tired

02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.000
after

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Um doing jiu-jitsu

02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:14.240
Because one I like I like jiu-jitsu because it was I was almost like fucking

02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:18.480
Being in the military because he got into practice like discipline and respect

02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:21.280
Um with restraint

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:28.800
Oh, let's see how they are doing. I kind of want to get a grand shelter

02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:45.200
I'm gonna get this fucking propaganda speakers. I'm gonna get a grand shelter. Oh, wait, no, I want to do the one that

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
I

02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:01.520
Although like I remember like my dad was trying to teach me how to deadlifts because my dad deadlifts um

02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:09.120
And that was pretty cool, too. Like it was super satisfying. I only did it like once though because it wasn't

02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:13.200
As satisfying as like laying a sport was

02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:32.480
Yeah, you are best get real close and comfortable

02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:40.080
Also, I don't know if it's the same in the u.s. But my gym was such an inclusive sport

02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:43.920
Yeah, like 100 it really was because I

02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:50.560
It because I could tell like some of the guys would hold back when they um sparred with me

02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:56.800
I'm gonna buy you now. Yes, fucking. Thank you. Oh my god. Thank you so much go to sleep

02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:00.480
Go to sleep

02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:03.360
Um

02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:06.320
I

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:23.120
Um, but yeah, oh as I was saying, um, oh my god, I'm gonna talk that up

02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:28.880
I would say like how am I gonna learn if you you know

02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:35.040
Don't give the same like how am I? Oh my god. How am I gonna defend might be able to like

02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:38.400
Grow as a

02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:40.560
um

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:42.720
As a participant if you don't

02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:46.160
Help me out a little bit

02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:52.240
And so then they were like, you know what? Okay. And then I would learn like what my limits are and how to hold my own

02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:55.600
and it was

02:40:55.680 --> 02:41:00.480
It was like it just leveled the playing field. The only thing that was annoying is that my tits got in the way a lot

02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:05.520
I remember I had a guy like accidentally like go for

02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:08.560
a

02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:11.360
For some grips and he like grabbed me in the boob

02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:19.120
And he was like, oh fuck. Sorry. And I'm like, huh get rekt and then I like I like did an inversion and then I just fucked him up

02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:22.080
I'm like, I don't give a shit. This isn't

02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:24.640
like

02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:29.760
It's not like it's a different situation. Like we're sparring. We're just we're just doing whatever

02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:35.520
Put his ass inside control real quick

02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:42.560
Have person to be like come at me um growing up in school. Nobody wanted to fight me

02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:45.520
Because I was one taller than everybody

02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.840
um

02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:53.280
And I it was weird like I have this weird thing where if someone

02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:59.200
Like comes at me and starts to like try to argue with me or something. I just laugh at them

02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.680
And it's probably like a nervous tick of mine, but

02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:09.760
It it seems like intimidates people is what I've been told

02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.120
Because I remember this girl came up to me. She's like, um at work and she's like

02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:22.080
One I am not like a gossipy person. I'm not. Um, I don't have the energy. I'm too fucking old for that shit

02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:24.880
It's not high school anymore

02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:28.960
And she's like, have you been talking shit about me? And I literally started

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:32.800
Hysterically laughing at her. I'm like, who the fuck told you that?

02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:36.000
If I had something to say I'd say to your fucking face

02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:42.320
And I was pissed because she's my friend and I'm like, why do you think it was because this one dude who um

02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:47.360
Had a crush on her was like trying to separate her from us from our friend group

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:50.800
He was a shitty dude

02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:53.760
Um

02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:57.520
And so and then she said afterwards like she's like it kind of freaked me out

02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:00.560
Then I'm like, sorry. Well, like

02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:04.000
You didn't have to

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:09.600
The way you approached it. The way you spoke to me was disrespectful. So I'm gonna disrespect you back, you know

02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:17.200
If you came out to be like, hey somebody told me that you said something negative about me

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:21.360
Then I'm gonna be like, what? I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. I'm the type of person that like if I hear

02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:24.960
Someone

02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:27.040
saying something negative

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:31.600
About me or some other. Oh, look at you cleaning in me. Um, me or another person

02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:34.560
I like immediately go to nip it in the butt because I'm like we're adults

02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:39.060
Fuck it out. Like we're not fucking doing this. It's fucking stupid

02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:46.260
We'll be reversal. Yeah, it's part of how wrestling isn't gay. Yeah

02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:58.100
Uh, I need gold for that. All right, I'm gonna make another

02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:02.900
Another oh, I don't have money

02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:04.900
I

02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:08.980
What will give me a lot of my gold? Oh, yeah, but

02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:16.500
Should go fishing this fishing would get me stuff

02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:21.060
It's also cotton because I don't need cotton either

02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:26.680
Nope didn't even mean to catch him

02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:35.860
I'm desperate need of that wood

02:44:38.020 --> 02:44:40.020
Game is like for a moment

02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:42.260
Look at me

02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:46.500
Oh hi, what's up?

02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:51.140
Uh, sure

02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:59.380
Yeah, I'll always I'm sorry my cat's food is going off. I

02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:02.340
I'll always stand my ground and

02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:06.500
If I don't agree with something I will speak my mind

02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:13.460
I'm not gonna really bother with these. Oh, they're a cop profiliac like some of you guys

02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:20.180
They gain faith when they fall ill while they're about to fall ill. So I'm supposed to be sickly apparently

02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:26.340
Then I can literally just

02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:31.540
Tell them

02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:35.620
Pass out on the ground that's so funny

02:45:42.180 --> 02:45:44.180
Yeah, I think like I was

02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:50.660
When I was younger I was very much a push over

02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:55.700
And I my mom always said that I was a follower and I wasn't a leader

02:45:57.300 --> 02:45:59.300
um

02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:04.100
Because I would have really bad friends that would like

02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:10.260
Take my money and I'd be like, yeah, it's fine or just like I just wouldn't be able to stand it for myself and then

02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:16.500
Growing up. I just eventually learned to do so really like working at um

02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:19.780
The retail store was a

02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:27.140
Very big dose of reality for me because after growing up so sheltered

02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:30.100
Um and like

02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:35.460
Experiencing the real world with people and like

02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:42.980
The drama and all that other shit and I'm like wait a second like I don't even

02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:48.180
I don't have to I don't have to have this reaction. I don't have to act this way

02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:51.380
I don't have to do this. I don't have to do that. I don't have and I did it was like

02:46:51.620 --> 02:46:54.820
Just releasing all that shit and just being like, oh

02:46:55.700 --> 02:46:58.580
Wow, and this like the stress off my shoulders

02:47:00.020 --> 02:47:03.220
It was very nice. Um, I should probably refine some stuff

02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:15.620
Good night. Good night

02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:23.300
I have bushes and machines to see. Yeah, of course. Good night. Yeah, that's nine

02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:28.660
Probably gonna go see if I can kill the cat and I'll probably go to bed myself

02:47:32.980 --> 02:47:39.060
See, can I upgrade? No, I need to wait for that. Oh, you mean the fucking scarecrow

02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:47.780
How am I supposed to how am I supposed to fit these motherfuckers?

02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:51.540
How much space does he take up? He takes up one

02:47:52.420 --> 02:47:54.420
Um

02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:56.580
Then I could

02:47:57.140 --> 02:47:59.140
Actually

02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:03.460
I'm gonna kind of fuck myself but just

02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:07.380
Get rid of that

02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:11.060
Uh

02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:19.300
What we guys are stinking up the place

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:26.260
Perfect

02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:34.100
And

02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:37.300
Ten of that

02:48:39.140 --> 02:48:41.940
That's my cat's food. Take forever. I don't want to go off

02:48:46.340 --> 02:48:48.340
Only do the first one

02:48:49.220 --> 02:48:51.220
Can I take you a while brother?

02:48:55.780 --> 02:49:00.020
Don't know their stone place. I really like I don't usually like like, um

02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:02.740
Um

02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:05.780
Like management stuff, but I really like

02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:10.260
I didn't miss game for some reason. I need money

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:26.340
I still don't have money

02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:32.020
I

02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:46.740
Need a burp to drop the lurkers. Yeah, no, I know I was gonna be like pretty chill today. So I'm not

02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:50.180
Don't worry about that stuff

02:49:52.980 --> 02:49:55.860
Just chill kind of just want to like

02:49:56.820 --> 02:49:58.820

02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:34.500

02:50:44.660 --> 02:50:47.620
Like that's I think that's um

02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:53.940
That's something

02:50:53.940 --> 02:50:55.300
I've

02:50:55.300 --> 02:51:00.020
realized I enjoy a lot about like some friendships that I've had is like being able to

02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:08.740
Um kind of just hang out with someone and not have to say a word

02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:11.780
Like when you just can be comfortable in the silence

02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:16.820
Um in a friendship it's a very

02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:20.180
Little thing, you know

02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:28.260

Do I have enough yet because I want to make the uh

02:52:05.860 --> 02:52:08.420
Farmer plot where they collect it so I don't have to worry about it

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:12.820
Excuse me. Oh perfect

02:52:13.940 --> 02:52:15.940
Uh

02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:19.220
We're just gonna

02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:26.500
We're here

02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:28.500
Yep

02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:31.940
And then we're gonna

02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:33.940
Milt

02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:38.820
Oh

02:52:38.820 --> 02:52:40.900
Fuck uh, I forgot that you have to upgrade

02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:45.540
Okay, let me move that back never mind

02:52:46.500 --> 02:52:50.100
Uh, we're just gonna move it back to where it was

02:52:50.820 --> 02:52:54.660
And then we're gonna upgrade it

02:53:01.860 --> 02:53:06.500
Companionable silence is a very far that's just a pretty way to say it. Companionable silence

02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:09.220
Having a silence with this court call is always fun

02:53:10.740 --> 02:53:12.740
I'm gonna fall asleep in a discord call

02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:17.540
Can't imagine it's like to be two with an audience. I don't want to touch for this stick

02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:23.700
Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't I don't really get that like why do you do what you do if you don't like your audience

02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:27.140
It's always confused me. You're like, oh, I hate my fan base

02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:31.140
And like when people say like chat reflects streamer, it's really true you

02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:32.980
if you

02:53:32.980 --> 02:53:34.980
cultivate

02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:39.940
A certain fan bait like if you cultivate or have this sort of certain personality

02:53:40.900 --> 02:53:43.140
You're gonna why are you guys fighting? Um

02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:46.340
It's gonna reflect on chat and chat's gonna act a certain way

02:53:46.340 --> 02:53:48.340
so it only makes sense to

02:53:48.980 --> 02:53:50.980
you know

02:53:51.540 --> 02:53:53.540
Be the type of person you want to

02:53:55.700 --> 02:53:57.540
track

02:53:57.540 --> 02:53:59.540
your streams

02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:10.180
Or is there a way to like upgrade it so like I don't have to go in collection all the time

02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:20.500
Oh so much

02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:53.780
Doesn't matter

02:57:54.100 --> 02:58:00.260
I'm not really like super hyper focused on monetization. Although I'm it's mostly just like it's a

02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:06.740
As someone who's been a v another vtuber, are you just a content creator on youtube in general?

02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:08.820
I've never been able to get monetized

02:58:09.460 --> 02:58:13.540
Like or just like be able to be part of the partner product like so that's like it's the title

02:58:13.620 --> 02:58:16.740
That's important to me. It's not like the actual like being monetized

02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:20.980
But because I'll be like it's just it's a milestone for me because I've never

02:58:21.940 --> 02:58:23.940
I've gotten that before

02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:26.740
Like the fact that I think

02:58:33.140 --> 02:58:36.580
Like I'm like I'm 10k away from 100k views on my channel

02:58:36.580 --> 02:58:40.980
Like that just like it literally makes me want to cry because I'm just like holy shit

02:58:41.700 --> 02:58:43.700
I never ever thought I would

02:58:44.660 --> 02:58:45.700
get

02:58:45.700 --> 02:58:48.740
That sort of attention in any way shape or form

02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:53.220
Ooh

02:58:53.460 --> 02:58:58.500
So it's just really cool to see the fruits of my labor

02:59:04.740 --> 02:59:10.500
No, yeah, I appreciate it. Yeah, it's like I also just want the fucking emotes like

02:59:12.580 --> 02:59:14.980
Sucks that they don't have anime emotes though

02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:17.300
I'm fast

02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:22.100
Okay, at least with these I can kill them one time. So I'm like, how am I not?

02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:33.140
I'm always sad chopping this fucking tree down

02:59:40.820 --> 02:59:42.820
Am I chopping a tree when it's a

02:59:45.940 --> 02:59:52.020
But it's a fucking hammer music. Have you ever tried to chop a tree down with a hammer?

02:59:55.220 --> 02:59:58.980
But yeah, I I appreciate the support it's been so cool. Um

03:00:00.340 --> 03:00:06.180
While I've been here a week like I've said yesterday, it feels like I've been with hanging out with you guys for longer

03:00:07.140 --> 03:00:09.140
This feels so right

03:00:15.940 --> 03:00:17.940
Oh

03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:39.860
Oh, I need 200 I forgot I needed money for that. Um, oh, I will

03:00:39.860 --> 03:00:41.860
Oh

03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:45.380
Can you go away? I'm trying to

03:00:54.660 --> 03:00:56.660
If I kill it all of them, I will happen

03:01:02.180 --> 03:01:04.180
I'm like super hold on can I say

03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:11.940
It's fine

03:01:16.340 --> 03:01:20.500
Okay, you don't really do anything to me you just you just whine about it

03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:30.660
You look more stream spirit. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it

03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:32.900
I

03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:36.420
Had any more emo ideas

03:01:36.580 --> 03:01:38.580
um, you get I don't really

03:01:39.460 --> 03:01:40.660
There's like

03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:42.660
There's one emo. I like

03:01:43.940 --> 03:01:46.500
I know I fucking like me on this channel

03:01:47.140 --> 03:01:52.180
And if you ever followed me, I feel I had a really popular emo that was just like me crying

03:01:53.220 --> 03:01:57.780
And I used to always be like what the fuck is going on and so I want to get a what the fuck is going on

03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:04.180
I also just might get like different stylized emotes

03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:11.860
Uh, let's get this wood two times coins

03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:17.540
I can just go straight. I might just go straight. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm willing right now

03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:25.380
It's finished day eight of 30 days work straight with me. What the hell? Why are you doing that to yourself?

03:02:26.340 --> 03:02:28.340
Oh

03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:33.380
Yeah, I just want to say thank you for real from the bottom of my

03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:36.980
Girlfail dom harp

03:02:38.260 --> 03:02:41.380
That you guys look want to watch me and shit. It's really cool

03:02:43.460 --> 03:02:50.520
Um, thank you for supporting the girls. Oh, perfect more food. I'm so excited

03:02:56.340 --> 03:02:58.340
Ah

03:03:10.500 --> 03:03:12.500
Oh, I think you need a different job

03:03:14.020 --> 03:03:16.020
Um, but

03:03:17.460 --> 03:03:19.460
This feels surreal to be here

03:03:20.900 --> 03:03:24.100
And I just can't wait for what

03:03:25.380 --> 03:03:27.380
Like

03:03:27.380 --> 03:03:29.780
Well, what would be like in like a month?

03:03:33.380 --> 03:03:40.820
I'm actually like really nervous about like collabs with other companies because again, I used to like watch them and now

03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:44.180
I get to just like hang out with them

03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:49.700
Um, and I'm also nervous that like people won't want to hang out with us because

03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:52.820
For content

03:03:53.140 --> 03:03:57.220
But like I'm happy that like we have like the new girls and I have

03:03:58.900 --> 03:04:00.900
some indie friends

03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:13.940
Mercy died of old age. No, okay, we're gonna resurrect mercy. Oh wait. No, fuck. I don't have the resurrect thing

03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:17.540
Um, we went with the funeral. We'll have a nice funeral for mercy

03:04:19.700 --> 03:04:21.220
Unless she gets resurrected

03:04:21.220 --> 03:04:23.620
Uh, I kind of like what I have so much of that

03:04:25.300 --> 03:04:27.300
Mercy was a hag

03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:30.740
Well, you won't see a collab with any superstitious little company for sure

03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:34.980
Well, yeah, because that'll be on them. It's up to them like like I can't

03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:44.100
Like you probably why don't there's so many stuff here with him. I've seen him like five times

03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:52.900
Sorry, I need meat from your followers. Thank you. Also, you should stop bagging up your people. It's kind of fucking weird

03:04:53.700 --> 03:04:55.700
um

03:04:57.620 --> 03:05:00.900
It's like I can be say so if I want to like

03:05:02.340 --> 03:05:04.340
The only thing that's difficult for me

03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:07.620
Is like maybe not swearing

03:05:08.580 --> 03:05:11.860
But like oh hell I literally that is like glitched. Um

03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:16.260
I

03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:18.580
Like I can do that

03:05:19.620 --> 03:05:22.900
It wouldn't be difficult and then I would just like probably get a fucking different outfit

03:05:23.700 --> 03:05:25.700
But like I also don't want to change

03:05:26.740 --> 03:05:30.500
Who I am. Oh, I was looking at chat. Um

03:05:32.100 --> 03:05:34.100
For somebody just to like me

03:05:35.940 --> 03:05:43.620
And like it's mostly as I run into that it's mostly for the um other girls

03:05:44.100 --> 03:05:47.860
Like I just I just want us to be successful and I want to go to be happy

03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:55.560
My measure success by happiness

03:06:02.980 --> 03:06:06.580
Damn, this is actually a kind of cracked thing

03:06:10.180 --> 03:06:13.540
Oh, what the fuck I'm like, please don't tell me if I'm glitched

03:06:14.820 --> 03:06:16.820
I

03:06:18.580 --> 03:06:22.580
Don't be okay. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly

03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:26.500
You guys are right

03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:46.100
I

03:07:04.100 --> 03:07:06.100
Like I was in a job interview and I said that

03:07:06.500 --> 03:07:11.060
And I'm like a measure of my success where the customer's happiness and they like laugh at me because they want me to talk about

03:07:11.300 --> 03:07:13.300
metrics, so I'm like, oh, okay

03:07:14.260 --> 03:07:16.260
Kind of want to wait

03:07:16.900 --> 03:07:18.900
No, cool down. That's gonna be take too long

03:07:23.860 --> 03:07:25.860
Hey

03:07:26.740 --> 03:07:31.460
What's up, wait a second, uh, I don't trust you guys

03:07:32.420 --> 03:07:34.420

Not trust

03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:42.740

03:07:42.740 --> 03:07:47.380
I am ending the crowd control because I'm gonna try to beat this boss and I'm gonna go

Yeah, yeah, definitely you have free my expression. She hates us. No, you hate me

03:07:55.540 --> 03:07:57.540

I don't know I can't I don't know about that

03:08:00.740 --> 03:08:02.740
Um

03:08:03.140 --> 03:08:08.260
Yeah, I think when people see like how wholesome we are we're just kind of funny and coming from like the whore the whorepo

03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:16.580
They'll just kind of be kind of put off by that like just be like confused

03:08:19.460 --> 03:08:24.260
Is like wait, they're wholesome and they're actually really fun entertainers and they're really nice people

03:08:24.420 --> 03:08:26.420
And

03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:34.500
Like like I said, it's not even for me because I I don't care, but I just want

03:08:39.300 --> 03:08:41.300
I just want

03:08:43.620 --> 03:08:46.820

Maybe I should have left it on because then you guys want to heal me

03:08:57.620 --> 03:08:59.620
So many fucking frogs

03:09:20.340 --> 03:09:22.340

Strongy was a real one

03:43:18.580 --> 03:43:25.940
I loved her deeply she was the best mom that I could ever ask for

03:43:28.980 --> 03:43:30.980
She will go and God's grace

03:43:32.740 --> 03:43:34.740
Will thrive in the heavens

03:43:36.100 --> 03:43:38.100
Farewell mother

03:43:59.300 --> 03:44:01.300

03:44:58.900 --> 03:45:03.380
I'm all prancing excitedly. What's up?

03:45:08.660 --> 03:45:11.700

I genuinely don't know like when she's I don't like like I don't know

I don't think shawty sleeps at all

03:52:17.140 --> 03:52:20.820
Because she wakes up. No, she doesn't wake up. She's just alive. She's just there

03:52:21.620 --> 03:52:23.620
And then she does so much stuff

03:52:23.620 --> 03:52:26.260
And she streams and she does more stuff. I don't think she sleeps

03:52:26.820 --> 03:52:32.740
I think she's just forever awake. She just has a superpower of being awake all the time

03:52:37.540 --> 03:52:39.540
All right

03:52:39.940 --> 03:52:41.940
