00:30.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

01:00.000 --> 01:30.000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

01:30.000 --> 02:00.000
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

02:00.000 --> 02:30.000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

02:30.000 --> 03:00.000
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

03:00.000 --> 03:30.000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

03:30.000 --> 04:00.000
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

04:00.000 --> 04:30.000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

04:30.000 --> 05:00.000
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

05:00.000 --> 05:12.980
Little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

05:12.980 --> 05:20.960
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

05:20.960 --> 05:26.200
were a suit jacket, and made a habit of replacing sleep with coffee.

05:26.200 --> 05:31.520
I had given this company a piece of my soul, only to watch my boss give his daughter the

05:31.520 --> 05:35.120
position I had dedicated all these years working towards.

05:35.120 --> 05:42.440
I wanted to scream in his skull, I wanted to cry like a child, but I couldn't.

05:42.440 --> 05:48.440
I had been completely hollow for years, but now I was at my lowest low, nothing more to

05:48.440 --> 05:55.640
strive for, nothing more to work for, nothing more to live for.

05:55.640 --> 06:01.800
I wandered the night in a daze of utter aimlessness, yet, after sinking into the dark, I soon found

06:01.800 --> 06:03.800
myself bathed in light.

06:03.800 --> 06:08.720
It was a woman whose opulent beauty contrasted my disheveled despair.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.920
Why was it then that I had caught her attention?

06:11.920 --> 06:16.720
Not of disgust or pity, but I was instead called to the front of the line in a queue

06:16.720 --> 06:19.680
of some very important looking people.

06:19.680 --> 06:24.040
Without a word, her eyes gave an invitation, and her smile brought me both comfort of her

06:24.040 --> 06:27.080
presence and the courage to follow.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.560
Before I knew it, I was tailing her like a child into a building I had no business being

06:31.560 --> 06:35.400
in, yet one she had total command of.

06:35.400 --> 06:41.480
Every respectable patron and worker there from the highest walks of life called her Queen,

06:41.480 --> 06:45.720
and the nature of that level of respect also made her Queen to me.

06:45.720 --> 06:50.360
She had said she had seen a familiar pain in me and spoke to me about an offer.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.760
Not a new job, but a new lifestyle.

06:54.760 --> 06:59.600
She had brought me to the VIP section of the building and had finally dawned on me, a fetish

06:59.600 --> 07:02.320
club for the rich and powerful.

07:02.320 --> 07:07.600
My work didn't even allow me time for dating, much less anything here.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.480
My curiosity and fear were at odds, yet Queen was understanding and familiar with my flavor

07:12.480 --> 07:13.920
of reluctance.

07:13.920 --> 07:17.720
She believed we were kindred spirits, though I couldn't see it.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.520
In display of influence, she contacted my work, securing me a paid leave in order to

07:21.520 --> 07:26.560
stay in Wonderland with complete access to all of its faculties for a week, free of

07:26.560 --> 07:27.560
charge.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.960
At the end of my stay, I would have to give my answer to join her in this wild new life,

07:31.960 --> 07:34.400
a return to mediocrity.

07:34.400 --> 07:38.040
To say I enjoyed my stay was an understatement.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.680
I was finally tasting what life's joys can offer.

07:41.680 --> 07:47.920
After the hotel amenities, spa, bars, and 5 star buffet, my curiosity eventually turned

07:47.920 --> 07:50.160
to the VIP lounge.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.200
It was there where I found myself.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.080
It was there where I found my answer.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.920
The pleasure I had never even knew I desired.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.680
The pain I had no idea I needed.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.560
This is what I deserved.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.880
I found it all here.

08:08.880 --> 08:15.280
My body was subjected to sensations and punishments my deepest imagination could never conjure.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.080
That was, until they had me dishing it out as well.

08:19.080 --> 08:23.840
After getting just a taste of this life, I knew there was no way I could turn down Queen's

08:23.840 --> 08:24.840
offer.

08:24.840 --> 08:28.000
I was now bound to this place.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.440
In my service to Wonderland, I had been transformed.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.280
In bondage, I found my freedom.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.480
Through pain, I knew pleasure.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.320
Through submission, I had found my power.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.040
Through domination, I had found my peace.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.440
I became a premier worker whose services were demanded by the highest paying clients from

08:48.440 --> 08:50.080
across the world.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.800
Top execs, actors, even politicians would line up to get their fill of welts and rope

08:54.800 --> 08:55.800
burn.

08:55.800 --> 09:00.680
I had seen more money in the first month than I'd ever seen in a year of office work.

09:00.680 --> 09:05.480
My newfound command over the sins of the flesh gained me respect of peers as well as Queen

09:05.480 --> 09:06.480
herself.

09:06.480 --> 09:11.840
We had grown close, a bit more than professionally.

09:11.840 --> 09:17.240
Despite this, even I had no idea what was to come.

09:17.240 --> 09:22.000
She never wanted us to worry, so she never told anyone of her condition.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.160
And it struck her hearts like a bolt of lightning when the time came.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.560
When she passed, the city itself seemed to stand still in respect.

09:31.560 --> 09:37.560
She had left behind a golden legacy as a saint of whips and gags, a woman who allowed those

09:37.560 --> 09:42.800
scorned by the pursuit of happiness to regain their sense of passion and power.

09:42.800 --> 09:47.800
She saw that need in me as well as my talent for it, and so did the others.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.280
So when she willed her entire empire to me, there were no objections.

09:53.400 --> 09:59.040
Thanks to her, I have attained a sense of power and family that I could have never imagined.

09:59.040 --> 10:05.080
I will make sure that Wonderland will always be a safe haven for the rejected and the hopeless.

10:05.080 --> 10:11.200
So if you feel trapped, finding yourself in a life of all pain and no pleasure, why not

10:11.200 --> 10:13.120
step by a little while?

10:13.120 --> 10:16.120
I can help you find both.

10:17.120 --> 10:22.120
Don't be nervous, sweetie.

10:22.120 --> 10:28.120
I know it's a big thing wanting to enter Wonderland.

10:28.120 --> 10:36.120
It's important to have your consent, though, because once you enter, you might realize

10:36.120 --> 10:39.120
you don't want to come back out of this little rabbit hole.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.120
So, what will it be?

10:46.120 --> 10:48.120
I don't know.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.120
Mmm, good choice.

10:57.120 --> 11:01.120
You've pleased me already and we're just getting started.

11:04.120 --> 11:09.120
Why don't I tell you a little bit more about me then?

11:17.120 --> 11:19.120
Hello.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.120
Hi there.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.120
Hello, sweetheart.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.120
My name is Evie Cottonbum.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.120
I'm your mistress and the madam of Wonderland.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.120
Did you enjoy the girl so far?

11:34.120 --> 11:37.120
I bet you enjoyed Emmy's debut.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.120
Isn't she just the cutest?

11:39.120 --> 11:43.120
Hope she didn't put too much of a spell on you.

11:43.120 --> 11:48.120
Okay, well, now you do well to behave and listen.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.120
We've got a bit to go through, so I'll just move right along.

11:51.120 --> 11:56.120
However, first things first, we're going to practice some obedience.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.120
So, I'm going to have you try something for me.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.120
Can you say ah?

12:02.120 --> 12:05.120
Ah, say ah.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.120
Or type A's in the chat.

12:09.120 --> 12:14.120
Good job.

12:14.120 --> 12:18.120
I'm so proud of you.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.120
Okay, so hold on.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.120
Let me just come and set up my desk.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.120
Just a second.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.120
I'm sorry, my people need me.

12:34.120 --> 12:39.120
Don't worry about my lack of head.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.120
I still give it good.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.120
Don't worry about it.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.120
Okay, just don't.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.120
So, yeah, I know my desk is messy.

12:46.120 --> 12:50.120
I'll clean it off later.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.120
As mentioned, my name is Sheeby,

12:52.120 --> 12:56.120
but you must refer to me as Madam or Miss Sheeby, if you like.

12:56.120 --> 13:00.120
Close confidants, call me Sheepsters.

13:00.120 --> 13:04.120
My surname may sound silly to you,

13:04.120 --> 13:09.120
but it's a known fact in my family that we have buns of steel.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.120
My last name just showcases that.

13:11.120 --> 13:17.120
I was born on September 28th, which just happens to be Bunny Day.

13:17.120 --> 13:23.120
My parents just seemed to have really gotten the timing right, I suppose.

13:23.120 --> 13:29.120
I am pretty tall in my family at 168 centimeters.

13:29.120 --> 13:35.120
That's a 5'6 in America, if you didn't know.

13:35.120 --> 13:40.120
I'm a lap and polla, otherwise known as a bunny girl.

13:40.120 --> 13:45.120
You see, I have a lovely set of floppy ears in this picture right there.

13:45.120 --> 13:49.120
I can also DJ, like, I'm just kidding.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.120
I also have a very nice cotton tail.

13:52.120 --> 13:58.120
I have the many characteristics of a rabbit, like my stamina, for example.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.120
I'm also very good at jumping and have quite the vertical.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.120
My family is mad at me, though, because I didn't pick up basketball,

14:05.120 --> 14:09.120
like a distant relative of mine.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.120
Everybody get up, it's time to slam-

14:11.120 --> 14:14.120
Okay.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.120
So, my age.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.120
That's really quite rude of you to wonder.

14:20.120 --> 14:26.120
And although I might have some motherly qualities,

14:26.120 --> 14:29.120
I'm not old enough to be your mother.

14:29.120 --> 14:34.120
As you saw in my little introductory video,

14:34.120 --> 14:36.120
I am now Queen of Wonderland,

14:36.120 --> 14:41.120
but I retired that title out of respect for the previous owner, Rest in Peace Queen.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.120
I'll go into more of what my hotel offers in the 2.0.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.120
In human languages, I only fluently know English,

14:49.120 --> 14:54.120
but pleasure doesn't really need words, does it?

14:55.120 --> 14:58.120
I'm also fluent in bun-speak,

14:58.120 --> 15:03.120
but my accent and pitch, it really only comes out if I'm excited.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.120
It sounds a bit like your animalese,

15:07.120 --> 15:11.120
but I can use it in English as well, so normally it sounds like this.

15:15.120 --> 15:20.120
But if I get really excited when I'm talking to you guys,

15:20.120 --> 15:24.120
and this is very rare, this is what I sound like.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
Okay.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.120
So, let's look at my likes in this likes,

15:29.120 --> 15:32.120
and a little bit of trivia about me.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.120
Okay.

15:38.120 --> 15:43.120
So, first of my likes, I really do enjoy a wide range of music genres,

15:43.120 --> 15:46.120
from Grunge all the way to rap.

15:46.120 --> 15:51.120
I can't sing well, but I try my best, and I just try to have fun with it.

15:51.120 --> 15:55.120
Huge fan of really any sort of techno with bass and thump,

15:55.120 --> 16:01.120
you can really feel anything that makes me move, besides country.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.120
The only good songs to come from country are Ram Ranch,

16:05.120 --> 16:07.120
and Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.120
I'm not the pickiest eater, but I do have my favorites.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.120
I love, love, love seafood.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.120
I'm a woman of opulent taste, lobster.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.120
There's probably no seafood dish I wouldn't try.

16:21.120 --> 16:26.120
My mother also always prided in how well I ate my veggies as a wee rabbit.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.120
I even like Brussels sprouts.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.120
I love pho and Spanish food as well.

16:31.120 --> 16:36.120
And I have a few junky comfort foods, like Uncrustables.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.120
I fucking love Uncrustables and puppy chow.

16:39.120 --> 16:44.120
I don't eat dog food, just full stop.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.120
It's also known as White Trash, Crack and Muddy Buddies.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.120
It's plain checks, mixed toasts, and peanut butter and chocolate,

16:50.120 --> 16:52.120
then covered in powdered sugar.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.120
I have that really rarely though, because you know,

16:56.120 --> 16:59.120
I gotta keep up this nice figure.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.120
So from my hobbies, when I'm not in the dungeon,

17:04.120 --> 17:08.120
and I mean managing the Wonderland Hotel,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.120
you can catch me reading a book,

17:10.120 --> 17:15.120
practicing my knots and gardening to name a few.

17:15.120 --> 17:18.120
As you can see, I do jiu-jitsu.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.120
One time during a jiu-jitsu class,

17:21.120 --> 17:25.120
I accidentally put a pair to sleep with just my thighs,

17:25.120 --> 17:29.120
and in a like triangle, whoopsies.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.120
I love to read fantasy novels.

17:32.120 --> 17:36.120
Any form of escapism from the bland monotony of life

17:36.120 --> 17:40.120
is enjoyable, but I do, you know,

17:40.120 --> 17:43.120
read the occasional smutty novel or two.

17:43.120 --> 17:47.120
Okay, I'll have fun to the next slide.

17:50.120 --> 17:55.120
I really enjoy horror elements in shows,

17:55.120 --> 17:57.120
or shows that make you think,

17:57.120 --> 18:00.120
but I do also like, you know, trashy entertainment.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.120
Like Love Island, I got a text.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.120
I do watch a lot of anime,

18:05.120 --> 18:08.120
but I'm probably kind of labeled like a normie for my taste.

18:08.120 --> 18:12.120
I recently watched Dungeon Mashi and Freerun, you know,

18:12.120 --> 18:15.120
also Me and All the Girlies have similar tastes.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.120
If the theme is really sci-fi or fantasy,

18:18.120 --> 18:20.120
I like it.

18:20.120 --> 18:25.120
If it's, yeah, you know, like Firefly, Stargate, Star Wars,

18:25.120 --> 18:28.120
all of it, I'm a freaking nerd.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.120
Don't tell anybody though, I have to keep up, you know,

18:31.120 --> 18:33.120
an air of mystery.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.120
Some games you'll see me play will be like meta-ish games.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.120
I love Inscription.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.120
I like Souls Likes, like Elden Ring, I like Liza P.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.120
I really want to dive into more retro games,

18:45.120 --> 18:48.120
and also like RPG story-driven games like Elder Scrolls,

18:48.120 --> 18:51.120
horror games like Alien and Amnesia,

18:51.120 --> 18:56.120
and I recently discovered I like Roguelikes' Cult of the Lamb.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.120
I'm embarrassed to admit this.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.120
I played a lot of FPS growing up like Counter-Strike 2,

19:02.120 --> 19:04.120
so I'm trying to widen my horizons.

19:04.120 --> 19:09.120
Let's just not talk about my 600 plus hours.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.120
Hehehe.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.120
Let's move to my dislikes.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
Okay, these are kind of self-explanatory.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
Don't play your music too loud.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.120
Nobody else wants to hear it.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.120
I don't like being in really large crowds.

19:22.120 --> 19:26.120
It just freaks me out post Miss Rona.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.120
I don't like when somebody disobeys me.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.120
Do not disobey me.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.120
You will not like the consequences.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.120
You may think it feels good. It won't.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.120
Hehehe.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.120
I don't like when people correct me.

19:38.120 --> 19:42.120
I'm the one giving correction.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.120
Alright.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.120
And I hate getting interrupted during any sort of playtime,

19:47.120 --> 19:51.120
and I hate when people put things in the wrong place.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.120
If it's there, I like organize chaos.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.120
Don't freaking do it.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.120
Okay.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.120
Alright, let me bring my body back real quick like

20:04.120 --> 20:06.120
so you can see this beautiful face.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.120
I bet you missed it, didn't you?

20:09.120 --> 20:11.120
Sniff.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.120
You guys smell, by the way.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
I hope you knew that.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.120
Oh!

20:16.120 --> 20:18.120
I'm so far away.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.120
Let me get a little closer to you.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.120
Why am I so freaking huge?

20:30.120 --> 20:32.120
Hehehe.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.120
Okay.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.120
I'm just going to be in the corner like this.

20:36.120 --> 20:39.120
So ironically enough, I'm allergic to rabbits.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.120
Sorry.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.120
I have INFP personality type.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.120
I'm very introverted.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.120
Surprisingly enough.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.120
After getting into our car accident,

20:47.120 --> 20:49.120
I jumped off a cliff.

20:49.120 --> 20:53.120
You'll learn more about that in the explanation as to why my 2.0.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.120
I have three kitty cats.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.120
You might have heard them in the background because they're going crazy.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.120
My little girl, big mama,

20:59.120 --> 21:01.120
and my big man.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.120
And I've met the voice of Mario.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.120
He was super freaking sweet.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.120
Sniff.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.120
We got to say let's go!

21:11.120 --> 21:12.120
Okay.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.120
So here are some of my goals.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.120
I like to be a soul's like on stream.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.120
I'd be an Elden Ring already,

21:18.120 --> 21:20.120
and I'd be in Lies of P off stream,

21:20.120 --> 21:22.120
but you know, I would like to do something with you.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.120
I would like to learn another language,

21:24.120 --> 21:26.120
because everybody else is super cool,

21:26.120 --> 21:28.120
and I'm not, and they all know other languages,

21:28.120 --> 21:30.120
so give me a suggestion.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.120
I want to have a video hit 100k views,

21:32.120 --> 21:34.120
and hit 10k subs,

21:34.120 --> 21:36.120
because if I reach those milestones,

21:36.120 --> 21:38.120
I know I'm doing something right,

21:38.120 --> 21:40.120
and that you guys are enjoying my content.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.120
So you know, I hope that you enjoy what I put out.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.120
I want to go to a convention,

21:44.120 --> 21:46.120
because it's not like they're doing it off-key right now,

21:46.120 --> 21:48.120
and be like, hey,

21:48.120 --> 21:50.120
and just try to like hit people with it.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.120
I think that'd be really fun to hit people

21:52.120 --> 21:54.120
with iPad self.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.120
I would love to release another cover.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.120
You guys will see that we have covers coming up.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.120
Mine's not good, but you know,

22:00.120 --> 22:02.120
we can try again.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.120
I would love to voice in an anime

22:04.120 --> 22:06.120
or some other form of animation.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.120
I would love to travel

22:08.120 --> 22:10.120
off-clad with the girlies,

22:10.120 --> 22:12.120
and I want to make amazing friends

22:12.120 --> 22:14.120
and you know,

22:14.120 --> 22:16.120
there's a lot of amazing talents out there

22:16.120 --> 22:18.120
that I would love to get to know.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.120
Mm-hmm.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.120
Here are some of my tags.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.120
So here's my general art tag.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.120
It's a sheebie art.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.120
I'm not going too crazy with it.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.120
My alternative, my naughty art tag

22:30.120 --> 22:32.120
is a bondage.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.120
Memes are a bun wild.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.120
My live is sheebie live.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.120
Clips are a cotton bomb clips,

22:38.120 --> 22:40.120
and my fan name,

22:40.120 --> 22:42.120
I came up with harem

22:42.120 --> 22:44.120
this morning.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.120
But also someone said like harlets,

22:46.120 --> 22:48.120
hairlets, I don't know.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.120
My sheebie bros, whatever.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.120
We'll figure it out. My Yoshi marks are a rope and a bunny.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.120
It's pretty self-explanatory.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.120
Okay, so my first impressions

23:00.120 --> 23:02.120
of the girls, I put like where I would take them

23:02.120 --> 23:04.120
on a date.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.120
So for Stronny, she's hardworking,

23:06.120 --> 23:08.120
and I know she loves Lord of the Rings.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.120
All of the Lord of the Rings movies together

23:10.120 --> 23:12.120
while we snuggle.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.120
And you know, just get really under those

23:14.120 --> 23:16.120
cars.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.120
Mercy, I would take her to a steak house

23:18.120 --> 23:20.120
cause knives.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.120
I think she, you know, I'll swipe a knife for her

23:22.120 --> 23:24.120
five finger discount.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.120
She's dangerous, she lives life on the edge.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.120
Get it?

23:28.120 --> 23:30.120
Anyways,

23:30.120 --> 23:32.120
Azura, I want to cook a meal together with her

23:32.120 --> 23:34.120
and take her on a picnic.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.120
Probably something milk based.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.120
I wouldn't buy that.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.120
So, yeah.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.120
Getting ice cream

23:42.120 --> 23:44.120
with icy would be amazing.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.120
If we could just watch the sunset.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.120
You know, all the Aurora Borealis

23:48.120 --> 23:50.120
if we go back to her hometown.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.120
And just, you know,

23:52.120 --> 23:54.120
suck on some popsicles together.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.120
Some icicles.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.120
Iced icicles.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.120
Wow, the mom jokes are out today.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.120
For Amy, I want to take her to a coffee shop

24:02.120 --> 24:04.120
with a book star and feeder pastry.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.120
She's so cute.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.120
I just want to stuff her little face with food

24:08.120 --> 24:10.120
and then find her more grimoire so she can, you know,

24:10.120 --> 24:12.120
get her bro back.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
I don't really know what they got going on,

24:14.120 --> 24:16.120
but it's something.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.120
Okay.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.120
I want to give a huge thank you

24:20.120 --> 24:22.120
to Squishy Ghoul

24:22.120 --> 24:24.120
and Nari.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.120
They did such an amazing job.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.120
If they hadn't done all the work that they did,

24:28.120 --> 24:30.120
I would not be here. None of the girls would be here.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.120
So thank you so much.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.120
Thank you to all these other wonderful people

24:34.120 --> 24:36.120
who, without

24:36.120 --> 24:38.120
their help,

24:38.120 --> 24:40.120
I wouldn't have all this cool stuff.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.120
Like, thank you. You guys worked so freaking hard.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.120
I appreciate it so much.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.120
Okay.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.120
Let's go to my bedroom.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.120
I can shut myself off.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.120
Oh, yeah.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.120
Okay. I'm like in a corner. Hold on.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.120
Hello.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.120
Hi.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.120
You can see my beautiful face.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.120
I'll go through. Hold on.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.120
Let me just...

25:16.120 --> 25:18.120
So you got my beautiful feet.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.120
My little stompers.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.120
My little stompers. I'm going to step on you with them.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.120
You want a sniff? Too bad.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.120
You're not good enough.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.120
My lovely ankles.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.120
My long, luscious legs

25:30.120 --> 25:32.120
covered with my beautiful

25:32.120 --> 25:34.120
tights.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.120
And then, you know,

25:36.120 --> 25:38.120
naturally, I'm wearing shabar

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
roads, but don't get it. Don't get it twisted

25:40.120 --> 25:42.120
just because I'm tied up doesn't mean

25:42.120 --> 25:44.120
I'm not going to be the one calling the shots.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.120
Okay, sweetheart.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.120
All right. That's what I thought.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.120
Ew.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.120
I don't like a short skirt,

25:52.120 --> 25:54.120
you know.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.120
You got to air out the girls. You know what I'm saying?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.120
Somebody asked,

25:58.120 --> 26:00.120
does these ropes leave marks? Yes.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.120
I got my little office wear. You love my,

26:04.120 --> 26:06.120
you know, succulent mole.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.120
I like to wear a really

26:08.120 --> 26:10.120
lacy lingerie.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.120
I mean, this is just a shirt.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.120
It's just a normal shirt. I don't know what you're talking about.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.120
And then my lovely choker.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.120
It's very avant-garde, don't you think?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.120
And then we have

26:22.120 --> 26:24.120
my beautiful face. I'm going to quickly run through

26:24.120 --> 26:26.120
my toggles. We got

26:26.120 --> 26:28.120
blushing. We got

26:28.120 --> 26:30.120
sweating and blushing. We got

26:30.120 --> 26:32.120
hard eyes sweating and blushing.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.120
Then

26:36.120 --> 26:38.120
I'm going to be really, really dark

26:38.120 --> 26:40.120
if you disappoint me.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.120
You disgust me.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.120
I'll be really upset.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.120
Why the fuck did you do that piece of shit?

26:52.120 --> 26:54.120
And then I can cry, which is rare.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.120
So I'm not going to use that for long.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.120
And then

26:58.120 --> 27:00.120
I can have a

27:00.120 --> 27:02.120
real mouth.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.120
And then I can be like

27:04.120 --> 27:06.120
holy crap.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.120
When were you going to tell me your dick was so small?

27:12.120 --> 27:14.120
I'm sorry.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.120
And then I can question my life

27:16.120 --> 27:18.120
choices.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.120
Okay, let me back up

27:22.120 --> 27:24.120
a little bit.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.120
Okay.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.120
We got

27:30.120 --> 27:32.120
some more. I have a leash.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.120
Yeah.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.120
You're on my leash, baby boy.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.120
You better fucking

27:38.120 --> 27:40.120
beg.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.120
We

27:42.120 --> 27:44.120
get closer with that.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.120
And then

27:46.120 --> 27:48.120
I can also bop you.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.120
So be good.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.120
You're not going to like where this goes.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.120
Well, this is awkward.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.120
Yeah, well, those are my toggles.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.120
Okay, let me show my schedule real quick.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.120
Oh my god, hi.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.120
So we got the 2.0 tomorrow.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.120
We got another craps treasure. I was going to do Bloodborne

28:14.120 --> 28:16.120
because I was hoping they would have ported it for the PC,

28:16.120 --> 28:18.120
but they didn't because they suck.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.120
I love you, Sony.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.120
We're going to do some drunk ASMR,

28:22.120 --> 28:24.120
a little drunk ASMR role play.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.120
I'm a rabbit, so of course we're going to do

28:26.120 --> 28:28.120
Mr. Hopps Playhouse.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.120
And then I'm going to play some Class of 09.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.120
A Stanley Parable because fuck, office life.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.120
Call to the Lamb and then

28:34.120 --> 28:36.120
Vampire the Masquerade Bloodline.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.120
So I hope

28:38.120 --> 28:40.120
you will enjoy.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.120
Wait a second.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.120
Oh, is that

28:46.120 --> 28:48.120
Is it that time?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.120
Is it

28:50.120 --> 28:52.120
that time?

28:52.120 --> 28:54.120
At long last

28:54.120 --> 28:56.120
the time for edge in is over.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.120
Release

28:58.120 --> 29:00.120
Reflicks and feast your eyes

29:00.120 --> 29:02.120
on the lovely

29:02.120 --> 29:04.120
Scottish cuttlefish

29:04.120 --> 29:06.120
Strummy.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.120
Give her all my love.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.120
Thank you.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.120
Thank you.
