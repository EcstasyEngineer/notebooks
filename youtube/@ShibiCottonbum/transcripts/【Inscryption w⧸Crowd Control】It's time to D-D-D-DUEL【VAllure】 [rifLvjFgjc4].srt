00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,000
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

5
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,280
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little tail of a little big

6
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
screws

7
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
after the sign

8
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,140
I just woke up

9
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,540
so you get the sleepy

10
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,800
I was like, it was like 4.58, um, like, gets up, crawls to desk, turns on stream.

11
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:21,740
I might need to- I think I need to have an idle meeting when I'm not sure yet.

12
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
But how are you guys doing?

13
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
I'm doing fine.

14
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,240
I hope you're doing fine.

15
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
I could have slept a little longer, but it's kind of better I don't, because, oh my god,

16
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm so big at the hell I'm trying to scroll, so that, um, I'm echoing, I hate it when I do that.

17
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,000
Um, so that, oh, it's my turn to putt.

18
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,160
That should have been a warning sign.

19
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,520
Oh yeah, so I have to wear this on me because YouTube doesn't like my bosom, so I'm hiding it.

20
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,920
Out of shame, I'm so shameful.

21
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm so terrible for YouTube.

22
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,600
Um, I am getting a cover-up, uh, eventually, so.

23
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,560
And it'll probably just be my shirt button, which is nice.

24
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
I might have got my nose itches.

25
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,440
YouTube does pick and choose, yes.

26
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,320
Um, let me see.

27
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,200
Literally one of my favorite games of all time, plus she be streaming it.

28
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm being good today.

29
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Um, I love Inscription.

30
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,640
Inscription is one of my favorite games of all time, so I know some of you guys have that in common.

31
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,440
It is, if you don't know what Inscription is, Inscription is a, um, it's a card, turn-based card

32
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,480
game, and cards have unique properties.

33
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,520
You do all very interesting characters that have very cool little perks that they got.

34
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,360
The ambiance is amazing, the plot is amazing, it's very meta.

35
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,080
I highly recommend, if you've never played Inscription after, um, watching me today,

36
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,800
please play it.

37
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,320
It's such a good game.

38
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,160
I've played through the game multiple times.

39
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:28,560
Some of you who might be from, um, my PL have seen me play it before, and my Inscription streams

40
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,080
where I know some of people's favorites, because I gave everybody very funny voices.

41
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,760
But yeah, it's a very, very good, uh, good game.

42
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,880
We're going to be doing Casey's Mod, so a Casey's Mod is that it extends the first portion of the

43
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,000
game, because there's several sections of the game.

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,800
There's different phases, um, and because, of course, it's the one you first start off with,

45
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,840
the first phase of the game, or the first half, or whatever portion, um, is a fan favorite of

46
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,920
everybody's, um, for the graphics, the characters, what have you.

47
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,320
So Casey's Mod expands that, so it lasts a little bit longer.

48
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,800
We have Crowd Control, I'm going to, I don't, I don't know how it will work with Inscription,

49
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,760
but we'll see.

50
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm very excited.

51
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,240
I've never played it with the Crowd Control with Inscription before, so that'll be fun.

52
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:40,880
Um, somebody also asked, uh, if I'm replacing Strani and the, uh, Uno collab tomorrow, uh,

53
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,600
or, sorry, the day after, or Sunday, I can't remember, I just woke up, let me alone.

54
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,040
Um, yes, I am, because I was supposed to be in it in the first place.

55
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,320
Uh, she only subbed in for me, because I couldn't join because of work.

56
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,360
But now, since I quit my job, I can be back in it.

57
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,920
So I apologize if that disappoints you, I completely understand if it does.

58
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,800
Um, but, yeah, I still hope you think we'll have fun, because I know we will.

59
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,760
Um, yeah, it's no work now, yay.

60
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,640
Saturday, yes.

61
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,920
Um, yeah, it's stupid, Uno only has four players, like it's so dumb,

62
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,640
it should be like six or eight, like at max in my opinion, but you know, it is what it is,

63
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,360
you know, it's owned by Ubisoft, so what the fuck, whatever.

64
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,400
Um, hold on, Uno reverse card.

65
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,000
Uh, the graphic, the thumbnail artist, I was like, I realized after they're like,

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
oh, what do you want me to put on your thumbnail?

67
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,080
And I'm like, so, and they show me examples of like,

68
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,280
Shawnee's, and it was like, um, stop saying you're inking yourself for five minutes or draw 25.

69
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,520
So, uh, I did stop doing wacky voices for five minutes, but what I should have done

70
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,440
was stop getting demonetized for five minutes or draw 25.

71
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,280
And I thought would have been funner.

72
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,160
Um, but it is what it is.

73
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,080
It's still, it's still silly.

74
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,160
Although like, it was funny that the Azura, the collab I have with Azura,

75
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,520
it did get limited ads, which I thought was really funny.

76
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,680
I don't, I seem to have fallen asleep in excitement.

77
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Well, I'll just talk like this, I guess.

78
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Um, it might be my wifi.

79
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,520
It's, it's been like really hot today.

80
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,360
I wouldn't be surprised if like, I don't know, freaking fire happens or lose power or what have you.

81
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
It's just, it's, it's the hottest it's been.

82
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,960
It's been a long time in my area.

83
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,160
Um, but, uh, I did get limited ads, but I appealed it and they accepted it.

84
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,080
It's fine.

85
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,600
So it's good.

86
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,560
It's fine.

87
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,680
Oh, I've woken up.

88
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,320
Um, I, I literally was so tired after, hold on.

89
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,360
Where did my BGM go for just chatting?

90
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,840
Hello?

91
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,680
That's so weird.

92
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,840
I should have it here instead of me just like talking incessantly.

93
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,480
I'll have you have some music with it.

94
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,760
Um, there we go.

95
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,240
That's fine.

96
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,120
Cool beans.

97
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,200
Um, what was I going to say?

98
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,240
Oh, uh, so I went into the grocery store.

99
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,880
I haven't been in the grocery store and ground grocery shopping and like maybe a month or two.

100
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I usually, like, I don't really eat a lot.

101
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,040
I like, you guys, like I'll usually just like door dash a meal and that's my thing for the day,

102
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
which I'm like, that's probably not healthy.

103
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,600
Just eating one meal a day.

104
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
Hey, but I have like apple juice and water.

105
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
So I got some snacks.

106
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,880
I was really pissed though, because I, I'm like, I said, I mentioned like power going out and stuff

107
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:28,480
on just because in the, um, the frozen food section of my supermarket, the power was out.

108
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
So all, I feel bad for the supermarket.

109
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
So they're like, you can't open the doors.

110
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,160
I'm like, then why even have this place open if we can't open any of the fast, not the fast food,

111
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
the frozen food section.

112
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,640
And like, I was going to get a pizza and or like some like

113
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
salmon because I love salmon and I couldn't even do that.

114
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
So I literally just got like snacks.

115
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,640
I have, I have, um, Emmy, Mammy, want beef, uh, beef jerky.

116
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
So I got beef jerky next to me.

117
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,000
I've already eaten half of a bueno and I have an airhead next to me and I'm like,

118
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,840
I literally went food shopping.

119
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,440
Like I'm a fucking teenager.

120
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,920
But, um, yeah, I have to like actually, I'll probably go to another supermarket tomorrow

121
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:28,400
and like get like, um, usually I'll get like steak or like some sort of unlike some poultry.

122
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Um, I do, I do, I did see my little, it's funny because people are like, oh,

123
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,960
oh, should you be, you put, you added hello fresh on your alt account.

124
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,680
Oh, did you know you were doing?

125
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,640
Yes, I did.

126
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,600
That was the point.

127
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
It was, it was funny because I knew I would get interaction.

128
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,080
You guys have been tricked.

129
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,760
And also, um, I tweeted from that account because I thought it would get more attention

130
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,840
because it has more followers than my main.

131
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,320
But then I was just like, wait, I don't want them to think I'm just a whore

132
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,240
because I'm more than that.

133
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
I'm more than just a whore, okay.

134
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,960
Um, so I, that's when I added, I was like, uh, oh shit, add this.

135
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,200
But yeah, you guys can believe the other thing that I did it on accident.

136
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,120
That's okay.

137
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,680
Don't be mad.

138
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,400
You got baited.

139
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,520
I sound like I'm drunk.

140
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,760
I sound like a girl at a party that's like, hey, do you want to come home with me?

141
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,560
Like my ride kind of ditched me.

142
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
So like, can you take me home?

143
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,920
No, I've only had like a couple shots.

144
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,960
It's not a big deal.

145
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm not going to puke in your car.

146
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Just take me home.

147
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,280
All right.

148
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,480
All right.

149
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,960
Thank you.

150
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
Um, I'm such a kidder.

151
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,720
Yeah.

152
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,960
Fresh.

153
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,080
She'd be banned.

154
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,520
Um, I wonder if one fourth of your grocery bills is actual hood.

155
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,600
Like, yeah, I got like some Cheerios.

156
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,240
I got milk.

157
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,280
I got like way too much juice, I will say.

158
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,560
I'm like, I got like two, two different types of seltzer.

159
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,960
I got some ginger ale because my tummy has been upset.

160
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,840
I don't drink soda often.

161
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm like, you know, I'll make up, I'll make an exception with ginger ale.

162
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,400
That's better.

163
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,640
Right.

164
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,640
Um, it's not.

165
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,840
And then I got some, I realized they got two types of apple juice.

166
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,640
I got apple juice in a pouch.

167
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:33,120
And then I got apple juice in the, like in the giant container of apple juice,

168
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,240
like a jug of apple juice.

169
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,880
And I was like, well, I thought I grabbed the peach tea, but I grabbed the apple juice.

170
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
So I guess I have one apple juice.

171
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,720
And then I got lemonade.

172
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,600
Did I grab lemonade?

173
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't know.

174
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,200
And I realized I got milk when I already had milk.

175
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,040
And I'm like, you know, you can never get too much milk.

176
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,200
I don't drink milk because like just like a zero, I'm lactose intolerant.

177
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,880
And I really shouldn't be having milk or gluten for that matter because, uh,

178
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,320
fiber actually, um, dairy and gluten cause inflammation if you didn't know that.

179
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
So if you're having inflammation problems, don't eat that stuff.

180
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,280
But, um, I don't live in California where everybody and their mom is like vegetarian

181
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,160
and gluten free or whatever have you.

182
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,480
So I will eat it anyways at the expense of my physical health.

183
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,800
And also because it tastes good.

184
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,400
No one can stop me.

185
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,200
Uh, lactose free.

186
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,840
There was like, honestly, when things say that they're lactose free,

187
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,880
I don't really believe it cause like I'll drink lactate.

188
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,280
I'll still have tummy issues.

189
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,320
I don't know what it is.

190
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,040
There's this other drink.

191
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,840
There's this other type of milk I got that's lactose free.

192
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,120
I still get tummy issues.

193
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,000
So maybe it's another thing within the milk that makes me sick.

194
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,480
I don't know.

195
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
It really just makes me fart a lot.

196
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
So not a big deal.

197
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:00,240
Um, like, uh, like I mentioned, like saying that, um, I was watching the boys yesterday

198
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,840
and saying that like in the homelander was like drinking a milkshake.

199
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,680
And I was like, oh, I'd love to drink a milkshake.

200
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,560
And then I got a milkshake this morning.

201
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,160
Surprise.

202
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I treated myself and, um, I was just farting up a storm.

203
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
So sorry.

204
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,640
Almond milk.

205
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I don't, my, I don't know.

206
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,920
What it is.

207
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,120
I don't like the texture of most like the only type of milk I can drink.

208
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
That's not actual milk.

209
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
Milk is probably oat milk.

210
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,240
Almond milk tastes like spit to me.

211
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,880
Um, I also don't like eggnog for that reason.

212
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,400
It feels like spit in my mouth and not like the fun kind.

213
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
It's just like someone hacked a loogie and that's,

214
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,960
it's only fun when I do it to you and when it's in a naughty sense,

215
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,880
not when I'm like trying to have cereal.

216
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,160
I don't want to have a spit bowl of spit milk cereal.

217
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm good with that, but thank you.

218
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm sounding like such a valley girl right now.

219
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,920
What the fuck is going on?

220
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
Um, but yeah.

221
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,360
I'm wearing overalls.

222
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm going to take them off because they're starting to write up my cooch.

223
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,520
Well, I'm sitting.

224
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,320
I have a song stuck in my head.

225
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,840
K-Tranota and Pink Pantherous did a song together,

226
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,960
which blessed my beautiful bunny ears called Snap My Fingers.

227
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,680
And I have her vocal stuck in my head and I'm like, oh my God.

228
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,360
I love Pink Pantherous.

229
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh my God, just stepped in a shit ton of litter.

230
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,400
Um, thank you, uh, by the way, for whomever purchased.

231
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,160
Um, or just like you guys been heavily, heavily, heavily supporting me on Throne.

232
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,440
And I appreciate that a lot because I, as you see, I don't put like

233
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,200
a lot of like weeb shit or clothes or cute shit.

234
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
I'm like, I need stuff for my house.

235
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,640
And I appreciate it so much when you guys help me with that.

236
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,560
I'm like, I need a vacuum.

237
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,440
I need, can I have, can I have a bed frame?

238
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,040
I like, oh my God, my bed frame was so heavy and I dropped it on my foot

239
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,720
and I have a giant bruise on my foot now.

240
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,680
Um, that actually doesn't look that bad.

241
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,200
It looks bad when I first happened.

242
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,920
But thank you.

243
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,280
I appreciate you guys so much.

244
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,440
Um, I don't want to sleep on a mattress on the floor anymore.

245
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know how I'm going to, like in my bed is, my bed is big.

246
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,720
I have, um, despite being like just me, I have a king size bed.

247
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,040
Um, because I have three cats and they take up one side of the bed.

248
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,080
And then I was just like, oh, if I get a dog, because when I move,

249
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,800
like probably get my own house, I'm probably gonna get a dog.

250
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,040
I'm like, where's the dog going to sleep?

251
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
He's got to sleep in bed with me.

252
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:47,920
Okay.

253
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,160
Cause you know, I need like have a little puppy.

254
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,680
Um, you know, chilling.

255
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,080
Don't worry.

256
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,680
If I got a dog, I would create, train it.

257
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,560
I'm, I'm very good.

258
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
Um, my family friends are dog trainers.

259
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
So probably seek their wisdom.

260
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
But like, I, I, I also move around.

261
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm weird and I also move around a lot in bed.

262
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,800
So my mom always made fun of me cause as a baby, um, or like younger,

263
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
I would always sleep in like a crescent shape.

264
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,040
Like, I don't know what, not like my arms out,

265
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,080
but I would just like curl to the ball, like the side of the ball.

266
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,320
And lately when I wake up in bed, I realized if, I don't know if I'm having

267
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,320
restless sleep, but I realized I'm waking up completely sideways.

268
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,840
Like I just, I'm literally horizontal, not vertical on my bed.

269
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
And I'm like, good thing I have a giant bed.

270
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,240
So big bed for real little girls to sleep at the foot of the bed.

271
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,040
Exactly.

272
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,760
Hi, Mercy.

273
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,040
I have a little spot for mercy.

274
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,880
It, I like, and then, and it's like, if one of the girls slept over,

275
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
which I would love to host the girls at my apartment, if that ever happened,

276
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,320
it would be so funny.

277
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Um, cause I have enough room.

278
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,960
I could probably get like a blowout mattress.

279
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
My walking closet is huge.

280
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
I could literally fit like a twin in there.

281
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,080
Um, and then someone could take the couch and my couch turns into a bed

282
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
cause you girls smart.

283
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,320
And, uh, I have space on my floor and then one of the girls,

284
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,560
I probably could fit two of the girls in bed with me.

285
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:33,440
So, you know, although like, yeah, I think I'm the tallest out of all the girls.

286
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,680
So I probably, I probably give the girls my bed cause I'm nice like that.

287
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,960
And I'll be like, I'll sleep on the floor.

288
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,400
Uh, yeah.

289
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,800
The couch, honestly, so it's like, um, like, sorry, I just looked over at Boomi

290
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:53,360
and he, you know that one picture of that cat in that, um, eating food in that one

291
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,240
like feeder food thing and he's, it's like the recording them and stuff.

292
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,760
And then they have names, you know, the one with like the sassy side eye.

293
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,040
I just looked over and he was looking at me like that and it took me by surprise how

294
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,600
much he looks like the cat looking up after eating food going.

295
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,720
Um, you fight for the chance to sleep.

296
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:24,080
She be, um, but my couch, um, and this is because like I, I have family outside, um,

297
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,200
of my state and sometimes like my parents house is too small to probably like to have

298
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,800
people like stay there.

299
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,480
So I got, um, for my grandparents and my aunts and uncles when they come up from Florida,

300
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,520
um, like, wait, it just stalks my family.

301
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,400
I don't really care though.

302
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,200
I forget it.

303
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,000
I have a, oh my God, Reina is singing the song of her people.

304
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,200
Can you guys hear that?

305
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,760
She has her fuzzy ball and she likes to yell with it.

306
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,840
Um, the couch is like an L shaped couch.

307
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,360
It's kind of small, but like there's this little thing you can pull out and it makes

308
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,680
it turn into a bed and you can put like a little bed pad on it and then just like have

309
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,280
some blankets and I have a lot of blankets and I have so many blankets.

310
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
I got you.

311
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,800
So you're not going to be given like a cardboard box to cover yourself in when you sleep over.

312
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,800
Um, if any of the girls watching right now have concern that if you shared the bed with

313
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,560
any of them, you might accidentally straight, just wrangle across like toss and turn to you.

314
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,600
I probably would just smack one of them in the face on accident.

315
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,280
Um, I probably, yeah, I would probably just like flip.

316
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,480
That's why I'm like, I'll sleep on the floor like in my closet.

317
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,680
You could have probably two girls on the couch, three girls in my bed.

318
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,960
So that, yeah, it works out.

319
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:48,880
Yeah.

320
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
The harem can get the cardboard.

321
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,160
You guys can, you guys can sleep next to me on the floor and I'll just, you know,

322
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,800
pull a little piece of cardboard on you for, for warmth.

323
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,360
You can sleep on some cardboard and then you get a cardboard blanket.

324
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,680
I would say thank you if you smacked me in the face.

325
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,160
Um, no, I would never intentionally hit one of the girls unless they're like

326
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,160
subconsciously they tell me to do that while I'm sleeping.

327
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,480
If they're like whispering into me and they're like, hit me, hit me, hit me.

328
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,280
I'm not going to, I also, um, tend to snore.

329
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:29,440
So I was like thinking about doing for my doughnut on this like sleeping on stream.

330
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,200
I stream and I'm like, I'm definitely going to snore, but that's fine.

331
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,000
I think it's funny.

332
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,320
You can bully me for that.

333
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,080
I don't mind boxing off collab would go kind of hard.

334
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,960
I've always wanted to do kickboxing, um, but my body is nice and frail now

335
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,840
after having COVID and that's what set off the, the, the physical bomb within my body

336
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,880
that gave me fibro.

337
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,600
Do you talk in your sleep?

338
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't, I don't sleeping with madam.

339
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
I think sleeping streams are allowed on YouTube.

340
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm not quite sure.

341
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,560
Uh, I thought with your jujitsu back room and you excel in kickboxing.

342
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,200
Yes.

343
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,640
Like I, but like keep in mind, I haven't, I haven't done jujitsu in quite a

344
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,920
bit because of one.

345
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,120
I injured my shoulder really bad.

346
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,400
Someone tackled me really good.

347
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,960
I don't know if it popped it out of place, but I have like eternal bursitis in that

348
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,360
shoulder.

349
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
Oh, hi, bro.

350
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,560
Thank you for the soup.

351
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,480
One of the girls tickling your nose with the feather while the other presents herself.

352
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,280
She's in the way of your hand.

353
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,760
We try to swat away the thing tickling.

354
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,360
I need that as an art piece.

355
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,720
I, I need that drawn.

356
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,120
Thank you for the time.

357
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,280
Yeah.

358
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,680
And COVID stopped us from getting you in the UFC.

359
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
Dude, you have no idea.

360
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,200
Cause I was, I was going to start competing at that point.

361
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,760
Um, then COVID happened, which sucked.

362
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,880
But my, my teacher was just like, it's, I think it's time that you start competing.

363
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,520
And I had been there for, um, I forget how long, but I was just like, I was so hyped.

364
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,320
I was so ready.

365
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,720
Then, you know, everybody gets like, it's funny.

366
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,040
People like, oh, you do jujitsu and then it's either they respond with yes or they're

367
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,480
like, nah, I got injured and I'm the latter.

368
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm not, I got injured.

369
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,040
I'm no chef, but boy are these titties sweaty today.

370
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
I was reading something on Twitter.

372
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,160
Um, but it actually fits a lot.

373
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,640
I'm going to retweet that because I was literally taking off my bra at the same time

374
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,560
as I was reading that because my titties are sweaty.

375
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,640
Um, but yeah, and I also bruise really easily.

376
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,000
Uh, I have arthritis at the young age of 56.

377
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,880
So in my neck, I remember I used to, I had to get injections in my neck and I know I

378
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,560
need another one because my shoulder is acting up again because it's all nerve pain and shit.

379
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,160
And that's why my fingers go numb and turn really, really white when I'm cold.

380
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,440
I don't really care though.

381
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,720
And then my customer is like, you could definitely have renoite syndrome.

382
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:15,520
Um, but, um, uh, I remember I was getting injections in my neck and it was cool because

383
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,000
the way that I was angled, I can kind of see the doctor like putting the needles in because

384
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,960
you had to, he had to put like the ports in first and near my spine.

385
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,640
Um, cause it's like on the lower part of my neck and then, then he had to inject it into

386
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,240
the ports and I could see the ports going into my neck and I was like, holy, this is cool.

387
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,240
I also had a valium that day.

388
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,840
So I probably thought anything was cool.

389
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,000
I never had valium before, but I felt like I was in amnesia, the dark descent.

390
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
So I was having a great time.

391
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,600
Um, I had really bad anxiety for that.

392
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:57,360
So my mom drove me to and from, uh, and so the doctor afterwards, and I'm like on valium,

393
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,400
mind you, and he's just like, so like, do you do a lot of like contact sports?

394
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,760
And I'm like, no, I haven't done a jiu-jitsu for like a year.

395
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,840
And he's just like, yeah, this wouldn't do that.

396
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,760
He's like, do you do any horseback riding?

397
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,520
I'm like, I did when I was like, like years ago.

398
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,520
And they're just like, oh, it looks like you've been doing it recently because your

399
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,800
like neck, it looks like it's been like bobbing a lot.

400
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,120
And I'm like, like it's been jostled and like shaken around and just like,

401
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,920
rut like, like my bones have grinded against each other.

402
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,600
And I'm just like, no, I'm not.

403
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
And they're like, do you stand on your head?

404
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
Like, do you do yoga?

405
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm like, no.

406
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,240
So my bone, like after like, I got hit when I got COVID the first time I was fine.

407
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,280
The second time I was like, I like my body was a mess.

408
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,040
And I like set off like all this fucking inflammation to my body because I was perfectly

409
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,400
fine before I ever had COVID, never had an issue, never had like the worst thing was

410
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,760
that I wore fucking glasses.

411
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,240
So much for that.

412
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
Do you stand on your head on a regular basis?

413
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,520
Have you been spending time in a giant novelty washing machine lately?

414
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
And, um, yeah.

415
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,120
And so like, I have it in both sides of my neck and in my ankles, like pretty much on my joints.

416
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:24,720
And they're just, and like, I'm in my 50s, very young for my age.

417
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,040
Okay. So they were very confused by that.

418
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,360
And a lot of doctors wouldn't believe me when I said like, I was feeling this

419
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,720
symptom or that symptom because they're like, oh, that sounds like this rheumatoid or like

420
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
fibro or this or that.

421
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,280
And my mom is fibro.

422
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,560
So I was just like, yeah.

423
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,440
So it was just, oh, so fucking annoying dealing with doctors.

424
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,280
Um, even recently, like go to my, I'll go to any doctor and they look at me.

425
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,600
They see like, like I'm a healthy looking woman.

426
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,040
I'm young at 56.

427
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,960
And they're just like, wait, so you have this problem, this problem and this problem.

428
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,760
No, you can't.

429
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
You're too young.

430
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,040
And you guys see, have seen how big my titties are.

431
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,720
I'll be honest with you.

432
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,840
I want a reduction because I'm having a lot of horrible back and neck and shoulder pain.

433
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,600
That's, trust me, I love, I love my tick old bitties, but when they cause me pain,

434
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
I can't deal with them.

435
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
And my, one of the doctors that I went to said, you should just use a different bra.

436
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,600
And I was like, gamer word, excuse me.

437
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,720
No.

438
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,240
Like, brother.

439
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,280
No, no, no, no.

440
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,680
What do you, maybe because it was a fucking man that told me that, but I was, I was pissed the

441
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,480
fuck off.

442
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,560
I was like, excuse me.

443
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,040
You did not just fucking say that.

444
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,360
Um, the anti-grab, yeah, they're like, just wear more sports bras.

445
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm like, what?

446
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,680
That doesn't even make any fucking sense.

447
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,880
Um, but this would, I'm like, that's on the back burner though.

448
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,760
That's on the back burner.

449
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,120
I don't even know what I'm talking about this.

450
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,160
Um, I guess, yeah, it's because I've been in a lot of pain lately.

451
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,160
Some were, I think that's another reason I had to like sleep because I've been in a

452
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,120
lot of pain.

453
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
My shoulder has been fucking killing me.

454
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,360
So I just want to be honest with you, honest with you, tell you how I'm doing.

455
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:30,000
Um, I am, you know, we are the Sick Girl Corpo, you know, point, fifth edition because

456
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,920
every Corpo is a Sick Girl Corpo.

457
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Um, learning more, learning more about how Sheeby's body is falling apart.

458
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,960
Um, Pac-Britters is a good name for heavy hand.

459
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,120
That's a good, yeah, actually that's pretty good.

460
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,360
Um, but yeah, please don't get reduction.

461
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,200
Both men and women would kill to have those.

462
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,960
How would I kill you?

463
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,400
How about that?

464
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,360
No, I'm kidding.

465
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,640
In Minecraft, of course.

466
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:12,800
Um, but you know, like imagine, I'm trying to think I'm an equivalent for men.

467
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,920
It was funny because like Salem didn't quite understand why I wanted one either.

468
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,120
And she's just like, come on.

469
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,320
And I'm like, hold them.

470
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,960
She's like, what?

471
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,760
I'm like, hold them.

472
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,440
So she took them and hold them.

473
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,080
She's like, holy crap, this is like 10 pounds each.

474
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
And I'm like, exactly, exactly this.

475
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,080
Um, imagine, yeah, imagine your balls in the, no, like, I can't.

476
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:45,520
Like take two things of flower, put them in a, like strap them, put a strap on each one of them,

477
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,240
put that strap around your neck and hang yourself.

478
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,960
No, I'm kidding.

479
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,800
And, and hang them around your neck and you're in front of your chest.

480
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,760
Like, or like balloons, not even, no, balloons are too light.

481
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,880
Just like something heavy, take them, um, and do that.

482
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,080
And then feel how bad, and then, and then wear a bra with it, like an underwire bra.

483
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,240
Have that bra dig into you and not fit properly.

484
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,800
Gallons of milk.

485
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Sure, whatever you want.

486
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,560
A bowling.

487
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,440
They're not that heavy.

488
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,080
Jesus Christ.

489
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,080
Um, but there you go.

490
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,400
It's not fun.

491
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,200
It cuts like I have permanent bruising in my shoulders and like, don't get me wrong.

492
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,360
I don't want to do this.

493
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,440
I would, if I didn't have to, but it just hurts.

494
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,280
You know, it just hurts.

495
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,040
It just hurts.

496
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,120
It is what it is.

497
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,360
And I was like, it also, they're not, they make me look a lot bigger than I am.

498
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,000
And I don't know if you noticed in the pictures that I posted on, um, my alt Twitter of like my cosplay,

499
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,400
but you could see like my tits start very high up and towards the like middle of my torso

500
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,000
because they take up a lot of space on my body.

501
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,080
Like, uh, I wish I could hold on.

502
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,640
Let me see if I can find an, uh, oh, this will work.

503
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,980
Oops.

504
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:32,340
So imagine me having the body type that I do, which is very similar to she be here.

505
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,220
I do have a bit of a tummy, but you know, I have a womb to protect.

506
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,300
So I get a little, a little fat pouch there.

507
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,500
I don't really care about that though.

508
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,300
Um, so imagine my boob and it, it's like fucking this.

509
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,020
Like when you wear a bra and then it makes me look like

510
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,980
that, mind you, this is like anime girl.

511
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,220
So the proportions are going to be a little bit different.

512
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,180
My torso is shorter than my models.

513
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,500
It, it would make me look freaking huge, right?

514
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,980
Like it would make me look fat.

515
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,460
And I've even noticed that because it hides my, um, my curves because I have an hourglass figure

516
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,660
and that's what it does to them.

517
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,420
It hides them.

518
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,940
Obviously they're not that big.

519
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:27,460
Again, the, my torso is different than my model, but like that's what it does.

520
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,820
And so it makes it look like

521
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,540
that I'm either fat or have huge fucking saggy titties.

522
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,020
And I'm like, brother, give me some cute like B cups.

523
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,980
So I can wear like, I can wear a shirt with no bra, you know, I want to have,

524
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,580
I want to be that powerful, you know?

525
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,620
Um, clown nose bitties, squeeze them honk.

526
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,700
Clown girl for Jen too.

527
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,340
Mom, please.

528
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,380
Mom, please.

529
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,500
Mother, please.

530
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,220
I've been persuade.

531
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,100
I've been suede.

532
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,340
Slug girl, clown girl.

533
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,300
Who else do I want?

534
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,180
Um, I want a Lamia now.

535
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,060
I want a bug girl.

536
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,860
I also really want a pet play girl.

537
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,420
Yeah.

538
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,780
Although I already know, like several of the concepts for Jen too, but I just,

539
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,900
a girl likes to dream, you know, there won't be a slime girl.

540
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,340
Moths are overdone.

541
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,540
There's like 50 moths.

542
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,780
Um, a girl, that's a gun that we say.

543
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,940
Honestly, there's not a lot of like, there's like Android V tubers, but like,

544
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,580
there's not object V tubers because you'll have like food V tubers and animal V tubers,

545
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,260
and animal V tubers.

546
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,260
But like, honestly, like, um, like chainsaw man type, like a gun chuba.

547
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,940
I'd be pretty sick.

548
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,740
I wouldn't be averse to that.

549
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,980
This game is super based.

550
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,660
Are guns to it?

551
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,020
Well, what do you mean?

552
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,700
There's so many gun channels on YouTube.

553
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,020
I watched this one guy whose name I has evaded me, but he just like,

554
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,380
I don't know.

555
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,700
I don't know if it's fucked up of me that I like to watch like the different types of

556
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,300
bullets they use in different types of, I also like to see how guns work in real life versus

557
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,220
the games that I use them with, like play them in, play them with.

558
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,020
And oh my God, what the fuck is his name?

559
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,540
I have to look it up and he uses like those gel bodies and he's like in the middle of

560
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,900
like a desert and I don't know, like, I can't remember where he is at.

561
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,420
He's like the middle, not of a desert, but it's like, it looks like Cali, but I don't

562
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,220
think it's Cali.

563
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,180
Um, and he just shoots it with his friends and they just

564
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,620
are pretty, they're just, they just fuck about and it's funny.

565
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,180
Garen Thump.

566
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,660
Yes.

567
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:45,940
Thank you.

568
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,780
Thank you.

569
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:47,940
Yeah.

570
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,420
Garen Thump.

571
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,660
Yep.

572
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,540
That's him.

573
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:49,780
Yeah.

574
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,820
Yeah.

575
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,700
That's, that's the guy.

576
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,580
I want to get my, my, my, my license to carry.

577
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,460
I'm not going to lie to you.

578
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,220
Um, I've always wanted to learn how to shoot.

579
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,820
My grandfather tried to teach me how to learn how to shoot, but then my mom said no.

580
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,500
And I was sad.

581
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:13,620
And it's funny though, because my mom has literally worked as part of her job before.

582
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:23,860
She worked with a, uh, a, a team of SEALs and for some like team bonding exercise,

583
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,940
she learned how to clear rooms and shoot.

584
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,780
And she was like the best shooter.

585
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,620
And one of the, my mom was telling me that one of the soldiers is like flirting with her.

586
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,860
And saying how good of a shot she was.

587
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,460
And she's like, he, he, he, he, he, he.

588
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:44,100
And my mom's like very like, sort of scared of like, does it like violence?

589
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,060
And I'm like, mom, be fucking for real.

590
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:53,780
Like in my life, my mom probably would have been in the military or running a 14, 500 company.

591
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,740
Cause she's that badass.

592
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,020
Um, Spec Ops mom.

593
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,340
Yeah.

594
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,940
No, she's a, she's a good shot.

595
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,420
She is.

596
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,660
My mom's badass.

597
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,340
I don't think my, I don't think my dad's ever shot like at a range or anything.

598
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,220
I have to ask him.

599
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,420
Um, I don't know if he even wears that.

600
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,580
She V's father is some random SEAL, dude.

601
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,020
No, this, I was around.

602
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,740
This is not before I was born.

603
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,820
Well, yeah, I'm, I'm also, I'm pretty good with the airsoft rifle and I'm very good at archery

604
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,340
from camp.

605
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,820
Um, so not to my own horn.

606
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,060
Uh, but I do like, I do like shooting.

607
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,940
I think it's really good way to release like pent up stress.

608
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,980
Um, especially you're doing it in a safe environment.

609
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,820
I would love to get lessons.

610
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,220
Um, I do have some friends who are military.

611
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,500
So like harem's airsoft one, that'd be fun.

612
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,820
Oh, like a paintball off collab would be sick.

613
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,340
Um, previous girl scout credentials.

614
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,660
Are there any SEAL tubers?

615
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,300
Yeah, there's a few.

616
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,140
Oh, like I thought you meant like SEALs, like the animal.

617
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:14,260
Um, no, this, I don't, there's the only military related person I can think of as the horse.

618
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,380
Uh, is it Tomoe or Tomo?

619
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,060
She's like a horse girl.

620
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,620
Um, and there's definitely, there's not a lot of military oriented.

621
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,380
Like they'll have like old school, general artwork of them, but they're not like actually

622
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,820
like military base.

623
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,420
You know, there's a, there's a niche there.

624
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,740
There's a niche there at some airsoft stuff to throw.

625
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,100
No, where am I going to use it?

626
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,700
I don't, there's no ranges near me.

627
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,420
Umari Tomo.

628
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:40,660
Yes.

629
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,380
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

630
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:41,860
Yes, sir.

631
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,340
She's cool.

632
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,540
Um, I love her, her character's design.

633
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,620
Um, close enough.

634
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,020
Well, I can't pretty guys know, I can't pronounce Japanese names.

635
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,500
Uh, a few tactical VTubers.

636
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,340
And then I don't know where VSPO EN is.

637
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,700
I always call them vispo.

638
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,020
Um, like where are they?

639
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,740
Where are they?

640
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,260
Where's their gen?

641
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,460
Where's the EN gen?

642
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,540
I applied for that a year ago.

643
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,100
They gave me a few views, but of course you sell.

644
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,540
I didn't get a call back.

645
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,460
I'm happy I didn't be alert.

646
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,420
Um, because again, I told you guys I used to do a lot of, uh, FPS games.

647
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,020
So I thought I could make it in.

648
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,900
And this is even before I became a VTuber,

649
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,580
like before I even was Rena.

650
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,740
So I just applied as myself, just normal me.

651
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Um, what gun did I shoot before?

652
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,820
I don't know.

653
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,540
I remember I shot a rifle.

654
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,340
Uh, it was like a type of rifle.

655
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:46,740
I don't know.

656
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,700
I can't remember that shit.

657
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,580
Just because I watch gun stuff doesn't mean I know what everything's about.

658
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,740
The SPO has the highest standards in industry because you have to be good at it.

659
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,340
But they're like, but then again, like think about who owns the SPO.

660
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,580
Or I was calling VISPO because it's fun.

661
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,580
Owns VESPA.

662
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,220
VISPO.

663
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,340
Um, Brave Group.

664
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,620
And Brave Group has already seen how successful that, um,

665
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,420
before Mariah and Globi are in their normal gens.

666
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,100
And I think I'm missing one, but I forget.

667
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,500
Um, there are a lot of FPS girls, girlies.

668
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,620
I don't know.

669
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,980
I'm like, maybe they're being trained.

670
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,180
Maybe they're, maybe they scrapped the project and focused on V for Mariah.

671
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,660
I don't know.

672
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,220
I don't know.

673
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:42,420
But, and I know like they want to do competitive gaming as well.

674
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,700
So, oh, thank you, boy, for the 10 gifted.

675
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,620
Oh, thank you very much.

676
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,340
Appreciate it.

677
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,260
You rise up.

678
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,420
But, um, yeah, sometimes.

679
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,140
And then actually, can we, can we just like talk about like VTubing stuff for a second?

680
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:04,900
Like, I'm not a, I'm someone who's very interested in the comings and goings of the

681
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,900
VTubing industry and community stuff.

682
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:19,220
And I tweeted yesterday as a joke, um, that I'm like, I'm going to hijack TVS.

683
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,100
Okay.

684
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,340
Things that VTubers say run by a false ID, uh, because he hasn't been covering small

685
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:31,620
Corpo stuff and only like needy shit and someone called like someone fucking tagged

686
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:37,540
him in it like he liked the tweet and I was like, lol, I was kidding.

687
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,980
Cause I'm going to make my own.

688
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,580
I like, I definitely want to make some of you.

689
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,220
I used to be a commentator, YouTuber.

690
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:53,140
Um, and I would like to do an unbiased, uh, what's it called, just like segment, not like

691
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:59,780
too long, just talking about smaller agency news, cause that's been sorely lacking for

692
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,300
the last little bit.

693
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,180
Um, so I feel like that would be fun.

694
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,580
Damn, you done it all.

695
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,220
Yeah.

696
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,340
Again, you guys, I said it before, I used to work for VTubing.

697
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,140
Um, I, this wouldn't be drama based.

698
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,660
I wouldn't, I would probably, uh, and I would also like look to you guys as like a resource.

699
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,140
I'm smacking my headphones, um, to like be like, oh, what do you think I should talk

700
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,700
about?

701
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,260
Or like maybe make him into shorts, um, just but like only focus on agency VTubers.

702
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,540
Cause I think that would be fun.

703
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,780
Um, and Shawnee was like, hell yeah.

704
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,060
And I was like, yeah.

705
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,460
And then Shawnee's been supporting a lot of my ideas lately.

706
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,260
And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like,

707
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,700
so I want to like think of a name and stuff and get that ball rolling.

708
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,260
I've been thinking about it before like back when I was Renna that I would do something

709
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:54,500
like that, um, but I would cover like all news, but as an indie, but now being agency,

710
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,180
I would rather just want to cover other like my agency and other agencies.

711
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,220
Um, I know that might be a conflict of interest.

712
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,260
I get that.

713
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,140
Um, but I would probably only like objectively just say like, hey, this is what's going on.

714
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,860
I'm not injecting feeling into it.

715
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,460
Um, so be sucky VTuber news.

716
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,220
Uh, should be news.

717
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,340
Yeah, if you count me in.

718
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,940
I'm going to have this TV, yeah.

719
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,020
Um, actually, I was very thankful he didn't cover us because I think we've got,

720
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,980
we've gotten more hate.

721
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:32,340
Um, I've said before that when him and other VTubers first covered us debuting or being

722
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,980
created in any mention of it, uh, they focused more in the negative comments

723
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,420
or assumptions of the company.

724
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:46,100
Um, and I feel like they might do the same if they covered us again, although because

725
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,620
he liked my tweet, I'm kind of worried.

726
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,780
I'm just like, oh, fuck, is he going to cover us for the next one?

727
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,500
So who knows?

728
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,500
Um, but whatever the fucking hat, no, it is what it is rabbit hole news.

729
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,500
Are you funny?

730
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,060
Um, but yeah.

731
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,580
And then I'm like, I can like, I can't do, I have to make drama to get on, but that's not

732
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,220
my goal.

733
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,580
I don't want to, I don't like drama.

734
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:17,380
I don't, um, I would, you could ask anybody that I'm friends with, uh, in the girls.

735
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,940
Like I'm someone who if I hear anything like whispers of unrest, I'm like, let's get to

736
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,500
the bottom of it.

737
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,700
Let's talk, let's do this.

738
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,260
What's going on?

739
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,300
Not that that hasn't even happened, but they just know I'm that type of person.

740
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,980
Um, there's not such a thing as bad publicity.

741
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:49,060
I think there is for our case, just because of the content we do, uh, I don't know.

742
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:55,860
Like I just feel like for us would be more of a detriment to our brand, but, and then

743
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,100
just show how unprofessional we are.

744
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:04,180
If I like, if we got into any sort of that stuff, um, sure drama alert girl.

745
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,900
Um, haters gonna hate.

746
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:07,940
Yeah.

747
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,300
And it's like, and it's bad if it messes with your mental health.

748
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,700
Yes.

749
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,260
I wouldn't want to, I'm like, I'm here to talk about what's happened.

750
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,900
I don't want to talk about how these two girls are bitching at each other because this,

751
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,860
this and that happened.

752
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,700
I'm going to say, yeah, I'm not, I don't care about that stuff.

753
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,780
It is disappointing when there's really never any updates on something that does

754
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,500
is negative.

755
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,380
Yeah, it is.

756
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:41,060
It's kind of a let down, uh, cause like I'm always someone who I'm like, celebrate the

757
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,940
little victories.

758
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:49,140
Um, and lately, anytime I look at something VTuber news related or VTuber related, um,

759
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,220
or like coverage of it, it's usually something negative and it makes me sad because there's

760
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,860
a bunch of like good things happening in the community every day.

761
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:06,260
Um, but then again, like that's not, the news doesn't report like the regular news doesn't

762
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,220
report unhappy things anymore either.

763
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,860
I don't even watch news, like actual like human news anymore because they don't report

764
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,740
on anything.

765
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:19,380
Like it's usually like tragedy or like something bad or the weather.

766
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:27,540
Um, so, and then I totally get why he would do that because Nidhi was up his ass.

767
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,900
He's like, let me go up his ass.

768
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,780
Let me go up their ass.

769
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,740
And I'm like, you know what?

770
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,220
I got it.

771
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:37,620
Um, but I liked to watch it when I was an indie so I could see what like kind of what

772
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,700
the tone was for agencies.

773
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:46,180
Um, and also like what indies were doing in the, in the VTuber community because I just,

774
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,260
I want to know everybody was up to, um, now I just don't watch any of it at all.

775
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,060
I just listened.

776
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,820
I like to listen to like video essays now about like things that have happened in the

777
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,220
past.

778
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,580
Um, I think that's interesting because I like to educate myself on VTuber history because

779
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,820
again, I've only been a VTuber for six months.

780
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:11,620
I've known and been part of the community and a consumer of VTubers since they, um,

781
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:18,660
since they've been around, um, since they started back like before in like 2019 or even

782
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,700
further than that.

783
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,900
But I never was like in it in it, you know, VTuber weather segment.

784
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,100
It'd be really funny.

785
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,380
I'm out in a weather segment.

786
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:37,060
I would just make makeup like random fake places and be like, it's currently sunny in

787
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,940
Topeka.

788
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,500
What is it?

789
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,940
It's raining in Topeka.

790
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,860
It was something like foster's home for measuring friends.

791
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:46,740
Um, hop, happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m.

792
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,180
Happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m.

793
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,700
With your hottie host, Sheebie.

794
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:58,020
I'd have to work on my transatlantic accent because I can't, um, it's, it would be hard to

795
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,140
because I need to do like the news voice.

796
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,980
And tonight we're expecting a light drizzle in Wonderland.

797
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,700
Later tonight at 6 p.m.

798
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,820
What is strongy shoving up her ass?

799
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,460
Oh my God.

800
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,020
Where are my mods?

801
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,100
They're gone.

802
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,220
They're like, she's late an hour.

803
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:29,860
I can't do it.

804
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,860
I'll do it myself.

805
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,580
I'll do it myself.

806
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,580
Tomorrow, it's going to be raining urine.

807
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,300
So make sure you have your umbrellas or open your mouth.

808
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,820
Um, sometimes I sound like I'm from a commercial and I do that.

809
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,340
Strongy catching strings.

810
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:01,220
Hey guys, can we not, can we stop talking about my investor in the chat?

811
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:01,860
Thank you.

812
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,420
Kisses.

813
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,660
Unnecessary speculation going on about where people are from, which is,

814
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,780
you don't need to know because it doesn't matter.

815
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,820
Just enjoy their content.

816
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,060
Um, that's a meme if I ever heard it.

817
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,620
The rabbit's foot segment goes, and it's just me stepping like just like heel clacking noises.

818
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,940
That'd be funny.

819
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,420
There is an Aurora Borealis localized entirely in Icy's kitchen.

820
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,620
How is she doing it?

821
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,860
Tonight at BunnyBun capacity, what's going into she being and how much?

822
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,500
That was good.

823
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,460
That was, that was good.

824
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,580
I'll give you that.

825
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,380
I'll give you that.

826
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,340
Okay.

827
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,220
Need a quick look back.

828
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:08,820
Oh, but, but, and then like also like, um, I would just, I just like to talk about VTubers.

829
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,780
Like it was cool.

830
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:15,060
I'm very excited to see the debuts for the new EN girls from Hall of Live.

831
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,780
I didn't anticipate for them, for there to be a new gen so soon.

832
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,620
I thought it was going to be a couple more months.

833
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,060
Um, although everybody had kind of already surmised who was going to be who, but you know,

834
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,260
like training and all that.

835
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:33,220
And I'm wondering if they were hired on or scouted previously because models don't

836
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,220
take a very long time to make unless they cranked them out because I know they have in-house people.

837
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,980
And they have obviously being Hall of Live have pulled in the industry.

838
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,860
But, um, uh, Raora Panthera, I can't pronounce anybody's names.

839
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,660
Please don't hurt me.

840
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,500
Raora Panthera, I love her design.

841
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,180
I love her concept is so true to her.

842
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,300
If you know who she is, uh, being an amazing artist and everything.

843
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,100
I really like the short stack.

844
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,460
Um, I feel like she'll be really silly.

845
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:08,660
And then I feel like Blood Flame, Elizabeth Rose Blood Flame is just

846
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,220
Narissa Red.

847
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,420
Narissa in red.

848
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,980
Um, so, but I like, I, everybody's, and then I was

849
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,340
chuckling at the automaton's last name, Immigrate.

850
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,540
And then I'm like, she kind of looks like mint, but they look amazing.

851
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,100
They look amazing.

852
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,540
Like, and she probably does plays violin or does some sort of music.

853
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:36,900
And so I can't wait to see the type of talents they'll possess and everything.

854
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,500
And just like, how fun they'll be.

855
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,140
I usually, I usually don't watch, um, Hollow Live or Niji just because

856
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,140
I don't want to fall in love again.

857
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:46,820
She worry.

858
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:53,300
Um, but, uh, it's, and it's also hard because you don't get the intimacy of a smaller

859
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,260
streamer in chat.

860
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,860
That's why I like smaller agencies.

861
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,100
And that's why my Oshi is in the smaller agency.

862
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,460
Um, so it's, yeah.

863
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,520
Yeah.

864
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,180
Trony does give us this Scorches style.

865
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,820
Yeah, my favorite is Rod Bunny is live.

866
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,220
How's it going?

867
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,180
We're going, we're doing all that.

868
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:10,680
Okay.

869
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,660
I'm agreeing.

870
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,700
Sounds like an intro.

871
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,220
Irma Gurd.

872
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,500
Everybody sounds like Irma Gurd names.

873
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,540
Yeah, that's true.

874
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,180
That's funny.

875
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:27,700
Um, yeah, just, it's, it's, it just stay, and you can usually only

876
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,500
communicate through like, text-to-speech donations.

877
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,860
Um, which is funny because it makes for amazing clips and everything.

878
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,460
And people write some really funny shit, but like, I like this.

879
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,180
I can read chat.

880
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,420
I honestly probably know all of you.

881
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,340
It's like, right now I don't really see a lot of unfamiliar faces.

882
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,700
So I have my regulars.

883
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,700
And so it's very nice to have a closer intimate fan base.

884
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,740
Who is my Oshi?

885
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,620
You don't need to know.

886
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,740
That's for me to know and you to never to find out.

887
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,460
She's mine.

888
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,740
I'm gatekeeping her.

889
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,460
Okay.

890
00:53:59,460 --> 00:53:59,940
Thank you.

891
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,420
Um, model actually is a violin, plays a bassoon, calling it now.

892
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,620
I bet she's multi-talented.

893
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,300
I bet she can like, play piano and stuff.

894
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,060
Um, name a salt.

895
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,060
Well, I'm not going to read your names right now.

896
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,820
Oh wait, I see a new name.

897
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,020
You must be a lurker.

898
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,460
But thank you guys.

899
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,340
If you're new and you remembered, um, I am, I do recognize a lot of you,

900
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,260
but so don't think I don't know who you are.

901
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,780
I appreciate all of you.

902
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,620
Especially my lurkers.

903
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,940
Because even though you don't talk, you're still watching.

904
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,380
You still got me in the background.

905
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,900
And I care about you for that.

906
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,780
Thank you.

907
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,340
Um, she remembers.

908
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,380
Um, I do be lurking though.

909
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,340
Yeah, that's fine.

910
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:46,820
I lurk.

911
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,580
I, I don't talk.

912
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,980
Wind streams.

913
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,700
Um, because like, I have like a whole alt account.

914
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,820
Like, not, not even like Rena.

915
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,260
Um, like I have like my own personal account that I like, I watch VTubers on.

916
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:02,900
And I just lurk.

917
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,700
I don't say anything.

918
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,340
Um, and like, yeah, I'm trying to think.

919
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,180
I think I only, the only time I ever talked was when Strawny,

920
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,780
Strawny was someplace else.

921
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,500
And that's, and like, that's how you like, I don't talk in streams.

922
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,660
And then she got me to want to talk in streams.

923
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,700
That's how amazing she is.

924
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:27,140
Yeah, and I usually have streams in the background too for background noise.

925
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,860
I know a lot of you guys do that or like, and because I know sometimes I stream

926
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,660
when people are working.

927
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,780
Um, so yeah, speaking of streaming, I haven't started the game yet,

928
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,420
but I kind of feel like yapping because this is going to be a long stream.

929
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:45,700
Um, I'm, maybe this will be an endurance stream, uh, just because, um, I love this game.

930
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,500
And I love spending time with you guys.

931
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,820
Um, I'm just ashamed of my green name status.

932
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,580
That's why I lurk.

933
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,420
Oh, yeah, hide yourself.

934
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,380
I don't show your face.

935
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,940
Gray name, terrible.

936
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,980
No, I'm kidding.

937
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:17,540
Um, but, uh, even if you're not green and your name is gray, don't think I don't appreciate you.

938
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,180
Um, I just appreciate you less now.

939
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,900
Ow, hurt my rib laughing like that.

940
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:30,020
Um, also, um, Immi, I think is going live right now.

941
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,820
So if you wanted to go see Immi, uh, I forget what she's playing,

942
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,100
but you can go check her out.

943
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:38,260
Um, her, her info is in my description as well.

944
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,540
Um, what build do you tend to go for?

945
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,140
I kind of just wing it every run.

946
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,260
I used to abuse the Orborus.

947
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,660
Oh, thank you for the 10 gifted authority.

948
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,060
Thank you.

949
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,580
Appreciate it.

950
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,900
Speaking of which, I don't know if anybody, I don't have my headphones on,

951
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,740
so I can't hear if somebody like don't know.

952
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:55,860
Let me look.

953
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,020
I need, I'm, I might get IEMs.

954
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,620
Um, what do I mean?

955
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,300
I remember what they're called, but like the essentially earbuds,

956
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,300
just because headphones with my glasses on hurt my ears.

957
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,420
They're the ones that these are in ear monitors.

958
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:16,660
Yeah.

959
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,260
Um,

960
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,460
You just get more spit from Georgia Tech U.

961
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,020
Um, but no, like if you show up, that's all that matters to me.

962
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:37,540
Um, I also decided because I'm starting to think it's causing

963
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,260
somewhere divide between everybody's fan bases.

964
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,860
I don't mind if you have somebody else's Oshimarks in your name.

965
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,340
I was doing it for Kayfabe, um, but I'm realizing I don't like,

966
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,780
like I'm pretending to be mad because you like somebody else.

967
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:01,700
It's you can like multiple streamers, especially ones in our gen.

968
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,500
Um, and yeah, I just

969
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,340
I don't know.

970
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,620
I've been here since be a lure first form on Twitter.

971
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,220
I feel like an old woman.

972
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,180
Can't wait to see you all grow and have the privilege of looking back on these streams.

973
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,860
Oh, yeah.

974
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,940
It's, I've been there since the beginning too.

975
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,140
So I'm right there with you, sis.

976
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,140
I can't see a new she beat.

977
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,260
It's for me, not you.

978
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,860
Keep it in the family.

979
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,260
Yeah.

980
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,300
Keep it in the family.

981
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,100
That's how what I'll say.

982
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,380
You can keep it in the family.

983
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,260
Although like, but it's funny because I'll like,

984
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,700
I'll see other people's Oh, she marks.

985
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,060
Like I think I saw like a Maya whispers and like she's a, oh my God,

986
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:47,060
a giant fucking June bug just landed on my window and scared the shit out of me.

987
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:47,540
Holy crap.

988
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,180
The thing is huge.

989
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,140
Um, staring at me.

990
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,140
But like, I like a Maya whisper.

991
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,620
She's a good, you know, as martyrs and stuff.

992
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,740
So I'm like, I don't really care.

993
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:04,340
Um, I just like, I just, I'm a type of person and I think that's why me and

994
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,660
strongy are so much alike that I'm like, just support everybody.

995
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,300
If you can do what you can.

996
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,460
If you want, cause you know, everybody's so talented.

997
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,740
Everybody's so cool.

998
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,900
Cause like, I love a lot of the other agency girls.

999
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,020
Again, I used to be indie.

1000
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:28,100
I followed and looked up to a lot of the people that are, yeah, but so I'm like, I can't be like,

1001
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,100
Oh my God, don't hate me.

1002
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,020
Don't, don't, don't stop.

1003
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,380
Can't love.

1004
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,340
You have to love me more.

1005
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:39,140
I just want you to love me more or less.

1006
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:48,740
Um, and I think, yeah, I think, I think it's a healthier mentality for me.

1007
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,340
Cause I do, I, I'll be honest with you.

1008
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:56,660
I do get jealous and I realize feeding into that mindset for me for kayfabe is,

1009
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,020
is actually not good for me.

1010
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:07,060
Um, cause I remember back when I was Rina, I would feel immense jealousy when something happens.

1011
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:11,460
And now I'm just like, no, I've kind of grown from that.

1012
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:18,740
Um, cause I'm just like, why am I upset that somebody else is supporting a streamer that I also enjoy?

1013
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:21,780
I'm like, fuck that.

1014
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,460
No, like that's, no.

1015
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:30,180
But, um, again, and another thing, cause I was asking Mercy to explain it to me.

1016
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:35,140
Um, because I know she, she, uh, she gets bothered by stuff.

1017
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:40,340
Um, so she was explaining to, I smacked my mic, explaining to me like, oh, she culture,

1018
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,620
like, and what, how, what oh, she's mean and commie.

1019
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:48,340
Not that I didn't know already, but just like on a deeper level, like really picking it apart

1020
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,500
and like telling me, so I really appreciated her to do that.

1021
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,380
Cause then I understand.

1022
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,940
I'm like, oh, I got it.

1023
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,660
I understand.

1024
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,140
I get it.

1025
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,340
Like not this.

1026
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,460
Thank you for explaining it to me.

1027
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,820
Um, don't want to put sugar in chat.

1028
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:07,380
I do, again, I, again, I do, if you, I do want you to be collared to me, but I can't force you to do that.

1029
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:12,900
Um, there's just she be only she be, and I've also kind of just decided and then like,

1030
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,500
cause I was talking to a straw knee and one of the managers about it too.

1031
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:31,620
Um, I think I put too much effort in stock into a kayfabe, um, which is my kayfabe is,

1032
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,780
you know, dummy mommy mistress.

1033
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,140
Oh, I'm going to step on you.

1034
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:45,300
When the reason I was hired was because of my voice and my personality.

1035
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:52,420
I wasn't, it's not like I'm acting and cast to play an actual character.

1036
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,700
That's not what V tubing is.

1037
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,900
Uh, it's like who's line is it anyway?

1038
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,100
Where the points don't matter.

1039
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,780
The kayfabe barely fucking matters only for like assets.

1040
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,820
A little bit of backstory for your appearance, vice versa.

1041
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:12,260
Um, kayfabe, if you don't know is a wrestling term, which is like your lore, your backstory,

1042
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,660
your history of their character that you play.

1043
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:21,380
Um, and I was just, and this might filter some people and that's fine.

1044
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:27,460
And I was talking to strongy and one of the managers about it and I was just like, I had,

1045
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:32,740
I said to her, I'm like, I realized the other day because I was having so much imposter syndrome

1046
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,820
because I was like getting so worked up that I wasn't good enough to be she be.

1047
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,580
And then strong is like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, shut up.

1048
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:43,940
Like you were always meant to be she be you were my she be.

1049
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:48,260
I didn't pick you because you could be a dummy mommy because I wasn't.

1050
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:55,540
If you guys don't know who I was, I was Rina who was a fucking lolly sub bitch brown cat.

1051
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,700
Like I'm total opposite of me.

1052
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,900
She's like, I picked you for you.

1053
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,820
And I'm like, you know what?

1054
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,700
And that goes for the other girls.

1055
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,900
She picked us for us, not the characters we play.

1056
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:11,140
But like I enjoy playing into the dummy mommy.

1057
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,180
Like don't don't get me wrong.

1058
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,380
I do like doing that.

1059
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:20,180
Um, because I do like, you know, getting you guys little riles up.

1060
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:27,220
Oh, um, and I was just like, you know what?

1061
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:27,780
You're fucking right.

1062
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:34,020
I'm not going to have imposter syndrome anymore because she picked me out of hundreds of other

1063
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,660
people just because I'm a goofy motherfucker.

1064
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:36,980
Okay.

1065
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,220
She watched, she sat down and watched my streams.

1066
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,300
The team that she hired also like she selected me and then she went to the team was like,

1067
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,100
what do you guys think?

1068
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,380
And they're like, oh yeah, 100%.

1069
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,260
She's our first choice.

1070
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:53,540
So at the end of the day, I'm just going to be me.

1071
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,380
You'll get dumb.

1072
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,260
You'll get girl fail.

1073
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:56,740
You'll get this.

1074
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,220
You get that.

1075
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:00,420
Um, and that's made me feel so much more better.

1076
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:01,780
Just real.

1077
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:07,540
I'm like, and it's funny because nobody fucking cares about kayfabe in the VTuber community,

1078
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,660
except lately for us.

1079
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,180
I'm like, nobody usually cares about fucking lore.

1080
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,740
But suddenly everybody cares about us.

1081
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,260
Stick it to our fucking lore.

1082
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:17,540
You can't see.

1083
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,780
I'm shaking my hands, leaning back.

1084
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:28,340
Um, and yeah, I'm like, I'm just, and I'm not saying this because like I'm angry or anything.

1085
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,900
I'm just saying this because like I've come to the realization.

1086
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:37,700
Like I, I'm becoming more comfortable being she be like, I feel like she's me now

1087
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,260
because I'm acting as myself.

1088
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:43,220
I'm not pretending to be someone I'm not because then you just get burnt out and you

1089
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,260
just get unhappy.

1090
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:48,500
And that's where a lot of VTubers crash and burn is because they think they have to

1091
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,940
play an actual character when in fact they were just hired for their voice

1092
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:57,380
and for who they were in their content prior to being cast.

1093
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:03,780
Um, but yeah, uh, also new.

1094
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,900
Yeah, I'm new.

1095
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,020
Like, don't forget that I haven't finished VTuber for long.

1096
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:18,420
Um, for ABVTubers, it's not kfave, it's anti-tax, which are on my Patreon.

1097
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,740
Like you still get that stuff on my Patreon.

1098
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:30,340
Um, yeah, I think everybody shouldn't care that much about stuff because like, look at

1099
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,020
Icy, she's supposed to be a brat.

1100
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,380
She's so cute and sweet.

1101
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,100
That's fine.

1102
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,860
And then look at Amy, she was supposed to be the sweet and cute one and she's a brat.

1103
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:38,900
And that's great.

1104
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:47,700
And then Azura is, you know, she's like quirky, funny, um, giggly little goat.

1105
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:51,220
And she's not like, oh, my sweet little boy all the time.

1106
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:51,860
That's fine.

1107
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,980
And then like, you know, strongy is strongy.

1108
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,420
And then Mercy's Mercy.

1109
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,340
And like you guys fall in love with us because of us, not because of the,

1110
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,900
because of our pat, like our fake kfave, you know?

1111
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,340
And yeah, it's great.

1112
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:14,100
Like it's not even Gap Moe, like, because it doesn't matter that much because we were

1113
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,060
meant to be these people.

1114
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,980
Azura is also a brat.

1115
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,180
Ooh, I didn't know that.

1116
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,980
Like, oh yeah, we're, we're a wacky little gang.

1117
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,460
I'm just a funky little rabbit.

1118
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,540
Um, yeah.

1119
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,380
And the chemistry is authentic.

1120
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,100
Um, bad of anatomy.

1121
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,740
I added to my schedule next week a drawing stream.

1122
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,740
So I hope you guys will enjoy that.

1123
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,580
Um, yes.

1124
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:47,700
And it's like, I don't have to be that.

1125
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:52,500
That's, that's in the other content that's in the Patreon.

1126
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:59,540
And I don't want you guys to put so much pressure on yourselves or the girls to be

1127
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:03,220
like, oh, like, I know a lot of people don't watch me because they're like, oh,

1128
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,740
I'm not into hard fandom.

1129
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,940
But I'm like, I'm not doming the chat 24 seven.

1130
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:16,660
Like that's not like, give everybody a chance because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

1131
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:21,540
Like you probably are watching me right now saying, oh, I don't think I'd like one of the

1132
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,020
smaller girls because I like big jugs.

1133
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:29,060
Um, yeah, but like, Amy's funny as fuck.

1134
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,020
So go watch her.

1135
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,780
She's just as base as I am, if not more.

1136
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,220
I know she's definitely more than me.

1137
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:39,940
But, uh, yeah, just here to be entertained.

1138
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,300
Oops, all brass.

1139
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:48,900
Uh, but it's, it's like, is it?

1140
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,900
Yeah, you're supposed to be dominant, but you show up.

1141
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,140
No, no, no, I'm not supposed to be anything.

1142
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,100
I'm just supposed to be myself.

1143
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,020
And that's the mindset.

1144
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:05,380
I want to teach you guys is that all the girls are not supposed to be this, this, or that

1145
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,540
because of a kayfabe and like a character design.

1146
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,620
We're just us.

1147
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:18,900
I'm just she be and you're just can.

1148
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:30,500
Um, she's telling us by teaching us, but like, naturally, I'll still pull out like,

1149
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,220
you know, don't get it twisted.

1150
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:40,660
I still will beat you when you're naughty because I like that part of my kayfube.

1151
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,700
I like leaning into that.

1152
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,540
And the girls do like, do like leaning into different parts of theirs.

1153
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:51,380
Um, but I just wanted to make that distinction for everyone that we were hired to be us.

1154
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:57,300
And I don't want you to get so wrapped up, you, the viewer, you, the fan to get so wrapped up

1155
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:05,380
and want somebody, um, should be like due to their lore that you don't enjoy their, their,

1156
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,180
their content because you can enjoy.

1157
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:12,020
So like, I'm not gonna, let me, I'm trying to think of somebody.

1158
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:17,780
Uh, I'm not a huge fan of mystery novels.

1159
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,620
Does that mean I'm going to hate Amelia Watson?

1160
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:29,380
No, she's funny because she's, she'll play into stuff sometimes, but she's not constantly

1161
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:30,980
searching for mysteries.

1162
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,740
Um, who am I?

1163
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,380
I'm she be.

1164
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,260
I'm she be just me.

1165
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,060
You can find out who I am by watching me stream.

1166
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:42,740
You aren't enough.

1167
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,940
Atmospheric people make your mom jokes and such.

1168
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:46,660
That's what I like.

1169
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,300
I'm not big into Dom in general.

1170
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,140
And it's like how she be expresses herself.

1171
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,980
Yeah, exactly.

1172
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,340
I want you to watch me for me.

1173
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:03,300
Not because of the tags that are associated with my ASMR content on Patreon.

1174
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,420
You know, um, what do you mean she's not detective?

1175
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:16,100
The real mystery was the friend she made along the way.

1176
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:17,700
Oh, hi.

1177
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:22,580
Feeling like I can hire Amelia to find my dad.

1178
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:23,380
Oh my God.

1179
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,300
Oh, really?

1180
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,580
I can find your mom in these.

1181
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,940
Your mom.

1182
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,740
I like listening to your voices soothing.

1183
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,940
Yeah, I'm a yapper.

1184
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,980
I'm a yappiest yabbit in all the West.

1185
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,620
I mean, you don't own a brothel.

1186
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,260
No, I do.

1187
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,500
Don't, that's actually real.

1188
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:41,700
Sorry.

1189
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,420
But please, in short, give all the girls a chance.

1190
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:53,380
Just because you don't like a certain tag doesn't mean you won't enjoy their content.

1191
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,580
Because we're all just cute girls doing cute things.

1192
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:00,740
And I would hate for you to miss out on cute girls being cute.

1193
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:03,540
You know?

1194
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:11,060
If you have another Oshimark besides Madams,

1195
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:11,940
nook if you book.

1196
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,860
Nook if you book.

1197
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,340
Right.

1198
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,300
No, if you book.

1199
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,900
Instantly plays.

1200
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,780
Get ready.

1201
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,300
Thank you for the tip, Anonymous.

1202
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,540
I think when I see somebody else's Oshimark, I just know that

1203
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:34,660
you are really passionate about other creators.

1204
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,460
And I know you still like me.

1205
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:46,900
And I've learned not to take personally that you like us in different ways.

1206
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:52,180
And there's only so many characters you can do to put in somebody's name.

1207
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,660
I see people with a bazillion Oshimarks in their name.

1208
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:57,540
It looks fucking cluttered.

1209
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,980
So I get it if you just want one.

1210
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:03,780
Because then I recognize the majority of them.

1211
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,540
Like there's one that's Azura's.

1212
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,420
And I'm like, yeah, I love Azura.

1213
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,220
Or if it was somebody else.

1214
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,260
Oh, yeah, I see Stroneys.

1215
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,140
Yeah, I love Stroneys.

1216
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,980
Or if it was like some girl from Pixelink.

1217
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,380
Oh, yeah, I love Kana.

1218
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:19,780
You know?

1219
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,540
It's yeah, so nice knowing people support my friends.

1220
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,660
That's all I care about.

1221
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,660
I am the type of person as a streamer that if I ever got like

1222
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:33,540
blew the fuck up, I would be doing everything in my power.

1223
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,100
Literally.

1224
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,260
This is why I want to join a vealer because

1225
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,260
Stroneys doing exactly what I wanted to do.

1226
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,460
I'm like, I just want to raise up smaller creators to a bigger platform

1227
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,500
and support them and give them stuff so they can do whatever they want.

1228
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,300
And have a great time and chase their creative dreams.

1229
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,500
That's what I would fucking want too.

1230
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,180
What if you don't like Lawley?

1231
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,220
I don't know what to tell you.

1232
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:00,900
Uh.

1233
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:04,660
Start liking them.

1234
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:07,620
I don't know if you don't like the body type.

1235
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:12,020
It's like, yeah, people don't like, I won't watch some streamers

1236
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,540
because I don't like the art style of their model.

1237
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:14,980
So I totally get that.

1238
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,780
I'm like, I'm not into super Western eyes.

1239
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:21,380
Like mine's a little bit Western, but not too much art styles.

1240
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,500
So like, that's fine.

1241
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,860
I'm not going to fuck them.

1242
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:30,900
Yeah, but like, I used to also not like that type of body type model

1243
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,540
than I watched.

1244
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,380
Uh, who was it?

1245
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,540
I forget who it was.

1246
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,060
What the fuck was it?

1247
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,180
Are they graduate?

1248
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,780
I think they graduated and that's my camera.

1249
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,700
They're on the top of my head because I haven't watched them in a while.

1250
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,700
But then I was like, oh my God, wait, this bitch is funny.

1251
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,740
Oh, she's a really good voice actress.

1252
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,300
And I like wondered how like people sometimes, you know,

1253
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,820
girls put on voices and some don't.

1254
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:02,340
I'm like, wow, um, all that stuff.

1255
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:07,780
I don't watch almost all male vTubers because of the same reason

1256
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:09,300
I can still watch some of their funny and nice.

1257
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:09,460
Yeah.

1258
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:14,980
I usually don't watch male vTubers, uh, because I just can't really,

1259
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,900
I just can't really, um, what's it called?

1260
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:28,740
Relate to them because I like, some of them have like really bro streams.

1261
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,700
Um, so I'm just like, this is for them.

1262
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,140
This is for the, this is for the bros.

1263
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,180
You're like, this isn't for me.

1264
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:41,620
Um, and then some of them are also very BFE, which makes me cringe out of my fucking mind.

1265
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:46,180
But like, I've watched like one or two clips, but it just isn't for me.

1266
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,380
But everybody has their preferences.

1267
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,140
You're allowed, you're allowed preferences.

1268
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,140
Um, skill issue.

1269
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,340
If you don't like that.

1270
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,180
That's funny.

1271
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:02,260
There's this difference between a vTuber with a small frame and lolly little for me.

1272
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:02,500
Yeah.

1273
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,380
There's also that.

1274
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:04,980
I agree.

1275
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:11,540
Cause like, I look at like, uh, Amy Asami and she's not, she's like small, but she's not lolly.

1276
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:16,020
You know, like, I was like looking at pretty lady.

1277
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,700
I know I prefer to look at pretty ladies.

1278
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,740
And also, I'll be honest with you, another reason I don't watch male vTubers

1279
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:27,140
is because, um, they are so limited in their outfits and they're rigging.

1280
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:34,420
Like I'm sorry, but I've seen so much better rigging for female vTubers.

1281
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:39,540
And because like just the movement of female vTubers, I don't know what it is.

1282
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:44,100
It's just, it's just different and men are like the male vTubers usually very stiff.

1283
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:49,220
Um, I've seen a couple with really good rigs because like I'm someone who I look at when I

1284
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:54,580
watch a streamer, I appreciate the art, uh, behind it all, like in terms of the actual art

1285
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,220
and the rigging.

1286
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:03,380
Um, and a lot of male vTubers just fucking don't have good fucking rigging or they also

1287
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,220
have like really boring ass toggles.

1288
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,980
So I'm sorry.

1289
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:13,140
Male vTubers don't, don't, don't cover my neck please.

1290
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,300
Bald physics.

1291
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,580
So when, yeah, when we get the best designs, I'm like,

1292
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,620
I'm tired.

1293
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,940
I'm seeing the same fucking, fucking Ikemen, Ikemen.

1294
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,060
I can't pronounce it.

1295
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:25,860
You can make fun of me.

1296
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,260
It's fine.

1297
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,940
Style.

1298
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:30,740
Like you all dress the same in different fonts.

1299
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:32,660
I'm done.

1300
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:33,860
Thank you.

1301
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,980
Enjoy the, enjoy those emotes, girly pop.

1302
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:43,220
Um, can't really watch you vTubers.

1303
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,820
vTubers is not my cup of tea.

1304
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,580
Brother, what are you doing here?

1305
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:47,540
What are you, what are you doing?

1306
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,980
This, this agency.

1307
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,740
Brother, I think you're lost.

1308
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:56,820
Um, it's just like in video games, female characters always look better.

1309
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:57,620
Yeah, literally.

1310
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,940
No, that's why so many dudes just play female characters.

1311
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,340
My dad will play female characters when he plays games.

1312
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,580
And I remember, I remember like, I'll just like be ragging on them for it.

1313
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:07,140
I'm like, dad, why are you this chick with big titties?

1314
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,820
He's like, because she got big titties.

1315
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:11,620
And I'm like, look at her and she's dressed way better.

1316
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,020
Look at all the dudes skins versus the girl skins.

1317
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,340
And I'm like, you know what, you're fucking right, dad.

1318
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:22,500
Um, Facebook shop blocks go hard.

1319
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,580
We were hot men in games.

1320
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,300
It'd be that simple.

1321
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,500
It'd be that simple.

1322
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:36,740
If I can create a kid.

1323
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,980
Yeah, women have like so much funner's things.

1324
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:41,620
Like I remember when I played Baldur's Gate for the first time,

1325
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,380
I was like, okay, I'll make a girl and a boy.

1326
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,060
Baldur's Gate 3.

1327
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:45,780
So I made a girl.

1328
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:52,820
She was just really cute, like, elven, for like dark, for like,

1329
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,340
I can't fucking remember what I made her.

1330
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,740
But she was like tan skin, bright red hair, freckles,

1331
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:03,620
really cool, like tattoos, all this other shit, like makeup, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1332
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,620
And then I went to the do the dude and I'm like,

1333
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:08,420
okay, I can do beard one, two, three, four, five.

1334
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:10,180
I can change the eye color.

1335
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,140
I can give him a scar.

1336
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,820
Women pretty.

1337
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,860
Dress up is, I love dressing up like in like games,

1338
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,980
like I'll usually take like, I take forever.

1339
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,660
The majority of me playing Elden Ring,

1340
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,620
probably like 50 of those hours is me just like trying to look pretty.

1341
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,620
Men get toothpick or burly.

1342
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,060
Literally, literally though.

1343
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,220
I'm picking guys too, but the options be limited.

1344
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,100
Whenever it comes to RPG stuff, I always make a male, female,

1345
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,340
self-insert, but I often play the female character more often,

1346
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,060
even though I'm a guy.

1347
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,580
Yeah, it's just more appealing to look at.

1348
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,260
And like, I'll like growing up, I usually played a lot of male characters,

1349
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:55,140
just because I didn't like being pointed out,

1350
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:58,100
being female and just kind of like griefed in, in games and stuff.

1351
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:02,980
And I'll be honest with you, I probably made the same character over and over and over again,

1352
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,060
just some emo looking dude.

1353
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,420
Some emo like looking twink was my character throughout the years.

1354
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:14,420
I'm just like black hair, eyes, some gothy looking outfit in your golden.

1355
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:15,940
And that's what I did.

1356
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,300
And then I did it because I didn't want to play a female and be all like,

1357
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,660
and be the center of attention.

1358
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,380
Oh gee, can you date me?

1359
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:29,460
Literally though, literally, I would just get like, oh, I just, I couldn't.

1360
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,180
And that's why I like, I didn't, I didn't, I wouldn't talk in like, game lobbies.

1361
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:35,780
The same reason too.

1362
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,700
We need she be to play Stila Blade.

1363
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,900
You just want me to drool in like, the entire time.

1364
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,100
Ah, so Shibani is, she'd be his ideal man.

1365
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:46,900
Are you a girl?

1366
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,380
Or just like people be like, hey, let's be friends.

1367
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,500
And then they try to like, just like,

1368
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,820
E-sexing you up.

1369
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,260
Oh, we'll have some straights this mail.

1370
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:08,100
Um, just be so cool.

1371
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:15,380
I remember people used to say, uh, call like, say grill, like G-R-I-L-L.

1372
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:20,500
Cause I think, or like, man, like I would play Wolf Quest.

1373
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,060
And which I'm going to be playing next week as well.

1374
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,660
We're playing fucking Wolf Quest.

1375
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,820
And we're going to go find a mate and have puppies.

1376
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:33,540
And, um, and, uh, people would say grail, grill.

1377
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:36,980
As in like cook, as like mail, as in like M-A-I-L.

1378
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:39,300
Cause people kept asking about it.

1379
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,740
And they would just do, to fucking so much E-sex and Wolf Quest.

1380
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,380
I used to say I was a boy in every game straight out.

1381
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,780
Cause I was like, yes, literally, four gets it.

1382
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,340
A hundred percent.

1383
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,020
I would literally just do that.

1384
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:59,060
I remember I went by like a mail version of my IRL name.

1385
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,300
And I remember I had the girlies still fucking falling for me though.

1386
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,660
You know, nobody can, I need a, I need a lip bite toggle.

1387
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,180
And we have to ask mom for that.

1388
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,380
Mom, can I, can I get a lip bite toggle?

1389
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:22,340
So I could be like, wait, can I, no, I can't do anything similar.

1390
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,460
Shaboris.

1391
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,060
Yeah, I was Shaboris all the time.

1392
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,620
Insane aura.

1393
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,700
And uh, yeah, it was just, it was just easier.

1394
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,860
And then I would have to tell the girlies.

1395
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:37,860
They'll be like, why don't you get a voice call with me?

1396
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,940
And I'm like, types out, sorry babe.

1397
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,580
Uh, I'm too shy.

1398
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,260
Yeah, I remember I was like, I'm guy on the line as a dude for a bit.

1399
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,060
And I was a girl.

1400
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,500
How many female moms?

1401
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,300
Mike doesn't work.

1402
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,660
Sorry, my mic's broken.

1403
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,300
Baby case.

1404
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:08,420
Oh, if I was a dude or if I was a lesbian, I would be a fucking menace to society.

1405
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,500
I would be a womanizer.

1406
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,860
I just feel like I would be the shittiest fucking dude.

1407
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:19,860
I would just be the opposite because like me, I'm a very sweet, very caring,

1408
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,740
I'm a very affectionate, lovable person if I really like you.

1409
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,540
I am very protective over people that I care about,

1410
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,100
but I just feel like if I was a dude, I'd just be a piece of shit.

1411
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,860
I would definitely be an F boy.

1412
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,860
I think I would be a fuck boy.

1413
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,620
Hey, you wanna be my discord kid?

1414
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:48,660
I would love to see my hands as a necklace around your neck, baby girl.

1415
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:54,740
Some pictures of your asshole.

1416
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,780
Can you mail for me, kitten?

1417
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,420
Dad actually, no, I'm above that.

1418
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,100
Tom boy, she be when I'm already a tomboy.

1419
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,660
I think, I think I am in my tomboy.

1420
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:24,180
I don't know.

1421
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:29,060
I was like very, again, growing up, I was always taller than all the boys

1422
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:31,220
and I've always been very, very fucking strong.

1423
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:38,740
I remember one time I was playing basketball with these kids and I don't know why I did this,

1424
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:45,540
but I picked one of the guys up off the ground and I threw him back down

1425
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:50,980
to get the basketball from him and he started crying and I called him a little bitch.

1426
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,340
And I'm like, why are you crying?

1427
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:59,620
And then he's just like, and I was like, we were like 14.

1428
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,980
It's not like we were like seven.

1429
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,260
It's like we were like 14.

1430
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,540
And I like chucked him.

1431
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:12,100
And then I also used to play a lot of football at my after school program

1432
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,020
because we had a lot of sports there.

1433
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:18,020
So it was very like my after school program was very athletic.

1434
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,660
And so we would play football.

1435
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:24,740
I would be fucking mowing down the boys in my grade.

1436
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:26,500
American football.

1437
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:26,740
Yes.

1438
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:28,500
And soccer too.

1439
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,420
And you know, European football.

1440
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,860
I would be mowing down motherfuckers.

1441
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,260
I wasn't a bully.

1442
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:36,980
I wasn't a bully.

1443
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,580
I was just bigger and stronger than people.

1444
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,860
I can't help it.

1445
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,300
I would fucking everybody.

1446
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,100
I was like five, six at age 14.

1447
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:44,980
What do you want me to do?

1448
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:46,180
I'm sorry.

1449
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,740
All you bros were fucking five feet tall.

1450
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:50,740
What do you expect me to do?

1451
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,820
I'm going to fucking roundhouse kick you to the face.

1452
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,100
I'm five, six.

1453
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:58,980
I'm taller than you.

1454
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,220
Bro, I'm five, eight.

1455
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,620
I'm so sorry.

1456
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,140
Have you stiff arm?

1457
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:07,860
I don't know what that means.

1458
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,900
Like, I don't know what that means actually.

1459
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:16,020
They're five feet and 14 at their time.

1460
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,500
Flexing female puberty.

1461
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,620
It's true though.

1462
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,180
It's true.

1463
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,700
I remember I was like, how old was I?

1464
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,900
Because you start, you go through puberty

1465
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,540
when you get your period.

1466
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,260
I think I was like 12.

1467
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:31,220
One.

1468
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:36,100
I had fucking C cups at 14.

1469
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:40,500
My parents were concerned.

1470
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,340
Again, I was also five, six at that age.

1471
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,940
My family was very concerned.

1472
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,460
So they took me to the doctor and they were like, oh,

1473
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:53,620
she needs to stop drinking milk because I was drinking,

1474
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:56,980
like the milk I was drinking, I think it still happens to kids,

1475
01:25:56,980 --> 01:26:00,500
but they have so many hormones in them that I grew up way too fast.

1476
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,020
They, if I didn't stop drinking milk, they said the hormones in the milk,

1477
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:07,220
I would have been, they said I would have been like six feet tall.

1478
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:11,540
I was, I was growing too fast.

1479
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:15,140
I was, I was in so much pain because I was growing too fast.

1480
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,700
Five, 11 at 14, six foot two.

1481
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,220
See, okay, you're like, that's fine.

1482
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:27,860
They said, oh, she's going to be either from five, nine to six, four

1483
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,900
when they're like estimating my height.

1484
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:35,460
My mom is five, five and my dad is six, four.

1485
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,700
And then my mom was just like, oh God.

1486
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,980
And then my dad's like, I can teach her to ball

1487
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,220
because my dad was a basketball coach.

1488
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,020
I can't do basketball.

1489
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,380
I fucking suck at basketball.

1490
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:52,100
I preferred, I preferred like football or soccer for sports.

1491
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:55,620
And everybody would always ask like, oh, you play ball.

1492
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:56,580
Oh, you must play ball.

1493
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,100
You so to, oh, you're only 14.

1494
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:58,820
You must play ball.

1495
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,540
I'm like, no, no, brother.

1496
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:05,140
I don't, I fucking suck.

1497
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,180
I can run fast.

1498
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:10,980
And like my dad was, I swear my dad was sort of supportive

1499
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,460
because I couldn't play basketball because again,

1500
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:18,100
my dad was like, what was it?

1501
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,180
Like a heist, I have to look it up.

1502
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,740
Like an amateur league basketball coach.

1503
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,940
My dad was good at it too.

1504
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,100
Have you juked anyone out in football?

1505
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,980
A hundred percent.

1506
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:30,500
A hundred percent.

1507
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,620
I had the tightest fucking turns, bro.

1508
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:34,740
Tight.

1509
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,380
Whippin' that shit, bro.

1510
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,740
How rich I school interaction.

1511
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:45,940
But it's funny because like, I was like, I was,

1512
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:47,620
I had like a sleeper built.

1513
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,620
I had a sleeper built.

1514
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,780
I was tall.

1515
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:52,980
I was skinny as fuck.

1516
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,220
You're like, oh, she can't be strong.

1517
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:55,460
No.

1518
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,420
I'm chucking you across the room.

1519
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,020
I'm chucking you across the field.

1520
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,460
I'm sending you home crying to your mom

1521
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,180
because apparently I'm playing too rough with the kids

1522
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,700
because I don't know my own strength.

1523
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:06,100
Listen.

1524
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,460
And like, also I was super fucking shy.

1525
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,820
But then like, I got this like animalistic

1526
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:20,980
for feralness about me when I would play sports.

1527
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,500
And then, and same thing, same thing with fucking jujitsu.

1528
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,980
Dudes would be like, because it was a co-ed school.

1529
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:32,580
I couldn't roll.

1530
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:35,620
I didn't roll with a lot of the girls because uh,

1531
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,620
well, some of the girls didn't want to roll with me

1532
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,740
because I was just, I was just stronger.

1533
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:47,620
Um, but like not, not that you can't submit somebody,

1534
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:49,620
but when you're learning, it's not fair.

1535
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,620
Cause then at that point, you don't have the skill

1536
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,140
to beat someone stronger than you.

1537
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:56,580
So I would have to roll with the guys

1538
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,700
or people have a higher belt.

1539
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,460
Just because I would just hold you there.

1540
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:02,980
Like I, I was strong enough, especially my fucking legs.

1541
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:06,180
I would just hold you there and just let you squirm,

1542
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,580
squeeze you between my legs.

1543
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,940
You try to get out, but I'm going to comeore you

1544
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:12,980
or a more economy you.

1545
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,740
I'm, I'm sorry.

1546
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,660
You know, you're in my guard.

1547
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,420
I could still do that if you're in my guard.

1548
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,580
For free?

1549
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:25,460
For free?

1550
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:26,980
For free?

1551
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,660
I sound like I'm really fucking humble bragging though.

1552
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,500
I'm scared the pegging might be real.

1553
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,780
Um, maybe when we get fans late, I'll be loud.

1554
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,180
Cause people keep asking me, when are you gonna get a strap?

1555
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,100
And we just, do you want me to sit there

1556
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,180
like a fucking, how some dudes do it?

1557
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,180
How some dudes send, take pics and just be like,

1558
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:49,620
you like what you see.

1559
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,220
Do you like this angle?

1560
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,180
Do you like this?

1561
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,340
And I'm like, you want me to take pictures like that?

1562
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:55,060
What do you want me to do?

1563
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:57,620
Please test these moves on us.

1564
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:58,340
I beg of you.

1565
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:03,860
I'm sorry.

1566
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:08,260
Not that I don't like tributes, but

1567
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,500
or I should call them something else.

1568
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,740
Stroni said I needed to say code words for things.

1569
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:17,860
I should work on that.

1570
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:21,060
Um, not saying I don't like treats.

1571
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:22,820
The fuck is on my,

1572
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:25,780
the fuck is on my titty?

1573
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,780
I'm a fucking zit.

1574
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:32,100
Okay.

1575
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:32,660
Don't touch it.

1576
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:38,820
Um, not that, uh, I don't like like,

1577
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,140
like little treats that I get sent, but

1578
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:48,100
I'm like, I compare like the girlies on Twitter

1579
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,620
that be posting their pictures

1580
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,660
and then the dudes on Twitter

1581
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:53,620
that be posting their pictures.

1582
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,100
I'm sorry.

1583
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:54,740
Girls win.

1584
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,540
They're a lot more creative with their poses.

1585
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:01,220
Dudes just stand.

1586
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:02,420
I wish I could demonstrate.

1587
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:10,900
I also want to, um, I saw that

1588
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,060
Cottontail VA to the thing where, um,

1589
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,740
she like crushed a milk jug between your thighs.

1590
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,980
I definitely want to do that for like a milestone.

1591
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:22,580
Maybe when we hit 10 K, it's funny.

1592
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:25,300
Like, I just want to say like,

1593
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,620
literally my goal, one of the goals I put in my debut

1594
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:33,300
was hit 10 K subscribers and we're already at six K

1595
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,500
and I'm just like, what the fuck?

1596
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,580
I'm like, I expected to be at like 800 by now.

1597
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,820
She's a watermelon too.

1598
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:43,460
Oh shit.

1599
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:44,180
Okay.

1600
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,300
Man, I need to work out again.

1601
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:49,700
I've been, I've been, since I've been laid up at home,

1602
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:51,540
being depressed.

1603
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,500
I haven't, I haven't worked out.

1604
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,220
I need to, I need to do stretches.

1605
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:57,940
I need to get ready.

1606
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,860
I don't look at pics of dude on Twitter.

1607
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:06,100
Uh, neither do I, but the Twitter algorithm just fucking happens

1608
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,380
and shit just shows up.

1609
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:07,620
So

1610
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,340
he's hit 10 K right now.

1611
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:20,100
But yeah, I just, I'm just very thankful for the amount of growth

1612
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,460
that we've had as a company.

1613
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:24,820
It just boggles my mind to be honest.

1614
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:28,020
I didn't, not that I didn't believe that we could do it.

1615
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:33,140
I just didn't think just because of like negativity and coverage

1616
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:33,940
and all that stuff.

1617
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:37,780
I just didn't think people would enjoy us as much as they do

1618
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,740
and I'm so happy.

1619
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,540
How would you describe your peak build?

1620
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,140
Like Elden Ring?

1621
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:49,380
No, like on a partner or on myself?

1622
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:53,060
Because for me, I don't really care what you look like.

1623
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:58,100
I'm like, I would just want you to be healthy and be really funny.

1624
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:09,060
And then for myself, I would like B cup titties.

1625
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:13,620
And I would like to shrink my tummy a bit.

1626
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,180
That is it.

1627
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,420
Although if I could, I would look like lean beef patty,

1628
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,420
but my body type just won't allow that.

1629
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,220
Because like genetically, because like guys are like, oh, flat stomachs.

1630
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:32,020
Oh, like I'm like, I'm, I'm skinny, average size.

1631
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:36,580
But because of my genetics and being a woman, uh, people are like,

1632
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:42,740
you're fat because I have a little protective pouch of fat around my uterus.

1633
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:50,340
If I were to have a child, um, even my mom, who at my age was like 99 pounds,

1634
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:53,380
if not less than little, no, she was definitely like a hundred pounds

1635
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:57,220
and like five, five, she was sure as fuck and skinny as a fucking rail.

1636
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:01,220
She also didn't have a flat stomach because just genetically, she just had a little bump.

1637
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:03,220
Child makes it better.

1638
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,900
That's my, I agree with you.

1639
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:06,260
I agree.

1640
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,140
Squish is good.

1641
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:10,340
A little bit more hold on to, you know what I'm saying?

1642
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:12,500
Not that I don't enjoy like a skinnier build though.

1643
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:16,100
Like I, I honestly, I love the human form so much.

1644
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,860
Becoming so many shapes and sizes.

1645
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:18,740
It's gorgeous.

1646
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,300
I love it.

1647
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,940
Men and women appreciation in this house.

1648
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:24,420
Okay.

1649
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:24,980
You're cute.

1650
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:25,540
You're gorgeous.

1651
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:26,020
You're beautiful.

1652
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,540
Let me kiss you.

1653
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,300
I was going to say something else, but I can't say that.

1654
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,740
It doesn't even look bad based on your photos.

1655
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:35,220
Looks pretty.

1656
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:41,620
I can't, I know that you're like trying to compliment me, but that sounds weird.

1657
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:46,420
Yours don't even look that bad.

1658
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,780
I don't care how people think about my body type either way.

1659
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:02,580
One, because I'm a Vtuber, you're barely going to see it.

1660
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,660
That was just for the monetization milestone.

1661
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,580
I'm not cosplaying myself constantly.

1662
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:08,900
I'm sorry if you thought that you're going to see me

1663
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,900
blasting my, my kuchi-hu-ha on fans.

1664
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,100
Lee, that's not going to happen.

1665
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,140
No, it's only to use straight homeboy.

1666
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:21,300
I'm, you're going to, you're going to get the model.

1667
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:21,940
Oh hi, Rena.

1668
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:26,580
I mean, it's all right.

1669
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:28,500
Like it could be better.

1670
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,260
Like, I'm sorry.

1671
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,740
You're not going to see any real life content from me.

1672
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:36,500
I don't know about the other girls, but not from me.

1673
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,980
I'm here to make ASMR.

1674
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,020
I'm here to voice act.

1675
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:46,260
I'm here to be, you know, your girly pop or something.

1676
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,460
Don't only get to your head.

1677
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,980
I'm here to be your mistress.

1678
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:50,180
You don't make demands of madam.

1679
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,500
You get little treats now and then.

1680
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,780
I think anyone's complaining.

1681
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:56,340
Yeah.

1682
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,420
Because some people are like, oh, they're going to be like,

1683
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:00,180
the Emma G girls.

1684
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:02,900
No, we're, no, at least I'm not fucking doing that.

1685
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:06,020
It's hot though, but I'm sorry.

1686
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,340
And I'm not fucking my gen mates in an off collab.

1687
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:13,060
How does this weird business practice?

1688
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,740
I'm not a porn star.

1689
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,700
But what girls, there are other,

1690
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:22,580
there are Japanese AVTuber agencies that do that sort of content.

1691
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:23,860
And I don't knock them for it.

1692
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:26,100
I think it's fucking amazing that you get essentially

1693
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,140
as a porn star VTuber.

1694
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,020
Like that's fucking sick.

1695
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:33,380
But yeah, ruined.

1696
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:34,740
I'm going to have, guys,

1697
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,820
should I have a watermelon blueberry

1698
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,660
or the mystery color airhead?

1699
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,020
I also need to get a drink.

1700
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:40,740
Quite thirsty.

1701
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:44,260
Have you finished the main story for inscription yet?

1702
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,100
Bro, I didn't even start playing the game yet.

1703
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,540
We're just talking.

1704
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,660
I've been in inscription like three times.

1705
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,300
I just haven't done them on stream mystery.

1706
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,260
Mystery.

1707
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:57,300
Okay, we sing mystery.

1708
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:01,220
I'll do mystery, then I'll do watermelon

1709
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:02,420
because people are saying watermelon.

1710
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,580
Johnny's asking how long I'm streaming.

1711
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:13,620
Probably too late.

1712
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:15,380
Why does she message me?

1713
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:16,340
Hold on, okay, discord.

1714
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:27,540
Oh my God, a giant fucking.

1715
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,060
What is that?

1716
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,660
What is that fucking bug?

1717
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:31,300
I need to take a picture.

1718
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:31,700
Holy shit.

1719
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:32,260
What is this?

1720
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,060
Mind you, I know my bugs.

1721
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,260
I've never seen this before in my life.

1722
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:47,300
What are you?

1723
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:47,780
Hello?

1724
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,620
Okay, it looks like it has the body of a wasp.

1725
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:57,780
It was the head of an ant.

1726
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,980
It's very thin and narrow.

1727
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:01,620
I thought it was like a locus or something,

1728
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,060
but it's not a cricket.

1729
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,020
The legs are too small.

1730
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,580
What the fuck?

1731
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,060
I need to piss.

1732
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,740
I just choked on this fucking thing.

1733
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:26,340
I'm sorry.

1734
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,300
Okay, I'll respond to the letter.

1735
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,860
Um, the girl leaves for my collab tomorrow,

1736
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:45,300
like, hey, thumbnail.

1737
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,540
So I'll post something more later.

1738
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:49,700
Hi, Sheeby.

1739
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,900
Mom, I'd like to redirect here.

1740
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:51,780
You think you'd be...

1741
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,540
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1742
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:54,500
100%.

1743
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,020
I'm gonna be up for a couple hours.

1744
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:57,860
I gotta piss.

1745
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,420
Sorry, I'm gonna keep saying that until I go.

1746
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:04,580
Hmm.

1747
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:06,820
The watermelon's good.

1748
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:14,180
It might be a persic, wa.

1749
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:15,780
I don't know, it's so huge.

1750
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,260
It's probably...

1751
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,620
I'm trying to think of a comparison.

1752
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,220
Using my pill bottle.

1753
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:38,820
It's like, I have a 15 pro phone.

1754
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:40,740
It's like half the size...

1755
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:43,780
It's like, lengthwise, it's half the size of my phone.

1756
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,940
But it's super...

1757
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,140
I've never seen this butt before.

1758
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,180
It's staring at me.

1759
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,060
It's literally looking at me.

1760
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:56,100
I know it's looking at me.

1761
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,100
What the fuck are you, bro?

1762
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,140
I need to identify you.

1763
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,660
I can't see his waist.

1764
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,660
What are you doing, bitch?

1765
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:09,700
Stop staring at me.

1766
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,940
Staring at me because I'm not wearing pants.

1767
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,900
Remember, Plee comes from the club door.

1768
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:19,540
Let him inside?

1769
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:20,100
Okay, yeah.

1770
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:27,620
It has six legs, two long antennae, long narrow body, reddish,

1771
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:31,380
reddish-orange, ants moving like head,

1772
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:35,700
but doesn't have the jaws of an ant.

1773
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,180
It's like that.

1774
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:39,220
The head shape of the eyes.

1775
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,660
It looks like it's divided in three sections.

1776
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:46,340
You have the head, the middle section, and the body.

1777
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:49,620
But it's very little distinction between the main body

1778
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:51,700
and the latter part of the body.

1779
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,700
It literally just turned its head to look at me.

1780
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:54,900
It's literally looking at me.

1781
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:56,740
Why do you have so much self-awareness, bro?

1782
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:57,780
Stop.

1783
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:05,540
By the way, should we do a play on the weekends?

1784
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:05,940
Quick ball.

1785
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:09,380
I'm doing the UNO club.

1786
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:11,220
I might do a gorilla debating.

1787
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:13,860
I do realize I need to probably take breaks, though,

1788
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,660
like have a dig off.

1789
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:20,740
Do you need me to cover her cleavage?

1790
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,140
Oh, yes.

1791
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,980
Wait, did mommy read?

1792
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:27,700
Or is she just asking for like 20 minutes or not?

1793
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:29,140
But yeah.

1794
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,740
I need to do the corals, please.

1795
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:44,020
Orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange.

1796
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:44,900
Say what I really want.

1797
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:48,900
I'm sorry.

1798
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:57,380
Boats.

1799
01:41:59,060 --> 01:41:59,380
Back.

1800
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:02,900
Like a wasp.

1801
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:25,060
This literally looks like none of them.

1802
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:26,580
It looks like a wasp, but it isn't.

1803
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:36,100
This again, I'm sorry.

1804
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,220
I'm a very curious person.

1805
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:38,660
This is going to bother me if I don't figure out

1806
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,700
what the fuck this bug is.

1807
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:41,220
I like bugs.

1808
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,700
This one's giving me weird vibes.

1809
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,620
He just shat on my window.

1810
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:46,420
Maybe he's a shit.

1811
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:49,620
Maybe in room.

1812
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:52,500
Don't want to tell me who he is.

1813
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,620
Oh, he just flew away.

1814
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,020
Fuck.

1815
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,180
No, I need to study you.

1816
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:58,020
Maybe we're new form of insects.

1817
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,020
What the hell?

1818
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:02,420
Okay.

1819
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:07,300
Elden ring.

1820
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:10,020
Oh, that's right.

1821
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:10,660
It released today.

1822
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:13,060
I have to mute Elden Ring then on my

1823
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:16,900
excuse me, on my stream.

1824
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:19,060
I mean, on my Twitter.

1825
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:19,940
Don't want any spoilers.

1826
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:22,260
Let me take a photo and ask AI.

1827
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,060
I took a photo.

1828
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:27,940
I was going to show it to you guys,

1829
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:30,020
but it would expose where I actually know.

1830
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:42,660
So, I zoom in, hit top, crop that, and crop, crop, crop it, crop these.

1831
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,100
Fucking load.

1832
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:46,980
69.

1833
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:51,540
Nice.

1834
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,220
I'll post it later.

1835
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:55,860
Wait, can I?

1836
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,140
Look up bug.

1837
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,740
Up here.

1838
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:09,460
That one just like that.

1839
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:10,820
Again this one.

1840
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:14,820
Born-tales.

1841
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:25,380
Yes.

1842
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,420
A little bit lighter in this whole here.

1843
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:32,420
lighter in the color. It's in body shape.

1844
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:40,420
I like knowing things.

1845
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:24,420
If you don't f**king like that I talk, then go home.

1846
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:30,420
You don't have to watch. You can click off to show off your computer and walk away bro.

1847
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:44,420
I feel like yapping. I feel like I haven't yapped. I don't know why it feels like I haven't streamed when I streamed recently.

1848
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:52,420
I'm eating my last airhead.

1849
01:45:52,420 --> 01:46:08,420
They're mini airheads.

1850
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:16,420
I'm yapping some voices in my head.

1851
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:20,420
Yapping my heart's potential.

1852
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:26,420
I've been craving airheads lately so I got some.

1853
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:36,420
Usually I'm a gummy worm kind of gal, but they didn't have any of them.

1854
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:44,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

1855
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:58,420
I'm going on vacation. I'm going to leave you with this sh**.

1856
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:02,420
Thank you for becoming a member brother.

1857
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:10,420
I remember watching a video of somebody freeze drying those giant snake ones.

1858
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:14,420
I got some beef jerky. I also have some bueno.

1859
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:18,420
Oh wait, I guess I ate the bueno and I didn't remember. So that's a lie.

1860
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:24,420
I just have beef jerky next to me.

1861
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:28,420
You don't have a Twitter account?

1862
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:32,420
We give you so many f**king freebies on there.

1863
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:36,420
Because that's like us actually doing stuff.

1864
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:40,420
Whereas in the ASMR, well I don't know. Some of us might be actually doing stuff.

1865
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:44,420
But mostly the ASMR is just us recording the script.

1866
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:52,420
That's pure unfiltered real amateur audio on Twitter.

1867
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:56,420
It's not as she be streaming until she's an hour plus and so is the start of the game.

1868
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:00,420
Stop it! Stop!

1869
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:06,420
Stop complaining! Stop pointing it out!

1870
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:10,420
How do you learn how to growl?

1871
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:14,420
Whatever you do, don't eat the famous gamer gummy control.

1872
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:18,420
What is that? Almost said two hours. Now I'm going to yap for two hours.

1873
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:22,420
Well, I'm going to pee first.

Do you want me to drink seltzer water or a ginger ale? Either way, either one of them might be worth it

2048
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:18,900
Sage is interested so far. Yeah, your character is interesting. I'm wondering

2049
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:22,020
Like what her ulterior motives are

2050
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:24,540
To be honest

2051
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:29,860
It's like she definitely has one. I'm also cracking the fuck up. Wait. No, I can't say that I

2052
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:33,500
Don't want to spoil for anybody

2053
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:41,060
There's a character who talks when they're not supposed to and that character cracks me up

2054
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:43,860
Because I'm wondering who they are

2055
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:46,700
I

2056
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:58,020
Leave attachment humanity. Yeah, so something like she's like she's bored and wants to do something

2057
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,020
She's just on a whole other plane of existence

2058
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:10,940
How's the sauna I fucking laugh so hard at the sauna because I had just read the tweet someone tweeted at me saying

2059
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:15,780
I can't wait for you to enjoy the sauna scene and then I saw like I immediately looked up

2060
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:17,700
And then it was the door from the sauna

2061
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:25,580
I'm like, whoa, it's gonna be like hero gasm and then the fucking it's fucking nasty. I'm like, oh

02:09:04,220 --> 02:09:09,020
I didn't I didn't um start the session either. So that's why you guys can't do anything yet

2142
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:15,980
It's not recognizing the game as a game. It doesn't even show up as a window, which is weird

2143
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:21,100
Oh

We're just gonna do a regular run

2151
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:11,420
Challenge point requirement for challenge levels not met you will not advance to a higher challenge level or lock stuff

2152
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:15,180
You pass this run. That's fine. I just want to do normal run and then we'll do challenge levels

2153
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:23,740
It was ready for just challenging. I don't have my headphones on because I don't like wearing my headphones unless I need them

2154
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:27,500
Because they hurt my ears. Any headphones are my ears. Oh the ear ones

2155
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:36,700

2203
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:19,340
The bones of the ancient woman creaked and groaned as she approached

2204
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:23,980
With gently shaking hands she placed her offerings before you

2205
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:28,140
Uh, give me the rabbit one

2206

I love manipulating my rabbits

2207
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:36,700
The old woman collected her piece and shuffled off into the dock

2208
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:39,340
She doesn't say anything. So I'm just doing my narrator voice for her

02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:54,380
Oh wait, then I'm just gonna make this 200 and then I'll make this 200 and then I'll make this 100

2332
02:25:56,540 --> 02:25:59,740
Ha ha ha ha

2333
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:04,460
I don't know. I didn't really like look through these

2334
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:07,340
Like what they could do

2335
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:10,780
Excuse me

2336
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:22,380
Sounds like cow tipping

2337
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:26,300
Gotta put you in your place you right. Hey, we got a bat

2338
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:30,380
We got a raven egg and we got an alpha. I should have got that raven head

2339
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:35,260
Because then I would have actually no I can get the alpha because then I have the fuck of the wolf head

2340
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:38,940
Oh

2341
02:26:41,180 --> 02:26:43,820
I'm gonna keep going to a carver

2342
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:53,820
You came across a small group survivors faces. I'm wondering if I should have just played the normal game

2343
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:03,340
Oh

2344
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:05,660
I might do that actually

2345
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:13,180
Whose help do I want to raise?

2346
02:27:30,380 --> 02:27:32,380
I don't know sharks fine

2347
02:27:36,380 --> 02:27:39,820
I'm I'm good. No, I didn't mean to

2348
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:56,220
But with the Casey's mod everything goes on lock so like

2349
02:27:56,220 --> 02:28:02,220
I want people to see like the madness of the game

2350
02:28:08,780 --> 02:28:10,780
Yeah, why you keep giving me shit

2351
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:22,300
Yeah

2352
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:27,420
I'm waiting for you guys to kill me

2353
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:47,020
Depending what you put on the top and the bottom the totem, I think I actually you know what

2354
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:52,300
We're gonna play the the real game

2355
02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:05,820
Yeah

2356
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:11,660
We'll play the real game because it's good

2357
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:14,940
so

2358
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:18,700
Two hours and 30 minutes in is the real game folks

2359
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:27,660
In the beginning the world did not know cars

2360
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:32,460
That is until the day the scrap weight

2361
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:39,980
This isn't even the this isn't the beginning. This is not the beginning

2362
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:47,260
This is not the beginning

2363
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:52,060
Why is the second part?

2364
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:57,820
I can't even leave I can't yeah, this is act two hold on

2365
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:02,620
Let me out of here. Why am I a ginger?

2366
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:12,860
Okay, I want a brand new new game

2367
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:19,100
You know what we're just gonna I think because I'm running it from crowd control

2368
02:30:23,340 --> 02:30:28,620
Can I help you Fia she's like give me your jerky please mom give me your jerky

2369
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:38,780
It wasn't it doesn't look like there was a chapter select. I don't think so

2370
02:30:43,820 --> 02:30:45,820
Um

2371
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:53,340
Let me just use a letterbox and made a funny noise when he ran out of it

2372
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:15,100
Oh

2373
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:32,060
Yes

2374
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,420
Sorry, I'm doing stuff

2375
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:39,420
Okay

2376
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:41,820
Hold on

2377
02:31:43,580 --> 02:31:45,580
Again, I don't know why

2378
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:49,440
And I don't want to show the game

2379
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:02,780
Please

2380
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:05,900
I don't want you to miss the fun stuff

2381
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:08,700
I

2382
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:15,660
Yes, that's what I had to go back and um there was a chapter select

2383
02:32:19,980 --> 02:32:21,980
I

2384
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:24,460
Um

2385
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:30,140
Please fucking work

2386
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:34,460
Please I just want to

2387
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:38,380
Play inscription with my friends

2388
02:32:40,060 --> 02:32:42,060
In harem

2389
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:46,940
Oh my god, I'm literally

2390
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:55,180
Why doesn't this want to fucking capture just fucking captured please fucking capture

2391
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:11,820
I'm going to permit I'm going to permit I'm going to permit

2392
02:33:16,460 --> 02:33:20,140
Inscription.exe is not responding fuck me bro

2393
02:33:27,900 --> 02:33:29,900
So this because of this fucking thing

2394
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:35,020
Where'd the game go? Oh my god

2395
02:33:36,700 --> 02:33:41,100
Maybe I had the right idea with just yapping

2396
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:05,180
I love this game and I really just wanted to show it to everybody and it's not even loading

2397
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:12,060
Okay, I looks like I have to do a fucking display capture which I hate doing

2398
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:19,180
Whoa

2399
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:21,180
What the

2400
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:41,180
Dude that was I wish you guys could see the lightning that was just out my fucking window

2401
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:45,660
That was thunder

2402
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:51,100
And because it happens so fast it's definitely like you know if you know um

2403
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:55,180
You can measure like the distance is like the storm is away

2404
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:57,500
Oh my god

2405
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:59,500
The dark cloud

2406
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:03,500
Oh, yeah, I'm like it has to be like a mile away because I was so fast. It's like a second

2407
02:35:04,220 --> 02:35:08,780
If like if lightning hit strikes and then you wait you count the seconds

2408
02:35:08,780 --> 02:35:13,100
That's how many miles away the storm is and it was like a second after and then I look on my window

2409
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:15,660
In there the darkest clouds I've ever seen in my fucking life

2410
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:19,020
And my cat freaked out

2411
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:22,860
Um

2412
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:26,620
Baby are you okay?

2413
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:29,340
Hmm

2414
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:46,540
I think it's a scaredy cat so I have I just want to make sure you just let me get some water

2415
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:52,140
That was intense

2416
02:35:52,300 --> 02:35:58,300
That was that was crazy what the fuck oh man

2417
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:06,460
So it's something in your vicinity on fire now because oh no no no just because lightning strikes doesn't mean something's gonna be on fire

2418
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:10,940
It just it just flashed

2419
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:12,940
I

2420
02:36:19,020 --> 02:36:21,020
The best

2421
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:34,700
Last time I streamed inscription it went perfectly fine, so I don't know why the fuck this is doing this

2422
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:37,660
Stepping on litter

2423
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:39,660
My favorite thing to do

2424
02:36:41,900 --> 02:36:46,380
She me must now I'm wondering if I should actually like

2425
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:49,420
Wow those clouds are

2426
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:51,820
moving so fast

2427
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:56,940
Um, it's supposed to like thunder. I think tonight. I thought actually I thought it was supposed to be tomorrow

2428
02:36:57,500 --> 02:37:02,860
I'm wondering if it's safe for me to stream at all like streaming during a storm because I don't want to like if there's a power surge or some

2429
02:37:02,860 --> 02:37:03,900
shit

2430
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:05,900
A guy in my village got struck by

2431
02:37:06,780 --> 02:37:08,780
your village

2432
02:37:08,940 --> 02:37:14,700
Anyways got struck by lightning while stood outside his house because he was holding a kitchen knife. You're the window. That's terrifying

2433
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,980
No

2434
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:31,420
Wait, what if I do this?

2435
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:38,380
Oh

2436
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:40,380
Okay

2437
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:47,580
I might cut the vod

2438
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:51,180
No, I'm kidding

2439
02:37:56,540 --> 02:37:58,540
I'm only gonna play the first phase

2440
02:37:59,820 --> 02:38:02,460
The first I'm only playing the first act. I'm not playing the whole game

2441
02:38:08,380 --> 02:38:10,380
I

2442
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:26,540
Another challenger

2443
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:34,300
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm overriding. I'm overriding the mandem voice. We're gonna do the lolly voice

2444
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:42,380
Another challenger. It's been ages

2445
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:47,660
Perhaps you have forgotten how this game is played

2446
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:50,940
Allow me to remind you

2447
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:58,380
Freaky uh car game play the squirrel card

2448
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:03,660
Now play your stote

2449
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:06,620
Oh

2450
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:09,180
I didn't catch that

2451
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:18,060
Wolves require two sacrifices. You don't have enough bring the bell to end your turn in commence combat

2452
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:29,020
Your stote stands on the post the number on the bottom left is attack power one

2453
02:39:33,660 --> 02:39:37,180
Your stote don't mean one damage. I added it to the scale

2454
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:40,140
It's getting really fucking dark outside

2455
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:44,620
If you win you win if you tip my side all the way down

2456
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:50,540
Like this

2457
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:53,420
My turn

2458
02:39:54,300 --> 02:39:56,300
Yes, we just started playing

2459
02:39:57,260 --> 02:40:00,380
Okay, a little pookie bear is a Greek

2460
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:02,620
Coach

2461
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:04,940
Stoats annoying as fuck

2462
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:07,920
Your stote stands in the way of my coyote

2463
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:12,060
My coyote dealt two damage to your stote

2464
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:15,260
That means your stote's health is now too less

2465
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:19,260
If a creature's health reaches zero it dies

2466
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:23,020
It's your turn again

2467
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:26,860
You may draw from your deck or you may draw a squirrel

2468
02:40:27,580 --> 02:40:29,580
Oh

2469
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:31,820
How dull

2470
02:40:33,100 --> 02:40:35,100
Well

2471
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:39,260
Wolves demand two sacrifices

2472
02:40:41,980 --> 02:40:45,980
I thought I turned off crowd control

2473
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:51,820
I guess I didn't

2474
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:56,140
How did that even happen?

2475
02:40:56,380 --> 02:41:00,220
I closed the fuck I literally closed hold on

2476
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:09,500
Oh, it literally says are you sure I didn't click yes

2477
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:13,660
No, we'll keep it open. We'll keep it open

2478
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:17,420
What is how oh my god

2479
02:41:19,100 --> 02:41:23,980
Fear not the beat is to sacrifice but not removed from your deck

2480
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:31,100
Don't break the tutorial guys. It's suffering was real, but you'll see it again

2481
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:39,100
Uh

2482
02:41:42,460 --> 02:41:46,940
That was a good game four damage dealt four weights on the scale

2483
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:51,580
You've won this match

2484
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:54,300
They won't all be so easy

2485
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:59,660
Let me recall your story

2486
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:03,660
Oh, yes

2487
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:10,060
You were lost deep in the forest a single path revealed itself

2488
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:19,660
I was making dinner. Why did she turn it off? Uh, I didn't turn it off

2489
02:42:20,140 --> 02:42:26,300
I'll repost actually, you know, I don't know if some of you guys still have crowd control open, but I'll repost the link

2490
02:42:30,780 --> 02:42:35,420
You guys break the tutorial then you break the tutorial I guess there's nothing I could fucking do about it

2491
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:40,620
Enjoy you fucking hooligans

2492
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:43,580
Oh

2493
02:42:55,740 --> 02:43:01,020
Give me the fucking cat give you the cat another creature joins your caravan

2494
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:08,380
Some of the creatures of the forest seemed willing to follow you

2495
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:16,860
You came across an abandoned sack a ball sack if you will

2496
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:23,740
You found a squirrel in a bottle break in case of emergency and have a second

2497
02:43:25,580 --> 02:43:29,260
Another useful implement I'll allow you to tip the scales

2498
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:34,380
Three is as much as you can carry all that lightning

2499
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,940
You

2500
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:41,820
Guys if I die will you remember me?

2501
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:56,540
Can you hear the thunder

2502
02:43:56,940 --> 02:44:01,500
Thunder he the thunder whoa

2503
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:04,460
It's so funny because only like one

2504
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:07,980
Like the storm the cloud is passing in front of my house

2505
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:10,700
my apartment and only

2506
02:44:13,820 --> 02:44:15,820
Only one

2507
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:21,740
It's like half I could see the rain, but it's not on my half. It's like a wall

2508
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:27,420
Of water is and I just saw lightning clear as fuck that was cool

2509
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:32,380
I've seen have you ever I've seen green in red lightning before

2510
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:38,140
That was interesting I love thunder

2511
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:45,180
Your narration always has to be doing double tape and it's actually happening. That's a thing. Yeah

2512
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:50,380
You're ambushed while crossing some rough terrain

2513
02:44:51,180 --> 02:44:55,180
By a boulder, but it's not a boulder. It's a rock

2514
02:44:58,060 --> 02:45:04,380
I get it. Maybe you'll help me take your turn play along for now

2515
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:08,380
You may now see my moves ahead of time

2516
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:12,460
All right, I will sacrifice your care

2517
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:16,060
Or let me just put this show down

2518
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:19,580
Here we go

2519
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:22,540
All right, I can't really fucking do anything else

2520
02:45:27,420 --> 02:45:30,540
Mind the ambitious wolf cub it ain't just swiftly

2521
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:36,140
A rock lobster it's it's iraq

2522
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:48,140
I'm just gonna do that boulder just attack

2523
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:58,140
Did you guys give give power to my boulder? I should get turn the game volume down. Okay

2524
02:46:04,700 --> 02:46:11,500
That boulder just crushed that little dog that's sad the airborne bat flies over creatures to attack directly

2525
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:14,060
No

2526
02:46:15,100 --> 02:46:19,100
My bat flew right over your stote. It is really fucking dark outside

2527
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:24,540
Even darker than how I am in the darkness right now with my spinny little fucking eyes

2528
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:32,940
I don't think I'm gonna squirrel show mine if I fuck you with your fucking mantis

2529
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:37,260
I say what you did

2530
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:39,340
I

2531
02:46:39,580 --> 02:46:41,580
Why is this stomp deadly?

2532
02:46:52,780 --> 02:46:56,300
Get absolutely fuck you fuck um

2533
02:46:58,220 --> 02:47:00,220
I was gonna say something bad

2534
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:05,100
Not what you thought not not what you thought I was gonna say

2535
02:47:07,740 --> 02:47:10,780
Wait the boulder got stronger. Yeah, somebody somebody uh

2536
02:47:12,540 --> 02:47:17,900
Gave the boulder more power you profound and tripped onwards past the now bloody terrain

2537
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:26,300
No, I wasn't gonna say the gamer word. I was gonna say you fuck wad but swap wad with something else

2538
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:31,500
She'd be based

2539
02:47:31,500 --> 02:47:33,500
Whoa, she'd be based

2540
02:47:33,900 --> 02:47:38,780
The young wolf cub it grows into a wolf after a single turn. Okay. I don't really need to narrate for that

2541
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:41,340
Uh, I'll take the wolf

2542
02:47:45,900 --> 02:47:48,540
I'm usually a great refresher before more elven ring. Oh

2543
02:47:49,420 --> 02:47:52,940

2562
02:50:53,020 --> 02:50:55,020
Hello

02:51:12,940 --> 02:51:17,340
Kind of want a bowl of cereal I'm feeling snacky. It looks snacking

2564
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:19,980
I

2565
02:51:21,740 --> 02:51:25,340
Love storms. I love like I usually fall asleep listening to the funder

2566
02:51:32,780 --> 02:51:35,900
Yeah, sometimes you like I don't like it when you can tell where the loop part is

2567
02:51:36,780 --> 02:51:43,740
That's my fave cereal. Um, my favorite cereal is post-it o's. They used to be quaker o's, but they were bought by post

2568
02:51:44,140 --> 02:51:46,140
Those are my favorite

2569
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:50,300
Oh, wait, I muted the game

2570
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:57,180
You know like storms be like windy days interesting

2571
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:05,580
Brain sounds knock me out. You love those too. No way 56 year old taste was it's funny because of my my my meh-meh

2572
02:52:06,860 --> 02:52:12,380
My grandmother my grandma loves those and that's why I started eating them because normally I just have Cheerios

2573
02:52:13,020 --> 02:52:16,060
Guys, I wish I could show you outside. It's so gorgeous

2574
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:19,420

2575
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:24,300
I felt that thunder in my fucking skull. That was crazy

2576
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:31,180
The fuck is wrong. This is a perfect night to watch a horror movie

2577
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:35,660
I never heard of anyone else in my serenity me too. I never hear it

2578
02:52:38,860 --> 02:52:44,940
Okay, you stumbled onto some strange. I'm so distracted. I can't focus on the fucking game. I just want to get

2579
02:52:47,580 --> 02:52:53,660
You were compelled to choose a worthy sacrifice one will be lost forever. All right, who am I sacrificing?

2580
02:52:54,940 --> 02:52:56,940
Uh

2581
02:52:57,340 --> 02:52:59,340
Okay

2582
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:05,180
Well, I could

2583
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:09,100
Because it wants me to take that thing because it what it wants me to do the sigil

2584
02:53:10,220 --> 02:53:12,220
I don't want to

2585
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:16,860
You know my strat when playing this game was I get the sigil of the cat

2586
02:53:17,980 --> 02:53:19,980
Um on the totem

2587
02:53:20,220 --> 02:53:24,700
And then the squirrel so every time I killed a squirrel and just returned to my hand and it was fucking awesome

2588
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:27,100
Um, but I'll do

2589
02:53:27,580 --> 02:53:30,780
That thank you. What the fuck are you gonna turn into?

2590
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:33,740

2591
02:53:36,300 --> 02:53:38,300
Cat stronger

2592
02:53:40,300 --> 02:53:44,300
I gasly spectacle but the soul of the wolf cub now lives in the stout

2593
02:53:48,300 --> 02:53:50,300
So

2594
02:53:52,940 --> 02:53:57,740
This is a totem fight so all their canine related cards are gonna be flying

2595
02:54:01,980 --> 02:54:08,860
He's completely insane you see that right no care for the wolf camera the voice is fucking in pathetic really that's what it was

2596
02:54:09,900 --> 02:54:14,380

Impressive you may yet survive this ordeal

2615
02:56:12,940 --> 02:56:14,940
Knock on wood

2616
02:56:21,740 --> 02:56:23,740
Okay

Okay, I'll get some flight

02:56:34,540 --> 02:56:39,340
Uh, I don't really need to sack her. Well, actually I might make somebody airborne

2619
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:50,460
If that voice is how they're leshy, um, I'm gonna sack my sparrow. I'm gonna make the cat fly. No, I'll make the one of the wolves fly

2620
02:56:54,700 --> 02:56:56,700
It should be I'm trying to maintain composure

2621
02:56:57,260 --> 02:57:02,460
I'm out composure. You're gonna be composing me. You don't have to be composed

2622
02:57:05,980 --> 02:57:07,980
I want you to lose all composure

2623
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:16,060
There's a way out for both of us is somewhere in this file cabin be silent or I will tear you to shreds

2624
02:57:16,780 --> 02:57:18,780

02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:45,980
I think so

2632
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:48,540
He's power player board

2633
02:57:49,820 --> 02:57:54,620
He gets angry if you beat him though for this one because you're not supposed to beat him

2634
02:57:59,500 --> 02:58:01,500
You've lost

2635
02:58:01,820 --> 02:58:06,140
Using this as a learning opportunity may be the only way to mitigate my disappointment

2636
02:58:07,740 --> 02:58:09,740
Get up

2637
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:12,540
I want you to kiss my feet

2638
02:58:13,580 --> 02:58:15,580
My little tights

02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:21,100
You think you're better than me, don't you you're wrong

2640

2641
02:58:39,740 --> 02:58:41,740
Huh

2642
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:44,540

2646
02:59:05,820 --> 02:59:10,460
Oh my god, my cat just scared me. She just brushed against my foot. Jesus Christ

2647
02:59:11,740 --> 02:59:13,740

Let me explain something to you

2654
02:59:59,820 --> 03:00:01,820
You can't make me lose

2655
03:00:02,940 --> 03:00:06,940
That was one of the two mistakes you can make here is thinking

2656
03:00:07,900 --> 03:00:11,420
Now you have some sort of power over me

2657
03:00:13,180 --> 03:00:17,100
If you make another I'm going to have to hurt you here. Um

2658
03:00:18,700 --> 03:00:20,700
Now where are we?

2659
03:00:23,740 --> 03:00:25,740
Uh, all right then

2660
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:29,420
Actually, fuck no, I should have gone to see what was in the pack

2661
03:00:30,060 --> 03:00:32,940
Sparrow adder raven. Uh, I want the adder

2662
03:00:34,300 --> 03:00:36,300
Just because

2663
03:00:37,420 --> 03:00:39,420
I like the sigil

2664
03:00:42,940 --> 03:00:45,500
You came across a small group of survivors

2665
03:00:46,460 --> 03:00:47,580
Oh

2666
03:00:47,580 --> 03:00:51,100
Imagine being surrounded by five hair members

2667
03:00:52,060 --> 03:00:54,060
I don't know what I would do

2668
03:00:54,300 --> 03:00:55,420
just a

2669
03:00:55,420 --> 03:00:56,780
small

2670
03:00:56,780 --> 03:00:58,780
offenses girl

2671
03:00:58,780 --> 03:01:00,780
I

2672
03:01:02,380 --> 03:01:04,380
Wouldn't have any way to protect myself

2673
03:01:05,180 --> 03:01:08,940
Priests shrunk them from starvation. They huddled around the campfire

2674
03:01:09,820 --> 03:01:12,380
They looked upon the group of creatures and beckoned

2675
03:01:14,620 --> 03:01:18,220
Come warm winning your creatures by the fire once said

2676
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:24,380
Warming by the fire that will enhance its power said another

2677
03:01:25,100 --> 03:01:31,260
You know just one of the survivors who I've been drool from their mouth. Where was it something else?

2678
03:01:32,780 --> 03:01:34,780
Like come

2679
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:41,260
Everybody's so quiet

2680
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:46,140
I'm looking at chat and nobody is fucking talking

2681
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:51,820
Because you fuckers. What are you doing? Please stop. I'm shopping

2682
03:01:52,620 --> 03:01:54,620
You're at the moment

2683
03:02:03,020 --> 03:02:09,340
He's too busy. All right, let me continue then continue continue. Don't stop. Don't stop

2684
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:15,020
I'm gonna make my cat strong

2685
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:17,420
Because I need to sacrifice it

2686
03:02:21,820 --> 03:02:24,140
One of the survivors reached towards me

2687
03:02:25,740 --> 03:02:29,740
You're not allowed to touch me dirty piece of trash. I told it

2688
03:02:31,020 --> 03:02:33,020
My mother gnashed its teeth

2689
03:02:33,900 --> 03:02:35,900
tugging on my skirt

2690
03:02:36,540 --> 03:02:38,540
Without a word I pulled it away

2691
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:41,420
and left

2692
03:02:41,420 --> 03:02:43,420
I

2693
03:02:44,940 --> 03:02:49,500
Listen to your beautiful. Uhu story. It's like I'm focused just to join

2694
03:02:59,820 --> 03:03:04,300
The trees seem to close in around you as a chill mist ascended

2695
03:03:06,380 --> 03:03:11,100
In the distance you could hear the clinking of metal and stone

2696
03:03:12,380 --> 03:03:14,380
As I change you up

2697
03:03:14,460 --> 03:03:16,460
and bound you

2698
03:03:16,860 --> 03:03:18,860
Stuffing my panties in your mouth

2699
03:03:20,060 --> 03:03:22,060
Gagging you

2700
03:03:22,060 --> 03:03:24,060
You can't escape

2701
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:26,700
You're mine now

2702
03:03:27,180 --> 03:03:29,180
And I will join the pet

2703
03:03:42,060 --> 03:03:44,060
Okay

2704
03:03:48,220 --> 03:03:50,220
Go on

2705
03:03:52,220 --> 03:03:54,220
A figure stood in your back

2706
03:03:57,900 --> 03:03:59,900
He was the crossfactor

2707
03:04:05,660 --> 03:04:07,660
Stop I want you to stop

2708
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:11,100
No touchy no touchy

2709
03:04:11,580 --> 03:04:13,580
I don't know why I have to look at that

2710
03:04:16,860 --> 03:04:18,860
Um

2711
03:04:24,460 --> 03:04:30,460
You motherfucker you motherfucker fuck your mother motherfucker

2712
03:04:33,420 --> 03:04:39,980
I want a gold digger. I ain't saying she a gold digger if she ain't messing with no broke broke

2713
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:46,380
Did I neglect to mention overkill damage?

2714
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:52,460
That's when you're tied up so tightly

2715
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:56,140
Bound back

2716
03:04:57,820 --> 03:05:01,420
Brisk burning from the friction of the metal

2717
03:05:04,380 --> 03:05:07,660
You start to lie. You can't escape

2718
03:05:08,540 --> 03:05:12,540
I don't waste any damage

2719
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:17,740
You create in your neck

2720
03:05:18,860 --> 03:05:25,260
And I press my little tiny heel to your throat

2721
03:05:27,660 --> 03:05:29,660
Try to breathe now

2722
03:05:37,660 --> 03:05:39,660
I

2723
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:05,580
Freaky prospecting

2724
03:06:08,620 --> 03:06:14,620
You can't spend easy verses than lunch. Yes, I can

2725
03:06:24,860 --> 03:06:26,860
Can't fucking do anything

2726
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:36,220
I hope you didn't think it would be that easy to escape me now

2727
03:06:37,180 --> 03:06:39,180
Did you

2728
03:06:42,780 --> 03:06:44,780
I'll let this step on your balls next

2729
03:06:47,340 --> 03:06:53,900
How does it make you feel knowing that a little girl is stomping on your nuts

2730
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:04,620
There's golden cards

2731
03:07:06,620 --> 03:07:08,620
I

2732
03:07:12,700 --> 03:07:14,700
Gold I've struck gold

2733
03:07:20,620 --> 03:07:25,500
Don't worry about it you just give him a wolf you fucking bitch

2734
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:34,540
You fucking cunts you fucking concier you don't matter

2735
03:07:36,220 --> 03:07:38,220
I

2736
03:07:51,820 --> 03:07:54,220
Serpent perhaps more deadly than man

2737
03:08:00,220 --> 03:08:02,220
They strangle

2738
03:08:03,260 --> 03:08:05,260
They choke

2739
03:08:05,980 --> 03:08:10,460
Which is what you're experiencing right now as I'm stepping on your throat

2740
03:08:20,860 --> 03:08:24,220
The cat's supposed to return from my hand so I don't know what happened with that

2741
03:08:35,260 --> 03:08:37,260
All right

2742
03:08:48,700 --> 03:08:50,700
Let's fucking go

2743
03:08:52,940 --> 03:08:57,980
This cat returns of sacrifice that time I just got molded and that's a good point

2744
03:08:59,660 --> 03:09:04,060
Allow me to let your candles once more. I won't be killing you quite yet

2745
03:09:05,500 --> 03:09:16,220
You're the first in a while to overcome a boss like me as a reward

2746
03:09:18,620 --> 03:09:20,620
I'll let you sniff my cunny

2747
03:09:26,940 --> 03:09:30,700
Here I mean your granted opportunity to select a rare card

2748
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:38,780
That's what I said. What are you talking about? I said select a rare card. I said select a rare card

2749
03:09:40,220 --> 03:09:45,900
Guys, I don't know what the fuck you thought you heard, but it was incorrect. Choose carefully

2750
03:09:46,060 --> 03:09:48,060
I

2751
03:09:56,060 --> 03:09:58,060
Gek

2752
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:03,180
I like the Gek because I can just like

2753
03:10:04,460 --> 03:10:06,460
A strange law is good too

2754
03:10:16,780 --> 03:10:18,780
I

2755
03:10:19,180 --> 03:10:21,180
Free monies

2756
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:25,820
Hundred geck's even it's gacky joy

2757
03:10:27,580 --> 03:10:33,980
It's gacky joy. It's fine. What are you talking about? What's the matter? It's fine. It's fine

2758
03:10:35,820 --> 03:10:38,460
It's fine. Everybody relax

2759
03:10:38,940 --> 03:10:40,940
Hmm

2760
03:10:43,740 --> 03:10:48,300
The rink smell of rot and mold permeated the human air

2761
03:10:49,820 --> 03:10:54,380
Every step forward was answered by some nearby slippers

2762
03:10:56,780 --> 03:10:58,780
You tread cautiously into

2763
03:11:00,460 --> 03:11:02,460
The wetlands

2764
03:11:03,020 --> 03:11:05,020
You know what also is a wetland

2765
03:11:09,260 --> 03:11:11,260
I

2766
03:11:15,020 --> 03:11:21,740
Haven't seen the my colopis is the mycologist yet. So I fucking hate the bullfrog. Um

2767
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:24,940
But it is good against defense

2768
03:11:26,700 --> 03:11:28,380
Or I can make a

2769
03:11:28,380 --> 03:11:33,180
Actually, I'll get a river snapper because then I can see the mycologists and put them together

2770
03:11:33,660 --> 03:11:37,820
Uh, I can't tell what that's up. Okay. No, that's the

2771
03:11:38,700 --> 03:11:40,700
Thing you can use to mix stuff

2772
03:11:42,300 --> 03:11:45,980
And that's the actually I would like that. Yeah

2773
03:11:48,860 --> 03:11:53,740
Not gynecologist the mycologists are like mycology is study of mushrooms

2774
03:11:54,620 --> 03:11:56,140
um

2775
03:11:56,140 --> 03:12:00,780
I'm gonna sacrifice the adder and the gack is gonna get it

2776
03:12:05,260 --> 03:12:07,660
Anything that touches the gack dies

2777
03:12:09,420 --> 03:12:11,740
The study of yes, the study of my

2778
03:12:18,860 --> 03:12:20,860
Stop with the fucking first

2779
03:12:24,700 --> 03:12:27,660
Oh my god, the fucking Jesus

2780
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:33,340
Bees

2781
03:12:38,460 --> 03:12:45,900
Oh god, these furs are actually kind of helping me out

2782
03:12:50,860 --> 03:12:56,620
Oh, oh nice fucking try adding a fucking grizzly ha ha ha

2783
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:03,100
So, you know a mushroom expert in the game you fuck Jesus

2784
03:13:03,100 --> 03:13:08,540
You can merge together cards with the mycologists

2785
03:13:10,620 --> 03:13:14,460
The inviolable beehive when it's attacked you will drop me

2786
03:13:15,580 --> 03:13:19,660
A sparrow herbal frog. I'll get the look at the the beehive

2787
03:13:21,020 --> 03:13:23,020
Beehive

2788
03:13:23,820 --> 03:13:26,620
Was popping brand new web just hopped in

2789
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:29,580
Uh

2790
03:13:31,100 --> 03:13:33,100
We'll give it to the wolf

2791
03:13:33,340 --> 03:13:38,540
If the wolf gets actually know if the river snapper gets attacked because that's six

2792
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:42,140
So that means you can take six hits so I can at least get six bees

2793
03:13:44,540 --> 03:13:46,540
Bees brother

2794
03:13:49,420 --> 03:13:53,260
Be confusing chat with this one. Hello and goodbye beehive

2795
03:13:57,580 --> 03:14:03,180
Is how is everybody doing is everybody okay? Is everybody doing fine? Oh my

Oh

03:14:24,700 --> 03:14:30,140
Oh my god, it's the same person just doing it

03:14:32,300 --> 03:14:34,300
Oh

03:14:40,540 --> 03:14:50,300
Oh my god, wait a second. Can I please what are you doing? I can't just fell from somewhere. I don't even know where

2803
03:14:54,300 --> 03:14:56,300
Can you hear him making those noises

2804
03:14:58,460 --> 03:15:00,960
He's the reforestation efforts

2805
03:15:01,920 --> 03:15:12,080
Who's who's who's nerd who's putting it was like beefing my cards up right now beefing up my furs

2806
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:19,920
Thank you for the grizzly who wears what does the fuck is a spider?

2807
03:15:23,680 --> 03:15:25,680
Wait, oh, I don't god

03:15:27,280 --> 03:15:29,280
I can't

2809
03:15:29,440 --> 03:15:37,280
I never noticed a spider in the game before well looks like I'm just gonna kill with this fur

2810
03:15:41,440 --> 03:15:43,440
This is fun

2811
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:49,040
I like this is this is a great game

2812
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:55,840
Don't get ahead of yourself. Okay use that

2813
03:15:56,720 --> 03:15:58,720
And

2814
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:08,480
Ha bitch shit

2815
03:16:11,760 --> 03:16:13,760
Ha bitch

2816
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:23,200
I might get fucked a little bit. I'll see what the fuck is this

2817
03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:28,720
Huh

2818
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:37,360
The hell I didn't even know that card could show up

2819
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:41,600
That's so weird

2820
03:16:49,840 --> 03:16:51,840
Uh-oh

2821
03:16:52,560 --> 03:16:54,560
Uh, I'm just gonna

2822
03:16:56,560 --> 03:17:00,560
Oh cat actually, you know what? Yeah, the cat there

2823
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:09,440
Okay, I'm gonna squirrel that just to block anything. It's fine

2824
03:17:11,920 --> 03:17:16,400
We're good. We're good. He's gonna die. That's okay. That's okay. Fresh point

2825
03:17:18,640 --> 03:17:20,640
Yeah

2826
03:17:21,200 --> 03:17:24,160
Yo, she got the card don't underestimate

2827
03:17:26,080 --> 03:17:28,080
How brutal of you

2828
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:31,680
You dealt me more damage than you needed to win

2829
03:17:33,200 --> 03:17:36,880
However, in my game such feats are rewarded

2830
03:17:38,480 --> 03:17:40,480
I like pain

2831
03:17:41,200 --> 03:17:46,000
To be precise a tooth to keep for each extra damage dealt

2832
03:17:47,200 --> 03:17:50,080
A trapper may be interested in your spoils

2833
03:17:55,840 --> 03:17:59,280
Get clapped freak she

2834
03:18:01,520 --> 03:18:05,120
You were stopped along the way by a trapper looking to liquidate his pelts

2835
03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:10,160
There was something uncanny about his appearance, but you were quickly distracted by his ways

2836
03:18:12,160 --> 03:18:14,160
Care to log out to my pelts

2837
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:20,480
Uh take a pelt for your charge. Holy shit

2838
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:24,080
Okay, uh you wink

2839
03:18:24,800 --> 03:18:27,680
See the quality see the quality

2840
03:18:28,800 --> 03:18:30,800
I can't do it or

2841
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:33,760
An accent right now. Why is it only saying I can

2842
03:18:36,160 --> 03:18:39,360
Wait one two, can I buy this? Oh, I can

Yeah, you just likes to roleplay

2847
03:19:04,960 --> 03:19:07,280
The man I showed you of the value of the pelts

2848
03:19:08,480 --> 03:19:12,640
They appear to be useless and fine. Oh wait, sorry, but he mentioned because I realized

2849
03:19:13,200 --> 03:19:16,000
Unless she's talking right now you can see him when you can't see him

2850
03:19:16,880 --> 03:19:18,880
That's when yeah, you know

2851
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:23,440
But he mentioned that the trader further down the path but her boarded you for them

2852
03:19:26,880 --> 03:19:28,880

2855
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:37,760
I want to be a hundred yucks

2856
03:19:38,960 --> 03:19:43,280
A group of starving survivors stood around the dying campfire

2857
03:19:44,560 --> 03:19:46,560
Dying to sniff this

2858
03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:53,440
Delicious smore there is room for a creature on the fire

2859
03:19:56,160 --> 03:19:58,160
The warmth will enhance its powers

2860
03:20:00,720 --> 03:20:05,760
When the survivors are nothing at all they could not stop licking there

2861
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:21,120
Oh

2862
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:38,240
What do you mean? What's the matter? I'm just enhancing my gek. I like my gek. This little guy

2863
03:20:41,280 --> 03:20:43,280

2866
03:21:05,360 --> 03:21:07,360
A thousand cats

2867
03:21:09,440 --> 03:21:12,640
She cannot be trusted with voicing regular dialogue

2868
03:21:13,440 --> 03:21:15,440
She

2869
03:21:18,480 --> 03:21:20,480
Be sweet

2870
03:21:21,360 --> 03:21:25,840
You encountered a small outpost in the woods tempted by a mysterious woman

2871
03:21:27,200 --> 03:21:29,200
It was a trick

2872
03:21:29,680 --> 03:21:34,160
Are you guys good boomy the fucking what are you doing dude?

2873

2879
03:22:12,800 --> 03:22:15,360

2880
03:22:18,640 --> 03:22:21,280

2885
03:22:42,560 --> 03:22:51,520
Is that a golden pelt magnificence? Oh, I can get another dick

These pelts are most excellent my thanks

2888
03:23:04,640 --> 03:23:08,160
I think there's a clip of me when I was reina and I was just like

2889
03:23:08,720 --> 03:23:12,320
Okay, I gotta kill this child. How many times I feel like I have to kill this child

2890
03:23:12,400 --> 03:23:18,080
I'm gonna sacrifice this child. We gotta fuck this child because I was referencing that card

2891
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:22,000
And if you weren't like, huh, I don't think we're when they weren't listening

2892
03:23:27,280 --> 03:23:29,280
Okay

03:23:51,440 --> 03:23:53,440

2897
03:23:59,680 --> 03:24:05,600

2898
03:24:08,480 --> 03:24:10,480
Oh

2899
03:24:18,560 --> 03:24:22,080
My boss battles are high stakes tests of your aptitude

2900
03:24:23,920 --> 03:24:27,200
As for intelligence you seem to be doing well without

2901
03:24:28,800 --> 03:24:32,720
I just called you an idiot. He what are you gonna do about it?

2902
03:24:33,680 --> 03:24:35,680
Nothing

2903
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:39,360
Because you're a little pathetic whiny bitch

2904
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:44,880
With one flame you'll either overcome them or die

2905
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:48,000
Do you want to die?

2906
03:24:48,480 --> 03:24:53,840
I can string you up and pull you apart like one of my favorite dolls

2907
03:24:56,000 --> 03:25:02,080
You're not I will let you keep the smoke you want some of the smoke bro. Let's fucking I'm gonna duff you

2908
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:07,760
A

2909
03:25:10,800 --> 03:25:15,600
Foul smell invaded your nostrils and caused your throat to see

2910
03:25:17,600 --> 03:25:19,600
A hulking man said back

2911
03:25:24,160 --> 03:25:26,320
I get maybe maybe duff as a colloquial term

2912
03:25:26,960 --> 03:25:32,880
It for my area because when you say like you want the smoke like you want to fight and duff means like you'll beat someone up

2913
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:35,200
Like I'm gonna duff you. I don't know why that comes from

2914
03:25:36,640 --> 03:25:38,640
I don't know

2915
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:42,560
I'm getting whiplash from excitement to laughing my ass off

2916
03:25:44,960 --> 03:25:49,680
A hulking man sat by a brackish pond with his feet submerged in the dark water

2917
03:25:51,680 --> 03:25:56,480
He pulled a hook from a pile of rotting fish and rose to his feet

2918
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:03,040
I'm the angler go fish

2919
03:26:05,680 --> 03:26:07,840
I can love the soundtrack for the boss battles

2920
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:10,880

Congratulations, you broke I'm wonder. I don't know which one

Fucking broke it though. Like somebody put something on the other board and then all of a sudden my I couldn't move my mouse

2968
03:30:32,560 --> 03:30:34,560
So

2969
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:45,200
You keep looking over it so they they nerf my game

2970
03:30:50,640 --> 03:30:53,040
I don't know the game also doesn't want to be captured again

2971
03:31:02,640 --> 03:31:04,640
You

2972
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:13,440

03:31:18,880 --> 03:31:20,880
Oh my god, please

03:31:22,960 --> 03:31:28,880
Trying to give her bones before she had them at first. Oh, yeah, I think I think it was the bones

100%

2978
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:48,160
The bones broke the game. Yeah, because that makes sense to look because the logs said like this object doesn't exist yet or whatever the fuck

2979
03:31:48,880 --> 03:31:50,880
um

2980
03:31:51,520 --> 03:31:53,520

Things but you can't do it for this one for some reason

2986
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:41,280

2987
03:32:42,480 --> 03:32:44,480
Oh my god, I might have to

2988

I don't know why it like in

2989
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:51,040
Intermittently works to capture the game. I don't

2990
03:32:52,400 --> 03:32:54,400
I don't get it

2991

We're just gonna chat

2997
03:33:54,880 --> 03:33:59,600
Because that's not working. I don't feel like fucking around with it anymore

2998
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:16,080
Oh, I don't fucking want to talk about my fucking session crowd control. Just let me end it. Jesus

2999
03:34:17,920 --> 03:34:19,920
Oh, it's the app time

3000
03:34:20,880 --> 03:34:22,880

Do it leshy the company app with you guys. Oh, yeah

3005
03:34:43,520 --> 03:34:50,720
Yeah, my leshy voice is too powerful. If I had a model that matched the leshy voice, it would be over for everybody

3006
03:34:51,600 --> 03:34:55,920
And um, you want BGM? Yeah, that's a good idea. Um

3007
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:03,040
And it would be the true Cunny Corpo

3008
03:35:07,040 --> 03:35:09,040
I don't know if all of us were just

3009
03:35:13,680 --> 03:35:17,520
It's still lightning and thundering outside. It's quite nice

3010
03:35:26,640 --> 03:35:30,480
She just wanted you to just add extreme have inscription in the background

3011
03:35:32,000 --> 03:35:36,080
Yeah, I I didn't rage quit. It was the game's just not

3012
03:35:37,040 --> 03:35:40,720
Capturing and I don't know why I don't want to capture my display

3013
03:35:41,680 --> 03:35:43,680
So, you know

3014
03:35:43,680 --> 03:35:47,200
Model swap for April Fool's will be too powerful. What are you talking about?

3015
03:35:48,080 --> 03:35:49,840
um

3016
03:35:49,840 --> 03:35:53,120
Oh, you think we should swap models for April Fool's that'd be actually be funny

3017
03:35:54,080 --> 03:35:55,600
um

3018
03:35:55,600 --> 03:35:59,040
I think cats are running around. Um

3019
03:36:01,120 --> 03:36:03,120
Trying to think of who I would swap with

3020
03:36:06,240 --> 03:36:08,960
If I if me and Azura

3021
03:36:09,200 --> 03:36:10,320
What

3022
03:36:10,320 --> 03:36:14,320
We're to swap with the smaller body type girls in our gen

3023
03:36:14,880 --> 03:36:19,600
Who do you think would play who I feel like Azura would be icy and I would be in uh, emmy

3024
03:36:23,120 --> 03:36:25,920
Swap of scrawny you think I would swap with icy

3025
03:36:30,400 --> 03:36:32,880
Actually, you know what I think I would like to see

3026
03:36:33,120 --> 03:36:39,120
Mercy swap with emmy. I think that would be so funny

3027
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:47,120
Um, and then icy swapping with me would be hilarious

3028
03:36:48,960 --> 03:36:50,960
And then

3029
03:36:51,120 --> 03:36:53,120
Emmy being a

3030
03:36:57,360 --> 03:36:59,920
And then straw knee could um

3031
03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:02,800
Take uh

3032
03:37:04,400 --> 03:37:06,160
Take mercies

3033
03:37:06,160 --> 03:37:10,000
Yeah, I think everybody if everyone if we all just like swap models. I think anyone

3034
03:37:11,440 --> 03:37:15,280
The dolly doll me lolly fits in me. She's she's a switch

3035
03:37:17,680 --> 03:37:19,360
Um

3036
03:37:19,360 --> 03:37:25,040
I think I think it would just be funny if anybody got swapped with anyone right now. What are you doing?

3037
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:30,720
Hi, are you trying to hide from boomy? Please don't step on my fucking keyboard

3038
03:37:32,480 --> 03:37:34,480
You can oh my god

3039
03:37:35,360 --> 03:37:37,360
Lady, what are you doing?

3040
03:37:38,480 --> 03:37:42,720
Okay, all right. Oh, you're stepping on my fucking nipple. Thanks

3041
03:37:45,840 --> 03:37:49,680
They're all funny as it is. I know I'm saying it would be like funnier as like a joke

3042
03:37:50,400 --> 03:37:51,520
not like

3043
03:37:51,520 --> 03:37:53,520
for a long term thing

3044
03:37:53,840 --> 03:38:01,200
Scottish yandere I would actually that's a good point straw knee playing a yandere character would be very interesting

3045
03:38:08,640 --> 03:38:11,120
But whoever takes straw knee needs to do the accent

3046
03:38:12,800 --> 03:38:19,280
I think I'm the only one who could do the accent. I'm sorry. You can't see my mouth move because my cat is in front of me

3047
03:38:20,880 --> 03:38:22,880
All right, there we go. She moved she swapped shoulders

3048
03:38:23,520 --> 03:38:29,920
Um, reina, can you please sit down? Oh, she's rubbing against the microphone. Um, ma'am

3049
03:38:31,360 --> 03:38:33,200
Ma'am

3050
03:38:33,200 --> 03:38:36,960
Ma'am, please. This is the wendy ma'am. Don't headbutt the mic ma'am

3051
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:42,640
Reina so snuggly as per usual

3052
03:38:43,680 --> 03:38:44,640
Um

3053
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:51,120
The cat actually engages with you. Yeah, reina is my fucking I call her my soul cat because she is my she's my baby

3054
03:38:51,200 --> 03:38:53,200
I've had her since I was little

3055
03:38:54,480 --> 03:38:56,000
Wow

3056
03:38:56,000 --> 03:39:00,320
I mean reina is 14. She's an old lady and I love her

3057
03:39:01,920 --> 03:39:03,920
She is my my big mama

3058
03:39:05,520 --> 03:39:10,480
And um, it'll be funnier for someone to do her accent badly. That's a good point. That would be funnier

3059
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:12,880
uh

3060
03:39:12,880 --> 03:39:17,840
I like I think I would only be the one be able to do the bad accent or like an okay accent

3061
03:39:17,840 --> 03:39:22,320
I don't know if the other girls can even like attempt a scottish accent or do any accents

3062
03:39:23,120 --> 03:39:26,800
Um, I think maybe emmy could because she has a good voice range

3063
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:33,920
Uh, yeah, my cat's interactive me. Uh, I think the only one who's not super snuggly is boomy

3064
03:39:34,560 --> 03:39:36,800
We're just but he was like so snuggly as a kitten

3065
03:39:37,440 --> 03:39:41,520
And then uh, he's in his like teenage phase where he doesn't eat his mom aka me

3066
03:39:41,680 --> 03:39:45,120
So he only he's only really snuggly in the mornings and at night

3067
03:39:45,360 --> 03:39:49,600
I don't understand why and when I get out of the shower. He just like wants to be picked up

3068
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:54,000
I don't I think he thinks because I like he thinks I'm dying in the shower and he's like mother

3069
03:39:55,120 --> 03:39:57,120
Please hold me

3070
03:39:57,600 --> 03:40:01,760
This little climb up on my shoulder. He's so cute. He's just he's a he's a menace

3071
03:40:01,760 --> 03:40:06,640
But he's also pussy. It makes no sense. Like he's the biggest dick, but he's scared of everything

3072
03:40:10,160 --> 03:40:14,400
Uh, yeah, I have three cats and pray for your furniture. They don't scratch my furniture. They're good

3073
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:19,200
I give them lots of toys to play with um and cat scratchers

3074
03:40:20,000 --> 03:40:21,120
um

3075
03:40:21,120 --> 03:40:23,120
And yeah, a lot of scratchers

3076
03:40:23,840 --> 03:40:25,840
And I I clipped their claws. So they're fine

3077
03:40:26,400 --> 03:40:29,520
I I I trimmed their claws. Actually, I need to trim their claws again

3078
03:40:32,640 --> 03:40:35,040
Because I I trimmed them like a week ago and

3079
03:40:36,560 --> 03:40:39,120
Um, put me almost fucking clawed my leg this morning

3080
03:40:41,680 --> 03:40:45,520
You doing the Zeraz model it'll be funny since you have to be actually nice for once

3081
03:40:50,560 --> 03:40:53,840
You know, I will say people think I don't do like any k-fabe

3082
03:40:54,800 --> 03:40:56,480
Um, but I do

3083
03:40:56,480 --> 03:41:00,800
I'm very I'm usually a very very nice person. I'm not I don't bully my chat

3084
03:41:01,680 --> 03:41:03,120
Um

3085
03:41:03,120 --> 03:41:05,520
If you knew me as Rina, I was usually the one bullied

3086
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:08,880
Um

3087
03:41:08,880 --> 03:41:13,680
But I realize I do enjoy bullying my chat and bullying you guys and being mean

3088
03:41:14,640 --> 03:41:16,640
Hey

3089
03:41:18,320 --> 03:41:20,320
Um

3090
03:41:21,120 --> 03:41:23,120
It's bully right. Yeah, I am kind

3091
03:41:23,760 --> 03:41:26,320
Listen to my last audio. I'm the most kind person

3092
03:41:27,200 --> 03:41:29,760
Letting you even come near me, you know

3093
03:41:31,760 --> 03:41:33,760
Yeah, I like I like it

3094
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:36,240
Being

3095
03:41:36,240 --> 03:41:38,240
Emmy bullies more

3096
03:41:39,200 --> 03:41:41,200
Okay

3097
03:41:41,600 --> 03:41:43,600
What is that supposed to mean?

3098
03:41:48,320 --> 03:41:50,320
I I have noticed that people like

3099
03:41:52,720 --> 03:42:00,480
Compare the girls to each other for some reason in terms of like what their kinks are because like we all

3100
03:42:01,600 --> 03:42:03,600
um

3101
03:42:04,400 --> 03:42:09,760
Like yeah, we all have like our tags that we we we do that like influence our

3102
03:42:10,560 --> 03:42:12,560
Our audios

3103
03:42:12,640 --> 03:42:16,880
But like doesn't mean we can't dip into other tags like me right now

3104
03:42:17,520 --> 03:42:19,840
Pretending to be you know, cute and funny

3105
03:42:20,720 --> 03:42:24,080
And then like amy being yandere because that's what she used to do

3106
03:42:24,880 --> 03:42:26,880
or straw knee being like

3107
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:28,960
subbie or whatever the fuck

3108
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:31,440
um, but yeah

3109
03:42:32,400 --> 03:42:37,200
It's just we're gonna have we're just we're just gonna have fun and do whatever, you know do whatever

3110
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:39,920
Don't don't pigeonhole us in a box

3111
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:45,600
Uh in the hole pigeonhole, whatever the fuck that means. I don't know. I'm tired

3112
03:42:46,640 --> 03:42:48,640
Variety is good for the soul indeed

3113
03:42:50,560 --> 03:42:53,440
Straw knee is still so you know, yeah, that's actually true that she is

3114
03:42:54,400 --> 03:42:56,160
but like

3115
03:42:56,160 --> 03:42:58,720
I have to be honest. I'm kind of frustrated

3116
03:43:00,480 --> 03:43:02,480
because um

3117
03:43:03,840 --> 03:43:05,520
I like

3118
03:43:05,520 --> 03:43:07,120
I feel like

3119
03:43:07,440 --> 03:43:09,440
A lot of the girls like some like

3120
03:43:10,320 --> 03:43:12,800
some of the girls get to be themselves and

3121
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:18,160
Their fan bases are cool with that like straw knees because I my dream is like to make

3122
03:43:19,040 --> 03:43:20,480
to cultivate

3123
03:43:20,480 --> 03:43:23,760
A group like straw knees and like really you know dedicated

3124
03:43:24,400 --> 03:43:29,680
Reflings and I love like that their relationship and they're like cool with how she is no matter what

3125
03:43:30,960 --> 03:43:32,960
but like

3126
03:43:33,280 --> 03:43:38,560
Then like when I try to branch out and do something else or one of the other girls do everybody's just like

3127
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:46,640
And I'm like come on man does let me have fun and I'm gonna do it anyways. You can't tell me what the fuck to do

3128
03:43:50,720 --> 03:43:56,160
I think it adds a lot more depth to each of you almost like a real person because we are real people. What do you mean almost?

3129
03:43:57,360 --> 03:43:59,360
We are real people

3130
03:44:03,040 --> 03:44:05,040
Oh

3131
03:44:05,280 --> 03:44:07,280
I'm new here. I don't really know

3132
03:44:09,120 --> 03:44:11,120
You know, like that's how we are

3133
03:44:13,360 --> 03:44:15,680
What do you mean? I don't like I like I like how my harem is

3134
03:44:16,640 --> 03:44:18,080
well

3135
03:44:18,080 --> 03:44:22,720
I think you guys are very similar to reeflings. I know some of you are reeflings. So like

3136
03:44:23,760 --> 03:44:25,760
Yeah

3137
03:44:27,280 --> 03:44:29,280
YouTubers or robots confirmed

3138
03:44:30,480 --> 03:44:32,480
I think they meant the characters you play

3139
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:34,160
Uh

3140
03:44:34,160 --> 03:44:36,160
And I said this earlier

3141
03:44:36,240 --> 03:44:38,240
We're not playing characters

3142
03:44:38,480 --> 03:44:40,240
straw knee hired us

3143
03:44:40,240 --> 03:44:41,680
to be

3144
03:44:41,680 --> 03:44:42,880
us

3145
03:44:42,880 --> 03:44:47,840
And I think viewers took too much stock into the lore and the characters, which is not

3146
03:44:48,960 --> 03:44:53,760
It's a thing in v2 being but it's not a huge part of it. It's just almost like a guideline

3147
03:44:54,400 --> 03:44:56,000
for direction

3148
03:44:56,000 --> 03:44:58,320
She hired us for our voices and to be ourselves

3149
03:44:59,280 --> 03:45:01,600
Feelers AI generated. Yes

3150
03:45:04,720 --> 03:45:06,720
But like you don't have to give me reassurance

3151
03:45:07,680 --> 03:45:09,680
I appreciate it

3152
03:45:09,760 --> 03:45:14,880
Um, I don't want this to seem like a hug boxy thing. Like I say something you guys are like, oh, but you're amazing

3153
03:45:14,880 --> 03:45:16,560
Oh, but you're this

3154
03:45:16,560 --> 03:45:21,040
Uh, I'm just telling you like I'm just telling you how I feel. That's it. But I still appreciate nonetheless

3155
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:23,680
um

3156
03:45:23,680 --> 03:45:25,680
Yeah, reeflings are nice fellas. They're cool guys

3157
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:31,760
Exactly kayfabe is nice, but not if it diminishes the overall experience. Exactly. Ow. I'm just like

3158
03:45:32,240 --> 03:45:34,240
hoping myself in the face

3159
03:45:36,400 --> 03:45:38,400
It's okay to be you she be

3160
03:45:38,800 --> 03:45:41,280
The lore was the catch but you guys keep us. Exactly

3161
03:45:42,240 --> 03:45:44,240
Exactly

3162
03:45:44,400 --> 03:45:50,720
It's a habit vtuber fans won't you but usually they don't like and all the small vtuber communities. I've been in which is a lot

3163
03:45:52,080 --> 03:45:53,680
usually people just

3164
03:45:53,680 --> 03:45:59,840
Complain about kayfabe and like why do we even have this nobody cares about lore get rid of the lore

3165
03:46:00,320 --> 03:46:03,760
Nobody cares about this animated lore video people worked on uh

3166
03:46:04,400 --> 03:46:10,960
And then like I just noticed for our company. It's not like people just really want us to stick to our lore and I'm like

3167
03:46:12,320 --> 03:46:14,320
We don't have to

3168
03:46:16,800 --> 03:46:21,840
You like me for me and if you don't like me for me, you know, you're entitled to that opinion

3169
03:46:22,320 --> 03:46:27,280
You entitled that to to that opinion, uh, baby cakes. You're good. I respect you

3170
03:46:29,280 --> 03:46:31,280
You know

3171
03:46:33,680 --> 03:46:36,960

03:50:01,680 --> 03:50:04,720
But I couldn't be cotton tail because there's already a cotton tail

3214
03:50:05,600 --> 03:50:07,600

03:59:26,400 --> 03:59:32,160
I'll tell you I'll I think I told her this too. I saw all the name everybody's names and I was like, what the hell?

3332
03:59:33,600 --> 03:59:35,600
I was like, Stroudy, what are these names?

3333
03:59:36,720 --> 03:59:39,840
How do these names remember you? I'm like, I see snow paws

3334
03:59:41,040 --> 03:59:43,040
You're gonna be literal

3335
03:59:47,120 --> 03:59:49,120
Don't even get me started on Karambit

3336
03:59:49,200 --> 03:59:55,440
Don't even get me started in Karambit because when when mercy was Karam Karam before

3337
03:59:55,680 --> 03:59:57,680
She was mercy. I was like, I couldn't

3338
03:59:59,680 --> 04:00:01,680
My cat's food is going off

3339
04:00:02,320 --> 04:00:04,320
I couldn't keep it together. Okay

3340
04:00:05,280 --> 04:00:09,280
Her nameless was something else. So I see yeah, she just made everything so literal

3341
04:00:12,800 --> 04:00:17,360
Joystick isn't any better. I hope you get a really fucking neat girl

3342
04:00:18,560 --> 04:00:22,400
I want to I want a neat girl who never leaves her house for gen two

3343
04:00:23,200 --> 04:00:27,280
Here it sounds like csgo name. Yeah, because of what it's a karambit's a knife

3344
04:00:29,280 --> 04:00:32,320
But it didn't make sense for mercy to be called karambita

3345
04:00:33,520 --> 04:00:35,520
Because she was scissors

3346
04:00:37,520 --> 04:00:41,840
I'll never forget you making fun of me. She be a really your name is tiger festivals

3347

3348
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:48,560

Why not the slime girl? Uh, um, so what I was gonna say is uh

3362
04:01:34,800 --> 04:01:40,000
The girls will be heavily groomed by me. Uh, there'll be actually harem members

3363
04:01:40,880 --> 04:01:42,880
because uh, I got a lot of

3364
04:01:43,440 --> 04:01:47,920
Female fans. I think I have the most female fans out of all the my gen mates

3365
04:01:48,720 --> 04:01:53,920
So, um, I'm grooming them. I'm handpicking them and no, I'm kidding. That's not true

3366
04:01:56,000 --> 04:01:58,000
That'd be so fucked

3367
04:01:59,600 --> 04:02:00,880

Do you know the percentage of girls here? Um, I haven't checked the analytic in a while, but it did go up

3371
04:02:15,360 --> 04:02:19,600
It used to be one percent and now it's three percent. I'm trying to get the girlies on my side

3372

3398
04:04:11,440 --> 04:04:13,440
You're right

3399
04:04:20,400 --> 04:04:22,400
Fun fact she besides she'll be covered

3400
04:04:23,600 --> 04:04:26,640
I'm really it's funny because I'm like the one of the most like

3401
04:04:27,840 --> 04:04:29,840
um

3402
04:04:29,840 --> 04:04:39,200
Sorry that lightning was insane. It would flash like five times. It was like daylight outside for a second. Um

3403
04:04:41,520 --> 04:04:47,600
What is that what happened when you tried changing your listen, I'm still mad at myself about that

3404
04:04:49,200 --> 04:04:56,400
Because I shouldn't have done it on screen because I should have known I would have had an accidental fucking blackface moment. Um

3405
04:04:57,120 --> 04:05:02,000
If you don't know I'm brown by the way, I'm I'm a tan human being I am mixed. I am biracial

3406
04:05:02,480 --> 04:05:07,920
I am uh polish and I am portuguese and I am french and scottish

3407
04:05:09,040 --> 04:05:11,040
And I'm also Haitian

3408
04:05:12,320 --> 04:05:16,000
Uh, but yes, and I'm also a bunch of other fucking things. Um

3409
04:05:17,120 --> 04:05:24,240
It was curse her racism needs to be it's no it's funny. No what I was gonna say is that um you

3410
04:05:25,200 --> 04:05:28,400
No, I'm um portuguese from portugal

3411
04:05:29,840 --> 04:05:32,720
Azores um missable wad

3412
04:05:33,600 --> 04:05:36,880
I'm a very mixed bag. I thought this was a mixed hag and I liked that

3413
04:05:37,840 --> 04:05:41,840
Part native american. I'm actually not native american at all. I thought I was

3414
04:05:42,720 --> 04:05:47,920
Because you know, there's always like someone in your family when you're american that claims that you're that you're native

3415
04:05:48,640 --> 04:05:51,920
They're like, oh, yeah, like we're like one eighth Cherokee

3416
04:05:52,080 --> 04:05:54,080
And so when I did my like 23 and me

3417
04:05:54,720 --> 04:06:00,080
Ancestry test, I'm like, oh, I wonder if I'm native and there's like nothing there about being native and I'm like

3418
04:06:00,480 --> 04:06:04,720
My grandma fucking lied to me. They also said that we were italian too. I'm not italian

3419
04:06:05,360 --> 04:06:07,680
Although it's funny because my mom looks very italian

3420
04:06:08,400 --> 04:06:10,400
Italian, I don't know. I'm saying it like that

3421
04:06:10,960 --> 04:06:16,000
I am part native american indian. I mean, oh you are. Why would you call it native american indian then?

3422
04:06:16,000 --> 04:06:18,000
Why don't you just say you're a native american?

3423
04:06:18,480 --> 04:06:20,480
Or an indigenous person

3424
04:06:20,960 --> 04:06:22,960
You don't fucking say indian

3425
04:06:29,040 --> 04:06:34,400
I don't know if you remember the other portion of that meme as uh with norman osborne as a different color

3426
04:06:34,400 --> 04:06:36,400
Um

3427
04:06:41,280 --> 04:06:43,200
Uh

3428
04:06:43,200 --> 04:06:45,200
Sheeby speaks that gabagoo

3429
04:06:45,520 --> 04:06:47,520
100% french here from like two villages

3430
04:06:48,240 --> 04:06:51,280
Shout out to the colonizer then sheeby. Thanks mom. Whoo

3431
04:06:54,640 --> 04:07:00,880
My dad it's okay. My dad's my dad's country where the was the first country to become independent from slavery. Let's go. Whoo

3432
04:07:01,920 --> 04:07:03,920
um

3433
04:07:04,480 --> 04:07:05,760
but

3434
04:07:05,760 --> 04:07:08,640
No, like i'm a very it's it's so funny because on the internet

3435
04:07:08,880 --> 04:07:10,880
I feel like i've been so corrupted

3436
04:07:11,040 --> 04:07:12,640
Because i'm very

3437
04:07:12,640 --> 04:07:18,960
Like and I don't care if you fucking hate me for saying this. Um, I'm very lgbtq friendly. I'm very progressive

3438
04:07:19,680 --> 04:07:21,680
I'm very much a liberal friend

3439
04:07:24,080 --> 04:07:27,440
Uh, and I just I don't know why I'm like this online

3440
04:07:29,360 --> 04:07:32,640
I'm just an absolute fucking prick online, but you know

3441
04:07:33,440 --> 04:07:35,440
I like I like having a little bit flavor

3442
04:07:37,120 --> 04:07:40,880
It's like everybody nobody say like I'm not and I'm like I'm generally like

3443
04:07:42,080 --> 04:07:44,080
I don't really give a fuck about

3444
04:07:44,960 --> 04:07:46,800
uh

3445
04:07:46,800 --> 04:07:48,800
Like if somebody says

3446
04:07:49,040 --> 04:07:51,040
something

3447
04:07:51,040 --> 04:07:54,320
Offensive or ignorant to me. I will put them in their place for their ignorance

3448
04:07:54,880 --> 04:07:59,200
But I know I know the context of what's a joke and what's not a joke exactly jokes

3449
04:07:59,600 --> 04:08:01,600
And I I enjoy dark humor. Yes

3450
04:08:02,160 --> 04:08:04,160
I don't take personal offense

3451
04:08:04,480 --> 04:08:11,120
Like sometimes people do just like say things in poor taste like when I was when I was younger. Um

3452
04:08:12,320 --> 04:08:15,680
So my hair is curly you can see my beautiful curly hair

3453
04:08:16,240 --> 04:08:20,000
I lost tracking because it's dark. Hold on. Let me turn on the light. Um

3454
04:08:23,360 --> 04:08:26,320
Okay, turn on the light I have beautiful curly hair

3455
04:08:27,280 --> 04:08:29,280
Um, so I usually uh

3456
04:08:30,720 --> 04:08:33,440
With my type of curls, I'll put it up in like a

3457
04:08:34,720 --> 04:08:39,120
Like a like I'll put in a silk bonnet so that my curls stay nice when I sleep

3458
04:08:40,400 --> 04:08:43,520
And um, did I imagine I could love my she be more? Um

3459
04:08:44,320 --> 04:08:46,320
And so my friend who's white

3460
04:08:46,960 --> 04:08:48,960
Was just like making fun of me

3461
04:08:49,040 --> 04:08:51,920
And I'm just sitting there with my with my bonnet on

3462
04:08:52,480 --> 04:08:55,680
Um letting my hair dry after showering at her house because we're sleeping over

3463
04:08:56,320 --> 04:08:58,320
She's like making fun of me and

3464
04:08:58,800 --> 04:09:00,960
I'm like what why why you making fun of my bonnet?

3465
04:09:00,960 --> 04:09:05,520
She's like because you look like you should belong on my family's plantation picking my cotton

3466
04:09:05,520 --> 04:09:07,520
And I just kind of just stayed at her and I'm like

3467
04:09:09,280 --> 04:09:11,280
Like I'm like I could make

3468
04:09:12,480 --> 04:09:14,480
A way funnier joke than that

3469
04:09:14,960 --> 04:09:16,560
That was just bad

3470
04:09:16,560 --> 04:09:18,480
I'm like that was just dumb

3471
04:09:18,480 --> 04:09:24,880
Like that's when your white friend gets too fucking comfortable with you and just thinks they could say anything and she apologized afterwards

3472
04:09:25,600 --> 04:09:27,600
And I'm just like

3473
04:09:27,840 --> 04:09:31,360
Brother it's to me. It's only funny when it's self deprecating humor

3474
04:09:33,200 --> 04:09:34,800
Like um

3475
04:09:34,800 --> 04:09:36,800
No shot someone is that oh

3476
04:09:37,120 --> 04:09:39,120
Are you kidding me bro?

3477
04:09:40,160 --> 04:09:42,160
Oh, please

3478
04:09:42,880 --> 04:09:45,840
Oh, please there's uh when you're um

3479
04:09:47,280 --> 04:09:49,280
When you're a mixed kid, uh

3480
04:09:49,520 --> 04:09:52,400
Again, you're too white for the black kids. You're too black for the white kids

3481
04:09:52,480 --> 04:09:53,600
And so

3482
04:09:53,600 --> 04:09:59,280
When you're too black for the white kids, they'll make they'll think it's okay to make jokes like that

3483
04:09:59,280 --> 04:10:03,600
And I just I don't really give a shit because it's one. I just just don't give a reaction

3484
04:10:03,600 --> 04:10:09,360
And I don't care. Um, and then when it's black kids making fun of you for being like too white

3485
04:10:09,760 --> 04:10:11,920
Um, they'll do the same thing and so

3486
04:10:12,880 --> 04:10:14,880
They'll just say like, uh

3487
04:10:14,880 --> 04:10:18,800
What did that fucking say? I think they like I remember these black kids said something about my mom

3488
04:10:19,760 --> 04:10:21,760
Being like a snow bunny

3489
04:10:23,360 --> 04:10:25,360
And I just looked at them like

3490
04:10:26,400 --> 04:10:29,760
I cool anyways moving on

3491
04:10:33,120 --> 04:10:34,480
Um

3492
04:10:34,480 --> 04:10:36,080
And then like it's funny

3493
04:10:36,080 --> 04:10:41,600
It's only funny to me when like you make fun of yourself or you make fun of your own race

3494
04:10:43,040 --> 04:10:45,360
And that's why like I'll watch comedians who do that

3495
04:10:46,480 --> 04:10:47,520
um

3496
04:10:47,520 --> 04:10:51,040
Then it's funny to me, but like when it's someone who's just like, haha

3497
04:10:51,760 --> 04:10:54,640
Your gamer word and I'm just like, okay

3498
04:10:55,680 --> 04:11:00,320
Was that was supposed to be like come on. You could have said that in a better way like, you know

3499
04:11:01,840 --> 04:11:04,880
Your racism from all sides and no, it's not racism. It's just ignorance

3500
04:11:05,680 --> 04:11:06,880
like there's

3501
04:11:06,880 --> 04:11:13,520
I haven't experienced like real racism in like a very long time. I'll be honest with you. Um

3502
04:11:14,480 --> 04:11:18,960
It's usually people just like trolling and like just wanting to get a rise out of me

3503
04:11:18,960 --> 04:11:23,680
Which I don't really think they're necessarily racist. They're just like just kind of be a stupid, you know

3504
04:11:24,160 --> 04:11:25,120
um

3505
04:11:25,120 --> 04:11:29,200
Yeah, the last time I had someone like be legit racist was when the story I told before

3506
04:11:29,600 --> 04:11:33,520
Or someone called me the gamer word when I wouldn't give them their

3507
04:11:34,320 --> 04:11:38,880
Their pickup order because it was or it was canceled for some reason. Um

3508
04:11:39,760 --> 04:11:43,840
And then before that I had this European woman

3509
04:11:44,960 --> 04:11:46,160
um

3510
04:11:46,160 --> 04:11:50,880
Definitely talked to me like, you know how sometimes like older

3511
04:11:51,920 --> 04:11:53,120
folks

3512
04:11:53,120 --> 04:11:55,120
speak to like

3513
04:11:55,280 --> 04:11:58,640
Darker skinned folks a certain way. They'll be like, hey boy get over here

3514
04:12:00,000 --> 04:12:02,560
So she spoke to me like that. I was like, I don't

3515
04:12:03,520 --> 04:12:09,040
Okay, she called me she called me girl. She's like girl and she had like a very thick accent

3516
04:12:09,760 --> 04:12:11,760
um condescending

3517
04:12:12,080 --> 04:12:14,880
Kind of like talk slow like I didn't know how to speak English

3518
04:12:15,760 --> 04:12:18,560
And I'm like, I'm from fucking america. I was born here

3519
04:12:19,680 --> 04:12:26,000
I was literally fucking born here. You don't have to talk to me like that, dude. I can understand. I can't speak any other language, dude

3520
04:12:27,120 --> 04:12:29,120
um

3521
04:12:29,280 --> 04:12:33,360
Girl come here. Grab me mine. Give me your finest ways

3522
04:12:36,000 --> 04:12:42,480
Um, but again, I don't take it personally because people are just gonna be fucking ignorant and you know, they'll just die off someday

3523
04:12:42,480 --> 04:12:44,000
So I don't really give a shit

3524
04:12:44,000 --> 04:12:44,800
um

3525
04:12:44,800 --> 04:12:49,840
It's just I just think of it in like in hindsight and I just like laugh like when I was super young I was like

3526
04:12:50,720 --> 04:12:57,360
Really sensitive like super fucking sensitive and then I started playing csgo and I grew out of that real quick

3527
04:12:59,120 --> 04:13:01,120
um

3528
04:13:01,120 --> 04:13:06,720
My once got asked if I had a green card and trigger me to kick him out of the store. That's fucked. That's fucked

3529
04:13:07,520 --> 04:13:10,400
Pulling over butter. Yeah, I'm like I'm like token

3530
04:13:12,240 --> 04:13:17,440
Just kidding though. Uh, yeah the boomers will die off. So, you know, they'll die. We'll be fine

3531
04:13:18,000 --> 04:13:21,600
Although I'm getting up an age being 56. It's it's kind of scary

3532
04:13:21,600 --> 04:13:30,960
Sorry, drink some water. How you doing right now? Your eye is watering

3533
04:13:32,080 --> 04:13:34,080
I don't have a knack at near me or a wipe your little eye

3534
04:13:42,160 --> 04:13:44,160
Oh my god

3535
04:13:45,280 --> 04:13:47,280
We're already way better than like 30 years ago. Yeah

3536
04:13:48,240 --> 04:13:52,560
I'm gonna hit 60s in that ropes break off. Yeah

3537
04:13:53,840 --> 04:13:56,400
Means like the finest wine we're getting cougars

3538
04:13:57,920 --> 04:14:04,480
Yeah, I'm 56 you guys if you guys don't know I'm 56. I am the oldest vtuber in the vtubing community

3539
04:14:06,080 --> 04:14:08,080
Uh for real

3540
04:14:08,080 --> 04:14:12,800
56, although I think mom key d follows close behind because she's 40. So, you know

3541
04:14:13,200 --> 04:14:18,320
I am 56. I'm just in really good shape. Uh, I work on my figure

3542
04:14:24,560 --> 04:14:26,720
Some grand tubers who are the other grand tubers?

3543
04:14:28,320 --> 04:14:30,320
You know black don't crack

3544
04:14:30,800 --> 04:14:33,920
And also the black of the berry the sweet of the juice just look at Azura

3545
04:14:36,640 --> 04:14:38,640
I can't wait for my fucking brown toggle bro

3546
04:14:39,360 --> 04:14:41,600
Saying this is a white vtuber is hilarious

3547
04:14:42,080 --> 04:14:47,280
Because no, it's actually really funny because if my shit that I say gets clipped out of context and like put somewhere

3548
04:14:47,600 --> 04:14:49,600
It'll be so funny because then

3549
04:14:50,160 --> 04:14:55,760
I could bait the community so fucking hard and be like and just say like the most out of pocket shit

3550
04:14:57,200 --> 04:15:03,360
And then somebody who put me on blasts and be like, I can't believe people in this community are talking like this

3551
04:15:03,680 --> 04:15:07,840
Like look at this agency vtuber. He's using these words and then I'm like

3552
04:15:12,160 --> 04:15:18,640
Um, imagine the clout pass mode activate you you've activated my race card

3553
04:15:18,640 --> 04:15:20,640
Oh

3554
04:15:30,960 --> 04:15:33,520
God I am fucking funny as hell

3555
04:15:38,160 --> 04:15:39,760
Uh

3556
04:15:39,760 --> 04:15:42,720
Although it's funny. I like I definitely need to go outside

3557
04:15:43,280 --> 04:15:48,240
Because I'm about to revoke my own card with how light skin I am right now. I'm so pale

3558
04:15:48,960 --> 04:15:50,960
It's bad. Um

3559
04:15:51,600 --> 04:15:55,600
If I was thinking after the storms pass, I think it's gonna be storming for a little bit

3560
04:15:56,080 --> 04:16:01,040
But I'm gonna try to go to the beach. Um, I wanted my days off since I work from home

3561
04:16:02,560 --> 04:16:07,760
I I somebody I asked twitter. Oh, what should I tell people I do for my job and somebody said a government agent

3562
04:16:07,760 --> 04:16:12,160
So I think I might stick with that. She's funny in a racist. No, I'm not racist

3563
04:16:13,760 --> 04:16:16,080
I love all everybody from all walks of life

3564
04:16:16,720 --> 04:16:23,040
Trust me, uh, one of my best friend's dad is a very fucking racist person

3565
04:16:24,400 --> 04:16:26,400
Uh

3566
04:16:26,480 --> 04:16:33,120
It's so I'm not like them at all. So I'm like, that's my when I know if I start talking like him. I know I fucked up

3567
04:16:35,040 --> 04:16:40,400
I'm only pretend my 1949 moment. Oh, I told my parents about that scene

3568
04:16:41,040 --> 04:16:47,840
In fucking class of 09 my dad was laughing his ass off and my mom looked mortified. It was so fucking funny. Um

3569
04:16:49,680 --> 04:16:53,520
But it was it was yeah, I'm not racist. This is something gonna raise

3570
04:16:57,200 --> 04:17:02,800
No, I'm just I'm just silly. I'm just I'm a goof. I'm just a dark humor girl. I'm just uh, yeah

3571
04:17:03,920 --> 04:17:09,440
It's not racist. If you hit everyone equally. Yeah, I do. I prefer animals. That sounds weird. Um

3572
04:17:10,720 --> 04:17:13,600
I prefer, uh, my company of my cats

3573
04:17:14,400 --> 04:17:15,760
um

3574
04:17:15,760 --> 04:17:20,880
Doing anything fancy for pride month. No, I remember the last time I like actually did something for pride month

3575
04:17:20,960 --> 04:17:26,160
I did a really cool, uh, because I used to be a makeup youtuber as well not a makeup youtuber

3576
04:17:26,240 --> 04:17:28,560
I tried to do makeup

3577
04:17:29,200 --> 04:17:34,640
Videos on youtube and on instagram. I did a really cute like pan flag

3578
04:17:35,200 --> 04:17:38,480
Um, eye shadow. It came really nice came really nice

3579
04:17:39,280 --> 04:17:40,240
um

3580
04:17:40,400 --> 04:17:42,400
Why are we calling her racist?

3581
04:17:42,640 --> 04:17:48,400
Because they're silly. Well, me you're in the way. Oh, baby. Come here. Come here. Hi, baby

3582
04:17:52,400 --> 04:17:54,400
Why do you smell like my lotion?

3583
04:17:56,480 --> 04:18:01,520
You smell like you got into my fucking lotion. What are you? Are you good?

3584
04:18:03,040 --> 04:18:05,280
He was like that was high expression on his face

3585
04:18:06,240 --> 04:18:13,520
Influencer she be must have been a time. Yeah, you know, I wore many hats when I was

3586
04:18:14,880 --> 04:18:21,280
Going into content creation as a southern backman. I can tell you I'm not racist, but has preceded some of those wild shit

3587
04:18:22,080 --> 04:18:23,280
um

3588
04:18:23,280 --> 04:18:25,600
That reminds me of like that fucking vine

3589
04:18:26,160 --> 04:18:30,960
Of that one girl who's like, I'm not racist, but 80 people

3590
04:18:31,920 --> 04:18:36,080
But she's fucking loses it why lotion this is a cat

3591
04:18:36,960 --> 04:18:43,120
People there's lube and lotion lotion like my body lotion. He probably knocked it over. It's probably fucking exploded all right

3592
04:18:43,760 --> 04:18:45,760
My what should I call it? Um

3593
04:18:47,120 --> 04:18:49,120
Uh bathroom

3594
04:18:51,440 --> 04:18:56,560
He's someone's open hookups and then like he says something that I'm not racist. I will like any color hole

3595
04:18:57,360 --> 04:19:02,320
I think my favorite thing people say is this like I have I'm not racist. I have a black friend

3596
04:19:04,320 --> 04:19:06,960
I remember I remember somebody

3597
04:19:08,080 --> 04:19:09,600
like one of

3598
04:19:09,600 --> 04:19:11,520
My uh friends

3599
04:19:11,520 --> 04:19:15,440
Like we were in a group. I think we're going to like the movies or something. I don't remember what the fuck we were seeing

3600
04:19:15,840 --> 04:19:20,720
But one of them said that they're like I have a black friend and they pointed at me and I'm like, no man

3601
04:19:20,800 --> 04:19:22,800
I don't count. I'm only half a black person

3602
04:19:23,760 --> 04:19:26,320
Like you need you need to find another one to count as a full

3603
04:19:30,480 --> 04:19:32,480
I'm like, no

3604
04:19:36,000 --> 04:19:38,000
Need at least two. Mm-hmm

3605
04:19:38,720 --> 04:19:40,720
You know two halves must make a hole

3606
04:19:41,360 --> 04:19:43,360
and like it's funny because like

3607
04:19:44,160 --> 04:19:46,160
I'm like the most americanized

3608
04:19:48,080 --> 04:19:51,680
Like I'm not I didn't come from another country like my dad immigrated from Haiti

3609
04:19:52,320 --> 04:19:54,320
um

3610
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:59,760
And but like not when he was older like when he was like five. So my dad is very americanized too

3611
04:20:00,720 --> 04:20:02,400
and so

3612
04:20:02,400 --> 04:20:04,560
people like think I'm like very

3613
04:20:05,200 --> 04:20:06,320
like

3614
04:20:06,320 --> 04:20:08,320
cultural this or that

3615
04:20:08,320 --> 04:20:13,200
And like I can't like I've done my research because I you know, I owe it to myself to learn my culture

3616
04:20:13,440 --> 04:20:15,520
But then like I have my white girl moments

3617
04:20:18,000 --> 04:20:20,000
For sure for sure

3618
04:20:20,960 --> 04:20:25,760
I honestly heard the term racism thrown around the media consumes so much it kind of losses. Yeah, and like I like

3619
04:20:29,200 --> 04:20:34,080
I don't feel like like there's a lot of like races, but it's mostly like people that are fucking hateful

3620
04:20:34,880 --> 04:20:38,720
And it doesn't it's like different. I don't know. I can't really explain it

3621
04:20:40,160 --> 04:20:42,160
I got a half black friend

3622
04:20:42,800 --> 04:20:48,560
Bro, I had a friend who's indian trade have asked me since I'm africa. Can I see the

3623
04:20:51,120 --> 04:20:53,120
Bro

3624
04:20:53,360 --> 04:20:59,360
My civilization he has to recognize you forgot how to speak curl. Yeah, my my my dad is my dad speaks curl, but like

3625
04:21:00,800 --> 04:21:04,240
My grandmother says he has like an american accent when he speaks it

3626
04:21:08,400 --> 04:21:10,400
Pass is not conferrable

3627
04:21:12,960 --> 04:21:14,960
I

3628
04:21:15,120 --> 04:21:19,680
Yeah, I honestly I'm telling you class of 09 educated me with the

3629
04:21:20,400 --> 04:21:22,160
um

3630
04:21:22,160 --> 04:21:26,160
Like white nationalism versus white supremacists and I was like, oh

3631
04:21:27,920 --> 04:21:32,400
Okay, they both suck. What cool good to know the difference

3632
04:21:34,560 --> 04:21:38,080
Um, but yeah, it was just this is interesting

3633
04:21:39,040 --> 04:21:44,080
Why am I talking about this shit bro? Sometimes I'm like I

3634
04:21:46,000 --> 04:21:48,000
I can't wait to get

3635
04:21:48,240 --> 04:21:55,040
The lia fans because like then I can just be like no holds fucking bar because youtube is so

3636
04:21:56,720 --> 04:22:00,960
I hate having to keep cut down my vods when I I'm just talking to you guys

3637
04:22:01,360 --> 04:22:03,920
But I probably have to cut this vod down too

3638
04:22:04,640 --> 04:22:07,120
Because I just I can't be say so

3639
04:22:07,600 --> 04:22:12,640
But it's funny. I swear. I was more fucking say so when I was in india on twitch than I am now

3640
04:22:12,720 --> 04:22:15,760
I don't even and I'm in an agency. What the fuck is wrong with me?

3641
04:22:19,600 --> 04:22:21,600
Never the cause of it. I have much of an impact

3642
04:22:24,720 --> 04:22:28,560
Never asked a woman her age never asked a man so I never asked she'd be to not edit a

3643
04:22:29,760 --> 04:22:31,760
That's good

3644
04:22:32,320 --> 04:22:34,480
When I get the upload notice I can't go

3645
04:22:36,080 --> 04:22:39,040
I think I think you guys are a bad influence. It all started

3646
04:22:40,160 --> 04:22:43,920
When I started going on the interwebs when I was first becoming a vtuber

3647
04:22:45,840 --> 04:22:47,840
This is some not so savory sites

3648
04:22:50,080 --> 04:22:56,800
Fuck you guys corrupt me different fans bring up topics maybe. Oh, yeah, actually. Yeah, that's a that's a pretty good point

3649
04:22:57,520 --> 04:23:00,800
Uh, we have a different fan base. I have a different fan base than I did before

3650
04:23:01,680 --> 04:23:03,680
Um, that's true

3651
04:23:03,680 --> 04:23:05,520
like I know I

3652
04:23:05,520 --> 04:23:08,400
I have seen like one or two of my past

3653
04:23:09,200 --> 04:23:15,360
Like of rena's fans around but because of the constant I do now a lot of my fans don't watch me

3654
04:23:15,440 --> 04:23:20,640
Which is totally fine. I accept it. It sucks, you know, it's sad, but you know, I totally get it. Um

3655
04:23:22,000 --> 04:23:27,040
So I think yeah, it's it is a hundred percent a different fan base different questions different

3656
04:23:27,680 --> 04:23:28,880
um

3657
04:23:28,960 --> 04:23:30,960
Yeah

3658
04:23:31,760 --> 04:23:35,600
Fans reflect the streamer that that makes me sound really bad

3659
04:23:37,280 --> 04:23:40,480
Maybe we're just too submissive to stop holding from saying controversial stuff

3660
04:23:40,880 --> 04:23:46,480
But like is it I'm thinking I'm like, do I really say controversial stuff? I don't

3661
04:23:47,840 --> 04:23:53,520
Think like I feel like I don't know. I feel like I'm just real. I don't really think I'm controversial

3662
04:23:55,600 --> 04:23:58,480
I find it weird that you're so open about your past life. Um

3663
04:23:59,600 --> 04:24:01,600
Yeah, see not really. Um

3664
04:24:02,960 --> 04:24:06,560
We're allowed to be open about our past life. It's fine. Um

3665
04:24:07,360 --> 04:24:10,640
If I there's nothing against us to talk about it

3666
04:24:11,200 --> 04:24:16,320
Strani said that when we debuted we can even just we can we can tell our fans that um

3667
04:24:18,000 --> 04:24:21,840
Uh that we are in v alert all I did was post a meme on my

3668
04:24:22,960 --> 04:24:25,520
My rena account when I was rena no way. Um

3669
04:24:25,520 --> 04:24:26,640
Um

3670
04:24:26,640 --> 04:24:30,560
But I didn't really feel the need to I had a small community

3671
04:24:31,440 --> 04:24:33,440
I knew they would find me if they wanted to

3672
04:24:34,000 --> 04:24:36,000
um, so yeah

3673
04:24:36,080 --> 04:24:38,880
Don't have to pretend you didn't exist until the other yeah

3674
04:24:39,600 --> 04:24:41,600
Not controversial but edgy

3675
04:24:42,240 --> 04:24:44,000
I don't really think I'm edgy

3676
04:24:44,000 --> 04:24:47,680
I don't even think I'm based look at fucking emmy emmy's way more base than I am you kidding me

3677
04:24:48,480 --> 04:24:50,480
Oh my god, you exist before two weeks ago

3678
04:24:51,120 --> 04:24:57,600
She entered one time. I think she changed grew up on it molded by the perversion there whole life. Yeah

3679
04:24:58,240 --> 04:25:00,240
I never been I I literally

3680
04:25:02,240 --> 04:25:04,240
Yes, like literally six months ago

3681
04:25:06,000 --> 04:25:12,160
Actually, no not six months. It'll be a year because I was uh, I was a refling. I was an og refling. So that's a lie. Um

3682
04:25:14,080 --> 04:25:17,840
Been on the grind for 56 years things getting too sensitive

3683
04:25:18,800 --> 04:25:22,720
So you didn't tell your old community I posted it so like you know the lore

3684
04:25:23,520 --> 04:25:25,440
um picture

3685
04:25:25,440 --> 04:25:27,440
of like me

3686
04:25:27,440 --> 04:25:30,960
Holding queen's hand as she's dying in a hospital bed

3687
04:25:32,000 --> 04:25:34,960
Somebody who had figured out who I was

3688
04:25:35,680 --> 04:25:41,200
When we uh did our voice reveals edited rena as queen in the bed

3689
04:25:42,160 --> 04:25:49,280
Dying of sickness and me as she be holding her hand and it sent me so I just posted that

3690
04:25:50,400 --> 04:25:54,080
And like like she's like passing the torch, but like it made perfect sense

3691
04:25:54,080 --> 04:25:56,320
It was like rena's passing the torch to she be

3692
04:25:57,040 --> 04:25:58,560
You know, I thought it was great

3693
04:25:58,560 --> 04:26:04,320
So I'm like so I just posted that and everybody responded with lmao and like they thought I was hilarious

3694
04:26:04,400 --> 04:26:06,640
And I shout out to that person who made that fucking meme

3695
04:26:11,200 --> 04:26:15,520
I'm dying. Stop be boxing caption. That would have been funny. Um

3696
04:26:16,720 --> 04:26:23,120
And yeah, like we're we're allowed to talk about this stuff. I'm very thankful for the fan base I had back then

3697
04:26:23,840 --> 04:26:25,360
um

3698
04:26:25,360 --> 04:26:29,520
And they knew how much I wanted to be an agency and they believed in me more than than I did

3699
04:26:30,320 --> 04:26:33,760
And I thank them for that because I would not be here if it weren't for them

3700
04:26:33,840 --> 04:26:37,680
I would have no audience. I had no one to stream to and but they gave me a chance

3701
04:26:38,640 --> 04:26:44,480
Um, but yeah, where can I see that meme? Uh, you can't see it because I I nuked

3702
04:26:45,120 --> 04:26:46,320
uh

3703
04:26:46,320 --> 04:26:51,280
All of my past life stuff. So like you may notice that I

3704
04:26:52,480 --> 04:26:54,480
um

3705
04:26:54,480 --> 04:26:57,200
Went on an indefinite hiatus as rena

3706
04:26:57,840 --> 04:27:04,240
Uh, I'll be honest with you. She's essentially graduated. I just did a definite hiatus because

3707
04:27:04,960 --> 04:27:05,920
um

3708
04:27:06,000 --> 04:27:09,920
Rina means a lot to me as she represents rena who is my cat

3709
04:27:10,480 --> 04:27:14,880
Um, so I and rena is a seimees cat. So I wanted to

3710
04:27:15,520 --> 04:27:23,120
I made a character after her because rena is my baby. Um, so that when rena passes on which she is older

3711
04:27:23,200 --> 04:27:29,360
She's 14. It will happen eventually. I'm mentally prepared for that. Um, that she lives on

3712
04:27:30,560 --> 04:27:33,360
With rena. I actually might just change rena's name to rena

3713
04:27:34,160 --> 04:27:38,880
To be honest with you, but I will not be going back to rena. Um

3714
04:27:40,240 --> 04:27:44,320
I will be she be I am she be she be is me. I am her

3715
04:27:45,440 --> 04:27:47,920
We are each other. Um, some people

3716
04:27:48,640 --> 04:27:53,840
Uh, presumed because I made her an indefinite hiatus that like they thought I was gonna go back

3717
04:27:54,320 --> 04:27:59,600
And somebody mentioned that um, I had commissioned a lot of stuff like for a whole new fucking

3718
04:28:00,320 --> 04:28:05,280
Like asset package and debut thing and model and everything for rena

3719
04:28:06,640 --> 04:28:08,800
But then I was hired to be a lure so I can't use it

3720
04:28:08,800 --> 04:28:13,360
And so as people saw posts of like my assets being in showcases and they're like, wow

3721
04:28:13,760 --> 04:28:18,960
She's just planning on going back bro. I commissioned those back in fucking february chill out

3722
04:28:20,400 --> 04:28:22,400
I'm not gonna be rena

3723
04:28:22,800 --> 04:28:26,240
She is sleeping. She's good. She's fine

3724
04:28:26,960 --> 04:28:32,000

3728
04:28:50,160 --> 04:28:52,160

04:28:52,480 --> 04:28:54,480

3731
04:29:00,640 --> 04:29:05,920
I can be very sweet. I'm a very sweet and kind and caring person. I'm a fucking empathetic person

3732
04:29:06,560 --> 04:29:08,720
Um, that's why I cry like a bitch half the time

3733
04:29:10,240 --> 04:29:13,840
Because I just get so emotional because I feel so deeply and I love so deeply

3734
04:29:14,560 --> 04:29:19,200
Um, vtuber's teaching ideas is like a crazy personality disorder. I'll be honest with you like

3735
04:29:20,000 --> 04:29:25,440
That's what I love about being a vtuber is that you have so many possibilities

3736
04:29:26,000 --> 04:29:32,880
Um, like I if I wanted to for my 2.0. I could just be like, I'm no longer a rabbit. I'm a slug girl

3737
04:29:33,520 --> 04:29:38,400
I'm a slime girl. Um, I'm the slime girl. I wanted gen two

3738
04:29:38,960 --> 04:29:47,280
Uh, like when you have the money to do so the support the right artists the assets like you can be who you want

3739
04:29:47,280 --> 04:29:54,640
And that's what I love about vtubing. I was so put in a box as a flash streamer. Um, when I was one and as a

3740
04:29:55,520 --> 04:29:57,840
It's just so fun to play around as a vtuber

3741
04:29:58,560 --> 04:30:02,240
Um, I can be anyone I can I can it's it's just it's honestly great

Like that was really fun and I'm doing that next week too

3752
04:30:45,680 --> 04:30:48,080
Invest in your oh she so she doesn't have to go anywhere

3753
04:30:49,760 --> 04:30:52,160
This is why we need a crying harlot emo. Oh

3754
04:30:52,880 --> 04:30:55,840
Damn, I should have I should have come because I just put in a request

3755
04:30:57,520 --> 04:30:59,520
For more emotes so

3756
04:31:01,040 --> 04:31:04,480
Um, although I don't know if you did know me as rina you

3757
04:31:05,040 --> 04:31:11,200
Know that I one of my famous emotes that was used very often by multiple people was my crying emo

3758
04:31:11,520 --> 04:31:14,240
So I am I did commission that as she be

3759
04:31:15,680 --> 04:31:17,680
My what the fuck is going on emo

3760
04:31:19,680 --> 04:31:22,560
Because that that that that's that's always been a funny meme

3761
04:31:23,680 --> 04:31:29,520
It's better to invest in oh she rather than crypto. Yeah, that's true. You know what you you know what you're getting you know your returns

3762
04:31:34,400 --> 04:31:38,400
Said it before she because she put the shrug model in still watch that'd be fucking funny

3763
04:31:39,680 --> 04:31:41,680
Know if any spicy arts still exist

3764
04:31:41,840 --> 04:31:44,000
of

3765
04:31:44,080 --> 04:31:46,080
Cheebie

3766
04:31:47,280 --> 04:31:48,560
Yeah

3767
04:31:48,560 --> 04:31:52,240
Yeah, um or rina. I know there is spicy art of rina

3768
04:31:52,560 --> 04:31:57,040
Um, I even I commissioned spicy art of rina for one of my previous donathan

3769
04:31:57,760 --> 04:31:59,760
That I did for fias medical bills

3770
04:32:00,400 --> 04:32:06,640
Um when I was rina and I it's still I again I commissioned that in fucking march and it's not there

3771
04:32:06,720 --> 04:32:08,720
So I feel really fucking bad about that

3772
04:32:09,360 --> 04:32:11,360
Uh, I wondering if my

3773
04:32:12,080 --> 04:32:14,640
The skeb artist goes to me for that which sucks

3774
04:32:15,680 --> 04:32:18,560
I'm gonna buy nfts. No bad for the environment

3775
04:32:19,120 --> 04:32:20,400
Um

3776
04:32:20,400 --> 04:32:22,800
And they're also fucking waste of money. You can't do shit with them

3777
04:32:23,680 --> 04:32:25,760
I'm just gonna copy paste your fucking nft

3778
04:32:26,400 --> 04:32:28,400
invest in a she be coin

3779
04:32:28,960 --> 04:32:31,120
Blind bunny. Yeah, slight money would actually be pretty cool

3780
04:32:31,600 --> 04:32:36,720
No, because I'm a element now anatomy kind of as you took me back a little. Yeah, some people like as I've I've I've

3781
04:32:37,200 --> 04:32:38,960
Did that with rina too

3782
04:32:38,960 --> 04:32:42,480
They're limited to emotes is that a limit only and not your best in the art for it. Um

3783
04:32:43,600 --> 04:32:47,360
I think there is like a limit for emotes like on youtube

3784
04:32:47,920 --> 04:32:51,280
I again, I'm not I'm not far super familiar with youtube's

3785
04:32:51,920 --> 04:32:53,520
YouTube's

3786
04:32:53,520 --> 04:32:57,200
With youtube and their policy on how many emotes you can have I

3787
04:32:58,160 --> 04:33:02,240
Like so I have like I already have more than the four that you're using

3788
04:33:03,040 --> 04:33:04,800
um

3789
04:33:04,800 --> 04:33:08,080
Like I I have a crying one. I have some other ones

3790
04:33:08,880 --> 04:33:11,920
Uh, and then I got 10 more that

3791
04:33:12,720 --> 04:33:14,240
I'm that um

3792
04:33:14,240 --> 04:33:16,000
I commissioned

3793
04:33:16,000 --> 04:33:18,160
and so

3794
04:33:18,160 --> 04:33:20,560
I don't so I'm assuming I can have around like

3795
04:33:21,280 --> 04:33:26,000
15 maybe 20. I don't know. Yeah, there's no 17. Yeah

3796
04:33:27,600 --> 04:33:29,600
Um

3797
04:33:29,680 --> 04:33:31,680
I want to say like 50 ish. Yeah. Oh, okay

3798
04:33:32,480 --> 04:33:39,280
Well, where are they? I don't know like I commissioned. Well, oh the ones we I we just commissioned our emotes like more emotes

3799
04:33:39,760 --> 04:33:44,080
Um, the other ones. I don't know why they're all not added there. Again. I don't know how youtube works

3800
04:33:44,160 --> 04:33:48,640
I don't meant manager set up account. So I don't know. I don't know if I can know

3801
04:33:49,360 --> 04:33:50,800
um

3802
04:33:50,800 --> 04:33:52,960
You can put bttv on youtube. Oh, okay

3803
04:33:54,400 --> 04:34:00,320
Are there any plans for management yourself? I'm making a discord server for you vealer as a whole now that you mentioned emotes and stuff

3804
04:34:01,040 --> 04:34:03,280
You can't there's a notification server

3805
04:34:03,840 --> 04:34:05,840
Um, just for our

3806
04:34:05,840 --> 04:34:10,480
And everybody's safety. We're not gonna have a personal server that we frequent. Um,

3807
04:34:11,040 --> 04:34:14,000
I know there's like fan servers and stuff and that's cool and all

3808
04:34:14,400 --> 04:34:20,240
Which also the people who run the fan server if you're watching can you please change it to not look like our official

3809
04:34:20,880 --> 04:34:26,320
Fucking twitter. I will get notifications if you like my stuff and I think it's our official twitter, but it's not

3810
04:34:26,800 --> 04:34:29,920
Um, make it make your own fucking logo. Um

3811
04:34:31,280 --> 04:34:33,520
Yeah, just because like we don't need groomer cords

3812
04:34:33,600 --> 04:34:37,760
We don't need people getting like feeling like they're being favored or the fuck like Jesus

3813
04:34:38,320 --> 04:34:41,520
I don't feel like dealing with that shit. It's so much. You don't need that

3814
04:34:41,840 --> 04:34:44,480
Um, I know you guys want to hang out with us, but you can hang out with me right now

3815
04:34:44,960 --> 04:34:46,960
I'm talking to you face to face

3816
04:34:47,840 --> 04:34:51,360
Anime girl to titties to viewer, you know

3817
04:34:52,880 --> 04:34:59,920
I think it's I think it's better this way for everyone. We don't we don't need that. Um, you know, trust me

3818
04:35:00,000 --> 04:35:01,840
I would love to be

3819
04:35:01,840 --> 04:35:07,200
In a discord with everybody, but and I know I would behave. It's just how some people act

3820
04:35:07,840 --> 04:35:10,720
Uh in a discord when there is a

3821
04:35:11,600 --> 04:35:13,600
talent in there, um

3822
04:35:14,640 --> 04:35:16,640
Sometimes they uh

3823
04:35:17,200 --> 04:35:19,920
Because they're in closer proximity to the the talent they

3824
04:35:20,800 --> 04:35:22,800
They feel like they're owed something and could like

3825
04:35:23,520 --> 04:35:27,920
Spam them harass them blah blah blah blah and like I don't feel like fucking dealing with that

3826
04:35:28,000 --> 04:35:30,160
Management doesn't feel like fucking dealing with that. Um

3827
04:35:31,360 --> 04:35:34,480
Vibes can really fucking weird. Yeah, like I've seen I've been in

3828
04:35:35,040 --> 04:35:36,880
discords where those talents are there

3829
04:35:37,520 --> 04:35:40,080
And it's kind of a fucking shit show. So

3830
04:35:40,960 --> 04:35:42,960
I think it's better like

3831
04:35:43,280 --> 04:35:45,280
Yeah

3832
04:35:45,440 --> 04:35:47,440
Yeah

3833
04:35:47,680 --> 04:35:52,320
She doesn't want to talk to us. She hates this. No, no, god, like I would talk to you all the time

3834
04:35:52,640 --> 04:35:55,520
Like I literally fucking quit my job so I could be with you more

3835
04:35:55,520 --> 04:35:57,520
Like

3836
04:35:58,560 --> 04:36:04,320
Come on be for real. Um, I'm tempted to I'm thinking about making um

3837
04:36:05,360 --> 04:36:09,520
I've seen other streamers do this where they add their, uh

3838
04:36:11,360 --> 04:36:14,240
Actually, maybe that's not the best idea. I'd have to ask management about it

3839
04:36:14,240 --> 04:36:20,480
But I've seen people add their schedule as a video and they'll like give updates in that pre chat from time to time

3840
04:36:21,040 --> 04:36:24,880
Um, but yeah, because you know, there's there's a there's a line you can't

3841
04:36:25,120 --> 04:36:28,880
Like you have to be careful and like have a line you can't cross

3842
04:36:29,440 --> 04:36:32,560
Just so people don't get hurt. Like I don't want people to be hurt

3843
04:36:33,200 --> 04:36:38,160
Um, like I know I see you was very upset. Um, because somebody hurt her feelings

3844
04:36:38,240 --> 04:36:41,760
And I don't want anybody else to feel that way viewer or talent. So

3845
04:36:42,720 --> 04:36:46,240
It's sometimes we got to do stuff that protects our mental health

3846
04:36:46,960 --> 04:36:51,280
Um, but yeah, like, you know, you see me pop into like preach out a couple times

3847
04:36:52,160 --> 04:36:57,520
Um, but yeah, I was thinking about a free chat. I'd have to ask management though. Um, but yeah

3848
04:37:00,000 --> 04:37:02,000
The other girls are free to

3849
04:37:02,000 --> 04:37:07,440
Reach out like that. Yeah, does she do it like in the video of that day or does she have like an actual thing?

3850
04:37:09,920 --> 04:37:13,040
Someone made the girls cry and pop in the trunk

3851
04:37:14,160 --> 04:37:16,160
No, yes. No someone. Yeah

3852
04:37:16,720 --> 04:37:18,720
I

3853
04:37:19,360 --> 04:37:25,440
Keep yeah, well like I'll I'll keep you close like again, like you guys said chart reflect streamer. Um

3854
04:37:26,480 --> 04:37:30,720
I know my boundaries. I would tell you guys if you ever I ever thought you guys crossed them

3855
04:37:31,440 --> 04:37:32,720
Um

3856
04:37:32,720 --> 04:37:37,040
But you guys are very well behaved. I don't feel any sort of way for that

3857
04:37:37,600 --> 04:37:40,000
Oh, I mean as a schedule free chat. Oh, okay

3858
04:37:42,000 --> 04:37:43,840
Wait, huh

3859
04:37:43,840 --> 04:37:45,440
Why didn't

3860
04:37:45,440 --> 04:37:47,440
Was I supposed to do that?

3861
04:37:48,560 --> 04:37:50,560
Why am I so fucking dumb?

3862
04:37:53,520 --> 04:37:55,520
Oh gurra's streaming

3863
04:37:56,720 --> 04:38:00,960
Her 3d bird I'm oh guys I'm overlapping gurra. I might have to end stream

3864
04:38:02,720 --> 04:38:04,720
Jesus fuck

3865
04:38:07,680 --> 04:38:08,720
Wait

3866
04:38:08,720 --> 04:38:12,240
Why the oh, I'm like, why did Amy just mention me as I'm talking to her?

3867
04:38:12,240 --> 04:38:14,960
She just tagged me because she she blew up on the tweeters

3868
04:38:17,840 --> 04:38:20,080
Damn, what the fuck she did blow up on the tweeters

3869
04:38:20,960 --> 04:38:24,080
Hey, she caught up to me. Yay. Let's fucking go

3870
04:38:25,920 --> 04:38:27,920
I was hoping the girls would fucking catch up to me in the

3871
04:38:29,040 --> 04:38:32,480
So awkward having so many people in my fucking old. Um

3872
04:38:33,920 --> 04:38:35,920
She'll probably pass me soon enough

3873
04:38:36,720 --> 04:38:38,720
Where is it? Where is her?

3874
04:38:39,360 --> 04:38:40,560
I can't

3875
04:38:40,560 --> 04:38:43,520
Because then I want to see how she set it up so I can replicate it

3876
04:38:52,640 --> 04:38:56,320
Just creeping on your account. Amy just creeping on your account

3877
04:38:57,520 --> 04:39:00,160
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Amy

3878
04:39:01,200 --> 04:39:04,800
It's okay. Just accept it. Amy. Where the fuck is it?

3879
04:39:05,840 --> 04:39:09,840
Where is it? Where is it? I don't see that

3880
04:39:11,360 --> 04:39:13,360
I don't see the free chat. Oh, I found it

3881
04:39:16,000 --> 04:39:21,680
That's cool. Oh schedule and free chat. Oh, and she does it for like three years. Oh, okay

3882
04:39:25,200 --> 04:39:29,360

3885
04:39:36,880 --> 04:39:38,880
Okay. Oh, yeah, I'll do that for next week

3886
04:39:39,760 --> 04:39:41,760
Nifty what's today?

3887
04:39:44,160 --> 04:39:47,360
Is it Thursday? Yes, it's Thursday. Do I stream tomorrow?

3888
04:39:49,760 --> 04:39:51,600

3889
04:39:51,600 --> 04:39:54,640
I forgot what day it was. I don't know where I am half the time

3890
04:39:55,920 --> 04:39:57,920
But yeah, I'll do something like that

3891
04:40:00,160 --> 04:40:02,960
Who's girl how the fuck do you not know who girl is?

3892
04:40:03,840 --> 04:40:05,840

That live stream to go live for like a year from now. Yeah, okay

3894
04:40:10,320 --> 04:40:14,000
Oh, she be do you think you could take her on a fight if you had to be her ass

3895
04:40:15,200 --> 04:40:18,800
Excuse me. I would not harm that shark. Are you kidding me?

3896
04:40:19,600 --> 04:40:24,160
I would treat that shark as a princess mostly because I'm scared of hollow fans

3897
04:40:27,280 --> 04:40:32,160
I'll give you an activity streaming tomorrow in the collab. Is it tomorrow? Yes

3898
04:40:32,880 --> 04:40:36,880
I am in the collab. It's not on my schedule, but I'm there

3899
04:40:38,240 --> 04:40:40,240
What if you had to no?

3900
04:40:40,800 --> 04:40:46,720
I got the majority of the vtuber rabbit hole last year via indy so I learned to follow away after I'm like it I

3901
04:40:47,280 --> 04:40:50,080
It's very interesting to me where people find like

3902
04:40:50,800 --> 04:40:56,560
Agencies or indies before they do the big names. It's but I've noticed that happening a lot more often

3903
04:40:57,440 --> 04:40:59,440
um

3904
04:40:59,840 --> 04:41:01,840
But yeah

3905
04:41:03,040 --> 04:41:05,040
I'm valid

3906
04:41:07,760 --> 04:41:11,040
Hard girl the sush shark kid. She's not sush. She's a shark

3907
04:41:12,080 --> 04:41:16,880
It's the 20th teams. I don't again. I don't remember where I am half the time

3908
04:41:19,680 --> 04:41:24,240
Girl is the first vtuber I watched. Um, yeah, the first vtuber I watched was kazuna ai

3909
04:41:25,200 --> 04:41:29,840
And then I watched co-amigo, but I never really considered her a vtuber. Um

3910
04:41:33,040 --> 04:41:35,040
Let's see. Who else did I watch?

3911
04:41:35,760 --> 04:41:41,920
And I watched a little bit of hollow. I would watch polymyth naturally. Um, I watched kiara

3912
04:41:43,760 --> 04:41:45,760
And then

3913
04:41:45,760 --> 04:41:47,760
I had to stop myself from falling in love with shiwari

3914
04:41:50,560 --> 04:41:54,000
Um, listen, I love messy manhara

3915
04:41:54,720 --> 04:41:56,080
looking types

3916
04:41:56,080 --> 04:41:58,880
If we had a goth chick like that and gen 2

3917
04:41:59,440 --> 04:42:01,440
I would die. Um

3918
04:42:03,840 --> 04:42:09,520
Let's see. Yeah, and then I and then I just watched a lot of agency vtubers like smaller agencies. So like idol

3919
04:42:10,720 --> 04:42:12,720
um

3920
04:42:13,120 --> 04:42:16,000
Pixel link and projects like I watch

3921
04:42:17,520 --> 04:42:18,640
Yeah

3922
04:42:18,640 --> 04:42:24,640
Watched a little bit of vrevery like rana. She was cool. Just sucks because I really fucking graduated

3923
04:42:24,880 --> 04:42:26,880
I

3924
04:42:28,000 --> 04:42:30,000
Miss isn't that mercy?

3925
04:42:30,400 --> 04:42:32,720
No, she's not goth

3926
04:42:34,000 --> 04:42:38,640
I don't think mercy doesn't look goth to me. She says I'm thinking. Yeah, no

3927
04:42:40,080 --> 04:42:43,600
See me a while just chatting started chatting with you there though. Yeah, I feel that

3928
04:42:44,640 --> 04:42:47,040
Which one is your oh sheet? I don't have to tell you

3929
04:42:48,800 --> 04:42:51,680
I don't have to tell you any of my oh sheets are for me to know

3930
04:42:52,400 --> 04:42:54,400
And I hold them close to my heart

3931
04:42:55,040 --> 04:42:57,040
Or not for anybody else

3932
04:42:57,440 --> 04:42:58,560
Corony

3933
04:42:58,560 --> 04:43:00,560
What can I click?

3934
04:43:00,800 --> 04:43:07,520
Dory, gen 2, mercy would be mad. Oh, I thought you said mercy would be mad if that happened. Uh, no, uh, yeah

3935
04:43:07,600 --> 04:43:10,960
No, that would be that would oh the power those two would have

3936
04:43:13,760 --> 04:43:19,440
Literally my name was my name was originally graveyard for them. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you have fucking runatics. Oh

3937
04:43:20,080 --> 04:43:21,520
That's uh

3938
04:43:21,520 --> 04:43:27,040
The thorn lines. Yeah, but it's it's nice that you can find those people other places now like they're they're doing okay

3939
04:43:27,360 --> 04:43:28,480
so

3940
04:43:28,480 --> 04:43:30,720
He's trying to gatekeep. I am gatekeeping. Oh, she

3941
04:43:32,320 --> 04:43:34,560
Like why do you guys need to know who my oh she is?

3942
04:43:37,120 --> 04:43:39,120
They're not like me at all that's for sure

3943
04:43:39,760 --> 04:43:42,320
They're very talented very talented. Um

3944
04:43:44,000 --> 04:43:48,080
I would watch we cheaper highlights from time to time and never got into them until you guys debut

3945
04:43:48,320 --> 04:43:51,280
Yeah, yeah, I like I love watching me two bird debuts

3946
04:43:54,480 --> 04:43:56,480
Quick

3947
04:43:56,960 --> 04:44:02,000
But you got like they're not it's not like they're not a popular person like they're very well known

3948
04:44:04,160 --> 04:44:06,160
Nova's still fun of you ever again

3949
04:44:07,680 --> 04:44:10,640
Feel bad for the you every girls

3950
04:44:12,400 --> 04:44:14,400
Hope they bounce back

04:44:14,800 --> 04:44:18,800
Can I tell you my oh, yeah, you guys can tell me your oh, she's oh wait, are you gonna say fucking me?

3952
04:44:20,320 --> 04:44:23,120
And I'll honestly be a lair is the first group to pull me off a hollow plant

3953
04:44:24,560 --> 04:44:29,040
I see some words seems like I missed out on some good time staying there for so long

3954
04:44:29,520 --> 04:44:34,160
You know, but it's like it's cool to prevent venture out because like again, I feel like

3955
04:44:35,280 --> 04:44:37,280
It's it's a lot more intimate being

3956
04:44:37,920 --> 04:44:43,520
In a smaller um agency like chat like you can see you can interact with each other

3957
04:44:44,080 --> 04:44:49,280
You probably recognize each other's names. Uh, I can talk to you. I recognize a lot of you

3958
04:44:49,680 --> 04:44:52,080
It's a nice small little chat and we're hanging out

3959
04:44:53,600 --> 04:45:00,320
She used my kamiyoshi. God damn that just weird like it just doesn't make any sense to me that people like me that much

3960
04:45:00,480 --> 04:45:02,480
to call me their kamiyoshi and

3961
04:45:04,000 --> 04:45:08,640
I yeah, I don't even know what to say besides thank you because I just never thought

3962
04:45:09,600 --> 04:45:13,760
Like being like when I was indian never thought anybody would ever tell me that

3963
04:45:16,160 --> 04:45:20,400
Make more 200 rather than 2000. Yeah, I like having small chat

3964
04:45:25,040 --> 04:45:30,880
I only remember you because you keep saying you lost your job and then you went to the other girl's chat and said you lost your job

3965
04:45:32,480 --> 04:45:34,480
And I was like, why are you telling everybody?

3966
04:45:35,440 --> 04:45:42,320
And remember this there's a saying move in silence bro make money moves move in silence

3967
04:45:45,040 --> 04:45:47,920
She don't yeah, and I notice you on other girls chats too. Don't you forget

3968
04:45:50,080 --> 04:45:54,640
More of a casual vtuber fan and watch the content like and the first thing I enjoy don't really have an oshi

3969
04:45:54,720 --> 04:45:57,280
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like I'm the same way

3970
04:45:58,000 --> 04:46:01,520
Except like there's someone just like I watch the most and that's who I call my oshi

3971
04:46:02,480 --> 04:46:07,680
He lost a new job each time move in silence like lasagna

3972
04:46:08,960 --> 04:46:10,960
Like the gene lasagna

3973
04:46:11,680 --> 04:46:13,680
Like the end of lasagna

3974
04:46:15,040 --> 04:46:17,360
Yeah, identifying you in maros. Oh

3975
04:46:18,640 --> 04:46:20,080
100%

3976
04:46:20,080 --> 04:46:24,160
they'll become a loved and respected figure in the industry. That's very sweet and

3977
04:46:24,960 --> 04:46:26,960
Honestly, that's the goal. I want

3978
04:46:28,160 --> 04:46:30,160
I want to be

3979
04:46:31,040 --> 04:46:32,640
I want to have the same

3980
04:46:32,640 --> 04:46:35,680
I don't it sounds really fucking pretentious when I say this but like

3981
04:46:36,480 --> 04:46:38,480
I really want

3982
04:46:38,480 --> 04:46:40,480
that

3983
04:46:40,480 --> 04:46:42,480
Pull that like the big

3984
04:46:42,960 --> 04:46:44,960
some of the big twitch indies do

3985
04:46:45,680 --> 04:46:46,960
or like

3986
04:46:46,960 --> 04:46:50,320
Like I just I want to be the person that like everybody

3987
04:46:51,440 --> 04:46:56,880
Knows is like cool and chill and you could talk to me and hang out and we can always collab and

3988
04:46:57,840 --> 04:46:59,280
um

3989
04:46:59,280 --> 04:47:03,840
And just like just have a bunch of fucking friends. Like that's all I want. I just want a bunch of fucking friends

3990
04:47:04,720 --> 04:47:06,400
um

3991
04:47:06,400 --> 04:47:10,560
In the industry it would be cool just to like kind of have that sort of

3992
04:47:11,040 --> 04:47:15,440
Like I don't want to be as famous as iron mouse, but like have a sort of like air about me, you know

3993
04:47:17,120 --> 04:47:18,880
Like tomah. Yeah

3994
04:47:18,880 --> 04:47:24,880
Tomah's cool. I love tomah. She sends me tiktoks all the time. I can't keep up with all the tiktok. She sends me

3995
04:47:25,840 --> 04:47:27,840
I

3996
04:47:28,240 --> 04:47:31,840
Knew at a place here. I saw a robot taking the debut. Uh, yeah, I need to rewatch

3997
04:47:31,920 --> 04:47:36,000
I was thinking that because I was cleaning and I was like I found my robotech discs

3998
04:47:36,240 --> 04:47:38,640
And my dad let me and I'm like oh, I need I should rewatch these

3999
04:47:39,120 --> 04:47:41,520
Um, I haven't watched robotech in a very long time

4000
04:47:43,120 --> 04:47:45,360
I already found your cool. So I think you're getting there. Thanks

4001
04:47:46,480 --> 04:47:53,120
Uh, tomah is a tiger. Oh, no, that's uh, toto. Tomah is um a monkey little monkey. Yeah

4002
04:47:54,080 --> 04:48:00,080
Oh, yeah, she'd be a knower. Yeah, that's what I want. And yeah, like I've said this before you're watching the hollow justice debut tomorrow

4003
04:48:00,480 --> 04:48:02,480
Probably I usually wait for them to debut

4004
04:48:03,200 --> 04:48:05,200
Ayo

4005
04:48:06,320 --> 04:48:09,360
Oh, thanks. What the fuck dude?

4006
04:48:11,120 --> 04:48:13,120
You didn't have to do that

4007
04:48:13,200 --> 04:48:14,880
Thank you

4008
04:48:14,880 --> 04:48:19,200
Can we get some can we get some chads in the chat for doki? How they am?

4009
04:48:19,200 --> 04:48:21,200
Oh

4010
04:48:21,440 --> 04:48:28,400
Very nice. Thank you so much. I appreciate that so much. I hope so. I want to make you guys proud. I want to be

4011
04:48:29,680 --> 04:48:33,280
I want to be the best for you for you guys and I want to be the best for the community

4012
04:48:34,000 --> 04:48:36,000
You know, I want to I want to make a difference

4013
04:48:37,680 --> 04:48:41,280
And I know on the way there I'll make mistakes. I'll learn I'll grow and all that stuff

4014
04:48:41,440 --> 04:48:45,120
Fia, what are you doing? She's scratching my chair. But yeah, you know, I want to do that

4015
04:48:45,920 --> 04:48:47,920
um

4016
04:48:48,160 --> 04:48:54,240
Again, my only fear is that people won't want to spend time with the girls and vealer and myself because of the content we do

4017
04:48:54,720 --> 04:48:56,720
We're already feeling it. Um

4018
04:48:57,520 --> 04:48:59,200
for some things

4019
04:48:59,200 --> 04:49:00,160
like

4020
04:49:00,160 --> 04:49:02,160
I really want to be friend

4021
04:49:02,240 --> 04:49:04,240
people and other agencies, but I

4022
04:49:06,240 --> 04:49:08,240
I know that

4023
04:49:08,480 --> 04:49:09,760
because of

4024
04:49:09,760 --> 04:49:12,240
who we are who strani was that

4025
04:49:14,000 --> 04:49:17,280
You know, we might not be afforded some friendships, but yeah

4026
04:49:17,920 --> 04:49:19,920
It is what it is

4027
04:49:20,160 --> 04:49:22,720
uh, it's water under the bridge for all of us, but

4028
04:49:25,680 --> 04:49:27,680
This sucks

4029
04:49:29,280 --> 04:49:32,640
You know, I'm that type of person who I want to be friends with everybody

4030
04:49:34,000 --> 04:49:36,000
Because I have a desire to be liked

4031
04:49:37,840 --> 04:49:41,760
Yeah, yeah, it's just the nature of business. This is the nature of agencies

4032
04:49:42,640 --> 04:49:44,640
um, it's the nature of you know

4033
04:49:45,120 --> 04:49:50,080
Some people seeing us like it was a competition, although I don't really see it that way like they were like, oh

4034
04:49:50,800 --> 04:49:52,800
My melody better my melody

4035
04:49:53,040 --> 04:49:58,160
Uh project melody better watch out for realer. No girl. I just want to learn from her. Are you kidding me?

4036
04:49:59,440 --> 04:50:02,800
This is like I ain't competition to fucking project melody. No

4037
04:50:03,920 --> 04:50:08,080
I don't do half the shit she does. I like to learn how she does her stuff though

4038
04:50:08,160 --> 04:50:12,480
That'd be fucking cool and with con tail VA and all the girls from twitch

4039
04:50:12,800 --> 04:50:14,320
playing

4040
04:50:14,320 --> 04:50:16,320
um

4041
04:50:16,480 --> 04:50:19,360
He's a wild take a while to get on the fucking level, you know

4042
04:50:20,160 --> 04:50:25,920
The only thing that we're doing differently is that we just have naughty ASMR and we say the the quiet shit out loud

4043
04:50:26,000 --> 04:50:28,080
Most of the girl like yeah, that's yeah

4044
04:50:29,040 --> 04:50:31,920
And I'm happy because I thought there was some

4045
04:50:32,800 --> 04:50:36,480
That wouldn't like us, but they they started interacting with us now. So I'm hopeful

4046
04:50:36,880 --> 04:50:38,880
I

4047
04:50:40,640 --> 04:50:43,040
Thank you friends. Did you make you'll be loyal? I hope so

4048
04:50:43,920 --> 04:50:46,880
I don't I'm not again. I said I'm the type of person like if something's wrong

4049
04:50:46,960 --> 04:50:53,120
Like I'll I'll confront somebody so because I hate drama. I just I just want people to be happy

4050
04:50:54,240 --> 04:50:56,720
I just want everybody to be okay and be happy and be friends

4051
04:50:58,400 --> 04:51:04,720
And that's why like I I asked like my gen mates a lot of questions annoyingly like how they're feeling how they're doing

4052
04:51:05,520 --> 04:51:08,640
um, because I just want to make sure we're all on the same page because

4053
04:51:09,760 --> 04:51:12,880
uh, I just want to make sure that they're okay and

4054
04:51:14,480 --> 04:51:19,120
Like everybody's doing all right because I care about them. I care about how they're feeling how their mental health is

4055
04:51:20,160 --> 04:51:25,920
Um, you had your fill of trauma there. Yeah, exactly. Yeah being a commentator was

4056
04:51:27,440 --> 04:51:29,440
very stressful it was

4057
04:51:30,640 --> 04:51:34,240
I can't even explain to you how stressful it was just like the hate

4058
04:51:35,680 --> 04:51:37,680
um

4059
04:51:37,920 --> 04:51:41,040
The shit that I went through dealing with people

4060
04:51:42,080 --> 04:51:47,200
And it's funny because now I get to see them get karma now that are in the con that were in the commentary community

4061
04:51:47,280 --> 04:51:49,280
And it's it's very nice to see it

4062
04:51:51,360 --> 04:51:54,080
People who treated me like shit, um

4063
04:51:55,120 --> 04:51:58,080
Just for being a girl trying to do shit

4064
04:51:59,120 --> 04:52:00,400
uh

4065
04:52:00,400 --> 04:52:05,280
Should be doing wellness checks I do though like I'm like I did that at my job too before I left

4066
04:52:05,360 --> 04:52:07,680
Like I would check in with everybody and be like, hey, how are you doing?

4067
04:52:08,400 --> 04:52:12,320
Or if somebody seemed down I'm like tell me what's up and they're just like I'm fine. I'm like don't fucking lie to me

4068
04:52:14,080 --> 04:52:17,520
When you get bigger friends aren't just friends business relationship from what I've heard

4069
04:52:18,080 --> 04:52:20,080
But like I don't want that

4070
04:52:20,480 --> 04:52:22,480
if like I don't

4071
04:52:22,800 --> 04:52:26,000
I don't see collabs as like a business transaction

4072
04:52:26,240 --> 04:52:30,560
Unless they explicitly say this is a business transaction

4073
04:52:31,520 --> 04:52:34,720
um, I will probably only collab with people that

4074
04:52:35,360 --> 04:52:41,280
I like I am acquaintances with or I am on friendly terms or I do consider my friends or my best friends

4075
04:52:42,080 --> 04:52:43,200
um

4076
04:52:43,200 --> 04:52:47,440
Because like I want to hang out with you. I don't want anything from you

4077
04:52:48,320 --> 04:52:50,320
You know like I don't

4078
04:52:51,440 --> 04:52:53,440
I'm not doing this

4079
04:52:53,680 --> 04:52:57,520
For like monetary gain or popularity

4080
04:52:58,160 --> 04:52:59,360
like if

4081
04:52:59,360 --> 04:53:02,720
If a big ass vtuber was like, hey, you want to hang out

4082
04:53:03,600 --> 04:53:06,800
I'd mostly be fucking sides because this person wants to hang out with me

4083
04:53:06,880 --> 04:53:10,880
I don't care about their audience size like and same thing for me

4084
04:53:11,040 --> 04:53:19,360
Like I don't care if you have only five people watching you if I know you're cool. I watch your streams. I've you know like

4085
04:53:19,920 --> 04:53:24,560
I'll hang out with you. Like, you know, like I'm not gonna let that stand in the way

4086
04:53:24,640 --> 04:53:26,720
It isn't a business transaction to me

4087
04:53:26,720 --> 04:53:33,920
But again, I respect the people who do believe that like I'm not gonna be like oh my god. You're just a bitch. No, that's stupid

4088
04:53:34,320 --> 04:53:37,360
Everybody's entitled to like how they go about things. Um

4089
04:53:38,080 --> 04:53:43,360
If I were to to collab with like some girls from other agency and they're like

4090
04:53:43,920 --> 04:53:48,720
We're doing this because management told us to I'd be like ow, but okay

4091
04:53:50,320 --> 04:53:54,560
Let's then I'll try to have the best fun that I can. I don't that's not hasn't happened

4092
04:53:54,640 --> 04:53:59,200
So I don't think that's happened. It has not happened, but like it's just this is the hypothetical. Um

4093
04:54:00,800 --> 04:54:02,800
It's time to start streaming so

4094
04:54:04,640 --> 04:54:06,640
Um, am I fine? Um

4095
04:54:08,160 --> 04:54:10,000
I'm okay

4096
04:54:10,000 --> 04:54:14,320
Like again, I'm very honest with you guys. So like I've been in a little bit of pain for my fibro

4097
04:54:15,040 --> 04:54:17,040
I've had a couple headaches

4098
04:54:17,040 --> 04:54:18,400
um

4099
04:54:18,400 --> 04:54:20,400
It's been tough

4100
04:54:21,520 --> 04:54:24,240
Leaving my job. I don't really think it's settled in yet

4101
04:54:25,440 --> 04:54:29,680
because I've been there for almost six years that job meant so much to me and

4102
04:54:30,720 --> 04:54:34,240
Saying goodbye to people was hard. I'm surprised I didn't cry. Um

4103
04:54:36,080 --> 04:54:38,080
It I'm not good with change

4104
04:54:39,200 --> 04:54:41,440
and what worries me the most is

4105
04:54:42,560 --> 04:54:44,560
I tend to get really isolated

4106
04:54:45,520 --> 04:54:47,520
And so I was only going back to work

4107
04:54:47,920 --> 04:54:53,280
So that I wouldn't isolate myself and self isolate because I tend to do that when I'm I'm feeling down

4108
04:54:54,080 --> 04:54:55,360
um

4109
04:54:55,360 --> 04:54:56,560
but

4110
04:54:56,560 --> 04:55:00,480
I realized I was just feeling more tortured being there like I was

4111
04:55:01,280 --> 04:55:03,680
Really starting to resent the work I was doing

4112
04:55:05,680 --> 04:55:08,080
Um, but otherwise I'm fine like

4113
04:55:08,800 --> 04:55:15,040
Yeah, like I miss hanging out my parents. I need to go see them. I did hang out with them a couple days ago

4114
04:55:15,120 --> 04:55:20,720
But yeah, I need to hang out with my friends. I was supposed to hang out with Salem, but I didn't feel good. Um

4115
04:55:21,760 --> 04:55:23,520
I needed to sleep

4116
04:55:23,520 --> 04:55:25,520
I didn't go over her house

4117
04:55:26,720 --> 04:55:30,720
And then like so yeah, my goals are really just to leave my house

4118
04:55:31,280 --> 04:55:36,000
Because I tend I like I have been agoraphobic in the past where I didn't leave my house for six months

4119
04:55:36,480 --> 04:55:40,800
And that wasn't good for me. It really wasn't it's not good for anybody humans humans are

4120
04:55:43,040 --> 04:55:48,400
Humans are pack creatures. We need to talk to we're very we need to hang out with other people

4121
04:55:48,480 --> 04:55:49,920
And that's I like I

4122
04:55:49,920 --> 04:55:53,040
V-Jubing does give me energy because I can talk to you guys

4123
04:55:53,120 --> 04:55:55,920
But sometimes it's good to be face-to-face with people, you know

4124
04:55:58,000 --> 04:56:00,000
Um

4125
04:56:00,000 --> 04:56:02,000
I

4126
04:56:03,600 --> 04:56:07,680
Left my old job the first week was just a haze. It's up the best that we're had in previous eight years

4127
04:56:08,080 --> 04:56:10,480
Uh for me, I've haven't I've been sleeping like fucking shit

4128
04:56:11,280 --> 04:56:13,280
I've only been sleeping a couple hours

4129
04:56:13,520 --> 04:56:14,720
Uh

4130
04:56:14,720 --> 04:56:17,440
I can't stay asleep. I have really fucking weird dreams

4131
04:56:18,480 --> 04:56:22,480
Um, and I'm a very lucid dreamer so I remember every fucking dream I have. Um

4132
04:56:23,760 --> 04:56:27,920
Yeah, it's just I'm in a weird state. I'm just I just feel I just feel off

4133
04:56:28,880 --> 04:56:33,840
You know mercury's and Gatorade. No, I have no idea fucking retreat mercury's and retrograde. Um

4134
04:56:34,960 --> 04:56:39,120
It's weird dreams. No, not the not the fun dreams. I have had a couple though

4135
04:56:43,280 --> 04:56:45,440
Sorry, I'm stretching. Um

4136
04:56:47,760 --> 04:56:49,520
Let me make a day and just go outside

4137
04:56:49,520 --> 04:56:55,760
Yeah, and like that's why like it took so much energy from me just to fucking go to the grocery store today

4138
04:56:55,760 --> 04:57:01,840
That's why I know that like I need to be outside more. Um, also it was just really hard carrying everything up

4139
04:57:03,920 --> 04:57:06,800
I've it I it's hard to carry groceries

4140
04:57:07,920 --> 04:57:09,920
several flights

4141
04:57:09,920 --> 04:57:11,600
um

4142
04:57:11,600 --> 04:57:19,520
And then I had to drag my bed frame upstairs and that shit is probably like fucking 50 pounds and

4143
04:57:20,480 --> 04:57:25,760
And I swear every time I picked up picked it up. I was getting abs and really buff

4144
04:57:27,680 --> 04:57:31,200
And then yeah, yeah, and even in terms of like streaming stuff. Um

4145
04:57:33,040 --> 04:57:40,240
It's it's a new thing to have so many eyes on me. I'm used to having like a concurrent viewership of

4146
04:57:42,480 --> 04:57:44,480
Like 30 people

4147
04:57:44,560 --> 04:57:46,560
like max

4148
04:57:46,560 --> 04:57:48,560
50

4149
04:57:48,560 --> 04:57:52,240
I remember on my debut when I debuted as Rena with my little chibi model

4150
04:57:52,320 --> 04:57:58,480
I got rated with 200 people and I will chat myself and now I have a concurrent viewership of that. So it's very

4151
04:57:59,200 --> 04:58:02,400
It's very weird adjusting to it the amount of attention

4152
04:58:03,120 --> 04:58:04,480
that I get

4153
04:58:04,480 --> 04:58:06,480
um

4154
04:58:06,560 --> 04:58:10,560
I'm used to kind of passing under the radar and kind of being the support

4155
04:58:11,200 --> 04:58:13,200
in the shadows type

4156
04:58:13,840 --> 04:58:18,080
Like I I'm always there to like lend a helping hand but to be on the forefront

4157
04:58:18,720 --> 04:58:23,440
It's very interesting. It's a very new experience to me. I think I'm handling it. Okay

4158
04:58:24,080 --> 04:58:28,480
The first week was a little bit rocky. Um, you know, I said some stupid shit

4159
04:58:29,520 --> 04:58:33,200
Uh, oh my god, Rena. What the fuck Rena? Can you go lay in your bed? Please?

4160
04:58:33,760 --> 04:58:37,440
Okay. Well, never mind. Ow. We just stepped on my tit. Thanks. I love that

4161
04:58:38,240 --> 04:58:40,240
Thank you for stomping on my nipple

4162
04:58:41,760 --> 04:58:45,920
Um mirror about me here and I'm happy. Oh, that's nice. Mara is such a sweetheart

4163
04:58:46,480 --> 04:58:52,560
Me and my plus girls are such sweethearts. We have a collab with them next week spoiler. Um, can't wait

4164
04:58:53,440 --> 04:58:55,440
uh

4165
04:58:55,520 --> 04:58:58,400
But yeah, now you're the protagonist it's like

4166
04:58:59,840 --> 04:59:01,840
Literally though, it's like I'm like, oh

4167
04:59:02,160 --> 04:59:07,520
Joining the alert would never happen to me because that's like a dream come true and like that would be a fairy tale and

4168
04:59:07,920 --> 04:59:12,720
A lot of my problems would be solved if this happened and then it happened and doesn't feel real

4169
04:59:13,280 --> 04:59:15,280
still like it feels

4170
04:59:15,280 --> 04:59:17,280
Like I'm gonna dream and I'm gonna wake up and

4171
04:59:17,920 --> 04:59:20,560
Be disappointed that I'm still stuck at my fucking job

4172
04:59:22,560 --> 04:59:25,760
But then I pinch myself and I have to remember that I'm here

4173
04:59:26,640 --> 04:59:29,760
As we discover you may plus they're pretty cool. Yeah, they're so sweet

4174
04:59:30,240 --> 04:59:32,000
They deserve a lot more

4175
04:59:32,000 --> 04:59:36,240
Viewership than they do like they they do. They're so talented. They're so funny

4176
04:59:36,880 --> 04:59:38,880
Most is a fucking right

4177
04:59:38,960 --> 04:59:41,040
Um, should have been me not him

4178
04:59:42,000 --> 04:59:46,080
I love you. Oh fucking where'd you come from bitch? She's just coming out of nowhere

4179
04:59:47,840 --> 04:59:49,840
She's just like me you my plus mention

4180
04:59:51,760 --> 04:59:54,480
Um, I don't know you too and

4181
04:59:55,360 --> 05:00:00,000
I've been here. Oh, yeah, I we talked like 20 minutes ago. You just lurking. She's lurking

4182
05:00:00,640 --> 05:00:05,920
Um, yeah, the most uh, the most of sliding in my dm. She's like, hey, you want to be friends and I'm like, yeah, bitch

4183
05:00:06,960 --> 05:00:08,960
I love that shit. That's my favorite

4184
05:00:09,280 --> 05:00:10,640
um

4185
05:00:10,640 --> 05:00:12,160
She's cool as hell

4186
05:00:12,160 --> 05:00:14,160
Please don't wake up. We'll stop existing

4187
05:00:16,240 --> 05:00:18,960
Hey, most of her bad mouth. Thank you. Um

4188
05:00:20,000 --> 05:00:22,880
Yeah, bad mouth thing about how much of a bad bitch you are

4189
05:00:23,600 --> 05:00:26,640
Uh, we all the girls are sweet. Um

4190
05:00:30,240 --> 05:00:35,120
Yeah, it's just it's and then also like dealing with hate has been interesting

4191
05:00:35,920 --> 05:00:37,920
um as a vtuber

4192
05:00:38,480 --> 05:00:46,960
It is a lot more manageable because as a commentator, I was like hit every day with that shit. So it was pretty desensitized

4193
05:00:48,400 --> 05:00:50,400
um, and I think

4194
05:00:51,040 --> 05:00:53,040
I've learned over time

4195
05:00:53,920 --> 05:00:55,920
to handle hate better

4196
05:00:56,080 --> 05:00:57,600
um

4197
05:00:57,600 --> 05:01:03,680
But then sometimes I'm like, I do get baited and I respond to trolls like I'll admit that I can be stupid like that sometimes

4198
05:01:04,560 --> 05:01:11,520
Um, mostly because I'm trying to be out of the goodness of my heart answer like an on what I think is an honest question when it isn't

4199
05:01:12,320 --> 05:01:13,360
um

4200
05:01:13,360 --> 05:01:14,560
or

4201
05:01:14,560 --> 05:01:16,560
or a

4202
05:01:16,560 --> 05:01:18,560
Yeah, or um

4203
05:01:18,560 --> 05:01:21,040
respond to something that I think is genuine, but

4204
05:01:22,320 --> 05:01:26,240
A genuine critique, but then I'm like, oh wait, no, it's not my back is cheap

4205
05:01:28,000 --> 05:01:30,000
um

4206
05:01:31,040 --> 05:01:33,040
Yeah, I just

4207
05:01:34,400 --> 05:01:36,000
Hmm

4208
05:01:36,000 --> 05:01:39,680
Like I'm learning not like when I don't like something I don't need to acknowledge it

4209
05:01:41,120 --> 05:01:46,400
When something bothers me don't want to just block and move on. That's it's really interesting

4210
05:01:53,600 --> 05:01:55,840
We're stroding your chat. That's pretty good

4211
05:01:56,720 --> 05:02:03,280
Yeah, don't feed the trolls. Yeah, and it's like because I'm like I'm a little fucking brat and bitch sometimes sometimes I'll bait the trolls

4212
05:02:03,280 --> 05:02:05,280
I've done that before and I'm like

4213
05:02:05,600 --> 05:02:09,840
Um, what I did that before is Rina and I'm like, oh fuck should have done that

4214
05:02:11,360 --> 05:02:16,640
But you live you learn and you live whatever the fuck you make mistakes that you fucking learned from them

4215
05:02:17,280 --> 05:02:19,120
um

4216
05:02:19,120 --> 05:02:21,120
and that's what

4217
05:02:21,680 --> 05:02:23,680
I think like

4218
05:02:24,480 --> 05:02:29,760
What we do as a company it's like we'll make like a small mistake and then we'll adjust accordingly

4219
05:02:30,240 --> 05:02:32,240
um

4220
05:02:33,120 --> 05:02:35,120
And we haven't made a lot of those

4221
05:02:36,880 --> 05:02:38,480
But

4222
05:02:38,480 --> 05:02:41,600
I can't wait to see how we'll grow. I think we have a

4223
05:02:42,880 --> 05:02:49,520
We'll be learning a lot at least as a company because I've never worked in a group as a company before like an agency

4224
05:02:50,000 --> 05:02:51,120
um

4225
05:02:51,120 --> 05:02:58,640
And of course I've worked in many groups like and I've managed teams when I was in the training when I was in my job

4226
05:02:59,120 --> 05:03:00,320
um

4227
05:03:00,320 --> 05:03:02,320
So it's it's interesting to kind of

4228
05:03:03,440 --> 05:03:06,640
I really like just being able to support scrawny in her dream

4229
05:03:07,440 --> 05:03:07,920
um

4230
05:03:07,920 --> 05:03:14,480
And also be able to make my own content and like just like her giving me the green light on things and projects that I want

4231
05:03:14,480 --> 05:03:18,400
To do has been really cool. Um, I don't know if any of the girls have anything planned

4232
05:03:18,960 --> 05:03:23,600
But like I would support them if they did something and they asked me to be a part of it or they just wanted support

4233
05:03:24,480 --> 05:03:27,840
So it's it's it's nice. It's it is really nice

4234
05:03:29,600 --> 05:03:33,680
I'm learning to let things go. Yeah, like I don't hold on to things

4235
05:03:34,800 --> 05:03:37,920
I realize uh, I think that's a skill I have

4236
05:03:39,040 --> 05:03:41,040
I I don't hold grudges

4237
05:03:41,040 --> 05:03:43,040
um

4238
05:03:43,360 --> 05:03:46,800
Yeah, pretty optimistic about people there. Yeah, me too

4239
05:03:47,680 --> 05:03:49,680
scrawny stream is my dream exactly

4240
05:03:50,720 --> 05:03:52,720
exactly

4241
05:03:52,800 --> 05:03:55,520
I really think viewers gonna be big one day. Yeah

4242
05:03:56,400 --> 05:03:58,400
I can't wait till we like

4243
05:03:59,520 --> 05:04:02,960
Like I want to be the V show joe for whores. Like I want to be like

4244
05:04:05,200 --> 05:04:07,200
I want to just be able to like nepo

4245
05:04:07,760 --> 05:04:11,440
Scout fucking huge lude tubers and be like come be a whore with us

4246
05:04:14,000 --> 05:04:16,000
Be fucking hilarious

4247
05:04:16,800 --> 05:04:22,160
Um, but yeah, like I know scrawny has a lot planned for us deals sponsorships

4248
05:04:22,160 --> 05:04:26,320
She's she literally wants the best for us and I couldn't ask for a better mom

4249
05:04:27,280 --> 05:04:29,280
A better vtuber mom

4250
05:04:29,440 --> 05:04:30,640
uh

4251
05:04:30,640 --> 05:04:34,400
The pop-up and pop cherries. Oh god, but um

4252
05:04:35,440 --> 05:04:37,040
Yeah, it's just

4253
05:04:37,040 --> 05:04:39,440
It's really cool. I'm very thankful

4254
05:04:40,240 --> 05:04:42,240
It's really nice hanging out with you guys

4255
05:04:42,880 --> 05:04:45,840
Too small be a lure be the whole live of vtuber lude tubers

4256
05:04:46,480 --> 05:04:50,320
I don't want that though. Like I don't want to be whole live of lude tubers

4257
05:04:52,240 --> 05:04:54,240
Um

4258
05:04:54,320 --> 05:04:56,320
Yeah

4259
05:04:56,560 --> 05:04:59,760
I'm trying to throw cops caught until vk. That'd be cool

4260
05:05:02,000 --> 05:05:04,640
Be like it was her she was queen in my lure

4261
05:05:06,240 --> 05:05:08,000
Um

4262
05:05:08,000 --> 05:05:11,600
I don't want to be that big because I was thinking about it because I was just like, okay

4263
05:05:13,040 --> 05:05:15,040
Like what if

4264
05:05:15,680 --> 05:05:17,680
um

4265
05:05:19,680 --> 05:05:23,840
And don't take this the wrong way this hypothetical that I thought of it was only because

4266
05:05:24,320 --> 05:05:26,080
the girl the

4267
05:05:26,080 --> 05:05:27,280
the

4268
05:05:27,280 --> 05:05:32,320
Debuts popped up that I thought of this and not in a negative way. Just like how would I handle it?

4269
05:05:32,560 --> 05:05:34,560
I'm like, okay. Let's say

4270
05:05:34,560 --> 05:05:36,560
in like four years

4271
05:05:37,680 --> 05:05:39,680
For three years velar

4272
05:05:39,760 --> 05:05:41,760
um

4273
05:05:42,000 --> 05:05:44,000
Ended operations

4274
05:05:44,000 --> 05:05:45,440
I'm like

4275
05:05:45,440 --> 05:05:47,440
Would I try to get in the hall alive? No

4276
05:05:48,880 --> 05:05:50,880
One because the content I make

4277
05:05:51,360 --> 05:05:53,360
two because of all the eyes on me

4278
05:05:54,080 --> 05:05:55,120
uh

4279
05:05:55,120 --> 05:05:56,640
three

4280
05:05:56,640 --> 05:05:59,280
I don't think I'm entertaining enough and like I don't

4281
05:06:00,560 --> 05:06:06,400
I don't know. I just like being small. I just like I that's why I hope velar lasts forever because I just want it

4282
05:06:08,320 --> 05:06:11,920
I don't know how to explain it, but I hope you guys like understand what I'm saying. It wasn't it's not

4283
05:06:18,720 --> 05:06:20,720
I don't care about the money

4284
05:06:21,360 --> 05:06:25,200
Either that's not a motivation. It's nice. It's an added perk

4285
05:06:26,000 --> 05:06:27,760
like

4286
05:06:27,760 --> 05:06:29,280
but

4287
05:06:29,280 --> 05:06:30,880
I

4288
05:06:30,880 --> 05:06:32,160
For me

4289
05:06:32,160 --> 05:06:37,360
Being a streamer was my passion into what makes brings me joy and makes me happy if I and then I was

4290
05:06:38,160 --> 05:06:41,200
So fucking miserable when I wasn't streaming for the last few years

4291
05:06:41,840 --> 05:06:46,880
It was so fucking shitty. I realized how much I missed it when I when I was rena

4292
05:06:47,200 --> 05:06:47,920
um

4293
05:06:47,920 --> 05:06:49,360
when I became

4294
05:06:49,360 --> 05:06:54,880
When I did my first stream as rena, I realized how much I missed it and then when I had to be

4295
05:06:55,840 --> 05:06:58,320
Quiet and be underground for a couple of months

4296
05:06:59,040 --> 05:07:02,000
Uh while I was transforming into my ultimate form shiwi

4297
05:07:02,320 --> 05:07:08,640
I was literally dying inside because I missed talking to my community. I missed talking to people. I missed making stuff

4298
05:07:09,280 --> 05:07:14,720
Because uh, like I had so many plans and I'm like, oh my god. Like I just wanted to get shit done. Um

4299
05:07:15,600 --> 05:07:21,600
It was a core profile. No, no, no. I was never in an agency before this. Uh, I was indy. I was a twitch indy

4300
05:07:22,400 --> 05:07:24,400
Very small twitch indy

4301
05:07:24,720 --> 05:07:26,720
um

4302
05:07:27,120 --> 05:07:31,120
I do and I already said this stream I caught until VA collab would go hard. Yes, it would

4303
05:07:31,120 --> 05:07:33,360
I don't know if she would want to talk to me though

4304
05:07:34,800 --> 05:07:36,800
Again, I'm so small

4305
05:07:36,800 --> 05:07:40,240
Oh, I'm gonna tell you when you're for five hours. Has it been five hours or shit?

4306
05:07:41,200 --> 05:07:44,000
I get it. We could be more comfy this way and it gives you flexibility. Yeah

4307
05:07:44,640 --> 05:07:48,080
The dichotomy between wanting success and wanting a nice small community. Yeah

4308
05:07:48,800 --> 05:07:50,800
Like I could always get a job

4309
05:07:50,800 --> 05:07:52,480
like

4310
05:07:52,480 --> 05:07:58,400
Worst comes to worst. I could get a job if like I wasn't making enough streaming and like that's fine

4311
05:07:58,480 --> 05:08:01,440
I'm up as long as I get to stream. That's all I care about

4312
05:08:02,000 --> 05:08:06,480
She loves us. I do. I'll say it. I love you guys. I love streaming

4313
05:08:07,600 --> 05:08:08,880
Fuck you

4314
05:08:08,880 --> 05:08:10,160
Bitch

4315
05:08:10,160 --> 05:08:12,160
Don't let it get to your head

4316
05:08:13,360 --> 05:08:17,520
Contale would simp for you on god. I highly doubt that I'd be simping for her

4317
05:08:19,920 --> 05:08:27,440
Overgrowth with the selfish part of me hopes. Oh you guys fucking talk her so fast. Um, it's the most like this intimate vibes are immaculate

4318
05:08:27,440 --> 05:08:28,240
Yeah

4319
05:08:28,240 --> 05:08:31,680
And like yeah, that's why like I've seen a lot of people have that same sentiment

4320
05:08:32,080 --> 05:08:38,160
Like they want us to be successful, but they want you want to get keep us a little and so I totally understand that

4321
05:08:39,840 --> 05:08:42,320
Um, but then

4322
05:08:43,360 --> 05:08:49,760
Then you think and I know you guys think this like why would I want to stop somebody else from experiencing what I'm experiencing right now?

4323
05:08:50,320 --> 05:08:53,360
What if she helps somebody or what if

4324
05:08:54,080 --> 05:08:55,280
like

4325
05:08:55,280 --> 05:09:00,480
She brings a smile to somebody having a bad day. That's what I want you to remember when you you think like that

4326
05:09:01,120 --> 05:09:02,480
um

4327
05:09:02,480 --> 05:09:06,560
Like what if we bring so much change to the vtuber community then another

4328
05:09:07,520 --> 05:09:11,120
Agency pops up that does similar content to ours and you find you're

4329
05:09:11,920 --> 05:09:19,360
The fucking love of your life in comey in comeyoshi and that one or like what if like because so many so many things can happen

4330
05:09:19,440 --> 05:09:21,280
like you can branch and

4331
05:09:21,280 --> 05:09:22,800
you know

4332
05:09:22,800 --> 05:09:23,920
all that

4333
05:09:23,920 --> 05:09:25,920
Still keeping my ego in check. Don't worry

4334
05:09:26,400 --> 05:09:28,880
Uh intimate chats of the soul. So yeah

4335
05:09:29,680 --> 05:09:35,600
I like about vtuber is the chat interaction, which is why I like indie so much. Yeah, I loved I liked I like streaming

4336
05:09:36,320 --> 05:09:43,840
Because I love doing chat interaction. That's why I'm frustrated with youtube because it's it's hard to do a lot of chat interaction

4337
05:09:43,840 --> 05:09:45,840
That's my like channel points on twitch

4338
05:09:46,560 --> 05:09:47,840
um

4339
05:09:47,840 --> 05:09:49,840
Have a plan make it easy

4340
05:09:50,400 --> 05:09:52,400
on her to destroy a thing

4341
05:09:52,400 --> 05:09:53,440
yeah

4342
05:09:53,440 --> 05:09:55,440
I did like um

4343
05:09:55,440 --> 05:09:57,440
I want to be part of honey kins

4344
05:09:58,000 --> 05:10:03,840
Like murder mystery thing that she has going she needs like 15 vtubers for it. So I was like, please please

4345
05:10:04,720 --> 05:10:06,720
um

4346
05:10:07,440 --> 05:10:13,520
Yeah, I like I'm afraid to ask people to hang out because I don't want to seem like I'm clout chasing because I just

4347
05:10:14,720 --> 05:10:18,480
It's just that now that I'm an agency vtuber with a brand

4348
05:10:18,960 --> 05:10:22,160
People are more likely to say yes because if I was a fucking indie

4349
05:10:22,160 --> 05:10:23,840
No one would say yes to hanging out with me

4350
05:10:23,840 --> 05:10:27,760
I don't want to hang out because I want popularity. I just want to hang out because I think your content's cool

4351
05:10:28,560 --> 05:10:36,320
So I'm like, oh if I slide into a k like so and so's dms. Are they gonna think I'm a clout chasing leechy bitch?

4352
05:10:36,400 --> 05:10:38,080
I'm like, I hope not

4353
05:10:38,080 --> 05:10:40,560
I just want to hang out with you because I think you you and your content is cool

4354
05:10:42,160 --> 05:10:44,160
Felt yeah

4355
05:10:44,560 --> 05:10:46,400
um

4356
05:10:46,400 --> 05:10:48,400
I don't yeah, I just don't want

4357
05:10:49,280 --> 05:10:54,000
I want to make connections, but it's it's it's it that's what holds me back

4358
05:10:54,800 --> 05:11:00,880
Um, and then when I feel a little bit stupid when like someone doesn't respond and I know they've seen it

4359
05:11:01,600 --> 05:11:04,640
But I'm like, hey, it's it is what it is. Like I can't

4360
05:11:05,680 --> 05:11:11,600
Change how they feel if like they're like, oh, I don't like her. She's kind of like and she's fucking

4361
05:11:12,960 --> 05:11:18,800
Because I know like another thing people are like, um, some people are put off about I've heard somebody say that

4362
05:11:19,040 --> 05:11:19,840
um

4363
05:11:19,920 --> 05:11:22,400
My model makes them uncomfortable, which makes me kind of sad

4364
05:11:22,800 --> 05:11:27,600
But I understand because like if you're not into bdsm and I have a fucking ball gag as a choker and

4365
05:11:28,160 --> 05:11:31,280
Uh shabari ropes and my boobs are a fucking huge, you know

4366
05:11:31,840 --> 05:11:33,600
um

4367
05:11:33,600 --> 05:11:39,600
And some people don't like a very sexualized. Why am I so small because I'm because I'm fucking

4368
05:11:44,480 --> 05:11:46,480
Because I'm leaning back

4369
05:11:50,320 --> 05:11:52,960
Here I'll lean I'll lean nice and close to you. I'm so short

4370
05:11:54,240 --> 05:11:57,920
I'm like trying to do this and lean but also like move myself up

4371
05:11:59,520 --> 05:12:03,040
So I can like yeah, okay, that's a little bit better. Um

4372
05:12:05,360 --> 05:12:07,360
Oh, this is scared of the drills

4373
05:12:07,760 --> 05:12:13,840
Reach out just bring a plant. Yeah here with the um big bobs scare you. Oh, well stay away from big bobs

4374
05:12:14,560 --> 05:12:16,560
so short

4375
05:12:17,040 --> 05:12:21,920
Yeah, I think my model is amazing too. Like when I saw it the first time I was like my mouth fucking dropped

4376
05:12:22,320 --> 05:12:27,520
I wish I was on a video call with strawnee because then she would have been laughing at me. Um,

4377
05:12:28,080 --> 05:12:30,080
What do you mean that is inside?

4378
05:12:32,800 --> 05:12:36,880
I'm scared you were personalities. I don't know maybe that's why that's why I'm like

4379
05:12:37,360 --> 05:12:40,880
I debate so often if I should really reel myself in

4380
05:12:41,680 --> 05:12:43,680
Because I don't want to put people off

4381
05:12:44,400 --> 05:12:46,000
Um

4382
05:12:46,000 --> 05:12:51,200
These people just want to hang out through the ones to be valid. Yeah, that's why I fucking love that you may plus girls so much

4383
05:12:51,200 --> 05:12:53,200
Because they gave us a chance, you know

4384
05:12:53,600 --> 05:12:55,200
They're like, yeah

4385
05:12:55,200 --> 05:13:01,760
Um, and I know like sponsored watch alongs don't uh mean anything when it comes to like lasting relationships in the v2

4386
05:13:01,760 --> 05:13:06,400
Bing community, but we were turned down by a lot of agencies. Um for that

4387
05:13:06,880 --> 05:13:11,360
And I can say that strawnee's already fucking talked about it. Um, but you may plus was like yeah

4388
05:13:11,840 --> 05:13:14,000
And like it was really fucking cool of them to accept

4389
05:13:14,720 --> 05:13:17,840
Because we're nobody's yeah, we have a little bit of pull because

4390
05:13:18,720 --> 05:13:21,200
of just like the content we make but

4391
05:13:22,400 --> 05:13:25,920
We're still a brand risk being not safe for work. That's why

4392
05:13:31,760 --> 05:13:38,640
Feel silly when there's so many skimpy jiggly models of the gags curious people. Yeah, yeah, you know, I think

4393
05:13:39,360 --> 05:13:40,400
I

4394
05:13:40,400 --> 05:13:42,400
Yeah, I I feel like

4395
05:13:42,800 --> 05:13:44,800
I I think

4396
05:13:44,960 --> 05:13:49,440
In like a couple months will be a little bit more settled in. We love you girls. We love you too

4397
05:13:50,160 --> 05:13:52,480
Um before mariah coming in college too

4398
05:13:53,200 --> 05:13:59,920
Honestly, yeah, like I was chatting in rem's chat. Um, I've been like making funny jokes with uh,

4399
05:14:00,720 --> 05:14:02,720
nova

4400
05:14:03,200 --> 05:14:10,560
So like I'm like they're the v4 mariah girls are so fucking cool to me to be honest, uh, their debuts

4401
05:14:11,360 --> 05:14:16,720
Honestly blew me out of the fucking water like all like all their debuts so far and before mariah

4402
05:14:17,360 --> 05:14:19,360
Um have blew me out of the water

4403
05:14:19,360 --> 05:14:23,040
Um, I remember watching serena's the first time when they actually made the company

4404
05:14:23,520 --> 05:14:26,320
Her singing voice was amazing. I

4405
05:14:26,320 --> 05:14:27,440
I

4406
05:14:27,440 --> 05:14:34,320
Was so amazed by it and then just the newer girls their debuts are so creative

4407
05:14:34,800 --> 05:14:37,760
They're such a creative group. Um, they're such a such a nice

4408
05:14:38,640 --> 05:14:39,920
bunch of people

4409
05:14:39,920 --> 05:14:40,880
um

4410
05:14:40,880 --> 05:14:46,800
And the mythos girls are also you have fucking facade and rated me the other day and I was like, oh shit, okay

4411
05:14:47,680 --> 05:14:48,960
That's cool

4412
05:14:48,960 --> 05:14:50,080
and that

4413
05:14:50,080 --> 05:14:56,160
And that like and I always see like as a raid a raid as like a little olive branch like hey, please like

4414
05:14:56,480 --> 05:14:58,480
I like you. I want to send my

4415
05:14:59,280 --> 05:15:02,000
My viewers to you and I always appreciate that

4416
05:15:02,640 --> 05:15:05,600
Um, I miss abby kiddo. Oh, yeah same she

4417
05:15:07,040 --> 05:15:10,720
It's a real bummer, but I'm proud of her. Um, because she

4418
05:15:11,280 --> 05:15:17,920
Got an opportunity, but she was honestly doing things that a lot of people did not do in the community in terms of skits

4419
05:15:18,640 --> 05:15:22,480
Um, and just her format and I thought that was very unique about her

4420
05:15:23,040 --> 05:15:25,760
Uh, and then yeah her and biscotti

4421
05:15:26,240 --> 05:15:27,680
um

4422
05:15:27,680 --> 05:15:31,200
Very talented people, but you know when life affords you

4423
05:15:32,160 --> 05:15:37,280
Amazing opportunities. You gotta you gotta get them and it's amazing that brave group allows them to do so

4424
05:15:37,760 --> 05:15:39,520
so

4425
05:15:39,520 --> 05:15:44,720
The scientist debut was insanely. You're not to the yes. Like I was like, what the fuck is this? This is crazy

4426
05:15:45,280 --> 05:15:49,440
Um, yeah, raids raids are nice. The the redirects are cool

4427
05:15:50,720 --> 05:15:53,680
I'm sorry with costume for the lore moment. Remind me of the moment from the

4428
05:15:55,120 --> 05:16:03,200
Um, yeah, I was laughing at uh, alias is v2 apology thing. I was dying at that actually that was really funny. Um

4429
05:16:05,440 --> 05:16:08,640
Came in from that raid. Oh, okay. That's funny. That's cool

4430
05:16:09,600 --> 05:16:15,840
Sounds like she found a little path into comedy. Yeah, I mean, I I generally I'm wondering what she got into like it

4431
05:16:16,640 --> 05:16:19,120
It for her to leave, but you know

4432
05:16:19,760 --> 05:16:21,280
It's very interesting

4433
05:16:21,280 --> 05:16:28,240
I mean it was and also like she was so great to her portuguese fan base her brazilian fan base. I really think

4434
05:16:29,040 --> 05:16:31,840
um, she really paved the way for um

4435
05:16:34,000 --> 05:16:36,000
Brazilian vtubers

4436
05:16:36,560 --> 05:16:38,560
Oh

4437
05:16:41,440 --> 05:16:45,680
Yeah, I hope I hope yeah, I hope the girls are okay. Um in her leaving

4438
05:16:46,640 --> 05:16:53,120
And I just yeah, I just wonder what will be next for a lot of the smaller agencies in the community

4439
05:16:53,920 --> 05:16:55,680
um

4440
05:16:55,680 --> 05:16:57,040
like

4441
05:16:57,040 --> 05:16:59,440
Yeah, pixeling just debuted around the same time as us

4442
05:17:00,400 --> 05:17:02,400
um

4443
05:17:03,120 --> 05:17:09,520
What was it isn't like idle doing another gen or um, or was that or did I see that in a dream?

4444
05:17:10,080 --> 05:17:12,080
I can't remember. Um

4445
05:17:13,120 --> 05:17:17,200
I know they did like uh idle. Yes, which was really fucking cool

4446
05:17:19,680 --> 05:17:23,200
I'm brazilian. That was so cool. Yeah, like she she always

4447
05:17:23,840 --> 05:17:28,720
I always appreciated that she always did her her tweets in english and in portuguese

4448
05:17:29,440 --> 05:17:31,440
I'll on core. Yeah

4449
05:17:31,760 --> 05:17:37,040
Yeah, no not on core. Uh, the gen three. Yes the gen three. Okay. I'm not I'm not going insane

4450
05:17:37,760 --> 05:17:39,920
Uh, so I I look forward to their debuts, too

4451
05:17:41,280 --> 05:17:43,280
I'll be a little shiblit

4452
05:17:44,000 --> 05:17:46,240
Shiblit. I like that. I should have called you my shiblits

4453
05:17:47,520 --> 05:17:49,520
Sounds like shitlits

4454
05:17:49,680 --> 05:17:52,640
Sounds like cheek lays cheeklets cheek lays

4455
05:17:53,840 --> 05:17:57,760
You may know one day she has a recognizable voice. Oh, you know, she definitely does

4456
05:17:58,960 --> 05:18:00,480
um

4457
05:18:00,480 --> 05:18:01,760
She fucking

4458
05:18:01,760 --> 05:18:04,160
Imagine she shows up in fucking holo. Holy

4459
05:18:06,400 --> 05:18:10,240
That's like the chaser. I would lose my fucking mind. Um

4460
05:18:11,840 --> 05:18:13,840
Same brain so yeah

4461
05:18:13,840 --> 05:18:16,560
Me and mercy say to share the same brain cells so often

4462
05:18:17,120 --> 05:18:20,320
Like I think it's like so many times we've like gone to

4463
05:18:20,960 --> 05:18:25,120
Like message each other and we're like, oh shit wait and because like I was about to talk to you

4464
05:18:25,360 --> 05:18:28,400
And then like we'll talk about like the same thing at the same time

4465
05:18:28,960 --> 05:18:31,760
In the our journal part of the discord and we're just like

4466
05:18:36,480 --> 05:18:41,360
People with theorizing about holo and it happens. It'll be so reactive like live tweeting. Yeah

4467
05:18:43,680 --> 05:18:50,880
Yeah, um, I kind of feel like with one of them being a really former high profile

4468
05:18:51,920 --> 05:18:53,040
um

4469
05:18:53,120 --> 05:18:55,120
Artist in indie I feel like

4470
05:18:56,800 --> 05:18:58,800
That this

4471
05:18:59,200 --> 05:19:04,880
Honestly, this has started happening a couple months ago though. Everybody's kind of been talking about pls

4472
05:19:05,520 --> 05:19:06,880
um

4473
05:19:06,880 --> 05:19:10,640
I feel like going forward people be able to talk more freely about them

4474
05:19:11,280 --> 05:19:14,080
Because those connections just don't go away, you know

4475
05:19:15,840 --> 05:19:19,760
Uh, if when you're like very well known people recognize your voice

4476
05:19:20,480 --> 05:19:23,360
You have a lot of friends. It's yeah, it's hard to be like

4477
05:19:24,480 --> 05:19:29,200
Of course like n da's it gives this and you can only you can share so much

4478
05:19:29,360 --> 05:19:32,800
Oh, you can only share so much and that's fine, but I feel like

4479
05:19:34,960 --> 05:19:36,320
That

4480
05:19:36,320 --> 05:19:40,560
That will change and I don't think that's because of us. That's it's already been the in the

4481
05:19:41,360 --> 05:19:44,720
In the works and the v2 being community that taboo kind of

4482
05:19:45,440 --> 05:19:50,880
Not being a thing anymore, but I think like we're one of the first groups to normalize it

4483
05:19:51,680 --> 05:19:53,180
Which is cool

4484
05:19:53,180 --> 05:19:56,880
PLs often have the same save some corporates. Yeah, exactly. Like I know

4485
05:19:57,680 --> 05:20:01,760
Usually like people in the new idol wave are probably gonna be bill

4486
05:20:01,760 --> 05:20:04,960
I already know that we have recently graduated vice versa

4487
05:20:05,840 --> 05:20:08,960
Because you know v2 being community tends to recycle their

4488
05:20:09,600 --> 05:20:12,880
Fucking talents. Um, I think v for morai

4489
05:20:13,760 --> 05:20:18,320
Is one of the more recent ones where there are people that I don't know. I didn't know about before

4490
05:20:20,480 --> 05:20:26,400
Or some but and I'm very thankful for strongy giving us a chance because I know I was a nobody

4491
05:20:27,200 --> 05:20:29,200
Zura was very small

4492
05:20:29,520 --> 05:20:31,520
I see was very small

4493
05:20:32,320 --> 05:20:33,840
uh, so

4494
05:20:33,920 --> 05:20:41,040
And mercy was like a little like medium-sized and um, I mean was larger, but uh, like she

4495
05:20:42,560 --> 05:20:48,880
Gave us a chance and when she did see big names applying. So I appreciated that a bunch

4496
05:20:49,760 --> 05:20:54,000
Um, because I I never thought I was going to break into the industry because

4497
05:20:54,720 --> 05:20:56,720
People were kind of just going through the same

4498
05:20:57,520 --> 05:21:03,120
You know jump and jive of getting the same talents over and over if someone graduates just moves to another company

4499
05:21:04,320 --> 05:21:06,320
And I'm like am I ever

4500
05:21:06,400 --> 05:21:09,600
What is what is going to set me apart?

4501
05:21:10,400 --> 05:21:15,120
And let get me in especially if there's nepotism people just hire their friends. So

4502
05:21:15,840 --> 05:21:17,840
It was it was very I

4503
05:21:17,840 --> 05:21:22,720
After if I didn't get into velar, I probably wasn't gonna apply to any more companies anymore

4504
05:21:23,680 --> 05:21:27,440
Um, I was probably just gonna focus on being indie. So I'm very happy that I'm here

4505
05:21:28,160 --> 05:21:32,960
Mm-hmm cynical. Yeah, but

4506
05:21:36,400 --> 05:21:39,600
Be a bit cynical, but it's like when you see a pattern

4507
05:21:41,360 --> 05:21:44,880
And it's it becomes a habit like what else can you think, you know

4508
05:21:45,680 --> 05:21:48,560
Not that I like fault the people in the industry for that

4509
05:21:48,960 --> 05:21:56,880
It's better to you like you know what you're investing in and you know how somebody acts and they already have a good track record in history

4510
05:21:57,120 --> 05:22:01,200
Why would in experience? Why would you not hire them? Like that's it's to be a stupid

4511
05:22:01,680 --> 05:22:06,160
Businesses and not to why would I take a risk on some random nobody from twitch?

4512
05:22:07,040 --> 05:22:08,000
um

4513
05:22:08,000 --> 05:22:10,800
That doesn't have a lot of content creation under the belt

4514
05:22:11,280 --> 05:22:11,920
um

4515
05:22:11,920 --> 05:22:15,520
Where someone who's an agency for two years recently left like I

4516
05:22:16,080 --> 05:22:19,040
It's an it's a no-brainer. So I don't I don't blame it at all

4517
05:22:19,440 --> 05:22:24,080
But then there's people like strani who want to you know develop talent

4518
05:22:25,040 --> 05:22:31,040
And take chance and she had faith in us and I appreciate her immensely for that immensely

4519
05:22:32,480 --> 05:22:35,920
Did Amy give a lot of I don't know you'd have to ask her that

4520
05:22:39,120 --> 05:22:41,520
Yeah, you'd have to ask her that I I don't know and I

4521
05:22:44,000 --> 05:22:45,760
um

4522
05:22:45,760 --> 05:22:50,400
Yeah, I'll be honest with you. I don't know a lot of the other girls motivations for applying

4523
05:22:51,360 --> 05:22:52,720
um

4524
05:22:52,720 --> 05:22:55,040
My motivation again was I wanted

4525
05:22:57,040 --> 05:22:59,920
It wasn't really for me. I just wanted to support

4526
05:23:00,880 --> 05:23:05,280
Strani and I know I can be a good entertainer and yapper, you know, um

4527
05:23:06,320 --> 05:23:07,600
And

4528
05:23:07,600 --> 05:23:09,520
Yeah, I just I just wanted to support her

4529
05:23:09,520 --> 05:23:15,200
I wanted to make change in the community and I saw her as a force for change and I wanted to support support that

4530
05:23:15,760 --> 05:23:20,400
Um as for the other girl. Yeah, I have no idea what their motivations were for joining

4531
05:23:21,120 --> 05:23:27,440
Maybe they wanted to do more adult content. Maybe they wanted to grow their audience. Maybe they wanted a brand

4532
05:23:28,160 --> 05:23:34,160
Um, maybe they wanted more support. I think yeah, I feel like for some of them. It's probably like support

4533
05:23:34,720 --> 05:23:36,880
um for projects and stuff so

4534
05:23:40,960 --> 05:23:45,680
Glad you're here since detail kind of directed me to be alert. Yeah, it's like a yes detail has been really sweet

4535
05:23:45,680 --> 05:23:49,040
She's given us a bunch of shout outs that collab with her was really cool

4536
05:23:49,920 --> 05:23:51,920
um

4537
05:23:53,760 --> 05:23:58,160
I think I want to be a part of a group that too. Um, I feel I think

4538
05:23:59,920 --> 05:24:00,800
I'm

4539
05:24:00,800 --> 05:24:05,360
I forget somebody one of the girls did mention that like I just wanted to be a part of a group

4540
05:24:06,160 --> 05:24:10,560
And I can't remember who it was, but I know that was definitely a part of somebody's motivation

4541
05:24:11,440 --> 05:24:13,440
um

4542
05:24:13,920 --> 05:24:15,520
Amy, yeah

4543
05:24:15,520 --> 05:24:22,000
She is but like let's not talk about her stuff. Um, just because it's not my place to speak on it

4544
05:24:22,720 --> 05:24:28,640
Um, I'll talk about mine, but I won't talk about the other girls because it's not my place. It's not it's

4545
05:24:29,040 --> 05:24:31,040
I don't have any right to talk about it

4546
05:24:31,520 --> 05:24:34,800
Uh, scrawny knows how to pick them. It seems she does so she has an eye

4547
05:24:35,520 --> 05:24:37,520
for for talent

4548
05:24:37,760 --> 05:24:39,440
Um, yeah

4549
05:24:39,440 --> 05:24:43,440
She beats literally sorrow. I think more important than the size of the proof

4550
05:24:43,440 --> 05:24:47,600
There's a work ethic showing that you the library consistent work is reassuring that it lasts

4551
05:24:48,160 --> 05:24:54,320
Yeah, that's why scrawny was a little bit confused because she's like, how do you know so much and do so much?

4552
05:24:54,480 --> 05:24:57,920
But you've only been around for six months and then I explained to her in my interview

4553
05:24:58,400 --> 05:25:04,480
That I technically was around longer than that and I had more content creation on my belt. I just applied with this

4554
05:25:05,200 --> 05:25:07,200
version of myself, um

4555
05:25:08,160 --> 05:25:11,040
Although again the version before

4556
05:25:11,760 --> 05:25:18,480
My past life was just me and the flesh. So there's no point doesn't make sense to apply as my flesh version

4557
05:25:19,120 --> 05:25:20,320
um

4558
05:25:20,320 --> 05:25:25,920
And I was very deter I in my audition video. I just kind of expressed how

4559
05:25:26,720 --> 05:25:31,760
Determined I was to help in just how much I would be a hard worker. I didn't do some people

4560
05:25:32,640 --> 05:25:38,400
People asked like did you how did you like what sexual thing did you do to get in? I didn't do anything

4561
05:25:39,120 --> 05:25:41,840
remotely naughty besides be like

4562
05:25:42,800 --> 05:25:44,000
like make a

4563
05:25:44,000 --> 05:25:46,000
silly like joke

4564
05:25:47,040 --> 05:25:49,040
I just read I

4565
05:25:49,440 --> 05:25:50,880
um

4566
05:25:50,880 --> 05:25:53,200
I just introduced myself played some clips

4567
05:25:53,920 --> 05:25:59,040
Uh, I read all the characters voice lines and different voices that I do and then

4568
05:25:59,840 --> 05:26:02,400
Because I I I didn't really have a set person

4569
05:26:02,960 --> 05:26:09,200
That I wanted to be in the company. So I trusted strongy to cast me for the right role and I think she did

4570
05:26:09,920 --> 05:26:11,920
um

4571
05:26:11,920 --> 05:26:17,280
It's funny. I kind of knew I would be ropes like I looking at the silhouette

4572
05:26:17,360 --> 05:26:19,360
I was immediately attracted to it

4573
05:26:19,760 --> 05:26:24,960
I thought I was going to be cast as like I see to be honest with you because of my past life, but um

4574
05:26:25,760 --> 05:26:28,720
But I I just fucking knew deep down. It's really weird

4575
05:26:30,160 --> 05:26:35,440
Like for the long stream, she'd be yeah, of course. I mean I said that not sure if she's the only one

4576
05:26:39,200 --> 05:26:43,840
Context I don't know it. Um, yeah talk to him if you want to know 100%

4577
05:26:44,400 --> 05:26:46,400
I don't even really hate cold

4578
05:26:46,880 --> 05:26:49,200
She be jorked it. Yeah, I jorked it

4579
05:26:49,200 --> 05:26:54,720
She has a lollip because I used to be a lolly

4580
05:26:55,840 --> 05:26:57,840
Does he know?

4581
05:26:58,240 --> 05:27:04,560
People think your auditions was poor. Yeah, which makes me laugh because literally I'll tell you what I did in my audition

4582
05:27:05,040 --> 05:27:06,880
I introduced myself

4583
05:27:06,880 --> 05:27:08,560
I played one clip

4584
05:27:08,560 --> 05:27:12,240
I continued to introduce myself. I played another funny clip

4585
05:27:13,200 --> 05:27:16,320
I continued to introduce myself. I played an asmr clip

4586
05:27:17,280 --> 05:27:19,280
Um, that's what they do

4587
05:27:21,120 --> 05:27:23,120
I talked

4588
05:27:23,360 --> 05:27:25,360
I did some voice acting

4589
05:27:26,240 --> 05:27:30,400
And then I told my commitment to be a lure and that was literally it

4590
05:27:32,880 --> 05:27:34,880
That was literally the audition

4591
05:27:36,560 --> 05:27:42,160
No, no, yeah, I didn't do any Mongolian throat singing. I was made I made sure to keep that away. I didn't do any yodeling

4592
05:27:43,120 --> 05:27:46,720
Don't make jokes aside. I think you fit her perfectly. Yeah

4593
05:27:48,320 --> 05:27:56,000
What sassy thing did you do bro joining a corpo even spice seems exactly I was very professional um in my

4594
05:27:57,040 --> 05:28:04,080
Uh audition video and I also was very professional for my interview because I didn't know if I was interviewing

4595
05:28:04,960 --> 05:28:08,240
Um, who I was interviewing for who I was interviewing with

4596
05:28:10,000 --> 05:28:11,840
um

4597
05:28:11,840 --> 05:28:15,760
Because I didn't think it would be strong. I thought it would be just the management management team

4598
05:28:16,080 --> 05:28:22,320
But it was actually just her telling me. Oh, yeah, you were our first choice. You saw you. Here's your model. You made it in

4599
05:28:23,040 --> 05:28:25,040
Sign this nda

4600
05:28:25,120 --> 05:28:27,360
And read the contract and let us know

4601
05:28:28,160 --> 05:28:30,160
You have a week to do it

4602
05:28:30,160 --> 05:28:33,600
Uh, yeah, she gave us a long time to look over the contract if we um

4603
05:28:34,080 --> 05:28:36,080
Tell like a lawyer look at it and stuff

4604
05:28:36,160 --> 05:28:39,280
Um, which was very nice of her. She was very patient. Um

4605
05:28:39,520 --> 05:28:44,160
I don't know if I'm allowed to say that but I just did so I think I think that's fine

4606
05:28:46,160 --> 05:28:51,120
Um, how hard did you would fit it? I would do that was so hard. Um

4607
05:28:52,160 --> 05:28:56,800
You didn't split and no, I didn't spit in sharny's mouth. Um, but yeah, it was one interview

4608
05:28:57,600 --> 05:29:02,080
Uh, they're always reviewed contracts. Yeah, exactly. Um

4609
05:29:04,480 --> 05:29:06,480
Yeah, it was just one interview

4610
05:29:06,880 --> 05:29:09,680
She was really nice. I had prepared like a whole thing

4611
05:29:11,040 --> 05:29:13,680
Like questions to ask how to respond

4612
05:29:14,800 --> 05:29:15,840
um

4613
05:29:15,840 --> 05:29:17,600
Very professional

4614
05:29:17,600 --> 05:29:22,880
I even like dressed up did my makeup in case she wanted to do like a video call and then

4615
05:29:23,600 --> 05:29:26,320
I realized yeah, it was just a normal way to go. Um

4616
05:29:27,680 --> 05:29:29,680
But yeah

4617
05:29:30,400 --> 05:29:32,400
How was the couch

4618
05:29:32,400 --> 05:29:37,680
Always a good sign when your player encourages you to fully examine your contract. Oh, yeah, she was very like, please look at it

4619
05:29:37,760 --> 05:29:43,040
Like please make sure this is what you want. Um, I read it over multiple times

4620
05:29:44,640 --> 05:29:46,160
it

4621
05:29:46,160 --> 05:29:49,920
She all says that her and a lawyer did a good job writing something up

4622
05:29:50,960 --> 05:29:56,000
I'm not allowed to say that I've read I had time to read my I don't know. I don't know if this shit works

4623
05:29:58,320 --> 05:30:00,320
You know hard it is for me to keep secrets

4624
05:30:01,040 --> 05:30:05,840
That's why I'm like, if any of you guys have any surprises, don't fucking tell me because we'll tell everyone

4625
05:30:05,840 --> 05:30:11,040
You know how hard it was just not say that I was she be it was so hard for me

4626
05:30:11,440 --> 05:30:16,320
I was dying. I changed the password on my account to my twitter

4627
05:30:18,880 --> 05:30:21,600
I had my friend change it and not tell me

4628
05:30:22,800 --> 05:30:27,760
So I couldn't get back in so I could so I wouldn't fucking accidentally sub tweet something

4629
05:30:28,400 --> 05:30:30,400
Or like something

4630
05:30:33,280 --> 05:30:36,960
Because I was so happy and when you're so happy you want to share it with people that you love

4631
05:30:37,040 --> 05:30:41,200
And so I wanted to share it with my community because I love my community and I knew they would be happy for me

4632
05:30:42,720 --> 05:30:44,720
Oh, yeah

4633
05:30:45,920 --> 05:30:47,920
It's that bad, huh?

4634
05:30:52,800 --> 05:30:57,120
I'm getting eepy 10 30 I should probably go to bed

4635
05:30:58,480 --> 05:31:00,480
Need to make some tea

4636
05:31:01,520 --> 05:31:05,440
Um, but should you be in spoilers domo?

4637
05:31:06,800 --> 05:31:09,840
Honestly though, that's that's that's me. That's why I

4638
05:31:10,960 --> 05:31:15,920
Like I already know a bit about gen 2 and it's very hard not to talk about it

4639
05:31:18,400 --> 05:31:22,400
But um before I go to bed, did you guys have any more questions for me?

4640
05:31:23,040 --> 05:31:25,200
I don't mind answering any questions you guys have

4641
05:31:25,760 --> 05:31:28,560
You guys know I'm a very open book and I love to yeah

4642
05:31:29,200 --> 05:31:33,600
And barely play games. I am a just chatting streamer. I have to fart

4643
05:31:35,600 --> 05:31:38,480
I don't know if you heard that whisper of a fart. I really hope you didn't

4644
05:31:40,720 --> 05:31:42,720
No spoilers for gen 2

4645
05:31:44,400 --> 05:31:48,160
You mean how strong he hasn't even said that gen 2 is in the works

4646
05:31:49,920 --> 05:31:51,920
Yes, she has

4647
05:31:52,880 --> 05:31:55,520
She definitely said the gen 2 is in the works

4648
05:31:59,920 --> 05:32:01,920
Huh, can you pronounce?

4649
05:32:11,680 --> 05:32:16,480
Yeah, I'm starting to can't stop talking about gen 2. She's so excited. Yeah, she's talking about fucking gen 3

4650
05:32:16,480 --> 05:32:21,600
It's talking about gen 3

4651
05:32:24,080 --> 05:32:26,080
Um

4652
05:32:26,080 --> 05:32:28,080
I had to be like can you stop

4653
05:32:28,160 --> 05:32:34,160
I'm like strani. You're making me feel bad. I'm like you're already conceptualizing gen 2 and 3. What about me?

4654
05:32:34,320 --> 05:32:38,320
She's like, no, no, no, no, I don't want you to feel bad. And I'm like, no, I'm kidding. I'm excited

4655
05:32:38,640 --> 05:32:44,160
Can I please help? And she's like, yes, I'm like, thank you slam girl. I was shot down, but it's fine

4656
05:32:47,440 --> 05:32:50,240
Okay, wait, how do you pronounce it then?

4657
05:32:52,080 --> 05:32:54,080
How do you pronounce it?

4658
05:32:57,520 --> 05:33:04,000
Yeah, I think me and strani are so like it's kind of weird. She's just in a Scottish font

4659
05:33:05,920 --> 05:33:10,480
She says she is gen 2 and gen 3 in games names for them. Yeah, exactly

4660
05:33:11,360 --> 05:33:15,120
I'm I'm gonna try to talk her down from some of the names. That's all I'm gonna say

4661
05:33:15,120 --> 05:33:17,120
I can't read

4662
05:33:17,760 --> 05:33:19,760
I can't read

4663
05:33:20,080 --> 05:33:22,480
Leave me alone. I don't speak French that well

4664
05:33:24,400 --> 05:33:26,400
I mean squarel

4665
05:33:26,880 --> 05:33:30,800
I can't read I can't I can't I can't

4666
05:33:32,240 --> 05:33:34,400
Should give you some towns

4667
05:33:36,640 --> 05:33:38,640
In my area to pronounce

4668
05:33:38,640 --> 05:33:45,680
Talks about Jennifer with slides will be destroyed

4669
05:33:47,440 --> 05:33:51,040
Pretty sure she has rescued herself from naming future gents. Yeah

4670
05:33:53,040 --> 05:33:56,720
The reason it's a slime girl is because she's thinking of the name of a slimy slime hole

4671
05:34:01,760 --> 05:34:03,760
One of them accidentally docks you wait what?

4672
05:34:05,840 --> 05:34:07,840
Oh like that. No, um

4673
05:34:09,200 --> 05:34:11,200
So like

4674
05:34:12,560 --> 05:34:14,560
I'm not

4675
05:34:14,640 --> 05:34:18,080
Afraid to say like I live in America on the east coast

4676
05:34:18,880 --> 05:34:21,680
There's a lot of how hard to pronounce

4677
05:34:23,360 --> 05:34:25,360
Like towns and cities

4678
05:34:25,920 --> 05:34:28,240
Like all around along the east coast

4679
05:34:29,440 --> 05:34:32,160
So like especially in fucking New England

4680
05:34:32,240 --> 05:34:34,240
I

4681
05:34:34,720 --> 05:34:39,280
Guys don't fuck with fondle of bosom. I actually really want to bring back fondle of bosom

4682
05:34:40,080 --> 05:34:42,480
And she could be like a really touchy feely person

4683
05:34:44,080 --> 05:34:46,640
Games is a video game. She got the concept for oh, okay

4684
05:34:48,480 --> 05:34:52,160
In death a member of project wheeler has a name her name is fondle

4685
05:34:53,840 --> 05:34:55,840
Of the liberty city. Yeah

4686
05:35:03,120 --> 05:35:08,240
You look nice when you're just laying in bed instead of walking and stomping all over my booze

4687
05:35:09,520 --> 05:35:14,400
East coast represent somebody said they knew I was east coast because I talk so bluntly

4688
05:35:15,440 --> 05:35:18,080
And that I have an accent and I never fucking noticed that

4689
05:35:19,200 --> 05:35:21,200
Come on beat that. Please come back

4690
05:35:21,520 --> 05:35:23,520
You can just say come on beat it

4691
05:35:24,080 --> 05:35:26,080
beat

4692
05:35:26,800 --> 05:35:32,080
They're like she's I just like I've never been clocked on where I like where I'm from

4693
05:35:32,240 --> 05:35:33,360
before

4694
05:35:33,360 --> 05:35:35,360
And I didn't know that being blunt

4695
05:35:36,640 --> 05:35:40,000
Was a thing like they knew where I was from and I was like

4696
05:35:41,040 --> 05:35:43,040
Damn

4697
05:35:43,280 --> 05:35:45,280
I did not think that I also

4698
05:35:46,320 --> 05:35:51,200
I well, yeah, I use eastern. Yeah, that's fine. Um, and I also I talk fast

4699
05:35:52,240 --> 05:35:57,200
Because I know people from the south talk slower. Remember when I visited my grandparents in florida

4700
05:35:57,600 --> 05:35:59,360
um

4701
05:35:59,360 --> 05:36:03,680
They would like people I would talk to you that were that was like can you speed the fuck up?

4702
05:36:04,800 --> 05:36:06,800
Because you're talking

4703
05:36:07,280 --> 05:36:10,560
Like this. Oh my god was so fucking annoying

4704
05:36:12,480 --> 05:36:16,480
When you said you visited Montreal, that's more evident around the east coast. That's a good point

4705
05:36:17,280 --> 05:36:22,160
East coast is kind but not nice. Oh, yeah. No east coasts. We're fucking dicks

4706
05:36:23,680 --> 05:36:26,720
Especially massachusetts. That's why they call them mass holes

4707
05:36:27,760 --> 05:36:29,760
I always thought that was funny. They call them that

4708
05:36:31,440 --> 05:36:36,720
Yeah, new england people are cold, especially a lot of people are chill. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of people are chill

4709
05:36:38,160 --> 05:36:40,160
medicaid people are fucking uppity

4710
05:36:41,040 --> 05:36:42,640
try thing

4711
05:36:42,640 --> 05:36:44,640
North Carolina, georgia

4712
05:36:45,440 --> 05:36:47,440
They're kind of nice

4713
05:36:47,440 --> 05:36:49,440
carolinas are nice

4714
05:36:50,800 --> 05:36:55,520
Strings them and how much information is conveyed per second by different languages and accents, right? Yeah

4715
05:36:55,760 --> 05:36:58,260
Because you can literally like especially if you're in like the uk

4716
05:36:59,520 --> 05:37:01,520
You can clock someone's accent

4717
05:37:02,400 --> 05:37:04,400
Because they're all accents are by region

4718
05:37:06,400 --> 05:37:08,400
Like i'm sure you could probably look at a british

4719
05:37:08,800 --> 05:37:14,400
Vtuber and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of british vtubers change their accents so that they don't

4720
05:37:15,760 --> 05:37:17,760
You don't know where they're from

4721
05:37:18,960 --> 05:37:20,960
The latel fiends are in our own special

4722
05:37:25,600 --> 05:37:28,400
We have to be chillin florida or else we'd melt

4723
05:37:29,200 --> 05:37:30,800
true

4724
05:37:30,800 --> 05:37:35,280
Got the opposite. It's not yin and yin only other field filipino side was british or something

4725
05:37:35,840 --> 05:37:37,840
No, i'm pretty sure i have american accent

4726
05:37:38,400 --> 05:37:40,400
yeah, i've got

4727
05:37:41,760 --> 05:37:45,520
Like i do have like i'll have an accent sometimes that slips out

4728
05:37:46,400 --> 05:37:50,240
And i don't know if a lot of people have like heard it slip out

4729
05:37:51,120 --> 05:37:53,120
Like obviously i'm from america

4730
05:37:53,440 --> 05:37:56,480
And east coast but i like sometimes when i get super excited

4731
05:37:57,280 --> 05:37:59,280

4734
05:38:06,320 --> 05:38:08,320
My accent comes out

4735
05:38:08,560 --> 05:38:10,000
but uh

4736
05:38:10,000 --> 05:38:12,000
Miss origan tipped 50 dollars

4737
05:38:12,400 --> 05:38:18,080
You're the first vtuber i've ever watched and you quickly become probably my favorite content creator period

05:38:18,880 --> 05:38:21,200

4743
05:38:49,040 --> 05:38:54,080
Being a lot more confident than it used to be. I just don't like looking at people. I don't know what the fucking tell you

No, i'm kidding. Um, no, where am i?

4746

And so i'll usually just like look down and smile

4747
05:39:08,240 --> 05:39:12,480
Um, but lately i've been trying to say hello to people

4748
05:39:14,960 --> 05:39:16,960

05:39:29,600 --> 05:39:34,240
I'm like and this guy like is like i'm getting coffee and i'm one of like the little station

4753
05:39:34,320 --> 05:39:37,360
And then this guy comes and starts talking to me and i'm like, uh

4754
05:39:38,640 --> 05:39:40,640
Why are you talking to me like you don't

4755
05:39:41,440 --> 05:39:45,120
You don't have to talk to me right now. Like can you please go away?

4756
05:39:56,560 --> 05:39:59,920
But like i've also adapted a skill that i've seen my dad do

4757
05:40:00,640 --> 05:40:04,640
Um, my dad has a special skill where he can be friends with about anyone

4758
05:40:06,800 --> 05:40:10,400
Uh, he finds common ground. He makes a joke

4759
05:40:11,600 --> 05:40:15,280
And then miraculously he just becomes friends with this person and then

4760
05:40:16,000 --> 05:40:19,120
He i might say becomes friends with everybody. I'm not even fucking joking

4761
05:40:19,440 --> 05:40:23,440
He'll talk he'll like catch a snippet of a conversation that someone's having on the street

4762
05:40:23,680 --> 05:40:26,720
Make a joke and then make the person laugh and then they're just friends

4763
05:40:27,360 --> 05:40:34,320
He like i forget what the fuck he did. So my dad really likes to drink bourbon. Um, he likes uh, he's a collector

4764
05:40:34,880 --> 05:40:35,920
um

4765
05:40:35,920 --> 05:40:41,360
And like if you go to my parents house, they look they're a bunch of fucking alcoholics because they just have a shit ton of bourbon

4766
05:40:41,680 --> 05:40:44,560
In this one side of the room, but it's it's it's not even like that

4767
05:40:44,560 --> 05:40:48,880
My dad just likes to collect and like have it not even drink it. Um

4768
05:40:50,320 --> 05:40:52,800
And so he goes to like this place

4769
05:40:53,360 --> 05:40:56,560
Strikes up a conversation just being really friendly and getting to know

4770
05:40:57,040 --> 05:40:59,040
They're like cracking jokes with the cashier

4771
05:40:59,680 --> 05:41:00,720
and then

4772
05:41:00,720 --> 05:41:02,720
Over the course of a couple weeks

4773
05:41:02,960 --> 05:41:07,760
He becomes like boys with the cashier and then the cashier hooks him up with like

4774
05:41:08,080 --> 05:41:11,120
Really like and like calls him ahead when they get in like good stuff

4775
05:41:11,440 --> 05:41:16,880
And i'm like what the fuck and i'm like, oh wait, it just pays to be nice to people because then they're nice back

4776
05:41:18,640 --> 05:41:20,480
So um

4777
05:41:20,480 --> 05:41:26,720
And then like i'm like, you know, so i'm trying to be more like my dad in that way and just be nice to people

4778
05:41:30,800 --> 05:41:32,800
Just fucking

4779
05:41:33,200 --> 05:41:35,200
It's cat hair in my mouth

4780
05:41:35,440 --> 05:41:37,280
um

4781
05:41:37,280 --> 05:41:39,440
And it's it's very like i think

4782
05:41:41,280 --> 05:41:45,920
There there's this um little girl in my building and i don't know why she likes me so much

4783
05:41:46,560 --> 05:41:54,160
Um, i think because i look like i should be like her sister or something. She's like this really cute um Spanish girl with curly hair

4784
05:41:54,960 --> 05:41:56,560
and

4785
05:41:56,560 --> 05:41:58,960
She saw me in the elevator one day

4786
05:41:59,680 --> 05:42:02,880
And she was wearing a bathing suit

4787
05:42:03,600 --> 05:42:08,400
And i'm just sitting there and like kids are great because they just like talk to you for no reason

4788
05:42:08,640 --> 05:42:10,640
and they just just because they just don't know like

4789
05:42:12,000 --> 05:42:16,880
Like social cues and i'm like just i literally look like a shit. I'm like in shorts

4790
05:42:17,520 --> 05:42:21,440
A sweatshirt a hood's up. I'm like i look like i'm fucking pathetic

4791
05:42:22,240 --> 05:42:23,840
homeless girl

4792
05:42:23,840 --> 05:42:25,680
my face is like

4793
05:42:25,680 --> 05:42:28,560
Messy and this little girl looks up at me and she's like

4794
05:42:29,360 --> 05:42:31,600
Do you like my unicorn bathing suit?

4795
05:42:32,080 --> 05:42:34,080
And i look at her and i'm like

4796
05:42:34,160 --> 05:42:35,360
And i

4797
05:42:35,360 --> 05:42:39,520
And i'm like, oh my god. Yes, it's so great. She's like see mom. She likes it

4798
05:42:40,320 --> 05:42:42,320
And then every time i see her

4799
05:42:42,720 --> 05:42:44,720
She always makes sure she says hi to me

4800
05:42:45,680 --> 05:42:47,920
and she's like and then um

4801
05:42:48,880 --> 05:42:54,080
She like ran over to me one day when i was in the lobby of the apartment building and her mom's like

4802
05:42:54,640 --> 05:42:58,880
Redacted come back and she's like i'm saying hi to my friend mom and i'm just like

And so i'm like, you know what i strive to be this child

4804
05:43:03,920 --> 05:43:06,720
That's really cute. It was really fucking cute. Um

4805
05:43:07,920 --> 05:43:14,000
She was really sweet. She's like i like the like the natural cuteness and curiosity of kids. This is so funny to me

4806
05:43:14,480 --> 05:43:17,520
Uh, and then like it happened again with like another kid

4807
05:43:18,160 --> 05:43:22,000
Uh, and i'm like, do i just have that like that face where like do you kid?

4808
05:43:22,000 --> 05:43:25,360
I'm like, i don't know if the kid's pity me or they're like, uh, you know what? I want to talk to her

4809
05:43:25,840 --> 05:43:30,800
I like i'm i'm going to pick up my door dash. I think it was like yesterday or the day before

4810
05:43:31,200 --> 05:43:32,880
No, it was definitely yesterday

4811
05:43:32,880 --> 05:43:38,080
And i get into the elevator and now it's super hot outside and we have a pool in my apartment and so people um

4812
05:43:38,880 --> 05:43:40,880
Like we're leaving to go to the pool. There's like four kids

4813
05:43:41,360 --> 05:43:47,520
Piling the elevator with their mom and then one of the the girls just starts talking to me and i'm just like

4814
05:43:48,480 --> 05:43:54,480
She's like, hey, it's really hot outside. Isn't it? We're going to the pool. I'm like, oh, wow. I hope you guys have a lot of fun

4815
05:43:56,640 --> 05:44:02,400
And they're like, okay. Bye as we get to the first floor and I go to go pick up my my uh my food

4816
05:44:02,880 --> 05:44:06,240
But it's just it was just it's this is sweet. It was just really sweet

4817
05:44:07,600 --> 05:44:12,240
Congratulations, you're a best friend now and it's like I've always been good with kids

4818
05:44:12,400 --> 05:44:16,480
I don't know why like I used to work at like a sermon camp. I used to be like a camp counselor and stuff

4819
05:44:16,960 --> 05:44:18,960
and um, I remember

4820
05:44:19,200 --> 05:44:21,440
There was this time where um

4821
05:44:21,440 --> 05:44:27,120
These girls were like arguing because they wanted me to like I was a better artist than I am now

4822
05:44:27,680 --> 05:44:28,240
um

4823
05:44:28,240 --> 05:44:31,520
Because I kept up with it and they're like, can you draw our monster high dolls?

4824
05:44:31,520 --> 05:44:37,040
So I would draw their monster high dolls and they would fight over whose doll gets to be drawn. It was so cute

4825
05:44:37,680 --> 05:44:39,680
um

4826
05:44:40,800 --> 05:44:45,120
I could smile with an awesomer expression in my private video the other day how they were like, oh, that's cute

4827
05:44:45,120 --> 05:44:47,120
It was like

4828
05:44:48,160 --> 05:44:50,160
What the fuck did I miss something?

4829
05:44:56,000 --> 05:45:01,200
If you think you look at that, oh, no, if you guys saw me be like, who is this little stinky rat girl

4830
05:45:02,320 --> 05:45:04,320
I looked like I was going to rob someone

4831
05:45:06,000 --> 05:45:10,640
Wawa you narrowed that down a bit. Well, it was a wawa because there's no wawa's in our area

4832
05:45:11,920 --> 05:45:13,920
Right from they don't we don't have wawa

4833
05:45:16,000 --> 05:45:18,000
So

4834
05:45:25,680 --> 05:45:30,000
It's like the little the little innocence of kids like they don't need like they're not rude

4835
05:45:30,080 --> 05:45:33,280
There's no malice behind what they say like they're just generally

4836
05:45:34,400 --> 05:45:37,760
Just talking to you like and it's just it's refreshing

4837
05:45:38,480 --> 05:45:40,480
But

4838
05:45:43,680 --> 05:45:47,280
Yeah, it's just like I want to be more like that like just be like hey

4839
05:45:48,640 --> 05:45:52,640
And that's why like that's what I'm gonna try to do in the v2 breed thing like community and shit

4840
05:45:52,880 --> 05:45:54,880
That's why like I'm trying to

4841
05:45:55,280 --> 05:45:59,840
Like be like hey, I'll do this thing with you or I'll do this collab or I'll do that

4842
05:46:08,080 --> 05:46:11,680
And it adopted me. Yeah, maybe I guess so

4843
05:46:12,480 --> 05:46:14,640
um

4844
05:46:14,640 --> 05:46:18,960
Oh, yeah, that's not what morgan said reminds me. Uh, I remember I went to like

4845
05:46:19,920 --> 05:46:21,120
uh

4846
05:46:21,120 --> 05:46:23,120
An event where I dressed up

4847
05:46:24,320 --> 05:46:26,320
Yeah, as in like a cosplay

4848
05:46:26,880 --> 05:46:27,920
um

4849
05:46:27,920 --> 05:46:32,800
And this little girl asked to take a picture with me and I literally wanted to cry and like other people wanted to take pictures with me

4850
05:46:32,800 --> 05:46:34,400
And I was just like, oh my god

4851
05:46:34,480 --> 05:46:38,000
Like they think I'm gonna I look cool enough to ask for a picture

4852
05:46:39,040 --> 05:46:41,040
And I was like, okay

4853
05:46:42,240 --> 05:46:44,240
It was it was it's nice

4854
05:46:48,160 --> 05:46:54,720
I know rena rena's looking at me like why aren't you in bed yet? She'd be piqued. Yeah, it's only downhill for me or guys

4855
05:46:56,720 --> 05:46:59,120
She'd be cool. I try to be cool

4856
05:46:59,120 --> 05:47:01,120
I

4857
05:47:02,000 --> 05:47:04,000
See me I try to be cool

4858
05:47:04,000 --> 05:47:06,880
I think I'm a cool cat cool rabbit, you know

4859
05:47:08,080 --> 05:47:10,720
I'm cool. Yeah, I can be cool. I can be hip with the kids, you know

4860
05:47:11,680 --> 05:47:15,760
I know about fortnight and um fortnight dances and v-wux and all that

4861
05:47:22,400 --> 05:47:24,560
Cool rabbit sheep. Yeah, exactly

4862
05:47:25,040 --> 05:47:30,160
Kids don't have souls. Oh, yeah, no, there's definitely some like kids that are like really fucking shitty out there

4863
05:47:30,800 --> 05:47:34,000
Like I don't want kids, for example. I like I don't want kids

4864
05:47:35,200 --> 05:47:41,760
One because I don't know if I didn't have kids because I don't know if I have falls less than over a century or not, but um

4865
05:47:43,120 --> 05:47:47,600
I also just like it's a lot to raise a whole ass child. Like I don't want to

4866
05:47:48,240 --> 05:47:50,720
Traumatize them and make them hate me

4867
05:47:51,680 --> 05:47:56,720
I know what I put my parents through so I don't want to put my child through that with me

4868
05:47:58,640 --> 05:48:01,120
Um, you know fucking children are expensive

4869
05:48:02,240 --> 05:48:05,840
That means like I'm 56. Where am I gonna find a dude?

4870
05:48:06,960 --> 05:48:08,960
Who wants to have kids with me?

4871
05:48:09,760 --> 05:48:14,240
I'm like, I don't I just don't fucking care. I just like having cats

4872
05:48:14,960 --> 05:48:16,160
I

4873
05:48:16,160 --> 05:48:21,600
Was at a con for some reason. There's a couple of people that cosplay that didn't want their photo taken. Oh, yeah

4874
05:48:22,480 --> 05:48:26,720
Sometimes you just go just to dress up and have fun. I got it. They just want to take pictures with their friends

4875
05:48:27,600 --> 05:48:28,880
right here

4876
05:48:28,880 --> 05:48:30,880
To be too boy, no show would be dope

4877
05:48:32,720 --> 05:48:35,200
I find you have a sort of effless cool with how Jenny when you are

4878
05:48:36,240 --> 05:48:37,920
you know, uh

4879
05:48:37,920 --> 05:48:41,920
I feel like that's actually not the first time someone said that to me not to toot my own horn

4880
05:48:42,720 --> 05:48:47,760
Um, people have always said I'm just really easy to talk to and that's why people tend to like

4881
05:48:48,400 --> 05:48:50,400
Accidentally overshare with me

4882
05:48:51,600 --> 05:48:55,280
Uh, uh, I'll just be like, hey, how are you feeling? They'd be like, um, you know

4883
05:48:55,680 --> 05:49:00,000
Try to make small talk and then I'm not the type of person who I just like walk away and be like, okay

4884
05:49:00,240 --> 05:49:05,280
Thanks for checking in. Um, I'll like like elaborate with my question. Raina. What the fuck are you doing?

4885
05:49:06,080 --> 05:49:08,960
She's rubbing against my monitor lady. Can you?

4886
05:49:09,840 --> 05:49:10,960
No

4887
05:49:10,960 --> 05:49:12,400
ma'am

4888
05:49:12,400 --> 05:49:13,920
I can't stop you

4889
05:49:13,920 --> 05:49:15,920
I'm too tired to reach over

4890
05:49:16,400 --> 05:49:18,720
It's your little twitchy, but what are you doing?

4891
05:49:20,000 --> 05:49:22,000
Hi, Raina

4892
05:49:24,800 --> 05:49:30,240
Raina's like lost weight and she looks so goofy. I mean she used to be super fucking overweight. She was like 17

4893
05:49:30,880 --> 05:49:32,880
Almost 20 pounds. Um

4894
05:49:33,760 --> 05:49:35,760
But she lost a lot of weight

4895
05:49:36,640 --> 05:49:42,480
Sadly because she went through a little depressing episode when her sister passed away, which I don't blame her and when I moved into my apartment

4896
05:49:42,480 --> 05:49:44,480
I took her with me. Um

4897
05:49:45,520 --> 05:49:47,680
Yeah, Raina, she's a little meow

4898
05:49:48,480 --> 05:49:49,840
um

4899
05:49:49,840 --> 05:49:53,680
So she's she's got a healthy weight now, but I miss her her chunky size

4900
05:49:54,960 --> 05:49:56,960
Oh you purring big mamas

4901
05:49:57,920 --> 05:50:01,920
Oh, yeah, she was she was a chonker because Siamese cats tend to overeat

4902
05:50:02,720 --> 05:50:06,480
She's my life stories, ma'am

4903
05:50:09,120 --> 05:50:12,560
Do you think your openness is a good thing or has it caused you unwanted problems?

4904
05:50:13,280 --> 05:50:14,560
um

4905
05:50:14,560 --> 05:50:17,920
I think some people probably wish that I was a little bit more

4906
05:50:18,720 --> 05:50:21,920
left things to the imagination or like didn't share

4907
05:50:23,280 --> 05:50:26,880
Like I know sometimes things I'll share something like I bet

4908
05:50:27,520 --> 05:50:29,520
someone has like

4909
05:50:29,840 --> 05:50:32,960
Like I said like I want a reduction and they're like, oh, why the

4910
05:50:33,520 --> 05:50:39,120
Ruin filtered. Why did she have to say that? Oh, no, but like I'm just telling you

4911
05:50:40,560 --> 05:50:42,560
You know just because I want to tell you

4912
05:50:43,920 --> 05:50:45,920
And like that's fine. That's okay

4913
05:50:46,960 --> 05:50:48,480
um

4914
05:50:48,480 --> 05:50:52,160
It is what it is or like I might say something like oh, I'm not gonna do this content

4915
05:50:53,200 --> 05:50:56,480
Like oh, why would you say that? Oh because I'm gonna be honest

4916
05:50:56,480 --> 05:50:59,440
Do you want to just be strung along and let on? No, like

4917
05:51:00,240 --> 05:51:04,720
If you want me to lead you on I'll lead you on I suppose sorry rena's are being against my microphone

4918
05:51:05,440 --> 05:51:07,440
um

4919
05:51:07,760 --> 05:51:09,760
I'm like this. I'm just how I am

4920
05:51:12,000 --> 05:51:16,000
Buenos dias shippies me fun time freddy. So what did I miss?

4921
05:51:17,360 --> 05:51:19,360
Buenos dias freddy

4922
05:51:20,800 --> 05:51:24,080
Well, buenas noche. It's night time for me freddy

4923
05:51:25,040 --> 05:51:27,040
It's night time for me

4924
05:51:30,800 --> 05:51:32,080
um

4925
05:51:32,080 --> 05:51:34,080
but I think people also

4926
05:51:35,040 --> 05:51:42,960
Are refreshed by my openness as a vtuber because vtubers usually constantly play as something or pretend to be someone or not or

4927
05:51:44,400 --> 05:51:48,640
And I think I I like how real I am. So I I think I'm refreshing in that

4928
05:51:49,440 --> 05:51:53,920
You know it if you don't like it, I can't stop you from not watching

4929
05:51:54,480 --> 05:51:56,480
I'm gonna fucking glue your eyes to the screen

4930
05:51:59,040 --> 05:52:01,440
You want to be led in a leash not in false sense

4931
05:52:05,760 --> 05:52:08,640
She won't make submissive crying a some more it's over

4932
05:52:08,960 --> 05:52:10,960
I

4933
05:52:14,000 --> 05:52:20,960
Realness of this whole company is refreshing. Yes, I agree with that because I feel like we're all very real

4934
05:52:21,360 --> 05:52:23,360
Like we're all very open

4935
05:52:23,760 --> 05:52:28,240
Which you don't get and I know that actually can put a lot of people off because you know

4936
05:52:28,800 --> 05:52:31,840
First some it might ruin the fantasy

4937
05:52:32,640 --> 05:52:35,520
And I understand that I can't disagree with you

4938
05:52:36,240 --> 05:52:38,000
um

4939
05:52:38,000 --> 05:52:40,320
But for some it kind of like makes it better. I don't know

4940
05:52:41,680 --> 05:52:46,240
Most of us appreciate it. It might be small, little minority who complain. Yeah

4941
05:52:47,040 --> 05:52:49,040
Yeah

4942
05:52:49,760 --> 05:52:51,760
um

4943
05:52:51,840 --> 05:52:56,160
And I do you want to say like who who complain their opinions are still valid. Um

4944
05:52:57,520 --> 05:53:01,200
I don't want you to ever think just because like we might disagree on something that

4945
05:53:02,240 --> 05:53:04,960
I fucking hate you. It's really hard for me to hate people

4946
05:53:05,920 --> 05:53:07,920
uh

4947
05:53:08,080 --> 05:53:10,080
Definitely open on the else

4948
05:53:11,200 --> 05:53:18,160
Open this asshole. Um rena. Can I please move you? She's like just sitting on me and I'm like uncomfortable

4949
05:53:18,640 --> 05:53:22,720
She's just you're not in a good position to sit on me lady

4950
05:53:24,320 --> 05:53:27,360
Thank you. I appreciate it. She's moved to the bed

4951
05:53:29,200 --> 05:53:31,200
um

4952
05:53:32,000 --> 05:53:34,000
I miss her and I thought you said Europeans

4953
05:53:34,720 --> 05:53:36,720
are still valid

4954
05:53:37,280 --> 05:53:39,280
your opinions

4955
05:53:40,000 --> 05:53:42,000
Europeans are still valid

4956
05:53:44,640 --> 05:53:46,640
um, but

4957
05:53:54,000 --> 05:53:58,960
They're not valid. Oh, no, okay. Um, like you're

4958
05:53:59,920 --> 05:54:03,280
You're still allowed to dislike me

4959
05:54:04,320 --> 05:54:09,840
I'll like the content or do how I talk or what I might do in the future or what the other girls do

4960
05:54:10,480 --> 05:54:13,440
um, but you just don't have to make it a habit to

4961
05:54:14,400 --> 05:54:16,400
Try to drag us, you know

4962
05:54:16,560 --> 05:54:18,560
You can just leave

4963
05:54:18,800 --> 05:54:21,280
Just shut your eyes and walk away from the computer, bro

4964
05:54:23,040 --> 05:54:25,520
Or just like look up that one Tyler the creator tweet

4965
05:54:29,760 --> 05:54:34,800
Hey, European people in chat. You're valid. I think they're all asleep right now. It's very late for them

4966
05:54:37,440 --> 05:54:41,120
Maybe I don't know what time is it for the our European friends

4967
05:54:43,200 --> 05:54:46,720
I'm probably gonna as mercy streaming today. I'll probably read into her

4968
05:54:47,520 --> 05:54:50,560
If you want fantasy, you probably have to find specific vtubers that do that

4969
05:54:50,560 --> 05:54:54,720
Some people just use models because they want to be secretive or have to set up stuff. That's true

4970
05:54:55,520 --> 05:54:57,280
I think

4971
05:54:57,280 --> 05:54:58,880
you know

4972
05:54:59,840 --> 05:55:01,840
I

4973
05:55:03,760 --> 05:55:06,000
I was totally prepared to like

4974
05:55:06,720 --> 05:55:08,720
play a character

4975
05:55:09,120 --> 05:55:11,120
Being in v alert an agency

4976
05:55:11,680 --> 05:55:17,520
But I think to be honest because of my audience and because of management and astronomy

4977
05:55:18,480 --> 05:55:23,520
I feel comfortable being myself. I think if I got into like a different company

4978
05:55:23,680 --> 05:55:26,080
I could be like say so I could be

4979
05:55:26,960 --> 05:55:28,960
You know play the character

4980
05:55:29,440 --> 05:55:33,280
Um, I did definitely kind of play a character when I was ran up

4981
05:55:33,680 --> 05:55:35,440
But I really do

4982
05:55:35,440 --> 05:55:37,520
Feel and I'm kind of just realizing this now that

4983
05:55:38,400 --> 05:55:40,400
I'm very much myself

4984
05:55:40,800 --> 05:55:42,080
As she be

4985
05:55:42,080 --> 05:55:44,080
It's very interesting

4986
05:55:44,720 --> 05:55:46,720
Is there is life? Oh, okay

4987
05:55:46,880 --> 05:55:49,120
Or maybe I can just like raid someone random

4988
05:55:50,080 --> 05:55:53,520
Make, you know, I've got to make those friendships those connections raid someone from

4989
05:55:54,240 --> 05:55:56,240
A different different company

4990
05:55:57,600 --> 05:56:00,560
In characters with the patreon audios are for yeah, exactly

4991
05:56:01,040 --> 05:56:05,360
Um, and then sometimes, you know, there's different roles that I play in the patreon audios

4992
05:56:05,680 --> 05:56:06,560
but

4993
05:56:06,560 --> 05:56:09,200
I hope you guys liked it by the way. Um, again, that was

4994
05:56:09,680 --> 05:56:14,640
This month is the first month that I recorded back in april and I've definitely learned a lot since then

4995
05:56:14,960 --> 05:56:15,840
so

4996
05:56:15,840 --> 05:56:22,160
I feel I feel like because I've recorded three months of audios in advance. Uh, I recorded june july and august

4997
05:56:22,720 --> 05:56:27,760
Uh, I I was gonna start september. I haven't done that yet. I'll probably do it soon. Um,

4998
05:56:28,400 --> 05:56:32,080
But the september audios will probably be a lot

4999
05:56:33,040 --> 05:56:36,880
Different than like because just because like the feedback I've gotten

5000
05:56:37,600 --> 05:56:39,840
Um, the advice I've gotten

5001
05:56:40,800 --> 05:56:46,000
So I feel like there'll be improvements like at least september on

5002
05:56:46,720 --> 05:56:48,400
uh, and then

5003
05:56:48,400 --> 05:56:53,440
You guys have also given feedback to like strani and stuff about like the scripts you want us to fill

5004
05:56:54,000 --> 05:56:58,000
Come and that's why like strani wants like, oh, we need to make a whole month of you

5005
05:56:58,000 --> 05:57:01,920
Just like straight dom like hardcore and I'm like facts. Please. Let's do it

5006
05:57:02,320 --> 05:57:05,680
That's what we give the people what they want. Give them the dom that they ask for

5007
05:57:06,480 --> 05:57:08,480
um, but yeah

5008
05:57:08,640 --> 05:57:11,520
Okay, oh, yeah, no, it's I've paced myself for that

5009
05:57:12,240 --> 05:57:14,240
um

5010
05:57:14,240 --> 05:57:15,440
I also

5011
05:57:15,440 --> 05:57:21,920
I have a lot of free time. Um, when I was out of work on leave and now since I'm just I've quit entirely

5012
05:57:22,560 --> 05:57:24,240
um

5013
05:57:24,240 --> 05:57:28,240
I so I just cranked them out. The other girls had a lot of other obligations

5014
05:57:28,240 --> 05:57:31,440
They had to do so like I finished a lot of my shit in the first month

5015
05:57:32,800 --> 05:57:35,600
Like I and then I was like, please strani throw most rough at me

5016
05:57:35,600 --> 05:57:40,080
So should you just get thrown scripts at me? Um and shorts at me to do

5017
05:57:40,720 --> 05:57:43,040
But yeah, don't worry about me. I don't

5018
05:57:43,920 --> 05:57:45,920
Me and strani

5019
05:57:46,880 --> 05:57:52,320
Like I attain to be as hard working as strani is she is the hard-working working autism

5020
05:57:52,400 --> 05:57:54,800
I don't have autism that I fucking know of

5021
05:57:55,120 --> 05:58:00,000
Um, but I am definitely inspired by her work ethic to work as much as I do

5022
05:58:01,840 --> 05:58:04,160
M's and the switches are eating good on them of facts

5023
05:58:04,720 --> 05:58:09,920
Yeah, like listening to them patriot, but I still need to listen to the second one more to finalize my feedback. Okay

5024
05:58:10,720 --> 05:58:15,440
I feel like I don't know why I just got the equivalent of like someone sipping wine be like

5025
05:58:17,440 --> 05:58:20,160
I need to finalize my feedback for this flavor

5026
05:58:23,840 --> 05:58:28,320
But yeah, I hope if you're going to sleep good night, um, I'm gonna raid someone

5027
05:58:28,720 --> 05:58:34,720
Let's see. Maybe we'll yeah, maybe we'll raid someone new. I don't know if anybody's streaming us late

5028
05:58:40,880 --> 05:58:42,880
Let's see

5029
05:58:44,320 --> 05:58:46,320
Yeah, me

5030
05:58:47,920 --> 05:58:53,440
I think I'm gonna raid Maeve. Yeah, she just hit 100k. I'm just playing Elden Ring

5031
05:58:55,600 --> 05:58:58,000
Yeah, we'll we'll raid Maeve. That's cool

5032
05:58:59,440 --> 05:59:01,440
from from, um

5033
05:59:01,760 --> 05:59:03,760
Inyo, yeah

5034
05:59:04,160 --> 05:59:06,160
Um

5035
05:59:18,160 --> 05:59:21,680
Trying to make new friends out here we we make we build in bridges

5036
05:59:22,720 --> 05:59:24,720
making connections

5037
05:59:24,720 --> 05:59:31,120
Um, but you know, I care about you guys. Thank you for letting me be an honest little bunny today. Um, sorry about

5038
05:59:32,080 --> 05:59:34,080
not streaming the game as much

5039
05:59:34,640 --> 05:59:39,920
Um, but it was giving me a lot of issues. I was just on top of you guys. I'm sorry if that bothers you

5040
05:59:40,720 --> 05:59:46,560
Um, tomorrow we'll be doing the uno collab. I am uh, I'm in there

5041
05:59:46,720 --> 05:59:51,840
So we'll be having a lot of fun with the girls and very, very, very, very, very excited

5042
05:59:52,400 --> 05:59:54,800
Just trying to join with them. Um

5043
05:59:55,760 --> 05:59:57,760
I always love doing collabs with them

5044
05:59:57,760 --> 05:59:59,760
Oh, yeah

5045
06:00:12,800 --> 06:00:14,800
Okay, smell better today

5046
06:00:27,760 --> 06:00:29,760
So
