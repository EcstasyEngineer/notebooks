Thank you.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
I miss you so much.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.720
It's literally been years since I've seen you last.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
I know.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.720
I heard that you had gotten an office job girlfriend.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.720
And I blew it off like they weren't paying me enough at this office job.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.720
So I took this gig being a being a madam.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.720
I mean a hotel manager.

02:04.720 --> 02:11.720
And yeah I just like to broadcast my what I'm what I'm up to.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Lucky.

02:12.720 --> 02:17.720
I'm still in that I'm still in that really weird phase where I'm looking for that perfect

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
role.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.720
Are we all are we all still searching for that one perfect role.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.720
Absolutely.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.720
But trinkets information is in my description.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.720
If you want to go check her out please do.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.720
If you don't I will fight.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.720
Thank you all.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.720
I'm currently trying to add my background music.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.720
I feel like I should drink for this.

02:44.720 --> 02:50.720
I picked up vodka soda and a sangria.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.720
Oh OK.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.720
I didn't know.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.720
I didn't know if you'd want it that.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.720
So I haven't opened either one yet.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.720
Okay.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.720
Damn.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.720
I might have to find something to drink.

03:03.720 --> 03:09.720
I saw like a bottle of Tito's next to me but I don't want to freaking die.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.720
Tito's is like that's.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.720
Oh I know what that is at vodka.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.720
Yeah Tito's vodka.

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
Yeah.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.720
I do like mixing that with stuff.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.720
Yes.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
It's a good.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.720
I don't have anything to mix it with.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.720
I would have to just drink it straight.

03:24.720 --> 03:25.720
Oh no.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.720
That's like drinking tequila straight.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Yeah.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.720
It was I did that the other day as you know doing bunny garden and I almost died.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.720
Of course.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
Of course.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.720
Let me I'm going to put a little thing.

03:37.720 --> 03:44.720
I'm going to get a read like donuts and stuff and super chats at the end just so we can

03:44.720 --> 03:49.720
be a little focused and not ruin the flow of such things.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
Okay.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
Of course.

03:51.720 --> 03:56.720
I'm going to crack this bad boy open.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.720
Ooh.

03:59.720 --> 04:06.720
I would have I would have put it closer but I figure I'll leave I'll leave that to you.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.720
The asthma to me.

04:07.720 --> 04:13.720
I'm accidentally poor Bulbasaur around.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.720
I was like so before this out like Tom and I was like cleaning my house and I was so

04:18.720 --> 04:24.720
into like the music I was listening to and then I really had to pee and then it turned

04:24.720 --> 04:29.720
into something else and so that's why I'm a little late.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Yeah.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
She was telling me about that.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.720
What song are you listening to that really got you grooving probably.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
Probably.

04:37.720 --> 04:43.720
I was feeling a little funky by the end because I was listening to the weekend out of time

04:43.720 --> 04:48.720
but the Katronata remix and it's like very like 70s funky.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.720
So pretty pretty good.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.720
I like that a lot.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.720
Actually I've been listening to a lot of Chaperon.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.720
Oh, I need to start listening to her.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.720
I heard she's been popping off.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.720
I like her tone her sound.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.720
It sounds very retro but new.

05:05.720 --> 05:14.720
Yeah, I feel I kind of like the old retro-y sounds like I feel like the 70s 70 core pop

05:14.720 --> 05:20.720
music is really catchy and I'm just like I just want to slowly groove and shake my butt

05:20.720 --> 05:26.720
and I'm just like I know I want to insert it into my veins and just see the colors of

05:26.720 --> 05:29.720
like it's vaporwave everywhere.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.720
Like a drug.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.720
That would actually be you know pretty funky.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.720
I feel like that's just like mushrooms or LSD.

05:41.720 --> 05:46.720
Man, if only, if only.

05:48.720 --> 05:52.720
Oh, I may look a little bit different to some of you.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.720
YouTube has come for my throat.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.720
So I have to wear this cover up and I think it's pretty good.

06:00.720 --> 06:05.720
It's literally just a standard YouTube studio asset.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.720
It's a Lucy.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
Yeah.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.720
And Astrodia was just like they're really, they're really shitting on you right now.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.720
And I'm like, okay, I'll cover myself up.

06:15.720 --> 06:19.720
So that's why you'll see like alternative thumbnails that I've been editing.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.720
And that I'm hiding my boob crack.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.720
So, but yeah.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.720
You know what you could get eventually, right?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.720
What?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.720
You could just get a button up shirt and just have it pop a button.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.720
I'm kind of hoping for that.

06:34.720 --> 06:43.720
I know my manager team is talking to our rigor and artists and asked if they could like to

06:43.720 --> 06:48.720
button my shirt, but they have to do a whole new layer because the shirt is like not separated

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
to the jacket.

06:50.720 --> 06:56.720
So it's like, we'll probably have to redo my whole top half.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.720
Like I have a base though.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.720
So it's like, it shouldn't be too hard, but it's extra work.

07:00.720 --> 07:07.720
I also want to be able to toggle off and on my ropes because I look like a dominatrix 24 seven,

07:07.720 --> 07:11.720
which is like, you know, I do have my off days.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.720
I'm not, I'm not, I got to work.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.720
Not always pleasure, but you know, it's fun to mix both.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.720
Thank you for the rage, Johnny.

07:17.720 --> 07:18.720
Hello.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.720
Hello, I was just talking about you.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.720
Do you like my cover up?

07:24.720 --> 07:26.720
Hello, Mrs. Shibby's mom.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.720
Hi.

07:27.720 --> 07:33.720
I feel this feels like I'm having a friend over for like a play date.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.720
And then Johnny's like check poking her head into the room like, how are you guys doing?

07:37.720 --> 07:41.720
And we're just like making our dolls like make out or something.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.720
Can I get Johnny snacks?

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
We are the snacks.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
We are the snack.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.720
You look, you look so fine today.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.720
Can we just talk about this?

07:51.720 --> 07:54.720
My uncle Minky really cooked an outfit.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.720
Yeah.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.720
Like this, uh, I can't stop staring at the tummy.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.720
It's sex.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.720
Oh, it reminds me of a certain someone.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
I just can't put my finger on it.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.720
But you know, it's an homage to like an old friend of mine.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.720
Yeah.

08:13.720 --> 08:14.720
I think it's really gorgeous.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.720
Very like slave Leia-esque.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.720
May she rest in piss wherever she is.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.720
I know.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.720
She'd definitely be rested in piss.

08:22.720 --> 08:27.720
I, I, I, I 100% believe that.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.720
Um, Shibby with an naval piercing.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.720
When that actually be kind of cute.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.720
I do like yours.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.720
Trinket yours.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.720
You're just pretty nice.

08:34.720 --> 08:35.720
Thank you.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.720
Usually it's a bone, but like, you know, diamonds are girls friends.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.720
That's right.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
That's true.

08:40.720 --> 08:47.720
Oh, so well with your hair, like all the, all the, all the trinkets in your hair.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.720
That's cause I'm a star, baby.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.720
She's a star.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.720
See her name up at lights.

08:54.720 --> 08:59.720
Um, can you tell us about some of the work that you've done as a star trinket?

08:59.720 --> 09:00.720
Oh man.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.720
I have taken a group on walkies.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.720
Oh.

09:06.720 --> 09:14.720
And I have done monologue readings for multiple productions.

09:14.720 --> 09:20.720
I haven't landed a lead yet, but I'm hoping, I'm hoping fingers crossed.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.720
You know, I bet you'll get a lead soon.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.720
100%.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
Oh, absolutely.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.720
And I don't mean the leash that I usually carry, but you know.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.720
Oh, I have a hold on.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.720
I think I, I think I have a leash on me.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
Oh, no, that's not the leash.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.720
That's all right.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.720
There it is.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.720
I got it.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.720
There it is.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.720
So, oh, maybe I should take my, like, you have to teach me about like walkies and stuff.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.720
I haven't taken them for walkies.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.720
I usually just sit in their cage, um, my harem.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.720
So you got, you got it.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.720
You got to let them stretch their legs sometimes.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.720
That's a good point.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.720
Oh, I've been a bad madam.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.720
I'll have to take them for walkies.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.720
Maybe next time.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.720
Oh, they'll love it.

09:57.720 --> 10:03.720
Or maybe we can take them together at the, towards the end of this.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.720
Cause it looks like they're into either walkies or steppies.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.720
Yeah.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.720
Like maybe we can walkies and steppies.

10:10.720 --> 10:17.720
I can, you know, we'll split them into two groups and divide and conquer.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.720
Four feet for the price of two.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.720
That's, hey, that's pretty good.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.720
That's a deal.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.720
You haven't been neglected.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.720
You haven't been neglected shop.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.720
I feed you.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.720
You have a nice crate.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.720
I leave the lights on for you when I leave my house.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.720
You're fine.

10:35.720 --> 10:39.720
That's so kind of you, especially in this economy.

10:39.720 --> 10:40.720
Yeah.

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
That light bill.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
Yeah, exactly.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.720
And I have air conditioning.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.720
So you're not dying, you know, it's hot.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
It was like 95 today in my area.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.720
Oh, that's not so bad.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.720
You guys are probably in a brisk 75 degree house.

10:53.720 --> 11:00.720
Actually, according to my thermostat, it is a 70 a nice cool 70.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.720
And then I, and then they can hang with my cat sometimes.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.720
So.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.720
Me and my fans air conditioning doesn't get down that low.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.720
I, I can't even change it.

11:10.720 --> 11:17.720
Like it like, uh, I don't know if it's like my landlords like determine for the entire

11:17.720 --> 11:20.720
thing, but it's like locked and I, I can't change it.

11:20.720 --> 11:26.720
I can only make it go cold or hot or turn it off.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.720
It's 72 cold.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.720
Oh, why is she be censored?

11:32.720 --> 11:35.720
Oh, the other is trinket.

11:35.720 --> 11:36.720
Get it right.

11:36.720 --> 11:40.720
That's because I don't have the same assets as madam shabby.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.720
Yeah.

11:41.720 --> 11:42.720
Smaller.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.720
Yeah.

11:43.720 --> 11:50.720
Um, just like I see an Emmy, uh, the AI for YouTube does not pick up, uh, whoa chests.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.720
So trinkets fine.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.720
Trinket's like full Tom, she's good.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.720
Yeah.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.720
Tommy is totally allowed.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.720
Yeah.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.720
And then like, hold on.

12:01.720 --> 12:02.720
Let me show off.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.720
Like I kind of have you a little bit down, but like, look at her.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
She's like, look how cute she is.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.720
The little tail.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.720
Wait, say something so you light up.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.720
I am trinket.

12:13.720 --> 12:14.720
Hi.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.720
Hi.

12:15.720 --> 12:21.720
You know, I, for the first time you showed me this, I glanced for a second because

12:21.720 --> 12:25.720
I thought you had a, a razor on the headdress.

12:25.720 --> 12:29.720
And I was like, that's hardcore.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.720
Man, I wish.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.720
Wish a, wish a bitch would.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.720
She will cut a bitch.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.720
Do not fuck with her, everybody.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.720
She will cut you.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.720
I will cry.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.720
One of us will.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.720
I will.

12:45.720 --> 12:46.720
Yeah.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.720
I'll watch.

12:47.720 --> 12:48.720
I'll watch you guys.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
Am I cut?

12:49.720 --> 12:50.720
Wait, hold on.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.720
If she, you're doing the cutting on the bitches and I'm watching, does that make me a cook?

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
Am I sitting in the.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.720
No, no, you would never sit in the cut chair.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.720
You would be front and center.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.720
Okay.

13:01.720 --> 13:02.720
Yes.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.720
I'll be, I'll be like directing.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.720
I'll feel, I feel better about that.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
Yeah.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.720
Everybody's got to have a manager.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.720
Exactly.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.720
I take direction.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.720
Well, do you now?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.720
Of course.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.720
I will, I won't, I'm not going to test that.

13:23.720 --> 13:31.720
I'm just going to believe you just so we can keep this YouTube TOS friendly.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.720
Oh, okay.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.720
So do you want to, do you want to get into this?

13:35.720 --> 13:36.720
Of course.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
Let's start with this plant.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
Okay.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
This plant.

13:39.720 --> 13:47.720
I, if I recall, I think the person you hung out with before that you kind of modeled your

13:47.720 --> 13:50.720
character wherever she is.

13:50.720 --> 13:58.720
Didn't you guys do like, like baby or like eat or Rob as well as smash or pass?

13:58.720 --> 14:00.720
Was that, was that a thing?

14:00.720 --> 14:01.720
Yeah.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
Yeah.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.720
We did, we did include others because some of them you can't smash because like clearly

14:05.720 --> 14:06.720
they're babies.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.720
Yeah.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.720
But some of them do look delectable.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.720
Yeah.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.720
Like you could just, you could just eat them.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.720
Like this one looks like a straight up onion.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.720
Yeah.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.720
I would probably eat this one, but I wouldn't smash it.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.720
I would, I would eat it.

14:18.720 --> 14:24.720
100% would consume this, this little, this little cabbage onion.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.720
I would let him live.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.720
He can, he can, he can just go on about his way.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.720
Okay.

14:29.720 --> 14:30.720
All right.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.720
Understandable.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.720
Um, which so, are you also a pass?

14:35.720 --> 14:36.720
I'm going to pass.

14:36.720 --> 14:37.720
You're going to pass.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.720
Okay.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.720
I guess I'm just, I'm hand-able lecturing everything.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.720
Although not that I'm a, all the sort, but.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.720
Well, to be fair, I don't, I don't like vegetables.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.720
So.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
Oh, I'm a, I'm a huge vegetable fan.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.720
So.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.720
Oh, well you are, you are a rabbit, my dear.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.720
That's a good point.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.720
I didn't notice.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.720
Um, I'm going to pass an Ivy store.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.720
I feel like I would get poison Ivy if I tried to eat it.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
So.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
He's too cute.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
His fangs are too cute.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.720
That's a pass for me.

15:07.720 --> 15:08.720
Yeah.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.720
That's a pass.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.720
I just got scared by my own, um, slipper.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.720
I thought, oh my God, I thought something was touching my foot.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.720
And I'm like, wait, this isn't one of the cats.

15:16.720 --> 15:17.720
And I just freaked out a little bit.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.720
Okay.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.720
Anyways, moving on.

15:19.720 --> 15:20.720
Um.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.720
Can I say something about Venusaur?

15:22.720 --> 15:23.720
Go off.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.720
Say, say your truth.

15:24.720 --> 15:29.720
I feel like he's the fat, ugly bastard of more like Pokemon.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
Oh my God.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
You're right.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.720
He is.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.720
Holy crap.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.720
But like he would crush you if he got on top.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.720
Oh yeah.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.720
That would be, that would be pretty tough.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.720
Getting mounted by that thing.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.720
I'm good.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.720
I'm good.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.720
Again, I think I'd like contract some sort of allergy.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.720
So.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.720
Get some pollen in your eye.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.720
Yeah.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.720
Start sneezing.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.720
I just don't even want to go through that.

15:55.720 --> 15:59.720
I don't, I don't want to pollinate with this, this Venusaur.

15:59.720 --> 16:04.720
And then there's the, the mega, which is a cuter version.

16:04.720 --> 16:05.720
Yeah.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.720
He's got some height to him.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.720
Yeah.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.720
But he's gonna be as heavy as hell.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
Yeah.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.720
I wish they like gave information about their like heights and weights.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.720
That would be, that'd be pretty good.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.720
This is terrifying.

16:19.720 --> 16:25.720
The, the Gigantamax one.

16:25.720 --> 16:33.720
I'm, I'm, you know, I'm slightly enticed by the, the little vines, but I'm going to

16:33.720 --> 16:36.720
say no to words vine whip.

16:36.720 --> 16:43.720
I'm, I'm looking at his face and he's just looking like, you know.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.720
Yeah.

16:44.720 --> 16:48.720
I feel like I'm going to get taken advantage of.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.720
Yeah.

16:49.720 --> 16:50.720
Okay.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.720
I'm going to say this right now.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.720
Should I put a disclaimer in my chat?

16:53.720 --> 16:57.720
We are going to say some very out of pocket things.

16:57.720 --> 17:08.720
So if you are a fan of two cute girls, uh, talking about smashing, eating, robbing

17:08.720 --> 17:14.720
or passing on Pokemon, um, then I don't, I don't.

17:14.720 --> 17:18.720
I will say something about like the, the Venusaur mega.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.720
I'm going to steal that flower off his head.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.720
Oh, I don't care if I have to rip it off.

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
I'm going to take that.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.720
That's, yeah.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.720
Yeah.

17:25.720 --> 17:26.720
Yeah.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
He's, he's got a cute flower.

17:27.720 --> 17:28.720
I'm going to pick it.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.720
Oh wait.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.720
Are you still on the last one?

17:30.720 --> 17:31.720
No, I'm not.

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
I'm on Charmander.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
Oh, okay.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.720
You're a child.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.720
Okay.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
Let me get Charmander.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.720
Oh, that's a baby.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.720
So that's it.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.720
That's it.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.720
That's it.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.720
That's an eatable creature.

17:41.720 --> 17:42.720
That is pure meat right there.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.720
You're going to eat Charmander?

17:43.720 --> 17:44.720
Yeah.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.720
Yeah.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.720
I bet it tastes like jerky, like spicy jerky.

17:47.720 --> 17:51.720
The only problem is he'd probably be well done because he's always cooking.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
That's a good point.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.720
I like my, I like my meat kind of rare.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
So it's a little bit pink.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
I like it rare.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
Yeah.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.720
Yeah.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.720
You know what?

18:00.720 --> 18:01.720
No, I wouldn't eat him.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.720
Just, just for the fact that he might be well done.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.720
Yeah.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
Okay.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.400
Oh, maybe because he's younger, he wouldn't be, it's like, like a veal.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.720
So make them might be a little bit more rare.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.720
I don't know.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.720
I don't know.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.720
Like maybe if I could cut off the tail and like sample him, you think?

18:15.720 --> 18:16.720
Yeah.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.720
That would just kill the whole thing.

18:18.720 --> 18:19.720
Yeah.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.720
Hmm.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
Yeah.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.720
You might, you'd have to like eat the whole thing.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.720
You can't just like, just eat the tail.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.720
That's true.

18:26.720 --> 18:30.720
And then like, there's the war that when his tail goes out, he dies.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.720
Yeah.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.720
Yeah.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.720
But like, if you cut it off and it doesn't go out, he could probably stay alive.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
Oh, that's it.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.720
You know, there's a, like, has anybody experimented with that cut?

18:39.720 --> 18:41.720
Just cutting off Charmander's tail.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.720
So fucked.

18:43.720 --> 18:48.720
I don't think Game Freaks made the cooking Pokemon yet.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.720
Yeah.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.720
I have seen like an animation of somebody like chop it up.

18:52.720 --> 18:58.720
Oh, I got a tweet that I'm alive.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.720
Thank you for the reminder.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.720
Oh, I have to retweet when you tweet that you're alive.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.720
I always forget to tweet that I'm alive.

19:05.720 --> 19:06.720
Okay.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.720
Let me just pass the hardest thing because you just want to go and hit the ground.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.720
Run it.

19:11.720 --> 19:16.720
I literally, I just, and I can't like schedule tweets either because how I am.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.720
You can't put links and schedule tweets.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.720
And you never know if you're going to want a gorilla.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
Exactly.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.720
Sometimes I want to stream earlier.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.720
Sometimes I, you know, have to use the bathroom.

19:27.720 --> 19:32.720
So I run a couple minutes behind, you know, if you like that sometimes.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.720
Got to keep them on their toes.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.720
Never let them get your next move.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.720
Exactly.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.720
So I'm on Charmillion.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.720
I'm going to type up my tweet and you can chat about your opinion.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.720
Okay.

19:45.720 --> 19:51.720
So for me, I think I, I think this will be my first smash because he's got them big, strong

19:51.720 --> 19:52.720
arms.

19:52.720 --> 19:57.720
And plus like, if you were to sit on his head, you could write his head cause he's got the

19:57.720 --> 19:58.720
appendage up there too.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.720
You're not wrong.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.720
You're not wrong.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.720
Not an eye.

20:05.720 --> 20:11.720
I'm partially swayed by that, but he kind of just looks like he wouldn't like, he just

20:11.720 --> 20:16.720
like, not like hitting and quit it, but he'd like just, he would complete you.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.720
Yeah.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.720
He wouldn't call me.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.720
He would complete.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.720
And then like, he just roll over and be like, so did you come?

20:23.720 --> 20:27.720
And I'm just like, I'm not really, he just has that expression.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.720
Yeah.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.720
He looks cocky.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.720
Like ain't not the best thing.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.720
Yeah.

20:32.720 --> 20:38.720
But even then, like, even if he did finish, like you could get off on your own.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.720
He's got extra bits that stay hard forever.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
That's a good point.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.720
That's a good point.

20:44.720 --> 20:48.720
I'm wondering where he puts like, where's, where would, where it's going to come from.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.720
But you know what I mean?

20:49.720 --> 20:52.720
I'm going to pass and you're going to smash, right?

20:52.720 --> 20:54.720
Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to smash.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.720
I feel like I should have had a counter, but it's fine.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.720
I think it does it at the bottom, doesn't it?

21:00.720 --> 21:02.720
I don't know.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.720
It does.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.720
It'll, it'll, it'll put a green box around the ones that you say smashed to.

21:07.720 --> 21:08.720
Oh, okay.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.720
I just haven't smashed anything yet, so that makes sense.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.720
But that might change with the next one.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.720
That's a good point.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.720
Cause we got Charizard.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.720
I am smashing the dragon.

21:19.720 --> 21:20.720
Thank you.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.720
I mean, I mean, he's our first short king.

21:23.720 --> 21:24.720
He's a short king?

21:24.720 --> 21:26.720
I thought he's a dragon.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.720
I know he's a dragon, but Charizard's like canonical height is very short.

21:31.720 --> 21:32.720
Is it really?

21:32.720 --> 21:33.720
I didn't know that.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.720
You know, I don't, I don't.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.720
He's five, he's five seven.

21:37.720 --> 21:42.720
Charizard's only five seven?

21:42.720 --> 21:44.720
Yeah, he's only five seven.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.720
You know, I don't mind that cause that's like, that's literally just like an inch taller than me.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.720
So we could be like eye to eye.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.720
That's like perfect height.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.720
Absolutely.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
Yeah.

21:53.720 --> 21:57.720
Five seven eight that short.

21:57.720 --> 22:03.720
People, people, you feel like it's for a dragon.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.720
Calm down everybody for a dragon.

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
For a dragon.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
It's kind of small.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.720
It's kind of small for a dragon.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.720
Just, yeah, just for a dragon.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.720
Also, you guys could totally do it while airborne.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
So yeah.

22:15.720 --> 22:16.720
He's a total smash.

22:16.720 --> 22:17.720
Yeah.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.720
I'm, I'm, I'm smashing the dragon.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.720
Um, Charizard's mega.

22:23.720 --> 22:24.720
Those baby arms.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.720
Those baby arms.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.720
Yeah.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.720
I don't like them.

22:27.720 --> 22:33.720
I feel like I would get hurt by the little, the double wings.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.720
Yeah.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.720
Like, like slapping would be nice.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.720
But like, I don't, I don't know.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.720
It's not feeling that, you know.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.720
And then like the spikes on top of his head is totally unusable now.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.720
Yeah.

22:45.720 --> 22:50.720
I can't do anything with that.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.720
I think it's a, I think it's a pass.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.720
Yeah.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.720
For the Y.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.720
However.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.720
However.

22:57.720 --> 23:02.720
I'm kind of feeling Charizard mega X.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.720
I just like the color palette a lot.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.720
He's also got built-in handlebars that aren't his hip.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.720
That's a good point.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.720
Maybe he's into pegging.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.720
Maybe he, you know, be pretty cool.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.720
I'm going to, I'm going to smash.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.720
I'm going to smash that.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.720
Same.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.720
Um, no, I, no, put him, put him out, put him out.

23:22.720 --> 23:26.720
I would just be on fire and he would just sit on me and kill me.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.720
So.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.720
Yeah.

23:29.720 --> 23:32.720
He's doing, he's doing too much.

23:32.720 --> 23:33.720
Yeah.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.720
He just seems like he's, he's just like, yeah.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.720
He's just trying too much.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.720
Like he's like compensating for something, you know.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.720
Although I do like his womb tattoo.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.720
His.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.720
Wait.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.720
He has a womb tattoo.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.720
Oh my gosh.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.720
He does notice that.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.720
That's pretty, that's pretty cute.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.720
Um, okay.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.720
This is a baby.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.720
That is a baby.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.720
I, I can't eat it because it's too baby.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
Yeah.

24:03.720 --> 24:08.720
I like, I also, Squirtle has a soft spot in my heart because they were my starter.

24:08.720 --> 24:15.720
And I, like, when I first played fire red and I named him Squirt, not understanding

24:15.720 --> 24:16.720
the connotation.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.720
Um, so I'm, I have to pass.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.720
I would, I would lovingly cherish Squirtle.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.720
Squirt could mean a lot of things though.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.720
Like he's a small fry.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.720
He's a little guy.

24:27.720 --> 24:28.720
He gets a squirt.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.720
Exactly.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.720
That's why I call him Squirt.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.720
And it's like, you know, I'm a kid.

24:32.720 --> 24:38.720
So I'm not that like smart when it comes to naming things because it's fucking in his

24:38.720 --> 24:39.720
name.

24:39.720 --> 24:40.720
Of course.

24:40.720 --> 24:41.720
Squirt has fainted.

24:41.720 --> 24:42.720
He is a friend shaped little guy.

24:42.720 --> 24:43.720
I love him.

24:43.720 --> 24:48.720
And then when he was blast toys, he was called Squirt.

24:48.720 --> 24:53.720
I mean, to be fair, you're not wrong.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.720
That water pressure though.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.720
Uh, let's, I'm just going to pass.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.720
Um, war total.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.720
Oh, that's a smash for me.

25:02.720 --> 25:03.720
That's a smash for you.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.720
Yeah.

25:04.720 --> 25:09.720
Again, I've always liked the way that war total looks, especially his fluffy tail.

25:09.720 --> 25:10.720
Yeah.

25:10.720 --> 25:11.720
He does have a cute tail.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.720
Very cute tail.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.720
And like his, I always liked his little like ear wing things, whatever that is.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.720
Um, I wouldn't smash him though.

25:19.720 --> 25:25.720
He just looks like, again, like a shitty, annoying teenager that like, I would probably

25:25.720 --> 25:29.720
have to teach to do things to, so that I could complete.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.720
So I don't know.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.720
I think he could, I think he could figure it out.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.720
He's got that, he's got that ginky anime protagonist.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.720
Let's need some goggles on him.

25:39.720 --> 25:40.720
And he's like a Digimon protagonist.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.720
That's, that's a good point.

25:42.720 --> 25:43.720
That's a good point.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.720
Um, I am going to pass.

25:46.720 --> 25:50.720
So, and then you got Blastoise.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.720
I'm going to smash Blastoise.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.720
Uh, this one's hard.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.720
Yeah.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
He's very handsome though.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.720
Like he's a barra handsome.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.720
Yeah.

26:01.720 --> 26:08.720
And then again, like I mentioned the water pressure and I don't, I think I would like the sensation

26:08.720 --> 26:12.720
of those, his like little claws gripping me, you know.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.720
Also, I bet he's just really smooth.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.720
I like that expression.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.720
He's like, you know, like, he knows what he's doing.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.720
He knows his way around.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.720
Yeah.

26:24.720 --> 26:25.720
He's a veteran.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.720
Yeah.

26:26.720 --> 26:30.720
Uh, and this is like his weird brother.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.720
Yeah.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.720
No, he's right off.

26:33.720 --> 26:34.720
Oh, good.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.720
And I'm not going.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.720
I'm not going.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.720
And that's a tank.

26:37.720 --> 26:43.720
Um, I'm good with the gig, the Gigantamax 22.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.720
Yeah.

26:44.720 --> 26:45.720
That's a no for me.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.720
He's only five feet tall.

26:47.720 --> 26:48.720
That's fine.

26:48.720 --> 26:49.720
That's okay.

26:49.720 --> 26:50.720
I don't mind a short king.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.720
Yeah.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.720
We established that with Charizard.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.720
Yeah.

26:54.720 --> 26:59.720
I like, you know, they, they, they, they try a little bit harder because they know they're

26:59.720 --> 27:00.720
not as tall.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.720
It's never really mattered to me how tall you are, but like, I get it can be a soft spot

27:04.720 --> 27:06.720
for some dudes, you know.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.720
Yeah.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.720
Especially if it's not fair and you're wearing heels all the time.

27:10.720 --> 27:11.720
Yeah.

27:11.720 --> 27:17.120
I still don't know my height without my heels because I'm 168 centimeters with heels and

27:17.120 --> 27:18.720
I don't know how tall my heels are.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.720
So I have to ask my mom.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.720
Yeah.

27:21.720 --> 27:22.720
Okay.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.720
Hmm.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.720
This is a caterpillar.

27:25.720 --> 27:36.160
Well, yeah, but he's got one of those mouths that look like those sectiony toys.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.720
Is that a mouth?

27:37.720 --> 27:38.720
Yeah.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.720
Does that open?

27:39.720 --> 27:44.720
I mean, I just kind of assumed that it was like a hole in his face, you know.

27:44.720 --> 27:52.720
And, you know, I feel like he could crawl up in there and just like do his thing.

27:52.720 --> 27:53.720
Yeah.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.720
And then he just come right back out.

27:55.720 --> 27:56.720
Yeah.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.720
You know what?

27:57.720 --> 27:58.720
Yeah.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.720
I'll do it.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.720
I'm, I'm, I'll try new things.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.720
Yeah.

28:02.720 --> 28:07.720
I mean, bondage fairies walk so we could run.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.720
Exactly.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.720
All right.

28:09.720 --> 28:10.720
I'm going to smash.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.720
Metapod.

28:11.720 --> 28:12.720
Again.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.720
Harden.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.720
It's a given.

28:14.720 --> 28:15.720
It's a given.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.720
It's a given.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.720
I'm sorry.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.720
I'm smashing.

28:18.720 --> 28:19.720
I'm smashing metapod.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.720
It's testing your limit.

28:21.720 --> 28:22.720
Exactly.

28:22.720 --> 28:28.720
And then like, look at all those ridges and edges like, come on, he's ripped for your

28:28.720 --> 28:29.720
pleasure.

28:29.720 --> 28:30.720
Exactly.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.720
That was so good.

28:33.720 --> 28:37.720
Oh my God.

28:38.720 --> 28:43.720
Um, that's a bug.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.720
The other ones were bugs, but this is different.

28:45.720 --> 28:46.720
It's a butterfly.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.720
This one's a little too delicate.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.720
You get those wings wet and it's over for you.

28:51.720 --> 28:52.720
Yeah.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.720
Like, what if I'm feeling extra, you know, spicy that day?

28:55.720 --> 28:57.720
I make a mess.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.720
Like what's, what's going to happen to butterfree?

28:59.720 --> 29:01.720
What's going to happen?

29:01.720 --> 29:03.720
That's what's going to happen.

29:03.720 --> 29:07.720
It's going to disintegrate in my shoes.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.720
The pH acid.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.720
Jesus fuck.

29:13.720 --> 29:17.720
That's a horrible image.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.720
Uh, I don't care, but it just has bigger wings.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.720
That doesn't really make a difference to me.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.720
Um, beetle.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.720
Okay.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.720
So this, this, this one, I'm a little torn on because I want the same.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.720
Yeah.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.720
But on the other, like a horn.

29:35.720 --> 29:36.720
Yeah.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.720
I'm like, I'm like, oh, maybe if I'm feeling a little adventurous,

29:38.720 --> 29:40.720
cause like reminds me of beads.

29:40.720 --> 29:41.720
Um,

29:41.720 --> 29:43.720
Like you could grind on it, maybe.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.720
Yeah.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.720
Yeah.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.720
Can use that as a grinder.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.720
Like his little, his little sections part.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.720
You got to be brave.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.720
I don't know.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.720
I don't think I'm that brave.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.720
Yeah.

29:57.720 --> 30:01.720
I just feel like my cervix would just be destroyed.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.720
If I try to sit on his head.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.720
Uh, and I feel like I would struggle,

30:05.720 --> 30:07.720
like I would probably just crush him.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.720
If I tried to grind on him.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.720
So I'm going to say pass just for our,

30:12.720 --> 30:13.720
both of our safety.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.720
You know.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.720
Yeah.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.720
I'm going to pass on this one.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.720
Pass on Weedle.

30:17.720 --> 30:18.720
Cocuna.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.720
Cocuna.

30:19.720 --> 30:20.720
Same thing as Metapod though.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.720
Going up my ass.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.720
Expeditiously.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.720
I mean, if you, if you turn them upside down,

30:26.720 --> 30:27.720
he's got a flared base.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.720
So I can see where you're coming from.

30:29.720 --> 30:30.720
Yeah.

30:30.720 --> 30:31.720
Yeah.

30:31.720 --> 30:32.720
Exactly.

30:32.720 --> 30:33.720
Exactly.

30:33.720 --> 30:34.720
You understand me.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.720
You understand me.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.720
I see you and you're so valid.

30:37.720 --> 30:38.720
Thank you.

30:38.720 --> 30:39.720
Thank you.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.720
Okay.

30:40.720 --> 30:41.720
Smash B drill.

30:41.720 --> 30:42.720
Okay.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.720
He's already got it built in and on display.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.720
I know it's like pointier,

30:47.720 --> 30:49.720
but there's like something like,

30:49.720 --> 30:50.720
like Weedle and stuff,

30:50.720 --> 30:52.720
but like, I don't know.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.720
There's just something about B drill that just like draws me to him.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.720
I don't know.

30:57.720 --> 30:58.720
I don't like bees.

30:58.720 --> 30:59.720
That's true.

30:59.720 --> 31:03.720
Like what it, is it going to sting me?

31:03.720 --> 31:06.720
He's going to be an asshole the whole time.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.720
Like you're not threatening him,

31:08.720 --> 31:10.720
but he's going to be like sting, sting, sting,

31:10.720 --> 31:12.720
plays it, sting, sting, sting.

31:12.720 --> 31:13.720
Yeah.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.720
Or just like just kind of like buzzing around,

31:15.720 --> 31:17.720
like just like kind of being pastry.

31:17.720 --> 31:18.720
Yeah.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.720
Actually I'm going to pass.

31:19.720 --> 31:20.720
I'm going to pass.

31:20.720 --> 31:21.720
Me too.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.720
Reminder.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.720
This is Markiplier's first smash.

31:24.720 --> 31:25.720
That's right.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.720
He did smash B drill.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.720
Well, that's because it's black and yellow,

31:29.720 --> 31:31.720
and though they're two sexy color combination.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.720
They are.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.720
They are.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.720
B drill mega would kill me.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.720
Like I like a little bit of pain.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.720
There's five spikes on this bucket.

31:44.720 --> 31:45.720
I know.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.720
And like that could like, you know,

31:47.720 --> 31:50.720
impale all points of me,

31:50.720 --> 31:54.720
but like usually I'm the one dishing it out.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.720
So I'm going to say pass.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.720
I still don't like bees.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
Okay.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.720
Pidgey, this is a bird.

32:05.720 --> 32:06.720
I'm not smashing a bird.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.720
I'm going to eat this.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.720
You're going to eat.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.720
Yeah.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.720
I'll eat the bird.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.720
I'll eat.

32:12.720 --> 32:13.720
Yeah.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.720
Cause like all these birds have cloacas.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.720
Well, the cloaca doesn't turn me off.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.720
Right.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.720
It's the fact that it's a bird.

32:27.720 --> 32:28.720
I don't really,

32:28.720 --> 32:30.720
I can't recall what a cloaca looks like.

32:30.720 --> 32:34.720
So can it like come out of it?

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
The bird?

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
Like, or do they,

32:36.720 --> 32:37.720
don't they just like put their butts together?

32:37.720 --> 32:38.720
Right.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.720
I think it's like a sort of suction cup sort of thing for some,

32:42.720 --> 32:44.720
except for like ducks who have the corkscrew.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.720
Yeah.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.720
The corkscrew pee pee and the corkscrew vagina.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.720
Oh, well it's like a maze vagina.

32:51.720 --> 32:52.720
Like a, yeah.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.720
Cause they have like other, other.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.720
Yeah.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.720
I remember reading about that for some odd reason.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.720
I'm not,

32:58.720 --> 32:59.720
I'm going to eat the bird.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.720
So pass.

33:00.720 --> 33:01.720
Yeah.

33:01.720 --> 33:02.720
Yeah.

33:02.720 --> 33:03.720
We're going to,

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
we're going to eat that bird.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
See this is a good meal.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.720
That's a good meal right there.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.720
That's a,

33:08.720 --> 33:09.720
that could feed a family of three.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.720
The Pidgeotto.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.720
Yeah.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.720
Yeah.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.720
But then you were like talking about suction.

33:15.720 --> 33:20.720
So like now I'm debating whether or not I want to fuck the birds.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.720
I'm a fan of suction.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.720
I'm not going to though.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
I'm going to,

33:26.720 --> 33:29.720
I'm not even going to eat that because I just feel like,

33:29.720 --> 33:30.720
like preparing this,

33:30.720 --> 33:35.720
like processing this bird would just like be such an annoyance.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.720
Yeah.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.720
I mean,

33:37.720 --> 33:39.720
I didn't say I would prep it.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.720
I'd probably catch it and give it to some like Pokemon chef.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.720
Oh,

33:43.720 --> 33:44.720
that's a good point.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.720
Okay.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.720
Cause I can't cook.

33:46.720 --> 33:51.720
I have to cook you a meal sometime then drink it.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.720
I'm going to pass on the verb.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.720
Me too.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.720
And then same for Pidgeot,

33:57.720 --> 33:59.720
it's just longer hair.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.720
I don't,

34:00.720 --> 34:04.720
she's getting that anime protagonist hair.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.720
Yeah.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.720
And the same thing with Pidgeot mega,

34:06.720 --> 34:09.720
it's even more so anime protagonist hair.

34:09.720 --> 34:11.720
It's just like,

34:11.720 --> 34:14.720
it's like an honestly gorgeous bird.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.720
I would pass.

34:16.720 --> 34:17.720
I would spare its life.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.720
I also wouldn't eat it.

34:18.720 --> 34:19.720
So,

34:19.720 --> 34:20.720
yeah,

34:20.720 --> 34:22.720
I'd want to see him flying free.

34:22.720 --> 34:23.720
Why is the bird five feet?

34:23.720 --> 34:24.720
What the heck?

34:24.720 --> 34:25.720
That's so weird.

34:25.720 --> 34:26.720
Because you can ride him,

34:26.720 --> 34:27.720
but not in that way.

34:27.720 --> 34:28.720
Oh,

34:28.720 --> 34:29.720
that's a good point.

34:29.720 --> 34:30.720
You know,

34:30.720 --> 34:33.720
I let him take me on a date so I could just like fly around on him.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.720
That'd be fun.

34:35.720 --> 34:36.720
Um,

34:36.720 --> 34:37.720
ratatata,

34:37.720 --> 34:38.720
ratatata,

34:38.720 --> 34:39.720
ratatata.

34:39.720 --> 34:40.720
Um,

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
that's a,

34:41.720 --> 34:42.720
that's a rat.

34:42.720 --> 34:43.720
Um,

34:43.720 --> 34:44.720
I pet him.

34:44.720 --> 34:45.720
Yeah.

34:45.720 --> 34:46.720
I'd snuggle him.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.720
Um,

34:47.720 --> 34:49.720
I don't think we could have coitus.

34:49.720 --> 34:50.720
However,

34:50.720 --> 34:51.720
uh,

34:51.720 --> 34:53.720
I would probably kill him.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.720
So I'm going to say pass.

34:55.720 --> 34:56.720
Yeah,

34:56.720 --> 34:57.720
he's baby.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.720
Yeah,

34:58.720 --> 34:59.720
that's a baby would not hurt the baby.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.720
Yeah.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.720
That's a baby with a mustache.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.720
What's that?

35:02.720 --> 35:03.720
A baby with a mustache.

35:03.720 --> 35:04.720
That's a baby with a job.

35:04.720 --> 35:05.720
No,

35:05.720 --> 35:06.720
thank you.

35:06.720 --> 35:07.720
I just,

35:08.720 --> 35:11.720
I just feel like he has like a really thick,

35:11.720 --> 35:12.720
like,

35:12.720 --> 35:13.720
a New York accent.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.720
Like,

35:14.720 --> 35:15.720
ah,

35:15.720 --> 35:16.720
I need to get to my appointment.

35:16.720 --> 35:17.720
Okay.

35:17.720 --> 35:18.720
Get out of my way.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.720
I'm walking.

35:19.720 --> 35:20.720
I'm walking.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.720
Yeah.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.720
I'm trying.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.720
I'm going to be late.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.720
I'm supposed to see my,

35:24.720 --> 35:26.720
my grandmother after this for some spaghetti

35:26.720 --> 35:31.720
at her family restaurant.

35:31.720 --> 35:32.720
You know,

35:32.720 --> 35:33.720
I've had a very masterful,

35:33.720 --> 35:34.720
as a kid,

35:34.720 --> 35:35.720
oh,

35:35.720 --> 35:36.720
this is,

35:36.720 --> 35:43.720
He does. He does. He does have that feel. He does. He just needs a hat.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.720
He just needs a hat. Just like a little, like a fedora, bowler hat.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.720
Um, pass.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.720
My brother Tony says.

35:51.720 --> 35:57.720
And if you don't pay up, we're gonna have problems now.

35:57.720 --> 36:06.720
Okay, eradicate. Um, I'm kind of scared to eradicate.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.720
I feel like it would bite my clothes.

36:08.720 --> 36:13.720
I mean, I don't think I would let his face to be downstairs.

36:13.720 --> 36:18.720
Is it the tail you maybe might use?

36:18.720 --> 36:22.720
You know, I don't think I would. I don't think I'd use this rat at all.

36:22.720 --> 36:26.720
I think it's just a straight up pass.

36:26.720 --> 36:31.720
What if he's hungry and eating?

36:31.720 --> 36:35.720
I thought they accidentally sent a smash.

36:35.720 --> 36:39.720
You can click on it in the bottom.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.720
Yeah, there you go.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.720
Oh my God.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.720
I don't know what we got so far.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.720
The rats, the rats are just a.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.720
Yeah, the rats. I'm good.

36:52.720 --> 36:55.720
And we're back to another eating line.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.720
I'm telling you.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.720
Tony.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.720
Yeah, I'm eating this. I'm eating this bird.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.720
He looks delightfully.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.720
So good.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.720
Those legs, like I don't, like I've never had chicken feet before,

37:09.720 --> 37:11.720
but those look like really tasty feet.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.720
Oh, like you would eat those pickled.

37:14.720 --> 37:18.720
Yeah, 100% are like fried up crispy.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.720
Yeah, you can't lie.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.720
Are you the big cheese rat?

37:23.720 --> 37:25.720
Mr. Bombastic.

37:25.720 --> 37:26.720
Mr. Love a lover.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.720
Actually, I do. Yeah, he's pretty cool.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.720
Oh, are you going to say I'm sorry?

37:30.720 --> 37:33.720
I like the biggest rat.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.720
Small rat hate.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.720
Okay, I'm passing on Spiro.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.720
Spiro looks like an asshole.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.720
Again, I'm just scared of his beak.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.720
I feel like I would be impaled.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.720
So I'm good. I don't even want to eat it.

37:51.720 --> 37:55.720
I just feel like it would be really not tasty meat.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.720
Because it's so full of fear.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.720
You know how like fear can spoil a meat.

37:59.720 --> 38:03.720
Can fear spoil a meat or does it make it the most electable?

38:03.720 --> 38:05.720
Wow.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
Hmm. That's it. That's the question.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.720
That's the question of the century.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.720
But then again, I guess happy cows make for happier steaks.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.720
So it can drill.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.720
Okay, we also people are wanting us to take into consideration

38:18.720 --> 38:23.720
their their move sets because this has drill pick.

38:23.720 --> 38:29.720
No, I don't want to drill anywhere near my business.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.720
Okay, I'm passing.

38:31.720 --> 38:37.720
I don't I don't need a hole drilled up into my womb.

38:37.720 --> 38:41.720
Drill pack my cervix.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.720
Um, how can emotions change in me?

38:44.720 --> 38:47.720
Emotions can change in me because when you are feeling certain emotions,

38:47.720 --> 38:49.720
it releases different chemicals in your body.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.720
So that can take change the flavor of the meat.

38:52.720 --> 38:56.720
But yes, um, this is a baby.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.720
But it's a yes.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.720
We are fucking this baby.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.720
Don't please don't.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.720
Oh, God.

39:07.720 --> 39:14.720
Um, yes, I'm going to smash.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.720
That's because it literally is anal beads on its tail.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.720
So sign me up.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.720
See, I know.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.720
And it's little tongue is mouth is cute.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.720
Yeah, I can have always been cute.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.720
And I think Jesse and James for that.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.720
Underappreciated Pokemon always.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.720
Uh, Arbok smash.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.720
Oh, absolutely.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.720
Also, I bet he's a really good coupler afterwards.

39:42.720 --> 39:48.720
Oh, yeah, just like kind of just like, um, coil around you and you guys can just like

39:48.720 --> 39:49.720
hang out.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.720
I feel like you would give really good kisses.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.720
I don't know that tongue.

39:52.720 --> 39:58.720
Like I have his teeth, but like tongue, the end of that tail.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.720
Yeah.

40:00.720 --> 40:05.720
Also, you got to take into account that snakes have to.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.720
Oh my God.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.720
You're right.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.720
Oh, smash.

40:09.720 --> 40:11.720
Smash.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.720
Pikachu.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.720
Pika, Pika.

40:15.720 --> 40:19.720
That's an E for me.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.720
Uh, yeah, I'd eat Pikachu.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.720
I would not smash them.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.720
Uh, but I would eat them.

40:25.720 --> 40:29.720
Uh, I feel like they would have like either like a Zesty.

40:29.720 --> 40:33.720
Citrusy flavor or like it would pair well with that.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.720
Like I feel like a Pino.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.720
Um, Grigio.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.720
Something right to pair with.

40:39.720 --> 40:40.720
Yeah.

40:40.720 --> 40:41.720
Yeah.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.720
Uh, I would eat Pikachu.

40:42.720 --> 40:43.720
Mm hmm.

40:43.720 --> 40:44.720
Yeah.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.720
Not into electric stimulation.

40:46.720 --> 40:47.720
Yes.

40:47.720 --> 40:48.720
But like we'll get to that.

40:48.720 --> 40:49.720
Don't worry.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.720
I just wouldn't, I wouldn't fuck this mouse.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.720
This particular one now.

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
Yeah.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.720
This electric mouse.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.720
I'm gonna pass, but eat.

40:56.720 --> 40:57.720
Uh, that's a fat boy.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.720
I'm good.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.720
Yeah.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.720
I'm good.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.720
But he'll crush me.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.720
The original fat boy is back.

41:04.720 --> 41:05.720
Oh.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.720
Oh, fat Pikachu.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.720
I don't, I don't mind a little bit of chub.

41:09.720 --> 41:15.720
I don't mind a little bit of chub or chunk, but, um, I would eat this one still.

41:15.720 --> 41:20.720
Uh, especially cause it's probably, it's maybe more flavor from the fat on the meat.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.720
You know what?

41:21.720 --> 41:22.720
You know what makes me laugh?

41:22.720 --> 41:23.720
Mods are asleep.

41:23.720 --> 41:30.720
Post path, fat Pikachu.

41:30.720 --> 41:31.720
Yeah.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.720
Tell me, are you like my only mod right now?

41:34.720 --> 41:35.720
I'm just kidding.

41:35.720 --> 41:36.720
Everybody's been pretty good.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.720
I might.

41:37.720 --> 41:38.720
Yeah.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.720
They're probably just hiding.

41:39.720 --> 41:40.720
Yeah.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.720
They're just, you know, the marbling would be insane.

41:43.720 --> 41:46.720
That's like a wagyu.

41:46.720 --> 41:50.720
Uh, he's so full of happiness and delicious.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.720
Yeah.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.720
Oh, that would be a delectable meal.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.720
Absolutely delicious.

41:54.720 --> 41:58.720
You'd cook him like you would cook Korean barbecue.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.720
Yes.

41:59.720 --> 42:02.720
Um, what about Raichu though?

42:02.720 --> 42:05.720
Oh, that's a smash for me.

42:05.720 --> 42:06.720
Yeah.

42:06.720 --> 42:07.720
Explain.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.720
I need, I need the details.

42:09.720 --> 42:10.720
Okay.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.720
So when I was younger, I had them.

42:12.720 --> 42:13.720
Right.

42:13.720 --> 42:14.720
Oh, okay.

42:14.720 --> 42:19.720
I was like, where is this going?

42:19.720 --> 42:22.720
I guess, I just think Raichu is like the cooler cousin.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.720
Or I guess the cool dad of Pikachu.

42:25.720 --> 42:26.720
Okay.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.720
He's got an extra chewy tail.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.720
If you guys like one of the original like Raichu toys.

42:31.720 --> 42:32.720
Oh, good point.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.720
I also like to chew on stuff myself.

42:34.720 --> 42:35.720
So I totally understand.

42:35.720 --> 42:39.720
I'm literally like eating some applesauce and showing on the cap right now.

42:39.720 --> 42:44.720
I wouldn't smash them though, but I wouldn't eat them.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.720
Um, I don't know.

42:46.720 --> 42:47.720
I just like to hang out.

42:47.720 --> 42:54.720
Like shoot the shit Raichu, I think.

42:54.720 --> 42:58.720
Understandable because he probably is really good at conversation.

42:58.720 --> 43:01.720
He's a war vet, don't you know?

43:01.720 --> 43:02.720
That's yeah.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.720
Yeah.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.720
Yeah.

43:04.720 --> 43:05.720
He's been through a lot.

43:05.720 --> 43:06.720
A lot of good stories.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.720
Um, Raichu Alola.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.720
God, I want to eat him.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.720
I also, yeah, I would devour this thing.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
I don't know.

43:15.720 --> 43:18.720
I feel like it's like caramel toffee.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.720
Like dessert.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.720
With a little bit of vanilla.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.720
Yeah.

43:23.720 --> 43:24.720
Some whipped cream toast.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.720
Yeah.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.720
Or like some like some sort of cream filling.

43:27.720 --> 43:29.720
And you know, I love me some cream filling.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.720
Oh, absolutely.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.720
Like a Boston cream donut.

43:33.720 --> 43:34.720
Oh, yep.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.720
I am devouring this one.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.720
Yeah.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.720
Uh, Sanchu.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
That's a baby.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.720
That's a baby.

43:43.720 --> 43:44.720
Yeah.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.720
I love all of them.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
They're just so cute.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.720
I love their little eyes.

43:47.720 --> 43:48.720
So pretty.

43:48.720 --> 43:51.720
Oh, I have always liked them.

43:51.720 --> 43:52.720
Yeah.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.720
They're cute.

43:53.720 --> 43:54.720
Yeah.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.720
We'll pass.

43:55.720 --> 43:56.720
It's a, it's a pass.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.720
Uh, what about the Alolan one?

43:57.720 --> 43:58.720
Looks like a little igloo.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.720
This is a baby in a different color.

44:01.720 --> 44:06.720
This is, this is, this is alternate ethnicity.

44:06.720 --> 44:07.720
Baby.

44:07.720 --> 44:08.720
Um, yeah.

44:08.720 --> 44:09.720
We'll pass.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.720
This one's from the Arctic.

44:12.720 --> 44:13.720
It's fine.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.720
I might eat this one.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.720
Cause I feel like it would be like a vanilla,

44:18.720 --> 44:20.720
like creamy popsicle.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.720
So I'll eat it.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.720
Or I might like bite the tail off.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.720
Or like just come the tail.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.720
Just give me a taste.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.720
Like, like Sonic ice.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.720
Like you could just pick the bricks off of him.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.720
Yeah.

44:33.720 --> 44:34.720
Exactly.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.720
I got it.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.720
It's going to be a pass for me.

44:38.720 --> 44:39.720
Yeah.

44:39.720 --> 44:40.720
Yeah.

44:40.720 --> 44:41.720
A pass.

44:41.720 --> 44:42.720
Sand slash.

44:42.720 --> 44:43.720
Yeah.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.720
I'm worried about them claws.

44:45.720 --> 44:46.720
Yeah.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.720
And everything looks sharp.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.720
A lot of edges.

44:50.720 --> 44:53.720
Uh, the horn on the head looks too sharp.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.720
I don't think you could ride that.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.720
No.

44:56.720 --> 44:57.720
Yeah.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.720
Unless he's like soft.

44:59.720 --> 45:00.720
Yeah.

45:00.720 --> 45:01.720
Yeah.

45:01.720 --> 45:04.720
I can't really tell if he's like, can he like harden?

45:04.720 --> 45:07.720
Can he like make himself softer?

45:07.720 --> 45:08.720
Cause I don't want to, and again,

45:08.720 --> 45:09.720
I don't want to hurt myself,

45:09.720 --> 45:11.720
but I'm going to pass cause I don't know.

45:11.720 --> 45:12.720
I'm going to pass too.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.720
Uh, that's a popsicle.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.720
Um.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.720
You'd get stuck.

45:17.720 --> 45:18.720
Yeah.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.720
That's an, I like, I would definitely my tongue.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.720
I can't even eat that.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.720
Or he'd get stuck.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.720
If you know.

45:25.720 --> 45:26.720
Oh.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.720
Because of the two differing temperatures.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.720
Good point.

45:31.720 --> 45:32.720
Ow.

45:32.720 --> 45:33.720
Uh, yeah.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.720
I'm going to say no.

45:35.720 --> 45:37.720
Like an ice cube up there.

45:37.720 --> 45:38.720
Oh.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.720
If it was like a little bit of play,

45:40.720 --> 45:42.720
like a little foreplay with it,

45:42.720 --> 45:43.720
I'd be fine.

45:43.720 --> 45:44.720
But like if it's up there,

45:44.720 --> 45:46.720
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good.

45:46.720 --> 45:47.720
I'm good.

45:47.720 --> 45:48.720
It's the whole time.

45:48.720 --> 45:49.720
It'd be the full time.

45:49.720 --> 45:51.720
That's so cold.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.720
Uh, what did I melt it?

45:53.720 --> 45:55.720
Like I feel like my body heat would bring it down.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.720
Or maybe I would just get fucking hyperthermia.

45:58.720 --> 46:01.720
You probably get hyperthermia because I don't think he'd melt

46:01.720 --> 46:02.720
the pill he's done.

46:02.720 --> 46:03.720
You know?

46:03.720 --> 46:04.720
Oh gosh.

46:04.720 --> 46:05.720
Yeah.

46:05.720 --> 46:06.720
I'm good.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.720
I'd get wet, but not in the right ways.

46:09.720 --> 46:10.720
Um.

46:10.720 --> 46:17.720
Uh, dish it a little dish it a little baby.

46:17.720 --> 46:18.720
I would pass.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.720
I wouldn't even eat it.

46:20.720 --> 46:21.720
Nah.

46:21.720 --> 46:22.720
Same.

46:22.720 --> 46:23.720
Also it's poison.

46:23.720 --> 46:24.720
Yeah.

46:24.720 --> 46:25.720
Just a little guy.

46:25.720 --> 46:26.720
Just a little boy.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.720
You know what I didn't realize what this was for the longest time?

46:29.720 --> 46:32.720
I didn't realize that these were rabbits.

46:32.720 --> 46:33.720
What?

46:33.720 --> 46:35.720
These are rabbits?

46:35.720 --> 46:37.720
They're rabbits.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.720
Oh my God.

46:39.720 --> 46:45.720
I literally thought they were like mice.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.720
Yeah.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.720
Oh my God.

46:47.720 --> 46:48.720
What the frick?

46:48.720 --> 46:49.720
I'm going to pass.

46:49.720 --> 46:55.720
Um, Nidorina has some like bedroom eyes, but she's a little bit young

46:55.720 --> 46:57.720
for me for this one.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.720
So I'm going to pass.

46:59.720 --> 47:03.720
I can only think of that hamburger biscuit animation from a long time ago.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.720
Oh my God.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.720
They are like really cute.

47:06.720 --> 47:14.720
And like, every time I see her I think hamburger biscuit.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.720
Is that, is that a smash for you then?

47:16.720 --> 47:17.720
Yeah.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.720
Nidorina is a smash for me.

47:19.720 --> 47:20.720
Okay.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.720
I'll smash Nidorina too.

47:22.720 --> 47:26.720
We can, we can, we can visit Paris together with Nidorina.

47:26.720 --> 47:27.720
Yeah, we can.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.720
I feel it.

47:30.720 --> 47:32.720
Uh, Nidorina queen?

47:32.720 --> 47:34.720
Uh, she's a queen.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.720
Of course that's a smash.

47:36.720 --> 47:37.720
Uh, yeah.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.720
She looks like she got some tickle bitties.

47:39.720 --> 47:46.720
So I'm going to, I'll smash.

47:46.720 --> 47:51.720
This is also, I can't believe, I am literally mind blown that I did it.

47:51.720 --> 47:53.720
Fucking based off of rabbits.

47:53.720 --> 47:58.720
I'm like actually frustrated.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.720
I'm going to say no.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.720
Because again, baby, baby rabbit.

48:03.720 --> 48:07.720
So it's probably my distant relative.

48:07.720 --> 48:13.720
Did you know I'm canonically related to every bunny character in pop culture?

48:13.720 --> 48:14.720
Wow.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.720
Yeah.

48:15.720 --> 48:16.720
In some way shape or form.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.720
Mm-hmm.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.720
Very well connected.

48:19.720 --> 48:20.720
Yeah.

48:20.720 --> 48:31.720
I don't, it's just, it's a soft, it's a touchy subject for me, but, um, my mom, who is Jessica

48:31.720 --> 48:36.720
rabbit may have cheated on Roger rabbit with bugs to make me, but I'm not sure.

48:36.720 --> 48:37.720
I'm not sure.

48:37.720 --> 48:38.720
It's just a rumor.

48:38.720 --> 48:43.720
Honestly, I put that kind of just like that, that behind means moving on with my life,

48:43.720 --> 48:46.720
you know, not going to linger on it.

48:46.720 --> 48:47.720
Yeah.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.720
It's crazy.

48:48.720 --> 48:49.720
I guess I never knew.

48:49.720 --> 48:50.720
I'm so sorry.

48:50.720 --> 48:51.720
Yeah.

48:51.720 --> 48:52.720
Yeah.

48:52.720 --> 48:53.720
It's tough.

48:53.720 --> 48:54.720
Um, but I'm going to say pass.

48:54.720 --> 48:55.720
Yeah.

48:55.720 --> 48:56.720
I'm going to say pass.

48:56.720 --> 48:57.720
Yeah.

48:57.720 --> 48:58.720
He's on all fours.

48:58.720 --> 48:59.720
That's a pass for me.

48:59.720 --> 49:00.720
He's up.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.720
Look at all those little ridges.

49:02.720 --> 49:03.720
I know.

49:03.720 --> 49:04.720
I know.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.720
Yeah.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.720
Wait, why is he on all fours and the arena?

49:07.720 --> 49:08.720
Is it?

49:08.720 --> 49:11.720
Because a lady doesn't crawl.

49:11.720 --> 49:15.720
That's a good say it louder for the people in the back.

49:16.720 --> 49:19.720
A lady doesn't crawl.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.720
I love that.

49:21.720 --> 49:23.720
Unless she wants to.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.720
Unless she wants to.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.720
Unless you ask politely.

49:27.720 --> 49:28.720
Exactly.

49:28.720 --> 49:29.720
Exactly.

49:33.720 --> 49:37.720
So he's a, he is low key a pass for me.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.720
Yeah.

49:38.720 --> 49:44.720
I feel it gives me like jock vibes, like football player vibes.

49:44.720 --> 49:48.720
But like a dick one, not like one of the nice sweet ones.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.720
Oh, like one who would take you under the bleachers and like.

49:51.720 --> 49:52.720
Yeah.

49:52.720 --> 49:53.720
Call you again.

49:53.720 --> 49:54.720
Exactly.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.720
Yeah.

49:55.720 --> 49:56.720
I'm good.

49:56.720 --> 49:57.720
I'm good.

49:57.720 --> 49:58.720
Yeah.

49:58.720 --> 50:02.720
I'm eating this.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.720
It looks so sweet.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.720
It's, it's cotton candy.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
I'm eating it.

50:08.720 --> 50:13.720
Um, I'm trying to think about how he would copulate if we tried, but I can't.

50:13.720 --> 50:17.720
So that's, I'm eating it.

50:17.720 --> 50:20.720
If I can't fuck it, I'm eating it.

50:20.720 --> 50:24.720
I mean, it would have metronome, you know, metronome might be worth it,

50:24.720 --> 50:26.720
but you never know what you're going to get.

50:26.720 --> 50:27.720
Yeah.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.720
I'd eat, I'd eat this one before I smash it.

50:30.720 --> 50:31.720
Okay.

50:31.720 --> 50:32.720
I'm safe pass.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.720
What about Clefable?

50:34.720 --> 50:38.720
Oh, that's a horse of a different color because he's bigger or she's bigger.

50:38.720 --> 50:39.720
I guess.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.720
Yeah.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.720
And she's throwing up gang signs.

50:43.720 --> 50:44.720
I know.

50:44.720 --> 50:45.720
Okay.

50:45.720 --> 50:47.720
Does that mean she's for the streets though?

50:47.720 --> 50:48.720
Like.

50:48.720 --> 50:49.720
Yes.

50:49.720 --> 50:50.720
Yes.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.720
She's for the streets.

50:51.720 --> 50:52.720
She's straight from the moon.

50:52.720 --> 50:53.720
She's for the streets.

50:53.720 --> 50:54.720
Yeah.

50:54.720 --> 50:57.720
I don't know if I want a girl from the streets.

50:57.720 --> 51:00.720
She'd be, I'm from the streets.

51:00.720 --> 51:01.720
Oh, no.

51:01.720 --> 51:03.720
That's not what I meant.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.720
She'd be, I'm from the streets.

51:07.720 --> 51:08.720
Oh, no.

51:08.720 --> 51:09.720
That's different.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.720
That's different.

51:11.720 --> 51:14.720
It's different.

51:14.720 --> 51:20.720
Um, I'd probably, you know, I'll let Clefable escape with her life.

51:20.720 --> 51:23.720
I'm not going to eat them because I need to consider it for longer,

51:23.720 --> 51:25.720
but I'll say pass for now.

51:25.720 --> 51:26.720
You know what?

51:26.720 --> 51:31.720
I'm going to say smash, but on the caveat that I can get a double team with Gengar

51:31.720 --> 51:32.720
with them.

51:32.720 --> 51:33.720
Ooh.

51:33.720 --> 51:36.720
That's, I like that.

51:36.720 --> 51:39.720
Then yes, it's a pass for me.

51:39.720 --> 51:40.720
Okay.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.720
It's a situational pass.

51:42.720 --> 51:43.720
Okay.

51:43.720 --> 51:44.720
I understand that.

51:44.720 --> 51:46.720
Um, bull picks.

51:46.720 --> 51:49.720
Oh, that's a baby.

51:49.720 --> 51:50.720
Yeah.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.720
I'm sure you don't, but I just want to snuggle it.

51:52.720 --> 51:55.720
Well, babe, I'm like, like the hair.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.720
Like the, so.

51:57.720 --> 51:58.720
That's a baby.

51:58.720 --> 52:00.720
I can't, I can't smash that.

52:00.720 --> 52:01.720
I can't eat it either.

52:01.720 --> 52:04.720
It doesn't really look that tasty.

52:04.720 --> 52:05.720
Just cute.

52:05.720 --> 52:09.720
Um, however I would eat, it's a lonely cousin.

52:09.720 --> 52:11.720
Oh hell yeah.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.720
That is, that is that good.

52:13.720 --> 52:14.720
It's no code.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.720
Oh hot.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.720
Just like a little bit of drizzle of your favorite syrup on that thing.

52:18.720 --> 52:19.720
Eating.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.720
That's going right in my mouth.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.720
100%.

52:22.720 --> 52:26.720
Um, smash, pass or four.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.720
Eating.

52:28.720 --> 52:34.720
So I'm going to pass nine tails.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.720
Smash.

52:35.720 --> 52:36.720
Smash.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.720
Smash.

52:37.720 --> 52:38.720
Smash.

52:38.720 --> 52:39.720
Smash.

52:39.720 --> 52:40.720
Smash.

52:40.720 --> 52:41.720
Oh God.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.720
A nine tails.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.720
All right.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.720
Don't even discuss it further.

52:45.720 --> 52:47.720
Uh, what about the Alolan version?

52:47.720 --> 52:50.720
That is an extra pretty one.

52:50.720 --> 52:51.720
Yeah.

52:51.720 --> 52:53.720
I, yeah, I'm going to agree with this.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.720
I feel like it would just be really sensual.

52:55.720 --> 52:58.720
Also they're wispy because they're like park ghosts.

52:58.720 --> 52:59.720
So like, yeah.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.720
You know, I'm into it.

53:01.720 --> 53:05.720
Maybe they have, you know, a little something, something that only ghosts can do.

53:05.720 --> 53:06.720
Only ghost types can do.

53:06.720 --> 53:07.720
Um, jigglypuff.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.720
This is a piece of bubble gum.

53:09.720 --> 53:10.720
I know.

53:10.720 --> 53:15.720
Just like immediately it would like move to speak and I would just pick it up and

53:15.720 --> 53:16.720
pop it in my mouth.

53:16.720 --> 53:20.720
Um, so yeah, I'm going to pass and eat it.

53:20.720 --> 53:23.720
I'm, I'm boring this jigglypuff.

53:23.720 --> 53:26.720
I am chewing it like bubble gum and blowing.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.720
Yep.

53:27.720 --> 53:29.720
And it's a little, I bet, you know, I'd make it.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
I would freeze it.

53:30.720 --> 53:34.720
I'd freeze wiggly tough into one of those like SpongeBob popsicles because their

53:34.720 --> 53:36.720
eyes look like gumballs.

53:36.720 --> 53:38.720
And I would eat it like that.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.720
That's, that's what I would do for wiggly tough.

53:40.720 --> 53:41.720
Hmm.

53:41.720 --> 53:43.720
I'd only want to chew on the hair.

53:43.720 --> 53:44.720
I don't want to.

53:44.720 --> 53:45.720
I don't want to.

53:45.720 --> 53:46.720
I don't want to.

53:46.720 --> 53:47.720
I don't want to.

53:47.720 --> 53:48.720
Hmm.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.720
I'd only want to chew on the hair.

53:50.720 --> 53:51.720
Yeah.

53:51.720 --> 53:52.720
The rest is a pass.

53:52.720 --> 53:53.720
Okay.

53:53.720 --> 53:54.720
Understood.

53:54.720 --> 53:55.720
Understood.

53:55.720 --> 54:01.220
You know, from a certain angle, his back foot looks like something else.

54:01.220 --> 54:02.720
So I did have to do a double take.

54:02.720 --> 54:03.720
Um.

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
Yeah.

54:04.720 --> 54:05.720
I see what you're saying.

54:05.720 --> 54:06.720
Yeah.

54:06.720 --> 54:07.720
But no.

54:07.720 --> 54:08.720
Yeah.

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
That's a foot.

54:09.720 --> 54:13.720
And I mean, his foot could go up there, but that's more of like a threat of violence

54:13.720 --> 54:14.720
at that point.

54:14.720 --> 54:15.720
Yeah.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.720
I feel like I'm just getting kicked in the crotch at that point.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.720
Zubat.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.720
That's a bat.

54:22.720 --> 54:23.720
Yeah.

54:23.720 --> 54:24.720
That's a straight up bat.

54:24.720 --> 54:29.720
Um, I don't even know what you could do with that because his legs are really fucking

54:29.720 --> 54:30.720
weird.

54:30.720 --> 54:31.720
It's all mouth.

54:31.720 --> 54:36.720
So maybe actually, maybe it's good of the, that the lingus of con.

54:36.720 --> 54:37.720
I don't know.

54:37.720 --> 54:38.720
You know.

54:38.720 --> 54:39.720
No, not this one.

54:39.720 --> 54:40.720
Not this one.

54:40.720 --> 54:41.720
Honestly.

54:41.720 --> 54:42.720
Honestly.

54:42.720 --> 54:45.720
I feel like this one might start a second pandemic.

54:45.720 --> 54:46.720
Okay.

54:46.720 --> 54:57.720
I'm passing the fuck out of that.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.720
I'm not even going to try to eat it.

54:59.720 --> 55:05.720
I'm not saying with gold bat because you said that I'm just scared.

55:05.720 --> 55:10.720
I just, I don't want to repeat on this.

55:11.720 --> 55:17.320
Uh, although gold bat's mouth is so tantalizing, but there's actually, I don't see a tongue

55:17.320 --> 55:18.320
in there.

55:18.320 --> 55:19.720
So yeah, I'm going to, we're passing.

55:19.720 --> 55:20.720
We're passing.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.720
I feel like he had tongues in the past though, right?

55:23.720 --> 55:24.720
Did he?

55:24.720 --> 55:25.720
I don't know.

55:25.720 --> 55:26.720
I'm Googling this.

55:26.720 --> 55:31.720
Cause I feel like gold bat, gold bat had a tongue in the past.

55:31.720 --> 55:34.720
I feel like you're right.

55:34.720 --> 55:39.220
The same thing happened to me when I was looking for a character with a black lip in like Hannah

55:39.220 --> 55:40.220
Barbera cartoons.

55:40.220 --> 55:46.220
And I know that bitch had a black lip, but when I looked her up ain't nothing but red

55:46.220 --> 55:47.220
lips.

55:47.220 --> 55:49.920
And I'm like, I swear I have like a red or pinkish or like purplish tongue.

55:49.920 --> 55:50.920
Oh my God.

55:50.920 --> 55:53.420
Is this like Mandela effect right now?

55:53.420 --> 55:54.420
I think we're in them.

55:54.420 --> 55:57.220
I think we're, I think someone shifted the universe like again.

55:57.220 --> 55:58.220
Yeah.

55:58.220 --> 55:59.220
I'm pretty sure I agree with that.

55:59.220 --> 56:02.220
Cause I know this fucker had a tongue.

56:02.220 --> 56:03.220
Yeah.

56:03.220 --> 56:04.220
You're, you're right.

56:04.220 --> 56:05.220
I'm going to, I'm going to pass though.

56:05.220 --> 56:06.220
I like his little cat ears.

56:06.220 --> 56:09.220
His ears are so fucking small.

56:09.220 --> 56:14.220
It's like a little kitty cat with wing, wings for little hands.

56:14.220 --> 56:16.220
Um, yeah, this is a pass.

56:16.220 --> 56:17.220
Audish.

56:17.220 --> 56:19.220
He's kind of useless.

56:19.220 --> 56:21.220
Audish, I'm going to eat.

56:21.220 --> 56:22.220
I know you don't like vegetables.

56:22.220 --> 56:24.220
So I know you're, that's also a baby.

56:24.220 --> 56:26.220
So you're probably going to pass that.

56:26.220 --> 56:27.220
Yeah.

56:27.220 --> 56:28.220
I'm going to pass.

56:28.220 --> 56:31.220
He can stay in the little ground like a mandrake.

56:31.220 --> 56:33.220
I'm chopping up Audish.

56:33.220 --> 56:34.220
I'm sorry.

56:34.220 --> 56:37.220
I'm going into a really nice salad.

56:37.220 --> 56:38.220
Gloom.

56:38.220 --> 56:50.220
I mean, it looks like somebody already beat us to it.

56:50.220 --> 56:57.220
Oh my God.

56:57.220 --> 56:59.220
I don't want sloppy seconds, man.

56:59.220 --> 57:05.220
I don't want whatever that is leaking out of Loom's mouth from somebody else anywhere

57:05.220 --> 57:07.220
near my business.

57:07.220 --> 57:11.220
And I'd probably trip and it'd probably be a bad trip or something and not have a good

57:11.220 --> 57:16.220
time from whatever things that would release spores.

57:16.220 --> 57:17.220
Jesus.

57:17.220 --> 57:18.220
Good.

57:18.220 --> 57:20.220
I'm not even eating that.

57:20.220 --> 57:21.220
Yeah.

57:21.220 --> 57:22.220
Fuck that.

57:22.220 --> 57:25.220
But it's already pre season.

57:25.220 --> 57:27.220
So would you?

57:28.220 --> 57:30.220
I mean, yeah, maybe.

57:30.220 --> 57:31.220
Okay.

57:31.220 --> 57:33.220
It's got berries on the top.

57:33.220 --> 57:35.220
So it's like part fruit.

57:35.220 --> 57:36.220
That's a good point.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.220
Those are berries.

57:37.220 --> 57:38.220
I forget.

57:38.220 --> 57:41.220
I always think they're like pods, like seed pods of some sort.

57:41.220 --> 57:43.220
So I try it at least once.

57:43.220 --> 57:48.220
And if the flavor didn't agree with me, I'd, you know, I'd never again.

57:48.220 --> 57:49.220
Understood.

57:49.220 --> 57:53.220
My chat is freaking out.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.220
I love it.

57:56.220 --> 58:01.220
What about, what about Viola Plume?

58:01.220 --> 58:03.220
This gentleman can, can pass on.

58:03.220 --> 58:05.220
He can, he can leave.

58:05.220 --> 58:06.220
Yeah, I'm good.

58:06.220 --> 58:12.220
Uh, with the, the eyes, the expression, I'm kind of put off the head.

58:12.220 --> 58:18.220
Like I, the flower, it looks like a suction, but I don't think it does that.

58:18.220 --> 58:23.220
So are you reading chat?

58:23.220 --> 58:24.220
Yeah.

58:24.220 --> 58:30.220
Honestly, I feel like this Viola Plume is just tipping his flower, like my lady.

58:30.220 --> 58:31.220
Yeah.

58:31.220 --> 58:32.220
And that's so cool.

58:32.220 --> 58:33.220
No.

58:33.220 --> 58:34.220
It's a little cringe.

58:34.220 --> 58:35.220
I'm going to say pass.

58:35.220 --> 58:37.220
Also, he's kind of stinky.

58:37.220 --> 58:38.220
Yeah.

58:38.220 --> 58:40.220
Stinky, stinky little boy.

58:40.220 --> 58:42.220
Uh, pat us.

58:42.220 --> 58:46.220
I'm eating it because I love, I love shellfish.

58:46.220 --> 58:49.220
Um, and literally my cat's food is going off.

58:50.220 --> 58:53.220
Um, so you're going to hear some cat munching.

58:53.220 --> 58:58.220
Um, but it literally comes with mushrooms to put on the side of the crab.

58:58.220 --> 59:02.220
So I'm going to eat it.

59:02.220 --> 59:05.220
Oh, to answer, to answer the question, I'm trinket right now.

59:05.220 --> 59:06.220
Yeah.

59:06.220 --> 59:07.220
This is trinket.

59:07.220 --> 59:08.220
Nice.

59:08.220 --> 59:09.220
Nice to meet you.

59:09.220 --> 59:11.220
Um, Tomas, Tomas busy.

59:11.220 --> 59:13.220
So we have trinket.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.220
That's fine.

59:14.220 --> 59:15.220
Maybe next time.

59:15.220 --> 59:16.220
Yeah.

59:16.220 --> 59:17.220
Maybe next time.

59:17.220 --> 59:22.220
Um, so I'm going to pass.

59:22.220 --> 59:24.220
What about you for the crab?

59:24.220 --> 59:27.220
Um, I don't eat fish.

59:27.220 --> 59:28.220
Mm-hmm.

59:28.220 --> 59:31.220
So I'm going to say pass.

59:31.220 --> 59:32.220
Okay.

59:32.220 --> 59:33.220
But I would pet him.

59:33.220 --> 59:34.220
Yeah.

59:34.220 --> 59:36.220
I always like, like holding the little crabs, like hermit crabs.

59:36.220 --> 59:40.220
Like I would never eat a hermit crab, but like this looks more like a regular crab,

59:40.220 --> 59:42.220
but I would hold a hermit crab.

59:42.220 --> 59:45.220
Anyways.

59:45.220 --> 59:48.220
Parasect.

59:48.220 --> 59:52.220
Does it, is it just me or does he look like he have a really big happy smile?

59:52.220 --> 59:56.220
I was literally actually just thinking that and I couldn't tell if it was its mouth or

59:56.220 --> 59:59.220
for it was like a section portion of the body.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:04.220
And now I'm like really wondering that in its eyes are dead.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.220
I just feel like it'll be brought in food.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220
So I'm not going to eat it.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.220
Honestly, I just feel like he's about to open his big mouth Muppet style.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.220
He's going to be like, hi-ho, parasite here.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:19.220
Coming at you lie from smash or pass.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.220
Well, why don't you smash me?

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.220
And I'm like, nope.

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.220
I mean, look how big my mushroom is.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.220
I could plug you up real nice.

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:34.220
I don't know why he sounds so tiny like this.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.220
I'm for the swies, queens, if you know what I mean.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.220
It's dead.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.220
The mushroom is a parasite.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.220
Oh yeah.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.220
That's right.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:49.220
So it's really the mushroom puppeteering the crab.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.220
So I'm good.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.220
I don't want it.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.220
I don't want to turn into that.

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.220
No, I'm good.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.220
I don't know.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.220
This is a left for dead situation.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.220
Why did he turn into Sean Connery?

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.220
Hey, I'm Sean Connery.

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.220
The Muppet.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:09.220
The Muppet Sean Connery.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:10.220
The Venonette.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.220
He's so fluffy.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.220
I know.

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:16.220
If I try to eat that, I feel like I would just choke like a hairball.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.220
So I'm good.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.220
Very cute.

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.220
Wood pet.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.220
Wood snuggle.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.220
Yeah.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.220
Yeah.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.220
I'm going to pass on this one and not eat it.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.220
Yeah.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.220
He's just too cute.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.220
Yeah.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.220
This little guy.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.220
I bet he's as delicate as a moth.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.220
Yeah.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.220
Oh, just like cradle them in their little hands.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.220
Yeah.

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.220
Cute.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.220
Cute moths.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.220
Cute moths.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.220
You know, I never understood why he turned so ugly.

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.220
I know.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.220
It's fucking bug eyes.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.220
Why are you so ugly?

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.220
I'm staring at you.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.220
I'm staring at you in my big eyes.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.220
Yeah.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220
I'm not.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.220
I feel like it would just crawl into me and lay eggs.

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.220
And not even like Caterpie would crawl in and hang out.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.220
And that's fine.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.220
It's already there.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.220
But I'm off.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.220
I'm good.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.220
Yeah.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.220
Caterpie's just cave exploring.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.220
Yeah.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.220
This creature would be trifling looking.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.220
Yeah.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.220
Like.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.220
Like, could you not?

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.220
I feel like that's like a Carlton.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.220
Not a Carlton.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.220
Oracle voice.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.220
Excuse me.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:25.220
Why does everything sound the same for the voices of me?

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.220
Did I do that?

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.220
Excuse me, my sweet madam.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:35.220
Would you mind if I laid my eggs in your beautiful crevasse?

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.220
Please.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.220
Oh, please.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.220
Won't you let me?

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:43.220
I'll let you ride my horn.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:49.220
I don't even mind if you get my wings wet, mistress.

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.220
Yep.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.220
That's literally, that's the voice.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.220
I'm passing.

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.220
I'm passing.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.220
Diglet.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.220
Smash.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.220
Smash.

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.220
Going up my ass.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.220
I mean, I'm a front door girlie.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:08.220
I'm, you know, I'm a front door girlie too, but like, I, like, I know a plug when I say

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.220
what.

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.220
I mean.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.220
Yeah.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:18.220
I'm, I'm, I'm riding that Diglet.

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.220
Yeah.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.220
Of course.

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:25.220
Until the, uh, the mill tanks come home, you know, you know what I'm saying?

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.220
It even, it even has a button for the front, you know?

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.220
Oh yeah.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.220
What's, what's Diglet's move set?

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.220
I forget.

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.220
Dig.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.220
Super.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.220
I mean, you could probably teach him tackle to it with your really desperate.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.220
That's right.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.220
He needs to breathe.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.220
Don't worry about it.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.220
He doesn't have to breathe where he's going.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.220
I'm smashing.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.220
Diglet.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.220
Oh.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:55.220
This is just not the day.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.220
This one has built in birth control.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.220
What the f***ing IUT.

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.220
Yeah.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:13.220
I'll, I'll, I'll sit on this Diglet too.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:17.220
This one's for sharing with the homies.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:24.220
Like, um, you can ride one.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.220
I can ride one and then we can get a friend to ride the other one.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.220
Did we have any...

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.220
I don't think I sit in, sit in the cock dirt.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.220
Cock dirt.

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:45.220
Are you okay?

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.220
Are you okay?

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.220
Are you okay?

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.220
F***ing cock dirt.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.220
Oh.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:58.220
Um, uh, or yeah.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.220
Okay.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.220
I'm, I'm smashing the trio.

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:09.220
Well, I just feel like you can't anymore with this one.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:14.220
He really laid that lay so well.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:23.220
I don't want to mess it up.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.220
Just because of the hair.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.220
I don't, I don't.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.220
That's a pass.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.220
That's a pass.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.220
I don't want to get it messy.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.220
I don't want to snatch her, his or her wig or weave off.

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:37.220
He put down a whole paycheck for those three.

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.220
I'm not messing that up.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.220
I'm not, I'm not messing that up.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.220
No, not one bit.

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:47.220
Oh, accidentally moved my, I meant to move myself a little bit to the side.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.220
Um, Meowth, this is a cat.

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.220
That's a cat.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.220
I can't eat it.

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.220
I can't eat it.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.220
I'm lighting the cat.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:00.220
If I steal the gold, if the gold coin on its head is chocolate, then yes.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:05.220
Honestly, I just steal the whole cat and make him do payday every day.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.220
That's a good point.

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:09.220
So we are, we're, is this, is this our first Rob?

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.220
Yeah, we're, we're robbing this one.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.220
We're robbing this one.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.220
Okay.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.220
We robbed this one.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.220
We're going to take, we're taking the whole cat.

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.220
We're taking the whole cat.

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.220
We're robbing this cat.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:19.220
We're stealing this cat.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:24.220
Uh, uh, what about this long boy?

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:25.220
My interest.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:28.220
Straight to jail.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.220
Don't.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.220
I thought you said straight to jail.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.220
I thought you said straight to jail.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.220
Straight to tail.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:39.220
And I was, I'm like, what do you mean that tail?

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:44.220
I mean, what that tail do is like between me and the bedroom and that cat, but that's

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.220
not a, that's not a smash.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.220
That's a smash and grab.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.220
Yeah.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.220
Okay.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.220
I'm stealing this whole cat.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.220
That's not long.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.220
Yeah.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.220
We're stealing.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.220
I feel like we could really shake some money out of him.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.220
Like, I don't know.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.220
Okay.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.220
Perfect.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.220
Uh, great googly moogly.

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.220
What the fuck is this thing?

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.220
That is a man.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:10.220
I don't need a little Danny DeVito trash man.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.220
Um, I'm good.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.220
I'm good with Meowth Galar.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.220

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.220

This one's pure sex.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.220
I, I gotta agree that expression.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.220
It's doing something to me.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.220
She, she really cute.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.220
She cute.

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:12.220
I think, and you know, I was debating whether or not if I should like bed her than rob her,

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.220
but I'm like, no, I feel like we'd have a good wine night stand.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:19.220
I feel like she'd treat me to like dinner and like she'd pay, like I'd offer to pay

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220
like split pay.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.220
And then we'd like be like, oh, maybe split and it's just, you would just pay it.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.220
Um,

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:26.220
She looks like she would be a sugar mommy.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.220

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.220

Yeah.

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.220
Okay.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.220
Ah, classic.

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.220
Classic Persian.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.220
Classic Persian.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.220
Cats of barbed penises.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.220
I mean.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:48.220
And I'm not averse to a little pain.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.220
I mean, I'm gonna say smash because I've always liked Persian.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.220

Because I have cats.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.220
Oh, great.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.220
People are going to be like, she be fucks her cat.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.220
No.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.220
Stop that right now.

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:15.220
There's a difference between a Pokemon and a real animal.

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.220
Yeah.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.220
Jesus Christ.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.220
Whoopie is my little baby boy.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.220
And like, we've all, we've all read comic books.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:27.220
Where there's like a handsome cat man.

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.220
No, I was thinking that's what you said.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.220
She doesn't.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.220
She doesn't.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:39.220
I mean, I mean, and Persians about as smooth as the cat returns Baron.

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:42.220
Oh, but I love Baron from the cat returns.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:46.220
He was my first crush on an anime character.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.220
That's because he's so charming.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.220
All right.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.220
I want to smash Persian.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.220
Me too.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:10:01.220
This is what sugar mommy turns into after the age of 60.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.220
I'm okay.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.220
I'm okay with this cougar.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.220

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.220
Okay.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.220
She's, she's not like, I smoke 10 packs a day.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.220
Yeah.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.220
She got the roastie voice.

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.220
She's like, Hey, sugar.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.220
You want to have like a mattress full of bills for you.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.220

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:27.220
Like you, like you don't know what she even does for her money because she just like lives

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.220

Like you'd think she's like, you're like, is she a drug dealer?

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.220
Like why is she like, how do you like, she's not like elegant.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.220
No, but she does live in decadence.

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.220
Yeah.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.220
That's 100% very often.

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.220
Oh yeah.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.220
You don't see her for like months.

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:51.220
I know mama and she'll be like, I've been in Hawaii.

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.220
Don't worry about it all.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.220
Here's buy yourself something nice.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220
Here you go.

01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:00.220
And it's like, hands you like a cool hundred.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.220
And you don't question it.

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.220
Yeah.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.220
Exactly.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.220
Exactly.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:11.220
Um, I probably steal the jewel in her head, but I'm going to pass.

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.220
I'm a smash.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.220
Okay.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.220
Honestly, I understand.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.220
I totally understand that decision.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.220
Uh, side duck.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.220
That's a duck.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.220
That's a duck.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.220
Uh, he doesn't know what the duck he's doing.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.220
So yeah, I'm, I'm, I don't, I don't feel like fucking a duck.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.220
That's confused all the time.

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:32.220
He's, he's always got headaches.

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.220
I would feel sorry for him more than anything.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:36.220
Yeah.

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:39.220
I just like, I don't know if I'm out of his misery.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.220
Like duck is delicious.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.220
Yeah.

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.220
I was debating whether or not to eat him.

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:43.220
I think I would.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:48.220
Um, but I'm like, maybe, maybe if I let him, you know, bust a nut, like on my

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:53.220
feet or something, like maybe it would like relieve some of that headache.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.220
Have you ever like, you know, rubbed one out and just like relieve a headache.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:58.220
Oh yeah.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.220
All the time.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.220
Yeah.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.220
Exactly.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.220
Exactly.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:07.220
So I feel like I wouldn't smash a duck.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:08.220
I'd help him out.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.220
Oh yeah.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:14.220
Just like a quick pop to the back of the head and he's out of his misery, out of

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.220
the headache.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.220
And then you, and then you have somebody cook them right up.

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.220
Yeah.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.220
Okay.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.220
Delicious.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.220
Perfect.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:24.220
Yeah.

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.220
Okay.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.220
Yeah.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.220
I'm going to pass, but I like this plan.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.220
Oh my God.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.220
Oh gosh.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.220
Taking.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.220
Piki Psyduck.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:34.220
I'm rubbing gold duck.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.220
Oh, absolutely.

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:40.220
That gym is just tend to actually, uh, yeah.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.220
I don't really see like the tails are a little bit tantalizing sometimes, but

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.220
I'm going to say no.

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.220
Yeah, like, I don't.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:53.220
I've always wanted, like what the heck is gold ducks texture of their skin?

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.220
Like, are they like smooth?

01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:01.700
smooth are they soft because like Psyduck looks a little like a little bit feathery but like Golda

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:10.660
looks slimy and early yeah like he's well moisturized but like he's still wet from the lotion feeling

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:16.900
yeah yeah i don't like that i'm i'm gonna pass no i don't like that but i would i would i would

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:22.180
pop them in the back of the head for that gym yeah it's a little one two well we can split

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:32.740
we'll split the uh the profits um manky this is a monkey he's probably got really good stamina

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:41.700
though true and i know you're a fan of monkeys of course so i'm gonna pass but are you gonna

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:50.820
smash manky manky spanky because like because like not only does he probably have the stamina

01:13:50.820 --> 01:14:02.100
he can probably like get really up in them guts yeah yeah yeah i'm just like i'm just wondering

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:10.580
where he's packing it though you know like oh he's literally just ahead well i mean sometimes animals

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:24.020
have innies good point that's a good point it's retractable okay okay understand thank you guys

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:33.060
thank you for that input i'm gonna pass on manky though primate uh like look how strong he looks

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:39.540
i was gonna say smash because i feel like i would like the aggression um i need someone to match my

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:46.100
freak and i feel like primate would uh i feel like primate pulls hair yeah i feel like he chokes

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:52.820
really well but he like doesn't do it the wrong way he does it the right way yeah you don't smash

01:14:52.820 --> 01:15:01.140
him smashes you yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna smash primate yeah same i like the little ears i do too

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:10.180
i've always liked his little ears yeah growlith okay but this is a puppy yeah i would i would just

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:15.860
keep it like as a pet or just like pet him or like when i see it on the street be like oh my god

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:21.460
can i pet your growlith and then the trainer like yeah and then i'd be like oh so cute yeah

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:29.780
yeah i'm not doing anything else with that however oh wait no i was i thought it was gonna be something

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:33.540
else i don't know what the fuck this is but i'm not eating it it looks like spicy though

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:40.980
he does look a little spicy he's from uh the the prequel game yeah yeah that's right honestly

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:48.500
he doesn't look as soft or as inviting as his as his uh as his descendant yeah he also has like

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:54.740
i can't tell if he only has two he only has two claws on the front well they all do wait i never

01:15:54.740 --> 01:16:00.340
know stuff before why did i think they're all paws what the heck is wrong with me uh i'm gonna pass

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:08.260
same however arcanine is what i was gonna get to yes that's a smash that's a smash we are smashing

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:16.180
arcanine thank you yeah okay i'm not gonna i'm not elaborating however i'm not gonna smash its

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:24.100
the creepy uncle arc i don't know i'd smash the creepy uncle he just looks like he smokes a lot

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:29.940
and reeks of cigarettes okay but i like the smell of cigarette smoke okay you know to each

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:36.660
their own i might i might watch that one i might take my turn um and watch and send the the cock dirt

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:46.580
and then watch that take place just i mean i don't i don't think there's anything wrong but i do it

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:53.380
because like as you know i'm i'm a dog that's true you are a dog i'm a bunny so i might get a little

01:16:53.380 --> 01:17:00.100
broken but it is one of this sometimes i get mistaken for a horse and it's fine though i mean

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:06.900
because we don't have to elaborate on what he's packing yeah uh although i am thinking about it

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:15.140
i kind of want to describe it for chat but i'm not gonna say it oh god i kind of want you to

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:25.060
what's the time sample got it out okay 117 go ahead okay so

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:31.140
because like all i can think of like it might be like a grotesque chili pepper but like it's

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:37.940
probably not that bad okay there are so many toys based off of you know the canine anatomy

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:47.940
yeah yeah uh-huh what would like the the color be like would it be like that orange or well for

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:54.500
a creepy uncle i imagine it would be like black like ebony black okay but for like but for like the

01:17:54.500 --> 01:18:01.860
original it would be like chili pepper red i agree with that statement yep um

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.740
moving on moving on

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:16.340
uh polywag uh polywag going into my mouth nowadays

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.220
what are the movesets for polywag

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:30.660
it's a squirt so like is polywag just gonna squirt on me like i'm just i just kind of want to eat it

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:38.660
i could definitely see it being used as a plug but pound oh it uses pound

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:48.180
i'm like it probably knows like hypnosis pound hypnosis water gun okay you know what

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:56.100
i'll fuck it then eat it yeah also i'll smash and then you're gonna season it yourself and

01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:03.140
then cook it exactly exactly you know i'd probably i'd probably just fuck it and let it live in a

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:09.620
pond backyard okay and then like call on it when you need to well yeah because he's gonna get stronger

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:17.060
and bigger yeah that's a good point so i might i might keep a couple some for eating and some for

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:19.780
other things might might maybe i'll farm them

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:26.500
the fuck a polywag farm

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:36.260
this is a brothel full of polywags okay what about poly world

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:46.180
oh what about poly world that's clearly a smash yeah like he looks like he could do like

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:53.780
some real good damage like some riona damage and then like some good aftercare yeah i feel like he

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:57.940
could like hypnotize you to make the pain go away but like you can still like look at the bruises

01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:03.780
and be like oh this was nice you know yeah you know what yeah i like that because you know i'm a

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:10.180
i'm a riona girl myself so um and like however i'm not into fisting too much so i just i would just

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:16.740
ask he like i'd hope that you respect my boundaries for that you know yeah cool okay i'll

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:22.740
smash poly wrath you just gain some fingers and eyelids

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:29.380
and it looks like he's smiling with his little hypnosis beam in the middle yeah that's a good

01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:35.780
point i kind of like the smug expression gloves off yeah he means business now gloves off

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:42.740
i'm gonna say smash i also say smash because like he's just a kitty pipe you put a little

foo man shoe mustache just not my thing and like the i feel like that symbol on its tummy

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:31.540

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.500
um grandpa vibes yeah i'm not i'm not really a gilf

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:56.340
mind to close when he's about to bust oh so you always have a warning if you're just like

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.300
facing him

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:12.420

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:29.780
spoons he's putting them on your nips like a little like cold sort of play like instead of

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:35.620
ice cubes it's he's just cupping your little nippies with that yeah he's just he's just roaming on

01:22:54.660 --> 01:23:01.300
without a spoon and he's got two of them that's a smash i i'm gonna i'll sit in the cock chair

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:56.180
like you want to get you want to do something frisky freaky and they're like sure and instead of doing

01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:00.420
like the grapefruit technique you just went out of bell sprout yeah i just like pull it out of the

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:06.100
side drawer and then and then it makes those noises like inappropriate popsicles noise yeah

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:16.500
inappropriate popsicle noises uh i like someone also pointed out that bell sprout is 69 so i i

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:22.180
thought that was funny too they knew what they were doing they knew what they were doing um i'm

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:28.340
gonna say yes i'm gonna smash bell sprout well i wouldn't be usually smashing i'm kind of just

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:41.060
like using it because i mean yeah the bell sprouts okay but what about weeping bell it gets a little

01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:49.060
bit bigger again that's suction like i know the next one has teeth so i would say no but this one

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:53.060
i will say i would cover the eyes because i don't get some looking at me

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:59.620
you know it's not multiple you can have one for the top and for the titties

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:08.580
oh and just like put one on each tittie and then like have a third just be like yeah yeah i don't

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:19.940
care if it's spits acid it's going on my clitoris think of it as a chemical peel yeah it's like a

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:23.940
uh uh what is that like the vegesals like the badge

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:31.540
let's put that on there you know exfoliating i'm gonna smash victory bell however i'm good

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:38.660
um i don't want to climb inside i bet it would be really comfy yeah how big is a is a victory bell

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:44.980
i feel like they're about people's eyes james would often get eaten by his yeah okay that's a good point

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:49.460
he's probably got a stem inside that you could probably ride on maybe

01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:54.180
i just feel like i feel like a guy would look at that and be like you know

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.340
i like a challenge because of those teeth on the edge

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:04.580
but then again you could use those to climb out if you're inside that's a good point we would have

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:11.860
to have a lot of communication in like boundary setting i feel like communication would be hard

01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:18.740
if you're inside of its mouth like yeah i can't understand you yeah i'm gonna pass i'm gonna

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:25.060
pass uh tend to cool well i've seen enough hint i didn't know where this is going yeah we're i'm

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:32.900
smashing and grabbing um i've always wanted the gems off of this creature same i just like let me

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:37.940
just join those real quick but do you think they feel like tide pods like they're squishy gems

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:45.700
oh okay so it's either a stress toy like a fidget toy i literally have a fidget toy like right next

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:53.860
to me in my hands um or it's a you can it's yeah it has double usage you have two lovely little

01:31:53.860 --> 01:32:00.180
tentacles and then you can squeeze it while it does its thing oh that's a smash yeah

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:12.420
you know i've never liked his face i feel like the beak could hold me in place like wrap around

01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:18.500
my waist and then it would just like you know you see enough hentai to know what happened next

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:26.740
yeah so like does the beak close i don't know i feel like it would be able to like extend and like

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:34.340
yeah it's like kind of like i'm like making a like a little talking hand motion but nobody can

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:39.220
fucking see me no i get what you're doing you're doing like the middle finger and the thumb touching

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:46.260
like yeah exactly eggs literally i so i feel like he can do that freaky uh pokemon i don't know i feel

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:50.100
like he would pinch me i'm gonna pass on to you know i don't mind i'm i'm gonna take a i'll take

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:58.660
risks i'm gonna say i'll sit it i'll sit in the cocktail okay the cocktail okay um that's a rock

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:07.540
that's a rock it's not a boulder it's a rock it's a rock um i feel like i couldn't even grind on that

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:12.740
i feel like the hardest yeah i feel like the hardest would be too hard because you know how

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:19.380
there's like different levels for dildos um like the what you're gonna call it like silicone yeah

01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:24.420
like the like the hardness of that like they're soft medium and hard i just feel like that would

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:31.540
just be very uncomfortable he's always hard that's a good point but if you if you if you went into

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:39.620
a rock tumbler for like three weeks and he came out smooth maybe maybe but as is no yeah a rock

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:44.900
that can just fist you and then like is he a grower is he a grower because like i don't know

01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:49.700
where anything else is he's really just hands in the head i don't know if his mouth works so like

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:54.900
i don't i'm not feeling it i i just feel like he doesn't have a rock cock if you know what i'm

01:33:54.900 --> 01:34:03.620
saying yeah yeah i know what you're saying um i don't care for the eyebrowed version either with

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:12.420
different fists and i don't like his hair yeah he's he's he's kind of ugly motherfucker um grabbler

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:21.700
yeah i don't know i i feel like it's a pass for grabbler yeah i feel like i would just get

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:29.540
dust and like sand and like dirt all in my crevices and i'm like i feel like he grit me well but

01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:35.620
at the end of the day i feel like friction burn you know like he's definitely got a good hold of

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:48.820
you but like outside of that like what else what else yeah 100 um yeah they the same thing with

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:53.300
the other geodude one that was funny i don't know they just like yoink the fingers for the little

01:34:53.940 --> 01:35:03.460

01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:18.900
me off also he's just going like yeah and he just named golem like a golem's an actual thing

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:23.540
i'll be honest with you this is one of my least favorite pokemon in the any of the games

01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:27.620
i don't like this pokemon because he's weird

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:38.900
i'm passing he's a weird little guy the alolan version is cute it's goofy he looks like he's

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:46.020
gonna sell me something like it gives me like um senchi from um dungeon meshi vibes and i think

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.700
what the fuck can you do with those those are like vestigial limbs

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:03.940
like a whale pass uh ponita

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:08.660

percent yeah smash yeah oh it that is a handsome prince man oh my goodness

01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:03.460
people like hello malady and like invite me to his castle oh yeah yeah i feel like

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:08.740
i'm just thinking of so many scenarios where he just treats me right like a princess

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:16.260
like he'll carry you yeah oh yeah although he's like although when i see him i kind of

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:21.460
think unicorn rules where they're only attracted to virgins oh that's a good point

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:27.460
but you know that's fine maybe he's different yeah maybe he doesn't judge maybe he doesn't judge

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.740
i can't relate because obviously i'm a virgin so

01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:39.540
um of course madame of course um i'm a good christian girl um of course

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:48.500
slow poke alternate none outfit win i don't i want a non outfit so fucking bad

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:54.500
i want one so bad there's like one like one those little dress up ones on booth and i'm like

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:59.220
i need to snag that

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:09.220
confess i'm not gonna lie are you gonna smash slow poke is a smash and eat i'm just gonna eat

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:16.340
i'm not smashing but what tell me why explain well i just love slow poke because like you know

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:21.060
he's not gonna finish like the same time as you so you can get off as many times and then he'll have

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:26.420
like his delayed reaction and so he'll he'll last longer than like your typical pokemon because

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:32.980
he's always slow on the update yeah that's a good point that's a good point i think i'm going to

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:39.220
sit in the cuck dirt for them because i kind of want because because i kind of want to see how

01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:46.580
you do it and then maybe you know because he takes forever i can like have my turn and then we can

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:53.220
consume him afterwards oh yeah season and then consume yeah like two little you know

01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:59.300
spiders and then like we don't even have to eat the whole thing just the tail yeah because i heard

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:05.780
that the tail is a delicacy so i guess i'm gonna click on smash alongside you for that one

01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:12.100
and of course it's like the same for this golden one i don't know this one looks a little bit sickly

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:19.940
to me i don't know i feel like he's got extra flavor extra flavor okay i'll let you have that one

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:28.580
i'm gonna pass yeah i'm gonna smash what about slow bro though he's on he's on two legs how am

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:42.100
i not smashing that i think i'm gonna pass because the spininess of the shell

01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:49.540
i feel like it would get in the way i just feel like it would get in the way like like imagine

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:55.220
he like he turns around or like he just like accidentally bumps you with it like ow you know

01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:01.700
like yeah he's watching i mean the shell's getting a free show at that point and i could care less

01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:09.540
yeah you know i'm not obviously i don't care if i'm watched but um yeah i just i don't know

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:16.740
yeah i'm just i'm just gonna pass i'm gonna pass i gotta i gotta pass on the next one

01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:25.620
he's just stuck he's just literally stuck i feel so bad i can't i can't help you bro

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:30.100
oh i can't help you bro i just want to get him out he looks so

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:33.860
oh chastity cage pokemon

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:44.260
chastity shell well i so because it's a chastity shell i can't smash but yes i guess i guess i

01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.140
can consider him one of my good little boy sluts i'll i'll say

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:53.540
he would like that he would like to be a good yeah um

01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:01.460
are you what about this one i don't know he's got smelly fingers

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:09.460
he looks like he kind of like don't know doesn't know how he got into this predicament

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:18.020
um like he like he just looks like he doesn't wash his hands yeah yeah i agree with this

01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:23.220
i'm just gonna i'm gonna pass i'm gonna pass

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:36.100
uh magnumite uh smash smash does it vibrate like it's got to if you get like some other magnets

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:41.460
going yeah you can sit on the you can sit on the top screw with his knobs

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:48.500
you know i'll say yes i'll say yes just because i can play with his knobs

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:55.460
you can play with his knobs and i feel like little zapping would be cool so i'm gonna smash

01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:04.020
yeah and then for magneton it's kind of the same thing you just have more pals to play with

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:10.900
you know that's the group activity yeah like that was the the this is the main course that was

01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:18.100
the one before was the appetizer like you could play never have i ever with this one and whoever

01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:28.100
had gets his app yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna smash and then like if you undo the screws you can have

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:33.140
like three of them yeah did you want to do you want to tag team on that one with me

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:37.940
sure i'll tag yeah i feel like that would just be a really fun time just like a couple of

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:42.500
friends hanging out we can have some drinks and you know play a couple of games like like you said

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:52.580
i'd be fun i like that casual pokemon get together exactly um so i know this one's a bird

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:58.260
but he's a very handsome bird uh he came and brought his own vegetable i'm cooking him

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:07.140
i'm i'm smashing him okay i'm eating him if you want to season him for me that's fine

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:15.060
yeah i don't want to season it for you okay yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna eat it however

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:27.700
the next one has a certain je ne sais quoi and that's fresh yeah like i don't know why but i'm

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:36.020
getting like berserk vibes like you've got guts yeah he's like the big big sword you know that

01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:42.500
express i don't i want to i think i might smash like he looks at you over his shoulders like

01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:54.100
stand back stand back or i guess he wouldn't call you a kitten he'd probably say

01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:59.380
stand back duckling yeah that's cute that's actually cute as hell if he called me as duckling

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:08.900
i'm gonna yeah i'm smashing this one um i don't even want to eat that

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:16.980
uh that's a pass for me yeah it's a pass because he looks dusty yeah yeah

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:25.860
like scratchy feeling like it's not like feathers it's like scratchy fur or like a mixture of like

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:36.740
hair like um like a like really itchy hey uh sama dodrio yeah also they fight all the time

01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:42.020
i was yeah i was gonna say i'm like i feel like they would just argue about like what to do next

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:47.940
and i'm not in the mood for that yeah yeah like i would hang out with that third head but that's

01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:52.020
not yeah like have a chat with them just be like forget the other guys like let's just hang out

01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:59.380
just pretend it's us it's a seal this is a seal i can't tell if i want to eat it or not but so

01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:05.540
because of that i'll spare it i'm gonna spare it as well because like i know seals always get a

01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:13.220
bad rap especially since i have this have they stopped the clubbings oh my gosh i think they

01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:19.860
i think they did like crack down on that like clubbing baby seals good i'm gonna spare him yeah

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:24.500
i don't want to eat or smash him same um dugong is so cute

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:32.900
but i feel like maneuvering in the bedroom would be difficult she's a lady

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:40.500
i don't i just want to take her out you know like we're a good time take her dancing yeah

01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:49.300
like are we gonna go in the water yeah like secret nice swimming like take her to a local pool

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:56.180
want to be like a dolphin moment if it was a male do okay not like that type of dolphin moment

01:45:57.060 --> 01:46:02.740
i fucking hate dolphins they are pretty shitty they're really shitty creatures they're smart but

01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:10.100
that's what makes them shitty is that they know what they do yeah i'm gonna say pass i'd probably

01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:18.260
just take her out yeah and then become like friends like if i were a guy with the equipment it

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:26.580
probably be a oh hundred percent like there's a lot of the ones like i remember um didn't you like

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:33.300
with with the other uh the other girl that you did this with um that one weird cat uh didn't you

01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:40.900
guys also do like a penis envy version as well oh right right right yeah penis envy one yeah i think

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:45.460
we should also like sneak that in so i'll say like i i definitely have penis envy for this one if i

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:51.700
was a dude i'd take my skull you know as a madame i'll take my strap and you know i guess then that

01:46:51.700 --> 01:47:03.220

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:43.140
Like I don't even worry. I'm not even worried about his ghost equipment. He's got like three out of

Three out of four. Yeah

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:51.060

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.900
Gengar mega

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.220
They look like punches

01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:18.660
Yeah, I can't really tell what's going on here, I'm gonna pass

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:24.780
I'm confused. I love the expression like, you know, I feel like we'd have crazy wild

01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:31.300
You know smashing this but I just yeah, I'm a little bit confused. So I'm gonna pass

01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:37.100
He's rolling out the red carpet for you baby girl

01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:44.740
Literally, do you I feel like how big is Gengar Gigantamax? Because I feel like each one of us can take each side of that tongue

01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.100
And we can do the same thing that we would do for the Gigantamax

01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.980
My champ

01:52:52.980 --> 01:53:00.460
Yeah, I think I think so. That's a smash. Yeah. Yeah. He's a haunted carnival, right? You're correct

01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:02.780
Where are we are smashing?

01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:06.980
Yes, we are smashing this this carnival, right? Mm-hmm

01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.620
That's a rock

01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:20.020
This is a collective group of rocks like I want to smash this like really bad, but again Onyx is giant

01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:23.380
and

01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:25.780
Like I couldn't use him for like

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:28.460
plugging stuff

01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:32.980
No, this is like a group effort. You'd have to get like a whole party to try to contact

01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:38.140
Yeah, exactly. So I'm gonna pass just for my own safety

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:44.860
It's drowsy. It's every hypno-comics

01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:51.220
I feel like yeah, I feel like he would just make me do the most depraved shit

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:55.500
But not even like the fun stuff like look how like, you know, see his bottom half

01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:58.900
You know, he's into some chocolate play

01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:00.900
Oh

01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:06.940
So he's got that weird elephant. No, yeah, like you just know he's gonna be like hey

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:11.100
That's just feel good. He's just all snuffling for truffles up in you. Yeah, I just

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:17.540
It's gross like ugly ugly bastard and like but this isn't like a good ugly bastard, you know, there's good

01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:23.380
So I'm gonna I'm good. Yeah pass. It's not like Venus or yeah

01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:27.220
Yeah, I would prefer Venus or over him

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:31.220
Hypno again, however that knows

01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:39.820
I'm I'm looking at that nose and you know

01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:55.540
But I was gonna say one of my favorite songs the Humpty dance from digital underground

01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:02.460
One of the lines is in a 69. My Humpty nose will tickle your rear and

01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:05.580
I

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.700
Kind of like that

01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:11.620
So any is five fingers

01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:18.780
Our 34 artists a sample are you smashing?

01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.900
Are you gonna sit in the dirt for that one

01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.980
No, I I'm really torn

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:31.260
I just feel like I'd like him better if he took a nap first because he just looks tired

01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:33.380
Yeah, do you think he wouldn't like try as hard?

01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:38.780
Yeah, I don't think he would try as hard because he knows he could just put you under like hypnosis

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:42.900
Oh, you're like a really lazy lover. That's true. And then he could be like, oh, yeah

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:48.460
We totally did stuff and he'd be like, oh, I really and then you like actually nothing happens. It's just really just yeah

01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:52.660
Like he puts you down he made it he gave you the suggestion

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:58.380
Oh, you felt really good during our time together and he's just sitting there reading the newspaper. Yeah. Yeah, just like

01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:02.180
Just like writing on the belly

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:05.700
Nothing

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:08.900
And then he brings you up and he's like was it good for you?

01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:25.500
I think I'm okay that like I think I've been convinced I don't think I want hip-no anymore

01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:37.380
Oh, yeah, I don't yeah, I'm a pass I'm eating this crab

01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.460
Like you can write them you can

01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:44.660
That's it

01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:46.660

01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:50.180
No, wait, how big is Voltorb because I'm like, could I pop them in? I don't think so

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:53.380
I don't like maybe a baby one if he was small

01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:59.380
Yeah, maybe a smaller one and then I could use it use it as a like a little a little

01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.020
You know

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:06.740
It doesn't that doesn't split apart. It doesn't have a mouth. The other one has a mouth

01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:09.620
Yeah, the other one has the teeth. Yeah

01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:13.380

So like well like I guess what do they do they ever show what the incentive of pokeball looks like? I can't remember

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:41.460
Um, well, it's like suspended animation, isn't it?

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:48.740
I like to think that it's a little environment. Yeah, I always like the picture. It's like they have like a whole ass house in there

01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:52.900
I'd like to sit in a pokeball. I bet it'd be really comfy

01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:59.700
Yeah, it's um the same thing as floor time. Do you think that like tomas tummy is like a like like a pokeball?

From the other perspective, that's true as a as a girl
