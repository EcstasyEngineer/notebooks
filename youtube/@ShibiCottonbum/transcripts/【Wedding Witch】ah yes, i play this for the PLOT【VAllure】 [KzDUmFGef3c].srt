1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

2
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

4
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

5
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

6
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

7
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You

8
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You

9
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Hello

10
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:39,040
Wedding with ya. Hello. Hello. Hello. I have fear with me

11
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I hide the baby girl

12
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
She hanging out

13
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Oh

14
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,040
Big young look up here. He looks so funny

15
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Poor pohia a

16
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,120
Poor pohia. Can I have a kiss? I want to kiss give me kiss. Yay kiss. Oh, no boomies here go away

17
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,120
You're ruining it. Oh my god, you're so heavy, dude

18
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,280
There's nothing over here for you. He kept trying to steal fias food when I was feeding fia on my desk

19
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,040
That's when he started when I didn't give him food he started screaming and getting really angry and running around

20
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,240
And then he just randomly tackled reina and reina was not having it. Oh

21
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
So you the tomagachi

22
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
I

23
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,200
Sorry, this is hard to line up focus

24
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Look how ugly it is

25
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,840
Frick is that I don't know what that is

26
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Whatever

27
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,280
And I dressed it up I try to make it look cuter

28
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
He's doing flips because he's happy because I fed him

29
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
He was just playing with fireworks inside the house

30
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,760
Let me uh, let me have him play with another toy. I'll have him play with a

31
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,480
With a stuffed animal boomy chill out, please

32
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,160
His food because I wanted to feed feed fias sooner rather than after because

33
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,480
This isn't my normal stream time and normally fia gets fed at nine and so does all the other cats their food goes off at specific times

34
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,760
And so you will hear a food dispenser your beloved at some point

35
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,240
And uh, he not ugly. Nah, he ugly bro. He ugly

36
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:16,280
Um, just like dad. Okay. Well, never mind if you'd say it looks like you then I don't want to

37
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,720
Um, let me make myself a little bit bigger

38
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
There we go

39
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,120
So this is wedding witch. I love this game

40
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
I haven't played it in a while. Um

41
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,640
Um

42
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,400
Since my pl so it's it's been a bit but I do like this game a lot

43
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
uh

44
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't really know how to explain it's literally what is that it's like

45
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
It's like the hollow live game

46
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Yeah, it's a survivor like

47
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Um, I'll be honest with you

48
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
This is just a chill stream

49
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
We're just hanging out. Um

50
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Um

51
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,840
It's somewhat difficult for me to like do chat interaction with this. I'll try my best

52
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,320
Sad father tipped four dollars and 20 cents. Please let our child live. I don't think my mental health can take another loss

53
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
He will live

54
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,680
Maybe here. Let me turn up that and let me turn down

55
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
I forgot you can't use mouse in this

56
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
If you do z

57
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
That's fine

58
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,120
Uh, because like I remember like the first times I've played this game

59
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,080
I was like, I did not know what the heck I was doing. Fia, are you

60
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Where are you sleeping face down?

61
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,760
Hi, sorry, sorry to wake you ma'am. I'm just making sure you're not suffocating yourself

62
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Huh, are you gonna sneeze?

63
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Oh

64
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,520
Thank you cows for the the four dollar super appreciate it

65
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,400
Um, thank you sad father. That's that's

66
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Fia, why are you face down?

67
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,120
Guys, she's she's just she's just sleeping. Okay, please don't think that my cat is dead

68
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,880
She's literally just sleeping. See sign of life

69
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
She's like stop making me up, please

70
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,640
I know oh kisses. You still have some food in your bed. Do you want that?

71
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want that food you missed

72
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
You get it

73
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,340
Please don't lick your bed. Okay

74
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,760
Yeah, she's eepy she even she'll probably turn into like a little like croissant soon enough

75
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,040
um, I actually like this angle for the camera because um

76
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,320
It's top down so you can kind of really just look at her except then from just the side

77
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
um

78
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
But yeah

79
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
I

80
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm gonna make the time I got you do one more thing before I get started, but I hope you guys are doing well

81
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,160
I'm a little sleepy. I just woke up. Um, I woke up and then I was an emmy stream

82
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,960
I literally have been watching Azura's stream all day

83
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,920
Um, I fell asleep to her stream. I had her on the background and then I popped in to see emmy

84
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,800
Um

85
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,760
And then I popped in right in time so I could help her with the dress stuff

86
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,680
I still have to send her some like flat chested stuff

87
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,840
Although honestly, I'm probably gonna tell her that anything that zoomie to kumi puts on

88
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
um

89
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Because she is flat

90
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,120
Because she uses the same outfits that I like the same person that I do they would probably definitely work for emmy

91
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
um

92
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Let me see

93
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,880
You're already full. Sorry. I'm feeding the tomagotchi. That's why I'm looking down

94
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Oh

95
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Let's see. What should I have you do?

96
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,200
Look at look look what it does. So I got it a ball

97
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,560
I'll show you

98
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,060
I have to like headphones are getting caught under my boo

99
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
You

100
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Just juke's everybody

101
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,900
And he scores a goal like my kids an athlete, right?

102
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Wrong. It was all a dream

103
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
It was all just a dream

104
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,500
Is there a header goal? Yeah, so fast. I literally said in the discord when she was at like 8k

105
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,060
I'm like, wow at this rate. She'll probably get to 10k in like an hour and then 10 minutes later

106
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,300
She hit 10k and I was like never mind

107
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,100
Well, like it's so happy for her like there's so many goal like there's so many stretch goals

108
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
They don't even know

109
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,460
There's like I know the other stretch goals that um, there's more than what she's shown you guys

110
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:32,460
So, yeah, maybe some some some oilers will drop some big money so everybody can see what they are

111
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,940
I think

112
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,100
Um, scrawny just as a contingency went all the way up to 30k

113
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,860
Not that like of course we're so small. I don't know if that would happen, but like

114
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,380
Um, sorry, there's a fucking bug. I'm trying to clap out

115
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,580
But yeah, it's it has been really nice. It's been really nice stream. Um, hi, how's it going? Hello

116
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,020
How sound is it too loud or anything I can turn it down if you guys want

117
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,060
There's a slime girl up there. Yeah, I know

118
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Yeah, there's definitely a slime girl up there

119
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
Hmm

120
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,620
Sounds perfect. Okay

121
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,380
Um, so if you don't know about this game, it's about a witch who's getting married and she is doing

122
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,500
She's trying to get flowers or I can't remember

123
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Well, I'll I'll you'll you'll see

124
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
So there's different versions

125
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,420
Her name is bell

126
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,100
I wonder if she's related to to me. Is this is a chabelle?

127
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,060
Um, you have achievements. Oh this sucks because I have to do everything over again

128
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,140
Because I beat the I essentially beat the game last time. Um

129
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,140
So you got like upgrades all that jazz

130
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:07,500
I think this game came out like last year. Um, and then your story mode and then some unlockable

131
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
I

132
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
The game has plot

133
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:28,860
The hat must grow I was like I was debating whether or not to make it a meme every time I die that my hat gets bigger

134
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,100
The hat that I'm wearing, um, but yeah, you have different

135
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,300
Which of the yeah, you guys see you guys know you guys know what's up ready to do story mode. Um

136
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,620
You got normal winning hard winning nightmare wedding

137
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:00,300
Oi get up already. Oi. Oi homeland has got my son. How long do you intend to stay in bed?

138
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Oh do I no wait no wait

139
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,180
I accidentally clicked space to skip

140
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
I

141
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:25,900
Sorry, oh, I get up already. How long do you intend to stay in bed? I accidentally skipped the plot

142
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,180
Uh

143
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,100
Just leave me alone because I'm not budging until the wedding ceremony

144
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,820
I'm not even going to eat anything the dress won't fit if I gain weight

145
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Here we go again

146
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
Oh

147
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Sorry

148
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,140
Oh each passing day makes me so nervous. I could just die

149
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,020
Even ordinary people get married. There's no need to raise such a fuss

150
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,060
Easy for you to say

151
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,180
So were you able to look into what I asked about earlier?

152
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,140
Who do you think I am there's nothing the world my eyes can't find

153
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Uh you mean

154
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,300
That's right. I've just finished research in human weddings. So get up already

155
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
Yay, I'm up. I'm up

156
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,900
Now according to my research humans have several rituals they perform at wedding ceremonies

157
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,300
Like what?

158
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,300
First a bride appears in a wedding dress accompanied by beautiful music

159
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,260
Okay, and then

160
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,420
After saying some bridge gibberish or whatever the bride puts a ring or restraint on the groom in front of everyone

161
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,860
Chaining him to her for all eternity

162
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,180
Hello, hello, welcome in welcome in

163
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Wait strontis here

164
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,700
Oh, wait, no, I just mean I'm like strontis should be asleep

165
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,740
Oh

166
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,180
Lastly the bride extorts gifts from the guests as they congratulate her

167
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,380
I don't know. I saw it in astralia and no

168
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,060
How wonderful I love weddings

169
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,660
And after the ceremony the first night with the groom begins

170
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,940
For first night

171
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,660
What what's that? I don't know anything about it

172
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,900
Don't pretend you don't know you've seen how familiar is the bread your fucking twat

173
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,420
How dare of you speak of such things in front of a lady. I'll shove it your fucking cunts

174
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Oh

175
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,140
Please don't give me that look that says you've come up with an idea. Who makes me nervous?

176
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,380
I swear it's a great idea. I just need your help

177
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,100
This'll make the best first night. I mean

178
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
The best wedding ever

179
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Oh

180
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,820
You what are you thinking of bringing us to this forest?

181
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,660
You should know that this is the succubus's queen's domain

182
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,500
Exactly. Now you can guess what I'm about to do. Can't you?

183
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
No, I cannot

184
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,940
You know the potions that the old lady drinks before she seduces a man

185
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,620
It makes one very alluring

186
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
The alluring indeed

187
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,140
Yeah, that grandma has them hidden around this forest. I just have to find them

188
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,740
Then once I have them, I'm sure my darling will

189
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,940
You know this forest is amazed. Did you bring me so yep, you're going to be my wing man

190
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,300
I could get lost because the roads keep changing here. So please help me find the potions

191
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,740
All right, I should pick some flowers for the bouquet too

192
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,460
And while we're at it, let's go and extort some gifts from the devils

193
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,780
Uh

194
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
I don't think this is how it works

195
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,900
Okay, so you got onslaught um

196
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
onslaught time attack

197
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,860
Or that so you have so essentially you have milk, which is the big titty potion

198
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,860
You have cat girl potion or you have strong lady potion. I will let you guys decide

199
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,700
The chat on stream isn't working. Thank you for telling me

200
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:37,100
If it's if it continues to not work, I'm probably just gonna get rid of it because it just always does that

201
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Live

202
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:55,100
Muscle milk strong strong. I'm seeing a lot of strong. Can't we do a poll? Oh, yeah facts

203
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:05,740
Potion seller I am going into battle and I need your strongest potions

204
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,460
I realize I feel I like I should be doing polls more often for the lurkers

205
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
So

206
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,660
My potions are too strong for you chat

207
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,980
They would put down a beast let alone a man they put down a werewolf

208
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
This is the hardest decision of my life

209
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,580
And I'll try to be consistent with it

210
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,500
Oh, there's no potions after that really because it's on baby mode

211
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,420
All right, looks like milk is winning by a landslide can I freaking I'm hitting shift instead of the window key to tab out

212
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,380
Mommy

213
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,380
Hi nori

214
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,940
Hi my sweet girl

215
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:22,620
Damn strong only got 27 percent everybody wants milk. All right, we'll do it. I have to remember how to freaking play

216
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,980
So I literally just stand here and I get

217
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
I'll get like stuff

218
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:42,540
You know just like some survivor game I don't want to oh and then there's a bonus and I'm very slow. Wow. I'm not used to this

219
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
So, uh

220
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,460
This is interesting so I'll get like bonuses and stuff and so it's really dependent on

221
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,780
What am I

222
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,420
Going to try to build around because I have milk. I honestly forget what the

223
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,380
um

224
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:12,380
The power milk has I can't I don't think it's like area damage. I can't recall if it is or not

225
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,620
Then there's explosives and there's doubt dodgery. Um

226
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,460
Yeah, no, it's yeah, it is legit holo cure

227
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,500
I should play holo cure. I've never played holo cure

228
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,580
Yeah, the flowers put they stay on until I die just freaking fruit fly. Where did you come from?

229
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,180
Did I kill you? I don't even know just flew in front of my screen. Uh, I'm gonna do

230
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
I'm gonna do the critical hit

231
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,140
And then as I continue to kill people I'll be able to get more

232
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Oh, I'm gonna get fucking ganked in here. Hold on

233
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:04,060
Okay, so now oh, it's curses. That's what it is. Well, that's that's the succubus one so I can get

234
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,860
Holo cure is legit a great game if you don't care about the holo life stuff

235
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,260
Oh, no, I don't know why I haven't played holo cure yet

236
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,100
Yeah, okay, so maybe I'll I'll do holo cure at some point

237
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,780
I

238
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,180
Already have my schedule for next week or I would put it up. We're doing all FPS is next week

239
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Um, I don't really care about

240
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,100
that

241
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,980
It's not that good. I'm gonna do my critical rate up because I literally just

242
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,940
Set wanted to get area damage with critical so we'll do that

243
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,420
And then you got like little pumpkins

244
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,300
Oh fuck. Uh, oh fuck. Uh, I forget I can dodge

245
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
And usually I will get

246
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,660
Like my absorption rate up

247
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Uh, so I don't have to be so close

248
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,460
But yeah, they get to me little powers. Oh, it could be this

249
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Tealth

250
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:21,900
Give me those coins baby girl. I don't really need this but yeah

251
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,420
I like the noises that they make when you smack them

252
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:39,180
smack my bitch, uh, okay, so I get it. I like I honestly like the area area, uh attacks because, um

253
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,580
Um

254
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,820
It kind of just helps me back up and I can only always swing back around

255
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,060
Oh god, oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Uh, let's do absorption rate

256
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,820
Because that means that I don't have to get too close

257
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,820
Yeah, I didn't do that. Oh health perfect

258
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,180
And I think area is really good for a first run. Oh fuck me bro

259
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Being ganged up on

260
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,140
I'm accidentally walking into stuff. Um, I get the power up

261
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,500
Again, you could see like when I'm in early stages of the game

262
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,940
It's hard for me to look at chat because I'm just trying to freaking dodge

263
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Let's go over here. Let me look at you guys

264
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,620
Yeah, milk, but yeah, it's milk that boost area

265
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,460
Oh frick bro, please let me live my life

266
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,460
I literally just have to kill enough people I think I don't know

267
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,660
Uh, let's do attack angle

268
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,100
What that's what you guys this is you guys chasing me for after our wedding

269
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Wow

270
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,660
Honestly, I'm not getting the best drops. Oh, let's do

271
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Let's see

272
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,100
Step on them. I'm a gamer. I'm a real gamer. So I'm gonna do oh no milk is the uh

273
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,420
Milk is the the big breasts uh

274
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,460
Hips is area because I've been focusing on area. I'm going to continue with area

275
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,980
I'm so sorry

276
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,540

Yeah, you're good. Don't worry about it. Um, so this is another onslaught which is annoying

279
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Oh

280
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,460
What the hell is that noise?

281
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
I don't like that

282
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:29,900
I don't recognize these enemies to be honest with you. These are new. I wonder if they updated the game recently

283
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,860
Oh, fuck me. Why are you so fast for no reason?

284
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,980
I'm getting ganged up on help help

285
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,460

Like I'm gonna be dying a lot

287
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
in this first bit because

00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,900
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Oh

289
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,940
Oh

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Okay, I gotta go up here to chase the flower

294
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,500
Look at chat. How does healing work? Uh, I literally have to pick up healing

295
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Oh my god, what the frick

296
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,940
Why is this so hard for no reason? I can't even get towards the flower

297
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,700
Brother brother, I may die. Um

298
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,180
Let's see

299
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,780
I'm at absorption. I'm too I'm too close to everything. Jesus

300
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,860
Oh my god, please I'm gonna die. Oh my god, give me this

301
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
I can't even

302
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,380
I'm trying to get to the damn flower. That's all I care about

303
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,540
Oh, damn those could have had health. I'm probably gonna die. Uh, okay

304
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,260
Honestly, because for the first time that was a bad run because I was getting nothing

305
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Yeah, it's fia

306
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700

Make the hat bigger. Oh, we're doing that. All right, I'll make the I'll make the hat bigger

309
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,140

It's gonna take up wow wow ye of bigger of bigger faith of little faith. Okay, so now that

311
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
So now I have achievements

312
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,740
And I can claim that

313
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,980
I don't have any more though. Um, so I can go to upgrades and I can upgrade stuff

314
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,500
So

315
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,260
So I got not I have 342. Welcome. Welcome to harem emotes. Um

316
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,340

317
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,260
So, yeah, you can already see movement speeds pretty high. Uh, I'm gonna do

318
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Item absorption

319
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,540
I'm gonna do attack speed

320
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,780
And

321
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,420
We'll do that. Okay, we don't have to view the story

322
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,860
Is there a bigger hat upgrade there there is not okay, so you got cat girl love potion or hips potion

323
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,500
Or uh succubus potion

324
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Which one would you prefer which path?

325
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,540
Which way western man

326
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,860
Well, actually, you know what I'll do I'll let you guys pick. Um, what?

327
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,220
Uh potions I choose just for some fun stuff

328
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,460
So like at the end of a level when I move up you guys can pick the potion that I choose

329
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,540
Um

330
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,180
Well, they're all technically succubus potions, but that's the more succubus potion

331
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,900
Hips is pretty hot

332
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:36,700
Oh, let me tell you a secret. Um at the end the if I fill up all the hearts with a specific potion

333
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Then I unlock a new form as you guys saw on the splash screen. Yay. V sucky

334
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,940
All right, it's gonna close at 8 34

335
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,340

Run the poll aren't you funny? Well, aren't you funny tipped four dollars and 20 cents

507
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,660
People jury. I may be a simple catorny at poor

508
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:33,580
However, she be cotton boom clearly planned this filter to obstruct the face of this d o p p l e g a n g e r

509
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,700
Of the sweet boy boomie in order to frame him. What?

510
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:43,100
Do you think I made it a doppelganger of boomie? Where would I get a copy?

511
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:47,420
Actually, no, uh, I see his cat looks a lot similar to boomie except he's darker

512
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,700
Blah blah blah backlash. Yeah

513
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
I almost want to call him baklava

514
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,640
Sorry, I'll have to sneeze more cutely

515
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,420
You

516
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:16,940
What the fuck was that was not more cutely. No, I'm dying silly

517
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,020
Blah thank you

518
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,100
Thank you so kindly

519
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,180
I'm not framing him. You guys are liars. You're lying

520
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,140
You're all lying

521
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:45,260
You're all defending a man who shouldn't be defended. He's not even man. He's a cat. I'm gonna check on the tamagotchi while you guys vote

522
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,220
Here play with an angel bell whatever the fuck that is

523
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:05,980
He is like, what are you doing?

524
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:21,980
I don't know who my tamagotchi is hanging out with but they're kind of weird looking that's a cactus

525
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
All right

526
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,820
All right, we're looking at some milk boys. We're looking at milk

527
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,300
So I'll keep this is pretty close

528
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,300
Okay

529
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,940
Boomi has done more crimes than me just killing tamagotches

530
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,100
All right, let's go get that flower

531
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,860
Okay, uh familiar shit is terrible

532
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,780
So I'm going to do the attack power up because familiar shit is terrible. I'll tell you that right now

533
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,940
Uh 10 percent additional area damage damage taken by the witches halved and reflected to the enemy. I like that

534
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:34,460
Um, this is pretty good too camomile, but I'll do that because it's probably pretty handy early early game

535
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,060
Oh my god

536
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,620
Oh

537
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,740
Please don't tell me it's just gonna only give me freaking familiar shit

538
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:00,140
Did I click cackerel or the or the milk? Why am I getting these suggestions?

539
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:12,380
Let's get these absorption rates, baby girl

540
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,980
Give me the pumpkin

541
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,700
What's that like skit from like snl it's like I'm sh pumpkin

542
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,620
Ever get how it goes, but I always thought it was stupidly funny like I didn't get the jokes at all

543
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,620
But I just don't know why I thought it was funny

544
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,660
Let's do

545
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:49,020
Tamagotchi is yearning for death. You want to feel it just wants to eat to survive. Yeah, she's just trying to live

546
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,900
Tamagotchies aren't real

547
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,940
Fia is you're just invalidating my cat's struggle

548
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,860
Oh, let's do absorption rate

549
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,860
I have something I wish I could turn

550
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,780
Literally absorption is god tier

551
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,860
Please turn thank you

552
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,060
Give me that pumpkin

553
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:38,220
Oh, please don't tell me it's literally to give you familiar stuff cat food dispenser my beloved

554
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,620
David pumpkins it was

555
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,740
I don't know

556
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:51,100
Up J for pumpkins, I just thought it was like Tom Hanks his voice is funny and I don't even like Tom Hanks. It was just funny

557
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,740
You know what I'm gonna have some almonds

558
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,860
Are you invalidating your child's existence?

559
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,380
Perhaps

560
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,180
My children will for you two guys. Okay, understandable

561
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:15,580
You can't have an almond

562
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,420
But I will give you treats later

563
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
I think just unlucky

564
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:42,540
This is a better run though because I'm like getting more stuff. Hello

565
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,660
That was difficult

566
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:55,740
Okay, we're doing so now I saw I didn't do anything with familiar magic. So

567
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,380
The big boobah is

568
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,540
Oh

569
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,900
And now I have some explosion stuff and then it'll start dropping that to me

570
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,900
You know, you cannot donate money to boomy specifically

571
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,500
The gains I know right

572
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,300
Okay, let's do time attack

573
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,980
So hopefully we pick up better stuff

574
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,420
Ow

575
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,860
This is oh frick me bro

576
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,940
I wish I could aim

577
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,140
Ow

578
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:10,780
Oh my god, it's literally only giving me familiar stuff. I well, it's whatever

579
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:18,540
Because what makes the game is really like your power-ups, but it's literally just not giving me that hopefully

580
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:24,300
Okay, let me skirt on over real fast to the freaking flower

581
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,020
I'm just gonna eat this. I'm just gonna eat this. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine

582
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:35,020
I just can't let them corral me in the wrong direction

583
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:43,740
Yep, see it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Please flower flower. I just want the flower. I just want the flower

584
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,660
It's over here

585
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,620
Let's go. Okay

586
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,660
I don't have area damage, um

587
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:02,940
Additional explosion damage, I guess that would be helpful like if I could get some

588
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,420
Explosion stuff bribery for

589
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:14,380
Aw josh, thank you for the big super god damn bribery for boomy. How dare you?

590
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,500
Familiaries calling me you're not picking up the phone. Thank you for the super

591
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,340
Don't thumbs it up. Don't bribe boomy

592
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,060
Don't do it

593
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,740
What

594
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,180
Maybe I'll buy a boomy the happy meal that has hello kitty and yugioh

595
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,020
Um

596
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:45,580
I haven't been getting any explosion damage. So I'm going to do the iris just so I can have another

597
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,460
Form of attack just to save my ass right now

598
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:59,260
Because lately I I don't have I'm not getting anything

599
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,340
Tack radius up

600
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:21,980
That's very helpful. Oh, let me get over here. Oh, see you see how the good this is the absorption radius is helpful

601
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,860
Fuck the familiars, dude

602
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:41,420
Can I please get better besides familiars I can't even do the freaking thing

603
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,460
Well

604
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,260
Do I do beast level I

605
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,740
Assemble

606
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,900
I don't know corruption

607
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:09,660
Corruption is the uh, the suck like the real succubus magic. Yeah, let's do let's do

608
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,060
Corruption

609
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,940
Oh, I never noticed she got horns before

610
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,220
That's cute

611
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:27,260
What it's what's important is to like keep on to the thing, but it didn't want to give me it again

612
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:34,860
Bumi's thoughts tipped four dollars and 20 cents Bumi's thoughts finally some contribution around here to help with my suffering

613
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,980
Oh my god, I will save enough to rule this place. Oh my gosh. He better not

614
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:44,540
He's eating food right now, but that's that sounds pretty accurate to what he would be thinking

615
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,820
Oh my god help

616
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,620
What

617
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,220
It literally this is terrible why is it only giving me familiar stuff

618
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:09,100
Like they are the weakest in the game. I never ever play with that, but I'm being forced to

619
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,940
Usually it gives you like some other suggestion by now

620
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,780
Oh, this is a bad way

621
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:34,860
Oh my god, I was hoping to get I don't know I don't know what that does but let's try it

01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,860
Please

623
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,460
For the love of god

624
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:59,340
It sounds like so I like I really wonder who did the the sound effects for this because they're so funny to me

625
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,540
Oh my gosh

626
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,860

01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,700
Because of my stupid things

Help why is this flower so far away? It's right there. Please

634
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:58,700
Okay, okay, I'll be looping we looping we're looping we're looping

636
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,620
Oh perfect finally, um

637
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,900
Addition to Dan move I don't I'm not using familiars

638
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:16,860
Explosion magic has a 20% I haven't gotten any explosion magic

639
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,420
Haiti here

640
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:30,380
Okay, so I can go big booba or corruption I'll have I'll have you guys vote

641
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,380
I

642
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,700
I'm gonna have some almonds

643
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,380
Can we get both no, sorry

644
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,660
I

645
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,420
Although technically I won't unlock anything this run

646
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,020
Because it's only five levels

647
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,620
They're both good choices

648
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,660
I

649
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,180
Booba it is

650
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:51,340
I'm almost on the almonds. Why is milk explosion? I don't know you tell me

651
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:06,060
I hope I like me even more now

652
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:17,580
It's so weird though, it shouldn't be giving me familiar stuff it shouldn't be dropping me familiar stuff that doesn't make any sense

653
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,940
She's getting married right now. She's getting married to you

654
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,620
I have a boss fight

655
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,460
Oh no, I lost an almond no

656
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,420
I'm close to death

657
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,100
I'm trying to find a pumpkin

658
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,660
I'm dead

659
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,980
That was funny

660
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,420
Okay

661
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,420
I

662
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:33,180
Got some upgrades, um

663
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:41,340
Just get some more attack power attack radius more health. Let's do it

664
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:49,420
Again just like just like I wrote oh my freaking god rena

665
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:55,100
What just happened what is leave her alone

666
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:02,140
Reina just ran over to me out of like fearfully trying to escape boomi

667
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,980
Kind of make the hat bigger you're right

668
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:16,380
Reina, I'm sorry. I can't have you on me right now. He's gotta let go of my arm

669
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,060
I

670
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,380
Think it's reina giving me allergies right now

671
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:30,380
I need to I need to brush her and wipe her down with and I usually spray the cats with like a anti

672
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,420
Standard thing. I haven't done that for rena in a bit. This almond is huge

673
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,580
It's huge it's huge

674
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:45,820
It's a big almond dude. Holy crap. See in the shit

675
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,820
Booby's not overpowering rena

676
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,740
It's the fact he just keeps annoying her and she gets pissed so she runs over to me

677
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,900
Almond thick like madam

678
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,860
Wait asked me myself bigger

679
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:26,620
Only rena gives me allergies. It's really funny

680
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:45,980
Reptiles are cool. It's funny. I said I told myself when I move out I get snakes, but I never did

681
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,580
Now I think

682
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:57,180
I would definitely I still I would definitely be able to have time to like take care of like snakes or like some sort of spider

683
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:10,540
I gave you salmonella. Oh my god. I was getting ball pythons. They're simple or like some hog noses

684
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,860
I

685
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:17,740
Have some really pretty morphs. I like lavender super condos

686
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,500
I like lavender snakes are pretty

687
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:38,220
Crazy snake lady significantly more metal. Okay, we got milk

688
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:46,540
Uh, I forget what this one is. I think that's like skinny. I need tissue. Sorry for you

689
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,500
Pac-Man toes. Yeah, they're pretty goofy looking

690
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,580
I do like tarantulas

691
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,980
tarantulas are pretty

692
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,060
I know emmy has some

693
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,060
Her husband, I don't know

694
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,060
And she has rats

695
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:13,980
I think my cats would eat the rats though a little boomy. Yeah, my rena and pio would be fine with rats

696
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,220
Like they'd be perfectly normal

697
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,180
Boomi would kill it

698
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,420
Oh no

699
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,220
Yeah, I can't remember what type of type of tarantula she has

700
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:31,340
I think it's a pink toe. I don't think it is. Maybe. I don't know. I have to ask her

701
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,060
I

702
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,820
Smell of cats would stress out the rats intensely. Is that

703
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,700
True because like I've seen

704
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,940
cats and rats coexist

705
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,940
Boomi gives of orange cat energy

706
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,940
I think he is part orange cat because he has this patch of orange on his nose

707
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:57,740
I like pink toes. They're pretty. I like the heart butt ones ever get their names are

708
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,220
How would you be terrified of emmy?

709
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:05,660
She's just a sweet girl. She's just a sweet sister. Which one should I pick?

710
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,860
How

711
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,660
Milk or cat girl or this potion? I don't feel like riding another pole

712
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:20,860
I won't miss summer ween. I clean up a warehouse side store for living. It's only august and skelton is already

713
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,420
Here

714
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:30,540
Milk okay, we'll do milk or milk too. Does it matter? I'm just gonna

715
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,060
Oh, I didn't mean to pick that fuck

716
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,740
I was trying to

717
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,380
Well

718
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:45,340
I meant to pick the like milk too because I was just switching between them really fast

719
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:55,260
Oh, let's get the flower

720
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,620
So I'm gonna be

721
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,060
Let's do the freeze

722
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,820
Is that a bee

723
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:16,140
Hi, I'm michael spelled with the with the bee

724
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,140
But the bee is silent

725
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,500
Where's the bee there's a bee

726
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,100
Okay magic missile is pretty good

727
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:41,100
It's pretty simple. You can't go wrong with magic missile. Oh, we're gonna prick it. We're doing everything bro

728
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,980
Oh, shit

729
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:48,620
If I could look the right way that would be great

730
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:57,260
Okay, there we go

731
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:07,660
It's good to like early game get them get stuff, but only works if you have good drops

732
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,820
See now I'm fricking wrecking

733
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,420

01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:15,100
It's like we they definitely updated stuff because the attack speed up thing was not a thing before

744
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,060
It's great now. I gotta fight a boss

01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:28,860
I

848
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,900
At this point, I don't need like regular bouquet stuff. So

849
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:48,140
You spin me right around maybe this is my absorption rate is so important if you do it early on early game. It's perfect

850
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,700
I

851
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:58,300
Starting college cool when a day trip to the beach

852
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:03,100
Running errands cool. It's been closed all week deep cleaning. Oh, that stinks

853
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,860
That's a bummer. It's got back from a baby shower. Oh, congrats to whomever

854
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,300
I

855
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,540
Really train

856
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,580
Well, if you need some sleep get some sleep

857
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:30,380
Oh my god, who is between my legs? I don't this is boomy

858
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:33,420

859
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:35,660
No, rena's rena's softer than boomy

860
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,300
This is this is boomy

861
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,460
Boomy has like rougher for

862
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,500
No, don't give me that look I'm talking about my fucking cats

863
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:54,700
You took a shower good because you smell. Um, can I be with you? Oh, can I be between them? You guys are so funny

864
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:02,540
Playing video game. Nice. What you playing? You just bought 2k bonds. I don't know what that means

865
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:06,460
Like 2k and like actual like money bonds or

866
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,820
Oh

867
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,780
Let's let's clean up magic arrow. Let's finish that out

868
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:22,700
Oh, shitty. Oh, brother. Where's the flower? All right, clear the way. Let's go

869
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:36,700
I could use some health that would be pretty nice

870
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:50,540
Oh shoot straight ahead motherfucker

871
01:31:54,940 --> 01:32:01,980
Uh, that actually might be a little helpful to not pull back there's a freaking flower

872
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,220
Are you serious?

873
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,460
Oh

874
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,220
Oh my god, it literally wants me to pick everything but

875
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,820
Well, maybe it was a bigger again. Oh snap

876
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,140
Psyop and chat there's a Psyop

877
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,780
Hello, my fellow youngsters, whatever you'd like to participate in this

878
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,820
I'm not a cah

879
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:37,500
Play black myth wukong. Oh, okay. I literally I have to get that game then

880
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,220
I've heard so much good things about black myth wukong

881
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:44,540
What an age game this is it's not an age game

882
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:48,780
It's literally we're just I'm just a witch and I'm getting married

883
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:52,140
You know

884
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,860
You know

885
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,820
All right, now we got a boss battle

886
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:01,660
We're gonna fight Megara

887
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:05,900
I honestly wish this game had more bosses

888
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,020
I'm not gonna lie. I wish there was a boss based off all the body types

889
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:12,220
That's what I thought it was when you were first fighting

890
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:15,500
I thought you were fighting like uh, like the corruption one

891
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:18,460
And I thought I would have to fight like a cat girl one

892
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,820
Yeah, it's edgy

893
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,540
What why did my body return to normal

894
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,100
Huh

895
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:36,380
Why have it returned here? Oh wait, she doesn't really look like that kind of voice

896
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,140
Why have you returned here?

897
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,660
You've already found your soulmate and can live

898
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:48,540
peacefully for now on for what purpose do you trespass on my territory?

899
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:51,100
Territory I'm British now

900
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,660
Oh grandma long time no see

901
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,540
She looks like

902
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,860
Oh, bye lolly. Did you miss me?

903
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:06,460
Yeah, she looks she looks like Albury. Why did my body return to normal? Did you do this?

904
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:12,700
Yes, your body changing in the first place was due to my power after all. I simply took back what was mine

905
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:17,660
Are you aware of how many men it requires to reduce the potions you've gobbled up?

906
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,860
Oh, don't be so selfish. I know a succubus like you can fill them up again in no time

907
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:27,100
Can't you spare just a few for me as a wedding gift grandma?

908
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,420
Stealing from me and then demanding gifts afterwards. How utterly brazen

909
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,460
And do stop calling me grandma, would you?

910
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:42,940
After all I've stayed youthful due to absorbing men's vitality physically. I'm even younger than you now

911
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,540
Right, right grandma. So the gifts

912
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:52,940
Haha, you know, I once thought that I might kill you one day, but I believe I've changed my mind

913
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:57,580
I think I'll simply capture you right here now and make you my slave for life

914
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,980
Wow, she's really me coded

915
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:07,180
Boomi is laying on my feet. He's laying on my footrest on my feet

916
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:11,180
Ma'am, I mean sir, what are you?

917
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,340
What are you doing?

918
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:23,820
Boo, your chest might be big but your heart is still so small. I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson

919
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,060
Oh

920
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,620
My god

921
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:33,340
She wearing oh, she's shooting crap at me

922
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:44,620
Let's go in a circle and I should be good. Oh wait, uh

923
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:53,500
Let me see if I can catch her in the area of effect. Oh really doesn't even turn

924
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,820
What's that? Gib

925
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,260
Can I get like some help?

926
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,500
Can you shoot at her motherfucker? Stop shooting at them

927
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,860
What is that even

928
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:25,420
To smash

929
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,900
Hit her just punch her

930
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,580
Oh my god, what the hell

931
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,420
Die thank god

932
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:52,460
Oh what

933
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:59,340
What the hell I had to defeat your little buddy first. I don't remember that

934
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,860
What the fuck is going on?

935
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:11,740
Second phase uh butterfly whatever will I fucking do?

936
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:20,140
Are you whipping me with your fucking hair? What's happening here?

937
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,220
Don't give me that thank you very much

938
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,740
What the fuck is that? Oh

939
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,940
Oh, let's do that

940
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,220
Ha ha dive bitches

941
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:52,860
Now if only let me go find she's fine. She's fine where she is

942
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,660
Let's go see if we can find the pumpkin that has the thing in it

943
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:00,540
Because then I can suck all that stuff towards me

944
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:08,140
Uh, oh, there's she teleported perfect

945
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,700
Hell yeah

946
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:20,220
Oh

947
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:37,740
This is the run boys we got this unlock brother

948
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:45,660
Unlock where is she? Oh, she's behind me. No, she's not fucking those butterflies for

949
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,380
Ah, that's what they're for

950
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:59,340
No, can I kill her already?

951
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:10,620
Oh my god, she's whipping her hair back and forth willow smith style just die shoot at her not at them

952
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:13,740
Please thank you

953
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:20,380
She fucking clipped and then just fell on the ground

954
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:32,860
The witch defeats the succubus queen and completes the ultimate potion with the queen's help

955
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,180
And so the long-awaited wedding day arrives

956
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:42,860
First try let's go look at

957
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,900
Oh

958
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:55,420
We killed her no, I'm kidding. No, we just made her we just made her do stuff for us

959
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:06,220
Sus on the left, what do you mean? There's no sussiness

960
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:13,260
We got married

961
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,300
We got married

962
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,980
Oh

963
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:25,660
Oh a little bit of but fang we love to see it

964
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:29,340
I love me some but fang

965
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:34,940
She'd be never followed up, but saw you listen to the artillery ambience. What do you think of it?

966
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:39,580
Also nice drunk early. I thought it was really funny because I was I couldn't take it seriously

967
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:48,220
Yeah, it's a normal ending. I didn't get any of the the body types, but it's hard to do it the first run anyways

968
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,620
Uh, let's go

969
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,380
Let's get some upgrades

970
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,700
Time to go

971
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:07,020
One more option when leveling up I do like that

972
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:11,580
So

973
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:29,020
Let's just make sure we have one of each actually

974
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:43,420
That's the only one I can't afford oh and that one too

975
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:55,180
More familiar I imagine I just get all familiar upgrades

976
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,260
Oh

977
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:03,500
I didn't even buy that but I guess that worked out meant to click the back button

978
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:11,020
So now I have hard mode so it's six stages and then stronger potions will appear

979
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:18,060
Um, so I think it's like two instead of um three. I mean just one two hearts instead of one

980
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:28,380
Oh, we got some op we literally have almost everything here when you can see we get more potions you see that

981
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:31,100
I

982
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,780
Don't have five poles

983
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:41,100
Um, so there's corruption

984
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:45,820
Again, I like consistency

985
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:51,420
So I'm trying to see which path is the most consistent. It seems like the corruption path is

986
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:53,420
Because

987
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:58,300
We have more chance of getting okay, so I might do the corruption

988
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,260
Potion seller I can handle the potions

989
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:06,460
I'm going into battle and I need your strongest potions

990
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:11,420
Like five. Oh, yeah, sorry. I only have one

991
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:16,060
How many holes do I have? I don't know how many holes do people have?

992
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:19,740
So the enemies are gonna be a lot harder

993
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:23,980
Oh

994
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:29,580
Sunburst oh my god sunburst is so fucking good. I'm actually happy. This is perfect for this run

995
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:36,300
Oh, lovely. I love this. Uh, can I get oh dammit? I wish I got absorption rate

996
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,380
I fucking love sunburst

997
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:56,460
Flower let's go hurry. Is there only a minute to get over there?

998
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,660
Yeah

999
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:04,540
Oh my god, I'm stuck in the freaking tree. What is this?

1000
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:12,220
Okay, oh 25 area magic damage. Let's go. Let's go

1001
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:17,740
Is area magic gonna be the fucking move? I don't know

1002
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,740
No

1003
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:23,180
Death ray

1004
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,500
Damn buddy, um

1005
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:29,980
Yeah, oh my god

1006
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:35,500
Fucking fuzro dying their ass. I forgot about that. It does that

1007
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:44,940
Ah, welcome to memba

1008
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:46,940
Ah

1009
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,100
Thanks, welcome

1010
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,940
I hope you'll enjoy your stay. Why is that thing pissing? Did you see that?

1011
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:58,540
Why is it? Oh, it's cursed. I have my it's a peeler curse

1012
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:06,220
Get peelered. Oh, let's see absorption radius

1013
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:13,260
Oh my god, Jesus christ, uh help help help

1014
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:23,980
Raise that and let nobody get near me cannot be allowed. So you see how fucking sick this is?

1015

1173
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:44,380
It's quite insane

1174
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:48,700
And my mom really likes to garden my mom's a gardener and my dad is a bourbon collector

1175
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:50,540
Um

1176
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:55,180
But the baconator that's literally what my dad asks for are you my dad? Hello? Is dad in the chat?

1177
01:57:55,980 --> 01:58:01,020
My dad always as like last time I talked to him. He's like so when are you gonna have me on your stream? I'm like

1178
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:04,460
When you don't say my government name

1179
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,100
If you could call me she be that would be great

1180
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:13,020
Um, I probably record it. I want to do the recording of like

1181
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:15,740
I think scrawny already did it where

1182
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:18,780
Her dad gets the vtubers

1183
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:21,020
You had a baconator today. Yeah

1184
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:23,260
She'd be dad in chat

1185
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:27,980
Um, my parents. Yeah, my parents know about vtubing. My dad understands that more than my mom

1186
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:30,060
My mom just tells people I'm a voice actress

1187
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,820
but my dad is a gamer and he likes to watch twitch and

1188
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:39,100
Um, yeah, he watches a lot of twitch streamers. I won't be surprised if my dad got into vtubers because of me

1189
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:44,620
I think he's seen a couple before. I think he's watched iron mouse because she's you know, always huge on twitch

1190
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:46,860
um

1191
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:52,140
My parents are pretty hip. I can't really get anything past them. So when they asked me are you gonna be doing adult content?

1192
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:54,220
I was like, yeah

1193
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:56,700
I'm not gonna lie to you

1194
01:58:57,020 --> 01:59:00,540
They're like, okay. Just don't tell us the details. Uh, but run us that check

1195
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:05,340
My dad was like, hey since you're you're

1196
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,980
since technically like

1197
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:13,100
I gave you your voice acting ability because I like I make funny voices and you copied me

1198
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:15,980
Like I think I should take a cut. I'm like dad. No

1199
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:25,020
My dad literally was like, you know, like I helped create you and my mom's just like barely but okay

1200
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:34,780
You tell them. Yeah, fam. I'm gonna be goon and no cat for a friend. My dad knows what that means

1201
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:41,180
So does my mom. My parents are very hip. My parents are young. They didn't have me young. Don't get me wrong. My parents, um

1202
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:45,660
But they're like they they keep up with the times because they're annoying

1203
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:48,700
I wish they wouldn't so I could get past stuff past them

1204
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:54,700
You know what my I already told you like I don't I've told the story before

1205
01:59:55,660 --> 02:00:02,460
56 I know my parents are in their 70s. They're pretty young. They had me they had me pretty young. Um, and um

1206
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:09,100
Honestly not that young but I'll be young by today's standards. I think um

1207
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:13,100
My parents didn't have me when they were like 16. Do not don't get it twisted

1208
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:16,460
Don't don't don't get it twisted. Um

1209
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:19,420
Oh, yeah, no, my mom loves tiktok. So does my dad

1210
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:24,220
Uh, my dad when I told him I was a vtuber when I started vtubing

1211
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:28,540
He was just like, are you one of those vtuber hentai waifus? And I'm like

1212
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:32,140
This is before I was in v alert. I'm like dad. No

1213
02:00:33,580 --> 02:00:37,340
Does your dad have an ohshi? I am my dad's ohshi. You know, my mom's ohshi

1214
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:40,540
Of course, I'm their child. Of course, they're gonna ohshi me

1215
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:44,060
My dad has no shame facts

1216
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:50,060
I regret my my dad will sometimes I like had friends over at one point. Um

1217
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:53,020
For like because my parents

1218
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:59,660
Oh my goodness

1219
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:05,260
I need to see this again

1220
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:08,300
Oh, it's not coming out. Thank you

1221
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:14,060
My dad is hilarious. You guys will like if I ever record a video with him, you guys will literally lose it

1222
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:17,580
Because my dad is very like

1223
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:23,420
I don't know. He's just a cool guy like I need to have my friends over. They're like, how's your dad?

1224
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:25,660
I'm like, I'm here. I'm the one who invited you

1225
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:29,180
They're like, yeah, but your dad I'm like

1226
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:32,220
And then my mom's just like what about me

1227
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:37,180
But my mom is like my mom is more I think because my dad is very like kid-ish

1228
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:39,980
And my mom is more like, you know a grown-up

1229
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:48,700
Because my mom would always make the jokes. She's like, I swear I'm raising two children because you and your dad like argue like brother and sister

1230
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:53,020
Does your dad

1231
02:01:55,900 --> 02:02:01,900
Oh, what kind of question is that? Yes. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. He's just not again. My parents are christians

1232
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:06,140
I already told you the only the one time

1233
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:12,300
My dad when my dad will say like, you know, my if you guys don't know if you're new here

1234
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:15,820
Hi, my name is she be con bum. I am biracial. My dad is black. My mom is white

1235
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:20,940
And I've told the story of me and my dad trying to bully my mom into saying the n-word as a joke

1236
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:29,820
And she did not because my mom's a real one. Um, and she never ever has never in her life

1237
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:36,220
Because she's cool. Um, but my my dad will be my dad's pretty

1238
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:40,460
My dad is very, uh

1239
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:47,660
Like my dad doesn't sound like hood or gangster or like whatever because the people like might assume just because he's black

1240
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:50,060
my dad is very like

1241
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,700
Very professional and just like goofy dude

1242
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:58,540
He's very like it's funny because my mom is also like mom jokes

1243
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:03,020
Like my mom like will make like, you know, like dad jokes. My mom was mostly does that like my mom loves puns

1244
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:06,540
Um, yeah, he's my dad's very articulate

1245
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:10,620
I'm not gonna say my dad talks white because that's fucking stupid. I hate that expression

1246
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:12,860
um

1247
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:17,740
But like my dad's a very I I do give a lot of credit to my dad and my mom for

1248
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:21,500
Teaching me how to speak like being a well-spoken person

1249
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:27,420
Because like with church like we had to do like speaking things and like when I went to like church school and stuff

1250
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:34,220
Um, and I had to like read bible passages if I was raised christian. I'm not now and my parents are aware of that. Um

1251
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:42,380
And uh, so like I my dad and my mom like drilled like stuff into me just to be a good speaker

1252
02:03:42,780 --> 02:03:44,140
um

1253
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:49,900
And at one point I was like very particular and very like nitpicky with how I spoke

1254
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:55,420
But now I don't really care anymore. Um, I'm kind of I talk more naturally because before I used to be like

1255
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:58,380
very transatlantic like news person accent

1256
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:02,220
Does your dad have an accent and you grow up here and lose it?

1257
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:08,140
Um, no, my dad does not have an accent. My dad was born in Haiti, but he immigrated but early enough

1258
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:13,580
That he didn't have an accent, but he did for a little bit and then he grew out of it

1259
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:19,740
Um, and then because like it was really hard for him growing up because he had to

1260
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:22,940
obviously learning english. English is a very hard language

1261
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:25,020
um

1262
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:27,020
And so that's why he's like super

1263
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:32,460
Particular but pronunciation because he worked so hard to learn english properly and that if I say

1264
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:34,780
nuclear

1265
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:36,940
And not nuclear he will freak out

1266
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:44,940
And sometimes I say it wrong on purpose. It's not nuclear. It's nuclear and I'm like, okay, dad

1267
02:04:46,540 --> 02:04:48,540
Um

1268
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:51,660
Read the bible with your prayer. Yeah

1269
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,660
No, don't eat that

1270
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:58,700
Nuclear yeah

1271
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:00,220
yeah

1272
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:03,100
Yeah, it's like he my dad was very like particular

1273
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:08,620
And my mom my mom has always been like a very well-spoken woman. My mom is very business sense. My mom is honestly

1274
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:11,420
It's funny when I showed her I showed my mom my lore video

1275
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,660
And she was just like wow, this is so me and I'm like mom

1276
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:21,500
Because my mom worked in a very corporate environment. She was snubbed for a lot of stuff being a woman

1277
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:23,180
um

1278
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:27,180
She if honestly if my mom went to college, she'd be running a fortune 500 company right now

1279
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:33,020
She is so badass. My mom is ambitious and crazy and awesome and I look up to her so much

1280
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:37,260
Um, did you learn krayle? No, I don't speak krayle. My dad never spoke krayle with me

1281
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:43,820
I know a couple words and I took french so I could understand a little bit, but I don't I don't really speak krayle

1282
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:48,940
And it's funny. My grandmother says my dad speaks krayle crap like not that good anyways

1283
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:52,620
She's like my she's like my dad speaks krayle with an accent now

1284
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:55,820
And when when he's far away from them

1285
02:05:56,460 --> 02:06:00,060
Because he spoke it a lot more my grandparents live like you guys know in florida

1286
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:01,980
um

1287
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:06,140
So they they live farther away. So my dad doesn't have the opportunity to speak krayle as often

1288
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:10,940
Um, like I have my cousins and stuff on my dad's side that speak krayle, but we haven't seen them in a bit

1289
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:15,180
Have your parents asked to open to the triple

1290
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:18,380
Because you might why would my dad speak japanese?

1291
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:21,100
My dad would probably be like hi watashi wa

1292
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:27,340
Verdacted like my dad would probably say that I have to come up with a name for my dad and my mom

1293
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:34,460
Secret names actually I'll let them pick their own names when I see them tomorrow. I'll talk to them about it

1294
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:41,660
Uh, my parents will never be open to a throttle because they're christian as hell

1295
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:44,620
Oh

1296
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:48,060
Although like it's funny. They're like they're cool christians

1297
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:52,540
Papa mama shibi sounds good enough

1298
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:58,140
Papa no, they would they would want like my dad will probably want to be called by his like gamer tag or something stupid

1299
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:01,420
Which is like his get my dad's gamer tag is like, um

1300
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:04,380
Like every

1301
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:07,580
I'll tell you like the word it consists of because nobody's gonna find it

1302
02:07:07,660 --> 02:07:13,820
But it's like just like how strawney like has her dad's name as her as her dad's gamer tag as her name

1303
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:17,660
My dad's um part of my dad's gamer tag is salvation

1304
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:26,220
And so like when he would kill people like he'd be like, oh i'm your salvation. I'm like bitch stop

1305
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:31,980
I'm like dad and then like my dad's clan was called ill

1306
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:34,780
exclamation point ll

1307
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:38,300
for for call of duty

1308
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:42,780
So I might have him be like sal and then my mom

1309
02:07:42,940 --> 02:07:48,300
I don't know. I have to I probably call her by like one of her favorite flowers, which is like I'll probably call her dahlia

1310
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,180
mama dahlia and papa sal

1311
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:58,860
My dad's pretty my dad's pretty cool and my mom's pretty awesome as well

1312
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:03,340
My mom is the type of woman that like all little girls would have looked up to

1313
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:07,820
And my dad's just like a cool guy to hang out with like my dad's just pretty chill. And so is my mom

1314
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:10,860
My parents are pretty funny

1315
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:15,020
Salvation is on a killing spree

1316
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:18,140
hat trick

1317
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:25,740
But yeah, and uh, I'm pretty close to my parents in real like I've always got well not always because you know growing up and

1318
02:08:26,700 --> 02:08:28,700
Like I was a shitty as teenager

1319
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:30,460
um, but

1320
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:32,460
Like, uh, I'm an only child

1321
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:37,820
Like kayfaba side. I'm an only child. So I'm pretty close to my parents. And so I'm pretty I'm pretty open and honest with them

1322
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:41,420
So I've it's funny people are like, do you have a do you have a dad?

1323
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:46,220
Like do you have a bad relationship with your parents because you do this job? No, my parent my relationship with my parents is amazing

1324
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:48,940
Actually, I love my parents to death. I would do anything for them

1325
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:55,180
Dahlia is a cute name human wise. It is really cute. Sal and his gal dahl. Oh my gosh. I think they would like that

1326
02:08:56,700 --> 02:09:02,380
I think I'll I think I'll tell them those are I'm sorry. He's here or your internet persona names. I've chosen them for you

1327
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:08,300
So Chuni, my dad is very Chuni

1328
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:13,420
Seems like everyone viewers good related facts like that's not even wrong

1329
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:17,580
Like that's so we all have good really real pretty fine with our parents

1330
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:22,060
But like I will say like for Azura, um, it's like

1331
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:24,620
like, uh

1332
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:27,580
The best thing you can do is move out of your parents house

1333
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:30,220
Because like you can have a great relationship with them

1334
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:32,940
But when you're older and you're around them all the time and you want to do your own thing

1335
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:35,580
It's like annoying. So it's really good that she she needs to get out of that place

1336
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:37,260
um

1337
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:40,060
Sometimes her mom just comes in when she's recording and she's just like, uh

1338
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:46,220
It's only fair they give you your name. Yeah, I gotta name him back

1339
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,580
Kind of name him back

1340
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:52,060
But uh, that's yeah, it's a little bit about my parents

1341
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:55,020
They're pretty neat

1342
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:57,020
Wish I could move out. I know I saved a lot

1343
02:09:57,660 --> 02:09:59,660
I was thankful because my my mom

1344
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:02,300
I was paying rent and my mom surprised me

1345
02:10:03,180 --> 02:10:05,740
And said that my rent money was actually going towards

1346
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:10,060
To buy an apartment and so I was like so happy she like organized that

1347
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:14,860
And so she like handed me like a good chunk of change from like a couple years and was like, here you go

1348
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:17,260
Here's your first and last and I was like, holy crap, mother

1349
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:20,300
And then my mom is the one who also was able to help me

1350
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:24,460
Apply for the housing lottery because like I made enough money

1351
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:28,540
But like I didn't make enough money to like survive by myself like I would have had to get a roommate

1352
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:31,900
And I'm happy I never did and my mom didn't want me to have a roommate

1353
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:38,300
Um, so I applied for affordable housing lottery in my area. So I would have like just reduced rent. It doesn't like

1354
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:43,580
Um guys, I don't live in the fucking ghetto. Okay, if people were just like, oh, she's on section eight

1355
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:46,140
No, bitch, and that's fine section eight is okay

1356
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:52,220
Like we people need shit. It's a lot like you should have showed up people for having that stuff. Um

1357
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:59,180
But yeah, so like my however housing is reduced like normally my rent would be like 2400 $2,600

1358
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:01,580
But it's thankfully 1500 although

1359
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:08,780
I don't know if I'm gonna be staying this place that much longer because they are really on down my throat because I'm now a vtuber

1360
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:12,940
About like how much money I'm making so it's um, and I'm trying to like organize it all

1361
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:16,940
And they also need some information for my last place of work. So I have to go back to work

1362
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:20,380
um

1363
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:22,380
Yeah, no like I never

1364
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:24,380
I never lived in the project

1365
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:26,300
um

1366
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:28,300
Yeah, no, it's like so I applied

1367
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:32,860
For the lottery and like like filled everything out and then they selected me

1368
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:35,420
And then I still had to apply for the housing

1369
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:40,380
Like the actual apartment and I could have gotten denied if they could have just denied me

1370
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:45,580
And so I would have had I had to go through two like things to get into my apartment building

1371
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:50,860
My apartment's really nice. Like I have like a gym. We have a pool. We have like like

1372
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:55,180
uh, a cool like hangout area and like, um

1373
02:11:56,300 --> 02:12:01,180
Like computer rooms and stuff like it's pretty nice and it's like it's a nice building

1374
02:12:02,140 --> 02:12:03,980
and I have um

1375
02:12:03,980 --> 02:12:06,220
Pretty pretty okay neighbors. Um

1376
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:09,260
And they accept animals

1377
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:12,460
But they have pet rent, which is stupid. Pet rent is a fucking scam

1378
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:21,900
But yeah, no my my like honestly my goal is really just to buy a house

1379
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:24,300
Like that would just be awesome

1380
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:27,660
I don't know where I would move to though. I like I want to be close to my parents

1381
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:31,260
But the rate of the cost of living in new england is ridiculous

1382
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:36,620
Excuse me if you look at like new york or boston or like

1383
02:12:37,180 --> 02:12:39,180
Hartford or I'm trying to think or like

1384
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:42,300
Portsmouth main or like a bunch of

1385
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,100
It's like ridiculous

1386
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:47,260
Yeah, pet rent is a thing. It's it's it's a scam

1387
02:12:48,220 --> 02:12:52,780
I have to pay $50 for each cat, but I don't because they don't know that I have more than three

1388
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:54,860
I have more than one cat

1389
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:56,860
Except they did find out that like one of them was there

1390
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:58,060
So I had to pay extra

1391
02:12:58,060 --> 02:13:01,180
But the landlord lady was kind of cool and she was just like, you know what it's fine

1392
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:05,580
I like simies cats and I'm like facts and she also had cats in the group with a simies cat

1393
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:10,060
So she let me only have to pay for two instead of three and technically I'm not supposed to have three cats

1394
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:11,180
I'm only supposed to have two

1395
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:14,060
But then I was like pushing back and I was like girl

1396
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:18,140
I see people with like two dogs and three cats is so like what is this about and she's like, oh

1397
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:21,100
True, you know what whatever

1398
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:25,980
Yeah, new york sucks

1399
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:30,620
I've only been in new york a couple times, but no, thank you

1400
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:37,260
Uh, actually, no, I like I like going to New York City like the like time square is pretty cool

1401
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:47,020
Yeah, like oh my god, like it's so like the cost of everything is so stupid

1402
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:53,100
I was wondering I'm like, should I just bite the bullet and just pay out my full rent because the application process to get

1403
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:55,740
My affordable housing is such a pain, dude

1404
02:13:56,300 --> 02:13:58,300
And I'm like is it even worth it?

1405
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:05,900
But I don't know I think I need any more time to save so I'm gonna try to fill it out. Hopefully they don't frickin deny me

1406
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:09,260
Because then either way I will have to pay like 2400 bucks

1407
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:13,340
I hope I don't have to move to my to a different apartment because that would be fucking annoying

1408
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:17,420
I will actually like probably just move out completely then

1409
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:24,060
Yeah, New York City is probably ridiculous

1410
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:30,220
Yeah, it's a piece to visit not to make it rich and not tonight and everything goes well

1411
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:34,060
Well, like I'll tell like I'll be like I'm obviously like really transparent with you guys

1412
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:40,220
I'll tell you what I'm going to be doing with like, uh, the donothon money I get so a portion will be to pay off of my

1413
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:45,260
Um debt because I ran up credit cards for this lady right here

1414
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:51,660
And myself for my own health issues because I had to put stuff on credit cards and um

1415
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:57,740
So I'll be using stuff for that and then probably and then 3d. That's that's what I want to do 3d

1416
02:14:58,460 --> 02:14:59,740
I'm like

1417
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:01,740
Gee what's happening?

1418
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:03,900
Boomi stop chasing her

1419
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:06,300
That was rena hissing into the mic

1420
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:10,620
Reina, I'm not home base. You can't jump on my desk

1421
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:19,820
Hey, no, she sounds like she's spitting on someone

1422
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:24,060
I

1423
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:29,420
Like I don't abide by it but my area is pretty nice

1424
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:32,140
um

1425
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:37,500
Oh my god, my nose and rena came back up and I just rubbed my nose. Oh, no, I'm gonna be sneezing more

1426
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:42,380
Um, but yeah, no, I would like to do like 3d

1427
02:15:43,020 --> 02:15:47,500
I already have like three projects. I'm working on what I've told you guys about

1428
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:49,740
on a secret

1429
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:51,740
Two I've spoken of

1430
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:53,500
um

1431
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:55,500
Five years ago I was 3k for renting

1432
02:15:57,260 --> 02:16:00,700
Really crazy. No, it's what like 5k

1433
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:08,620
Like that's why I'm it's more it makes more sense to buy a freaking house than to rent right now

1434
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:16,300
Because unless I move to like what what's this? I can't remember the state that has like no

1435
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:18,300
No

1436
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,300
income tax

1437
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:27,180
It's a new Hampshire

1438
02:16:32,060 --> 02:16:38,940
Yeah, like New Hampshire, for example, super tax friendly and make more sense to rent there than to buy a house, but like, um

1439
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:41,500
uh

1440
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:43,020
my god

1441
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:45,420
Tax-free states, bro. Let's just move to a tax-free state

1442
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:48,540
Delaware. Yep

1443
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:52,140
3d blue website, ooh

1444
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:54,940
um

1445
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:58,060
Yeah, how's it doing? I'm probably probably have to move to the south

1446
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:05,420
I'm going to florida now. Okay. I don't florida is too hot. These places are too hot. I would like like

1447
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:08,220
um

1448
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:10,940
Like mid mid east that's not a

1449
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:16,140
Direction, but you kind of why is midwest but there's no mid east make that make sense, huh?

1450
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:22,060
And um

1451
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:26,940
But yeah, it's like the cost of a mortgage is less expensive than rent. So like why

1452
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:34,380
And then I would like want to put like effort and time into a house and like just like strong like me and strongy want like little farms

1453
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:37,340
We just want like to raise animals

1454
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:42,300
Maybe we'll just I maybe me maybe me and strongy will just be gay lovers and we'll just have her

1455
02:17:44,220 --> 02:17:46,220
I'm kidding. I'm kidding

1456
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:50,460
I'm kidding. So no, I'm not moving to the middle. Oh wait, that makes sense

1457
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:02,620
Listen to east coaster. Yeah, like people already people already, um

1458
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:10,380
You know 2k townhouse. Oh my god move to I'm moving to canada. I actually liked canada because I had some um

1459
02:18:10,940 --> 02:18:15,420
When I was a youtube commentator, I had some friends in canada. So I went to visit them

1460
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:17,980
um

1461
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:21,900
I will actually know there wasn't the reason I was I had a I had a bachelorette party

1462
02:18:22,940 --> 02:18:24,220
uh

1463
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:30,380
And we went to matri all and then my friends happened to be there and I was like, oh, let's hit take out. Um

1464
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:32,700
And

1465
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:39,660
Like she was showing me her place and I'm like, why is this so nice and then the air bnb. We stayed in was so nice and then

1466
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:47,420
I was like, can I live with you and she was like, no because you need to like have citizenship and I'm like, but just sneak me in

1467
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:53,660
Never get involved in the land war with asia

1468
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:57,420
One of the classic blunders california is really bad too. Yeah

1469
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:02,940
I'm like, I was like, I don't know. Maybe like washington. That's like across the freaking country

1470
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:07,580
Um, because washington's a lot like new england

1471
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:13,340
Yeah, there's a lot of canadian vtubers and I did not know this

02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:22,060
Uh, what do you mean new england we get nor'easters we get we get rocked by snow brother

1473

1645
02:37:32,700 --> 02:37:36,540
No, no, this hurts. You have a rough tongue, ma'am

1646
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:39,500
I know you're just trying to be nice

1647
02:37:40,060 --> 02:37:42,060
by grooming me

1648
02:37:42,060 --> 02:37:44,060
Because you see me as a giant dumb cat

1649
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:49,740
She's still licking me

1650
02:37:50,620 --> 02:37:52,620
Are you done?

1651
02:37:53,260 --> 02:37:55,260
Ready

1652
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:58,060
Okay, she has my hand now

1653
02:37:59,340 --> 02:38:01,900
She's very thorough. She's making sure I'm clean

1654
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:05,420
I

1655
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:15,660

02:38:20,460 --> 02:38:25,020
Okay, I'm just gonna take that away from you

1657
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:27,020
I

1658
02:38:31,580 --> 02:38:33,580
Say hi to the camera

1659
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:41,100
She looking at ya her sparkly eyes

1660
02:38:43,420 --> 02:38:47,900
She be stinky, uh, probably because I have a shower to like two days for three

1661
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:57,340
Fiat is a Siamese cat mix. She is a

1662
02:38:59,580 --> 02:39:01,580
Uh blue point

1663
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:07,500
Blue sorry lilac links point Siamese

1664
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:11,820
You know, it's really weird

1665
02:39:11,820 --> 02:39:14,860
I don't smell as much now that I haven't shaved my armpits in a while

1666
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:22,380
Like I know I don't sweat as much and it's very interesting to me like I don't smell as bad

1667
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:32,060
Like I don't know I just smell like it doesn't smell bad. It just smells like smell. I don't know how to explain it

1668
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:47,020
Oh my god

1669
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:50,700
Why are you still licking me? Here, let's flip you

Let's flip the baby girl. What are you doing?

1671
02:39:56,620 --> 02:39:58,620
Time to flip her like a pancake

1672
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:04,620
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna do this with the camera on though. Just in case I knock it down

1673
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:08,780
It's time to

1674
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:10,780
eat

1675
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:15,820
There you go

1676
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:22,060
Hi, no you're making it flip like a little pancake

1677
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:24,780

1678
02:40:36,940 --> 02:40:38,940
She has been flipped

1679
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:42,060
And I can pet your butt

1680
02:40:42,060 --> 02:40:44,060
Oh

1681
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:54,300
You see how she opens her mouth when I rub her nose

1682
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:58,700
She gets so happy she's smiling

1683
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:09,580
She is so calm yeah, she's in a giant big fluffy bed like the bed is bigger than it seems

1684
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:19,100
Oh, I don't know if you guys just heard me crack my buddy

1685
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:26,860

1697
02:42:40,700 --> 02:42:42,700
That's because you haven't gotten it yet

1698
02:42:44,140 --> 02:42:46,700
All right, if it gives me familiars, I'll do this stupid familiar

1699
02:42:53,660 --> 02:42:55,660
Well, why'd you give me health?

1702
02:43:06,140 --> 02:43:08,140

1706
02:43:19,660 --> 02:43:21,420
B

1707
02:43:21,420 --> 02:43:23,420
XP

Let's do is there speed no angle range

1710
02:43:45,020 --> 02:43:48,700
Oh my god, what the hell oh fucking familiar

1711
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:57,180
What the hell is that noise miss what does that even fucking mean?

02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:14,140
Just

1715
02:44:23,660 --> 02:44:30,860
It's the bird doing something I don't fucking I don't know what this chain explosion is I'm gonna do absorption rate though

1716
02:44:31,740 --> 02:44:33,740

02:44:40,700 --> 02:44:45,980
Stop time. Oh, they get pushed. I didn't even notice that before. Oh perfect. I was getting closed in there

1718
02:44:51,180 --> 02:44:53,180
Oh my god

1719
02:45:01,100 --> 02:45:03,100
I

1720
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:08,300
Don't know what this chain explosion thing is this is doing something. Oh now I see it

1721
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:13,900
I'm like, I don't see anything happening. All right. Let's get the stupid feathers

1722
02:45:16,380 --> 02:45:19,100
I'm telling you feather. This might not be the run

1723
02:45:31,020 --> 02:45:34,060
Because the familiar like the familiar potions do like

1724
02:45:35,740 --> 02:45:42,620
Jack shit. I'm not gonna lie to you. They just have terrible power and just like area of effects and all that jazz

1725
02:45:53,020 --> 02:45:55,020
I can't even tell if it's doing anything to them

1726
02:45:58,140 --> 02:46:00,140
Come on I will do more

1727
02:46:00,860 --> 02:46:02,860
I

1728
02:46:08,220 --> 02:46:10,220
Now this is the run for sure

1729
02:46:10,540 --> 02:46:15,020
I'm gonna play wedding which with you wish me. Oh, good luck. Good luck. I hope you enjoy

1730
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:20,140
Okay, so I can go beast or small boob. What do you think?

1731
02:46:31,420 --> 02:46:38,380
I'll do a poll for this because they both have super so they're both super potions

1732
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:45,740
Flat justice

1733
02:46:47,980 --> 02:46:52,780
I'm gonna turn off auto target. Oh, I didn't know that was a thing. Wait, did I know that was a thing?

1734
02:46:55,900 --> 02:46:57,900

1735
02:46:58,860 --> 02:47:00,860

1736
02:47:03,820 --> 02:47:05,820
Oh my god

1737
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:13,100
Almost pulled the camera down

1738
02:47:28,700 --> 02:47:30,860
It's funny because I think the last time I played this game

1739
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:35,500
I literally had a sneezing fit and I had someone when I was streaming on twitch on my pl

1740
02:47:35,900 --> 02:47:37,900
They came in and clipped every

1741
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:40,780
Sneeze and it was like a hundred and something

1742
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:52,140
Oh sneezing hurts because like it makes my like body tense up and like it's not this doesn't feel good to sneeze

1743
02:47:58,780 --> 02:48:04,780
Oh, that's painful like I like sneezing but not like this

1744
02:48:12,220 --> 02:48:14,220
Am I okay? I'm okay

1745
02:48:19,660 --> 02:48:23,020
I can sneeze like I'm like a dragon ball character

1746
02:48:28,140 --> 02:48:30,140
So

1747
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:34,220
Oh, that was that hurt I shouldn't have done that

1748
02:48:42,300 --> 02:48:48,380
Is my nose bleeding hold on if he is staring if he is no if he is actually asleep or all that

1749
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:50,380
I thought she was looking at me

1750
02:48:51,740 --> 02:48:53,740
Is my nose bleeding it's not

1751
02:48:53,740 --> 02:49:02,700
I'm gonna go take an allergy pill. Yes. I already took something. I'm gonna go take something else. I'm dying

1752
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:25,740
I

1753
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:49,260
I feel I'm so sorry for making you

1754
02:49:53,740 --> 02:49:56,460
I

1755
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:26,300
Oh

1756
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:37,500

1757
02:50:42,380 --> 02:50:44,380
Someone come take care of me, please

1758
02:50:44,380 --> 02:50:46,380
I

1759
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:05,260
Actually

1760
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:12,700
Haven't gone anywhere

1761
02:51:14,380 --> 02:51:16,380
I

1762
02:51:16,380 --> 02:51:18,380
I

1763
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:45,020
Be a this is what I have having for cheap

1764
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:48,380
You guys can see it

1765
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:53,100
The camera get booed

1766
02:51:56,540 --> 02:51:58,540
The hell

1767
02:51:59,260 --> 02:52:01,260
Out of the camera get booed

1768
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:04,060
I must have sneezed and pulled on

1769
02:52:07,020 --> 02:52:10,540
I don't know why backwards but flip it. I don't know

1770
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:12,540
I

1771
02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:19,260
Violent sneezing it's because my camera wires across my

1772
02:52:20,860 --> 02:52:22,860
Lap

1773
02:52:28,060 --> 02:52:30,060
Might as well take my meds while I'm at it

1774
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:45,180
One of my meds actually also doubles as anti-history. It's very funny to me

1775
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:57,740
But to my dish and it so much oh it would oi

1776
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:05,660

02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:15,500
Oh do harlots of dander

02:53:20,220 --> 02:53:22,220
I don't know you guys

1779
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:29,020
Oh, I'm like sweating what the hell is happening am I sick?

1780
02:53:31,820 --> 02:53:38,460
Oh, I'm like super hot a little scrunchy even my hair up. Oh my god like dying

1781
02:53:41,020 --> 02:53:43,020
I

1782
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:45,020
This is where it's going to be.

1783
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:55,020
The air conditioning is on.

1784
02:54:07,020 --> 02:54:09,020
This is how it will be.

1785
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:11,020
Rainbow, come here.

1786
02:54:14,020 --> 02:54:16,020
You gotta find them.

1787
02:54:33,020 --> 02:54:35,020
Tia!

1788
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:37,020
Tia!

1789
02:54:37,020 --> 02:54:39,020
Tia!

1790
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:45,020
Tia!

1791
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:54,020
Did you follow that okay?

1792
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:56,020
Not much you're choking on me.

1793
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:04,020
Don't bite me.

1794
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:07,020
Move me, go away. There's like 50 others on the floor.

1795
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:17,020
You guys, you guys, you're crying with me.

1796
02:55:17,020 --> 02:55:19,020
You guys, you're crying with me.

1797
02:55:19,020 --> 02:55:21,020
Ow!

1798
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:23,020
Fucker, hit me.

1799
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:25,020
No, it's okay.

1800
02:55:25,020 --> 02:55:27,020
It didn't hurt.

1801
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:29,020
You're so good.

1802
02:55:29,020 --> 02:55:31,020
Can I have a kiss?

1803
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:33,020
Can I have a kiss?

1804
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:35,020
Thank you for the kiss. Where are you going?

1805
02:55:37,020 --> 02:55:39,020
Thank you for the kisses.

1806
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:41,020
There's no bite on my fingernails.

1807
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:43,020
I love you.

1808
02:55:43,020 --> 02:55:45,020
I love you.

1809
02:55:49,020 --> 02:55:51,020
Hair reveal?

1810
02:55:51,020 --> 02:55:53,020
My hairs are a ponytail.

1811
02:55:57,020 --> 02:55:59,020
I feel the bite bed companion.

1812
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:05,020
Both.

1813
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:07,020
Take a look.

1814
02:56:15,020 --> 02:56:17,020
Harlots vs. Reflings cry off.

1815
02:56:17,020 --> 02:56:19,020
Well, they, I don't know.

1816
02:56:19,020 --> 02:56:21,020
They might, They might beat you on that.

1817
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:23,020
They've had a long time to cry.

1818
02:56:23,020 --> 02:56:25,020
To like save up their tears, you know.

1819
02:56:29,020 --> 02:56:31,020
I'm sorry, I'm waiting for my tea.

1820
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:33,020
She'll be done in a second.

1821
02:56:33,020 --> 02:56:37,020
What are you doing, Bumi? I don't trust you.

1822
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:51,020
Stop chasing her!

1823
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:56,020
Bumi, enough!

1824
02:56:57,020 --> 02:57:01,020
Stop! Leave Reina alone! Why are you terrorizing her today?

1825
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:03,020
Where are you? What are you doing?

1826
02:57:03,020 --> 02:57:05,020
You look fucking suspicious.

1827
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:11,020
I feel you. You stay cuter, Bumi.

1828
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:15,020
Bumi, stop being a menace.

1829
02:57:21,020 --> 02:57:24,020
You've been crying? I want you to cry right now. Cry.

1830
02:57:24,020 --> 02:57:27,020
Cry for me. Cry for you bitch.

1831
02:57:27,020 --> 02:57:29,020
Just a minute.

1832
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:54,020
Smashing water everywhere.

1833
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:59,020
Cry for me.

1834
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:18,020
Okay, I got some tea.

1835
02:58:22,020 --> 02:58:24,020
What? What are you looking at?

1836
02:58:24,020 --> 02:58:26,020
What do you want?

1837
02:58:31,020 --> 02:58:34,020
She like head nods to me. She's like, wait, what's up?

1838
02:58:35,020 --> 02:58:39,020
She always does that because she always wants to know what I have.

1839
02:58:39,020 --> 02:58:41,020
It's just tea for you.

1840
02:58:43,020 --> 02:58:45,020
You're so excited. It's not a treat.

1841
02:58:45,020 --> 02:58:47,020
It just gave you treats, lady.

1842
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:50,020
You made me a sweater with my tears.

1843
02:58:50,020 --> 02:58:52,020
No, I want you to cry, IRL.

1844
02:58:52,020 --> 02:58:56,020
I want you to cry on the chat.

1845
02:58:56,020 --> 02:58:59,020
I want you to just shut a tear for me.

1846
02:58:59,020 --> 02:59:01,020
Pour one out.

1847
02:59:01,020 --> 02:59:04,020
I feel like I sound like Doki Bird right now.

1848
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:11,020
I'm like, I'm a little bit, she's a little bit more easily.

1849
02:59:11,020 --> 02:59:13,020
I'm dying slowly.

1850
02:59:13,020 --> 02:59:15,020
Are you still Doki Bunt?

1851
02:59:19,020 --> 02:59:21,020
I will try, try harder.

1852
02:59:21,020 --> 02:59:23,020
You were working.

1853
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:25,020
Yeah, I was working on the thingy.

1854
02:59:27,020 --> 02:59:29,020
I want you to just shut a tear,

1855
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:31,020
like pour one out for the homies type.

1856
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:33,020
You're so cute.

1857
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:35,020
Doki Bird is awesome.

1858
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:37,020
Doki Bird is awesome.

1859
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:39,020
You're so cute.

1860
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:41,020
Doki Bird is awesome.

1861
02:59:41,020 --> 02:59:43,020
No, let's not say that.

1862
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:49,020
Let's not go there.

1863
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:53,020
I'm barely a doll myself anyways, so.

1864
02:59:53,020 --> 02:59:55,020
What did you guys vote for?

1865
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:57,020
I don't even remember.

1866
02:59:59,020 --> 03:00:01,020
What did you guys vote?

1867
03:00:03,020 --> 03:00:05,020
You got one tear.

1868
03:00:05,020 --> 03:00:07,020
We voted flat.

1869
03:00:15,020 --> 03:00:17,020
They're not even small.

1870
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:19,020
They're like normal sized.

1871
03:00:23,020 --> 03:00:25,020
You have some tea.

1872
03:00:25,020 --> 03:00:27,020
I need it to cool off though.

1873
03:00:27,020 --> 03:00:29,020
It's very hot.

1874
03:00:29,020 --> 03:00:31,020
Yeah, go cut an onion.

1875
03:00:35,020 --> 03:00:37,020
They're cuppable,

1876
03:00:37,020 --> 03:00:39,020
but they look huge.

1877
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:41,020
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

1878
03:00:41,020 --> 03:00:43,020
Those look so big.

1879
03:00:43,020 --> 03:00:45,020
She gets flatter than that.

1880
03:00:51,020 --> 03:00:53,020
Are you thinking of milk to make yourself cry?

1881
03:00:53,020 --> 03:00:55,020
What are you thinking about

1882
03:00:55,020 --> 03:00:57,020
to make yourself cry right now for me?

1883
03:01:01,020 --> 03:01:03,020
Yeah, they were humongous.

1884
03:01:03,020 --> 03:01:05,020
Now they're just huge,

1885
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:07,020
and now they'll be normal sized,

1886
03:01:07,020 --> 03:01:09,020
and then they'll be flat.

1887
03:01:11,020 --> 03:01:13,020
You don't have milk?

1888
03:01:13,020 --> 03:01:15,020
Why are you crying?

1889
03:01:15,020 --> 03:01:17,020
Why are you crying over milk?

1890
03:01:17,020 --> 03:01:19,020
It's not even spilled.

1891
03:01:19,020 --> 03:01:21,020
I'm thinking about what you'll do to me

1892
03:01:21,020 --> 03:01:23,020
if I don't cry.

1893
03:01:23,020 --> 03:01:25,020
Cry bitch.

1894
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:27,020
Cry, cry, cry, cry for me.

1895
03:01:29,020 --> 03:01:31,020
I need boy tears.

1896
03:01:31,020 --> 03:01:33,020
My tears will heal my soul.

1897
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:37,020
Tia, you're looking at me

1898
03:01:37,020 --> 03:01:39,020
with the cutest expression.

1899
03:01:39,020 --> 03:01:41,020
Why are you so adorable?

1900
03:01:43,020 --> 03:01:45,020
Why do you look so funny?

1901
03:01:57,020 --> 03:01:59,020
Stop, don't lick me!

1902
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:03,020
I know she be tomorrow.

1903
03:02:05,020 --> 03:02:07,020
Yeah, it's working.

1904
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:09,020
I'm crying.

1905
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:11,020
Why are my eyes, hold your eyes.

1906
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:13,020
No, boomie, don't chew on the camera.

1907
03:02:15,020 --> 03:02:17,020
Camera cord.

1908
03:02:17,020 --> 03:02:19,020
Yeah, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

1909
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:21,020
Cry about, boomie!

1910
03:02:21,020 --> 03:02:23,020
I'm not going to, sorry.

1911
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:25,020
My demonic tone.

1912
03:02:25,020 --> 03:02:27,020
I just took, because he just went back

1913
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:29,020
and did it again.

1914
03:02:31,020 --> 03:02:33,020
I'm thinking about stubbing

1915
03:02:33,020 --> 03:02:35,020
your little toe.

1916
03:02:35,020 --> 03:02:37,020
Boomie didn't get his chicken nugget.

1917
03:02:37,020 --> 03:02:39,020
Boomie throwing the camera.

1918
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:41,020
No, he's chewing on the wire.

1919
03:02:41,020 --> 03:02:43,020
It's next to my computer.

1920
03:02:45,020 --> 03:02:47,020
Yeah, you don't have me tomorrow.

1921
03:02:47,020 --> 03:02:49,020
I'm hanging on my mom. How does that make you feel?

1922
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:55,020
I'm thinking about all the injustice boomie faces.

1923
03:02:57,020 --> 03:02:59,020
Where's the Lego? Yeah, go step on a Lego.

1924
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:03,020
Boomie.

1925
03:03:07,020 --> 03:03:09,020
I'm thinking about how my cat's legs don't work.

1926
03:03:09,020 --> 03:03:11,020
I'm thinking about how she can't do anything.

1927
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:15,020
Besides,

1928
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:17,020
sit there and eat hot chip

1929
03:03:17,020 --> 03:03:19,020
and do crime.

1930
03:03:19,020 --> 03:03:21,020
It's terrible.

1931
03:03:21,020 --> 03:03:23,020
Not the NTR.

1932
03:03:23,020 --> 03:03:25,020
That's not stop!

1933
03:03:25,020 --> 03:03:27,020
Don't even go there, dude.

1934
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:29,020
You guys know how I feel about that stuff.

1935
03:03:31,020 --> 03:03:33,020
That's messed up.

1936
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:39,020
She'll be fine.

1937
03:03:39,020 --> 03:03:41,020
Don't worry, she's going to get better.

1938
03:03:45,020 --> 03:03:47,020
Well, no, Sundays are my days off.

1939
03:03:47,020 --> 03:03:49,020
So I can actually get shit done

1940
03:03:49,020 --> 03:03:51,020
and like

1941
03:03:51,020 --> 03:03:53,020
run errands

1942
03:03:53,020 --> 03:03:55,020
with the stores and clothes on Sunday.

1943
03:03:55,020 --> 03:03:57,020
Okay.

1944
03:03:59,020 --> 03:04:01,020
Let's...

1945
03:04:01,020 --> 03:04:03,020
I'm going to make jiggy cookies.

1946
03:04:05,020 --> 03:04:07,020
And sweet potato fries.

1947
03:04:21,020 --> 03:04:23,020
Get away from the freezer.

1948
03:04:25,020 --> 03:04:27,020
What do you need?

1949
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:29,020
What do you need from the freezer?

1950
03:04:45,020 --> 03:04:47,020
I think I'll have five nuggets.

1951
03:04:47,020 --> 03:04:49,020
I'll have a five of these nuggets.

1952
03:04:49,020 --> 03:04:51,020
Okay.

1953
03:04:53,020 --> 03:04:55,020
Is that five?

1954
03:04:55,020 --> 03:04:57,020
One, two, three, four, five, okay.

1955
03:04:57,020 --> 03:04:59,020
Sorry, I have three couplers.

1956
03:05:01,020 --> 03:05:03,020
Let me get away from the freezer.

1957
03:05:09,020 --> 03:05:11,020
Okay, you're going to hear my air fryer.

1958
03:05:13,020 --> 03:05:15,020
My air fryer is going to do its thing.

1959
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:17,020
You know, fry that air.

1960
03:05:21,020 --> 03:05:23,020
Can't wait for FPS week.

1961
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:25,020
That's good.

1962
03:05:25,020 --> 03:05:27,020
All cats born after 1993.

1963
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:29,020
You only need a hot chip.

1964
03:05:29,020 --> 03:05:31,020
War crime person not walking.

1965
03:05:31,020 --> 03:05:33,020
What?

1966
03:05:33,020 --> 03:05:35,020
I made no message about it.

1967
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:37,020
I said nothing about a date.

1968
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:41,020
Excuse me.

1969
03:05:41,020 --> 03:05:43,020
Normally I eat my burps

1970
03:05:43,020 --> 03:05:45,020
and save them from member streams now.

1971
03:05:45,020 --> 03:05:47,020
But that took...

1972
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:49,020
I can't do anything right now.

1973
03:05:49,020 --> 03:05:51,020
I'm falling apart.

1974
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:53,020
Nine out of ten.

1975
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:55,020
Nine out of ten.

1976
03:05:55,020 --> 03:05:57,020
You guys are all lying to me.

1977
03:05:57,020 --> 03:05:59,020
You guys are only...

1978
03:05:59,020 --> 03:06:01,020
Hold on, I'm going to fart.

1979
03:06:13,020 --> 03:06:15,020
Why did it squeak like that?

1980
03:06:19,020 --> 03:06:21,020
Was that a bugle?

1981
03:06:23,020 --> 03:06:25,020
That was so funny.

1982
03:06:25,020 --> 03:06:27,020
That was like...

1983
03:06:27,020 --> 03:06:29,020
That was like...

1984
03:06:29,020 --> 03:06:31,020
That was like the tiniest...

1985
03:06:31,020 --> 03:06:33,020
Squeakyest too.

1986
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:35,020
I thought it was going to rip ass

1987
03:06:35,020 --> 03:06:37,020
and it came out like...

1988
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:39,020
Like what the fuck?

1989
03:06:39,020 --> 03:06:41,020
Oh my god.

1990
03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:43,020
Oh my god.

1991
03:06:47,020 --> 03:06:49,020
She said that that was members content

1992
03:06:49,020 --> 03:06:51,020
during the master disguise.

1993
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:53,020
Then you did went to media.

1994
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:55,020
Yeah.

1995
03:06:55,020 --> 03:06:57,020
I give you guys like a little...

1996
03:06:57,020 --> 03:06:59,020
I dangle you something every once in a while.

1997
03:07:03,020 --> 03:07:05,020
I just wanted to do it

1998
03:07:05,020 --> 03:07:07,020
because I like seeing you guys' reactions.

1999
03:07:07,020 --> 03:07:09,020
I do a lot of stuff

2000
03:07:09,020 --> 03:07:11,020
just to get a reaction out of you guys.

2001
03:07:11,020 --> 03:07:13,020
Just the sweetest.

2002
03:07:21,020 --> 03:07:23,020
Is that hot to you?

2003
03:07:23,020 --> 03:07:25,020
Me just doing...

2004
03:07:29,020 --> 03:07:31,020
I'm dying of sickness

2005
03:07:31,020 --> 03:07:33,020
and this is what I offer up to you.

2006
03:07:33,020 --> 03:07:35,020
This is members only content

2007
03:07:35,020 --> 03:07:37,020
so you should consider member.

2008
03:07:37,020 --> 03:07:39,020
Exactly. I rip ass and I rip so much.

2009
03:07:39,020 --> 03:07:41,020
So if you're into that, come be a member.

2010
03:07:41,020 --> 03:07:43,020
And if you're not,

2011
03:07:43,020 --> 03:07:45,020
you can mute me

2012
03:07:45,020 --> 03:07:47,020
when that happens.

2013
03:07:53,020 --> 03:07:55,020
I'm not into that.

2014
03:07:55,020 --> 03:07:57,020
But like...

2015
03:07:57,020 --> 03:07:59,020
I think you guys just think it's funny.

2016
03:07:59,020 --> 03:08:01,020
I think half of you think it's funny.

2017
03:08:01,020 --> 03:08:03,020
I think half of you just want to hear a girl fart.

2018
03:08:03,020 --> 03:08:05,020
Sorry.

2019
03:08:05,020 --> 03:08:07,020
A third of you think it's funny.

2020
03:08:07,020 --> 03:08:09,020
A third of you just want to hear what a girl fart sounds like.

2021
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:11,020
And the other third is just like

2022
03:08:11,020 --> 03:08:13,020
I'm jorkin' it.

2023
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:17,020
Can I mute them in members?

2024
03:08:17,020 --> 03:08:19,020
I do. Okay, I'll stop.

2025
03:08:21,020 --> 03:08:23,020
I'll stop.

2026
03:08:23,020 --> 03:08:25,020
I don't think... No.

2027
03:08:25,020 --> 03:08:27,020
I don't think I've murdered...

2028
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:29,020
Fuck me.

2029
03:08:29,020 --> 03:08:31,020
Muted.

2030
03:08:31,020 --> 03:08:33,020
First in members before.

2031
03:08:33,020 --> 03:08:35,020
Why not all three? I'm in the funny group.

2032
03:08:39,020 --> 03:08:41,020
I'm part of the jorkin' squad.

2033
03:08:43,020 --> 03:08:45,020
I'm mad. I'm sitting on my face

2034
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:47,020
and tooting on me.

2035
03:08:49,020 --> 03:08:51,020
I'm making my own members content.

2036
03:08:53,020 --> 03:08:55,020
Yeah, I don't really think...

2037
03:08:55,020 --> 03:08:57,020
If a girl did that on stream

2038
03:08:57,020 --> 03:08:59,020
while I was watching, I would be like,

2039
03:08:59,020 --> 03:09:01,020
funny. I wouldn't really care.

2040
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:05,020
Yeah, let's take a poll.

2041
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:09,020
Let's take a poll.

2042
03:09:27,020 --> 03:09:29,020
I put fetus instead of fish.

2043
03:09:33,020 --> 03:09:35,020
Okay.

2044
03:09:47,020 --> 03:09:49,020
Wait, I accidentally did caps lock.

2045
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:55,020
I accidentally did caps lock.

2046
03:09:55,020 --> 03:09:57,020
I want to hear what it sounds like.

2047
03:10:03,020 --> 03:10:05,020
Nice job.

2048
03:10:05,020 --> 03:10:07,020
You maxed out small titty. Nice job.

2049
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:09,020
Good job.

2050
03:10:11,020 --> 03:10:13,020
This is for science. Be truthful.

2051
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:15,020
Be truthful, please.

2052
03:10:17,020 --> 03:10:19,020
Damn, a lot of this is funny.

2053
03:10:23,020 --> 03:10:25,020
I'm laughing at my own caps lock error.

2054
03:10:25,020 --> 03:10:27,020
I want to hear what it sounds like.

2055
03:10:29,020 --> 03:10:31,020
As a squelcher,

2056
03:10:31,020 --> 03:10:33,020
it doesn't squeak.

2057
03:10:33,020 --> 03:10:35,020
Stop tooting.

2058
03:10:35,020 --> 03:10:37,020
Why?

2059
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:39,020
I need an explanation as to why.

2060
03:10:39,020 --> 03:10:41,020
Why?

2061
03:10:41,020 --> 03:10:43,020
Just tell me why.

2062
03:10:43,020 --> 03:10:45,020
Tell me why?

2063
03:10:45,020 --> 03:10:47,020
Why don't you?

2064
03:10:47,020 --> 03:10:49,020
Even if it was anyone, I think it was funny.

2065
03:10:49,020 --> 03:10:51,020
Party is a natural thing.

2066
03:10:51,020 --> 03:10:53,020
Alright, I'm walking over here now.

2067
03:10:55,020 --> 03:10:57,020

What it is, энергia.

2105
03:14:52,380 --> 03:14:57,380
If this god knows death, he doesn't.

2106
03:14:57,380 --> 03:15:00,380
You know, I have like a package of like,

2107
03:15:00,380 --> 03:15:02,380
Polynesian sauce, this one's good.

2108
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:06,880
So, this is a good spire.

2109
03:15:11,880 --> 03:15:14,380
We're gonna have issues with trying to hop in the fridge.

2110
03:15:15,880 --> 03:15:17,380
Well, he likes to jump in the fridge,

2111
03:15:17,380 --> 03:15:19,380
he likes to jump in the dryer,

2112
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:21,380
he likes to jump in the washing machine,

2113
03:15:21,380 --> 03:15:23,380
he likes to jump in the dishwasher.

2114
03:15:24,380 --> 03:15:26,380
I don't know why he's like this.

2115
03:15:28,380 --> 03:15:31,380
Ta-da!

2116
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:33,380
I did it.

2117
03:15:33,380 --> 03:15:35,380
He is like what the fuck?

2118
03:15:38,380 --> 03:15:40,380
Are you trying to make it undetectable though?

2119
03:15:41,380 --> 03:15:43,380
Yeah, do whatever besides the car.

2120
03:15:43,380 --> 03:15:45,380
I'm just gonna stick this on my keyboard.

2121
03:15:46,380 --> 03:15:48,380
But we's hungry too, he literally just ate.

2122
03:15:52,380 --> 03:15:53,380
Excuse me.

2123
03:15:54,380 --> 03:15:57,380
What's the brokerage?

2124
03:16:08,380 --> 03:16:10,380
4 out of 0.

2125
03:16:11,380 --> 03:16:13,380
That's nice.

2126
03:16:16,380 --> 03:16:19,380
He can't have sweet, well actually no he can't have sweet potatoes.

2127
03:16:24,380 --> 03:16:26,380
Nomi actually likes vegetables a lot.

2128
03:16:30,380 --> 03:16:32,380
He's the only kind I've met that likes vegetables.

2129
03:16:37,380 --> 03:16:39,380
He is just like sleepily looking at me.

2130
03:16:43,380 --> 03:16:45,380
What's the bro quiz?

2131
03:16:48,380 --> 03:16:50,380
Nomi's vegan.

2132
03:16:50,380 --> 03:16:52,380
I explained so much.

2133
03:16:52,380 --> 03:16:54,380
Can you imagine?

2134
03:16:54,380 --> 03:16:58,380
I have honey mustard ketchup and then I also have some Polynesian sauce.

2135
03:17:00,380 --> 03:17:04,380
And then Bumi's on the desk and he's probably gonna try to steal my food.

2136
03:17:04,380 --> 03:17:06,380
Can I help you?

2137
03:17:07,380 --> 03:17:10,380
This is too hot for you to eat, you can't have it.

2138
03:17:11,380 --> 03:17:14,380
No I know the bro code, they said the bro quiz.

2139
03:17:23,380 --> 03:17:28,380
I can't see but he's walking around my desk or trying to.

2140
03:17:28,380 --> 03:17:31,380
Trying to get around Fia to get to my food.

2141
03:17:43,380 --> 03:17:45,380
Are you guys gonna cry every sentence?

2142
03:17:45,380 --> 03:17:47,380
How much of a bro am I?

2143
03:17:47,380 --> 03:17:49,380
I don't know, tell me.

2144
03:17:49,380 --> 03:17:52,380
Shime body erotic.

2145
03:17:57,380 --> 03:17:59,380
See Bumi's tail.

2146
03:18:00,380 --> 03:18:02,380
Bumi what are you doing?

2147
03:18:02,380 --> 03:18:04,380
I'm trying to eat.

2148
03:18:19,380 --> 03:18:21,380
Do you want us to?

2149
03:18:21,380 --> 03:18:23,380
Yeah, continue.

2150
03:18:23,380 --> 03:18:25,380
It brings me joy.

2151
03:18:25,380 --> 03:18:27,380
I like watching men cry, it turns me on.

2152
03:18:27,380 --> 03:18:29,380
What is that?

2153
03:18:29,380 --> 03:18:31,380
No Bumi, you can't have it.

2154
03:18:31,380 --> 03:18:33,380
Bumi looked at it like what?

2155
03:18:33,380 --> 03:18:35,380
Locked in. Target acquired.

2156
03:18:39,380 --> 03:18:41,380
Tani much more.

2157
03:18:41,380 --> 03:18:43,380
Tani much more.

2158
03:18:43,380 --> 03:18:45,380
Target acquired.

2159
03:18:48,380 --> 03:18:50,380
Tani mustered.

2160
03:18:52,380 --> 03:18:55,380
It's our turn to be men Hiroshibi, what if we cry and we don't want to?

2161
03:18:55,380 --> 03:18:57,380
Don't want to what?

2162
03:18:57,380 --> 03:18:59,380
You don't have a choice.

2163
03:18:59,380 --> 03:19:01,380
You think you have a say in the matter?

2164
03:19:02,380 --> 03:19:05,380
I don't care, I'm doing it anyways.

2165
03:19:08,380 --> 03:19:10,380
Am I hot now?

2166
03:19:14,380 --> 03:19:19,380
What are you doing to her?

2167
03:19:19,380 --> 03:19:22,380
Yeah, cry, cry.

2168
03:19:24,380 --> 03:19:26,380
Cry.

2169
03:19:26,380 --> 03:19:29,380
Cry for me, cry for me.

2170
03:19:29,380 --> 03:19:31,380
Hiroshibi you didn't read them.

2171
03:19:31,380 --> 03:19:34,380
Read what? I can't read, I'm eating.

2172
03:19:34,380 --> 03:19:37,380
I'm trying to also, I'm my guard for Bumi.

2173
03:19:44,380 --> 03:19:46,380
Mascara would be nice.

2174
03:19:48,380 --> 03:19:50,380
Guys with makeup are hot.

2175
03:19:50,380 --> 03:19:52,380
Cause they're bisexual.

2176
03:19:54,380 --> 03:19:56,380
Get it cause I'm gothic, sorry.

2177
03:20:00,380 --> 03:20:02,380
I love sensitive by guys.

2178
03:20:07,380 --> 03:20:09,380
Drinking so I can cry more.

2179
03:20:14,380 --> 03:20:17,380
When did the shippity get here?

2180
03:20:18,380 --> 03:20:20,380
Shibi's filtering the merrows.

2181
03:20:22,380 --> 03:20:24,380
I'm very gothic.

2182
03:20:25,380 --> 03:20:27,380
That's Bumi jumping down.

2183
03:20:30,380 --> 03:20:33,380
I was like, honestly I'm so sick of reading merrows.

2184
03:20:33,380 --> 03:20:37,380
Like I looked again this morning and you guys had like responded with really nice stuff,

2185
03:20:37,380 --> 03:20:40,380
but it's, and I love it a lot.

2186
03:20:40,380 --> 03:20:43,380
But it's like nine times out of 10.

2187
03:20:43,380 --> 03:20:51,380
It's something like really like manager larpy or annoying or like, and I just like, I can't, it's not fun anymore.

2188
03:20:52,380 --> 03:20:56,380
And I'd rather just interact with you guys on stream like this.

2189
03:20:56,380 --> 03:21:03,380
And then like someone who's just like, oh no, please don't be cute and funny.

2190
03:21:03,380 --> 03:21:07,380
I'm like, cause I don't, cause I don't think I can love you.

2191
03:21:07,380 --> 03:21:09,380
And I'm like, then don't say you love me.

2192
03:21:09,380 --> 03:21:11,380
Like that's just so disrespectful.

2193
03:21:11,380 --> 03:21:16,380
Like, you also don't know anything about me cause I used to be cute and funny before I was Shibi.

2194
03:21:16,380 --> 03:21:18,380
And I'm like, I don't think I can love you.

2195
03:21:18,380 --> 03:21:20,380
And I'm like, then don't say you love me.

2196
03:21:20,380 --> 03:21:22,380
Like that's just so disrespectful.

2197
03:21:22,380 --> 03:21:25,380
Cause I didn't think about me cause I used to be cute and funny before I was Shibi.

2198
03:21:28,380 --> 03:21:29,380
Yeah.

2199
03:21:31,380 --> 03:21:33,380
I demand more soy sauce videos.

2200
03:21:37,380 --> 03:21:39,380
But like, you know what?

2201
03:21:40,380 --> 03:21:50,380
If I change, like if I do a 2.0 and I'm a fucking dog and I, or I do this or I turn into like a

2202
03:21:51,380 --> 03:21:55,380
2.0 slime girl or and I'm cute funny or whatever the heck.

2203
03:21:55,380 --> 03:21:59,380
Like if you don't want to stick around, you're totally entitled to that,

2204
03:21:59,380 --> 03:22:02,380
but you don't have to tell me that you don't like something.

2205
03:22:02,380 --> 03:22:07,380
I'm going to do what brings me joy because when I'm happy, I make better content, you know?

2206
03:22:07,380 --> 03:22:26,380
Like, so if I change my appearance, then yeah, I'm not changing my personality cause this is how I am.

2207
03:22:26,380 --> 03:22:28,380
So like, you don't have to worry about that.

2208
03:22:28,380 --> 03:22:33,380
But like, that's like a year away.

2209
03:22:33,380 --> 03:22:36,380
People are like, oh my gosh, she's doing it now?

2210
03:22:36,380 --> 03:22:37,380
Oh no.

2211
03:22:41,380 --> 03:22:43,380
And I'm not, I'm not doing that for my 2.0.

2212
03:22:43,380 --> 03:22:45,380
I'm not being cute and funny for my 2.0.

2213
03:22:53,380 --> 03:22:54,380
Yeah.

2214
03:22:54,380 --> 03:22:55,380
It's like, I'm still the same person.

2215
03:22:55,380 --> 03:23:00,380
Doesn't matter what, what I'm piloting, you know?

2216
03:23:01,380 --> 03:23:06,380
I don't know what website I need to go to.

2217
03:23:09,380 --> 03:23:13,380
Like that just solidified for me that they don't love me for me.

2218
03:23:13,380 --> 03:23:17,380
They just love me because of what I look like in a body type and that made me really sad.

2219
03:23:22,380 --> 03:23:24,380
And then I know you're like, she don't get one guide.

2220
03:23:24,380 --> 03:23:26,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

2221
03:23:26,380 --> 03:23:28,380
I'm not getting one guide.

2222
03:23:28,380 --> 03:23:30,380
Cause I know a lot of people share the same sentiments, so.

2223
03:23:36,380 --> 03:23:37,380
I'm dropping you.

2224
03:23:40,380 --> 03:23:41,380
It's not an airport.

2225
03:23:41,380 --> 03:23:43,380
You do not have to announce your departure.

2226
03:23:48,380 --> 03:23:53,380
It's like, and I got like, I understand what like, I can sympathize with like them saying it makes me uncomfortable.

2227
03:23:53,380 --> 03:23:57,380
Comfy, but like, it kind of confi...

2228
03:23:57,380 --> 03:24:05,380
Cause I'm like, I'm going to be the same person, just like chibi, chibi, chibi, chibi, chibi.

2229
03:24:05,380 --> 03:24:10,380
And it's like, I would just be cracking like, so I don't really get it.

2230
03:24:10,380 --> 03:24:16,380
Like I'm not, I wasn't going to like, I'm not making a 3D model of that.

2231
03:24:16,380 --> 03:24:17,380
Like, no.

2232
03:24:18,380 --> 03:24:26,380
So like, I understand where they're coming from, but in the context, it still doesn't make sense to me.

2233
03:24:30,380 --> 03:24:38,380
Like, I should literally have strong Italian people that like, Kayfabe doesn't mean a shit in this company.

2234
03:24:38,380 --> 03:24:43,380
She just, she literally is only for Patreon and people still can't get that through their head.

2235
03:24:44,380 --> 03:24:46,380
Like, I am going to be myself on YouTube.

2236
03:24:46,380 --> 03:24:47,380
And this is how I am.

2237
03:24:47,380 --> 03:24:48,380
I am just a dork.

2238
03:24:49,380 --> 03:24:50,380
Sorry.

2239
03:24:52,380 --> 03:24:55,380
Sorry, I'm like, I'm truly like a fucking animal.

2240
03:24:57,380 --> 03:24:59,380
My bitch chibi got me acting up.

2241
03:25:02,380 --> 03:25:04,380
It's just a little alt-model.

2242
03:25:04,380 --> 03:25:06,380
I just wanted a little fun, like, chibi model.

2243
03:25:06,380 --> 03:25:07,380
A little cute, funny model.

2244
03:25:07,380 --> 03:25:08,380
Cause I thought it'd be fun.

2245
03:25:08,380 --> 03:25:12,380
Because I guys, my PL used to be cute and funny.

2246
03:25:12,380 --> 03:25:15,380
And I miss being cute and funny, so I wanted a little cute, funny model.

2247
03:25:18,380 --> 03:25:21,380
But that won't be for a very long time because that takes time and money.

2248
03:25:21,380 --> 03:25:24,380
People are like, oh my God, she's changing her whole thing.

2249
03:25:26,380 --> 03:25:27,380
Muppet chibi.

2250
03:25:27,380 --> 03:25:33,380
I told you guys that Toma made a 5 2D model on that, right?

2251
03:25:33,380 --> 03:25:35,380
She made me a Muppet Life 2D model.

2252
03:25:36,380 --> 03:25:39,380
I haven't been able to use it because she's learning how to rig.

2253
03:25:39,380 --> 03:25:41,380
She wants to be able to rig her herself.

2254
03:25:45,380 --> 03:25:47,380
I'm not a freaky, honestly.

2255
03:25:59,380 --> 03:26:01,380
Like, yeah, I just, I wish people would unreal-

2256
03:26:01,380 --> 03:26:04,380
And that goes for all of us, like, not just like me.

2257
03:26:05,380 --> 03:26:13,380
Like, the kayfabe is a, is a suggestion for streaming.

2258
03:26:13,380 --> 03:26:16,380
But Patreon, it's yeah, but like, otherwise.

2259
03:26:16,380 --> 03:26:20,380
Like, I'm not going to use a cute and funny voice doing my Patreon audios.

2260
03:26:20,380 --> 03:26:21,380
No.

2261
03:26:22,380 --> 03:26:23,380
Toma is cooking.

2262
03:26:25,380 --> 03:26:26,380
Yeah.

2263
03:26:26,380 --> 03:26:27,380
So like, I got it.

2264
03:26:27,380 --> 03:26:31,380
If you don't want to hang out, if you don't want to stick around because of that,

2265
03:26:31,380 --> 03:26:32,380
I totally understand.

2266
03:26:32,380 --> 03:26:35,380
You're totally entitled to that, but you don't have to tell me.

2267
03:26:35,380 --> 03:26:40,380
You just tell, like, you telling me is just going to make me bitter against you.

2268
03:26:40,380 --> 03:26:42,380
It's not going to change my mind.

2269
03:26:43,380 --> 03:26:48,380
I know you think you're doing like constructive criticism, but it's not criticism.

2270
03:26:48,380 --> 03:26:52,380
You're just telling me you don't like something, so you're hoping I don't change it because of just you.

2271
03:26:52,380 --> 03:26:56,380
Which is kind of like selfish for like other people who are looking forward to it.

2272
03:26:58,380 --> 03:27:01,380
Or just like me and my happiness.

2273
03:27:01,380 --> 03:27:04,380
You're putting your happiness before mine.

2274
03:27:05,380 --> 03:27:07,380
Because you gave that as a reason.

2275
03:27:07,380 --> 03:27:09,380
And like, again, I'm framing this in the form of like a relationship.

2276
03:27:09,380 --> 03:27:15,380
So if like, if your girlfriend comes to you and she's like, I want to get this dress and you go to her.

2277
03:27:17,380 --> 03:27:19,380
And she's like, I can't wait to get this dress.

2278
03:27:19,380 --> 03:27:21,380
And she's been talking about getting this dress.

2279
03:27:21,380 --> 03:27:23,380
And then you tell her, I don't like that dress.

2280
03:27:23,380 --> 03:27:28,380
It makes me uncomfortable, although she's been talking about it and showing you updates about it.

2281
03:27:29,380 --> 03:27:32,380
And you're like, because it makes me uncomfortable.

2282
03:27:32,380 --> 03:27:34,380
So I don't think I can like be with you.

2283
03:27:34,380 --> 03:27:36,380
Then just go like, you don't have to.

2284
03:27:37,380 --> 03:27:40,380
It was from the very beginning that she, I talked about this dress.

2285
03:27:46,380 --> 03:27:50,380
I feel like, yeah, I was like kind of worried because I know Emmy used her real voice today.

2286
03:27:50,380 --> 03:27:54,380
And honestly, Emmy's voice doesn't sound any different from her, her voice acting voice in my opinion.

2287
03:27:54,380 --> 03:27:56,380
She really doesn't sound any different to me.

2288
03:27:56,380 --> 03:27:59,380
I can't, I'm not good at telling differences like that.

2289
03:27:59,380 --> 03:28:02,380
She just sounds like a little bit deeper and that's it.

2290
03:28:04,380 --> 03:28:06,380
And I love her natural speaking voice.

2291
03:28:06,380 --> 03:28:10,380
And I was very worried that people are going to be mean to her, but it seems like everybody's okay.

2292
03:28:10,380 --> 03:28:11,380
So that's good.

2293
03:28:12,380 --> 03:28:18,380
Because like, yeah, because it's like she wasn't, I think she just wasn't feeling good or something.

2294
03:28:18,380 --> 03:28:20,380
Or she just was like tired and couldn't keep it up.

2295
03:28:20,380 --> 03:28:25,380
And like, like she shouldn't have to like, if you love someone, you love them no matter what.

2296
03:28:25,380 --> 03:28:30,380
If you only love them on conditions, then you don't, you're just infatuated.

2297
03:28:30,380 --> 03:28:33,380
You're not, you don't unconditionally love someone, you know.

2298
03:28:33,380 --> 03:28:38,380
But then again, you're entitled to, she's a 50k, 15k.

2299
03:28:38,380 --> 03:28:39,380
Oh shit, nice.

2300
03:28:39,380 --> 03:28:45,380
But again, if you're entitled, again, in a relationship, if someone makes like a crazy change,

2301
03:28:45,380 --> 03:28:48,380
then of course you're entitled to leave that relationship,

2302
03:28:48,380 --> 03:28:52,380
but you don't have to shit on the person on the way out for how they are, you know.

2303
03:28:55,380 --> 03:28:58,380
Yeah, Amy, Amy was like, I love Amy's natural voice.

2304
03:28:58,380 --> 03:29:01,380
She sounds hot either way to me.

2305
03:29:01,380 --> 03:29:03,380
Like I would listen to her.

2306
03:29:03,380 --> 03:29:08,380
Like I just honestly, I like how like, cause I like talked to her and call like I talked to her yesterday.

2307
03:29:08,380 --> 03:29:12,380
She was, she was chill with me cause I was kind of like a little bit stressed out as you guys know.

2308
03:29:12,380 --> 03:29:14,380
She was like, what's going on?

2309
03:29:14,380 --> 03:29:21,380
So I called her and she's just like, you know, talk like she's, she's very, she's very level headed.

2310
03:29:21,380 --> 03:29:26,380
So like if you're a pen pal and also like a harlot, like she's, she's, she's a real one.

2311
03:29:26,380 --> 03:29:27,380
She's good.

2312
03:29:27,380 --> 03:29:29,380
Um, yeah, she's always hot.

2313
03:29:29,380 --> 03:29:30,380
Yeah.

2314
03:29:30,380 --> 03:29:32,380
She'd be a shorts.

2315
03:29:32,380 --> 03:29:33,380
What?

2316
03:29:33,380 --> 03:29:34,380
Yes.

2317
03:29:34,380 --> 03:29:35,380
Question.

2318
03:29:35,380 --> 03:29:41,380
Um, but yeah, like she was like, she wants to get like, if I was a cute and funny, then I would also do the cute and funny voice.

2319
03:29:41,380 --> 03:29:45,380
Like I, but I would also probably be like Amy and be transparent.

2320
03:29:45,380 --> 03:29:49,380
Be like, Hey guys, this isn't my, she's like literally her first stream in her 2.0.

2321
03:29:49,380 --> 03:29:52,380
She's like, this isn't my real voice.

2322
03:29:52,380 --> 03:29:58,380
Like she told people so long ago and people freaked out back then and they, they, I don't know if they freaked out now.

2323
03:29:58,380 --> 03:30:00,380
But, um, I think she sounds amazing.

2324
03:30:00,380 --> 03:30:02,380
She's a great voice actress.

2325
03:30:02,380 --> 03:30:06,380
That is just because her voice, she doesn't mean she's changing.

2326
03:30:06,380 --> 03:30:08,380
It's more like she's even more relaxed.

2327
03:30:08,380 --> 03:30:13,380
It feels more comfortable with people that she wants to like share that part of herself.

2328
03:30:13,380 --> 03:30:18,380
And that's, yeah, it's like, people need to like, like we're feeler.

2329
03:30:18,380 --> 03:30:20,380
We're so open and honest with everyone.

2330
03:30:20,380 --> 03:30:24,380
Like I don't think people realize how open and honest we are.

2331
03:30:24,380 --> 03:30:25,380
It was any other company.

2332
03:30:25,380 --> 03:30:33,380
They would not give a shit about your feelings and consider like stuff and talk about stuff and be transparent and honest and open.

2333
03:30:33,380 --> 03:30:36,380
And I don't think, I think people take that fucking for granted and it pisses me off.

2334
03:30:36,380 --> 03:30:37,380
I'm sorry.

2335
03:30:37,380 --> 03:30:38,380
I'm kind of like ranting.

2336
03:30:38,380 --> 03:30:49,380
Um, but like if I was in a company where they're like, you are this and stick to it, then I would, but I'm not.

2337
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:51,380
So I'm in a company that lets me be myself.

2338
03:30:51,380 --> 03:30:52,380
So I'm going to be myself.

2339
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:53,380
You know?

2340
03:30:53,380 --> 03:31:02,380
Yeah, it's like, you know, we did throw the VTuber rulebook out the window.

2341
03:31:02,380 --> 03:31:03,380
We're cool.

2342
03:31:03,380 --> 03:31:04,380
We're chilling.

2343
03:31:05,380 --> 03:31:10,380
She's like, yeah, she literally, and like, it kind of makes me sad.

2344
03:31:10,380 --> 03:31:20,380
Like I said it in my, like when I responded to someone's mayor, I was like, I know maybe men had a, but these rats are delusional and crazy even for me.

2345
03:31:20,380 --> 03:31:32,380
Because sometimes people will take something and just like go so far with like, I said, so like, I'll explain to you right now, like what happened when I took the log down the other day.

2346
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:38,380
Um, I didn't like, I'm still on great terms with that person.

2347
03:31:38,380 --> 03:31:43,380
I just didn't know their PL and their PL affects our relationship with other stuff.

2348
03:31:43,380 --> 03:31:44,380
So I had to take it down.

2349
03:31:44,380 --> 03:31:46,380
That's a little, it was really that simple.

2350
03:31:46,380 --> 03:31:49,380
It had nothing to do with that other person and their identity.

2351
03:31:49,380 --> 03:31:51,380
Like it had nothing to do with that.

2352
03:31:51,380 --> 03:31:53,380
Like a little bit because I didn't realize it.

2353
03:31:53,380 --> 03:31:54,380
And then I was like, oh no.

2354
03:31:54,380 --> 03:32:01,380
Um, but that wasn't why I was apologizing because I noticed it like, uh, like during stream actually.

2355
03:32:01,380 --> 03:32:07,380
Um, when I was like dying, when I was like dead and not in the thing.

2356
03:32:07,380 --> 03:32:08,380
And that's fine.

2357
03:32:08,380 --> 03:32:12,380
Like, like I understand it's not going to happen again.

2358
03:32:12,380 --> 03:32:14,380
And if that did bother you, I apologize.

2359
03:32:14,380 --> 03:32:19,380
Um, uh, they are still in a lovely, amazing person, that creator as well.

2360
03:32:19,380 --> 03:32:20,380
Everybody was amazing.

2361
03:32:20,380 --> 03:32:21,380
That was a great collab.

2362
03:32:21,380 --> 03:32:25,380
If you guys saw it, you saw how much fun I was having.

2363
03:32:25,380 --> 03:32:27,380
So it's like, it was fun.

2364
03:32:27,380 --> 03:32:29,380
You don't want to contact them.

2365
03:32:29,380 --> 03:32:30,380
Exactly.

2366
03:32:30,380 --> 03:32:36,380
So like, I like, I realized I talk too much.

2367
03:32:36,380 --> 03:32:46,380
And honestly, I feel like I need to talk less because I sometimes I overshare and I over like kind of explain my feelings.

2368
03:32:46,380 --> 03:32:51,380
And then that leaves room for people to misconstrue and kind of like put in their own narrative.

2369
03:32:51,380 --> 03:32:53,380
And I really don't want that to happen.

2370
03:32:53,380 --> 03:32:58,380
So I'll probably just like not do that anymore.

2371
03:32:58,380 --> 03:33:05,380
Like I realized I need to be kind of like kind of more chill like Emmy does or like I see or Zura or Mercy.

2372
03:33:05,380 --> 03:33:10,380
Like everybody else besides myself in the company to be honest, because I just, I don't shut the fuck up.

2373
03:33:10,380 --> 03:33:12,380
Like that's just my, that's my thing.

2374
03:33:12,380 --> 03:33:13,380
I don't shut up.

2375
03:33:13,380 --> 03:33:16,380
Um, even on social media, like it's also because I'm alone.

2376
03:33:16,380 --> 03:33:18,380
I have no one to fucking talk to.

2377
03:33:18,380 --> 03:33:21,380
The other girls, they're also alone, but like, I don't know.

2378
03:33:21,380 --> 03:33:23,380
It's like they have family and stuff.

2379
03:33:23,380 --> 03:33:24,380
So they have other.

2380
03:33:24,380 --> 03:33:29,380
So like, I just feel like I need to talk and talk and talk and fill a silence besides talking to my cat.

2381
03:33:29,380 --> 03:33:30,380
Oh my God, look at Fia.

2382
03:33:30,380 --> 03:33:31,380
She's like curled up.

2383
03:33:31,380 --> 03:33:36,380
Um, yeah, like I always make that joke, like, uh, move in silence.

2384
03:33:36,380 --> 03:33:38,380
And I'm like, I literally need to do that though.

2385
03:33:38,380 --> 03:33:39,380
I need to shut up.

2386
03:33:39,380 --> 03:33:41,380
I like, cause I know my tweet.

2387
03:33:41,380 --> 03:33:42,380
Like I was still like joke.

2388
03:33:42,380 --> 03:33:48,380
Like, you know, I was joking this morning about like, uh, that like VTuber meme account or whatever, like blocking us or whatever.

2389
03:33:48,380 --> 03:33:50,380
I think I don't actually, I don't think they blocked a Zura.

2390
03:33:50,380 --> 03:33:55,380
They, I think they blocked like everyone else besides a Zura.

2391
03:33:55,380 --> 03:33:57,380
Um, but it's funny.

2392
03:33:57,380 --> 03:33:59,380
And, um, and so I was like, what?

2393
03:33:59,380 --> 03:34:01,380
I thought we had something special, but that's like jokes.

2394
03:34:01,380 --> 03:34:07,380
But I like, I bet there's someone out there that was just like, I can't believe she's starting drama with this.

2395
03:34:07,380 --> 03:34:08,380
I'm like, no, I'm not.

2396
03:34:08,380 --> 03:34:09,380
I'm just memeing.

2397
03:34:09,380 --> 03:34:10,380
I'm just joking.

2398
03:34:10,380 --> 03:34:12,380
I'm just, I'm just messing around.

2399
03:34:12,380 --> 03:34:13,380
I'm kidding.

2400
03:34:13,380 --> 03:34:14,380
I'm joshin.

2401
03:34:14,380 --> 03:34:15,380
I'm jorkin.

2402
03:34:15,380 --> 03:34:16,380
You know?

2403
03:34:16,380 --> 03:34:22,380
Um, you explain and talk more and still listening to people to know what to do.

2404
03:34:22,380 --> 03:34:23,380
Yeah, exactly.

2405
03:34:23,380 --> 03:34:24,380
Uh, I followed you.

2406
03:34:24,380 --> 03:34:26,380
She means I was doing like Harry Potter today.

2407
03:34:26,380 --> 03:34:27,380
Yeah, I just, I don't shut up.

2408
03:34:27,380 --> 03:34:31,380
I don't just shut up about myself cause I like to talk cause I'm lonely.

2409
03:34:31,380 --> 03:34:33,380
Please save me.

2410
03:34:33,380 --> 03:34:38,380
Um, but yeah, no, like it does seem like it's causing problems.

2411
03:34:38,380 --> 03:34:44,380
Like it does seem like it's causing extra stress cause I know some of you guys like in my messages,

2412
03:34:44,380 --> 03:34:48,380
not my messages, my, um, comments were like, are you okay?

2413
03:34:48,380 --> 03:34:49,380
You'll be okay.

2414
03:34:49,380 --> 03:34:50,380
No, it's fine.

2415
03:34:50,380 --> 03:34:54,380
And like you guys were stressed out and I don't want to stress you guys out just because

2416
03:34:54,380 --> 03:34:56,380
I'm saying something stupid on my own.

2417
03:34:56,380 --> 03:34:59,380
You know, like, I don't want to put you guys in that situation where you stress out about

2418
03:34:59,380 --> 03:35:04,380
me or feel scared for me or you think I'm super sad and you're upset because I'm upset.

2419
03:35:04,380 --> 03:35:06,380
I don't want that to happen.

2420
03:35:06,380 --> 03:35:08,380
Like, of course I'll be honest with you.

2421
03:35:08,380 --> 03:35:10,380
Like if I'm upset, I'm going to be like, Hey guys, I'm upset.

2422
03:35:10,380 --> 03:35:15,380
I don't like this, but I don't want to, when it's not that deep, I don't want to say something

2423
03:35:15,380 --> 03:35:18,380
that people like run with it and like freak out about, you know?

2424
03:35:18,380 --> 03:35:20,380
Yeah, text is hard to cover.

2425
03:35:20,380 --> 03:35:22,380
Yeah, it's hard to detect tone and text.

2426
03:35:22,380 --> 03:35:24,380
So like I want to be more careful.

2427
03:35:24,380 --> 03:35:27,380
I'll probably just like, again, I'll still tweet a bunch cause like I don't shut up,

2428
03:35:27,380 --> 03:35:29,380
but I'll just like, like Strani did.

2429
03:35:29,380 --> 03:35:33,380
She's like, you know, you know, I know you, she didn't say it like that.

2430
03:35:33,380 --> 03:35:37,380
I don't want to say something that people will fucking take and run with.

2431
03:35:37,380 --> 03:35:41,380
Um, but strani is like, we should probably not like message negative stuff on our like,

2432
03:35:41,380 --> 03:35:45,380
on our all accounts because people will sometimes like take it and perpetuate a cycle.

2433
03:35:45,380 --> 03:35:46,380
I'm like facts.

2434
03:35:46,380 --> 03:35:49,380
I'm like, and I like was reminded of that the other day.

2435
03:35:49,380 --> 03:35:50,380
She didn't remind me or anything.

2436
03:35:50,380 --> 03:35:51,380
I just remembered it.

2437
03:35:51,380 --> 03:35:52,380
Strani is like, you're fine.

2438
03:35:52,380 --> 03:35:53,380
I don't have to worry about you.

2439
03:35:53,380 --> 03:35:54,380
And she always like checks on me.

2440
03:35:54,380 --> 03:35:55,380
She's like, are you good?

2441
03:35:55,380 --> 03:35:56,380
I'm like, I'm fine.

2442
03:35:56,380 --> 03:35:57,380
And she's like, okay, fine.

2443
03:35:57,380 --> 03:35:58,380
Good.

2444
03:35:58,380 --> 03:35:59,380
That's all I care about.

2445
03:35:59,380 --> 03:36:02,380
Um, but I'm just like, I don't want to stress out.

2446
03:36:02,380 --> 03:36:09,380
People are make a perpetual cycle of like, you know, like people making rats or like,

2447
03:36:09,380 --> 03:36:15,380
um, just like thinking something's bad when it's not on a big deal.

2448
03:36:15,380 --> 03:36:20,380
And then like, yeah, I just like, I don't want people to be stressed out.

2449
03:36:20,380 --> 03:36:25,380
Um, came from the booba staying for the actual human relatability.

2450
03:36:25,380 --> 03:36:26,380
Yeah.

2451
03:36:26,380 --> 03:36:27,380
No, I'm, I'm a normal person.

2452
03:36:27,380 --> 03:36:31,380
I think the thing that makes me a little pretty cool is that we're all pretty chill.

2453
03:36:32,380 --> 03:36:33,380
Yeah.

2454
03:36:33,380 --> 03:36:38,380
I'm going to try to be transparent, but like still have an air of professionalism.

2455
03:36:38,380 --> 03:36:47,380
Like I'm, I'm going to like, I like being man head up because, um, for the, just for

2456
03:36:47,380 --> 03:36:49,380
the reactions and the memes.

2457
03:36:49,380 --> 03:36:56,380
Um, but I realize I have to like reign in like sometimes I'll like, again, like people forget

2458
03:36:56,380 --> 03:36:57,380
that I used to be a YouTube commentator.

2459
03:36:57,380 --> 03:37:02,380
So sometimes you would say something inflammatory, get a reaction to get more content and that's

2460
03:37:02,380 --> 03:37:05,380
not a good idea with becoming a Vtuber.

2461
03:37:05,380 --> 03:37:07,380
It's not a good one.

2462
03:37:07,380 --> 03:37:12,380
Um, it's not this, like I'm still adjusting to how the community works.

2463
03:37:12,380 --> 03:37:16,380
People forget that I've only been a Vtuber since last October.

2464
03:37:16,380 --> 03:37:17,380
Um, I was a Vtuber.

2465
03:37:17,380 --> 03:37:19,380
I was an indie Vtuber for six months.

2466
03:37:19,380 --> 03:37:21,380
Um, then I got picked up by Viller.

2467
03:37:21,380 --> 03:37:25,380
Uh, I ditched, like I was a streamer for five years before that as a fast streamer, but

2468
03:37:25,380 --> 03:37:30,380
in a, in a content creator, but I still don't like the community is still very new to me

2469
03:37:30,380 --> 03:37:31,380
and I'm still learning how it works.

2470
03:37:31,380 --> 03:37:36,380
Although I've done, I've done all my research and I've looked up stuff, but then again, um,

2471
03:37:36,380 --> 03:37:39,380
it's different when you're in a situation and how people react.

2472
03:37:39,380 --> 03:37:45,380
Uh, but yeah, does that make sense?

2473
03:37:45,380 --> 03:37:46,380
Yeah.

2474
03:37:46,380 --> 03:37:47,380
Thank you.

2475
03:37:47,380 --> 03:37:49,380
A little crazy, never hurt.

2476
03:37:49,380 --> 03:37:51,380
But like, I just like, I don't want to make you guys sad.

2477
03:37:51,380 --> 03:37:56,380
Like it made, like it hurt me so much seeing how sad some of you guys were, you know, and

2478
03:37:56,380 --> 03:37:58,380
Boomi, what are you doing?

2479
03:37:58,380 --> 03:38:00,380
Boomi's laying inside of my blanket.

2480
03:38:00,380 --> 03:38:04,380
My blanket's like on the floor and he's like curled up in the blanket.

2481
03:38:04,380 --> 03:38:09,380
Like I'm holding, I have a little bit on me, but he's like, hold it onto himself.

2482
03:38:09,380 --> 03:38:10,380
Name every Vtuber.

2483
03:38:10,380 --> 03:38:11,380
I got you.

2484
03:38:11,380 --> 03:38:15,380
Um, no, but I did because I was very, I'm just new to a thing.

2485
03:38:15,380 --> 03:38:21,380
So I like, I know my special self decided to do so much research and watch so many videos.

2486
03:38:21,380 --> 03:38:27,380
And I like, I caught up on drama that was like years ago, just so I could stay in the loop when

2487
03:38:27,380 --> 03:38:29,380
people talk about stuff.

2488
03:38:29,380 --> 03:38:33,380
Like there are some Vtuber stuff that happened like 2020 that I don't know about.

2489
03:38:33,380 --> 03:38:36,380
And I was like, Oh, let me do some research.

2490
03:38:36,380 --> 03:38:42,380
Oh, who is this secret person from an agency that never technically moved forward because of this

2491
03:38:42,380 --> 03:38:44,380
whole situation and blah, blah, blah, blah.

2492
03:38:44,380 --> 03:38:49,380
And I was like, Oh, um, feeling like at least present.

2493
03:38:49,380 --> 03:38:54,380
Yeah, you know, but it's like, but like, I love making people happy.

2494
03:38:54,380 --> 03:38:55,380
So it gives me energy.

2495
03:38:55,380 --> 03:38:59,380
Like I like, it's literally brings me so much joy to make you guys happy.

2496
03:38:59,380 --> 03:39:05,380
Um, I don't, that's why like another reason why I'm so like worried about people liking me

2497
03:39:05,380 --> 03:39:09,380
because I like, I just strive to make people happy all the time when they can't be happy.

2498
03:39:09,380 --> 03:39:10,380
And it's due to me.

2499
03:39:10,380 --> 03:39:13,380
I get upset because I'm like, what am I, what do I, what can I do to make you happy?

2500
03:39:13,380 --> 03:39:16,380
But then again, I always have to remember I can't do everything.

2501
03:39:16,380 --> 03:39:20,380
You know, like I have to be realistic with myself, but I try.

2502
03:39:20,380 --> 03:39:26,380
Um, I try to like make people as happy as possible because I just all until I want, I became a content

2503
03:39:26,380 --> 03:39:31,380
creator in general because I remember, and I've said this story before, sitting and watching

2504
03:39:32,380 --> 03:39:38,380
YouTubers like freaking PewDiePie and Markiplier when I was like coming home from school, come

2505
03:39:38,380 --> 03:39:42,380
home from school, sit down on my living room floor and turn on the YouTubers.

2506
03:39:42,380 --> 03:39:43,380
I didn't watch TV.

2507
03:39:43,380 --> 03:39:49,380
I watched YouTubers and, um, get laughing and feeling good and feeling like I'm hanging out

2508
03:39:49,380 --> 03:39:52,380
with friends and, and like Jenna Marbles and stuff.

2509
03:39:52,380 --> 03:39:59,380
I freaking love Jenna Marbles and, um, I'm like, I want to be able to be a creator that

2510
03:39:59,380 --> 03:40:00,380
gives us for other people.

2511
03:40:00,380 --> 03:40:01,380
I want to make people happy.

2512
03:40:01,380 --> 03:40:05,380
I want people to come home from work or from school, sit and watch me and be like, wow,

2513
03:40:05,380 --> 03:40:06,380
this is great.

2514
03:40:06,380 --> 03:40:07,380
This is fun.

2515
03:40:07,380 --> 03:40:09,380
Um, Markiplier, she's not dead.

2516
03:40:09,380 --> 03:40:11,380
You don't have to say RIP.

2517
03:40:11,380 --> 03:40:14,380
She's just, she's not, she's not content creator anymore.

2518
03:40:14,380 --> 03:40:18,380
I'll watch Julian from time to time to check up on the dogs.

2519
03:40:18,380 --> 03:40:24,380
He is, he is dreaming and her eye is open, but her like secondary eyelid is over her eye.

2520
03:40:24,380 --> 03:40:26,380
So she looks like she's possessed.

2521
03:40:26,380 --> 03:40:29,380
Um, she's not dead.

2522
03:40:30,380 --> 03:40:31,380
No, I miss her.

2523
03:40:31,380 --> 03:40:32,380
I'll watch her old videos.

2524
03:40:32,380 --> 03:40:35,380
Like I'll literally come for a watch her videos.

2525
03:40:35,380 --> 03:40:37,380
Um, yeah.

2526
03:40:37,380 --> 03:40:40,380
Jenna, Jenna was awesome.

2527
03:40:40,380 --> 03:40:41,380
Yeah, I do.

2528
03:40:41,380 --> 03:40:43,380
I, I, I do care a lot.

2529
03:40:43,380 --> 03:40:45,380
I do care.

2530
03:40:45,380 --> 03:40:53,380
Um, and I try my best and I like, I'll, I'll like, um, take Hania's sneeze again.

2531
03:40:53,380 --> 03:41:07,380
I'll like, um, kind of take the brunt of stuff, um, on the chin, just, uh, just to make sure

2532
03:41:07,380 --> 03:41:08,380
people are happy.

2533
03:41:08,380 --> 03:41:09,380
Cause that's all I want.

2534
03:41:09,380 --> 03:41:14,880
I don't want to, I don't like causing issues, but I feel like, I feel like I over, I over

2535
03:41:14,880 --> 03:41:16,380
try to fix, cause I'm a fixture.

2536
03:41:16,380 --> 03:41:22,380
I over fix things and I try too hard and end up, um, um, oh my.

2537
03:41:22,380 --> 03:41:25,380
My eye is watering.

2538
03:41:25,380 --> 03:41:29,380
I love overdoing it, um, but I don't mean to.

2539
03:41:29,380 --> 03:41:34,380
So like, I just, this has been a very amazing experience for me being a Vtuber and a content

2540
03:41:34,380 --> 03:41:37,380
creator on a greater scale because I'm learning a lot about myself.

2541
03:41:37,380 --> 03:41:38,380
So thank you for that.

2542
03:41:38,380 --> 03:41:40,380
Thank you for this growth opportunity.

2543
03:41:40,380 --> 03:41:43,380
I appreciate you guys.

2544
03:41:43,380 --> 03:41:44,380
No, I know.

2545
03:41:44,380 --> 03:41:48,380
Like I was fine while I was eating my food and then I just died again.

2546
03:41:53,380 --> 03:41:57,380
I'm glad that I can help you guys feel less hopeless.

2547
03:41:57,380 --> 03:41:58,380
I'm so sorry.

2548
03:41:58,380 --> 03:42:02,380
Like I know some of you guys go through stuff and you come in and you use Vtubers and as

2549
03:42:02,380 --> 03:42:07,380
an escape, cause I like, I do the same thing and I use streaming as an escape cause like

2550
03:42:07,380 --> 03:42:18,380
after the real world, man, for real, for real, no cap, facts, printer, no ink, no ink.

2551
03:42:18,380 --> 03:42:23,380
Um, I promise you I'm not crying.

2552
03:42:23,380 --> 03:42:26,380
I'm literally just dying from my allergies.

2553
03:42:26,380 --> 03:42:29,380
Um, cause I know you guys say I'm a cry baby too.

2554
03:42:29,380 --> 03:42:30,380
You get it.

2555
03:42:30,380 --> 03:42:32,380
You can chat with flex streaming.

2556
03:42:32,380 --> 03:42:40,380
Um, but yeah, I know people go through shit and like I'm very sympathetic to that and

2557
03:42:40,380 --> 03:42:41,380
I'm pathetic to that.

2558
03:42:41,380 --> 03:42:44,380
So I get it.

2559
03:42:45,380 --> 03:42:48,380
Did you come at a bad time?

2560
03:42:48,380 --> 03:42:51,380
Yeah.

2561
03:42:51,380 --> 03:42:55,380
I was going to make a really bad perverted joke, but I'm going to stop.

2562
03:42:55,380 --> 03:42:56,380
I'm going to stop myself.

2563
03:42:56,380 --> 03:42:57,380
No, I'm just sneezing.

2564
03:42:57,380 --> 03:42:58,380
I'm just sneezing.

2565
03:42:58,380 --> 03:43:01,380
I have really bad allergies, but thank you for showing up.

2566
03:43:01,380 --> 03:43:02,380
Your streams are really entertaining.

2567
03:43:02,380 --> 03:43:04,380
So, oh, thank you.

2568
03:43:04,380 --> 03:43:06,380
Yeah, I just like, I like my chat interaction.

2569
03:43:06,380 --> 03:43:08,380
I just like talking to you guys.

2570
03:43:08,380 --> 03:43:13,380
This is, it's as great for me as it is for you cause I know the serotonin people get when

2571
03:43:13,380 --> 03:43:20,380
I talk to them, you know, so premature fewer.

2572
03:43:20,380 --> 03:43:24,380
Why do you have the Brazilian flag when you're covering your nose?

2573
03:43:24,380 --> 03:43:25,380
Are you using that?

2574
03:43:25,380 --> 03:43:27,380
Are you using the Brazilian flag?

2575
03:43:27,380 --> 03:43:30,380
That is disrespectful.

2576
03:43:30,380 --> 03:43:32,380
Brazil.

2577
03:43:32,380 --> 03:43:37,380
I remember some lady, like somebody was speaking Portuguese and I was like, Oh, do you speak

2578
03:43:37,380 --> 03:43:38,380
Portuguese?

2579
03:43:38,380 --> 03:43:39,380
She's like, are you Brazilian?

2580
03:43:39,380 --> 03:43:41,380
I'm like, no, I just know what Portuguese sounds like.

2581
03:43:41,380 --> 03:43:47,380
She's like, Oh, sneezes in Brazilian.

2582
03:43:47,380 --> 03:43:49,380
Oh, okay.

2583
03:43:49,380 --> 03:43:51,380
No, I made the Sculpa.

2584
03:43:51,380 --> 03:43:52,380
Okay.

2585
03:43:52,380 --> 03:43:53,380
Got you.

2586
03:43:53,380 --> 03:43:55,380
The Brazilians hit.

2587
03:43:55,380 --> 03:43:58,380
That's the way for a moment.

2588
03:43:58,380 --> 03:43:59,380
You died.

2589
03:43:59,380 --> 03:44:01,380
I wish I could like, I need an overlay.

2590
03:44:01,380 --> 03:44:06,380
That just lets me do the you died screen when I will like just feel like it.

2591
03:44:06,380 --> 03:44:09,380
So I can play it on games when I'm not even playing.

2592
03:44:09,380 --> 03:44:13,380
I was like, Hey, you're better than 99%.

2593
03:44:13,380 --> 03:44:16,380
No, it just sounds like it sounds like I'm pretty.

2594
03:44:16,380 --> 03:44:19,380
If I hear it often enough, I can know I can differentiate.

2595
03:44:19,380 --> 03:44:28,380
Like I knew like when he was like watching a video on like, um, what it was, it was a

2596
03:44:28,380 --> 03:44:32,380
like putting on the outfit for like VTube studio for what she got from booth.

2597
03:44:32,380 --> 03:44:34,380
It was like suddenly like Mandarin.

2598
03:44:34,380 --> 03:44:37,380
And I'm just like, I thought Amy was speaking Chinese.

2599
03:44:37,380 --> 03:44:39,380
I like looked, I wasn't looking.

2600
03:44:39,380 --> 03:44:41,380
I was like doing other stuff.

2601
03:44:41,380 --> 03:44:42,380
Excuse me.

2602
03:44:42,380 --> 03:44:44,380
Cause I was feeding Fia.

2603
03:44:44,380 --> 03:44:50,380
And, um, I'm just like, I'm like, is it me?

2604
03:44:50,380 --> 03:44:53,380
I was like, Oh, wait, no, that was not her.

2605
03:44:53,380 --> 03:44:58,380
Well, like, I like, I like, I can tell this like Chinese doesn't sound like Japanese or Korean.

2606
03:44:58,380 --> 03:45:05,380
Um, and I, I always, uh, a lot of my, I remember my customers in the past cause I had a lot of

2607
03:45:05,380 --> 03:45:10,380
international customers at my last job cause I worked in sales and customer service.

2608
03:45:10,380 --> 03:45:14,380
But I, they would like to talk and I'd be like, Oh, you're speaking in certain language here.

2609
03:45:14,380 --> 03:45:15,380
They're like, how did you know that?

2610
03:45:15,380 --> 03:45:16,380
Do you speak it?

2611
03:45:16,380 --> 03:45:20,380
And I'm like, no, I just pay attention.

2612
03:45:20,380 --> 03:45:21,380
I see me somewhere.

2613
03:45:21,380 --> 03:45:22,380
Portugese.

2614
03:45:22,380 --> 03:45:23,380
No.

2615
03:45:29,380 --> 03:45:30,380
Does that mean good night?

2616
03:45:30,380 --> 03:45:32,380
I don't know.

2617
03:45:32,380 --> 03:45:35,380
I don't, I can't read Portuguese.

2618
03:45:35,380 --> 03:45:36,380
Portugese.

2619
03:45:36,380 --> 03:45:39,380
To be honest, I'm too shy to actually speak up.

2620
03:45:39,380 --> 03:45:41,380
90 times for some of the time I'm hanging out on streams.

2621
03:45:41,380 --> 03:45:44,380
I start feel guilty for saying too much of stream's attention from regular to deserve it.

2622
03:45:44,380 --> 03:45:45,380
That's not true.

2623
03:45:45,380 --> 03:45:46,380
You are a regular.

2624
03:45:46,380 --> 03:45:47,380
You're just a lurker.

2625
03:45:47,380 --> 03:45:49,380
Like, don't worry about it, bro.

2626
03:45:49,380 --> 03:45:50,380
Don't worry about it.

2627
03:45:50,380 --> 03:45:52,380
I'm happy you're here either way.

2628
03:45:52,380 --> 03:45:54,380
You're not taken away from anyone.

2629
03:45:54,380 --> 03:45:56,380
Everybody, everybody's happy to be here.

2630
03:45:56,380 --> 03:46:00,380
Everybody's happy to be together and hang out with people that also have a common shared

2631
03:46:00,380 --> 03:46:04,380
interest of a Vtuber that they like, that they can all support together.

2632
03:46:04,380 --> 03:46:09,380
Why do you think Azura's Dorothon is so successful right now?

2633
03:46:09,380 --> 03:46:10,380
Which is awesome, by the way.

2634
03:46:10,380 --> 03:46:11,380
Like, holy crap.

2635
03:46:11,380 --> 03:46:14,380
Like, it's great.

2636
03:46:14,380 --> 03:46:17,380
You know, everyone's welcome.

2637
03:46:17,380 --> 03:46:18,380
Yeah.

2638
03:46:18,380 --> 03:46:20,380
Like, we love lurkers here.

2639
03:46:20,380 --> 03:46:21,380
16k.

2640
03:46:21,380 --> 03:46:22,380
Holy crap.

2641
03:46:22,380 --> 03:46:25,380
That's how much I'm in debt.

2642
03:46:25,380 --> 03:46:26,380
Yeah.

2643
03:46:26,380 --> 03:46:28,380
Like, I lurk streams.

2644
03:46:28,380 --> 03:46:31,380
I get it.

2645
03:46:31,380 --> 03:46:35,380
Sometimes I'll mostly lurk streams because I don't want people to, like, call me out and

2646
03:46:35,380 --> 03:46:37,380
be like, oh my god, chibi con bum.

2647
03:46:37,380 --> 03:46:40,380
And then I'll just go on my alt if I'm super, super worried about that.

2648
03:46:40,380 --> 03:46:43,380
Because sometimes I do want to talk in a stream.

2649
03:46:43,380 --> 03:46:46,380
Yeah, we're all here to get justice for boomy.

2650
03:46:46,380 --> 03:46:47,380
No.

2651
03:46:47,380 --> 03:46:48,380
Yeah.

2652
03:46:48,380 --> 03:46:53,380
Like, honestly, I was like, Shani was asking me, she's like, what do you want to do for

2653
03:46:53,380 --> 03:46:54,380
your Dorothon?

2654
03:46:54,380 --> 03:46:56,380
Like, what are you thinking about?

2655
03:46:56,380 --> 03:47:01,380
And I'm like, I know Azura put hers at 10k, but like, I might start mine off at 5k.

2656
03:47:01,380 --> 03:47:05,380
Because, like, I don't think anybody's going to donate to me.

2657
03:47:05,380 --> 03:47:08,380
Because we're all just like, like, we're all so new.

2658
03:47:08,380 --> 03:47:12,380
Like, why would anybody donate such a broad amount?

2659
03:47:12,380 --> 03:47:18,380
Like, I'm like, I'll see how Azura goes and then we'll see.

2660
03:47:18,380 --> 03:47:20,380
And then Azura's blowing it out of the water.

2661
03:47:20,380 --> 03:47:22,380
And I'm just like, holy crap.

2662
03:47:22,380 --> 03:47:23,380
Like, that's amazing.

2663
03:47:23,380 --> 03:47:24,380
I'm so happy for her, guys.

2664
03:47:24,380 --> 03:47:25,380
Like, you guys have no idea.

2665
03:47:25,380 --> 03:47:29,380
She needs to get out of the house.

2666
03:47:29,380 --> 03:47:31,380
She's just so much happier.

2667
03:47:31,380 --> 03:47:36,380
And like, I know she wants to be productive and like, living there prevents her from being

2668
03:47:36,380 --> 03:47:37,380
productive.

2669
03:47:37,380 --> 03:47:40,380
And then like, I know that I also help with our like health stuff.

2670
03:47:40,380 --> 03:47:44,380
So I'm just, I'm really happy people like actually came together.

2671
03:47:44,380 --> 03:47:46,380
I know some people like don't like donathons.

2672
03:47:46,380 --> 03:47:49,380
And I totally understand that.

2673
03:47:49,380 --> 03:47:53,380
But like, think of it as just like the opportunity to just crowdfund project.

2674
03:47:53,380 --> 03:47:59,380
If you, if you come together to crowdfund someone for something, something for someone

2675
03:47:59,380 --> 03:48:01,380
that gives them more motivation to work on projects.

2676
03:48:01,380 --> 03:48:05,380
Like, again, I'm using mine to pay off some debt and then work on projects.

2677
03:48:05,380 --> 03:48:08,380
And then since I have less debt, I have more money to put towards projects.

2678
03:48:08,380 --> 03:48:10,380
Guys, I pay, I pay for my own games.

2679
03:48:10,380 --> 03:48:12,380
I paid for all the outfits.

2680
03:48:12,380 --> 03:48:16,380
Like I sometimes put some of the outfits on booth, but I decided to stop doing that.

2681
03:48:16,380 --> 03:48:18,380
I set up a lot of stuff.

2682
03:48:18,380 --> 03:48:21,380
I spent $200 the other day getting stuff together.

2683
03:48:21,380 --> 03:48:23,380
I spent another $100 for the summer.

2684
03:48:23,380 --> 03:48:26,380
We need to like, I put money into my streams.

2685
03:48:26,380 --> 03:48:27,380
Like I put effort.

2686
03:48:27,380 --> 03:48:30,380
I know the other girls too, too, immensely.

2687
03:48:30,380 --> 03:48:37,380
So I, it's awesome when people see that support, recognize it and want to give back.

2688
03:48:37,380 --> 03:48:40,380
Thank you so much Snufkin Nate for the 20 gifted.

2689
03:48:40,380 --> 03:48:41,380
Oh my gosh.

2690
03:48:41,380 --> 03:48:42,380
Thank you.

2691
03:48:42,380 --> 03:48:45,380
Everybody say thank you if you got one.

2692
03:48:45,380 --> 03:48:47,380

2693
03:48:47,380 --> 03:48:49,380
Nifty.

2694
03:48:49,380 --> 03:48:51,380
I need a sneeze.

2695
03:48:51,380 --> 03:48:53,380

2696
03:48:53,380 --> 03:48:55,380

2697
03:48:55,380 --> 03:48:57,380

2698
03:48:57,380 --> 03:49:04,380

2700
03:49:07,380 --> 03:49:10,380
Oh, thank you.

I appreciate it.

2702
03:49:11,380 --> 03:49:15,380
Well, yeah.

2703
03:49:15,380 --> 03:49:18,380
I need a sneeze again.

2704
03:49:18,380 --> 03:49:22,380
Choo!

2705
03:49:22,380 --> 03:49:25,380
Are my boobies trickle every time I sneeze?

2706
03:49:25,380 --> 03:49:28,380
I don't know.

2707
03:49:28,380 --> 03:49:29,380
Are we dodging gifted?

2708
03:49:29,380 --> 03:49:30,380
I know.

2709
03:49:30,380 --> 03:49:32,380
Yeah, you don't, you don't get the much either.

2710
03:49:32,380 --> 03:49:34,380
Where's that one gay harlot?

2711
03:49:34,380 --> 03:49:36,380
I think they're greedy now.

2712
03:49:36,380 --> 03:49:40,380
Because we have to get a different account.

2713
03:49:40,380 --> 03:49:43,380
The feet look so nice.

2714
03:49:43,380 --> 03:49:45,380
I don't sneeze that much though.

2715
03:49:45,380 --> 03:49:47,380
It's literally because I have allergies.

2716
03:49:47,380 --> 03:49:49,380
I've listened to any Brazilian music.

2717
03:49:49,380 --> 03:49:51,380
Yeah, I have.

2718
03:49:51,380 --> 03:49:54,380
I've listened to Brazilian music before.

2719
03:49:54,380 --> 03:49:55,380
It's pretty good.

2720
03:49:55,380 --> 03:49:58,380
I like listening to different countries music.

2721
03:49:58,380 --> 03:50:02,380
As people know, as I blasted.

2722
03:50:02,380 --> 03:50:03,380
Some..

2723
03:50:03,380 --> 03:50:04,380
El Alfa?

2724
03:50:04,380 --> 03:50:07,380
Just, when I was fighting..

2725
03:50:07,380 --> 03:50:08,380
Margette.

2726
03:50:08,380 --> 03:50:09,380
Margot, Marget..

2727
03:50:11,380 --> 03:50:14,380
Margette the Fellowman..

03:50:14,380 --> 03:50:16,380
I need覺得 drink.

2729
03:50:16,380 --> 03:50:18,380
I might throw..

2730
03:50:18,380 --> 03:50:20,380
I'm debating so.

2731
03:50:20,380 --> 03:50:22,380
I'm debating whether or not to pull out

2732
03:50:22,380 --> 03:50:26,380
black myth Wu Kong on thrown..

2733
03:50:26,380 --> 03:50:31,380
I might just have to buy it myself because I don't think it's available on throne yet. So I'll probably just buy that myself

2734
03:50:34,220 --> 03:50:41,460
And instead I'll put a new mouse on throne because my mouse is fucking dying. Does anybody have any recommendations for mice?

2735
03:50:42,660 --> 03:50:44,860
Three for three with the free member. Let's go

2736
03:50:46,860 --> 03:50:49,260
Yeah, that's true. I'm a bot one

2737
03:50:50,500 --> 03:50:53,620
You're just like I'm gonna get people gave for me. That's all right

2738
03:50:54,620 --> 03:50:57,660
Did I ever get the hoodie? Oh, yeah, I got the hoodie. I just got it

2739
03:50:57,660 --> 03:51:02,940
Um, I did just get the hoodie, you know, it was really funny. I put it on. It's comfy. It fits me really well

2740
03:51:03,100 --> 03:51:06,300
It's not as oversized as I want it to be because my boobs are so big

2741
03:51:09,500 --> 03:51:14,540
I was like really bummed by that I like really that's why I got like I ordered like an extra large. Oh

2742
03:51:15,740 --> 03:51:17,740
And I'm like my booby too big

2743
03:51:19,980 --> 03:51:21,980

I had the same one the shroud uses and I had that for years and then I

2746
03:51:29,780 --> 03:51:33,820
I don't know what I spilled in it, but like when the keys got sticky. I try to fix it didn't work out

2753
03:51:57,860 --> 03:51:59,860
Probably like eight or nine years

2754
03:52:00,660 --> 03:52:03,420
I've had this death at her chroma for a while. It was just laying around

2755
03:52:04,460 --> 03:52:06,300
um, I

2756
03:52:06,300 --> 03:52:11,700
Usually use lot yaw logitech or razor perfumes. I remember I remember I

2757
03:52:12,420 --> 03:52:19,380
Like my first giveaway ever one was for a logitech headset and I was like, oh my god. Now. I have a razor black shark

2758
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:21,300

2759
03:52:21,300 --> 03:52:24,340

The razor black widow and then I have a razor. Yeah, I use I like razor a lot

2761
03:52:30,420 --> 03:52:35,620
Like razor is pretty good. It's just kind of like, you know brand hype and stuff. I get sponsored by razor. They're sick

2762
03:52:36,060 --> 03:52:40,860
All of all the the quartz stuff because pink is my favorite color. You guys know light pink. Oh, I love light pink

2763
03:52:41,700 --> 03:52:43,700
Um

2764
03:52:44,820 --> 03:52:48,380
You have three death hours double. Yeah, yeah, I've had this for a while though

2765
03:52:48,380 --> 03:52:54,100
Like so I'm surprised it lasted this long this this mouse. I did but like what's the I had a

2766
03:53:04,580 --> 03:53:07,680
Yeah, I did 303 before it shot up

2767
03:53:08,680 --> 03:53:10,680
Um because shroud uses it

2768
03:53:12,520 --> 03:53:14,840
Yeah, I got it for like literally like 40 bucks

2769
03:53:16,000 --> 03:53:19,240
Brand new first time I had one. I've gone through two

2770
03:53:19,920 --> 03:53:26,680
The second one I got scammed on because I got it from eBay and somebody like I asked if it double-clicked and they said no and then

2771
03:53:26,960 --> 03:53:31,760
Double-clicked one immediately when I got it and I'm like, dude, is it me but I had other people use it

2772
03:53:31,760 --> 03:53:34,100
I had my dad use it and he was like, no

2773
03:53:34,400 --> 03:53:38,120
He's like, this is the mouse and my dad my dad's a tech guy

2774
03:53:38,120 --> 03:53:42,360
He he will work on the fixed computers too. So he's like, yeah, no, this is this is junk

2775
03:53:42,360 --> 03:53:45,120
I don't like damn it. So that's when I you start using my razor

2776
03:53:46,760 --> 03:53:49,920
Again, I be so cool

2777
03:53:52,760 --> 03:53:54,880

Trackball nice really nice 70 carpal tunnel issues trackball

2779
03:53:59,400 --> 03:54:04,320
Look and then my mouse is going because like I was using it earlier before I started to stream

2780
03:54:04,320 --> 03:54:11,400
I thought I was gonna have to cancel stream because my mouse completely froze and the tracker the laser wasn't working at all. Oh

2781
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:16,600
My god, my magic kicking in making me sleepy shit

2782
03:54:18,920 --> 03:54:23,160
Yeah, I know it's it's it's it's 1155 for me I

2783
03:54:24,160 --> 03:54:29,520
Could say wait owns. I don't know how to say it in Spanish because I know

2784
03:54:35,520 --> 03:54:37,520
Once I don't remember

2785
03:54:38,640 --> 03:54:39,960
Shabibi

2786
03:54:39,960 --> 03:54:41,960
Yeah, I take something called

2787
03:54:42,880 --> 03:54:45,120
Adarax, which is good for

2788
03:54:47,160 --> 03:54:52,280
Insomnia, but also for like just generalized anxiety and it's also doubles as into histamine

2789
03:54:53,120 --> 03:54:54,280
um

2790
03:54:54,280 --> 03:54:56,280
Which is because it's normally antihistamine

2791
03:54:58,760 --> 03:55:00,760
One say do say yeah

2792
03:55:03,440 --> 03:55:05,440
And so

2793
03:55:10,520 --> 03:55:17,040
My mom says it's my diet Xanax, so I started calling it my diet Xanax. I usually sleep because I have insomnia

2794
03:55:17,920 --> 03:55:21,800
I don't even know why I have insomnia. I've just always had insomnia. My dad has insomnia, too

2795
03:55:21,800 --> 03:55:26,520
I'm like, it's a genetic thing like I didn't think insomnia was like that. It's fucking stupid

2796
03:55:28,200 --> 03:55:31,240
You say I'm out. I don't know what that means

2797
03:55:33,120 --> 03:55:36,160
He's being Portuguese and I wish I could understand you

2798
03:55:37,760 --> 03:55:39,760
Dyes

2799
03:55:40,760 --> 03:55:43,120
Now I forget what the other name for it is

2800
03:55:44,080 --> 03:55:51,720
But yeah, I take that for sleep and then I take my my other anxiety man cuz I have anxiety I

my searcher lean because I

2803
03:55:58,360 --> 03:56:01,640
Like for I don't I said this before like for six months

2804
03:56:01,640 --> 03:56:04,880
I like was really agoraphobic and I couldn't leave my house

2805
03:56:05,360 --> 03:56:10,040
And I don't like now in hindsight. I'm like why but I was just like I was just so I

2806
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:13,440
Was so terrified of people

2807
03:56:15,400 --> 03:56:21,680
Cuz I I did like a temporary work from home job and then like it was hard for me to leave my house now

2808
03:56:21,680 --> 03:56:25,640
I'm fine. So that's it's crazy how like irrational stuff can happen

2809
03:56:26,920 --> 03:56:28,040
I

2810
03:56:28,040 --> 03:56:30,040
Got depression

2811
03:56:30,400 --> 03:56:32,400
Anxiety and depression

2812
03:56:32,800 --> 03:56:39,400
It's basically yeah, and pretty much is but the strict prescription better drill not gonna lie knows German

2813
03:56:40,640 --> 03:56:43,580
Cool, I don't know German. I only know English

2814
03:56:45,800 --> 03:56:49,960
Terrifying people that's a destiny. Yeah, they're all they're all dicks people in New England are so cold

2815
03:56:50,160 --> 03:56:52,760
Like when I went to Florida, like they're every so pretty nice

2816
03:56:53,880 --> 03:56:59,160
Everybody's so nice and warm and fuck cuz it's like, you know, it's warm there. We're all we're all cold and hard up here

2817
03:56:59,720 --> 03:57:01,780
Yeah, rock hard if you know what I mean

2818
03:57:03,160 --> 03:57:06,200
18 achy cowboys, sorry hard

2819
03:57:06,560 --> 03:57:08,560
I

2820
03:57:08,920 --> 03:57:10,920
Heard wanting to miss

2821
03:57:14,400 --> 03:57:17,840
She bad dick it does that yeah, you know, like that's how I was though

2822
03:57:17,840 --> 03:57:21,960
I had anxiety like I literally couldn't so I made it so get a do tell a health

2823
03:57:22,200 --> 03:57:26,080
That's my suggestion you I did tell a health and I hate talking on the phone

2824
03:57:26,080 --> 03:57:31,000
I had my mom with me to help me like you need to find someone that can assist you and

2825
03:57:31,320 --> 03:57:35,560
Then because that's the hardest step is like making a phone call and like talking on the phone is hard

2826
03:57:37,080 --> 03:57:41,440
I got a g autism anxiety depression etc. I'm probably other things too

2827
03:57:41,880 --> 03:57:44,920
You got the you got the whole you got the royal flush brother

2828
03:57:46,200 --> 03:57:50,560
No, like yeah, like I like I have dysthenia which is my long-term depression

2829
03:57:50,560 --> 03:57:53,720
But I haven't really experienced symptoms for that in a long time because I manage it

2830
03:57:53,720 --> 03:57:58,520
Well, like I go to therapy and I meant I take my meds and then like I do stuff

2831
03:57:58,520 --> 03:58:02,840
So like I know I come off as being crazy, but like I honestly

2832
03:58:03,560 --> 03:58:05,560
Um

2833
03:58:05,960 --> 03:58:11,840
Some of it is put on some of it is cuz again like I said cuz I liked seeing your guys's reactions when I act out and

2834
03:58:13,360 --> 03:58:15,360
But like

2835
03:58:15,880 --> 03:58:19,080
Yeah, mostly so much cat bow

2836
03:58:23,360 --> 03:58:29,680
No, that's it that's the same thing like I like and it's funny cuz like you like I had I had to say I could not

2837
03:58:29,680 --> 03:58:33,840
I would didn't want anybody to look at me. It was literally that I did not want anybody to look at me

2838
03:58:33,840 --> 03:58:37,400
So I totally get that and like I was having some really like

2839
03:58:38,320 --> 03:58:41,560
Insecurity issues and I was I was fine. I'm the same as I am now

2840
03:58:41,760 --> 03:58:46,680
But it's like sometimes your mind just like really shits on you, you know, so I get it

2841
03:58:48,280 --> 03:58:52,760
I need to cure my depression is money for sure honestly, that's that's so real

2842
03:58:53,600 --> 03:58:56,840
That's so real though. It really is

2843
03:58:57,120 --> 03:58:59,120
um

2844
03:58:59,400 --> 03:59:01,400
But yeah

2845
03:59:01,920 --> 03:59:03,920
She views are Elmo

2846
03:59:04,400 --> 03:59:10,600
Well, it's like I like I know like guys don't usually have the like the space to talk about that stuff anyway, so like of course

2847
03:59:11,240 --> 03:59:14,280
Of course you like you can do that with me. That's fine

2848
03:59:14,440 --> 03:59:18,840
Like I'm allowing it right now like normally it's in like I don't like this stuff

2849
03:59:18,840 --> 03:59:21,280
But it's like obviously in the context of what we're talking about

2850
03:59:21,280 --> 03:59:24,120
I'm not gonna be like shut up or only gonna talk about my trauma

2851
03:59:24,600 --> 03:59:28,320
Like sometimes you need someone to like tell you like hey, you got this and I'm telling you all now

2852
03:59:28,320 --> 03:59:31,200
Like hey, you got this like you guys are probably going through something right now

2853
03:59:31,360 --> 03:59:34,280
Some of you and I'm like, hey, you know, you got this like

2854
03:59:34,640 --> 03:59:40,720
Think about all this shit that you've been through before and think about where you are now and like I bet some of you guys have been

2855
03:59:40,720 --> 03:59:45,840
Through some shit and you're still standing so give yourself some credit, you know, like I remember like

2856
03:59:46,120 --> 03:59:49,920
Like I'll do the same thing for myself. Like sometimes I'll be like, oh my god like

2857
03:59:50,800 --> 03:59:56,160
Holy crap, how am I gonna deal with this and then I'm like, you know what I've dealt with way worse

2858
03:59:56,560 --> 03:59:59,920
Like we will all be okay, you know, we'll be okay

2859
04:00:01,400 --> 04:00:03,600
My sleep ASMR helps you I'm so glad

2860
04:00:05,400 --> 04:00:09,120
Okay guys, I think I'm too sleepy to finish this so I'm just gonna talk to you

2861
04:00:09,120 --> 04:00:12,880
I can't focus because my my meds have definitely kicked in I can feel it

2862
04:00:13,680 --> 04:00:16,480
And it's gonna make me tired so I won't be able to focus on this

2863
04:00:17,200 --> 04:00:21,200
But I will probably like I kind of want to play this again

2864
04:00:23,000 --> 04:00:25,000
I guess I just like wedding which a lot

2865
04:00:26,880 --> 04:00:33,040
Yeah facts ain't that that's true when he came I happen is so many people don't have to pay for their health. Oh my god facts

2866
04:00:35,400 --> 04:00:42,120
My anxiety seeking and heart still going to college while working part-time 32 hour. Yeah, that's hard. That's difficult. I used to work 40 hours

2867
04:00:43,080 --> 04:00:44,840
And I worked with people all the time

2868
04:00:44,840 --> 04:00:48,000
So I totally it's stressful because it's like for me

2869
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:52,560
It's like a lot of stuff I can't control and like unknowable stuff so it can be a little distressed

2870
04:00:52,600 --> 04:00:54,860
But you got this you got this don't worry about this

2871
04:00:56,120 --> 04:01:02,240
You'll be okay, you'll make it work and in the end when after you after you get everything sorted out

2872
04:01:02,680 --> 04:01:04,920
You will boomie. Can you not chew on my headphones?

2873
04:01:04,920 --> 04:01:09,320
I'm trying to make it as a motivational speech and boomies chewing on my headphones

2874
04:01:09,560 --> 04:01:15,160
You'll come out on the other side and you'll be amazing and then you'll be way better for it, you know

2875
04:01:17,040 --> 04:01:22,920
Max would ask what was wrong if I was having a told her her responses. Are you really upset by that? Oh, that sucks

2876
04:01:23,960 --> 04:01:30,700
That sucks. It's like you definitely gets hard. I bet it's hard to like you got to find a partner that will

2877
04:01:31,340 --> 04:01:33,340
um

2878
04:01:33,660 --> 04:01:38,060
Listen to you and then you know check to see if you want a solution

2879
04:01:38,620 --> 04:01:40,620
Or if you just want to be heard

2880
04:01:40,620 --> 04:01:44,300
Because sometimes people just want to be heard, you know, like sometimes people just want to vent

2881
04:01:45,100 --> 04:01:48,860
Like you don't have to like I like I know like my friends would come and tell me stuff

2882
04:01:48,940 --> 04:01:52,300
Like I'm like, oh, you want me to fix it and they're like, no, I just want to talk to you

2883
04:01:52,300 --> 04:01:54,700
I'm like facts. Okay. Let me work on that

2884
04:01:55,580 --> 04:01:59,180
Um, so I've worked on that and now I'm I'm way more understanding

2885
04:01:59,420 --> 04:02:01,980
and sometimes you need someone to come to you and be like

2886
04:02:02,700 --> 04:02:03,820
uh

2887
04:02:03,820 --> 04:02:06,860
You can tell them about stuff and then be like, okay, and then

2888
04:02:07,660 --> 04:02:10,300
just like validate your emotions and stuff and then

2889
04:02:10,780 --> 04:02:15,020
You know come up with a plan of attack if you want to or just like, you know, just give you a hug

2890
04:02:15,580 --> 04:02:17,580
It sucks even for small stuff

2891
04:02:17,900 --> 04:02:22,300
Like I like as you can come to me and be like someone ate my cookie and I'll be like, bro

2892
04:02:22,860 --> 04:02:24,860
Fuck them like honestly

2893
04:02:25,820 --> 04:02:29,660
Or I could be like, let's make a plan to kill them for the cookie. No

2894
04:02:32,300 --> 04:02:34,300
Yeah, of course

2895
04:02:35,660 --> 04:02:39,660
Sometimes sometimes just guys people need to hear stuff and like I will be like

2896
04:02:39,660 --> 04:02:43,660
I'm glad to be that person to tell you what you you know, you need to hear in a moment

2897
04:02:46,140 --> 04:02:48,140
Yeah, like

2898
04:02:48,460 --> 04:02:50,460
Facts

2899
04:02:52,220 --> 04:02:53,660
Yeah, not immediately trying to fix it

2900
04:02:53,660 --> 04:02:57,740
This problem is something that took me a long time to learn to do and I like I still struggle with that

2901
04:02:57,820 --> 04:03:00,460
But thankfully not as much like I so yeah

2902
04:03:01,420 --> 04:03:03,980
I wish good things for people over. Hope she's treatment

2903
04:03:05,740 --> 04:03:09,020
Yeah, that's like that's a good point. That's a good point

2904
04:03:10,460 --> 04:03:14,460
Yeah, she's again, that's an X. She's X for a reason. She's not she wasn't there for you

2905
04:03:14,460 --> 04:03:19,660
So I hope you find someone a lot better that actually like takes care of you and validates your feelings

2906
04:03:20,060 --> 04:03:22,460
Everybody deserves that everybody deserves someone that like

2907
04:03:23,100 --> 04:03:30,540
Will hear about their their feelings and opinions and give them give them the response that they need. Everybody deserves that

2908
04:03:34,140 --> 04:03:35,260
Good night

2909
04:03:35,260 --> 04:03:41,500
Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. You know what I'm saying. You know what I'm trying to say

2910
04:03:42,300 --> 04:03:46,140
I got some killer social anxiety and continues to go into doctor's appointment and searching medicine. I know

2911
04:03:46,460 --> 04:03:50,380
Yeah, oh someone who has gone through like a rigmarole of stuff

2912
04:03:51,020 --> 04:03:56,860
Um, it could be especially not knowing if something works and stuff take could take like a couple months to kick in

2913
04:03:57,260 --> 04:03:59,260
It can be really annoying

2914
04:04:00,140 --> 04:04:02,140
It can be really really really dumb

2915
04:04:02,940 --> 04:04:04,940
um stressful stressful moment

2916
04:04:05,420 --> 04:04:06,620
but like

2917
04:04:06,700 --> 04:04:11,580
And it but then it takes I know it's taken me like years to like find the right combination

2918
04:04:11,900 --> 04:04:15,740
And then like I've switched and stuff like I was on different stuff before that worked for me

2919
04:04:16,140 --> 04:04:20,460
And then I went on something because first other stuff because like before I had like prozac for depression

2920
04:04:20,940 --> 04:04:26,700
Like more like anxiety stuff. So they're like, oh, let's try this instead. I'm like, okay. Sure. Let's try it

2921
04:04:26,700 --> 04:04:30,700
I'm like, oh, this actually works fine. But like it takes time and money

2922
04:04:32,140 --> 04:04:34,140
I didn't tell you guys how much

2923
04:04:35,100 --> 04:04:40,140
My meds cost on my new insurance because I didn't want you to get mad

2924
04:04:44,140 --> 04:04:46,140
Oh my god

2925
04:04:46,220 --> 04:04:49,100
This is repenting. I'm super appreciative you to learn you're in particular

2926
04:04:49,260 --> 04:04:54,380
But do you look loneliness and you've all really helped? I'm so glad I'm so glad because like I know

2927
04:04:55,420 --> 04:04:57,740
I want you guys to guess how much it was. Um

2928
04:04:59,340 --> 04:05:02,460
Again, has someone who also struggles with loneliness because I just love my three cats

2929
04:05:02,460 --> 04:05:06,060
Like this is really helpful for me myself as well. So you're not alone in that

2930
04:05:06,620 --> 04:05:11,820
Everybody deserves some like companionship. We've always say like, oh the internet like, oh, it's not real

2931
04:05:12,780 --> 04:05:14,780
I'm like, no

2932
04:05:14,780 --> 04:05:17,020
Sometimes the internet relationships are the most realist ones

2933
04:05:18,780 --> 04:05:25,260
It was not one K. No, it was it was it was like, I think like a hundred and fifty like a hundred and forty dollars

2934
04:05:27,980 --> 04:05:31,340
How much is my urgent care copay, I don't even remember I don't even look at that

2935
04:05:32,780 --> 04:05:35,340
You've had two thousand dollar meds before thankfully they're not that much

2936
04:05:37,660 --> 04:05:41,100
Thankfully they're not that much like because like uh, my like my dad's diabetic

2937
04:05:41,660 --> 04:05:46,060
Just like genetics and stuff like not gonna lie to you when I hit a certain age

2938
04:05:46,140 --> 04:05:50,140
I'm probably gonna end up being diabetic because like at a certain age everybody's pancreas is just shut down

2939
04:05:51,100 --> 04:05:52,460
in our family

2940
04:05:52,460 --> 04:05:57,500
And um, like my dad had like ration like I've said this before like my dad had a ration as insulin before

2941
04:05:57,980 --> 04:05:59,580
Because it was so expensive

2942
04:05:59,580 --> 04:06:04,700
And then he also my aunt and my grandmother who also have it because the genetics and stuff he had to like

2943
04:06:05,260 --> 04:06:12,220
Give that like he would ration his insulin out to them because my dad usually orders in advance in cases of crisis because he's smart like that

2944
04:06:12,940 --> 04:06:14,940
But it's crazy

2945
04:06:15,900 --> 04:06:19,420
She's wrapped and she's at 17. I would have kept going until 20

2946
04:06:19,740 --> 04:06:25,500
I would have been like we're gonna do what we're gonna push but that's really all my that is insane

2947
04:06:26,220 --> 04:06:28,220
That is insane

2948
04:06:29,260 --> 04:06:34,140
Oh my god, like that's so crazy. I'm so freaking happy for her

2949
04:06:35,420 --> 04:06:37,420
That is wild

2950
04:06:39,980 --> 04:06:43,420
Oh my god massive azu w facts

2951
04:06:43,900 --> 04:06:48,940
I don't know why I'm saying facts so much because i'm tired dubs dubs all around right fia fia's asleep

2952
04:06:50,940 --> 04:06:54,860

A chat I go to this place and go to that place. I'm just like

2985
04:09:14,140 --> 04:09:16,300

04:09:26,460 --> 04:09:31,260
Yeah, literally get fun to get fun to get that's that's that's so true though

2991
04:09:31,740 --> 04:09:35,980
Because we want to be realistic. That's why I was like, oh, maybe like it should be smaller

2992
04:09:36,220 --> 04:09:38,380
But like how could you just do plans and a lot of stuff?

2993
04:09:39,420 --> 04:09:41,020

04:09:50,540 --> 04:09:53,980
Want to be more productive. She'll have some happiness. She'll have her own space

2998
04:09:53,980 --> 04:09:56,380
I guess you guys don't know how important it is to have your own space

2999
04:09:56,940 --> 04:10:02,300
Um, you might love your family, but it's still like great to have your own space. Uh, when you're when you're older

3000
04:10:03,260 --> 04:10:07,100
That's why I'm I'm glad I had moved out when I when I did because like I love my parents

3001
04:10:07,180 --> 04:10:10,140
But like I was about to like choke my mom out

3002
04:10:11,340 --> 04:10:15,180
In Minecraft that wasn't real. It's not like I meant like you guys know what I mean

3003
04:10:15,500 --> 04:10:22,460
But it's hard this is in this in this day and age. It's hard. It's very very difficult

3004
04:10:23,260 --> 04:10:25,260
um

3005
04:10:25,980 --> 04:10:30,700
Very very difficult but like I yeah, I wish I wish everybody the best when it comes to that

But yeah, it's it's so great

3107
04:17:08,940 --> 04:17:13,580
But yeah, if you ever need motivation, I'm here. I'm very good motivational speaker apparently

3108
04:17:14,940 --> 04:17:16,620
um

3109
04:17:16,620 --> 04:17:18,620
But yeah, it's it's just

3110
04:17:19,100 --> 04:17:22,620
It's nice. It's nice to be part of something big

3111
04:17:23,260 --> 04:17:26,700
And as we grow like I can't even wait to see what the rest of

3112
04:17:27,980 --> 04:17:29,100
You know

3113
04:17:29,100 --> 04:17:35,260
The year brings and the year like when like or i'm on gen two comes around like I feel like we're gonna get so much

3114
04:17:35,340 --> 04:17:37,900
Done and we're gonna accomplish so so many things

3115
04:17:39,020 --> 04:17:44,220
And it's just oh, I just can't wait. I generally can't wait to see

3116
04:17:44,540 --> 04:17:47,260
I can't wait to see the projects or the other girls that come up with

3117
04:17:47,500 --> 04:17:50,780
I can't wait to do the content that will make I can't wait for the collabs

3118
04:17:51,180 --> 04:17:53,180
I can't wait like it's it's so

3119
04:17:53,340 --> 04:17:56,860
It's so surreal to me. You know, it's not even been three months

3120
04:17:57,180 --> 04:17:58,700
It's not even been three months

3121
04:17:58,700 --> 04:18:02,860
Like every big like like any other company we've ever had our bumps in our rough patches

3122
04:18:02,860 --> 04:18:09,180
It's like these growing pains and learning how like we work with each other and how we work with our audience and how we work with other people

3123
04:18:10,140 --> 04:18:12,780
And like the type of content we make and like that's all fine and good

3124
04:18:12,780 --> 04:18:15,980
But like that and that's that's a part of it like that's a part of growth

3125
04:18:16,460 --> 04:18:21,740
Like as a company and so like i'm thankful for what we've been through like and that's not even been a lot like

3126
04:18:22,140 --> 04:18:28,380
I'm making it sound like we've had like bazillion major gaps. That's not even true not even remotely. Um, but it's like

3127
04:18:29,580 --> 04:18:33,580
Like of course like we've made a couple mistakes as anybody does but we we immediately

3128
04:18:33,820 --> 04:18:38,380
Realize those things and we immediately adapt and that one makes me happy and we're like, okay

3129
04:18:38,380 --> 04:18:41,580
This isn't working. Okay, we're gonna try something else like so it's

3130
04:18:42,540 --> 04:18:44,540
It's nice

3131
04:18:44,780 --> 04:18:50,380
As a shine man, i'm trying to express myself more. Oh, sweetheart. You got this. Don't worry about it

3132
04:18:50,940 --> 04:18:55,740
Can't wait for the slime girl slime girl gen four, baby slime girl gen four

3133
04:18:56,620 --> 04:19:00,060
You guys heard strani during the free she like I feel like she's doing

3134
04:19:00,940 --> 04:19:02,940
She's just like I hate slime girls

3135
04:19:03,820 --> 04:19:05,820
I'm like strani. No

3136
04:19:05,820 --> 04:19:08,620
Please please. I just want to slime

3137
04:19:09,660 --> 04:19:13,020
I just want a slime girl gen four. I'm

3138
04:19:14,460 --> 04:19:16,460
Does he know

3139
04:19:16,860 --> 04:19:23,980
Can't tell no, it's like I I remember in call. She's like, I'm so sick of hearing about slime girls. I'm like, I'm so sorry

3140
04:19:27,660 --> 04:19:29,660
Stop the slime girl. Hey

3141
04:19:30,540 --> 04:19:32,540
So

3142
04:19:34,140 --> 04:19:36,220
Can't believe we're talking about gen two this early, it's certainly me

3143
04:19:36,220 --> 04:19:41,740
But the thing is like but like like strani is a very amazing business woman and she's been having stuff in the

3144
04:19:42,220 --> 04:19:43,260
like

3145
04:19:43,260 --> 04:19:46,140
Waiting the wings for a while because she's already been working on stuff

3146
04:19:46,940 --> 04:19:48,460
um

3147
04:19:48,460 --> 04:19:51,980
So like in terms of like gen two development from what I know

3148
04:19:52,380 --> 04:19:57,420
um and then again, you guys have to understand like making models in like

3149
04:19:57,660 --> 04:20:02,300
Conceptualizing and art and like getting all that stuff done takes a very long time

3150
04:20:02,620 --> 04:20:09,020
So it's good that she's getting on it now to be honest with you. Um, she's great at planning ahead. Amazing actually. Um

3151
04:20:09,740 --> 04:20:13,500
Like she's helping me with she's helped helping me with my, um

3152
04:20:14,620 --> 04:20:17,740
Jonah don't don't fund stuff early so I can like get ahead on it

3153
04:20:19,020 --> 04:20:21,980
I have cat hair in my mouth. It's okay. I got it. Um

3154
04:20:23,580 --> 04:20:25,580
But like, um

3155
04:20:25,980 --> 04:20:30,140
Yeah, no, she's already she's trust me. She's already gotten stuff rolling

3156
04:20:30,300 --> 04:20:31,580
I don't even know

3157
04:20:31,580 --> 04:20:36,140
If she's like finished stuff some things at least like conceptualizing. I don't know any of that stuff

3158
04:20:36,140 --> 04:20:41,260
You guys have to ask her and you know, uh, strani will tell you like the reeflings anything

3159
04:20:41,740 --> 04:20:46,220
Because because we mean her the same with me. It's hard for us to keep a secret. Um,

3160
04:20:46,940 --> 04:20:49,180
I know on it. Yeah, I always I always look at strani

3161
04:20:49,180 --> 04:20:50,700
I'm like I neither grinds it

3162
04:20:50,700 --> 04:20:53,580
And like it me inspired me to like do those scripture shorts things

3163
04:20:53,580 --> 04:20:56,620
So I got that to go in like my my gen mates inspire me

3164
04:20:57,340 --> 04:20:59,100
um a lot

3165
04:20:59,100 --> 04:21:01,100
And they they guide me a lot

3166
04:21:01,740 --> 04:21:03,740
So I'm very thankful for them

3167
04:21:03,900 --> 04:21:06,940
But I don't know like cat is doing booby is like

3168
04:21:08,620 --> 04:21:09,820
Booby

3169
04:21:09,820 --> 04:21:11,820
What is happening? What are you on?

3170
04:21:13,580 --> 04:21:19,500
But he's like on top of something I can't even tell he's attacking a plant. That's all I'm gonna say. Um

3171
04:21:21,100 --> 04:21:23,100
Yeah, they reeflings got that insider knowledge

3172
04:21:27,020 --> 04:21:29,020
Imagine the back of a concept art

3173
04:21:31,100 --> 04:21:35,740
Oh my god, I told strani my strani. Please help. Well, please let me help you with the names. Please

3174
04:21:37,580 --> 04:21:47,260
Please please please please, um, I did give her some some suggestions, but I don't think she hasn't told me if any of them went through or anything. Um, but uh

3175
04:21:48,060 --> 04:21:56,620
Because I'm like, I can't be but like strani loves her alliteration. So I won't be surprised if like there's alliteration with some of the names

3176
04:21:58,620 --> 04:22:00,620
Just make names that are in new windows

3177
04:22:01,180 --> 04:22:04,700
Will you help them? No, I wanted to help. I did not help her with the names guys

3178
04:22:04,780 --> 04:22:09,580
I was hired and and assigned this model. I had nothing to do this conception of gen one

3179
04:22:10,460 --> 04:22:13,500
Um, I was literally just like a fan waiting like everybody else

3180
04:22:14,220 --> 04:22:17,500
And I applied and I didn't think I was gonna get it and I did hi here. I am

3181
04:22:18,220 --> 04:22:20,220

3182
04:22:20,860 --> 04:22:23,900
Watching your exposed. Yeah, that was funny

3183
04:22:25,580 --> 04:22:28,060

3187
04:22:46,620 --> 04:22:52,380
I'm not leaving anytime soon and I'm taught and I would I would if like, let's say veeler blew up

3188
04:22:52,700 --> 04:22:55,980

04:22:56,700 --> 04:22:59,660
three gens if it blew up and she's just like

04:24:17,420 --> 04:24:21,420
Because stop no guys stop it. I can see it now

3210
04:24:22,780 --> 04:24:24,780
All the all the news stuff

3211
04:24:25,740 --> 04:24:27,740
I was speaking of which uh

3212
04:24:28,140 --> 04:24:35,340
I told I told uh, you guys that I'm working on a project where I do I report because again, I was a commentator a report on news

3213
04:24:36,220 --> 04:24:38,220
um, I want to focus again

3214
04:24:39,180 --> 04:24:41,420
And this will be a project like in a couple months from now

3215
04:24:41,980 --> 04:24:43,740
Because I have to get a lot of stuff done

3216
04:24:43,900 --> 04:24:48,300
But I want to focus on like positive stuff and honestly just like saying what's going on

3217
04:24:48,620 --> 04:24:51,420
Like I know that might not sound interesting because I know like draw myself

3218
04:24:51,500 --> 04:24:54,380
But I'm like I I don't get a lot of information about like

3219
04:24:57,500 --> 04:24:59,340
And strontis helping me on a lot of stuff

3220
04:24:59,340 --> 04:25:01,900
I don't get a lot of information about like small corpo stuff

3221
04:25:01,980 --> 04:25:05,820
So because like uh, some some places don't really cover that anymore

3222
04:25:06,140 --> 04:25:11,020
So I want to like focus on like cool wins for small corpos and like individual stuff

3223
04:25:11,740 --> 04:25:18,220
Um, I don't want to be like drama-y like trust me. I was a commentator. I was drama-y before I know what that's like

3224
04:25:18,300 --> 04:25:22,620
I don't want I literally just want to be like this person like chio chompy

3225
04:25:23,260 --> 04:25:31,100
Just hit 10k subs from pixel link. Everyone congratulator right freaking now. Thank you. And that's the news. Good night. Like

3226
04:25:32,460 --> 04:25:33,900
um

3227
04:25:33,900 --> 04:25:38,540
I just like I want to uplift the community because I saw like what there is

3228
04:25:39,420 --> 04:25:43,580
A couple of tweets going around that people are like, oh my god, b2 being so negative and I'm like

3229
04:25:44,380 --> 04:25:47,180
I want to change that like I want to report on the good stuff

3230
04:25:47,180 --> 04:25:55,020
Like I want to report on the fun stuff like oh the vsmp server has this event. They just picked their candidates for

3231
04:25:57,100 --> 04:25:58,700
Something I don't know

3232
04:25:58,700 --> 04:26:02,380
About how it works. Um, but you guys know what I'm talking about. I don't know why I can't think of the word

3233
04:26:02,700 --> 04:26:06,140
I'm sorry the presidency. That's not how that works or like the mario card

3234
04:26:06,140 --> 04:26:08,380
Like I would want to report on those things like those those are fun

3235
04:26:08,460 --> 04:26:11,500
Those are awesome. Those are great community small corpo community events

3236
04:26:11,900 --> 04:26:17,340
Again, it would just be a focus on like small small corpo small corpo news

3237
04:26:17,980 --> 04:26:19,420
um

3238
04:26:19,420 --> 04:26:21,660
But yeah, happy news drama news

3239
04:26:21,660 --> 04:26:25,260
Yeah, more positivity because like I know I like I don't know about you guys

3240
04:26:25,340 --> 04:26:30,940
But like I loved watching the news with my mom and then they would talk about like a cat that like rescued like a kid or something

3241
04:26:32,380 --> 04:26:37,340
Like some like or like a dog that like got a medal and I'm like, yeah, let's do that

3242
04:26:37,900 --> 04:26:41,020
Let's focus on the good stuff instead of the bad stuff, you know

3243
04:26:41,660 --> 04:26:42,780
um

3244
04:26:42,780 --> 04:26:48,380
There's some channels like that. Yeah, exactly and because I have a bigger platform being an hdvtuber myself

3245
04:26:48,460 --> 04:26:50,460
I think that will help

3246
04:26:50,460 --> 04:26:51,580
uh

3247
04:26:51,580 --> 04:26:55,180
Because again, I might be like I'm not like huge but like I'm not like, um

3248
04:26:56,620 --> 04:27:02,300
Like I have like veeler offers me a branding and a presence so people would still like want to check stuff out just because

3249
04:27:03,020 --> 04:27:05,660
Um, but yeah spreading cheeks and spreading love

3250
04:27:06,060 --> 04:27:10,060
I I'm gonna have mercy sing the jingle and you like I need to get her to get on that

3251
04:27:10,940 --> 04:27:12,140
Because she came up with the thing

3252
04:27:12,140 --> 04:27:17,500
I hope I pinned it because she came up with like a a little jingle and I'm like, oh my god. I need to have mercy sing this

3253
04:27:18,060 --> 04:27:19,420

That's the goal. Yeah, like acapella magazine was great. Like you do you guys do a great job over there

No, I have a different name for it. I have a very like family friendly name for it because I'm it's going to literally be super family friendly

3258
04:27:37,340 --> 04:27:39,340
um

3259
04:27:39,500 --> 04:27:41,500
That'd be cool things trying. Yeah

3260
04:27:42,060 --> 04:27:44,060
news content. Yeah, no like I know

3261
04:27:45,180 --> 04:27:47,180
I again

3262
04:27:47,260 --> 04:27:51,500
I used to work for drama alert. I've said this before at least like I know what to do

3263
04:27:51,580 --> 04:27:54,540
I know what to look for. I know how to report news

3264
04:27:55,100 --> 04:27:57,180
So, yeah, she's about to kind of jingle

3265
04:27:58,140 --> 04:27:59,900
I figure how she said it

3266
04:27:59,900 --> 04:28:02,940
But she's saying she just like really made up something on the spot and it was adorable

3267
04:28:03,340 --> 04:28:07,580
I'm like, actually I might have to have you sing that for real and get it like

3268
04:28:08,300 --> 04:28:10,300
mixed and whatever

3269
04:28:11,020 --> 04:28:16,700
Family friendly with the shibs. Exactly. Holy shib folks. I like I'll just say stuff like that

3270
04:28:17,660 --> 04:28:20,780

3276
04:28:41,660 --> 04:28:44,620
Sadly it won't be uh indie related

3277
04:28:44,620 --> 04:28:51,340
It'll be small just to keep like my sanity in terms of not like indie is bad, but because there's so many indie

3278
04:28:52,220 --> 04:28:57,340
Vtubers, I think I just want to focus on one side and I'm not going to do like larger and see like

3279
04:28:57,820 --> 04:29:00,380
I'm not going to do like haul live or needy stuff. Um

3280

Need to buy a news anchor mustache. Oh

3287
04:29:24,460 --> 04:29:28,940

3288
04:29:30,140 --> 04:29:32,140

3289
04:29:32,860 --> 04:29:37,020

3291
04:29:44,300 --> 04:29:46,300
Just finish the set the

3292
04:29:46,540 --> 04:29:48,540
Finish the level

3293
04:29:49,740 --> 04:29:51,740
Anchorman was great

3294
04:29:53,180 --> 04:29:58,300
Talk a lot if I use liver like liver celebrity gossip a bit far from oh my god

3295
04:29:59,580 --> 04:30:07,180
I said I was telling manager. I'm like I need an animation of me like running around trying to interview like inanimate objects or something

3296
04:30:07,820 --> 04:30:12,540
That's a microphone. Like I need like some ridiculous animation. He's just like

3297
04:30:13,900 --> 04:30:15,900

3298
04:30:17,260 --> 04:30:19,260
I

3299
04:30:19,580 --> 04:30:22,460
Just feel you're gonna get another flip. No, she'll get flipped. Um

3300
04:30:23,100 --> 04:30:28,220
When I bring her because I'll see I I moved now that she's like eating normally and doing a lot better

3301
04:30:28,300 --> 04:30:31,580
I'm now sleeping in my bed and not outside because I slept near the couch

3302
04:30:31,660 --> 04:30:35,340
So I could bring her to the bathroom and like have access to everything a lot faster

3303
04:30:35,820 --> 04:30:37,020
and um

3304
04:30:37,020 --> 04:30:40,780
So this time like I've been bringing her to the bedroom and I made like a little like

3305
04:30:41,020 --> 04:30:43,820
Area for her on my bed that she can sleep and stretch out on

3306
04:30:44,380 --> 04:30:50,540
And so I'll I'll flip her for then. I have to flip my baby like a pancake. Um, if you're new here my cat fia as you can see

3307
04:30:50,860 --> 04:30:53,260
Uh, she's hanging out. Um, she is, uh

3308
04:30:54,140 --> 04:30:56,140
temporarily disabled

3309
04:30:56,700 --> 04:31:02,940
Such a weird way to say that but she has a rare autoimmune disease that makes her body shut down in terms of like moving around and stuff

3310
04:31:03,180 --> 04:31:07,180
But don't worry. She's on meds and she's doing a lot better and she can um move a little bit

3311
04:31:07,180 --> 04:31:09,020
But she can't stand or walk or hold her stuff up

3312
04:31:09,340 --> 04:31:11,820
But she's doing fine. Have a good night. Bye

3313
04:31:13,340 --> 04:31:17,580

3315
04:31:26,780 --> 04:31:35,340
Um, let's see. I've been up for a little bit. I'm slipping away very very fast. So let me let me raid somebody

3316

Started an hour ago question mark hour and a half

3327
04:32:26,780 --> 04:32:29,660
