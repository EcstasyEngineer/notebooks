I was debating whether or not to get a psychology degree so I could be a therapist specifically for youtubers

Because it's a it's definitely a niche that that needs to be filled

14:10.040 --> 14:12.360

Yeah, and I can't really handle change that well, but I'm like I've been fine. I've been so busy

14:32.440 --> 14:34.440
I haven't even had time to be anxious about

14:35.560 --> 14:37.800
Not having like a normal job

14:37.960 --> 14:45.160

15:15.960 --> 15:17.960

15:18.440 --> 15:20.440
And then she said

15:22.280 --> 15:26.120
Wait, uh, but my therapist is cool. She doesn't really uh

15:26.680 --> 15:28.680
He doesn't like press me to pay or anything

15:28.680 --> 15:32.280
But she's like wait, you don't have insurance anymore. Do you and I'm like well technically

15:32.440 --> 15:37.800
I won't have insurance for like after three so I figured out I like I have insurance for like three months after I leave

15:38.360 --> 15:40.200
and she's like

15:40.200 --> 15:44.840
Uh, so she's like you should have them pay for your therapy because of all the stuff

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
That they make you do for them

15:48.040 --> 15:49.400

Bourbon

17:52.040 --> 17:55.880
My mom's is gardening my parents are very typical parents

17:56.760 --> 18:01.640
My mom really likes flowers and birds and my dad likes bourbon and star wars

18:03.960 --> 18:07.880
Yeah, it's not easy to get your hand out. Yeah. Yeah, I also I don't know alcohol at all

18:07.880 --> 18:11.160
I'm just like I'll give me the fruitiest drink and I will have it

18:13.000 --> 18:16.680
My model is stuff. Yeah, my model's stuck because I'm looking at when my dad texted me

18:19.560 --> 18:23.320
The Venn diagram of bourbon drinkers and youtuber fans is two separate circles

18:23.880 --> 18:25.880
I didn't know there's like bourbon

18:26.520 --> 18:31.640
Streamers he was my dad was telling me he watched like bourbon streamers on twitch. It's so funny. My dad's cooler than me

18:31.720 --> 18:33.720
I already know that

18:34.040 --> 18:36.040
I'll speak in which I need to schedule

18:36.760 --> 18:41.800
I want to do a street not a stream uh record. Maybe I'll do that when I'm gone

18:42.680 --> 18:43.960
Yes

18:43.960 --> 18:51.160
So what I'm so some of you who don't know. Hello. Hi. Um, I'm going to be gone for a week from the 18th to the 23rd

18:51.720 --> 18:55.240
I'm going to go see my grandparents, but I wanted to go

18:55.640 --> 18:59.240
Um, I wanted to record something in my absence

18:59.560 --> 19:05.400
So I'm doing an ASMR and I was thinking if I was going to do a gameplay video, but now I'm I think I'm going to

19:05.960 --> 19:09.080
Um, yeah, so week. I'm sorry. Um

19:09.960 --> 19:12.760
I'm gonna do the video with my parents

19:13.640 --> 19:20.280
And I'm gonna have them name v-tubers based off of their designs. So I'll probably grab like, uh,

19:20.920 --> 19:26.520
Like obviously the v alert girls. I'll grab like, um, the people I've collabed with like

19:27.080 --> 19:34.840
Mythos and like you may plus and then I'll grab like some like really popular indies just like iron mouse

19:35.320 --> 19:36.520
um

19:36.600 --> 19:42.680
And stuff and then some like haul alive girls obviously like chiara and nervisa and like some of the newer gen

19:43.960 --> 19:46.280
So I and then see how my parents named them

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I think my dad will just be like

19:49.560 --> 19:52.120
I think both of my parents will just be like they have giant boobs

19:53.720 --> 19:56.920
And this be so hung up on their outfits that they won't even

19:57.800 --> 20:03.480
And I'm kind of nervous because I have to tell my my mom can be like my mom's very into fashion and so is my dad

20:03.480 --> 20:07.640
But mostly my mom and she will like my mom again is very conservative

20:07.720 --> 20:09.720
So she'll be like wow, she has her whole entire

20:10.360 --> 20:16.280
Tire boobies out in her, you know, but does he whoa? Okay. This is this is what you do redacted

20:16.360 --> 20:18.360
This is what you do. She me with your spare time

20:20.440 --> 20:25.640
So I think it would be I just don't want my parents to roast people because they might roast people and I'm nervous

20:26.440 --> 20:28.440
I might have to do disclaimer

20:29.400 --> 20:31.400
Um, but yeah, maybe I'll do that

20:32.120 --> 20:35.240
Or we'll set up a donkas. I think I'll do that

20:36.360 --> 20:37.720
Um

20:37.720 --> 20:41.400
Instead of because I was trying to think of like, okay, what's a gameplay video that I can do

20:42.040 --> 20:44.040
I can't think of anything so

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
We're just gonna

20:47.640 --> 20:49.640
Yeah

20:50.200 --> 20:53.640
Feel like your mom would y'all at mercy given her vtuber lore

20:54.360 --> 21:00.600
I'm not gonna make them look at the lore videos. I'm just be like, what is this outfit? Tell me what you think of it

21:01.720 --> 21:06.920
I think my mom will really like straw knees outfit though and like theme. I think she'll think she's cute

21:07.800 --> 21:13.240
And I think she'll like I I think I see will be my mom's favorite. I think mercy will be my dad's favorite

21:15.480 --> 21:17.800
Father she be bourbon donathan one

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
maybe maybe I'll add that to like

21:20.840 --> 21:24.760
My my donathan goals get my dad this particular bourbon

21:27.640 --> 21:30.520
She means mom with the other girls now. Listen here young lady

21:32.760 --> 21:36.360
I don't think my parents would like cute funny characters

21:41.400 --> 21:45.720
Uh, at least go in a bit my sissac blumser model was like what is she naked?

21:46.440 --> 21:48.440
I

21:49.000 --> 21:56.440

Mocky rolls be mad tasty. Yeah

33:31.240 --> 33:35.320
I don't know if I should have sushi though because my as you guys know my tummy's been really upset lately

33:35.320 --> 33:37.320
So it's been hard for me to have food

33:38.440 --> 33:40.440

34:22.520 --> 34:24.520
I'm happy

34:26.840 --> 34:32.280
No, sometimes, um, I think ever since I start I could tell you what meds I'm on. I don't I don't really care

34:32.600 --> 34:38.680
Um, so I started some for my skin because my skin has been breaking out real bad. I think because of the um

34:39.240 --> 34:44.200
The heat and stuff and I don't know if I'm having I don't know if I'm having reaction to something

34:44.280 --> 34:50.040
If I'm like allergic to something and it's making me break out. I don't know. Um, but so I'm on

34:51.400 --> 34:56.040
Uh, it's an antibiotic to help with um that and it's doxicillin

34:56.520 --> 35:01.240
But doxicillin makes you very have really gives you really bad. Um

35:02.760 --> 35:05.480
What's it called acid reflux and then

35:06.200 --> 35:12.760
Spiral lactone which is supposed to help with the hormone. I don't want to pronounce it with the hormonal aspect of acne

35:13.160 --> 35:19.240
Can also make you really nauseous. So that's why eczema gain rise up. Um, I don't have eczema

35:20.680 --> 35:27.080
Doxicillin doxicycline. I think I don't know doxicycline. Are you taking our food? Uh

35:28.280 --> 35:32.520

Spiral love do people take that?

35:38.680 --> 35:40.680
That are transitioning. I didn't know that

35:42.440 --> 35:44.440
The med's gonna dox me

35:45.800 --> 35:47.560
Um

35:47.560 --> 35:52.600
But yeah, so I take that to like because sometimes because women's hormones are always like all over the place

35:52.600 --> 35:57.800
Especially because our hormonal cycles are a month are a month long. So my doctors is like

35:58.360 --> 36:02.040

She's like, because you shouldn't be breaking on like you, right?

36:18.120 --> 36:20.120

40:30.760 --> 40:32.760
You're stalker. Just following me

40:35.080 --> 40:41.320
Um takes long for canned soup to go bad. Maybe it because it says 25. So I'm assuming it's 2025

40:47.080 --> 40:50.520
Can the microwave on Thomas what is next season say it close on over the floor

40:51.320 --> 40:56.440

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000

41:01.800 --> 41:07.480
You let your cats on the countertop, um, so funny none of my cats before boomie and fia

41:08.360 --> 41:10.360
were ever on the countertop

41:10.360 --> 41:15.560
But boomie is a menace to society and even taught reina to get up on the counter

41:15.880 --> 41:17.880
So now reina thinks you can get up on the counter

41:18.520 --> 41:23.400
But boomie and fia go up in the counter and I tried I tried for so long. I did the tin foil

41:23.480 --> 41:26.760

43:07.080 --> 43:09.080
You know what you did

43:09.960 --> 43:11.960
Why are you such a dork?

43:14.200 --> 43:19.480
You look so proud of yourself that you were able to get some of my soup. I'm very upset with you

43:20.360 --> 43:22.360
Um where I need a bowl

44:10.440 --> 44:13.160
No, you guys aren't like boomy you guys actually

44:13.800 --> 44:20.600
Provide for me and take care of me and are sweet and give me compliments. Well boomy just fucking eats my food

44:21.480 --> 44:27.720
And also tries to kill himself so often by doing stupid stuff like hot jumping on a hot stove

44:28.520 --> 44:34.520
He's really grooming himself. He's just sitting all cutely on the floor just like oh, that was a delicious meal

44:39.800 --> 44:41.800
Our cats are fricks. No

44:42.360 --> 44:45.720
No, that's rude. Don't say that. I love my cats

44:46.200 --> 44:53.000
Boomy is just a menace sometimes, but he is my son. He's going through his terrible twos except he's a year old

44:56.840 --> 44:59.400
Did you get something in your eye your eye is very winky

45:02.920 --> 45:04.920
I'm so mad

45:06.840 --> 45:10.200
I turn around this motherfucker is on my counter

45:11.000 --> 45:13.640
Sticking his head in the pot of soup just eating it

45:16.680 --> 45:21.960
Fia will do that too Fia has stolen a chicken nugget from me before boomy's stolen fries for me

45:22.040 --> 45:26.520
They like they like fries a lot. I don't know boomy has stolen my chips

45:27.960 --> 45:30.520
I'll be like eating. No, what was I I was eating like

45:31.480 --> 45:35.160
Like, you know, there's like nacho fries from Taco Bell like a couple months ago

45:35.160 --> 45:39.080
I was eating those and I'm like sitting on my living room floor just like watching tv

45:39.160 --> 45:44.200
So I don't like spill anything anywhere and if I can if I do I can just like clean it up instead of on my couch

45:45.080 --> 45:53.160
And I'm about to stick a fry in my mouth and boomy sticks his paw into on my hand and brings it towards him and then takes a bite

45:55.240 --> 45:58.600
I'm just I'm literally just with my hand in the air frozen

46:01.320 --> 46:04.840
So shocked that my son just took a bite of my fry

46:07.000 --> 46:11.560
And grabbed my paw to deuce my paw used his paw to grab my hand to do so

46:12.520 --> 46:17.560
Madam, can we have a streamer audio when you discipline a cat boy for behaving like boomy?

46:18.680 --> 46:20.680
Maybe

46:20.760 --> 46:22.760
It'll just be a bunch of just like

46:23.080 --> 46:26.760
Get off the counter get down and me just shaking a water bottle

46:27.960 --> 46:29.960
He's testing it for poison

46:31.080 --> 46:33.080
No, see I throw hands on my cats and they did that

46:34.120 --> 46:37.400
See, yeah, I'm throwing I'm about to throw paws boomy. Let's fight

46:37.960 --> 46:41.800
Oh, I'm coming for you. You just head butted me

46:44.360 --> 46:46.520
No, stop stop seducing me

46:49.480 --> 46:51.480
Here have a toy

46:51.560 --> 46:55.080
I even gave you treats this morning. Do you think you can steal my food?

46:59.640 --> 47:01.640
Where's your sister

47:07.400 --> 47:09.400
Oh

47:17.880 --> 47:25.080
He ever really likes the cat tree that you guys got likes to lay in that factory often

47:30.360 --> 47:34.680
Gotta cook off boomy spit you're disgusting

47:37.560 --> 47:39.560
Oh

47:41.000 --> 47:46.440
Yeah, he's very cute. He's very nice when he does it too. He doesn't like use his claws or anything. He like boomy boomy

47:49.240 --> 47:53.640
Likes to stretch a whole line of turn around because I thought he hopped up on the fucking counter again

47:53.880 --> 47:55.880
he likes to stretch up and like, um

47:57.160 --> 47:59.720
Against your leg and reach up at you and be like hi

48:00.440 --> 48:01.800
and

48:01.800 --> 48:07.400
He knows the difference between like if my skin is exposed if I'm wearing like shorts or if I'm wearing pants

48:07.720 --> 48:12.120
Because when he when I'm wearing pants he uses his claws because he thinks it won't hurt me

48:12.520 --> 48:18.040
But then recently I've told him that it hurts and so now he stops using his claws when he asks for uppies. Yeah

48:20.520 --> 48:22.520
Yeah, but we ask for uppies a lot

48:23.960 --> 48:26.920
And then because then he'll he also just like soft paw

48:27.640 --> 48:28.600
um

48:28.600 --> 48:29.960
soft paw it

48:29.960 --> 48:33.560
He never would do that when I was wearing shorts non-verbal boy

48:37.160 --> 48:39.160
He's not a monster

48:39.560 --> 48:41.560
But just a simple menace

48:43.160 --> 48:48.600
I wish my cats would stop using their claws on my bed sheets. Yeah, um, fia likes to do that

48:51.400 --> 48:54.600
My cat hates me just bites me. Oh, I'm sorry

48:55.400 --> 48:56.600
I

48:56.600 --> 48:59.800
Like make my cats don't don't bite me unless like

49:00.520 --> 49:03.560
Uh, they miss when we're playing and they accidentally like

49:04.840 --> 49:08.280
Although boomie used to like bite me a lot as a kitten, but that's because he's a kitten

49:09.240 --> 49:12.680
boomie's still a kitten. Yeah, you know, I'm talking about you

49:13.640 --> 49:15.640
He's like right behind me. Hi

49:15.720 --> 49:19.240
What do you love to you think about ways to take my soup again?

49:20.200 --> 49:25.880
Oh, you're just you're scratching my carpet. It's not a scratching board, but it's fun

49:27.160 --> 49:29.160
I need to clip your claws

49:31.560 --> 49:33.800
They're very sharp I haven't clicked on them in a month

49:35.560 --> 49:37.560
Fia destroy a bad companion

49:39.080 --> 49:41.400
Okay, this is for I don't hate cats but low key fear of them

49:41.400 --> 49:45.000
So if a cat approaches me I'm likely to look at the owner like what is it doing? What is it?

49:45.400 --> 49:48.920
It's their action mean. Uh, yeah cats body language is a lot

49:50.040 --> 49:52.040
Harder to read than a dogs

49:53.000 --> 49:57.240
Um, really you can tell how a cat is feeling by looking at how their tail is

49:57.800 --> 49:59.800
similar to a dog, um

50:00.360 --> 50:05.320
But like if their tail is up like a little flag that means they're like happy to see you if it's like kind of like

50:06.120 --> 50:10.120
A little like medium that's like they're content if it's a little bit lower. They're just like chilling

50:10.600 --> 50:13.480
But if it's like tucked almost like a dog and they're like very frightened

50:15.960 --> 50:17.960
Are you biting my carpet?

50:19.480 --> 50:26.360
I gave you a spring. Did you knock it under the freaking couch bro? Oh my god, there's like 50 spring like toy springs under my couch

50:27.960 --> 50:30.600
Um, yeah, I tell a lot of gonna cat means irritation

50:31.400 --> 50:33.400
They hate being stared at

50:34.680 --> 50:39.320
I don't know I stare at my cats they they just like just chirp at me when I do

50:40.520 --> 50:43.480
Because they like to stare at me because cats like to stare at you

50:43.560 --> 50:47.080
They're not like dogs where they're like scared of eye contact and stuff. They just like to watch you

50:47.960 --> 50:54.600
Cats wink. Yeah, they give you a little I call it little kitty kisses. I'm like, oh, did you just give me a kiss when they like slowly blink at you?

50:55.720 --> 50:57.720
um

50:58.040 --> 51:02.760
Yeah, they don't like yeah, you don't want to pet a cat if it shows you your spelly because for a cat and they roll over

51:03.320 --> 51:05.320
Onto there. Why am I peeking?

51:06.040 --> 51:08.040
What the hell

51:08.520 --> 51:10.520
Bro, I'm getting pissed

51:11.320 --> 51:13.320
At my microphone right now

51:13.480 --> 51:15.480
I

51:16.360 --> 51:18.360
Because that means they have all their weapons on display

51:25.480 --> 51:28.920
That's so weird, why is my microphone doing that? I'm sorry. I'm just watching the levels

51:34.760 --> 51:40.600
Start staring without blinking is an aggression thing for cats blinking is fine, but for long eye contact is so you get yeah, it's like a

51:41.560 --> 51:43.560
Like dogs where they're like challenging

51:44.200 --> 51:46.200
Boomi, what are you doing?

51:46.360 --> 51:48.920
Now he's under my desk. Hi big man

51:50.440 --> 51:52.440
um

51:58.360 --> 52:01.080
Hello, what are you up to please don't

Do not pop off here or I swear to god you're gonna accidentally hurt yourself. Oh my gosh

52:32.040 --> 52:40.440
He's looking at my soup like I'm about to feed him some food. He's like, oh

52:44.520 --> 52:46.520
I dropped my oyster crackers

52:54.360 --> 52:56.360
Can't

52:57.080 --> 53:04.840
You want a cracker? Yeah, see it's not interesting to you like why are you trying to like get all excited over that?

53:17.880 --> 53:23.000
Okay, I don't have any ginger ale but I do have um seltzer water

53:27.320 --> 53:29.320
I don't have to drink soda too much

53:32.760 --> 53:37.560
One of my cats like belly touches the other does oh, yeah, feel loves her belly rubs. She loves it

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000

And my taser's just on my desk

54:01.320 --> 54:03.320
Put that over here

54:07.160 --> 54:09.160
Do I have a single cat mother?

54:13.240 --> 54:15.240
Why are you shouting?

54:15.640 --> 54:19.960
Hot soup is hot. She discovers the worst. Shut up. It's got taste

54:22.840 --> 54:28.120
Be like a hood rabbit catches you and tases you

54:31.000 --> 54:33.800
Because she thinks you stole her something or whatever

54:35.800 --> 54:38.120
She's just scared the fuck out of you during the collab

54:44.920 --> 54:48.120
Is it taser or taser it's with an s but good question

54:52.840 --> 54:57.880
I'm waiting for my soup to cool, but I'm sad. I put in my little oyster crackers because now they're gonna get soggy

55:01.080 --> 55:03.080
No lasers with an s

55:04.840 --> 55:07.480
ASMR you still should be soup, but you are not a cat

55:10.760 --> 55:13.960
A hood rabbit chases you down and tases you because she thinks you're cute. There you go

55:17.640 --> 55:19.640
Because we um

59:41.400 --> 59:43.800
Can't tell if the soup tastes okay or not it's fine

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.520

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.800
Because I turned around and he was eating the soup from the pot when I was sitting at my desk

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.800
I

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.040

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.720
Snow bunnies

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.600
If you're a fan of me and I see your snow bunny

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.360
Yeah, what can I?

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.600
Balhash

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.520
No, not baklava

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.600
I hope you had a good stream. I saw that in me in me. I see was playing brats

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:56.280
This is what happens when you give everybody the first letter of the name and then the last letter of the name the exactly same

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:15.000
Sipping sipping on my my seltzer water my ginger lime a seltzer water

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.280
and um

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.080
Yeah, straw knee she be I see in me. Yeah, I know other people do that. Like I've been called straw knee before

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.360
um

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.360
Yeah, guys you're playing brats

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.960
brats

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:37.560
I remember I used to have like a little mini disc of like the brats angels that came with one of my brats dolls when I had a

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.520
brats doll

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520
I think I had chloe and um

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.760
There's brats angels or brats forever. I can't remember rock angels. Yeah

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.360
I'm her listening to the song. I have to burp. I need to mute

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.800
Hi bleep my so wait, no

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.400
It'll work. I don't know if it worked

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120
Oh my crap, did I like not bleep it?

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.840
Yeah, you get you get bleeped burps. Nobody deserves my burps

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:14.760
The bleep was bleeping she's such a criminal

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.040
When I was in the third grade they called me a criminal why because I killed somebody

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:34.840
Start rating bleeps I could do morse code not that I know morse code, but I could figure it out

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.240
I

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.800
Choked on a noodle

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:56.120
I can see that behind a fit area. What do you mean? Of course mercy. She's literally the Andre

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.720
Did I burp I don't remember burping if I did I'm sorry

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840
I

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:16.680
Nice belts bro anytime bro, huh bro fist, but I just like to shove my fist up your butt

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.080
affectionately

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.480
Yeah, but the undead I already had three what

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.920
On an arena stream became a lunch ASMR. I've already told you guys I like to eat with you guys

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.440
One because you guys encourage me to eat and I don't like eating alone

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.040
See without you I wouldn't have remembered that I have chicken noodle soup Campbell's chicken noodle soup in my cabinet

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.240
And I would have probably just kept eating applesauce

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.160
Thanks for the fist bro anytime bro

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.240
That's literally called a mukbang that's true

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:05.560
Mukbang except I'm not like shoving like an absurd amount of cheese down my throat. I'm just eating Campbell's chicken noodle soup

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:15.560
Yeah, then you wouldn't have the lovely clip that someone probably took of boomi taking my soup

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.760
I don't know what the cheese is but well, there's a lot of like cheese pulls and stuff and mukbangs

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.400
I couldn't watch mukbangs because then I would want to eat what the people were eating

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
But like obviously on a smaller scale

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.160
So like anytime I watch like a sushi or like a fish related mukbang

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.240
I would have to get like sushi

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.640
And I'm like this is hurting my wallet

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.040
Campbell's sponsor stream

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:58.360
If I could get any sponsor, you know, I'm who my dream sponsor is guess who I want you to guess who my dream sponsor is right now

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:11.480
Let me switch to a gaming

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.480
Tampax

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:39.560
Why are people saying tampa why'd you say it twice you get that'd be pretty cool. Um, no

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.520
It's smuckers uncrustables

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.280
That is my dream

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Strawny is my dream sponsor that too

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.760
If I could get smuckers uncrustables

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.480
Then that would be incredible. I don't know why there's not game sound

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.040
Let me figure that out expeditiously and put my headphones in

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.760
I want to make a PB and J because it's the novelty bro. It's the novelty

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.720
Okay

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:22.120
Imagine me on an uncrustable and I'm just like just hanging out, you know, let me put my ooo mouth on

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.720
Why can I only hear

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.960
Everything besides the game

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.400
Da da da da da da

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.080
Um Elden ring where for oh

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.160
Is that it? Yeah

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.160
Yeah

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.080
Okay, I can hear it but now you guys can't

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.480
Unless you guys can hear it. I don't know if you can

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:11.880
Devoured okay, cool. Um properties

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.760
Is

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.800
Nope

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.440
It will probably randomly be under music because I don't know why but it puts

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.480
Game audio under music on my go xlr. I should probably fix that

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.480
Come on play again

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:42.760
Hold on hold on. Hold on. I've got this. I like how I do one thing in it. Why is my mic peaking?

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.160
What happened? What happened to my settings from my last collab?

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.040
Oh

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.920
You heard your first second

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:20.920
Oh, there it is. I might turn that motherfucker down. Holy crap. Sorry

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.920
Sorry that game audio is gone now for a second because I need to do something in

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.200
YouTube studio. So I'm not so bright

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:42.520
Um, what the shibbity? Where is it? Here it is

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.040
There it is

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.760
I should have taken a picture of my go xlr settings before they got yuffed up

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.000
Cause that's poopy. That's real poopy. That's what I'm gonna say

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.800
Is that better? Sure. Okay

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.120
Uh

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.080
Oh scared me

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.480
I'm a star

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:49.000
I guess we actually have to play a game. I'm still sipping. I'm still sipping my poop. Hello. Hi. We started early today

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.040
Oh, they don't like about camel chicken noodle soup is that it's so salty

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.320
It's too salty for me. How am I supposed to swallow this?

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.600
Mmm

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:26.760
You'll show me what? What do you mean? I didn't say anything bad

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.120
I

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.360
Water it down. Yeah, I think I've done that before

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.000
I see

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.360
Don't ice cube in there. Well, it's it's already gone. I actually finished it

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.360
Which I'm surprised because again, like I said, I've been like very nauseous because of my bed, so

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.640
Don't worry, you'll probably fall asleep and I'll be streaming eight hours from now. So

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.120
Don't worry about it. You won't miss anything

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Crack my back

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.720
Time to stretch

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.680
Oh

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.360
I'm so close to popping it and I can't

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960
Just works

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.160
She'll be having eight hours from now after playing the game for three hours

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.240
Shit, but my favorite underground indie artist

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:40.520
You best you bested mogul last night. He's the first boss to give you a hard time cool

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.720
So you're gonna help me defeat him, right?

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.080
Just kidding. I'll I'll fight him

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.360
What did you guys say you guys wanted me to fight morgot too and uh

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.200
God-free

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.200
Okay

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:10.680
Cozy I'm here. I'm ready to rumble. I got my pillow pet mr. Quackerton as my little armrest

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.440
Need to adjust I need to bleep

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.840
I

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.440
Forgot and I can just be you I don't have to bleep it

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.840
No burpees for you

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.920
Yeah, god-free another talisman pouch

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.160
Uh, I also probably should get some memory stones for spells

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.640
Because I was doing a lot of oh my god. I need to turn out the game for me

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.240
That didn't work at all

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.680
There we go turns it down for me and not for you that actually works out. Um

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:04.040
Are you changing our normal burps because I feel I feel like I've been giving you guys too much

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440
And it's time for me to withhold things

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.640
You didn't you didn't do anything. I just want to torture you so no burps for you. Um

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.200
Um, what was I gonna say?

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.720
Oh, so I was doing some research on like best

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:31.320
Things to do. I really watched an hour video about the top 75 best sorceries

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:39.720
And I'm like, okay, do I run around and grab those and I'm like, I don't think I will. Um, but

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.080
Going in to I like to do research. Okay for Elden Ring. It's fun

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.240
I like to listen to Elden Ring stuff. Um

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.880
Going into a mug is going to be difficult

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.440
One because my build he's pretty resistant to

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.560
So

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:05.880
Yeah, that'll be something unless I get like, uh the comment

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.600
I could probably get that

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.400
um

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.800
Maybe mugged mowed

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.480
Uh could also maybe get some frost stuff

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.080
I wish I had the video up because it has like a lot of good information about

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.000
um

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
The scaling and stuff for

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.720
the sorceries

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.720
erm

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.720
Let me see

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.360
I have to get a different weapon besides the moon veil

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.520
to fight

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.320
Mogue with because he is resistant to magic

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.240
I think like a little bit, but he's I think I'm gonna get

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.280
the

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:55.880
Either the the no the either the uji katana or the naga kaiba nakiba naga kiba

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.760
I can't remember the name and then do get a poison ash of war for that

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.800
um

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:10.280
Because I don't feel like although, I don't know. Do I need higher dexterity for that? I probably do

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.360
Brick yeah, he is weak to bleed however

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:27.960
He is he is like 20 magic resisted. I watched a video leave me alone

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.800
um

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.080
He's like resistant to everything

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.640
Yes, he's heavily fit obviously like he is fire resistant, but for best

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.960
Build

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960
Yeah, he's 80 percent fire percent

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.960
20% oh, okay. I thought it was 40 percent. I can't remember whatever. All right, then we should be fine then with the moon veil

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.040
So I don't have to do that

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.040
uh, we still have to

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.600
go

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
and

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.640
Go to the sofra

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:12.520
I can't pronounce it correct me because I would like to know. I know it's like irish. Um

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.760
River well to get the mimic tear

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.240
So like oh, I guess so much enough to do

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.480
You

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.080
Um, then I have to go

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.360
Get more got I don't remember why

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.840
I have to level the mimic tear. That's also true

It's like if I hide behind a rock, it's fine

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.400
Although it immediately will pop up immediately when I get closer

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:18.440

Okay

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.920

Three third time's a charm. Am I right am I right? I'm just gonna go this way

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.880
So you don't get hit by rocks

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.600

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.640
Uh, I don't know they seem to not aggro until I come a lot closer

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.240
I'm coming closer

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.640
They have not found me yet

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.640

The eye of sauron watches over us all

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.480
I

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.920
Coolio

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.320

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:39.080
It was not I like how although I'm right under it. It doesn't affect me it always confused me

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.240
What's your foolish ambitions to rest

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.400

I saw them fall off and I was like, where are they going? No

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.600
It's pretty not smart to have like a statue in the middle of a road

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:15.360

02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:20.240

kind of weird, why is it doing that, what,

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:44.320
I got to walk in,

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:55.200
this is OP against NPCs, I know I keep forgetting to use my ash of war on this,

02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:01.360

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:05.760

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:52.160
why,

02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:02.160
you're so, you're do so good, why are you lying to me, why are you lying to me, don't lie to me,

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.680
stop,

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:20.560
no I just want to, I already got the grace I needed, but you already got the grace,

02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:28.720
you're too, you're, you're late bro, you're late, I already got the grace, I just want to try to kill him,

02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:35.040
it's like my, my lock is just like not working,

02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:41.440
can you, enough,

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:52.720
she blinded me with madness, she blinded me with madness, I'm too underleveled for that,

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:56.400
he just walks away, he's like yeah, bye bitch,

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:03.680
you just get cooked a little bit, we can get it back,

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:08.720
okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, okay, so we got what we needed there,

02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:12.160
what was the other, I was looking for the secret,

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:27.040
he made a secret and left, okay, the restaurant, there's a church of the plague in Kailu that has it,

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:36.000
and there's someone the Altus Plateau, but I won't really do that yet, because Altus

02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:42.000
Plateau is not really my priority right now, where the fuck is this,

02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:52.560
it's like right in a crooked road, no I'm not fucking, hit, here,

02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.680
making my way downtown,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.360
like I'm looking at a puzzle piece, where is this, is it right over here,

02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:13.840
walking fast, faces passing homebound,

02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:20.000
that probably was not the best grace to go to, what are we working towards again,

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.040
I'm getting all the sacred tears, not all of them, just like a good chunk,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.520
I should probably look for some golden seeds while I'm at it, I should probably do that too,

02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:36.800
I have so many fucking tags, let me back up, so that one's three,

02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:42.160
I wish there was a way to just clear all my beacons,

02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:48.320
is that a thing, is there a toggle to do that, I highly doubt it, get rid of you,

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:54.080
no, I just wanted to, thank you,

02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:00.720
no not those kind of tags, you fucking idiots,

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.640
all right, where's one, where's this one pointing at, one is,

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.280
what the hell,

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:17.040
there's a one, what is one,

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:21.680
sorry I like have to fix that because it's gonna bother me, so I usually follow the track,

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:26.080
till I find it,

02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.400
where the fuck is one,

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:43.200
how do I remove all, I'm gonna keep yelling at you unless you tell me,

02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.760
oh there it is, I found it,

02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:57.360
I want some ice cream, I would love some ice cream actually, I have an ice cream in like a very long

02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:13.120
time, great, time to figure out how to get the fuck down up, you know what, are you serious,

02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:25.760
that's so fucking stupid in it,

02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:30.720
anyways,

02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:38.480
you're telling me that that hurts me, that is the dumbest shit I've ever seen,

02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:56.320
oh yeah, cry, cry, cry, I was about to say if I fucking die from this I'm gonna actually fight

02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:05.760
um, Kaelin, wow, did not know I was here, um, oh fuck, oh I'm fine,

02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:09.200
anyways,

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.120
what is rising behind me, skeleton boys,

02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:26.320
alright, let me just run over this and there's one in here, oh these motherfuckers, yeah no,

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:41.280
we're not doing that today, oh hey, it's you, um, I'm sorry but I'm not interested into what you

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:51.760
have to sell, oh come on bro, I don't, I don't have time for this, just leave me, you fucking house

02:14:51.760 --> 02:15:08.720
centipedes, I hate those, why are you so fast for no reason, are you good bro, oh fuck, I'm like

02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:18.560
literally about to die, you get crushed like a bug, alright,

02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:28.960
yeah why don't you hug him with your little doofy ass hats, um, you don't look too good,

02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.840
she's probably fine right,

02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:45.040
handing out ice cream in the chat, you have to save her, she's hot, I don't feel like doing her quest,

02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:53.040
she's like breathing so heavily in my fucking ears,

02:15:53.040 --> 02:16:01.360
um, alright, let's look for golden seeds,

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:39.680
okay, uh, frick, damn, there's so many, oh,

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:51.040

okay, let's go talk to invisible people, we love to see you, yeah,

02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:27.120
that ship, I don't know, I've never been able to, um, what is happening, what is, what is happening,

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:33.040
what's happening, what is happening to my stick, why isn't it moving,

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:40.960
the fuck, that was a weird ass glitch, anyways, um, I'm right next to the cellio town of sorcery,

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:50.800
it's like right over here, it's like, like up here, here, all right, let's go talk to these bitches,

02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:22.640
oh

02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:26.640
comical typing,

02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.640
oh thank god there's a grace right here,

02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:53.760

02:19:53.760 --> 02:20:01.600
just like go to your face, just sucks, um, okay, this is the tree, it was like literally over there,

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:04.800

are you shitting me right now, what do you have to say about this,

02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:16.800
oh it's because I went the back way,

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:21.520
damn I have to go around,

02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:29.120
I hear people creepily making noises on the other side, oh it's that,

02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:36.000
oh, um, I'm fine,

02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:39.840
yeah I'm fine,

02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:46.320
nice, uh cool, I totally just,

02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:53.600
cool, yeah, nice, cool,

02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:03.440
what a beautiful town, really, look how, how gorgeous it is, it's so empty,

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:10.080
can't believe nobody lives in this gorgeous, beautiful town, I kind of want to drop down on this

02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:11.840
thing, yeah,

02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:18.800
yeah, uh, oh quick teleport,

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:23.040
I don't want to accidentally aggro people when I can't get out,

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:28.400
I got a bullet, I'm scared, I'm so sorry,

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:36.160
you live there, I'm so sorry that you do, um, okay, cool, we got that,

02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:39.120
uh,

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:50.560
one can be, did I get that one near red main,

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:57.200
I mean I think I did, I think, did I,

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:07.600
I'm sorry, I wanted to do these ones, um, oh yeah, no I definitely talked to him,

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:14.160
um, so I definitely probably grabbed that one, question mark, let me just sit down,

02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:27.280
I need three golden seeds,

02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:35.440
uh, I think I already grabbed that one, am I winning, that's debatable,

02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:43.040
there's also the pewter tree spirit, but I don't feel like doing that, um,

02:22:44.480 --> 02:23:00.960
okay, let's go to limb grave, because I haven't, I haven't gone to limb grave,

02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:04.000
I also haven't gone to fort height,

02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:13.600
yeah, there's fort height, there's the starfall center, uh,

02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:19.600
fort height is over here, it is,

02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:30.560
it was really interesting, my first playthrough,

02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:37.680
um, I had a weird glitch that live never spawned,

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:43.760
and I didn't do anything, like it's like I literally was like playing the game

02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:50.720
as linearly as it can get, and you could hear Blythe like howl and shit or whatever the

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:56.160
fuck noise he makes, but then I never saw him, he never, and he's like, you know he's like at

02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:02.400
the top of that thing or whatever, I had to restart my game so I could talk to him,

02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:06.960
I didn't, well I just made another game, I just, because I was just like, what the fuck, it was

02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:16.480
really weird, uh, yeah the whistle never worked, yeah because you have to get the whistle so he

02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:26.000
shows up, yeah it never worked, he just glitched and never showed, hi, I don't feel like talking to you,

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.200
um, not that I have any money to buy shit,

02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:44.560
hey, how's it going,

02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:52.720
how's it going everyone, I don't mind if I grab that real quick, oh I gotta go,

02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:56.640
it's been cool, nice seeing you all, it's been a really long time,

02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:01.360
glad to see you guys are all in good spirits, love that for you,

02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:15.760
yeah, oh yeah there's just a thingy, um, I still, okay I'm not, uh, where is the other one,

02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:18.640
yeah I was really annoying,

02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:25.760
let me find the sleeping peninsula,

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.440
fuck, did I get that one, I can't recall,

02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.240
I don't think I did, again I've literally just been bouncing around places so I probably haven't

02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:52.000
gone to places, oh, okay maybe I did, we'll just see,

02:25:52.160 --> 02:26:10.000
so literally like right here, let's see if I

02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:15.760
got that one because I can't recall if I did,

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:24.880
isn't there like a giant here,

02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:32.960
yeah, there it is, I don't think I grabbed it because of the giant,

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.440
um, yeah there it is,

02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:45.360
I think I was more distracted by the giant, yep,

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.560
let her go towards, good job, make it down, thank you,

02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:59.280
that's a close one, yikes, um, so aggro, I can't get out of here,

02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:07.920
yippee, let me just get rid of that marker, I can't get rid of the marker, let's just float,

02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:09.760
run at the marker,

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:19.600
whoa, we're gonna kill this giant,

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:36.880
get him, hurry before he shoots the ground,

02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:40.880
yeah,

02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:46.400
ow,

02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:56.160
yeah, what, I thought I jumped, I'm just not jumping, at least you're not doing that much

02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:04.960
damage to me, that's cool, um, thanks, I'm sure you can have your bow, that'd be nice, arm,

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:08.560
arm, what's up here again, how are we gonna,

02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:21.360
aw, thank you,

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.040
your sheepee tax, that's cute, thank you, thank you for the tip,

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:35.600
um, when you guys are useless, just start paying me money, that's sad,

02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:44.720
okay, I got that, wait, why don't I, I just forget to do things,

02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:57.440
tutorial island, that's a good way of putting it,

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:08.160
cool, nice, okay, so we got the riot,

02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:11.600
um,

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:22.400
if I kill Kenneth height, I can get one,

02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:31.120
I didn't know I could kill Kenneth height for a fucking thing,

02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:40.640
so,

02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:06.080
if you kill him, he gives you a golden seed,

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.920
Kenneth did nothing wrong, you can max it out without killing him, I never knew that,

02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:24.720
because I completed his quest before, and I know I could kill him, I just would have,

02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:29.600
learning of the gains,

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:40.480
damn, there's one in the carry a manor, I do love carry a manor, it's one of my favorite levels

02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:53.360
to clear, there's one in oxtella, there's one in sofra, lindel, yeah, two can be found

02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:57.120
underneath the phantom tree inside the western gate, capillel skirts,

02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:15.680
he's gonna steal her to stormville castle when you steal her elven line,

02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:20.720
I think completing this quest along with the water, yeah, nepheli, whatever,

02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:28.640
you max upgrade, yeah, I did that before, okay, there's really nothing else I could grab

02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:35.760
without having to defeat bosses, because there's also a tree spirit in the pharynx roll

02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:42.240
heroes grave, and I do have the key to get into that, and there's also the putrid spirit boss

02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:49.360
at the end of the war dead catacombs, so that would be two, but that's not really my goal right

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:54.000
now, my goal is just because I would rather be leveled so I can just fuck everybody up

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.760
and then get those later, so now

02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:06.800
I'm thinking we go get that mimic tear, I think, I think it's time

02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:13.840
the base talisman, what's the base talisman,

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:21.520
I did clear the pharynx roll heroes grave, I just don't remember the name of shit,

02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:24.960
I just don't remember the name of shit,

02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:42.000
where's the lady with the fingers, where's the finger lady, I'm gonna finger her so fucking hard,

02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:50.880
what does the earth treats favor do, I forget, hey

02:32:57.120 --> 02:32:59.760
you think I'm cute, you have some interesting toes

02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:11.360
I hate them so much, they're so fucking gross okay,

02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:19.760
just some random eldritch, they're not even like part of something,

02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:25.280
they're not like part of a big hand, or they are part of a big hand, and the hand talks to her,

02:33:26.240 --> 02:33:30.640
and it's because of the outer lords, where's your head, oh yeah I don't care,

02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:34.400
thank you,

02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:41.920
big preach, big preach, uh

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:48.160
what am I doing, you have incantations but I'm not doing that,

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:57.600
oh the all knowing, the all glowing, I'm gonna destroy your entire fucking area,

02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:02.400
oh you can't destroy as much as you could, I remember you could destroy literally everything in

02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:10.320
this room, and now you can't, where is he, where the fuck is this bitch, and what do I have to do,

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:15.440
I'm hoping it isn't mine, I did some redecorating,

02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:24.080
this looks pretty good,

02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:31.520
yeah I remember before you could like fucking destroy this table, I mean destroying literature,

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:41.760
I thought the emissary of the greater well are two fingers sitting in a room, yeah I just,

02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:51.120
honestly George R. R. Martin, and was it Miyazaki, yeah I'm fucking stupid, they're interesting,

02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:55.440
did I, I already unlocked the dung eater,

02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:56.880
hey

02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:03.600
I never finished your quest, you're fucking weird though, you just like

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:08.080
fucking desecrate people's corpses, um

02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:12.240
no, here you go,

02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:18.640
oh nifty, nice bell bearing bitch,

02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.800
this bitch is just festering bloody finger,

02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:36.640
because it's like night armor, night helm,

02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:42.720
they don't, let me buy that,

02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.040
I'm like guano goblin, caca consumer,

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.640

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:05.040

02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:08.560
this dude's bow,

02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:21.280
again I always get turned around to this place, these ugly ass fingers, why is it two weird fingers,

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:29.680
I don't, who's supposed to sit here, that's not you,

02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:37.440
I would like to receive equipment of champions, I don't have enough money,

02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.560

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:50.080
thank you, big preach,

02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:54.320
I thought she was gonna tell me to go fuck myself,

see uh, I have a good time at work, I'll see you in eight hours,

02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:07.520
I should do anything with those games, I could tell what's happening, don't worry about it,

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:13.200
the two fingers and three fingers make a hand, why, I don't know,

02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:19.840
yeah because Ronnie likes the three fingers, they like the two fingers and they together make a hand,

02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:24.400
because you got like the thumb is supposed to definitely be over here and then you,

02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:30.640
I feel like this is, yeah the thumb's supposed to be over here, then the ring and the pinky finger

02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:37.760
and then those are the three fingers, they're so gross, I hate them so much, um Ronnie likes the three fingers,

02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:45.920

what was I gonna say, what are the names of, you guys need to tell me names of things,

02:53:53.840 --> 02:54:01.120
there's a plus 10 intelligence physique down there, down where,

02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:08.960
and where, tell me the names of things, they says like if it was lyza p and I told my friend I was

02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:13.840
getting older and he laughed at me, say good luck, I love lyza p, lyza p is great, I love lyza p,

02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:25.120
you guys are telling me the names of things, magic, shrouding, underwear,

02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:32.960
you go down the cliff behind you and hug the wall, you get the 10 and tell, oh that's actually

02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:41.760
pretty good, don't mind if I do, this one,

02:54:53.920 --> 02:55:01.440
you said underwear, yes but be careful, okay, um, I can tell people had the same idea,

02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:08.720
probably this one for it, what was I saying, oh, um,

02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:16.640
what, does anybody just see me land on that top of the tree,

02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:26.720
all right, I'll wait before I move forward, do I go to the left or do I go to the right,

02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:38.400
I was sure, I was sure I was dead, I just like, there's like a random like thing right there,

02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:47.440
I wonder if that's what the thing says, left, okay, thank you, let me heal, that would be smart

02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:55.600
of me, I do like this, the flask of the, of what I have in this because it gives me like a little

02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:06.560
bonus health, do I keep hugging the wall, where do I hear weird shit,

02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:14.480
I know, I was like, why am I on a tree,

02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:17.920

I have the grave and stool school talisman, I have that for some reason,

02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:28.000
I don't really need the source seal anymore,

02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:41.680

um, we'll do some things for some, oh, fuck me bro, um,

02:59:04.160 --> 02:59:10.640

who's shooting me, oh,

03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:29.120
it's his butterfly wound, his butt is scratched,

03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:38.960
it's fine, I can't really see that well,

03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:47.920
oh, one disappeared, can I, I don't know why it, it's all over to me over there,

03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:59.280

03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:17.120
bro had some aim, he did, I have a big wedgie, hold on, my fucking shorts,

03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:25.840
where the arrow is big enough, I don't think they were, because they didn't kill me,

03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:40.240
hey, how you doing, here, I'm just gonna aggro only you, so I don't have to deal with your boys

03:05:08.960 --> 03:05:10.320
yeah, I totally timed that wrong,

03:05:10.320 --> 03:05:16.000
no,

03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:31.920
I don't think this lock is annoying, I feel like my camera isn't doing well,

03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:38.560
yeah, yeah, oh you killed me, what the hell, I was not paying attention to my health,

03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:45.040

03:05:47.680 --> 03:05:52.080
I don't know why I'm losing at the fucking, I should have taken five seconds, I hate it when

03:05:52.080 --> 03:05:56.480
I like, it's always my first attempt, I beat, like I'm so close to beating a boss,

03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:03.040
but then I just choke the next 50 times, I don't know why that is, but it's a thing,

03:06:03.680 --> 03:06:09.840
this happens to me, I think because I overthink it, it's the chibi syndrome,

03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:15.760
I don't like the name of that, it's the souls game, I prefer the souls game effect,

03:06:16.720 --> 03:06:19.120
rather than the chibi syndrome,

03:06:25.360 --> 03:06:30.240
I creep up, I think you saw me,

03:06:33.120 --> 03:06:36.160

I'm gonna fall off the fucking cliff again,

03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:26.720
no, it's fine,

03:18:48.880 --> 03:18:56.720
why do you keep doing this, I don't,

03:18:58.880 --> 03:19:02.400
I'm literally trying to fucking dodge,

03:19:02.960 --> 03:19:06.240
can we not die,

03:19:06.240 --> 03:19:10.240

03:19:32.880 --> 03:19:39.600
no, damn you, it gives you a lot of tears, um, anyways,

03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:47.120
that took way too fucking long, first try everybody, first try, I should have been the

03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:50.240
first try, again, I almost always kill shit in the first try,

03:19:50.640 --> 03:19:58.080
actually you know where I'm gonna go,

03:19:58.080 --> 03:20:03.840
yeah, yeah, also when I play Elden Ring, I just get distracted and I need to get

03:20:03.840 --> 03:20:12.000
shit done, GV syndrome strong, zero deaths, I feel like watching a zero death Elden Ring run,

03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:14.960
ah, EG,

03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:29.920
oh, I did it,

03:20:33.200 --> 03:20:34.160
now we're at five,

03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:45.120
okay,

03:20:52.080 --> 03:20:53.120
fuck,

03:20:53.360 --> 03:21:00.080
because I like, oh, I don't,

03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:11.440
wait, did I just do that, I just do that correctly, no, I don't,

03:21:14.080 --> 03:21:18.640
lies of PTSD, lies of P wasn't even bad compared to Elden Ring, it's really not,

03:21:18.960 --> 03:21:23.600
yeah, it's really not,

03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:31.600
it's also, I liked lies of P because I think I liked how linear it was,

03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:33.440
now everything loops back around pretty easily,

03:21:37.280 --> 03:21:44.640
I want sheepies to moonvail me, moonvail you anytime baby girl, my baby doll,

03:21:45.600 --> 03:21:47.920

03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:26.080
so you never know, alerted, alerted, oh, it's a fucking bear,

03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:34.880

yeah, we're going to jump off this cliff, let's fucking do it,

03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:19.280
it's a message today, oh, something incredible, you guys ready,

03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:34.880
I didn't want to jump off the cliff, it was impulsive, I knew I was going to die,

03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:35.920
I just really wanted to do it,

03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:44.160
zero deaths, zero deaths, zero deaths,

03:23:49.680 --> 03:23:53.280
and call the void is strong, right, you just want to throw yourself into it,

03:23:53.280 --> 03:24:04.480

03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:08.880
I need to grab my little runes, where is it,

03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:17.440
why can't I, why is discord telling me to DM people, you just added this person as a friend,

03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:22.080
you should DM them, I don't, I was like, that should just be circumvented from when I actually

03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:30.160
have a call with them, every game we're just going to have to jump off a cliff,

03:24:32.880 --> 03:24:39.280
a 4,000 wow, all right, I forgot how to get down here, let me just,

03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:56.400
may call me itchy,

03:24:56.400 --> 03:25:25.060
So pretty, wow, wow, oh, there it is, the stream chat froze.

03:25:25.060 --> 03:25:28.380
What do you expect me to do about that?

03:25:28.380 --> 03:25:34.900
I don't know what to tell you, brother.

03:25:34.900 --> 03:25:40.380
I don't know what to tell you, you guys broke my chat.

03:25:40.380 --> 03:25:42.580
What am I supposed to do?

03:25:42.580 --> 03:25:53.620
How could you do this?

03:25:53.620 --> 03:26:04.260
Oh my god, it's gone, you destroyed it, I fixed it, it's fine.

03:26:04.260 --> 03:26:12.740
I can't believe you've done this, you guys really wanted to read what you were saying.

03:26:12.740 --> 03:26:18.420
Don't forget, everything when I play video games is your fault.

03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:22.020
I'm just gonna, yeah, this is fine, isn't it?

03:26:22.020 --> 03:26:23.020
Don't die.

Cool, nice, cool, nice, cool, nice, cool, what the fuck are people falling off over

03:26:33.660 --> 03:26:34.660
here before?

03:26:34.660 --> 03:26:38.780
I don't want to see what this person did.

03:26:38.780 --> 03:26:46.340
Girl, why are you pissing so loud, Reina's just about, oh, they just, what do they think

03:26:46.340 --> 03:26:49.340

03:26:49.340 --> 03:26:59.340
Reina is pissing in that little box, alright, is this the only way to go?

03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:12.180
Alright, chicken, no jumping ahead, underground required ahead, yeah, no shit, try jumping,

03:27:18.100 --> 03:27:31.700
Funny, like, how would anyone make that jump is so funny to me.

03:27:31.700 --> 03:27:45.420
That's Reina, she'd be pissing, there's so much fog, what does it say?

03:27:46.420 --> 03:27:54.220
You're not wrong, oh shit, jumping off required ahead, down, we're going down, down, in an

03:28:10.740 --> 03:28:15.260
That's crazy, can't believe you, which way do I go?

03:28:15.700 --> 03:28:26.260
Not this way, that's for sure, I don't believe it's that way, definitely this way, oh, I

So, Sofra is my favorite area, and my least favorite area at the same time, it's my favorite

03:28:53.220 --> 03:29:02.820
area because of how gorgeous it is that in Noskilla, whatever it's called, you know,

I bullied the four, four thing,

03:42:03.180 --> 03:42:07.500
why is everybody mad that I killed a naked version of myself,

03:42:08.140 --> 03:42:28.220
all right, I recall, if I, if I can recall correctly, the mimic tear is somewhere

03:42:29.340 --> 03:42:35.660
in that castle place and it's guarded by two ladies, I'm probably totally wrong,

03:42:38.300 --> 03:42:44.380
I'm gonna kill, why are there birds down here, to make that make sense, that's my question,

03:42:50.060 --> 03:42:51.020

I have a stone key, so that's fine, I don't know, guys, I don't remember,

03:43:27.100 --> 03:43:31.340
find building rooftops to enter night's sacred ground, fight more mimics,

03:44:50.140 --> 03:44:52.140
okay, I need to like,

03:45:00.860 --> 03:45:10.620
I'm giving you another chance, walk forward five paces, one, two, three, four, five,

03:45:11.420 --> 03:45:13.340
that's kind of a, let's do that, oh what's this,

03:45:24.620 --> 03:45:25.820
I jumped out here,

03:45:34.460 --> 03:45:37.340
you guys don't even know where the fuck I'm going, oh my god, great,

03:45:41.420 --> 03:45:47.180
walk away until you find, you guys are just terrible at describing things, that's what I've learned,

03:45:51.020 --> 03:45:53.660
can I, I can't use torrent on here, can I, oh I can, sorry,

03:45:54.940 --> 03:46:01.980
so get down off the bridge safely, and hug the left of the forest, okay, hello little deer,

03:46:02.380 --> 03:46:09.180
hug the left of the forest, right now you're falling off,

03:46:14.780 --> 03:46:22.140
left of the forest, left, oh shit, left of the forest, staying on the left of the forest,

03:46:24.060 --> 03:46:31.500
the left of the, oh that worked, the left of the forest, oh yeah, there's a fucking dog around here,

03:46:31.500 --> 03:46:42.700
I just remembered, is it over here, oh give me that, okay I'm at the grace,

03:46:45.260 --> 03:46:52.540
there's people looking at me, I don't like how they're reaching out, explain that, now it's parkour,

03:46:54.380 --> 03:46:57.820
from here you get to platform, all right,

03:47:02.140 --> 03:47:09.980
looks like somebody died, not me though, I don't die,

03:47:16.380 --> 03:47:21.820
hardcore parkour, can I just jump off onto that guy, that'd be nice,

03:47:22.780 --> 03:47:29.100
all righty, all righty, all righty, I feel like I already fucked up, no I didn't, you,

03:47:32.540 --> 03:47:38.300
maybe, I mean to be fair you did charge a horse off of a ledge onto your rooftop,

03:47:39.180 --> 03:47:43.340
so find a path that deviates toward the left and parkour left with some nipple chimneys

03:47:43.340 --> 03:47:48.140
onto a lower area, I like the description, some nipple chimneys, how do I fucking,

03:47:50.620 --> 03:47:57.740
go back, go right, oh you're right, yep, yep, yep, uh huh, yes, oh it's all coming back to me now,

can you get a famous jump, that's fine,

03:49:39.820 --> 03:49:42.860
I think when I played the game I honestly only fell off of that like once,

03:49:47.660 --> 03:49:53.500
booby chimneys, straight, alrighty,

03:50:01.980 --> 03:50:03.500

from here you want to head into the hallway and out the window,

03:54:23.420 --> 03:54:28.860
all right, why is there just a random spinning stone here,

03:54:29.260 --> 03:54:35.420

03:55:35.100 --> 03:55:46.460
and me,

03:55:50.460 --> 03:55:57.180
it should add a jump over ledge, no because I thought it was like a sloping roof that I

03:55:57.180 --> 03:56:02.460
could just drop down to, that was funny,

03:56:02.860 --> 03:56:13.020
kopee,

03:56:17.020 --> 03:56:21.020
no,

03:56:21.820 --> 03:56:32.700
no, my runes, all right, I don't need to be here anymore, it's fine,

03:56:36.780 --> 03:56:39.180
I know I parkour too hard, I don't even need to be here,

03:56:41.660 --> 03:56:42.860
how the fuck do I get out,

03:56:43.820 --> 03:56:50.140

03:56:51.020 --> 03:56:54.700

03:56:58.300 --> 03:57:02.460
all right, yeah let's just, let's just, let's head over to the artist shack,

03:57:03.020 --> 03:57:07.020
all right,

03:57:11.820 --> 03:57:12.460
we made it,

03:57:17.820 --> 03:57:21.820
yeah mandatory if you summon mimic you didn't beat the game, that's so stupid,

03:57:24.460 --> 03:57:25.900
yeah I should probably get a lantern,

03:57:26.700 --> 03:57:34.220
where are the lanterns, can I, I can buy it from uh, what's this face, can I,

03:57:36.460 --> 03:57:37.580
oh that's not what I wanted,

03:57:45.580 --> 03:57:46.460
what the fuck am I doing,

03:57:55.900 --> 03:58:07.740
it's a merchant in South Eler Eurnia, it's not, I thought Ella had it,

03:58:08.620 --> 03:58:10.940
I mean, what the fuck this dude's name is,

03:58:15.420 --> 03:58:17.260
no, oh he has a torch, that's what he has,

03:58:18.220 --> 03:58:21.020
I can use a telescope,

03:58:29.420 --> 03:58:31.660
get a cool chain quaff,

03:58:35.900 --> 03:58:36.380
for now,

03:58:36.860 --> 03:58:48.220
uh, South Eurnia,

03:58:56.860 --> 03:59:04.220
if you use any other weapon than dagger or use any armor you cheat,

03:59:07.100 --> 03:59:10.300
it's the isolated merchant, I thought you said it was Eurnia,

03:59:14.380 --> 03:59:21.900
because is it the dude over here, no, is it the dude over here, where,

03:59:32.540 --> 03:59:33.500
where do I go,

03:59:37.260 --> 03:59:41.980
bottom left island, over here,

03:59:44.620 --> 03:59:46.220
in the, where the dragon shit is,

03:59:48.860 --> 03:59:50.300
that left shirt, what,

03:59:53.820 --> 03:59:55.420
left side, oh so over here,

04:00:01.020 --> 04:00:04.860
you guys are giving me multiple things, you're giving me Eler Eurnia and you're giving me

04:00:05.660 --> 04:00:06.540
even peninsula,

04:00:14.780 --> 04:00:18.940
I'll have to start calling on you and be like you there, you tell me where to go,

04:00:18.940 --> 04:00:22.140
because everybody else is, then I'll give it to somebody else another turn,

04:00:29.980 --> 04:00:30.460
hello,

04:00:35.660 --> 04:00:44.220
I remember trying to fight this like one dude forever on the beach,

04:00:45.980 --> 04:00:46.940
I don't know who it was,

04:00:54.940 --> 04:00:56.860
all the beach south, I'm going north,

04:01:01.420 --> 04:01:03.660
other direction, I did it,

04:01:05.420 --> 04:01:07.740
maybe I like to do things the hard way,

04:01:08.940 --> 04:01:12.940
look at these guys, they're just, they're just hanging out,

04:01:14.060 --> 04:01:17.820
they're just doing guy things, they're literally just like,

04:01:17.820 --> 04:01:20.860
why are there so many of them by the beach, I always wondered that,

04:01:20.860 --> 04:01:25.340
is this just so you could practice like giant crowd spells or attacks,

04:01:26.620 --> 04:01:30.300
maybe, I don't know, it's a casual beach party,

04:01:31.260 --> 04:01:32.780
let's go to the beach,

04:01:32.780 --> 04:01:35.260
beach, Ninky Minjaj,

04:01:39.020 --> 04:01:43.900
oh hey, isn't this what the shrimp guy is, the prawn guy, the shrimp prawn guy too,

04:01:53.260 --> 04:01:55.580
bye, you have a nice outfit,

04:01:55.580 --> 04:02:01.020
do you cover your face completely,

04:02:03.820 --> 04:02:07.660
at the end of the day, I would like to buy one lantern,

04:02:09.500 --> 04:02:12.860
one moment, just give me a second, I swear I have money,

04:02:13.740 --> 04:02:15.580
I'm sorry my card's not working,

04:02:17.820 --> 04:02:22.060
it's gonna work in just a second, I swear to god,

04:02:25.820 --> 04:02:28.300
give me, give me a moment,

04:02:31.580 --> 04:02:34.380
I should have done that one, I should have done that one,

04:02:39.180 --> 04:02:44.300
2,500, how much was it,

04:02:48.540 --> 04:02:52.620
what was it, I think it was 1,800, I already forgot,

04:02:55.580 --> 04:03:09.020
we're gonna, we'll leave him a tip, you know, we'll leave him,

04:03:09.020 --> 04:03:12.220
fuck, we'll leave him a tip, sorry, I'm trying to talk to you,

04:03:13.660 --> 04:03:16.380
yeah, sorry I'm like making you look over your shoulder,

04:03:16.380 --> 04:03:18.780
what,

04:03:21.340 --> 04:03:27.180
those ashes of, oh, the Zwei Handar, colossal sword,

04:03:27.180 --> 04:03:31.900
sacrificial twig, what you guys are except it's sacrificial twink,

04:03:46.380 --> 04:04:01.900
yeah, you know, you got your lantern, I should probably put that to someplace else,

04:04:16.380 --> 04:04:30.700
2,000, magnificent weapon,

04:04:34.620 --> 04:04:37.340
all right, so we got the Mimic Tear,

04:04:37.580 --> 04:04:46.460
I don't have a lot of glove wart, I think I only have like,

04:04:50.460 --> 04:04:55.580
why, I hate that sometimes I like to mark it, life is robots,

04:04:59.500 --> 04:05:03.340
is Roderica doing shit now, no, she's just being weird, can you like,

04:05:07.500 --> 04:05:12.860
oh, sorry, we have to talk to fucking Master Hugue, damn it, I'm going the wrong way,

04:05:16.940 --> 04:05:21.980
Hugue, Hugue, balls, I'm going the wrong way, I told you guys, I just get lost,

04:05:24.780 --> 04:05:30.300
Hugue, that's the two fingers, you spin me right around,

04:05:31.260 --> 04:05:39.260
baby right around, Hugue, what's in here, oh it's Fia, Fia, hi Fia,

04:05:47.820 --> 04:05:51.260
hi,

04:06:01.180 --> 04:06:14.540
here's the homie, here's question line next for Nagakiba and the

04:06:15.180 --> 04:06:23.260
anti-mogue bullshit crystal, yes, you're right, I want to hug Fia but she debuffs me,

04:06:25.500 --> 04:06:28.460
I forget, how do you get, doesn't she give you something to get rid of the debuff,

04:06:31.020 --> 04:06:36.940
I forget, the blessing, okay,

04:06:42.620 --> 04:06:43.420
I sort of way,

04:06:47.500 --> 04:06:53.260
Fia, oh, the lovely hug,

04:06:54.140 --> 04:06:59.340
I'm in a cold suit of armor but thank you,

04:07:04.620 --> 04:07:05.660
what is a bald again,

04:07:06.620 --> 04:07:17.660
you take me in your pants,

04:07:20.780 --> 04:07:25.660
no, I didn't want to go, why is everybody so weirdly fucking proportioned,

04:07:30.380 --> 04:07:33.660
besides our own character, our heads are so small,

04:07:35.660 --> 04:07:37.660
oh,

04:07:51.420 --> 04:07:55.980
call me dear, yeah, yeah, yeah,

04:07:56.860 --> 04:07:57.980
you're on the top,

04:08:05.500 --> 04:08:09.100
my second never wants to repeat the fraction I was going over here,

04:08:12.300 --> 04:08:14.780
oh, I'm not dead, Rodriguez,

04:08:19.580 --> 04:08:24.300
I love their like friendship, like his fatherly affection for her, it's very sweet,

04:08:25.980 --> 04:08:28.980
Why do you have chains on your legs?

04:08:28.980 --> 04:08:30.980
It's like, why are you so ugly?

04:08:30.980 --> 04:08:37.980
You know, just ask people why they have chains on their legs and why they're ugly.

04:08:37.980 --> 04:08:40.980
I'm going to kill this guy, because I feel like it.

04:08:40.980 --> 04:08:43.980
Oh, I got a new member.

04:08:43.980 --> 04:08:46.980
Welcome. Welcome to the harem.

04:08:46.980 --> 04:08:54.980
Are there any details to pay attention to the forces of our life at this time?

04:08:55.980 --> 04:08:57.980
You guys are the real one.

04:09:03.980 --> 04:09:05.980
Oh, nice.

04:09:05.980 --> 04:09:07.980
I got one of those.

04:09:07.980 --> 04:09:11.980
Isn't that like late game? I forget.

04:09:11.980 --> 04:09:15.980
Ugh, weird.

04:09:15.980 --> 04:09:18.980
I got that boom boom pow.

04:09:19.980 --> 04:09:24.980
Oh, we're both going to kill each other?

04:09:24.980 --> 04:09:26.980
Yeah.

04:09:34.980 --> 04:09:36.980
Stop.

04:09:36.980 --> 04:09:38.980
Don't heal again, you motherfucker.

04:09:38.980 --> 04:09:40.980
I have frostbite.

04:09:42.980 --> 04:09:43.980
Stop it.

04:09:43.980 --> 04:09:45.980
No, you don't get to kill me.

04:09:49.980 --> 04:09:54.980
No.

04:09:54.980 --> 04:09:56.980
What?

04:10:18.980 --> 04:10:33.980
I threw my controller across the room. I don't know if you guys hear it, heard it.

04:10:33.980 --> 04:10:53.980
No, I think it kind of just like rolled over my couch to be honest with you, then plopped on the ground.

04:10:53.980 --> 04:10:57.980
Looks like we have a new throne entry.

04:10:57.980 --> 04:11:01.980
No, I need to add, what's it called?

04:11:01.980 --> 04:11:06.980
Am I throne? I usually get new joy cons because I have six drifts.

04:11:06.980 --> 04:11:11.980
I'm going to go grab my controller.

04:11:28.980 --> 04:11:30.980
Thank you.

04:11:33.980 --> 04:11:36.980
Oh, are you taking care of this one?

04:11:43.980 --> 04:11:46.980
Okay, a little ruffle of your process.

04:11:46.980 --> 04:11:48.980
Alright, where'd it go?

04:11:48.980 --> 04:11:50.980
Oh, over here.

04:11:50.980 --> 04:11:52.980
Hi, Raina.

04:11:52.980 --> 04:11:56.980
Are you like, ended up in your general direction?

04:12:00.980 --> 04:12:03.980
I'm going to get on the stretch.

04:12:03.980 --> 04:12:05.980
Yeah.

04:12:05.980 --> 04:12:08.980
You want to stretch me?

04:12:08.980 --> 04:12:10.980
You want to stretch me?

04:12:10.980 --> 04:12:14.980
Yeah, all of you.

04:12:14.980 --> 04:12:18.980
You didn't do the stretching, did you?

04:12:18.980 --> 04:12:20.980
Oh, you can see it.

04:12:20.980 --> 04:12:22.980
Hi, Raina.

04:12:22.980 --> 04:12:24.980
I know you're here. I just saw you, Raina.

04:12:24.980 --> 04:12:26.980
I thought you were being fake.

04:12:26.980 --> 04:12:30.980
Here, you're looking a little bit chunky.

04:12:30.980 --> 04:12:32.980
What's that, Raina?

04:12:32.980 --> 04:12:35.980
Why do you look so large?

04:12:35.980 --> 04:12:38.980
Here, why do you look a little funny?

04:12:38.980 --> 04:12:41.980
It's because we're done.

04:12:41.980 --> 04:12:43.980
Come here.

04:12:44.980 --> 04:12:47.980
You look like you're taking over this world.

04:12:49.980 --> 04:12:52.980
It was raised alongside dogs,

04:12:52.980 --> 04:12:54.980
but under a rescuer,

04:12:54.980 --> 04:12:58.980
and sometimes she curls her tail over her back.

04:12:58.980 --> 04:13:00.980
I mean...

04:13:13.980 --> 04:13:16.980
Yeah, can you do a big stretch?

04:13:27.980 --> 04:13:30.980
Yeah, a lot of big stretch.

04:13:31.980 --> 04:13:33.980
Yeah?

04:13:36.980 --> 04:13:39.980
Raina, stretch!

04:13:39.980 --> 04:13:44.980
She did it.

04:13:44.980 --> 04:13:49.980
She got up on her tippy toes and stretched her up real long.

04:13:49.980 --> 04:13:52.980
You guys missed it.

04:13:52.980 --> 04:13:54.980
Sorry.

04:13:58.980 --> 04:14:01.980
Why do I have in my box of Korean food?

04:14:02.980 --> 04:14:04.980
Fuck away from here.

04:14:04.980 --> 04:14:07.980
No, is this a shiho right?

04:14:07.980 --> 04:14:09.980
I'm fine.

04:14:09.980 --> 04:14:11.980
What's in here?

04:14:11.980 --> 04:14:13.980
I got...

04:14:13.980 --> 04:14:16.980
They're all just like pastry things.

04:14:16.980 --> 04:14:18.980
Victory pie.

04:14:18.980 --> 04:14:20.980
Ooh, a victory pie.

04:14:20.980 --> 04:14:22.980
I should eat a victory pie.

04:14:22.980 --> 04:14:24.980
I'll eat this victory pie.

04:14:24.980 --> 04:14:26.980
The vic pie.

04:14:26.980 --> 04:14:28.980
That's a weird-looking thing on it.

04:14:28.980 --> 04:14:30.980
After I beat the fucking mad tone,

04:14:30.980 --> 04:14:32.980
al-bar-la-la-la-la.

04:14:34.980 --> 04:14:36.980
I'm about to go mono-e-mono.

04:14:36.980 --> 04:14:38.980
My headphones are off.

04:14:38.980 --> 04:14:41.980
I need to plug in my controller again.

04:14:44.980 --> 04:14:46.980
Oh, my God.

04:14:46.980 --> 04:14:48.980
She said, call that dolphin kitty.

04:14:48.980 --> 04:14:50.980
My cat used to do that. That's cute.

04:14:54.980 --> 04:14:56.980
If you're confident, you can get replacement choices

04:14:56.980 --> 04:14:58.980
whether they be cheap or expensive.

04:14:58.980 --> 04:15:00.980
You don't know what you're doing.

04:15:00.980 --> 04:15:02.980
What?

04:15:02.980 --> 04:15:04.980
Placement joysticks?

04:15:04.980 --> 04:15:06.980
You want me to take apart my controller?

04:15:06.980 --> 04:15:08.980
You want me to take apart my Joy-Con?

04:15:08.980 --> 04:15:10.980
I'm smart, but I'm not that smart.

04:15:16.980 --> 04:15:18.980
See, it works fine.

04:15:18.980 --> 04:15:21.980
My PlayStation controller works fine.

04:15:26.980 --> 04:15:28.980
I'll break. I come to bargain.

04:15:28.980 --> 04:15:30.980
I'll take this, though.

04:15:42.980 --> 04:15:44.980
You don't get to stun-lock me, dude.

04:15:44.980 --> 04:15:46.980
No.

04:15:50.980 --> 04:15:52.980
What the fuck?

04:15:52.980 --> 04:15:54.980
What the hell?

04:15:56.980 --> 04:15:58.980
I want a scythe.

04:15:58.980 --> 04:16:00.980
Where do I get this fucking scythe?

04:16:04.980 --> 04:16:06.980
Oh, my God. He's going to kill me again.

04:16:06.980 --> 04:16:08.980
I got frostbite.

04:16:16.980 --> 04:16:18.980
Why don't you fucking heal?

04:16:18.980 --> 04:16:20.980
Yeah.

04:16:20.980 --> 04:16:22.980
Why don't you fucking heal?

04:16:22.980 --> 04:16:24.980
Motherfucker.

04:16:26.980 --> 04:16:28.980
Yeah, you don't have any more, bitch.

04:16:28.980 --> 04:16:30.980
Oh, shit.

04:16:30.980 --> 04:16:32.980
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

04:16:32.980 --> 04:16:34.980
But I have more.

04:16:34.980 --> 04:16:36.980
Because I'm that bitch.

04:16:46.980 --> 04:16:48.980
Anyways.

04:16:50.980 --> 04:16:52.980
Is that the meta in the PvP?

04:16:52.980 --> 04:16:54.980
I never ever play PvP.

04:16:56.980 --> 04:16:58.980
Is that the meta?

04:16:58.980 --> 04:17:00.980
Did this be a door?

04:17:00.980 --> 04:17:02.980
I don't know. You tell me.

04:17:04.980 --> 04:17:06.980
Stole his tongue.

04:17:06.980 --> 04:17:08.980
Mmm.

04:17:08.980 --> 04:17:10.980
Time for this victory pie.

04:17:10.980 --> 04:17:12.980
It looks really gross.

04:17:12.980 --> 04:17:14.980
Ew.

04:17:14.980 --> 04:17:16.980
It smells bad.

04:17:16.980 --> 04:17:18.980
Is it supposed to be strawberry flavored?

04:17:18.980 --> 04:17:20.980
It has a giant V on it.

04:17:20.980 --> 04:17:22.980
For Veeler.

04:17:22.980 --> 04:17:24.980
It's a calming bad tongue as well.

04:17:28.980 --> 04:17:30.980
I found madness to break PvP,

04:17:30.980 --> 04:17:32.980
at least when I'm getting invaded.

04:17:32.980 --> 04:17:34.980
Oh, nice.

04:17:38.980 --> 04:17:40.980
Mmm.

04:17:40.980 --> 04:17:42.980
It doesn't taste good.

04:17:42.980 --> 04:17:44.980
Oh, thanks.

04:17:44.980 --> 04:17:46.980
I'm good. Oh, thank you.

04:17:52.980 --> 04:17:54.980
Damn.

04:17:54.980 --> 04:17:56.980
You write a whole fucking essay

04:17:56.980 --> 04:17:58.980
on the four agreements, bro?

04:17:58.980 --> 04:18:00.980
Jesus Christ.

04:18:00.980 --> 04:18:02.980
I just had to read it.

04:18:06.980 --> 04:18:08.980
That's okay. I don't need this.

04:18:08.980 --> 04:18:10.980
I like Stormville.

04:18:10.980 --> 04:18:12.980
I mean Stormville. I like Moonville.

04:18:12.980 --> 04:18:14.980
Sexy.

04:18:14.980 --> 04:18:16.980
I am sexy.

04:18:16.980 --> 04:18:18.980
I am sexy.

04:18:18.980 --> 04:18:20.980
What are you doing?

04:18:22.980 --> 04:18:24.980
Okay, is there a better snack in here

04:18:24.980 --> 04:18:26.980
that is actually tasty?

04:18:30.980 --> 04:18:32.980
Is this coffee?

04:18:32.980 --> 04:18:34.980
Or coffee flavored?

04:18:34.980 --> 04:18:36.980
It's like a wafer.

04:18:44.980 --> 04:18:46.980
I can't get it out.

04:18:46.980 --> 04:18:48.980
Oh.

04:18:54.980 --> 04:18:56.980
It is coffee flavored.

04:18:56.980 --> 04:18:58.980
It's actually not bad.

04:18:58.980 --> 04:19:00.980
Interesting.

04:19:02.980 --> 04:19:04.980
Kind of tweaking my mind out,

04:19:04.980 --> 04:19:06.980
because I feel like I'm drinking coffee,

04:19:08.980 --> 04:19:10.980
but I'm eating a biscuit.

04:19:16.980 --> 04:19:18.980
Brother writing a thesis.

04:19:26.980 --> 04:19:28.980
I usually don't like coffee flavored things.

04:19:28.980 --> 04:19:30.980
I just prefer to drink coffee.

04:19:46.980 --> 04:19:48.980
Lever or lever? Why?

04:20:00.980 --> 04:20:02.980
I haven't had tiramisu in a long time.

04:20:02.980 --> 04:20:04.980
Espresso mixed into chocolate

04:20:04.980 --> 04:20:06.980
goes pretty hard.

04:20:06.980 --> 04:20:08.980
I thought it was a party hard.

04:20:08.980 --> 04:20:10.980
Too bad the place I bought the front was down.

04:20:10.980 --> 04:20:12.980
Oh, that's too bad.

04:20:12.980 --> 04:20:14.980
Look at all these

04:20:14.980 --> 04:20:16.980
overgrown swords.

04:20:36.980 --> 04:20:38.980
Pickle?

04:20:38.980 --> 04:20:40.980
Aren't the flower up there?

04:20:40.980 --> 04:20:42.980
Read message.

04:20:50.980 --> 04:20:52.980
I want to roll into the fire.

04:20:52.980 --> 04:20:54.980
Let's me roll into the fire.

04:21:00.980 --> 04:21:02.980
What am I doing next?

04:21:06.980 --> 04:21:08.980
I'm sorry.

04:21:08.980 --> 04:21:10.980
I immediately turned when I saw it.

04:21:10.980 --> 04:21:12.980
It was kind of funny.

04:21:12.980 --> 04:21:14.980
I'm getting

04:21:14.980 --> 04:21:16.980
the

04:21:16.980 --> 04:21:18.980
Mogue tier.

04:21:18.980 --> 04:21:20.980
Where's the Mogue tier?

04:21:28.980 --> 04:21:30.980
I'm going to go over here and I'm going to grab that.

04:21:30.980 --> 04:21:32.980
I'm going to go to the Ertree Gazing Hill.

04:21:32.980 --> 04:21:34.980
What is this?

04:21:34.980 --> 04:21:36.980
I'm literally just taking a bite of things

04:21:36.980 --> 04:21:38.980
and then throwing it away.

04:21:38.980 --> 04:21:40.980
Why is everything like a fig Newton?

04:21:48.980 --> 04:21:50.980
What is supposed to be in the middle of this?

04:21:50.980 --> 04:21:52.980
Why is it spicy?

04:21:52.980 --> 04:21:54.980
Am I allergic?

04:22:02.980 --> 04:22:04.980
I don't think I like that.

04:22:04.980 --> 04:22:06.980
I'm covered in crumbs.

04:22:14.980 --> 04:22:16.980
No, I think I'll be good.

04:22:16.980 --> 04:22:18.980
Oh, shit. Why did I not see this before?

04:22:18.980 --> 04:22:20.980
Hello?

04:22:22.980 --> 04:22:24.980
Why did I not grab that?

04:22:26.980 --> 04:22:28.980
I think I have enough to level up.

04:22:28.980 --> 04:22:30.980
No.

04:22:30.980 --> 04:22:32.980
No, I don't.

04:22:32.980 --> 04:22:34.980
No.

04:22:34.980 --> 04:22:36.980
I know there's some in the center.

04:22:36.980 --> 04:22:38.980
Exactly, Boomi.

04:22:42.980 --> 04:22:44.980
Oh, am I allergic?

04:22:46.980 --> 04:22:48.980
No.

04:22:48.980 --> 04:22:50.980
Hi.

04:22:50.980 --> 04:22:52.980
Are you headbutting the box?

04:22:52.980 --> 04:22:54.980
What's up?

04:22:54.980 --> 04:22:56.980
Did you want it?

04:22:56.980 --> 04:22:58.980
I was going to headbutt me.

04:22:58.980 --> 04:23:00.980
You chewed this box, by the way.

04:23:00.980 --> 04:23:02.980
Oh, my main main.

04:23:02.980 --> 04:23:04.980
Oh, such a big head.

04:23:04.980 --> 04:23:06.980
Yeah.

04:23:06.980 --> 04:23:08.980
What are you chewing on the box?

04:23:08.980 --> 04:23:10.980
He's a dog.

04:23:10.980 --> 04:23:12.980
Puppy?

04:23:12.980 --> 04:23:14.980
You're a little puppy?

04:23:14.980 --> 04:23:16.980
You're a little puppy dog?

04:23:22.980 --> 04:23:24.980
Boomi, are you teasing?

04:23:24.980 --> 04:23:26.980
Baby?

04:23:30.980 --> 04:23:32.980
I actually still have Boomi's first baby tooth,

04:23:32.980 --> 04:23:34.980
just like a mom.

04:23:34.980 --> 04:23:36.980
I regret where I put it, though.

04:23:38.980 --> 04:23:40.980
Is that it?

04:23:40.980 --> 04:23:42.980
No.

04:23:42.980 --> 04:23:44.980
Welcome.

04:23:44.980 --> 04:23:46.980
Day two of stream watching.

04:23:46.980 --> 04:23:48.980
Welcome, welcome.

04:23:48.980 --> 04:23:50.980
So,

04:23:50.980 --> 04:23:52.980
let me go grab this.

04:23:52.980 --> 04:23:54.980
Here.

04:23:54.980 --> 04:23:56.980
That's all the way over there.

04:23:56.980 --> 04:23:58.980
At least I can see where the fuck I'm going.

04:24:06.980 --> 04:24:08.980
I can also

04:24:08.980 --> 04:24:10.980
kill some fire monks

04:24:10.980 --> 04:24:12.980
so I can be

04:24:12.980 --> 04:24:14.980
more resistant

04:24:14.980 --> 04:24:16.980
to fire magic myself.

04:24:16.980 --> 04:24:18.980
I might do that

04:24:18.980 --> 04:24:20.980
when I find some of my farm some fire monks.

04:24:20.980 --> 04:24:22.980
Monks? Monks?

04:24:22.980 --> 04:24:24.980
Why am I saying monks?

04:24:24.980 --> 04:24:26.980
What the fuck is wrong with me?

04:24:26.980 --> 04:24:28.980
I don't have my headphones in,

04:24:28.980 --> 04:24:30.980
so I can't tell if anything's attacking me or not.

04:24:30.980 --> 04:24:32.980
I'm not sure if the music's just changed.

04:24:32.980 --> 04:24:34.980
I should probably put my thumb in.

04:24:38.980 --> 04:24:40.980
Missed the Furpy App hour because you were asleep?

04:24:40.980 --> 04:24:42.980
No worries.

04:24:42.980 --> 04:24:44.980
We still yapping, we still having a good time.

04:24:44.980 --> 04:24:46.980
I was eating soup.

04:24:46.980 --> 04:24:48.980
You missed the soup, bro.

04:24:48.980 --> 04:24:50.980
Let's get rid of Radon's Rune or keep the Godric one.

04:24:50.980 --> 04:24:52.980
I forget what Radon's Rune does.

04:24:52.980 --> 04:24:54.980
I didn't even go to the tower for his Rune.

04:24:56.980 --> 04:24:58.980
So,

04:24:58.980 --> 04:25:00.980
let me see.

04:25:08.980 --> 04:25:10.980
Yeah, see, I can't.

04:25:10.980 --> 04:25:12.980
I haven't gotten it benedicted yet.

04:25:12.980 --> 04:25:14.980
It's best for a late game.

04:25:14.980 --> 04:25:16.980
Increases health, fp, and endurance by 10%.

04:25:18.980 --> 04:25:20.980
I hate that.

04:25:20.980 --> 04:25:22.980
It isn't just a standard status.

04:25:22.980 --> 04:25:24.980
You have to pop it, the Rune, to use it.

04:25:24.980 --> 04:25:26.980
I'll be honest with you,

04:25:26.980 --> 04:25:28.980
when I beat the game, I never even used great runes.

04:25:30.980 --> 04:25:32.980
I never factored those into my builds.

04:25:32.980 --> 04:25:34.980
I'm going the wrong way.

04:25:34.980 --> 04:25:36.980
Excuse me.

04:25:36.980 --> 04:25:38.980
I don't mind you guys educating me on great runes.

04:25:38.980 --> 04:25:40.980
Where is it?

04:25:40.980 --> 04:25:42.980
It's over here.

04:25:54.980 --> 04:25:56.980
I was some time.

04:25:56.980 --> 04:25:58.980
It was very rarely.

04:26:02.980 --> 04:26:04.980
It was a random thing rolling down the way.

04:26:06.980 --> 04:26:21.220
Let's get it honestly same bro I already grabbed the one over here oh no I didn't

04:26:21.220 --> 04:26:25.940

Are you alive? Okay. Just check me. Just check me. Hi. Oh, did you hear that?

06:25:00.740 --> 06:25:04.740
Go show me the work. I don't know.

06:25:12.740 --> 06:25:13.740
Let's see.

06:25:13.740 --> 06:25:35.740
I'll call a bit and I can change this.

06:25:35.740 --> 06:25:44.740
Oh, wait. This isn't for you. Go away.

06:26:05.740 --> 06:26:25.740
I'll call a bit and I can change this.

06:26:25.740 --> 06:26:33.740
I'll call a bit and I can change this.

06:26:33.740 --> 06:26:45.740
Stop. No. Don't be. Why are you trying to take me so much today?

06:26:45.740 --> 06:26:53.740
Turn around and move easy. You might not be able to see me. Let's put it in the microwave.

06:26:53.740 --> 06:26:56.740
Don't start jumping in the microwave.

06:27:16.740 --> 06:27:21.740
Boomi is here.

06:27:21.740 --> 06:27:26.740
Well, he wants to pull him out of Boomi. First, she be steals Boomi chicken noodles soup.

06:27:26.740 --> 06:27:29.740
Now, his mac and cheese.

06:27:29.740 --> 06:27:36.740
Oh, he does. He climbs in the cabinets. He climbs in the fridge. He climbs in my washing machine.

06:27:36.740 --> 06:27:42.740
He tries to get into the dryer, but it's stacked on top of the washing machine so you can't get to it.

06:27:42.740 --> 06:27:47.740
He tries to get into the microwave. I think he's talking to the microwave once.

06:27:47.740 --> 06:27:52.740
He's got a dishwasher where I was loading it up and I walked away for a moment.

06:27:52.740 --> 06:28:01.740
He literally has, I have to double check that he's not somewhere so I don't accidentally fucking kill him.

06:28:12.740 --> 06:28:26.740
I'm just going to feed up. I have a little next-level thing that you can feed it up and it has essential oils and stuff.

06:28:26.740 --> 06:28:32.740
So it's kind of like a relaxive... relaxive.

06:28:42.740 --> 06:29:07.740
I'm going to put a little bit of barbecue sauce on my mac and cheese and a little barbecue sauce.

06:29:07.740 --> 06:29:15.740
And you know, thankfully I have barbecue sauce because I only accommodate it to my home.

06:29:15.740 --> 06:29:27.740
It's Chick-fil-A barbecue sauce.

06:29:27.740 --> 06:29:45.740
I'm going to put a little balsamic on it, you know, a little bit of balsamic.

06:29:46.740 --> 06:30:01.740
Oh, delicious.

06:30:01.740 --> 06:30:13.740
He's talking me into buying groceries.

06:30:13.740 --> 06:30:20.740
Mmm, girl dinner. It's just what? It's just mac and cheese and a little bit of barbecue sauce on my phone.

06:30:20.740 --> 06:30:24.740
Very tasty.

06:30:24.740 --> 06:30:33.740
He's trying to bake it in the bottom.

06:30:33.740 --> 06:31:02.740
Oh, my God.

06:31:02.740 --> 06:31:10.740
My diet is condiments? No.

06:31:10.740 --> 06:31:27.740
It's very sacred to have girl dinner. Very sacred.

06:31:27.740 --> 06:31:33.740
It's very good girl dinner.

06:31:33.740 --> 06:31:40.740
You need real food that's not DoorDash? Yeah, so...

06:31:40.740 --> 06:31:47.740
I'm not sure if it's a Bible study.

06:31:47.740 --> 06:31:51.740
Girl dinner is essential.

06:31:51.740 --> 06:31:56.740
Yeah, Toma gets it.

06:31:56.740 --> 06:32:19.740
Toma has amazing girl dinners, so like she'll post her for girl dinners of the day for girl breakfast.

06:32:19.740 --> 06:32:29.740
Precisely. I'll be able to get some home cooked meals.

06:32:29.740 --> 06:32:40.740
It's funny because like I can cook, like I'm a good cook and all I just don't have any rest like materials to cook with.

06:32:40.740 --> 06:32:46.740
Oopsies.

06:32:46.740 --> 06:32:56.740
Oh, hey, my audio comes out today.

06:32:56.740 --> 06:33:17.740
Where do I get Azur's comment?

06:33:17.740 --> 06:33:25.740
My eye itches.

06:33:25.740 --> 06:33:37.740
I'll have to do Selen's quest. Is it worth it?

06:33:37.740 --> 06:33:45.740
Because I feel like, because that doesn't like stomach him. That'll be a while.

06:33:45.740 --> 06:33:49.740
No? Okay.

06:33:49.740 --> 06:34:02.740
What are your suggestions? Do you think I should really just like aim just to do bleed?

06:34:02.740 --> 06:34:15.740
Because I remember last time I beat Mogue, I literally, I just summoned somebody and they literally just whipped out Azur's comment and just fucking mowed him down.

06:34:15.740 --> 06:34:29.740
And I was like, oh, thanks, Rando. Because again, yeah, he's very slow.

06:34:29.740 --> 06:34:34.740
Yeah, give me, give me some just because I still have one slot.

06:34:34.740 --> 06:34:39.740
I have a slot, a memory slot. I'm cracking it back.

06:34:39.740 --> 06:34:47.740
Ah, there it is. Ah, there it is again.

06:34:47.740 --> 06:34:50.740
That's if you're overleveled from him.

06:34:50.740 --> 06:34:56.740
No, I try to like be bosses by myself in the night. If I can't do it, then I'll summon you guys.

06:34:56.740 --> 06:35:04.740
There's no suit with dead. I just teared and commented him too, but you need to be quite leveled. Okay.

06:35:04.740 --> 06:35:14.740
Nice crack. I'll look at my butt. I'm kidding. I'm looking at my boobs. I'm kidding.

06:35:14.740 --> 06:35:24.740
I'm getting a really bad pain in my lower back. I feel like I need to like stand up.

06:35:24.740 --> 06:35:34.740
I'm going to put my pants down so I can lift this heat on my back. Oh, that feels so good.

06:35:34.740 --> 06:35:36.740
Ah, my back hurts too.

06:35:36.740 --> 06:35:40.740
Sorry, again, I'm a 52 year old woman. Sorry, 56 year old woman.

06:35:40.740 --> 06:35:45.740
So it's very hard to live.

06:35:45.740 --> 06:35:48.740
I'm getting dialysis on my ass.

06:35:48.740 --> 06:35:51.740
Sorry.

06:35:51.740 --> 06:35:56.740
And the breasts are out of strength on the screen. How's that?

06:35:56.740 --> 06:36:03.740
Good. Torture y'all.

06:36:03.740 --> 06:36:10.740
Tell me, did you just steal her spring? Are you bringing it to me? Do you want me to throw it? Okay, drop it.

06:36:10.740 --> 06:36:12.740
Oh, thank you.

06:36:12.740 --> 06:36:13.740
Ready?

06:36:13.740 --> 06:36:18.740
We're getting it.

06:36:18.740 --> 06:36:25.740
Brother, did you get it? Okay, bring it back. Bring it back.

06:36:25.740 --> 06:36:30.740
Nope, bring it back. Boomie.

06:36:30.740 --> 06:36:36.740
You dropped it too far. Don't look at me. I'm not grabbing it.

06:36:36.740 --> 06:36:47.740
He's like looking at me like, why don't you come and pick it up and throw it again, please?

06:36:47.740 --> 06:36:52.740
Yeah, don't knock it under the closet door.

06:36:52.740 --> 06:36:59.740
This feels nice on my back.

06:36:59.740 --> 06:37:02.740
This is only 26.

06:37:02.740 --> 06:37:07.740
I know it requires a lot, but we're literally about to start farming.

06:37:07.740 --> 06:37:17.740
I'm probably going to go get some arrows so I can farm that bird.

06:37:17.740 --> 06:37:29.740
A question, though. Did they patch the farm where you're still where Mogwin's Castle is?

06:37:29.740 --> 06:37:43.740
And you kind of like go through these rocks and you go through this cave and then you jump down and then you just swing and dagger back and forth and then you just farm?

06:37:43.740 --> 06:37:48.740
Did they patch that? Did you just fall through the map?

06:37:48.740 --> 06:37:52.740
Did the bird farm still work? Okay.

06:37:52.740 --> 06:38:01.740
I remember doing that, you know, farm for a bit because you got more, I believe, in the bird farm.

06:38:01.740 --> 06:38:06.740
All right.

06:38:06.740 --> 06:38:14.740
Oh, Toma just went live.

06:38:14.740 --> 06:38:26.740
What is it called? She goes off?

06:38:26.740 --> 06:38:31.740
There it is, also, live because it's age.

06:38:31.740 --> 06:38:34.740
Toma, I know where it is.

06:38:34.740 --> 06:38:36.740
I need a heart.

06:38:36.740 --> 06:38:43.740
You!

06:38:43.740 --> 06:38:48.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:40:01.740 --> 06:40:04.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:40:31.740 --> 06:40:34.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:41:01.740 --> 06:41:04.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:41:31.740 --> 06:41:34.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:42:01.740 --> 06:42:04.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:42:31.740 --> 06:42:34.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:43:01.740 --> 06:43:04.740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

06:43:31.740 --> 06:43:38.740
Okay, hi. Sorry.

06:43:38.740 --> 06:43:42.740
I got distracted because I don't know what to do with you.

06:43:42.740 --> 06:43:45.740
It's funny.

06:43:45.740 --> 06:43:50.740
I don't know if you're okay with me bringing it back, but I'm just sitting here.

06:43:50.740 --> 06:44:00.740
I really wish I had ice cream.

06:44:00.740 --> 06:44:05.740
Did I already talk about ice cream today? Do I now want ice cream?

06:44:05.740 --> 06:44:09.740
I'm not going to be my appetite screen back all the time.

06:44:21.740 --> 06:44:24.740
How are you guys doing? Are you guys okay?

06:44:24.740 --> 06:44:28.740
He's falling asleep from the dead silence and then he's like, hey guys.

06:44:28.740 --> 06:44:30.740
You get an EP?

06:44:30.740 --> 06:44:34.740
You could have gotten an ice cream when you buy groceries.

06:44:34.740 --> 06:44:38.740
I'm a bit EP too.

06:44:38.740 --> 06:44:44.740
I can't believe I've been streaming for almost eight hours.

06:44:44.740 --> 06:44:46.740
Oh.

06:44:46.740 --> 06:44:49.740
Look, there's also makeup.

06:44:49.740 --> 06:44:53.740
Okay.

06:44:53.740 --> 06:44:56.740
You don't need it.

06:44:56.740 --> 06:44:58.740
Okay.

06:44:58.740 --> 06:45:00.740
Okay, okay.

06:45:06.740 --> 06:45:08.740
Hi.

06:45:08.740 --> 06:45:10.740
Hi.

06:45:15.740 --> 06:45:17.740
Hi.

06:45:26.740 --> 06:45:29.740
Sorry, am I leaving?

06:45:29.740 --> 06:45:34.740
I've been sitting down for a real long time.

06:45:37.740 --> 06:45:39.740
Hello.

06:45:44.740 --> 06:45:46.740
Being back.

06:45:46.740 --> 06:45:48.740
Super EP.

06:45:48.740 --> 06:45:50.740
12.15. Time for sleep.

06:45:50.740 --> 06:45:55.740
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Good night everybody that's going to sleep.

06:45:55.740 --> 06:45:57.740
Good night.

06:45:57.740 --> 06:45:59.740
Sleep tight.

06:45:59.740 --> 06:46:02.740
Don't let the madam bite.

06:46:02.740 --> 06:46:07.740
Because I will and he'll be very, very hard.

06:46:14.740 --> 06:46:19.740
I'm working while the stream is on.

06:46:19.740 --> 06:46:22.740
I don't know why this is so scary.

06:46:22.740 --> 06:46:24.740
Proof.

06:46:24.740 --> 06:46:26.740
Proof.

06:46:26.740 --> 06:46:28.740
Proof.

06:46:28.740 --> 06:46:30.740
Proof.

06:46:30.740 --> 06:46:32.740
Proof.

06:46:32.740 --> 06:46:34.740
Proof.

06:46:34.740 --> 06:46:36.740
Proof.

06:46:36.740 --> 06:46:38.740
Proof.

06:46:38.740 --> 06:46:44.740
Watch that voice. This is top scare.

06:46:44.740 --> 06:46:49.740
Pro controversial madam.

06:46:49.740 --> 06:46:51.740
Bye everybody. Have a good night.

06:46:53.740 --> 06:46:56.740
Thank you for stopping by.

06:46:56.740 --> 06:47:04.740
If you guys got stuff to do, make sure you go do it.

06:47:04.740 --> 06:47:07.740
If you have chores to do, make sure you.

06:47:07.740 --> 06:47:15.540
public. Did your, did your peepee jump? Did your bible jump up in joy? Sorry, that's

06:47:15.540 --> 06:47:32.340
my, um, hair leaning back in it. Giving yourself the ol' hawk to look? My house? Nice, nice.

06:47:32.340 --> 06:47:37.340
8-18 for me. Good for another 4-6 hours. Uh, no, I'm gonna just keep playing.

06:47:37.340 --> 06:47:41.340
Talk to my brother like that. Man, like, leg needs to pop and I can't pop it.

06:47:41.340 --> 06:47:45.340
Okay, pop it.

06:47:48.340 --> 06:47:52.340
Selling your torch yesterday or should I be a mistake? Did I miss your left or dead club?

06:47:52.340 --> 06:47:54.340
That was good. That was a really fun collab.

06:47:56.340 --> 06:47:57.340
Make sure you watch the void.

06:48:02.340 --> 06:48:07.340
I say my bible says so, do you say that? Hee hee hee. Hee hee hee, hoo hoo hoo.

06:48:09.340 --> 06:48:12.340
Alright, where am I?

06:48:15.340 --> 06:48:19.340
Look, I'm at my pillow, at my blinky.

06:48:20.340 --> 06:48:26.340
Let me fix my model. I haven't looked at OBS this entire time, so I, I apologize if my

06:48:26.340 --> 06:48:28.340
model's like, far the fuck away.

06:48:28.340 --> 06:48:35.340
Okay, um, let me grab that. Let me do that.

06:48:38.340 --> 06:48:40.340
Lean back.

06:48:40.340 --> 06:48:42.340
Make myself a little bit bigger.

06:48:46.340 --> 06:48:49.340
I'm close. By my clouds.

06:48:59.340 --> 06:49:05.340
Should we talk for over 4 hours after? Yeah, I know, it's not the same.

06:49:05.340 --> 06:49:10.340
Danielson says, I know, they fucking took out Azura, like, what the hell?

06:49:12.340 --> 06:49:17.340
Yeah, I was, I was surprised I kept talking, because I literally was gonna end stream right after

06:49:17.340 --> 06:49:23.340
the collab and like, go like, fuck about or whatever. And then, um, what was it?

06:49:23.340 --> 06:49:26.340
Then Azura's like, oh, I think I might talk to my chat and like say bye and everything.

06:49:26.340 --> 06:49:28.340
I'm like, oh, actually, I should do that too.

06:49:28.340 --> 06:49:31.340
And talk to you guys about, like, that I'll be leaving for a little bit.

06:49:31.340 --> 06:49:35.340
Um, and then I just talk for 4 hours.

06:49:37.340 --> 06:49:39.340
Lipsies.

06:49:39.340 --> 06:49:41.340
Oopsie-doopsies.

06:49:42.340 --> 06:49:44.340
Aw, I hope you feel better.

06:49:44.340 --> 06:49:46.340
I'm sorry I'm in pain too.

06:49:50.340 --> 06:49:53.340
I almost paid, I know, you guys almost got me to talk another 30 minutes.

06:49:54.340 --> 06:49:59.340
It's not happening again, I still want to watch a boys episode.

06:50:06.340 --> 06:50:08.340
Oh la la la la la.

06:50:09.340 --> 06:50:11.340
How long have I been streaming for?

06:50:12.340 --> 06:50:14.340
Let's see.

06:50:16.340 --> 06:50:21.340
I just feel like it's been more than 8 hours.

06:50:23.340 --> 06:50:25.340
Um, goes by, would you have a phone?

06:50:25.340 --> 06:50:27.340
Oh wait, now I can see the chat.

06:50:29.340 --> 06:50:31.340
I do love the app streams.

06:50:31.340 --> 06:50:33.340
I love the app in two guys.

06:50:33.340 --> 06:50:35.340
Instructions.

06:50:37.340 --> 06:50:39.340
You have that effect.

06:50:41.340 --> 06:50:43.340
Ow, my knee.

06:50:43.340 --> 06:50:45.340
Uh, I just hit my knee.

06:50:45.340 --> 06:50:47.340
The app love.

06:50:47.340 --> 06:50:49.340
Live, live the app love.

06:50:49.340 --> 06:50:52.340
That was a beautiful shot you guys were able to see.

06:50:52.340 --> 06:50:55.340
Just people just like hanging out, you know, just chilling.

06:50:55.340 --> 06:51:02.340
I always love the compare, like the similarities between this and like Christ on the cross.

06:51:02.340 --> 06:51:06.340
And then it's like Merica, because Merica is like Christ essentially and God.

06:51:06.340 --> 06:51:12.340
It's very interesting to me, the parallels, the biblical stuff in this game.

06:51:16.340 --> 06:51:18.340
What's my runes?

06:51:18.340 --> 06:51:20.340
What the hell?

06:51:28.340 --> 06:51:31.340
Can I pick them up please? Jesus Christ.

06:51:40.340 --> 06:51:42.340
What am I doing now?

06:51:43.340 --> 06:51:45.340
Cool.

06:51:46.340 --> 06:51:52.340
Oh yeah, I'm going to West of Gaitown.

06:52:04.340 --> 06:52:06.340
Over here, isn't it?

06:52:07.340 --> 06:52:13.340
I don't know why I closed it out.

06:52:21.340 --> 06:52:26.340
I kind of felt Christian fiction is a Jesus thing and not just a cruel way to kill people invented by the Romans.

06:52:26.340 --> 06:52:31.340
Well it was, like if Jesus was the only one that was crucified, they would do that to just normal people.

06:52:32.340 --> 06:52:38.340
It's really funny because it's like, I think they discovered they never put them on crosses,

06:52:38.340 --> 06:52:43.340
but it was just like a giant stake in the ground where you're pinned up above your head and below your legs.

06:52:46.340 --> 06:52:48.340
The south of the marker?

06:52:50.340 --> 06:52:52.340
Below this?

06:52:54.340 --> 06:52:56.340
I think you're right.

06:53:01.340 --> 06:53:04.340
Yeah, the random dude who's just like, I'm hanging out.

06:53:04.340 --> 06:53:09.340
He's just like, ah, you'll be with me in heaven in paradise.

06:53:12.340 --> 06:53:16.340
Although, again, different translations.

06:53:16.340 --> 06:53:18.340
Sorry, excuse me.

06:53:20.340 --> 06:53:22.340
Oh yes, the temple fortah.

06:53:28.340 --> 06:53:30.340
Yeah, that's a lot.

06:53:31.340 --> 06:53:40.340
Oh, fuck that I got all over here.

06:53:49.340 --> 06:53:51.340
I need to get a better vantage point.

06:53:55.340 --> 06:53:56.340
Alright.

06:54:01.340 --> 06:54:03.340
Let's go.

06:54:11.340 --> 06:54:13.340
Damn, that horse can jump.

06:54:14.340 --> 06:54:18.340
Yeah, I remember I grew up reading the King James version of the Bible.

06:54:22.340 --> 06:54:25.340
You want to go to the next island to the south on the map?

06:54:25.340 --> 06:54:27.340
Over there?

06:54:28.340 --> 06:54:30.340
That one?

06:54:32.340 --> 06:54:34.340
That's not the south, is it?

06:54:35.340 --> 06:54:37.340
That's the west.

06:54:38.340 --> 06:54:40.340
Over there?

06:54:40.340 --> 06:54:42.340
I think that's it straight ahead.

06:54:43.340 --> 06:54:45.340
Yeah.

06:55:01.340 --> 06:55:03.340
Okay.

06:55:08.340 --> 06:55:12.340
Let me go get my fucking...

06:55:16.340 --> 06:55:18.340
That was weird, where are they?

06:55:32.340 --> 06:55:34.340
Thank you.

06:55:38.340 --> 06:55:40.340
That was odd.

06:55:40.340 --> 06:55:42.340
Oh, no ice.

06:55:42.340 --> 06:55:47.340
I died there, but you know, go off, sis, I suppose.

06:55:47.340 --> 06:55:51.340
I guess I won't go down that particular way, because it just killed me.

06:55:51.340 --> 06:55:57.340
So just step out right here and land properly.

06:55:57.340 --> 06:56:00.340
Right here, and land properly.

06:56:27.340 --> 06:56:36.340
Sorry if you can hear Fiamme yelling to herself in the background, she's playing.

06:56:43.340 --> 06:56:45.340
Bari, where the fuck are you, bro?

06:56:45.340 --> 06:56:47.340
There you are.

06:56:47.340 --> 06:56:49.340
You are...

06:56:49.340 --> 06:56:51.340
You look like a woman.

06:56:51.340 --> 06:56:53.340
You look like a very comely woman.

06:56:53.340 --> 06:56:55.340
What's up with that?

06:56:58.340 --> 06:57:00.340
Thank you.

06:57:00.340 --> 06:57:02.340
Did I sneeze again?

06:57:02.340 --> 06:57:04.340
I don't remember.

06:57:11.340 --> 06:57:13.340
They didn't seem right.

06:57:15.340 --> 06:57:17.340
They look gross and sickly.

06:57:19.340 --> 06:57:21.340
We come through the maid in himself.

06:57:23.340 --> 06:57:25.340
Why are you covered in blood?

06:57:25.340 --> 06:57:27.340
Why are you covered in blood?

06:57:31.340 --> 06:57:33.340
Fari's the baddest.

06:57:33.340 --> 06:57:35.340
Baddest of them all.

06:57:35.340 --> 06:57:39.340
Ooh, you wanna dance, baby?

06:57:39.340 --> 06:57:41.340
Oh.

06:57:41.340 --> 06:57:44.340
It's had a really bad burp.

06:57:44.340 --> 06:57:56.340
I wonder what happens if, like, you say, I think they're awesome.

06:57:59.340 --> 06:58:01.340
Wow.

06:58:15.340 --> 06:58:19.340
All right.

06:58:34.340 --> 06:58:37.340
I don't really feel like I'm meeting a random person.

06:58:38.340 --> 06:58:40.340
Um...

06:58:43.340 --> 06:58:46.340
I forget how do you do this without...

06:58:48.340 --> 06:58:53.340
I rather do the P-W-E. I'm online, so if I go...

06:58:53.340 --> 06:58:55.340
Okay.

06:58:55.340 --> 06:58:57.340
I don't know why I'm here.

06:58:57.340 --> 06:58:59.340
Ah, I'm stuck.

06:59:03.340 --> 06:59:05.340
I don't know why I clicked that.

06:59:05.340 --> 06:59:07.340
I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it.

06:59:07.340 --> 06:59:09.340
Um...

06:59:11.340 --> 06:59:13.340
Okay.

06:59:13.340 --> 06:59:15.340
I don't know why I clicked that.

06:59:15.340 --> 06:59:17.340
I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it.

06:59:17.340 --> 06:59:19.340
Um...

06:59:20.340 --> 06:59:24.340
Yeah, don't you have to be in offline mode?

06:59:24.340 --> 06:59:26.340
Uh, let's do it.

06:59:26.340 --> 06:59:29.340
Oh, I didn't mean to fucking press that.

06:59:29.340 --> 06:59:31.340
It's fine.

06:59:38.340 --> 06:59:40.340
What?

06:59:49.340 --> 06:59:51.340
What?

06:59:59.340 --> 07:00:01.340
I'm offline.

07:00:01.340 --> 07:00:03.340
What?

07:00:16.340 --> 07:00:18.340
Is it working?

07:00:26.340 --> 07:00:29.340
I forgot to inform you we're still alive.

07:00:29.340 --> 07:00:31.340
Shit.

07:00:44.340 --> 07:00:46.340
What do you mean?

07:00:46.340 --> 07:00:48.340
First Mount Gelmer Bridge Grace?

07:00:48.340 --> 07:00:50.340
What do you mean?

07:00:50.340 --> 07:00:52.340
Press any button.

07:00:52.340 --> 07:00:54.340
Continue.

07:00:55.340 --> 07:00:58.340
You don't have to be offline, though.

07:00:58.340 --> 07:01:00.340
I've beaten it offline.

07:01:02.340 --> 07:01:05.340
Because you just fight the random NPCs.

07:01:07.340 --> 07:01:09.340
The fuck off.

07:01:09.340 --> 07:01:11.340
I was running in the wrong direction.

07:01:11.340 --> 07:01:13.340
Hi!

07:01:24.340 --> 07:01:26.340
What?

07:01:30.340 --> 07:01:33.340
But I've done it without invading someone before.

07:01:33.340 --> 07:01:35.340
Why isn't it letting me do it?

07:01:39.340 --> 07:01:42.340
There's an NPC I could just kill in the white blood ruins.

07:01:42.340 --> 07:01:44.340
That's an...

07:01:44.340 --> 07:01:46.340
You said the Altus Watto?

07:01:55.340 --> 07:01:57.340
Okay.

07:01:57.340 --> 07:01:59.340
White blood ruins.

07:01:59.340 --> 07:02:01.340
My eyes fucking twitching.

07:02:04.340 --> 07:02:06.340
Quick! Google search!

07:02:16.340 --> 07:02:18.340
It's writhed blood, by the way.

07:02:18.340 --> 07:02:20.340
It's not white blood.

07:02:25.340 --> 07:02:27.340
Why are they so small?

07:02:44.340 --> 07:02:47.340
Better do it than she being Google.

07:02:47.340 --> 07:02:49.340
Me and you.

07:02:55.340 --> 07:02:57.340
Who made you do this?

07:02:57.340 --> 07:02:59.340
You're spreading under the couch.

07:02:59.340 --> 07:03:01.340
I think you just did.

07:03:01.340 --> 07:03:03.340
I think you just did.

07:03:22.340 --> 07:03:24.340
Ooh, what this blood grease?

07:03:31.340 --> 07:03:33.340
Spring or cry?

07:03:33.340 --> 07:03:35.340
I literally just got them four springs

07:03:35.340 --> 07:03:37.340
from out from under my...

07:03:37.340 --> 07:03:39.340
They? Fire monks?

07:03:39.340 --> 07:03:41.340
No.

07:03:41.340 --> 07:03:43.340
Out from under...

07:03:43.340 --> 07:03:45.340
my fridge, so...

07:03:46.340 --> 07:03:48.340
Alright.

07:03:48.340 --> 07:03:50.340
Where are you at?

07:03:56.340 --> 07:03:58.340
Fucking dogs.

07:03:58.340 --> 07:04:00.340
Oh, what's this?

07:04:00.340 --> 07:04:02.340
Oh, my God.

07:04:02.340 --> 07:04:04.340
Oh, I'm s- I have them in the wrong thing.

07:04:04.340 --> 07:04:06.340
Oh, no.

07:04:06.340 --> 07:04:08.340
Hold on.

07:04:09.340 --> 07:04:11.340
I forgot I had them in the wrong...

07:04:25.340 --> 07:04:27.340
May what?

07:04:28.340 --> 07:04:30.340
Oh, no. What the fuck?

07:04:30.340 --> 07:04:32.340
I was confused.

07:04:37.340 --> 07:04:39.340
Should be an invasion sign?

07:04:39.340 --> 07:04:41.340
Oh, okay.

07:04:47.340 --> 07:04:49.340
I thought I did this all before.

07:04:49.340 --> 07:04:51.340
I just don't fucking remember shit.

07:04:57.340 --> 07:04:59.340
Hmm.

07:04:59.340 --> 07:05:01.340
What are you eating in that one?

07:05:07.340 --> 07:05:09.340
Fucking dogs!

07:05:11.340 --> 07:05:13.340
Oh, you fucking puppy!

07:05:20.340 --> 07:05:22.340
Flashes.

07:05:23.340 --> 07:05:25.340
Actually, I'm gonna kill these fucking dogs

07:05:25.340 --> 07:05:27.340
before I do anything.

07:05:37.340 --> 07:05:38.340
Oh, what the hell?

07:05:38.340 --> 07:05:39.340
I'm gonna kill them all

07:05:39.340 --> 07:05:42.340
because it did the little indication that I did.

07:05:44.340 --> 07:05:46.340
Anyone else?

07:05:46.340 --> 07:05:48.340
Anyone else?

07:05:48.340 --> 07:05:50.340
Alright.

07:05:56.340 --> 07:05:58.340
I should fold this guy.

07:06:02.340 --> 07:06:04.340
He is running at me.

07:06:04.340 --> 07:06:06.340
Jesus.

07:06:07.340 --> 07:06:09.340
Yeah, I fucking understand.

07:06:09.340 --> 07:06:11.340
Oh, God.

07:06:11.340 --> 07:06:13.340
Jesus, stop using beast magic on me.

07:06:25.340 --> 07:06:27.340
Oh, I didn't mean to hit that.

07:06:30.340 --> 07:06:32.340
Oh, let's not die.

07:06:33.340 --> 07:06:35.340
Oh, I forgot you only have limited shit.

07:06:35.340 --> 07:06:37.340
I totally forgot about that.

07:06:43.340 --> 07:06:45.340
I totally forgot about this thing.

07:06:45.340 --> 07:06:47.340
I totally forgot about this thing.

07:07:03.340 --> 07:07:05.340
Sorry, bro.

07:07:12.340 --> 07:07:14.340
You can revert the eyes

07:07:14.340 --> 07:07:16.340
in the mirror in the wrong table.

07:07:16.340 --> 07:07:18.340
What?

07:07:18.340 --> 07:07:20.340
The other, the bloody finger quest

07:07:20.340 --> 07:07:22.340
gives you character weird eyes.

07:07:24.340 --> 07:07:26.340
Oh!

07:07:26.340 --> 07:07:29.340
You've ruined your fashion souls, Bill.

07:07:29.340 --> 07:07:31.340
That's funny.

07:07:31.340 --> 07:07:32.340
I forgot.

07:07:32.340 --> 07:07:34.340
Yeah, they get like, I left them

07:07:34.340 --> 07:07:36.340
because I thought they looked cool.

07:07:36.340 --> 07:07:38.340
Shibu Pro Gamer?

07:07:38.340 --> 07:07:40.340
I don't know about that.

07:07:40.340 --> 07:07:42.340
Yeah, it makes your eyes fucking weird looking.

07:07:42.340 --> 07:07:44.340
I liked it, though, because my character had

07:07:44.340 --> 07:07:46.340
really pale gray skin and platinum white hair.

07:07:46.340 --> 07:07:48.340
So it was cool.

07:07:48.340 --> 07:07:50.340
Yeah, I'm happy I killed them

07:07:50.340 --> 07:07:52.340
because then they can't just fucking attack me

07:07:52.340 --> 07:07:54.340
when I'm standing here.

07:07:54.340 --> 07:07:56.340
It makes you a star.

07:07:58.340 --> 07:08:00.340
So, yeah, I like the frenzy frame.

07:08:00.340 --> 07:08:02.340
It makes your eyes like crazy gold,

07:08:02.340 --> 07:08:04.340
orangey shit, and I always like that.

07:08:08.340 --> 07:08:10.340
Who was talking?

07:08:12.340 --> 07:08:14.340
I don't know.

07:08:16.340 --> 07:08:18.340
I hear someone like deeply breathing.

07:08:18.340 --> 07:08:20.340
What the fuck is that?

07:08:40.340 --> 07:08:42.340
What the fuck is that?

07:08:48.340 --> 07:08:50.340
Become a witcher.

07:08:52.340 --> 07:08:54.340
The ucky burn marks aren't a good point.

07:08:56.340 --> 07:08:58.340
Sorry, I'll stop breathing.

07:08:58.340 --> 07:09:00.340
What is your name?

07:09:00.340 --> 07:09:02.340
Oh, you have a dog nearby?

07:09:02.340 --> 07:09:04.340
I don't think that's what dogs sound like.

07:09:14.340 --> 07:09:16.340
It sounds like there's a troll below me

07:09:16.340 --> 07:09:18.340
laughing.

07:09:18.340 --> 07:09:20.340
Oh, it is like dogs.

07:09:20.340 --> 07:09:22.340
What the fuck are those?

07:09:22.340 --> 07:09:24.340
Oh, it's like the Blight dogs.

07:09:26.340 --> 07:09:28.340
That's terrifying.

07:09:28.340 --> 07:09:30.340
I'm like, what the hell is that noise?

07:09:30.340 --> 07:09:32.340
The worm face, bros.

07:09:32.340 --> 07:09:34.340
Alright, where's the next one?

07:09:34.340 --> 07:09:36.340
Point me in the right direction.

07:09:36.340 --> 07:09:38.340
I'll fuck him up.

07:09:38.340 --> 07:09:40.340
I'll fuck him up.

07:09:40.340 --> 07:09:42.340
I'll fuck him up.

07:09:42.340 --> 07:09:44.340
I'll blow him up.

07:09:46.340 --> 07:09:48.340
Uh oh.

07:09:50.340 --> 07:09:52.340
It's like that slog that goes

07:09:54.340 --> 07:09:56.340
really like 10 miles an hour

07:09:56.340 --> 07:09:58.340
or whatever the heck

07:09:58.340 --> 07:10:00.340
towards your location.

07:10:00.340 --> 07:10:02.340
But you never know when it's coming

07:10:02.340 --> 07:10:04.340
and it's just one of those fucking things.

07:10:08.340 --> 07:10:10.340
They might want the Patreon link.

07:10:12.340 --> 07:10:14.340
Patreon link is in the description below, guys.

07:10:14.340 --> 07:10:16.340
Oh, check out my new audio. It's coming out tonight.

07:10:16.340 --> 07:10:18.340
I'll figure out which one it is.

07:10:20.340 --> 07:10:22.340
Wait, hold on. I'll tell you right now.

07:10:38.340 --> 07:10:40.340
The inevitable snail, precisely.

07:10:40.340 --> 07:10:42.340
I don't know.

07:10:42.340 --> 07:10:44.340
I don't know, because like it

07:10:44.340 --> 07:10:46.340
management puts it up or like

07:10:46.340 --> 07:10:48.340
strongly schedules it, so I don't

07:10:48.340 --> 07:10:50.340
know exactly.

07:10:50.340 --> 07:10:52.340
Put her down?

07:10:52.340 --> 07:10:54.340
Okay, it's supposed to start loading right now.

07:10:54.340 --> 07:10:56.340
I thought it was suspended for a second.

07:10:56.340 --> 07:10:58.340
I was like, yay.

07:11:04.340 --> 07:11:06.340
Oh.

07:11:10.340 --> 07:11:12.340
Okay.

07:11:16.340 --> 07:11:18.340
There is a schedule.

07:11:22.340 --> 07:11:24.340
Okay.

07:11:24.340 --> 07:11:26.340
What day is it?

07:11:26.340 --> 07:11:28.340
What weekend is it?

07:11:30.340 --> 07:11:32.340
GFTSU, their impressive milk collection.

07:11:32.340 --> 07:11:34.340
GFTSU is actually into

07:11:34.340 --> 07:11:36.340
awesome female superiors,

07:11:36.340 --> 07:11:38.340
but it sounds like that makes me feel good.

07:11:56.340 --> 07:11:58.340
I'm strawing the techie behind the girls.

07:11:58.340 --> 07:12:00.340
Uh, yeah.

07:12:00.340 --> 07:12:02.340
Sure.

07:12:16.340 --> 07:12:18.340
Wait, guys.

07:12:18.340 --> 07:12:20.340
Where's the next one?

07:12:26.340 --> 07:12:28.340
I feel like I'm just replaying the game at a faster speed.

07:12:28.340 --> 07:12:30.340
Except I'm not

07:12:30.340 --> 07:12:32.340
faster.

07:12:32.340 --> 07:12:34.340
Am I done?

07:12:36.340 --> 07:12:38.340
I have to go top bar, right?

07:12:38.340 --> 07:12:40.340
I thought I had to kill more than one.

07:12:42.340 --> 07:12:44.340
I thought I had to kill three.

07:12:46.340 --> 07:12:48.340
It gave me away those fucking worm things.

07:12:50.340 --> 07:12:52.340
He just really wanted me to kill that one guy.

07:12:52.340 --> 07:12:54.340
I thought I had to kill that one guy.

07:12:56.340 --> 07:12:58.340
I thought I had to get some bloody maiden shit.

07:13:00.340 --> 07:13:02.340
I have to go back to

07:13:02.340 --> 07:13:04.340
that church

07:13:04.340 --> 07:13:06.340
and then dip it in the maiden's blood, probably.

07:13:08.340 --> 07:13:10.340
Where am I going?

07:13:10.340 --> 07:13:12.340
Okay, wrong way.

07:13:12.340 --> 07:13:14.340
That's where I'm going.

07:13:14.340 --> 07:13:16.340
I don't have

07:13:16.340 --> 07:13:18.340
any sense of

07:13:18.340 --> 07:13:20.340
direction.

07:13:20.340 --> 07:13:22.340
That's the next step? Okay.

07:13:26.340 --> 07:13:28.340
Blood lady.

07:13:30.340 --> 07:13:32.340
You're fun to watch. Good luck in the DLC.

07:13:32.340 --> 07:13:34.340
Aw, thank you. Appreciate it.

07:13:34.340 --> 07:13:36.340
I'm just a goofy little goobah.

07:13:36.340 --> 07:13:38.340
Oh, it's your first super on a live stream.

07:13:38.340 --> 07:13:40.340
I popped you a super cherry.

07:13:44.340 --> 07:13:46.340
Thank you. Thank you.

07:13:46.340 --> 07:13:48.340
Hey, Leos.

07:13:48.340 --> 07:13:50.340
Hellos. Hellos.

07:13:54.340 --> 07:13:56.340
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

07:13:58.340 --> 07:14:00.340
Yeah.

07:14:00.340 --> 07:14:02.340
Yeah.

07:14:02.340 --> 07:14:04.340
Hello.

07:14:04.340 --> 07:14:06.340
Vore.

07:14:08.340 --> 07:14:10.340
Vore.

07:14:10.340 --> 07:14:12.340
I have to speak with you. There's a weird guy.

07:14:14.340 --> 07:14:16.340
Hi.

07:14:16.340 --> 07:14:18.340
Is this the guy I gotta come get me?

07:14:22.340 --> 07:14:24.340
It's so nice. Thank you.

07:14:26.340 --> 07:14:28.340
I wonder what he looks like

07:14:28.340 --> 07:14:30.340
without his mask on.

07:14:30.340 --> 07:14:32.340
Why are you rubbing your hands together like that?

07:14:34.340 --> 07:14:36.340
Aw, thank you.

07:14:38.340 --> 07:14:40.340
Yeah, I'm totally not going to kill your god.

07:14:40.340 --> 07:14:42.340
Dynasty.

07:14:48.340 --> 07:14:50.340
Because he likes Micola.

07:14:50.340 --> 07:14:52.340
He likes little...

07:14:52.340 --> 07:14:54.340
Yeah.

07:14:54.340 --> 07:14:56.340
Yeah.

07:14:56.340 --> 07:14:58.340
Yeah.

07:14:58.340 --> 07:15:00.340
Yeah.

07:15:00.340 --> 07:15:02.340
Yeah.

07:15:02.340 --> 07:15:04.340
Yeah.

07:15:04.340 --> 07:15:06.340
Yeah.

07:15:06.340 --> 07:15:08.340
Yeah.

07:15:08.340 --> 07:15:10.340
Yeah.

07:15:10.340 --> 07:15:12.340
Who would have a...

07:15:12.340 --> 07:15:14.340
I mean, I can't say that.

07:15:18.340 --> 07:15:20.340
I thought I'd get...

07:15:20.340 --> 07:15:22.340
How'd I get the...

07:15:22.340 --> 07:15:24.340
Okay.

07:15:24.340 --> 07:15:26.340
Ermm.

07:15:32.340 --> 07:15:34.340
Yeah, it broke a long time ago.

07:15:34.340 --> 07:15:36.340
I don't know why he's breaking lately.

07:15:38.340 --> 07:15:40.340
Oh, it broke.

07:16:02.340 --> 07:16:04.340
Damn, it does not want to work.

07:16:04.340 --> 07:16:06.340
Usually, I can just refresh the...

07:16:06.340 --> 07:16:08.340
source.

07:16:12.340 --> 07:16:14.340
Does my stream die?

07:16:14.340 --> 07:16:16.340
I think I'm fine, aren't I?

07:16:16.340 --> 07:16:18.340
Did my stream die?

07:16:18.340 --> 07:16:20.340
I think I'm fine, aren't I?

07:16:30.340 --> 07:16:32.340
Yeah, this is where I just want to work.

07:16:32.340 --> 07:16:34.340
Oh, there we go.

07:16:34.340 --> 07:16:36.340
Back here.

07:16:46.340 --> 07:16:48.340
Yeah.

07:17:12.340 --> 07:17:14.340
I'm trying to fix it.

07:17:14.340 --> 07:17:16.340
Yeah, this looks gross.

07:17:16.340 --> 07:17:18.340
I have to make it look like it was before.

07:17:18.340 --> 07:17:20.340
Because I always have to generate a link.

07:17:32.340 --> 07:17:34.340
I'll put it in Comic Sans.

07:17:44.340 --> 07:17:46.340
Okay, looks a little bit wonky.

07:18:04.340 --> 07:18:06.340
It's funny, because it works.

07:18:06.340 --> 07:18:08.340
It sounds like I'm talking into a fan.

07:18:14.340 --> 07:18:16.340
Why does it sound like I'm talking into a fan?

07:18:16.340 --> 07:18:18.340
What the fuck?

07:18:22.340 --> 07:18:24.340
It's still not working.

07:18:44.340 --> 07:18:46.340
It does not want to work.

07:19:14.340 --> 07:19:16.340
Okay.

07:19:40.340 --> 07:19:42.340
It's like very delayed.

07:19:44.340 --> 07:19:46.340
Okay.

07:19:48.340 --> 07:19:50.340
That's so weird.

07:19:50.340 --> 07:19:52.340
I wonder why it's doing that.

07:20:04.340 --> 07:20:06.340
And even if there was a fan,

07:20:06.340 --> 07:20:08.340
y'all spilling eyelash,

07:20:08.340 --> 07:20:10.340
why is the microphone...

07:20:10.340 --> 07:20:12.340
Did it actually bump my...

07:20:12.340 --> 07:20:14.340
weird?

07:20:14.340 --> 07:20:16.340
Oh, it was when I was really distant.

07:20:16.340 --> 07:20:18.340
Oh, it was because I was

07:20:18.340 --> 07:20:20.340
when I lay down here.

07:20:20.340 --> 07:20:22.340
Yeah.

07:20:30.340 --> 07:20:32.340
I sound fine.

07:20:32.340 --> 07:20:34.340
Oh, that's nice.

07:20:34.340 --> 07:20:36.340
Why did nobody tell me

07:20:36.340 --> 07:20:38.340
that since I played the video

07:20:38.340 --> 07:20:40.340
to find where something was

07:20:40.340 --> 07:20:42.340
needed?

07:20:42.340 --> 07:20:44.340
Why didn't anybody tell me

07:20:44.340 --> 07:20:46.340
that I didn't turn my desktop audio

07:20:46.340 --> 07:20:48.340
back on?

07:20:50.340 --> 07:20:52.340
What's wrong with you?

07:21:04.340 --> 07:21:06.340
Because I may be.

07:21:06.340 --> 07:21:08.340
I was scared.

07:21:10.340 --> 07:21:12.340
Oh.

07:21:12.340 --> 07:21:14.340
Because my voice is cute.

07:21:30.340 --> 07:21:32.340
You could hear Vari, though?

07:21:32.340 --> 07:21:34.340
What?

07:21:34.340 --> 07:21:36.340
What the fuck is going on in my game sound, then?

07:21:36.340 --> 07:21:38.340
Because it was literally

07:21:38.340 --> 07:21:40.340
I had like...

07:21:42.340 --> 07:21:44.340
I had set it as off.

07:21:46.340 --> 07:21:48.340
That's weird.

07:21:48.340 --> 07:21:50.340
Why did I still have audio then?

07:21:50.340 --> 07:21:52.340
Oh, maybe it was like...

07:21:54.340 --> 07:21:56.340
I don't know. I give up.

07:21:56.340 --> 07:21:58.340
I don't care that much.

07:21:58.340 --> 07:22:00.340
It's a show that was muted for me

07:22:00.340 --> 07:22:02.340
on OBS.

07:22:02.340 --> 07:22:04.340
Okay.

07:22:04.340 --> 07:22:06.340
I don't think I'm going to be able to make chat work.

07:22:08.340 --> 07:22:10.340
Okay.

07:22:14.340 --> 07:22:16.340
Oh.

07:22:16.340 --> 07:22:18.340
Now it works.

07:22:28.340 --> 07:22:30.340
I don't know why that works,

07:22:30.340 --> 07:22:32.340
although I just kept refreshing it

07:22:32.340 --> 07:22:34.340
over and over and over again.

07:22:34.340 --> 07:22:36.340
My first jinx.

07:22:36.340 --> 07:22:38.340
My toes are cold. Come suck on them.

07:22:50.340 --> 07:22:52.340
He doesn't know that I have a maiden.

07:22:58.340 --> 07:23:00.340
Alright, let's go to...

07:23:00.340 --> 07:23:02.340
Where was it?

07:23:02.340 --> 07:23:04.340
Er...

07:23:07.340 --> 07:23:09.340
Backstreet's back.

07:23:09.340 --> 07:23:11.340
Alright.

07:23:11.340 --> 07:23:13.340
Can I just fucking...

07:23:13.340 --> 07:23:15.340
Do you want to get from Missle?

07:23:15.340 --> 07:23:17.340
Missle? Where was that?

07:23:17.340 --> 07:23:19.340
It was in Caled, wasn't it?

07:23:25.340 --> 07:23:27.340
That was near the Frenzy Village.

07:23:33.340 --> 07:23:35.340
Wasn't that up here?

07:23:35.340 --> 07:23:37.340
I'm like, where was it?

07:23:42.340 --> 07:23:44.340
Was it the Second Church of America?

07:23:47.340 --> 07:23:49.340
Was it the Ernie?

07:23:49.340 --> 07:23:51.340
Oh yeah, you're right.

07:23:51.340 --> 07:23:53.340
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

07:23:55.340 --> 07:23:57.340
The Church of inhibition?

07:24:05.340 --> 07:24:07.340
I kind of remember...

07:24:07.340 --> 07:24:09.340
I always... I always...

07:24:09.340 --> 07:24:11.340
I keep confusing the Church of inhibition

07:24:11.340 --> 07:24:13.340
where the church is, where the turtle is at.

07:24:13.340 --> 07:24:15.340
That's why.

07:24:15.340 --> 07:24:17.340
I don't know why I keep thinking the turtle is here.

07:24:21.340 --> 07:24:23.340
Thank you.

07:24:25.340 --> 07:24:27.340
It is...

07:24:29.340 --> 07:24:31.340
I wish my eye would stop twitching.

07:24:35.340 --> 07:24:37.340
Thanks for watching.

07:24:37.340 --> 07:24:39.340
I hope you enjoyed it.

07:24:42.340 --> 07:24:44.340
Okay.

07:24:47.340 --> 07:24:49.340
I'm going to...

07:24:49.340 --> 07:24:51.340
I'm going to...

07:24:51.340 --> 07:24:53.340
I'm going to...

07:24:53.340 --> 07:24:55.340
I'm going to...

07:24:55.340 --> 07:24:57.340
I'm going to...

07:24:59.340 --> 07:25:01.340
I'm going to...

07:25:01.340 --> 07:25:03.340
I'm going to...

07:25:03.340 --> 07:25:11.420
I'm surprised I accidentally ran into the little pillar that has what's-her-face on it.

07:25:11.420 --> 07:25:32.460
It was like, I'm secretly a salamander person thing area, which is another name I almost

07:25:32.460 --> 07:25:36.980
called Fia, but I'm like, I don't... I didn't like her that much. What's happening here?

07:25:36.980 --> 07:25:46.220
That guy doesn't have a head. Oh, what? What's happening? Oh, stop it. I don't like that I

07:25:46.220 --> 07:26:11.300
can get aggroed right over here. That was just really funny. I just, I always wanted to see if there

07:26:11.620 --> 07:26:40.980
was a pillow. I need another pillow. Put my arm on. I'm bothered. I didn't even know

07:26:40.980 --> 07:26:54.020
there's a fucking stake America here. Uh, yoink. Okay, do I have enough to level up? I need 16.

07:26:54.020 --> 07:27:17.860
Oh, I can get 16. I can get 16. I wish I selected two, but it's fine. Oh, damn it. I didn't mean to talk to you.

07:27:17.860 --> 07:27:23.860
Luminary Moog!

07:27:31.860 --> 07:27:35.220
Are you gonna cut off my finger when I do something for this?

07:27:48.820 --> 07:27:51.220
Sorry, hold on a moment.

07:27:51.220 --> 07:28:17.620
This looks so funny because he's not really doing anything.

07:28:22.180 --> 07:28:34.020
Luminary Moog! Off her finger.

07:28:39.220 --> 07:28:43.620
I thought he was gonna say cream. I always be like, yeah, you know, I got some sweet cream.

07:28:43.620 --> 07:28:52.580
If you do, I do say so myself. Let me go to here for a second.

07:28:56.340 --> 07:28:57.780
This is a little nasty.

07:29:02.580 --> 07:29:03.060
All right.

07:29:07.780 --> 07:29:10.900
What am I doing? Oh, it's my cat's food.

07:29:14.340 --> 07:29:18.900
Are you kidding me? I need like 50 runes.

07:29:25.540 --> 07:29:29.540
It's freedom time. I'm gonna turn the lights like a fuck suit.

07:29:29.540 --> 07:29:42.900
All he has in question, when he's coming out from somewhere, he was like, oh, and then

07:29:43.780 --> 07:29:47.460
Raina's still napping. Raina, go eat.

07:29:47.620 --> 07:29:57.620
Do you accept cat food by any chance?

07:30:06.100 --> 07:30:08.660
Did he not give me the badge yet? What do you mean the badge?

07:30:09.460 --> 07:30:13.460
Yeah.

07:30:23.540 --> 07:30:24.420
I mean the badge.

07:30:30.100 --> 07:30:33.460
Oh, yeah, you're right.

07:30:38.900 --> 07:30:41.780
Maybe I need to talk to him again. Maybe I didn't exhaust my...

07:30:46.820 --> 07:30:55.460
That's right. It's the badge. I don't know why I thought it was the bloody finger.

07:31:01.620 --> 07:31:04.420
I probably didn't exhaust the dialogue.

07:31:08.900 --> 07:31:25.380
All right. I don't have a badge.

07:31:29.380 --> 07:31:30.420
Wow.

07:31:39.300 --> 07:31:54.020
Oh, that's so crazy. Wow. Wow. Wow.

07:31:54.020 --> 07:32:10.020
He's in front of me. You must wait. I'm there. All right. Let's see if I can remember.

07:32:24.100 --> 07:32:28.020
Let's see if I can remember how to get there.

07:32:38.740 --> 07:32:41.620
It's because I had been sitting there for hours and hours.

07:32:46.180 --> 07:32:53.220
Pardon me. You guys look like you're doing well. Really nice. So happy for you. Oh, thank you.

07:32:54.980 --> 07:32:57.220
Sorry. Pardon me.

07:33:08.340 --> 07:33:09.220
He has a slug.

07:33:09.220 --> 07:33:22.900
I don't know what you guys are worshipping, but good for you.

07:33:30.740 --> 07:33:31.860
That was a big boy.

07:33:32.740 --> 07:33:37.060
Existing. You're just on the walking tip.

07:33:42.340 --> 07:33:43.060
That's there.

07:33:50.100 --> 07:33:56.260
I never get what's down here. Oh, yeah, that's right. More sanguine dudes.

07:33:56.660 --> 07:34:04.820
Oh, hey. What are you doing up here? No.

07:34:12.260 --> 07:34:13.460
Who will what this?

07:34:27.220 --> 07:34:28.820
No.

07:34:49.780 --> 07:34:51.780
Fucking hell. Oh, no.

07:34:57.220 --> 07:34:58.260
Yeah, I got the mimic.

07:35:02.740 --> 07:35:07.780
And like, it's not going to even teleport me at the grace. Yeah, okay, I gotta go back because

07:35:10.180 --> 07:35:11.780
it's annoying.

07:35:26.260 --> 07:35:35.780
Can you?

07:35:36.180 --> 07:35:53.300
Like, oh, it didn't let me spawn at the church America.

07:36:01.140 --> 07:36:02.900
So happy I got a lantern before this.

07:36:06.740 --> 07:36:26.820
Why is he so fucking fast for no reason?

07:36:27.780 --> 07:36:33.860
Oh, please.

07:36:42.660 --> 07:36:47.860
I just want to be like, oh my god. What's this?

07:36:56.820 --> 07:37:23.860
I need to be over here.

07:37:26.820 --> 07:37:37.460
What the fuck is this guy?

07:37:41.220 --> 07:37:41.860
What is this?

07:37:45.780 --> 07:37:49.460
I'm in the wrong spot. Sorry.

07:37:49.460 --> 07:37:56.900
Hold on. My ear is itchy.

07:38:05.940 --> 07:38:10.660
Oh, I don't want to do mob. I'm trying to get to the fucking... ow.

07:38:10.660 --> 07:38:18.100
I'm going to kill me with the time I get over there.

07:38:20.820 --> 07:38:27.300
Oh, I went the wrong way. I'm like, this doesn't look familiar.

07:38:40.660 --> 07:38:57.300
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to remember where it is.

07:39:10.980 --> 07:39:27.300
You know, that's where I came from. Why is this guy still aggroing me?

07:39:27.300 --> 07:39:51.940
You can't see me. I know, I need to go over here.

07:39:57.380 --> 07:40:09.140
Oh, it's fucking this way. Oh, I forgot. I know where it is.

07:40:13.620 --> 07:40:23.940
I forgot it's in the opposite direction.

07:40:27.300 --> 07:40:41.220
Nope, I'm in the wrong spot again.

07:40:44.820 --> 07:40:48.980
I'm in the wrong spot again. Yeah, because that's it.

07:40:49.780 --> 07:40:53.620
Oh, yeah, because this is where you get invaded by the fucking white masks.

07:40:54.980 --> 07:40:55.780
Oh, that's fucking...

07:41:00.980 --> 07:41:04.900
That's right.

07:41:04.900 --> 07:41:26.820
Oh, I can't use it until I... where am I going? I can drop it this way, it's fine.

07:41:26.820 --> 07:41:35.780
I remember getting there.

07:41:37.700 --> 07:41:39.780
Oh, I can't pick it up.

07:41:41.140 --> 07:41:43.460
Because you avoid the little skeletors.

07:41:44.420 --> 07:41:45.940
Yeah, go over here.

07:41:49.940 --> 07:41:52.340
I remember seeing them and being like absolutely terrified.

07:41:53.300 --> 07:41:59.780
I forget which way you go. It's not this way, because that's where you get raided.

07:42:02.020 --> 07:42:07.940
Then you cut through over here.

07:42:12.180 --> 07:42:12.900
Oh, that's a lie.

07:42:13.140 --> 07:42:15.140
Yeah.

07:42:20.580 --> 07:42:22.180
Over here, yeah, that's right.

07:42:38.180 --> 07:42:42.260
Let's go! Where the fuck did the dudes all go?

07:42:43.860 --> 07:42:54.500
Oh, they're on this down this way, I forgot.

07:43:05.060 --> 07:43:08.980
I'm surprised I'm actually doing okay at level 50. I'm not going to lie to you.

07:43:09.940 --> 07:43:16.260
Before I... I just wanted to grab this first, and I don't really care about my runes.

07:43:17.380 --> 07:43:19.380
And then I want...

07:43:24.340 --> 07:43:25.780
So, we heard that it's underground.

07:43:29.140 --> 07:43:34.580
I want to go to the round table.

07:43:39.220 --> 07:43:48.580
Oh, wrong way. I thought I almost had it.

07:43:49.460 --> 07:43:52.100
D, you destroyed. Fuck. D, it's your fault.

07:43:52.100 --> 07:43:57.700
I'm happy I didn't do that anyways. I don't have any fucking glove word.

07:44:22.340 --> 07:44:27.460
I wish I could buy glove word.

07:44:29.460 --> 07:44:31.620
You need to grind to level 140-ish? Yeah.

07:44:39.540 --> 07:44:43.380
I can't believe you doubted me. How could you, me, of all people?

07:44:44.180 --> 07:44:58.820
Well, I guess this is where we yapp together. This is the yapping portion of the stream where I grind stuff out.

07:45:04.340 --> 07:45:09.940
I don't have an eighth. I mean a seventh. God damn it. I thought I had a seven. That doesn't matter.

07:45:14.260 --> 07:45:16.260
I need to hurry. I need to hurry.

07:45:22.260 --> 07:45:25.060
Yeah, I don't know why they allow the Dung Eater just to hang out.

07:45:29.060 --> 07:45:31.060
Like he's like literally generally horrible.

07:45:43.460 --> 07:45:48.100
How do I use the Mimic?

07:45:51.780 --> 07:45:54.660
He isn't technically there. That's true, but still.

07:45:56.900 --> 07:46:02.180
Yapping portion of the can at once. The love sum. Come, Eater.

07:46:05.620 --> 07:46:07.060
Oh, did I roll into something over here?

07:46:07.060 --> 07:46:15.620
I remember someone like bowed. I remember seeing someone just like gesture,

07:46:16.500 --> 07:46:20.820
like email in front of the fucking armor. I think that was so funny. That was always funny to me.

07:46:25.060 --> 07:46:28.820
I don't know how people email when they leave a message. I never figured that out.

07:46:29.060 --> 07:46:37.620
Okay, if it's done, you don't have to worry about plumbing.

07:46:42.580 --> 07:46:46.580
I should probably buy some arrows.

07:46:46.580 --> 07:47:04.340
Oh, I have just like random shit.

07:47:04.740 --> 07:47:18.100
I need strength.

07:47:18.500 --> 07:47:32.820
That's so stupid.

07:47:38.980 --> 07:47:43.860
Still have a heavy load.

07:47:48.180 --> 07:47:52.340
Yeah, okay, I'm wearing PJs.

07:47:55.540 --> 07:47:58.980
Sore seal in two hands. You're probably right. Yeah, that's a good idea.

07:48:03.300 --> 07:48:09.860
I don't, I don't know if that'll do it though.

07:48:10.420 --> 07:48:21.620
Does the sore seal give you five?

07:48:27.460 --> 07:48:31.620
Yeah, it won't be enough.

07:48:40.420 --> 07:48:45.060
Godric room. Yeah, I got that.

07:48:47.300 --> 07:48:53.700
If I do that and I pop that, well, it's not like I don't need to use it appropriately.

07:48:53.700 --> 07:49:01.620
I just need people to just shoot it.

07:49:09.860 --> 07:49:21.620
Okay.

07:49:26.420 --> 07:49:31.620
Why can I, can I not dual wield?

07:49:31.620 --> 07:49:37.860
Yeah, let's do right that then.

07:49:44.740 --> 07:49:46.660
Can't do it in, oh, that makes sense.

07:49:51.860 --> 07:49:53.380
I'm like, where is it?

07:50:01.620 --> 07:50:23.380
I'm just stupid. I'm just gonna do this to make my life easier.

07:50:32.580 --> 07:50:47.380
What the fuck was that?

07:50:50.980 --> 07:50:53.380
Left bumper aim. Oh, that's right.

07:51:01.620 --> 07:51:13.780
Fuck, I miss.

07:51:19.300 --> 07:51:23.380
Oh my god.

07:51:23.380 --> 07:51:37.140
Yep, this will be fun. I should probably go buy arrows.

07:51:37.140 --> 07:51:46.340
What a dummy.

07:51:51.380 --> 07:51:55.700
You're the gold. Fuck, I don't want the gold scarab because I'm like, wait, usually you get more than

07:51:55.700 --> 07:51:59.220
this. Oh, where's the gold scarab?

07:52:05.780 --> 07:52:07.860
Where's the gold scarab?

07:52:10.420 --> 07:52:11.620
How am I going to eat me?

07:52:13.540 --> 07:52:22.180
In a dungeon in Caled. Oh, brother, it's, it's, it,

07:52:22.180 --> 07:52:27.700
is it that one? It's that one, right?

07:52:31.060 --> 07:52:31.940
Pretty sure it's this one.

07:52:40.980 --> 07:52:43.780
Behind the dual, yeah, it's by the crystal bitches.

07:52:44.260 --> 07:52:51.860
We're doing this first before I get the fourth talisman slot.

07:53:03.940 --> 07:53:07.380
I'm gonna have to cut across to get on the other side here.

07:53:13.860 --> 07:53:23.380
I may not fucking kill myself.

07:53:35.220 --> 07:53:39.380
It's over there. It's on the other side.

07:53:44.100 --> 07:53:51.060
I don't have the dragon barrow. Oh, this one. That's a smoldering wall.

07:53:54.980 --> 07:53:57.620
What? Isn't the dragon barrow one? That's the great bridge.

07:54:02.580 --> 07:54:05.380
I think I can make this jump.

07:54:06.100 --> 07:54:18.980
Well, I definitely can't make the jump.

07:54:23.860 --> 07:54:32.980
I wish I could just go over here and just like loop up and around. That just makes my life a lot easier.

07:54:35.460 --> 07:54:50.980
Yeah, you can raise it just a lot closer.

07:54:51.540 --> 07:55:00.580
Okay, let's do this first, just so I don't freaking kill myself for all.

07:55:05.620 --> 07:55:12.580
Let's put this bad boy away. She's, she's a little bit big.

07:55:13.220 --> 07:55:26.180
How's it hanging? That's going pretty good. I'm starting to go nonverbal because I'm EP.

07:55:26.180 --> 07:55:39.940
No, not like this.

07:55:39.940 --> 07:55:47.700
Let's not go live instead.

07:55:47.700 --> 07:55:55.860
Ha ha.

07:56:01.220 --> 07:56:03.460
He's staring at nonverbal, madam.

07:56:03.460 --> 07:56:15.220
Ha ha.

07:56:16.340 --> 07:56:17.220
Did I wake you up?

07:56:21.060 --> 07:56:22.660
No, wait, I meant to go to the last

07:56:23.540 --> 07:56:27.460
Christ visiting because it's just gonna teleport me down there. Sometimes I'd purposely throw

07:56:27.460 --> 07:56:33.700
myself off a cliff to get to a like a steak America. Yeah, because now I'm fucking down here.

07:56:42.100 --> 07:56:49.220
Wake me up. Wake me up. So save me.

07:56:58.420 --> 07:57:03.220
Come on.

07:57:15.460 --> 07:57:20.260
Madam, madam's thing is pretty. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, what's a fucking

07:57:20.580 --> 07:57:26.900
bed doll? Oh, that's a fucking sleepy lady. Where am I going? Where did you come from?

07:57:26.900 --> 07:57:30.100
Where did you go? Where did you come from? Oh my god. Where are you?

07:57:36.660 --> 07:57:40.020
I just lost 11,000 runes, bro.

07:57:50.660 --> 07:57:59.780
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:58:02.420 --> 07:58:07.060
I remember distinctly this happening before too when I was going

07:58:09.060 --> 07:58:09.860
to this part.

07:58:12.740 --> 07:58:15.700
Hi, Boomi. How can I help you handsome boy?

07:58:16.100 --> 07:58:20.980
Are they a bird up here? No.

07:58:23.140 --> 07:58:27.460
How did I not aggro the thing before? I don't get that.

07:58:33.540 --> 07:58:39.780
All right, let's just walk. How about that? Let's just walk. Oh my god, Boomi.

07:58:40.580 --> 07:58:51.540
Oh, oh my kitty. No, please. Why do you walk on my boob? You're still standing on my boobs.

07:58:52.180 --> 07:58:57.380
Oh my god. Stop. Go away.

07:59:04.420 --> 07:59:09.140
Why have you done this to me? What are you doing? I'm going to hold you like a baby.

07:59:10.740 --> 07:59:19.700
Now you're stuck with me like this in baby mode. No, don't leave me. You can't leave now.

07:59:19.700 --> 07:59:22.900
You're in baby mode. You have to be held like a little baby.

07:59:25.220 --> 07:59:33.860
And I can give you scratches. Why are you so heavy? You're like this feels like your way as much as a toddler.

07:59:34.820 --> 07:59:40.100
Why are you so big? Why did you become like that? Why are you looking at me?

07:59:41.780 --> 07:59:43.140
Why won't you make eye contact with me?

07:59:47.700 --> 07:59:52.020
He's like leaning away like mother, please. There you go.

07:59:55.700 --> 07:59:58.820
Let's look into the snack box and see what we got. Shall we, Boomi?

07:59:59.140 --> 08:00:01.700
Oh, don't attack my headphones.

08:00:03.940 --> 08:00:10.820
Where's this? Like a little biscuit. It is called Delos and it is cappuccino flavored.

08:00:13.860 --> 08:00:17.780
Boomi in baby mode. Yeah, Boomi in baby mode is literally just like holding him like he's the

08:00:17.780 --> 08:00:22.260
baby and it's like he's on his back as the leggies are sticking out.

08:00:22.580 --> 08:00:26.660
Marina and Boomi are just sniffing each other.

08:00:35.300 --> 08:00:37.220
Marina, you look like you're about to hop up here.

08:00:38.180 --> 08:00:43.140
Yeah, cappuccino.

08:00:51.780 --> 08:00:58.980
How can this happen to me and me? I'm rubbing my eyes.

08:00:59.940 --> 08:01:07.540
I'm fading. No, Marina, you're in the way.

08:01:16.740 --> 08:01:21.860
Shut up. I don't need your sass. I didn't mean to press that.

08:01:22.500 --> 08:01:26.740
Marina, get out. All I see is cat butt and a tail. Oh my god.

08:01:30.900 --> 08:01:32.340
Marina just kicked the microphone.

08:01:35.060 --> 08:01:46.740
Why are you flicking your tail? She's mad because I put her on the ground.

08:01:52.740 --> 08:01:58.740
She's like, what the fuck?

08:02:01.860 --> 08:02:02.260
All right.

08:02:07.380 --> 08:02:10.740
Berry carefully.

08:02:11.060 --> 08:02:26.260
Berry carefully. Jump. You made it.

08:02:31.860 --> 08:02:38.340
Oh, good luck. I'm sure you're, I don't have to wish you luck because I'm sure you'll pass.

08:02:38.580 --> 08:02:41.860
You don't need any luck. You got this.

08:02:44.100 --> 08:02:50.020
A different moment from switching rooms. How is she? I'm fine. I'm here. I'm in the abandoned cave.

08:02:53.140 --> 08:02:54.180
Feeling abandoned.

08:03:04.260 --> 08:03:07.300
Okay, I'm just going to run to the boss room. I think I remember where the boss room is.

08:03:08.820 --> 08:03:19.300
I remember doing the whole farm thing. It was more of the more recent things I had done in the game.

08:03:24.820 --> 08:03:35.620
All right. Nothing I need to do that. Oh, fuck. I need, I need, I forgot. I need bloodhound step.

08:03:39.300 --> 08:03:47.300
Oh, that's not the right one. Damn it.

08:03:55.300 --> 08:03:56.020
I forgot.

08:03:59.220 --> 08:04:04.500
I forgot that usually I would use just bloodhound step with this.

08:04:09.300 --> 08:04:12.180
Is it shub over? Just a little bit.

08:04:16.660 --> 08:04:21.060
I thought the staunching bowl was this for the right ones. Oh, this is going to be annoying.

08:04:22.420 --> 08:04:25.620
I'm not going to go all the way to do that.

08:04:29.380 --> 08:04:31.060
To do that, get that ash of war.

08:04:38.980 --> 08:04:44.260
Yeah, digrow the quick step. No. That's what I meant. I'm sorry.

08:04:48.820 --> 08:04:54.500
I thought I had the right boluses. I forgot. I had actually prepared for this. I didn't just jump in.

08:04:58.020 --> 08:05:01.620
Oh, no. We totally have the fungus armor. What are you talking about?

08:05:04.580 --> 08:05:06.420
I also don't have any fucking boluses.

08:05:08.340 --> 08:05:27.940
I don't have any fucking cookbooks.

08:05:31.460 --> 08:05:34.020
I suppose we're going to do a quick store run

08:05:34.980 --> 08:05:37.780
to Caled. Oh, I can't leave.

08:05:42.900 --> 08:05:45.060
At least I got the grace to care about.

08:05:47.780 --> 08:05:53.620
It's funny that you can teleport from like, whatchamacallit.

08:06:04.500 --> 08:06:10.980
Sounded like something was leaking in my bathroom. Ever get what I was saying?

08:06:14.500 --> 08:06:18.100
No, I haven't been buying cookbooks. I've just been, I haven't been doing anything.

08:06:23.220 --> 08:06:23.620
Hi.

08:06:30.020 --> 08:06:31.620
Okay, so I can get those from you.

08:06:34.020 --> 08:06:51.940
Oh, it's like I have to do so much shit in order to prepare for the fucking DLC.

08:06:51.940 --> 08:06:53.620
I should have just played through the game again.

08:06:54.580 --> 08:06:57.700
I was kidding. It'd be like a hundred hours.

08:07:06.820 --> 08:07:07.780
You want me to butterfly?

08:07:14.900 --> 08:07:18.340
Why did I do that? I didn't mean to press that. I meant to press that way.

08:07:24.580 --> 08:07:29.220
Where do you, I have Reduvia, so I do have a dagger.

08:07:30.900 --> 08:07:32.580
Oh fuck, but I can't put it on that.

08:07:35.540 --> 08:07:36.500
Jody Daggers.

08:07:41.860 --> 08:07:43.380
You don't, you're useless to me.

08:07:54.180 --> 08:08:00.420
It's a journey and that's okay. I just like, I just, that's why I was always, I didn't know

08:08:00.420 --> 08:08:06.900
whether or not I wanted to replay Elden Ring just because I'd have to do all this shit.

08:08:07.540 --> 08:08:11.060
But I'm glad. I'm actually having lots of fun spending time with you guys.

08:08:11.060 --> 08:08:24.340
I went the wrong way.

08:08:30.420 --> 08:08:31.540
I know I did it, I'm fine.

08:08:31.940 --> 08:08:38.820
Okay, Lude.

08:08:44.740 --> 08:08:48.660
This is more yapping time. Yeah, but I want to get play the DLC guys.

08:08:54.900 --> 08:08:56.820
You also don't have a dagger.

08:09:01.940 --> 08:09:13.940
I like how this negates fire, but this is, this is funny.

08:09:17.860 --> 08:09:20.820
I could get this for my outfit.

08:09:28.420 --> 08:09:28.820
Bye-bye.

08:09:31.700 --> 08:09:33.860
Lady from Round Table Shirtle Dagger, you're right.

08:09:36.740 --> 08:09:37.380
What am I doing?

08:09:42.420 --> 08:09:45.620
I placed that little cookie thing down somewhere and I don't know where it went.

08:09:46.820 --> 08:09:52.420
I like never ate it. I just placed it on the ground, or not on the ground. Did I put it back

08:09:52.420 --> 08:09:57.220
in the box? I swear I took it out. I have no idea where it went. I like put it somewhere.

08:09:57.220 --> 08:09:59.700
Oh, it was next to me. It's like right next to my butt.

08:10:00.660 --> 08:10:07.780
I'm like, I wanted to try this cappuccino cookie. Oh, it smells so good.

08:10:08.660 --> 08:10:14.100
I wish I had coffee to make to eat this with it. Wait, I do have coffee to make to eat this with it.

08:10:16.100 --> 08:10:19.460
Should I? Should I?

08:10:24.500 --> 08:10:25.940
Should I make some coffee?

08:10:30.100 --> 08:10:34.100
Hmm.

08:10:45.540 --> 08:10:48.980
Let me not do this. Let me not drink coffee

08:10:51.620 --> 08:10:54.100
at 10 p.m. because then I won't be able to sleep.

08:11:00.660 --> 08:11:01.700
Am I going the right way?

08:11:10.980 --> 08:11:14.980
I don't have any fucking money. Wait, let me see. Do you have a fucking dagger? You do. Okay.

08:11:20.500 --> 08:11:25.220
I didn't see how much it was. How much is it?

08:11:25.780 --> 08:11:32.740
400. Okay. I was about to drop 2000 for no reason.

08:11:45.220 --> 08:11:51.700
99. Sleep tight. Don't let the madam bite. Just kidding. Let me bite.

08:11:52.580 --> 08:11:57.060
I always wondered, what was this about? I never used it.

08:12:01.380 --> 08:12:04.740
This one, like I know when you raid someone, like turns you into the host,

08:12:04.740 --> 08:12:09.780
but does it like get rid of stuff? I don't know. And then this one as well.

08:12:11.940 --> 08:12:14.900
You can like just, why would you want to do that?

08:12:15.700 --> 08:12:25.540
You still look like a normal human. It's a troll item. Oh, it does get rid of your red aura?

08:12:25.540 --> 08:12:29.300
That's funny. Hi, boo-me. Hi, boo-me.

08:12:33.220 --> 08:12:35.620
Yeah, get your exercise. Nice job.

08:12:39.220 --> 08:12:42.500
So like, am I the only person that can see him because he's technically not here?

08:12:43.220 --> 08:12:48.820
But there's like just a bunch of shit in the library anyways.

08:12:51.140 --> 08:12:58.820
It's really just like, is anybody like concerned about the absolutely gore that's in this room?

08:12:58.820 --> 08:13:03.940
I'm really confused. Does nobody smell that? Yeah, it's Dungy.

08:13:04.340 --> 08:13:09.300
And this guy doesn't do anything.

08:13:12.180 --> 08:13:16.500
He just follows you around and leans against the thing and gives you a thing.

08:13:18.100 --> 08:13:23.860
Gives you a e-boat. Look at his little hand. His little hands like holding on to him.

08:13:28.740 --> 08:13:30.260
I know Rodericka can sense him.

08:13:34.740 --> 08:13:42.180
Really, only the ones I can't, nobody, do you smell that? Well, you are kind of a skeleton

08:13:42.180 --> 08:13:47.460
yourself, so maybe you don't smell that. Like, how he has that weapon as his weapon is the skeleton.

08:13:51.940 --> 08:13:55.140
Gideon doesn't know where he is. He lives right now. Yeah, I'm like, I don't,

08:13:56.260 --> 08:13:58.900
any, this whole place would smell like absolute shit.

08:13:59.460 --> 08:14:06.660
Like, I don't, it's phantom, does that look like phantom poop to you?

08:14:08.740 --> 08:14:15.700
Because like, he looks like phantom. This looks like real shit that I'm sloshing through

08:14:16.980 --> 08:14:19.460
with real flies.

08:14:19.460 --> 08:14:29.620
It's, yeah, shit and bodies.

08:14:31.860 --> 08:14:35.620
The helmet protects tarnished from smells instead of head injuries, impressive.

08:14:36.260 --> 08:14:40.020
Hiya, Boomi, what's up? Why are you trying to go for my feet?

08:14:40.980 --> 08:14:42.020
That's the chain.

08:14:47.460 --> 08:14:49.620
What? What do you want, Mr?

08:14:52.260 --> 08:14:54.100
I think my headache medications make me sick.

08:14:55.860 --> 08:14:58.020
Watch me, I've accidentally taken a Tylenol PM

08:14:59.300 --> 08:15:01.940
so that was a horrible Tylenol, because I've done that before.

08:15:06.180 --> 08:15:07.540
At least my head doesn't turn anymore.

08:15:10.580 --> 08:15:11.780
So we're going to go...

08:15:17.700 --> 08:15:19.540
Wait, where do I get quick step from?

08:15:22.260 --> 08:15:23.220
Did you take earlier?

08:15:26.500 --> 08:15:32.580
I'm 99% sure it's just normal ibuprofen. I'm just tired because I've been streaming since 130.

08:15:35.380 --> 08:15:36.900
Have you seen a single toilet this whole game?

08:15:36.900 --> 08:15:41.060
I'm pretty sure there is like an outhouse sort of thing.

08:15:42.660 --> 08:15:45.700
Boomi, what are you up to? Is there something under my computer that you want?

08:15:47.140 --> 08:15:51.620
You have a toy right there. He's just acting up.

08:15:57.300 --> 08:15:58.660
The war master shack, yeah.

08:16:00.340 --> 08:16:02.500
The dagger I just bought has quick step automatically.

08:16:05.780 --> 08:16:06.500
Am I stupid?

08:16:06.900 --> 08:16:11.380
I think I am. Anyways,

08:16:15.460 --> 08:16:22.820
back to the cave. I feel like I'm very tired and I just want to remember you also.

08:16:30.020 --> 08:16:32.820
I thought I had to get quick step.

08:16:36.900 --> 08:16:39.220
Oh, it doesn't exactly have it.

08:17:07.460 --> 08:17:16.180
That's not where I wanted to go.

08:17:19.060 --> 08:17:23.700
I forgot you should probably like dodge the shit. Oh, like so.

08:17:27.460 --> 08:17:30.740
I'm just like going through stuff. I'm not waiting for stuff to stop.

08:17:31.540 --> 08:17:39.220
The head pat emo. I know I should get a head pat emo.

08:17:46.980 --> 08:17:48.180
Oh, I keep going the wrong way.

08:17:48.180 --> 08:18:00.660
That's the area of fucking Scarlet Rock.

08:18:18.980 --> 08:18:30.660
Oh, I forgot the serpent bow is in here.

08:18:30.660 --> 08:18:43.140
Oh, sorry.

08:18:43.140 --> 08:19:00.820
I'm getting fucking terrified every time I see a

08:19:05.620 --> 08:19:08.580
maiden. It's going to go this way really quick.

08:19:08.580 --> 08:19:14.500
I don't think I went the right way. Oh, fun.

08:19:17.460 --> 08:19:19.060
Ever get? Is there a grace?

08:19:19.060 --> 08:19:32.740
No.

08:19:34.660 --> 08:19:41.140
Raina, let's not hop up on my desk right now. Okay. You don't have to chirp at me.

08:19:41.140 --> 08:19:47.140
Hi, Raina.

08:19:49.940 --> 08:19:51.140
You have eye crusties.

08:19:59.780 --> 08:20:02.580
There's a statue of America? I don't know. Is there?

08:20:02.580 --> 08:20:10.580
Oh, Raina, you are hurting me with her. No, you can't.

08:20:12.580 --> 08:20:15.460
She's like gripping my shoulders. I can't take her.

08:20:18.980 --> 08:20:23.780
You're purring so hard. Raina, I need to put you on the ground.

08:20:23.780 --> 08:20:35.380
Oh, all right. Well, I have a cat on me now. She is a cleaning baby, but I love her for that.

08:20:48.900 --> 08:20:50.340
Oh, why did I go this way?

08:20:54.740 --> 08:20:58.100
All right, tell me something. Just tell me that Boomi's going crazy right now.

08:21:04.740 --> 08:21:13.540
Time to complete it in one go? Um, sure. I didn't. It's fine. Well, I shouldn't have done that.

08:21:15.780 --> 08:21:17.940
Can you go after my other thing first?

08:21:17.940 --> 08:21:24.020
Because I did shit wrong.

08:21:28.180 --> 08:21:30.340
I accidentally gave him to the tagger.

08:21:34.500 --> 08:21:36.020
Oh, no.

08:21:36.020 --> 08:21:46.100
No. It's fine. It's fine.

08:22:06.980 --> 08:22:21.620
Damn it. I feel like I could have gone that in one go.

08:22:24.740 --> 08:22:30.100
I know I forgot to. I like walked in and I saw the dagger in my hand. I'm like, no.

08:22:30.260 --> 08:22:34.900
I'm tired. That's my excuse. I'm tired.

08:22:38.260 --> 08:22:42.740
Then I gotta do this shit. This will probably take me like one more.

08:22:45.860 --> 08:22:47.860
I kind of sworn there was like a thing down here.

08:22:50.420 --> 08:22:57.860
Come on. Come on. Come. No. Don't die. Don't die. No, don't.

08:23:00.900 --> 08:23:11.860
Oh my god.

08:23:16.660 --> 08:23:19.460
I think I need to go to bed after this.

08:23:24.180 --> 08:23:27.380
That's the wrong way. Anyways, what am I doing? What am I stuck on?

08:23:31.060 --> 08:23:35.860
Yeah.

08:23:46.740 --> 08:23:50.580
Oh, wrong way. Oh, no.

08:23:53.780 --> 08:23:56.340
Why don't you just go down? I'm gonna get poisoned.

08:23:57.300 --> 08:24:04.500
Get out of the fucking way, bro. I have cat hair in my eye and Rena on my lap.

08:24:10.660 --> 08:24:11.300
There's a rat.

08:24:18.260 --> 08:24:24.100
I don't always got bit by a rat.

08:24:27.220 --> 08:24:31.460
I don't know. I'm not just jumping over things.

08:24:33.700 --> 08:24:50.100
No. Stop. No. Stop. Can you stop, please? I don't have any boluses for that. I'm just gonna die slowly.

08:24:50.100 --> 08:24:53.860
Oh, this is great.

08:25:10.660 --> 08:25:12.340
I just think I'd win if I walked in there.

08:25:15.620 --> 08:25:17.860
I got poisoned grease.

08:25:20.100 --> 08:25:37.860
I can wait.

08:25:43.860 --> 08:25:45.860
Try to two hand the moon veil.

08:25:50.820 --> 08:25:58.020
I'm literally gonna wait until this is done. Why is poison lasting forever?

08:26:01.220 --> 08:26:11.860
I'm wondering if I should heal. Okay, then I might just heal and just go in and kill them.

08:26:12.820 --> 08:26:21.620
Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna...

08:26:21.620 --> 08:26:41.380
I call this one just like rises out of fucking nothing. You guys come over here.

08:26:51.940 --> 08:26:54.020
Yeah, this is the same damage I'm doing.

08:26:57.140 --> 08:26:59.220
Oh, I don't even think I needed him.

08:27:02.260 --> 08:27:03.700
Use your fucking sword, bro.

08:27:07.620 --> 08:27:09.140
I don't have any more. It's fine.

08:27:13.860 --> 08:27:17.380
Yeah, I didn't even need the fucking mimic. I just grabbed the mimic just in case.

08:27:22.020 --> 08:27:23.380
Oh my god, my eye hurts now.

08:27:34.500 --> 08:27:37.460
I did not need the fucking mimic to heal for that.

08:27:40.180 --> 08:27:45.140
Okay, I think it's time I go to bed. I'm still fucking poisoned.

08:27:45.300 --> 08:27:53.460
Let me... So I got the golden scarab. I'm just gonna sit myself here.

08:27:55.460 --> 08:27:57.380
I don't know why I need to get by fucking arrows.

08:28:01.060 --> 08:28:06.180
I just want to set myself up for success. I think there was arrows. He had arrows.

08:28:07.060 --> 08:28:15.620
I know it's almost over. No, it's not gonna be the perfect time. I'm not gonna be able to do this

08:28:15.620 --> 08:28:17.940
fast enough. I'm already like freaking out.

08:28:20.580 --> 08:28:25.220
Where's the dude? Oh no, where's the dude? He's over there.

08:28:27.460 --> 08:28:30.020
No, I'm so tired. I also didn't sleep last night.

08:28:36.820 --> 08:28:40.660
Hello. Hello.

08:28:45.940 --> 08:28:49.380
Yeah, I didn't fall. Well, it's not like I don't stay up. I just don't fall asleep.

08:28:52.900 --> 08:28:56.500
Those are bolts. I need arrows. It's like they know.

08:28:56.740 --> 08:29:09.540
Well, I will take all of these. Thank you kindly. I think they know that we're gonna go see Moglin.

08:29:12.740 --> 08:29:16.260
Moglin, Moglin. I don't need arrows for leveling.

08:29:21.540 --> 08:29:23.060
Do I literally have just enough?

08:29:26.980 --> 08:29:27.380
I do.

08:29:33.860 --> 08:29:34.500
That's funny.

08:29:40.740 --> 08:29:42.100
I need arrows for farming.

08:29:42.820 --> 08:29:50.820
For a hug.

08:29:57.460 --> 08:29:59.780
What? I'm so tired.

08:30:06.420 --> 08:30:07.940
Yeah, I have a serpent bow.

08:30:13.060 --> 08:30:24.180
Yeah, that's a great bow. This is normal bow. I know that the seeds are cane, but we really

08:30:24.180 --> 08:30:30.340
don't need that for that. Is that anything on? Oh my god.

08:30:36.820 --> 08:30:38.980
Fuck. I didn't equip arrows.

08:30:39.940 --> 08:30:41.220
There. Whoopsies.

08:30:44.180 --> 08:30:45.220
Nope. That's not what I want.

08:30:48.020 --> 08:30:50.180
Is it? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Hold on.

08:30:52.100 --> 08:30:52.580
Nope.

08:30:58.820 --> 08:31:04.900
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I bought normal arrows. What are you talking about?

08:31:09.460 --> 08:31:10.020
Why is it?

08:31:21.060 --> 08:31:21.780
Why wasn't it?

08:31:25.940 --> 08:31:26.580
That was weird.

08:31:31.780 --> 08:31:33.220
I forgot how to use a bow for a second.

08:31:39.140 --> 08:31:41.060
Hey, come on. Yeet.

08:31:45.140 --> 08:31:45.860
Yes, it's me.

08:31:56.580 --> 08:31:57.940
This is going to take a while.

08:32:00.420 --> 08:32:04.980
This is going to take a while. Farming for levels.

08:32:08.980 --> 08:32:18.980
I might do this actually before I go to bed.

08:32:32.180 --> 08:32:34.180
I haven't caught an icy stream yet.

08:32:35.140 --> 08:32:39.060
Is it really that down bad? I don't. What?

08:32:40.740 --> 08:32:44.820
What is the context of that question? Back to you being past the practice of the end.

08:32:44.820 --> 08:32:46.980
Thank you. Oh, good. I'm so proud.

08:32:48.980 --> 08:33:00.180
You did great, which was a mob that I don't know. I'm scream. That would be funny.

08:33:04.900 --> 08:33:10.740
No. Oh, my guts are a little bit longer.

08:33:15.460 --> 08:33:20.740
Mow dies tomorrow. The tree has a weird hitbox. I usually just, I do it when they're in between

08:33:20.740 --> 08:33:22.180
the tree. Oh.

08:33:28.420 --> 08:33:31.380
That's, this is how you know how fucking tired I am, bro.

08:33:35.140 --> 08:33:44.420
Okay, let me grab my runes. And let's look at my cute little, my cute little outfit, my cute little bow.

08:33:57.060 --> 08:34:01.700
Greenies in my arms and my eyes are itchy because I think I got like a piece of cat hair

08:34:01.700 --> 08:34:05.780
and I blame Reina. I'm going to go knock out.

08:34:08.660 --> 08:34:09.380
Hawaii.

08:34:12.500 --> 08:34:18.500
I'm asleep. I know my sleep schedule has been so bad lately, guys. I don't even mean it to be,

08:34:19.380 --> 08:34:23.860
even Boomi's coming over right now. He's like, come on. And then Reina just huffed at him.

08:34:24.980 --> 08:34:28.180
She goes, and that's this morning.

08:34:28.900 --> 08:34:44.420
We'll be right at the cause. Oh, perhaps, maybe just a little bit because I need to, I just

08:34:44.420 --> 08:34:48.820
like staying up and spending time with you. Oh, me. Save.

08:34:58.580 --> 08:35:14.340
I don't know why you don't want you to meet me. Oh, I'm like off to the side. Do I have any orders

08:35:14.340 --> 08:35:21.860
for you tonight? Sleep well. I want you to, why are you asking me to tell you to do stuff when I'm

08:35:22.180 --> 08:35:30.100
half asleep right now? I'm like, I'm falling asleep in my chair. Reina, I'm not open.

08:35:41.940 --> 08:35:46.900
I want you to get yourself a cat boy outfit and dress up as a little cat. No, I'm kidding. Please

08:35:46.900 --> 08:36:09.940
don't do that. Remember when I'm sleepy and my voice gets high?

08:36:16.900 --> 08:36:22.180
Boomi,

08:36:26.980 --> 08:36:30.340
you're planning a buying cat boy outfit. Anyway, it is for one reason.

08:36:31.220 --> 08:36:33.140
Um, I don't know. I just hope you guys sleep well.

08:36:38.740 --> 08:36:45.140
Over six hours. That's, I'm impressed with your attention span because I wouldn't be able to

08:36:45.140 --> 08:36:50.980
watch myself for six hours. Jesus Christ. Oh, but thank you guys for hanging out with me all day.

08:36:50.980 --> 08:36:56.740
Like, oh my gosh, or stopping by if you could. Um,

08:36:59.780 --> 08:37:02.340
Reina, stop being so cute with your big eyes.

08:37:02.340 --> 08:37:10.100
I wish I didn't have to work. Oh,

08:37:12.500 --> 08:37:14.740
get some rest. I will.

08:37:19.380 --> 08:37:22.820
Boomi, do you just kick glitter onto my computer?

08:37:25.700 --> 08:37:28.260
Boomi, you're gonna mess up. I'm trying to time this properly.

08:37:29.220 --> 08:37:34.980
It would be at 10, 10. She'd be marathon streamer. I don't mean to. I just like it.

08:37:38.820 --> 08:37:44.100
Errah. What's fun popping in for a bit of beginning in meow. Yeah, thank you guys for stopping by,

08:37:44.100 --> 08:37:50.740
stopping in, saying hi. And then we're stopping in, stopping by, saying hi.

08:37:50.980 --> 08:37:58.420
Oh, maybe I'll, that'll be my outro for streams. Um, can we get, can we get a pet the madam emote?

08:38:00.980 --> 08:38:06.420
No, you don't get to make demands of me. Excuse you. More Elden Ring tomorrow. Yes,

08:38:06.420 --> 08:38:12.980
I'll probably stream early again. Actually, I do have to record a special ASMR.

08:38:15.540 --> 08:38:20.180
And Boomi never, although he's finally actually laid in the bed. Like as I'm getting off,

08:38:20.180 --> 08:38:24.900
now he wants to be comfy and cute in the bed. If he did it sooner, I would have put the cat cam on.

08:38:25.620 --> 08:38:27.460
Because I like cat cam for long streams.

08:38:35.700 --> 08:38:37.860
Um, but,

08:38:44.100 --> 08:38:48.660
because I already ordered emotes, so I can't like just add another emote to it.

08:38:48.660 --> 08:38:54.020
So that'll take a while if I do that. Um, because I didn't, did I add a pat emote?

08:38:55.300 --> 08:39:02.260
I can't remember, because I had 10 emotes that I got that I could order. Um, Strani was telling me, so.

08:39:06.420 --> 08:39:09.940
I missed, I see barrier stream didn't work, so it was good to still like, yeah, yeah.

08:39:10.980 --> 08:39:13.060
Um, I'm sorry you missed your stream.

08:39:13.220 --> 08:39:21.140
Of the recording, did you forget if I have to make a cover? Yeah, covers are hard to make. I'm happy that

08:39:21.860 --> 08:39:26.500
like, Strani was pretty concise in what she wanted from us and being like, okay, do it like this.

08:39:26.500 --> 08:39:31.620
I'm like, okay. And it worked out and it sounded at least a little bit of okay.

08:39:36.340 --> 08:39:40.180
I think my bathroom fan is broken because it sounds like it's rattling.

08:39:40.180 --> 08:39:45.780
Okay. I was getting distracted by things when I'm like falling asleep in my chair.

08:39:46.420 --> 08:39:52.740
What do you have to pay to do covers? Um, like, well, we don't get like any copyright because

08:39:52.740 --> 08:40:00.740
we didn't claim copyright or like, you just, if you're okay with not getting the money, then you

08:40:00.740 --> 08:40:09.220
just like, you can go through the artist and ask for permission only if you want to monetize it.

08:40:09.220 --> 08:40:12.100
We didn't monetize any of our music videos so they can't get claimed.

08:40:15.620 --> 08:40:19.540
Yeah, no, I did not pay Ray William Johnson to sing his song.

08:40:21.540 --> 08:40:27.060
That would be very cool though, but I'm not making any money off of singing his song. So

08:40:28.020 --> 08:40:29.620
favorite line from your cover.

08:40:29.620 --> 08:40:36.100
Butter ass was looking good up in the mom jeans.

08:40:38.020 --> 08:40:42.900
Or the, or the, I approached her in the checkout line and said, oh, yeah. Oh, baby, what's up?

08:40:43.460 --> 08:40:45.300
Yo, baby, what's up? That was pretty good.

08:40:48.180 --> 08:40:53.620
Maybe the girls out. Stop. Don't look at them. Stop. Stop staring. Why are you pointing it out?

08:40:55.140 --> 08:40:57.300
Why are you pointing it out, bro? You're making it weird.

08:41:00.020 --> 08:41:02.660
Frick, it's 1012. Oh, you guys tricked me.

08:41:07.620 --> 08:41:09.780
I'm easily distracted when I'm tired.

08:41:14.260 --> 08:41:15.540
I love how my eyes glow.

08:41:22.820 --> 08:41:26.020
Don't you have to go through the music labels to get permission to monetize the music?

08:41:26.500 --> 08:41:31.700
I just said that. You have to go through the artists. If you want to monetize it,

08:41:31.700 --> 08:41:33.300
none of our stuff is monetized.

08:41:35.540 --> 08:41:38.420
Man, I will stay longer the more we talk. Shut up.

08:41:41.300 --> 08:41:43.220
Yep. 1015.

08:41:46.580 --> 08:41:50.340
Even. What's everyone doing?

08:41:50.740 --> 08:41:56.820
No, you don't have to. No, I did not. No, not like that.

08:42:00.580 --> 08:42:05.460
Tell us about the boy. No, I still have to watch the episode after this and I'm not going to make

08:42:05.460 --> 08:42:12.100
it. So I'll probably watch it tomorrow morning. I have to go grocery shopping. Maybe I will go

08:42:12.100 --> 08:42:16.340
grocery shopping just for a couple of days so I can have a couple of days worth of food instead

08:42:16.340 --> 08:42:24.900
of ordering DoorDash. I'll get some uncrossibles. Is my favorite person in the boys? None of them.

08:42:26.900 --> 08:42:30.900
I think every character has a hateable trait. Besides Kimiko.

08:42:32.180 --> 08:42:38.340
So I guess Kimiko is my least hated character. I literally just looked at the talk of the time

08:42:38.420 --> 08:42:41.940
because I'm like, it's a 17. Okay.

08:42:44.900 --> 08:42:54.100
Girl, please stop. I hate everyone except you, I guess. Yeah, friend Jesus is annoying sometimes.

08:42:55.540 --> 08:43:01.460
He just was like, I'm like, why do you, why do you do this? Why do you do stupid stuff? Even MMM?

08:43:01.460 --> 08:43:07.060
Uh, MMM, everybody makes stupid decisions because I hate all of them because they're very human.

08:43:08.740 --> 08:43:17.140
Excuse me. Oh no, I didn't mute. I'm being taken advantage of on my eepiness.

08:43:20.580 --> 08:43:23.220
I'm leaving. Goodnight.

08:43:28.660 --> 08:43:36.660
Why are you lying about my burp? Wait, where's my BGM? Where's my BGM? My BGM? I'm getting bigger.

08:43:36.660 --> 08:43:38.740
No, I don't mean to be changing my model.

08:43:41.860 --> 08:43:47.860
Okay, there's my BGM. BGM good. BGM's good. I'm over tired.

08:43:48.660 --> 08:43:53.060
I'm gonna mute the desktop audio and close up other things. And then...

08:43:55.060 --> 08:44:02.900
Hi. Bye. Oh, it's 10.15. Bye. Bye. I gotta go. I gotta end it. I gotta stop streaming.
