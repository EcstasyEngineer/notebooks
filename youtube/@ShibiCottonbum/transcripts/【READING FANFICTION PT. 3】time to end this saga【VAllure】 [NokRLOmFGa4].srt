That's what you sound like

380
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,100
Satan rolled his eyes

381
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,020
He's so mean to us golfs and punks just because we're in Slytherin and we're not preps

382
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,780
I turned around angrily. Actually, I think maybe it's because you're the bark lord

383
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,500
WTF he asked angrily. Oh nothing. I said sweetly

384
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I

385
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:39,460
Then subtle in the floor ellipses ellipses ellipses the floor opened. Oh my fucking god. No

386
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,860
I screamed as I feel down

387
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,780
Everyone looked at me weirdly

388
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Hey, where are you going?

389
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,220
Satan asked as I fell

390
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:59,380
I got out of the hole and it was back in the pensive in professor's traveller's classroom. Dumbly Dumb was there

391
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,660
Dumbly door. I think I just met you. I said

392
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,980
Howdy, howdy. Oh, yeah, I remember that Dumbly door said trying to be all gothic sinister came in

393
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,260
I can't keep track of the voices. Hey

00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,620
Hey, hi, this is my cost room. Wait, what's a fucking obi? What the hell are you doing?

395
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,620
Um

00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,260
I looked at her. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that

397
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,860
Wth how I screamed forgetting she was a teacher for a second, but she's a golf so it's okay

398
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,940
Professor sinister. I can't keep track of the story. Don't you don't have to

399
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Professor sinister looks sad

400
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:54,180
Um, I was drinking Voldemort serum. She started to cry black tears of depression

401
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
Dumbly Dom didn't know about them

402
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,580
Hey, are you crying tears of blood he asked curiously touching a tear

403
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,140
Fuck off. We both said and Dumbly Dom took his hand away

404
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,020
Professor sinister started crying again in her chair sobbing limpid tears

405
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,300
Oh my fucking god, I know be I think I'm addicted to Voldemort serum

406
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660

410
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,780
Do you think you could ask Tom Anderson for some help?

411
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,860

Fine a respondent. We started to go back to the dorm

417
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,380
How far did you go with Satan?

418
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Draco asked jealously

419
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,140
Not too far. Oh well. I borked

420
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Bork bork bork

00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,540

426
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
Draco giggled mysteriously

427
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:11,700
He opened a door snap and lumpkin was there serious was pokering them by stagging them with a black knife

428

430
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,780
Lumpkin bagged as serious started to suck his blood. I laughed statistically

431
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,420
stat stat stat stat

432
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420

00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,300
And snap being torqued

434
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,380
Okay, I know this is men but think about it people

They are pedos and snap tried to wrap them in new a status rock has anyone see shrack attack three elves

436
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,540
We took some of snipe's blood then draco and I went back to our rooms

437
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,780
We sat on my gothic black coffin

438
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:01,060
My clothes were kind of dirty. So I popped on a black leather outfit thingy kind of like one saline has in underworld

439
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,020
If you haven't heard of it, then fuck yo

440
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,460
I put on some black platform high heels

441
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Darko put on

442
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Desolation livers by mcr

443
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,900
Then we started to take off the cluthrothers closest

444
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,900
Wait, why did I put on clothes just to have him take them up? Don't worry about it

445
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,740
I talked off his shit and he had a six pack lulls

446
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,540
We started to make out like in the grudge

447
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,140
He pot his wetness in my you know what sexily I've got an orgy

00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:39,620
Oh, draco 11111 exclamation point one. Oh my fucking good draco exclamation point 111

449
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,540
I screamed passively as he got an arook station

450
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,820
I love you to ebery

451
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,980
He whispered sexily and then we fell asleep. Oh

452
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,060
Yeah, I don't know. I don't remember what a rock citation means

453
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
chapter 34

454
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,860
Oh, yeah, I don't really bother with the author's notes because

455
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,180
It's fine

456
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,620
We're here for the the story. I already know what I wrote in the author's notes

457
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,460
I woke up into coffin the next day draco was gone

458
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,940
I got up and put on a black tight sex address that was ripped up at the end

459
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:35,220
There was a red corset stuff going up the fort into black and it came up to my it's my music too loud

460
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,740
Um

461
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,780
To my knees there was a slit in the dress like in licking mr. Mrs. Smith

462
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:52,500
Mr. And mr. Smith, excuse me. We're progressive. I put on a wrap ripped black fishnets and black stilton boots

463
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,780
Suddenly sorious cocked on the door. I opened it

464
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,740
Hi ebony

465
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,820
He said guess what I have to come to professor sinister's office

466
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,900
Okay, I said a depraised voice

467
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,220
I'd want it to fuck draco and maybe listen to mcr evanescence. I came anyway

468
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,180
So what the fuck happened to sniping lupin?

469
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,300
I asked sirius flirtally

470
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:39,780
I fucking tortured them. He answered in a statistic way stats stats stats. They are an abca abca hazi and now

471
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
Hello, well, I laughed easily

472
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,580
Where are draco and vampira I muttered

473
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,060

474
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,220
Sorry, hold on. Let me rewrite that reread that

475
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,580

477
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,820

478
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,180
Um

479
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,740
We went into the office professor sinister was there. She was wearing a gothic black

480
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,460
Dress that was ripped up all over kind of like the one amy lee wears in this pic

481
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,820
What picture I want to see the picture it doesn't show

482
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,820
She was drinking some volzumort serum

483
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,260
She took up defensive into time torner

484
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,780
And obi you'll have to do another session now

485
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:51,780
Also, I need you to get me to cure before being addicted. She said sadly. Good luck fangs

486
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,540
And then I jumped into the pensive again

487
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,220
Prince of pence. I don't know what that says suddenly. I looked around

488
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,700
I was in the great hall eating count. Chorcula. It was morning

489
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
I was sitting next to satan

490
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:13,140
On the table was a tall gothic man with long black hair pale skin and blue eyes wearing a suit and black

491
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,940
converse shoes

492
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,940
He looked just like charlin manson

493
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,740
It's a cross between charlie manson and maryland manson

494
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,500
I noticed he was drinking a portent

495
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:36,340
Who's he I asked? Oh, that's professor slut born. What is that his name?

496
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,300
Is there a character in harry potter named slut born?

497
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,580
Is that an actual character slughorn, okay

498
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:56,660
Satan said he's the portents teacher ellipses ellipses ellipses ebony

499
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
Yeah, I asked

500
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,620
Did you know that maryland manson is playing in hogsmeade tonight? I thought it was hogsment

501
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,580
And they are sewing the exercise at the movies before that. Yeah

00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,980
Well, what to go to the contort and a movie with me

00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,580

511
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,620

923
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,420
Sorry volzmer and satan are the same person obviously

924
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:39,140
satan I walked outside we went into the movie tether where they were showing to exorcists

925
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:43,620
In it a boy and girl were doing it suddenly a serial killer came. I don't

926
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:49,380
Was that in the extra? I don't remember that say and I laughed at the blood cuz we're sadists

While any kills actual serial he's just like cailing cheerios

931
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:10,020
While satan was watching the movie I had an idea

932
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:14,340
I took satan's gothic black nightmare before christmas cigar

933
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,380
cigar

934
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:20,340
He is a nightmare before christmas themed cigar

935
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:26,180
Sexily from his pocket and put some amnesia potion in it

936
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,540
I put it back in his black amiel the strange bag

937
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:35,540
satan turned around and started to smoke it in the movie theater he just started smoking a cigar

938
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:46,980
Black clouds with red pentagrams and them started to fly around everywhere

939
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:54,980
OMG satan said jumping up I gasped cuz I was afraid he noticed and no but guess what

940
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,100
I knew that the amnesia had worked

941
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:02,020
Amnesia potion has not been invented yet so it will not work

942
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,420
He said too bad cuz I wanted to use somebody wait what?

943
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,020
It hasn't been invented yet so it can't work

944
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:18,980
Yes, it can if I bring something from the from the future to the past it's still gonna be functional

945
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,300
Unless it's like technology

946
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,180
Like a cell phone

947
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,580

01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:35,300
She screamed all the preps into theaters screamed but everyone else crapped

962

969
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:15,460
It's too bad because we didn't get to see the rest of the movie. Don't you think?

970
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,900
Yeah, I said as we kissed passively

971
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:24,340
Satan parked in the black driveway next to the place where drake gona had watched gc for the first time

972
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,740
We went inside where maryland manson was

01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:28,900
I the American retail wearing British vampire sue coughed up blood satan kneeled down beside me

1184
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:32,980
No, don't die. I gave him a rueful smile

1185
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:34,660
I'm sorry

1186
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:41,140
It's something I had to do to fulfill my duty as noble gothic mary sue satan sobbed. I love you ebony

1187
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,700
I love you too. I'll

1188
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:48,180
I'll see you in hell. I mumbled already finding my surroundings fading to black

1189
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:52,500
Bloody mary smith suddenly popped into the room for no apparent reason

1190
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:56,820
She frown when she realized the room was oddly quiet, but the sight of ebony's life was body. She screamed

1191
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:03,140
Her face became pale of horror. She screamed for the healers dumbledore mcgoogle and every single gothic person so you could think of

1192
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:06,340
Suddenly a glow started to surround the body of ebony

1193
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:12,100
Everyone scared stared in shock. Her body started to lift ever so slowly and then to everyone's shock. It started to incinerate

1194
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:16,900
When everyone realized what was happening. They rushed over to try to rescue the body, but it was too late

1195
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:19,540
The sue became nothing more than a pile of ashes

1196
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,260
A loud resounding of everyone bellowing

1197
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:24,180
No

1198
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:25,620
filled the room

1199
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:28,580
A flash of white light from the ashes and started to bounce around the room

1200
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:33,460
Everyone cowered in fear and they were temporarily blinded when it was all over things changed

1201
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,700
Like this if you cry every time

1202
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:41,300
All the silly goth clothes dropped from everyone's bodies

1203
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:42,340
Office note

1204
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:47,860
I will refuse to explain how the hell it happened and in their place closed the characters were normally wearing cannon appeared on their bodies

1205
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:51,140
When everyone got over the shock and becoming free of the gothic power

1206
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:55,300
Everybody cheered everyone started singing ding dong the sue is dead

1207
01:45:55,780 --> 01:46:01,060
Well, that is until the hp characters realized the true implications of becoming more cannon like again

1208
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:05,620
All the characters were supposed to be dead fell to the floor their body is cold and lifeless

1209
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:11,620
Harry and voldemort started dueling on the left side of the two the battle of the light side of the dark side of our reaching a climax

1210
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:16,820
And because the replacement author also looks to screw with cannon drink of her mining flood the scene and got married

1211
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:20,660
Meanwhile down in hell at me she had a single tear because of her current situation

1212
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:26,020
A situation that she would live in for all eternity or at least until the end of fan fiction time

1213
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:30,980
Now you can actually read

1214
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,340
What in the world?

1215
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,500
Don't ask a harlot. Don't ask

1216
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:41,140
Um, she lost it all but she knew she had to remain strong. Nothing would ever break her down

1217
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,780
She looked down over her pale body and frowned

1218
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:47,220
Where are my email clothes? She asked herself in confusion

1219
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:54,740
Then it occurred to her for her shirt. She was wearing a bright pink polo with a little seagull on the right side

1220
01:46:55,460 --> 01:47:01,620
Below that she was wearing a denim miniskirt with destroyed look on it paired underneath that skirt with leggings with a little mousse at the bottom

1221
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:08,260
And then ebony realized on her shoulder. She was carrying a pretty bag with an eagle that said live your life written all over the bag

1222
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:11,060
Ebony suppressed the urge to scream

1223
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:15,860
Here she was decked out in pro clothes perhaps to the extreme wearing stuff from erber copy and fitch

1224
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,860
american eagle and

1225
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:19,300
Hollister

1226
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,580
Panicked ebony hastily tried to take off the holster polar but underneath it

1227
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:26,740
There was another holster polo underneath ebony frown and looked under her shirt

1228
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:32,340
All she saw was a bra underneath dare. I point out that it's from airy line available at american eagle

1229
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:34,260
They have nice bras

1230
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:37,300
Uh, ebony tried to remove the shirt again. They're very comfy actually

1231
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:42,340
Uh, but to her frustration there was not yet an again another polo to replace it

1232
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,940
This is unlogical and doesn't make any sense

1233
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:49,860
Ebony bellowed out into the air. She failed to see the irony in her statement

1234
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:53,780
How hypocritical her words were seeing as she was practically calling the kettle black here

1235
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:57,300
Ebony slit her wrists and mumbled to herself. Oh my god

1236
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:01,860
Cooch my gooch

1237
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:03,860

1241
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:26,900

01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:53,220
Do you already have a pussy then?

1335
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,940

01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:59,380
There's a lot of space

1337
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:01,380
All right

1338
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:03,620
Like I said gay porn instead of just regular porn

1339
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:06,580

Draw a little car on it draw your little car in your parking space. I'm giving you so many ideas

1343
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:29,940
You can draw like like a little like a little hot dog like the other end

1344
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:32,580
Like a hot dog in a blanket

1345
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:34,820
Draw a cat draw a dog

1346
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:38,020
And be like I got that dog in me bark bark

1347
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:43,700
Taking a pig with the hot wheels take a pig with a with a tech deck

1348
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:46,980
Just start grinding on that

1349

She'd be you thought like you go stick was down lower

1350

1351
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,500

1352
01:55:58,580 --> 01:55:59,940
What's it called?

1353
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:05,140
It's like I have something blindness like I can't remember things properly. So like I'll see something

1354
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:10,900
But I don't remember it how I should remember it like my headcanon just takes over

1355
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:18,740
So now I'm picturing your your giggle stick is like right near your belly button now. Isn't it up towards there? I don't remember

1356
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:22,820
You're artistic. I'm not artistic. I'm acoustic get it right

1357
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:28,180
There's space so it's not a landing strip then make it into a landing strip

1358
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,500
I don't know what to tell you

1359
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:34,820
Yeah, put a whole storage unit in I'll take a tour

1360
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:38,660

01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:43,380
MTV welcome to my crib like come on except welcome to my taint come on guys

1362
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:48,180
What's going on here

1363
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:53,140
Do you really want to know I didn't say on the belly button I said below the belly button

1364
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:55,140
I

1365
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:59,540
Need someone to draw a picture of me with a magnifying glass looking at your gooch

1366
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,660
Goochie goochie go

1367
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:08,900
Renala is on my lap kind of want to know you kind of don't

1368
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:16,660
All right, she be you got to pick one caller three name on it or she be branded gooch tattoo, uh

1369
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:19,700
I would prefer the caller

1370
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:22,020
To be honest with you

1371
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,140
But that's a hard question

1372
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:30,100
This whole conversation is because that guy's name I had told you I'm acoustic

1373
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:37,940
I don't like you say one word I'm gonna go in a tangent for 20 minutes

1374
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:43,460
I feel like you need a mannequin to have a constant reference of correct anatomy

1375
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:46,180
Then I'll just start humping the mannequin

1376
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:49,300
Just give me a male sex doll at that point

1377
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:52,020
One word

1378
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:57,140
Ten bars ten seconds five bars five seconds cinnamon women all men

1379
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:03,780
All men are friends

1380
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,340
What's my favorite sexual company

1381
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:20,740
I don't fucking know. I'm not a dude

1382
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:24,660
I just get a dildo when I'm fine. I don't need a doll

1383
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:27,540
Where am I gonna put that?

1384
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:32,260
My family's gonna come over and I'm just gonna have like harem doll on the couch

1385
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:36,260
I'm like, hi. This is my new boyfriend. He he

1386
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:41,460
They'll be like, how did you even afford this because those things are like $2,000

1387
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,780
I just dress them up take them on dates

1388
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:48,900
You know, this is actually sounding like an appealing idea

1389
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:57,460
Like if I was a dude

1390
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:03,540
I feel like it's more socially acceptable for a man to have a doll but not a woman, you know, I just thought about that

1391
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:06,580
I don't know why that is

1392
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:11,700
Shoving in the closet. I have no space in my closet. I have no space in my house

1393
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:18,260
That's why the human dog bed is just on my couch all the time and I've been sleeping. I haven't slept on my bed in like two weeks

1394
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:24,180
I've just been sleeping in the human dog bed. I need to clean that thing

1395
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:32,180
So confused right now as you should

1396
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:39,860
Your parents are cool. They accept us as a doll. Uh, they would probably send me to the psych ward again. That's what they would do

1397
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:44,420
groupie sock vacation

1398
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,060

1399
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:49,060
wink

1400
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:55,060
You need to clean that thing you should clean out your flashlight

1401
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:02,820
How about that it's crusty sitting on your bed. It's starting to have mold in it, bro. You gotta get rid of that

1402
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:09,300

1780
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:24,440
Shibi's dead.

1781
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:27,440
Kill her.

1782
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:30,440
Let's take a listen.

1783
02:51:30,440 --> 02:51:35,440
Is this going to work?

1784
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:45,440
Whoa.

1785
02:51:45,440 --> 02:51:59,440
I can't, I hear the media source.

1786
02:51:59,440 --> 02:52:13,440
It doesn't let me hear it.

1787
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:16,440
Yeah, I know you guys heard it.

1788
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:23,440
Hold on, I'm just going to play it at the same time from my computer.

1789
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:25,440
Oh, wait, what?

1790
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:28,440
Oh, sweet.

1791
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:33,440
Strati just sent me my cover up.

1792
02:52:33,440 --> 02:52:37,440
Let's fucking go.

1793
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:39,440
Stimming time.

1794
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:42,440
I've been stimming the intonator.

1795
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:54,440
My whole thing was, this was my, this was my, this was just a default model I bought off at Etsy.

1796
02:52:54,440 --> 02:53:04,440
I had another model I got made by Swalcoi, but that never saw the light of day because they got hired to VLR and it will never see the light of day.

1797
02:53:04,440 --> 02:53:06,440
But this, this wasn't my design.

1798
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:15,440
I had a different design.

1799
02:53:15,440 --> 02:53:16,440
Hold on, let me listen.

1800
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:22,440
I'll play it at the same time so I can hear it.

1801
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:32,440
Or actually I can just mute this and then play it from my headphones.

1802
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:38,440
Why is this in the weirdest fucking place?

1803
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:49,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1804
02:53:49,440 --> 02:53:56,440
Nope, nope, nope, self.

1805
02:53:56,440 --> 02:54:11,440
Wait, is this why I can't hear it?

1806
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:15,440
Now it doesn't want to play at all.

1807
02:54:15,440 --> 02:54:23,440
What the frick?

1808
02:54:23,440 --> 02:54:25,440
Why would it play at all?

1809
02:54:25,440 --> 02:54:41,440
Bro, I hate, I hate life.

1810
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:43,440
Hey, let music start playing.

1811
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:51,440
Oh, oh, oh.

02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:52,440
Wait, you know what I'll just do?

1813
02:54:52,440 --> 02:54:58,440
We'll do this instead.

1814
02:54:58,440 --> 02:55:00,440
I don't remember what I said in this.

1815
02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:07,440
I know I didn't say anything that was Docsworthy though.

1816
02:55:07,440 --> 02:55:10,440
Window capture.

1817
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:11,440
Oh my God, perfect.

1818
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:19,440
Now we can all hear.

1819
02:55:19,440 --> 02:55:34,440
Marina, can you stop growling at him?

1820
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:37,440
Let me turn this up.

1821
02:55:37,440 --> 02:55:38,440
You guys ready?

1822
02:55:38,440 --> 02:55:42,440
Are you guys ready for peak content?

1823
02:55:42,440 --> 02:55:44,440
Are you not entertained?

1824
02:55:44,440 --> 02:55:45,440
Are you ready?

1825
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:49,440
Can you hear?

1826
02:55:49,440 --> 02:55:50,440
Ready to be amazed?

1827
02:55:50,440 --> 02:55:54,440
This is what got me into Veeler.

1828
02:55:54,440 --> 02:55:56,440
Can I show this?

1829
02:55:56,440 --> 02:56:00,440
Hold on, let me ask Strawny.

1830
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:07,440
Can I show my audition video on stream?

1831
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:19,440
Rn.

1832
02:56:19,440 --> 02:56:21,440
Oh shit, it does.

1833
02:56:50,440 --> 02:56:58,440
All right, cool, I can say it.

1834
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:00,440
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1835
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:03,440
I just have to make sure something real quick.

1836
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:07,440
I have to find where the timestamp is that I say something that I got to get rid of.

1837
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:09,440
Don't you say this?

1838
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:11,440
I'm like, oh shit, you're right.

1839
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:43,440
Okay, perfect.

1840
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:45,440
I know the timestamp now.

1841
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:46,440
Okay.

1842
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:48,440
I just won't play you the last 20 seconds.

1843
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:52,440
All right, you ready?

1844
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:53,440
You ready?

1845
02:57:53,440 --> 02:57:54,440
You ready?

1846
02:57:54,440 --> 02:57:55,440
You guys ready?

1847
02:57:55,440 --> 02:57:58,440
You're getting peak?

1848
02:57:58,440 --> 02:57:59,440
Peak?

1849
02:57:59,440 --> 02:58:01,440
Yeah, Strawny didn't save me.

1850
02:58:01,440 --> 02:58:05,440
Peak stuff.

1851
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:07,440
Yeah, I'm so freaking proud.

1852
02:58:07,440 --> 02:58:09,440
Yeah, Pookie, Pookie, do me back then.

1853
02:58:09,440 --> 02:58:13,440
She a real one.

1854
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:15,440
Do you guys want to know how I did this, by the way?

1855
02:58:15,440 --> 02:58:17,440
So first of all, hi, my name is Sheebie Cottonbums.

1856
02:58:17,440 --> 02:58:19,440
We'll probably get make into a clip.

1857
02:58:19,440 --> 02:58:22,440
Do you want to know how I got into Veeler?

1858
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:25,440
I just stayed in the basics.

1859
02:58:25,440 --> 02:58:27,440
And I kept it short and simple.

1860
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:32,440
My video is actually only three minutes and 30 seconds long.

1861
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:36,440
I didn't even do five minutes because I didn't need five minutes to see how amazing I was.

1862
02:58:36,440 --> 02:58:45,440
Honestly, the reason why I was hired was because of my voice acting ability.

1863
02:58:45,440 --> 02:58:49,440
Those are the notes that Strawny gave back to me during my interview.

1864
02:58:49,440 --> 02:58:53,440
Another thing is, hold on, I'm going to change out of my outfit for this,

1865
02:58:53,440 --> 02:58:59,440
because I know this is going to get freaking clipped and people are going to be so confused.

1866
02:58:59,440 --> 02:59:00,440
Hold on.

1867
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:03,440
Let me change real quick.

1868
02:59:03,440 --> 02:59:11,440
Hey.

1869
02:59:11,440 --> 02:59:16,440
Let me change my outfit.

1870
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:17,440
Don't worry about it.

1871
02:59:17,440 --> 02:59:21,440
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

1872
02:59:21,440 --> 02:59:27,440
I'm going to put on some nice little outfit for you there.

1873
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:32,440
My cat is scratching in the litter box.

1874
02:59:32,440 --> 02:59:41,440
Here, I'll wear this.

1875
02:59:41,440 --> 02:59:50,440
Can I put my arms down? Hello?

1876
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:52,440
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

1877
02:59:52,440 --> 03:00:05,440
My neck is kind of popping off. Hold on.

1878
03:00:05,440 --> 03:00:09,440
Why am I like this? I need to turn down.

1879
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:19,440
Let me turn down the freaking physics.

1880
03:00:19,440 --> 03:00:32,440
Oh, my cookies are ready.

1881
03:00:32,440 --> 03:00:37,440
Let me get my cookies. I got a reduction? No, I just made myself bigger, didn't I?

1882
03:00:37,440 --> 03:00:39,440
Oh, I did. Hold on.

1883
03:00:39,440 --> 03:00:51,440
Siri, stop.

1884
03:00:51,440 --> 03:01:02,440
Delicious. Cookies! Do you want some cookies?

1885
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:05,440
Oh, I need to let those cool a little bit.

1886
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:14,440
Let those baby girls cool. Okay.

1887
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:17,440
Hi. Hi.

1888
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:18,440
My name is Shibi Cottonbum.

1889
03:01:18,440 --> 03:01:21,440
Are you wondering how I got into viola?

1890
03:01:21,440 --> 03:01:23,440
Well, what did I do exactly?

1891
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:28,440
I kept stuff short, sweet, and to the point.

1892
03:01:28,440 --> 03:01:33,440
And I demonstrated my voice acting abilities.

1893
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:34,440
That's really it.

1894
03:01:34,440 --> 03:01:38,440
And then Shrani just stalked me a lot on my stream so she could see my actual personality

1895
03:01:38,440 --> 03:01:44,440
because I am so flat in this, in this video.

1896
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:48,440
I'm just like, hi. Oh, hey there.

1897
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:51,440
Hee-hee, oo-hoo. That's all I really did.

1898
03:01:51,440 --> 03:01:54,440
Okay.

1899
03:01:54,440 --> 03:01:57,440
And I don't know how I AC auditioned. I still don't know how I got hired.

1900
03:01:57,440 --> 03:02:03,440
If you look at this audition and you wonder, oh my God, how did she get in and I didn't?

1901
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:10,440
You know, you're totally entitled to that because I wonder that too.

1902
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:13,440
All right. Let's check it out. Let's check it out, folks.

1903
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:17,440
You ready? Let's go.

1904
03:02:17,440 --> 03:02:26,440
Hi. Oh, you're not getting attention to other girls sending in applications, are you?

1905
03:02:26,440 --> 03:02:30,440
You're one and only, right?

1906
03:02:30,440 --> 03:02:38,440
Yeah, I better be. Or else.

1907
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:42,440
Anyway, hi there. My name is Irina.

1908
03:02:42,440 --> 03:02:50,440
I'm a Vtuber that does a wide variety of content from playing Souls Likes.

1909
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:52,440
Who's your worst?

1910
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:54,440
Or retro games.

1911
03:02:54,440 --> 03:02:57,440
You're a brat and I want to put you in your place.

1912
03:02:57,440 --> 03:03:00,440
Or just yapping away at my chat.

1913
03:03:00,440 --> 03:03:02,440
Okay.

1914
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:09,440
Do an RR squat.

1915
03:03:09,440 --> 03:03:11,440
RR.

1916
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:17,440
Oh, God. That sounded way looter than it needed to be.

1917
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:20,440
I love entertaining my audience.

1918
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:23,440
I have lots of goals I want to accomplish with a dealer.

1919
03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:26,440
It's always been my dream to voice in a game.

1920
03:03:26,440 --> 03:03:31,440
And if it's spicy, that gets me even more excited.

1921
03:03:31,440 --> 03:03:36,440
I'd also be so thankful to be able to have my own merch create song covers

1922
03:03:36,440 --> 03:03:39,440
and make amazing new friends in my gen.

1923
03:03:39,440 --> 03:03:43,440
But my biggest goal would be to reach a wider audience

1924
03:03:43,440 --> 03:03:48,440
and share my love for voice acting in ASMR like this.

1925
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:57,440
Your body is 70% water.

1926
03:03:57,440 --> 03:04:08,440
And daddy's thirsty.

1927
03:04:08,440 --> 03:04:12,440
Normally, I'm a cackle priestess, so not only do I love to serve,

1928
03:04:12,440 --> 03:04:16,440
but I also love to be worshipped.

1929
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:18,440
I have done only fans in the past,

1930
03:04:18,440 --> 03:04:20,440
and I've recently done some not-safe-for-work audios,

1931
03:04:20,440 --> 03:04:23,440
and I've commissioned and I've drawn not-safe-for-work art.

1932
03:04:23,440 --> 03:04:26,440
So, no, you can't corrupt me more than I already-

1933
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:28,440
Whoops, jump scare!

1934
03:04:28,440 --> 03:04:30,440
For me, either.

1935
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:32,440
I think I would be a great fit for be a dealer

1936
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:34,440
because I can do different accents

1937
03:04:34,440 --> 03:04:37,440
and I love to embody the voices that I act for.

1938
03:04:37,440 --> 03:04:39,440
Whether it be a loli,

1939
03:04:39,440 --> 03:04:41,440
the first was a fascination.

1940
03:04:41,440 --> 03:04:44,440
Now it's just my lifestyle.

1941
03:04:44,440 --> 03:04:46,440
A major brat.

1942
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:50,440
Sometimes being a smug little shit can get you places.

1943
03:04:50,440 --> 03:04:53,440
A caring mother.

1944
03:04:53,440 --> 03:04:56,440
It's about time I found someone I could love on.

1945
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:59,440
A bo-me-mo-me.

1946
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:02,440
Life can be so restrictive sometimes.

1947
03:05:02,440 --> 03:05:04,440
We should cut loose.

1948
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:06,440
For last but not least.

1949
03:05:06,440 --> 03:05:08,440
Ropes, poggers, ropes!

1950
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:10,440
Oh, it hurts.

1951
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:13,440
But it hurts so good.

1952
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:18,440
But I do hope you'll consider me for VLR

1953
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:21,440
because it would be my honor to be part of something brand new

1954
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:23,440
in the ENVTuber sphere

1955
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:26,440
and to be able to assist you in your growing into something more

1956
03:05:26,440 --> 03:05:29,440
and to make so many viewers stand at attention.

1957
03:05:29,440 --> 03:05:32,440
I mean, happy.

1958
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:35,440
That's it!

1959
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:38,440
That's literally it.

1960
03:05:38,440 --> 03:05:41,440
I literally hold my breath.

1961
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:43,440
That's literally it.

1962
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:46,440
I literally hold on. Let me see.

1963
03:05:51,440 --> 03:05:53,440
Hold on.

1964
03:05:55,440 --> 03:05:57,440
Hold on.

1965
03:05:57,440 --> 03:06:00,440
I think there's just one thing I have to skip over.

1966
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:03,440
I'm done.

1967
03:06:09,440 --> 03:06:12,440
Your livestreams will be there in the timeline

1968
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:15,440
and I'm determined to be a part of it.

1969
03:06:15,440 --> 03:06:17,440
Thank you so much for watching

1970
03:06:17,440 --> 03:06:19,440
and go look at it through the rest of the auditions

1971
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:21,440
and considering bye.

1972
03:06:21,440 --> 03:06:23,440
Bye-bye!

1973
03:06:23,440 --> 03:06:25,440
Mwah-mwah-mwah-mwah-mwah!

1974
03:06:26,440 --> 03:06:29,440
That was it!

1975
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:33,440
That was my audition.

1976
03:06:33,440 --> 03:06:36,440
Short, simple, to the point.

1977
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:39,440
I edited this background.

1978
03:06:41,440 --> 03:06:44,440
I demonstrated my voice acting ability.

1979
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:47,440
I showed clips that showed my ASMR ability.

1980
03:06:47,440 --> 03:06:49,440
I showed a drawing that I made.

1981
03:06:49,440 --> 03:06:51,440
That was NSFW.

1982
03:06:51,440 --> 03:06:55,440
I showed funny clips of myself.

1983
03:06:55,440 --> 03:06:58,440
That was it.

1984
03:06:58,440 --> 03:07:01,440
It's really basic.

1985
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:03,440
It's really basic.

1986
03:07:03,440 --> 03:07:05,440
I'll be honest, though.

1987
03:07:05,440 --> 03:07:08,440
I have seen the other girls' auditions.

1988
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:11,440
I will tell you that

1989
03:07:11,440 --> 03:07:14,440
Emmys and Mercies are so amazing.

1990
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:17,440
If they ever show you,

1991
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:20,440
you guys are in for a treat.

1992
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:23,440
Sometimes all you have to do is just keep it basic.

1993
03:07:23,440 --> 03:07:25,440
Keep it to the point.

1994
03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:28,440
Some people take the whole five minutes.

1995
03:07:28,440 --> 03:07:31,440
I feel like you have to capture them.

1996
03:07:31,440 --> 03:07:33,440
You have to reel them in.

1997
03:07:33,440 --> 03:07:36,440
They always tell you in auditions

1998
03:07:36,440 --> 03:07:39,440
that you have to catch their attention

1999
03:07:39,440 --> 03:07:41,440
in the first five seconds.

2000
03:07:41,440 --> 03:07:43,440
I did.

2001
03:07:43,440 --> 03:07:45,440
I said,

2002
03:07:45,440 --> 03:07:47,440
do you...

2003
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:49,440
Hi, Raina.

2004
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:51,440
Do you...

2005
03:07:51,440 --> 03:07:54,440
You're not looking at other girls' applications, are you?

2006
03:07:54,440 --> 03:07:56,440
That's what I did.

2007
03:07:56,440 --> 03:07:58,440
I did the yandere angle.

2008
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:01,440
Slam, bam, and thank you, ma'am.

2009
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:03,440
Indeed.

2010
03:08:03,440 --> 03:08:05,440
Little sis won't show us.

2011
03:08:05,440 --> 03:08:07,440
Oh, that's too bad.

2012
03:08:07,440 --> 03:08:09,440
Hers is really, really, really good.

2013
03:08:09,440 --> 03:08:11,440
I think hers has some personal info.

2014
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:13,440
That's why.

2015
03:08:13,440 --> 03:08:15,440
Same with Mercies, if they don't ever show you.

2016
03:08:15,440 --> 03:08:17,440
I can't remember, but I think that's why.

2017
03:08:17,440 --> 03:08:19,440
Yes.

2018
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:21,440
It has little toys.

2019
03:08:21,440 --> 03:08:23,440
That is correct.

2020
03:08:23,440 --> 03:08:25,440
Well, yeah.

2021
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:27,440
You probably won't see anybody's.

2022
03:08:27,440 --> 03:08:29,440
I'm showing you mine because it's basic and to the point.

2023
03:08:29,440 --> 03:08:31,440
And this is such a great, simple example

2024
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:33,440
of how to do a

2025
03:08:33,440 --> 03:08:35,440
simple, sweet audition.

2026
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:37,440
You know how I did this, by the way?

2027
03:08:41,440 --> 03:08:43,440
I looked at

2028
03:08:43,440 --> 03:08:45,440
other people's auditions

2029
03:08:45,440 --> 03:08:47,440
in terms of what people asked for.

2030
03:08:47,440 --> 03:08:49,440
I did so much research

2031
03:08:49,440 --> 03:08:51,440
of people who

2032
03:08:51,440 --> 03:08:53,440
got into Corpo's auditions.

2033
03:08:53,440 --> 03:08:55,440
But, yeah,

2034
03:08:55,440 --> 03:08:57,440
I just was like, hey, I'm funny.

2035
03:08:57,440 --> 03:08:59,440
This is my favorite clip, though, my Liza P clip.

2036
03:08:59,440 --> 03:09:01,440
Hold on, let's just play this again.

2037
03:09:01,440 --> 03:09:03,440
Can we play the Liza P clip?

2038
03:09:03,440 --> 03:09:05,440
This is my favorite Liza P clip.

2039
03:09:05,440 --> 03:09:07,440
It's great that there's a wide

2040
03:09:07,440 --> 03:09:09,440
variety of content

2041
03:09:09,440 --> 03:09:11,440
from playing Soul's Likes.

2042
03:09:13,440 --> 03:09:15,440
Who's your worst?

2043
03:09:17,440 --> 03:09:19,440
That was

2044
03:09:19,440 --> 03:09:21,440
the worst.

2045
03:09:21,440 --> 03:09:23,440
Bomp.

2046
03:09:29,440 --> 03:09:31,440
And, uh, yeah,

2047
03:09:31,440 --> 03:09:33,440
I'll 100% play Liza P

2048
03:09:33,440 --> 03:09:35,440
because I love Liza P.

2049
03:09:35,440 --> 03:09:37,440
It was so good.

2050
03:09:37,440 --> 03:09:39,440
I hate

2051
03:09:39,440 --> 03:09:41,440
that enemy. I hate that.

2052
03:09:41,440 --> 03:09:43,440
I hate that so bad.

2053
03:09:43,440 --> 03:09:45,440
But, yeah, then you saw me

2054
03:09:45,440 --> 03:09:46,960
how I use lots of different models,

2055
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:50,680
like I use my P and G tube model.

2056
03:09:53,240 --> 03:09:54,660
Cause that's that, that right there.

2057
03:09:54,660 --> 03:09:56,440
That's what my model actually looks like

2058
03:09:56,440 --> 03:09:58,560
is my high priestess thing.

2059
03:09:58,560 --> 03:10:00,240
That's what she looked like.

2060
03:10:00,240 --> 03:10:01,620
But yeah, that was,

2061
03:10:03,360 --> 03:10:04,200
you gotta,

2062
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:06,680
you gotta, you gotta also,

2063
03:10:06,680 --> 03:10:08,520
the reason why I was like,

2064
03:10:08,520 --> 03:10:09,560
one of my notes also,

2065
03:10:09,560 --> 03:10:14,080
I had a lot of vocal fry on when I did my high pitch voice,

2066
03:10:14,080 --> 03:10:16,120
my, my cute and funny voices.

2067
03:10:16,120 --> 03:10:16,960
And,

2068
03:10:20,040 --> 03:10:21,480
right now, what are you doing?

2069
03:10:21,480 --> 03:10:22,320
And so I,

2070
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:24,520
after getting that feedback from my interview,

2071
03:10:24,520 --> 03:10:27,600
I did work on my voice acting a lot more.

2072
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:31,500
And now I do a lot better, cute and funny voice.

2073
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:37,800
Rena's a child model, she, yeah.

2074
03:10:37,800 --> 03:10:38,640
I kind of,

2075
03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:40,240
and people at like,

2076
03:10:41,640 --> 03:10:43,760
cause they're like, I had someone ask me,

2077
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:47,560
what is it like being Corpo and like giving up your IP?

2078
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:48,720
And I said,

2079
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:49,840
honestly,

2080
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:54,440
Rena was like kind of like my younger self

2081
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:56,320
and she beats my more mature self.

2082
03:10:56,320 --> 03:10:58,580
And I, it's two sides of the same coin.

2083
03:10:59,620 --> 03:11:01,340
How did you get started on the voice acting?

2084
03:11:01,340 --> 03:11:03,520
It literally happened while I was streaming.

2085
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:05,020
I never did it before.

2086
03:11:07,720 --> 03:11:09,960
I literally had never done it before.

2087
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:12,820
And so, and then Strani said I was the only person

2088
03:11:12,820 --> 03:11:14,800
that read everybody's lines.

2089
03:11:15,900 --> 03:11:18,220
And she, I don't know if she said that I was the only person

2090
03:11:18,220 --> 03:11:19,860
who read the lines in general,

2091
03:11:19,860 --> 03:11:20,700
but she said that,

2092
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:23,020
that's why I caught her attention

2093
03:11:23,020 --> 03:11:24,660
is because I read everybody's lines

2094
03:11:24,660 --> 03:11:29,660
and I demonstrated my voice acting ability in my range.

2095
03:11:30,980 --> 03:11:35,820
And I've even improved upon that since then.

2096
03:11:35,820 --> 03:11:39,140
So it's, yeah.

2097
03:11:39,140 --> 03:11:39,980
And they held real,

2098
03:11:39,980 --> 03:11:42,280
yeah, it's funny because you can hear,

2099
03:11:42,280 --> 03:11:45,600
you can hear, you know, the sheebie voice when I do,

2100
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:49,360
it's like, time until we got a,

2101
03:11:49,360 --> 03:11:50,720
I don't remember where the line was,

2102
03:11:50,720 --> 03:11:52,240
but like, you guys, it's like,

2103
03:11:52,240 --> 03:11:54,760
I was, Strani heard my voice and that,

2104
03:11:54,760 --> 03:11:55,960
and she's just like, yup, that's it.

2105
03:11:55,960 --> 03:11:56,840
That's ropes, that's it.

2106
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:59,000
And I don't know how it was under,

2107
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:03,000
I think, yeah, there's over like 400 people

2108
03:12:04,120 --> 03:12:05,320
and I got ropes.

2109
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:08,680
But,

2110
03:12:11,120 --> 03:12:11,960
but yeah.

2111
03:12:12,640 --> 03:12:15,800
I was like, keep it short, sweet to the point.

2112
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:18,240
Demonstrate your stuff.

2113
03:12:19,240 --> 03:12:21,440
Grab with funny clips in the beginning.

2114
03:12:22,880 --> 03:12:24,280
Demonstrate, I know like,

2115
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:26,600
Amy demonstrated her singing ability

2116
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:30,160
and I see she demonstrated her DJing ability,

2117
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:34,480
which is very like, very unique.

2118
03:12:34,480 --> 03:12:36,000
Show, show how you're different,

2119
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:37,360
show how you stand out.

2120
03:12:38,960 --> 03:12:41,120
Honestly, my voice acting,

2121
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:42,960
like I never thought I would get into a corpo

2122
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:45,160
because I never had any like musical ability

2123
03:12:45,160 --> 03:12:47,440
and that's usually what corpos look for.

2124
03:12:47,440 --> 03:12:50,080
I got lucky because Vila is looking

2125
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:52,000
for voice acting ability and so,

2126
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:55,000
and also like, you know, a good personality to work with.

2127
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
So I highly recommend if you're interested

2128
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:01,520
in going for gen two,

2129
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:02,880
just work on your voice acting,

2130
03:13:02,880 --> 03:13:06,200
work on also like, like you have to understand

2131
03:13:06,200 --> 03:13:08,360
when you apply for a company,

2132
03:13:08,360 --> 03:13:10,160
they're looking for a certain person,

2133
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:13,800
a certain personality and I damage,

2134
03:13:13,800 --> 03:13:16,880
even though I played a cute and funny character,

2135
03:13:16,880 --> 03:13:18,840
I still had my moments

2136
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:23,560
because that, that Chibi model could get to like big.

2137
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:25,960
So I would switch between the two a lot actually.

2138
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:30,320
Oh my God, my cats are fighting.

2139
03:13:30,320 --> 03:13:31,400
Stop, boomy.

2140
03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:33,960
You're alone, bro.

2141
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:39,960
And so like, if you capture their interest in the video,

2142
03:13:41,480 --> 03:13:42,960
they'll usually look at your content

2143
03:13:42,960 --> 03:13:45,360
that you're currently streaming.

2144
03:13:45,360 --> 03:13:48,360
And I think, I think, I remember,

2145
03:13:48,360 --> 03:13:50,720
I think Shrani was watching one of my streams

2146
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:53,920
where I was, I think I was playing oblivion

2147
03:13:53,920 --> 03:13:57,680
and I was saying, I'm gonna be say so and play oblivion.

2148
03:13:57,680 --> 03:13:59,960
So I used my grown up nun model

2149
03:14:00,960 --> 03:14:04,040
and I was acting like,

2150
03:14:04,040 --> 03:14:07,520
and I was kind of talking in my ropes voice, my Shibi voice

2151
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:09,520
and I think that's why I got it.

2152
03:14:09,520 --> 03:14:12,640
And you, like you hear the story that Shrani tells

2153
03:14:12,640 --> 03:14:15,120
where she was watching a Zera stream

2154
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:18,920
and all Zera had to say was like three words.

2155
03:14:18,920 --> 03:14:21,120
I need gold, I need gold.

2156
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:22,360
I can't even do her voice.

2157
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:23,640
Hi, Reena.

2158
03:14:23,640 --> 03:14:25,840
Are you over here because Boomi's bothering you?

2159
03:14:28,440 --> 03:14:29,600
See your voice a game goal.

2160
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:31,920
Oh yeah, well, I'm already voicing a game.

2161
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:34,280
A lot of my goals in Vila have already come true.

2162
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:36,760
I'm like, the game's probably gonna come out

2163
03:14:36,760 --> 03:14:38,320
either this month or next month.

2164
03:14:38,320 --> 03:14:40,160
I don't know how the progress is.

2165
03:14:43,400 --> 03:14:46,960
And yeah, it's just like you just have to,

2166
03:14:46,960 --> 03:14:48,600
and you also just have to be comfortable

2167
03:14:48,600 --> 03:14:50,680
with the content that you'll be making.

2168
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:56,920
But I'm personally very, very excited for Gen Two,

2169
03:14:56,920 --> 03:14:58,840
the types of voices and personalities

2170
03:14:58,880 --> 03:15:01,760
as I was gonna say, Reena, chill out.

2171
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:04,680
As I was gonna say is a company,

2172
03:15:05,800 --> 03:15:08,080
we have pre-made models.

2173
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:12,480
I didn't like get to make Shibi.

2174
03:15:12,480 --> 03:15:14,640
I didn't make Shibi though, Strawni.

2175
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:17,520
I'm Strawni's brainchild and the refling's child.

2176
03:15:19,960 --> 03:15:21,640
Strawni's going to find someone

2177
03:15:21,640 --> 03:15:23,760
that matches the voice for Gen Two.

2178
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:25,440
If we have a cute and funny girl,

2179
03:15:25,440 --> 03:15:27,480
she's gonna look for a cute and funny voice.

2180
03:15:27,480 --> 03:15:30,560
If we have another sort of like mommy character,

2181
03:15:30,560 --> 03:15:32,840
she's gonna look for a more mature voice

2182
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:34,880
and a certain personality.

2183
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:38,000
The thing is like, so try to feed

2184
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,600
in two different like voice tropes

2185
03:15:40,600 --> 03:15:43,120
to show that you have a variety

2186
03:15:43,120 --> 03:15:47,160
so that people can like,

2187
03:15:47,160 --> 03:15:49,200
you can garner interest from Strawni.

2188
03:15:50,960 --> 03:15:51,800
But yeah.

2189
03:15:54,240 --> 03:15:57,320
Yeah, I'm gonna mess with Gen Two, fine.

2190
03:15:57,320 --> 03:15:59,760
I get along with anybody, to be honest with you,

2191
03:15:59,760 --> 03:16:01,320
like it's hard.

2192
03:16:01,320 --> 03:16:03,320
The only thing that like stops people

2193
03:16:03,320 --> 03:16:04,160
from getting along with me

2194
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:06,520
is the type of content that I make and that's fine.

2195
03:16:06,520 --> 03:16:09,040
I totally respect people for that

2196
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:10,320
or the type of people that I work with

2197
03:16:10,320 --> 03:16:14,520
since I see an Emmy, arcane, funny and stuff.

2198
03:16:14,520 --> 03:16:16,040
But yeah.

2199
03:16:17,120 --> 03:16:19,520
Chances be a lure, we need a monotone straight girl.

2200
03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:22,560
The antics of Gen One and Two, maybe, I don't know.

2201
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:23,960
Who knows?

2202
03:16:23,960 --> 03:16:26,280
But yeah, no, I look forward to it.

2203
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:27,360
I'm very excited.

2204
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:32,480
Now that I'm not, I never finished reading that.

2205
03:16:32,480 --> 03:16:35,200
I never finished reading My Immortal.

2206
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:41,280
But yeah, it's pretty, pretty, pretty basic stuff.

2207
03:16:41,280 --> 03:16:43,120
It's not, I didn't go crazy with it.

2208
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:47,400
I didn't try to, you know, I don't know.

2209
03:16:47,400 --> 03:16:50,880
Kudere girl, that would be pretty difficult to do Kudere.

2210
03:16:50,880 --> 03:16:52,520
I might be a part four.

2211
03:16:52,520 --> 03:16:54,360
I realized it's 11.

2212
03:16:54,360 --> 03:16:55,640
I started streaming at eight.

2213
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:56,680
Oh my God.

2214
03:16:56,680 --> 03:16:57,520
The hell?

2215
03:16:57,520 --> 03:16:58,360
How am I still here?

2216
03:16:59,680 --> 03:17:01,440
How am I awake right now?

2217
03:17:01,440 --> 03:17:03,320
Actually, no, I took a nap, I'm fine.

2218
03:17:03,320 --> 03:17:04,840
After the brain rot, Genshin.

2219
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:12,200
What is possessed?

2220
03:17:12,200 --> 03:17:13,160
It's possessed.

2221
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:18,120
No problem, no problem.

2222
03:17:18,120 --> 03:17:20,580
If there's any, I'm probably gonna see

2223
03:17:20,580 --> 03:17:23,640
if I can get that all clipped

2224
03:17:23,640 --> 03:17:28,200
and I don't know, people will have to dig through this VOD

2225
03:17:28,200 --> 03:17:30,600
to find helpful information.

2226
03:17:32,400 --> 03:17:33,840
Was it cute to see you back then?

2227
03:17:33,840 --> 03:17:34,680
Yeah.

2228
03:17:37,880 --> 03:17:42,240
Yeah, I was, but like, honestly, I'm not any different.

2229
03:17:42,240 --> 03:17:46,400
I just use my natural speaking voice as she be.

2230
03:17:46,400 --> 03:17:49,200
This is my natural speaking voice.

2231
03:17:49,200 --> 03:17:50,960
Whereas when I was reading it, I would talk a little bit

2232
03:17:50,960 --> 03:17:52,360
higher and I would talk like this.

2233
03:17:53,360 --> 03:17:55,160
Like that was really it.

2234
03:17:55,160 --> 03:17:56,760
And you still hear that voice sometimes,

2235
03:17:56,760 --> 03:18:01,760
like Rina peeks out when I'm super, super hyper or happy.

2236
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:07,640
Bunspeak is, yeah, exactly.

2237
03:18:07,640 --> 03:18:09,720
That's why you're not wrong.

2238
03:18:09,720 --> 03:18:12,280
Bunspeak is written up because I put that there

2239
03:18:12,280 --> 03:18:14,560
because I know my voice does that naturally.

2240
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:17,280
Like get high pitched when I'm happy.

2241
03:18:17,280 --> 03:18:19,160
So that's why I put in Bunspeak.

2242
03:18:19,480 --> 03:18:23,800
It's fun seeing how you used to be and how you are.

2243
03:18:23,800 --> 03:18:24,760
Meow.

2244
03:18:24,760 --> 03:18:25,880
Yeah, yeah, it's cool.

2245
03:18:25,880 --> 03:18:30,880
Cause I was about to give an example of like another person

2246
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:32,960
that went from one person to a new,

2247
03:18:32,960 --> 03:18:35,920
but I'm not gonna just like casually talk about PL stuff

2248
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:37,320
when they're not in my company.

2249
03:18:37,320 --> 03:18:42,320
But like, actually, I could talk about like Emmy,

2250
03:18:42,520 --> 03:18:44,360
for example, like Emmy used to be,

2251
03:18:44,360 --> 03:18:47,000
cause she's very open about being Loviti and stuff.

2252
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:50,240
She used to be like kind of like a normal spider girl

2253
03:18:50,240 --> 03:18:51,320
of average body type.

2254
03:18:51,320 --> 03:18:52,600
And now she's cute and funny.

2255
03:18:52,600 --> 03:18:54,680
And now like, but they had the same voice,

2256
03:18:54,680 --> 03:18:56,320
but it's different body type.

2257
03:18:56,320 --> 03:18:58,000
So it's very interesting.

2258
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:02,320
You'd be surprised about like who you can be,

2259
03:19:03,320 --> 03:19:04,920
who you can become.

2260
03:19:04,920 --> 03:19:07,360
And it's such a really cool experience.

2261
03:19:07,360 --> 03:19:11,120
Like having like, Shibi is so me now.

2262
03:19:11,120 --> 03:19:13,200
Like she is me.

2263
03:19:13,200 --> 03:19:16,980
Like she actually feels more of me than Rena ever did.

2264
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:20,960
So it's really funny how that happened.

2265
03:19:20,960 --> 03:19:25,640
Like I thought, I thought I would like be really sad,

2266
03:19:25,640 --> 03:19:27,720
not being cute, funny, but like I have,

2267
03:19:27,720 --> 03:19:31,040
I can always like do a project where I am cute, funny,

2268
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:32,280
like cute, funny, Shibi,

2269
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:35,520
or I can make a project where I'm this or that or that.

2270
03:19:35,520 --> 03:19:38,460
Cause what I love about Vila is that we have creative freedom.

2271
03:19:38,460 --> 03:19:40,720
And if I have an idea, I get to tell Strani

2272
03:19:40,720 --> 03:19:42,280
and Strani is like, that sounds amazing.

2273
03:19:42,280 --> 03:19:43,200
Let's do it.

2274
03:19:43,200 --> 03:19:45,960
And it's great, you know?

2275
03:19:45,960 --> 03:19:47,400
I did find my place.

2276
03:19:48,480 --> 03:19:49,320
It is different.

2277
03:19:49,320 --> 03:19:50,720
Cause people find out anyways,

2278
03:19:50,720 --> 03:19:52,920
it's just like an open secret who people are.

2279
03:19:53,920 --> 03:19:56,120
Again, it kind of ruins,

2280
03:19:56,120 --> 03:19:58,800
can ruin the kayfabe for some people.

2281
03:19:58,800 --> 03:19:59,640
But then again,

2282
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:01,560
people usually find out who they are anyways.

2283
03:20:01,560 --> 03:20:02,960
So does it really a matter in the end?

2284
03:20:02,960 --> 03:20:06,360
It's like, everybody knows who the PLs for like,

2285
03:20:07,400 --> 03:20:08,680
hololive are.

2286
03:20:08,680 --> 03:20:09,640
Like, come on.

2287
03:20:10,200 --> 03:20:14,040
Everybody knows the PLs like pixel of, you know,

2288
03:20:14,040 --> 03:20:16,640
Kauai of insert other Corpo here,

2289
03:20:16,640 --> 03:20:19,680
insert other Corpo there, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2290
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:22,560
Also, I was a literal nobody in my PL.

2291
03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:23,480
So it doesn't really matter.

2292
03:20:23,480 --> 03:20:25,000
It doesn't really affect people.

2293
03:20:26,480 --> 03:20:28,320
There are some big names who PLs will never found.

2294
03:20:28,320 --> 03:20:29,160
That's true.

2295
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:30,000
That's a good point.

2296
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:31,720
There is someone who I've always been curious

2297
03:20:31,720 --> 03:20:33,760
who they were in the past.

2298
03:20:33,760 --> 03:20:36,440
But some people have their stuff on lock.

2299
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:39,720
Honestly, I, when I came into Vila,

2300
03:20:39,720 --> 03:20:41,760
Shrani was like, oh, you know, when you get like,

2301
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:44,560
when we, when you debut, you can say who you are.

2302
03:20:44,560 --> 03:20:47,600
And I was honestly going to keep that on lock.

2303
03:20:47,600 --> 03:20:51,200
Like I was never going to say who I was.

2304
03:20:51,200 --> 03:20:52,640
But then I decided, you know what?

2305
03:20:52,640 --> 03:20:55,760
No, like I'm going to be open about it

2306
03:20:55,760 --> 03:21:00,760
because like I want to show people like who you can become

2307
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:02,440
versus who you were before.

2308
03:21:04,080 --> 03:21:05,240
Hi, Histees.

2309
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:08,360
Oh no, my allergies.

2310
03:21:10,760 --> 03:21:13,400
But, and then again, I don't,

2311
03:21:13,400 --> 03:21:15,640
so because the only thing that I don't like,

2312
03:21:15,640 --> 03:21:17,760
and I know that like, Amy doesn't like this too

2313
03:21:17,760 --> 03:21:20,080
because we're the most open about our PLs,

2314
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:23,640
is like, don't ask to see like our past life stuff

2315
03:21:23,640 --> 03:21:25,880
in terms of like, old content

2316
03:21:25,880 --> 03:21:27,840
or archives of our old content.

2317
03:21:27,840 --> 03:21:29,240
It just doesn't make any sense.

2318
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:33,160
We're no different than where we were before.

2319
03:21:33,160 --> 03:21:35,560
It's like who we were before.

2320
03:21:35,560 --> 03:21:39,080
It's just our model is different.

2321
03:21:39,080 --> 03:21:43,520
So like, I would prefer people not ask that of us

2322
03:21:43,520 --> 03:21:44,960
because I have had people ask like,

2323
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:49,040
oh, can you unarchive some of your rena stuff?

2324
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:52,160
And I'm like, I'm sorry, but no, because I'm right here.

2325
03:21:52,160 --> 03:21:54,080
Why would you need to look at my past content

2326
03:21:54,080 --> 03:21:55,000
when I'm right here?

2327
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:57,000
And you can look at my current content.

2328
03:21:58,960 --> 03:22:02,680
And then I don't want people to think

2329
03:22:02,680 --> 03:22:05,800
that I'm funneling them to my PL.

2330
03:22:05,800 --> 03:22:09,000
Like, no, I'm not leaving VLR ever.

2331
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:14,000
Like, I'm here all as long as it lasts for a thousand years.

2332
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:17,400
Like, I'm not going anywhere.

2333
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:19,280
Why would I, I don't tell you about my PL

2334
03:22:19,280 --> 03:22:20,240
so you can go to it.

2335
03:22:20,240 --> 03:22:21,080
I tell you about my PL

2336
03:22:21,080 --> 03:22:24,000
so you can just get an insight into who I am as a person,

2337
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:24,840
you know?

2338
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:27,420
Do most VTubers archive their PLs?

2339
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:28,520
Yes, they do.

2340
03:22:28,520 --> 03:22:30,720
Most of them delete everything.

2341
03:22:30,720 --> 03:22:32,240
I deleted everything.

2342
03:22:33,120 --> 03:22:35,360
I deleted my entire Twitch channel.

2343
03:22:37,160 --> 03:22:38,840
What are my cats doing?

2344
03:22:38,840 --> 03:22:41,080
Let me get some micropinkies.

2345
03:22:42,240 --> 03:22:43,320
What are you up to?

2346
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:46,040
What are you doing?

2347
03:22:46,040 --> 03:22:47,640
Are you on rena?

2348
03:22:49,480 --> 03:22:51,080
What are you up to?

2349
03:22:51,080 --> 03:22:52,320
Why are you on my dresser?

2350
03:22:55,600 --> 03:22:57,160
Is Boomi bothering you still?

2351
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:01,440
She's like, up on my dresser and Boomi's below it,

2352
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:02,960
like, ha, ha, I'm gonna get her.

2353
03:23:06,720 --> 03:23:08,120
Why won't you bring yourself?

2354
03:23:10,800 --> 03:23:13,520
Old lady, I don't need you falling off my dresser.

2355
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:15,080
Boomi, leave her alone.

2356
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:20,840
It's cookie time.

2357
03:23:27,160 --> 03:23:29,480
Boomi, I'm not full blooded.

2358
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:37,080
Boomi, I'm not full blooded.

2359
03:23:42,440 --> 03:23:44,440
I'm gonna get a cup for some milk.

2360
03:23:46,440 --> 03:23:47,960
He needs some milk.

2361
03:23:57,160 --> 03:23:58,000
Boomi.

2362
03:24:20,920 --> 03:24:22,320
Fia is still even.

2363
03:24:23,280 --> 03:24:24,440
Oh, thank you, Recoma.

2364
03:24:27,160 --> 03:24:30,920
What did I, where did I go?

2365
03:24:30,920 --> 03:24:34,840
I just, until you're, until you're 90.

2366
03:24:34,840 --> 03:24:36,840
That was such a good one.

2367
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:38,360
Yeah, your PL was on Twitch, I remember you saying

2368
03:24:38,360 --> 03:24:39,480
something about wanting to do.

2369
03:24:39,480 --> 03:24:42,720
Yeah, I wish, I wish there was like channel points

2370
03:24:42,720 --> 03:24:44,240
or like animated emotes, yeah.

2371
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:56,440
You know, it's like a relationship.

2372
03:24:56,440 --> 03:24:57,520
You need to, you know, I'm gonna,

2373
03:24:57,520 --> 03:24:59,760
I'm gonna open up to you and be vulnerable about my past,

2374
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:00,600
you know?

2375
03:25:01,480 --> 03:25:02,480
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2376
03:25:18,160 --> 03:25:20,920
I'm not gonna talk about anime, I'm gonna finish this.

2377
03:25:20,920 --> 03:25:23,660
Don't, don't do this to me.

2378
03:25:27,440 --> 03:25:31,040
Oh my God, you guys are so good.

2379
03:25:36,280 --> 03:25:37,680
Bye, have a good night.

2380
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:45,080
Don't get too close to, this is already limited.

2381
03:25:45,080 --> 03:25:47,200
I'm not even gonna bother appealing this.

2382
03:25:56,440 --> 03:26:01,440
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna.

2383
03:26:04,660 --> 03:26:05,580
Night, night.

2384
03:26:17,280 --> 03:26:18,280
Oh, shit slapped.

2385
03:26:27,440 --> 03:26:30,680
Guys, it's, it's lactose-free milk, it's fine.

2386
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:46,120
Not, I'm not, I'm not hurting myself with drinking this milk.

2387
03:26:57,440 --> 03:26:59,000
It's lactate milk.

2388
03:27:05,760 --> 03:27:07,760
Mm-hmm, guys just hear me eating a cookie

2389
03:27:07,760 --> 03:27:09,360
when I put my background music on.

2390
03:27:11,760 --> 03:27:14,160
You can hear my, you hear me eat a cookie with jazz.

2391
03:27:26,560 --> 03:27:28,120
I'm numb, numb, numb, numb, numb.

2392
03:27:28,120 --> 03:27:29,400
That is yo-so.

2393
03:27:30,920 --> 03:27:35,480
Do you wanna know the secret to having like good cookies?

2394
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:40,280
Almost like perfectly circular, like,

2395
03:27:40,280 --> 03:27:42,240
tall house cookies.

2396
03:27:42,240 --> 03:27:44,780
So you wanna roll it in a ball.

2397
03:27:46,560 --> 03:27:48,240
It is double.

2398
03:27:48,240 --> 03:27:50,280
You wanna roll it in a ball

2399
03:27:50,280 --> 03:27:51,920
and then flatten it in your palm.

2400
03:27:51,920 --> 03:27:53,800
And then when you put it on the cookie pan

2401
03:27:53,800 --> 03:27:55,720
or the sheet or whatever you're using,

2402
03:27:57,120 --> 03:28:02,120
you want to press your thumb into the center.

2403
03:28:06,120 --> 03:28:08,320
Nope, I'm losing my cookie and my milk, no.

2404
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:15,000
Mm-hmm.

2405
03:28:22,680 --> 03:28:24,680
Lost a piece of my cookie, ready to go.

2406
03:28:26,440 --> 03:28:27,280
Okay.

2407
03:28:33,920 --> 03:28:34,760
How does that work?

2408
03:28:34,760 --> 03:28:36,640
Have you never seen thumbprint cookies?

2409
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:40,200
That's an eating cookie dough, delicious.

2410
03:28:43,280 --> 03:28:44,120
Oh, there it is.

2411
03:28:53,520 --> 03:28:55,120
It's for, well, it's so that it.

2412
03:28:56,440 --> 03:28:59,440
It's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2413
03:28:59,440 --> 03:29:02,440

2414
03:29:02,440 --> 03:29:04,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2415
03:29:04,440 --> 03:29:06,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2416
03:29:06,440 --> 03:29:08,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2417
03:29:08,440 --> 03:29:10,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2418
03:29:10,440 --> 03:29:12,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2419
03:29:12,440 --> 03:29:14,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2420
03:29:14,440 --> 03:29:18,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2421
03:29:29,440 --> 03:29:32,440
it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for,

2422
03:29:35,440 --> 03:29:38,440
well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for,

2423
03:29:38,440 --> 03:29:41,440
well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's

2424
03:29:41,440 --> 03:29:43,440
for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well, it's for, well,

2425
03:29:43,440 --> 03:29:52,720
Why does it keep doing that? It's something, it's like my, I'm wondering if my, what's it called?

2426
03:29:53,680 --> 03:30:03,040
My extension cord cable thing is like just not working. I think it keeps dying. It's not the XLR

2427
03:30:03,040 --> 03:30:10,960
cable. It's not the XLR cable. I think it's what powers the GoXLR. Because the GoXLR itself is

2428
03:30:10,960 --> 03:30:21,040
shutting off. It's not the XLR cable. That's so weird. I'm going to be quiet for a second.

2429
03:30:22,400 --> 03:30:24,080
It'll fix itself in a second.

2430
03:30:26,320 --> 03:30:27,680
After restart the app.

2431
03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:46,960
There you go. Yeah, no, it's definitely, I'm pretty sure it's the cable, it's the power cable

2432
03:30:46,960 --> 03:30:54,880
to the GoXLR that's actually going out. I don't know how, but it's whatever. Because if I bump

2433
03:30:54,880 --> 03:31:04,160
my extension cord thing.

2434
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:35,440
Yep, it's definitely the power cable. Okay. So let me, I think I fixed it. I think it got like

2435
03:31:35,440 --> 03:31:40,480
kind of pulled out. I think that's what it was. I'm wondering if the cats were playing under

2436
03:31:40,480 --> 03:31:45,040
my desk and it was kind of pulled out because I just pushed it in and it kind of gave more than I

2437
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:48,000
thought it would. Let me do this again.

2438
03:31:48,000 --> 03:32:07,440
Do you know where the idiot is? That's right. It's in the mirror when you look at it.

2439
03:32:09,680 --> 03:32:16,400
Okay. Oh, let's finish this. I'm curious how many people got watching me right now.

2440
03:32:18,080 --> 03:32:21,040
128 people are watching me be dumb. That's cute.

2441
03:32:25,520 --> 03:32:32,560
It's me. It's you. I'm a vampire, no reflection, impressive.

2442
03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:43,600
But don't you know, madam? The bird is the word. Sorry. All right, let's finish this

2443
03:32:43,920 --> 03:32:47,200
because we only got like four freaking chapters left.

2444
03:32:51,360 --> 03:32:57,760
Yeah, five. Wow, that was a while ago. Okay, I'm walking in.

2445
03:33:04,720 --> 03:33:10,400
I woke up into Norse's office on a special goff, wait, I should probably change my outfit.

2446
03:33:10,400 --> 03:33:17,360
Hold on. Let me slip into something more comfortable.

2447
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:31,680
Well, this is awkward.

2448
03:33:41,280 --> 03:33:44,880
Ignore the floating ring.

2449
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:53,360
No, wait, this isn't the right outfit.

2450
03:33:56,400 --> 03:34:14,320
Made a shibbony? Why am I my bazonka hunker? So huge. There you go. Made shibbony?

2451
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:18,560
Can I please put this away?

2452
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:28,080
Where is it? Here it is.

2453
03:34:36,000 --> 03:34:43,360
Shibbony? Who's Shibbony? You know what? You're gonna be able to see through my hoodie. I don't care.

2454
03:34:43,600 --> 03:34:52,800
Shibbony?

2455
03:34:52,800 --> 03:35:07,520
Oh my god. Sorry, I'm laughing at discord messages.

2456
03:35:08,080 --> 03:35:12,160
Marcy is a hoot. All right.

2457
03:35:27,520 --> 03:35:29,680
It's good air flow. Good air flow.

2458
03:35:30,400 --> 03:35:38,800
Um, I woke up into Norse's office on a special goffin coffin.

2459
03:35:38,800 --> 03:35:45,920
Harigrid was in the bed opposite of me in a comma because vampire and dra- oh, let me run my tongue over. What?

2460
03:35:46,880 --> 03:36:01,840
I had I had the desktop audio turned off because my BGM is playing is doubling up, but like

2461
03:36:03,360 --> 03:36:10,400
let me fix that actually. That's let me let me run my tongue along that head. God damn.

2462
03:36:11,360 --> 03:36:15,600
Uh, all right, bet. Go for it.

2463
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:20,000
I'm waiting.

2464
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:36,400
Go on, give it a lick.

2465
03:36:41,120 --> 03:36:43,040
Malone?

2466
03:36:47,920 --> 03:36:51,760
Licks it up. Thank you for the for the donut. Wait, did I get any other ones?

2467
03:36:52,720 --> 03:36:59,200
Let me take a peek. I haven't been looking. I never tweeted I was live.

2468
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:11,920
LOL, it's fine. I don't know. The real ones are here. The real the real ones only the real ones be here.

2469
03:37:11,920 --> 03:37:15,120
The real ones who actually love me or do they? I don't know.

2470
03:37:15,520 --> 03:37:23,520
Okay.

2471
03:37:27,920 --> 03:37:32,080
$5 tip from anonymous and they didn't say anything. What's up with that?

2472
03:37:34,800 --> 03:37:37,520
Well, thank you. Ain't no ni moose.

2473
03:37:46,080 --> 03:37:46,640
Whoa.

2474
03:37:49,760 --> 03:37:50,880
Arm is itchy.

2475
03:37:54,240 --> 03:38:01,760
The Anani moose. I remember when I first started. Wait, no, should I say this story?

2476
03:38:04,400 --> 03:38:06,560
Wait, I have to see if that account still exists.

2477
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:41,120
I remember when I first decided that I was going to be a streamer. I made my name Anani mouse.

2478
03:38:41,360 --> 03:38:53,840
But I was with like two O's. So I was like moose. So I was a mouse with moose horns.

2479
03:38:55,600 --> 03:38:59,120
Yeah, you're never getting to my shut up.

2480
03:39:02,960 --> 03:39:03,440
Shut up.

2481
03:39:04,320 --> 03:39:12,400
Shut up. My BGM is so loud and none of you guys said anything.

2482
03:39:15,360 --> 03:39:17,920
But I was also looked like I looked like a stickman.

2483
03:39:18,720 --> 03:39:22,000
But like, no, it wasn't like a stickman. It was like, you know, it was like,

2484
03:39:22,000 --> 03:39:27,760
it was like gray and white blob people that were like on new grounds a lot. I don't know.

2485
03:39:27,760 --> 03:39:30,880
I don't really know if that makes any sense. I don't know what they're called.

2486
03:39:34,160 --> 03:39:38,320
And I looked like a hentai protagonist because I didn't have a face.

2487
03:39:39,760 --> 03:39:46,320
And I remember I was playing the witch's house was my first first thing. Tankman, maybe.

2488
03:39:47,040 --> 03:39:49,840
All right, let me focus. Let me focus up. We're focusing up.

2489
03:39:51,520 --> 03:39:55,600
Fix my fucking pillow. This pillow sucks.

2490
03:39:55,840 --> 03:40:07,200
Oh, me Satan, what happened? Oh, me Satan, what happened? I screamed.

2491
03:40:07,200 --> 03:40:10,560
Suddenly, Voldemort came. He looks less mean than usual.

2492
03:40:11,520 --> 03:40:14,640
Get the fuck out, you fucking bastard. I yielded.

2493
03:40:15,200 --> 03:40:20,720
Thou hath not killed the vampire yet. He said angrily.

2494
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:23,840
Suddenly started to cry tears of blood all selective.

2495
03:40:24,640 --> 03:40:28,160
Voldemort. Oh, I'm FG. What's wrong? I asked.

2496
03:40:28,880 --> 03:40:32,160
Suddenly, Lucy and Professor Sinister and Sirius came.

2497
03:40:32,720 --> 03:40:37,440
Bloody Mary and Vampire were with them. Everyone was holding black boxes.

2498
03:40:38,400 --> 03:40:40,320
Voldemort disappeared.

2499
03:40:42,800 --> 03:40:48,800
Old MFG. No, but you're alive. Scrim to Vampire. I hugged him in Bloody Mary.

2500
03:40:49,760 --> 03:40:55,840
What the fuck happened? I asked them. Sorry, I'm rubbing my eye with a frick itchy.

2501
03:40:57,920 --> 03:41:00,880
Oh, my Satan, am I like dead now? I gossiped.

2502
03:41:01,520 --> 03:41:04,160
And no, be you're almost shot.

2503
03:41:04,160 --> 03:41:09,120
Said Sirius, but the bullet could not kill you since you were from another time.

2504
03:41:09,120 --> 03:41:10,640
That's not how that works.

2505
03:41:12,240 --> 03:41:16,080
This is Shibani. Hi, I'm Shibani. I'm Shibi's niece.

2506
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:20,800
Should I put a disclaimer of that? Hello, I'm Shibi's niece.

2507
03:41:23,360 --> 03:41:27,200
I'm gothic, as you can tell. I'm extremely gothic.

2508
03:41:28,320 --> 03:41:29,440
Gothic, if you will.

2509
03:41:35,600 --> 03:41:40,720
But fangs anyway, said Lucy and holding Otis arm. I gasped. He had two arms.

2510
03:41:41,520 --> 03:41:45,200
Omg, I can't believe Vampire's dad shot you, I gasped.

2511
03:41:46,560 --> 03:41:52,000
Well, to be honest, Snap was possessed by Snap back then.

2512
03:41:52,000 --> 03:41:53,840
What? Said James.

2513
03:41:53,840 --> 03:41:58,240
Yeah, he was a spy. Sirius said sadly, he was really a death dealer.

2514
03:41:59,360 --> 03:42:01,680
And he was such a fucking poser.

2515
03:42:01,680 --> 03:42:07,360
Said Lucy and he didn't even really know who GC were until I told him.

2516
03:42:08,320 --> 03:42:12,080
Well, anyone, anyway, everyone started to give me presents.

2517
03:42:12,640 --> 03:42:15,680
Why would they give? She's sick. She almost gets shot and she...

2518
03:42:17,760 --> 03:42:21,440
Nothing even happened to her. She didn't even get shot and they're giving her presents.

2519
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:28,000
I was opening a black box with red 666s. There was a DVD.

2520
03:42:29,840 --> 03:42:31,680
Oh my god, how old is this?

2521
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:35,840
I haven't even, what's a DVD? What's that?

2522
03:42:36,720 --> 03:42:40,320
Of Corpse Bride? Like Corpse, like Marine Cor...

2523
03:42:40,320 --> 03:42:44,320
Cor Bride, actually, in it, on it, when I gasped.

2524
03:42:44,320 --> 03:42:48,640
Mr. Norris locked up angrily because he hated Goths. What is he doing there?

2525
03:42:51,440 --> 03:42:55,520
Has anyone seen Draco? I asked gothically.

2526
03:42:57,840 --> 03:43:04,080
No, Draco told me he would be watching Hoes of Wax, Hoes of Wax.

2527
03:43:04,080 --> 03:43:07,600
Said Professor Trevlery. He doesn't know that's your better.

2528
03:43:07,600 --> 03:43:10,160
Anyway, the Norris said you could get up. Come on.

2529
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:12,720
I got up suicidally.

2530
03:43:13,440 --> 03:43:18,400
Lucy and... what? Lucy and Sirius and Professor Sinister left.

2531
03:43:21,040 --> 03:43:22,240
Sorry, I had a fart.

2532
03:43:22,240 --> 03:43:25,680
I was wearing a black leather night gun. Night gun?

2533
03:43:26,880 --> 03:43:31,440
Under that, I had on a sexy black leather bra trimmed with black lace,

2534
03:43:31,440 --> 03:43:37,120
a black with a matching thong that's a gothic girl on the butt and sexy fishnet.

2535
03:43:37,120 --> 03:43:41,200
You know, I want to cosplay as one of these outfits so bad.

2536
03:43:43,280 --> 03:43:43,920
So bad.

2537
03:43:45,520 --> 03:43:48,720
Like if somebody can find me a thong that says gothic girl on the butt

2538
03:43:48,720 --> 03:43:51,600
and sexy fishnets that kind of hooked on my thong.

2539
03:43:52,160 --> 03:43:54,640
If you don't get the idea, massage me, I'll tell you.

2540
03:43:55,360 --> 03:43:56,480
So, a garter.

2541
03:43:56,480 --> 03:44:00,480
I put on a black fishnet top under a black MCR shirt,

2542
03:44:00,480 --> 03:44:05,280
a black leather mini with black lace and congress shoes, not converse congress.

2543
03:44:06,160 --> 03:44:10,320
I left the hospital's wings with Bloody Mary, Willow and Vampire.

2544
03:44:12,320 --> 03:44:13,440
OMFG!

2545
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:15,120
Let's celebrate!

2546
03:44:16,400 --> 03:44:17,600
Let's gas little.

2547
03:44:17,600 --> 03:44:20,880
We can go see House of Wax with Drake.

2548
03:44:20,880 --> 03:44:24,240
Wait, we can go see House of Wax with Drake.

2549
03:44:24,240 --> 03:44:25,680
House of Wax with Draco.

2550
03:44:27,040 --> 03:44:28,160
Hey, Gold Vampire.

2551
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:32,720
Let's go listen to GC and cut ourselves.

2552
03:44:32,720 --> 03:44:34,800
666 at Hermione.

2553
03:44:35,440 --> 03:44:40,320
We opened a common room door sexily, and then I gasped.

2554
03:44:41,360 --> 03:44:44,560
Draco was there doing it with Snap?

2555
03:44:45,760 --> 03:44:50,320
He was wearing a black shirt with 666 under front and baggy jeans.

2556
03:44:50,320 --> 03:44:52,160
You fucking prep.

2557
03:44:52,160 --> 03:44:54,080
We all yielded angrily.

2558
03:44:54,160 --> 03:44:55,680
Yeah, you betrayed us.

2559
03:44:55,680 --> 03:44:57,120
Wait, yeah, you betrayed us.

2560
03:44:57,840 --> 03:45:00,400
Shooted Vampire angrily as he took out his black gun.

2561
03:45:02,160 --> 03:45:03,600
No, you don't understand.

2562
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:07,440
No, you don't understand.

2563
03:45:07,440 --> 03:45:10,400
Screamed Draco sadly as he took his thingy out of snakes.

2564
03:45:10,400 --> 03:45:11,760
Wait, are they docking?

2565
03:45:12,400 --> 03:45:15,760
No shit, you fucking suck, you preppy bastard.

2566
03:45:15,760 --> 03:45:17,600
Said Willow, trying to attack him.

2567
03:45:17,600 --> 03:45:18,720
You rock girl.

2568
03:45:18,720 --> 03:45:20,480
I ran suicidally to my room.

2569
03:45:20,480 --> 03:45:22,080
I sexily took the stake out.

2570
03:45:23,040 --> 03:45:24,000
And no bean.

2571
03:45:24,720 --> 03:45:26,240
And no bean, no.

2572
03:45:26,240 --> 03:45:27,600
And no bean, no.

2573
03:45:27,600 --> 03:45:29,600
Screamed Draco, but it was too late.

2574
03:45:29,600 --> 03:45:32,080
I slit my wrist with it.

2575
03:45:32,080 --> 03:45:33,840
Suddenly everything went black again.

2576
03:45:36,640 --> 03:45:37,040
What?

2577
03:45:39,040 --> 03:45:41,200
I'm sorry, I'm looking at all your reactions now.

2578
03:45:41,600 --> 03:45:52,720
I don't know what just happened.

2579
03:45:52,720 --> 03:45:53,200
I don't know.

2580
03:45:59,840 --> 03:46:00,720
Chapter 40.

2581
03:46:00,720 --> 03:46:02,800
Wait, this is the same thing.

2582
03:46:02,800 --> 03:46:10,800
Chapter 41.

2583
03:46:12,000 --> 03:46:15,120
She talks about and the authors know how she knows somebody hacked her.

2584
03:46:15,120 --> 03:46:16,000
Oh wait, hold on.

2585
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:18,400
I need, I need to cover Jacob's stupid face.

2586
03:46:19,920 --> 03:46:20,720
Let's just scroll down.

2587
03:46:22,720 --> 03:46:25,280
When I woke up, I was in a strange room.

2588
03:46:26,720 --> 03:46:27,680
I looked around.

2589
03:46:28,240 --> 03:46:29,280
I looked around.

2590
03:46:29,840 --> 03:46:32,240
I was wearing the same outfits I had

2591
03:46:32,240 --> 03:46:36,160
when is performed with X black X tier X.

2592
03:46:36,880 --> 03:46:38,240
I looked around confusingly.

2593
03:46:38,240 --> 03:46:41,360
It was a nurse office, but it looks different on the.

2594
03:46:42,560 --> 03:46:45,040
Well, sorry, I read ahead because I got confused.

2595
03:46:45,040 --> 03:46:48,640
On the wall, it was a pink of Marilyn Munson.

2596
03:46:48,640 --> 03:46:51,360
Just imagine that he is an 80s Gothic band too.

2597
03:46:51,360 --> 03:46:51,760
Okay.

2598
03:46:51,760 --> 03:46:56,320
He is more old than panic at the disco or MCR.

2599
03:46:57,360 --> 03:47:00,800
There was also a Gothic black Beatles.

2600
03:47:00,800 --> 03:47:05,040
She's just like, let me just think of 80s, although Beatles isn't even 80s.

2601
03:47:06,960 --> 03:47:11,600
This make them emo Beatles calendar with the picture of the Beatles wearing

2602
03:47:11,600 --> 03:47:13,600
eyeliner and black clothes on it.

2603
03:47:13,600 --> 03:47:14,800
So 1980.

2604
03:47:15,760 --> 03:47:16,960
Can you guess where we are?

2605
03:47:16,960 --> 03:47:18,320
We're in the 1980s.

2606
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:20,960
Oh, I'm FG.

2607
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:22,400
I'm back in Tim again.

2608
03:47:23,680 --> 03:47:24,560
Oh, I'm FG.

2609
03:47:24,560 --> 03:47:26,240
I'm back in Tim again.

2610
03:47:26,240 --> 03:47:27,600
I screamed loudly.

2611
03:47:27,600 --> 03:47:28,880
Suddenly Satan.

2612
03:47:28,880 --> 03:47:32,160
This is actually Voldemort for photo reference.

2613
03:47:32,160 --> 03:47:34,800
Oh, she had a photo reference too, but I'll never see it.

2614
03:47:34,800 --> 03:47:39,600
Voldemort was wearing black leather Jackson black tight jeans, fishnet pants.

2615
03:47:39,600 --> 03:47:40,800
He looks so sexy.

2616
03:47:40,800 --> 03:47:42,000
I almost had an orgy.

2617
03:47:43,120 --> 03:47:44,320
I wish I had that ability.

2618
03:47:44,320 --> 03:47:47,120
I hope I wish I could just like look at someone and just be like, wow, they're so

2619
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:49,680
sexy and just hands-free organ.

2620
03:47:49,680 --> 03:47:50,480
I'd be pretty sick.

2621
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:54,560
This is some very deep Harry Potter lore.

2622
03:47:55,360 --> 03:47:58,720
Oh, yeah.

2623
03:47:58,720 --> 03:48:00,560
I'm okay for your information.

2624
03:48:00,560 --> 03:48:02,640
Oh, oh, I'm FG.

2625
03:48:02,640 --> 03:48:04,160
And no, be are you okay?

2626
03:48:04,160 --> 03:48:05,280
He asked gothically.

2627
03:48:05,920 --> 03:48:08,480
Yeah, I'm okay for your information.

2628
03:48:08,480 --> 03:48:09,600
I snapped sexily.

2629
03:48:10,480 --> 03:48:11,040
Oh, I'm G.

2630
03:48:11,040 --> 03:48:11,600
Am I dead?

2631
03:48:12,160 --> 03:48:15,040
Because I remembered I jumped in front of the bullet from James Gunn.

2632
03:48:15,920 --> 03:48:19,040
Also remembered seeing Draco doing it with snap.

2633
03:48:20,080 --> 03:48:24,080
I guess that's when I had slipped my wrist and went back in Tim instead of dying.

2634
03:48:24,880 --> 03:48:27,600
I know I could go forward in Tim time.

2635
03:48:27,600 --> 03:48:27,920
Wow.

2636
03:48:27,920 --> 03:48:28,960
I'm so used to saying Tim.

2637
03:48:30,480 --> 03:48:31,520
I didn't say time.

2638
03:48:32,080 --> 03:48:35,040
I found a time toner or the Tim machine.

2639
03:48:36,640 --> 03:48:38,080
No, you're not dead.

2640
03:48:38,080 --> 03:48:39,440
Saying reassured suicide.

2641
03:48:39,440 --> 03:48:40,960
A lazy smocked a cigarette.

2642
03:48:40,960 --> 03:48:42,880
Sexly and smoke came all over his face.

2643
03:48:43,520 --> 03:48:44,320
You're a vampire.

2644
03:48:44,320 --> 03:48:46,080
So you can't die from a bullet.

2645
03:48:46,080 --> 03:48:46,960
Yeah, duh.

2646
03:48:46,960 --> 03:48:47,360
Hello.

2647
03:48:48,400 --> 03:48:48,800
Hello.

2648
03:48:49,840 --> 03:48:50,720
That's a good point.

2649
03:48:51,360 --> 03:48:52,480
What the hell is he in?

2650
03:48:52,480 --> 03:48:53,120
That's a good point.

2651
03:48:53,120 --> 03:48:54,720
It doesn't even matter if it was from another time.

2652
03:48:54,720 --> 03:48:56,240
I'm a freaking vampire.

2653
03:48:56,880 --> 03:48:57,600
Come on now.

2654
03:48:57,600 --> 03:49:01,200
Let's go see how Harry's dad is doing.

2655
03:49:01,200 --> 03:49:02,400
How does he know he's...

2656
03:49:02,400 --> 03:49:02,800
Okay.

2657
03:49:04,960 --> 03:49:05,440
I don't know.

2658
03:49:11,200 --> 03:49:13,360
Draco going crazy on Pokemon Snap.

2659
03:49:18,080 --> 03:49:21,840
I know that the real reason I didn't die from the ballet

2660
03:49:21,840 --> 03:49:23,520
was because I was from the future.

2661
03:49:24,080 --> 03:49:24,880
WTF.

2662
03:49:25,680 --> 03:49:28,320
James also almost shot Lucius.

2663
03:49:29,040 --> 03:49:30,800
I said Indigoli.

2664
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:34,560
I know that James had really been possessed,

2665
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:36,560
but I didn't want him to know how I knew.

2666
03:49:38,960 --> 03:49:39,920
Yeah, I know.

2667
03:49:39,920 --> 03:49:40,880
But he had a headache.

2668
03:49:40,880 --> 03:49:42,400
He was under a lot of stress.

2669
03:49:43,120 --> 03:49:43,440
Sorry.

2670
03:49:44,480 --> 03:49:45,040
Yeah, I know.

2671
03:49:45,040 --> 03:49:46,000
But he had a headache.

2672
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:47,360
He was under a lot of stress.

2673
03:49:47,920 --> 03:49:49,200
Satan reasoned evilly.

2674
03:49:50,000 --> 03:49:51,120
I guess that's okay.

2675
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:54,560
I said, because James had a really shot Lucian.

2676
03:49:55,520 --> 03:49:59,200
Also, I know that Lucian would have had two arms instead of one.

2677
03:50:00,160 --> 03:50:02,560
I walked seductively outside with Satan.

2678
03:50:03,200 --> 03:50:05,920
Suddenly, I saw a whole sexy go...

2679
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:09,760
I saw a totally sexy, gothic bi guy.

2680
03:50:10,400 --> 03:50:12,480
She has the ultimate gaydar.

2681
03:50:12,480 --> 03:50:14,160
She just looks at you and she's like,

2682
03:50:14,160 --> 03:50:15,440
that's a bisexual man.

2683
03:50:16,880 --> 03:50:20,480
He had bletched blonde hair with black streaks up to his ears,

2684
03:50:20,480 --> 03:50:22,560
and he was wearing gothic black liner.

2685
03:50:22,560 --> 03:50:24,160
A black green day shirt.

2686
03:50:24,160 --> 03:50:27,440
It showed Billy Joel with blonde hair since it was the 80s.

2687
03:50:27,440 --> 03:50:30,960
Black congress shoes and black pecky pants.

2688
03:50:30,960 --> 03:50:31,840
He walked in all...

2689
03:50:31,840 --> 03:50:32,400
I need to...

2690
03:50:32,400 --> 03:50:33,200
I don't remember.

2691
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:35,360
I never lived in the 80s,

2692
03:50:35,360 --> 03:50:37,520
but I feel like it was different from this.

2693
03:50:38,240 --> 03:50:41,920
He walked in all sexily, like Gerard Gerardway,

2694
03:50:41,920 --> 03:50:44,560
Gerardway, actually, in the Vido for...

2695
03:50:44,560 --> 03:50:48,720
I don't three you like I did yesterday.

2696
03:50:49,600 --> 03:50:53,200
And you could see a black tear on his face like in that video.

2697
03:50:53,840 --> 03:50:55,120
Did he kill someone?

2698
03:50:55,120 --> 03:50:57,520
Hey, he said I'll quetzly and gothically.

2699
03:50:58,960 --> 03:51:00,320
Who the fuck is that?

2700
03:51:01,120 --> 03:51:04,000
I asked Angley cause I did not snow him.

2701
03:51:06,960 --> 03:51:09,920
This is Hedwig, said Voldemort.

2702
03:51:11,040 --> 03:51:14,000
He used to be an ex black XTX2,

2703
03:51:14,000 --> 03:51:16,080
but he had to drop out cause he broke his arm.

2704
03:51:16,640 --> 03:51:17,280
That sucks.

2705
03:51:18,960 --> 03:51:22,240
What is happening?

2706
03:51:22,240 --> 03:51:23,360
I'm just looking at chat.

2707
03:51:25,280 --> 03:51:26,640
What are you guys talking about?

2708
03:51:28,080 --> 03:51:29,120
I don't know what's happening.

2709
03:51:31,360 --> 03:51:32,240
Oh, no, no, no.

2710
03:51:33,360 --> 03:51:34,320
Hey, Hedwig.

2711
03:51:34,320 --> 03:51:38,000
I said seductively, even though I was not trying to be.

2712
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:39,200
I'm just always seductive.

2713
03:51:39,200 --> 03:51:39,920
I can't help it.

2714
03:51:41,440 --> 03:51:42,320
Oh, well.

2715
03:51:42,320 --> 03:51:43,600
Hi, I know he...

2716
03:51:43,600 --> 03:51:45,200
I don't know a voice to give him.

2717
03:51:45,200 --> 03:51:46,080
That doesn't really matter.

2718
03:51:46,080 --> 03:51:47,760
He's probably not going to talk a lot.

2719
03:51:48,880 --> 03:51:50,880
He answered, but then he ran away

2720
03:51:50,880 --> 03:51:53,120
because he had hair of a magical creature.

2721
03:51:53,120 --> 03:51:54,560
Wait, is he supposed to be Hagrid?

2722
03:51:55,520 --> 03:51:58,240
Or do they make the owl a person?

2723
03:52:00,880 --> 03:52:04,400
Wait, isn't the owl's name Hedwig or whatever?

2724
03:52:05,520 --> 03:52:07,440
Did they make the owl a person?

2725
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:09,520
Did she?

2726
03:52:11,920 --> 03:52:13,840
Is she sexualizing the owl?

2727
03:52:13,840 --> 03:52:15,200
Isn't the owl a girl?

2728
03:52:15,840 --> 03:52:19,360
Isn't the owl in Harry Potter a girl?

2729
03:52:22,480 --> 03:52:24,480
I'm so confused.

2730
03:52:29,120 --> 03:52:31,120
Not the owl.

2731
03:52:31,120 --> 03:52:32,480
Wait, hold on.

2732
03:52:40,480 --> 03:52:42,480
Pet female snowy owl.

2733
03:52:45,520 --> 03:52:50,480
Is this pet female snowy owl?

2734
03:52:57,200 --> 03:52:59,280
Why is the owl a hot guy?

2735
03:53:00,640 --> 03:53:01,120
Whatever.

2736
03:53:02,720 --> 03:53:04,560
He had the hair of a magical creature.

2737
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:05,200
He was humming.

2738
03:53:05,200 --> 03:53:07,040
Welcome to the black parade under his breath.

2739
03:53:07,600 --> 03:53:10,480
I know that is not the 80s, but pretend it is.

2740
03:53:10,480 --> 03:53:10,880
Okay.

2741
03:53:12,080 --> 03:53:14,000
She's like, this is all the music I know.

2742
03:53:14,000 --> 03:53:15,840
I don't know any 80s music.

2743
03:53:17,680 --> 03:53:22,160
Like as if there wasn't like alternative 80s rock bands.

2744
03:53:23,600 --> 03:53:28,880
There was only GC, only Marilyn Manson, only MCR.

2745
03:53:33,120 --> 03:53:34,880
Bye, I said all sexily.

2746
03:53:36,240 --> 03:53:37,360
Dow was Hedwig.

2747
03:53:37,360 --> 03:53:39,440
He used to be my boyfriend, but we broke up,

2748
03:53:40,000 --> 03:53:42,480
Satan says sadly, looking at his black nails.

2749
03:53:43,440 --> 03:53:44,720
Oh, I'm FG.

2750
03:53:44,720 --> 03:53:45,440
I can get you.

2751
03:53:45,440 --> 03:53:48,000
Wait, wait.

2752
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:54,400
So you're telling me that Hedwig is a hot emo man

2753
03:53:55,280 --> 03:54:01,040
who used to date Voldemort, also known as Satan, and they broke up.

2754
03:54:03,600 --> 03:54:07,040
A human defied snowy owl.

2755
03:54:08,880 --> 03:54:09,440
You know what?

2756
03:54:09,440 --> 03:54:11,200
I'm not going to follow this anymore.

2757
03:54:12,000 --> 03:54:14,000
I'm not following that anymore.

2758
03:54:14,000 --> 03:54:14,560
That's fine.

2759
03:54:16,960 --> 03:54:19,600
LMFG, I can get you back together.

2760
03:54:19,600 --> 03:54:23,120
I said fingering something I didn't know was in my pocket.

2761
03:54:23,120 --> 03:54:26,560
A black coot is what we aim for CDO iPod

2762
03:54:27,120 --> 03:54:28,640
that I could take videos with.

2763
03:54:29,200 --> 03:54:29,520
What?

2764
03:54:32,160 --> 03:54:33,680
Can you take a video with an iPod?

2765
03:54:36,320 --> 03:54:38,880
You guys can't tell how much I'm squinting in confusion.

2766
03:54:39,840 --> 03:54:41,120
I don't know when this was made.

2767
03:54:42,320 --> 03:54:45,760
I don't remember what iPods do that I could take videos with

2768
03:54:45,760 --> 03:54:49,360
because does no anyone else know about them.

2769
03:54:49,360 --> 03:54:50,240
They kick ass.

2770
03:54:51,440 --> 03:54:55,040
I don't know if I could trust her thinking the same news existed.

2771
03:54:57,920 --> 03:54:59,440
iPods don't have cameras.

2772
03:55:00,560 --> 03:55:01,120
What about?

2773
03:55:01,120 --> 03:55:04,080
Wasn't there like an iPod touch?

2774
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:07,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2775
03:55:08,480 --> 03:55:10,400
Yeah, I remember my dad had one.

2776
03:55:10,400 --> 03:55:10,720
Yeah.

2777
03:55:14,080 --> 03:55:16,080
And he like, yeah, that's right.

2778
03:55:17,760 --> 03:55:19,200
Now my dad uses Android.

2779
03:55:20,080 --> 03:55:22,320
Huh, I have to ask him why.

2780
03:55:27,200 --> 03:55:30,000
Okay, you can forget about your class for now, Headwig.

2781
03:55:30,000 --> 03:55:31,680
I'm going to show you something great.

2782
03:55:32,560 --> 03:55:34,480
I led them to the Great Hall.

2783
03:55:34,480 --> 03:55:35,040
Come on.

2784
03:55:38,640 --> 03:55:40,320
Come on, you guys.

2785
03:55:42,800 --> 03:55:46,640
Lucien, James, Sirius and Snake or All in the Great Hall.

2786
03:55:46,640 --> 03:55:47,840
Lucien, hold on.

2787
03:55:53,120 --> 03:55:54,000
Sorry, attitude.

2788
03:55:54,960 --> 03:55:56,800
Maybe this milk is not helping me.

2789
03:55:56,800 --> 03:55:58,960
Although it's supposed to be lactose free milk.

2790
03:55:58,960 --> 03:56:00,640
It says lactose free in the bottle.

2791
03:56:04,480 --> 03:56:05,200
She be pleased.

2792
03:56:05,200 --> 03:56:06,160
She be pleased what?

2793
03:56:08,560 --> 03:56:11,360
Please step on me.

2794
03:56:12,560 --> 03:56:15,600
Lucien wouldn't talk with James because he had tried to shoot.

2795
03:56:15,600 --> 03:56:16,800
Yeah, I'd be pretty pissed.

2796
03:56:16,800 --> 03:56:19,280
I wouldn't want to be in the same room with somebody trying to shoot me.

2797
03:56:20,320 --> 03:56:23,440
Go fuck yourself, you fucking douche.

2798
03:56:23,440 --> 03:56:24,720
He shouted at him.

2799
03:56:24,720 --> 03:56:27,840
Draco is never going to be friends with Vampire now.

2800
03:56:27,840 --> 03:56:31,280
Oh, wait, this is the 80s.

2801
03:56:32,080 --> 03:56:38,640
Aren't these, and they're in, they're going to Hogwarts as students.

2802
03:56:38,640 --> 03:56:42,720
Let's say that they're like 18, 17.

2803
03:56:44,080 --> 03:56:50,160
Do they know they're going to have those kids or are they babies in the 80s?

2804
03:56:52,720 --> 03:56:53,680
I don't know.

2805
03:56:53,680 --> 03:56:56,000
Yeah, go fuck, sorry.

2806
03:56:56,000 --> 03:56:58,720
Yeah, go fuck yourself, Samarro.

2807
03:56:58,720 --> 03:56:59,200
Snake.

2808
03:56:59,760 --> 03:57:06,640
Snape agreed, but I knew he was lying because it had been his fault James had almost shot Lucien.

2809
03:57:08,000 --> 03:57:09,920
Be quiet, you guys.

2810
03:57:09,920 --> 03:57:13,440
I said sexily, my plan was working out great.

2811
03:57:14,160 --> 03:57:17,440
Not could make Voldemort good without doing it with him.

2812
03:57:18,080 --> 03:57:20,240
Now Vampire's dad would never die.

2813
03:57:20,960 --> 03:57:26,240
And okay, Satan and Hedwig, you guys can start making out.

2814
03:57:26,240 --> 03:57:29,920
I said, and I started to fill them with the iPod.

2815
03:57:32,480 --> 03:57:34,320
You know how I can get people back together?

2816
03:57:36,400 --> 03:57:37,120
Wow, that's good.

2817
03:57:37,120 --> 03:57:40,480
Something's scottishing because it says Meeplan was working.

2818
03:57:40,480 --> 03:57:41,120
It's great.

2819
03:57:41,120 --> 03:57:44,560
How could I not say that in this scottish accent?

2820
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:47,360
Anytime.

2821
03:57:47,360 --> 03:57:50,400
So you know what, I bet this is what Emmy does.

2822
03:57:50,400 --> 03:57:53,920
She takes out her iPod that she took from the past

2823
03:57:54,880 --> 03:57:59,440
and she holds it up and starts recording two pin pals and the pin pals just start immediately

2824
03:57:59,440 --> 03:58:03,280
making out because that's how that works because we all know how gay the pin pals are.

2825
03:58:12,000 --> 03:58:15,440
Then she, then she, then she, she, to that later.

2826
03:58:15,840 --> 03:58:16,160
Um.

2827
03:58:23,280 --> 03:58:24,000
Cool.

2828
03:58:24,000 --> 03:58:27,440
Said serious as Voldemort and Hedwig started to make out sexily.

2829
03:58:27,440 --> 03:58:30,960
Now I'm just picturing Voldemort and the owl making out.

2830
03:58:30,960 --> 03:58:35,200
We watched as they started to take each other's clothes off sexily.

2831
03:58:35,200 --> 03:58:39,120
Some were a serious snake and Lucy and all watched because they were probably by.

2832
03:58:39,760 --> 03:58:41,680
I knew Snape was by.

2833
03:58:42,320 --> 03:58:49,040
Oh my fucking God, Voldemort, Voldemort, screamed Hedwig as his Glock touched Voldemort's.

2834
03:58:49,040 --> 03:58:49,680
What?

2835
03:58:52,080 --> 03:58:53,120
His what?

2836
03:58:54,480 --> 03:58:55,760
His, his what?

2837
03:58:57,040 --> 03:58:58,160
His Glock?

2838
03:58:58,160 --> 03:59:10,320
But suddenly everything stopped as the door opened and came dumbly door misses Mr. Norris.

2839
03:59:11,280 --> 03:59:13,200
Chapter 42.

2840
03:59:16,800 --> 03:59:20,720
What if he touched Glock, touched, touched Glock's at the range?

2841
03:59:23,040 --> 03:59:26,160
My immortal must have inspired Rowling to reveal Dumbledore was gay.

2842
03:59:26,160 --> 03:59:27,600
I forgot that that was a thing.

2843
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:29,280
I forgot he was gay.

2844
03:59:34,640 --> 03:59:36,720
She's using guns as you.

2845
03:59:36,720 --> 03:59:38,160
Yeah, you can think of it like that.

2846
03:59:38,960 --> 03:59:40,720
What are you?

2847
03:59:40,720 --> 03:59:41,840
I think so.

2848
03:59:41,840 --> 03:59:43,760
I think they did say that.

2849
03:59:43,760 --> 03:59:45,920
Somebody, Jamie, look that up.

2850
03:59:45,920 --> 03:59:46,560
Look that up.

2851
03:59:48,160 --> 03:59:54,080
I sat depressively in Dumbledore's office with Hedwig, Satan, James, Sirius, Snape, and Lucien.

2852
03:59:54,080 --> 03:59:56,560
Dumbledore was sitting in front of us cruelly.

2853
03:59:56,560 --> 03:59:59,040
He looks more young than he did in the future.

2854
03:59:59,040 --> 04:00:02,320
He had taken to iPod away and was now listening to it.

2855
04:00:02,320 --> 04:00:03,520
Wait, what does I forget?

2856
04:00:03,520 --> 04:00:10,320
What is that actor that plays young Dumbledore?

2857
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:15,040
Oh, it's Jude Law.

2858
04:00:15,040 --> 04:00:15,920
Jude Law is pretty cool.

2859
04:00:15,920 --> 04:00:16,960
I liked him in Gadica.

2860
04:00:19,280 --> 04:00:20,000
That's pretty cool.

2861
04:00:21,280 --> 04:00:22,320
Jude Law is pretty cool.

2862
04:00:24,000 --> 04:00:26,400
Wait, this guy, please.

2863
04:00:26,400 --> 04:00:27,440
I'm sorry, I'm watching.

2864
04:00:29,760 --> 04:00:32,640
I just watched The Last Kingdom and this guy's in it.

2865
04:00:32,640 --> 04:00:32,960
I don't know.

2866
04:00:32,960 --> 04:00:37,680
He also plays like an even younger Dumbledore.

2867
04:00:37,680 --> 04:00:38,400
That's interesting.

2868
04:00:40,400 --> 04:00:40,800
All right.

2869
04:00:41,920 --> 04:00:42,720
Last Kingdom is good.

2870
04:00:42,720 --> 04:00:43,520
I'm almost done with it.

2871
04:00:45,680 --> 04:00:46,240
Where was I?

2872
04:00:49,600 --> 04:00:50,800
He did into the future.

2873
04:00:50,800 --> 04:00:55,120
He had taken to iPod away and was now listening to a shitty Avril Lavigne song.

2874
04:00:55,680 --> 04:00:57,520
Is Avril Lavigne not Gothic?

2875
04:00:58,400 --> 04:01:00,080
Avrilene was a scene queen.

2876
04:01:00,080 --> 04:01:01,680
What are you talking about?

2877
04:01:02,560 --> 04:01:06,240
Was I a prep for listening to Avril Lavigne?

2878
04:01:07,040 --> 04:01:08,160
Holy crap.

2879
04:01:08,160 --> 04:01:09,360
Girlfriend was my shit.

2880
04:01:10,160 --> 04:01:11,200
No, she's prep.

2881
04:01:12,480 --> 04:01:12,800
What?

2882
04:01:17,600 --> 04:01:21,120
Yeah, since 2002, Dumbledore has been gay, apparently.

2883
04:01:24,320 --> 04:01:25,280
I guess I'm prep.

2884
04:01:25,280 --> 04:01:26,560
Oh no, my life's a lie.

2885
04:01:31,840 --> 04:01:34,080
What the hell is this anyway?

2886
04:01:34,080 --> 04:01:35,440
He cackled meanly.

2887
04:01:35,440 --> 04:01:38,160
I hope he didn't find out that I was from another time.

2888
04:01:38,160 --> 04:01:42,480
I think if I was the principal and a master magician,

2889
04:01:42,480 --> 04:01:44,800
I think I could tell if somebody was from another time.

2890
04:01:46,080 --> 04:01:48,400
Whatever you do, don't blame Ebony, jerk.

2891
04:01:50,080 --> 04:01:53,520
Yeah, seriously, she was trying to get a headway back together.

2892
04:01:54,080 --> 04:01:56,240
Seriously, I'm just, like, differencing my pitch.

2893
04:01:56,240 --> 04:01:57,600
I don't even care anymore.

2894
04:01:57,600 --> 04:01:58,880
Serious said, deviantly.

2895
04:01:59,360 --> 04:02:01,440
Be quiet, you satanist.

2896
04:02:01,440 --> 04:02:03,040
Dumbledore cockled.

2897
04:02:03,040 --> 04:02:06,080
If you're lucky, I'll probably send you all to Azkaban.

2898
04:02:06,080 --> 04:02:08,160
Akazabans, actually.

2899
04:02:08,160 --> 04:02:11,040
That'll teach you to copulate in the Grey Hall.

2900
04:02:11,040 --> 04:02:14,000
He changed the song into iPod to an in-sync song.

2901
04:02:16,400 --> 04:02:20,400
It's just, like, it's just deadpool dancing in-sync.

2902
04:02:21,600 --> 04:02:28,080
Suddenly, I notice something strong about the iPod.

2903
04:02:28,240 --> 04:02:30,960
It was surely tronging.

2904
04:02:32,640 --> 04:02:33,360
Chonging.

2905
04:02:33,360 --> 04:02:34,560
Dumbledore didn't notice.

2906
04:02:34,560 --> 04:02:36,720
Wait, why is there an iPod in the 80s?

2907
04:02:40,720 --> 04:02:40,960
What?

2908
04:02:41,680 --> 04:02:42,400
Wait a second.

2909
04:02:43,520 --> 04:02:44,880
Why is Dumbledore Southern?

2910
04:02:44,880 --> 04:02:46,240
Because I made him a cowboy.

2911
04:02:47,680 --> 04:02:48,480
He's Southern.

2912
04:02:50,800 --> 04:02:51,840
You're questioning this now?

2913
04:02:51,840 --> 04:02:53,600
I don't know, it just popped into my head.

2914
04:02:53,600 --> 04:02:55,520
I forgot when iPods came out.

2915
04:02:58,640 --> 04:03:00,880
Guys, I have a terrible sense of time and direction.

2916
04:03:01,600 --> 04:03:03,680
I don't even know where I am, who I am anymore.

2917
04:03:04,800 --> 04:03:07,200
You fucking poser.

2918
04:03:07,200 --> 04:03:07,920
I muttoned.

2919
04:03:09,360 --> 04:03:10,960
But you never heard of GC?

2920
04:03:10,960 --> 04:03:11,600
James said.

2921
04:03:12,640 --> 04:03:16,080
No, I knew what the iPod was charging into.

2922
04:03:16,080 --> 04:03:18,240
Morty McFly's Tim Machine.

2923
04:03:19,440 --> 04:03:20,640
Shut up, jumps.

2924
04:03:20,640 --> 04:03:21,920
Draco's dad shouted.

2925
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:24,800
Yeah, shut up.

2926
04:03:24,800 --> 04:03:26,560
Snake said properly.

2927
04:03:26,560 --> 04:03:27,840
Yeah, shut up.

2928
04:03:28,400 --> 04:03:31,840
No, you shut up.

2929
04:03:31,840 --> 04:03:33,200
Dumbledore said Tom.

2930
04:03:33,200 --> 04:03:34,480
Who the fuck is Tom?

2931
04:03:35,920 --> 04:03:38,880
I've had enough of you sighting this in Moscow.

2932
04:03:38,880 --> 04:03:40,480
Shouted Dumbledore spireously.

2933
04:03:41,120 --> 04:03:43,360
Suddenly I grabbed the iPod from him.

2934
04:03:43,360 --> 04:03:46,000
Everyone jump in before it's too late.

2935
04:03:46,000 --> 04:03:47,600
I jumped into it.

2936
04:03:47,600 --> 04:03:48,240
Wait, what?

2937
04:03:50,480 --> 04:03:52,480
But only one other person jumped in.

2938
04:03:52,480 --> 04:03:53,280
It was Satan.

2939
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:53,840
Why would I?

2940
04:03:54,880 --> 04:03:57,360
Why would I want to take these people to the future?

2941
04:03:57,360 --> 04:03:59,280
That's messing with the timeline, bros.

2942
04:03:59,280 --> 04:04:01,200
Does she know anything about timelines?

2943
04:04:02,160 --> 04:04:03,520
She's going to mess up the timeline.

2944
04:04:03,520 --> 04:04:04,800
The TVA is going to come after her.

2945
04:04:06,240 --> 04:04:07,280
You don't do it.

2946
04:04:07,280 --> 04:04:07,680
Wait, no.

2947
04:04:08,320 --> 04:04:10,640
You, you don't her heads.

2948
04:04:11,520 --> 04:04:12,960
You don't her heads.

2949
04:04:12,960 --> 04:04:17,280
Screamed Dumbledore wisely as he went.

2950
04:04:17,280 --> 04:04:18,320
I looked around.

2951
04:04:18,320 --> 04:04:20,720
I was in the Slytherin common room of Satan.

2952
04:04:20,720 --> 04:04:22,640
I was wearing my outfit changed.

2953
04:04:22,640 --> 04:04:26,320
I was wearing a plaid plaid plaid.

2954
04:04:26,400 --> 04:04:31,280
Many skirt with hot pink fishnets, a sexy black MCR corset,

2955
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:35,920
and black stiletto boots with pink pentagrams on them.

2956
04:04:35,920 --> 04:04:38,480
My earrings were black Satanist sins,

2957
04:04:38,480 --> 04:04:42,080
and my raven hair was all around me to my mid-black.

2958
04:04:45,520 --> 04:04:46,400
My mid-black.

2959
04:04:48,800 --> 04:04:51,600
Feel like I had a wig of Voldemort really didn't even touch this.

2960
04:04:54,640 --> 04:04:55,280
Tom Riddle?

2961
04:04:55,280 --> 04:04:56,000
Yeah, that's what I'm like.

2962
04:04:56,000 --> 04:04:57,120
Is that Tom Riddle?

2963
04:04:57,120 --> 04:04:57,520
I don't know.

2964
04:04:59,440 --> 04:05:00,640
Is it, who's Tom?

2965
04:05:00,640 --> 04:05:02,640
I don't, I never watched the Harry Potter,

2966
04:05:02,640 --> 04:05:04,720
I'm only seeing the first Harry Potter movie.

2967
04:05:05,920 --> 04:05:08,560
And I remember they were playing

2968
04:05:10,160 --> 04:05:12,400
one of the Harry Potter movies at school,

2969
04:05:12,400 --> 04:05:14,080
and there was a dementor in it.

2970
04:05:14,080 --> 04:05:15,520
And I was crying really hard,

2971
04:05:15,520 --> 04:05:16,560
and it gave me nightmares.

2972
04:05:16,560 --> 04:05:18,000
And my mom called the school,

2973
04:05:18,000 --> 04:05:18,480
and she said,

2974
04:05:18,480 --> 04:05:20,880
stop showing demonic things to children.

2975
04:05:22,640 --> 04:05:24,880
And then now, and then every time they watched

2976
04:05:24,880 --> 04:05:26,080
a Harry Potter movie,

2977
04:05:26,080 --> 04:05:28,240
I had to get removed from this class.

2978
04:05:30,400 --> 04:05:31,920
I wasn't allowed to watch it.

2979
04:05:31,920 --> 04:05:34,480
I watched Harry Potter in secret, the first one.

2980
04:05:36,000 --> 04:05:37,120
Dementors were terrible.

2981
04:05:37,120 --> 04:05:38,560
Wait, what does a dementor look like again?

2982
04:05:44,960 --> 04:05:47,520
That's actually freaky, bro.

2983
04:05:47,520 --> 04:05:49,440
Like, what?

2984
04:05:50,640 --> 04:05:51,520
That's terrible.

2985
04:05:51,520 --> 04:05:54,080
Why would they show this in a kids movie?

2986
04:05:55,840 --> 04:05:57,200
What even are dementors?

2987
04:06:01,920 --> 04:06:03,600
I don't even know if they just suck your soul out,

2988
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:04,080
you body.

2989
04:06:04,080 --> 04:06:05,360
Are they, are they velar?

2990
04:06:07,760 --> 04:06:09,520
Dementor for velar, when?

2991
04:06:09,520 --> 04:06:10,080
Oh my god.

2992
04:06:11,360 --> 04:06:13,360
A girl in gen two that's like,

2993
04:06:14,560 --> 04:06:17,360
a ghost, like,

2994
04:06:17,360 --> 04:06:18,640
dementor looking thing,

2995
04:06:18,640 --> 04:06:19,760
like Aldrich being,

2996
04:06:19,760 --> 04:06:21,200
and she just sucks the soul out.

2997
04:06:25,840 --> 04:06:28,240
Dementors suck your emotions?

2998
04:06:29,280 --> 04:06:30,400
Or they suck your soul?

2999
04:06:30,400 --> 04:06:30,880
I don't know.

3000
04:06:35,920 --> 04:06:36,640
Be sucky.

3001
04:06:38,400 --> 04:06:39,520
Be sucky, fucky.

3002
04:06:43,520 --> 04:06:44,160
Hey, cool.

3003
04:06:44,160 --> 04:06:45,040
Where is Diz?

3004
04:06:45,040 --> 04:06:46,320
He asked an emo voice.

3005
04:06:47,120 --> 04:06:48,080
This is the future.

3006
04:06:48,080 --> 04:06:50,800
Dumbledore's iPod that he tried to take away for me

3007
04:06:50,800 --> 04:06:53,360
was really also a Tim machine.

3008
04:06:53,360 --> 04:06:54,080
I told him.

3009
04:06:54,880 --> 04:06:56,240
Cool, what's an eyepatch?

3010
04:06:56,240 --> 04:06:56,880
He whimpered.

3011
04:06:59,840 --> 04:07:00,720
He whimpered?

3012
04:07:01,920 --> 04:07:03,760
Cool, what's an eyepatch?

3013
04:07:03,760 --> 04:07:05,200
I don't know, what does a whimper sound like?

3014
04:07:06,800 --> 04:07:08,800
It's something used to listen to music.

3015
04:07:08,800 --> 04:07:10,080
I yacked me.

3016
04:07:10,720 --> 04:07:12,160
I'm not, I don't yap, I yak.

3017
04:07:14,400 --> 04:07:15,680
Oh my fucking god, cool.

3018
04:07:15,680 --> 04:07:17,840
Wait, what's the full letter word for dirt?

3019
04:07:18,800 --> 04:07:20,560
He asked in a sexy voice.

3020
04:07:21,600 --> 04:07:23,120
I guess sand?

3021
04:07:23,120 --> 04:07:24,640
I laid confusedly.

3022
04:07:24,640 --> 04:07:27,440
Yeah, I was just trying to make sure you were still the same person.

3023
04:07:33,840 --> 04:07:36,720
Guys, if I don't, if I'm not acting like myself,

3024
04:07:37,920 --> 04:07:40,560
and you think I've been, my body has been swapped out,

3025
04:07:41,200 --> 04:07:44,320
just ask me what's another for letter word for dirt.

3026
04:07:44,320 --> 04:07:46,080
And if I say sand, it's me.

3027
04:07:46,080 --> 04:07:47,440
That's our code word, okay?

3028
04:07:49,200 --> 04:07:53,680
If I get body snatched and the person doesn't answer properly,

3029
04:07:53,680 --> 04:07:54,480
then you know.

3030
04:07:56,560 --> 04:07:57,600
That's our code word.

3031
04:08:00,800 --> 04:08:03,840
If I ever get swapped out with like a skinwalker,

3032
04:08:06,640 --> 04:08:08,720
suddenly some of my friends walked in.

3033
04:08:10,160 --> 04:08:12,800
Oh my, my god, you're fucking alive.

3034
04:08:12,800 --> 04:08:15,040
So Ginny wearing a black leather jacket,

3035
04:08:15,040 --> 04:08:18,640
black baggy pants, and gothic black from first to last shirt.

3036
04:08:18,640 --> 04:08:21,280
But I explained to her why I was alive.

3037
04:08:21,840 --> 04:08:24,080
Konichiwa, bitch, said Willow.

3038
04:08:24,080 --> 04:08:27,120
She was wearing a black corset showing off her boobs

3039
04:08:27,120 --> 04:08:29,760
with lace all around it and red stripes on it.

3040
04:08:29,760 --> 04:08:33,840
With it, she was wearing a black leather mini skirt.

3041
04:08:33,840 --> 04:08:34,800
Sorry, I don't know why.

3042
04:08:34,800 --> 04:08:37,040
Suddenly a dyslexia reading mini skirt.

3043
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:40,320
Big black boots, white foundation, black eyeliner,

3044
04:08:40,320 --> 04:08:44,560
red shadow, red eyeshadow, and black lipstick.

3045
04:08:44,560 --> 04:08:46,640
It's like when something's written normally,

3046
04:08:46,640 --> 04:08:49,840
I have to reread it because my mind is thinking something's wrong,

3047
04:08:49,840 --> 04:08:51,360
but it's because it's written normally

3048
04:08:51,360 --> 04:08:53,440
and I'm used to not seeing things written normally.

3049
04:08:54,480 --> 04:08:55,840
Cook purse, we need proof of this.

3050
04:08:59,600 --> 04:09:02,960
Hey motherfucker, said Diabolo with his red hair.

3051
04:09:02,960 --> 04:09:05,680
This is Ron Weasley, by the way.

3052
04:09:05,680 --> 04:09:06,640
His name is Diabolo.

3053
04:09:07,760 --> 04:09:09,840
His parents were actually vampires.

3054
04:09:10,640 --> 04:09:11,920
He was kidnapped as a child.

3055
04:09:11,920 --> 04:09:16,000
And I'm not joking, that's the lore in the fan fiction.

3056
04:09:16,000 --> 04:09:18,560
He was wearing a black panic at the disco.

3057
04:09:18,560 --> 04:09:20,480
T-shirt in black baggy pants.

3058
04:09:22,000 --> 04:09:24,320
Hey, who's that, Ebony?

3059
04:09:25,520 --> 04:09:28,960
Bloody Mary questioned as she walked in wearing a black T-shirt

3060
04:09:28,960 --> 04:09:32,560
with a red pentagram on it with lace at the bottom,

3061
04:09:32,560 --> 04:09:36,800
red leather pants with black lace and black stollettos.

3062
04:09:38,640 --> 04:09:40,000
Oh, it's Satan.

3063
04:09:40,000 --> 04:09:42,880
I told her and she nodded knowing the truth.

3064
04:09:42,880 --> 04:09:43,520
She just knows.

3065
04:09:43,520 --> 04:09:45,200
Why would you, why would you know?

3066
04:09:46,160 --> 04:09:47,040
How would you know that?

3067
04:09:47,600 --> 04:09:49,120
Suddenly, Satan started to cry.

3068
04:09:49,760 --> 04:09:51,520
Are you okay, Satan?

3069
04:09:51,520 --> 04:09:52,960
We asked concerningly.

3070
04:09:53,840 --> 04:09:56,800
Oh my fucking god, you're from the future.

3071
04:09:56,800 --> 04:09:58,320
What if you don't like me anymore?

3072
04:09:58,320 --> 04:10:01,280
Cause we're, we're from different times.

3073
04:10:01,280 --> 04:10:02,240
He asked.

3074
04:10:02,240 --> 04:10:03,520
No, I still like you.

3075
04:10:03,520 --> 04:10:05,280
I still say, I said sexily to him,

3076
04:10:05,280 --> 04:10:07,120
even though I have a boyfriend and I'm just using him,

3077
04:10:08,240 --> 04:10:08,880
apparently.

3078
04:10:09,520 --> 04:10:10,560
Like what the fuck?

3079
04:10:10,560 --> 04:10:14,160
This is honestly, she's kind of fucked up.

3080
04:10:14,160 --> 04:10:16,320
She's kind of, she's kind of fucked.

3081
04:10:18,000 --> 04:10:18,800
Okay.

3082
04:10:18,800 --> 04:10:19,920
He said reassuredly.

3083
04:10:20,480 --> 04:10:22,720
I let him listen to teenagers.

3084
04:10:22,720 --> 04:10:26,640
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me.

3085
04:10:26,640 --> 04:10:30,800
And I can't care less as long as I live.

3086
04:10:30,800 --> 04:10:34,560
So talk in your clothes and strike a violent pose.

3087
04:10:34,560 --> 04:10:37,840
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.

3088
04:10:38,480 --> 04:10:38,880
All right.

3089
04:10:41,040 --> 04:10:43,200
On my iPod, while I was about to go outside

3090
04:10:43,200 --> 04:10:44,800
to find out some things,

3091
04:10:44,800 --> 04:10:48,000
I gave Diabolo a signal to keep Satan occupied.

3092
04:10:48,000 --> 04:10:49,200
Satan fell asleep.

3093
04:10:49,200 --> 04:10:50,640
I took the iPod.

3094
04:10:50,640 --> 04:10:52,160
I was about to walk outside.

3095
04:10:52,160 --> 04:10:54,000
Professor Sinister ran in.

3096
04:10:54,000 --> 04:10:55,920
She was wearing a Gothic black mini dress

3097
04:10:55,920 --> 04:10:57,760
with depressing blacks, depressing.

3098
04:10:58,640 --> 04:10:59,280
Okay.

3099
04:10:59,280 --> 04:11:02,640
Black stripes and the white and black stripped tights

3100
04:11:02,640 --> 04:11:04,080
in red converse shoes.

3101
04:11:04,080 --> 04:11:06,960
Oh, I'm, I need to buy myself some red converse shoes.

3102
04:11:06,960 --> 04:11:08,160
I missed having a pair of those.

3103
04:11:08,720 --> 04:11:11,920
She was wearing lots of back black illiter.

3104
04:11:11,920 --> 04:11:16,080
I got to let me remember the AMV of the song.

3105
04:11:16,080 --> 04:11:16,800
Dark times.

3106
04:11:16,800 --> 04:11:18,240
You mean great times.

3107
04:11:18,240 --> 04:11:18,880
Bring us back.

3108
04:11:21,520 --> 04:11:24,640
Oh, my fucking, wait, who's talking?

3109
04:11:24,640 --> 04:11:26,080
Oh my fucking God.

3110
04:11:26,080 --> 04:11:26,960
Where is Draco?

3111
04:11:26,960 --> 04:11:28,720
How did Snap get back in here?

3112
04:11:29,360 --> 04:11:32,000
I taught us he was in Azerbaijan.

3113
04:11:32,640 --> 04:11:33,200
Bahian.

3114
04:11:35,040 --> 04:11:36,640
Hian with the J.

3115
04:11:36,640 --> 04:11:39,680
I asked sadly, what's up, gold mask?

3116
04:11:40,400 --> 04:11:43,760
Pet gold mask.

3117
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:51,280
Um, oh, what was that?

3118
04:11:51,280 --> 04:11:54,160
He just like lightly pet my hand with his paw.

3119
04:11:54,160 --> 04:11:54,480
Hi.

3120
04:11:55,120 --> 04:11:56,320
Do you just want love now?

3121
04:11:57,680 --> 04:11:59,120
Are you asking me to go to bed?

3122
04:12:02,800 --> 04:12:04,800
Oh, you just want pets?

3123
04:12:04,800 --> 04:12:07,600
Oh, he's placing his paws on my chair arm

3124
04:12:07,600 --> 04:12:09,280
and he's just looking for pets.

3125
04:12:10,000 --> 04:12:10,480
Hi.

3126
04:12:11,360 --> 04:12:11,840
Hello.

3127
04:12:13,840 --> 04:12:14,960
Pet the puppy.

3128
04:12:14,960 --> 04:12:15,920
Hello, puppy.

3129
04:12:16,720 --> 04:12:18,080
Hello, gold mask.

3130
04:12:18,960 --> 04:12:20,080
What are you sniffing for?

3131
04:12:21,440 --> 04:12:22,400
You're like sniffing.

3132
04:12:23,200 --> 04:12:26,000
It's probably the cup of milk I had.

3133
04:12:30,720 --> 04:12:32,080
I have brain rather.

3134
04:12:33,360 --> 04:12:35,920
Yeah, but I have three dogs.

3135
04:12:35,920 --> 04:12:38,960
Ranala, Melania and gold mask.

3136
04:12:46,320 --> 04:12:47,360
Ebony, I was so...

3137
04:12:48,800 --> 04:12:49,200
What?

3138
04:12:49,200 --> 04:12:49,840
Who's talking?

3139
04:12:51,040 --> 04:12:52,880
Ebony, I was so worried about you,

3140
04:12:52,880 --> 04:12:55,280
but I know you can't fucking die because you're a vampire.

3141
04:12:55,840 --> 04:13:00,080
Snap came back because that girl Brittany freed him.

3142
04:13:00,080 --> 04:13:01,040
I never liked her.

3143
04:13:01,040 --> 04:13:02,160
She was a bad student.

3144
04:13:02,800 --> 04:13:04,560
Trouble reset reassuredly.

3145
04:13:05,520 --> 04:13:06,480
That bitch...

3146
04:13:06,480 --> 04:13:10,640
Wait, Brittany Spears went and freed Snape from Azerbaijan?

3147
04:13:10,640 --> 04:13:11,280
Oh my God.

3148
04:13:12,720 --> 04:13:14,080
Bumi, why are you just standing?

3149
04:13:14,640 --> 04:13:18,800
He's just standing on his hind legs like a scary possessed cat.

3150
04:13:18,800 --> 04:13:19,440
I mean, dog.

3151
04:13:21,200 --> 04:13:23,280
Yeah, why don't you lay in the bed then, big man?

3152
04:13:23,280 --> 04:13:24,160
Why don't you lay down?

3153
04:13:24,960 --> 04:13:25,760
Good boy.

3154
04:13:25,760 --> 04:13:27,200
Oh, good boy.

3155
04:13:27,920 --> 04:13:28,880
Yeah, I gotta call you.

3156
04:13:30,080 --> 04:13:31,840
Oh, I should call you boy in the bed.

3157
04:13:32,800 --> 04:13:35,680
Do your dogs get along with your cats?

3158
04:13:35,680 --> 04:13:37,120
Oh, yeah, amazingly.

3159
04:13:38,400 --> 04:13:39,600
I have three dogs.

3160
04:13:39,600 --> 04:13:41,440
Like guys, I only have three dogs.

3161
04:13:41,440 --> 04:13:42,400
I don't know what you're talking.

3162
04:13:42,400 --> 04:13:43,280
I don't have cats.

3163
04:13:51,600 --> 04:13:52,480
The dogs me out.

3164
04:13:52,480 --> 04:13:54,640
Yeah, they're all I'm filing will.

3165
04:13:58,240 --> 04:14:00,240
Okay, wait.

3166
04:14:01,200 --> 04:14:02,000
That bitch.

3167
04:14:02,000 --> 04:14:04,560
Did she also free Hargrid in Lupin?

3168
04:14:04,560 --> 04:14:05,840
I shouted angrily.

3169
04:14:05,840 --> 04:14:07,840
I hated Brittany because she was the fucking prep.

3170
04:14:08,880 --> 04:14:10,880
Yes, they're on the loose at the school.

3171
04:14:10,880 --> 04:14:12,000
Dumbledore's back.

3172
04:14:12,000 --> 04:14:14,320
Connolly is on his way to help everyone.

3173
04:14:14,320 --> 04:14:17,680
Tell everyone you see to lock themselves inside of their common room.

3174
04:14:18,320 --> 04:14:19,120
Conman room.

3175
04:14:19,680 --> 04:14:20,960
Trouble reset wordly.

3176
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:24,000
Okay, but where's Draco?

3177
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:25,760
How come he was doing it with Snape?

3178
04:14:27,360 --> 04:14:30,160
I don't know why, but he almost tried to commit suicide.

3179
04:14:30,240 --> 04:14:33,680
After he saw it, you almost kill yourself in Minecraft, she said.

3180
04:14:34,880 --> 04:14:37,760
OMG, that's terrible, I guess.

3181
04:14:37,760 --> 04:14:39,520
Satan was still asleep.

3182
04:14:39,520 --> 04:14:40,480
So wait, why?

3183
04:14:42,320 --> 04:14:45,600
Wait, I tried to sweet say it all.

3184
04:14:46,720 --> 04:14:49,200
And so he decides to hook up with Snape.

3185
04:14:50,320 --> 04:14:53,840
And then when I find them, he tries to sweet say it all himself.

3186
04:14:53,840 --> 04:14:54,720
I don't understand.

3187
04:14:56,480 --> 04:14:59,120
I said he was still asleep, so he couldn't tell what was going on.

3188
04:14:59,120 --> 04:15:02,560
Then I said, listen, everyone, I have something impotent to do.

3189
04:15:03,280 --> 04:15:04,960
In hour, everyone stay.

3190
04:15:06,400 --> 04:15:08,000
With that, I ran out.

3191
04:15:08,800 --> 04:15:10,000
Good luck, Tara!

3192
04:15:10,000 --> 04:15:10,800
Everyone cried.

3193
04:15:10,800 --> 04:15:12,160
Who the fuck is Tara?

3194
04:15:13,520 --> 04:15:16,560
I ran sexily down the stairs into the great hall.

3195
04:15:16,560 --> 04:15:20,480
Well, the portraits around me looked at me scaredly.

3196
04:15:20,480 --> 04:15:23,680
There was hardly anyone else in the stairs, and then Tara was an

3197
04:15:23,680 --> 04:15:25,040
epsomosphere of horror.

3198
04:15:25,680 --> 04:15:28,640
On the way, I saw Brittany laughing on the stairs.

3199
04:15:28,640 --> 04:15:31,840
She was wearing a slutty pink shirt with flowers on it.

3200
04:15:31,840 --> 04:15:35,200
Blue jeans skirt, Armoury Cromby, and pink stilettos.

3201
04:15:35,200 --> 04:15:37,200
She looked just like a pentagram.

3202
04:15:37,200 --> 04:15:40,080
I was fucking preps, Hilary Duff, and Lindsay Lohan.

3203
04:15:41,520 --> 04:15:44,240
I remember a pentagram instead of a pent-

3204
04:15:44,240 --> 04:15:47,760
instead of a cross between, it's a pentagram between, because I'm gothic.

3205
04:15:49,440 --> 04:15:49,840
All right.

3206
04:15:51,920 --> 04:15:52,320
All right.

3207
04:15:52,960 --> 04:15:53,920
Terbithia?

3208
04:15:53,920 --> 04:15:54,480
Oh my god.

3209
04:15:56,320 --> 04:15:58,240
You fucking bitch.

3210
04:15:58,240 --> 04:15:59,360
I shouted angrily.

3211
04:16:00,720 --> 04:16:03,200
No, you are totally a bitch.

3212
04:16:03,200 --> 04:16:05,760
No, Voldemort will like totally kill you.

3213
04:16:06,560 --> 04:16:07,120
She laughed.

3214
04:16:09,120 --> 04:16:10,080
Crucious!

3215
04:16:10,080 --> 04:16:14,400
I shouted selectively, pontificating my black wand, and she started screaming

3216
04:16:14,400 --> 04:16:16,960
because she was being tortured, and I laughed so distantly.

3217
04:16:17,840 --> 04:16:19,920
No, help me please.

3218
04:16:21,840 --> 04:16:24,800
I'm a slave for you.

3219
04:16:25,760 --> 04:16:29,200
I put up my middle finger at her in her hand.

3220
04:16:29,200 --> 04:16:34,240
I saw the video camera, Snape and Lumpin, how he used to take the video of me.

3221
04:16:34,240 --> 04:16:38,080
I put the tape of Voldemort doing it with Hedwig onto it.

3222
04:16:38,080 --> 04:16:41,760
Then I just continued around the stairs with the camera.

3223
04:16:41,760 --> 04:16:44,480
When I had reached the Grey Hall, I saw Vampire Potter.

3224
04:16:45,920 --> 04:16:47,200
OMG, Vampira!

3225
04:16:47,840 --> 04:16:48,640
I yielded.

3226
04:16:48,640 --> 04:16:49,760
We hugged each other.

3227
04:16:49,760 --> 04:16:51,840
He each utter happily.

3228
04:16:51,840 --> 04:16:55,680
He lucked at me with his gothic red eyes and spiky black hair.

3229
04:16:55,680 --> 04:16:58,160
Around them were black eyeliner and eye shadow.

3230
04:16:59,200 --> 04:17:00,720
A new product from Apple.

3231
04:17:01,520 --> 04:17:06,000
His, he was wearing a black leather Jackson leather pants,

3232
04:17:06,000 --> 04:17:10,080
a panic at the disco concert shirt, and his black congress shoes.

3233
04:17:10,080 --> 04:17:12,720
He looked more like Joel from Good Charlotte than ever.

3234
04:17:13,600 --> 04:17:16,320
Did you hear their song, The River It Rocks?

3235
04:17:17,120 --> 04:17:24,320
I was so worried you died, you moaned vampire.

3236
04:17:25,360 --> 04:17:27,440
I know, but I'm a vampire lol.

3237
04:17:27,440 --> 04:17:30,000
When I woke up, I was back in 1980.

3238
04:17:30,000 --> 04:17:33,360
So anyway, I brought Voldemort from when he was young with me.

3239
04:17:34,240 --> 04:17:35,440
Where's Draco?

3240
04:17:35,440 --> 04:17:36,400
I asked seriously.

3241
04:17:37,440 --> 04:17:40,560
Draco, you mean that fucking poser who betrayed you?

3242
04:17:42,080 --> 04:17:45,600
Vampir snarkled with anger and a sexy voice.

3243
04:17:46,640 --> 04:17:48,640
I know, but we have to find him.

3244
04:17:49,360 --> 04:17:50,320
I said smarty.

3245
04:17:51,520 --> 04:17:52,560
I'll do it then.

3246
04:17:55,440 --> 04:17:56,160
Wake me up.

3247
04:17:56,160 --> 04:17:58,080
Sorry to do the voice, I have to go wake me up.

3248
04:17:59,520 --> 04:18:00,400
I'll do it then.

3249
04:18:02,720 --> 04:18:03,760
Harry said angstily.

3250
04:18:04,480 --> 04:18:05,600
Okay, I agreed.

3251
04:18:05,600 --> 04:18:07,760
Suddenly all the lights in the room went out.

3252
04:18:07,760 --> 04:18:12,240
And then the dork mark appeared.

3253
04:18:13,360 --> 04:18:14,880
Oh my fucking sight!

3254
04:18:15,440 --> 04:18:16,400
Harry shouted.

3255
04:18:17,600 --> 04:18:20,800
I think Voldemort has arrived.

3256
04:18:20,800 --> 04:18:21,760
I said angstily.

3257
04:18:22,320 --> 04:18:24,960
He's standing right behind me, isn't he?

3258
04:18:27,200 --> 04:18:28,560
Fuck, I have to find Draco.

3259
04:18:28,560 --> 04:18:30,240
I guess we should separate.

3260
04:18:31,360 --> 04:18:32,240
Okay.

3261
04:18:32,240 --> 04:18:34,480
Vampir probably said disapariting.

3262
04:18:34,480 --> 04:18:36,000
Sadly, I ran into the Great Hall.

3263
04:18:36,640 --> 04:18:38,320
Chapter 43.

3264
04:18:39,760 --> 04:18:42,720
Oh my gosh, this is a short chapter and then it's the end guys.

3265
04:18:45,520 --> 04:18:46,480
Can't wake up.

3266
04:18:47,840 --> 04:18:50,560
Careful the eyeshadow doesn't catch fire and burn your eyes out.

3267
04:18:53,200 --> 04:18:55,200
In fact, that's my focus line.

3268
04:18:56,400 --> 04:18:57,520
Wake me up.

3269
04:18:57,520 --> 04:18:58,880
Wake me up inside.

3270
04:18:58,880 --> 04:18:59,760
Can't wake up.

3271
04:19:00,880 --> 04:19:01,920
Save me.

3272
04:19:03,600 --> 04:19:05,600
That's the way I do my goofy voice.

3273
04:19:08,240 --> 04:19:10,720
I walked sexily into the Great Hall.

3274
04:19:10,720 --> 04:19:13,360
It was empty except for one person.

3275
04:19:13,360 --> 04:19:14,400
Draco was there.

3276
04:19:14,400 --> 04:19:18,880
He sat there in deadly bloom in his black 6-6 t-shirt

3277
04:19:18,880 --> 04:19:20,320
in his baggy black pants.

3278
04:19:20,880 --> 04:19:22,160
He had slit his wrist.

3279
04:19:22,160 --> 04:19:23,360
1-1-1.

3280
04:19:23,360 --> 04:19:26,000
I felt mad at him for having sex with Snap,

3281
04:19:26,000 --> 04:19:27,920
but I felt sorry for him.

3282
04:19:27,920 --> 04:19:29,920
He looked just like Gerard Way with his red eyes

3283
04:19:29,920 --> 04:19:30,960
and his pale white face.

3284
04:19:32,320 --> 04:19:34,480
Draco, are you okay?

3285
04:19:35,200 --> 04:19:35,760
I asked.

3286
04:19:37,360 --> 04:19:40,880
Oh, I'm not okay.

3287
04:19:40,880 --> 04:19:42,560
He screamed depressedly.

3288
04:19:42,560 --> 04:19:45,120
I thought that MCR song and I got even more depressed

3289
04:19:45,120 --> 04:19:46,800
because that song always makes me cry.

3290
04:19:47,360 --> 04:19:50,960
I gave him a pot cigarette and he started to smoke.

3291
04:19:51,760 --> 04:19:53,440
What's a pot cigarette?

3292
04:19:54,640 --> 04:19:58,320
Oh, Draco, why did you do it with that faster Snape?

3293
04:19:58,320 --> 04:19:59,600
I asked tearedly.

3294
04:20:01,360 --> 04:20:03,200
Oh, Draco began to say,

3295
04:20:03,200 --> 04:20:06,800
but suddenly Lumpin and Mr. Norris appeared into the room.

3296
04:20:06,800 --> 04:20:07,600
They didn't see us.

3297
04:20:08,400 --> 04:20:13,440
I'm so glad we me and Snape were free, said Lumpin.

3298
04:20:15,680 --> 04:20:17,280
Damn, this wood job would be great

3299
04:20:17,280 --> 04:20:19,040
if it wasn't for the fucking students.

3300
04:20:19,840 --> 04:20:21,120
Mr. Norris agreed.

3301
04:20:22,240 --> 04:20:23,760
Pop a delum!

3302
04:20:25,920 --> 04:20:28,640
I yielded angrily, pointing my wand at them.

3303
04:20:29,360 --> 04:20:32,480
No, Lumpin shouted as chains came on him.

3304
04:20:32,480 --> 04:20:33,520
Mr. Norris ran away.

3305
04:20:34,480 --> 04:20:36,160
He fucking perv.

3306
04:20:37,920 --> 04:20:41,680
I said laughing with depths of evil and depressiveness in my voice.

3307
04:20:42,640 --> 04:20:47,040
Now you have to tell us where Voldemort is or I'm going to torture you.

3308
04:20:48,560 --> 04:20:50,800
I don't know where he is, said Lumpin.

3309
04:20:50,800 --> 04:20:54,080
Suddenly, Satan and Vampire ran into the room.

3310
04:20:54,080 --> 04:20:56,400
Vampire didn't know who Satan was really.

3311
04:20:58,960 --> 04:21:01,680
Oh, my Satan, we were worried about you guys.

3312
04:21:02,400 --> 04:21:04,960
Vampire said, I look sexily at Draco.

3313
04:21:04,960 --> 04:21:08,640
It's his gothic red eyes with contacts.

3314
04:21:08,640 --> 04:21:11,840
Black t-shirt that says, we already discussed what he was wearing earlier.

3315
04:21:11,840 --> 04:21:12,960
Why do we got to do this again?

3316
04:21:13,840 --> 04:21:16,560
It said 666 on it and pale skin like Drardway.

3317
04:21:16,560 --> 04:21:21,120
Vampire with his sexy black hair and red eyes, just like Frank Aero and Satan,

3318
04:21:21,120 --> 04:21:24,480
who looked like just like Brandon Urie then.

3319
04:21:29,200 --> 04:21:30,480
I selectively.

3320
04:21:32,640 --> 04:21:36,480
Took the, it's funny because I just don't think Brandon Urie is attractive at all.

3321
04:21:39,200 --> 04:21:42,880
I selectively took the caramel for my caramel.

3322
04:21:43,680 --> 04:21:46,720
And then I began Frenching Draco's sexily.

3323
04:21:48,960 --> 04:21:49,840
Looping ass.

3324
04:21:49,840 --> 04:21:55,440
Draco began to take off all his clothes and I could see his white sex pack.

3325
04:21:56,080 --> 04:21:59,760
Then Vampire took his own clothes off too.

3326
04:22:00,720 --> 04:22:06,800
Oh, my God, we all began making out together sexily.

3327
04:22:06,800 --> 04:22:11,840
I took off my black leather bra, my black lace thong and the rest of my clothes.

3328
04:22:11,840 --> 04:22:14,880
Everyone took their glocks out.

3329
04:22:15,440 --> 04:22:16,800
Except for me.

3330
04:22:16,800 --> 04:22:18,720
I'm a girl, LOL.

3331
04:22:24,080 --> 04:22:26,400
What the fuck is happening?

3332
04:22:26,400 --> 04:22:31,440
Oh, me, Satan, Draco.

3333
04:22:31,440 --> 04:22:34,640
I screamed as he put his hardness in my thingy.

3334
04:22:34,640 --> 04:22:37,440
Then he did the same thing to Harry.

3335
04:22:37,440 --> 04:22:38,640
I began making out.

3336
04:22:38,640 --> 04:22:41,120
Would you just have a foursome with Satan?

3337
04:22:41,120 --> 04:22:42,240
And he joined in.

3338
04:22:42,240 --> 04:22:43,920
Oh, that's one, one, one.

3339
04:22:44,640 --> 04:22:46,880
Miles cried Vampire.

3340
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:49,440
Oh, Vampire, Vampire.

3341
04:22:49,440 --> 04:22:50,800
I screamed, screamed.

3342
04:22:50,800 --> 04:22:51,680
Oh, Satan.

3343
04:22:52,240 --> 04:22:54,240
Oh, Satan yelled Harry.

3344
04:22:54,240 --> 04:22:55,840
No, yeah, in pleasure.

3345
04:22:57,040 --> 04:22:58,560
Lupin watched in shock.

3346
04:22:58,560 --> 04:23:02,560
We took turns doing torture curses on him because we're all sadists.

3347
04:23:02,560 --> 04:23:08,080
Wait, so we're all just like screwing each other and then we're just torturing Lupin at that, you know?

3348
04:23:11,520 --> 04:23:15,360
You know, if I put it in the frame of like, all right, what if I was like

3349
04:23:16,160 --> 04:23:20,320
with harem and then we were just like torturing someone, you know, I could see it.

3350
04:23:20,320 --> 04:23:21,680
I could, you know, I can get off on that.

3351
04:23:22,320 --> 04:23:29,840
Um, suddenly a big black car that said 666 on the license plate flew straight through the windows

3352
04:23:29,840 --> 04:23:31,200
and Snap was in it.

3353
04:23:33,520 --> 04:23:34,640
Last chapter, guys.

3354
04:23:34,640 --> 04:23:35,600
Last chapter.

3355
04:23:37,920 --> 04:23:39,360
Ignore, ignore Janice.

3356
04:23:43,280 --> 04:23:44,400
That's my car.

3357
04:23:45,200 --> 04:23:47,360
Shouted, shooted Draco angrily.

3358
04:23:47,360 --> 04:23:50,000
But suddenly it was revealed who was in the car.

3359
04:23:50,000 --> 04:23:50,960
It was Snape.

3360
04:23:50,960 --> 04:23:52,560
We already talked about that in the last chapter.

3361
04:23:53,680 --> 04:23:55,600
I shall free you, Lupin.

3362
04:23:55,600 --> 04:24:00,000
But first you must help me kill these idiotic dunderhands.

3363
04:24:01,200 --> 04:24:06,720
He said cruelly from the car and flew circumcising above us.

3364
04:24:07,680 --> 04:24:11,440
Ebony darkness, dementia, Ravenway must be killed.

3365
04:24:12,000 --> 04:24:14,640
Then the dork lord shall never die.

3366
04:24:16,160 --> 04:24:17,840
You fucking prep.

3367
04:24:17,840 --> 04:24:18,720
You'll Draco.

3368
04:24:18,720 --> 04:24:19,920
Then he looked at me sadly.

3369
04:24:20,960 --> 04:24:22,480
I forgot to tell you, Ebony.

3370
04:24:23,040 --> 04:24:24,400
Snape made me do it with him.

3371
04:24:24,960 --> 04:24:28,320
I didn't really have sex with him, but he's a ropist.

3372
04:24:29,520 --> 04:24:30,800
A ropist?

3373
04:24:32,400 --> 04:24:32,800
No.

3374
04:24:36,720 --> 04:24:39,760
We all put on our clothes quickly except Satan.

3375
04:24:39,760 --> 04:24:43,200
We were so scarred, but Satan didn't change.

3376
04:24:43,200 --> 04:24:46,800
Instead, he changed you a man with green eyes, no nose,

3377
04:24:46,800 --> 04:24:48,080
a gray robe and white skin.

3378
04:24:48,800 --> 04:24:52,160
He had changed into Voldemort.

3379
04:24:53,120 --> 04:24:56,000
I knew who that were all along.

3380
04:24:56,000 --> 04:24:57,040
He cackled evilly.

3381
04:24:57,040 --> 04:25:00,880
Wait, did he just technically take advantage of us too?

3382
04:25:00,880 --> 04:25:01,520
Holy crap.

3383
04:25:01,520 --> 04:25:02,880
There's a lot of ropists in here.

3384
04:25:03,440 --> 04:25:10,720
He cackled evilly in sarcastically at me.

3385
04:25:11,680 --> 04:25:13,680
Now I shall kill thee all.

3386
04:25:14,320 --> 04:25:15,680
Thunder came into the room.

3387
04:25:17,520 --> 04:25:22,240
No, please don't kill us, pleaded vampire.

3388
04:25:22,240 --> 04:25:26,480
Suddenly, Willow, Bloody Mary, Diabolo, Ginny, Dracula, Fred, George,

3389
04:25:26,480 --> 04:25:30,720
Hargard, McGonagall, Dumbledore, Sirius, and Lucen all ran in.

3390
04:25:34,160 --> 04:25:35,440
What is the meaning of this?

3391
04:25:36,160 --> 04:25:40,320
Dumbledore asked all angrily, and Voldemort looked away because Dumbledore is the only

3392
04:25:40,320 --> 04:25:42,000
wizard he is scared of.

3393
04:25:42,000 --> 04:25:45,120
He did his spell, and suddenly his broomstick came to him sexily.

3394
04:25:45,120 --> 04:25:48,080
Voldemort flew above the roof evilly on his broomstick.

3395
04:25:49,040 --> 04:25:52,320
Oh my God, Slugborn Gosped.

3396
04:25:52,320 --> 04:25:53,360
Get it, because I'm Gothic.

3397
04:25:54,720 --> 04:25:59,120
The Dark Lord shall kill all of you, and you must submit to him.

3398
04:26:00,560 --> 04:26:03,680
Snap ejaculated menacingly.

3399
04:26:05,280 --> 04:26:08,160
You fucking preppy fucks.

3400
04:26:09,040 --> 04:26:12,480
Ha ha ha ha ha.

3401
04:26:13,280 --> 04:26:13,920
Serious.

3402
04:26:14,640 --> 04:26:15,680
Shout it angrily.

3403
04:26:22,960 --> 04:26:25,840
I know a four letter word for dirt.

3404
04:26:26,560 --> 04:26:27,520
Crucifix.

3405
04:26:28,880 --> 04:26:33,120
Scream hey, when this box from his own wallet.

3406
04:26:34,080 --> 04:26:36,080
Only hit Draco's car.

3407
04:26:36,640 --> 04:26:37,520
It fell down.

3408
04:26:37,520 --> 04:26:41,840
Snap quickly crawled out of it and picked up the city-o camera.

3409
04:26:42,800 --> 04:26:44,480
Oh my fucking god.

3410
04:26:45,840 --> 04:26:50,320
I cried because the video of me in the bathroom, the video of me dong with Draco,

3411
04:26:50,320 --> 04:26:54,880
and the video of Satan dong with Jim Blank.

3412
04:26:55,600 --> 04:27:01,280
If you kill me, then these videos will be shown to everyone in the school.

3413
04:27:01,360 --> 04:27:05,280
And then you can just be like that Gothic girl, Paris Hilton.

3414
04:27:05,280 --> 04:27:05,600
What?

3415
04:27:09,280 --> 04:27:10,400
He laughed immediately.

3416
04:27:12,240 --> 04:27:13,680
No, I screamed.

3417
04:27:13,680 --> 04:27:16,960
FYI, I have a picture of you doing it with Lupin.

3418
04:27:18,320 --> 04:27:19,760
What is she talking about?

3419
04:27:19,760 --> 04:27:24,480
Lupin slurped as he sat in chains.

3420
04:27:27,120 --> 04:27:30,000
I saw she's gonna show everyone and depict her.

3421
04:27:31,920 --> 04:27:33,360
Harry shouted angrily.

3422
04:27:34,160 --> 04:27:35,840
Shut up, lumpkin roared.

3423
04:27:37,120 --> 04:27:39,440
Foolish ink neuramuses.

3424
04:27:40,800 --> 04:27:42,720
Yielded Voldemort from his broomstick.

3425
04:27:42,720 --> 04:27:46,960
Thou shall all die soon and die as in tie dye.

3426
04:27:46,960 --> 04:27:48,960
We're making tie dye shirts.

3427
04:27:50,880 --> 04:27:53,680
Think again, you fucking muggle pose.

3428
04:27:53,680 --> 04:27:54,400
Wait, hold on.

3429
04:27:55,200 --> 04:27:57,760
Think again, you fucking muggle poser.

3430
04:27:58,720 --> 04:28:04,480
Harry yelled, and then he and Diabolo and Navel both took out black guns.

3431
04:28:04,480 --> 04:28:06,240
But Voldemort took out his own one.

3432
04:28:08,080 --> 04:28:10,880
You guys are in a Latin standoff.

3433
04:28:10,880 --> 04:28:13,200
I shouted desperately.

3434
04:28:17,040 --> 04:28:18,880
Echo, Neville's wand.

3435
04:28:18,880 --> 04:28:19,200
Sorry.

3436
04:28:21,520 --> 04:28:22,080
I can't.

3437
04:28:23,680 --> 04:28:24,480
Wait a minute.

3438
04:28:24,480 --> 04:28:26,400
I thought that was all right.

3439
04:28:28,000 --> 04:28:31,680
Echo, Neville's wand.

3440
04:28:32,800 --> 04:28:36,000
Cried Voldemort, and suddenly Neville's wind was in his hands.

3441
04:28:36,800 --> 04:28:41,360
Now I shall kill thee and all, and every ebony you will die.

3442
04:28:42,880 --> 04:28:44,240
Save us, ebony!

3443
04:28:45,120 --> 04:28:46,640
Dumbledark cried.

3444
04:28:46,640 --> 04:28:47,920
I cried sexily.

3445
04:28:47,920 --> 04:28:51,680
I just wanted to go to the common room and slit my wrists with my friends

3446
04:28:51,680 --> 04:28:55,280
while we watched Shark Attack 3 and Saw 2 and do with Draco.

3447
04:28:55,920 --> 04:28:58,160
But I knew I had to do something more important.

3448
04:29:00,320 --> 04:29:01,200
Abra!

3449
04:29:03,200 --> 04:29:11,200
Cut Abra!

3450
04:29:13,600 --> 04:29:14,240
And that's it.

3451
04:29:14,880 --> 04:29:16,880
That is the end of my immortal.

3452
04:29:16,880 --> 04:29:18,000
That's how it ends.

3453
04:29:18,000 --> 04:29:19,520
We never know what happens.

3454
04:29:20,560 --> 04:29:22,000
It just ends like that.

3455
04:29:22,720 --> 04:29:24,240
There's no other chapters.

3456
04:29:25,680 --> 04:29:30,080
Did you enjoy?

3457
04:29:36,560 --> 04:29:39,040
And the whole playing clapped when it ended.

3458
04:29:46,080 --> 04:29:46,960
That's the end.

3459
04:29:46,960 --> 04:29:48,240
She never finished it.

3460
04:29:48,880 --> 04:29:50,640
She never finished it, guys.

3461
04:29:51,680 --> 04:29:53,360
Now I can write the ending.

3462
04:29:54,160 --> 04:29:55,280
It's up to you now.

3463
04:29:57,040 --> 04:30:01,120
You are the author of your own story.

3464
04:30:03,520 --> 04:30:05,520
That was one of the stories of all time.

3465
04:30:10,880 --> 04:30:11,520
How was that?

3466
04:30:11,520 --> 04:30:12,480
How are you guys feeling?

3467
04:30:12,480 --> 04:30:13,200
How are you guys doing?

3468
04:30:14,240 --> 04:30:14,800
How was it?

3469
04:30:15,360 --> 04:30:16,480
It's almost 1 a.m.

3470
04:30:16,480 --> 04:30:17,280
Holy crap.

3471
04:30:17,280 --> 04:30:19,600
I didn't expect to stream this wrong.

3472
04:30:19,600 --> 04:30:21,840
Thankfully, I was a sheebie.

3473
04:30:21,840 --> 04:30:24,000
Fia has been sleeping, so she's good.

3474
04:30:24,000 --> 04:30:25,680
I'll just wake her up to feed her.

3475
04:30:26,480 --> 04:30:27,440
The little baby.

3476
04:30:29,920 --> 04:30:30,880
I'm happy.

3477
04:30:30,880 --> 04:30:32,400
I'm happy you guys enjoyed.

3478
04:30:38,880 --> 04:30:39,600
Let's see.

3479
04:30:39,600 --> 04:30:41,440
Let's find someone to raid

3480
04:30:41,440 --> 04:30:42,880
because I'm going to end stream here.

3481
04:30:48,080 --> 04:30:49,440
She has been sleeping.

3482
04:30:49,440 --> 04:30:50,560
What the heck, Toki?

3483
04:30:51,120 --> 04:30:51,680
Are you pretty?

3484
04:30:55,440 --> 04:30:56,240
This has appeared.

3485
04:30:57,360 --> 04:30:59,360
I was trying to get the text to speech on.

3486
04:31:00,560 --> 04:31:03,440
Since I wasn't, but my BGM is messing stuff up.

3487
04:31:04,160 --> 04:31:06,480
Let me read it out loud.

3488
04:31:10,320 --> 04:31:11,200
Thank you, Toki.

3489
04:31:11,200 --> 04:31:11,840
What the hell?

3490
04:31:14,320 --> 04:31:16,000
We appreciate you so much, madam.

3491
04:31:16,000 --> 04:31:17,280
Glad you're able to stream today.

3492
04:31:17,280 --> 04:31:18,240
Really do spoil us.

3493
04:31:18,240 --> 04:31:19,200
Love you, bunches.

3494
04:31:19,200 --> 04:31:21,280
Oh, stop it, stop it.

3495
04:31:26,720 --> 04:31:27,040
Yeah.

3496
04:31:29,200 --> 04:31:30,800
Yeah, thank you, Toki.

3497
04:31:33,360 --> 04:31:36,240
You guys, also, I'm not really this manhara.

3498
04:31:36,240 --> 04:31:37,360
It was just a bit.

3499
04:31:40,560 --> 04:31:41,920
It was just for the bit.

3500
04:31:43,280 --> 04:31:45,200
I promise you I'm not crazy.

3501
04:31:45,200 --> 04:31:46,160
Please don't leave me.

3502
04:31:47,040 --> 04:31:48,560
I promise I'm not crazy.

3503
04:31:48,560 --> 04:31:49,120
Please don't.

3504
04:31:50,080 --> 04:31:51,360
Please don't leave.

3505
04:31:51,360 --> 04:31:52,560
I'll be so lonely.

3506
04:31:54,080 --> 04:31:56,560
I'll be so lonely.

3507
04:32:08,720 --> 04:32:09,600
Oh, thank you.

3508
04:32:09,600 --> 04:32:12,000
Oh, that was for the 25.

3509
04:32:12,000 --> 04:32:12,560
Thank you.

3510
04:32:14,000 --> 04:32:15,520
It's the allergy meds.

3511
04:32:15,520 --> 04:32:17,440
And it's the gamer subs.

3512
04:32:17,440 --> 04:32:18,720
They got me in my feels.

3513
04:32:28,640 --> 04:32:31,120
Well, the hell, you leaving me thing wasn't a joke.

3514
04:32:31,120 --> 04:32:32,320
I meant, like, everything else.

3515
04:32:35,920 --> 04:32:36,960
Oh, my Satan.

3516
04:32:38,080 --> 04:32:40,240
You still love me even if I'm manhara?

3517
04:32:41,040 --> 04:32:42,000
You promise?

3518
04:32:43,440 --> 04:32:44,320
You promise?

3519
04:32:47,600 --> 04:32:48,320
Do you like me?

3520
04:32:48,960 --> 04:32:50,800
You still like me even when I'm manhara?

3521
04:32:52,240 --> 04:32:55,120
Do you still like me even when I'm bald?

3522
04:32:56,400 --> 04:32:58,480
Do you like me even when I'm bald?

3523
04:32:59,360 --> 04:33:01,680
You still love me when I'm bald?

3524
04:33:08,400 --> 04:33:10,480
Yeah, okay.

3525
04:33:14,640 --> 04:33:16,160
Let me find someone.

3526
04:33:16,240 --> 04:33:17,920
I think Stronny's still streaming?

3527
04:33:19,600 --> 04:33:20,100
No.

3528
04:33:26,480 --> 04:33:27,200
She rated me.

3529
04:33:27,200 --> 04:33:28,480
What am I talking about?

3530
04:33:28,480 --> 04:33:29,840
Well, sometimes Stronny will rate me

3531
04:33:29,840 --> 04:33:32,080
and then do something else and just keep streaming.

3532
04:33:32,080 --> 04:33:34,640
So, okay.

3533
04:33:37,280 --> 04:33:38,240
I can read.

3534
04:33:38,240 --> 04:33:40,240
I can rate Skarl again.

3535
04:33:40,240 --> 04:33:41,840
Although, like, it generally doesn't

3536
04:33:41,840 --> 04:33:43,840
freaking matter anymore because,

3537
04:33:44,800 --> 04:33:48,720
wait, is Mercy still on vacation, isn't she?

3538
04:33:48,720 --> 04:33:51,200
Or she's just taking a day to rest.

3539
04:33:53,040 --> 04:33:55,280
Because the rate message, like, nobody,

3540
04:33:55,280 --> 04:33:57,680
it's so hard to tell if you're being rated.

3541
04:33:59,600 --> 04:34:01,360
Because I'll rate Serenity.

3542
04:34:04,240 --> 04:34:06,160
She's playing Life Eater.

3543
04:34:06,960 --> 04:34:08,960
I don't know what that is, but it looks spooky as hell.

3544
04:34:10,560 --> 04:34:12,720
I can't rate Mori-Kaliopee.

3545
04:34:12,800 --> 04:34:15,600
I was going to try rating Roar or Panthera,

3546
04:34:15,600 --> 04:34:16,720
but it didn't let me.

3547
04:34:16,720 --> 04:34:19,200
Because I'm not, you know, they haven't put me

3548
04:34:19,200 --> 04:34:20,720
on the white list on accident.

3549
04:34:20,720 --> 04:34:23,920
As you guys know, I am part of HoloVeeAlur.

3550
04:34:23,920 --> 04:34:26,720
HoloAlur, if you will, is the shorthand.

3551
04:34:28,320 --> 04:34:30,160
Or Lur, because we lure people in.

3552
04:34:31,920 --> 04:34:33,040
But they'll fix that.

3553
04:34:33,040 --> 04:34:34,720
It's just YouTube being silly.

3554
04:34:38,400 --> 04:34:40,480
All right, let's rate Serenity.

3555
04:34:41,200 --> 04:34:45,280
Um, just say, ooh, Spooky Raid or something.

3556
04:34:45,280 --> 04:34:45,760
I don't know.

3557
04:34:45,760 --> 04:34:46,560
What is she?

3558
04:34:46,560 --> 04:34:49,040
Hold on, I want to see what this game looks like,

3559
04:34:49,040 --> 04:34:50,000
to be honest with you.

3560
04:34:50,960 --> 04:34:55,280
Um, YouTube's to you.

3561
04:34:57,280 --> 04:35:01,280
I forgot that I posted a, I don't know, was that 13K?

3562
04:35:01,280 --> 04:35:05,040
I forgot that I posted a, I had a short auto-scheduled.

3563
04:35:05,040 --> 04:35:11,680
I have to post it on my main.

3564
04:35:15,280 --> 04:35:16,320
Immortal Raid.

3565
04:35:16,320 --> 04:35:17,040
Yeah, that works.

3566
04:35:19,040 --> 04:35:20,880
All right, guys, I'll see you.

3567
04:35:20,880 --> 04:35:22,800
Keep it stinky, you know?

3568
04:35:24,240 --> 04:35:25,360
Keeps being smelly.

3569
04:35:26,400 --> 04:35:29,600
I'm going to go wake up Fia and try to feed her again.

3570
04:35:31,280 --> 04:35:32,400
Then I'm going to go to bed.

3571
04:35:35,040 --> 04:35:39,760
I really need to sleep because I have a collab at 10am tomorrow

3572
04:35:40,320 --> 04:35:43,840
with Fuwa, because she is in Australian time.

3573
04:35:44,400 --> 04:35:46,560
In fact, while I'm still on the computer,

3574
04:35:46,560 --> 04:35:48,160
I'm going to buy a said game.

3575
04:35:48,960 --> 04:35:50,400
Actually, I can do it from my phone.

3576
04:35:51,280 --> 04:35:51,760
That's fine.

3577
04:35:53,360 --> 04:35:53,920
All right.

3578
04:35:55,200 --> 04:35:58,400
Oh my God, my collar bone is freaking cracked.

3579
04:35:59,920 --> 04:36:01,840
Much love, kisses all around.

3580
04:36:01,840 --> 04:36:03,360
The sleep is starting to hit me,

3581
04:36:03,360 --> 04:36:05,040
because I've been just manic all day.

3582
04:36:06,800 --> 04:36:08,400
Vod stays up, bros.

3583
04:36:08,400 --> 04:36:11,520
We're not, we're, we're, this is the edgy girl Vod.

3584
04:36:11,520 --> 04:36:13,360
I'm going to put, I'm going to change the title

3585
04:36:13,360 --> 04:36:17,120
to be like edgy Vod or something or trigger warning.

3586
04:36:18,080 --> 04:36:19,360
May have dark themes.

3587
04:36:21,360 --> 04:36:23,360
Actually, let me do that right now before I forget.

3588
04:36:27,280 --> 04:36:27,920
Details.

3589
04:36:27,920 --> 04:36:37,120
Contains dark themes,

3590
04:36:39,600 --> 04:36:41,760
but also audition advice, question mark.

3591
04:36:42,480 --> 04:36:43,120
It's funny.

3592
04:36:43,120 --> 04:36:44,880
Like it's so funny how I switch.

3593
04:36:45,440 --> 04:36:46,560
I'm not bipolar.

3594
04:36:46,560 --> 04:36:48,400
I'm just, I'm good at my job.

3595
04:36:48,400 --> 04:36:49,520
I'm a good entertainer.

3596
04:36:53,200 --> 04:36:55,920
I almost played wedding witch instead too.

3597
04:36:56,320 --> 04:37:01,920
Hot topic, you're the hot topic contains dank means.

3598
04:37:03,840 --> 04:37:04,880
Yeah, I don't even know.

3599
04:37:04,880 --> 04:37:07,360
I'm sure people will like do the timestamps

3600
04:37:08,160 --> 04:37:10,400
in the comments about like when I'm talking

3601
04:37:10,400 --> 04:37:11,680
about my audition and stuff.

3602
04:37:11,680 --> 04:37:13,760
I would love to do like an actual, I'm going to do,

3603
04:37:14,560 --> 04:37:15,360
maybe I'll do it.

3604
04:37:17,280 --> 04:37:18,080
Well, actually not.

3605
04:37:22,240 --> 04:37:24,560
I don't really think there's any point of me doing a,

3606
04:37:24,560 --> 04:37:28,080
how do audition when it's not even close to audition time?

3607
04:37:28,080 --> 04:37:28,960
I'll probably do.

3608
04:37:28,960 --> 04:37:30,320
I'm sure scrawny will do it too.

3609
04:37:30,320 --> 04:37:32,000
Like a what we're looking for.

3610
04:37:32,800 --> 04:37:33,600
Oh, thank you.

3611
04:37:33,600 --> 04:37:35,120
Rekuma, what the heck?

3612
04:37:35,120 --> 04:37:36,720
Thank you for the five gifted.

3613
04:37:36,720 --> 04:37:37,760
You're so sweet.

3614
04:37:37,760 --> 04:37:38,240
Thank you.

3615
04:37:39,040 --> 04:37:39,520
Thank you.

3616
04:37:39,520 --> 04:37:40,080
And don't forget.

3617
04:37:40,080 --> 04:37:42,320
Remember I said, I will say thank you again

3618
04:37:42,320 --> 04:37:44,640
for that little dollar you threw at me earlier.

3619
04:37:44,640 --> 04:37:46,720
You're throwing singles like you at the club.

3620
04:37:50,480 --> 04:37:52,000
And it's just like a cheese single.

3621
04:37:55,520 --> 04:38:00,560
Um, but I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3622
04:38:00,560 --> 04:38:01,440
Bright and early.

3623
04:38:01,440 --> 04:38:03,440
If you can't make it, that's okay.

3624
04:38:03,440 --> 04:38:05,600
I'm streaming half dead with Fua.

3625
04:38:07,040 --> 04:38:08,400
I'm probably going to be half dead

3626
04:38:08,400 --> 04:38:09,760
because I'm going to be really tired.

3627
04:38:09,760 --> 04:38:10,800
I'm going to have to wake up early

3628
04:38:10,800 --> 04:38:14,400
so I can feed Fia because I usually feed Fia around 9 30 10.

3629
04:38:15,040 --> 04:38:16,800
So I'll have to do it before that.

3630
04:38:19,040 --> 04:38:23,440
But yeah, I hope you guys I'll have like Fua's information

3631
04:38:23,440 --> 04:38:25,600
in the in the description and stuff too.

3632
04:38:26,480 --> 04:38:30,880
Um, very excited to see you later.

3633
04:38:32,480 --> 04:38:32,880
Bye.

3634
04:38:34,640 --> 04:38:35,040
Bye.

3635
04:38:37,360 --> 04:38:38,400
I'm E.P.

3636
04:38:39,280 --> 04:38:39,520
Bye.

3637
04:38:40,720 --> 04:38:41,360
Stinky.

3638
04:38:42,240 --> 04:38:43,440
Take a shower.

3639
04:38:43,440 --> 04:38:45,280
Will ya smelly.

3640
04:38:46,720 --> 04:38:47,520
Stinky.

3641
04:38:49,520 --> 04:38:50,880
Love you.

3642
04:38:50,880 --> 04:38:51,360
