trabaj   review

18
00:07:49,620 --> 00:08:02,620
but I was so excited for this project from the moment of its inception and I even said that in my video

19
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:10,620
I was like, I just want to be a part of this. I just want to be part of something different.

20
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,620
I want to be part of this company that's going to make waves.

21
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,620
I want to be part of this company that's going to set a whole new standard for V-Tubing

22
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,620
and I hope that we do. I know it's only been, it's only my second day out here

23
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:36,620
but part of V-SUCKY. Hi, welcome to V-SUCKY. We'll give you some SUCKY SUCKY.

24
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:52,620
I was very excited to be a part of this in my interview with...

25
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,620
So I got the email and it was April's Fool's Day and I'm just like, this is a joke.

26
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Somehow someone figured out that I applied because I kept it on the DL

27
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,620
and they sent me a joke email but it wasn't.

28
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,620
And then I had the interview and then I hear...

29
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,620
and I'm expecting to talk to some run-of-the-mill lady who's just like,

30
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Hey, so you're applying for V-LUR here. I'm going to ask you these questions.

31
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,620
Tell me about yourself, blah blah blah blah blah.

32
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,620
And it was strongy. I was like...

33
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,620
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

34
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,620
But actually I was pretty... I got my whole... I had questions ready.

35
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,620
I was going in. As you know, I was an office bunny.

36
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,620
I know what I'm getting into. What color is my underwear?

37
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,620
It should be cotton moth. That just sounds like I'm a snake.

38
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,620
Like I'm a... like I'm... I was some sort of... it's going to be a snake.

39
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,620
Like, I'm a shibby cotton moth.

40
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Would you like to be wrapped up in my scales?

41
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,620
Why do I sound like Rita Rapulza?

42
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Um...

43
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,620
Lawmio for Gem 2. Lawmio for Gem 2.

44
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,620
But I heard her voice.

45
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,620
And I was like...

46
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Is that... is that strongy cuttles?

47
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Is that the strongy cuttles?

48
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Excuse me.

49
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,620
The interview was great. She literally was just like, yeah, so you got it.

50
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,620
I'm like, huh? You're joking. And she's like, yeah, that's it.

51
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,620
Okay. Oh, she's like, here's the model.

52
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,620
And I'm like, oh, okay.

53
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,620
And I'm like, do you want to ask me anything?

54
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,620
Like, I could just be... I could be a crazy person.

55
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,620
Like, I could just... you're just gonna...

56
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,620
And she's like, no, you're good.

57
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,620
She's like, you're the person I wanted immediately.

58
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,620
I was like, oh, that's actually like really,

59
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,620
really freaking nice.

60
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,620
It was really nice.

61
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,620
She's been a creator I've looked up to for a very long time.

62
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,620
And I know the other girls can say the same.

63
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,620
And just to hear her be like, you were a first choice.

64
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,620
I was impressed with your video. I was this, I was that.

65
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,620
And I had applied to many companies before.

66
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
Because I'm like, I'm never going to get in.

67
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,620
I'm just going to do whatever.

68
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,620
I applied to, I think, 10 different auditions.

69
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,620
And I'm generally happy I failed each one.

70
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Because I wouldn't want this any other way.

71
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,620
It was great.

72
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,620
And me knows what I'm talking about.

73
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,620
And meeting all the girls, I was like,

74
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,620
everybody's so freaking talented.

75
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Like, Emmie's talented, Icey's talented,

76
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,620
Azura's voice is pure fucking sex, dude.

77
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Sorry, I had a burp.

78
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
Yeah, I'm trying.

79
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,620
He's not the only freaking burp in this company.

80
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,620
Let's see how long it takes for me to rip ass or something.

81
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Burp a corp.

82
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,620
And I'll go right up to the mic.

83
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,620
And I'll do it.

84
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
It runs in the family.

85
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
But yeah, I'm really glad to be one of the daughters.

86
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,620
One of the whore daughters.

87
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,620
Although it's kind of funny.

88
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,620
People thought, oh bear, condition just kicked on.

89
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,620
We're just like, we're just going to be whores.

90
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,620
24-7.

91
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,620
I'm going to be little in my doodaw right here, right now.

92
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,620
No, like, I'm also a normal person.

93
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,620
I'm also like, you can chat with me,

94
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,620
and then, you know, you can go to Patreon,

95
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
and that's great, you know?

96
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,620
It's...

97
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,620
Hey, yo, what's up?

98
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
What, what's she saying?

99
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,620
All right, hear me out.

100
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,620
That'd be, you know,

101
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,620
and like my hair already kind of has like that snake-like appearance.

102
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,620
I don't know.

103
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
I can hear the, yeah, it's, it's loud.

104
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,620
It's like 80 degrees outside.

105
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
Leave me alone.

106
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,620
I kicked onto her debut.

107
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
Whatever.

108
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,620
I have my cat next to me.

109
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,620
My handsome little man.

110
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,620
He is sleeping in a bed.

111
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,620
I'll have a cat cam eventually.

112
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,620
So you guys can see my little boy.

113
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,620
This is, I have Boomi next to me.

114
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,620
Boomi King of Umashu,

115
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,620
because I am a,

116
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,620
I am a, I would call the last Airbender fan.

117
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,620
And then, yeah, the cat name drop.

118
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
The cat name drop.

119
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,620
Hold on.

120
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,620
I'm not actually, wait.

121
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,620
I'm not, let me, let's just,

122
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,620
I'm getting ahead of myself.

123
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,620
Ow, I hit my knee again.

124
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,620
It's because my legs are crossed.

125
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
I'm trying to sit all seductively in my chair.

126
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,620
It's not working out.

127
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
Fuck you.

128
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Cat talks.

129
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
Let's go to my lore.

130
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
I'm going to pull myself up in the lore.

131
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,620
So you can just break down scene by scene.

132
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,620
Hello.

133
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Where am I?

134
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,620
I need to manually play it.

135
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,620
Hold on.

136
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Let me just, where am I?

137
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Who am I?

138
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,620
You also will learn that I have fucking ADHD

139
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,620
and I forget what I'm doing.

140
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,620
I think it's, no.

141
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,620
It's dark.

142
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Mommy, I can't see.

143
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,620
Shut up.

144
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Shut up.

145
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Just take it.

146
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Just don't worry about it.

147
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
Don't worry.

148
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,620
Just bend over and take it.

149
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:05,620
You don't have to question anything.

150
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Okay.

151
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,620
F my annoying ass voice.

152
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,620
I realize I go a lot deeper for when I record stuff.

153
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,620
There it is.

154
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,620
Whoopsies.

155
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,620
Give me just a, there we go.

156
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,620
When I'm nervous, I do lots of different voices.

157
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,620
It's just me.

158
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,620
What the fuck?

159
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,620
You know, I will constantly slip into a Scottish accent

160
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,620
because of Strani.

161
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,620
I got bad Aqualalia where you just mimic voices.

162
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,620
I usually mimic accents.

163
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,620
You're going to get a lot of cat mo.

164
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
I'm a fucking dork.

165
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
I'm sorry.

167
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
I'm a dummy, mommy.

168
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
I'll step on you.

169
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
I'll step on you so far.

170
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,620
I'm going to kick your fucking teeth in.

171
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Don't get me started.

172
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,620
But I'm also a bit stupid.

173
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
I'm a blonde.

174
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Don't forget that.

175
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Anyways, hold on.

176
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,620
Let me just, okay.

177
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:19,620
So, like I was saying, I'm going to keep bunny.

178
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,620
It's like, hang in there.

179
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
And I'm really depressed.

180
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:30,620
You know, I really identified with this valley bunny girl.

181
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Oh my God.

182
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Why?

183
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,620
You don't like this voice?

184
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
What the fuck are you talking about?

185
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
You're such a fucking little bitch.

186
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
Am I allowed to swear this much?

187
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Am I going to get demonetized?

188
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Immediately, when I get monetization, probably.

189
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,620
Because my titties are too fat and so is my ass.

190
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,620
And I swear a lot.

191
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Like, I'm going to bully you.

193
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Do you like sit by yourself at lunch?

194
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,620
Don't you like have any friends?

195
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
No?

196
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,620
What a fucking loser.

197
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,620
Wow.

198
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,620
What the fuck?

199
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
There's a dog barking out.

200
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,620
I hate my apartment building.

201
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Yo, shut your fucking dog up.

202
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,620
I'm about to scream out my balcony.

203
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Okay, anyways.

204
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,620
Like I said, I have ADHD.

205
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,620
A doctor said I got ADHD.

206
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,620
I don't know what that means, but I got 80 of them.

207
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,620
I need a drink.

208
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,620
He got that dog and I'm a wolf.

209
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,620
That's a spark.

210
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
School bully ASMR.

211
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
Hell yeah.

212
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,620
Okay.

213
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
3D.

214
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
That's very sensitive.

215
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
What do you mean?

216
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
Am I talking to the...

217
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
Wait, is my 3D a long?

218
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,620
No, it's not.

219
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
I record with AT2020.

220
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
That's also why my mic is shit.

221
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,620
You need a shirt and I'm like...

222
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,620
I'm totally fine.

223
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
It's good.

224
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,620
So yeah, I identify with this a lot.

225
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Working in retail, slaving away.

226
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
I finally...

227
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,620
I need a noise gate.

228
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,620
How about I fucking noise your gate, bro?

229
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,620
Okay, hold on.

230
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,620
I do have a noise gate, actually.

231
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Let's see.

232
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,620
How about now?

233
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
I also have a compressor.

234
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
I don't fucking know.

235
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
We'll figure that out later.

236
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
I don't...

237
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
I hate noise.

238
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
I hate...

239
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,620
I hate sounds.

240
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,620
I suck with audio.

241
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,620
They're like, oh, I hope the girls are like actually good with audio.

242
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,620
No, I'm not one of them.

243
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,620
I didn't do anything, but that's okay.

244
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Thank you.

245
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Mic settings are...

246
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
Yeah, just like...

247
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,620
Whatever.

248
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,620
But yeah, retail sucks.

249
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,620
I finally dropped to part time.

250
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,620
I got a part time...

251
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,620
I don't...

252
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Wait, where is my...

253
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,620
I don't remember my fucking toggles.

254
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:29,620
I had to apply for a part time position that I already had.

255
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,620
I already was in the role as full time.

256
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:43,620
And I had to apply and go through two interviews just to be considered for part time.

257
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Like, can you...

258
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Mind you, I've been at this company for like almost six years.

259
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,620
It's not like they don't fucking know me.

260
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,620
So now I have more time to stream.

261
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Thank God, that was my goal.

262
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,620
I just want...

263
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,620
I'm like, please, please, universe, just give me more time to stream.

264
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
I just want to be a streamer.

265
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
I just want to hang out with you guys.

266
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,620
I just want to yop, yop, yop, yop, yop.

267
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,620
Are you going to be a full time?

268
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
That's the goal.

269
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
That is the goal.

270
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,620
If I can stream full time, that is the goal.

271
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Like, I just want to sit here and just talk to you and moan in your ear and like diddle you a bit and play some games.

272
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,620
And you know, call you a piece of trash because you are trash.

273
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
By the way, hope you don't forget that.

274
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,620
Just because I'm a little like, I'm a little, oh, I'm, I'm whatever.

275
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:45,620
That doesn't mean just because I have zoom or energy sometimes doesn't mean I won't be a fucking bitch.

276
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,620
You'll do what to me.

277
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
Don't worry about it.

278
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Just close your eyes.

279
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Just take it.

280
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,620
Anyways, so I've identified with this a lot.

281
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,620
I showed my mom parts of my lore video and my mom also identifies with this a lot.

282
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
Speaking of my mom, I love my parents.

283
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,620
My parents are very supportive of me that yes, they know I do loot audio.

284
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,620
Don't be like, can your parents look at you in the face?

285
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,620
Yeah.

286
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,620
My mom's like, get me on.

287
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,620
My dad's like, get me on.

288
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Get us on stream.

289
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Get us in recording.

290
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Let's do some stuff.

291
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,620
I'm like, all right.

292
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
All right.

293
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
Is your mom sink?

294
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
No.

295
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
My mom is not single.

296
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
She is happily married to my father.

297
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Get the fuck out.

298
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Yeah.

299
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,620
My mom says she's going to hijack my channel so she can become a Vtuber.

300
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,620
Pull a Brea cookie boxes.

301
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Mom, our cookie box and make a gardening channel.

302
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,620
She said, is your dad sick?

303
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,620
No.

304
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
My dad is a Chad though.

305
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,620
My dad and Strani's dad are so much alike.

306
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,620
My dad was just like, hey, are you going to be?

307
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Okay.

308
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
You know what?

309
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
Let me just fuck this noise.

310
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm just going to be fully in the frame because I can't stop talking.

311
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:18,620
My dad was like, I was like, dad, I got accepted for the Vtuber thing that I applied for.

312
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
And he's like, whoa.

313
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,620
So you're really a hentai waifu Vtuber?

314
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,620
And I'm like, yes.

315
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,620
And he's like, sick.

316
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,620
Don't tell me anything about it, but I'm proud of you.

317
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
Yes, my dad knows what hentai is.

318
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,620
And we had to thoroughly explain to my mother what it was with pictures.

319
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
It was quite funny.

320
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:57,620
My very religious conservative mother blushing profusely as we show her a clip from Bible Black.

321
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
Anyways.

322
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
Oh no, my parents are cool religious.

323
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,620
If when I was like super young to be like, wait, she's religious, how does this work?

324
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
I'm not religious.

325
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,620
Fuck that.

326
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,620
Respect though.

327
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,620
If you, you know, worship our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then you know, all for you.

328
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,620
I'm just not a part of it, but my parents are very devout Christians.

329
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,620
But as I got older and I was just, you know, I wasn't feeling that.

330
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
They're just like, you know what, you do you boo.

331
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,620
And I think my parents for that.

332
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,620
My parents are based as hell.

333
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,620
You don't even know.

334
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
I'll tell more stories.

335
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,620
Moving on.

336
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
See if I can jerk my titties around.

337
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,620
Watching this is church parking lot right now.

338
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,620
Don't ask.

339
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,620
My dad's going to be so mad that I'm putting him on blast.

340
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,620
He's like, wait, you told her stream that that we we showed your mom had.

341
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Why would you do that?

342
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,620
I don't know why my dad's southern, but in whatever.

343
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
But yeah, moving on.

344
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,620
I also didn't fight with this because this happened to me multiple times.

345
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,620
Remember when I said I worked there for like six years?

346
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
I still work there because I need insurance.

347
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
Yeah, I was passed up on a lot.

348
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,620
And I didn't even come up with the lore.

349
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,620
They just threw this at me and they're like, read the script.

350
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
And I was like, why the fuck is this me though?

351
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
This is me.

352
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,620
This is real.

353
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,620
But yeah, there's they're like, no, we don't we don't believe in nepotism.

354
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
What are you talking about?

355
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:51,620
And I'm like, you just gave this girl who just came in because she never mind.

356
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
She just gave this girl a job that I clearly deserve.

357
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,620
I've been there for three years and you just can't get to a girl.

358
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,620
It's been there for six months.

359
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
Let's fight.

360
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,620
Oh, my bosses don't see this because they know I stream too.

361
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,620
Somebody pointed out in Strani stream, they're like, oh, it's queen.

362
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,620
It queen was my my my pre-concept art and stop telling people you stream.

363
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,620
I tell all people I stream and people just find me.

364
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:39,620
I had one of my co-workers come up to me and be like, hey, I saw are you doing this like playing this game?

365
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Was that was that you?

366
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,620
And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

367
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,620
It wasn't me.

368
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,620
But yeah, queen, she's queen, rest in peace.

369
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
I kind of want an alternative outfit.

370
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,620
That's similar to her outfit, just like fur.

371
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,620
And then somebody also pointed out, I'll use the loli voice when you should.

372
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,620
The funny thing is, is that I did and they still know it was me.

373
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
I do.

374
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:19,620
Yeah, you guys know I do a lot of different voices and yes, I will continue to do so.

375
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:28,620
Someone said this looked like Contel VA and I'm like, oh shit, I didn't even get that until now.

376
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,620
In my debut, I glanced at chat real quick and someone's like, is that Contel VA?

377
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,620
And I'm like, hey, oh, it wasn't, it wasn't my intention.

378
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,620
Well, I might not even make this concept art and I didn't do the lore, but it wasn't the intention.

379
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,620
I can assure you that.

380
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,620
But it's funny that it happened.

381
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
It wasn't planned.

382
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,620
But a shout out to her.

383
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
She makes amazing audios.

384
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,620
Jorked off to one of them the other day.

385
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Anyways.

386
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Oh, damn.

387
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
Hold on.

388
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
Let me move my.

389
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,620
I got some tickle bitties.

390
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
I'll probably need to cover up because.

391
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Because yeah, I'm probably going to get an outfit similar to the one I'm wearing in this.

392
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Picture just because my bazonga hungers are bazonga hunging.

393
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Oh my God, kids are running down the hallway screaming in my apartment building.

394
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:45,620
If I can just move out into the countryside with my three cats, get some dogs, some horses, some horses.

395
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,620
Some goats and just live on a farm.

396
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,620
No animals.

397
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
That's not everyone.

398
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:59,620
So every time you buy my merch and you, yeah, I got merch too, bitch.

399
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,620
You buy my merch and you support my Patreon.

400
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,620
You're helping me get one step closer to my tree.

401
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Yeah, when I saw this, I'm like, this isn't going to be allowed.

402
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,620
I'm like, this isn't with this fucking.

403
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,620
Hold on.

404
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,620
Hold on.

405
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Can someone like take a screenshot and like have me pointing like backwards like, oh fuck.

406
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Excuse me.

407
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
Excuse me.

408
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,620
One step closer to Ram Ranch, 18 naked cowboys in the showers at Ram Ranch.

409
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,620
She did what?

410
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,620
Where?

411
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,620
Excuse me.

412
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Seven out of 10 burp.

413
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,620
Fuck your mother.

414
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,620
What?

415
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,620
I burp like a fucking God, bro.

416
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Anyways, I don't know why I keep calling you guys bro.

417
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,620
I need to start.

418
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
I used to call you trash.

419
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
I'm a fucking God trash.

420
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,620
What's a nice one syllable word?

421
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
You fucking sluts.

422
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Oh, here's my neighbors.

423
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Yapping their asses off.

424
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
I don't know if you can hear that on the background.

425
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Anyways, they probably can hear me and I'm just like, ah ha ha, gips.

426
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
This is hot.

427
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
This is hot, but yeah.

428
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,620
He.

429
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,620
Can you speak while burping?

430
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,620
No.

431
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,620
Hi honey neighbors.

432
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I love this.

433
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
This is like my favorite scene.

434
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Because I just look so cute with my little hair up and with a glass of wine.

435
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,620
Hold on.

436
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm going to do a hi honey.

437
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,620
It's a little nod.

438
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,620
Take a sip.

439
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,620
Perfect.

440
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,620
And then my queens in the background, like hot infinity pool.

441
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,620
You know what would have been funny if they had Azura just flying.

442
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,620
You know how in her lore video she just flies over?

443
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Do you do voice training?

444
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
Do you know?

445
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
I'm just like that.

446
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
I give credit.

447
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,620
My dad will probably say this.

448
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,620
I give credit to my father for giving me a wide voice range.

449
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,620
Because my dad's voice is super deep, but he can go super fucking high like me.

450
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,620
And so sometimes they're like, I would, for example, let's say I do something and I fuck up.

451
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,620
And I don't know.

452
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,620
I stubbed my toe, you know, like that one snot nose kid from the Simpsons.

453
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
They go ha ha ha.

454
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,620
My dad does that perfectly.

455
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,620
And so we would just be like ha ha ha.

456
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
And then they would talk higher.

457
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:07,620
And you can also do the, um, the fucking, uh, the PDF file from, um, South Park voice.

458
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Hey there little boy.

459
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
I can't do it.

460
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,620
My dad, my dad is a good voice actor.

461
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
He should, he should honestly voice in games.

462
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,620
And my mom just sounds like can really do a really good Muppet impression.

463
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,620
She'll try to be British and she just sounds like a Muppet.

464
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:30,620
Um, family guy, whatever, whatever, bro.

465
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,620
I mean, slut.

466
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,620
I mean, you guys need a name when getting dad.

467
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Can you do a Russian voice?

468
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,620
One of my, hold on.

469
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
I need to think of IC.

470
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,620
And one of my best friends is also, she's Russian too.

471
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,620
Shout out to, shout out to my girl.

472
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Um, everybody's Russian, the Finnish.

473
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:05,620
No, I can't, I can't do it right now because then I'm going to slip into, I always end up slipping into a British accent.

474
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:11,620
And then sometimes when I'm listening to Strony, I'll just slip into her, her Scottish accent and she's been teaching me Scots.

475
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:18,620
But I also just sound like I'm from Northern, cause I can't roll my, my Rs that well.

476
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Sound like I'm from Northern Britain or UK or whatever.

477
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,620
What about calling a slit? No.

478
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,620
I'm not going to be like, hey slave on YouTube.

479
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,620
What's up you guys?

480
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,620
We're talking to this.

481
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,620
What's up you slave?

482
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Are you trying to get me canceled?

483
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,620
Are you trying to get me canceled?

484
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Do not clip this out of context.

485
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
I will come for you.

486
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,620
Not like that.

487
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
I will come for you.

488
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
I'm coming for you.

489
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Coming for your family.

490
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,620
I'm coming for your, your, your career.

491
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,620
I'm coming on your lap.

492
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
All right.

493
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
All right.

494
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Stop it.

495
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Stop it.

496
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Stop it.

497
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,620
Ah, Shibi, what are you doing?

498
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,620
What are you doing?

499
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,620
Shibi.

500
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:22,620
Ah, anyways, at least take me out to dinner first.

501
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Nah, we're going straight to third base.

502
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
You know what that is?

503
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
Holding hands.

504
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,620
How about calling you Scum?

505
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,620
Oh, I like Scum.

506
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,620
I love her absolutely scatterbrained Tommy.

507
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,620
That's me.

508
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,620
And I'm getting too lewd.

509
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
I'm getting too lewd.

510
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:52,620
And it's like, I've always been like not say so, but I usually, it's usually just in

511
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:58,620
the frame of what's it called, just swearing and cursing.

512
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,620
But now I can just make really stupid, perfected jokes just because I can.

513
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,620
Oh, okay.

514
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
And holding is insane.

515
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
I know.

516
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,620
Hey, look, it's me.

517
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:18,620
So yeah, people are like, Shibi, Shibi, hold on.

518
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
Where's the, where's the dumb?

519
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:25,620
Oh, where's the dumb face?

520
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
There we go.

521
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,620
This is what, this is how I picture you guys.

522
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,620
Oh, Shibi, when you wear Shiba, he rubs.

523
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:41,620
If you're not, like, domesticated.

524
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,620
Because I don't fucking know.

525
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:55,620
And obviously I kind of thought my Laura would explain it like it's just my get up.

526
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,620
I just wear it and you know, you can be a dumb and like pain.

527
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Right?

528
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Like, you know, you're allowed to also enjoy things.

529
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,620
Like, I just, you know, like, you want to know how much of a dumb I am.

530
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Let me tell you a secret.

531
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Let me tell you.

532
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:25,620
Oh, by the way, this is the voice that I mostly use for my, my naughty audios.

533
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,620
So, so 100% a switch.

534
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,620
Shut the fuck up.

535
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,620
Shut the fuck.

536
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,620
No, let's not be guys, guys.

537
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,620
Okay, I'll educate you after this because Jesus Christ.

538
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
I can maintain it.

539
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,620
By the way, but what the fuck was I saying?

540
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,620
Where am I?

541
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,620
Because someone remind me what the hell I was saying.

542
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Again, I have, I have, I have short term memory.

543
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Audio's voice talking about being a dumb.

544
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Dom's going to enjoy things with no clue.

545
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,620
Yeah, you're just, you're just like odd titties.

546
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,620
Madam.

547
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,620
Guys, I'm, I'm, I'm elderly.

548
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:30,620
You see, so I lose track of things quite quickly.

549
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,620
You thought I was a hag.

550
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
I'm ancient.

551
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:42,620
Um, but, and then if this filters you, but it's okay, but I don't really care.

552
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Um, but Dom's like you could, they can enjoy paid.

553
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,620
Oh, I remember those.

554
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,620
I was going to make a joke.

555
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,620
Um, I'm such a dumb.

556
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,620
I'm such a, I'm such a masochist.

557
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Don't you thought shut the fuck up.

558
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,620
You piece of shit about stupid toilet.

559
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Um, I'm such a masochist that I'll sleep with a scrunchie on my wrist.

560
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,620
So it leaves a mark.

561
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,620
Putting dumb.

562
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Okay, you got me there.

563
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
You got me there.

564
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,620
I'm like fucking sweating.

565
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,620
I got like titty sweat right now under my boobies.

566
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,620
Um, uh, insider note.

567
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
Uh, I have the same exact body top.

568
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,620
I have the same exact body type as she be.

569
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,620
So my boobs are actually as big as hers and it is a hassle.

570
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,620
Let me tell you.

571
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Oh, hold on.

572
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,620
I'm asleep.

573
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Wake the fuck up.

574
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
Wake the fuck up.

575
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Oh, my parents don't walk in right now.

576
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,620
Oh, I love scuff.

577
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:02,620
Um, anyways, I'm just going to like jiggle myself around to talk official boob chart.

578
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
I don't know.

579
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,620
I think that'll be like a donut on goal.

580
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:14,620
I think, um, mome was saying, can we just talk about how annoying vtube studio.

581
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,620
I don't know if you're a vtuber watching this or if you're not a vtuber watching this.

582
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Oh, my God.

583
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,620
It's so easy just to be a vtuber.

584
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,620
It's not.

585
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,620
There's so much annoying.

586
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,620
It took me three hours to set up a fucking chat with you today.

587
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,620
Okay.

588
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:34,620
We need baby keys on screen to help she be constant.

589
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,620
Shut up vtube studio breaks.

590
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,620
Exactly.

591
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
Thank you, Emmy.

592
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
Thank you.

593
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,620
Technical difficulties, you know, their png.

594
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,620
Um, so there was a point when we were doing like, I think I'm starting to mention this.

595
00:38:47,620 --> 00:39:00,620
We did like a couple of mock streams before we did a real stream and my model just wasn't working because my the cable I think I was using just wasn't behaving.

596
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,620
Oh, I'm a soup in my mouth.

597
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,620
Um, hold on.

598
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,620
You like that?

599
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:18,620
Um, so I just had a png of my model and I was just like, and I was just talking over it and the girls were losing their minds.

600
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,620
Get some subway servers up there.

601
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
You know what?

602
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
You might tempt me.

603
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:28,620
Um, it's been 30 minutes and I've just talked about lore.

604
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,620
I haven't even talked about the like, I haven't even anyways.

605
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Yes, this is my boss.

606
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
It's not my real boss.

607
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,620
Um, it's Johnny.

608
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
No, she's not my boss.

609
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
She's not.

610
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,620
She's my co-worker.

611
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,620
This is the entirety of my management and editing team.

612
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:52,620
Um, but yes, if you caught on, yes, it's it's my boss from the beginning, which is pretty.

613
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,620
I thought that was pretty pretty shaky if you ask me in it.

614
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
Hey, your skip ahead.

615
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:10,620
Let's talk about this queen.

616
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,620
God rest her soul.

617
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:23,620
When I tell you when they handed this to me when management's like, oh, here's the sketch.

618
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:30,620
I'm like, you're telling me that this woman's dying from this some disease.

619
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,620
And there's just a guy.

620
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,620
There's a guy with a gypsy in the hospital.

621
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
A gypsy in the corner.

622
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
It looks like an SCP.

623
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
Yeah, SCP 69.

624
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Someone also did a cheeky edit of this with something.

625
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
So that was funny.

626
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,620
Um, but I, uh, this was funny as hell.

627
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,620
That was so funny.

628
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Uh, this last scene makes me feel so badass.

629
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,620
Like this last take I did with my voice and the way the beat goes.

630
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,620
I was like, oh, I'm feeling like a motherfucker.

631
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:20,620
I am feeling like the baddest bitch that ever bitched the bad before.

632
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
One of the gim stairs.

633
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
Um, but yeah, let me get out of the way.

634
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
Oh, step on me.

635
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,620
Oh, step on me.

636
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,620
She be step on me.

637
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,620
That's what you bitches sound like.

638
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,620
Yeah, I said it.

639
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Bitches.

640
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,620
Yeah, you guys all sound like that.

641
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,620
That's officially the voice that you guys have now.

642
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,620
My little, I'm a little boy slut.

643
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
That's me.

00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,620

I have a deep voice.

647
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,620
Yeah, this is what it sounds like.

648
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620

She be the toilet.

652
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,620
You sound like you're a wimp in a pussy.

653
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,620
Okay.

654
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
I'm losing my voice because I'm screaming.

655
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,620
Base pro shop.

656
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Anyways.

657
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,620
Wake me up.

658
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
Wake me up inside.

659
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,620
Uh, hold on a moment.

660
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,620
What the fuck?

661
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,620
Yeah.

662
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
I came up with the memes.

663
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
I was like, throw my titties on Changus.

664
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,620
Throw me on this.

665
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,620
Hold on.

666
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,620
Can I make this bigger?

667
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,620
Okay.

668
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620
It's me as a bunny.

669
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,620
And that's you guys.

670
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Can't live with energy.

671
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,620
Sometimes they're like, I know people are like,

672
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:25,620
I can't wait for her to be like a dummy mommy and just order me around and be really cold.

673
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,620
And, you know, what is that called when you're,

674
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,620
what type of dairy is it called when you just have no emotions?

675
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
I totally forget.

676
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,620
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

677
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
I have way too much energy to be like that.

678
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,620
Yeah.

679
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,620

I'm definitely a baka daddy.

685
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,620
But yeah.

686
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
Buns speak.

00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,620
Yeah.

00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,620
My birthday is on the 28th.

00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,620

697
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
Okay.

698
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620

I'm she be dairy.

703
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,620
When you said dairy, I thought you said dairy.

I am.

705
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
I'm lactose tolerant.

706
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
Fun fact.

707
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,620
I'll still eat some milk though, especially if it comes from a zero.

708
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,620
Moving on.

709
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,620
I'm actually two inches taller.

All right.

714
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,620
That's that's rude.

715
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,620

00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,620

00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,620
Oh good.

724
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,620

00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,620

728
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,620
I run a rum.

729
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
I need a burp.

730
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,620
I didn't mean to moan.

731
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,620
Snow cons are sus.

732
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,620
Yeah, I told I told I see you as it was lemon flavor.

733
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,620
It was my pants.

734
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,620
Now that's a burp.

735
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,620
But yeah, no, I run.

736
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,620

737
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,620
So if you hear some munching, that is.

738
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,620
That's miss some miss big mama, which you'll get a name drop for her.

739
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,620
It's a hotel and you are.

740
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,620
You are.

741
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
Well, you know what?

742
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:41,620
You can decide if you want to be a client of the hotel or if you want to be a staff person.

743
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:49,620
Do you want to serve or be served?

744
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,620
Be our guest.

745
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,620
Be our guest.

746
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,620
Don't know the rest of the lyrics.

747
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:05,620
Tie in napkin round your neck sherry and we'll provide the rest.

What's the benefit package?

751
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,620
You get 401k dental.

752
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:22,620
You also get what's it called really good health insurance.

753
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,620
Because you might take a little bit of a beating.

754
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,620
Whoops.

755
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,620
Client, please.

756
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,620

757
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,620

758
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,620
Can I be a client?

759
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,620
I don't want to.

760
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,620
I don't want to have my back door.

761
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,620
Can I be a client?

762
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,620
Is I caring?

763
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,620
No, you don't get.

764
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,620
You don't get.

00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,620
No vision.

767
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,620
You get dental because we need to keep your teeth pretty.

768
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,620
If somebody knocks them out, I just doesn't look good, you know.

769
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,620
What is the squeaky voice?

770
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,620
What are you talking about?

771
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,620
That's your voice.

772
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,620
I don't know.

773
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,620
What do you mean?

774
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,620
That's what you guys sound like.

775
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,620
I'm just mimicking what you guys sound like.

776
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,620
I think I'd like to be a.

777
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,620
No, not division, not included.

778
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,620
Yeah, you can't see.

779
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,620
I'm going to put a blindfold on you anyway is why you don't.

780
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,620
You don't need to see.

781
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,620
Do you have to pay taxes?

782
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,620
Yes, you do have to pay taxes.

783
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:33,620
We are beating the e-girl and e-boy allegations of not paying our taxes.

784
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,620
I sound like a weird bun because you are one.

785
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,620
Is this slander or bullying?

786
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,620
Why not both, you know?

787
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,620
My likes.

788
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:55,620
I could have put a lot more and I know like I see did like the whole thing or something.

789
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,620
She showed you like I ever get what it's called.

790
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,620
It's not a tier list.

791
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,620
It's whatever of all her.

792
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,620
I'm waving my arms around and that's why I'm losing tracking.

793
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,620
Oh my God, I almost threw up in my mouth again.

794
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
Jesus fuck.

795
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,620
Yeah, country sucks.

796
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:24,620
I'm just going to go further into what I like.

797
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,620
So like I'm a huge cater, not a fan.

798
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,620
I really like any sort of house music techno.

799
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:36,620
That's I really love the IC DJs because I would love to just dance in 3D while she's doing a DJ set.

800
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,620
That just be so sick.

801
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,620
Let me hold on.

802
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:51,620
Let me glance at my I'm going to go ventriloquist on me for a second while I look at my Apple music.

803
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:57,620
Let's see artists like I'm a he like I like 80s.

I like like I like rap.

I like old school rap.

809
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,620
Honestly, I like so much stuff.

810
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,620
I don't have 30 seconds to Mars on here.

811
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,620
Hell, I even like classical.

812
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,620
Hell yeah, doja cat.

813
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,620
We have that.

814
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,620
But I also like a lot of alternative music like a listen to sleep token.

815
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,620
I want to learn how to scream.

816
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,620
I want to learn how to scream so bad so I can do scream covers.

817
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,620
That is my goal.

818
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,620
I like metal.

I'm so mad.

827
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,620
Death punch broke up though.

828
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,620
I wanted to see them in concert.

829
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,620
Can you scream right now?

830
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,620
No, I can't.

I don't know what to tell you.

844

885
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,620

I have a cool story for that one.

899
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,620
I realized I only have like an hour and 15.

900
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,620

I can talk to you.

903
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,620
I only have like an hour and 15.

904
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,620
I can talk forever.

905
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,620
I don't.

906
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,620
There's a lot of food I shouldn't eat.

907
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,620
Like I shouldn't like I had pasta for lunch.

908
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,620
I shouldn't eat tomato sauce

909
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,620

00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,620

00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,620
The apper with the flappers.

915
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,620
Yeah, we don't have to cover it all.

916
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,620
You're right. You're right. You're right.

917
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,620
You're totally right.

918
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,620
It's because I just.

919
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,620

00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,620
That can't be real.

926
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,620
But yeah, I read.

927
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,620
I read a lot.

928
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,620

929
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,620
I mentioned it and not called the girls in the day.

930
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,620
I read Watership Down when I was in like fifth grade.

931
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,620

00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,620
Punch him in the dick and publish it.

938
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,620
He's literally just sitting on his ass.

939
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,620
Pulling a George R. Martin.

940
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,620

One of my my girlfriends.

951
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,620
I need to come up with a code name for her.

952
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,620
Because I'm going to call her by her real name.

953
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,620
I'm going to call her.

954
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,620
Salem.

955
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,620
Because she's witch like.

956
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,620
Salem.

957
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:34,620
She said because she's very supportive of my VTubing.

00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,620
Like a court of thorn and roses.

00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,620
Or credence.

963
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,620
Oh, credence.

964
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,620
Hey, if you guys like Emmy.

965
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,620
You should read credence.

966
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,620

00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,620

00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,620
I forget.

969
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,620
Sort of truth.

970
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,620
Actually, I have.

971
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,620
I know he said sort of truth.

972
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,620

The Witcher.

976
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,620
Books on my bookshelf.

977
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,620
I have Joe Abercombe the blade itself.

978
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,620
My favorite.

979
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,620
Series that I've read.

980
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,620
Or.

981
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,620
Well, my favorite like book series of all time.

982
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:32,620
Or actually no TV show series and kind of book series has to be.

983
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,620
The magicians.

984
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,620
The book series obviously blows the fucking show out of the water.

985
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,620
But I like the show too.

986
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,620
I also really like Brandon Sanderson.

987
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:43,620
What's.

988
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,620
What's the other dude's name that wrote.

989
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,620
Hold on.

990
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,620
Let me move over to my.

991
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,620
Where did the book go?

992
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,620
Oh, it's going to bother the crap out of me if I don't know the name.

993
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,620
Hold on.

994
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,620
Red sister by Mark Lawrence.

995
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,620
I love Mark Lawrence.

996
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,620
And let me see.

997
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,620
Why is it a lot?

998
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,620
And mind you, my dad recommends every book that I've read because of my dad's a huge reader.

999
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,620
Scott Lynch.

1000
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,620
Scott Lynch needs to also release more books because he's a great writer.

1001
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,620
How about Jordan?

1002
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,620
Yes.

1003
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,620
Just read the blade itself.

1004
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,620
What did you think?

1005
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,620
Yeah.

1006
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,620
Brandon said, I still have to read the last book in the Stormlight archive.

1007
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
I know that came out like last year.

1008
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,620
I want to get the nice, nice, really fancy hard, hard cover.

1009
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,620
Cooking.

1010
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,620
Cooking.

1011
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,620
Cooking.

1012
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,620
Cooking.

1013
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,620
Cooking.

1014
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,620
Cooking.

1015
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,620
I love to cook.

1016
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,620
You might see on my all, I've actually posted pictures of stuff that I've cooked.

1017
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,620
I definitely want to do some cooking streams.

1018
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,620
I don't know how I'm going to manage that.

1019
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:53,620
Because I like, I don't know how people do cooking streams as a VTuber, but we'll try.

1020
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,620
I know a lot of random internet shit.

1021
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,620
Like, well, did you know that?

1022
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,620
Excuse me.

1023
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,620
That humans are covered in stripes.

1024
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,620
We just can't see them, but our pets, like our cats can see them.

1025
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:21,620
I forget what the stripes are actually called, but it's on a different, I think it's like UV rays or something.

1026
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,620
Ranger.

1027
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,620
Yeah.

1028
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,620
Oh yes.

1029
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,620
I wanted to read Rangers apprentice.

1030
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,620
That's definitely on my list.

1031
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,620
Just take bow or scooch.

1032
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,620
Yeah.

1033
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,620
Yeah.

1034
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,620

But that other big, I literally watch her.

I don't know why I'm playing your name.

1037
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,620
Who also does a lot of cooking streams.

1038
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,620

00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:49,620

1044
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,620
Yes.

1045
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,620
Onigiri.

1046
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,620
I'm like, I was thinking of another Japanese food.

1047
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,620
I was like, no, not Konigiri.

1048
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,620
What's the right one?

1049
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,620
Got Connie on the brain.

1050
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,620
Whoopsies.

1051
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:16,620
When I was younger, someone broke into my house when I was 13 and I was home alone.

1052
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:28,620
And I decided to run after the guy.

1053
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:32,620
There was a grown ass man in my house and I chased him out.

1054
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:36,620
And then I called the police.

1055
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:43,620
And then my dad tried hunting for him for a very, very long time.

1056
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,620
But afterwards my parents put me in Jujitsu classes.

1057
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,620
And so I'm all, don't get it twisted.

1058
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,620
I'm only a white belt, but it doesn't mean I won't put you in the grounds.

1059
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,620
I know submissions.

1060
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,620
I'm very strong.

1061
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,620
I've taken it.

1062
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:03,620
And my school that I attended was co-ed.

1063
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:08,620
So I sparred with guys like twice my size and I still put their asses to sleep.

1064
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,620
Do not get it twisted.

1065
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,620
I will gladly knock you out.

1066
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,620
And I like to watch UFC too.

1067
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,620
I'm pretty gory like that.

1068
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,620
My mom's teaching me about gardening.

1069
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,620
I love listening to my mom talk about gardening.

1070
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,620
So I think I want to get into gardening more.

1071
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,620
And then obviously voice acting.

1072
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,620
Wow.

1073
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,620
I wouldn't have given that away.

1074
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,620
I'm only on my second fucking slide.

1075
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,620
Yeah, we already talked about this.

1076
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,620
Dollhouse.

1077
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,620
I love Dollhouse.

1078
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,620
Great show.

1079
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,620
Dungeon Mesh is good.

1080
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,620
I love Robotech.

1081
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:55,620
I literally have the OG discs on my entertainment center right now.

1082
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:59,620
Princess Bride is my all-time favorite movie.

1083
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,620
Hands down.

1084
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,620
I can quote that movie word for word.

1085
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:13,620
And I think it started a trend into the type of men I'm into because I really liked Wesley and I really liked Howl.

1086
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,620
And they look very similar in hindsight.

1087
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:23,620
And it's funny, my mom almost named me Wesley if I was a boy after him.

1088
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,620
You've never seen the Princess Bride?

1089
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,620
I've seen it like 10 times.

1090
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,620
Also Lady Hawk is good.

1091
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,620
I should put Lady Hawk on here.

1092
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,620
Haunting a Hill House.

1093
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,620
Bom.

1094
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,620
Bom.

1095
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,620
My name is Enugamentoya.

1096
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,620
You killed my father.

1097
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,620
Prepare to die.

1098
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,620
Inconceivable.

1099
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,620
Two times watch it more.

1100
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,620
Against your will.

1101
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,620
It's a great movie.

1102
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,620
What are you talking about?

1103
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,620
Yeah, I like that is my comfort.

1104
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,620
If I'm really upset, I'm watching the Princess Bride.

1105
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,620
I just binge watched a show called Harlots.

1106
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:07,620
It's about brothel madams in Victorian England.

1107
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:12,620
I like a lot of period films and shows like Tudors.

1108
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:19,620
I know Game of Thrones isn't a period, but I like older settings, but also sci-fi.

1109
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,620
Like I said, the magicians, although it's more like fantasy.

1110
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,620
But I'm trying to think of another sci-fi show that I've watched.

1111
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,620
I can't remember.

1112
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,620
Anyways, games.

1113
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,620
I'm trying to think.

1114
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,620
Again, I'm blonde.

1115
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,620
It takes me a long time and I'm a hag.

1116
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,620
I don't play a lot of games.

1117
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,620
I've never, I've gamed a lot when I was younger.

1118
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,620
My dad was a badass and he, we were poor.

1119
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,620
So he emulated games on my PC.

1120
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,620
Star Trek, yes.

1121
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,620
Star Wars, yes.

1122
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,620
Battlestar Galactica, yes.

1123
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,620
You prefer haunting a blind manor?

1124
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,620
You're dumb.

1125
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,620
Get out of here.

1126
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,620
Mods.

1127
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,620
Kick them out.

1128
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,620
If you like horror, archive 81 though.

1129
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,620
I'm so mad.

1130
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,620
Ow, I just hit my arm.

1131
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,620
I'm so mad that archive 81 got canceled.

1132
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,620
That show fucked me up.

1133
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,620
Babylon 5.

1134
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,620
I've never heard of Babylon 5.

1135
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,620
Never heard of Babylon 5.

1136
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,620
I've heard of World of Horror.

1137
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,620
I've played Alien Isolation.

1138
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:33,620
I will not do it again.

1139
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,620
I love, yeah, but I love horror though.

1140
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:41,620
I want to do like a drunk stream of amnesia, the dark descent, because I think it'd be funny.

1141
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,620
Babylon 5 is starting to get me Star Trek.

1142
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,620
Ooh, okay.

1143
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,620
All right.

1144
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,620
I have not watched Star Trek Andromeda.

1145
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,620
Have you played FNAF?

1146
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,620
Yes, I've played FNAF.

1147
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,620
Of course.

1148
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,620
You know what I didn't mention?

1149
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:06,620
I didn't like, I also watched, I used to be obsessed with Marvel.

1150
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:14,620
Like, when I was like eight or, I don't know how old I was when X-Men the Last Stand came out.

1151
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,620
No, I don't really know.

1152
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,620
But I saw that it's a shitty movie.

1153
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,620
But I just fell in love with the X-Men.

1154
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,620
So I was obsessed with the X-Men for the longest time.

1155
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,620
Looping the third.

1156
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:32,620
I've seen Looping the Third.

1157
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:41,620
And then in terms of like anime, I grew up, the first anime, again, my dad, big, big contributor to a lot of the content that I absorbed.

1158
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:46,620
He, the first anime I ever watched was The Cat Returns.

1159
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,620
Yes, I had a crush on the cat.

1160
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:49,620
X-Men 80s.

1161
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:52,620
I watched the first episode of X-Men 87.

1162
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,620
I didn't like it.

1163
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,620
Maybe I have to watch it again.

1164
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,620
I don't know.

1165
01:04:58,620 --> 01:04:59,620
2000s.

1166
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,620
It came out of 2006.

1167
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,620
Oh, damn.

1168
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:03,620
In the comics.

1169
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,620
Yes, I actually have.

1170
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,620
I have a lot of old OG Thunderbolt comics right next to me right now.

1171
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:21,620
But the thing is, I'm so pissed what they did with the Thunderbolts movie.

1172
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,620
I'm so angry.

1173
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,620
Like Thunderbolts.

1174
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:25,620
I love Thunderbolts.

1175
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:31,620
Like in that like, they just totally ruined it.

1176
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:34,620
Like they just totally retconned everything.

1177
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,620
And yeah, I'm not, I don't even want to talk about it.

1178
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,620
We can thank Cat Returns for rewinding up an anti-wife.

1179
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,620
Yeah, I guess so.

1180
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,620
Yeah, I've been watching Mushu Tensei.

1181
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:47,620
I can't pronounce it.

1182
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:53,620
I also really like, because I like dungeon meshi so much, I like went on a binge watch of watching food related enemies.

1183
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,620
Enemies.

1184
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,620
Enemies.

1185
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,620
So I watched like a little bit of food wars.

1186
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,620
It's fucking weird.

1187
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,620
I'm not finishing that.

1188
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:09,620
And then I watched my cooking skill from another world or using my cooking skill in another world or useless or whatever.

1189
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:12,620
I don't know what's the trend with some anime lately.

1190
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,620
Just having the weirdest names.

1191
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,620
So.

1192
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,620
I should be banished to catch a stream.

1193
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,620
I really like Marvel.

1194
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,620
Personally, I don't know.

1195
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,620
No DC lovers here.

1196
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,620
No DC.

1197
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,620
Fuck DC.

1198
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,620
Yeah.

1199
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,620
But I don't mind Isekai that bad.

1200
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,620
But I'm really like, people like, I hate Isekai.

1201
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,620
Isekai sucks.

1202
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,620
And then I realized I didn't know how prevalent it was in the anime.

1203
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:47,620
It was like, I grew up watching Naruto, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, staying up watching that on Adult Swim.

1204
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:51,620
And just like being like having it on mute so my parents don't hear.

1205
01:06:51,620 --> 01:07:02,620
You know the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist I watched and spoiler where it was the one where a girl gets turned into that bird thing.

1206
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:03,620
I can't quite remember.

1207
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,620
And then she's like dies and just like covered in blood and like bird feathers everywhere across his bed.

1208
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,620
That's the first thing I saw.

1209
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,620
And I was like, this is so cool.

1210
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,620
Oh no, not me.

1211
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,620
Not me.

1212
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,620
No.

1213
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,620
Not me.

1214
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,620
It was like one of the first like three episodes, I think.

1215
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:25,620
It wasn't the, it wasn't the Chimera episode.

1216
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,620
It wasn't that one.

1217
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,620
But someone asked about Junji Ito.

1218
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,620
Yes, I read every Junji Ito thing.

1219
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,620
I love Junji Ito.

1220
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:35,620
I love the art style.

1221
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,620
I love body horror.

1222
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,620
I am a fan of body horror and gore.

1223
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,620
Although, you know, weirdly enough, I don't super like slasher films.

1224
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:48,620
Like you're not going to catch me watching saw, but like I'll watch it.

1225
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:55,620
But I'm like, I prefer more in terms of horror, like spooky, like sparritism.

1226
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,620
Let's see.

1227
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,620
I've heard of Let's See.

1228
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,620
I've not watched it.

1229
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,620
It's episode two.

1230
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:02,620
Oh, okay.

1231
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,620
There you go.

1232
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,620
I've watched both Fullmetal Alchemists.

1233
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,620
I have.

1234
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,620
I remember watching PewDiePie play Corpse Party when I was younger.

1235
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,620
That was great.

1236
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,620
The ring.

1237
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,620
Yes.

1238
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,620
Psychological horror.

1239
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,620
That's right.

1240
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,620
I really liked.

1241
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:24,620
I think Archive 81 had a little bit of psychological horror.

1242
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:26,620
I like suspense.

1243
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,620
Hamels.

1244
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,620
Hamels.

1245
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,620
Joker.

1246
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,620
Hands down.

1247
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,620
You don't even have to ask.

1248
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,620
You don't even have to ask Sans the Lambs.

1249
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,620
Of course.

1250
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,620
The witch.

1251
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:39,620
That was good.

1252
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,620
And the ritual was good too.

1253
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,620
Are you into motorcycles?

1254
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,620
They're all right.

1255
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,620
I guess.

1256
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,620
I like horror visual novels.

1257
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,620
Yeah.

1258
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:55,620
I like, I remember like Ib Corpse Party, Mad Father.

1259
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,620
I have not watched Suspiria.

1260
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,620
I have not watched that.

1261
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,620
Yeah.

1262
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,620
I remember seven.

1263
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,620
You start to laugh.

1264
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:12,620
But yeah, in terms of games, like I want to play Soul's Likes.

1265
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,620
Hold on.

1266
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,620
Let me skip ahead a little bit.

1267
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,620
Let me skip ahead.

1268
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,620
So you got some names here.

1269
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,620
Little girl, big mama and big man.

1270
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,620
You already know big man is booming.

1271
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:34,620
I also call him Metro booming or the boomster or titties because he has a little pouch that makes him look like he has little titties.

1272
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:41,620
Little girl, she's named after a character from Elden Ring.

1273
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:46,620
Can you guess what her name is?

1274
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:52,620
And then big mama is Reina, which is funny because it sounds like Ronnie.

1275
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,620
But that's not where like the spelling is similar.

1276
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,620
Just rearrange the letters, but it's not.

1277
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,620
Let's see.

1278
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,620
Let's say Ronnie.

1279
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,620
No, Raya.

1280
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,620
Molina.

1281
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:06,620
No.

1282
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,620
Melania.

1283
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,620
No.

1284
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,620
Dong eater.

1285
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,620
Yeah.

1286
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,620
Yeah.

1287
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,620
Come here.

1288
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,620
Dong eater.

1289
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,620
Where is she anyways?

1290
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,620
Where's my little dong eater?

1291
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:17,620
I don't even know.

1292
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,620
Is she next to me?

1293
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,620
No.

1294
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,620
Sometimes she likes to go under my blanket under my legs.

1295
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,620
I don't know where she went.

1296
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,620
Her name is Fia, the death bed companion.

1297
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,620
I love to snuggle her.

1298
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,620
She's a snuggler, this little baby.

1299
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,620
Then I can't move because I love snuggling her death.

1300
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,620
Oh, she stinks though because she likes to fart on me and it sucks.

1301
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,620
She's really stinky farts.

1302
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:41,620
So she is, I guess, the dong eater.

1303
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,620
You know what I should have put up here for dislikes.

1304
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,620
I should have put people who have bad breath that puts me off a lot.

1305
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,620
Hate bad breath.

1306
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,620
Disgusting.

1307
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,620
Yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.

1308
01:10:55,620 --> 01:11:03,620
It's funny because I didn't know that until recently when I went over a friend's house

1309
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:08,620
and they were house sitting some rabbits that they normally don't have.

1310
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,620
And I was like, oh, I love rabbits.

1311
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,620
Bunnies are so freaking cute.

1312
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,620
Don't get me wrong.

1313
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,620
Look at me.

1314
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,620
I'm fucking sexy.

1315
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,620
Hold on, I'm trying to jiggle my titties but they weren't jiggling the way I wanted to.

1316
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,620
Don't worry yourself.

1317
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:31,620
So I was like hanging out with these bunnies and I'm petting them and I'm like, yeah, I forget.

1318
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,620
Like it's name is Harold.

1319
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,620
Harold's the hair.

1320
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:45,620
And yeah, I almost went to Anaphylactic show after because I'm also mildly allergic to dogs and cats.

1321
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:49,620
So if I like, but if I just don't touch my face, I'm fine.

1322
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:57,620
But I had rubbed my hand against my nose after petting the bunny and it was not a good.

1323
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,620
And it's funny because my mom's like, oh yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.

1324
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:07,620
And I'm like, why did I inherit the ability to be allergic to rabbits from my mom?

1325
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,620
Like I don't, what is the, but like I'll still pet a rabbit.

1326
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,620
I don't care.

1327
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,620
I'll risk my life to pet myself every day.

1328
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:25,620
You might be thinking, wow, Sheeby, you are so full of energy.

1329
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,620
You are so extrovert.

1330
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:36,620
I'm not actually, I only, I only really get this way when I have to work because I used to work in sales.

1331
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:39,620
But now I'm doing something else.

1332
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,620
So I know how to like sell stuff.

1333
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:42,620
So like buy my merch.

1334
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,620
I don't have to tell you twice.

1335
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,620
Do it.

1336
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,620
Buy my merch.

1337
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,620
I'll show it to you later.

1338
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,620
Let me take a step on my team.

1339
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,620
I look so funny when I'm drinking.

1340
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:09,620
Oh, I don't even know where I put the.

1341
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,620
There it is.

1342
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,620
Can I just like drop this in here?

1343
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,620
Oh, I can't.

1344
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:22,620
Can I just download this?

1345
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:28,620
My link for my merch is in my description.

1346
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,620
Check the description down below and you can get merch.

1347
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,620
What's there?

1348
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,620
Oh, please.

1349
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:45,620
Can I please just copy and paste for the love of Christ Almighty.

1350
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,620
My voice is starting to crack though.

1351
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:48,620
There it is.

1352
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,620
Look at it.

1353
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,620
I got my own merch.

1354
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,620
That's it.

1355
01:13:54,620 --> 01:14:01,620
It's funny because like one of my goals being a Vtuber, I was like, I always got my own merch and then I'm signed on and I get merch.

1356
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:08,620
And I was like, I've always wanted to voice in a video game and I'm signed on and I'm in a video game which is coming out soon.

1357
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,620
I've seen some of the promotional art for the game.

1358
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,620
Oh my God.

1359
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,620
You're definitely going to be seeing my cotton bum.

1360
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,620
That's all I can say.

1361
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,620
But yeah, go check that out.

1362
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,620
Check out the other girls merch too as well.

1363
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:29,620
Make sure that you look at the description below and yeah.

1364
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,620
We've got some cool standees.

1365
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:44,620
So if you want to, you know, have me on your desk so I can like and you can like put a little sticky note under my head that just says like you fucking suck or something like I'm salting you.

1366
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:49,620
And then I got a key chain and then I got, um, what else do I got?

1367
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:53,620
I got a sweatshirt and sweatpants and I think I want to go for myself too.

1368
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,620
Let me get rid of this.

1369
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,620
Sorry.

1370
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:02,620
Again, the bun speak voice comes, comes out when I'm excited.

1371
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,620
Put in the jar.

1372
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,620
Excuse me.

1373
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,620
Do not, do not put me in the jar, please.

1374
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,620
Please don't put me in the jar.

1375
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,620
After getting to a car accident, I jumped off a cliff.

1376
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,620
That is true.

1377
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:30,620
I was sleeping over at my friend's house and we were going to get McDonald's.

1378
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:35,620
It was like 2am and she's like, yeah, what's the McDonald's?

1379
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,620
And I'm like, yeah, let's get frosty.

1380
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:41,620
So we are, I'm like, I forgot what it was, but I wasn't driving because I wasn't old enough to drive yet.

1381
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,620
Nine out of ten.

1382
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,620
Okay.

1383
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,620
Thank you.

1384
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:45,620
Eight out of ten.

1385
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,620
Perfect.

1386
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,620
Oh, six out of ten.

1387
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:49,620
Perfect.

1388
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,620
Nine out of ten.

1389
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,620
And so we're driving.

1390
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,620
We're driving.

1391
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:03,620
And then this person had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel while she was texting.

1392
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,620
So like double whammy.

1393
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:13,620
And so she fell asleep and she, her foot just pressed into the pedal and she rammed us from behind.

1394
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:18,620
And then we fishtailed and spun out on the highway.

1395
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,620
It was crazy.

1396
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:25,620
And she, the other driver, flipped over the barrier.

1397
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:29,620
And so we're pulled over.

1398
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:33,620
We're like off in the middle pulled over kind of.

1399
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:38,620
And my friend runs across the highway.

1400
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,620
Like, yeah, it's 2am.

1401
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,620
But people are still driving.

1402
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,620
She runs across the highway to check on the other driver.

1403
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,620
I'm calling 911.

1404
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,620
You know what?

1405
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,620
We literally all walked away.

1406
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:53,620
Fine.

1407
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:54,620
Like I didn't get injured.

1408
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,620
I had like a little bit of whiplash.

1409
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,620
So did my friend.

1410
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:09,620
And the other driver who flipped over the guardrail didn't, didn't, she only had like a little bit of scratches on her hands because like her phone was in her hand when she fell asleep.

1411
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,620
It was crazy.

1412
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:18,620
So I call my mom to come pick me up because I'm like, I just want to go home and be with my mommy.

1413
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,620
And yeah.

1414
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,620
Oh, lucky that I should like 100%.

1415
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:23,620
We all should have freaking died.

1416
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:26,620
Like it was, it was, it was crazy.

1417
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,620
I don't, it was really crazy.

1418
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:31,620
But um, and I'm like, you know what, you know what I should do?

1419
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:37,620
I should jump off a cliff because the next day I was invited to go to this quarry and the quarry is this place where

1420
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:43,620
there's like a, it's like a, kind of got water hole, but it's, there's cliffs all around.

1421
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:48,620
It's like an old rock quarry, but it's full of water and people usually go and jump and swim in there.

1422
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:57,620
And so I'm like, mom, can I, like I was invited to go with my friends and I'm like, mom, can I please, can I please go to the quarry with the girls?

1423
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,620
And my mom's like, yeah.

1424
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:04,620
And I'm like, and then I got there.

1425
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,620
One, it was a, it was a dump, by the way.

1426
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:14,620
Like don't anytime, any place that there's like not publicly maintained.

1427
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,620
Like there was like beer bottles broken.

1428
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,620
I'm pretty sure I saw needles.

1429
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,620
There was like shit everywhere.

1430
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:26,620
I cut my foot on a bottle walking barefoot and then I slipped on a rock.

1431
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:34,620
And then there's a part of the cliff that's 50 feet up.

1432
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,620
And I'm like, you know what?

1433
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:40,620
Let me jump off.

1434
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,620
I almost died before.

1435
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:45,620
Let's try it again.

1436
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:50,620
Cue the Kermit jumping off the building gift.

1437
01:18:50,620 --> 01:19:02,620
And I hit the water and I think I actually got worse whiplash from that because I landed like kind of folded in half and I snapped back up.

1438
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:08,620
And yeah, what was fun, I can just say, it's just a fun story to tell.

1439
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:11,620
Do you know that the voice one?

1440
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:15,620
I lost two of my bunny lives.

1441
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,620
I don't know, bunnies have lives like cats, but yeah.

1442
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,620
I met the voice of Mario.

1443
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,620
He was pretty sick, came into my job once.

1444
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,620
I don't even know why he was there.

1445
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:31,620
And he's like taking pictures and videos with some of my coworkers and I'm just there like, oh my God, my child.

1446
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:34,620
Oh my God, my childhood is right in front of me.

1447
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:39,620
Mario, I used to fucking play the shit out of Mario on the Wii.

1448
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:43,620
And he's like, oh, do you want a picture?

1449
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:58,620
I'm like, no, no, no, I couldn't because like as someone who has been in the entertainment industry for a while outside of VTubing, I know how annoying it is to have people walk up to you and be like, can I get a picture?

1450
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,620
So I was like, oh, no, I'll just sit back.

1451
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,620
But he was just like, he was so nice.

1452
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:15,620
He insisted on taking a picture and I sent it to my parents and my dad was like, oh my God, my mom was like, yes, Charles, he is the sweetest, the sweetest person ever.

1453
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,620
I will tell you that, not Chris Pratt.

1454
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,620
It was not Chris Pratt.

1455
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,620
That would be funny though.

1456
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:25,620
Where did my, okay, there it is.

1457
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,620
I'm losing my voice.

1458
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,620
I want to be a souls like first souls.

1459
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:31,620
I was going to play Bloodborne, but they didn't do a port like I wanted.

1460
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,620
So come on, Sony.

1461
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:39,620
Looks like, I don't know if I can learn Japanese, but I would like to.

1462
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,620
I know a little bit of Spanish.

1463
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,620
I know a little bit of French.

1464
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:44,620
Who knows?

1465
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,620
Who knows?

1466
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:47,620
Have you hit 100K views?

1467
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:48,620
That'd be so cool.

1468
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,620
Hit 10K subs.

1469
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:54,620
I'm almost halfway there, which is crazy to me.

1470
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,620
Crazy German.

1471
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,620
How are you live?

1472
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:58,620
Don't know.

1473
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,620
I am Scottish too.

1474
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:09,620
So I could try to learn Scots and feel like I'm not culturally appropriating or something.

1475
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,620
Yeah.

1476
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,620
Shadow of the Erd Tree soon.

1477
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:12,620
I know.

1478
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,620
I know people have asked me like, are you going to play that on stream?

1479
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:19,620
I don't know why, but Elden Ring is a comfort game to me.

1480
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:25,620
I don't know if I'll play it on stream because that is a game that pulled me through

1481
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,620
a very, very tough situation.

1482
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:30,620
You know, you get down in the dumps.

1483
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,620
Got that mental Illinois.

1484
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:36,620
And that's, that is a game I just put poured so many hours into.

1485
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:37,620
Yes, a comfort game.

1486
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,620
You, we be like, how is the souls like a comfort game?

1487
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:50,620
But like, it was, it was a way to helpfully kind of express my frustration on a video.

1488
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:54,620
Although I have broken a pair of headphones before, so I can't really talk of headphones I'm wearing right now.

1489
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:59,620
I actually broke while playing a lot as a PA smash, smash them on the ground.

1490
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:07,620
But it was just like, I liked the dopamine I got from beating a boss from coming with the builds.

1491
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:12,620
It was, it was really fun to nerd out on something I normally don't nerd out on.

1492
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:16,620
Because again, like I've said in the past, I played a lot of CSGO.

1493
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:20,620
I played Overwatch, not playing Overwatch 2.

1494
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,620
I played a lot of like FPS games.

1495
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,620
Like I play a lot of cod.

1496
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:32,620
I didn't like I play a lot of Valorant, but I'm not like in the last year or so.

1497
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,620
I haven't been playing any FPSs.

1498
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,620
And I've been playing like inscription.

1499
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,620
I've been playing, you know, some horror games.

1500
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,620
I've been playing, I'm trying to think of more games that I've played.

1501
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,620
The coffin of Andy and Laylay I've played.

1502
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,620
Your CS2 account got hacked.

1503
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,620
Oh no.

1504
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,620
Yeah, I gambled like 1000s of skins away.

1505
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,620
So fuck that game.

1506
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:04,620
I do want to play buckshot roulette because that, they have like the best fucking music.

1507
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:08,620
Almost like every time.

1508
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:13,620
Neo and Neo 2 for so, wait, hold on a second.

1509
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:18,620
Neo is a souls like.

1510
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,620
I didn't even know that.

1511
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,620
I also play a lot of Skyrim.

1512
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,620
Plates of Minecraft, although I'm not good at Minecraft.

1513
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:30,620
Yeah, I'm going to mow you guys down at a convention, by the way.

1514
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:36,620
So like, although as Strani mentioned, we were kind of gypped by that place, which really sucked.

1515
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:39,620
Like I really wanted to do the convention.

1516
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:45,620
But hopefully next year, or maybe, you know, another convention pops up.

1517
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,620
Hades, I want to play Hades.

1518
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,620
I want to play Hades.

1519
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,620
Do you mod Skyrim?

1520
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,620
Yes.

1521
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,620
Although I played it on mod at first.

1522
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,620
I was recently playing Oblivion as well.

1523
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:04,620
We're going to be playing Vampire of the Masquerade at the end of the week.

1524
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,620
And we are turning those boobs up.

1525
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:11,620
I want to play more retro games.

1526
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:12,620
Travel.

1527
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,620
I want to do Off Club with the Girls.

1528
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1529
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:31,620
And then if you are a streamer or a Vtuber watching this, please, just because I'm a lewd ASMR creator, please do not get off put on hanging out with me.

1530
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:32,620
I don't bite.

1531
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:33,620
I just feel bad.

1532
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:45,620
I was, I knew that, like, for example, for the watch along stuff, like a lot of people were kind of going to snub us because of the content that we do, but we do do normal content on YouTube.

1533
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:49,620
And then there are companies that are say so.

1534
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:58,620
I'm doing air quotes that you cannot see that a backshot roulette that do worse than us.

1535
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:04,620
So, like, I, I don't, I just want to be friends with people.

1536
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:09,620
I want to, you know, branch out, network, help the other girls network.

1537
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:14,620
It's, I probably won't have any collab set up for a bit just so I can get my bearings.

1538
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:18,620
But what, no lewd tuba.

1539
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,620
No, what are you talking about?

1540
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,620
I'm the most holy and say so.

1541
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:29,620
I don't know what you, I've, hold on, wait.

1542
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:37,620
I am so say so from the head up.

1543
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,620
Our nice Christian.

1544
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,620
Yeah, I'm a good Christian girl.

1545
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,620
You know, I was a nun.

1546
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:45,620
You won't believe it, but I was a nun.

1547
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,620
Is that too on the nose?

1548
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:52,620
How long?

1549
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,620
Short amount of time.

1550
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:59,620
This is too class.

1551
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:04,620
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

1552
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:05,620
Okay.

1553
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:07,620
Is there my tags?

1554
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,620
What do you guys want your fan name to be?

1555
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,620
Because I don't know.

1556
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:14,620
I don't know.

1557
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,620
Hold on.

1558
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:21,620
Let me, I'm on a hold on ventral cause moment I want to go into my notes on my phone.

1559
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:26,620
And I'll tell you what I had for ideas at first.

1560
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:32,620
So Strani initially came up with love bunnies and I'm like, that's too long.

1561
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:35,620
And then I was like bumpkins cause I'm bum.

1562
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:38,620
I'm a bumkin jackrabbit.

1563
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,620
Cause yeah.

1564
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:44,620
Excuse me whippersnappers cause I'm a hag and I have a whip.

1565
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:46,620
Whaskley rabbits.

1566
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:51,620
Do you know a group of rabbits is called a fluffle?

1567
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:56,620
Fluffle bros, bun buddies, bum buddies.

1568
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:00,620
But then the other day it came to me in a dream.

1569
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,620
Harem.

1570
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,620
Harem.

1571
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,620
Harem.

1572
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:10,620
You are my harem.

1573
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,620
Shibbatees.

1574
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,620
Shibbatees toilets.

1575
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:20,620
Or I was also thinking harlets but like spell it like hairlets.

1576
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:23,620
You are my harlets.

1577
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,620
Or I could be, yeah or harem.

1578
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:29,620
So the nun bun, yeah that's not going to flow.

1579
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:33,620
Fluffers, you know those fluffles on Club Penguin.

1580
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:37,620
So I didn't realize that's probably where they got the name from.

1581
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:40,620
Alright let's do a vote, let's do a vote.

1582
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,620
I don't know how to do that.

1583
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,620
Start a poll.

1584
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,620
Okay, ask a question.

1585
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,620
What name?

1586
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,620
Adoption.

1587
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:53,620
Harem.

1588
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,620
Harlets.

1589
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,620
Hold on.

1590
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:00,620
Harem full of hall.

1591
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:03,620

One actor.

1593
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,620
Shibbatees.

1594
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,620
Shibbatees nuts.

1595
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,620
How about that?

1596
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,620
What was it?

1597
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,620
Bun-bums.

1598
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,620
Okay I'll put bun-bums for you.

1599
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:23,620

If you put shibbatee, alright I'll put that for you.

1604
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,620
Alright.

1605
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,620
Rabin turns.

1606
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,620
That's pretty good.

1607
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,620
I can't call you bun sluts guys.

1608
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:04,620
Although I already say a lot of bad things.

1609
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,620
You're not my dom-

1610
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:07,620
You're not doming me.

1611
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,620
I'm doming you.

1612
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,620
The only chungus-

1613
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,620
Hey what's up chungusies.

1614
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,620
Back with a brand new video.

1615
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:17,620
I'm ready for some ASMR.

1616
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:18,620
All I see are three options.

1617
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:19,620
Oh did I fuck it up?

1618
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,620
It's fine.

1619
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:21,620
Don't worry about it.

1620
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,620
Hello good evening mathem.

1621
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,620
Good evening.

1622
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:25,620
And you sip some more tea.

1623
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,620
I'm a power bottom.

1624
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,620
Someone time him out.

1625
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,620
Time is a bit joke.

1626
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:36,620
I am my dom.

1627
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,620
Do not think that you can get away with bullying me.

1628
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:43,620
Again I will fuck you up.

1629
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,620
Are you British?

1630
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,620
And whatever you want me to be darling.

1631
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:47,620
You want me to be British?

1632
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,620
I can be British.

1633
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,620
You want a bottle of water?

1634
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:51,620
I got you.

1635
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,620
Here catch.

1636
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:57,620
Tea is the best British beverage known to man.

1637
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:01,620
I'm drinking a ginger-

1638
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,620
Ginger lemon tea.

1639
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:06,620
I definitely want to get-

1640
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:09,620
I have like a whole thing of tea in my cupboard actually.

1641
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,620
I can pull you.

1642
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,620
Sweet tea.

1643
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,620
Now I know you from the south sweetheart.

1644
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,620
If you like French-

1645
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,620
I heard French accent.

1646
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,620
If you like sweet tea.

1647
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:26,620
I can do a French accent as well.

1648
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,620
It is not as good.

1649
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:34,620
My name is Shibi Kotemban.

1650
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:39,620
I would like to fuck you in the ass.

1651
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:41,620
Yes.

1652
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,620
Sweet tea.

1653
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,620
Yes, Baguette.

1654
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:50,620
I live in France.

1655
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,620
Hi Amy.

1656
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,620
Amy is like shut up.

1657
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,620
I think Amy speaks Quebecois.

1658
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:01,620
So.

1659
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,620
The sac les bleus.

1660
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,620
On les deux fromage.

1661
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:09,620
Do you know how I do the French accent?

1662
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:15,620
I think of Lumière from the beauty and the beast.

1663
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:18,620
All I have to do is in my head say

1664
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,620
Don't you know she is the one.

1665
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:21,620
And then I can do it.

1666
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,620
Je dors madame.

1667
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,620
You better.

1668
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:25,620
Croissant.

1669
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:28,620
I am not Canadian.

1670
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,620
All from fucking America.

1671
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:32,620
Fuck yeah.

1672
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,620
Suck my.

1673
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,620
Anyways.

1674
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:40,620
French-

1675
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,620
I have that je ne sais quoi.

1676
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,620
Beauty and the beast is front.

1677
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,620
Are you kidding me right now?

1678
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,620
Are you kidding me right now?

1679
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,620
Finish the sentence.

1680
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:59,620
We got some Canadians.

1681
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,620
We got some Europeans.

1682
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,620
We got them all.

1683
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,620
Do you see Los Muthrobs?

1684
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:07,620
Yes.

1685
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,620
Actually no.

1686
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,620
I don't like musicals in Brooklyn.

1687
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:12,620
I am walking here.

1688
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:15,620
But when I do a Brooklyn accent

1689
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:18,620
I just start sounding like I am from Jersey.

1690
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,620
Or I can sound like your Jewish aunt.

1691
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,620
You know your brother was a doctor.

1692
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,620
You know.

1693
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,620
Uncle did that once.

1694
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,620
Bastard.

1695
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,620
Pack the fucking kind.

1696
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,620
Have a yard kid.

1697
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,620
I swear to God.

1698
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:38,620
Do not come at me with that shit.

1699
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,620
Alabama.

1700
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,620
I fuck my sister.

1701
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:46,620
That's Alabama accent.

1702
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,620
I can't do Austrian.

1703
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,620
Australian is one I can't do

1704
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:54,620
because I just end up sounding British.

1705
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,620
Roll that.

1706
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:04,620
Run.

1707
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:07,620
Oh boy.

1708
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:11,620
You guys get to have her after me.

1709
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,620
That sounds weird.

1710
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:17,620
You guys get to have her after I am done with her.

1711
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:19,620
All right.

1712
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:20,620
So it looks like.

1713
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,620
It looks like it was harem.

1714
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,620
Okay guys you are the harem.

1715
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:26,620
I am losing my voice.

1716
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,620
Oh shit.

1717
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:28,620
Where did my chat go?

1718
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,620
No I don't want to see the viewer count.

1719
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,620
Fuck.

1720
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:41,620
Let me just talk with the girls real quick.

1721
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,620
Damn.

1722
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:47,620
When I tell you.

1723
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,620
I was so.

1724
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:52,620
Worried.

1725
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:54,620
That I am like okay.

1726
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:55,620
Oh I forgot to shoot.

1727
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,620
I made art too by the way.

1728
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:58,620
Of the girls.

1729
01:33:58,620 --> 01:33:59,620
I just forgot.

1730
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,620
I didn't.

1731
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,620
Like I had pictures for like a lot of my likes.

1732
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:03,620
I just didn't.

1733
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:05,620
Toggle them because I was just.

1734
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:06,620
Too lazy.

1735
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:09,620
Where is it?

1736
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:11,620
Whoop.

1737
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:13,620
Throw that off to the side.

1738
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:15,620
Oh shit.

1739
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:16,620
I don't know what the fuck I am moving.

1740
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,620
I am a smart of the girls.

1741
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,620
I am my iPad real quick like.

1742
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:24,620
So these girls.

1743
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:26,620
I love them to death.

1744
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,620
You do not understand.

1745
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,620
I will kill.

1746
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,620
I will hurt someone.

1747
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,620
If you cross.

1748
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,620
You think you are thinking I am joking.

1749
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:38,620
You are thinking I am not even going to put on toggles.

1750
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,620
Because that will just be stupid.

1751
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,620
If you hurt these girls feelings.

1752
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,620
If you make them cry.

1753
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,620
If you leave a bad comment.

1754
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,620
I will.

1755
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:52,620
You don't think I will.

1756
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,620
But I know how to find you.

1757
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:57,620
Okay.

1758
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,620
You better be nice.

1759
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,620
I would die for these girls.

1760
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,620
Better make them smile.

1761
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:08,620
Down bad com.

1762
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,620
What if they want you to find us?

1763
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:12,620
Well.

1764
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,620
We might end up in the bottom of a ditch then.

1765
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:18,620
But.

1766
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,620
I am starting to sound like Mercy the way I am talking.

1767
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:24,620
But yeah.

1768
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:27,620
Strani feels like my sister.

1769
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,620
We are on the same wavelength.

1770
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:33,620
She said in her debut that.

1771
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,620
I was supposed to be her in another life.

1772
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:38,620
And dude.

1773
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,620
That just.

1774
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:40,620
Oh.

1775
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,620
I want to make me cry.

1776
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:42,620
Because that's just.

1777
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:43,620
She's so talented.

1778
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:44,620
And I can't.

1779
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:48,620
Tearing up a little bit.

1780
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:49,620
Just nice.

1781
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,620
And then is her so sweet.

1782
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,620
Is her the sweetest person.

1783
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,620
Like I can't.

1784
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:57,620
Like I just love hearing her talk.

1785
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,620
She's so helpful.

1786
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,620
Like.

1787
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,620
She's.

1788
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,620
She is.

1789
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,620
She's also just crazy good at games.

1790
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,620
It's just.

1791
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:06,620
She's nasty.

1792
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:08,620
She's just awesome.

1793
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,620
And I just love hearing her talk.

1794
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,620
And encouraging me.

1795
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:13,620
Cause like I just know everything's going to be okay.

1796
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:14,620
I see.

1797
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,620
I see.

1798
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:16,620
I see my girl.

1799
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,620
She's the first person I talked to.

1800
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,620
We're the first two people.

1801
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,620
She was accepted before me.

1802
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:23,620
And he wrote my eyes.

1803
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:24,620
Because I'm crying.

1804
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:26,620
Tearing up a little bit.

1805
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,620
Cause I love them.

1806
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,620
I see was the first person I talked to in the server.

1807
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,620
And he immediately headed off.

1808
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,620
She's so sweet.

1809
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,620
She's so down to earth.

1810
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,620
She loves her cats.

1811
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:35,620
I love my cats.

1812
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:38,620

1813
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,620
She's so wonderful.

1814
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:41,620
And so talented.

1815
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,620
And.

1816
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:45,620
I don't do anything for her.

1817
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:46,620
Emmy is so.

1818
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:49,620
Also one of the most fucking talented people she told me.

1819
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,620
She's like I applied to other companies.

1820
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:52,620
And they said.

1821
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:54,620
No.

1822
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:55,620
And I'm like huh.

1823
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:57,620
She could play piano.

1824
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,620
She can sing well.

1825
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:00,620
She's a fucking amazing artist.

1826
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:03,620
Holy crap.

1827
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,620
Like I don't.

1828
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,620
You guys don't even know.

1829
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:11,620
Like there's some things you don't know behind the scenes.

1830
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:13,620
And I'm like how are you not picked up.

1831
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,620

1832

Yeah.

1835
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:20,620
She could dunk.

1836
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,620
But she's also just the sweetest.

1837
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:24,620
And I love her.

1838
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:25,620
You're talking about her rats.

1839
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:27,620
Oh my God.

1840
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:28,620
And then mercy.

1841
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,620
Mercy.

1842
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:30,620
Mercy.

1843
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,620
Wow.

01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:33,620
Like me and her.

1845
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:35,620
Thick as thieves.

1846
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:36,620
It's bad.

1847
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:39,620
We're bad together.

1848
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,620
We're so fucking toxic.

1849
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:42,620
But in a good way.

1850
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:43,620
In terms of like.

1851
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:45,620
Like we're just like.

1852
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:47,620

01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:50,620

I just love her.

1858
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:59,620
She's like if I need a bitch and moan about something.

1859
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:00,620
She's the one I'll go to.

1860
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:02,620
And then.

1861
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:04,620

And I'm like.

1863
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:06,620
Oh my thing died again.

01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:08,620
Cause I'm just so excited talking about mercy.

1865
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,620
And.

1866
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,620
I just like she just cheers me up.

1867
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,620
I remember I forget what happened.

1868
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:18,620
I think.

1869
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:22,620
I was worried about like I said before like my job interview with.

1870
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:23,620
Going to their job.

1871
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:25,620
And she's like you're going to fucking get this shit.

1872
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:26,620
Fuck.

1873
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:29,620
And like you know mercy might be coming off as shot.

1874
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:30,620
She's not.

1875
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:31,620
She's just warming up.

1876
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:33,620
I'll tell you that right now.

1877
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,620

She has my back.

1880
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:39,620
She has all these girls backs.

1881
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:40,620

01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:41,620

Perfect castings.

1885
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,620
I wouldn't.

1886
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,620
Think of.

1887
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,620
Another way to cast any of them.

1888
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:52,620
Cause people are like.

1889
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,620
Oh it's this person's this person's this person's this person's.

01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:58,620
And then like everything just fell into place perfectly.

1891
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:00,620
And.

1892
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:02,620
They're just.

1897
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,620
Well you don't get that and sometimes in gens.

You don't get that sometimes in gens.

1899
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:15,620
But.

1900
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,620

Moment knew how to pick them.

1906
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,620

So we're going to go over.

1915
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:49,620
Some arrows.

1916
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,620
Oh wow.

1917
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,620
Oh my god.

1918
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,620
I'm gonna have it cover you guys.

1919
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,620
My voice is gone.

1920
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,620
My neighbors are walking by again.

1921
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,620
Put it right there.

1922
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,620
We're going to go quick through these because it only got like.

1923
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:05,620
40 minutes.

1924
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,620
Do you have permission to fluff my ears?

1925
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:07,620
No.

1926
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,620
Do not touch me unless I give you permit.

1927
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:10,620
Well actually.

1928
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,620
You did ask permission but no.

1929
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:17,620
Is it true that looking rabbits hold on a second.

1930
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:18,620
Let me just.

1931
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,620
I'm like looking wrong.

1932
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:28,620
There we go.

1933
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:29,620
Now I'm facing the right direction.

1934
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,620
Is it true that looking a rabbit's foot brings good luck?

1935
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:33,620
Yes.

1936
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,620
You during some sessions.

1937
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:41,620
I know I have people travel far and wide just to lick my feet.

1938
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,620
Because I'm pretty good luck.

1939
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,620
Yeah.

1940
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,620
They think it's like oh if I have a rabbit's foot.

1941
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:49,620
It's.

1942
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:53,620
Licking a rabbit's foot is the correct terminology by the way.

1943
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:59,620
I heard that you're a distant relative of Jessica Rabbit.

1944
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,620
Of who framed your rabbit fame.

1945
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:04,620
Could you please say in your hottest voice.

1946
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:05,620
I'm not bad.

1947
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:06,620
I was drawn that way.

1948
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:07,620
Okay.

1949
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:08,620
Hold on.

1950
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:09,620
My voice is gone so I need to.

1951
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:11,620
I'm not bad.

1952
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:14,620
I'm just drawn that way.

1953
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:18,620
That was bad but my voice is going so.

1954
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:21,620
As a rabbit are you big.

1955
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:22,620
Are you scared of big hawks.

1956
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,620
No.

1957
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:26,620
They'll punch a hawk.

1958
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:30,620
I'm not bad.

1959
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:32,620
I'm not bad.

1960
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,620
I'm just drawn that way.

1961
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:36,620
That was bad but my voice is going so.

1962
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,620
Elevator.

1963
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:41,620
Anyway.

1964
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,620

1967
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:52,620

1968
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:58,620
Mommy decided to even talk other the word I want to be.

1969
01:41:58,620 --> 01:41:59,620
I want to make a corporate.

1970

I was like I want to be in it so I you know.

1971
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:03,620
I don't know.

1972
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:04,620
I don't know how I got here.

1973
