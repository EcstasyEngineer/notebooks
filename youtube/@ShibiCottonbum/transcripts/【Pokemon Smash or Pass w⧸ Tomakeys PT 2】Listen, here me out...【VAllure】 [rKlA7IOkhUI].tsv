393080	394520	stuff
394520	397820	Let me see. I just have to click through a bunch of crap and hope that it works
399600	401600	Start singing or something
414200	423360	Why I want it it doesn't want to pick that up hold on maybe if I go to properties
432800	436760	That was really good though, it was really good too, they'll never know oh
439800	442840	What if I do say something
444480	448400	Why doesn't it want to pick up on what?
452000	454000	Maybe that'll be a bummer
456720	462960	Just from Firefox. Oh, there it is there they go. Yeah, there you are. Okay. Let me turn you down a bit
464840	466840	PoE fixed
467880	469880	Harlots she's here
470320	479880	Curse collab never curse couldn't be us. We're so lucky everything works out for us
482520	488840	Only members can hear her voice. I would be interesting. She was spitting bars. You guys missed out
489560	492000	Let me pull up the smash or pass window
493200	495200	hell yeah, uh
496080	498560	Trinket is currently cooking up a mup itself
499880	502440	I am are you giving yourself a Scooby-Doo caller?
504240	506240	That's always been in the plans
507680	510520	Up always the jam. I love it
511440	517400	Because Scooby-Doo is well, he's not my first choice husband, but he's definitely like
517960	519960	on the list of
520160	523800	Cartoon characters that would be an automatic smash for me. Yeah
524440	526240	Yeah
526240	532000	But like if I take Scooby I have to take the rest of the the mystery game you understand I understand
532640	534000	because like
534000	539800	Actually, I was talking about this on Sunday because I've been on a real Omegaverse kick lately. Mm-hmm
540600	543600	And so I yeah, I sent me some of my diverse stuff
545320	551040	Because I've been recommended to it by in budding friendship, but I'm really enjoying it, but
552120	555720	In my mind, right? Mm-hmm in my mind
556240	559440	There is like this the Scooby-Doo game, right?
560080	562680	Chaggy is very much an alpha
564120	566120	And so and so is
566800	568480	Okay
568480	575920	Fred is a very beta male. Okay, but he's got Omega tendencies. All right
576960	578960	Daphne is a straight-up
579360	585640	Beta with Omega tendencies, but she's more like badass. All right, that's beta and then
586240	589200	Velma is nothing but pure Omega energy
590320	596680	Like Velma's been with everybody on the crew. Velma's just like the comfort creature in the mystery ink machine
601680	603680	I never would have thought of this like
607880	611760	If the gang or Omegaverse, that's you know
612600	619200	That's just that's just that's just how it goes. That's just how it be. I don't think I'm wrong. I
621200	628320	Think I'm more right than anything honestly. Yeah, Trinket's getting me into Omegaverse stuff. So blame her for anything
629280	634840	Like if madam she be starts calling you guys submissive and readable some of you might be Omega's
636360	640080	Well, it looks like I have some inappropriate stuff on my screen, but I promise I don't
641760	643480	You know
643480	649880	The whole stream is gonna be inappropriate, but you know pop offs pop off singular window. That's blurred pop off
652000	657000	It's from the the sucker punch stream, I know I was there
658880	660880	Yes, I know you were there I
661960	667000	Really like suck a sucker punch with all you guys. It was really good. Did you like it?
667000	671720	I mean, I was a little confused, but I see where it's going for yeah
672040	677920	Like it's um, it's like American McGee's Alice in Wonderland. Yeah
678800	683400	But like a little more a little more nuance. Mm-hmm
683960	687320	Like it's a it's a fantasy within a fantasy
689280	694440	Within a real situation that she's just dissociating the whole time with precisely
697360	699360	It's very oops, it's very
702280	706240	Frick did I accidentally smash the wooden version
707720	712480	So I'm so glad that that manlet didn't say her at the very oh, yeah
713400	720120	Anything that he wanted from the situation. Yeah Oscar Oscar Isaac got what was coming from blue
720120	725860	And then like and then he was a snitch at the very end. I know it was ridiculous
726500	729300	He's oh, he's so frustrating, but pretty
731420	735140	Like that the girls actually died that the orderlies kill them
735140	738300	I think the order that's what I was thinking about as I was falling asleep
739220	741220	after stream, I'm like
741380	743860	Because every time I watch the movie I like think of other
744500	748100	things like different like parallels and stuff and I'm like cuz
748860	754860	Doc the doctor never said that two other patients died. She just said she started a fire
755300	760020	And got let one escape some but I'm I still think that they died a hundred percent
760020	763700	You know, you know what could have happened because like and like insane
763700	767100	Asylums were so bad during the time period that I'm presuming this yeah
767100	772500	It looks like it was like the 50s or 60s or something like they might have died due to treatment
774500	780020	With their death by just giving it to an orderly because the orderlies would take patients away. Yeah
780580	782580	That's a good. That's a very
783180	785180	Good observe
785180	788740	Observation hundred percent. Sorry. I'm half asleep so I can barely form words
789540	792580	That's okay. I've got more than double words. I
794180	801320	Didn't do like the New York Times wordal bullshit, but like I'll I'll make up some I'll make up some nouns and some adjectives for you
801820	804260	A E I O U Y
804900	807940	Okay, W X nice
808620	810540	Fabulous
810540	816900	Maybe maybe is maybe a cue the maybe a cue a rare cue in there a rare cue
820660	822660	I'm barely following
824420	826420	All right
826420	831300	How are you going with your Muppet version we might we might transform to Muppets I
832220	836340	Guess I just got to do the one thing for the hair and then
837500	839500	Let's see
840540	844900	All I got to do is do my little pinkies little pinkies little pinkie poos
845540	849940	Yeah, my little pinkie poos it it makes it makes the look. I'm very fashionable
850220	853780	You always have to have a bit of pop, you know, I agree
856100	858100	Pull up my food you took
858980	861700	So I can just have my Muppet self next to me
862340	866140	Because there there is a Muppet, but it's of the monkey. Oh
866980	870420	Yeah, I'm Toma like how you call her the monkey
883940	886940	Ignore the random browser source on my screen
889140	891140	There we are
892140	895700	Wait, I'll have to go into
897500	900420	Flip it horizontally, I do have to flip it horizontally
902140	904540	Or we swap places because of the way that I
907740	909740	Looks like we're gonna have a great conversation
910460	914740	It's like my mic just constantly on in this call. What the hell I
915900	917900	Mean, there's a little bit of
918740	920740	Was it my fucking AC
920900	924660	But that's not that's not bad. I kind of like it. It's a nice background
925460	929260	I appreciate that everyone likes my background noise. I
930060	932460	Mean, it's it's like the white noise
932460	936740	It's like when you're sitting out on a on a hot porch and you're listening to the summer rain
936740	939420	And you get that nice rain smell and you just
940300	942300	And you just snored it
942340	945900	Yeah, you you snort the rain you snort the rain smell
946900	955420	Absolutely. Oh my god. All right. I have my little mini me next to me and now she talks when she's supposed to
956980	958980	Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
959380	961380	I'm almost done
961620	963620	Take your time
963620	965620	I'm just staring at this ugly wooden ball
967020	969260	He is the world
969380	971380	I
973940	975940	Hate him
976220	981220	Just he's so ugly. Why did they make him made out of wood? They had they had metal
981380	986780	Why is his top made out of wood? I don't know. I feel like they could have also put that part on the bottom
988260	990260	They could have
991380	997860	Actually when they did it for a wool tour but looks even crazier, so he looks better than wool tour at least
1000260	1005220	Splinters very true. I'd like to talk with Muppet she be after stream about what?
1006980	1008980	About what?
1010340	1014420	You have with this Muppet. Yeah, what business do you have with this Muppet?
1019340	1024020	You want to throw it at a wall that hurts that hurts me deeply
1024020	1030460	I mean, there is that trend where people like buy Fumos, right and they just beat them and then they yeah
1030700	1032980	Kind of soak them in milk and throw them at a wall
1033620	1040540	Of course, I don't think your demographic wants to soak them in milk. Yeah, probably not milk, but something probably
1041420	1043420	Similar to that
1045420	1049620	Wait, why did they why did they put Fumos and milk? I
1051540	1052580	Don't
1052620	1061020	What's the you know, I I couldn't tell you why anybody does anything except you know for the laughs
1063580	1066500	Yeah, just for the laughs for some twisted laughs
1067100	1070500	Just for just for a little hee-hee hoo-hoo ha ha, you know
1071740	1077500	It's a little tee-hee's a little tee-hee hee-hee's. I'm speaking of which I need a tweet hee-hee hee-hee hee's
1078180	1080180	Hee-hee hee-hee
1083300	1085300	Hee-hee hee-hee hee-hee hee-hee
1085700	1087700	I love the out-of-pocket
1088540	1089740	thumbnail
1089740	1091740	My manager made for me. I
1092500	1096100	Also like it. It's very different. I wasn't even gonna bother covering it up
1096100	1100180	And then it's been up for a while and hasn't gotten demonetized. So it's fun
1100180	1106180	Well, that's because ass and boobs is different you can have ass because no boobs butts are funny
1106180	1109620	No, yeah, because I just have a front butt on my chest
1110140	1116020	Yeah, you do but there's also like the risk of having like that female presenting nipple. I
1117860	1122660	Couldn't have a female presenting nipple on my butt. She maybe
1127660	1135900	Like a raised mole like a pimple like a butt pimple. Oh gross. No, but no butt pimples here. Please. No, thank you
1137460	1139460	All right
1139620	1141420	Tweeted I
1141420	1143420	Forgot to tag you
1143580	1145580	That's okay. I'll retweet it. I'll find it
1147660	1149660	I am a mess
1150140	1156620	That's okay. You're running on what an hour of sleep essentially not even more like ten minutes
1158140	1165540	That's a power nap. That's like the ten minute power hour, but you know a little bit shorter than a ten minute power hour now
1166540	1169020	RIP original game grumps. I know right
1175420	1177420	Not the pimples
1178020	1183180	Amy would love that. Yeah, cuz well though. Yeah, we like to pop zits, but I don't want one on my butt
1183180	1188700	Oh, yeah, no, that's awful, but it's a popping videos are very nice
1188700	1190660	I love watching pimple popping videos
1190660	1195980	It's just like I could sit there for hours and just get sucked into a rabbit hole of just pimple popping videos
1196580	1197820	right
1197820	1199820	Yeah, do you ever just like enjoy?
1200820	1203820	Looking at it like the ear wax removal ones as well
1203820	1208380	I I watched it ear wax removal one the other way, but for some odd reason that
1209020	1216460	Actually grosses me out a little bit, but like but which is weird cuz like I like to watch like the really like big
1216460	1218460	cyst pops like the like
1219300	1224380	Dr. Pimple Popper. Yeah, like the really gross one. So I don't know why ear wax just like
1225220	1231900	Doesn't do it for me, but I watched your brain. Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe cuz it's yeah, it's not something
1231900	1234700	It's not like being extract. Well, it is being extracted. It's not being like
1235380	1238140	Pushed I don't know how to explain it. It's the act
1238820	1243340	It's the act of unless it's um, I did watch one in this person
1243340	1246700	Just like twirled a little tool in their ear and just like yoinked it out and I was like whoa
1247700	1250740	That's really cool. I wish I could get my ears professionally cleaned
1251820	1254300	You can if you get like one of those
1255020	1260520	Watery things like a water pig you could just point it at your ear and you can irrigate your ear. Oh
1261580	1266660	Soffeting drops boom. I feel like I would just give myself an ear infection just
1267620	1273800	Somehow cuz I'm sometimes prone to those I would definitely just like end up giving myself an ear infection
1274600	1279920	Honestly, I always get ear infections and I always get like sore throats at the beginning of the year
1279920	1283360	No, honestly every new years. I'm like, this is the year
1283360	1288320	I'm gonna ask the ask the dentist to take my tonsils out. Oh, I've asked them
1288320	1293240	They said told me no cuz I have like enlarged tonsils. They're like, you know bigger tonsils than normal
1293240	1295560	I'm like great yoink them out. I'm tired of them
1296080	1300040	Cuz they're just like I don't know. I don't like open my mouth and I'm just like
1301000	1307080	Not that they're noticeable, but like whatever I poke around in my mouth a lot. It sounds weird. I don't know
1314520	1317380	You ever you ever get one of those like tonsil stones
1318160	1320160	Yes, I hate them. That's yeah
1320480	1325620	You're always like you're always just trying to draw it up and then like it feels like you're gagging. Yeah
1326500	1332140	It's so gross, it's I hate them they smell like death smells like a dead grandma
1332940	1337140	And no matter how much you brush your teeth your breath never gets any better when you have one
1337220	1339980	Yeah, that's why sometimes I'll just check make sure
1340540	1344500	Because my my tonsils are bigger sometimes I'll like get one and I'm like, ah
1344980	1349100	No, that's why I'm just like just let me let me just like laser them off
1349500	1352340	So I don't ever have to get tonsil stones ever again. Oh
1356620	1358620	I forgot I was gonna say
1360780	1362780	Doesn't matter
1370820	1372820	I'm EP second
1373540	1375540	So I'm just like what do I talk about next
1377340	1379940	The infinity tonsil stones gross. Oh
1380660	1381780	Oh
1381780	1386340	That's like. Oh god, it's tonsil stones all the way down like
1388140	1394820	But it could be worse it could be worse it could be kidney stones. That's true kidney stones are horrible. I've heard I
1395460	1399940	Have never had one. They're probably all resting inside me like hidden diamonds
1401460	1406020	No, then you would be be peeing just pure fire
1407020	1409020	Constantly
1409100	1414940	But like also I feel like you could make jewelry if you were just an infinite kidney stone source
1416660	1420580	It's more like from what I've heard it's more of like a sandy
1421500	1424220	Granule rather than like a stone stone
1424980	1429020	Yeah, but what if you like sand it and smooth it like you get like just like a little roller
1429780	1431780	Yeah, yeah
1431900	1435700	Make a little kidney stone ring and then be like I want you to have this
1436820	1443700	My piss buddy, my buddy and it's like this is a part of me that I'm giving to you. We are pistars and arms
1450540	1452540	Yep, yep
1453060	1458220	Truly truly that's how that's how we roll in this household. Hmm. I
1458820	1463860	Had tonsils taking out cuz constant ear infections. Oh, that's the word. That's the worst
1463900	1466780	That's why I wanted to get the cuz I also um, I
1467460	1470460	Have because of inflammation in my neck for my arthritis
1470460	1476380	I'm one of my eustachian tubes are always kind of like sort of blocked and I was hoping if I got my tonsil removed
1476820	1480220	It would like help with that because I'm just like I feel it
1480220	1482480	I'm sometimes like deaf in my right ear because I'm like what?
1483220	1484820	Why I
1484820	1490060	Can't hear what you're saying. It's like the weirdest feeling having your ear blocked
1492060	1500380	Hi Rena, all right, I hope my art program unfreezes itself soon so I can finish saving this magnificent muppet that I've drawn
1501860	1503860	It is quite gorgeous. You guys are not ready
1505300	1511060	Let me go back in to share my no not share my screen. Oh wait you ended it. Oh
1511780	1515780	I'm sorry. I guess. No, you're fine. You're fine. Okay
1518260	1520260	I wanted to look at where you were at
1520900	1525940	Oh, I finished it. You think trinket could be turned up a little bit more. I can do that for you. Whoo
1533780	1537540	Someone thrown her that horn thing that people used to hear better
1538500	1545060	It happens because I'm 56. That's correct. Did you know that wax candles don't work?
1546700	1548700	Like what do you mean?
1548700	1554740	Like there's like this old wives tale where if you put like some foil and a candle in your ear. Oh
1555500	1557500	Yeah, ear candling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
1557940	1559940	It doesn't do anything
1560500	1562180	Have you tried it?
1562180	1565100	No, I did research on it. I
1565580	1571500	Swear I've done it before when I was a kid and it worked. I don't know. I kind of just been tripping as a child
1572460	1575020	I mean, I'm totally delusional as children. Yeah
1576060	1579340	Maybe but like I feel like I feel like
1580380	1582060	Maybe
1582060	1584460	Yes, I forget there is the science behind it
1586700	1592300	It's the science behind it and there's it's a big scam. It's the paper cone works not wax

1699500	1701500	Farewell
1704060	1706060	I may make you a little bit
1708060	1712940	But I think I'm smaller than you you are so I'm gonna I thought as much
1714140	1717500	I'm just a little just a little we look so great
1719420	1721420	Just a bunch of muppets
1723180	1729660	In your little hands, where's your wait, where's your other hand? It's it's it's resting. I'm tired
1730620	1732620	It's resting
1732940	1734060	Ah
1734060	1738780	My hand's not up. I'm polite. I have my hands in a polite position because I'm a guest here
1740220	1743020	Because it looks like you have two hands up your butt
1744060	1746060	I might
1751420	1756220	This is this is muppet time with uh trinket and sheafy
1756220	1764380	We're gonna we're gonna smash and pass some balls. Yeah, okay. We already I think we already passed on this one, didn't we?
1764940	1767580	Yeah, we passed on we passed on these wooden balls. Yeah
1768460	1772460	The splinters aren't worth it. No, no, thank you. I'm good with that
1772940	1775660	Never saw this episode of the muppets while you're about to
1777180	1779180	Be the best episode you've ever seen
1779900	1781900	Uh execute these are eggs
1783340	1785340	How to eat them um
1786380	1788940	I could I could see them being useful though
1789660	1795980	You know like you could be into obvi position. I was thinking that I'm not into that but I get it
1797180	1802140	Because like I've I've read I've read some I've read some mangoes in my in my history
1803020	1803980	and
1803980	1805980	you know
1806060	1808060	Sometimes sometimes
1808300	1812780	Sometimes you're just introduced a little too early to some things and they're just with you for life
1812940	1815980	That's very accurate. I agree with that statement
1817500	1822220	So like honestly, it's a it's a smash and eat for these. It's a smash and eat
1822540	1824860	I it's it's just a pass and eat for me
1825580	1830540	Do you think do you think the body has the ability to boil eggs if you like put them in there though?
1837580	1841500	I don't know let's try with the chicken egg and I'll get back to you
1843740	1845740	It's okay
1845980	1848140	Oh my goodness body well actually
1848940	1851340	No, because what's the body the body's?
1852220	1854220	basal temperature
1854220	1856380	Is like 97. I I bet
1857100	1859100	How how much the boiling?
1859500	1866140	Rate for water isn't like 110 or something Fahrenheit. So what you're telling me is we need to find a sick person
1866380	1868380	Have them put the eggs up there
1868700	1871820	And then have the lady eggs and then you could have like
1872460	1876540	A sentry style boiled egg from another woman. That's perfect
1877260	1882460	So 100 degrees Celsius. Yeah, so yeah, it's essentially what we do for like 10 to 12 minutes do that
1883260	1885740	Yeah, this is an experiment that I think should actually happen
1886700	1888700	It would be like a tea egg
1889020	1891020	Yeah, like a little quail egg
1891980	1893580	Tuck it up your butthole
1893580	1897420	If any of you guys get sick with the fever, I need you to do this. Uh, this is uh
1898460	1901260	This is a question. This is a request for you
1902620	1905580	It takes 300 700 slaps to cook a whole chicken
1906620	1908060	What?
1908060	1911100	I I mean, I guess if you just keep slapping it
1911820	1915340	I feel like that would have to be 700 slaps at all at once. Wouldn't it?
1916220	1920940	No, no, no like seven like it the heat would build up probably maybe
1922140	1925740	If I if I slap my ass 700 times
1926860	1928860	You're that
1932780	1938860	Can't be helped you're cooked at that point. I'm cooked. Yeah, I'm cooked so cooked. All right executor
1941020	1945420	He could be cuter. He could be cuter eggs that could be cuter, you know
1946940	1948940	But I like his dopey face
1950220	1954060	He's got three of them. I mean I give him a smooch, but I move on
1955020	1956060	Yeah
1956060	1960300	Really? I definitely kiss like one of the faces. Yeah, maybe not one in the back
1960460	1962460	He looks like a kisser
1963500	1968700	I gave him a little smooch and I feel like he would get like bashful like uh like bashful from um
1969660	1971180	the
1971180	1974620	I almost said the wizard of Oz uh snow white
1977180	1981820	Okay, but the apple-throwing trees in the wizard of Oz might might hit for some people, you know
1983260	1987500	They definitely might definitely hit people. That's that's that's totally true
1988140	1990780	Oh my gosh, I haven't seen the wizard of Oz in such a long time
1991580	1994060	Uh, what about the tall boy version?
1994780	1996540	Oh, that's a smash
1996540	1998140	Why?
1998140	1999820	I mean
1999820	2001820	He's like six one
2002780	2004780	I almost spit out my tea
2006700	2011900	How tall is the executor elolan version he's seven feet tall he's seven throat goat
2012780	2014780	Five was a dude then yes
2015740	2018860	I mean are you a tree hugger trinket?
2019660	2025500	I mean tree humper in nature in my nature. That's a good point. It's in my nature. That's a good point
2029260	2031260	I'm gonna pass
2031260	2032860	I'm gonna smash
2032860	2034060	um
2034060	2039100	Cubone I would just want to take care of this little cute baby. That's it. I mean he is an orphan
2039980	2041980	Yeah, I'd be a good mom
2042940	2047020	You would I think I I I'd you know treat him right
2048300	2052780	Make sure he's not too traumatized by his mother's death and make him work stop wearing his mom's skull
2054220	2057820	I you can just keep it, but like I don't want to wear it. That's that's not really good
2058620	2060620	you know
2060620	2063260	That's not a good healthy. No, it's not healthy
2063740	2065180	But you know
2065180	2067820	I have this theory about cubone. Uh-huh
2068540	2072620	I think cubones like once they get over the loss of their mother become kengis kongs
2073260	2074860	Oh, yeah
2074860	2076380	I feel like
2076380	2079500	In a distant dream. We've had this conversation before
2080700	2085500	Or maybe I with a with a particular cat. I'm not sure
2086140	2088140	um
2088700	2091820	All right, so what would you do? I kind of want to eat it at the same time
2092380	2095260	Is it messed up that I kind of want to cook it in its mom's skulls a little bowl?
2095260	2099820	I mean we do the same thing with bread bowls. Exactly
2100620	2104700	So like I don't see anything wrong with it. All right. Okay. I feel a little bit better about that now
2105340	2109500	It's kind of like the same sort of principle. Do you feel bad when you have scrambled eggs and chicken?
2109980	2111980	Oh, that's a good point
2113740	2115740	I can't believe eggs are just chicken periods
2117020	2119020	I think about that often
2119180	2124060	It's kind of messed up sometimes you can get lucky with a double yoker. That's true
2125020	2127020	That chicken would have had twins
2129580	2132940	Imagine if women's eggs were that big when we had our periods
2133820	2139660	God that would fucking suck. I would hate my life even more than I already do getting a period. Oh my god
2140380	2145980	But what if it came out so easily like an egg like once a month like bomb actually that would be nice
2146540	2150060	Because if it was if I just had to lay an egg once a month and that was all I had to do
2150140	2154460	Instead of being pained for eight days and just bleed heavily then um
2155180	2157180	Yeah, I'd rather lay an egg
2157500	2159500	And then you can eat it, right?
2160060	2166220	Yeah, absolutely like almost like when pregnant women eat the prosenta. It's probably has like nutritional properties just like normal eggs
2166940	2169660	Honestly, it would probably open up a new market
2170380	2176700	And like there would be so less like human hunger like just get yourself a woman to lay you an egg. Yeah
2177500	2180220	I feel and then yeah, the whole like egg industry
2180860	2184780	Would be a very different place guys. I think we should make this happen
2185820	2188060	Honestly, how do we get women to start laying eggs?
2189340	2191340	Honestly new work class
2193980	2196860	But then again like do they well
2198700	2201660	Does the egg stay inside when when it's fertilized?
2203180	2205180	Oh, that's a good point
2206140	2214380	Hmm, huh. Hmm. You have to workshop that. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna pass. Uh, Marowak
2221500	2224940	I'm good. I'm good. It's a pass for me. Okay
2227580	2232060	This one's kind of cool looking but it's just repainted and made skinny
2233020	2237260	Basically, it's slim though. Yeah, I'm Marowak but cooler
2238540	2240540	Burn the work mom
2240860	2243260	Yeah, yeah, he's like a little like scene kid
2245020	2247820	Going through her golf girl phase before she becomes a mom
2250780	2252780	Hitman Lee
2253420	2256540	Man's got legs and arms no mouth though. Yeah
2257260	2259740	What no mouth don't do it's kind of disappointing
2260460	2263980	I mean you could still sit on the face. It'd just be more like a mutual rub
2265340	2268300	You could use the you could use the legs as a grinder
2269260	2271900	You could and maybe the face as a grinder
2272940	2277260	He's also got fingers. That's a good point. I don't know. I just don't feel
2277980	2280220	I'm not feeling anything with this, you know
2281100	2284140	Yeah, there's there's not enough defining features. Yeah
2285020	2289500	He's kind of like and he's kind of like a faceless man from a hentai. Yeah
2289980	2291980	I
2292300	2294620	Like he just needs like protagonist hair
2295340	2297980	Could be like the self-insert and then you're golden
2298620	2300220	For what he is
2300220	2305660	But then I would if he looked more like the the faceless protagonist because the faceless protagonist
2306140	2310300	Always has a mouth and like long hair covering their eyes if it was reversed
2310780	2312780	I would I would then I would say yes
2313580	2315580	But this is not the case so
2316060	2321500	Pass he's a pass. Uh hitman chan. Hitman chance of smash. Yeah
2322380	2325980	Yeah, very cute. I like their outfit. She got a little skirt going
2328700	2332620	I bet I bet the I bet the third leg has a little boxing glove at the end
2338620	2340620	Bro I need a drink for this
2341340	2343340	Hahaha
2344940	2346940	I always thought hitman chan was a girl
2348460	2350620	Because it's just chan and she's wearing a dress
2351260	2355020	It could be a girl or a boy. Oh, okay. I don't know. I just always saw it like that
2355420	2358140	Uh, I'm just feel like I'd be kind of scared because I feel like they'll be very
2358540	2362780	Fisting and if you're saying there's a little glove at the end of that then I'm even more terrified
2363420	2366700	I mean, it's just it's just punching up at the inside door
2367580	2372700	Yeah, my inside door just got really scared and quivered in fear
2374140	2376140	They're 100 male. Okay, then I'm
2376380	2378620	Riona. Yeah for yeah a little riona
2379340	2382540	But I would rather like an actual fist than a glove for that
2383340	2384540	You know
2384540	2389180	I I would hate to think that like it has a little hand at the end of its third leg though
2389980	2391980	I'd hate to think that
2392460	2394460	passing
2395260	2402300	Yeah, they've always been cute to me. I'm a smash hitman champ. You're gonna have okay understandable. Um look at tongue
2403020	2404540	Oh, that
2404540	2409020	The conversation doesn't need to be I know it's it's a no-brainer to be honest with you
2409900	2411900	smash
2413420	2416300	The tongue king the gluck look five thousands
2417100	2423340	Throat goat throat goat, you know, probably no gag reflex because he swallows just about anything you give him precisely
2423420	2425420	A call him Kirby the way he swallows
2428060	2430060	Coughing
2432300	2434300	That's a pass
2434860	2436940	I like the pause we both had we're just like
2438780	2440780	Like if I were a guy
2441980	2444220	And I had like an air purifier
2445900	2447900	Maybe use the holes for something
2448220	2449340	Yeah
2449340	2450220	Yeah
2450380	2455660	Tuck a little honestly by default. No, that's a pass. Yeah, that's that's I feel like I would just die
2455820	2458060	Like I something would happen and then same with wheezing
2459100	2462620	I mean unless it's like that dank's uh coming out of there. No
2463340	2466940	Yeah, like I just feel like it just smells like farts or it's gonna kill me so
2467820	2468940	Yeah
2468940	2473340	Like if he wasn't like an abuser and you could burn that that that magic leaf in him probably
2473340	2475340	Yeah
2478060	2481980	Now this one just looks like a gentleman who's wanting to pay for a good time
2483500	2485500	Bring me your finest
2485740	2487580	courtesans
2487580	2491260	Like he you just see him on the street. He's got a little he's got his top hats
2491500	2496620	You give him a little cane and he's like, excuse me, madam. How much for you think I've got about
2497020	2499020	20 dimma dome dollars
2499980	2505660	I have about 20 pounds to pound your life away if you'll have me of course
2506380	2507740	um
2507740	2513180	I'll pass but I would I would I would entertain him for a bit, but then I wouldn't let him hit
2514060	2517820	Honestly, if he spoke to me like the high roller from sucker punch
2520460	2525660	Just like sucker punch sucker punch high roller have me like yeah, john ham
2526620	2528620	Cancel man john ham
2536540	2538540	Yeah, what about this rocky unicorn?
2540940	2543660	Uh, you know, I bet is very right horny
2546220	2549980	I mean, I mean, there's there's there's three different ways to mount it
2551420	2553420	Yeah, you have a lot of ridges
2553740	2555420	to ride
2555420	2558780	So like, you know, it's for it's for you and the besties
2559580	2561580	Yeah, that's definitely like a group
2562620	2564540	activity, um
2564540	2570220	But like what if you're alone and it tries to sit on you or like mount you I think I would just die
2571260	2576460	No, he's a he's a rock. He's a rock monster. No. Yeah, I'm gonna pass because like at some point
2576940	2579740	He's gonna ask why I'm not giving
2580620	2585180	And I want to be able to provide that's you know, what a good partner does, you know balance
2585580	2589980	Give and take I mean you'd have to knock him on his back and like strand him like a turtle
2590060	2593980	I feel like yeah, and I don't even think he could be on his back right like normally
2594220	2597340	You'd have to do like sideways because his little back horn
2597980	2602620	Yeah, he'd definitely freak out. Yeah, I feel like he would just not have a great time. We're just not compatible
2603180	2607660	No, no, he's too big. We're too squishy. We're muppets. We're muppets
2608540	2610540	Uh ride on
2610540	2616300	It's kind of more doable. Yeah. Hello. It's called ride on. Why would I not ride on on the ride on?
2617660	2620380	He's he's also got that physique like a dad bod
2620940	2622940	You know, I like me. I like me a dad bod
2623340	2627180	You know what he feels like he could be the male version of a kengis kong
2627820	2631180	I always thought that I always thought he was the male version of it because they look
2631900	2634380	Precisely the same minus the pouch in the color scheme
2635100	2641020	Right and there's like it's almost like uh the males are smaller because the kengis kongs are quite large
2641820	2645820	But then again, they're probably like in the same like egg class too. So
2647260	2650620	I'll smash. What about you? I'll smash it as well. Yeah
2651980	2655260	Chancey, I'm pretty sure that horn goes around and around and around

2677420	2683660	So like if you're in a sexy situation with a chancey that thing's going probably up one of the holes
2685740	2690940	And it like dissolves and it's like all glittery and then you just feel better and really happy because like
2691500	2694380	That's that's what she does. She hunts you down
2696380	2698380	And gives you your her egg
2699820	2701420	I think
2701420	2706220	I think I would sit I would eat her and I think I'll sit in the cockshare for that one
2707100	2709100	Okay, because I want to see how that works out

2840540	2843900	You're not the stepdad. You're the dad that stepped up. Yeah
2845740	2847740	That's such a good fucking line
2850620	2853100	Uh the mega version where the kid
2853980	2855820	is just out of the
2855820	2857260	pouch
2857260	2859740	You give that kid 20 to go to the movies

2875980	2879980	We're playing new games. Don't worry about it kiddo. Here's some here's some pizza money
2880460	2882460	Go to the arcade
2883260	2886940	And then you're you're just you're just in the bedroom you're playing smash on switch
2888140	2890780	We just didn't want the kid to interrupt
2892940	2894300	Uh
2894300	2896300	Horses for the male gaze
2896460	2899100	However, remember that one toy
2900700	2904300	This the sucker toy does this because can horsey also suck
2905180	2907980	Yeah, because I feel like it would be like one of those little
2910140	2917100	Like a little as long vibrator toy like a rose as long as it has like an any and any option and not
2917260	2920860	Like an outie only option with just the bubbles
2922700	2925740	Because like the last thing you want to do it is blow in
2927340	2929340	Yeah
2929500	2933180	Like I wouldn't I would just it would primarily be used for down there
2934140	2935180	Yeah
2935180	2938780	Or nipples or yeah or nipple. Yeah a little bit of
2939980	2941980	Muppet nipple
2943500	2945500	Felt up if you know what I mean
2946220	2952620	Oh, I get it because of the material. Yeah, you got it. I got it. I'm so smart
2954540	2956540	Um, so I will say
2956540	2958540	smash for horsey
2958700	2961980	I'm I'm also gonna have to go with smash for this one. Okay
2962620	2964620	But again, if I was a man, then I would
2965180	2970300	This would be a no brainer. That's a hole every hole's a goal if I was every hole's the goal
2970780	2972780	Even even coffings
2973500	2975500	Um
2976780	2981580	For cedra though, I feel like it wouldn't be as good
2982780	2984780	Because so many harsh edges
2985580	2989020	Too sharp. Yeah, I don't feel like I would be able to get a good grip
2990380	2991980	Well, you could definitely get a good grip
2991980	2996460	But I feel like once you were done and like you were in bed not cuttable. Yeah
2997500	2999500	You roll over that thing you're impaled
2999740	3000860	Yeah
3000860	3006620	And not like in the good way obviously sliced up on like sandpaper like scales or something
3008300	3010620	Yeah, too aggressive. I'm gonna say pass
3011340	3013340	Pass sorry cedra
3013580	3014860	Goldeen
3014860	3019260	That's a no brainer right there. That's for everybody. That's for everybody
3019900	3021900	It's got two e's for everyone
3022060	3024060	I
3025500	3029980	Ready to eat you for everyone. I mean so good they put it in twice
3032540	3035500	All right, we are fucking the goldfish smash
3037020	3040380	How see king I don't like the teeth. No, no pass
3041980	3049660	Pass down. It's a downgrade. Yeah, be careful. Be careful who you call cute in high school. They might just never glow down
3050060	3052060	I
3052300	3054300	star
3056460	3058300	I mean
3058300	3060300	I'm robbing it. Yeah
3061420	3063820	I would definitely rob this thing. Um
3065740	3067740	I'm like wondering if
3070940	3073740	You could like put little things on each of its little hands
3075820	3077820	They use it as like a multi-use toy
3078140	3080640	You definitely could
3082620	3084620	Yeah, but like it would just be
3085820	3087820	But then again, it's a fucking starfish
3088780	3096060	Like at that point you might as well just get yourself something fake and not a living creature. Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm thinking like
3098140	3100140	It's a pass. Yeah, I'm gonna pass

3224860	3228700	Not the internet for running off a very wholesome woman. I know
3229340	3234620	She was my comfort comfort youtuber and watch. I know I love nasty boy kermit
3236700	3239660	Oh, and I want to go back and like watch some of her old videos after this
3240380	3241980	I'll save
3241980	3243980	All right, mr. Mime
3244700	3249180	Okay, so I have very complex emotions about mr. Mime. Please elaborate
3249980	3256140	Okay, so there's a comic that's on tumblr where they talk about the logistics of eating mr. Mime
3256540	3258540	And that has been with me for years
3258780	3262780	Look, why do I feel like I've heard this before? Oh, yeah, ash's dad is the
3263660	3264860	also the
3264860	3267100	Also ash's dad. Yeah, I mean
3267580	3273740	I don't mind sharing with ash's mom because she's she herself seems like a bit of a freak who would share mr. Mime
3273980	3275740	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
3275740	3277740	And also he is a definite smash
3279580	3281580	Um, I'm good
3282060	3285180	I feel like I feel like his fingers would be like sticky
3285900	3290700	I just think of mr. Mime from the live action pokemon movie and he was terrifying
3291580	3295100	I don't I don't I'm not I'm not envisioning real life pokemon
3295100	3300780	I'm envisioning cute 2d once because we're too. I know 2d muppet girls. I'm just I'm just
3301740	3306140	I'm just uh traumatized from live action mr. Mime
3307660	3315420	And also uh like clefable or clefairy, whichever one it was. No, it was jigglypuff. Those things were freaking terrifying for that movie
3315980	3321660	Everything in that movie was freaking terrifying. It really was uh clowns sometimes scare me as well. So
3322620	3323660	Aw
3323660	3325660	Not even actually it's like they
3326540	3329100	They're unnerving. I just think of john wane gasey
3330060	3331900	Oh
3331900	3334700	I feel like I feel like mr. Mime would gasey some
3336380	3338460	Some in uh innocence. So
3341020	3342380	Man
3342380	3347020	I'm not I'm not that caught up on my true crime. I wish I knew more about I never
3347660	3349660	Please don't
3349900	3351500	It's bad
3351500	3354140	Fair enough. Um, I'm gonna pass
3355020	3359900	Like what's your opinion on people who actually have it for the new it clown and not the old it clown
3360460	3362460	That's so funny to me because like I
3363500	3365740	I've seen it like I like understand it
3366300	3368940	Again, sometimes when I'm really scared of something
3369660	3374780	I'll sexualize it. So I'm just like I'm gonna trick myself into being horny for it
3375180	3379420	And so I did do that with pennywise at some point and so now I'm not scared of pennywise
3380380	3387500	That's fair, but I mean, how could you not look at that clown and think damn that head that head is totally okoteer
3389260	3391580	I could sell ad space on that clown's head
3392620	3394620	Make a million dollars
3395740	3397740	I'm just terrifying
3397820	3403420	Innocent children. They're just like, what's this weird ad placement on this head? Now. I want to buy a box of pop-tarts crazy
3404060	3409020	Um, yeah, joes. Where where's the address? Oh, there it is. It's right underneath the advertisement
3409820	3411820	Oh
3413340	3415340	Seven head um
3416540	3420860	Okay, what about the the galar version? I'm robbing it
3421660	3427100	I mean, he looks so fashionable. Look at that drip. He's iced out
3428380	3430380	He's got his yee yees on
3431260	3433260	He's on
3437420	3439740	I'm gonna pass. I kind of he's just so he's just cute
3441100	3445420	Yeah, I like his little shoes. I just want to rob him and just be like go on your way
3446540	3448780	Like you're gonna steal his shoes. Yeah
3449820	3455740	I I feel like I'm obligated to smash if you're just gonna take his shoes. I'm gonna take his shoes in the jam on his chest
3456700	3460700	All right, then it'll it'll be a smash and grab. You smash. Yeah, smash and grab
3461340	3465260	By the way, we do a smash pass eat and rob
3466460	3469740	By the way for ours, uh smash passes for these pokemon
3469740	3472620	So sometimes people decide to eat these like because I would definitely eat him too
3473580	3475580	He looks like he would taste like ice cream
3476060	3480860	He looks really sweet like a blueberry taste good like blue raspberry icy
3482380	3484380	Very I'm also eating him now
3485740	3488460	That's fair. My cat's food is going off
3490780	3492780	That's okay. Sorry
3493500	3495500	Well, they gotta eat they do
3496460	3500540	I just have to announce it every time so people don't think there's like gunfire in the background
3503420	3506540	But fireworks are still existent. That's true
3508940	3510940	Oh, yeah, the fireworks will be on
3511260	3513980	The 13th for me. So I can't wait to be fighting
3514860	3516860	In the trenches when that happens
3517180	3518700	Oh my god
3518700	3520700	My heart goes out to you
3521580	3524060	My cats do not have a good time. Um
3525100	3527100	cypher
3527500	3529020	Okay, but
3529020	3531980	He he kind of he kind of hot. I was gonna say smash
3532780	3534700	Yeah, a little bit of knife play
3535500	3540860	Yeah, put hold hold those little danger hands up to your throat and go at it
3541100	3543100	Yeah
3544620	3546620	If precisely smash
3547180	3549180	Everyone's everyone's just like, yeah
3549660	3552220	There's some loud eaters. Can you hear them eating?
3554380	3556700	I mean kind of jealous. I don't think so
3558300	3560300	They do much very loudly my cats
3560300	3562300	Uh jigs
3562780	3564780	Uh smash
3566380	3568700	Jeans herself is a queen so I don't
3569660	3574140	I'll yeah, I don't know she has them perfect if I was a dude
3575180	3577180	She is perfect blowjob lips
3577900	3582300	Not only that she's got canonical titties. Yeah, she literally
3583740	3585740	I wonder what she looks like
3587500	3591580	Like what's her body type under that like what are her legs look like I wonder
3592780	3594780	Probably cute, right
3594860	3598380	Like like maybe like she's a little chubby chubby guy
3598780	3600780	Little chubby lady. Maybe
3601500	3608220	And and like not only that like her wig is on point. She is she it's it's there snatch
3609260	3611260	The lace is laid. Yeah
3616940	3619900	Yeah, the original this was just a lovely little uh
3623180	3625180	African uh
3628700	3635980	No, you're right, but like mr. Popo was like the same way so we can't really be mad at it because we like dragon balls
3635980	3636460	E
3636460	3639820	Yeah, mr. Popo never changed nothing
3641580	3645820	I ain't made mr. Popo purple. Yeah, Mr. Popo stayed black
3649020	3651020	He was black
3652060	3656780	I'm not gonna lie. I do love mr. Popo and dragon balls either you bridged. Oh, yeah
3657500	3660940	I have to watch it again. I don't remember what the
3661580	3667900	This uh voices were because I remember cracking up. I used to watch that in young justice abridged. Oh my god
3668860	3675740	Oh, I might recommend watching a sword art online the abridged as well. Oh my god. I'm so watching
3676780	3682460	Says it made me actually like sword art online because I did not like sword. I don't like sword art online
3683180	3685820	And this will make you like it. Okay, perfect
3686460	3690300	Wasn't jinx based on a japanese mountain yokai with black skin and large lips?
3690460	3695020	Yes, probably a hundred percent because all the pokemon are based off of like yokai
3695820	3697180	and
3697180	3701020	animals and animals and just like japanese demons and stuff
3701900	3705340	And uh mystical creatures so a hundred percent. That's definitely it
3706300	3708300	But it just it just looks funny
3708300	3710300	Hahaha
3711660	3713660	Electabuzz
3716380	3721980	Do you think he could do that? I think he can I think he can localize his his electrical flow
3723660	3725660	I just don't like his face
3726300	3730060	You know what I've always wondered is he like a tiger? I don't know
3732300	3735820	I generally don't know because I can't like he has like fuzzy arms
3736700	3741260	But the rest of him isn't fuzzy and I don't think he's a bee. No
3743580	3745580	Yeah, but he's like
3745660	3747820	he's like a
3747820	3750060	Bee dinosaur tiger
3752620	3755260	I'm I'm still a smash though. Yeah
3756380	3759420	Because he's got handlebars on his head. He does
3759980	3767100	Maybe he's got really soft-looking arms like really powerful arms as long as his teeth
3767500	3773260	Don't nip at me and actually no, you know, never mind. I don't mind a little bit, but you know, I just said for
3774460	3776300	Scyther
3776300	3778300	So I I'm not I'm not scared
3778940	3781100	Um, so yeah, I guess I'll smash
3781820	3784300	Yeah, definitely a definite smash there. Yeah
3785420	3787420	He's a mix of an oni and a tiger. Oh
3787820	3793500	Oh, okay. See that makes sense. That makes sense to me. I get it now. Uh booty cheek head
3795180	3797180	Pass pass
3798300	3800940	He's just always gonna have that stupid look on his face
3801740	3803740	pincer
3805500	3812460	That's a pass for me. Yeah, I'm I always think of fucking earwigs when I look at a pincer and I hate those bugs
3813500	3816540	Now if you had said like hair across we are not there yet
3817580	3819580	But we're
3821180	3823580	Pincer mega no same thing. No, no
3825260	3831500	Magmar is good for hot talking. I'm not a dude. So again, I have a penis envy for some of these pokemon
3832140	3834140	Yeah, so I can't use them in the same way
3836380	3838380	Uh toros
3838620	3840620	um
3841180	3843180	This one's hard. I'd probably die
3844060	3845900	Because that's just a bull
3845980	3849900	It is but if I'm a pup I'm a muppet then I could probably take it
3852220	3857340	Yeah, definitely because like that's how they that's how they breed the cows. Yeah
3860140	3865420	You know what I'm gonna say smash, you know, I'll I will too. I'm curious. Yeah
3865420	3867420	Yeah
3872860	3875500	Take the bull by the horns you got it
3876860	3884220	Agmar is good for hiding stuff. There's a scene where magmaru hands you a nice toasty pokeball he retrieved from somewhere warm
3886780	3889100	Oh god, he folded out his ass. Uh magic heart
3893180	3894780	Smash
3894860	3896300	Magic heart
3896300	3898300	Yeah, why?
3898620	3903740	Okay, so like it's gonna sound really weird, right? Okay, but
3904780	3910940	First of all, he's really hard and rigid and you can't eat him because they've already confirmed that in the anime
3911260	3916140	But like he does the only thing he does is splash which means he's gonna be moving
3917260	3923580	And like his mouth is the perfect size to like latch on to you like one of those said toys. Okay
3924540	3926540	I feel like with the splash though
3927260	3929260	It'd be just too much wetness
3930300	3932300	Like it would be uncomfortable
3933020	3937580	Nah, it'd be fine. It'd be fine. Definitely would have to lay a tarp down
3938460	3943500	Well, yeah, but like none of these are gonna be clean. It's pokemon. That's a good point
3944780	3950620	I'm gonna pass because I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face having that thing latched on to my
3951580	3958540	Muppet that's part of the experience. You gotta you gotta bully the fish. So he gets the anger so he can become the next one
3961660	3964940	Because we all know that the next one is what we all want
3972220	3974220	I'm terrified. No, I'm not
3975500	3977260	I can't
3977260	3979100	You really?
3979180	3981020	I don't know
3981020	3984220	I mean, it might be too big. I don't think I could handle it
3985100	3990540	You could take it. You could take it. You can definitely take it. I'll try. I'll take it. I'll smash
3991420	3996380	Yeah, it garrados is like a smash and even then you don't even have to be on the underside
3996380	4000780	You could be on top because like he doesn't need anything. Yeah
4002300	4009020	I'm sure it's like the same logic of salmon spawning where like you like your eggs and he comes and he fertilizes
4009260	4015740	And you just go on about your business. But this time you're just on the back riding. That's a good point. Okay
4016940	4019420	This one's too much though. That one's a lot too much
4020940	4024220	It's very goofy. It looks like they just smack the head onto like a smaller fish
4025340	4027340	Every time I see this one
4027500	4032460	It's a pass uh lapras smash smash. Look at that fucking face
4033180	4035020	She's so pretty
4035020	4036300	So pretty
4036300	4038540	The little seductive gays. Are you kidding me?
4039260	4043820	Easy smash and she she just looks caring. I'll put on a strap for her
4044700	4046860	Well, she looks at me while I hit it from behind
4047660	4050220	I'd be under the water for her. I'd take it. Yeah
4051180	4052700	Yeah, yeah
4052700	4054220	smash
4054220	4056220	Yeah
4058220	4062300	Giganta max I thought there was a cruise ship on her back for a second. Um
4063260	4068060	That's just a giant version. Yeah, you'll risk it for the biscuit. I can't it's too big
4069100	4071340	I'll be crushed. My muppet body would be
4073260	4074540	Destroyed
4074540	4077820	You know, I I have I have no qualms
4078940	4085180	Against uh, this this lovely lady letting me be under her flippers. Okay. All right
4087100	4089100	Moving forward ditto
4089260	4092300	Smash smash. Obviously ditto is always an obvious smash
4092940	4099020	Yeah, obviously like ditto can be your wildest dreams or your blandest. Yeah, exactly
4099660	4104700	Depending on how safe you want to be. Yeah, you can go really vanilla. You can get really dark with it
4105500	4107260	Ditto's there for you
4107260	4110060	Yeah, you know, you know, just ditto man ditto
4110620	4112620	God, now I'm thinking about the pokemon
4113580	4118860	Movie like the detective pikachu one. We just find out like the guys that have been like with the guy
4120060	4122060	We're just dittos. Yeah
4122060	4124060	I
4127980	4129980	Evie
4134860	4141100	I'm gonna say pass for evie. Yeah, it's a it's a baby. You gotta get to the evolutions. Yeah
4142700	4145580	That one's like a fluffy one. It's very cute
4146700	4149580	Big boy. I want to pet its fluff, but I wouldn't
4150540	4152540	I wouldn't do that
4152540	4154540	It looks mischievous too
4154860	4156860	Like he knows he knows what he's doing
4159340	4164540	Uh, vaporeon is an obvious smash for me because we all know vaporeon is the most breedable pokemon of all the uh
4165260	4170940	All the evolutions so of course the most compatible with the human physiology both man and woman. Yeah
4171820	4173820	So that's a smash
4174780	4176780	I
4176860	4178860	Uh jolteon
4178860	4182540	Honestly, I've never been that fan much of a fan of jolteon
4183740	4189660	I like jolteon, but not like that. I always thought jolteon was like I I remember I have to have a jolteon on my team
4190300	4192460	When I would play but not not like that
4193420	4198380	I would chew on a jolteon toy growing up because it was made out of that good rubber. Ooh
4199260	4201260	That good rubber that good good
4202220	4205260	But but it's but it's a pass. Yeah, I'll pass
4206220	4207660	flaryon
4207660	4209660	pet smash smash. Yeah
4210380	4211740	smash
4211740	4213740	I'm passing on flaryon
4214300	4219100	That's fine, but like he's so fluffy. He's fluffy. I just pet him
4220380	4223340	That was a little fluffy boy. It's one of touches little little feets
4224140	4227900	I feel that but like I I see a personal bed warmer
4228860	4232060	It's never cold. That's very true, but what if you get too hot?
4233100	4235100	I can always take the blankets off. Okay
4237020	4239020	Can we even feel heat as puppets?
4240220	4241660	Yeah
4241660	4243660	When we get too hot we're on fire
4247740	4250380	I look over and look at the poory gone just like here
4251100	4253100	right after the evolutions
4254380	4256380	That always cracks me up
4256620	4260220	So not this poory gone, but definitely the poory gone too
4261260	4263260	Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna pass on this one
4263820	4265820	uh
4265820	4267580	Omenite
4267580	4274140	That's a smash. It's a smash. I've always thought omenite was really cute. It looks like a little mustachioed man
4275100	4277820	Right. He's so cute. He's so cute
4278860	4281260	I love him. I would probably eat him as well
4281260	4283260	Oh
4283500	4290380	I remember lord helix. So like were you familiar with twitch plays pokemon like four million years ago?
4291260	4292140	No
4292140	4296220	Explain, so what what it was is on twitch. There was a stream
4296700	4302220	Where twitch chat was playing pokemon one line at a time basically one chat line at a time
4302700	4304700	Oh my god
4304700	4307420	They beat the game and like one of them was
4308220	4310620	A helix because they had the helix fossil
4311740	4315900	It was it was absolutely amazing. That is pretty sick
4319100	4321100	Uh almost star
4321980	4325580	No, I don't like the I'm I like tentacles, but I don't like the beak
4326700	4333020	I don't like the beak. I don't like the shell the eyes freak me out. Yeah, and I'm I'm okay with that
4333580	4335580	I'm I'm that's a no. Thank you
4338620	4340620	Uh
4340940	4342540	Kabuto
4342540	4346860	I've never liked him neither have I I also just think of kabuto from naruto. So
4348380	4350540	There was a guy in naruto named kabuto
4351740	4354940	Was there or was it something else? I'm pretty sure there was
4356140	4358140	Hell if I know chat helped
4359340	4362060	I don't yes. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you
4363660	4367100	And it's funny because he pushes up his glasses and his eyes look like that
4368060	4370540	So I always I always think it's funny
4371820	4373580	Yeah, the white haired guy
4373580	4375580	I always I thought he was cute
4375660	4378300	Because I like his little glasses and his glasses would glint
4379180	4384060	I got you. He's doable from naruto though. Yeah, I agree with that statement. Um
4385420	4387420	Pass kabutops
4388060	4390060	That's a smash
4390140	4391980	Uh
4391980	4393980	I don't want to be topped by kabutops
4394940	4397340	Uh, I feel like we would
4398620	4400620	I just don't think we're compatible
4400620	4402620	with my with my dom
4403180	4404380	You know
4404380	4407980	I don't know. I think he might take a pigging if he was just fim dom him hard enough
4408060	4411100	You know just girl boss harder. This girl boss harder
4411660	4418060	Just girl boss harder because like he's basically scyther. Yeah, no wings. No wings. That's that's a good point
4419420	4421420	Ah
4421580	4423740	And plus like if you just chain his little like
4424380	4430380	Scythe sysicles like in front of him then like all he's got to do is move his back back legs
4431660	4436540	All right, and then yeah, yeah, you have that you have that action pump action going on
4440220	4445980	Just gonna hog tie up this kabutops this kabutops is getting topped. All right, I'll smash
4446940	4448940	Yeah
4449340	4451340	Rip you in half from a hug
4451420	4453260	aerodactyl
4453260	4457340	Okay, this one actually pisses me the fuck off. I hate its face so much
4458300	4459580	I hate him
4459580	4464780	But like not just because of the way he looks that episode of pokemon pissed me the fuck off
4465180	4472300	Where ash gets like abducted by the aerodactyl and he tries to tell people. Yeah, that was me and nobody fucking believes him
4473180	4475180	This motherfucker
4476380	4481580	Like no one will believe you get abducted by an aerodactyl because look how goofy that thing looks
4482220	4489420	But then again, like nobody ever believes ash when he when he tries to count his adventures. I think he just gave up
4490460	4492540	That's very accurate. I think he just yeah
4492620	4498060	He just is like this came to terms that he's forever a child and no one will ever believe anything he ever says
4498300	4504780	Like his very first adventure like he can't tell anyone that he was the kid who saved the world because of you two and mew
4504860	4506860	Felt so fucking bad for him
4506940	4509500	Like throwing himself into like a pokemon battle
4510460	4514540	And then like when they meet mew two again, it's like, oh, this is our second time eating
4514540	4517260	It's like I have no memory of the first time. It's like
4521900	4523900	Oh my god
4524220	4526460	Sorry, I didn't mean to go off on a little rant there
4526460	4533580	No, I love your little rant. It's perfect. I hate aerodactyl. I bet you'll hate aerodactyl mega even more
4537420	4541260	He looks like a gross dude with a goatee that would like
4542140	4544140	Have a weird van
4544140	4546140	and always smell like piss
4546780	4552380	He looks like that bad dragon from like, uh, what was that movie dragon heart?
4553340	4555020	Oh
4555020	4560140	From dragon heart. I hate it. I thought you meant bad dragon and I like like in the toy and I was very confused
4561180	4565260	Not a bad dragons are okay, but this one is a bad bad dragon. Oh my god
4565260	4570140	Yeah, the drag I haven't watched dragon heart in a long time. Holy crap. Everybody used to love that movie
4572060	4577020	Oh, I distinctly watching that distinctly remember my heart is well protected
4582380	4585820	So pass, uh, snorlax smash smash
4586860	4587740	smash
4587740	4589740	You got the nice little
4589900	4592060	old chubby boy
4592060	4594060	perfect for snuggling
4595260	4599900	He is he's so good. He's like you're but he's your lazy fuck. Yeah
4604460	4606460	Yes
4606620	4608620	That's literally me
4609340	4611660	Not eating this one now. I wouldn't eat snorlax
4612380	4616380	He's like totoro. Yeah. Oh, I want to smash totoro though
4618380	4620380	I'll smash snorlax
4620380	4624780	I mean, he's not totoro, but he's like totoro. He's like sexy totoro
4626940	4631420	Sexy totoro. Yeah, look at his sexy gaze with his eyes half closed
4632220	4637740	Look, it took this man over like 10 years to stand up. I'm not I'm not gonna say that he's not sexy
4638380	4640380	Yeah, and I can you can just ride him
4641340	4643340	And just you know do whatever you want
4644220	4646220	Of course. Yeah
4646220	4648220	Yeah, smash. Yeah. Yeah
4649580	4651580	Uh
4652380	4654380	That's a tree. Where's his face?
4655980	4661900	Where's the gigantic max? He's just gone. He's just he's laying down again. He's tired. He got up
4662700	4664700	When you when you smash the first time and he's like
4665660	4672540	He's like just do do what you want pick an apple walk walk the bushes
4675180	4678460	I'll definitely pick an apple. I'm so I'm eat. I guess I'll eat him
4679820	4684300	You'll eat from him. Yeah, I'll eat the produce of his long eats
4685900	4690220	I don't know. I feel like it's still a smash. I feel all right to use. I feel like you could use his
4691660	4693500	Snorlax
4693500	4695180	his his
4695180	4700060	What what am I thinking of Snorlax sack as like a beanbag chair sort of situation? No
4700940	4702940	Like it's sort of a micro
4703020	4706300	macro sort of situation. Yeah, it's very like giant
4707740	4709100	Giantess
4709100	4711100	Yeah, except he
4711180	4713180	Except he's like the giant. Yeah
4714780	4716780	And it's more chill
4717500	4721340	It is definitely a lot more chill and you could take a stroll in his gardens afterwards
4721900	4724140	Yeah, air air yourself off
4725260	4727740	Air yourself off. You're just like a wet
4729740	4731740	Muppet yeah
4732940	4735740	He just here just like plop as every time you move
4738060	4742220	It's like just wet fabric as you're going up the sidewalk his treasure trail
4743100	4745100	Oh my god
4745500	4748140	I like how he does like have a happy trail technically
4748220	4750220	See
4751020	4754060	If he wasn't they knew what they were doing when they designed them
4756620	4759180	I'm still gonna pass I'm gonna smash
4759660	4761580	Okay
4761580	4767500	This is a bird. This is a bird. I'm eating it. I'm eating past the bird pass
4768700	4770700	However
4771100	4773100	This one
4773260	4774380	Like
4774380	4780700	Don't get me wrong. I'm sure regular articuno is like the equivalent of eating cold fried chicken, which is delicious
4781580	4788860	But this one this one's more smashable because of like that's just the just the that's the cunty energy that it's the aura
4789420	4791900	He's serving a very tuxedo mask
4793660	4795660	I'm gonna yeah, I'll smash I'll smash this bird
4796460	4803260	Like if it if articuno galer was like a bunny, this is what harlott's final form would probably have
4803340	4805660	Oh my god, you're so great actually
4806220	4808220	That would be so true
4808220	4810220	They do have the same air of it as a harlot
4810940	4812460	um
4812460	4814380	Zaptos
4814380	4817980	Look at those drumsticks good for dipping and mashed potatoes
4819180	4821180	I'm having that with honey mustard
4821180	4823020	Eating this. Oh, yeah
4823020	4825340	Passing and eating passing and eating
4826060	4829260	Okay, but zaptos galer
4829900	4831900	Hello
4832380	4836300	These thickums I still want to eat him. He looks like spicy chicken
4837180	4844060	I think I'd smash him. Yeah, the the spice would be fun to deal with but probably would hurt a little bit. Yeah
4845340	4848060	Do you would it be spicy when you copulate?
4849900	4851900	God, what if it is
4852300	4855660	I just feel like I would just be burned like that's why it's hard for me
4856620	4861660	To think that way about fire type pokemon because i'm like I feel like they're just too warm
4862860	4864060	Sometimes
4864060	4869740	I think I would burn myself and it's a little cloaca. I'm sure if you use like protection it would be fine
4870540	4872540	spicy turkey
4874700	4876700	He gained seasoning um
4877900	4879900	I'll eat him
4880620	4882220	All right
4882220	4885580	Moltres, uh again spicy chicken. I'll eat that
4886620	4890780	I never liked Moltres. He was always ugly. Yeah, I never liked Moltres either
4891660	4893660	However
4894700	4896700	The glare version
4902300	4906300	He's very pretty very pretty but he kind of looks like a dick
4906540	4911740	Yeah, like he's got ass hole vibes. Yeah, he's fuck boy energy
4912540	4913660	He does
4913660	4915820	I'm gonna pass but he's pretty to look at
4916540	4919900	He is I I keep him in a gilded cage. Yes
4921420	4924620	We'll steal him. We're robbing him like his actual self
4925820	4927340	Yeah
4927340	4929340	Uh dratini
4930460	4931340	So
4931340	4934700	Dratini's are really cute. That's what these are so cute
4935420	4937420	That's a worm
4937820	4940380	That's a little guy. It's a little worm guy
4941580	4943180	I'm gonna pass
4943180	4945180	I'm passing
4945340	4950540	Don't you dare leave him alone. We're passing everybody. Relax dragon air
4951340	4953340	That's a smash. That's a smash
4953980	4957980	Dragon air has always been a beautiful lady. Oh, yeah, I I remember
4959260	4962060	being young playing pokemon
4962540	4964540	And just
4965500	4969180	Intensely looking at dragon air and wanting a dragon air so bad
4970460	4974540	Because like not only does it have like three gems that you can touch
4975420	4982460	Together, right? It's got beautiful winged ears beautiful and it's just long and smooth. Yeah
4983100	4987660	Everything I feel like it'll be really good for snuggling like you can just like coil up with it
4988380	4993900	Mm-hmm, and then yeah, I bet like the tail is very prehensile prehensile and it can control it pretty well
4993900	4995900	So it just like pump in and out
4996060	4997100	Yeah
4997100	5001900	Yeah, I'm I'm really feeling dragon air 100 percent always. Yep
5003580	5006780	Dragonite dragonite. We gotta have words, buddy. I don't
5007740	5009500	What happened?
5009500	5015660	What happened man? You had two you you were winning you were winning two. I feel like I got catfish
5015900	5017900	like
5018460	5021660	Why why does he turn orange? I never got that
5023260	5027020	Why is he not like a beautiful blue dragon?
5027980	5030300	I know it bothers me like a like a nice
5031340	5033340	almost like almost like Gyarados
5034060	5035660	type dragon
5035660	5037660	But a lot smoother and like winged
5038700	5043340	Like there there should be an alternate reality where dragonite looks more like it's dragon air self
5043740	5050460	Yeah, like I don't care how they do it put it put dragonite in another like
5052300	5057420	Like a country like galare and give him an alternate form make him blue
5058220	5059340	make him
5059340	5065580	Like beautiful because he deserves to be beautiful instead of a Barney look at motherfucker
5066780	5071100	I would give him a hug though. I would I would hug him. He's cute, but annoying
5072060	5073740	pass
5073740	5075740	Mewtwo
5076060	5078060	Mewtwo looks like a lush vibrator
5079100	5083260	Honestly, he do he look like he look like a lush three
5085580	5087900	Like he's he's strapped in he's ready for you
5090940	5092940	Oh, that makes a lot of sense
5093020	5095020	So do you see the comment in the chat?
5095420	5099580	Oh, which one there's a theory that dragonite and Gyarados got swapped during development
5099580	5104620	Gyarados would have been dragon airs evolution the blue dragon dragonite would have been magic harps evolution
5105660	5107660	The color scheme makes sense
5108540	5110540	Yeah, I don't like it though. Yeah
5111100	5112620	I don't like it
5112620	5115660	Love sense looking motherfucker. Yeah, I would smash Mewtwo
5117420	5119260	I would too
5119260	5123020	He's skilled with his hands too. Yeah, and he's a psychic type so
5124300	5126300	Really put my brain to work
5127260	5130780	Um, it's called a dragonite a Barney look at it
5132940	5138140	They should have done better. They should have done better all those years ago and we wouldn't have called him a Barney looking motherfucker
5139820	5142380	Mew or Mewtwo in terms of like power
5142940	5144700	I'll be
5144700	5146700	Isn't that Mew? Yeah, Mew
5147420	5150700	Because Mew is older than Mewtwo. Mewtwo's a baby. Yeah
5151980	5153820	Mewtwo mega
5153820	5155820	I always like the design of this but I don't
5157260	5159100	Like it
5159100	5161100	Like that I
5162300	5165660	I don't know. It's a little weird for me. Yeah
5173020	5176060	Okay pass um mega x
5178140	5182700	I mean it's just a smaller tail and like more broader shoulders and arms
5183420	5187180	He looked like he stand on business though. Like he can really plant himself
5189900	5191900	Really really mating press
5193580	5198140	Just really get in there. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I'll I'll say
5199260	5201260	Yeah
5201820	5203660	I'll smash
5203660	5205260	You know what?
5205260	5208780	If I could see him from behind because I'm sure he's got a like a big back porch
5209500	5211500	I'm gonna say yeah. Yeah, okay
5212460	5213980	Smash
5213980	5215100	Smash
5215100	5217100	Um Mew
5217100	5221740	This is a mouse. You're a smash Mew. Yeah, I'm a smash Mew. Also
5222780	5228380	Also, I figured Mew was always a cat. That's why it was Mew. Oh, that's a good point
5233020	5238300	It just looks like a mouse to me Mew is another of all pokemon forms aside
5241580	5243580	Good point
5244140	5246140	Besides like
5246380	5248380	even even though like
5248540	5253420	Like if we're just talking like pokemon wise the moveset that Mew has
5254700	5258620	Probably way better than Mew two for smash it. Yeah
5259420	5263260	I just also the tail the tail looks way more
5263980	5268700	Like human body anatomy muffin friendly. You're right
5269580	5271580	So like you just can't
5271980	5274620	Those little arms. It's also just too cute
5275500	5278860	Well, I could hug it. I don't need it to hug me
5280620	5285580	I was like, it's a little paw paws. It's so cute. I can't I like the world something so cute
5286780	5288780	Mew is a fetus
5291820	5292620	Ah
5292620	5296620	Well, if I guess I'm looking at it like a fetus, I guess I'd eat it more than I would
5297180	5299180	I'd eat a fetus
5300460	5303020	I mean, it's just under cooked meat
5304460	5306460	Yeah, that's a good point
5307180	5309180	Um chikorita
5309740	5313260	Uh canonical first yandere of the pokemon series
5314460	5316460	I would eat chikorita
5317340	5321180	I want animation. I think of someone like cooking a chikorita. I was like that looks delicious
5321820	5325820	So do you think like it's it's more meat or more vegetable? I feel like
5327580	5330060	I feel like it has like a meaty core
5331020	5333020	But like veggie on the outside
5333500	5337100	I'm gonna pass on eating this thing, but it's definitely not a smash
5338540	5341740	I'm gonna pass and I'm gonna eat it. I know you don't like vegetables that much
5342460	5344460	I hate vegetables
5344940	5350380	Okay, bay leaf is sexy though. I like bay leaf. I like bay leaf's face. I like I like their style
5350620	5353660	I would smash bay leaf. Yeah, bay leaf is a smash
5354620	5359260	Chikorita's an impossible burger. Understandable. I would get that meat substitute
5359980	5365820	The Thickorita video I now I'm tempted to find out what that is. Smash bay leaf
5366300	5367260	Um
5367260	5369260	Meganium
5372460	5374460	It's just essentially almost a feminine
5375500	5379100	Yeah, I bet it smells nice like yeah, gardenia. Ooh
5381340	5383340	Smash yeah
5383980	5385420	Cyndaquil
5385420	5388060	Oh, that's a pass but a cuddler. Yeah
5388940	5390940	I want one. I want to get poked
5391820	5396300	Quilava burned, but like real cute real cute
5399100	5401100	Quilava looks too sassy to me
5401740	5404300	Now quilava is a smash for me. Yeah
5405100	5410460	Yeah, he's in his in his rebellious teenage phase. I know he has a little mohawk going
5411420	5415340	He's got that anime protagonist. He just needs goggles and a scarf
5417100	5419500	Maybe like some maybe like some gloves too
5420940	5428060	So real got yourself a whole OC here. Just need some accessories. That's true. You could turn off the flames. That's a good point
5429660	5431660	Um, I'll pass
5432940	5434940	Typhlosion I'd smash
5436380	5437980	Good
5437980	5439980	Good good
5440700	5442700	Good as he is a smash
5443100	5445100	uh
5445660	5449260	Typhlosion his he I can't never pronounce that looks a little bit
5450460	5452460	Predatory in my opinion
5453580	5456460	It's a smash for me. Yeah, he's got prettier
5458540	5460540	I need
5461340	5466620	He's like ladies. Can I buy you a drink? I don't know. He just seems sleazy to me
5466620	5470300	I'm gonna like he's really nice to look at but I feel like I ended up being disappointed
5471340	5473820	You know what? I'm okay with him looking sleazy
5474300	5478940	Because like all all he's got to do is like close his eyes and have like that fox face expression
5479340	5486460	Okay, like some some uh dojins have and I'm just I'm sold. I'm just here's the bedroom eyes. Very true
5487180	5488380	All right
5488380	5489900	Totodile
5489900	5491900	No, oh no
5492220	5495260	Totodile is one of my favorite. I would usually
5495980	5497260	um
5497260	5499260	I forgot is that heart gold?
5499660	5504060	I think totodile gold silver. Yeah, uh, I love my heart gold game
5504540	5506540	I love totodile so much
5506860	5510860	And that it's evolutions because they were my starter. I can't I could never
5512140	5515340	I guess totodile has always been a delight. Yeah
5516300	5519260	Crocodile is ugly to look at though. I hate crocodile
5520140	5521340	He needs
5521340	5526060	He needs a little club. He needed a bone club. He needs to pull this together. Yeah
5526620	5530700	He looks so much like a dinosaur rather than like a crocodile here in my opinion. Yeah
5531740	5537500	Um, but it's still a pass. Yeah for alligator looks like he's cross-eyed sometimes and he's like screaming
5541740	5547900	I look I feel like for alligator. I would just ask why are you so loud? Yeah, I feel like he's about to hit the dab
5547900	5549900	Um
5551260	5554140	Let it be said the for alligator is a dancer
5558540	5560860	For alligators, I'm going to chase you down the alley
5562060	5566220	He's referring to t-pose. Yeah, I just I'm gonna pass the for alligator
5566860	5567980	uh
5567980	5569980	centret
5569980	5571740	uh
5571740	5572940	Pass
5572940	5575020	Yeah, I don't know what I could do with that
5575980	5580300	I mean a hug. Yeah, definitely hug hundred percent hug
5581740	5583740	But it's a pass. Yeah
5584620	5586620	Now furret
5588620	5590620	Furret's too cute for me
5591340	5597740	Nah, furret's a great up smash because first of all furrets are real fucking big furrets are big
5597740	5603420	They're pretty giant. I always thought they were small and then I remember looking at the pokedex and seeing how big they actually were
5603420	5607340	And I was like what the fuck furret seems a vigorous. Mmm
5608140	5610140	Also, I just love that song
5623660	5627180	Um, I'll pass on furret you're smashing him. I'm smashing him
5627740	5629740	Uh hoot hoot
5629820	5631820	No, that's an owl
5632140	5635980	I thought with one foot that is a poor baby disabled owl
5636940	5639340	I remember I used to pronounce it hoot
5641100	5648060	I mean to be fair though, it's pokemon so that that could be a legitimate american pronunciation
5648220	5650220	hoot
5651660	5653660	Oh pass knocked owl
5656620	5660780	He's so serious very serious. I feel like he'd be such a boring lay
5661900	5663260	Yeah
5663260	5665660	And he would just be really judgmental of you after
5665660	5670460	Yeah, like, you know, you could have done this better or I didn't like how you did that and I'm just like
5671020	5673020	I didn't even get to come
5673260	5674620	so
5674620	5679100	I bet this knocked owl would look at you and be like I can tell the type of poor and you watch is boring
5681980	5687260	Like like he's into some real freaky stuff and he's always trying to ask you for a little bit more
5687580	5692460	And you're just like you're a fucking owl. I don't want to do that. And he's like, why are you even here? Yeah
5694620	5696620	All right pass the knocked owl
5697020	5699020	ladyba
5699260	5701420	Hmm, ladyba is so cute
5702860	5706060	Ladyba is so cute. There's little fist leggies
5707020	5709020	Looks like he's gonna punch me
5709580	5715500	But like adorably like it won't hurt. It'll be like a little like like squishy noise like the squeaky squeaky toy noise
5716300	5720300	Yeah, I think ladyba's like a pass for me. Yeah
5721180	5722700	Yeah
5722700	5724700	You're hearing audio cut out
5725500	5729180	Oh, it's it. Uh, is it me? Is it me my audio coming out?
5731980	5733980	Tell us
5734620	5736620	360 degree eye contact though
5737740	5739740	I mean, that's pretty impressive
5740140	5742140	Very impressive
5742620	5745500	Epee. Uh, all right pass ladyba
5746940	5748940	Okay pass ladyba
5749980	5751740	Lady in
5751740	5756220	Okay, I really like lady ins design though. Me too. Like a like a little sentai guy
5757500	5759500	He really does look like a little sentai guy
5760540	5762540	All audio, huh?
5762940	5768700	Well, the stream did like turn into a black screen for me for a moment. So I did it could be my bit rate
5769180	5771180	Oh, yeah, my bit rate is shit right now
5772140	5774700	Damn, I just looked at it. I'm getting so many dropped frames
5775820	5779580	Um, yeah, the stream is lagging. I can see it
5780860	5782460	Oh
5782460	5784460	No
5786060	5790940	I'm not getting ever getting buffering. That's too bad. Yeah, my I literally have like
5792380	5795340	Normal bit rate, but I have so many dropped frames right now
5796380	5800380	You know what? It's just youtube trying to nerf us because we're too powerful with these
5801340	5803340	Definitely, they're just like stop
5803820	5805820	You can't handle it
5805820	5807820	enough
5808060	5811580	Um, it's normal now. It hasn't it's gonna keep doing that. I can tell
5812460	5816140	I can see it doing it on my oh there it goes now. It's good
5817260	5818460	We're back
5818460	5820460	All right, we've never been more back

6120780	6123980	Little too hard boiled, but that's okay. We can fix that. Yeah
6126860	6130060	I'm trying to think about how I would prepare this togapi
6133260	6134860	Hmm
6134860	6137820	You know since it's like technically a hard hard boiled egg
6137900	6142380	All you have to do is like maybe like stab it and then you can probably just eat it
6142780	6144780	Yeah, maybe it'll be like a little deviled egg moment
6145500	6146700	Oh, yeah
6146700	6147980	Ooh, that'd be pretty good
6147980	6151100	Like yeah, like you cut off like the top where the three spikes are
6151420	6155420	Yeah, you scoop out the insides and you make like the inside for devil salad. Mm-hmm

6225420	6228780	I was thinking like a bouncy ball. I would chew on it because then maybe it's like rubbery
6229500	6231820	Like a chew I want to know if it smells like a tennis ball
6232780	6235820	Okay sniffing sniffing not we have a new

6271420	6273420	Under the robe like that shape
6274460	6276140	Hmm
6276140	6279580	Wait, isn't that wait, isn't that just actually his wings just held in front of him?

6869100	6875020	Well, I mean canonical. Well, we're on. Well, if you if you check yourself, you'll see that you're on a hand
6875420	6879660	I'm looking at my hand size right now. So that means I'm like less than a foot
6880380	6883260	Yeah, you're probably like about two feet
6884860	6889020	Because like you got to put your hand into the top. Oh, that's true
6889980	6893500	Okay, and then like the rest of it's got to be your body. So like
6894220	6898940	About two feet because like your hand itself is maybe like what six inches
6903340	6904780	I need a
6904780	6906380	I need a ruler
6906380	6908380	I have very long fingers
6908540	6910540	Now harlots, did you know
6911500	6916460	If your hand is bigger than your face, you might be a candidate for a cancer screening
6917180	6918700	Wait, what?
6918700	6922300	My hand is half bigger than my face and I'm safe. Did you actually put your hand up there?
6922380	6926860	I did if I know if you were here you would have smacked me in the face. Yes, I would
6933820	6937020	We need to do an off collab where we do this in person
6938380	6945660	I just actually get smacked in the face for my stupidity. I realized what that was afterwards. I was like wait, I remember this
6951180	6954300	All right, I guess I'll smash low king. Yeah
6958540	6961260	Still a smash for me, baby. No, thanks
6962540	6967500	That's still a smash for me. I don't like it. This one's only 511 though
6968380	6970380	I don't like it. I'm passing
6970780	6972300	smash him
6972300	6974860	Are we gonna do you want to pause and mistreat us?
6975500	6977500	Yeah, we're at an even 200
6977500	6982780	Yeah, and and like after that we get into like the good ones like low punny and all that good
6985740	6987740	My beloved
6988140	6990140	All right
6990140	6993340	I'll pick this up next week. Yeah, I do
6994220	7003900	We it's gonna be like seven episodes like a hundred an episode or eight episodes. So that's just smashing and passing
7006780	7009900	Tell me what day you want to do it on and we'll schedule it

7108860	7112620	Do you want to tell them the good news by the way that you showed me the other day?
7113340	7115100	the pdf
7115100	7117660	Oh, I have drawn up
7118460	7120460	What is a rigable?
7120700	7121580	uh
7121580	7123580	shibby cotton bum muppet
7124700	7126700	That can be live 2d rigged
7127180	7130060	unfortunately, I'm a little dog water at
7130860	7132860	rigging so
7133420	7135260	I might
7135260	7137500	Need a lot of time to rig it
7139340	7141340	Or I can find somebody to help
7142940	7144780	Rig it
7144780	7146780	DEMPA actually might know how to rig
7147100	7149740	Mike you could probably ask DEMPA. I just thought of that
7150700	7152140	Maybe
7152140	7155740	I just and it's funny because like I just like woke up and she's like look what I made
7157180	7159180	She just slid me the pdf
7159580	7162940	And I was just screaming I was so happy
7163900	7169420	I'll tell you I'll I'll tell you how it how it came to be. I was there the entire uh
7170540	7175260	Ellen ring stream. Yeah, the entire elden ring stream and I was just working on it
7177180	7179180	It's it's you guys don't even know
7180460	7182300	My final form
7182300	7184300	Slowly coming to fruition
7185580	7191980	I'm tempted even a surprise. There's even a surprise in the pdf for you. No, I didn't even I didn't want to uh
7192380	7197340	peek through the files too deeply because I kind of wanted to wait and be surprised until it's rigged
7198140	7200140	um
7202780	7205500	Maybe I can also look at some rig videos to see if I can do it myself
7206220	7209020	I've never even tried rigging before but it's a very good skill to have
7209980	7212460	It is yeah, and just being able to cut
7213180	7215180	Stuff as well to make models
7215420	7219500	Um, I need to learn how to draw properly first. I'm still working on that
7220140	7227260	You draw plenty. Well, it's really cute your art style. It's developing into something that suits you. Oh, thank you. I try
7228220	7229580	Oh
7229580	7234220	But um, yeah, please give uh trinket a follow on tomah keys
7236140	7239360	We're starting a muppet tuba revolution
7240700	7242700	We love muppets. We love muppets here
7243340	7246220	Now I think I want to do a muppet watch a lot at some point
7246700	7250300	And probably have you on for that. We can watch like muppets in our space or something
7251100	7255740	Ah man, I was actually just talking about how in the late 2000s
7256380	7258380	Late 90s early 2000s
7258380	7263660	There was like just this theme of found family and it started off with gonzo just being like
7264060	7266540	I'm not sure if i'm a whatever anymore
7266860	7271420	And then you just the next year after that you come out with the tigger movie and it's like
7271980	7276140	Man, maybe being the only tigger isn't so based
7277500	7279500	That's such a good one. There was like a weird
7279820	7282060	Arrow where there was a lot of found family stuff
7282140	7285820	Which is also very sweet and cute because everybody deserves family, you know
7286140	7289900	But like I went back and I watched the trailer for the tigger movie, right?
7290060	7294380	Do you know how they advertise the tigger movie coming out? No, how did they?
7295100	7298460	Do you remember first they give you like a really high energy like
7299100	7306460	Basically the whole high energy song about tigger teaching ru how to do like the soup the the super duper alley uber
7307580	7311820	Bounce essentially doesn't he like it's raining and it gets really depressing or something
7312300	7317900	No, they don't show you any context to what happens in the movie. All you know
7317980	7320620	It's like, oh, it's a little tigger movie. My kids are gonna love this
7320780	7325340	They don't tell you about the trauma you're about to deliver upon your kids like firsthand
7325900	7327900	The tigger like runs away because he's like
7328620	7333420	My family never was coming. Well, I'm going to go find them. Oh my god
7334140	7336940	Like you don't know that you're in for an emotional bomb
7337340	7342540	They do the same fucking bullshit with the with the hunt for christopher or the search for christopher robin
7342700	7348460	Where it's like, oh no christopher robin's gone missing. We've got to go and find him. He's been stolen by
7349260	7351260	Skull
7351260	7355180	But it's like and then you have like winnie the pooh just getting all depressed
7355580	7360540	And everyone just doubting themselves the entire movie and winnie the pooh has like all this cryptic knowledge
7360620	7363260	That he can't remember because he's a silly old bear
7363900	7365900	It's the worst
7367180	7369180	We do not like
7369180	7373900	Winnie the pooh trauma trauma here whether it wouldn't matter the character
7375660	7377660	They don't deserve this
7377660	7382700	They do it to everyone though. The only people who haven't had trauma is perhaps kanga
7385180	7388940	Kanga hasn't had a single bit of trauma at all. Yeah, kanga's pretty chill
7389820	7393580	Kiglet's had trauma. I think it's trauma in the animated series
7393980	7399820	Tigger has a whole fucking movie about it. So does winnie the pooh. Eeyore's just like always depressed
7400620	7406300	Yeah, Eeyore Eeyore Eeyore never knows a moment's peace because he's always at the beck and call of everybody else
7407820	7413100	And then like you have made up characters like gopher who's like well study
7414380	7416380	Ah, i'm just dandy
7419340	7422540	I feel like yeah kanga is a single mom. That's right because i'm like i can't
7423180	7425980	I feel like she was like arguing with owl about something
7427900	7429900	She's a single mom. Yeah
7431420	7434460	And then owl nothing bad ever happens to owl
7435420	7438380	Owls in fact he causes all of the problem
7438940	7444860	Owl causes 90 of the problems because they all go to him because he's the owl and supposedly learned
7445180	7447180	But owl can't read either
7447900	7449500	Nope
7449500	7452380	He's secretly he thinks he's so smart, but he's not
7453180	7455180	He's not he just uses
7455980	7459180	The ignorance of the other animals against them
7460300	7463660	To be some pseudo leader in its sickening
7464620	7468220	And then they introduce like a half a lump and that doesn't really go anywhere
7469660	7471660	Half a lump is so cute though
7471740	7473740	What's his name? It's like ala something
7474460	7479660	I forget it did like ala wishes. Yeah ala wishes. I love that name ala wishes
7480460	7482060	It's so cute
7482060	7486700	And like I feel like if like 2d animation for disney had gone on for a little bit longer
7486780	7490220	We would have gotten a like a woozel character joining the cast as well
7490700	7495580	Like a little friendly woozel since we got a really friendly half a lump
7499420	7501420	Why don't they come up with these names
7504460	7508460	So owls just Congress I suppose yeah pretty much
7511100	7513100	I like how he just went on a random tangent
7513500	7515500	I'm not waiting for the whole character
7516140	7519500	I'm so sorry. No when it was the both of us and it was so funny
7520620	7522620	Oh
7524220	7529180	Okay, well, is there any closing words you want to say to the harem before we
7529900	7531900	You say goodbye
7531900	7533900	Brush your teeth wash your butt
7534380	7538860	And if you ever need that extra clean feeling you can use
7539900	7544380	Water on your toilet paper and it essentially acts as a wet wipe. Yeah
7545180	7547180	and then you don't have to you know
7547900	7550300	Cause issues in your plumbing system by using like
7551020	7553580	Cotton L wipes or something or baby wipes
7554220	7559340	Yep, and if you're a little bougie you could put rose water on your toilet paper and then
7560540	7564380	Or witch hazel which acts as an astringent and it doesn't burn
7565100	7567100	Very true. Very true. Or you can get a bidet
7567900	7570300	Or you could get a bidet. I want to try to get a bidet
7570380	7573180	I don't I couldn't I probably want to be able to install it in my apartment
7573660	7575660	But it'd be really cool to have a bidet
7575820	7578940	It would just shoot water up right up my butt
7581260	7583260	Like like galaga
7583660	7590300	Oh, no, I don't joker. That's why you double up the toilet paper. Oh, yeah, what you want to yeah
7590300	7594780	You want to fold that up a couple times before you get you don't want to do like one single square
7595660	7597660	Yeah, who does that?
7597740	7599740	I know somebody who does that
7600620	7604380	What am I friends? I remember sleeping over her house
7604940	7609100	And she's like, oh, can you grab me a square toilet paper? Like I'm out of toilet. I'm like a square
7610300	7611820	A square
7611820	7617100	How do you know a square is not going to keep your hands clean you got to double that shit up exactly
7617500	7618860	I
7618860	7620860	I questioned our friendship after that
7621420	7622620	honestly
7622620	7627020	Like don't fall for the charnel bears or the shaman bear propaganda
7627260	7633340	You use as much toilet paper as you want you bought it. I think it was because she grew up mostly in a house full of boys
7634540	7638140	And for boys like they don't really like when they pee they don't wipe
7639020	7641020	Or they just like do a little shake
7641100	7645580	No boys don't wipe. Yeah, they have to do that shake and then you got to wonder like well
7645580	7651020	What didn't it be effective if they did do like a little dab? Yeah, I think that's she got the dab from that
7653340	7654700	It's
7654700	7658940	Yeah, you got a little then you got a little piss stain on your pants, especially if you were in sweatpants
7659660	7663500	Yeah, and then it just makes like makes it look like you didn't like make it in time. Yeah
7664780	7669500	And that's kind of sad if you think about it like at least when a girl doesn't make it in time
7669660	7671660	It's kind of like hell. Yeah
7674780	7681260	But the smell is there, but we can cover that up too. It's a little perfume bath and potty wars
7685500	7690140	That's why your kegel exercises are very important to keep you from pissing when you sneeze
7691100	7693100	Like and it's weird because I didn't
7693820	7698780	When I was sneezing the uh, I don't is that what you're referencing right now? Yeah, okay. Um
7700140	7703980	I'm like just I just suddenly feel personally attacked to be funny if you weren't even talking about that
7704940	7709420	It wasn't because it happened it happens to me too because like when you get older you think
7709420	7712700	Oh, nothing bad's ever gonna happen to me and then next thing you know
7712780	7717420	You're sneezing and like lord help you if it happens to be like one of those days of the month
7717980	7719980	And oh, that's the worst
7720540	7722540	And then you're like a gusher and then you're just
7723180	7729020	You're just call. Yeah, call me your little ketchup packet when I sneeze. I swear to god. Um
7731020	7733500	Um, no, it wasn't even pee
7740380	7742380	You know
7742620	7744620	That's fine
7745100	7750460	That's fine. You know, the body is full of mysterious substances. Yeah
7751420	7753740	We could basically say that it was sprinkles
7754380	7756380	sparkles
7756380	7758380	Rainbows at this point
7758540	7760540	Like
7764620	7771020	Like honestly, I'm still trying to figure out if the human body could essentially work like a straw
7773820	7775020	I wonder
7775020	7777020	Oh, can you do like
7777580	7780860	Did you see that like clip of like the girls doing kegel exercises?
7781740	7783980	And they're pulling up stuff through this. Yeah
7785020	7787020	I want to try that
7788380	7790380	I
7791660	7793660	Would you ever try that
7793900	7798380	I would but I don't think I could do it. I don't have the pelvic wall string
7799100	7800780	I'm practicing right now
7800780	7801900	one
7801900	7802940	two
7802940	7803980	two three
7803980	7806140	three four four hold it
7808220	7810220	Release
7810940	7822060	I hope you did it. I hope you did it with us harlot. Yeah, you better
7822860	7826620	You'll have to go back and you'll have to do it all over again. Exactly
7831740	7834620	And remember if you're clenching your butt, you're doing it wrong
7834940	7836940	Um
7838380	7842940	But yeah, no, yeah guys can do it too. It just makes your your little pee pee bounce
7845020	7850540	Yeah, and like it's okay because you guys have that button in the backside. Yeah to help
7851420	7853580	Doesn't it like strengthen their prostate or something?
7854380	7859340	Yeah, it does. I think also, I don't know if I told you this really interesting fact
7859740	7863020	What so there there's a scientific method of like
7863980	7865980	Undoing hiccups
7866220	7870220	That has been proven and you'll never guess how is it doing
7871100	7872620	Kegels
7872620	7877740	No, no, no, it's actually a lot easier than doing kegels. Okay. You just got to put a finger up your butt
7878700	7879900	What?
7879900	7883260	Yep, if you put a finger up your butt it helps you stop the hiccups
7884780	7886780	How
7886860	7892540	Well, see there's a thing in your in your in your in your rectal space. Okay, I guess kind of push
7893020	7900300	It's not fake. You can google it. You can google it. It's there are there are there are there are there are findings
7901100	7902380	scientific finding
7902380	7904380	This is how I got my friends
7904540	7906540	Okay, so are you guys saying it's true?
7907180	7909180	Very interesting
7910780	7912780	I know lots of stuff
7912780	7914780	That's how I know
7914780	7915660	Oh
7915660	7918380	She does know lots of stuff. I'm being so educated right now
7919100	7923740	Honestly, it's a mystery what I know. I don't even know what I know until I tell people
7924940	7926380	It just comes up
7926380	7931420	I know that happens to me sometimes too just have random facts and I'm just like why did I say
7932380	7934380	But it's really prevalent
7934380	7941100	I can't tell you when the war of 1812 took place, but I can tell you that scooby-doo was created on september 1969
7941100	7948300	That's a more important fact
7949420	7951420	See it's important to know
7954380	7959900	1812 a fire call when the war of 1812 took place
7965900	7968780	Yeah, but when in 1812, I don't know
7971100	7973100	I
7975980	7979020	Yeah, you shove your finger up your butt to scare the hiccups away
7980940	7982940	Because everybody knows the hiccups come from the butt
7993660	7995660	I'm gonna try that next time I get hiccups
7996620	8000780	My fingers going up my butt and I'll tell you if guys if it works
8004540	8006540	Someone else's butt no you don't do that
8008060	8013660	Could you imagine though if we were on the magic school bus and it taught history instead of science and we went back in time
8015340	8018940	That would be so cool actually if they had like a magic school bus equivalent for that
8019980	8021980	Yeah, I like history
8022220	8026220	How come miss frizzle only taught science actually? Yeah, well they had
8027100	8031660	So many other subjects you need to learn in school and they were young enough that they only had one teacher
8032460	8034460	Yeah, she only taught science
8035100	8038380	Why wasn't she teaching like math or english or
8039500	8046620	Anything else like we had a music episode, but that was science adjacent. Yeah, they definitely should have taken her teaching license away
8047580	8054620	Also, I don't think any of these children's parents knew that they were leaving school in the middle of the day and going into like someone's body
8055340	8058620	Then they like travel into someone's body at one point on the bus
8059900	8063340	More than once don't they need like a parents permission slip for that?
8064300	8066300	nah
8066460	8068460	Don't they need consent to
8070780	8075660	I mean the child's at school that's consent enough for them to fly a bus into the child, right?
8077260	8086620	Well, actually no because they flew up. They flew the bus into Ralphie's sick body. Yeah, how can he consent to that? That's not fair
8088220	8094780	Well, I guess Ralphie said it was okay because he's like you guys are going inside me and miss frizzle's like yep
8095260	8096460	well
8096460	8098460	I feel like he felt like he didn't have a choice then
8099500	8105340	And you know, it's fucked up Ralphie's mom in that episode we find out that her like profession is she's a doctor
8105820	8107820	What a shitty doctor
8110460	8112460	So she doesn't
8112780	8116620	So she's like so like she even sees them inside of Ralphie's body
8116620	8121580	And she doesn't put two and two together because she's like wow this actually looks like the inside of a body
8121900	8125660	I can't believe your classmates put this together for you so you can learn how you're sick
8126060	8129820	Maybe it's a little too much excitement though. We should probably turn this off
8130060	8132060	Just
8132620	8134460	Gaslighting her son
8134460	8138140	Maybe she was gaslighting herself. Oh, yeah, the kid that almost died in space
8138940	8141420	Yep, that was Arnold. Take Arnold. Yeah, I was an Andrew
8143340	8145340	And then you had like the narc phoebe
8146060	8148060	Oh, I hated phoebe
8148140	8153100	They never did this at my old school. Bitch. You ain't at your old school. And we don't know why
8155740	8158060	Are you gonna expel because of how annoying you are
8159020	8163180	Fuck it. Phoebe. Fuck it's Phoebe, man. Carlos
8164700	8167100	Carlton is terrible puns
8172220	8174220	And then you had Tim who could draw
8175420	8177980	That was his that was this thing that was this thing
8178780	8183180	Yep, and then you had Keisha who was a good journalist. She was pretty good
8183900	8185900	I thought Keisha was cool
8185900	8192620	Yeah, Keisha was real cool. Arnold's now wanda. I wanted to wanda wanda fighting the fighting the curb in 4k
8193420	8195900	Every other episode they killed Arnold's cousin
8197260	8199020	wait
8199020	8200460	They killed janet
8200460	8201900	I hated janet
8201900	8203900	Janet was real annoying
8203900	8207740	Arnold's cousin almost rat the class out to the police and then they killed her was
8211260	8214300	I believe it too. I kind of want that to be canon
8216380	8221260	And then of course you have dorthian girl with two names bit of a no at all. Yeah
8223980	8228140	What a what a what a ride that show was I know
8230940	8236060	I wish I could be on the magic school bus. Yeah despite everything I wish I could be there too
8237820	8239820	I think
8239820	8242220	I'm trying to think of like what our character types would be
8243180	8246700	Hmm. Well, it is a short bus. So that's money
8250380	8255020	I'll be the really dumb blonde that doesn't understand what's going on
8256860	8260300	I'll be the one that thinks of way too many things that don't
8261020	8263020	pertain to the moment
8263340	8269180	You're just like they're like in his body and you're just like did you know that plants and they're like shut up trick
8273180	8277260	Ah, you just say the most inopportune facts at the wrong time
8278380	8281500	Did you know more people die because they wear their seatbelts?
8285020	8290380	Everybody on the bus just takes off their seatbelt seatbelts everyone and then you just say that
8295420	8301660	Horror theory is interesting on the magic school bus. Is there a creepypasta of that? I bet there is
8302220	8304220	Look, there's so many
8304300	8306140	Like I think like around last year
8306140	8308380	I stumbled upon the tiktok series where they were
8309180	8312380	Introducing like the magic school bus as a horror based theme and like
8313100	8318700	Every every field trip somebody would die, but they would be reincarnated by the end of the adventure. Oh my gosh
8320780	8324540	That is to miss frizzle just like some sort of crazy witch
8325580	8328860	Honestly, okay. So talking about I'm so sorry
8329580	8334380	Can I can I tell you about mary poppins? Yes, you could tell me about mary poppins
8335340	8343580	Okay, so you know how I also love mary poppins and you are aware that they came up with a mary poppins to mary poppins returns, right?
8343820	8345820	Yes, I remember watching that with my mom
8346300	8348300	Okay, mary poppins 2
8348300	8353900	Pisses me off right because it is seen for seen original mary poppins except now mary poppins
8354060	8359500	Now that she has like CGI magic instead of like practical effect magic feels more like a demon
8359820	8365740	Who's come back to feel some contractual agreement that she has with the bank's children
8367740	8369180	That
8369180	8371180	That actually makes so much sense
8371740	8376540	Because there's that scene like towards the end of the movie where we're already past like the point of hype
8376860	8381260	And they're like, oh no, we have to get up to the top of big Ben to stall time
8381740	8386620	And so you see all these lamp lighters making their way on the BMX bikes
8387100	8392860	Ladder to shit climbing on the outside of big Ben and mary poppins is standing there cool as a cucumber
8393100	8398460	And like she finally gets fed up like never seen humans to do a woman. She's not human
8399020	8401020	She's a demon
8401180	8403820	At that point and then she flies up with her umbrella
8403900	8410460	You see her silhouette and I'm like, bitch you could have done that the whole time and save these people like death because I'm pretty sure
8410860	8414620	Almost five of them fell off the tower that is big Ben
8415260	8418220	That would make a lot of sense because then as a demon she would just
8419340	8421580	Like to see humans suffer from time to time
8422140	8424140	And she does see humans suffer
8424300	8429500	She actively does see them suffer and then she likes to punish them especially when they're kids
8430300	8431820	and kind of like
8431820	8435260	Because think about like the medicine they didn't want to eat the medicine. She kind of like tortures them even
8436220	8440780	Yeah, because like you can even tell that she's not really there for the children to learn a lesson
8440940	8446140	No, the actual children. No, she's there for michael and jane because jane's almost like a spinster
8446220	8451660	She's like, I don't really want to date anyone mary poppins mary poppins sets her up with lynn manwell maranda
8453020	8455980	And then out of everybody, you know, that's your torture. No
8457020	8462620	And then like for michael, she's like you need to get over your dead wife. You have children my guy
8463420	8465420	i'ma help you
8465500	8467260	understand this
8467260	8470540	That you need to be the adult and they need to not be the adult
8471340	8475500	Well, what what would be what would be the the narrative with the chimney sweep?
8476940	8481660	So the chimney sweep is lynn manwell maranda is taking on the role of burt
8482380	8484460	In this movie, but what about like normal burt?
8485580	8487180	normal burt
8487180	8488700	What would be the
8488700	8490700	the story between them that he like
8491340	8493340	Fallen was she like a succubus?
8494060	8496060	so the way that I see it right
8496860	8499020	Is in the very first mary poppins movie
8499660	8506700	mary poppins has been to london before and she's known burt since she was like a younger sort of demon slash witch
8507100	8512940	And they sort of have like this sort of coexistence things because burt's got a little tricky magic of his own
8513420	8516460	True, but he can't really do it because he's not really a fully
8517260	8522860	Realized or or a wizard of some bro. I imagine they do like sabrina the teenage witch like they do with netflix
8523100	8527820	Except they do mary poppins and they make like a darker mary poppins when she was younger
8528460	8533820	You know what this disney's missing out because I have a million great ideas
8535100	8537600	They need to hire you. This is brilliant
8538160	8542800	I love that so much
8543760	8546720	Pennywise feeds on fear poppins feeds on joy
8548160	8552160	I don't even you know what I don't even think poppins feeds on joy
8552800	8555280	She feeds on what is considered obedience
8556480	8563520	Essentially obedience turning people into societal members and also teaching good family values
8564000	8567280	Because it takes place in britain even though they don't have british accents
8568000	8570000	Yeah, good point
8571840	8576480	Because like mary poppins could care less about women's suffrage in the first movie. Yeah, good
8577360	8579360	Yeah, she was just like whatever
8579520	8586000	Whatever, I don't I don't need to vote human laws don't really affect me. Yeah, she's like I've seen centuries of this
8588160	8590480	It all it all turns out the same
8590480	8592480	Hmm
8592720	8600080	Women go on having children men go to work and they neglect their kids. I'm here to teach you. Don't neglect your kids. Yep
8601040	8603040	I like this theory. This sounds very legit
8608400	8613200	Sorry, we went we went we went on a weird sort of roundabout from winnie the pooh
8614480	8616800	To magic school bus to mary poppins
8616800	8618800	Mm-hmm
8618800	8622000	We should just I like how we just have like lengthy discussions about
8622800	8624800	children's movies and shows and how they
8625680	8629280	See just conspiracy stream about how they're secretly all twisted
8631200	8633200	Analyze them
8634160	8636160	I'm a bit of a conspiracy theorist
8636960	8641520	I like it though. Are we all we should we should they're all we should all should uh, you know
8642320	8646400	Humor a little bit of conspiracy every now and then a little bit. Sometimes it's the truth
8647520	8652320	Yeah, like did you guys know that there's a genre of music that's devoted to flat earth?
8653440	8654880	What?
8654880	8662160	Yeah, what's it called listing is it good flat earth. It's honestly flat earth got some bops to it. Okay
8662880	8664880	all right
8666160	8670960	Trinket 15 minute rambles are impressive. This is why we're good friends because we're both just yappers
8672880	8674880	She's the only one that can match my yap
8677200	8679520	I can yapp as long as someone yaps with me
8681760	8686480	Flatcore oh my god, I mean they're bops
8688480	8690880	Oh, Mary and peter pan are the same
8691920	8695200	What explain elaborate on the peter pan theory
8695920	8704960	Oh, okay. I see what they're going for so peter pan himself is a bit of a demon because he goes and he kidnaps children from open windows
8705280	8706320	True
8706320	8708320	Because he he gives them this lie
8708720	8713120	You can come with me and never grow up, but that's not necessarily true for children that go with him
8713680	8720560	Because they do eventually grow up and when they grow up in neverland they turn into pirates in which peter pan kills pirates
8721280	8724160	And he's just constantly feeding himself
8725440	8727440	Whatever sick twisted
8728080	8730080	Joy he gets out of killing pirates
8730640	8732640	Oh my god
8733280	8740480	And then here's here's another good one for you when he's actually going to uh the the window of the darlings where windy
8741280	8742400	john
8742400	8744000	and
8744000	8746640	Windy john and never got the other one
8747360	8750800	I forget him too. Anyways, michael there it is. Yeah michael
8751680	8757120	So when when he goes to that window, he's been there a few times because he loves listening to windy tales stories
8757680	8763200	But there's not an opportunity for him to kind of slip in and steal the children because they're perfectly happy
8763200	8765040	They have no reason to run away from home
8765040	8772320	Yep, until like that night when the father's fed up because a dog shouldn't be a nanny that don't don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise
8772320	8777840	I would make a great nanny. I am a dog. She would be a great nanny. I will watch I will watch your children for you
8778080	8780320	Yeah, and then I'll take a nap. Yep
8781680	8784240	So anyways, peter pan sneaks into the house, right? Yeah
8784240	8787520	Yeah, yeah, yeah because because his shadow gets away from him anyways
8788080	8790400	So that's like the reason why he goes in. Yeah
8791360	8795600	Yeah, so he goes in wendy's like, oh my god. There's a boy in my room
8796960	8798640	Peter pans like
8798640	8801520	Well, yeah, but i'm here for my shadow. Oh
8802080	8803200	well
8803200	8809120	I can help you stick it back because he was trying to stick his shadow back on with soap at first because you know soap's kind of sticky
8809120	8813200	So yeah, a little bit sticky. It's not that smart. He's not that smart because it also can be slippery
8813920	8816720	Yeah, and so she's like, I'll just sew it on for you
8816880	8820800	And of course wendy's getting fresh because she's about to hit that puberty streak and she's like
8821360	8823840	I'll give you a kiss and he's like, okay
8824240	8828560	And she and he's like hold out his hand. She gives him a thimble, of course, and you know, but
8829440	8833680	Then she's like, okay, then I'll give you a thimble and she's she's about the plant one on him
8833840	8840560	Of course and then tinker bell a little the little demon that that stole peter pan away. She is fey. She is fey
8841120	8843280	He is fey. So is peter pan a changeling?
8844400	8848080	Peter pan would be a changeling because he was human and then he was
8848480	8852480	Abducted by fairies because he ran away from his parents when he was still a baby
8852880	8859040	Because they were they were talking his future way too early above him. Yeah, like that's how you give a baby anxiety
8859360	8861520	Oh, we'll visit the finest schools
8862240	8863840	Yardsdale
8863840	8869680	Princeton and he'll join his father in the courts and it's like, ah, he just couldn't handle that
8870320	8872320	Yeah, so
8872800	8877680	He goes to neverland. He grows up there. He develops his own sort of magic because yeah, peter pan doesn't need
8878640	8880800	Yeah, peter pan doesn't need fairy dust
8881360	8884640	To like fly he makes his own now because he's imbued with magic
8884800	8889680	Yeah, because he's been there for so long since like right only happens when you're young. I bet
8890400	8892800	Huh, that's really interesting then because like why didn't
8893920	8895680	some of the kids
8895680	8897280	get the same
8897280	8899280	ability as him
8899280	8902480	Because they're always changing out because they always grow up
8903760	8905760	What stops him from growing up?
8906160	8907040	well
8907040	8909040	Because he was the first
8910320	8915600	He and neverland are kind of tied together now neverland's attached to him. He's attached to neverland
8915840	8920480	That's why whenever he leaves neverland if it's frozen over. It's cold. It's dead
8920960	8925280	And then when he returns the sun is back. It's warm. It's summer. You do fun stuff
8925280	8927920	I can't live without him and he can't live without neverland
8928640	8930160	Right
8930160	8932160	Fascinating
8932240	8935040	So anyway peter pan is in the same
8935680	8939760	Like breath like mary poppins in that he
8940480	8946320	He doesn't really help children, but he steals children. Yeah, he's an entity that just does things on us on win
8947120	8949120	right and mary poppins is like
8950560	8953680	The one who comes to you for when she needs to eat
8954800	8956400	mm
8956400	8959920	Whereas with nanny mcfee nanny mcfee is just selfish
8961440	8964640	I used to love nanny mcfee that movie was so I love that movie
8965280	8967280	I love nanny mcfee nanny mcfee is
8967920	8972640	Like the saw the opposite side of mary poppins. Yes, just like more
8973920	8975920	hardcore
8977520	8983600	She she's like she's like when mary poppins fails to get the job done. She's the boot camp of equivalent of mary
8983600	8985200	Yeah
8985200	8987200	but she's not like
8987920	8989920	I wouldn't say she's a demon
8990640	8992880	No, she's not I would say just she's like a witch
8993680	9000160	Yeah, she's like a cursed hag. Yeah just gets off on like the more you hate me the longer I'll stay
9000560	9003680	Yeah, but when you want me I'll go away
9004480	9006480	It's like damn. Okay
9007360	9009360	Yeah, it's like it's and that's how you know
9010080	9012640	Because that's how witches are like a riddly like that
9013600	9015600	Yeah, yeah
9015600	9017600	Peter Pan is an s of scp
9021040	9024000	Yeah, I don't remember a lot of the nanny mcfee movie the second one
9024800	9029760	I don't remember the second one either, but I feel like it's not attached to the first one really
9031360	9033360	Oh, wait, really
9033360	9036960	It's a really good point. No, I'm going back to Peter Pan
9037280	9040800	Neverland takes the time from the children that he brings and gives it to Peter Pan
9041680	9047760	That would make a million dollars worth of cents. Mm-hmm. He's stealing time from them
9049600	9051600	Boy Robin Williams version
9052320	9060080	Oh, I do love the Robin Williams version. Yeah, where he goes back like because like even in the storybook like the original
9060800	9065120	M.M. Berry Peter Pan storybook, which by the way fun fact about Peter Pan
9065360	9067360	It is not actually public domain
9067760	9074400	Any money that you make off of Peter Pan should go to the children's hospital because the rights are owned by a children's hospital
9074480	9076480	That's really cool
9076480	9082080	But a lot of people don't listen and do that. So, you know, it's kind of a hand wash at this point
9082640	9083760	but
9083760	9085760	I digress
9087360	9089360	I digress uh my point being
9090400	9092640	So with Peter Pan. Mm-hmm
9093440	9095760	Wait, hold on. What was I saying?
9096960	9099360	Oh, hook. Yeah, we were talking about hook
9099600	9102800	So it's really interesting because Peter Pan actually in the book
9103280	9107040	Takes Wendy's daughter Jane with her kind of like how
9107680	9112080	When Disney made Return to Neverland the sequel that does introduce you to the fact that
9112480	9115840	Wendy grows up and has a daughter named Jane. Yeah, you know in a son
9116320	9119360	and so he actually does take Jane to
9120320	9123760	Like Neverland and she becomes the very first quote-unquote lost girl
9123920	9128320	But when hook happens we we pass over Jane and we meet Moira
9130720	9132000	Who is
9132000	9136160	Wendy's great granddaughter and Peter is just so enamored with love
9136240	9139760	He's like, I don't want to go back because he now has something
9140320	9142320	to stay for
9143920	9147440	It's kind of weird he just like goes after one daughter after the other
9148400	9153360	Well, because he wants to keep the bloodline coming to Neverland because they're great storytellers apparently
9153600	9158880	Yeah, but like when he when he finds that one and it gets like I I love using this the zing
9159520	9161280	the zing
9161280	9163760	You know the hotel Transylvania zing
9164640	9171760	Um, he's just like, yeah, no, I'm staying and then of course in in the hook timeline. It just goes all awry
9172240	9173360	Hmm
9173360	9179840	Now I will say my favorite rendition of peter pan is the live action peter pan that came out in like 2000
9180400	9183200	With that one boy jeremy with the focus aim is
9183760	9186560	Yeah, and the hot in the hot rendition of yeah
9187600	9189600	Yes, I like had this really weird like
9190000	9195520	Romantic subplot between captain hook and wendy where captain hook was kind of oh wait. Do you mean the more recent one?
9196400	9202000	Um, no not pan because pan was dog stockwater. I didn't even watch that one
9202960	9209760	I have to it was it. Yeah, it's one of jeremy's something. Um, it would have been peter pan from 2003
9212080	9217760	Yes, yes. Oh, yeah, wait. Oh, yeah, jason eyes explain captain hook
9218480	9221120	And he was hot. Yeah, that's so true
9221120	9226960	And like honestly if if I were to put together like a peter pan watch along
9227120	9230560	I would show that peter pan from 2003 followed by hook
9231760	9238480	So true because that would be the best way to watch it because you kind of get like this nice fun story where it's like
9238560	9240560	Oh, okay, you get a really
9240640	9244400	Book accurate peter pan and then you get like fan fiction that is hook
9244480	9251920	Sorry, I'm staring at pictures of the movie because I'm like my memory is being jogged
9252480	9254000	I'm like, wow
9254000	9256160	I love that. I do believe mr.
9257120	9260080	Mr. Smee was always played by
9260800	9262640	Yes, me
9262640	9266400	Let's see. Mr. Smee was always played by um, um, um
9267440	9273120	Uh, oh man. The name is the main the name is uh escaping me. I have no idea
9273120	9279120	Uh, he was he was eddie valiant in who frank roger rabbit. Oh
9280000	9282000	You're right. Oh my god
9283520	9284640	It's just
9284640	9291280	He he plays a really good schnee. He does. You're not that's so and mario. You're right. Oh my god
9291280	9294800	He's also mario on the live action mario the first one
9295600	9299760	Oh, that one was so goofy drunk off his drunk off his ass. Yeah, essentially
9300720	9308960	But I don't think he placed me in the 2003 peter pan. I think he's gone by then. Yeah, I don't think he did. Um
9309840	9315200	Peter being the grim reaper neverland is the afterlife in a shadow was a demon following him
9316720	9318720	Interesting theory
9319760	9325520	Oh, uh to answer miss morgan, I've seen twisted the musical but miss shabby doesn't like musical
9325840	9327840	I don't like musicals
9330160	9332000	Yes, please do tell me
9332000	9338320	Okay, so twisted is basically like a retelling of a laden, but it focuses on jafar more than it does a laden
9340000	9345840	Really, it's actually a very good musical. I highly recommend it and I know you hate musicals
9345920	9347920	I know you do but
9348000	9352240	It's star kid musicals are a are a are a fish of a different color
9352480	9355760	Like they are rainbow fish to me. Well, explain the plot to me
9356560	9358560	Okay elaborate further
9358880	9360880	so if you can't imagine
9360960	9363920	twisted takes place towards the beginning of
9364720	9366480	a laden essentially
9366480	9372240	But instead of jafar like being an asshole like he is in the original movie jafar is actually this well meaning
9372720	9374720	royal vizier who just wants to do
9375600	9380560	Good things for the kingdom, but everyone thinks that everything is his fault because he is the royal vizier
9380960	9387680	But he's taking up the mantle after a bunch of corrupt royal viziers who only believe in the golden rule that is
9388800	9390800	get paid
9391520	9393520	whereas jafar uh
9394160	9400880	Is more on the side of do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Okay interesting
9401920	9409200	Everyone is a is a bastardization of themselves including the princess who doesn't have a name. She just goes by princess. That's funny
9410160	9413280	You have captain of the guard who's really funny. He has
9415120	9418880	Um, you have a laden who is a 32 year old man
9421680	9428240	Who they make him really creepy and he just he's an asshole. He steals everything. Oh, I need to I need to look up pictures of
9429680	9431200	Yes
9431200	9437120	And honestly the acting is really good. I would love to just sit down and watch this with you
9439840	9443200	And you also find out the jafar had a loving wife who he loved
9443760	9449200	Based off of charizard. You know the uh story teller of a thousand and one
9449920	9450640	night
9450640	9456240	Sorry, I'm looking at the cast pictures and this is goofy. Wait, is this supposed is this right by the same person who wrote wicked?
9457280	9461200	Not wicked. No because it looks they have the same exact
9462160	9463520	like
9463520	9468000	Cover it's sort of a it's sort of a play on wicked whereas wicked. I do like wicked
9468080	9470320	I did watch wicked wicked. It's like the only musical way
9471280	9473280	And lion king was very good
9473440	9475920	Uh, then I think you would absolutely adore
9476720	9480080	Twisted all right. I might have we might have to watch that together then
9481120	9488320	Yes, and it's on youtube like the whole thing. Oh sick. Okay, perfect because star kid always puts their musicals on youtube
9489200	9490400	All right
9490400	9497040	I might be able to stomach a musical because the plot is very intriguing and again. I do like cool twists on
9498480	9502880	Already told stories like that. So I really liked wicked for the reason. I can't wait for the wicked movie to come out
9503680	9506320	also a really good thing about uh
9507360	9512320	About twisted is you know how in Aladdin like the movie Aladdin like the cartoon
9512720	9517040	there's like that prince who's like a throwaway gag where he goes to meet the princess and
9517760	9523680	Jasmine sticks her tiger upon him and yeah, and all you remember is like he has funny boxers and he's just storming back to
9523760	9525920	Oh, yeah, because it frips his pants off. Yeah
9526800	9530480	He actually is a character a likeable character with a likeable song
9531840	9537120	They give him a whole like it's so funny when like sometimes uh spin-offs like elaborate
9537280	9540640	Unusually like throw away at like NPC like characters
9541200	9543360	It's then they give him some backstory. I love that
9544960	9546960	Oh my god
9547520	9552240	He's a huge plot point and twisted. I don't know so many of you guys like musicals
9552880	9554880	I
9554880	9560000	Love musicals. Oh my my my audience likes musicals too. Apparently. I'm very surprised
9560560	9564000	I can I can introduce you to some that you might actually like
9566720	9567920	Oh like
9567920	9572320	I don't know if I don't know if you've ever given it a try but uh, I'll give Roger and
9572720	9577600	Roger and Hammerstein Cinderella with brandy and Whitney Houston's pretty good. Oh
9578320	9581280	Don't even get me. I had that movie on
9582400	9584400	I loved that movie
9586000	9588000	I love brandy cinderella
9588720	9590720	Oh my god
9591120	9594720	Of course, I'm a I'm a black girl. How could I not like this?
9599840	9601840	So good
9602480	9605040	Oh my god, I forgot that that was technically a musical
9605600	9609120	I think I didn't mind them as much when I was a kid now. I'm just like I'm irritated
9609120	9616400	I had I had I had my boss described to her co to her grandson because we went to go see wonka during christmas
9616800	9623520	That a musical is just a movie where the dialogue turns cursive sometimes the dialogue turns cursive
9623840	9626480	Okay, I have seen descendants. I won't lie. I have watched
9627840	9629840	I think two of the descendants movies
9630560	9636080	I know that a christian chenna with is in one and she's got a bomb musical number that I really like
9637040	9639040	I think there's a third one
9639360	9643200	I know that they're coming out with an alice in wonderland one, but I've never seen them
9644320	9645680	interesting
9645680	9650960	Mm-hmm. I've also never actually watched high school musical because it was so advertised so heavily
9651040	9655520	I was just like I ain't watching this. I liked high school musical. Okay. Maybe I did like musicals
9657120	9661840	I was like, uh, and I said I didn't watch a lot of musicals. Oh, yeah. I know I liked high school musical
9662560	9664480	I pretended to hate it
9664480	9666480	But I secretly liked it
9666560	9668560	I really like get your head in the game
9669760	9673280	I remember trying to do the and that and we're all in this together the choreography. Oh
9674000	9675200	I hate myself for that
9675200	9679840	My only my only regret is I got on the glee train too late
9680560	9684480	I don't like glee though. I tried watching glee my parents liked glee a lot
9685200	9688480	I don't blame you for not liking glee though because it's like digrassy
9689440	9691440	Yeah
9692400	9694960	That's a good grassy hilarious
9696240	9698560	I don't I haven't watched a grassy in the longest time
9699200	9701200	I I'm wondering how it aged
9702000	9708080	You should do you should do a watch along the watch along the grassy watch and this drake in a wheelchair just hanging out
9708880	9711200	um, I mean, I'd rather watch misfits
9712320	9714320	or freaks and geeks
9714560	9716160	um
9716160	9717360	I don't
9717360	9719280	Have you ever seen freaks and geeks freaks and geeks?
9719920	9721920	No, I don't think I've ever seen freaks
9723520	9729920	You would love freaks and geeks son. Oh my god. I think probably with seth rogan and
9730800	9732800	His friend that always does james franco
9735520	9736800	I think
9736800	9740960	Maybe I might like it because I did like uh, the whitest kids, you know
9742800	9747280	You would okay. You definitely like it. You definitely will either it's like it's so goofy
9748080	9752000	We love goofy and then you also have um, oh, what's her name?
9754160	9756000	I always forget her name
9756000	9763040	Her funny name goofy is canonically the only disney character that has had sex. I yeah, he
9763600	9765200	Goofy gets it
9765200	9767680	Yeah, he can he can get it. Yes
9768640	9770880	I forget like he's got a son. Yeah
9771840	9777200	Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I misspoke pete also has had relations more than relations
9778640	9781360	Well, yeah, he has a smoking hot wife named peg
9782160	9783040	True
9783040	9789760	That's right. Actually a beautiful daughter. He has two children. All right, so I guess only the dogs can reproduce in this
9790800	9792800	Well pizza cat
9792800	9794320	Pizza cat
9794320	9795840	Yeah pizza cat
9795840	9797360	What?
9797360	9800720	Yep, he has pistol. He has peg. He has pj
9803840	9808880	Egg like pete it's a cat. That's why he hates mickey mouse so much, but he's super chill with goofy
9813360	9815360	My life is a lie
9815680	9818560	I had no idea. I thought he was just a short-eared dog
9819280	9821280	Not either cat
9821760	9825600	Pistol pete is the youngest daughter of pete and peg that appeared in goof troop
9826480	9828480	Mm-hmm
9828800	9830800	It's funny because
9830800	9834880	In the series max is 11 and a half years old moves his father and their cat waffles
9834960	9837520	So it's like they own a cat and there's cat people
9838640	9843440	Well, to be fair pete had a dog and it was like a real bougie dog
9844480	9846480	Oh, I remember this from goof troop. Yeah
9847440	9851040	His voice by Nancy Cartwright. Oh, yeah, who boys Bart Simpson
9851840	9854720	Yep, she's been in the industry a lot. Yeah
9855760	9860480	I've been watching um game grumps play like the putt putt and she voiced in some of the
9861200	9862080	the
9862080	9864080	Super ever going it's called
9864720	9866800	Whatever company that made those games
9867600	9869600	Super humongous. Yeah
9870240	9873600	Yeah, I'm just like man. I never played any of these games. I kind of wish I did
9874320	9879040	My favorite putt putt is putt putt saves the zoo. Putt putt saves the zoo. I remember watching them play that
9879680	9881680	It's pretty goofy. Um
9882240	9884240	Yeah, I think I think it was before my time
9884560	9886560	the putt putt games
9887600	9890720	I think they're on sale on the steam sale now. That'll be funny to play
9892640	9895360	I I kind of want to play pajama sam though
9896080	9898880	Pajama sam. Oh, yeah, I watched game of play pajama sam
9899760	9901760	Or that was that was good too
9901760	9904400	there's like really cute point and click adventures and
9906000	9909760	I think actually maybe I'll recommend mercy to play one of those because mercy has gets motion sick
9909760	9913200	And so I think she would probably appreciate kind of a cutesy goofy
9914240	9915360	point click
9915360	9917360	Maybe she's already played one
9918400	9920720	Maybe or she might like monkey island
9921360	9923200	What's monkey island?
9923200	9925760	Monkey island is like a pirate
9926320	9929280	adventure sort of like point and click adventure
9929600	9931600	But I don't know too much about it
9932080	9935120	But I but people are always recommending to play it
9935520	9941200	Maybe if she played that because then she would can wear her little eye patch and then she can cosplay as a little pirate
9941840	9942400	Yeah, yeah
9942400	9948080	She usually cosplays as the characters in the games that she plays like she was mario the other day and now we call her mercy
9948240	9950240	Oh, it was very funny
9950880	9956480	By madame you're 56. That's true. So it was it was after my time actually
9957200	9959200	This the super humongous games
9960720	9961840	Oh
9961920	9965200	All right, P. But now you can play them with your computer. Yeah
9966960	9969600	I was too poor as a child to afford them before
9970720	9972560	back when I was
9972560	9974800	Born in 19 fort. That's not
9975920	9978960	I don't know. I can't I can't really math. So like can I
9980560	9984720	I like how misdreavus is just in between us this entire time during this conversation
9985600	9991440	I know just like minding her own business. She's in her own lane. Yeah. She's hanging out
9992800	9994800	Oh
9994800	9996800	All right
9996800	9998800	That was a good tangent for 40 minutes
10000080	10002080	My dad
10002240	10008000	No, please don't ever don't ever apologize. Literally. I I told you I was streaming till like 4 a.m. Yes
10008880	10010480	today technically
10010480	10013600	Because I was just going on tangents just talking about absolutely nothing
10015200	10019600	Oh my god, this is great. I also just like getting lore like
10020560	10023360	TV lore from you and cartoon lore
10024160	10029200	Man, I I can go off on like any sort of cartoon without trying
10030000	10032880	My favorite though has been like pebble and the penguin
10033040	10037440	But I won't get you started because we'll be here for two hours. Did she just start watching that?
10038240	10040240	I I watch it every week
10045760	10048880	Sorry, I like it's funny watching my muppet bounce
10050080	10054320	Also, my favorite thing to say right now is rest in peace martin short
10055200	10057680	Is he dead? Yeah, I'm like, no, he's dead
10058400	10061920	No, he's not dead, but it's past his bedtime and I'm hope he's sleeping. Well
10064880	10066880	I hope if you're sleeping well
10067680	10070320	I hope you're sleeping. Well, mr. Martin short. I love you
10074640	10078720	Uh great comedian him and uh, I love him and
10079600	10081600	What's his face?
10082320	10084320	They're always it together in something
10085120	10090240	Oh my god, I'm gonna they're literally in no murder no murders in the building together
10091200	10093200	Uh
10093520	10096400	It can't be Andy dick everybody. No, it's not any dick
10098240	10102160	Everybody hates Andy dick. Oh my god. I'm gonna I'm just gonna look up
10102800	10108240	Because I I like martin short, I even liked him in that
10109200	10111200	Steve martin. Thank you
10111360	10113360	Steve martin so funny
10113600	10119840	Yes, I liked I liked martin short in that terrible dorthy returns movie. That was like basically
10120800	10123280	The producer's live action in real life
10125360	10127360	If you don't know what the producers is about
10127680	10132560	Which is a musical by the way, but it was like a movie that is called a musical before it was a musical
10133040	10135040	it's basically about like
10135040	10143280	Uh an accountant and a producer getting together and the accountant's like hey your books are wrong and the producer's like look man
10143600	10149440	I'm on hard times. Can't you just move a few decimals and then the accountant's like, you know,
10150080	10153680	You know, you could make more money with a flop than with a hit
10154400	10159840	Because if you make a flop, you don't have to pay back what you spent on the flop
10159920	10164480	Which is like what a lot of a lot of uh hollywood companies do
10165200	10171760	Right now where if they considered like a form of media a flop, they'll write it off for taxes and they can't like
10172480	10174480	Make that's so stupid
10174720	10177920	It is it's how we get a lot of lost media and I hate it. Damn
10179280	10181280	Damn them
10181520	10183520	Someone's asking where your clothes are at
10184400	10185920	I'm a dog
10185920	10188320	I'm wearing a collar. That's my clothes. Yeah
10189280	10191280	She's clothes. She's wearing her collar
10191600	10193600	Let's think about me where your clothes at
10195440	10197680	I'm like the dog like walks into a room
10198720	10200560	Oh
10200560	10206880	Like you don't go around looking at like family guy wondering like man. Why isn't brian wearing a shirt? That's a good point
10207360	10211200	I'm only wearing clothes because my bunny boobies are very large
10212320	10214720	And that's I just don't think it's the proper thing to do
10215600	10221680	Obviously, you're very talented. That's why you have clothes. Yeah, although I wonder if I took my bra off
10222960	10224960	Would I just have velvet?
10225280	10226320	Hmm
10226320	10232640	You know, I imagine maybe I had considered giving you a muppet nipples, but we didn't do it
10233040	10235280	Yeah, the other art you gave me muppet nipples
10236240	10238880	Well, yeah, but that was for a comedy. Yeah
10240800	10241920	So, I mean I'm
10241920	10245680	Because you don't have any nipples. That means I don't have any nipples. We're just nipple monopolist
10246800	10252160	Like if I had like legs like if you sewed me up and you like made me like a full body muppet
10252560	10254720	I probably have I probably have mupples
10255760	10257920	Yeah, I kind of lower down on your belly. Yeah
10259040	10263280	Yeah, like especially in this form, but who knows who knows if it's between like two
10264080	10266880	Four and six who knows we'll roll a dice when we get there
10268000	10270000	roll for mupples
10270160	10272160	Roll for mupples one d6
10272720	10275600	No muppet milk. Uh, sorry. No, I don't think
10277600	10279600	I don't have organs
10279760	10283520	We yeah, we don't have well you could pour milk on us and suck it out like
10284880	10287200	Like a security blanket sort of thing. Yeah
10288480	10290480	Like use my little muppet
10291200	10293200	Booby is a security blanket
10293440	10295440	Yeah, I was a little passy
10295680	10299760	Yeah, just pour a little milk on her and then just suck it out. Yeah, see that works
10300400	10303840	Yeah, it's kind of like what people do with their hoodie strings like delicious
10306960	10311360	Honestly hoodie strings are quite delicious. I will honey, especially when their agla is just like just right
10312160	10316720	Oh, I know what you're talking about and I 100% agree and like chewing on that
10317680	10321840	And and like getting the knot undone and then redoing it later. Hmm
10325280	10331200	They don't get it. This is why we're on the short bus and uh, the magic school bus
10333280	10336800	We don't understand the science and miss frizzle just keeps us there. Yeah
10340480	10345920	Okay, they don't have organs we can go as deep as we want without worry of wrecking you can still rip us
10347280	10350480	Well, yeah, but we could be sewn back up. Yeah, we could be sewn back up
10351680	10355840	So I guess like as long as we're forever it immortal in the muppet form
10356160	10361360	It it could get as violent as possible. But like cleaning ourselves would be kind of frustrating
10362160	10364240	Do you think they would just throw us in the washing machine?
10365200	10367280	No, we don't need to breathe. So I think that would work out
10368000	10371120	Yeah, but I'm gonna request goggles and
10371760	10376640	Because I can't see underwater neither can I I didn't know that people can normally see underwater
10377280	10383760	I didn't know that either. It's it makes my eyes all stingy. I know it hurts my eyes real bad even if it's in like a normal clear
10384800	10387760	Water thing. I thought nobody could see underwater
10388560	10389760	Same
10389760	10391760	Apparently, it just means I'm blind
10392080	10397440	Do you also hate getting water up your nose? Yes, it burns. I I hate water on my nose
10398400	10399680	So bad
10399680	10403360	Like you take a washcloth and you dip it in like the shower water and then you wipe your face
10403360	10406720	You don't go like full face into the water. No, exactly
10407680	10409680	I get you. I'm good on that
10411360	10413360	Or like I like plug my nose
10415760	10418000	Plug your nose close your eyes and just a quick
10419200	10422720	And then that you're out. Yeah, just like what's that? I saw that animation
10424720	10428160	Oh, wait, it's yeah, what's when the dwarves from snow white are washing their face
10429120	10430880	God that meant that that scene makes me
10431280	10433280	Irrationally angry. Why?
10434080	10437760	Because I would try to do it and that's how I learned that I hate what getting water up my nose
10439040	10441040	You do grab a dub is up and
10443280	10450320	And and then the fact that oh man, I'm going to go off on another tangent grumpy was absolutely right the clocks
10450400	10452400	Though white as a fucking trifle
10453120	10455120	Because
10455440	10456640	Because
10456640	10461440	Like I don't blame grumpy for being a woman hater. She brought a lot of trouble. Yeah
10461680	10466160	They were just chilling and she did just like barge on right in do everything
10467040	10469040	And she brought a witch
10469040	10474640	Like if somebody came into my personal space and cleaned up everything my organized chaos
10474720	10476320	I'd be so upset
10476320	10478640	And then like you hear the distress. It's like
10479360	10484400	Somebody washed my cup sugar is gone. It takes time to develop a sugar crust
10486080	10488560	It takes time that bitch cleaned his cup
10489120	10493840	And you know, she probably didn't clean it properly. She had the animals do it and they probably licked that
10494000	10500880	Oh, yeah, it's all it's not even properly cleaned. It's it's even technically dirtier than when she they how they left it
10502080	10503760	Oh
10503760	10505760	gross
10506240	10510720	And then she had the nerve to shame them. It's like did you wash your hands before supper?
10511200	10516400	Bitch, you're in their house. How are you gonna make the man? I know she just comes in all high and mighty
10517360	10520160	Like princesses, man. She wasn't I am I am
10521200	10527760	I have come up with the opinion that snow white is not just a movie about a princess who's evil stepmother
10528240	10534020	Like once her dead it is about two doms in a kingdom fighting for supremacy
10536000	10538800	Because so light is a developing dom
10539280	10541280	And she's those little men
10541600	10548400	Yes, the queen is a developed dom and she doms the kingdom. Yeah, she does this for beauty and her power
10548720	10556720	But like at the same time she's like, oh no an up-and-coming bitch and that up-and-coming bitch is using her powers
10556880	10558080	Yeah
10558080	10563680	Unbeknownst to anybody to get things done the way she wants. She domps the forest. Oh my god
10564480	10566480	She doms the little men
10566640	10572240	And she basically doms the heart of the prince who's just kind of waltzes into her. I know he just like shows up
10572320	10573760	That's kind of weird
10573760	10575840	When she's singing and he just shows up. They're all weird
10576560	10579760	I think the queen is the only in the dwarf is the only rational ones here
10580480	10581840	right
10581840	10583680	damn
10583680	10585680	But yeah, that's how I fell about snow white
10585680	10587680	Hahaha
10589520	10596160	Snow white being a soft dom actually makes sense and she's around 14. Oh, I forgot how young she was
10596960	10600480	It's just she be no. No. No. I'm not snow white
10601600	10603440	I'm not snow white either
10603440	10606000	I was about to start singing wishing well
10607920	10609920	I'm wishing
10610640	10612640	I'm wishing
10613600	10615600	For the one I love
10617200	10622480	I thought we're gonna do it for a moment. Oh, yeah, but it's always to find me
10623520	10625520	to find
10626400	10628400	Today
10630640	10637440	Now that I found you here's what I have to say
10637520	10639520	Hey
10639840	10645680	And then he just goes in for it and she's like, oh my god, damn just like that
10648160	10653200	Jesus oh my god, I think I got the vapors the vapors
10657200	10659200	Oh
10659520	10663760	No, she'd be just Jessica Ravis says has to help her out the laundry she
10664720	10672240	Uh goes from soft on snow white and everything to mean like yeah, so I think about snow white so casually
10672800	10674800	okay, yes, but um
10674880	10676240	in short
10676240	10679680	If you do use our Muppet bodies for your gooning purposes
10680800	10683920	You have to make sure that you either align us with something
10684560	10687840	Or clean us properly because that just isn't fair to us, you know
10688640	10691760	Right, don't just throw a rag at us and call it a day
10692160	10697440	You know, we're not proper aftercare. Yeah, don't use us as a rag
10700000	10703680	Oh, no, I just realized I never told you my ratatouille theories
10706720	10709200	And we'll save that for the next episode
10711840	10714320	Next time on tracking balls
10718800	10720800	All right, I'm gonna go to bed
10722720	10726000	You'll have to you guys will have to find out in the next episode of smash your pass
