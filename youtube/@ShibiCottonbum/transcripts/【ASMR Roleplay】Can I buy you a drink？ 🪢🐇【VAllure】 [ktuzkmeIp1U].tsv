505140	506140	Okay.
506140	507140	Hello, darlings.
507140	508140	Headphones are maxed.
508140	528140	Anyone as you go says you can't do me.
528140	529140	Okay.
529140	534140	Listen, I'm doing the post down here.
534140	544140	A little different because if you have a certain type of headphones, it may not work.
544140	554140	Alright, I'm on my keyboard.
554140	558140	I'm picking up the 3DO.
558140	559140	Okay.
559140	577140	I don't really care because I think this would be really funny.
577140	588140	It was really fun messing around with the settings on the VTube studio.
588140	594140	My neighbors are walking by and they're being very loud.
594140	597140	Good luck on your exam.
597140	604140	Alright, so I thank you.
604140	608140	Thank you for meeting me at the bar.
608140	621140	I'm happy that you followed directions in my Tinder message that I sent to you.
621140	630140	Because I sent you directions to this bar, don't worry that there's nobody else here.
630140	637140	I especially reserved it for the both of us.
637140	647140	I hope you don't mind what I don't know what a big bumping up is.
647140	654140	I generally don't know why it's doing that.
654140	659140	It's a big bar, but don't worry about anyone else.
659140	663140	It's just me and you.
663140	665140	I'm not rich.
665140	670140	Why do you think I'm bartending behind this bar right now?
670140	675140	I'm sorry I had to burp, but I didn't want to burp in your ear.
675140	677140	Unless you want me to.
677140	682140	But I'll be a professional madam for you tonight.
682140	690140	So my darling, what would you like to drink?
690140	694140	I can make you something.
694140	704140	If you're under the age of drinking, I can also make you a mocktail if you'd like.
704140	706140	I've been studying.
706140	708140	I'm going to forgive you a little bit.
708140	712140	I don't know, Mike.
712140	715140	You want chalky milk?
715140	717140	I can make you chalky milk.
717140	722140	I almost went out and bought Vanta because I realized I had an advantage in a decade.
722140	725140	Madam, your neck, don't worry about my neck.
725140	727140	I still got that, though.
727140	732140	And don't you forget it.
732140	735140	So you'd like some cold water.
735140	741140	You'd like dark coke, bloody Mary, strawberry milk.
741140	745140	So no head.
745140	749140	You'd like a bloody Mary, non-alcoholic.
749140	750140	Okay.
750140	756140	I have some lemonade and I have strawberry milk.
756140	757140	Get out of here.
757140	758140	I love oil.
758140	762140	What is wrong with you people?
762140	763140	Coke milk?
763140	764140	Yes.
764140	765140	I am milking.
765140	770140	Is there a buyer in the bar?
770140	771140	A shipping aid?
771140	774140	Yes, that can be arranged.
774140	775140	A bucket of soda.
775140	776140	Got some bleach.
776140	778140	Yeah, I got some bleach.
778140	782140	I also have some ammonia as well.
782140	787140	But yeah, don't worry that there's nobody else here.
787140	789140	It's just me and you tonight.
789140	794140	Okay, I'm going to take very good, very good care of you.
794140	798140	All right, let me get some ice.
798140	800140	All right, let me get some ice.
808140	810140	Let's come right here.
810140	812140	All right, go.
839140	841140	I have some ice.
841140	842140	I have no idea.
842140	844140	I had to go to the back.
844140	846140	I had to step away for a moment.
846140	849140	In fact, I have to, hold on.
849140	851140	I have to step away.
851140	853140	I have to step away to do it.
853140	860140	Let me just, I can't part.
860140	862140	I'm trying really hard and I can't.
862140	864140	Because I know the microphone.
864140	867140	I'll pick it up.
867140	872140	But I also have some ice.
872140	874140	I have a nice setup.
874140	875140	Not long.
875140	876140	I am.
876140	878140	You know, I worked really hard.
878140	879140	I don't, hold on.
879140	880140	I'm like very tall.
880140	883140	Let me just, sorry.
883140	885140	Do you know how to share it?
885140	886140	Don't worry.
886140	888140	I run very fine establishments.
888140	891140	This is a bar within Wonderland Hotel.
891140	896140	So, one long island ice tea.
896140	898140	All right.
898140	900140	Coming right up, you know.
900140	903140	No one would want to like about ice though.
903140	905140	I like about ice.
921140	939140	Wow, that was like really, my teeth are sensitive.
939140	942140	I just, I live, I live dangerously.
942140	945140	I live very dangerously.
945140	948140	I can't go over like this or that.
948140	950140	We can ask for crushed ice, oh well.
950140	952140	That's the only type of ice we serve.
952140	954140	Hold on, let me crush it again for you.
978140	987140	There, I spit it right into the glass for you.
987140	991140	So, take a sip of that.
991140	993140	What do you mean?
993140	996140	You don't, you need a drink to go with it.
996140	1000140	Okay, let me, let me pour you something then, hold on.
1008140	1023140	Okay.
1023140	1025140	My favorite ambiance is here.
1025140	1036140	It's my, it's my, my AC has made its arrival.
1037140	1051140	I'm so happy I put a towel down because it just smells drinkable.
1051140	1052140	Is it monster?
1052140	1062140	No, it's not do.
1062140	1088140	Because, you know, I got some out due because I'm going to mount it to you later.
1088140	1101140	So it's only fair.
1101140	1116140	The candle, oh god.
1116140	1131140	All right, here, let me come out from behind the bar.
1131140	1135140	Yeah, I teleported, whatever.
1135140	1155140	So, uh, the effects are really nice.
1155140	1159140	So, do you like my outfit?
1159140	1162140	Only, you know, a torso.
1162140	1165140	But do you like it?
1165140	1168140	Uh, don't mind that.
1168140	1173140	I'm not attached to my back.
1173140	1177140	Don't worry about it.
1177140	1180140	Don't worry.
1180140	1191140	I was like, so ready to be so serious.
1191140	1195140	And then I was messing around with all this stuff this morning.
1195140	1198140	And I couldn't stop laughing.
1198140	1217140	I don't know why my fingers break.
1217140	1224140	There we go.
1224140	1238140	Does that work for you?
1238140	1244140	Do not be afraid.
1244140	1247140	You are safe with me, my dear.
1247140	1251140	My cat is climbing on my monitor.
1251140	1258140	Hold on.
1258140	1267140	My love, my god, please get down.
1267140	1270140	Don't worry about it.
1270140	1273140	Okay.
1273140	1278140	She's like, was that only climbing over everything?
1278140	1300140	You guys like me, like, is this okay with you?
1300140	1307140	Like, what sucks is that when I turn to the side, it just disconnects.
1307140	1310140	Don't use it.
1310140	1323140	Okay.
1323140	1331140	I got a new cup, and it's like textured.
1331140	1336140	I'm very happy with it.
1336140	1344140	It makes really nice taps.
1344140	1356140	Do you want to sip out of my cup?
1356140	1364140	I'll give you a little taste, but only if you behave.
1364140	1366140	What do I have in my cup?
1366140	1372140	It's just tea.
1372140	1381140	It's just green tea in here, but I'm going to make myself a drink in a moment.
1381140	1386140	I'm going to show you tea.
1386140	1410140	I'll crouch over you when you can open your mouth.
1410140	1436140	Okay, if you say shippity toilet, I'm literally going to sick of my mods on you.
1436140	1448140	I swear to God.
1448140	1452140	We're not 12, and if you are 12, well, fuck are you here?
1452140	1479140	Get the fuck out of here, you little bitch.
1479140	1483140	I hope that you're having a good day today.
1483140	1497140	Thank you for swiping right on me, on my Tinder profile.
1497140	1503140	We're going to have this nightcap, and I guess maybe, but just maybe.
1503140	1508140	Hopefully I can keep my head on my shoulders.
1508140	1517140	You can come back to my place.
1517140	1540140	I don't know German, but cool story.
1540140	1550140	My head was attached in my pictures, but sometimes you kind of get a little crazy with it.
1550140	1553140	Sometimes it's good to lose your head.
1553140	1555140	Said it would be an old woman.
1555140	1557140	His maintenance still there.
1557140	1566140	Yeah, he's died up in my closet.
1566140	1568140	Did you hear his screams?
1568140	1572140	I stuffed my panties in his mouth.
1596140	1611140	I can make you guys whimper.
1611140	1621140	Do you want me to make you whimper?
1621140	1623140	Pop the bag.
1623140	1638140	Can you bag for a moment?
1638140	1650140	Are you tingling yet?
1650140	1655140	Do you want me to make you whimper?
1655140	1663140	I can give her a really strong drink.
1663140	1692140	In fact, actually, I need to pour myself a drink before I get to work on you.
1692140	1716140	I'm a little bad at it.
1716140	1745140	I'm going to grab some peach tea from the bird.
1745140	1756140	I don't know why.
1756140	1769140	I don't want to go in.
1769140	1771140	I don't want to go in.
1771140	1800140	I don't want to go in.
1800140	1813140	So there's three steps I have to take.
1813140	1842140	First step is pouring the peach tea.
1842140	1871140	I'm going to pour the peach tea.
1871140	1885140	I hope your hands are where they should be on your desk.
1885140	1894140	No, my ass is not as superior as Strone's.
1894140	1914140	So the second step is to pour the Jack Daniels.
1914140	1931140	I hope you're being good.
1931140	1958140	I don't know what happens if you're being bad.
1958140	1987140	I don't know what happens if you're being bad.
1988140	2013140	Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
2013140	2026140	I just need to get a new candle burner.
2026140	2047140	Okay, so I'm going to get them to open up more.
2047140	2076140	I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

10997140	11026140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11027140	11032140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11057140	11085140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11085140	11111140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11111140	11134140	I don't know why I'm struggling.

11272140	11301140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11303140	11314140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11314140	11319140	My head disconnected from my body.
11319140	11329140	Do you know how long it took me to actually, because like in order to have one of these outfits on, you have to make every layer transparent.
11329140	11336140	And I didn't know how many parts of my model that there were that my rigor had to cut up and animate.
11336140	11346140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11346140	11356140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11356140	11366140	I don't know why I'm struggling.
11366140	11377140	Yeah, because like, you know, all like all the Shibari ropes on my model, on my body are all individually cut.
11377140	11384140	They're all separate pieces along with the rings and the shadows are all separated.
11384140	11390140	I was like, and then I understood why Strani paid so much money.
11390140	11402140	Like, if you know anything about live 2D and rigging, I personally would look at the file and be like, no.
11402140	11407140	It only took me like 20 minutes to make everything transparent, but like so, yeah.
11407140	11411140	Shout out to fucking Nari.
11411140	11416140	Holy shit. Yeah, Nari's got it.
11416140	11432140	Truly, I would love to learn how to rig or make model art a really cool and lucrative skill to have.
11432140	11452140	Okay.
11452140	11458140	Okay, just come down easy sweetheart.
11458140	11464140	I know that was quite a ride.
11464140	11470140	Are you okay? Do you need me to get you anything?
11470140	11476140	Here, let me help you to the bathroom.
11476140	11481140	Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?
11481140	11489140	Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?
11489140	11513140	Let me just run this nice, warm towel Oreo and wipe everything away from my darling.
11513140	11520140	Pissing all about yourself, handsome.
11520140	11528140	Oh, you're such a mess.
11528140	11534140	Oh, I've utterly destroyed you. I'm so sorry.
11534140	11539140	Oh, you would rather stand. I understand.
11539140	11546140	It might be hard for you to sit.
11546140	11562140	No shame in it.
11562140	11567140	There, you're all clean.
11567140	11578140	Did you want me to make you a bath instead?
11578140	11590140	I don't mind running you a bath.
11590140	11594140	You deserve it.
11594140	11599140	It worked so hard to clean me.
11599140	11616140	You did such a good job.
11616140	11620140	I don't know how to make running water noises.
11620140	11642140	I can't take my mic over to the sink.
11642140	11648140	Hold on, let me put my 3DO back on the stand.
11672140	11697140	I don't know.
11697140	11715140	Oh, you weren't the good boy. You were the best boy.
11715140	11728140	Just relax.
11728140	11752140	I'm going to pour some water down your back.
11752140	11765140	You have such beautiful hair.
11765140	11775140	You know, you also smell so good.
11775140	11782140	You smell like the aftermath of us.
11782140	11810140	You smell like the way it smells.
11810140	11825140	You don't even have enough water to tell you how wonderful you are.
11840140	11853140	You brought me so much pleasure.
11853140	11863140	You made me so happy.
11863140	11871140	I love you so much.
11871140	11885140	You always want what's best for me.
11885140	11907140	So let me take care of you right now.
11907140	11932140	Let me rinse your hair out my love.
11932140	11939140	I'm sorry, I don't have that much.
11939140	11951140	My supplement is just a little chat.
11951140	11959140	I'm close to being under 3K.
11959140	11986140	Hopefully after a week I know why I feel like we would have been past 5K by now.
11986140	11993140	But anyways, let me focus on you. You're all that matters to me right now.
11993140	12004140	I want to make sure that you feel safe and loved.
12004140	12014140	I have to make sure that I don't break too much.
12034140	12051140	You took it so well. You didn't break under the pressure. I'm so impressed with you.
12051140	12059140	I think you deserve a present.
12081140	12103140	You deserve the world, you know that right?
12103140	12132140	I think that means you need to be reminded more often that you are loved, that you are worth it.
12132140	12141140	That you're someone always there when you offer you love.
12141140	12152140	And that's me, because you're mine. You don't ever stop being mine.
12152140	12165140	You work so hard to please everybody, but you need to please yourself.
12165140	12180140	I want you to do something for yourself, because you deserve it.
12180140	12197140	You deserve happiness.
12197140	12209140	And I know the part of you, the part of you, takes the pain because I think that you're worth it.
12209140	12218140	You're loved. You mean so much to me.
12218140	12238140	I never feel like you have to punish yourself, all I do for pleasure.
12238140	12245140	Do you want me to tell you what I like about you?
12245140	12263140	I might never stop talking if I do.
12263140	12269140	I like how dedicated you are.
12269140	12275140	I love how warm you are.
12275140	12287140	You're so smart and intelligent and I can talk to you for hours.
12287140	12304140	You're welcome for my talk act.
12304140	12317140	I can't get my hands off of you.
12317140	12330140	Yes, you are so obedient. Another, you know, desired trait.
12330140	12335140	You need to cry then cry.
12335140	12344140	Let it out. It's not good to keep those things locked inside you.
12344140	12354140	Here, why don't you lay on my chest and just relax my thigh.
12374140	12397140	It's okay. Let it out.
12404140	12426140	Let it out.
12426140	12433140	I hope you realize how tough you are.
12433140	12438140	You can't do so much.
12438140	12448140	No matter how many times the world tries to break you.
12448140	12451140	You're still standing.
12451140	12469140	You're not going to ever forget that.
12469140	12482140	Do you want me to watch you?
12482140	12484140	Do I have you?
12484140	12488140	Yes, and I still have you.
12488140	12497140	No matter how strong you are.
12497140	12506140	Even though the world might seem harsh,
12506140	12518140	you can still find your way.
12518140	12528140	Always look like you're in somebody's happiness.
12528140	12537140	You can go and do anything you want to.
12537140	12550140	You can do anything you want to.
12550140	12558140	You may not think it. You may not have the confidence.
12558140	12569140	But that's the one thing I found out about that confidence in you.
12569140	12576140	You have accomplished so much.
12576140	12585140	What I want you to do when you go home after spending time with me.
12585140	12593140	I want you to look at the mirror and look at yourself.
12593140	12603140	I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.
12603140	12614140	I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.
12614140	12629140	I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.
12629140	12631140	You're welcome.
12631140	12636140	I know what you're doing.
12636140	12639140	I'm glad that you thought you'd do that.
12639140	12648140	A lot of the things that bother us the most are like what you think you are.
12648140	12655140	I wish you had been strong and you didn't do so well.
12655140	12663140	You want me to come in five good things about you?
12663140	12667140	Hard work there.
12667140	12672140	You get up early morning and you take home the thing you might not want to be.
12672140	12678140	Some people might be simple by getting out of bed is a hard part.
12678140	12683140	You did it?
12683140	12688140	You probably, you know, had a choice in it.
12688140	12691140	You don't really do the time.
12691140	12695140	You probably completed the time.
12695140	12699140	You did the most simple as time and got through it.
12699140	12701140	Just don't take care of it.
12701140	12713140	You're also so very loving.
12713140	12716140	This is stuff like that.
12716140	12725140	I don't think I've experienced the type of love you've shown me before.
12725140	12730140	So intense.
12730140	12742140	So powerful.
12742140	12748140	So much love to you.
12748140	12750140	There's so much love to you.
12750140	12754140	So why don't you give it to yourself?
12754140	12774140	Shhh.
12774140	12777140	That's so good.
12777140	12785140	Just like that.
12785140	12802140	Just like that.
12802140	12811140	Just like that.
12811140	12815140	Think about other things too.
12815140	12831140	You don't know me at all.
12831140	12835140	It's going to be my fault.
12835140	12838140	Your safety.
12838140	12842140	And my love.
12842140	12852140	Even if it's just for tonight.
12891140	12917140	Don't cry.
12917140	12919140	Oh my sweet, don't cry.
12919140	12921140	Oh my floating fucking head.
12921140	12923140	Laugh, laugh at my floating head.
12923140	12925140	Do it now.
12925140	12928140	Laugh away.
12928140	12934140	I want you to be happy.
12934140	12938140	Wow.
12938140	12945140	My child.
12945140	12947140	Yeah, I can do aftercare too.
12947140	12949140	I'll insult you.
12949140	12951140	You won't take care of you.
12951140	12954140	Oh, please don't.
12954140	12961140	I'm a very empathetic person.
12961140	12966140	So I get it.
12966140	12968140	I can be soft dumb.
12968140	12970140	I can be hard dumb.
12970140	12973140	I can be a goofy dumb.
12973140	12980140	Which is mostly what I am.
12980140	12983140	Look at when I go to the side.

14031120	14037640	time and oh yeah what was there I did a voice for a Zura oh speaking of what so
14037680	14044360	you know that clip from Emmys stream that she used of me like what about your cock
14044360	14052200	like oh my god my voice is cracked because I've been doing a lot of voices so that
14052200	14062720	was from I was testing my microphone for recordings I think for the game because
14062880	14068520	I didn't use the we didn't use the 3D os to record the game lines and so I was
14068520	14073160	just like fucking around and I was just like what about your cock yeah and I
14073160	14077760	would like go high and like do so she cut specifically those lines and use
14077760	14083240	because I would I would just say normal lines like oh we got to go fight these
14083240	14088520	monsters blah blah blah blah blah and then and then but then I would like
14088560	14093600	usually when I sent my line because I would send my lines to the group chat so
14093600	14097040	they could like so I could be like oh what do you guys think and then I would
14097040	14102280	usually throw in something funny at the end like for one of them oh my god I'll
14102280	14109720	just play one for you hold on let me find it because a Zura was said I sounded
14109720	14118800	like a lead character and so I recorded a league lead character lines for her
14120960	14129960	there is it well me what are you doing oh yeah I saw she said I sounded like
14129960	14136520	Timo so I recorded Timo lines for her and she was geeking out
14136840	14142840	tell them I turn this off real brief like
14145720	14154160	size doesn't mean everything never underestimate the power of the scouts
14154160	14160920	code swiftly I didn't even know the voice that I can do sounds like Timo
14160920	14175640	cuz I don't play league ow I just hit my arm so it was like really funny and I
14175640	14186560	let me see if I can find the one I set let me find the one that I am that that
14186560	14198480	came from let me see this one that's not it wait was it cuz yeah it was the it
14198480	14205400	was also like the trailer lines that we were working on for the for the for the
14205400	14212920	trailer that was a mutual no no it's not really
14212920	14223680	peachy no I don't think that sounds really peachy at all that was almost my
14223680	14234960	line for the trailer hard hard because the editor kept sending like for the
14234960	14242520	video first like when they sent in the lines my mic would always peak for the
14242520	14246880	work hard so that's why I didn't make it into the trailer cuz I'm like hard and
14246880	14251680	it just sounded like shit but first but when I play it back it sounds normal so
14251680	14263120	I'm like huh brother and they're editing that's fucking up my audio because I
14263120	14267400	really like to work hard play harder I want to hear boomy I have I have some
14267400	14275240	bloopers from me do recording some naughty stuff I'll play them for you

14677460	14681900	in the sweetest I love her to death but in the sweetest way possible sometimes
14681900	14691980	unlike she this is a Scottish ism that she's put into the script but yeah it's
14691980	14694500	a little it's a little bit of behind the scenes for you I can't find the clip
14694500	14700980	that Emmy used but it was it was pretty funny I think it was another trailer
