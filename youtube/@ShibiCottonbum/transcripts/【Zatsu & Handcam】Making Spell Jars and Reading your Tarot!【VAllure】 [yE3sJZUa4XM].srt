00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Why hi everyone hello

14
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,600
Hello, hello, hello my display I must have out I

15
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,520
I

16
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:45,120
Am so excited for the stream today. I did lots of shopping. I am very excited to show you the witchy side of myself

17
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,840
I

18
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Did some yeah, I did some shopping. I got some I got my nails done

19
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Do you like it?

20
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I can't

21
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,840
I

22
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,560
Promise you they'll look better like when I take a picture on my phone rather on this really crappy webcam

23
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,040
I promise you I promise you I promise you she did such a good job. The camera is generally just not doing it justice

24
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Um I

25
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,440
Also, it's funny because I have a purple crystal ball. Wait, will it what reflect me?

26
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,980
You can kind of see me you can't see my face though

27
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,040
So I won't I won't have the crystal ball out

28
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,000
But when I color correct, that's a good idea let me color color correct my hand

29
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Red and see what happens

30
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,360
Or is it what as I do that today

31
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,160
What the heck this is looks weird

32
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,440
About this now I'm just really pale

33
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
What if I

34
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Is that it

35
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm changing the filter on the wrong thing that is even showing let's go

36
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,240
This actually looks kind of cool, I'm not gonna lie

37
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Satinous

38
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Me

39
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
I

40
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,720
Look how great is maybe I'll turn down the saturation like a little because it actually

41
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
Kind of breathe some color into me

42
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,440
Now whatever it's very grainy though. I

43
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Don't know why it's so grainy

44
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,240
But that looks a little bit better. I

45
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Need a new webcam

46
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,520
Hello, hello, welcome in welcome in my name is

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,160
My name is she be cotton bum and today I will be

48
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Reading your tarot

49
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,880
Oh, how funny how fitting that the fool is on the bottom deck energy of the fool is the first

50
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,080
Card in the major arcana. I can't I

51
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,280
Forget where my camera placement is it's like far away for me. I should probably scooch forward. Um, so that's very funny

52
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,920
It's new beginnings. That's very very fitting. Um,

53
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Some of you may be aware

54
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,760
That I am a practitioner of the dark arts

55
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,040
Yes, I believe in the the mumbo jumbo

56
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,080
I am one of the astrology bitches if you are just kidding. I'm not really into astrology

57
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Um, but I am a spiritual practitioner. Um, it is something that I've talked about before. I'm not Wiccan

58
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not Wiccan. I will say I'm not I just say I'm just like pagan or whatever. Um

59
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,400
Wiccan Wiccan takes a lot of stuff from paganism. So it but it like Wiccan is his own thing. Um, but

60
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Yeah

61
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,200
I kind of wanted to show you this part of myself when the summer wean thing is really I've been a practitioner for uh five years

62
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,200
Um, some of you guys know I used to be a good little christian girl. That is not the case anymore

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I need to like move my

64
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Set up because I'm being pulled by my gox lr when I try to turn

65
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Um, let me turn on

66
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Desktop audio so you guys

67
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,680
Can hear do you hear double you probably hear double audio actually? Oh, why does it do that?

68
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,080
Um, oh wait, I know what to do. Ho ho ho. Duh

69
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Perfect now you guys can't hear double audio

70
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
That's too loud

71
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,600
My microphone is kind of behind me because uh, my desk is L shaped and so it's over like there

72
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,760
Um, so if I sound like I'm far away from the microphone, I apologize

73
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,400
So how does one get a terror reading done? I see I'll do one for you for free

74
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
Um, but I will be charging money

75
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
Like the filthy fake psychic I am

76
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
Um, no, I'll probably I'm kind of debating whether or not to do three or five dollars

77
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,160
Just because I know there's gonna be probably a couple people watching and I was kind of overwhelmed last time

78
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,560
um

79
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,800
But uh, I'm lighter than it

80
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm lighter than a a laden swallow. How about that? Um

81
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
But

82
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Yeah, and um, I won't lie to you. It's it's it's actually

83
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:03,680
Emotionally taxing and physically taxing to read for so many people. You're working with a lot of energies. You know, um

84
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
But let me see. I'm trying to

85
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Do I want to turn this this way a little bit? Yeah, that's better because like

86
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Cool. All right. Um

87
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
I didn't go out and buy this stuff

88
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Again, I've been a pro practitioner

89
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,680
for hi

90
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,920
Hey, I've been a practitioner for five years. My altar sits above my desk. I just put all my stuff out here

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,800
I have this is my tapestry. My friend got me. I have some selenite. I have some clear quartz

92
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
I have some labradorite

93
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
spirit quartz amethyst

94
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
obsidian

95
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
rose quartz some candles. I have a

96
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
A candle dedicated to the green man who is in

97
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,520
uh

98
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,440
Gaelic mythology folklore and belief system. I have my little my little baby cauldron

99
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Um

100
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,680
And I also have some like snuffing stuff. I have my singing bowl. Um

101
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
And I have some like you can't see it, but I well you can actually can't see it. I have some um

102
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm just spices. Well, they are spices essentially. I have some herbs over here

103
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
um

104
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
so

105
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I I ask of you

106
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
To approach this with an open mind

107
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I ask of you

108
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,720
You do not have to believe in what I'm you can just see this as a little fun party trick that I'm doing

109
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
That is totally okay

110
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,120
If you have a belief system where this is really scary for you

111
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,160
You don't have to see it as real. Don't you worry. Okay. Yes secret blend seven herbs and spices. Um

112
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
You will not go to hell

113
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,840
But if this makes you uncomfortable, I'm so sorry

114
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
But you can just see it as a little fun a little pre-holloween stuff

115
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,080
Um, I always say if you get your cards read

116
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
You can take it with a grain of salt. Um

117
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,360
You can just see it. For example, I pulled up the full which is at the bottom of the deck. This is

118
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
This is a deck I use for reading on stream because it has words so people can understand

119
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,040
Uh, when I hold up the card what it's saying, I don't know if it'll focus and my hands are shaky. Um, so the full for example

120
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,400
represents new beginnings innocence originality fearlessness free spirit fresh hope taking chances new paths

121
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Spontaneity and leap of faith

122
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,640
So you can look at this card and not be like, oh the spirits are telling me that I should be doing

123
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,280
No, you can just say, oh, maybe I should work on that project that new project that I've been putting off and putting off

124
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,960
It's time for a new beginning. You can use this as a sort of self-reflective

125
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,960
therapy

126
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,560
There's no such thing as a coincidence. If you're watching this you are

127
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
spiritually connected and aligned with my energy. Um

128
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,480
But if you're a vod watcher and you're seeing this in the future, you know what you're seeing

129
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,280
You are seeing this for a reason some of the messages and this might apply to you. Um in my past life

130
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,760
I did these a lot. My whole thing was being a an occult priestess in my pl

131
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,240
And I did a lot of terror readings and I did I did a couple spell jars and I did a lot of origins of pagan stuff because

132
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,360
And it's also part of my culture. I'm Haitian

133
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,800
uh Haitian uh voodoo is where um

134
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,600
Is voodoo is from Haiti? I can't talk uh voodoo is from Haiti. It originated as Haiti

135
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,480
It originated in Haiti in which was taken from um slaves from Africa and also mixed with the indigenous peoples

136
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
in their belief systems. Um

137
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,240
I personally don't practice voodoo because that's a little hard core for me

138
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,360
But I do acknowledge it and it is it is something I've done a lot of research on it. Um

139
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,080
But yes, voodoo is popular in New Orleans. That is very very true

140
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,560
voodoo is very popular in New Orleans because a lot of again slaves came from Haiti

141
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,000
Went to Louisiana and brought their voodoo. Um, but it did originate in Haiti, which I am um

142
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,640
Uh, very proud. It's there's a lot of culture a lot of spiritual

143
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Uh culture that was taken from Africa that ended up in Haiti. I know you're wondering like wow, you're so pale

144
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,600
How are you from Haiti? I'm sorry. It's the camera. I am black. I swear to god

145
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,520
My mom is like I'm biracial guys. My dad was born in Haiti and immigrated. I swear. I'm not just I'm not some crazy

146
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Uh girl just pretending. I'm something. I'm not I'm not

147
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,600
I didn't want to say anything. I was kind of confused that you're it's fine. You're good. Um

148
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:49,200
Um, I would love to do a a collab with emmy. Um, just so I can teach you some of the safety stuff of spiritual work. Um

149
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,640
Oh my god, my neighbors just scared the crap out of me because I heard them walk away. Um

150
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
So, uh

151
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,600
I have some amplifiers here, but I also have some protective stone. So obsidian is used for protection and grounding. Um,

152
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,280
Um

153
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:15,040
Clear quartz is used for amplifying spirit quartz. Uh, the spirit quartz is I got it from a uh rock dealer

154
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,960
And this is to kind of better help connect with the spiritual realm

155
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,360
Um, we think we did we get raided? Hi. Hi. Hi everybody. Hello. Hi. Hi. Can I

156
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640

I look so far away from the camera. We

164
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,240
Is there a spell to get sheebie to sit on my face? Uh

165
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Let me think hold on

Alakazam Alakazoo shebees now sitting on you. That's the spell. Um

167
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Thank you for the super bomb. Thank you for the super. Hold on. I need to turn my camera. So it's actually looking at me

168
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,400
Um, so I'll show you some of my spell jars I've made in the past

169
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
um

170
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
I don't think miracles is that effective?

171
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,400
So, uh, I've made a couple I've made it like I think two on stream before in my pl

172
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,400
Uh, let me pull these down. So I made a

173
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
um

174
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,760
spiritual jar and this was uh for the purpose of

175
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
manifestation and abundance

176
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,160
And I actually made this uh a week before I applied for the velar

177
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Auditions

178
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,320
Um

179
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,360
And then this one I use as a sort of overreaching kind of protection

180
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,920
um spell

181
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,440
Shiny rock suppliers are interesting a lot and just like kind of guarding and safekeeping

182
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
um kind of just

183
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
Just your

184
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Just self preservation and just good health and stuff. Um, and also a little bit of manifestation to the star and I use on top

185
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,880
um

186
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,280
pukeling raid and I also have one

187
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,640
uh

188
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,320
A love one I did for self love a little bit ago

189
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,160
I don't even know how old this is. I I had more spell jars. I don't know where they are. Um, so

190
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I and then my friend bought me one

191
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
She got it from a store

192
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,800
I have I'm like, why would you spend money on that? I could have made that myself, but you know

193
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,880
Thank you for the thought. I hate that you spent 30 dollars on a jar of stuff that I could have done

194
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,840
Um showing off my spell jars. Yes. Hi. Hello. He told me. Tell my nose. What's up. Tell my nose. What's up?

195
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
She's a she's a fellow card reader. Um

196
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,640
What does the store bought one do the store bought one is for abundance

197
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,680
Is another one I will literally hold on. I

198
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,600
It literally says abundance on it. I can't really show you because it has the brand name

199
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,760
And where it was crafted not that like not that I live there, but I don't want people to like triangulate my location

200
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
Um

201
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,520
Do you want to improve your luck? I could definitely make one to improve luck. Um

202
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,520
But yeah, so like I also have some floor to water floor to water is using a lot of um

203
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,080
Cleansing rituals. It looks like it's actually it's cologne. It's like it smells so good

204
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,960
It smells so good. It's like cloves cinnamon. Um, let me see

205
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,640
Just as fragrances doesn't say what but it smells absolutely delicious and it's also used for protection. Um

206
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
You sorry

207
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,360
I feel like people are gonna make a binding of isaac and uh call the lamb references

208
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,280
Yeah, it's literally called florida water. I don't know why

209
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480
It you can't drink this. It's literally alcohol

210
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,760
There's alcohol in this I've had this for a while because I just I'll just take some and dab it on me

211
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Uh, why specifically florida?

212
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,360
That's a great question. I suggest you google it

213
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,760
Have you ever dealt with people who would shame you for being interested in voodoo? Um

214
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,440
Um

215
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Not really because a lot of my friends are practice practitioners. We're just like a little witchy like

216
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,400
Trio me olive and salam. That's literally what we call our salam is because she's so witchy. Um

217
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,840
And no, like my friends are cool with it and even if people don't believe in it

218
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
I would literally bring my tarot to work and I'd have like

219
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Super freaking christian people ask me to read their cards and then come back later and be like wow, you were right

220
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,520
Like wow, thank you for telling me this wow. Thank you for guiding me this way. Thank you for blah blah blah blah blah

221
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,480
I remember like crying profusely reading someone's cards and I'm like who hurt you. Whoa

222
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,440
What did they do to you?

223
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,440
I have I will take a picture of my setup afterwards, but it is hilariously precarious and dangerous

224
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
I'll tell you that much. Um

225
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,160
But yeah

226
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,320
That's blasphemy the pig in which yeah, they're the pig in which committee. They're very sweet very kind very accepting

227
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,480
Um, I know this might put a lot of people off from me, but this isn't in my content

228
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I don't really do this in my content

229
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,520
I've done it once I did like randomly did terror reading after a tom and gachi stream because I was like

230
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
Let's do something else. Oh my tarot cards are right there

231
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,960
But this is not my predominant content. You will probably see me do this again in uh around halloween, but otherwise

232
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm not going to be doing this often. So it makes you uncomfortable. I totally understand where you're coming from

233
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,840
I totally respect your feelings. Um, but yeah, just think of yeah, think of me as one of the hex girls

234
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,440
Will you draw a card for harem? Yeah, I can do for so what I'm going to do. I'm going to do some cleansing

235
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,240
Um, I'm going to light some candles. So I have the green man candle. That's what I use to dedicate as presents for the spirits

236
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
I have a black candle for protection

237
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,840
um

238
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,800
Again, I have my uh, I don't know if you can tell but I have a five pointed star right here

239
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,680
And there's also a five pointed star on my rocks

240
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,960
My stones my gems. Um, but yeah, even though I'm not specifically into this kind of stuff

241
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,360
Find it relaxing a smart people to terror reading for people. Yeah, don't forget to shield. Yes

242
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm gonna I'm probably mentally going to shield and stuff. Um

243
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,240
Because it's gonna be very overwhelming with this many people watching me. I don't know. I like so one of my favorite

244
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
um

245
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,040
YouTubers who is uh like a terror reader is shonetta divine tarot

246
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,040
She's so sweet and kind, but she streams to like a thousand people or more and I'm like, I don't know how I could do that

247
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's a lot

248
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,680
Um, but yeah, my crown shot. Yeah, I have some amethyst to protect that

249

You know, because it will be very exhausting for me. Um

252

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,400
Into this reading into my area into my living space

Uh, you can have a haunting stream. No, they don't want to I'll tell you what I had one

355
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,960
Thing that haunted me and I was like, you don't belong here

356
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,640
And I was like, you know what but I'm out and then I just never dealt with that whatever it was again

357
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,480
They just they don't you know spirits don't really

358
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
They don't really care about me

359
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,240
They don't really care about anybody depends unless you piss them off. Yeah, we're a spiritual condom. Um

360
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,160
So let me grab some spedge

361
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,280
Some such I'm taking off my headphones. So if you don't know I will not hear it, but I do have text to speak on

362
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,080
Okay, yeah, we don't want any spirits like Chucky. That's a good point. Uh

363
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,760
So I'll actually show you what I'm pulling stuff out of um

364
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,440
So I got this I've uh had this for a couple years now. I'm just gonna place it on top of everything

365
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,040
So I I literally have it's dusty ignore that

366
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,360
Ignore how dusty it is. I have this giant they actually have two more

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,120
Uh similar to this but this is a contemporary. Um

368
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
What's it called contemporary

369
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Uh

370
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Like early 20th century

371
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,680
Um, I think jewelry box, but I've repurposed it into

372
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,040
Keeping a lot of my spell stuff

373
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,040
So I have some stones like it was a jar. I have my some sage in here

374
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,320
Um, I have some more like I have stuff that I've labeled

375
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,840
Uh hibiscus rose petals rose petals hibiscus. I have some mugwort

376
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,640
Uh, if you remember me my pl

377
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,360
I told you guys that you can use this to abort a child

378
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
You can

379
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:09,360
You can drink this or make it into a tea and trip like you're on mushrooms or abort a child

380
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Uh

381
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Yeah mugwort is crazy

382
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,080
I've never tried it though. I don't think I ever will especially because I just use this for

383
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,760
Uh spell purposes. It'd be weird if I drink it. Um

384
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
I also have a jar of honey

385
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,840
For like like uh sweet stuff if I were to make like a sweet spell. Um, so yeah, I'm no joke

386
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,960
I don't uh, this is this is legit for me. I don't

387
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,960
I don't fuck around like some you know people do

388
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
On tick talk on witch talk

389
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,720
And I kind of just like I'm making this. Ooh. Do you want to do a hex on somebody?

390
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,080
No, that's stupid. That's dumb. Um, I keep it to myself

391
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,560
I keep my own practice to myself, but I think it's fun to share on stream every once in a while

392
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,920
You got an abortion. You're lying. You're lying to me

393
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,800
Yeah, no hexing the moon. That's just dumb. Um, but yeah

394
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
You got some elderberries

395
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,520
Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries when I went to a run fair somebody screamed that and I

396
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,040
Died ever since I was so funny. Have some salt here

397
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,600
Uh, st. John's wort. I have chased berries, you know

398
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,400
I'll make you guys chase a lock you guys in a chastity bell. I'll put a hex on you that you can never nut

399
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,480
Um, just kidding. That's not what that's for. I have marshmallow

400
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,360
Oh snap. I have marshmallow root

401
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,200
I have a lot of stuff. I used to have stones up here, but I moved them to a different thing. So now it's only, um

402
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Now it's only

403
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,080
Other stuff here. I'll show you my my gem collection

404
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Oh

405
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
What's that?

406
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
Pardon you

407
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,040
So I organized these by color

408
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I bumped it. Oh no

409
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Are you guys alive?

410
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,440
You guys are

411
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,040
You're fine. Don't worry about it. So what I have you're on a chair

412
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
on a box

413
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
and I've

414
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,040
Jerry may like I've like MacGyvered this to my ring light

415
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
So

416
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,960
Yeah

417
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,640
So I got some black candles there. Don't worry about that. Um, my friend got me this

418
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,280
I was very happy when she gave this to me. Salem got me this. Um, she found it at like a yard sale. Yes

419
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
I know it has a mirror. You can't see me

420
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,480
Okay, I just can't see me. I'm doing fortnite dances

421
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
Um, so I have some I have some stones

422
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,600
I have some I have some jammies, um, but they're not organized

423
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,720
Sorry, I'm sorry. I saw the floss

424
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
She's heading to witty

425
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
She's heading to witty

426
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,680
I got that rug I wanted for since I destroyed the other one during a member stream, um

427
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,720
Any moonstone? Yeah, I have moonstone. I got rainbow moonstone. I got

428
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
normal moonstone

429
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,840
I got I got moonstone. Okay, but kind of moonstone you want want to want to buy some

430
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,200
I can't really open a jacket, but we want to buy some gems

431
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,280
um

432
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Let me put this over here actually

433
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Oh

434
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,120
What spells or rituals have you done to ward anything off anything crazy or just normal protection? Um, so

435
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,880
What I do when I clean is like open a door and a lot of people just do this

436
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,000
It's actually a cultural thing people do and they don't realize it

437
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,360
Uh, you know like sweeping stuff out a door or like throwing things out a window or whatever

438
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,880
That's actually a form of getting rid of negative energy

439
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm running out of breath because I'm running around

440
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,880
um

441
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,760
So I'll do that and then I'll walk around in sage and then I will take like moon water or like florida water

442
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
and I will um

443
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,560
Draw a pentagram on every mirror because mirrors are portals

444
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,600
Don't forget that mirrors are portals

445
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,600
um

446
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Not a pet. Oh, it's like it's not a pentagram. It's like you draw it in the opposite direction. It's like banishment

447
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Um, but yeah, I've done that before

448
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,840
That's when I was having nightmares because what you shouldn't do you should never have a mirror facing your bed

449
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,560
When you sleep, but I'll I I've always had that

450
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,760
So and I always wondered oh, why do I get night terrors? Oh, why do I get nightmares so often? Oh, why do I have such crazy dreams?

451
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,040
um, so I started doing that when I learned about like

452
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
being a practitioner

453
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
And then then it stopped

454
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
Then I wasn't getting night terrors anymore

455
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,800
Um, but yeah, so yeah, and I sage and then get all the energy and and then negative energy out nightmares nightmares nightmares

456
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,520
um

457
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,160
Don't say something five times around the mirror

458
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,400
Uh, oh my god my camera like my camera wire here. I'll I literally will point

459
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,720
So like I seriously have like the why the guys like my toes toes legs free toes

460
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
I got my toes done

461
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
You can't see but they're purple

462
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,600
Stay I should like tape this to the box

463
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,880
So it's more stable. It's like rocking forward because of the weight. What if I

464
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Sure, okay that works

465
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Yeah for free

466
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Don't say I want to watch that movie though. I can't wait to see the new one. It looks so good. Um

467
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,320
All right, what time is it? It's already been 40 minutes and I have any I've just been explaining and talking

468
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,800
But I hope you guys get the general idea

469
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Uh, no toe beans

470
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,280
And that's why I put I put those little like toe bean things on my throat

471
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
um

472
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,360
Far blue thing looks like a bomb. What this?

473
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
This what?

474
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Huh, where's the light?

475
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Alakazam

476
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,560
Back to life back to reality black

477
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,360
My eyes oh the the candle so this is a candle holder. This is also a candle holder

478
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,760
This is actually really freaking bright. Can I turn this down?

479
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,960
You know what I like the ambiance and we're gonna light some candles anyway. Um solar flare

480
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
It's the florida juice

481
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,160
It's the it's the florida juice

482
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,960
So we sip the moon can get high from an abortion and jars help predict the lottery. Did I get that right?

483
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,320
You would be correct. I'm so happy you've kind of done everything

484
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Um, anyways, I'm gonna light this

485
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:48,240
No, this is youtube it's sage. This is educational. This is an educational stream

486
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Do you think I would have this much that is ridiculous? I don't even smoke

487
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,880
But she be why do you have that lighter to light stuff what they're not just for cigarettes and other stuff guys

488
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:26,080
This is strong actually I should have just known a little bit

489
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,520
It's not going back. I'm gonna cleanse the rest of those world actually

490
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:45,040
Connecting with the spiritual plane connecting with the intentions of the highs and pray is good

491
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,400
Spirits connect me with folks that are be listening to the stream today

492
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,360
Let them gain something from the stream let their minds be opened

493
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
And

494
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,720

There's no room for her on my desk

499
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240

500
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,200
I'll be good or what what am I missing am I am I interested in story driven games? I love story driven games

501
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I can't believe I'm out of it

502
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
Fair point was the truth. No. Oh

No, the plat there's so many people showing like stuff like this online

504
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,280
On youtube like I there's a lot of tear a lot of tarot readers on youtube and people who will teach you stuff

505
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,480
Um, so it's not youtube's not gonna take me down for this. This is definitely like

506
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Um, like religious expression. I don't really see this as a religion to be honest. I guess

507
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Um

508
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,960
Want to play final fantasy? I've never played final fantasy in my life. Okay. I'm gonna light this candle

509
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Do you like this? It looks like a taser

510
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,120
Hello, don't worry. It looks like it's burning the thing, but it's not I promise you

511
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,080
It is very bright on this camera and then I'm gonna light this

512
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
This

513
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,360
And I'm just gonna take a moment

514
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,720
I'm I'm just gonna you're gonna experience a moment of silence to know your which I am baby girl

515
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,400
I don't really like being called a witch, but it is what it is

516
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,600
I'm seeing it. I just need to kind of like center myself and shield myself like Toma mentioned. So I'm gonna do that right now

517
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,800
People watching like oh, she crazy crazy. You're fine. It's cool. Don't worry about it

518
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,720
Hey, man, you're eating a cracker that represents the the body of a dude that died

519
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,360
So, you know, you tell me

520
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960

521
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,640
How should we call you instead? You don't have to call me anything. Just call me she be

522
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,400
What that's a that's a food

523
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:14,720
All right, so that's good. We're gonna make this did you guys decide what you want in the spell jar

524
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,840
Very very true opinion and wicked rituals aren't any stranger. That's very accurate

525
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,240
Where are my mods mods stop stop people

526
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,680
Okay, hold on let me let me let me

529
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Let me

530
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,560
Ask question what kind of spell jar

531
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,120
I put lobe instead of love

532
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,920
And when I say love I mean like overarching love for everybody. I'm not going to do a love spell on you guys

533
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,640
I I that's not safe

534
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
It's not safe

535
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,000
I don't

536
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I know if I did it

537
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,840
Something bad would happen. I don't want to do that and

538
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,760
I

539
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,640
Already love you enough and you already love me enough that if you think

540
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,760
That a spell jar will make it better then you don't know me at all

541
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,240
All right, you don't know me at all if you think you need a spell jar for me to fucking love you

542
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,880
You're fucking stupid

543
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
How about that?

544
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
I

545
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,760
No, I'd win do you see my muscles I'd win

546
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,120
Don't put love in the poll while I'm doing love as in like how I'll specify

547
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
self love

548

556
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,920
I know that I make another channel called she be witched

557
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,640
And it's just me doing all this stuff constant

558
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
Wait a second

559
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
And I do like collective terror

560
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Wait a second

561
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,080
Wait a minute

562
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Which also

563
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,160
Um

564
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,720
New projects for next year

565
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,000
It's funny when I was when in my pl

566
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,720
I was actually going to do something like this and do a lot of more predominant like

567
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,760
Spiritual content because that's my that was my whole thing

And then I was gonna do set up like a like a thing where if you want you can like send me a dollar

569
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,320
I'll do like a one dollar card reading for you or something. I was gonna do that

570
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
Uh

571
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
Abundance wealth

Okay, what else? So I have self love

573
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
Self love aka growth

What's up with that?

578
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,360
This you guys can't tell but this flame just got freaking huge

579
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,640
That means someone's trying to do shit. Someone's talking shit right now. I know it's you stop it. It's not nice

580
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,840

581
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880

582
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,760
Caught

583
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
Um

584
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,440
I'm gonna say I'll say happiness happiness we all want to be happy

585
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,520
The ball panels. No, it looks like it's close, but I promise you it's not it's not

586
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,040
Yeah, I'm sticking my hand in between it there. It's not close

587
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,560
I'm not doing it. Why would I do that?

588
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,120
Everybody just wants money money money money must be funny

589
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,120
Hey

590
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,640
Wait, how's the song go money money money in a rich man's world

591
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,480
Cute setup make it rain. I just take my cards

592
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,240
I'm gonna put some of this on me

593
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,720
Because I can already feel some people wishing me some ill will

594
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
I'm gonna dab some

595
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,840
I'm

596
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:42,320
Florida water protective I'm doing on my crown chakra my heart chakra my throat chakra just so I can speak better

597
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
I actually should get some blue kyanite out for

598
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,720
Communication that's actually a really fucking good idea. Let me get through that

599
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,360
Oh blue kyanite

600
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Can't tell if I got a pee

601
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,400
You know, it's funny cuz like, um

602
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,960
Come on can't scooch forward. Um, I'll end the poll at

603
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
655

604
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Luck can bring money as well true. Um, I usually

605
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
So like personally I

606
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,240
It's weird because like I'm not super on the thing that

607
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
Like rocks

608
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Do stuff

609
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,680
But I'm on the belief that they're helpful reminders

610
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Of repers of what they represent

611
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,000
So like I have a blue kyanite necklace that I would wear when I would go to work

612
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
So I would be a better speaker

613
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:07,600
And if I felt like I was stressing out because it wasn't speaking well enough, I would just kind of ground myself

614
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,480
um with a

615
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,000
A kyanite necklace and just be like no like just take a take a moment

616
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,520
So again, you don't have to be like, oh this rock is vibrating at this frequency

617
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,040
It's gonna heal me and my cancer. No, that's not no

618
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,360
No

619
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,800
One I threw that window did one exactly Fuwa

620
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Their minerals will rain

621
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,720
Can we wish for anti-will? Why would you wish for anti-will?

622
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,640
Yeah, talismans don't need to have actual powers to mean something to you

623
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,160
You can just use them as a sort of reminder a touchstone a hundred percent

624
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,000
So I'm putting this right here. So I remember to talk right here. I'll put it in between here. This will be communication

625
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
protection spirits

626
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,200
We love to see it

627
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Well for the pay pigs what?

628
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
Well for uh

629
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:18,720
The pay pigs that will wander i'm manifesting pay pigs will wander over to azura's stream

630
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,360
for her birthday

631
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,800
And just give that beautiful woman money so she can move out

632
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Can you hex yourself?

633
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,120
uh

634
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,120
technically yes

635
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,960
Because like

636
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:41,280
If you mess something up or you disrespect like a spirit that you're working with or something like it can kind of

637
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Blow back at you. I don't like

638
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,080
Hexing because I just feel like it's like negative like I don't really want to send negative energy

639
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,640
Like there's some people out there. I'm like witch talk that'll be like, oh if you do something bad

640
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,720
It's gonna come back at you three times. No

641
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,400
No, that's like that's like a wicked thing and I'm not wicked

642
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,400
You can get anti-wealth right now send all of your money to she being you have to deal with that in any more

643
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,360
Magic. Thank you foo

00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,240
Send some send some to fuwa too

645
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,360
Forfeit all of your moral possession to the goddess azura

00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,280
Can you do one for success for my little brother? Oh, that's so sweet of you

647
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
Oh keep keep holding that intention

648
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,280
Keep holding that intention and something so maybe something won't go to come come from it

649
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,760
Okay, it looks like it's self-love and growth ladies and gentlemen. So that's what we will be doing

650
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240

This candle's going crazy. It's also melting very fast. This one's been fine. This one I got um

655
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,000
In a special place made by somebody. Um, and they rolled it with like herbs and stuff

656
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,880
um

657
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,360
She be I found and kept a cool green rock when I was digging around my yard a few years ago

658
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,400
Does that mean something? It's probably just a cool rock. I'm so sorry

659
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,840
We can't

660
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:41,840
I'm not the dead name dead naming mercy

661
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
Oh

662
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,520
Sometimes the cigar is just a cigar. It's the beautiful stuff. Stop wait. Can I

663
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Where is it I can't

664
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,920
There we go. I offer you a rose

665
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,960
Will you take it?

666
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Will you take the rose?

667
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Wine wine wine rose

668
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,520
See now it works. I don't understand that

669
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,560
Hear me clicking away

670
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,160
Haram will you accept this rose and move forward on the bachelorette? You will be

671
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,440
My immersion. Okay, so I have some drawers. Let me grab a drawer

672
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,600
And I literally got these drawers from s see there's a bunch of drawers

673
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:06,160
Let's see. I need one with a good cork in it

674
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,560
You

675
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Oh, do you guys want to see my favorite deck?

676
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,680
I got this deck a while ago. This is the first deck I ever purchased

677
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,480
This is the deck my mom like freaked out about because she saw it and she wanted me to throw it away because my parents are very Christian

678
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,800
They're called soul cards. They're very popular

679
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,240
What the I don't know if you'll be able to see them

680
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,920
But they're so gorgeous they have like roses hold on

681
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,480
Three two one flashbang

682
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,280
They have like roses and stuff

683
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,600
They're like really pretty minimalistic gold

684
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:09,280
This is the Wheel of Fortune. Oh, that's good. It was in reverse though, so maybe not so good. I didn't shuffle these though

685
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:17,680
Oh, we got the devil, but isn't that gorgeous though? Like those look like good tacks, you know, I can see someone get like getting that as a tat

686
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,480
I

687
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Have a lot of decks

688
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,480
I'm pulling all our kana cards when I'm going through this deck. I'm just

689
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,880
Going through that's so funny. How about what about the next one? The next one's our kana card. It's not, okay?

690
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,480
It's a womb tattoo. Yeah, they actually do look like womb tattoos

691
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,280
But this is really pretty. It's my favorite deck

692
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,320
Yeah, I have one, two, three

693
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,160
Ordex? What deck is that?

694
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:05,200
Oh, wait. No, I have two oracle decks and three tarot decks. In fact, I will get the oracle deck out

695
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,760
Guys, I had, I had, I had

696
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:25,440
Ice cream today because it was hot outside and I think I got poop, but it's fine. Um, I have this oracle star seat

697
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,120
I don't, so I don't believe

698
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,520
You can google what a star seat is. I do not

699
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Subscribe to that belief system

700
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,320
But I like

701
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,320
bit

702
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
Calm down

703
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
Thank you

704
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
Stop

705
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,960
Whoever's talking shit, your mom's a hoe

706
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Um, but these are really cool. I'll probably use these during the

707
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,720
Tarot reading today because they have a lot of cool self-reflection stuff the blue flame

708
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,440
This one's fine. This one's freaking out

709
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:17,600
No, it's not that this is a protection candle and it's telling me people are wishing me harm right now

710
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,120
I don't blame them

711
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,320
And then I have a monology manifestation one. I just this is my most recent one that I got

712
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,320
Oh

713
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,320
Exodia obliterate the aunties who will beat them

714
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,560
Okay, so

715
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,040
Where oh here you are

716
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,200
I'm going to cleanse the jar

717
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,600
So I have some um

718
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,320
dragon's blood incense

719
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:08,160
And I'm gonna dab a little bit of florida water. It's a spirit of the tomagotchi 100%

720
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,520
And there's like by the way, there's like no rhyme or like

721
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,920
Like you don't have to do if you see this and you're just like, oh, I have to do it this way

722
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,360
No, this is what I found to be the best for me

723
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,840
You don't have to follow what I'm doing to make your own

724
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,840
You can kind of just go with your own intuition a lot of stuff is intuition based

725
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,640
Dragon's blood smells so good

726
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,520
It's a perk exactly. That's why I like this because it's just it's a personal experience

727
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:02,560
I don't even know this will work. This is usually for candles. Oh, it worked kind of no

728
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,160
So I'm just gonna

729
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,720
So normally when you cleanse something you want to cleanse it with fire, you know all the elements earth air fire

730
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,880
um

731
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,200
So I'll be putting like some salt in this

732
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,400
um

733
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:37,760
Or you put some like the florida water this is like smoking like the fires in the air in the air essentially

734
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,520
And I just feel like this into a bit a little bit more

735
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,680
Mmm, this smells absolutely delicious

736
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
I forgot what I had this year for

737
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,720
Oh, this is to put on the

738
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,560
Thingamabob this is gonna be put on the cork

739
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
to seal it in purple

740
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,920
Just vibes

741
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,200
Do you believe in the 3am stuff? What is the 3am stuff?

742
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:26,720
Wind water heart go planet or like if anybody remembers like toy box

743
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,760
Earth wind water and fire

744
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,280
Can't get in the way when I'm running to you

745
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,840
Because I would go through stormy weather just to tell you how much I love you

746
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,040
Okay, so we got that

747
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:52,240
So we're doing self-love. I love self-love. So this is a this will be a personal

748
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,000
So and I I literally have some rose quartz right here. This will be the centerpiece

749
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,720
Oh, I kind of like it if I just stick it in the center of the eye that feels really right

750
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,600
Um, okay

751
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,240
Oh

752
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,840
The witching hour

753
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,520
Oh, okay

754
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,960
Oh, I wake up at 3am or 3 3 3 all the time like

755
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,400
If I wake up in the middle of the night, it's at those numbers and I'm just like, huh neat goes back to sleep

756
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
Like it's fine

757
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:39,520
I want to do a 3am challenge because those are dumb. I don't fuck with spirits, you know

758
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
Um

759
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,400
They don't fuck with me. I don't fuck with them

760
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,360
My rug is getting messed up

761
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,520
I

762
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,960
Yeah, I'm not doing station

763
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,240
3am I did one of those little games and then the Elmo doll came to life

764
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,520
So I'm just taking out some stuff

765
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,800
You know

766
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:20,480
I like using Himalayan pink salt because again pink love self love. I love that so much

767
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,040
Am I not doing something over here?

768
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,720
So I'll put a little bit of Himalayan pink salt in there for the earth component

769
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,440
also for like some added

770
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,640
Protection stuff. I need to get some more Himalayan pink. So that's a good

771
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,400
I do a little bit more

772
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,600
Perfect nice little layer

773
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,240
You know, you know qualms in there

774
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,720
What did I just do okay, I'm like what did I just do with the cork for this?

775
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,040
3am looked at myself in the mirror and the mirror image moved, but so did I

776
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,080
Calling among us at 3am amogus

777
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,120
Amogus at 3am

778
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,440
I

779
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,600
I am out of I used to have rose quartz. So I have like

780
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,840
A little bit of rope like I had it in like one of these little tiny ones

781
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,960
But I'm out. So that's a bummer

782
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,520
However

783
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,520
Can I fit?

784
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,680
I have

785
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,160
Rose quartz. Will that fit in there? Oh

786
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,120
Will this fit?

787
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,240
Well, this is peach quartz. Oh it will. Oh my god. Okay. So you guys can have this cute peach quartz

788
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,760
It actually kind of looks like a heart

789
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,240
Oh

790
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,560
In a way not really, but it will fit in the jar. So I'll put that in there

791
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Get in there

792
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,880
Okay, it just fit a second ago. I just put it in the wrong way

793
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,640
Oh, no, I already messed this up. That's a bad sign bros. It's also just I can't get this out because my nails

794
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:15,040
If you squint hard enough, it's close

795
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,760
Oh my god, why did I like I love my nails, but I can't pick up anything

796
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,280
Hold on I need to get something to help me let me get this out because it's like it's like um

797
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,120
I can't pick it up. It just keeps falling out slipping out of my nails

798
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
Oh

799
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,880
Oh, where'd that go?

800
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,380
Oh, does that point perfectly when I charted a different one?

801
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,880
Oh, there.

802
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,380
Boy things.

803
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,880
It's in there.

804
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,380
I don't know if you can see.

805
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,380
It's like the big giant rock.

806
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:28,380
That was from my personal collection, that little peach quartz.

807
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,380
I got that. I forget when I got that little peach quartz.

808
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,380
Okay.

809
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,380
I'm just shaping heart, but a heart nonetheless.

810
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,380
And you know, I feel like there's a lesson there.

811
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,380
There's a lesson there.

812
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,380
If you feel like you're like not worthy of love,

813
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,380
or if you're a little misshapen,

814
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,380
there is always, you will always find a way to fit somewhere.

815
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,380
You are, you will fit.

816
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,380
You're fine. You're all right.

817
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,380
I'm going to do a little bit of amethyst

818
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,380
for the crown chocker for the self growth.

819
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,380
I don't need, can I go to a cool rock fund?

820
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:26,380
I haven't really shopped for any gems or stones in a long time.

821
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:31,380
I actually haven't gone to my metaphysical shop in quite a bit.

822
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:37,380
How many, hold on, how many?

823
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,380
How many?

824
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,380
How many?

825
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,380
How many?

826
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,380
What's the word?

827
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,380
Starts to see not how many channels in a heart.

828
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,380
How many?

829
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:08,380
How many chambers?

830
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,380
Oh my God.

831
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,380
There are four chambers.

832
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,380
That's right.

833
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,380
I could remember if there was five.

834
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,380
Okay.

835
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:23,380
So I'm going to put one for each chamber because I've already put three in.

836
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,380
So I'll put a fourth in.

837
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,380
I like me some numbers.

838
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,380
I'll put a fourth.

839
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,380
You know what?

840
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,380
Let's throw in some adventuring for luck.

841
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,380
Put one piece of adventuring.

842
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,380
So this is adventuring.

843
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,380
I can never pronounce it right.

844
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,380
It's like a light green stone.

845
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:56,380
Now we know how good job you're in jeopardy.

846
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:07,380
And I'm going to put a little bit of honey to sweeten up our lives.

847
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,380
I need something to get the honey out though.

848
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,380
I think now we'll get like a chopstick.

849
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,380
I think I can drizzle that in from the chopstick.

850
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,380
Hi, Boobie.

851
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:34,380
Hi, handsome boy.

852
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,380
I just frickin' tricked or something.

853
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,380
I'm okay.

854
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,380
Show cat?

855
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,380
I don't even know where Boobie just went.

856
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,380
He walked by me and then he was like, later, dude.

857
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,380
Oh my God.

858
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,380
I knocked you over your heart.

859
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,380
Oh, no, no, no.

860
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,380
Don't fall with my heart.

861
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:08,380
I wonder if I'll take you home.

862
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,380
I'll let you settle in for love and health.

863
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,380
We're going to sweeten up our self-love.

864
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:29,380
We're going to sweeten up our lives in growth.

865
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:50,380
Mmm, delicious.

866
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,380
You know, honey never goes bad.

867
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,380
It like kills whatever bacteria and fungus tries to get inside of it.

868
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,380
It's great.

869
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,380
Honey can preserve human bodies.

870
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:10,380
Yes, Mero.

871
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,380
Hi, Mero.

872
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,380
Yep, it's very, very cool.

873
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:21,380
Honey doesn't go bad and can be used as an antiseptic because it's too sugary of very little oxygen.

874
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,380
Truth.

875
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,380
All right, let's see you guys.

876
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:29,380
I don't know if you guys can see how crazy that flame is getting.

877
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,380
That one's chilling.

878
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,380
That one's...

879
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:37,380
I just need to focus.

880
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,380
It looks like...

881
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,380
I can see it getting brighter.

882
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,380
Someone's not happy.

883
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,380
Did I just accidentally box myself?

884
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,380
I don't know.

885
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,380
Your tower decks look so pretty.

886
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,380
Thank you.

887
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,380
Thank you, Mero.

888
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,380
Flashbang out.

889
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,380
Flame is working over time.

890
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:13,380
I'm like, I think it's just because the wick is too long to be honest with you at that point.

891
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,380
This one's fine.

892
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,380
That one's not doing so well.

893
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:20,380
It looks like it's close to the phone, but it's literally not.

894
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,380
I'm sticking my hand in front of it.

895
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,380
It's fine.

896
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,380
Just save that close to the soundproofing.

897
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,380
It's fine.

898
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,380
Do you want me to move it?

899
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:33,380
Do you want me to put it right in front of the camera?

900
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,380
Flashbang.

901
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,380
Whoa, that looks so cool.

902
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,380
What the hell?

903
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,380
The wick also split in two.

904
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:59,380
Everything has him, and now it's calming down.

905
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:03,380
I think because the person feels called out.

906
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,380
The wick is split in two.

907
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,380
This person is torn.

908
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:11,380
They don't know why they hate, but they do.

909
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:16,380
Now it's calming down.

910
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,380
Now this one's getting longer.

911
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:23,380
My spirits are agreeing.

912
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,380
Show pedicure.

913
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:26,380
I already did earlier.

914
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,380
The frenzied flame.

915
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,380
I can hear the haters via the candle.

916
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,380
It looks like it's going to go out soon, which is very interesting.

917
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,380
I think the person-

918
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,380
I saw that on my screen.

919
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,380
Slowly tip.

920
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:47,380
I'm going down real in timbre.

921
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,380
Okay, we're fine.

922
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,380
You're okay.

923
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,380
It's okay, sweetie.

924
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,380
You're fine.

925
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,380
You're fine.

926
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,380
Are you okay?

927
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:56,380
Are you okay?

928
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,380
You have some, have some quarts.

929
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,380
Have some quarts.

930
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,380
It actually jumped.

931
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:05,380
I saw it on my screen slowly tipping.

932
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,380
I'm trying to get the balance.

933
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,380
Snorting rocks.

934
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,380
Hell yeah, brother.

935
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,380
All right.

936
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,380
So we got that.

937
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,380
We got that.

938
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:22,380
It's funny because when I mentioned I wanted to do a spell jar, a self-love came up a lot.

939
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:27,380
And so that's why everything's purple because purple is very spiritual.

940
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,380
It's very like higher enlightenment.

941
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,380
It has to do a lot with like, I don't know, personally for me growth.

942
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,380
So that's why I got purple.

943
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,380
Everything's purple, purple, purple, purple.

944
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,380
My outfit is red, but I just didn't feel like changing it.

945
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:45,380
I thought I would blend it into the background if I did purple.

946
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,380
The spirit is in the room.

947
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,380
No, it's not a spirit.

948
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:52,380
This is a physical representation of anybody who is wishing me harm.

949
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,380
This is the spirit.

950
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,380
Spirit's chilling.

951
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,380
Spirit's been just hanging out, having a great time.

952
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,380
Tough kid must have felt one.

953
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,380
My God.

954
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,380
I haven't touched the Tamagotchi, by the way.

955
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,380
I looked at it.

956
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:14,380
Why did nobody tell me the chat was like not working for the last like hour?

957
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,380
Why did nobody say anything?

958
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,380
Guys.

959
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,380
You thought I knew?

960
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,380
You did?

961
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,380
Oh.

962
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,380
Awkward.

963
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:41,380
Too locked in of content.

964
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:43,380
It's from before stream.

965
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,380
Wait, you're not scuffed?

966
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:52,380
I dropped the camera several times and the chat wasn't working.

967
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,380
I'm very scuffed.

968
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,380
We move.

969
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,380
We go.

970
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,380
Sorry, Vod Watchers.

971
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,380
You're not going to be able to see what people are talking about.

972
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,380
You're just going to hear me ramble.

973
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,380
I'll try to pay attention to that more often.

974
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,380
Okay.

975
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,380
So you got that.

976
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:12,380
So I have some lavender.

977
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,380
And you see lavender is good for like calm just in general.

978
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,380
It's good for like calming, relaxation.

979
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,380
I got everywhere I got this from.

980
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:22,380
You can't really tell what it says for protection.

981
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,380
The label.

982
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,380
Tamagotchi alive barely.

983
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,380
It was, it kept growing up ugly.

984
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:32,380
So I kept ignoring it.

985
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:35,380
So I'm throw some lavender in there.

986
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:45,380
Lavender for protecting ourselves as we go on our spiritual journey and grow.

987
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,380
We're also going to do some peppermint.

988
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,380
Poor second child.

989
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:04,380
We're going to do some peppermint to ward off any negativity.

990
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,380
And peppermint is good for like health and stuff.

991
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,380
Or just like mint in general.

992
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,380
So jazz, I have some Jasmine here.

993
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,380
Jasmine is used for love and friendship and sweetness.

994
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:31,380
And so this will help, you know, sweeten up our relationships a little bit.

995
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,380
Heck is this.

996
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,380
It's witchcraft motherfucker.

997
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,380
I already have a child.

998
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:43,380
It's Fia.

999
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,380
She's my baby.

1000
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,380
She's literally a baby.

1001
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,380
I say, I tell Fia, you ready for the high chair?

1002
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:52,380
And then I stick, I sit her upright on the couch and I start feeding her.

1003
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,380
And I give her a little bib.

1004
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,380
This piece is too long.

1005
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,380
Boomi is my child.

1006
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,380
Raina is also my child.

1007
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,380
Raina is the eldest child.

1008
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,380
So this is what we got so far.

1009
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,380
Oh, let me turn on the light.

1010
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,380
Flash bang.

1011
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,380
So you got some honey.

1012
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,380
You got some peach courts.

1013
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,380
You got some Himalayan pink salt.

1014
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,380
We got some lavender.

1015
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,380
You got some Jasmine.

1016
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,380
Feeling good.

1017
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:47,380
You have a little bit of amethyst for each chamber of the heart.

1018
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:53,380
Everything's about like kind of like symbolism to be honest with you.

1019
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,380
That's why I like, I usually do stuff like by numbers.

1020
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,380
Let's do some rosemary for strength and protection.

1021
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,380
Spirit's feeling pretty good.

1022
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,380
See that candle kind of going.

1023
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,380
It's feeling, it's feeling pretty happy.

1024
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,380
I'm doing this.

1025
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,380
I can tell.

1026
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,380
Honey interacting with the salt.

1027
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:16,380
Probably.

1028
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,380
They're chilling.

1029
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,380
They're eating each other.

1030
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,380
Rosemary.

1031
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,380
Yeah.

1032
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,380
All about belief.

1033
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,380
It's all about intention.

1034
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,380
There's no hard rules.

1035
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:38,380
You make it what it is.

1036
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:43,380
What's tiger's eye and black onyx?

1037
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:48,380
Black onyx is like, usually like, I say black obsidian and black onyx are like,

1038
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,380
grounding and protection.

1039
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,380
Tiger's eye.

1040
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,380
I actually, I'm not drawn to tiger's eye.

1041
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:57,380
So I don't really know a lot about tiger's eye.

1042
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,380
I know my, one of my friends loves tiger's eye.

1043
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:03,380
So I usually will buy her like tiger's eye stuff.

1044
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,380
Usually I believe that's for like clairvoyance stuff.

1045
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,380
I can't really recall.

1046
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,380
Just Google it.

1047
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,380
Go on Pinterest.

1048
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,380
Witchy cotton bum.

1049
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,380
Can you remove a curse in my life?

1050
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:19,380
Twice people who I joked about dying nearly do.

1051
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,380
Did I upset the fey?

1052
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,380
Oh no.

1053
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,380
I don't fuck with the fey.

1054
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,380
I don't know.

1055
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:31,380
The fact that you know who the fey are and you want, you acknowledge them.

1056
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,380
You've probably done something to piss them off.

1057
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:38,380
If you're specifically bringing them up, then.

1058
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,380
Tiger's eye is a very pretty stone.

1059
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,380
My personal favorite.

1060
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,380
You can see it right here is labradorite.

1061
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,380
Labradorite has a really pretty flash.

1062
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,380
Hold on.

1063
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:52,380
I can't, it's, it's a type of felt spar.

1064
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,380
I'll show it to you.

1065
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,380
Let me just turn on the light again.

1066
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,380
Yippee flashbang.

1067
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,380
A friend gave me this.

1068
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,380
You can see the really gorgeous flash.

1069
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,380
I love labradorite.

1070
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,380
So gorgeous.

1071
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,380
What are the fey?

1072
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,380
Google it.

1073
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:16,380
Google exists and is free for everyone.

1074
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:22,380
Did I, did I ever tell you guys about my, my, my run-in with the fey?

1075
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,380
So.

1076
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,380
I remember.

1077
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:29,380
So this is when I was first like researching the fey.

1078
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,380
And learning about them.

1079
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,380
Cause I was, I was learning more about my Irish heritage.

1080
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:37,380
Cause I am Irish on my mother's side.

1081
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,380
And so I was in like, you know, fey are huge.

1082
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:46,380
Like the, the, the fey folk are very, very integral to Ireland.

1083
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:50,380
And, um, so I was like doing research.

1084
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,380
I was talking about it a lot.

1085
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:55,380
I was kind of, I was kind of, I was kind of like,

1086
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,380
I was like doing research.

1087
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,380
I was talking about it a lot.

1088
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:02,380
I was kind of, I wasn't being disrespectful per se,

1089
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,380
but I was, I was bringing too much attention up to them.

1090
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:11,380
Um, and then one day I walked outside, um, just to hang out outside just

1091
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:15,380
because it was like summer, spring day or whatever the heck I can remember.

1092
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,380
And I'm walking around.

1093
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:21,380
I am kind of, I usually will pick stuff from my mother's garden to like,

1094
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:25,380
all I used to when I lived with my parents to like put in my stuff.

1095
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:30,380
And, um, cause I know my spiritual team, they love fresh flowers from like,

1096
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,380
that was their favorite thing is fresh flowers from my mom's garden.

1097
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:34,380
Anytime I visit my mom, I'll bring back flowers for them.

1098
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:42,380
And, um, so, uh, I'm walking around and picking up stuff and I go,

1099
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:48,380
so there's a big, huge, giant maple tree in my child and home's backyard.

1100
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:53,380
Huge, huge, huge, huge, um, maple tree.

1101
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,380
Um, and I used to like, I used, I love that maple tree.

1102
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,380
I would climb it all the time.

1103
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,380
I did like so much like, cause I'm an only child.

1104
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,380
I would like play so much all the time over there.

1105
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,380
I had a swing on it.

1106
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,380
It was great.

1107
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,380
I love that tree.

1108
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,380
It's awesome.

1109
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:07,380
I had a nice big backyard growing up.

1110
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,380
I was very thankful for that cause I spent a lot of my time outside.

1111
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:14,380
And, um, like it was eight hours of wolf quests and wolf role playing.

1112
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,380
And then I would go outside the next day for eight hours.

1113
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,380
That's how my life was.

1114
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:25,380
And, um, the day that I was kind of like, I'll just get to the point.

1115
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:44,380
I go to the base of the tree and there is a mouse cleanly cut in half.

1116
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,380
Where you walk outside.

1117
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:59,380
There's a mouse cleanly cut in half head over here and trails back body over here.

1118
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:04,380
Perfectly laid out heart and trails, all that stuff guts.

1119
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,380
I'm looking around.

1120
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:08,380
I'm looking to see like, did a hawk drop this?

1121
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,380
Did a cat get to it?

1122
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:16,380
But no, the body was laid out and it was on a, cause there's like, there's like, um,

1123
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,380
you know how like, obviously there'll be rocks in the ground.

1124
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:21,380
So they're like, in the base of the tree, there was this giant rock and it was almost

1125
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:26,380
like a flat, like rock at the base of the tree that was like among the roots.

1126
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:29,380
And it was laid perfectly there.

1127
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,380
My candle is freaking out cause it knows what I'm talking about.

1128
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:34,380
Perfectly there.

1129
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,380
And you remember the story?

1130
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:44,380
And I was like, oh, and I just knew it was like a fucking threat.

1131
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,380
I was like, no, thank you, no, thank you.

1132
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,380
I'm so sorry.

1133
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:49,380
I'm so sorry.

1134
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,380
I'm so sorry.

1135
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:54,380
Um, by the way, if never accept a gift from the Fay cause they'll want something in return

1136
01:25:54,380 --> 01:26:03,380
or, um, by the way, um, so if it was a gift, if it was like a warning, I left it there.

1137
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,380
I left it there.

1138
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:08,380
Um, I immediately went inside.

1139
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:14,380
I grabbed a little saucer, like a little plate or like a little, like a glass cup of milk,

1140
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:21,380
put some honey in it, put a little bread out, um, like a sign.

1141
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:25,380
And then I left and I came back the next day.

1142
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,380
Mouse was gone.

1143
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:28,380
Like I had never, ever been there.

1144
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:33,380
Like there wasn't like guts and entrails or like blood stains or like some like sort of

1145
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,380
like on the rock.

1146
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:39,380
Like it was, I remember going to my mom and showing her this and she was so disturbed.

1147
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:42,380
Um, I was like, mom, do you think a cat did this?

1148
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,380
Like a neighborhood cat?

1149
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,380
She's like, I don't know why, but I feel really bad about that.

1150
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:51,380
And when my Christian mom says she feels really bad about something, then I know something's up.

1151
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:53,380
You're asking what they're just saying.

1152
01:26:53,380 --> 01:27:01,380
Hi, maybe, maybe, um, the next day, uh, the milk was gone.

1153
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,380
The thing remained.

1154
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:07,380
And you know, there's like ants and stuff drinking like, like eating a little remnant.

1155
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:10,380
So the honey in there, uh, the bread was gone.

1156
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:13,380
There was no ants on the board.

1157
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,380
There was no crumbs.

1158
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,380
No crumbs were left.

1159
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,380
No crumbs.

1160
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:26,380
And then I know, and then, and then I saw, I was telling my friends this story.

1161
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:34,380
And then when I got home, my mom's like the weirdest thing happened.

1162
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,380
And I'm like, what?

1163
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:40,380
And she's just like, so my parents have like a ring camera.

1164
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,380
Um, just so they can keep an eye on stuff.

1165
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:47,380
Like if there's like, you know, cause they live in a kind of busy road or whatever.

1166
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:50,380
And somebody's broken into the house before when I was younger.

1167
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:53,380
That's another story I'll tell another time.

1168
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:58,380
And my mom's like, it was really weird.

1169
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:01,380
Uh, I was looking at the ring camera.

1170
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:07,380
There was this flash of light in the camera feed cut off.

1171
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:16,380
And when I went to go look to see what had happened, she went and looked at the ring camera.

1172
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:19,380
The ring camera was melted.

1173
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:27,380
Mind you, there's nothing around that would like shine a light to like melt the camera.

1174
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:32,380
There was like, there's like two little pronged, like melted lines.

1175
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,380
There's nothing or there's no, it was not, it didn't short.

1176
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:40,380
My mom checked the inside of the camera.

1177
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,380
The inside was impeccable.

1178
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:48,380
The outside was melted with nothing nearby that could have caused still, you know, I, I'm not

1179
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:49,380
a dumbass.

1180
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:54,380
I will think of rational explanations for things like, Oh, maybe it was a bug or maybe it was a cat that got it.

1181
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:58,380
Maybe it was a hawk that dropped it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like the, but the mouse.

1182
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:04,380
Um, and then I was sitting and I'm like, maybe there was a piece of glass that like cast a light.

1183
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,380
And I'm like, no, maybe there's like a wire.

1184
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,380
And I'm like, no, maybe there was something.

1185
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:15,380
And I'm like, I can't think my parents couldn't come with, come up with any explanation for it.

1186
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:21,380
And you don't see anybody walking by the camera.

1187
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:26,380
You don't see anything happening around the time before and after it like cut in and out.

1188
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:31,380
Nobody walks up, nobody like comes near, nobody shoots anything at it.

1189
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:38,380
Like it was, and it wasn't like, and it wasn't, it was only the outside.

1190
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:41,380
It was so weird.

1191
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:46,380
But after that, I was like, okay, I'm just not going to talk about it anymore.

1192
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:49,380
And now me and me and the fair cool, we're chill, we're chill.

1193
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,380
I learned about them, they learn about me.

1194
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,380
I get, I leave them alone.

1195
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,380
And now my mom, it's so funny.

1196
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:00,380
I know they love my mom's garden because my mom has so much fucking fairy stuff around.

1197
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,380
My mom's like a green which doesn't even know it.

1198
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,380
My mom is freakishly good at growing things.

1199
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:11,380
She has a lot of, damn the fade did not like the camera.

1200
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,380
They did not.

1201
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,380
You laugh like it's a casual.

1202
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:16,380
Well, I just have to laugh it off, you know.

1203
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:19,380
And yeah, one encounter was enough.

1204
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,380
The second one I was terrified.

1205
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:25,380
My mom has like lots of little fairy houses like in her garden.

1206
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,380
And they're so, and my mom has like bird houses and stuff.

1207
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:29,380
It's so cute.

1208
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,380
My mom is a beautiful garden.

1209
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:32,380
She does such a good job.

1210
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:39,380
Yeah, it's probably just Brad being a silly goose.

1211
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:41,380
They're telling stories about stories about them now though.

1212
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:42,380
That's a good point.

1213
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:44,380
I was thinking of that as I was saying it.

1214
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:51,380
The candle is flickering a bit, but I kind of, I think it was more like a mutual understanding.

1215
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:57,380
And like, again, I was kind of being disrespectful when I told the story the first time.

1216
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:01,380
I'm like, can you believe this silly stuff that happened, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1217
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,380
And so it was just like a warning.

1218
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:07,380
It was just kind of like respect us or respect you sort of thing.

1219
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,380
Um, yeah, they're chill now.

1220
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,380
They're chill now.

1221
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:18,380
There's nothing has happened since aliens could be aliens.

1222
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:21,380
Aliens.

1223
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:22,380
Okay, let's finish this.

1224
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:24,380
But how much time has passed 733?

1225
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:30,380
Oh my God.

1226
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:33,380
Many will not survive the winter.

1227
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,380
It was me.

1228
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,380
It was even of you guys.

1229
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,380
Ancient aliens.

1230
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,380
Um, okay.

1231
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,380
So back to this.

1232
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,380
Let's see.

1233
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,380
Let's see.

1234
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,380
Everyone's married yet?

1235
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:43,380
Let's do.

1236
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,380
Okay.

1237
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:17,380
I'm going to put in some cinnamon for healing.

1238
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:19,380
I never watched the ancient magus bride.

1239
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:25,380
I wanted to watch that put in some cinnamon is very, very good for you.

1240
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:32,380
This in general, a lot of the stuff I'm putting in literally has this like normal anti-inflammatory

1241
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,380
like medicinal properties.

1242
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:40,380
Like that's why tea is so good for you.

1243
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:43,380
I wish Americans drank more tea to be honest.

1244
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:57,380
I wish we were like Britain and China and Japan and Korea and India in terms of drinking tea.

1245
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:02,380
Yeah, don't don't do the cinnamon challenge.

1246
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,380
Those are places that drink a lot of tea.

1247
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,380
What can I tell you?

1248
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,380
Coffee is good.

1249
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:12,380
I'm going to put some star anise in there for some good luck.

1250
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,380
I feel like it's missing.

1251
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:17,380
Oh, rose petals.

1252
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:23,380
Which Toma, I pulled the tower upright the other day.

1253
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:27,380
I generally, I wish I did I take a picture of the reading?

1254
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:28,380
I hope I did.

1255
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:30,380
I have to look at it because I want you to look at the cards.

1256
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:33,380
Did I?

1257
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:39,380
I don't know because I couldn't take a picture.

1258
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,380
Oh, wait.

1259
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,380
No, no, no.

1260
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,380
I didn't shuffle these yet.

1261
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,380
The cards are actually on top.

1262
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:45,380
The ones that I pulled.

1263
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:47,380
I'll show you guys really.

1264
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,380
I'm fine.

1265
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:54,380
I don't know what the tower was about to be honest with you.

1266
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,380
I'm okay.

1267
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:59,380
I dropped my keys down an elevator shaft, but like it's fine.

1268
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:02,380
Like I'll get them back eventually.

1269
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,380
Tower upright is not particularly good.

1270
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:05,380
Here.

1271
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:06,380
I'll show you.

1272
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,380
So I pulled these cards.

1273
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:12,380
I know it's these ones.

1274
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,380
Nope.

1275
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,380
It was.

1276
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,380
No, it wasn't the wait.

1277
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:19,380
Wasn't the fool?

1278
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:20,380
No.

1279
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,380
Because the fool was on the bottom is this one.

1280
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,380
Yes.

1281
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,380
Okay.

1282
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:27,380
So I pulled the queen of cups.

1283
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:30,380
I pulled page of cups.

1284
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:34,380
Um, is that upright or was that?

1285
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:38,380
I'm trying to remember if it's reverse or not.

1286
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:44,380
Page of cups in reverse tower upright and then 10 of cups upright.

1287
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,380
It was very ice.

1288
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,380
I generally still don't know what it means.

1289
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,380
Sorry.

1290
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,380
This is the bottom of the deck.

1291
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:56,380
That's why it's on top because I was showing you guys.

1292
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:59,380
I don't even change.

1293
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,380
Yeah.

1294
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,380
I was just like, what does that mean?

1295
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:05,380
So you guys can't see shit.

1296
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,380
So queen of cups.

1297
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:09,380
I feel like that's representing me.

1298
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,380
Page of cups.

1299
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:15,380
Um, so I feel, I haven't really been like, I haven't really been practicing.

1300
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:19,380
Um, so I feel like that was telling me like get back into my practice, which is kind of

1301
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,380
why I wanted to do the submarine.

1302
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:21,380
Then I got the tower.

1303
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,380
I love it.

1304
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,380
How it looks.

1305
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,380
I love the tower.

1306
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:27,380
And then I have 10 of cups.

1307
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:30,380
Maybe that's OBS was sitting while it was.

1308
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,380
It is mercury is in Gatorade.

1309
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:35,380
So technology is not reliable amongst those times.

1310
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:41,380
Um, but the tower card would not tower is major sudden change.

1311
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:44,380
I don't think OBS shitting the bed would do that.

1312
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,380
Maybe the tower comes with it.

1313
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:52,380
She looks like he's going to tell me something.

1314
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,380
I could take a stab later.

1315
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,380
Please do.

1316
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,380
Please do Toma.

1317
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:02,380
Cause I was like, I, I read these immediately and I was like, huh.

1318
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,380
And then another, other than the thought box and I'm like, I need to tell Toma, but I kept forgetting.

1319
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:07,380
Okay.

1320
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:08,380
Let me.

1321
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,380
Okay.

1322
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:16,380
This needs a little bit more rose petals.

1323
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,380
That's what we need.

1324
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:21,380
We need some rose petals in Hibiscus, baby girl rose petals in Hibiscus.

1325
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,380
Let me grab that.

1326
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:41,380
Tell Mercury to get out of the Gatorade.

1327
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,380
Please don't need that.

1328
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,380
It's sometimes changes drastic and uncomfortable.

1329
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,380
We'll leave it at things in happiness.

1330
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:50,380
That's essentially, um, what the tower card is.

1331
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,380
It's like sudden change.

1332
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,380
I can't get this out.

1333
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:56,380
Um, but it's necessary.

1334
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,380
And I'm someone who's averse to change.

1335
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:03,380
I feel like that's just reminding me, like I need to embrace change or I'm not going to go anywhere.

1336
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:07,380
Cause I, I, I generally have something called an adjustment disorder and I'm not shitting you.

1337
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,380
I'm not trying to be quirky girl right now.

1338
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:15,380
I literally was diagnosed with something called adjustment disorder and changes very hard for me.

1339
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:19,380
Um, so like adjusting to being a Vtuber has to be,

1340
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:23,380
adjusting to being a Vtuber has been very interesting because this is my full-time job.

1341
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:43,380
So I think maybe just like, I know this has been a big change to stick with it.

1342
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:49,380
Would a pack of plain white paper with the names of the cards written on them still work for tarot?

1343
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:51,380
Or is a fancy design also part of the magic?

1344
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,380
Uh, yeah.

1345
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:55,380
It's like skins equals wins and CS go and Valorant.

1346
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:57,380
Uh, you have to have nice car.

1347
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,380
No.

1348
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:05,380
Uh, you can honestly, you can buy like a normal writer weight tarot deck for like 10 bucks.

1349
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,380
I like them as a physical store.

1350
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:08,380
So.

1351
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:14,380
You should be fine.

1352
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:18,380
Unless you, if you don't got money, you can try the 70, 78, I think.

1353
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:19,380
I can't remember.

1354
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:23,380
Cards in the deck.

1355
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,380
Pay to win tarot readings.

1356
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:30,380
Once you get, once you prestige, you get better cards.

1357
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:34,380
That's awesome.

1358
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:38,380
Yeah.

1359
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:45,380
You can really, cause I remember I use, uh, I forget what I, cause you can use like a normal deck of playing cards.

1360
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:46,380
Technically.

1361
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,380
Uh, you just won't have the major arcana.

1362
01:38:49,380 --> 01:39:03,380
Um, cause you can use the suits as like club, yeah, club, swords, you know, lawns, hearts, cup, like the, the coincide.

1363
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:05,380
It's all about you with your intuition.

1364
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,380
Exactly.

1365
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:07,380
Exactly.

1366
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,380
It's homo.

1367
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:10,380
Level 99 tarot boss.

1368
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:15,380
Level one psychic level 99 tarot boss.

1369
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:16,380
I sesame flash.

1370
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:17,380
Yes.

1371
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:18,380
Yes.

1372
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:21,380
Toma has done a silly reading for me with the Sesame Street, uh, cards.

1373
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:25,380
It was like, I remember showing me those.

1374
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:28,380
I just pulled a mint tarot deck.

1375
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,380
How much is it worth?

1376
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:33,380
It's like you, you like, it's like factory new tarot deck.

1377
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:35,380
Oh my God.

1378
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:42,380
A, a game that's like CS go, except it's cards that you throw at people and you're like fucking gambit and you got to like.

1379
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:51,380
That can't, that can't look out bigger.

1380
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:53,380
It is wiggling so much.

1381
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:57,380
I think my, I think my spirits are very amused by that.

1382
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:03,380
Um, Hearthstone, Hearthstone, but make it CS go.

1383
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:09,380
Be alert tarot deck when that would be so cool.

1384
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:18,380
If someone, I think someone was working on like a Vtuber tarot deck because I remember seeing like, like iron mouse and stuff.

1385
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,380
Do, do, do.

1386
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,380
Hold on, I'm just reading something.

1387
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,380
Okay.

1388
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,380
That's fine.

1389
01:40:58,380 --> 01:40:59,380
Well, I was knocked out over.

1390
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,380
Yep.

1391
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,380
Turn that off for the ambi.

1392
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:04,380
This looks so cool.

1393
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,380
I'm not going to lie to you.

1394
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,380
This looks so nifty.

1395
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,380
My mall is on the other side because I had to flip my model.

1396
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:12,380
So it doesn't look like I'm like looking the other direction.

1397
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:19,380
Got my four of cups to supreme plus blue eyes.

1398
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,380
She beat attack mode.

1399
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,380
Is it iron mouse?

1400
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:24,380
Yeah.

1401
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:25,380
No, iron mouse.

1402
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:32,380
I think someone like used her as like a sort of, um, in like muse for tarot deck series.

1403
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:33,380
And I, it was pretty cool.

1404
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:34,380
All right.

1405
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,380
So actually let me turn the light back on three, two, one, flashbang.

1406
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,380
So this is the, the jar.

1407
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:53,380
Again, we have a honey, Himalayan salt, peach, um, quartz.

1408
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:54,380
Okay.

1409
01:41:54,380 --> 01:42:02,380
Uh, lavender, Jasmine, cinnamon, star anise, hibiscus, rose petals, rosemary.

1410
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:05,380
Yippee.

1411
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:09,380
That looks pretty good.

1412
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:11,380
I want to eat it.

1413
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,380
I don't recommend that.

1414
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:18,380
The artist is, artists make the tarot deck series of the show, Joe's and artist names.

1415
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:19,380
Oh yeah.

1416
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,380
I think that's them.

1417
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,380
I think that's them.

1418
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:25,380
Ooh.

1419
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:26,380
Hi.

1420
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:27,380
Hi, anybody new?

1421
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:28,380
If you're just wandering in.

1422
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:30,380
La la la.

1423
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,380
Okay.

1424
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:33,380
So now we'll seal this with a kiss.

1425
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,380
I'm going to give it a little kiss as little kisses for you.

1426
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:41,380
We'll kiss for you on the top because I want you to love yourself.

1427
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,380
I want you to grow.

1428
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:45,380
I want you to be amazing and everybody does too.

1429
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:49,380
Everybody look to the person left to you in this chat and tell them how amazing they are

1430
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:51,380
and that they'll do amazing things.

1431
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:52,380
Okay.

1432
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:53,380
Right now.

1433
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,380
And I'm going to seal this.

1434
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,380
I'm going to put this in here.

1435
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:09,380
It has a little bit of the ash from my incense in there.

1436
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:12,380
So I'm just giving you a cheer.

1437
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:17,380
We go light this up like it's dynamite.

1438
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:20,380
I haven't met many people into Wicca or what you're doing.

1439
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:21,380
Sorry, I don't care.

1440
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:23,380
Those who have met are really cool people.

1441
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,380
Yeah.

1442
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:25,380
No, I'm not.

1443
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:26,380
I'm not Wiccan.

1444
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,380
I'm just me.

1445
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:28,380
You're amazing friend.

1446
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,380
Yeah.

1447
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,380
Yeah.

1448
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:31,380
Everybody.

1449
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,380
Yeah.

1450
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:33,380
Everybody tell each other how amazing they are and cool.

1451
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:36,380
Man, I searched the Vaude and found no pedicure toes show off.

1452
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:37,380
Please help.

1453
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:40,380
Did you really go back and look for the Vaude?

1454
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,380
It's really there.

1455
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:42,380
I don't know what the timestamp is.

1456
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:43,380
I'm sorry, bro.

1457
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,380
Please.

1458
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,380
Can you burn?

1459
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,380
I need you to melt.

1460
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:11,380
You have to accidentally melt it on the thing.

1461
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,380
I should have cut this.

1462
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:32,380
I think I have a pink candle.

1463
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:37,380
That's not the first time I've done that.

1464
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:39,380
Can I cut this?

1465
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:41,380
I do this instead.

1466
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:47,380
Oh, you know what I actually have?

1467
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:54,380
I actually have ceiling wax that I bought and I don't know why I bought it, but I was

1468
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:55,380
like, let me buy this.

1469
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:57,380
And I think I know why now.

1470
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:07,380
I literally went to the store when I was getting the wood beads for the witch stuff.

1471
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:16,380
And I literally got just a, I don't know why I got this.

1472
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:25,380
What's ceiling wax?

1473
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:27,380
Sealing like we're sealing something.

1474
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:30,380
We're closing it.

1475
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:32,380
Maybe you got it for what?

1476
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:33,380
Why?

1477
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,380
Who am I doing what?

1478
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:38,380
Am I just going to burn myself with wax by myself?

1479
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:40,380
That's boring.

1480
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:41,380
No.

1481
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:50,380
The wax is dripping from this candle.

1482
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:53,380
I think she be falls into the Empress card roll, but she's going to involve into something

1483
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:54,380
more.

1484
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:58,380
I identify with the, um, what's it called?

1485
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:00,380
I'm going to use the gold wax.

1486
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:07,380
I identify with the magician.

1487
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:13,380
Oh, because I have been told I am a master.

1488
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:21,380
Um, there's a, oh my guys, there's a freaking, I couldn't remember what the, it's a bee.

1489
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:23,380
It's a bee and a flower.

1490
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,380
And I put honey in it.

1491
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:31,380
Guys, this was meant.

1492
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:32,380
That's so funny.

1493
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:36,380
Do you want the bee or do you want the flower?

1494
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:42,380
Dark magician for letters to pen pals.

1495
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:46,380
You want to be, you want a busy bee?

1496
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:47,380
All right.

1497
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,380
BB bee.

1498
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:49,380
All right.

1499
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,380
BB.

1500
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:51,380
I don't know.

1501
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:54,380
I'm just going to, it's going to be like a really weird looking bee on top, but you

1502
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:56,380
know, we got it.

1503
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:58,380
All right.

1504
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:02,380
Let's use the gold cause gold for that wealth, baby.

1505
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:05,380
You got a little purple in there for stuff.

1506
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:06,380
All right.

1507
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:08,380
Why is this like slanted?

1508
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:14,380
Well, cause there's already wax that have melted in here from a long time ago.

1509
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:17,380
I should probably cut this.

1510
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:19,380
I'm nothing to cut it with.

1511
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:27,380
Wait.

1512
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:30,380
I have a knife.

1513
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:35,380
This is very, this is very GRIK.

1514
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:38,380
I use this for cutting boxes.

1515
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:39,380
Okay.

1516
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:47,380
I don't know.

1517
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,380
It's working.

1518
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:57,380
I don't know if this is working.

1519
01:47:57,380 --> 01:48:00,380
I think it is.

1520
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:01,380
It's not.

1521
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:05,380
This is not sharp enough.

1522
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:13,380
I don't feel like getting up to get scissors.

1523
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:16,380
Let me go away.

1524
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,380
Mommy's cutting stuff.

1525
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,380
Mommy doesn't want to accidentally cut you.

1526
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:22,380
Please don't jump on my lap.

1527
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:26,380
You look like you're looking at it.

1528
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:35,380
I'm halfway there, guys.

1529
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:36,380
Careful.

1530
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:37,380
She's got him.

1531
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:38,380
What's that?

1532
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:39,380
A knife.

1533
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:40,380
No.

1534
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:45,380
Again, my spiritual team is amused.

1535
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:53,380
The flame be dancing.

1536
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:59,380
Why is this like, stay?

1537
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:05,380
Why is he doing that?

1538
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:10,380
I did it.

1539
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:14,380
We gonna light this up like it's dying.

1540
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:17,380
Oh, my.

1541
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:20,380
Boomi's playing with something under my desk.

1542
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:22,380
What are you playing with?

1543
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,380
Boomi, don't go in the trash.

1544
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:25,380
What are you doing?

1545
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:27,380
Hi, handsome.

1546
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:29,380
What are you doing?

1547
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:32,380
Did you bring your spring over here?

1548
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:33,380
You did.

1549
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:36,380
Why did you do that?

1550
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:40,380
I'm not gonna throw it because then you're gonna want to bring it back.

1551
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,380
Bring it back now, y'all.

1552
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:49,380
I'm off this time.

1553
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:53,380
Did I cut it too short?

1554
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:56,380
Whoa, this is so fancy looking.

1555
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,380
It's like I've never had like actual wax before.

1556
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:01,380
I've only ever used like candles to seal stuff.

1557
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:07,380
This is gonna be so gorgeous to look at.

1558
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:16,380
This might take a while.

1559
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:28,380
Don't you burn out on me?

1560
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:40,380
I think I cut it too short.

1561
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:42,380
This is so fancy, guys.

1562
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:45,380
I'm gonna make it so dribbles.

1563
01:50:45,380 --> 01:51:01,380
A little bit of dribble in there.

1564
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:26,380
I can't tell what it looks like from the side.

1565
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:33,380
Okay, I think that's properly sealed.

1566
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:36,380
I love that it's sealed with a gold.

1567
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:52,380
Oh, it's so pretty.

1568
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:55,380
Ooh, that candle's going crazy.

1569
01:51:55,380 --> 01:52:02,380
Did you guys see that over there?

1570
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:05,380
Someone is falling apart right now.

1571
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:08,380
Someone's sad.

1572
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:11,380
Who is it?

1573
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:13,380
Who's very sad?

1574
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:25,380
Okay, let's put the bee.

1575
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:31,380
Now sit on it.

1576
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,380
Making it dribble a little.

1577
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:37,380
Dribble for the aesthetic, you know.

1578
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:40,380
And bees are a hive and they take care of each other.

1579
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:41,380
And that's what we're gonna do.

1580
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:47,380
We're gonna all take care of each other.

1581
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:53,380
Mm-hmm.

1582
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:55,380
Yep, yep, yep.

1583
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:57,380
Yep, yep.

1584
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:59,380
Yippie-dee-dub.

1585
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:08,380
Ooh, spooky.

1586
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:15,380
Flashbang.

1587
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:17,380
Okay, I turned it down to the lightest setting,

1588
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:20,380
so it still looks on beyond so we can still see what's going on.

1589
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:22,380
Crying in the club.

1590
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,380
Hey guys, minor problem.

1591
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:26,380
How do you stick a 5-inch long 1-inch dinosaur in there?

1592
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:32,380
It cannot be damaged from wax.

1593
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:34,380
What? That looks so cool.

1594
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:38,380
Yo, yo.

1595
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:39,380
It's a little bee.

1596
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:41,380
I should have moved it down, but it's still really cool.

1597
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:43,380
If it could focus.

1598
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:47,380
Focusing it.

1599
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:49,380
What the hell is going on outside?

1600
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,380
Anyways, the bee is there.

1601
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,380
You can see it.

1602
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:54,380
Spell jar.

1603
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:56,380
Ladies and gentlemen, the spell jar has been made.

1604
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:59,380
The intention has been sealed and set.

1605
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:05,380
And now it's going to go on my altar.

1606
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:06,380
That's it.

1607
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:07,380
What do you guys think?

1608
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:08,380
What do you...

1609
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:11,380
Successful self-love and growth?

1610
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:21,380
You know, I think it's pretty good.

1611
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:22,380
I think it's pretty nice.

1612
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:23,380
I don't know why the...

1613
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:25,380
It's so yellow.

1614
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:31,380
Because of the saturation I put on it.

1615
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:32,380
We did it.

1616
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:33,380
Yeah.

1617
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:34,380
Ice emo.

1618
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:37,380
We did it.

1619
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:39,380
Looks like claws gripping.

1620
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:42,380
Oh my God, you're right.

1621
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:43,380
That's kind of cool.

1622
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:50,380
All right, I'm going to put that up there.

1623
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:51,380
That was pretty cool.

1624
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:52,380
What the hell?

1625
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:57,380
I'm so happy I got this.

1626
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:58,380
I don't know.

1627
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:01,380
Get back in the box, bitch.

1628
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:03,380
Where am I going to put this?

1629
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,380
I have to find a place to put this.

1630
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:09,380
Maybe I'll put in the box with my jars.

1631
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:12,380
My jar box.

1632
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:16,380
Jar, maybe.

1633
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:17,380
That's really cool.

1634
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:19,380
I'm so happy I got that.

1635
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:21,380
Now to go Campbell.

1636
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:22,380
No, that's...

1637
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:24,380
It wasn't a wealth or luck thing.

1638
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:27,380
It was just self-love and growth.

1639
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:34,380
Okay.

1640
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:36,380
What am I doing?

1641
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:42,380
What the hell are we?

1642
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:44,380
I can catch some super full moon.

1643
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:48,380
Yeah, we're getting that super full moon power.

1644
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:52,380
We love it when you put this stuff away.

1645
01:55:52,380 --> 01:56:00,380
It's going to be fun cleaning this up later.

1646
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:29,380
Okay.

1647
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:35,380
Put that up here.

1648
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:40,380
Thank you very much.

1649
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:44,380
And then the remnants I used for a spell I throw outside.

1650
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:52,380
I return it back to the earth.

1651
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:55,380
So I'm going to go through this upside.

1652
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:59,380
I'm going to go throw it off my balcony and hope that it hits somebody in the head.

1653
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:00,380
Get blessed.

1654
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:02,380
Get blessed for real, for real.

1655
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:03,380
Eat them.

1656
01:57:03,380 --> 01:57:05,380
I'm good.

1657
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:08,380
I don't think so.

1658
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:10,380
What are you doing here?

1659
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:11,380
Oh, you napped it.

1660
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:14,380
Oh, you can get hurt.

1661
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:33,380
It's so pretty on that one.

1662
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:49,380
Nothing like the door frames don't fit.

1663
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:52,380
My doors don't close properly.

1664
01:57:52,380 --> 01:58:08,380
Okay.

1665
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:13,380
All right, folks, we are going to take a quick intervention.

1666
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:18,380
Intermission so I can use the rest room.

1667
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
I'll be back in five minutes.

1668
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:22,380
I'm going to put on my BRB screen.

1669
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:26,380
Make sure you get up, stretch your legs, hydrate, get a snacky poo.

1670
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,380
Then we will be getting into the tarot.

1671
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:32,380
I will pin a message saying how much the tarot will be reading.

1672
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:37,380
The tarot will be and what to put in to your request.

1673
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:41,380
So donate $5 and what your question is.

1674
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:45,380
I'll probably only take a couple of people, not a lot.

1675
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:47,380
We'll do it for the next hour.

1676
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:51,380
And I think that sounds pretty reasonable.

1677
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:53,380
What do you think?

1678
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,380
Yeah.

1679
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:55,380
Yeah.

1680
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:56,380
Okay.

1681
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:58,380
Five.

1682
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:28,380
Five.

1683
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,380
Five.

1684
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:30,380
Five.

1685
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:31,380
Five.

1686
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:32,380
Five.

1687
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:33,380
Five.

1688
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:34,380
Five.

1689
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:35,380
Five.

1690
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,380
Five.

1691
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:37,380
Five.

2098
02:06:53,420 --> 02:07:06,460
it's sad like it's sad Keanu Reeves dripping down sad. I'm gonna have to replace that candle soon

2099
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:11,980
it's gonna go out. Don't worry it doesn't mean people are done or I just like

2100
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:19,580
heck somebody or anything don't worry. Wait you didn't leave the flame on right? What do you mean?

2101
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:24,140
You were sad I was gone. Maybe. I mean I'm panicking a bit.

2102
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:37,180
Me lost without the toes. Okay let me put my headphone in. Can we eat the candle? You can try.

2103
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:42,140
I can I can break you off a little piece. Here you go let me.

2104
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:50,620
That's for you girly pop. Wanna want a snack? Come on take a little bite.

2105
02:07:53,980 --> 02:08:07,740
Oh oh oh oh okay oh oh you actually ate it. Well what can you do? What can you do? Take a sip of my water.

2106
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:19,660
Ah delicious. All right I can't rub my hands together with these things on.

2107
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:29,660
Let me get into the most optimum position. This is too close.

2108
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:37,500
I think it was better where it was. How did I have this before? I had it like this.

2109
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:48,140
I had it like see it's on fire. It looks like it but I assure you it's not.

2110
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:57,900
All right just like that. We're gonna do it just like that and I'm kidding I'm just gonna keep it the way it was.

2111
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:06,620
I don't know how I did this before. How I did the terrarium the first time.

2112
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:17,980
I am going to move this first of all. Trying not to knock stuff down.

2113
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:22,540
Just get this stuff out of the way. Labradorite. Labradorite's for me.

2114
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:30,060
Okay let me put up the terms and conditions.

2115
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:53,340
I'm sorry grounding myself again. I'm gonna cleanse again.

2116
02:09:56,860 --> 02:10:04,620
I will probably do Icy's tarot like for her by herself. Um like personally send her something

2117
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:08,780
because I'm not gonna read her tarot when she's not here.

2118
02:10:12,140 --> 02:10:15,980
Unless she's here. Icy are you with us? No she's she's she's knocked out.

2119
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:32,300
Um let me do deals. So

2120
02:10:39,580 --> 02:10:43,660
I should make like 50 bucks. Don't ask why I'm holding a rose.

2121
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:51,980
First five people to send me 50 dollars. No I'm kidding. No no no no no no.

2122
02:10:54,460 --> 02:11:06,300
Read my ratot. Based ratot.

2123
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:26,300
Okay.

02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:36,300
Your reimbursement went through so it's all profit now. Why are you holding a rose?

2125
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:42,300
All right.

2126
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:50,220
I'm gonna do a general reading for all of us. Don't you worry.

2127
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:56,940
Then I'll do specific what the fuck is with the camera. Then I'll do specific readings for peoples.

2128
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:08,300
Whoa. She's crazy. Ratatouille. Ratatouille then.

2129
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:23,660

Steal your mom's credit card to get a get a psychic reading from your favorite Oshi ladies and gentlemen.

2143
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:06,940
Anonymous. I'm a Scorpio. I got divorced at the end of last year. What's it? Oh sweetheart. Oh

2144
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:15,100
oh I just got hit with a wave of emotion from from your spiritual team. Holy

2145
02:14:16,060 --> 02:14:21,740
shit. Oh that was rough. That was a rough divorce. Oh shit it was not amicable at all I could tell.

2146
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:29,980
Okay okay stop tipping. I'm cutting it off. I'm cutting it off. No more tips. No more tips.

2147
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:41,900
Remove. I was donating a super chat. Well it's stream elements is in the description.

2148
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:47,660
Is super amicable we still live together? Okay then I was wrong.

2149
02:14:53,900 --> 02:15:00,140
I see like I can say when I'm wrong. I can say when I'm full of shit. I don't know why I got a wave of

2150
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:05,100
emotion but something's painful you know.

2151
02:15:13,660 --> 02:15:18,140
Emily. Hi Shibi. I would like a reading which is an overview of September. I'm a Pisces. Okay Emily

2152
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:22,460
could do that for you. No one's special. Aquarius. Recently I made a major financial decision not

2153
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:29,580
I don't want to. Can you change your question because I don't want to give you stuff on money

2154
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:38,060
because I don't like doing money stuff. As you can see I said they had a hard

2155
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:41,180
divorce and that wasn't true so who knows if I'm correct.

2156
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:49,980
You're from your own divorce.

2157
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:58,780
Well maybe that belonged to somebody else. Was it you Dr. P? Did you have a non amicable divorce?

2158
02:16:00,460 --> 02:16:01,100
So sad.

2159
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:11,900
Okay maybe it was you because you donated first. Who knows?

2160
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:15,100
Shibi do I bet on all red or black? All red.

2161
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:22,940
Emily, just big telling of future. Yes the spirits are not very good at timing the

2162
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:27,980
market. Someone on the other side of the world dealing with the rough divorce. Why do I feel

2163
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:35,100
like I've been seen? Again when you do this you don't have to believe in it.

2164
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:41,340
I'm not always right. You can take it with you although it's funny because when I do the cards

2165
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:46,460
I'm always right. Going off of my own personal intuition I'm not always right. My gut feelings

2166
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:51,740
are not correct most of the time. But yeah let's let's let's chat with the cards instead.

2167
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:58,860
Red. Life savings all in red. Yes. It's still staying cheat sheet. Okay that might have been you then.

2168
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:13,180
Okay let's do that. Cool. I'll do the sixth person that snuck in because I feel bad. They

2169
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:17,180
like don't need it at the same time as um as I was reading stuff.

2170
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:23,580
Sketchy witch gives you a tarot reading ASMR.

2171
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:32,380
All right so first I'm gonna do a general reading for everybody.

2172
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:35,820
Beep beep beep beep beep beep.

2173
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:44,620
Me clings my thick. Let me clings my thick.

2174
02:17:47,260 --> 02:17:52,860
This wasn't really helpful. Where's my lighter because the little other thing wasn't really

2175
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:58,380
working. Where did I put it? Am I blind? You guys see it on my desk? I'm blind.

2176
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:00,380
I

2177
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:03,140
Ever get where I put things like the majority of the time

2178
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:08,540
Like I just saw some stuff. I was looking for my nail clippers

2179
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:15,800
And they're on my desk and I just remembered I used them when I was making the gunpla and I've been looking for them

2180
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:17,800
I don't remember anything

2181
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:25,220
Taser time

2182
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:32,980
It tastes good taste good taste doesn't that really work well for this

2183
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:41,180
It just gave up

2184
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:47,460
Go on sis give me nothing with this

2185
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:56,700
This kind of fun to do I feel like I'm soldering something there we go

2186
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:03,620
Wait, I can't see the chat

2187
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:15,820
Not sure how to best for this not necessarily looking for money answers just this isn't deeply the face of why they're not

2188
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:20,460
I'll try my best

2189
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:30,540
It's gonna be funny

2190
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:35,180
Vod watchers are gonna see the part or I'm just like it was you had a terrible divorce

2191
02:19:35,180 --> 02:19:37,180
I just burned myself um

2192
02:19:37,380 --> 02:19:42,340
And then the bright guys gonna be like nah, and they'll be like so she was full of shit this entire

2193
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:46,420
I was believing her up until that moment. It's gonna be funny as hell

2194
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:50,740
Again, you can take what I say with a grain of salt. You don't believe

2195
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:59,300
This is a sun and moon give up different energies in this practice. Yeah, this moon is kind of like

2196
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:03,980
Your emotional side and the sun is kind of like your outward self

2197
02:20:05,220 --> 02:20:07,220
That's like kind of with your moon and your

2198
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:11,380
Pain adds power

2199
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:16,380
This is hard to be hard to shuffle with these stupid things in my hands

2200
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:32,340
Can you not play over here mommy's working mommy's trying to connect with the spirits

2201
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:49,980
I

2202
02:20:58,180 --> 02:21:00,180
Sorry

2203
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:05,540
Had a vision I'm kidding

2204
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:10,940
I'm just I was again centering myself and kind of just like mentally preparing myself for readings

2205
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:17,620
They're like why does she just like stand sit there men is singly. I can't shuffle cool

2206
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:24,900
That's not she me

2207
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:29,980
It's a future that's so she I can't even I don't remember the that's what Raven theme song

2208
02:21:30,100 --> 02:21:36,300
That's so she be it's the future she can see. Oh, she doesn't predict the end of the world

2209
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,300
No

2210
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:47,180
The future is always changing if you're watching this right now, you're energetically

2211
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:51,980
Aligned with me and the spirits and now you will

2212
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:59,420
You were meant to see this this remember that that that vine I posted that fine the tick tock

2213
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:05,260
I posted of that dude. That's me right now. I have I got my light skin eyes on I got my blue eyes

02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,260
Watch me to focus

2220
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:41,260
Time here is convoluted

2221
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:46,860
Yeah

2222
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:53,580
Okay, here's a general reading for everybody. What can we look forward to for the next let's say

2223

Finances

2228
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:18,140
Do you're reading for Fia? Oh, no, she will she get better financially? She's great. She doesn't pay anything

2229
02:23:18,140 --> 02:23:22,200
Oh my god guys. Guess what by the way with Fia. Well, you guys are freaking it out

2230
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:29,740
She was able to drink water by herself today, I didn't have to I didn't have the bottle here and

2231
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:36,780
She's kicking her back legs and she can twist her front body and I'm so happy. She's getting better

2232
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:39,460
By finances

2233
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:43,180
Are you guys gay? Are you guys turning gay? All right, we'll do her reading

2234
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:46,740
Are the harlots turning gay?

Months sounds good. All right, let's do let's do month

2236

Three cards general month. Wait, can I delete?

Common Fia dub. Yep, she's great. She's she's doing amazing

2242
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:32,460
What should we know? What should we meditate on? What should we reflect on?

2243
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:38,460
What do we need to know for the month of September for the beginning of the fall?

2244
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:47,300
With the best intentions you would like answer I need to like move my arm under the camera wire because I'm gonna knock the camera over

2245
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:53,900
I

2246
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:03,380
Swear did temperance come out last time I did the reading on the Tamagotchi stream

2247
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:09,300
What's my arcana

2248
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:16,340
It did interesting, okay, it looks like we have a common theme

2249
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:25,940
I might have to look back at that and see what I see what I pulled for that

2250
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:34,300
This is very hard to shuffle with these freaking weird glove things on and these

2251
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:47,100
All right

2252
02:25:51,900 --> 02:25:53,900
I

2253
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:08,340
Didn't I see someone in the chat go please not death please not

2254
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,340
Oh

2255
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:17,660
It's funny

2256
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:23,220
No, no, this is a good spread. This is a good good spread. This is a good spread

2257
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:25,540
and

2258
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:29,820
Then it would also pop those eight of ones. I think that means something, but I don't think it's relevant or you know

2259
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:34,180
Death is not bad

2260
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:36,180
I'll explain

2261
02:26:36,500 --> 02:26:37,740
So

2262
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:44,740
We have a very good spread here for the month of September ladies and gentlemen. I'm pretty positive about this

2263
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:49,660
So we have temperance

2264
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:57,020
Beautiful card gorgeous gorgeous we have ten of pentacles

2265
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:02,540
Gorgeous gorgeous

2266
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:06,180
I'm trying to find out where the freaking camera is

2267
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:13,180
Are these people just chilling that's you

2268
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:18,020
The person who posts for those pictures in this chat what?

2269
02:27:19,860 --> 02:27:25,260
Then we have death upright also a very gorgeous card

2270
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:31,300
It's funny this kind of reminds me of the the wheel of fortune

2271
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:35,220
And then you have the faces of the moon very interesting

2272
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:39,900
Death that's me

2273
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:41,900
Yeah, because it's not your chair

2274
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:46,380
I said this is a general reading for all of us death is not a bad thing guys

2275
02:27:46,980 --> 02:27:53,220
Everybody there's the death card has a bad rap. Okay. That's not it's not a bad thing

2276
02:27:55,700 --> 02:27:57,700
Is that the grim weeper

2277
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:05,180
Okay, so this is for everybody I'm gonna get into the ones that people paid for after this

2278
02:28:06,380 --> 02:28:08,380
You're not dying

2279
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:12,300
Yes, I don't like ten or nine of swords is

2280
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:15,100
both

2281
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:18,300
So temperance

2282
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:26,420
Represents balance harmony healing patients self-control moderation purpose peace calm tranquility and serenity

2283
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:34,820
Ten of pentacles represents dynasty leaving a legacy inheritance wealth financial security long-term success

2284
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:38,500
roots family ancestry privilege affluence

2285
02:28:41,820 --> 02:28:47,580
Death represents symbolic death and rebirth big changes time to move on transformation

2286
02:28:48,220 --> 02:28:51,060
Transition endings letting go release starting anew

2287
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:55,420
My candle getting real happy

2288
02:28:57,700 --> 02:28:59,700
She bright um

2289
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,740
My chest is itchy

2290
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:11,620
So

2291
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:18,220
Again, so temperance is a common is a continuous theme that was in my last reading that I did in my tomagotchi stream

2292
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:24,620
And I think this is just reminding us to stay on the path of just like balancing our emotions

2293
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:27,660
Um, you know just

2294
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:31,660
Pouring so cups usually represent emotions

2295
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:38,320
So you can see this person is pouring into another cup. She is also very enlightened. She's an angel

2296
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:43,300
Um, I feel like this is your spiritual team reminding you to kind of like

2297
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:50,220
Offload your burdens on to others like you might feel like your burdens on but like I think you need to vent a little bit you can

2298
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:57,540
Kind of building stuff up and that can lead to an explosion and that's not there's there's no harmony in that

2299
02:29:57,540 --> 02:30:01,060
So and also you need to be able to heal. So if you'd be able to like talk to somebody

2300
02:30:01,900 --> 02:30:08,060
Kind of attain that emotional balance kind of like not keep everything. You're so weighed down

2301
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:11,340
So it's time to open up

2302
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:15,820
You also, you know continue to practice self-control a month of September

2303
02:30:17,220 --> 02:30:19,220
You just be like

2304
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:25,220
The overarching theme we're gonna be calm. We're gonna be awesome. We're gonna be serene. We're gonna be chilling

2305
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:27,860
we're gonna be

2306
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:30,100
Yeah, just attaining that sense of balance just

2307
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:35,300
You know, I'm surprised the justice card didn't stand up with the scales and just be like, yeah

2308
02:30:37,460 --> 02:30:39,700
I'm gonna vent to my mirror but honestly

2309
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:47,060
Like that's not a bad like if you have no one to vent to like kind of just do some emotional

2310
02:30:48,020 --> 02:30:50,500
Um, so like what is

2311
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:56,900
Really good you can you know, I probably did this in like school because I remember doing this in school when I was younger

2312
02:30:56,900 --> 02:31:02,900
You know, how you would like write a bunch of words like crazy and you would just like I think they like used it for like

2313
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:09,140
Writing prompts and you would just like put a bunch of ideas down that was like your your brainstorm or whatever the fuck they called it in school

2314
02:31:09,580 --> 02:31:11,340
So writing your thoughts down

2315
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:17,340
But then like tear them up and let them go or like set them on fire because everybody loves flames. Am I right?

2316
02:31:17,820 --> 02:31:19,820
um

2317
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:22,300
I think you should kind of

2318
02:31:22,460 --> 02:31:26,460
And I think that has to do with the death card too because this is letting go moving on that's like I'll get to that though

2319
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:28,780
so I feel like

2320
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:30,940
You need to do some emotional

2321
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:33,580
like

2322
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:37,580
Removing of weight from yourself like you've been carrying a lot

2323
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:41,660
Um, and I think that's good that we do that self-love jar. I think that's applicable here

2324
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:45,180
Yeah fire is cool. Um

2325
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:50,140
Yeah, shout out a tree shout into the go touch grass and I don't mean like touch grass like

2326
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:53,580
like internet touch grass like there's um

2327
02:31:54,700 --> 02:32:00,780
Literally something you could do could just like go barefoot outside if the weather is good and just kind of sit with yourself

2328
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:03,740
And kind of let yourself feel feel the earth

2329
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:07,180
Feel the dirt between your toes feel the grass

2330
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:10,300
Feel the little wetness in your pants

2331
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:16,140
Because you're accidentally sat on a wet spot or do you pee yourself? Whatever help you know floats your boat

2332
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:18,780
um

2333
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:21,100
Candles twitching um

2334
02:32:21,820 --> 02:32:24,540
Just connect with nature, but like let yourself feel

2335
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:27,820
I think like I had a good cry

2336
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:33,100
Like yesterday for no reason because I'm like I feel like I had been bottling stuff up

2337
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:38,540
Because sometimes you just need to cry like I'm like I don't even know I'm crying but like sometimes you just need to

2338
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:41,580
Just cry bro. I'm just like

2339
02:32:41,740 --> 02:32:44,700
Be a real man and cry real man cry. That's all I'm gonna say

2340
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:53,980
What if you don't know how to cry, I don't know look at like dead puppies or something. Okay, you know through that

2341
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:56,780
Don't do that

2342
02:32:56,780 --> 02:32:58,780
um

2343
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:05,900
What the heck I was like

2344
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:09,420
What is that it's a bug

2345
02:33:10,300 --> 02:33:14,140
It's not a bug ladies and gentlemen. It is not a bug just a just a piece of dirt

2346
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:17,180
um

2347
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:20,140
Yeah, don't bottle stuff up or you're gonna explode

2348
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:22,940
All right, 10 of pentacles

2349
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:29,740
Uh, so wealth financial security success. I feel like if you have any project, whoa

2350
02:33:30,700 --> 02:33:32,700
What's going on with you candle?

2351
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:36,220
You going crazy over there. So I guess this means paying attention

2352
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:38,940
um

2353
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:43,180
If you have

2354
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:45,740
Any sort of projects that you've been

2355
02:33:47,180 --> 02:33:50,700
Working on or feel like I feel like those will kind of pan out for you

2356
02:33:51,580 --> 02:33:52,140
um

2357
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:56,540
This also has to do with like dynasty and family connect with your family

2358
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:58,620
uh

2359
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:02,460
And this doesn't have to be like your blood related family like people who work again

2360
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:05,820
I get with the pouring out of emotions. I feel like you just need to hang out with people

2361
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:08,300
Go and hang out with people the month of september

2362
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:12,460
Uh, I don't know if you guys like if you're american

2363
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:16,460
September apple picking go apple picking with your family

2364
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:21,020
Go do false stuff with your go have a pumpkin spice latte

2365
02:34:21,660 --> 02:34:24,460
With someone with a close friend that you consider

2366
02:34:25,100 --> 02:34:27,100
I don't know like a sibling

2367
02:34:28,060 --> 02:34:32,300
I imagine she'd be graduating the waterworks with flow. Um

2368
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:36,060
Go uh

2369
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:40,460
Yeah, connect with your family connect with your history because this is dynasty

2370
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:43,820
I feel like you might like find some cool stuff about yourself

2371
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:46,860
If you like ask a family member or like do some research

2372
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:50,460
In like a library or like, I don't know where you can do research on your family

2373
02:34:50,780 --> 02:34:53,820
I don't know do some like self-discovery of like history and stuff

2374
02:34:53,820 --> 02:34:58,860
I feel like like that'll be important for some of like if someone who's been interested in about their past

2375
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:01,500
Uh, I think that applies to you

2376
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:02,620
um

2377
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:05,340
But yes, I think just spending time with family

2378
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:08,140
Like spend time with your little sister emmy, you know

2379
02:35:08,860 --> 02:35:10,860
spend time with your little sister

2380
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:17,820
With your little sister. I see spend time with me your big sister spend time with your mom Missouri spend time with your

2381
02:35:18,780 --> 02:35:20,780
your

2382
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:24,220
I was like your cousin shrani your cousin mercy

2383
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:30,460
Go if your english go biscuit picking. Oh my god

2384
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:35,100
Aunt straw me your cool aunt straw me

2385
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:43,660
Um, but yeah like to spend time. I think like kind of connecting with people will be essential

2386
02:35:44,860 --> 02:35:46,060
um

2387
02:35:46,060 --> 02:35:48,780
The month of september go to your roots

2388
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:54,300
I think you might gain some knowledge from like I feel like you should connect with older ones

2389
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:58,060
Because there's many different generations in this picture. There's like young

2390
02:35:58,860 --> 02:36:00,860
teenager

2391
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:04,380
Adult and like an older gentleman in here

2392
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:10,380
I feel like maybe kind of connecting with people of all ages in your family or like someone older that might have some wisdom

2393
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:13,660
might be super prevalent the month of september for some of you

2394
02:36:14,460 --> 02:36:16,300
um

2395
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:19,260
Also says privilege check your privilege. No, I'm kidding. Um

2396
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:25,340
But yeah, so somebody might have some advice for you or like just tell you something that you really needed to hear

2397
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:29,740
You know like someone just it just hits just right

2398
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:35,100
I think that's necessary. Um, I don't but it says wealth and financial security

2399
02:36:35,100 --> 02:36:39,420
So maybe you'll make some better financial decisions, but that means like don't be impulsive and stuff, you know

2400
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:42,220
um, but yeah

2401
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:44,540
Say psych

2402
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:46,540
Strani's definitely the why not

2403
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:51,020
What if we don't want to wake me up wake up till september ends? I'm so sorry

2404
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:56,140
Call your grandma. She misses you. I feel like this is telling me to call my grandma

2405
02:36:56,140 --> 02:36:58,140
I'm gonna call my grandma then like a month

2406
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:01,260
And if I don't want to talk to friends and family

2407
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:05,260
Okay, then don't you don't have to listen to what I'm telling you

2408
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:10,700
I know I need to talk to my grandparents

2409
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:13,260
I would they're probably like, we're the hailey man

2410
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:18,140
And I've been invited to a lot of family stuff that I've been putting off. So maybe I need to I need to work on that

2411
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:24,060
Okay, so our emotion getting emotionally well connecting the family the dying, correct

2412
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:28,620
You are right. No, I'm kidding. Um, so death

2413
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:33,500
I felt it

2414
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:39,260
You've all felt it. There is a major change coming the month of september

2415
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:44,860
I have felt so weird the month of august. I have felt off. I have felt something is wrong

2416
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:51,420
I didn't know if it was because mercury was in retrograde. It's on the other planetary stupid stuff was going on

2417
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:54,220
But something isn't right

2418
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:57,420
That's going to change

2419
02:37:58,380 --> 02:38:00,380
In september you want to know why?

2420
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:08,220
Because death. Oh my candles don't come crazy death represents the end of a cycle

2421
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:11,980
It doesn't mean someone's dying it can but this is not what that reading is for

2422
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:14,300
um

2423
02:38:14,300 --> 02:38:18,220
It means there's going to be a change big change. It's going to be a transition

2424
02:38:18,940 --> 02:38:20,940
remember after death

2425
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:23,580
Death begets life life begets death

2426
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:26,460
all right

2427
02:38:26,540 --> 02:38:28,540
The world's not ending guys calm down

2428
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:32,860
I will connect with my ancient greek philosopher ancestors. Oh go for it, bro

2429
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:37,580
But she be what if I don't want to not slaughter my enemies in the name of aries. That's too bad

2430
02:38:38,940 --> 02:38:40,940
That's too bad. You have to

2431
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:43,580
It's your birthright

2432
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:46,060
um

2433
02:38:46,060 --> 02:38:48,060
You just go chibi

2434
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:51,260
Yeah, september is pretty close. It's literally

2435
02:38:52,620 --> 02:38:54,620
How many days away?

2436
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:57,580
10

2437
02:38:57,580 --> 02:38:59,580
How is there 30 30?

2438
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:02,140
11

2439
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:04,300
I can't do math. I'm blood

2440
02:39:06,140 --> 02:39:08,140
um

2441
02:39:08,460 --> 02:39:10,460
But but yeah

2442
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:12,300
So

2443
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:15,180
It's symbolic death and rebirth you're going to be reborn

2444
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:16,380
Also this again

2445
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:22,780
I said that this reminds me of the wheel of fortune and the what the wheel of fortune is is the wheel always turns stuff always changes

2446
02:39:22,860 --> 02:39:25,020
You're going through life. You're going through transitions

2447
02:39:25,100 --> 02:39:29,900
You're going through a cycle and then you also have the moon phases here around but you can also see this light

2448
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:35,740
It's like enlightenment. I always see these little rays of light are like enlightenment

2449
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:40,540
You're going to learn some things about yourself the month of september. You didn't anticipate some of you

2450
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:43,340
Um, you're going to be starting something new

2451
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:48,860
But in order for these things in order for the positive things that I mentioned to happen like

2452
02:39:49,500 --> 02:39:55,820
Connecting with family properly monetary success attending balance and you know emotional maybe some emotional stability

2453
02:39:56,060 --> 02:39:58,060
You have to let things go

2454
02:39:58,380 --> 02:40:00,620
Some of you got oh candle going crazy

2455
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:05,420
That is the theme right there. You have to let stuff go

2456
02:40:05,740 --> 02:40:09,420
Are you holding on to something that does no longer serve you?

2457
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:16,140
Why are you holding on to that one kid that stole 20 bucks from you?

2458
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:19,500
Don't do it. Let it go

2459
02:40:20,220 --> 02:40:22,220
Let it go

2460
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:23,980
Forget about it

2461
02:40:23,980 --> 02:40:26,380
So released runges are not serving you

2462
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:30,300
If you have some sort of hatred or dislike

2463
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:35,740
But you don't even like interact with someone or like there's a subject that's bothering you

2464
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:38,700
Let it go

2465
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:40,700
Who cares?

2466
02:40:40,940 --> 02:40:42,940
Because I want it back

2467
02:40:43,500 --> 02:40:47,660
I guess this user is so insecure compared to julius. He gave august another day

2468
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:50,940
I know he was like actually

2469
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:54,860
Hello

2470
02:40:55,100 --> 02:40:57,020
Um, but yeah, just like

2471
02:40:57,740 --> 02:40:59,660
You know

2472
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:03,980
Chill out allow stuff to happen allow stuff to change just embrace

2473
02:41:05,020 --> 02:41:08,140
this death of the month of law like a whole new

2474
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:10,700
I don't know

2475
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:17,100
One new just like if you're starting college in the fall and it's gonna be a new chapter. There's gonna be new chapters

2476
02:41:18,460 --> 02:41:22,780
And it's interesting and it's so appropriate too because when you think of fall you think of

2477
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:26,060
in a way

2478
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:27,980
death

2479
02:41:27,980 --> 02:41:29,980
That it's getting colder

2480
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:32,220
plants start dying

2481
02:41:33,180 --> 02:41:35,820
Leaves fall everything is bare

2482
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:41,980
But you know after fall after winter

2483
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:47,420
Life comes back there's spring so you know you will be okay

2484
02:41:50,380 --> 02:41:52,380
You know, you'll be fine

2485
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:59,820
Hello, hi, hi people. Hello go come in. Um, but yeah, so in short

2486
02:42:01,580 --> 02:42:03,900
If you're just getting here, I just did a general reading for everyone

2487
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:09,340
We pulled temperance ten of pentacles of death by the way, this is important when you see major arcana cards

2488
02:42:09,340 --> 02:42:13,580
Which are these ones not the numbered cards, you know, it's important. Um, so

2489
02:42:14,380 --> 02:42:16,380
Temperance attain emotional balance

2490
02:42:18,380 --> 02:42:20,380
Keep up that self-control do some

2491
02:42:20,620 --> 02:42:22,620
um, kind of like

2492
02:42:23,180 --> 02:42:24,620
emotional

2493
02:42:24,620 --> 02:42:30,860
Practices where you need to like kind of it's funny because it's probably letting things go with the death and then this and like writing stuff

2494
02:42:30,860 --> 02:42:32,860
Up and like throwing it away. So like

2495
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:36,780
I'm trying I can't think of the word

2496
02:42:38,380 --> 02:42:40,380
My throat chakra is blocked

2497
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:45,740
Usually when my throat chakra blocked, I mean, I feel like some people don't speak up for themselves as well

2498
02:42:45,740 --> 02:42:49,020
So I feel like somebody's to speak up for themselves if they keep getting like pushed down

2499
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:51,740
Um

2500
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:54,140
Yeah

2501
02:42:54,140 --> 02:42:58,940
Okay, you're not if you feel like you don't have any self-worth because you can't speak up then do something about that

2502
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:01,820
um

2503
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:06,700
Treats me getting naked. I love I love fall falls. Maybe we're two

2504
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:11,020
Um, ten of pentacles connect with your family that might give you good advice on older ones

2505
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:14,620
So, uh, I feel like someone's someone is going to tell you something you need to hear

2506
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:17,980
I don't have to be family if family doesn't have to be blood by the way

2507
02:43:18,060 --> 02:43:22,460
So people who are just close to you try to connect with family. I know some of you are meets

2508
02:43:23,580 --> 02:43:27,740
I need to connect with my family. I haven't talked to my family. I was supposed to go to the movies with my dad again

2509
02:43:28,060 --> 02:43:30,460
And I totally forgot I needed to be like, hey

2510
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:36,700
Sir, I don't know why I'm texting my phone this way like I'm typing on a computer. But yeah

2511
02:43:38,220 --> 02:43:40,220
Um, but yeah

2512
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:45,500
So that and then death september will be a new cycle for everyone. It's be a new

2513
02:43:46,300 --> 02:43:49,740
Um beginning we're transitioning into kind of a new

2514
02:43:53,180 --> 02:43:56,140
You know, I might pull another card because I don't know what

2515
02:43:57,100 --> 02:44:01,340
Cycle we are transitioning into so actually let me pull one more card for the general

2516
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:08,060
What sort of transition can we expect the month of september?

2517
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:15,420
What should we be looking out for? Oh the cards are

2518
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:22,140
When my cards just like jumps into the flames and catches fire

2519
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:39,660
Dude who is like holding on to something that is so interesting

2520
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:42,300
Ada cups

2521
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:44,300
Ada cups

2522
02:44:44,860 --> 02:44:54,220
Okay, so in the fall in september the new cycle will be moving on so we will be letting go of things. Um

2523
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:01,100
Moving on letting go searching for truth

2524
02:45:01,660 --> 02:45:06,140
Maybe we'll get a sort of truth. Maybe there's been something we've been searching for for a long time

2525
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:08,700
We never got any answers to so maybe we'll get some answers

2526
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:12,540
Leaving maybe you need to leave a toxic situation

2527
02:45:13,420 --> 02:45:15,420
Um walking away into the unknown

2528
02:45:16,060 --> 02:45:20,540
Transition might be you don't know what's going to happen next but you need to get out of there, you know

2529
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:23,580
Um

2530
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:28,540
Remember men crying is bad. Shut up. No not true. I love men that can cry

2531
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:33,260
This is the connection the family reading this is relevant. This is what yeah

2532
02:45:34,540 --> 02:45:36,540
Yeah, he doesn't have to be with

2533
02:45:36,540 --> 02:45:40,300
That's why I'm saying like family doesn't have to be blood because I know

2534
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:44,700
Like I have people in my family that I just don't talk to you because they suck

2535
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:49,260
Clip it out. I know

2536
02:45:51,260 --> 02:45:53,260
Um

2537
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:56,060
There's also abandonment

2538
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:04,540
I remember I pulled this card for somebody last um last time I did readings

2539
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:10,860
Some of you might have to abandon things that just don't

2540
02:46:12,700 --> 02:46:18,060
Benefit you anymore and just move on from them or maybe you felt abandoned personally

2541
02:46:18,620 --> 02:46:24,060
And you need to move on from it. Like I know like I have like abandonment issues up the wazoo. So

2542
02:46:24,380 --> 02:46:26,380
I

2543
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:31,100
Crying we're just like sorry chat. They're just gonna start puking everywhere

2544
02:46:32,700 --> 02:46:35,420
Everyone start crying crying everyone everyone cry

2545
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:39,660
I'm gonna make harem and the crest of the pin pals

2546
02:46:40,300 --> 02:46:44,220
Or gay reeflings or vomitors harem or cry babies

2547
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:50,460
Bleeding hearts and snippets and snowberries. I don't know what's going on with y'all but y'all can figure yourselves out

2548
02:46:55,020 --> 02:46:56,780
I threw up

2549
02:46:56,780 --> 02:46:59,500
Not the reeflings the reeflings are puking

2550
02:47:00,540 --> 02:47:05,820
I know I have like three crying. I'm also have another crying one on the I think I have two crying ones on the way

2551
02:47:07,660 --> 02:47:09,660
You guys are gonna be the cry babies

2552
02:47:11,420 --> 02:47:13,420
All right, but yeah, I hope that

2553
02:47:14,140 --> 02:47:15,820
resonated if not

2554
02:47:15,820 --> 02:47:20,540
Totally understandable. You do not have to believe a word. I say take it with a grain of salt

2555
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:23,900
Don't use it for financial advice. Don't use it to predict if you're pregnant or not

2556
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:26,460
Don't sue me. Thank you

2557
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:28,780
It is just for entertainment purposes

2558
02:47:29,740 --> 02:47:31,740
Don't sue me

2559
02:47:32,700 --> 02:47:36,380
All right, now I'm gonna get into what time is it? Oh my god, it's already almost nine

2560
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:39,740
What it took me an hour to do a read. Okay. Well, it's fine

2561
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:46,300
Um, don't worry about it. You will hear the cat food dispenser go off. I wanted to do this before then but it's okay

2562
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:55,500
Why are you only contacting you? Okay

2563
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:01,580
Flower head

2564
02:48:04,140 --> 02:48:06,140
Can I get a reading out I just wrote myself

2565
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:09,100
well

2566
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:12,460
Boomi, why are you laughing at me? Did you hear that you went?

2567
02:48:14,140 --> 02:48:17,180
Um, can I get a reading for my future or any weird spot where I'm doing everything

2568
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:20,060
Can I find a good job and better my future with everyone telling me I'm doing fine?

2569
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:24,460
Yeah, I still feel like I'm not doing enough. Sorry. That's too broad. I feel like you just want a purpose

2570
02:48:25,660 --> 02:48:32,860
And honestly, I get that like I turn to a lot of what I do because I needed a perfect like before I was a beach like

2571
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:35,820
Literally before I was a vtuber

2572
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:42,300
I was struggling to find purpose because I was at my job. I had been there for almost six years and I'm like, what am I doing?

2573
02:48:43,820 --> 02:48:46,460
What am I doing with my life? Like I don't

2574
02:48:47,980 --> 02:48:49,980
Know what to do

2575
02:48:49,980 --> 02:48:51,980
You know, like I just needed a purpose

2576
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:56,460
And so I kind of like that's when people like, you know, like turn into god turn to god and stuff

2577
02:48:56,780 --> 02:49:00,780
And you don't blame them because sometimes you need a little bit of faith to find your purpose

2578
02:49:01,500 --> 02:49:04,940
Um, and this was that for me. So I totally get that

2579
02:49:06,220 --> 02:49:08,220
I'm sorry that you're that you're going through that

2580
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:14,380
What's the trap

2581
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:21,260
I think she beat that was all bullshit, but it was inspiring bullshit. So I feel good. No problem, bro. No problem

2582
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:23,900
Anytime I will always be bullshit at you

2583
02:49:38,060 --> 02:49:40,540
Please do not invest your life savings in NFTs

2584
02:49:41,500 --> 02:49:43,660
I can relate a bit. I already know the dream stuff

2585
02:49:43,660 --> 02:49:48,140
I want but stuff's in the way so professional fits in between. Yeah, because like this is a dream of mine

2586
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:51,580
But I never thought it would ever be attainable, but I guess I just

2587
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:54,700
I guess I'm a product

2588
02:49:55,260 --> 02:49:56,940
Like I'm I'm

2589
02:49:56,940 --> 02:49:59,580
Proof that it's real like your dreams can come true

2590
02:50:00,620 --> 02:50:03,340
But only if you work hard at them because I remember

2591
02:50:04,060 --> 02:50:05,420
when I was

2592
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:09,100
Trying to figure myself out and I was just like I want to be a vtuber

2593
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:17,020
I went to a psychic and she was just like well, it just doesn't happen overnight. Are you gonna like start and I'm like

2594
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:19,420
true

2595
02:50:19,420 --> 02:50:23,500
And so I started and I started initially with this like

2596
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:28,300
Kind of seeing it as a job rather than a hobby

2597
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:31,900
And I was like I just want to be agency and I just want to do this this and that

2598
02:50:32,460 --> 02:50:34,700
And I knew I wasn't doing it for the right reasons

2599
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:40,060
And went back and she's just like you're not doing it for the right reasons. I'm like, how do you fucking know?

2600
02:50:40,060 --> 02:50:43,980
How do you know what I meant because she's just like it was funny the second goes

2601
02:50:45,580 --> 02:50:46,700
um

2602
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:47,900
you were

2603
02:50:47,900 --> 02:50:49,420
You're into like

2604
02:50:49,420 --> 02:50:54,220
You're into anime right and like mind you. I don't have anything. I don't have anything on my person

2605
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:56,300
I don't look like a weeb. I don't

2606
02:50:56,860 --> 02:50:58,220
And I'm not like

2607
02:50:58,220 --> 02:51:03,500
And she's just like you like internet stuff like you want to be a content creator and has to do with anime and I'm like

2608
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:06,380
How did you fucking know that bitch? How did you know?

2609
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:11,100
And she's like don't worry. It'll work out for you, but you got to do stuff about it. I'm like facts. All right, bet

2610
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:12,380
let's do it

2611
02:51:12,380 --> 02:51:13,900
um

2612
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:14,940
Is she a psychic or uncle?

2613
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:18,220
I wrote holy crap the insight she got a whiff of the weave. I don't know

2614
02:51:18,220 --> 02:51:22,220
And I was like look I like looked at myself in the mirror and I'm like do I look like a weeb

2615
02:51:23,500 --> 02:51:28,060
Do I do I just give off weed but but this woman was like 60 years old mind you

2616
02:51:28,780 --> 02:51:30,780
I don't

2617
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:32,780
I don't I don't know

2618
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:35,180
You smell the weird on you

2619
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:40,140
But I don't look like a weeb if you saw me you'd be like she looks pretty normal

2620
02:51:41,180 --> 02:51:43,180
Raina, can you stop hissing at boomi?

2621
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:56,380
Um but anyways my story and but um then

2622
02:51:57,340 --> 02:51:59,340
uh

2623
02:51:59,420 --> 02:52:01,420
I remember doing my own

2624
02:52:01,900 --> 02:52:07,020
Reading for myself and essentially the reading said give us something to bless like show us that you want it

2625
02:52:07,580 --> 02:52:09,580
and so I streamed

2626
02:52:10,620 --> 02:52:13,500
constantly four times five times a week

2627
02:52:14,700 --> 02:52:15,740
um

2628
02:52:15,740 --> 02:52:17,740
While working a full-time job

2629
02:52:19,020 --> 02:52:20,140
for

2630
02:52:20,140 --> 02:52:22,140
of almost six months

2631
02:52:22,380 --> 02:52:26,460
And I worked really hard. I did a lot of research. I did a lot of like

2632
02:52:27,740 --> 02:52:29,180
growing

2633
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:34,220
Learning about the community a bunch of stuff and then I gave them something to bless and then they

2634
02:52:35,020 --> 02:52:37,020
Got me what I wanted which was literally

2635
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:39,820
I didn't become a vtuber to like

2636
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:42,300
get into v alert, but um

2637
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:44,780
I always knew like when

2638
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:49,100
scrawny was conceptualizing and stuff back when she was you know leaf or whatever

2639
02:52:50,300 --> 02:52:55,980
Like I always loved it and then when I became a vtuber like three months after I was in D. I'm like

2640
02:52:56,940 --> 02:53:00,860
It's happening. I want I have to be a part of this. I want to be a part of this

2641
02:53:01,900 --> 02:53:05,820
I like I need to be like I know I'm meant to be a part of this and I got in

2642
02:53:07,100 --> 02:53:09,100
And I'm here

2643
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:16,300
Chibi I'm sorry to say but normal people watch anime now. No not the gnomies

2644
02:53:18,140 --> 02:53:20,460
Madame you are wearing mesh gloves and spikes. You're one eyepatch

2645
02:53:21,020 --> 02:53:23,020
You

2646
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:26,540
I was very chuney when I was younger

2647
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:36,700
Um, all right, anyways, I know

2648
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:56,380
What does flower head need to do to find their purpose this is about to go out

2649
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:06,060
What do they need to do connecting with flower head spiritual team what can motivate them what can help them

2650
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:14,940
Can I pull this card for you before I don't remember

2651
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:23,180
What do they need to know what do they need to hear what do they need to be told

2652
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:35,340
Interesting interesting interesting

2653
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:44,700
Interesting, okay. I need more cards. I need more can I get a clarification card for the two of pentacles, please?

2654
02:54:44,940 --> 02:54:46,940
Thank you very much

2655
02:54:48,140 --> 02:54:50,140
Thank you very much

2656
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:57,260
That's too much clarification. I need a little bit only like one card. Oh, perfect

2657
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:01,340
Thank you very much

2658
02:55:02,620 --> 02:55:04,620
Actually

2659
02:55:15,660 --> 02:55:18,160
Huh, huh

2660
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:27,900
I'm sensing a block which I totally get because what you said there's a block there's like something

2661
02:55:28,700 --> 02:55:31,340
I don't really know how to what to put my finger on it

2662
02:55:31,340 --> 02:55:36,780
But I I get your what you're feeling right now that you don't know what you're supposed to do because I also have this feeling of like

2663
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:40,540
kind of like hopelessness and restlessness and like

2664
02:55:41,500 --> 02:55:45,020
Just a general kind of like I have a sense of confusion

2665
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:48,380
I have confusion

2666
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:51,180
That one lady who was talking about

2667
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:53,900
Why is it our Kansas?

2668
02:55:54,220 --> 02:55:57,020
Why is it's not our Kansas? Why is it Arkansas?

2669
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:02,700
My nails look funny. Oh, thank you. Don't worry. I'll take a better picture

2670
02:56:03,900 --> 02:56:05,900
Take a better picture

2671
02:56:07,100 --> 02:56:09,100
um

2672
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:14,620
The card flip is what spirituals you can fucking get

2673
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:19,580
All right, so you have queen of cups in reverse

2674
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:25,500
She fallen you have knight of wands upright

2675
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:29,820
I can't remember if I pulled a knight for you last time. I think I did

2676
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:34,700
And you have two of pentacles and then you have I'll show you two pentacles

2677
02:56:35,420 --> 02:56:37,420
Yep

2678
02:56:38,460 --> 02:56:42,060
And then you have justice in reverse and you also have the hanged man in reverse

2679
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:46,700
Very interesting. We have two major arcana cards

2680
02:56:47,740 --> 02:56:49,740
very very interesting

2681
02:56:50,780 --> 02:56:52,780
So this is for um

2682
02:56:53,660 --> 02:56:58,860
Flower head. So this is you right now. I already know the queen of cups is you right now

2683
02:56:59,020 --> 02:57:02,300
But I'm also going to tell you what you need to be reminded of what makes you special

2684
02:57:03,260 --> 02:57:05,260
Wait, what?

2685
02:57:11,180 --> 02:57:16,380
Let's make this a bit simpler as I'm not sure I can articulate the other question properly without going into more detail than I want

2686
02:57:16,380 --> 02:57:20,940
How about we just do where should my folks be for the next moment? Okay. Hey, okay. I understand

2687
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:24,460
Okay, I kind of see that better

2688
02:57:24,780 --> 02:57:29,660
No, don't worry. Don't worry special. I saw your I saw your initial thing. You didn't have to you didn't have to donate again

2689
02:57:33,100 --> 02:57:36,220
Reversed hang man, that's good or is it?

2690
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:39,100
Well, you learned it a little bit

2691
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:40,540
um

2692
02:57:40,540 --> 02:57:42,540
So this is you right now flower head

2693
02:57:43,340 --> 02:57:45,340
Do not take this personally

2694
02:57:46,140 --> 02:57:48,700
Also, wait, wait, I always have to ask when I'm doing a personal reading

2695
02:57:48,780 --> 02:57:52,300
Do you want me to be blunt or you don't do you want me to sugarcoat stuff by the way?

2696
02:57:56,460 --> 02:57:58,540
There are no bad cards in my opinion

2697
02:58:02,300 --> 02:58:04,300
Do

2698
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:22,460
Flower head died flower head where are did you fall asleep? Oh cat food going off

2699
02:58:27,100 --> 02:58:29,260
They haven't talked in a while they must be dead

2700
02:58:32,780 --> 02:58:34,780
You

2701
02:58:39,020 --> 02:58:41,020
Food dispenser mind below fed

2702
02:58:43,020 --> 02:58:48,540
Rest in peace flower whole flower head everyone rest in peace flower head blunt. Oh, okay. There you are

2703
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:51,260
I've even lurking. I'm sorry wake up

2704
02:58:56,060 --> 02:58:58,060
Okay, he's like blunt

2705
02:58:58,780 --> 02:59:01,660
You're insecure. Don't know what for

2706
02:59:02,860 --> 02:59:09,740
Something something when you walk through the no seriously assistant security you're insecure as fuck. What's wrong with you? Um, you're overly sensitive

2707
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:11,660
You're needy

2708
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:13,420
You're fragile

2709
02:59:13,420 --> 02:59:15,420
You have some sort of codependence

2710
02:59:16,060 --> 02:59:19,820
You have victim mentality right now. You've been giving away too much of yourself

2711
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:25,740
Yeah, that's to you right now

2712
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:28,700
Uh

2713
02:59:30,220 --> 02:59:32,220
But you need a reminder

2714
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:37,340
You need a reminder

2715
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:39,580
Of what you can be

2716
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:42,140
And I will tell you

2717
02:59:42,220 --> 02:59:44,220
Because you have great qualities

2718
02:59:45,820 --> 02:59:50,540
And I don't want I'm not saying this to hurt you. I'm just making I'm saying stuff so that you're self

2719
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:53,420
aware, okay

2720
02:59:53,980 --> 03:00:01,020
Why do you who made you feel insecure? Why do you not feel like you're good enough? Why are you so sensitive if someone critiques you?

2721
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:06,300
Was does somebody make a comment and that kind of rocked your shit?

2722
03:00:07,340 --> 03:00:09,340
You know

2723
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:17,580
I and then it says needy. So again, you're you're looking to me for reassurance. You're looking to an anime girl on the internet

2724
03:00:18,620 --> 03:00:20,620
Nothing wrong with that

2725
03:00:21,500 --> 03:00:26,700
So you're a little fragile right now. You're experiencing some codependence issues

2726
03:00:27,980 --> 03:00:30,380
You're relying on stuff that you shouldn't be relying on

2727
03:00:31,580 --> 03:00:34,700
To work to focus that worked out your feelings, you know

2728
03:00:35,500 --> 03:00:41,260
And that's why you've been feeling aimless is because you're holding yourself black black

2729
03:00:42,060 --> 03:00:44,060
You're holding yourself back

2730
03:00:45,740 --> 03:00:47,740
Uh you

2731
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:53,020
Hold on. He's me and if this applies to you then you can like, you know, you can absorb it as well

2732
03:00:55,100 --> 03:00:57,260
Shut up everybody shut up. Um

2733
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:03,180
How's my hand thought you

2734
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:07,020
The reason why you feel like you're not

2735
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:09,820
Doing good enough or whatever. It's because you just

2736
03:01:10,540 --> 03:01:16,540
You're also comparing yourself to other people, you know, like I was chat stops. Listen

2737
03:01:17,500 --> 03:01:19,500
Um

2738
03:01:22,380 --> 03:01:24,540
You are enough you are doing enough

2739
03:01:24,700 --> 03:01:29,420
I don't know why you can't see this because let me let me gas you up a little bit flower head

2740
03:01:29,500 --> 03:01:35,980
Let me gas you up. You know what you are. You know what the qualities you do have that your spiritual team your ancestors your peoples

2741
03:01:37,420 --> 03:01:40,700
Your your your dead pet from a couple years ago wants you to know

2742
03:01:41,980 --> 03:01:43,820
You're courageous

2743
03:01:43,820 --> 03:01:45,820
You're energetic when you want to be

2744
03:01:45,820 --> 03:01:47,820
You can be extremely charming

2745
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:49,980
And charismatic you're passionate

2746
03:01:50,460 --> 03:01:53,740
When you have the motivation when something super interests you

2747
03:01:54,700 --> 03:01:56,700
You feel adventurous sometimes

2748
03:01:57,580 --> 03:02:01,420
And it doesn't have to be like, oh i'm gonna go climb a mountain. It could be like i'm trying this new food

2749
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:05,740
You feel free spirited you're a hero you look out for the little guy

2750
03:02:08,060 --> 03:02:10,060
You look out for the little guy

2751
03:02:10,620 --> 03:02:12,620
You have a drive

2752
03:02:13,260 --> 03:02:14,780
You're missing that drive though

2753
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:20,140
You know why you're missing that drive because you're insecure right now. You need to stop you need to stop

2754
03:02:26,620 --> 03:02:30,540
I don't know a song popped into my head. What was the song? I got it. Then I lost it

2755
03:02:31,820 --> 03:02:34,060
The song having to do with driving. I don't know why

2756
03:02:36,460 --> 03:02:38,460
I can't remember what it was

2757
03:02:40,140 --> 03:02:42,140
There's a lot of dead animals in the stream

2758
03:02:44,380 --> 03:02:46,380
You would be correct

2759
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:53,340
I need someone to like ID that skull for me. Um

2760
03:02:55,580 --> 03:03:01,580
But yeah, don't forget those amazing qualities you have you're pushing them down because of your insecurity

2761
03:03:02,300 --> 03:03:04,300
I want you to

2762
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:07,660
Think about the these good things I've told you

2763
03:03:07,740 --> 03:03:11,180
I want you to think about your past successes

2764
03:03:12,300 --> 03:03:14,300
and what you came from

2765
03:03:14,700 --> 03:03:16,780
Because you you've been through some shit, bro

2766
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:19,820
You've been through some shit

2767
03:03:19,820 --> 03:03:23,420
And you forget about it. Sometimes you forget where you came from, bro

2768
03:03:24,220 --> 03:03:26,220
I don't know why i'm acting ganks all of a sudden, but I am

2769
03:03:29,020 --> 03:03:31,020
That's a bird

2770
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:34,220
What's that one like ticked uh ticked talk. That's just like

2771
03:03:35,660 --> 03:03:37,500
um

2772
03:03:38,220 --> 03:03:40,780
Oh my god, it's like you think it's a bird like

2773
03:03:41,500 --> 03:03:46,140
That's like when I heard ticked talks I forget the context though. Um, but yeah

2774
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:50,940
All right, I was I the sense of confusion I get because I

2775
03:03:52,140 --> 03:03:56,780
These two cars are very interesting to me with the two of pentacles. So two of pentacles

2776
03:03:57,500 --> 03:04:01,900
You got this person balancing monies and this is funny because you're talking about your career and stuff

2777
03:04:02,620 --> 03:04:07,180
Um, so this is choices multitasking decisions weighing up options multiple priorities

2778
03:04:07,340 --> 03:04:09,900
So usually when I pull like a choice or a two card

2779
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:16,060
I usually pull two cards after for verification and kind of just or clarification rather just to see okay

2780
03:04:16,140 --> 03:04:19,740
What are the two choices? What's going on here? Um

2781
03:04:21,580 --> 03:04:26,220
But it seems like you're you're you can be a man of many hats you juggle a lot of stuff

2782
03:04:26,860 --> 03:04:27,580
um

2783
03:04:27,820 --> 03:04:31,820
You try to balance a lot, but you don't usually over encumber yourself

2784
03:04:31,900 --> 03:04:35,180
But you have to be careful not to get caught up in stuff and take up

2785
03:04:35,740 --> 03:04:38,860
Too much like you don't want to be so stuck weighing your options

2786
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:45,180
Like having this like am I good enough or am I am I going anywhere in my life like you've been having?

2787
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:47,660
um

2788
03:04:47,660 --> 03:04:51,980
You have to like make a choice like you've been delaying something you just have to

2789
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:56,940
Fucking pick something, you know, uh, I know you've just got a job or whatever

2790
03:04:57,580 --> 03:04:59,580
I feel like there's something in the job or like

2791
03:04:59,820 --> 03:05:02,060
That you need to do like you need to make a choice on

2792
03:05:02,620 --> 03:05:07,500
Or like someone's like puts it like giving you a choice like you have to do this or that and you're like

2793
03:05:07,580 --> 03:05:12,460
What the fuck do I do because like am I good enough to do this task or like do I do this other task?

2794
03:05:12,540 --> 03:05:17,740
It's what I know or like it's easier for me. Blah blah blah blah. Um, that's him the bird is dead

2795
03:05:18,940 --> 03:05:21,500
um, so you have the justice reverse

2796
03:05:22,140 --> 03:05:25,340
in the hate man in reverse so something

2797
03:05:26,300 --> 03:05:32,940
So dishonesty unfairness bigotry lawsuits legal issues dishonest why is dishonesty twice? I don't understand

2798
03:05:33,420 --> 03:05:35,420
uh lack of accountability

2799
03:05:35,420 --> 03:05:37,420
retribution

2800
03:05:37,420 --> 03:05:42,620
Look at this this card is actually pretty gorgeous. I never really looked at it. She has like a flame in her chest

2801
03:05:44,140 --> 03:05:49,500
Well, I would like a souls like game based on tarot cards. Holy shit

2802
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:55,100
That'd be so cool. Imagine fighting a lady

2803
03:05:56,140 --> 03:05:58,140
who's like made of scales

2804
03:05:58,460 --> 03:06:00,460
Sorry, I'm getting off topic

2805
03:06:00,700 --> 03:06:03,580
dishonesty squared. Okay, and then you have

2806
03:06:05,660 --> 03:06:07,660
Hanged man in reverse

2807
03:06:08,220 --> 03:06:12,220
Here I'll show what it looks like when it's upright, but when it's reverse it's like that

2808
03:06:13,100 --> 03:06:18,940
um delays resistance and decisions standstill apathy selfishness victim mentality again

2809
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:21,100
You have two victim mentalities

2810
03:06:22,860 --> 03:06:25,500
Disinterest stagnation avoiding sacrifice

2811
03:06:26,620 --> 03:06:32,060
So what I like about the hangman the hangman is all about like kind of going out on a limb and um attaining a new perspective

2812
03:06:32,060 --> 03:06:36,380
That's why I like the level I like about that card, but you have been very close minded

2813
03:06:36,460 --> 03:06:42,300
So you've had these choices you've not been opened to new ideas because you're stuck in your own head

2814
03:06:42,300 --> 03:06:44,300
You're stuck in your own world. We need that to stop

2815
03:06:44,860 --> 03:06:47,900
Um because you're experiencing again this victim mentality

2816
03:06:49,020 --> 03:06:51,020
You're gonna be okay

2817
03:06:51,260 --> 03:06:52,620
dishonesty

2818
03:06:52,620 --> 03:06:53,980
um

2819
03:06:53,980 --> 03:06:55,740
I don't know if that like

2820
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:59,180
means something to you maybe something because like I see like

2821
03:06:59,900 --> 03:07:01,900
Again dishonesty is twice

2822
03:07:01,980 --> 03:07:04,380
I don't know if somebody's lying to you if you've been

2823
03:07:05,420 --> 03:07:08,860
thinking that someone's lying. Uh, it's also bigotry. Um

2824
03:07:10,300 --> 03:07:12,300
Are you a bigot? That's terrible

2825
03:07:13,180 --> 03:07:15,180
my camera's

2826
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:17,420
All right

2827
03:07:17,420 --> 03:07:24,620
Um, Haiti styled game of tarot cards instead of greek. That's literally call to the lamp and I'm finding a visik though

2828
03:07:25,340 --> 03:07:26,780
um

2829
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:28,780
What is in my fucking eye?

2830
03:07:30,940 --> 03:07:32,940
Something's in my eye

2831
03:07:35,340 --> 03:07:37,340
Ow what the hell

2832
03:07:40,060 --> 03:07:42,620
Something's in your eye you're not seeing the full picture

2833
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:45,500
Maybe I don't know. Um

2834
03:07:51,260 --> 03:07:56,780
Is it your eyeball? Oh, is it your eyeball? Oh, is it your eyeball?

2835
03:08:00,700 --> 03:08:02,700
Um

2836
03:08:07,020 --> 03:08:09,260
I'll be honest with you. I'll be real with you

2837
03:08:10,220 --> 03:08:16,620
You have two paths laid in front of you. There is a lesser of two evils, but it's going to be bumpy so I

2838
03:08:17,980 --> 03:08:20,060
You're I feel like you'll get what you like

2839
03:08:20,060 --> 03:08:23,340
You're still gonna be stuck in this headspace until you get over those things

2840
03:08:23,660 --> 03:08:29,580
And because you're stuck in these headspace it can go one way with the inverse justice or another way

2841
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:35,180
uh with the hanged man, so um everything kind of being at a stand

2842
03:08:35,180 --> 03:08:37,740
I feel like I need another card. I need some sort of

2843
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:41,980
Like

2844
03:08:43,340 --> 03:08:47,020
What can be the choice is like what does he have to look forward after this?

2845
03:08:47,020 --> 03:08:50,220
Like is there a positive outcome or is he so stuck in his head?

2846
03:08:50,620 --> 03:08:54,140
He needs to go through that does he need to go through this? This is a necessary

2847
03:08:55,420 --> 03:09:02,700
Um part of his life that he needs to go through does he need to get over himself before he can find his purpose? Oh my

2848
03:09:02,700 --> 03:09:04,700
I

2849
03:09:06,220 --> 03:09:09,660
You guys didn't see it but the card landed in the trash can

2850
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:15,020
The card landed in my trash can

2851
03:09:18,780 --> 03:09:20,780
Oh

2852
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:38,940
Uh someone needs to be taken out to the trash

2853
03:09:43,020 --> 03:09:45,820
Perfect this is what I wanted to see ace of wands

2854
03:09:47,980 --> 03:09:52,380
Ace of wands it was like sideways so it wasn't upright or

2855
03:09:53,180 --> 03:09:55,180
Reversed it was literally in the trash like this

2856
03:09:56,380 --> 03:09:58,460
And with that I usually will read both sides

2857
03:09:58,620 --> 03:10:00,620
If you

2858
03:10:05,100 --> 03:10:07,100
You have to

2859
03:10:07,980 --> 03:10:12,780
If someone's being dishonest get rid of them because you're only going down go down the path of a continuous creative block

2860
03:10:12,940 --> 03:10:16,620
Someone's going to hurt and ruin you. I don't know who it is get them out of your life

2861
03:10:17,500 --> 03:10:21,260
Um, someone's giving you bad advice. I don't know who it is. They're being just honest

2862
03:10:21,260 --> 03:10:25,020
They're telling you stuff that you like you need to hear things and they're not telling you

2863
03:10:25,500 --> 03:10:26,620
You

2864
03:10:26,620 --> 03:10:33,500
Lawsuits legal. No, I have no idea. There's nothing to do with that. However, this is this is actually good. This is the this is the portion

2865
03:10:35,580 --> 03:10:38,460
If you are okay with a little bit of delay

2866
03:10:40,780 --> 03:10:46,860
A little bit of indecisiveness if you kind of move forward, but you don't let this person influence you

2867
03:10:48,620 --> 03:10:50,620
I feel like it's a female presence

2868
03:10:51,180 --> 03:10:53,180
because the justice card is female

2869
03:10:54,140 --> 03:10:56,140
Then

2870
03:10:57,180 --> 03:11:03,580
You have the possibility of ace of wands ace again ace one new beginning a new start

2871
03:11:04,700 --> 03:11:11,980
New project inspiration ignited passion new opportunities growth potential energy creative spark new initiative

2872
03:11:12,460 --> 03:11:17,820
Enthusiasm, that's what you wanted. That's what you wanted. I don't know who this fucking person is who's dishonest

2873
03:11:18,220 --> 03:11:22,620
Fucking big it is get them out of your life get them leave them kick them out. Boom. They're not helping you

2874
03:11:22,620 --> 03:11:24,940
They're not serving you. I don't know if that's relevant

2875
03:11:27,020 --> 03:11:28,780
Who knows

2876
03:11:28,780 --> 03:11:31,900
It's it's me as you gotta get rid of me. I'm so just enemy

2877
03:11:35,500 --> 03:11:37,500
Just just knock me out

2878
03:11:39,340 --> 03:11:40,940
um

2879
03:11:40,940 --> 03:11:46,220
because if you continue to work with this person or

2880
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:53,820
For rejection false start more delays more blocks lack of direction and passion

2881
03:11:54,940 --> 03:11:59,740
Distractions lack of energy hesitancy creative blocks. You've been wondering what the heck you're doing with your life

2882
03:11:59,900 --> 03:12:02,380
This person has not been helpful to you

2883
03:12:04,140 --> 03:12:06,140
There's somebody that's not telling you how it is

2884
03:12:06,700 --> 03:12:08,380
I'm sub right now

2885
03:12:08,380 --> 03:12:12,380
But yeah, I I don't know flower head if that was relevant to you at all

2886
03:12:13,100 --> 03:12:19,900
It's gonna be a long journey. It's gonna be a long road. You will get through it. You will have that passion back

2887
03:12:19,900 --> 03:12:21,660
But you need to work

2888
03:12:21,660 --> 03:12:27,900
On your insecurity you need to work on this person or like remove this person from your life that might be being dishonest

2889
03:12:33,980 --> 03:12:37,260
I don't know why I couldn't just speak then I just literally like lost my tongue

2890
03:12:37,980 --> 03:12:42,700
Uh, I don't know if you're scared to talk to that person, but early you can just like quietly get rid of them

2891
03:12:45,420 --> 03:12:47,980
Um, and then you know, you'll have some delays

2892
03:12:48,460 --> 03:12:54,220

2943
03:18:23,820 --> 03:18:27,580
I left the light on in my room and I realized it's off

03:18:29,900 --> 03:18:31,900
Hold on a moment

2945
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:43,500

03:19:05,900 --> 03:19:07,900
Spirit's inky no, they're not inky

2948
03:19:10,700 --> 03:19:15,660
They're playing with me possibly I should probably

2949
03:19:16,620 --> 03:19:18,620
Stop

2950
03:19:19,660 --> 03:19:25,500
Stupid freaking rug. It's like it's the same rug I ordered before. Why is this one trash?

2951
03:19:40,700 --> 03:19:42,700
I

2952
03:19:54,780 --> 03:19:57,580
I guess trash because of and shit to fake it what?

2953
03:20:02,300 --> 03:20:08,060
Who how do I get like left behind in my own stream like I am

2954
03:20:08,860 --> 03:20:11,900
In 30 minutes behind I don't know how that works

2955
03:20:13,420 --> 03:20:19,020
How does that work when I've been watching my own stream because I had the chat up that doesn't

2956
03:20:19,740 --> 03:20:21,740
Make it make sense

2957
03:20:22,540 --> 03:20:24,540
Or built different

2958
03:20:25,660 --> 03:20:27,820
Accidentally just on did my shirt. It's fine

2959
03:20:28,380 --> 03:20:30,380
Oh

2960
03:20:34,700 --> 03:20:37,980
I think I know why would I type something like I have a rose up right now

2961
03:20:38,780 --> 03:20:41,100
Because then that goes to the very beginning of my stream

2962
03:20:41,900 --> 03:20:43,900
I press the toggle. That's why

2963
03:20:45,500 --> 03:20:47,500
Get out of full screen

2964
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:54,620

03:21:11,420 --> 03:21:13,420
Um

2970
03:21:25,020 --> 03:21:27,020
I don't understand

2971
03:21:27,660 --> 03:21:30,700
Why my neighbor just does not give a shit

2972
03:21:31,500 --> 03:21:33,500

2973
03:21:33,900 --> 03:21:39,980
Screaming down the hallway when it's nine at night. I don't I do have any

2974
03:21:40,860 --> 03:21:42,860

2978
03:22:00,700 --> 03:22:03,180

2979
03:22:04,140 --> 03:22:06,140

2980
03:22:09,100 --> 03:22:11,100
Yeah, they're so loud

2981
03:22:11,660 --> 03:22:13,660
They're so loud

2982
03:22:18,380 --> 03:22:20,380
Oh that candle's going out

2983
03:22:22,220 --> 03:22:24,220
Say goodbye haters

2984
03:22:25,020 --> 03:22:27,020
We're still holding on

2985
03:22:27,900 --> 03:22:29,900
Just kidding

2986
03:22:30,540 --> 03:22:32,540
I got so much wax on this

2987
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:34,940
Exxon wax off

2988
03:22:37,660 --> 03:22:39,660
Pop the wax off

2989
03:23:03,020 --> 03:23:13,580
Sorry connecting with right again, I'm just grounding myself before I go to the next one connecting myself with right

2990
03:23:17,420 --> 03:23:19,420
Spiritual team sorry, but we did something

2991
03:23:23,900 --> 03:23:29,020
Pop you're distracting me do you need a little bit of laughter in your life chaos?

2992
03:23:29,980 --> 03:23:31,980
It's a funny sentence

2993
03:23:49,500 --> 03:23:51,500
The wheel be turning

2994
03:23:52,460 --> 03:23:55,660
The wheel be turning did I pull us three last time? I don't know

2995
03:23:56,380 --> 03:23:58,380
And I remember I'm seeing cards I pulled last time

2996
03:24:06,060 --> 03:24:08,060
Whoa

2997
03:24:11,340 --> 03:24:15,100
This is pretty good so far very positive into your year

2998
03:24:17,820 --> 03:24:23,660
At least so far I've still one more card to pull I can go for a laugh. Just look in the mirror now

2999
03:24:25,900 --> 03:24:31,500
I'm sorry. I love you. I didn't mean it. I was just trying to make you laugh. I swear. Don't get mad at me

3000
03:24:33,580 --> 03:24:40,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It just happened to just come down. Please don't cry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

3001
03:24:43,100 --> 03:24:45,100
I'm sorry

3002
03:24:47,420 --> 03:24:50,380
This one's running away you get a bonus card

3003
03:24:52,300 --> 03:24:54,300
You're gonna came

3004
03:24:56,540 --> 03:24:58,540
You

3005
03:25:04,140 --> 03:25:05,500
All right

3006
03:25:05,500 --> 03:25:11,340
Pretty generally you got a lot of a lot of a lot of you got two pentacles cards. You got wheel fortune

3007
03:25:11,980 --> 03:25:14,940
page of pentacles wheel fortune queen of pentacles

3008
03:25:15,500 --> 03:25:17,420
page of

3009
03:25:17,420 --> 03:25:19,420
I feel like you're going through a

3010
03:25:19,900 --> 03:25:21,740
like

3011
03:25:21,740 --> 03:25:26,380
Growing you're gonna be growing at the end of the year. I feel like you're growing

3012
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:31,980
Like you're gonna be learning new skills just by like the page going to the queen

3013
03:25:32,460 --> 03:25:38,380
But then you're gonna be going, you know learning another skill and it's a page of wands and then eventually you get to like the queen of wands

3014
03:25:39,260 --> 03:25:43,100
Um, you're a woman now by the way, and I'm kidding. That's not how this works

3015
03:25:44,220 --> 03:25:46,220
um

3016
03:25:46,860 --> 03:25:48,860
The growth of chaos

3017
03:25:51,820 --> 03:25:52,940
so

3018
03:25:52,940 --> 03:25:54,940
page of pentacles

3019
03:25:55,020 --> 03:25:57,020
manifestation

3020
03:25:57,020 --> 03:25:59,020
Grounded ambitious

3021
03:25:59,420 --> 03:26:00,860
offering a gift

3022
03:26:00,860 --> 03:26:07,020
goal-oriented financial opportunity planner consistent loyal faithful messenger

3023
03:26:07,900 --> 03:26:12,780
I feel like the page of pentacles is a little bit childish, but I feel like in this case

3024
03:26:13,980 --> 03:26:20,220
You've been trying to be very like adult money-minded and mindful of like spending stuff

3025
03:26:21,100 --> 03:26:26,940
And I think that's paying off for you. I feel like you've been kind of trying to be a little bit careful

3026
03:26:27,900 --> 03:26:29,900
um

3027
03:26:29,900 --> 03:26:34,220
And I think this is kind of just validation to continue to be grounded

3028
03:26:34,940 --> 03:26:37,660
Um continue to chase that bag sis

3029
03:26:38,380 --> 03:26:40,700
Uh because it will pan out for you, you know

3030
03:26:41,260 --> 03:26:43,260
Congrats on all

3031
03:26:43,820 --> 03:26:46,220
Um chibi who's chibi?

3032
03:26:47,020 --> 03:26:49,020
Um

3033
03:26:49,420 --> 03:26:51,420
I feel like you should spread that

3034
03:26:51,980 --> 03:26:56,380
Well, this could be a wealth of like knowledge, you know, I hear in my garage

3035
03:26:58,220 --> 03:27:01,740
Knowledge sorry, um or this could be monetary

3036
03:27:01,900 --> 03:27:06,380
But I feel like you should share this with other people because this is offering a gift. I feel like

3037
03:27:07,180 --> 03:27:09,180
you might gain

3038
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:14,860
Some happiness from sharing this with somebody else, you know, I I love giving gifts to people

3039
03:27:14,860 --> 03:27:18,700
I don't know why gift giving to others is my love language

3040
03:27:19,340 --> 03:27:21,500
um is one of them

3041
03:27:21,500 --> 03:27:26,220
But it's funny because then like I don't I'm not a huge like gift receiver because I feel like I'm not good enough

3042
03:27:26,540 --> 03:27:29,900
So I feel like you'll feel good if you're like kind of spread that love

3043
03:27:30,860 --> 03:27:33,260
Yeah, keep keep an eye on that money. Um

3044
03:27:35,100 --> 03:27:40,620
And you know your manifestations have been paying off and like I know like like me and Icy throw or in the word like

3045
03:27:40,860 --> 03:27:43,100
I'm manifesting that a lot, but like

3046
03:27:43,980 --> 03:27:48,700
Manifestation it's like it's literally a mindset when you really break it down

3047
03:27:48,780 --> 03:27:52,780
It's a sigma male alpha male mindset where you're just like

3048
03:27:53,340 --> 03:27:56,540
I'm fucking doing this. This is gonna happen for me

3049
03:27:57,500 --> 03:28:02,380
Yeah, and like continue to do that if you're like, you know what I've been saving for this

3050
03:28:02,620 --> 03:28:08,700
I've been doing that. I want this. This is mine. Keep that up. You'll get it. You'll get what you want

3051
03:28:09,580 --> 03:28:11,580
You'll get what you need

3052
03:28:12,060 --> 03:28:16,300
Because your team really wants you to have it. They're willing to help you provide help provide for you

3053
03:28:17,020 --> 03:28:19,020
and again wheel of fortune

3054
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:21,580
The wheel turns

3055
03:28:21,580 --> 03:28:23,580
And it's upright for you right now

3056
03:28:23,580 --> 03:28:27,420
Good luck fate life cycles destiny a turning point

3057
03:28:27,900 --> 03:28:31,820
The universe is in control changes cycle karma unexpected events

3058
03:28:32,300 --> 03:28:35,980
I feel like you'll have some positive unexpected events towards the end of the year

3059

You'll be experiencing new things, but it's it's part of life. It's your fate. It's your destiny

3070

03:31:09,420 --> 03:31:12,060
Um page of wants that I think after you do that

3092
03:31:12,140 --> 03:31:17,100
When you get that success in that area that you want you'll be like, okay time to start something new

3093
03:31:17,580 --> 03:31:21,740
And the other thing that's been in the back of your mind that you didn't think you'd be able to get to because you had to

3094
03:31:21,740 --> 03:31:27,100
Just do this other thing first. You'll be able to start so that we'll have to do with adventure

3095
03:31:27,180 --> 03:31:29,740
I don't know. I feel like something you have want to like go on a trip

3142
03:36:10,300 --> 03:36:12,300

Do you perhaps live in the castle me or or doki?

3147
03:36:40,220 --> 03:36:42,220
I

03:36:42,620 --> 03:36:45,180
Don't know why something keeps telling me get over yourself

3152
03:37:04,300 --> 03:37:06,300
Yeah

3153
03:37:06,620 --> 03:37:09,340
All right, you got six of cups, which is nostalgia

3154
03:37:10,620 --> 03:37:19,340
Childhood or the past memories familiarity gifts innocence or reunion joy healing comfort sentimentality and pleasure

3155
03:37:19,660 --> 03:37:23,420
I feel like this is someone that you either dated previously

3156
03:37:23,740 --> 03:37:29,500
Or they give you like a childhood friend that you grew up with and you're kind of jealous about how they're growing

3157
03:37:30,220 --> 03:37:32,140
um

3158
03:37:32,140 --> 03:37:34,700
Or stop screaming. Um

3159
03:37:36,780 --> 03:37:43,020
You're kind of jealous of been what's been going on in their life and what they've been attaining

3160
03:37:43,900 --> 03:37:51,420
And you kind of looking at yourself and you're like, what's wrong with me? Why don't I have this? I deserve some of this like

3161
03:37:52,700 --> 03:37:54,700
You know

3162
03:37:54,780 --> 03:37:56,780
um

3163
03:37:57,740 --> 03:38:04,700
I know welcome back. There's no flop jack. I'm even about a Sapphire. Oh man. That was a great show. Um

3164
03:38:06,460 --> 03:38:08,460
Yeah, I like our so it's either

3165
03:38:09,260 --> 03:38:10,940

03:38:10,940 --> 03:38:13,180
No, I'm not I'm not gonna say that. Um

3167
03:38:16,060 --> 03:38:19,900
Could you're also like kind of like lingering on the past a lot?

3168
03:38:21,740 --> 03:38:23,660
like

3169
03:38:23,660 --> 03:38:28,060
Oh, but like when I like I I can't talk

3170
03:38:29,820 --> 03:38:31,820
Sorry, give me a second

3171
03:38:37,660 --> 03:38:41,900
You're just jealous of everybody around you that you grew up with or something. I don't even like

3172
03:38:44,620 --> 03:38:46,620
You're just looking at other people

3173
03:38:46,620 --> 03:38:49,820
Oh, I like or again or like I said, or it's like an x

3174
03:38:50,300 --> 03:38:55,900
Like a childhood friend or like someone that you dated and you're just kind of like frustrated seeing where they're at

3175
03:38:57,180 --> 03:39:01,820
And you're kind of like what about me and then your spiritual teams talk to say

3176
03:39:01,820 --> 03:39:04,300
I don't know why I'm talking like a like a tomboy

3177
03:39:04,860 --> 03:39:09,900
But your spiritual teams like come on you like stop lingering on it get over yourself like stop

3178
03:39:10,780 --> 03:39:14,540
Because you got you got this thing got ace of swords staring you in the face

3179
03:39:14,860 --> 03:39:20,700
You got a breakthrough. You got truth new insights new ideas vision focus mental clarity and success

3180
03:39:21,340 --> 03:39:28,380
But this jealousy keeps preventing you from moving forward. So you're stuck in the nine of swords, which is anxiety

3181
03:39:28,940 --> 03:39:30,140
depression

3182
03:39:30,140 --> 03:39:35,900
sleepless nights because you're so fucking jealous winding why everybody's doing this and you're not and you need stop to compare yourself to people

3183
03:39:37,020 --> 03:39:38,460
because

3184
03:39:38,460 --> 03:39:40,460
um

3185
03:39:40,700 --> 03:39:42,700
I really people like

3186
03:39:42,700 --> 03:39:47,660
Adults will look at people their own age and see their successes and wonder why they're not in the same spot

3187
03:39:47,660 --> 03:39:52,060
But they forget that everybody has a different journey spiritual and physical and you need to like stop

3188
03:39:54,620 --> 03:40:00,860
Um overthinking fear nightmares paranoia negativity isolation despair stop it

3189
03:40:01,580 --> 03:40:02,700
stop

3190
03:40:02,700 --> 03:40:04,700
Bow bow stop it

3191
03:40:04,940 --> 03:40:06,940
Bow bow bow bow bow

3192
03:40:07,340 --> 03:40:11,180
Um tarot cards are a divination tool if you're new hello

3193
03:40:13,180 --> 03:40:15,180
Um

3194
03:40:15,740 --> 03:40:17,740
The jealousy is holding you back

3195
03:40:19,180 --> 03:40:25,020
And I know it's like you're wondering how to manage your jealousy and that's what it literally is this is like stop

3196
03:40:26,060 --> 03:40:32,940
Worrying about other people like you're preventing yourself because you're worrying about other people and you're caught up about where you should be

3197
03:40:33,180 --> 03:40:36,140
When you're not just like happy with what you've accomplished and

3198
03:40:36,700 --> 03:40:41,500
You're comparing yourself to other people or you're comparing yourself to this guy that that dude

3199
03:40:42,620 --> 03:40:46,540
That that dude that that girl has been seeing that you've been pissed about

3200
03:40:48,300 --> 03:40:54,460
And you're like whatever bro, she wasn't for you you spoke to teams like she wasn't for you bro get over it

3201
03:40:55,820 --> 03:40:58,540
And again, if like one part like this might not

3202
03:40:59,500 --> 03:41:04,620
Like if you're this isn't your reading but this speaks to you like you need to you needed to hear this by the way

3203
03:41:05,260 --> 03:41:07,260
um

3204
03:41:08,300 --> 03:41:10,300
But yeah, like I

3205
03:41:10,300 --> 03:41:12,300
I'm just like I'm like angry

3206
03:41:13,420 --> 03:41:16,860
Like I'm just like I feel like you've been feeling with this a lot

3207
03:41:17,820 --> 03:41:21,500
Like this feeling a lot and you're like team is like kind of sick of it

3208
03:41:23,020 --> 03:41:25,020
They're just like dude

3209
03:41:25,900 --> 03:41:27,900
Is not that deep

3210
03:41:29,500 --> 03:41:31,500
And they're kind of just like over

3211
03:41:33,340 --> 03:41:37,580
I don't know why that's the feeling I get I'm just like it's like frustration

3212
03:41:39,740 --> 03:41:46,140
Um, maybe it also could be a little bit of frustration in your part. Sorry to bring you down to your brain and

3213
03:41:49,100 --> 03:41:52,300
They just want what's best for you and they know that's not what they don't they know

3214
03:41:52,300 --> 03:41:54,780
That's not what's good for you. You know that didn't make any sense

3215
03:41:54,780 --> 03:41:58,060
Because you know what I was trying to say they know that's not good for you

3216
03:41:59,740 --> 03:42:01,740
um

3217
03:42:02,300 --> 03:42:06,860
Night of cups creativity romance charming imagination

3218
03:42:07,580 --> 03:42:09,900
Idealist beauty graceful artistic

3219
03:42:10,460 --> 03:42:17,740
I think that's an autistic tactful diplomatic mediator negotiator. These are those traits you do have and you're not using any of them

3220
03:42:18,460 --> 03:42:20,460
stop

3221
03:42:20,460 --> 03:42:22,140
ah

3222
03:42:22,140 --> 03:42:24,140
Stop being jealous

3223
03:42:25,580 --> 03:42:27,580
This is me shaking you

3224
03:42:30,380 --> 03:42:32,380
That candle's still holding on

3225
03:42:34,940 --> 03:42:39,580
Oh, see everybody loves you. You don't have to be jealous of anything just work on just focus on yourself

3226
03:42:40,460 --> 03:42:47,980
Move in silence get your own bags sis. You know does that make any sense? Does that like resonate at all? I'm so sorry. I was like

3227
03:42:49,260 --> 03:42:51,260
Yeah

3228
03:42:51,580 --> 03:42:52,940
You're enough

3229
03:42:52,940 --> 03:42:55,740
You're enough exactly you're enough

3230
03:42:59,660 --> 03:43:05,020
Uh that was for you bro if she breathes just focus on yourself

3231
03:43:12,860 --> 03:43:14,860
Hell yeah

3232
03:43:14,860 --> 03:43:16,860
I

3233
03:43:17,100 --> 03:43:19,100
Canough precisely

3234
03:43:20,300 --> 03:43:24,780
Think parts resonated cool. That's all that matters if something sometimes like

3235
03:43:25,660 --> 03:43:29,420
I'll tell you something and it might not be like entirely

3236
03:43:30,540 --> 03:43:36,460
What you were expecting to hear wanting to hear but you'll hear something that you need to hear at least

3237
03:43:37,340 --> 03:43:39,740
You know like there'd be one part that just like

3238
03:43:40,380 --> 03:43:44,620
Sometimes you need to hear something coming from somebody else like you've been telling yourself it before

3239
03:43:46,380 --> 03:43:49,660
Sometimes you just need to hear it from like a bunny anime girl on the internet, you know

3240
03:43:51,660 --> 03:43:53,820
Why was that four out of ten?

3241
03:43:56,140 --> 03:43:57,820
Um

3242
03:43:57,820 --> 03:43:59,820
Doki I legit but we are

3243
03:44:02,140 --> 03:44:04,140
Oh, maybe it's art related

3244
03:44:04,700 --> 03:44:06,700
Maybe it's like I'm not a good enough artist

3245
03:44:07,500 --> 03:44:09,900
I mean, that's why stop comparing yourself to other people

3246
03:44:16,300 --> 03:44:23,180
That was a weak burp you're a weak bitch now what sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean

3247
03:44:37,260 --> 03:44:39,260
Uh

3248
03:44:41,500 --> 03:44:47,500
I'm a scorpio. I got divorced at the end of last year. What's in store for my love life in the next year. Okay, and non amuse

3249
03:44:48,780 --> 03:44:54,460
Love reading love reading. Let's get a love reading. Do you think you're yours?

3250
03:44:55,180 --> 03:44:57,820
Do you think you need to give yourself some like some time?

3251
03:44:58,540 --> 03:45:02,460
I don't know how long you were with this person. This is just general advice by the way, but like

3252
03:45:03,420 --> 03:45:06,380
Big feeling that you need like to heal a little bit

3253
03:45:07,500 --> 03:45:09,500
and not worry about

3254
03:45:10,700 --> 03:45:15,660
Actively getting like finding someone else in love

3255
03:45:15,820 --> 03:45:20,060
I feel like this is a time for you kind of to learn a lot about yourself

3256
03:45:20,780 --> 03:45:23,500
With this free time because sometimes you're with someone

3257
03:45:25,100 --> 03:45:27,100
For a long time

3258
03:45:27,420 --> 03:45:29,180
and you forget

3259
03:45:29,180 --> 03:45:31,180
About your individuality

3260
03:45:31,500 --> 03:45:37,260
Or how you were before you were with them the best type of partner is where you can be yourself and to kind of just grow

3261
03:45:37,820 --> 03:45:41,500
But if you feel like you're living as somebody else to be with your

3262
03:45:42,140 --> 03:45:47,260
Partner, then that's not the thing and I feel like next year for you

3263
03:45:47,260 --> 03:45:51,260
I don't even have to pull cards for this will be kind of a year of like self-discovery

3264
03:45:51,260 --> 03:46:01,260
That's great advice. Let's do it. Um, but yeah, let's

3265
03:46:02,780 --> 03:46:07,660
You didn't mean it. It was dessert. Let's let's let's get some cards

3266
03:46:08,700 --> 03:46:12,860
Full unknown he moves. I knew they said that they talked at one point, but I can't recall

3267
03:46:13,580 --> 03:46:15,580
What the name was that spoke

3268
03:46:16,700 --> 03:46:21,020
Regarding the the horse. I know it was a dr. P. It was somebody else

3269
03:46:21,740 --> 03:46:27,180
Something original. Yes, you're married for six years, but we had a pretty healthy relationship. We weren't trying to live for through each other. Okay

3270
03:46:33,020 --> 03:46:35,020
Why'd you get divorced? I'm sorry

3271
03:46:36,380 --> 03:46:38,380
Do you guys have like different like

3272
03:46:38,940 --> 03:46:44,220
Directions you wanted to go in like I don't know how you expect the date or like love life stuff

3273
03:46:44,780 --> 03:46:48,220
If you guys are living together, I'm just a little lost

3274
03:46:48,940 --> 03:46:53,420
Are you guys like Polly you're gonna be okay if you start like

3275
03:46:54,540 --> 03:46:59,420
So she starts seeing other people. I have a lot of questions. I'm kind of interested in the tea

3276
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:05,340
I was married for ten years you team were done different life priorities

3277
03:47:06,300 --> 03:47:13,580
Also, he realized he was trans and I'm straight. I got a bit complicated. Also were Polly. Okay. All right. It's funny because like I had a friend

3278
03:47:13,980 --> 03:47:15,180
um

3279
03:47:15,180 --> 03:47:16,780
Who got married?

3280
03:47:16,780 --> 03:47:18,780
they were a lesbian couple and

3281
03:47:19,660 --> 03:47:21,660
One of them discovered he was trans

3282
03:47:22,220 --> 03:47:28,540
and it did like you're totally entitled if you're like not attracted to that like that

3283
03:47:29,500 --> 03:47:31,500
gender like

3284
03:47:31,660 --> 03:47:32,860
to

3285
03:47:32,860 --> 03:47:34,860
Really it's it's I bet it's hard

3286
03:47:35,500 --> 03:47:36,940
because

3287
03:47:36,940 --> 03:47:42,540
Honestly, I can't really speak on it because I've never had the experience but seeing what like my friends because they're both my friends

3288
03:47:42,540 --> 03:47:45,900
what they went through because they were trying to make it work, but it was just like

3289
03:47:47,500 --> 03:47:50,060
Yeah, it was definitely the like different life priorities

3290
03:47:53,340 --> 03:47:55,340
Hi Nori

3291
03:47:59,580 --> 03:48:04,300
Yeah, yeah, I wasn't like oh yeah, like it's not like you give it a good try like you know

3292
03:48:04,300 --> 03:48:07,020
Go don't you for that. It's hard because like

3293
03:48:07,740 --> 03:48:09,020
if you're

3294
03:48:09,020 --> 03:48:13,260
Like a man and you're not attracted to men, but your partner decides they want to be him

3295
03:48:13,260 --> 03:48:16,220
It's hard because you know you try to push through you try to love them

3296
03:48:16,220 --> 03:48:21,260
But like your your body, you know loves what they love. So it's like I can't can't you know

3297
03:48:21,260 --> 03:48:25,260
I can't can't really blame you for that. Thank you for being honest about that by the way

3298
03:48:25,660 --> 03:48:30,860
I I really appreciate you being vulnerable in the chat right now and kind of telling telling what's going on

3299
03:48:32,380 --> 03:48:34,380
Hi Nori

3300
03:48:43,420 --> 03:48:45,420
And

3301
03:48:49,660 --> 03:48:55,420
Again, I apologize something original because I what I've been telling you a lot hasn't been like resonating with you a lot

3302
03:48:55,500 --> 03:49:00,860
So I hope this reading the cards will resonate with you if they don't I apologize

3303
03:49:01,340 --> 03:49:06,460
Um, but yeah, so I hope I hope you do get something out of this

3304
03:49:06,780 --> 03:49:12,140
Maybe just even talking about it is like good. I know you guys had an amicable

3305
03:49:13,500 --> 03:49:17,580
Break-up and stuff, but you know still sometimes it's just good to like talk like it still hurts

3306
03:49:17,820 --> 03:49:21,980
You know when you have to when you end a relationship poly or otherwise. I bet

3307
03:49:25,100 --> 03:49:30,540
I hope I love you what nori nori you're not even

3308
03:49:32,060 --> 03:49:34,060
That doesn't make any sense

3309
03:49:43,260 --> 03:49:45,260
Oh

3310
03:50:14,220 --> 03:50:16,220
Oh

3311
03:50:24,540 --> 03:50:27,260
I don't know why the song

3312
03:50:29,900 --> 03:50:32,700
Popped into my head um

3313
03:50:35,900 --> 03:50:39,020
From what is it called trolling the chocolate factory

3314
03:50:39,820 --> 03:50:42,620
Trauma bowl the chat I brought the bowl

3315
03:50:45,660 --> 03:50:47,660
Um

3316
03:50:49,660 --> 03:50:51,660
The trolling the chocolate factory song

3317
03:50:51,820 --> 03:50:59,420
If you want to view paradise simply look around and view it so I feel like

3318
03:51:04,780 --> 03:51:06,780
I feel like

3319
03:51:07,500 --> 03:51:12,220
It'll be a lot of just like taking in the the flowers and like kind of just like

3320
03:51:13,580 --> 03:51:18,060
Seeing the good the next year just like staying positive

3321
03:51:19,020 --> 03:51:20,220
you know

3322
03:51:20,220 --> 03:51:22,220
I actually said you go mirror about it earlier

3323
03:51:22,380 --> 03:51:26,940
Because what you said really impacted me, but I didn't want to feel feels dump in the chat. Oh, that's okay

3324
03:51:27,900 --> 03:51:29,900
This is this is a fine time to do it

3325
03:51:30,700 --> 03:51:32,380
like that's

3326
03:51:32,380 --> 03:51:34,380
Because I'm asking you so don't feel bad

3327
03:51:34,700 --> 03:51:37,980
Hi rena you need to get off my desk

3328
03:51:38,780 --> 03:51:41,740
There's too much on my desk right now. Really pilot. Do you want to say hi?

3329
03:51:42,380 --> 03:51:44,380
Here you can say hi to chat

3330
03:51:46,460 --> 03:51:48,460
It's rena

3331
03:51:52,620 --> 03:51:54,620
You don't see rena that often

3332
03:51:55,020 --> 03:51:57,020
You

3333
03:52:02,540 --> 03:52:04,540
So you have the hierophant

3334
03:52:07,820 --> 03:52:14,380
Oh my god, I can't hear my freaking nose now in reverse you have seven of pentacles

3335
03:52:16,940 --> 03:52:23,020
And upright and upright and then you have um the sun

3336
03:52:23,980 --> 03:52:29,660
In reverse and it's funny because it says literally the first thing is this feeling down temporary

3337
03:52:30,300 --> 03:52:35,740
So, of course, you're naturally going to go through this period where you just feel sad you feel down, but I'll get to that

3338
03:52:37,420 --> 03:52:39,420
So the hierophant

3339
03:52:39,980 --> 03:52:45,020
Is usually represented by like a priest usually represents like traditional and it's funny

3340
03:52:46,220 --> 03:52:48,220
because um

3341
03:52:48,220 --> 03:52:52,700
You don't have a traditional sort of relationship, you know

3342
03:52:53,180 --> 03:52:55,180
Bye rena

3343
03:52:57,260 --> 03:53:02,940
Do you all care if you share something that's been going on if you'll want me to that's just thing go saying something's going on there recently. Um

3344
03:53:05,100 --> 03:53:10,460
You can that's fine. Uh, I won't be able to acknowledge it until after the reading that I hope you don't mind

3345
03:53:11,740 --> 03:53:13,260
Oh, yeah

3346
03:53:13,260 --> 03:53:18,460
But just so you guys know. Yes, um, like when I'm doing your personal reading for someone, it's fine

3347
03:53:19,260 --> 03:53:24,620
But normally I don't usually allow, you know trauma dumping in chat, but you know, it's fine

3348
03:53:26,140 --> 03:53:31,660
Sometimes it's good to get it out. Sometimes chat can be your therapist. But anyways, let me continue. That is burning bright

3349
03:53:33,340 --> 03:53:35,180
so

3350
03:53:35,180 --> 03:53:41,900
I feel like sticking to your personal beliefs and kind of staying true to yourself is very beneficial for you right now

3351
03:53:42,460 --> 03:53:47,260
um non commitment again, I feel it's really relevant to the um

3352
03:53:48,460 --> 03:53:49,820
poly stuff

3353
03:53:49,820 --> 03:53:54,300
Uh challenging belief and authority originality rebellion and conventionality and new methods

3354
03:53:54,940 --> 03:53:58,780
I feel like you're going I I do feel like you're going to get into a relationship

3355
03:53:59,180 --> 03:54:01,180
interestingly enough like pretty soon

3356
03:54:01,900 --> 03:54:03,900
um

3357
03:54:04,380 --> 03:54:10,700
I feel like this person is going to kind of match your energy and be like kind of this rebellious

3358
03:54:11,740 --> 03:54:13,420
sort of

3359
03:54:13,420 --> 03:54:14,780
person

3360
03:54:15,180 --> 03:54:18,780
And they're going to be kind of okay with your lifestyle and what you've been through

3361
03:54:19,500 --> 03:54:21,500
um, and they're going to respect

3362
03:54:22,140 --> 03:54:23,980
Kind of like your own

3363
03:54:23,980 --> 03:54:28,940
Aspirations and belief system and all that stuff and it's kind they're just going to mesh with you pretty well

3364
03:54:29,740 --> 03:54:31,500
um

3365
03:54:31,500 --> 03:54:33,500
I just yeah, I feel like that's

3366
03:54:34,780 --> 03:54:36,460
Like this is

3367
03:54:36,460 --> 03:54:38,460
It's pretty straightforward

3368
03:54:38,940 --> 03:54:40,700
um

3369
03:54:40,700 --> 03:54:43,500
It's going to happen in a roundabout way that you don't expect

3370
03:54:44,860 --> 03:54:52,060
Like you're it's like, you know, you find love in the most unconventional places. Um, seven appendicles long-term investments again

3371
03:54:53,260 --> 03:55:00,700
All right, like I'm saying I feel like you'll be getting into a relationship pretty soon. It will be a long-term investment, you know

3372
03:55:01,500 --> 03:55:05,820
Uh sustained patience. It's going to take time. It's going to be you know

3373
03:55:06,540 --> 03:55:08,220
a learning curve

3374
03:55:08,220 --> 03:55:11,980
While you live with this person and kind of just like being

3375
03:55:12,460 --> 03:55:14,780
With other people then being with other people

3376
03:55:15,420 --> 03:55:17,420
um

3377
03:55:17,740 --> 03:55:19,180
uh

3378
03:55:19,180 --> 03:55:21,740
Because I like I've had because like I've had friends

3379
03:55:22,380 --> 03:55:23,340
um

3380
03:55:23,340 --> 03:55:29,500
Well, I had friends. They're still friends. Uh, I have a friend who is Polly and she has told me

3381
03:55:30,380 --> 03:55:31,740
um

3382
03:55:31,740 --> 03:55:33,740
Kind of like the mental

3383
03:55:34,140 --> 03:55:37,500
Life's like it's like I because I I personally don't

3384
03:55:38,140 --> 03:55:40,140
understand it or subscribe to that

3385
03:55:40,780 --> 03:55:46,540
But I was curious so I asked her to explain it to me because I like to know the why and the how behind things

3386
03:55:47,180 --> 03:55:51,980
And I know that trust and communication is a very big part of relationships in general

3387
03:55:51,980 --> 03:55:55,980
But especially when you're in like what like a what's it called like a polyamory?

3388
03:55:56,940 --> 03:55:58,300
poly

3389
03:55:58,300 --> 03:55:59,340
Q

3390
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:01,980
poly couple, I don't know. Um

3391
03:56:03,500 --> 03:56:05,500
But it's going it's going to take

3392
03:56:06,140 --> 03:56:12,380
It's like yes, like of course you can like date other people while you're dating while you were with that person

3393
03:56:12,380 --> 03:56:14,380
but still gonna hurt

3394
03:56:15,100 --> 03:56:16,620
You know because

3395
03:56:16,620 --> 03:56:21,180
And introducing somebody else to the relationship is requires a lot of trust

3396
03:56:21,820 --> 03:56:23,820
And now that you guys are completely separate

3397
03:56:24,620 --> 03:56:29,740
Um, it's going to take a lot of like patience to introduce this person into your life

3398
03:56:30,140 --> 03:56:37,100
Well, also not being complete but while being completely separated from this person. It's going to be kind of a new experience. Um,

3399
03:56:37,740 --> 03:56:39,260
but yeah

3400
03:56:39,260 --> 03:56:44,380
I hope that makes sense. It's hard to talk because again, I'm not super familiar on the subject

3401
03:56:45,100 --> 03:56:46,700
um

3402
03:56:46,700 --> 03:56:50,860
But yeah, but then like after the hard work and the perseverance of working on this relationship

3403
03:56:51,340 --> 03:56:58,620
You'll you know, you'll start stuff with them. Maybe you'll be able to you know move out or it's still say amicable with your ex

3404
03:56:59,340 --> 03:57:01,340
um

3405
03:57:01,340 --> 03:57:05,340
That's tough though. That's tough six years. That's pretty tough. Um

3406
03:57:06,460 --> 03:57:10,940
And then, you know, it'll it'll be it'll be a growth period

3407
03:57:13,900 --> 03:57:18,140
Harvest results profits and planning. Yeah, and then you know

3408
03:57:19,180 --> 03:57:24,140
I feel good about it. I feel really good about it. You'll have this temp of the sun in reverse

3409
03:57:24,380 --> 03:57:26,620
You'll have this temporary feeling down

3410
03:57:27,580 --> 03:57:29,580
um

3411
03:57:30,140 --> 03:57:32,140
And

3412
03:57:33,420 --> 03:57:40,720
Hold on my cats are doing something. There'll be an interruption probably. I see you playing it. Hello. What are you doing?

3413
03:57:56,620 --> 03:57:58,620
Hey

3414
03:58:27,180 --> 03:58:29,180
Okay

3415
03:58:30,700 --> 03:58:32,700
Okay

3416
03:58:33,740 --> 03:58:35,740
All right, there might be

3417
03:58:38,540 --> 03:58:40,540
There might be um

3418
03:58:42,540 --> 03:58:45,740
It's not like you're good together rich you get to see yeah, yeah

3419
03:58:45,980 --> 03:58:49,340
like I still can't quite wear my head around it but like I I

3420
03:58:50,380 --> 03:58:52,540
I get what people mean. I just like again

3421
03:58:53,660 --> 03:58:55,660
mentally I just

3422
03:58:57,020 --> 03:58:59,020
I don't know. I just yeah

3423
03:58:59,100 --> 03:59:01,100
But that's besides the point. Um

3424
03:59:03,180 --> 03:59:07,420
Blocked happiness so uh, I feel like something will come up or someone kind of

3425
03:59:08,540 --> 03:59:12,220
tries to prevent you from getting what you want

3426
03:59:13,020 --> 03:59:13,980
um

3427
03:59:13,980 --> 03:59:17,020
Like someone's gonna come out and try to like trash everything

3428
03:59:17,900 --> 03:59:21,580
and be like super pessimistic and conceded about it like

3429
03:59:22,700 --> 03:59:24,700
Oh, just be like really kind of nasty

3430
03:59:25,660 --> 03:59:28,940
And I don't know who this is. I feel like this will be the person like I feel like your

3431
03:59:29,420 --> 03:59:33,980
X partner will also meet someone and they'll just be a dick. I'm sorry. I don't know why

3432
03:59:35,100 --> 03:59:36,380
um

3433
03:59:36,380 --> 03:59:37,740
But you know

3434
03:59:37,740 --> 03:59:41,180
Stay in your own lane and you'll be continued to be fine. Rhino. What are you doing?

3435
03:59:42,860 --> 03:59:47,020
Thank you. You're knocking stuff over. I appreciate that. Nope. Don't grab my chest

3436
03:59:47,180 --> 03:59:51,420
She always tries to grab me and then ends his subscription. Now you get put on camera for your crimes

3437
03:59:52,380 --> 03:59:54,380
Here comes the cat

3438
03:59:56,220 --> 04:00:02,700
Don't worry. She's not near the candle although she looks like she is on the camera. The light is brighter than it is. Okay

3439
04:00:05,980 --> 04:00:07,980
Um

3440
04:00:07,980 --> 04:00:13,500
He already met like three people two of whom are really bad. Yeah, so like I feel like they just

3441
04:00:14,300 --> 04:00:16,300
Not cool peeps, you know

3442
04:00:16,300 --> 04:00:18,300
sorry

3443
04:00:18,300 --> 04:00:21,340
I forgot their pronouns. I apologize. Um

3444
04:00:23,100 --> 04:00:26,780
I imagine the polycule was almost as good as the challenge is needed for community to trust

3445
04:00:27,420 --> 04:00:30,860
Full people. Yeah, I could not handle more than one person

3446
04:00:31,740 --> 04:00:33,740
Are we a polycule guys?

3447
04:00:35,260 --> 04:00:37,260
Wait

3448
04:00:38,220 --> 04:00:40,220
Wait a second

3449
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:43,660
Huh, wait a sec

3450
04:00:44,940 --> 04:00:46,940

3452
04:00:52,860 --> 04:00:54,860
Yeah

3453
04:00:56,380 --> 04:00:58,380
Look the thousands in polish

3454
04:01:00,780 --> 04:01:02,780
I don't know

3455
04:01:03,900 --> 04:01:05,900
Is it a slip pop

3456
04:01:06,460 --> 04:01:14,220
All right, but I hope that makes sense. Yeah, I feel like you'll get like I just feel really good about like you'll get what you need

3457
04:01:15,180 --> 04:01:17,180
Pretty soon

3458
04:01:18,220 --> 04:01:20,220
Yeah, stay hopeful

3459
04:01:21,820 --> 04:01:23,820
Where does cards go?

3460
04:01:29,180 --> 04:01:31,180
Listen to woman by doja cat

3461
04:01:32,140 --> 04:01:34,140
Okay

3462
04:01:43,820 --> 04:01:47,020
Hair and Malif Shibi has one collective that's true

3463
04:01:52,380 --> 04:01:56,220
For me a big part is it is it is not feeling possessive

3464
04:01:56,220 --> 04:01:58,700
Like I don't own my partner they can do what they want what's important

3465
04:01:58,700 --> 04:02:00,940
So they consider my feelings that I am there. I see

3466
04:02:01,740 --> 04:02:03,740
the possibly tarot cards for animals

3467
04:02:05,580 --> 04:02:09,260
I have met people who claim to do that. I

3468
04:02:10,540 --> 04:02:11,900
don't quite

3469
04:02:11,900 --> 04:02:13,900
believe it, but sure

3470
04:02:14,460 --> 04:02:16,460

Upside down cards are right set the reverse is actually the upright imagine. That'd be funny

3487
04:03:35,420 --> 04:03:37,420
All right

3488
04:03:37,420 --> 04:03:41,180
Everything's upside down. All right. What is emily?

3489
04:03:42,460 --> 04:03:44,460
half in store

3490
04:03:45,020 --> 04:03:47,340
For the month of september actually hold on

3491
04:03:52,700 --> 04:03:54,700
I

3492
04:03:55,820 --> 04:03:57,820
Distractions

3493
04:04:01,180 --> 04:04:04,060
It's my cat or distract me again. Hello

3494
04:04:07,340 --> 04:04:09,340
What are you doing

3495
04:04:16,700 --> 04:04:18,700
I don't know what's happening

3496
04:04:22,940 --> 04:04:24,940
What

3497
04:04:25,260 --> 04:04:27,660
Then they go quiet. That's so weird

3498
04:04:31,420 --> 04:04:33,420
Why are you guys making those eyes?

3499
04:04:35,900 --> 04:04:38,460
I thought it was hello no ghost

3500
04:04:53,020 --> 04:04:59,020
It's funny everything's coming out upside down

3501
04:05:04,540 --> 04:05:06,540
I can't

3502
04:05:07,820 --> 04:05:09,980
Why is everything coming out in reverse?

3503
04:05:13,820 --> 04:05:21,020
Some visitors are peeking the camera. What do you mean? Looking respectfully

3504
04:05:23,660 --> 04:05:25,660
I don't

3505
04:05:26,380 --> 04:05:29,820
Okay, I was about to be this is also in reverse. I'm gonna have some issues

3506
04:05:35,580 --> 04:05:38,620
Well reverse doesn't mean bad it just means like

3507
04:05:39,740 --> 04:05:43,420
Honestly, it could mean any kind of mean again. No cards are bad

3508
04:05:45,580 --> 04:05:49,340
All right, we got two swords in reverse king of cups in reverse and we got two cups

3509
04:05:50,220 --> 04:05:52,220
upright

3510
04:05:52,700 --> 04:05:54,700
Are you

3511
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:02,140
Why does this feel relationship related?

3512
04:06:11,740 --> 04:06:15,740
I feel like I'm completely wrong about this, but I'm just gonna say what I'm gonna say

3513
04:06:18,620 --> 04:06:20,300
Um

3514
04:06:20,300 --> 04:06:22,780
Chat am I missing the what why are you guys looking?

3515
04:06:25,260 --> 04:06:27,260
What I don't understand

3516
04:06:31,420 --> 04:06:33,740
Oh wait, I looked over at my camera

3517
04:06:40,380 --> 04:06:47,820
All right, now I know what you guys shut up shut up chat I see it now

3518
04:06:50,460 --> 04:06:52,220
Have you seen that tick-tock of a girl?

3519
04:06:52,220 --> 04:06:57,980
It's like when a guy is cute and he makes you laugh and she starts like laughing and then her ass looks like she just goes

3520
04:06:59,260 --> 04:07:01,260
It's like really

3521
04:07:01,420 --> 04:07:04,940
Like really exaggerated like shaking your ass. It's funny

3522
04:07:07,820 --> 04:07:09,820
I'm trying the perfect times

3523
04:07:10,300 --> 04:07:13,820
All right, Emily back to you. I don't know why I feel like

3524
04:07:14,860 --> 04:07:19,980
There is some masculine energy that's just kind of like not doing it for you

3525
04:07:21,180 --> 04:07:26,860
Um, they're not kind of emotionally vested there. Are you in a situation ship? No, I don't know

3526
04:07:27,420 --> 04:07:31,100
Um, I don't know but like just like negative masculine energy

3527
04:07:31,580 --> 04:07:33,580
anyways

3528
04:07:34,620 --> 04:07:36,620
Two of swords

3529
04:07:37,420 --> 04:07:43,180
Time to make a move reached an impasse stalemate deadlock decision conclusion to be had

3530
04:07:45,420 --> 04:07:47,420
Is someone like

3531
04:07:47,900 --> 04:07:52,860
I'm the world's most single Pringle. I'm so proud of you for that go-off sis. Um

3532
04:07:54,540 --> 04:07:57,580
I still get like some sort of masculine energy like

3533
04:07:58,540 --> 04:08:00,700
Like you're being provided with a choice

3534
04:08:01,900 --> 04:08:03,660
uh, because again

3535
04:08:03,660 --> 04:08:05,660
sort like I would say too is like

3536
04:08:06,460 --> 04:08:12,380
Choice I might get some clarification to this because like you gotta make a move you gotta move don't be in a stalemate

3537
04:08:12,380 --> 04:08:14,380
You gotta do something king of cups

3538
04:08:15,340 --> 04:08:20,140
Emotionally manipulative and abusive cold mootiness withdrawn selfish and anxious

3539
04:08:20,620 --> 04:08:26,060
Is this your dad like who who is the masculine figure in your life that is acting this way?

3540
04:08:28,300 --> 04:08:32,140
What's going on is this for somebody else?

3541
04:08:37,820 --> 04:08:39,820
You got some clarification cards

3542
04:08:41,260 --> 04:08:42,940
Oh

3543
04:08:42,940 --> 04:08:45,180
Hold on I just dropped a lot of cards

3544
04:08:52,140 --> 04:09:00,540
Is this a shitty co-worker me that's probably it because I'm like is there like some like shitty dude that like is in your life right now?

3545
04:09:02,940 --> 04:09:04,940
Yes, I did turn the thing

3546
04:09:05,500 --> 04:09:09,340
I did turn the comet thing to make it a chat box. What of it?

3547
04:09:09,740 --> 04:09:14,460
I mean to make it a webcam box because I was too lazy to make my own what of it

3548
04:09:20,780 --> 04:09:22,780
You work with all women

3549
04:09:24,060 --> 04:09:26,060
Well one of them's like no

3550
04:09:27,340 --> 04:09:29,340
What is I can't use my mouse

3551
04:09:30,140 --> 04:09:33,020
The cards are vague. You're correct. They are very vague

3552
04:09:40,300 --> 04:09:42,140
Why can't I turn my webcam back on there we go

3553
04:09:44,460 --> 04:09:48,780
Maybe whoever gets you rejected is a dude and he's in the way. Who knows camera down

3554
04:09:48,780 --> 04:09:53,580
And like I turned it off so I could bend over to take stuff up because I didn't want to be sheen

3555
04:10:03,340 --> 04:10:05,900
Again this could be stuff that happened by the way

3556
04:10:05,900 --> 04:10:10,460
Like it doesn't have to be immediately happening because it's for the month of September. So just like

3557
04:10:11,820 --> 04:10:15,020
Be on the lookout for a really shitty dude. I don't know why just like

3558
04:10:16,380 --> 04:10:18,780
There is a really shitty dude around

3559
04:10:19,820 --> 04:10:21,980
Um, I'm gonna get some clarification quads

3560
04:10:24,140 --> 04:10:28,220
It's funny because these are cards that fell the lovers in reverse

3561
04:10:30,140 --> 04:10:32,140
The emperor

3562
04:10:32,540 --> 04:10:34,540
Queen of wands in reverse

3563
04:10:35,900 --> 04:10:38,220
Those are the cards that fell. I don't know if they mean anything

3564
04:10:39,740 --> 04:10:43,900
But I just feel like be on your guard. Someone shitty is happening. Um

3565
04:10:49,340 --> 04:10:56,940
Let me get some clarification because I could be it seems like I like these don't resonate so I might be totally reading them wrong

3566
04:10:58,460 --> 04:11:03,020
Because it seems like this looks like a love reading at first glance, but it's it's clearly not

3567
04:11:06,860 --> 04:11:08,860
I'm missing key information

3568
04:11:19,020 --> 04:11:21,020
It's good thing you work with all women that must be fun

3569
04:11:36,300 --> 04:11:38,300
I

3570
04:11:45,180 --> 04:11:47,180
Is it a shitty job

3571
04:11:52,140 --> 04:11:55,500
Because it's literally is coming off like a love reading for some reason

3572
04:11:56,860 --> 04:12:00,860
You got the devil in reverse knight of swords and you got three of wands

3573
04:12:01,020 --> 04:12:06,860
The cards are not carding what's going on

3574
04:12:11,420 --> 04:12:13,580
My candle is twitching a lot in reply

3575
04:12:15,500 --> 04:12:17,500
Tension in the workplace

3576
04:12:19,340 --> 04:12:21,340
I can't put my finger on it

3577
04:12:24,700 --> 04:12:27,980
Because it says leaving an abusive toxic situation

3578
04:12:28,380 --> 04:12:35,580
And I'm like toxic relationship. I just feel like you should be on your guard from like either a toxic friendship like a dude

3579
04:12:36,380 --> 04:12:40,060
Like I'm getting a lot of negative masculine energy from this

3580
04:12:41,900 --> 04:12:45,340
Because you have knight of swords ambitious fast thinking

3581
04:12:46,380 --> 04:12:47,980
perfectionists

3582
04:12:47,980 --> 04:12:49,980
dare like I feel like there's a

3583
04:12:50,940 --> 04:12:55,100
Dude this doesn't think before he leaps and he's kind of a prick

3584
04:12:56,060 --> 04:12:58,300
It seems like Emily is unreadable. She could be

3585
04:13:01,020 --> 04:13:03,020
Recovery

3586
04:13:05,980 --> 04:13:14,060
Leaving a piece of attachment freedom facing shadows independence reclaiming power could be leaving the job

3587
04:13:14,060 --> 04:13:29,020
Toss the crappy yeah, I just feel like you should just like there'll be a really like negative male energy that comes along

3588
04:13:30,140 --> 04:13:32,540
And I just really want you to be on their guard because they

3589
04:13:33,420 --> 04:13:34,780
Suck again

3590
04:13:34,780 --> 04:13:39,980
This isn't stuff that is happening now to stuff to be out where for a month of september

3591
04:13:40,300 --> 04:13:46,860
So for you in particular Emily, I feel like if you have any male friends or if you have any

3592
04:13:48,940 --> 04:13:53,340
Like people like again male like this could be just like masculine energy

3593
04:13:53,980 --> 04:14:00,060
You know, I couldn't it doesn't have to be a dude. Um, just be on the like I feel like someone's just gonna be a major

3594
04:14:01,340 --> 04:14:06,060
Toxic person and show their true colors the way I'm looking at this

3595
04:14:06,380 --> 04:14:12,140
You'll have however, you'll have one person in your corner that sticks up for you with those two of cups

3596
04:14:12,940 --> 04:14:14,940
They got your back

3597
04:14:15,260 --> 04:14:18,780
But you gotta be careful because somebody else is lurking around

3598
04:14:19,420 --> 04:14:22,700
Going after you they're trying to shit on you the month of september

3599
04:14:24,540 --> 04:14:26,300
um

3600
04:14:26,300 --> 04:14:28,300
Guys you don't have to

3601
04:14:28,700 --> 04:14:33,580
Guys you don't have to try to rationalize the cards to fit her if it doesn't fit if it doesn't resonate

3602
04:14:33,580 --> 04:14:39,020
That doesn't resonate if it doesn't make any sense to her then it then it's not for her, you know, and then it doesn't

3603
04:14:39,580 --> 04:14:41,580
Yeah, that's good

3604
04:14:42,140 --> 04:14:45,100
It's a masculine energy aggressive. No not per se

3605
04:14:46,380 --> 04:14:48,300
not really

3606
04:14:48,300 --> 04:14:50,300
Me trying to tarot

3607
04:14:50,700 --> 04:14:58,300
Yeah, you don't have to try to like contort the cards into like someone's situation because then it's then it's not really a reading

3608
04:14:58,380 --> 04:15:01,500
You know, but for me what I think

3609
04:15:02,060 --> 04:15:04,940
Tdlr just getting tl dr

3610
04:15:06,220 --> 04:15:08,220
There will be someone

3611
04:15:08,300 --> 04:15:10,300
with masculine energy

3612
04:15:10,540 --> 04:15:15,500
And here i'll tell you what masculine energy means. Let me just look up some sort of freaking definition

3613
04:15:16,300 --> 04:15:18,860
divine masculine energy

3614
04:15:21,420 --> 04:15:25,980
Uh, so divine masculine is a spiritual concept that represents sense of qualities

3615
04:15:26,540 --> 04:15:31,420
um traditionally associated with masculinity which is strength action rationality integrity and emotional integrity

3616
04:15:31,980 --> 04:15:37,820
So there should be someone who has these really positive qualities, but they're gonna turn out to be a piece of shit. Um, so be careful

3617
04:15:39,740 --> 04:15:43,820
You'll have somebody in your corner that will back you up and support you. Um

3618
04:15:45,420 --> 04:15:50,700
There might be delays and stuff that you've been working on because of this person they'll kind of try to like undermine you

3619
04:15:51,660 --> 04:15:55,500
Lack of planning and progress setback obstacles frustration unexpected delays

3620
04:15:56,140 --> 04:15:59,180
Yeah, unexpectedly this person's just like like wait

3621
04:15:59,900 --> 04:16:01,900
They were a dick

3622
04:16:02,060 --> 04:16:05,420
What like that's kind of it. Um, and then

3623
04:16:06,220 --> 04:16:08,460
Yeah, then the devil. Yeah, they're really like I just

3624
04:16:10,620 --> 04:16:12,620
Be careful just be careful

3625
04:16:15,740 --> 04:16:17,740
I hope that doesn't resonate

3626
04:16:18,060 --> 04:16:21,100
Because that just sounds like it just sucks like this person's just shitty

3627
04:16:21,900 --> 04:16:24,060
I hope that that doesn't happen to you the month of september

3628
04:16:24,860 --> 04:16:28,380
Oh, yeah, I honestly hope it doesn't resonate at all. I hope i'm full of shit right now

3629
04:16:29,260 --> 04:16:33,180
I hope i'm i'm out of spirit juice because I am super tired actually

3630
04:16:33,260 --> 04:16:38,060
It's only 10 18 and i've already taken a nap and i'm stupid tired. Uh, let me see who

3631
04:16:39,020 --> 04:16:44,380
Um toxic guy once he shows up. Hey Emily psych blocks a voice

3632
04:16:46,620 --> 04:16:50,380
Yeah spirit juice. Yeah, i'm out of spirit juice, man

3633
04:16:52,860 --> 04:16:57,660
Maybe the yeah, if a yeah, maybe the plan is she stays a single pringle true. That's a good point

3634
04:16:59,580 --> 04:17:04,860
Could be someone comes up. They're like, hey, you want to go on a date and you're like you seem like sleazy as hell

3635
04:17:05,740 --> 04:17:07,740
No, thank

3636
04:17:07,740 --> 04:17:09,340
Okay

3637
04:17:09,340 --> 04:17:12,300
Emily i'm so sorry if that didn't resonate again

3638
04:17:12,940 --> 04:17:15,260
It doesn't have to just take with the grain of salt

3639
04:17:15,900 --> 04:17:18,620
There's a remaining guard. Yeah, I feel like just be on your guard

3640
04:17:20,300 --> 04:17:23,180
Someone's not too nice right now. Just be just that's all I gotta say

3641
04:17:24,300 --> 04:17:26,300
um

3642
04:17:26,460 --> 04:17:28,460
I'm

3643
04:17:28,780 --> 04:17:30,780
Guys trying to take Emily

3644
04:17:32,460 --> 04:17:34,460
Um

3645
04:17:38,620 --> 04:17:43,660
I'ma chalk up no one's special question to did I make the right choice?

3646
04:17:51,900 --> 04:17:55,100
You guys have sad names, why is your name no one special?

3647
04:17:57,180 --> 04:17:59,180
Alien invasion

3648
04:18:01,740 --> 04:18:05,900
What's what's happening? There's an alien invasion

3649
04:18:10,140 --> 04:18:12,620
Turn that no legs for you

3650
04:18:15,420 --> 04:18:17,920
Oh, it's a raid. Oh ali's raiding

3651
04:18:20,380 --> 04:18:23,820
There's no youtube's broken and they don't have the chat message anymore

04:18:24,700 --> 04:18:26,700

04:18:44,860 --> 04:18:46,860
Already made a spell jar

3658
04:18:47,820 --> 04:18:53,340
But I hope you stick around I am goofy. I like to do really fun voices and go and do voice acting

3659
04:18:54,780 --> 04:18:56,780
I was gonna say something stupid

3660
04:18:57,980 --> 04:19:04,780
But I'm not gonna say I'm gonna have a good impression. Oh wait. I want to make fun of uh ali for a second. Um

3661
04:19:06,620 --> 04:19:08,620
So normally

3662
04:19:08,940 --> 04:19:10,940
Normally I don't wear this outfit all the time

3663
04:19:12,620 --> 04:19:14,860
Because we me and ali have a um

3664

3665
04:19:21,500 --> 04:19:22,700
And she

3666
04:19:22,700 --> 04:19:27,740
Literally after we've been in a group chat for three days realizes that I have a ball gag

3667
04:19:28,700 --> 04:19:30,700
on my model

3668
04:19:30,780 --> 04:19:32,700
and then

3669
04:19:32,700 --> 04:19:33,820
I uh

3670
04:19:33,820 --> 04:19:36,620
In ruy are like wait. I just noticed that too

3671
04:19:37,580 --> 04:19:40,220
And then they're like I'm like, well, yeah, I'm a rope bunny

3672
04:19:42,380 --> 04:19:44,380
I have

3673
04:19:44,380 --> 04:19:49,180
I like I'm a rope bunny and I have shabari ropes and I'm a bunny. They're like you're a bunny

3674
04:19:49,980 --> 04:19:55,180
And I'm like, are you fucking with me guys? And they're like, what you got shabari ropes? I'm like guys

3675
04:19:57,420 --> 04:20:01,180
Have you guys just been staring at my boobs the entire time and they're like no and I'm like

3676
04:20:02,140 --> 04:20:04,140
Yeah

3677
04:20:04,220 --> 04:20:07,820
I feel bad because they probably can't talk because I have subscriber mode on I'm so sorry

3678
04:20:11,100 --> 04:20:13,100
Oh, but welcome raiders

3679
04:20:13,180 --> 04:20:15,900
Please stick around. Please hang out. Have a good time

3680
04:20:16,620 --> 04:20:22,940
Um, all right, so let me too. Let me do no one special is reading

3681
04:20:27,020 --> 04:20:29,020
Brash is slumber

3682
04:20:34,540 --> 04:20:37,740
Me this this candle is still burning guys

3683
04:20:40,140 --> 04:20:44,140
It's still going the the it's it's um

3684
04:20:46,060 --> 04:20:48,780
Look the color is blue green the flame

3685
04:20:50,140 --> 04:20:53,900
Very interesting that usually means I was a spirit nearby

3686
04:20:57,020 --> 04:21:02,460
At least they recognized you as a person and not a domino. That's a good point actually I didn't think about that

3687
04:21:03,580 --> 04:21:05,740
Cards are the wrong way. I did think about that

3688
04:21:06,220 --> 04:21:08,220
Afterwards, I'm like, oh

3689
04:21:08,460 --> 04:21:10,460
They actually like saw me for me

3690
04:21:11,580 --> 04:21:14,860
Jesus frick. They saw me for me. Oh geez

3691
04:21:16,860 --> 04:21:18,860
Well

3692
04:21:19,900 --> 04:21:22,460
I can already tell you're a really disorganized

3693
04:21:22,860 --> 04:21:27,820
Uh, no one special because I cannot seem to get these cards in my hands properly

3694
04:21:28,540 --> 04:21:31,420
You feel like you have no hold on stuff

3695
04:21:32,700 --> 04:21:34,700
So that's what's currently going on with me

3696
04:21:37,100 --> 04:21:39,100
We don't stare we're we ogle

3697
04:21:39,420 --> 04:21:46,060
Okay, let's start eating the glass perhaps it just starts melting the glass down that'd be really cool

3698
04:21:46,780 --> 04:21:48,940
I stole those from somebody's wedding by the way

3699
04:21:50,860 --> 04:21:54,540
I went to a wedding and those were the things and I'm just like thank you. I will take

3700
04:21:55,820 --> 04:21:58,060
They a lot of candle holders and I was like yoink

3701
04:22:00,220 --> 04:22:05,660
I'm kidding. They're like the they were like the centerpieces guys. That was a bad shuffle. They were the centerpieces I didn't steal

3702
04:22:05,900 --> 04:22:07,900
I'm not a club too. I swear

3703
04:22:08,780 --> 04:22:10,780
I swear

3704
04:22:11,180 --> 04:22:13,180
Hell yeah

3705
04:22:13,980 --> 04:22:17,500

This is like you right now. You're full of a lot of doubt whether you made the right choice and did the right

3800
04:29:51,180 --> 04:29:56,620

3808
04:30:25,020 --> 04:30:31,340
Could I help you? Where are you going? Why are you climbing me?

3809
04:30:35,260 --> 04:30:38,620
You're actually warm and she's purring

3810
04:30:43,980 --> 04:30:45,980
Sorry, she had she's had to butting the mic

3811
04:30:46,380 --> 04:30:48,380

Yeah, it's okay. Don't worry. Don't worry for showing late. You're here now. That's all that matters

3813
04:30:56,620 --> 04:30:58,620
So I care about that you show up

3814
04:31:00,940 --> 04:31:02,940
About her leg whenever

3815
04:31:03,340 --> 04:31:05,900
She's I can't really move. I wish I could show you

3816
04:31:07,020 --> 04:31:10,300
But I would my face is in the way. Um

3817
04:31:11,100 --> 04:31:13,100
She you see her tail

3818
04:31:15,020 --> 04:31:18,540
I can't really see it. She's really standing on my hip

3819
04:31:20,700 --> 04:31:22,700
In her

3820
04:31:23,740 --> 04:31:29,500
Going at my chair purring and rubbing on it ma'am. Are you okay? Oh, she's going for the mic

3821
04:31:30,780 --> 04:31:33,660
She's going for the mic guys. Where are you going?

3822
04:31:33,660 --> 04:31:35,660
Hello

3823
04:31:40,860 --> 04:31:43,740
I need to clip your claws. Your back claws are sharp

3824
04:31:45,660 --> 04:31:49,260
Yeah, so it was a gut decision. Okay, that's what I thought. Um

3825
04:31:52,380 --> 04:31:54,620
I feel like I should have been more logical

3826
04:31:58,060 --> 04:32:00,060
Um

3827
04:32:01,020 --> 04:32:07,260
I feel like if somebody helped you come to that decision, they had their own hidden motive

3828
04:32:08,300 --> 04:32:11,100
Um, and they didn't really have your best interests at heart

3829
04:32:13,900 --> 04:32:17,260
Um, and yeah, they clouded your insight and kind of like

3830
04:32:18,540 --> 04:32:21,500
Didn't really help you out there. Uh

3831
04:32:22,620 --> 04:32:24,620
Seven of cups

3832
04:32:24,620 --> 04:32:27,500
So you see the cups there's a lot of choices, but some are bad

3833
04:32:28,460 --> 04:32:30,060
You have like

3834
04:32:30,060 --> 04:32:37,340
Kind of a dragon. You have the tower crystals gems reads snakes jewelry masks

3835
04:32:38,460 --> 04:32:40,460
Uh masks is like a false face

3836
04:32:40,620 --> 04:32:42,620
Uh alignment

3837
04:32:43,180 --> 04:32:48,060
Not being distracted by other things clarity illusion ends restored

3838
04:32:48,780 --> 04:32:52,380
I think again hindsight is 2020

3839
04:32:53,340 --> 04:32:58,940
You're gonna realize it probably wasn't the best decision. Um

3840
04:33:01,820 --> 04:33:04,940
In the kind of the idea the illusion

3841
04:33:05,660 --> 04:33:10,540
That it was correct is going to end will achieve that clarity

3842
04:33:11,580 --> 04:33:14,220
Will you realize the mistake?

3843
04:33:15,500 --> 04:33:17,500
Um

3844
04:33:18,460 --> 04:33:22,460
But that's okay. This is alignment. It wasn't for you

3845
04:33:23,100 --> 04:33:25,980
Yes, it might have not been the best thing

3846
04:33:26,780 --> 04:33:31,820
But it is in line alignment in a teaching moment for you

3847
04:33:33,020 --> 04:33:35,020
Queen Reino

3848
04:33:35,340 --> 04:33:37,100
Hi

3849
04:33:37,100 --> 04:33:39,100
Where are you going?

3850
04:33:40,780 --> 04:33:42,780

3852
04:33:53,580 --> 04:33:56,060
Why are you just staring at the candle?

3853
04:33:59,820 --> 04:34:04,380
Ooh, she poppin. That's why Reino's staring at the candle

3854
04:34:04,380 --> 04:34:12,700
She's looking at the camera all intense goddamn

3855
04:34:17,660 --> 04:34:22,540
Good fortune but falls you traveler. Now she's just here for screeches

3856
04:34:24,140 --> 04:34:26,140
Hey

3857
04:34:26,540 --> 04:34:28,540
You

3858
04:34:31,340 --> 04:34:38,220
Why are you staring at the candle? Usually Reino doesn't care about candles. She's very intently staring at it

3859
04:34:40,860 --> 04:34:43,500
No, you can't pull on my shoulder. No, you can't

3860
04:34:44,300 --> 04:34:50,060
Okay, all right. I have a cat on my shoulder. This is how I hold her

3861
04:34:50,060 --> 04:34:52,060
Um

3862
04:34:53,420 --> 04:34:55,420
Queen of wands

3863
04:34:55,500 --> 04:34:56,700
In

3864
04:34:56,700 --> 04:34:57,900
reverse

3865
04:34:57,900 --> 04:35:01,180
Yeah, she'd be looking fire. It's going really well

3866
04:35:03,020 --> 04:35:05,020
Demanding lack of self-worth

3867
04:35:05,740 --> 04:35:15,180
Queen of wonders demanding lack of self-worth drama deceit and finality vengeful anger jealous opposition low confidence selfish and temperamental

3868
04:35:20,060 --> 04:35:22,060
And

3869
04:35:24,940 --> 04:35:28,060
You have like this Cleopatra looking lady

3870
04:35:33,020 --> 04:35:36,380
Kind of sitting staring off to the distance she's a black cat on her lap

3871
04:35:38,300 --> 04:35:41,260
Sort of it's kind of almost like in opposition to the high priestess

3872
04:35:41,660 --> 04:35:46,140
Because you see like you have the moon and there's also the the moon on this one

3873
04:35:46,860 --> 04:35:53,580
It was definitely yeah an emotional gut decision, but it wasn't for your greatest good

3874
04:36:02,060 --> 04:36:06,460
Please don't let this make you spiral into a lack of self-worth

3875
04:36:06,620 --> 04:36:10,860
I feel like you really shit on yourself when you make a mistake

3876
04:36:12,060 --> 04:36:13,820
um

3877
04:36:13,900 --> 04:36:16,780
Yes, it might have not been the best decision

3878
04:36:19,420 --> 04:36:24,220
But it was a learning moment

3879
04:36:26,060 --> 04:36:30,620
Do not become angry don't let it consume you

3880
04:36:34,060 --> 04:36:39,900
Because it's not it's not worth it, you know, and it's it's not worth it

3881
04:36:44,540 --> 04:36:46,540
You

3882
04:36:50,540 --> 04:36:58,620
Like how wiki everything looks this car looks fucking rad though. I love like seraphim. You can see the eye

3883
04:37:00,380 --> 04:37:03,420
Oh, look at you got an eye right there. You got an eye right here

3884
04:37:08,940 --> 04:37:10,940
However

3885
04:37:14,540 --> 04:37:16,140
This

3886
04:37:16,140 --> 04:37:23,420
Was meant to happen again hindsight 2020 a learning opportunity you're gonna grow you're gonna understand stuff from those

3887
04:37:24,780 --> 04:37:29,340
Judgment final you're gonna you know, you're gonna gain better judgment

3888
04:37:30,620 --> 04:37:32,620
final decisions

3889
04:37:32,700 --> 04:37:34,700
absolutions wake up call

3890
04:37:36,060 --> 04:37:40,860
Intercalling life purpose self-evaluation awakening and reckoning

3891
04:37:41,100 --> 04:37:44,140
You're gonna look at yourself in the mirror and you're gonna be like, okay

3892
04:37:44,220 --> 04:37:47,260
Maybe this wasn't the best decision. Maybe I shouldn't have done this

3893
04:37:47,660 --> 04:37:53,900
Maybe this blah blah blah and this is going to expire a sort of self-discovery how you can do stuff to make up for it

3894
04:37:54,460 --> 04:37:55,900
you know

3895
04:37:55,900 --> 04:38:00,300
Sometimes you gotta hit rock bottom to get you know go to the top as they say

3896
04:38:01,100 --> 04:38:04,060
Um, it's gonna be a wake-up call. You're gonna be like

3897
04:38:04,780 --> 04:38:06,780
Yay, I should have done something differently

3898
04:38:07,500 --> 04:38:13,660
And that's okay. It was necessary. I'm gonna give you one more card because I feel like you need a positive in here

3899
04:38:14,780 --> 04:38:20,940
Typically, I I love them with the accurate angels. It's hard to shuffle with rena. I'm so sorry. Um, you're gonna

3900
04:38:22,460 --> 04:38:24,460
You might

3901
04:38:24,460 --> 04:38:26,940
Reena, it's okay. You might get a little bit of bitty

3902
04:38:28,940 --> 04:38:30,940
I'm so sorry

3903
04:38:31,180 --> 04:38:33,180
Because I have to lean forward

3904
04:38:34,380 --> 04:38:36,380
Oh

3905
04:38:39,260 --> 04:38:41,260
No tummy for free

3906
04:38:47,740 --> 04:38:51,580
Reena is so hard to shuffle with you on my shoulder

3907
04:38:54,380 --> 04:38:56,380
What

3908
04:38:56,620 --> 04:38:58,620
No, she's looking behind

3909
04:39:04,060 --> 04:39:12,220
So you have some positive okay rena you can't get all comfortable on my shoulder like you're gonna lay down

3910
04:39:13,180 --> 04:39:15,180
I don't have the strength

3911
04:39:25,500 --> 04:39:29,740
No tummy one no tummy allowed

3912
04:39:35,020 --> 04:39:38,940
She give it and she take it the way I think she farted because it smells now

3913
04:39:39,580 --> 04:39:41,580
Thanks a lot right now

3914
04:39:42,060 --> 04:39:46,860
If you was farting up a storm the other day, oh my god, I was dying next to her

3915
04:39:48,380 --> 04:39:50,380
I'm like dang girl you need a sheet

3916
04:39:51,900 --> 04:39:53,900
Okay

3917
04:40:04,380 --> 04:40:06,380
Can I get

3918
04:40:09,980 --> 04:40:11,980
Thank you. All right

3919
04:40:13,820 --> 04:40:17,260
There's one of two ways this can go brother

3920
04:40:19,740 --> 04:40:23,180
The hermit or the star all right

3921
04:40:24,540 --> 04:40:26,140
all right

3922
04:40:26,140 --> 04:40:28,140
be not afraid

3923
04:40:28,860 --> 04:40:36,140
The hermit in reverse you have a star upright harbor if you continue to linger on the mistake

3924
04:40:36,860 --> 04:40:38,060
and not

3925
04:40:38,060 --> 04:40:39,100
You know

3926
04:40:39,100 --> 04:40:42,140
Decide to work on better judgment and move forward

3927
04:40:43,500 --> 04:40:45,260
You will

3928
04:40:45,260 --> 04:40:46,780
self isolate

3929
04:40:46,780 --> 04:40:54,220
Don't experience loneliness because you're gonna be so worked up. You're going to self isolate withdrawal being stuck repeating past mistakes

3930
04:40:54,220 --> 04:41:00,380
You're going to be on the cycle where you keep doing the same things over and over again this karmic cycle

3931
04:41:01,580 --> 04:41:03,820
We're wrapped up in no don't do that

3932
04:41:04,460 --> 04:41:06,460
Loneliness antisocial rejection

3933
04:41:06,540 --> 04:41:09,820
Then you're gonna be scared to do anything else because you're afraid you're gonna fail again

3934
04:41:09,900 --> 04:41:12,620
We don't want that except the loss

3935
04:41:13,340 --> 04:41:15,340
and move on

3936
04:41:17,100 --> 04:41:20,380
If I can pick hello the star

3937
04:41:21,180 --> 04:41:23,980
Not the frenzied fling

3938
04:41:25,100 --> 04:41:28,380
This candle's getting short. I have another one though. I have another green man cable

3939
04:41:30,380 --> 04:41:34,460
Um hope renewal

3940
04:41:37,820 --> 04:41:40,140
Miracles rejuvenation faith

3941
04:41:41,180 --> 04:41:42,940
purpose

3942
04:41:42,940 --> 04:41:46,220
inspiration positively healing inner clarity

3943
04:41:46,860 --> 04:41:49,580
Again, like I said, you will grow from this

3944
04:41:50,940 --> 04:41:54,060
If you can if you just accept it

3945
04:41:55,740 --> 04:41:57,740
You'll have hope

3946
04:41:58,700 --> 04:42:03,660
You'll find a new purpose this thing might have not worked out that you put all your stuff into

3947
04:42:04,700 --> 04:42:06,700
But you'll have that clarity

3948
04:42:07,020 --> 04:42:10,860
You'll gain that judgment and you'll move forward and you'll be it'll be positive

3949
04:42:10,860 --> 04:42:14,780
The star is such a good positive card. It's such a beautiful card too

3950
04:42:15,340 --> 04:42:17,340
This woman looking up at the sky

3951
04:42:18,060 --> 04:42:20,220
Really it's a spirituality really in tune

3952
04:42:20,940 --> 04:42:28,140
With like you to uh start here to start there. I feel like she's really in tune with like the universe or like a god if you believe in god

3953
04:42:28,700 --> 04:42:31,660
um, but she's also outpouring her emotions, so maybe

3954
04:42:33,180 --> 04:42:35,980
Outpouring your emotions

3955
04:42:37,900 --> 04:42:43,180
I don't know if you believe in god or the universe or kind of just like I don't know just pray or something pray on it

3956
04:42:44,060 --> 04:42:46,060
What the people say pray on it

3957
04:42:47,980 --> 04:42:49,980
Or talk to someone about it

3958
04:42:49,980 --> 04:42:51,980
We don't believe in that. Um

3959
04:42:52,860 --> 04:42:54,860
Pro-pro-pro-principal point

3960
04:42:57,500 --> 04:42:59,500
Jennifer Kerlage

3961
04:43:00,300 --> 04:43:04,460
She struggled accepting herself into real practice or acting skills. It was my 30s things. So yeah, exactly

3962
04:43:04,460 --> 04:43:10,540
Like you don't have to put all your eggs in one basket as a matter of how old you are depending no matter what whatever you can still

3963
04:43:11,900 --> 04:43:13,900
Move forward and grow

3964
04:43:13,900 --> 04:43:15,420
you know

3965
04:43:15,500 --> 04:43:17,820
So like don't get caught up

3966
04:43:19,020 --> 04:43:24,380
And again take with a grain of salt. I could be completely fucking wrong. You could be a okay. Don't even worry about it, bro

3967
04:43:24,460 --> 04:43:27,260
I don't want you to stress. Don't even stress. Nobody's stress

3968
04:43:27,980 --> 04:43:29,980
All right

3969
04:43:34,140 --> 04:43:36,140
All right, you got it

3970
04:43:39,820 --> 04:43:43,660
Let's get a general card to close the night off

3971
04:43:45,500 --> 04:43:47,500
I'm kind of stressed

3972
04:43:47,500 --> 04:43:49,500
uh

3973
04:43:49,740 --> 04:43:54,460
But yeah, let me let me know how you feel about that reading. I apologize if it was a lot

3974
04:43:55,180 --> 04:43:57,500
I don't want you to have more anxiety again

3975
04:43:58,220 --> 04:44:00,380
You don't have to believe in the shit that i'm telling you

3976
04:44:02,300 --> 04:44:07,420
Oh, baby girl, my favorite card the magician

3977
04:44:11,980 --> 04:44:15,180
She stresses us when she drinks milkshakes. I had a milkshake to contain

3978
04:44:15,420 --> 04:44:17,420
Don't tell anybody I had a milkshake

3979
04:44:17,980 --> 04:44:19,980
um

3980
04:44:28,060 --> 04:44:31,660
Do I need one another card clarification

3981
04:44:33,820 --> 04:44:35,820
Nope, okay, that's it

3982
04:44:40,140 --> 04:44:42,540
No, I didn't take lactate. That's why I pooped so much today

3983
04:44:45,420 --> 04:44:50,700
The magician, however, it's in reverse. So this is something close out the night that we all have to be mindful about

3984
04:44:51,820 --> 04:44:54,860
manipulation unfulfilled potential scattered energy

3985
04:44:55,580 --> 04:45:02,060
Wasting resources illusions out of touch out of touch. I thought it was out of reach out of touch and deception

3986
04:45:02,780 --> 04:45:06,060
I feel like this pertains to me personally

3987
04:45:06,860 --> 04:45:08,220
um

3988
04:45:08,220 --> 04:45:12,380
Because my I feel like my energy has been very scattered. I'm going this way that I'm going that way

3989
04:45:13,020 --> 04:45:18,380
Um, I feel like I'm wasting my energy. I'm wasting resources because I'm not just like kind of like focusing in

3990
04:45:18,460 --> 04:45:23,660
I'm kind of like going all over the place and it's it's stressing me out. It's making me procrastinate. You know that like

3991
04:45:25,260 --> 04:45:27,260
I don't know what it means when you

3992
04:45:27,820 --> 04:45:29,580
Have stuff to do and you want to get it done

3993
04:45:29,580 --> 04:45:33,420
But you keep doing other stuff and procrastinating and put it off because you just don't want to do that one thing

3994
04:45:33,420 --> 04:45:35,580
Although it's not so hard because when you do it, you'll be fine

3995
04:45:36,860 --> 04:45:38,860
Like that's me

3996
04:45:39,180 --> 04:45:45,580
So that's what like that's for me. That's probably like that's me right there. Um, but for some of you guys, I don't know

3997
04:45:46,460 --> 04:45:51,900
You might be dealing with like someone lying to you manipulating you be careful about that. Um

3998
04:45:54,620 --> 04:46:00,140
Out of touch maybe like kind of be more in tune with other people it might be a little out of touch you might have

3999
04:46:00,780 --> 04:46:04,140
Pissed somebody off because you didn't understand something

4000
04:46:04,940 --> 04:46:11,100
It's nice getting to see you do some divination. I hope you do more in the future. Oh, thank you

4001
04:46:12,140 --> 04:46:17,340
Yeah, it will probably be a rare thing to be honest like, um

4002
04:46:18,540 --> 04:46:22,940
I like really get excited when Halloween's around the corner. So that's why I wanted to do like a summer mean

4003
04:46:23,660 --> 04:46:28,060
But um, I probably won't do this again until Halloween

4004
04:46:29,180 --> 04:46:31,180
Um

4005
04:46:31,260 --> 04:46:34,380
Just because it really isn't my

4006
04:46:39,100 --> 04:46:42,620
Me like it's Emmy's thing. So I don't want to like

4007
04:46:43,500 --> 04:46:44,860
um

4008
04:46:44,860 --> 04:46:48,060
Enroach upon her k-fabe more than I already am

4009
04:46:50,140 --> 04:46:53,900
Because like this has nothing to do with the Dominique drinks dummy mommy

4010
04:46:55,180 --> 04:46:56,540
You know

4011
04:46:56,540 --> 04:47:01,500
And I like to keep my content kind of in line with that. So

4012
04:47:02,700 --> 04:47:06,780
Yeah, I definitely want to do a stream with her because I would like to see how she reads

4013
04:47:07,500 --> 04:47:11,420
Um, I would like to read for her and I would like her to read me. I don't get read that often

4014
04:47:12,220 --> 04:47:15,660
Um, like Toma looks probably like one of the only people that reads for me. So

4015
04:47:19,100 --> 04:47:21,820
Yeah, it would be it would be a lot of fun. I would like it a lot

4016
04:47:21,820 --> 04:47:23,820
But

4017
04:47:24,060 --> 04:47:26,220
Feels tiring feels like I'm possessed

4018
04:47:28,940 --> 04:47:35,500
Hey, uh, I'm not great. I'm very tired. I'm like so like my body hurts

4019
04:47:36,700 --> 04:47:39,020
Oh, I'm in so much pain now

4020
04:47:40,780 --> 04:47:42,780
I took a lot

4021
04:47:44,220 --> 04:47:46,220
I love the magician

4022
04:47:46,620 --> 04:47:47,740
Oh

4023
04:47:47,740 --> 04:47:53,340
Yeah, but try to like focus up. I think end of the end of the day just focus up everybody

4024
04:47:54,140 --> 04:47:58,300
Um, don't waste your potential. Don't waste your energy. Just focus on one thing a task

4025
04:47:58,380 --> 04:48:03,420
Take a one step at a time. I think we all need to hear that sometimes. Just take a one step at a time

4026
04:48:06,620 --> 04:48:09,660
I'm out of that. Oh, I have some polo sample

4027
04:48:10,620 --> 04:48:12,620
Oh, little sample

4028
04:48:13,100 --> 04:48:16,540
Or did I don't know where

4029
04:48:20,380 --> 04:48:22,380
I don't know what happened to my

4030
04:48:22,780 --> 04:48:28,620
Lighter it just walked through legs and walked away. I don't know if I had it in my hand and I took it with me somewhere

4031
04:48:28,700 --> 04:48:30,700
Who knows?

4032
04:48:31,340 --> 04:48:36,140
Let's go get some rest. No, I am I'm gonna go get some rest. Let's see if I can like this

4033
04:48:38,060 --> 04:48:40,380
This looks it looks like I'm soldering something

4034
04:48:42,620 --> 04:48:44,620
I

4035
04:49:02,780 --> 04:49:08,780
Cleanse the area. Thank you spirits for coming and joining with us today and lending your insight

4036
04:49:09,500 --> 04:49:15,100
You may go off to whatever you came from now and have a good rest of your night

4037
04:49:17,020 --> 04:49:23,260
You never want to blow out a candle by the way that represents your spiritual team. It's kind of disrespectful

4038
04:49:25,020 --> 04:49:27,020
She just want to snuff it

4039
04:49:28,860 --> 04:49:34,140
Or sometimes and I didn't have like a candle snuffer. I would just look like my fingers give him a part of me

4040
04:49:34,700 --> 04:49:36,700
Just beep

4041
04:49:37,020 --> 04:49:39,020
That kind of like the burn

4042
04:49:41,100 --> 04:49:43,100
Whoo

4043
04:49:44,860 --> 04:49:47,420
Yeah, I hope you guys liked it. Um

4044
04:49:49,180 --> 04:49:55,820
Yeah, I'll probably do this again and listen to um around Halloween

4045
04:49:57,820 --> 04:49:59,820
And uh

4046
04:50:00,460 --> 04:50:02,700
Yeah, I don't really know what else to say

4047
04:50:04,860 --> 04:50:08,220
I'm really tired and I don't know what to say now

4048
04:50:10,700 --> 04:50:12,700
Kind of like brain dead

4049
04:50:16,060 --> 04:50:20,620
I thought how boomi stayed away during this type of stream. It's because I threatened him with a water bottle twice

4050
04:50:21,500 --> 04:50:24,860
Because when I was setting up he kept hopping up here. I was like, no

4051
04:50:25,820 --> 04:50:29,180
No, not gonna happen, bro. Here's your toy. Go away

4052
04:50:29,340 --> 04:50:31,340
Um

4053
04:50:31,900 --> 04:50:35,980
Boomi likes actually to be around when I do card readings

4054
04:50:37,580 --> 04:50:39,580
He's my little my little cat familiar

4055
04:50:40,860 --> 04:50:42,860
He took Soleil's place

4056
04:50:43,420 --> 04:50:45,420
Soleil used to be my kitty cat familiar

4057
04:50:46,220 --> 04:50:48,220
Before she passed away. All right

4058
04:50:50,380 --> 04:50:53,980
That's fine. Is there a streaming? Yes, it's her time

4059
04:50:55,500 --> 04:50:57,500
Uh, let me

4060
04:50:58,460 --> 04:51:00,460
Let me clear my throat

4061
04:51:07,500 --> 04:51:09,500
Let's pull the blicky

4062
04:51:14,860 --> 04:51:18,380
Yeah, we're gonna go rate a zero. I'll go wish her happy birthday

4063
04:51:19,660 --> 04:51:24,940
Um, I wanted to like this is why I wanted to end stream at nine because so I can just rate it in turn then

4064
04:51:24,940 --> 04:51:27,580
But you know here I am and it's 11

4065
04:51:30,140 --> 04:51:34,860
Wait, but yeah, you know, just be like that sometimes

4066
04:51:37,900 --> 04:51:39,900
It just be like that sometimes

4067
04:51:44,540 --> 04:51:49,580
Where is she there it is

4068
04:51:55,500 --> 04:51:59,660
Is she still streaming is she gonna be still streaming? She probably will she streams for a long time

4069
04:52:00,140 --> 04:52:03,180
She's like me and Strani which streams for like five hours for no reason

4070
04:52:03,900 --> 04:52:09,660
Um, but yeah, go shower her with love. Thank you so much for the donos. I'm going to be read for you
