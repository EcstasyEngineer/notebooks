1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
You poor thing, why didn't you tell me sooner?

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,200
I can tell when you're not well, you know that right?

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,200
I can see right through you.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,880
You can't hide anything from me, so let's keep it that way.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,600
You have sore ears again.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,640
I can tell because you're making a face when you're wincing in pain.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,520
Please, let me at least try to do something because I know you are far too stubborn to

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,560
see a doctor over this.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,640
If however what I do doesn't relieve some of the pain, you will see the doctor.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,240
You will not be arguing with me young man when I book you an appointment.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,080
Do I make myself clear?

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,760
Good boy.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,840
Now, let me see what tools I can find around my room to help.

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,800
Give me a moment to prepare my things.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,840
You however lie back on the bed.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,480
I'll put a towel under you.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,920
Why?

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,440
You're so silly because I'll be cleaning your ears.

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,480
Now shh, I'll be in a moment.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,880
We need this.

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Mm-hmm.

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,440
mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,640
there, let's hear you

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,640
poor thing

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,160
should I get you painkillers or

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,520
or are you really putting all your faith in this older woman, huh?

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,520
alright

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Let me start by using a sponge on your ears with hot water.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Don't worry, it's not too hot at all, I promise.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Pat, pat, pat, like that.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,520
It's good, right?

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,520
You can stop me at any time if it becomes sore, though.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm not actually gonna force myself on you.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Not if you don't want me to.

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Pat, pat, pat, like that.

40
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,520
The steam should actually help introduce moisture into your ear canal like this

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,520
and help loosen up any blockages you must have.

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Although, ears are self-cleaning, you'd be surprised.

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Obviously, they can mess themselves up.

44
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,520
That's why you need me, don't you?

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
My big man.

46
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Pat, pat, pat, like that.

47
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Pat, pat, pat, like that.

48
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Okay, now to pat your ears dry,

49
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,520
because no one wants wet, cold ears now, do they?

50
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,520
I think it sounds like being in a wind tunnel really.

51
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,520
You like it?

52
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Good, I'm glad.

53
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Maybe I could change your mind about getting more treatment than

54
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
instead of being so at first of all.

55
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,520
It really does seem to be a guy thing.

56
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Just suck it up.

57
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,520
You do realize we're in the 21st century and healthcare is accessible.

58
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Well, actually, I spoke too soon.

59
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Ignore me.

60
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Okay, now to use some cute tips,

61
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,520
because you have a nice buildup that isn't going anywhere other than

62
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,520
to run around.

63
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay, now to use some cute tips,

64
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,520
because you have a nice buildup that isn't going anywhere other than

65
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,520
to run around.

66
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Okay, so, how do you do that?

67
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Because you have a nice buildup that isn't going anywhere other than

68
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
intervention.

69
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,520
I'll spray them so they aren't too rough on your skin.

70
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,520
It's probably the blockages that are causing pain,

71
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,520
so do you feel any relief at all?

72
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Hmm, well, I'll keep going then.

73
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Okay.

74
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Are you falling asleep on me?

75
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Are you falling asleep on me?

76
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,520
If it's that relaxing, you do realize you can ask for other stuff in general.

77
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,520
There doesn't need to be a reason for me to pamper you.

78
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,520
I like doing nice things for you,

79
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,520
even if it's as small as something as cleaning your ears every two weeks.

80
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Again, guess what?

81
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,520
You already know I'm more than willing to do it for you.

82
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Okay.

83
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:09,520
I actually have some tweezers that I think will have a scraping effect,

84
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,520
because the Q-tips can't sleep against everything.

85
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Wow, and I mentioned scraping.

86
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Did you know the Romans had a mystallic spoon?

87
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,520
And that's how they cleaned their ears.

88
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Just scoop it out nice and simple and wash it in some hot water.

89
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Sorry if I'm information dumping.

90
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,520
I just find it really fascinating how reasonable the tool was,

91
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,520
and now we have disposable ones instead.

92
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Stay still, though, for me, alright?

93
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Okay.

94
00:11:43,520 --> 00:12:07,520
You're gonna be hearing callers by the time I'm done with you.

95
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Okay.

96
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Okay.

97
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Next, I'm going to exfoliate your ears with this cleanser,

98
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,520
and then use a harsher brush against them, okay?

99
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,520
That will truly get any oil buildup or gunk away,

100
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,520
and then you can fall into a lovely little nap, alright?

101
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Thank you for trying so hard, by the way.

102
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Don't give me that look.

103
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,520
I just want to show my appreciation for it.

104
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I know that everyone will see how hard you really tried you down.

105
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Just accept my admiration, alright?

106
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Okay.

107
00:14:39,520 --> 00:15:03,520
And we're almost done.

108
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Okay.

109
00:15:39,520 --> 00:16:06,520
You go to sleep, okay?

110
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,520
If you find this soothing enough, then I can be silly and tap on your ears

111
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,520
or come up until you've dropped off, alright?

112
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
You did really well.

113
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm glad I can make you feel better.

114
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Please don't be shy to ask me this,

115
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:32,520
or do I really need to pin you down just so I can give you some lovings?

116
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Huh?

117
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,520
No, stop being so adorable.

118
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:47,520
If you go to sleep, I'll wake you up shortly, alright?

119
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Okay.

120
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Okay.

121
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Okay.

122
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Okay.
