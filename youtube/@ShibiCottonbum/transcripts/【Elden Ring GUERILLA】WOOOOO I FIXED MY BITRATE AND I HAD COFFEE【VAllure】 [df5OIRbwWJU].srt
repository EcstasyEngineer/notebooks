Do you need help with this? So it was yeah, it was good fresh room. No, actually, I stay pretty quiet

00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,560
I talked a lot a lot the last meeting so I wanted to I

19
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,800
Didn't want to like overtake other people or something in case something came up

20
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Oh my god, that's loud

I'll leave you then enjoy your

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,640
Yeah, usually people will hang out after the meeting I I wish I could but I already said I was gonna do a gorilla

32
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,680
I hope I didn't scare them too bad

33
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,080
Hey you three I was Azura um in me and Mercy

34
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,280
No, it's not that what do you guys don't say that that's not what that's about at all

35
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,400
They invite me to the Jork I'm missing out on the Jork. That's fine. I can talk to them

36
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,640
Um, but we're gonna play a little bit the three biggest goobers accurate

37
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,840
accurate

38
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,880
I think I see one back to sleep or she's gonna. I don't know. I don't think she went back to sleep. She has a stream today

39
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,240
No, Jorking so I have the new controller so hopefully

40
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,760
Um

41
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,320
Everything works properly Rena has been in my lap this entire time during the meeting and she's fallen asleep and I can't she's very big

42
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,840
And I can't hold her up on my legs any longer ma'am. Can you wake up?

43
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Excuse me ma'am

44
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Excuse me ma'am

45
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Hello ma'am

46
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I know I don't want to drop I don't want to drop it

47
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I just

48
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,200
I don't want to accidentally drop Rena because she's like she's not like on my lap

49
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,880
She's so like I have my legs on top of my foot rest and I I'm like

50
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,520
And she my blankets over them. So she's like sitting in the blanket in between my legs like a little hammock

51
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,520
And it's funny because she looks like she's popping out of a little like a

52
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,680
Little rabbit hole because she's just sinking into the blanket where her head is above

53
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
And it's funny

54
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,480
She's company the company learning company secret not even it's literally just a rehash of what we did this month

55
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Yeah, you guys

56
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm quite tired. I

57
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,440
Was really anxious during the meeting, but I didn't like do anything

58
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,960
I was always anxious because I'm like, oh, can I do better? I hope I hope I pleased everybody

59
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,680
I hope everything's good, but it was a good meeting. Yeah

60
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,040
It was good. It was um, it was better than the last summer

61
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Not that we were productive

62
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,040
Hi, she be it's me fun time 40 and welcome to Elden Ring lightning strike

63
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,080
By a whale guitar if please

64
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,320
But I forget where we were to be honest with you

65
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,760
I know you beat the dancing lion and I don't know where we were going after that

66
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm still riding my high on beating the dancing lion. I was talking to my dad yesterday about him playing

67
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,400
Him playing um watch him a call it

68
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Elden ring instead of black myth mukong

69
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,920
Did I go? Oh, yeah, I'm outside of a Lana

70
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,480
That's three right. You're right because I was fighting that one dude that was there and I was just like running around a bunch

71
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Um, right now. I can't get over how funny you look right now. Oh my god. You look like a little

72
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
How are you is this comfortable for you

73
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,440
You're slowly falling deeper into the blanket

74
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,320
And making my legs hurt because I'm out of all an angle to keep you up and not fall on the ground

75
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Okay, I'm gonna pick you up. Oh

76
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
My god, she almost fell out of the blanket

77
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,780
Oh, I need to stretch my legs. Oh my god, she kept chewing on my headphones during the meeting

78
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Sinking into the comfy

79
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Okay, no, but now Rena's on my shoulder and I can't do anything. I can't play one-handed

80
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,960
Reena I'm sorry

81
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,000
She's probably gonna squeak an annoyance when I try to put her on the floor. She used me ma'am. Can you one on hook?

82
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,680
She's squeaked an annoyance. You couldn't hear it, but she was like

83
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Thank you. Bye-bye

84
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,560
She found a height. No, she's been running a boomie has been like terrorizing her this morning

85
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,360
So she kept running over to me. Um, oh

86
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,400
Oh, the mama doll the papa's all tweets are actually cute. Yeah, they were

87
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,480
My mom was so shy like you should have seen how red my mom's face got I'm like mom

88
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
Why are you blushing so hard? You're just saying hi

89
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,520
She's like I like I get put in the spot. Yeah, me and my mom have very similar voices

90
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,840
Sometimes when I talk to my dad on the phone, he's just like

91
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Dal is that you?

92
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,560
And I was like no, it's me she be and he's just like, oh, can you put your mother on the phone, please?

93
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,520
But yeah, you can kind of see like with my parents voices like my voice range

94
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Like my mom is like

95
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,360
She's like a little bit higher pitch than me

96
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,200
But she sounded really goofy and the the mess the voice tweets because she was really like shy

97
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,960
But normally she's like talks like a little bit higher

98
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,600
And not as goofy because she was like and doing oh

99
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
She's doing that kind of

100
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,560
But yeah, you met chef

101
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,680
My dad I was like, okay guys

102
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,720
I came up with the names for you for the stream and my dad's like oh I get to name myself

103
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,560
And I'm like no dad. He's like I want to be Peter and I'm like what he's like Peter rabbit. I'm like dad stop

104
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're very clever. You're very clever dad

105
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,920
You're not you're not gonna be pita pita rabbit

106
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,160
And my dad's just like so where's my bourbon and I'm like I haven't I don't know

107
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,920
Maybe I'll put that as like a donut thon birthday donut thon thing like I get my dad the bourbon bottle

108
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,520
But he my dad oh my god

109
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,440
I didn't tell you guys this yesterday, but my dad like almost made me cry in a good way because um I

110
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,400
Was talking about how I broke my controller and you guys got me a new one and he's like, you know what?

111
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,360
I'm gonna give you my scuff controller, and I'm like what he's like. Yeah, like I never used it

112
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
It's too big for my it's too small for my hands

113
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,960
He's like like the paddles keep like I keep accidentally touching the paddles

114
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,360
So he gave me his $300 scuff controller and I'm like

115
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Bro, and he's like, you know, I know you'll put it to better use than I ever will it's just gathering dust

116
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
And I'm just like

117
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
So I'll probably use that for some of the FPS games

118
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,880
For next week

119
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,520
But I really like the controller you guys got me. It's actually

120
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,120
Slightly different than I thought it was

121
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,320
That controller I got used from GameStop, and I'm wondering if it was a knockoff because this looks so much different from it

122
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,240
Like it's the same color, but it's red and not like the other one was kind of purple II I realized

123
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,920
But yeah, I was watching my dad like top frag

124
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,320
He got 37 kills and cod and everybody else was like 18 17

125
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,280
I was I was pretty proud. I was like, oh wow you've actually improved my mom's like

126
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,800
Yeah, he all he does is just play this all day

127
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,160
And I'm like, wow, he's like if you ever want to play if you ever want to play a hop in a lobby with you

128
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I'll hop in a lobby and I'm like, okay, dad

129
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,560
Game mode. I don't know. I can't remember. I wasn't paying attention. I was mostly talking to my mom

130
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,360
Excuse me and you're laughing at pictures of my grandfather because it looks like he was wearing a really bad toupee and

131
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,720
Why is the music get louder? Hello

132
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,960
Music's too loud. Do I look better by the way? I'm at a higher bit rate

133
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,120
However, I I do drop frames I

134
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,720
Don't know why I don't know if it like if I lag or anything. Do I look better bring that salvation true

135
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:18,520
See me to call it a she-fi stuff. I do look better. I seem crisper. Oh, thank goodness. Yeah manager

136
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,120
It was telling me my how my fucked up my settings were and he made a whole gif just to show

137
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,800
Like he met he's like, this is what your settings look like and this is what they should have looked like and I was like, oh my god

138
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,920
This was horrible now. I'm HD. Hold on. I want to look at my own stream

139
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,680
Let me on 70 20, let's put myself in 1080

140
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
I

141
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Need a refresh the screen

142
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,600
It's still not as crisp as I would like but I don't really know about that

143
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,440
It does look a lot better than before. That's for sure

144
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,360
That's that's a fact. Why is the top of my head glowing? I

145
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Don't understand. It doesn't matter, but I do look better. I look much better than before. That's that's that's the truth

146
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I

147
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Enhanced beauty

148
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Enhance, but yeah, that was the first time my dad had actually seen my model. I

149
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,740
Never showed him it in him it yet. I also showed my parents

150
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Strawny and Emmys

151
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,940
Shorts and my my parents were cracking up at Strawny's voice and like I was showing them clips from the the golf it collab of

152
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,940
Strawny trying to like

153
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,700
Distract me with the Scotland thing and my parents were dying and then I showed my mom

154
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,200
Emmys most recent short of like the voice thing and how and during the short when she's playing like

155
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
Poppy's playground. She's just like

156
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,660
Then my mom absolutely lost it. She just like it was so funny

157
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,420
Well, and I was it was really cool being able to show off like my gen mates to my parents

158
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,640
And they were also like just super impressed with Emmys voice acting and my my dad thought

159
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,860
Amy was me because like because he wasn't looking at my screen

160
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,860
I was showing the short to my mom

161
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,540
And he's like wow you guys sound alike. I'm like a little bit. This is the tiniest bit

162
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,540
I have my moments where me and Amy sound the same and I know like I think mercy and is there when we've all been in a

163
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Call together. I was like wait, who's talking?

164
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Because I I have a deeper voice

165
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,100
And I'm like, no, I can't I can't I can't do the same thing as Amy

166
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,900
But she my parents are super super impressed in me getting adopted perhaps

167
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,620
I don't know. I have to again when my parents come back from their vacation. They're going they're going to the beach for a week

168
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,860
I think I'll be like the last vacation that they go on for a while because my mom currently doesn't have a job

169
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,180
so they're like, you know trying to save and stuff and I

170
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,340
Want to do the like the guessing vTubers names things

171
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,400
And I'll start with my gen mates first and then I'll probably take like some submissions from you guys of people

172
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
That I want them to guess

173
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,900
But yeah

174
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,940
Are you getting more time than you? Yeah true. My parents are already darker than me. I

175
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,260
Was like look I'm tan now and they're like wow barely just like yourself and I'm like oh

176
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,460
I can't even win with my own parents

177
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
please

178
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
please

179
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,300
Yeah, yeah, oh my nose is itchy

180
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,540
Well, yeah, I'll play I'll play Elden Ring for a little bit

181
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,780
because I'm now I'm suddenly having FOMO of the girls being in the

182
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,580
The discord and I'm kind of now want to hang out with them too

183
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,820
Cuz we don't get to hang out that often we literally are like it's literally only for collabs or

184
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
Like if we have a group meeting

185
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,060
Because um, what's it called?

186
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,340
Cuz all about time zones and just like schedules and stuff it can be pretty difficult

187
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,340
So I try to make sure I get as much time with them as possible

188
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,780
But yeah

189
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,820
Oh

190
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,900
This is working fine. I'm very glad I was like you might get hope it's not my computer or my cable. That's not working

191
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:44,060
Veiler unity facts, of course the FOMO affects me too. I'm someone who always wants to be included

192
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,780
I don't have any friends my parents are like so what have you been up to and I'm like

193
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,380
Streaming and they're like, okay. What else I'm like

194
00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:00,140
Recording and my mom's just like, okay. What else I thought you said it was your day off today and I'm like I recorded

195
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,060
Jesus like

196
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,140
What happened to your friends? Where are Salem and olive and I'm like, they're busy

197
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,900
Olive is getting married and so she's really busy with that

198
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,540
And Salem's busy with her own family. So I'm just like sitting here with no friends

199
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,420
So I'm going to only hang out with my gen mates and you guys

200
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,980
I have nothing else to do

201
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,660
And my parents are gone and my parents have been more busy hanging out with their own friends than me

202
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,580
Apparently they went to a luau and they went on a boat with their friends

203
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,860
um

204
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,260
The other day and I'm like, yo, what the hell is happening and they're like, oh, we brought you food

205
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,820
and then they gave me like a bunch of pot stickers and I'm like, wow, this is delicious. Thank you and um

206
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,860
My mom handed me a mic's hard lemonade and she's like take this with you and I'm like, okay, thanks

207
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
So maybe I'll drink that mic's hard lemonade

208
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
I don't have a little tipsy elden ring stream

209
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,900

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,060
But yeah, my parents my parents are in high demands

211
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,420
They are in high demands. They're always they're always doing stuff

212
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,660
I think my mom today is going to see off some family friends because they're moving to australia and I'm like, oh my god

213
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,900
What if they're moving your straw knee? Oh my god, I'll be sick. Um

214
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,180
But uh, yeah, my parents are like

They stay busy. I'm like, you guys are too. Why are you?

Why are people your age? You're so old. They're not old. They're they're they're not old at all

217
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,660
Uh, stop like having activities like you're supposed to be on your butt doing nothing all day at your age

218
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,980
But you're going out and doing stuff like actual great members of society

219
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,180
Like you're supposed to have no life like me. I'm kind of mad

220
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Um

223
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,180

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,260
So I got to go too

230
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,460

I'm like, don't don't don't we don't really care. We don't

No, thanks

238
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,460
Not that I wouldn't take great care of this and I feel like I'm digging myself a hole. Let me just stop talking

239
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,660
You're like, wow, she be hates children. She'll kill the children like she kills her tamagotchi

240
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,180
No, my tamagotchi, by the way, I was like playing with it during the meeting

241
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,380
This tamagotchi sucks. It doesn't want to do anything. Every time I give it an activity to do

242
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,980
It doesn't like the activity. I spent

243
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,780
400 tamagotchi points to get it a coloring book and it was like f this coloring book and then threw it and I was like

244
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,700
Bro, I've actually been paying attention to you despite you

245
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,580
being ugly

246
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,140
Let me see what's its status. Uh, oh, it's actually pretty happy right now. Let me

247
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,140
I also bought it more stuff and it doesn't anything I like give to like keep it like

248
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,700
Attention like to have like fun. It doesn't care. I gave it a stuffed animal. It was like nah

249
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,340
It likes to play. I think it just likes only sports stuff. I'm not quite sure

250
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,380
Can I ask your parents if no?

251
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,020
That's terrible

252
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
That's why would you say that?

253
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,380
That's not nice. That's inappropriate

254
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
I feel I feel but you know what?

255
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
You're getting caught for that

256
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
Getting caught. I can't you're lucky. Oh

257
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
animals

258
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,820
Go go go go and time out. That's not nice. Don't don't do that

259
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,260
Anyways, here's the ways I hate my tamagotchi. Get shot. Don't salute them

260
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Um

261
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:29,980
It's over. She's picking us up on but I don't think I have the power to pick off like the 80 of you that are in here

262
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
or however many I don't look at the

263
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
viewer account because it makes me anxious

264
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,580
I just assume I'm always

265
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,900
I'm like, I just pretend I'm just streaming to 15 people and it makes me feel better

266
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,580
Although I know there's more than that and I appreciate all my lurkers that don't talk as much. Hello lurkers. You are loved

267
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Yes, you kisses

268
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
um

269
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,260
But y'all it's like why do I blink like I'm

270
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Like I'm a freaking bug

271
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,300
What's up with that? Why is my blinking tracking? No working properly?

272
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,740
I'm winking

273
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,020
Always lurking. Hey, I'm taken. That's fine

274
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:22,620
That's fine. We got shouted. I like all the lurkers get mentioned. They all come out of the woodwork and they're like, hi

275
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,140
I'm here. Yeah, that's me. I'm the lurker. She's talking about me. Oh me

276
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,900
Yes, you did I eat yet? Yeah, I ate. I'm fine. Don't worry

277
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,140
Madam as a lizard for yeah lizard lizard blink

278
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,460
Um

279
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,340
Oh semi-lurker. No, you're not you talk so often. What are you talking about?

280
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,460
Um

281
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,580
But yeah, it was really nice hanging out with my parents last night. I got some tomatoes

282
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,780
Some cherry tomatoes and then I got some green beans and then my mom gave me a spaghetti squash that she had grown earlier

283
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,220
And she used this like she hands it to me. She's like, don't worry about the brown stuff

284
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,780
bugs just walk all over it and I'm like

285
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,660
Why would you tell me that?

286
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,300
And my dad's like, yeah, they poop and I'm like, why I'm gonna wash it anyways

287
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,940
But why do you hand it to me and say the brown stuff is from bugs walking all over the vegetable? I don't

288
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
She's like, it's organic

289
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,060
And then she proceeds to tell me how she threw away the two heads of cabbage that she grew

290
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,980
Because she was so grossed out from the slug poop in the slugs that were in them because slugs lovely green

291
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,100
And then I laughed at her because when we went outside

292
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,900
Uh, she stepped on a slug and the slug just slimed all over her toe and it was funny

293
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,900
And then my dad proceeded to say that she eats slugs. My dad is terrified of slugs. They're her he's he's

294
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,900
such a baby

295
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,540
I asked my dad if he wants to like I was telling my parents

296
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,820
I'm like, I have nobody to see alien romulus with like all my friends are busy

297
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,260
Nobody wants to see it and my mom looks over to my dad and she's like, oh

298
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,940
Your dad will probably see it with you and I'm like, no dad's a pussy

299
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,340
I said this verbatim. I'm like, no dad's a pussy. He won't see it

300
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,940
He was screaming in at the Deadpool Wolverine movie because like came in as a trailer

301
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,340
Hi, Mari. Mari is nori everybody. Ma nori is now Mari

302
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,060

303
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,300
And so I was like making fun of him. I'm like, no, he'd probably start screaming like a girl

304
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:33,500
During the during the movie because you guys heard my dad's high-pitched voice that I was like, ha like that's you always have my dad says hello

Uh, yeah, no, I'm gonna call my dad out and then he started I was making fun of my dad

309
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,540
And I said I was like calling him out and stuff

310
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,060
And then he started then he started talking to me in krayle that he knows I can't understand

311
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,660
He's like, oh, oh, oh, and then he started like insulting me in krayle and be like just you wait

315
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,660
My mom's just laughing. I don't mean my mom doesn't know any krayle either. So we're both just sitting there like idiots

316
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
My dad's just like speaking krayle

317
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
cursing us cursing our existence

318
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,780
um

319
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,540
Yeah, that's that that's a Haitian guilt for you. My dad lays on that Haitian guilt hard

320
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,460
I don't text him for a day. He's like, oh

321
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,820
Oh, my daughter. Where have you been? I thought you had forsaken me and I'm like shut up

322
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,900
Who are you my grandfather? Stop stop this enough. Stop it

323
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
I forgot you're kind of black like

324
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,420
No, sorry, fuck

325
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,340
um

326
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,820
Should I call the grandfather and say his krayles wax facts

327
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,500
I know my dad I asked my dad, you know the one time I asked my dad to teach me krayle

328
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,980
He just handed me a krayle dictionary. It was like here you go

329
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
and I'm like

330
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,020
What?

331
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
What?

332
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Qua

333
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,220
Esquise that qua that's not gonna help me. That's a fucking dictionary bro

334
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
He gave you all the words let's see a shit

335
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,020
He's like you got this and I'm like I want you to speak it with me around that house

336
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Because like I knew a lot more when I was younger because my grandparents lived close to us

337
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,100
They were like 15 minutes away

338
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,380
So I had to go over my grandparents house and I'd be able to speak a little krayle

339
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,980
With my grandparents and my great-grandmother who's still alive at the time and then when they moved away to florida

340
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:49,420
I couldn't speak to anyone and then we weren't um my other Haitian cousins were like far away in the city. So we couldn't um

341
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
I couldn't talk to them that often

342
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,060
So, yeah

343
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,060
Am I free for now

344
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:02,540
For now also krayle is very interesting because it's all uh phonetically spelled. Uh, krayle didn't have a written language

345
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
I believe until like the 1980s

346
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,180
Very recently or something or like 1950s 60s or whatever. I can't recall

347
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,500
um

348
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,420
Because it was just it was just just a spoken language. It was never really written down and so

349
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,220
And that was an old dictionary too. So it's probably freaking inaccurate. I don't even I still have it. I don't know if I do

350
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Um

351
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,020
Casting sheep, that's not the same thing. I'm not caging

352
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
I'm not caging krayle

353
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,460
Oh, I'm about to make a name for myself here

354
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,620
I've lost the casters fan. Oh, that's too bad

355
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,900
That's too bad. I know I want to I need to learn a language guys. That's that's my goal

356
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,620
It was one of my goals in my debut was to learn another language

357
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,900
I think I think I might learn Spanish

358
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,940
I'll get I'll get Mari to teach me Spanish. No, she probably gets sick of me during

359
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,620
Pregame yeah

360
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,620
Pregame yeah

361
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Yeah, gotcha. Yeah

362
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:19,340
Yeah, my dad used to know french and um krayle, but now he only really knows um

363
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,060
Krayle in English

364
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
Because he didn't really speak

365
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,220
He didn't really speak a lot

366
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,420
Of french what rena? No, go away rena. You've been on my lap all morning

367
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060

00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,580
because it says I have a lot of drop frames actually no I leave it's like

not gonna affect her at all unless I just like hammer away at her but I'm not

428
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:37,980
good enough of a Eldering Player to do that to be honest with you because I

429
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,100
need like some hard hits because she means she moves really fast she moves

430
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:49,820
fast I would have to do probably some sort of distance on her immaculate fit

431
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:56,340
thank you fuck yeah um cuz yeah she's over there I might skip her for now and

Oh

564
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,820

How's the Elden Ringing it's it's ringing right quite quite well if you will ringing quite well

567
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Ringing quite well indeed

574
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,360
I'm so sorry if I screamed and terrified anybody who just had me all in the background

575
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
If you're working right now

576
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,540
Welcome to she be caught in bomb radio where you hear me

577
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,320
Shit talk some Elden Ring NPCs, although they're way better than I am even though they're AI

578
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,420
Oh

00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:14,700
Yes, my whole 30 K runes, when did I get 30 K runes? I don't really recall that to be honest with you. Yeah

580
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:25,460
All right, let's take a peek so we're here we kind of went around here. There's more

581
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,920
What the hell Jesus fuck. Oh, yeah, I already went over there because I beat that

582
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,240
Oh, there is a map

583
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,920
Can I get there without

584
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,120
Cuz then maybe if I

585
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:55,240
If I go up and then down and there I can get the map yes question mark

586
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,460
It's complicated

587
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Explain explain yourself

588
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:07,040
Because it looks like I could just go up and around and then down in here and then in there I

589
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,160
Finally get the piece of cat hair out of my nose. Let's make it be rub it

590
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,560
You can get to the map without any bosses right now explain

591
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:26,060
Because I'm I'm going to go over here and then go across

592
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,540
No, not that way, what do you mean

593
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,700
What do you mean

594
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,860
It's hidden me and my friends had a look it up

595
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,740

596
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,160
I

597
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,360
Don't know if I trust you

Am I going the right way? I am

602
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:13,180

603
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,500

Here's some cat ASMR for you. Yeah before I had to feed oh that was crazy

632
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,560
lightning I just saw out my window and it flashed through my entire house.

633
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:32,080
Did you hear the thunder? Holy shit. My god. That was free as stomach now. Cat and thunder

634
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:42,000
ASMR weird combination but it works. ASMR cat chewing thunder. But Afea used to only be a liquid

635
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,920
but now she's a lot more stronger that she can eat um kibble by herself and also drink water by

636
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:54,240
herself without me having to syringe it into her mouth. So I'm quite happy. Now she crunch.

637
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:02,560
So how uh how are you guys doing? Thunder thunder thunder cat.

638
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:11,600
She's so funny when she eats. I literally have her held like a baby in her food on her chest.

639
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,800
Not like it's again it's in a food bowl and she's just helping herself to it.

640
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,800
Are they still in the discord?

641
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:38,320
They are. And Azura's streaming. Oh whoa Azura what are you streaming there? Azura's been working on

642
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:46,320
some some some stuff and uh ooh bleeding hearts are in for a tree that's all I'll say.

643
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,600
Maybe you don't remind you of thunder cats why?

644
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,400
Use some game programming cool for the for for what kind of game?

645
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:08,960
I think our game is being finished up from what we were talking about in the meeting. It's

646
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,240
like a couple more things. Afea you've knocked out all the food and now it's on you. Hold on let me

647
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,360
just let me just I'm sorry to take your food away for a second but it's like all in the blanket.

648
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,800
Let me just do that. There we go. Let me tuck you in like a little little papoos my little papoos

649
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:36,800
and here you go now you can have it back.

650
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,800
Got back from doing some grocery shopping nice nice.

651
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,360
I don't know if you can also hear one of the cats eating in the background.

652
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,240
That was some crazy thunder. It's like one giant thunder cloud is above me right now.

653
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,280
Working cool. Feel their fan game oh nice cool.

654
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,280
Do what you can. I can't wait to play it when you when you finish.

655
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:46,320
Bye bye have a good one. You went to a car you should have taken a day off you always had time to

656
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,800
rest after those things.

657
01:08:51,680 --> 01:09:00,720
Oh we got more mods. Just got a notification for that.

658
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,120
Yeah it's really cool. I like that it's Castlevania-esque. I really think it fits us.

659
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:21,760
I could see like um mercy like throwing like the uh like the scissors as like some sort of like

660
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,560
like the metal cross that one of the characters throw. You watched the Halloween concert was

661
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,240
a fun yeah that's awesome. It looked great I've seen a couple of clips but I haven't I haven't watched

662
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,920
it myself. It must have been super fun conceptualizing that.

663
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,960
Lurkers I hope you're having a good day too. Don't don't think I forgot about you.

664
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:53,360
I care about you too and how your day's going. You don't have to say anything but I hope you had a good day.

665
01:09:53,680 --> 01:10:02,320
The girls served hard. What did they serve? Do they serve cunt?

666
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,080
Do they serve? They really served.

667
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,640
Face concert was cool. Yeah I heard the face concert was cool. It's cool that they were

668
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:20,080
able to have their own concert in New York like that.

669
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,080
She be mercy or probably a martial character is her enemy mystic. Embrace monster girl vibes

670
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,720
or icy and no idea what to do with strongy. Hmm yeah that's tough. You could probably do monster

671
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:38,320
girl with strongy too just so everything's balanced you know. It was very loud in person crowd got

672
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:47,360
it oh yeah but oh yeah Mint was part of that. I love how Mint is just like in everybody every

673
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:52,960
company. She's just like I'm hanging out with you Shoujo now hanging out with Faze now I'm hanging

674
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:59,040
out with these people now I'm hanging out I just I like that that's so fun. It's cool it's foster so

675
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:16,800
many connections like that. Come on Fia come on come on ma'am sometimes like she wants me to

676
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,120
rotate from eating from my hand and eating in the bowl so now I can tell I feel like she

677
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,760
wants to eat from my hand then sometimes she accidentally bites me she doesn't mean to but

678
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:34,240
it's funny here ma'am ma'am you did eat a lot this morning so do you want this are you done

679
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:41,760
can I kiss you I gave her kisses and then she started eating she was waiting for kisses

680
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:58,000
and she no that that won't happen I don't think she would ever want to join us that's very sweet

681
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:04,480
though I would like to that'd be cool to hang out with her at some point but that's very very

682
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:09,920
distant very distant although I know strongy's rated her a couple times and she's been very

683
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:20,240
thankful for it so I think that's sweet she's very cute enough to get away with munching on

684
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,080
she doesn't mean to she's aiming for the food and she can't really like aim that well do you

685
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:29,840
know cats can't really see that close in front of their face they have really bad eyesight they're

686
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:35,120
good with seeing far but not close and so sometimes she'll just miss like a snake like I want snakes

687
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,000
try to get something and it looks goofy good girl for you

688
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,520
I can hear smacking her lips against my my little palm on my hand let me get you some more

689
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:50,560
here you go

690
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,080
good girl

691
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,960
get munched on get munched on

692
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:14,800
cat's perception is a little sped up oh yeah yeah they have like an insane reaction time

693
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:22,560
doesn't stop me from playing with boomi I don't care if he's faster than me

694
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,840
I am the ultimate I'm the apex predator I'm the alpha male

695
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:38,000
it's funny boomi does a hop like he'll like aim to like rub against my leg but

696
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,560
it's a whole like hop to rub against my leg but he'll miss and so he just says he's hop

697
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,640
he just hops excitedly in the air now and he gets a little like bashful when I laugh at him

698
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,880
because but it's like super cute here you go ma'am

699
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,720
no you knocked that on the floor that's fine boomi will probably eat it

700
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,760
ooh big chomp he's a good big chomp

701
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,480
hi boomi boomi's on my desk boomi this is the same food there's more food in your bowl that you

702
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,520
did not finish yet

703
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,520
my cats stick their paws in the water before that to test the depth and I'm like can you

704
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,480
guys not do that like you're putting your gross paws in there and then the water is probably bad

705
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,480
oh it's raining it's raining hopefully my power doesn't go out like before

706
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,160
go on boomi go away let your sister eat jeez bro

707
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,160
I didn't know it was gonna rain today

708
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:07,680
it's funny I noticed boomi like I recently noticed boomi does something he'll dig his paw like he'll

709
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,120
like you know how a cat will like dig when it's um about to eat like using the litter box and

710
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:20,160
stuff or like dig at something um boomi when he's drinking water he'll dig the ground with

711
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:26,400
both his front paws almost like he's making biscuits but not like he'll just like move his paws around

712
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,480
while he's drinking and I noticed that reason I'm like since when do you do that why are you

713
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,160

715
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:41,600
water

716
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,360
it's as if you are like drinking from a cup of water

717
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,760
and then oh your cat does that too oh my gosh okay I'm like is something wrong with him um

719
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:06,640
and it's like if we were drinking like from a boat like a bowl of like cereal and then and we

720
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,760
put our hands in front of the cereal bowl then we started like digging in front of it but also

721
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:16,320

738
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:33,240
Go on, keep drinking.

739
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,240
Go on, bud.

740
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,240
Oi oi.

741
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,240
Keep drinking.

742
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,240
Are you done?

743
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,240
Don't sniff the mic.

744
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,240
Your face is all wet.

745
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,240
It's kind of funny.

746
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,240
Are you sniffing the mic so intently?

747
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,240
Ma'am, please finish drinking water.

748
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,240
Are you done drinking water?

749
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:52,240
I think she's done drinking water because now she's just more interested in the microphone

750
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:57,240
if you can hear her moving against it and sniffing.

751
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,240
Okay.

752
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,240
Now we put you down.

753
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,240
Not like that.

754
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:18,240
Fall down for a nap, then.

755
01:19:48,240 --> 01:20:10,240
What are you doing with me?

756
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:20,240
What are you doing with me?

757
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:41,240
That's a wild rain.

758
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:46,240
Perfect for walking all four of you.

759
01:20:46,240 --> 01:21:01,240
You might be able to hear it outside my window because my desk is right next to my window.

760
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,240
Can't you see?

761
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,240
No.

762
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:08,240
I didn't mean that.

763
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:13,240
Comfy rain.

764
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,240
Comfy rain noises.

765
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:24,240
Stretch my back.

766
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,240
Oh my God.

767
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:35,240
Can I put my headphones back on and get cosy?

768
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,240
Rain to soothe the soul indeed.

769
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,240
To soothe.

770
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,240
For soothe.

771
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:23,240
Rain sounds to reduce the...

772
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,240
That's funny.

773
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,240
What the heck?

774
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,240
Come on, Elvin Rain.

775
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:34,240
There we go.

776
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:42,240
Can you guys hear the rain sounds?

777
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,240
Cos I think I can hear them in my microphone.

778
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,240
Yeah?

779
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,240
Oh, cool.

780
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,240
Okay.

781
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,240
Cos I'm like, why does it sound like it's raining in game?

782
01:22:53,240 --> 01:23:01,240
Cos I have a monitor on.

783
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:17,240
I didn't think it was that loud, my God.

784
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:23,240
This also could be my AC.

785
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,240
Yeah, or it's the wind sounds and Elvin Rain, I don't know.

786
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,240
Okay.

787
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:39,240
Oh, there's my controller.

788
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:45,240
Might be the game.

789
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,240
Over there.

790
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:56,240
To...

791
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,240
It's flying to me.

792
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:12,240
Thank you for the remember.

793
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:16,240
I didn't think it was such a steep drop.

794
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:20,240
I should have never doubted y'all.

795
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,240
Apologies.

796
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:27,240
Can I go around this way and under?

797
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:38,240
Maybe.

798
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:43,240
Very, very steep drop that one is.

799
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,240
Oh, it's raining in game.

800
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,240
How fitting.

801
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,240
Let me just...

802
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:51,240
Oh, did I already get rid of that?

803
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:55,240
Around the side.

804
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,240
Let us comment.

805
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,240
Oh, my God.

806
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,240
Okay.

807
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,240
Not that close.

808
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,240
Excuse me.

809
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,240
Excuse me.

810
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,240
Dead bodies.

811
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,240
Thank you.

812
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,240
I'm stuck.

813
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,240
I'm stuck.

814
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,240
I'm stuck.

815
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,240
I'm stuck.

816
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,240
I'm stuck.

817
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,240
I'm stuck.

818
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,240
Torn, please.

819
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,240
Hallelujah.

820
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,240
Where am I?

821
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,240
Okay.

822
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,240
Keep going.

823
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,240
Okay.

824
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,240
Yeah.

825
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,240
That's where I came from.

826
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,240
Now I see what you guys meant.

827
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,240
Oh, my God.

828
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:27,240
What the hell?

829
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,240
Okay.

830
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,240
No, I'm too.

831
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,240
I need to, like, go more over here.

832
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:41,240
Please don't fall the fuck off self.

833
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,240
All right.

834
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,240
What was that?

835
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,240
Hold on.

836
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,240
Wait.

837
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,240
Oh, my God.

838
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,240
Torn it for the love of God.

839
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,240
Ow.

840
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,240
See, that's what happens to it.

841
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,240
That's what happens when you act up.

842
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,240
All right.

843
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,240
Is there anything over here?

844
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,240
Anything to fasten that in now?

845
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
It's just a wall.

846
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:07,240
Just a wall.

847
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,240
All right.

848
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,240
All right.

849
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,240
This is pretty nice.

850
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,240
Layers like an onion.

851
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,240
Understandable.

852
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,240
Very beautiful, dark forest.

853
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,240
It looks like there is a cave nearby.

854
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,240
All right.

855
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,240
Is there two?

856
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,240
What the heck?

857
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,240
Hold on here.

858
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,240
Oh, not these motherfuckers.

859
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,240
No.

860
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,240
Why is it so dark?

861
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,240
I cannot say shit.

862
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,240
What the hell?

863
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,240
Hold on.

864
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,240
I need to think.

865
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,240
Let me think.

866
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,240
Let me think.

867
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,240
Aw, I'm being aggroed and I can't look at the...

868
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,240
Oh, my God.

869
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:52,240
I wanted to look at the map.

870
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:57,240
This isn't even the darkest, for I'm running into the wall.

871
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,240
Oh, what the hell is that?

872
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,240
Hold on.

873
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,240
Hold on.

874
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,240
Let me just think for a sec.

875
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,240
All right.

876
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,240
Hug the wall.

877
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,240
Hug the wall.

878
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,240
All right.

879
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:17,240
All roads lead to here.

880
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,240
Please.

881
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,240
Sorry, bear.

882
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,240
I am in the middle of something.

883
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,240
How, bitch?

884
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:30,240
Oh, you're so fucking stupid.

885
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:36,240
Thank you.

886
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:41,240
Was there another way around?

887
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:45,240
They have to go this way.

888
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,240
Is it much darker in creepy or forest?

889
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:53,240
Yeah, I also had a lot less HP than I thought as well.

890
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:59,240
Let's do a little exploring then.

891
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:06,240
Two's over here.

892
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:32,240
I think it's just a dungeon.

893
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:41,240
Well, do all roads just simply lead to the dungeon?

894
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I can't go around that.

895
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,240
Let's see.

896
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:51,240
I think that's the case.

897
01:28:51,240 --> 01:29:06,240
Do I come out on the other side from the dungeon?

898
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:10,240
Probably, right?

899
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,240
I just go deeper into the earth?

900
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,240
No?

901
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,240
Should we go?

902
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,240
Is this worth it?

903
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,240
Should we go down this dungeon, boys?

904
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,240
Is this worth it?

905
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,240
I'm being aggroed.

906
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,240
What the fuck?

907
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,240
How did those not get me?

908
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:31,240
Well, grift cats, it comes.

909
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,240
Yeah, do it.

910
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,240
All dungeons are right.

911
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,240
All right, we'll do it.

912
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,240
Let's get rid of these.

913
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,240
Fuck you.

914
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,240
I'll come back to you later.

915
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,240
All right, let's...

916
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,240
A weapon?

917
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,240
Oh, great.

918
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,240
Something I can't use.

919
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,240
I love that for me.

920
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,240
I bet I could have jumped on top there.

921
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,240
I bet there's something over there.

922
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:08,240
It doesn't matter.

923
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:11,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

924
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:15,240
What the fuck are you?

925
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,240
Hello?

926
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,240
What?

927
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,240
Oh, my God.

928
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:27,240
The gremlins here look real creepy.

929
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:32,240
I don't like that it jumps at me.

930
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:40,240
There's one over there.

931
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:48,240
Come on, then.

932
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:54,240
Is this why you guys wanted me to go here?

933
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,240
Is this why?

934
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:01,240
Is this why you said, oh, I want you to go?

935
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:05,240
Is this timed?

936
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:15,240
Ow.

937
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:19,240
Ow, please don't kill me.

938
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,240
I'll kill you, though.

939
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,240
Oh, nice.

940
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,240
I don't think I really need that right now.

941
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:29,240
What the fuck?

942
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,240
What the fuck?

943
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,240
Why isn't there another one?

944
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:38,240
Can I jump on this?

945
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,240
I'm not going to try it.

946
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:51,240
Oh, I didn't drink that, but that actually still helped.

947
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,240
No.

948
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:59,240
Ghost flame, motherfucker.

949
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:05,240
What?

950
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,240
Interesting.

951
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:11,240
That's an interesting spell, because it does one big one,

952
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:15,240
and then, huh, fascinating in it.

953
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:19,240
Oh, I saw you coming from a mile away, bro.

954
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,240
A mile away.

955
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:24,240
What was that?

956
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,240
Why is there a fogger bloom in here?

957
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,240
I think I go up back and around at some point.

958
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,240
La la la.

959
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:36,240
I thought that was something on the ceiling.

960
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,240
La la la.

961
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:42,240
Ow.

962
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,240
Ow.

963
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,240
Ow.

964
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,240
Oh, fuck, I didn't think it would hit me again.

965
01:32:52,240 --> 01:33:00,240
Well.

966
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,240
Oh, you're closer.

967
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,240
I'm looking at chat.

968
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:08,240
I'm not paying attention to you at all.

969
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,240
That didn't work.

970
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:12,240
Can you come a little bit closer?

971
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,240
Oh, fuck it, bro.

972
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,240
I'm so fucking stupid.

973
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:21,240
I'm going to die this guy spamming fireball.

974
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:35,240
Are you serious?

975
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,240
I'm going to literally cry.

976
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,240
I'm just going to literally just go attack him.

977
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:46,240
Do it.

978
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,240
Shut up.

979
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:55,240
That took away too many flasks, and I literally needed to.

980
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,240
All right.

981
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,240
Who's in here?

982
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:02,240
Who's going to jump out?

983
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,240
Fucking whore.

984
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,240
No.

985
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,240
Who else?

986
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,240
Is anybody else in here?

987
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:14,240
Oh, yeah, there you are.

988
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:18,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

989
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,240
Well, that's nifty.

990
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:25,240
Some dragon shit.

991
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,240
I'm getting bonked by a burdo.

992
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,240
That's so true, though.

993
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:34,240
It literally looks like stone burdo.

994
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,240
Wait, is this where I came from?

995
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,240
It's a lot of vulgar blooms.

996
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,240
Yeah, that is where I came from.

997
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,240
Up, up, up, up, up.

998
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,240
Who else?

999
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:49,240
Okay.

1000
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:53,240
Oh, fuck me.

1001
01:34:53,240 --> 01:35:00,240
This is a fun game.

1002
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:06,240
This is a fun game, then.

1003
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:12,240
Not resin.

1004
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,240
Now where do I go?

1005
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,240
Oh, over there.

1006
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,240
Wee!

1007
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,240
Oh.

1008
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:24,240
Bitch.

1009
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,240
It's me.

1010
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,240
Hi.

1011
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,240
I'm the problem.

1012
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,240
It's me.

1013
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,240
Oh, that didn't work.

1014
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:36,240
Awkward.

1015
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:43,240
That barely did anything to you.

1016
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,240
Oh, what the?

1017
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,240
I want this spell.

1018
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,240
Whatever it is, I want it.

1019
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,240
You're a weird-looking motherfucker, though.

1020
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,240
You got a long head.

1021
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:54,240
Long neck motherfucker right there.

1022
01:35:54,240 --> 01:36:00,240
I'm going to die.

1023
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:07,240
I knew you were interested in that.

1024
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:11,240
You got to check your fucking corners, like it's siege or something.

1025
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,240
Or up top.

1026
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,240
I'm waiting for someone to jump on me.

1027
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:22,240
You know, the dude was up here, but still.

1028
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,240
Who else?

1029
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,240
Who else is here?

1030
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,240
Who else?

1031
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,240
Okay, you.

1032
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,240
Some full-guard bloom.

1033
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:35,240
I'll take it.

1034
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,240
Oh, there's two of yous.

1035
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:42,240
Come on, then.

1036
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,240
Probably shouldn't use such a powerful...

1037
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:46,240
It's fine.

1038
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,240
Oh, I can't.

1039
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:51,240
I don't really have anything.

1040
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:55,240
What?

1041
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,240
Why?

1042
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,240
What the fuck was that?

1043
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,240
I couldn't lock on.

1044
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,240
That was so weird.

1045
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,240
It's fine.

1046
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,240
I'll be back for it.

1047
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:11,240
I'm just going to run.

1048
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,240
Oh, yeah, those lads.

1049
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,240
Those lads, then.

1050
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:26,240
All right, let's zoom.

1051
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:36,240
Now.

1052
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,240
What the fuck?

1053
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:51,240
All right, then.

1054
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:55,240
Yoink.

1055
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,240
Oh, fuck.

1056
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:02,240
I went the wrong way.

1057
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:08,240
I'm going to lose all my fucking yet.

1058
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:13,240
Fuck, bro.

1059
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,240
I couldn't.

1060
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,240
I rolled out of the way.

1061
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:19,240
It was not working out for me.

1062
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:22,240
Oh, fuck me, bro.

1063
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,240
This is only 50k.

1064
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:26,240
It's not really a big deal.

1065
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,240
If it was like 100, I'd be pissed.

1066
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,240
Where am I?

1067
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,240
Ow!

1068
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:35,240
What the fuck?

1069
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:42,240
Fuck off!

1070
01:38:42,240 --> 01:39:11,240
I'm just spamming R1.

1071
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:16,240
You know, this is itchy.

1072
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:19,240
Okay, which way was I going?

1073
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,240
That's such a cool spell.

1074
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:27,240
Okay, now I'm near them.

1075
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:37,240
Whoa, I almost missed it.

1076
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,240
Ow.

1077
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:49,240
Did not mean to use my actual war on you.

1078
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,240
I missed that.

1079
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:53,240
That's fucking stupid.

1080
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:56,240
Oh, my God, that spell is so powerful.

1081
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,240
It's still going.

1082
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:02,240
What the fuck?

1083
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,240
I'm going to stream more?

1084
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,240
Yeah, I'm going to stream more.

1085
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,240
Yeah, the fat armor is helping.

1086
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,240
I like how she sends forth a reflin.

1087
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,240
Oh, I see him.

1088
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,240
Oh, that motherfucker.

1089
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:22,240
Okay, I'm glad that I kind of died because then I would have died anyways to him.

1090
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:34,240
Can I bait one of you guys?

1091
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:45,240
Come on, then.

1092
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,240
I missed?

1093
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,240
Why do I keep missing for you?

1094
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,240
Don't kill me again.

1095
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:54,240
Don't do it.

1096
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,240
He is an insane poise.

1097
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,240
Why is he so...

1098
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:01,240
Why does it do with the axe so powerful?

1099
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:08,240
Oh, my God.

1100
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:14,240
Madam, shut up.

1101
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,240
Oh, it's the battle.

1102
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,240
That's right.

1103
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:25,240
He buffed himself.

1104
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:33,240
Fuck, I ran too fast.

1105
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,240
I'm getting crushed like a pancake.

1106
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,240
Oh, no.

1107
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,240
Please stop.

1108
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,240
Please, I'm too young.

1109
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:46,240
I'm too young for this.

1110
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,240
I'm too precious.

1111
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:53,240
I'm too wholesome.

1112
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:58,240
I can't stand these things.

1113
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:01,240
I don't know how going this way, because I don't go up.

1114
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:11,240
Is this still falling?

1115
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:22,240
Oh, my God.

1116
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,240
Is this shit behind me?

1117
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,240
Oh, no.

1118
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:25,240
Oh, no.

1119
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:26,240
Come on.

1120
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:32,240
I'll hurry before it comes.

1121
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:42,240
Let's take a moment.

1122
01:42:42,240 --> 01:43:01,240
Oh, that's why dungeons just hand me my ass, to be honest.

1123
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:21,240
Oh, my God, my runes.

1124
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,240
How crazy.

1125
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:24,240
That's so wild.

1126
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,240
You know, I'm going to do you first.

1127
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:33,240
Come on, girly pop.

1128
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,240
No, I'm not the both of you.

1129
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,240
I don't want the both of you.

1130
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:41,240
Oh, bitch.

1131
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,240
Oh, I didn't think you were.

1132
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,240
I thought you were staggered.

1133
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,240
I thought I could have repossed you.

1134
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:50,240
Hey, let's let's do.

1135
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:54,240
I thought it matters.

1136
01:43:54,240 --> 01:44:00,240
I have the wrong physics on.

1137
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,240
There's two of you.

1138
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,240
What are you standing on?

1139
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:08,240
I'm going to run and grab that.

1140
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:12,240
I know he was standing in the fucking corner.

1141
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,240
I'm just going to run in and grab that.

1142
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,240
I don't even give a shit.

1143
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:16,240
I know.

1144
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:21,240
I know it's like a faith weapon, but whatever.

1145
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,240
All right.

1146
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,240
Let's go.

1147
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:24,240
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.

1148
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,240
Oh.

1149
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:26,240
Oh.

1150
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:27,240
Oh.

1151
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:28,240
Oh.

1152
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,240
Oh.

1153
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,240
Oh.

1154
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,240
Oh.

1155
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,240
Oh.

1156
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,240
Oh.

1157
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:34,240
Oh.

1158
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:35,240
Oh.

1159
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,240
Oh.

1160
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:37,240
Why is it?

1161
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,240
What is even bouncing on?

1162
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:44,240
How does it bounce on that?

1163
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:50,240

1165
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,240
When he ride a dick, he's going to spell his name.

1166
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:00,240
Fog, grift, catacombs.

1167
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:06,240

1168
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,240

1185

The world map nearly three D so we've loops and twists and elevation

1663
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:21,940
No, I don't think that I prefer like an actual and it's more true to the world, you know, they don't think you know

1664
02:30:22,860 --> 02:30:24,860
You know

1665
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:31,300
Fuck

1666
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:37,860
And

1667
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:41,260
I'm the map how the hell did I get over here?

1668
02:30:43,860 --> 02:30:47,980
I'm assuming I can get over there and oh, yeah, baby, let's go

1669
02:30:49,820 --> 02:30:51,660
Yeah

1670
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:53,660
At least the mind they just do it

1671
02:30:54,460 --> 02:31:01,380
They should just don't talk top of graphical more top of cap top of graph a little more top of graphical map

1672
02:31:02,060 --> 02:31:04,060
Sorry, I had a seizure. Oh

1673
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:06,500
I missed you so much

1674
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:12,220
Ha ha motherfucker, what the hell?

1675
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:20,460
Serpentine serpentine serpentine serpentine serpentine serpentine serpentine you can't shoot serpentine

1676
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:22,820
Hey

1677
02:31:27,140 --> 02:31:29,140
You missed

1678
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:33,020
I'm pumping in his shot by a fucking arrow on the back serpentine

1679
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:39,980
Wait, what are you doing? Are you a dude? Oh, you're a dude. Oh, you're dude that can hit me

1680
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:49,020
Yeah

1681
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:56,120
Please don't shoot me again, that's not very nice. I heard it. He missed I was a ring

1682
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:59,980
La she blows

1683
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:08,220
Yeah, raw ruins, how can that hit me? That's like pretty close damn

1684
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:13,540
I feel like there should be a site of grace over here, don't you think?

1685
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:19,220
I'm aggroed and I can't look at the map right now. Oh mushroom

1686
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:26,900
I wish I would just try to double jump like I'm fucking torrent. Can I

1687
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:33,420
My fucking huge armor, I can't do anything with it

1688
02:32:36,060 --> 02:32:40,460
I gotta break some rocks. I gotta do some shit

1689
02:32:41,380 --> 02:32:46,860
Yeah, yeah, where do I where the fucking rocks?

1690
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:53,940
One it's stupid that this is a thing in the first place by the way, I think this is a stupid game mechanic

1691
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,700
That is honestly pointless in my opinion

1692
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:00,420
Like it's genuinely pointless

1693
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:04,900
Like why do I need to go an extra mile of hitting a fucking rock?

1694
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:06,980
What

1695
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:14,460
Oh

1696
02:33:15,580 --> 02:33:21,780
It skips the rock part if I put the shackle that doesn't make any sense either that must have to be a game bug then

1697
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:23,780
I don't see the

1698
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:26,780
We I

1699
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:30,740
Don't see the the like point

1700
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:37,380
Where am I I'm still being aggroed who the fuck is aggroing me. I'm literally just flew away from you

1701
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:43,420
I don't know where I'm going. I just wanted to go over here. Oh

1702
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:48,940
I see I see so the blind man peeing in the wind. I'm still aggro

1703
02:33:54,380 --> 02:34:00,100
Can I please look at the map, okay, thank you. Thank you kindly. All right, that's a lot

1704
02:34:00,860 --> 02:34:02,860
Shit

1705
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:05,380
Fuck

1706
02:34:09,300 --> 02:34:11,300
I don't even know where to go for that

1707
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:14,740
There's a lot of things over here

1708
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:19,660
This is a lot this is not limb grave size

1709
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:24,540
This is like a little bit bigger than limb grave

1710
02:34:30,860 --> 02:34:32,860
Huh

1711
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:36,580
All right, I'm gonna go back down if I can turn around properly

1712
02:34:37,660 --> 02:34:39,660
Where is it? Where's the hole?

1713
02:34:51,620 --> 02:34:57,260
We be funny if I died like I slightly just missed it

1714
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:07,060
Easy there koofie

1715
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:17,260
You can't reach the green area. Well, yeah, cuz you're in the bottom

1716
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:24,780
That makes sense. I'm trying to think of what I can do over here. Maybe like go over to this place perhaps

1717
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:32,540
Hey guys, what's going on tuppletown ruins? Oh?

1718
02:35:33,900 --> 02:35:36,400

Is there like a tibia mariner around here like

1720
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:45,700
What's what's going on? What's the deal with this place a roue?

1721
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:50,500
Why don't I feel like I've been here already because it looks like another spot in the map. That's why

1722
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:54,500
Come on torrent, I believe in you

1723
02:35:55,220 --> 02:35:59,580

Wow, that was worth it. That was so worth it. Um, I'm on top of this now

1728
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:25,580
I'm being aggroed. Oh, hi. I was wondering who was that? Who goes that?

1729
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:29,520
All right, it's really nothing of interest that I can see

1730
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:33,620
Looking for a chest. Let me take this mushroom while I'm at it. Oh

1737
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:00,740

No fly goes near your skin

1747
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:14,580
I'm not feeling this area. This area isn't speaking to me. I just passed it now

02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:17,220

Poverty don't damage why is there a giant carpet on the you know, that's just that's a tripping hazard

1779
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:30,500
They should really get rid of that and that's all I'm gonna say

1780
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:34,820
That's quite the tripping hazard ma'am. I'm not done killing you yet ma'am

1781
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:41,140
Excuse me, sorry, I killed your dog. You guys have a lot of dogs. They're just not nice

1782
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:43,140
You should really put them down. I think they have rabies

You and me baby ain't nothing but tarnished. So let's do it like they do on the

1821
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:11,000
I can't think of any one thing that rhymes with tarnished

1822
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:21,400
You and me baby ain't nothing but tarnished so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel

1823
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:24,600
Getting tarnished now

1824
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:44,200
Oh my god, he's fucking running I missed. Oh, but he missed. Oh

1825
02:44:45,480 --> 02:44:50,400
Oh, oh queen. No, do not step on me father. Can I?

1826
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:53,040
Oh

1827
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:55,320
Hold on. Let me just

1828
02:44:55,520 --> 02:45:00,520
Can we go back over here, please and then I'll fight you cuz like oh damn. Oh

1829
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:07,560
My god, what the hell?

1830
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:10,800
Ah, oh

1831
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:17,760
I'm trying to get to the chest, but he's aggroing me so hard

1832
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:23,160
I'll have to bring him like he walks go fat. He's he walks so fast

1833
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:29,280
He walks really fast

1834
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:33,680
So it's hard to just get to the chest and leave

1835
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:41,920
Bro thinks he's the Dark Souls 3 tutorial boss honestly. Yeah, um, yeah, he's up there. I

1836
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:44,680
Wish I could climb up there

1837
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:46,760
Where am I?

1838
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:49,600
Fuck

1839
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:58,520
Love that kind you clean up with a mop and bucket like the last kind of combs of Egypt only God knows where they stuff

02:45:58,520 --> 02:46:05,720
They're hieroglyphics only Pacific. I want to be down in your South Seas Bay got the notion of the motion your ocean means small craft advisory

1841
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:08,980

1843
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:19,080

02:46:19,400 --> 02:46:24,960
She'll call me yours. I'm calling you mine till time. You love me. Just like I'll then we'll do it doggy

1845
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:28,400

I don't know why I know that's one tire song don't ask me why

1848
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:39,360
Just just just don't ask

1849
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:43,840
All right, maybe if I where am I going? Oh

1850
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:46,320
Oh

1851
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:55,480
Maybe I can beat him to fall off living in the sunlight laughing in the moonlight having a wonderful time

1852
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:58,640
Hey cutie

1853
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:03,600
You can do it put your back and sue it on I can do it put you on to it

1854
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:11,060
You can do it put your back and sue it I can do it put your into it put your back into it put you into it

1855
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:13,680

1856
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:15,960
Fuck me brother

1857
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:23,160
You get all the way over here, I want you all the way over here

1858
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,800
All right

1859
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:39,220
Can't come over here this fast

1860
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:46,080
Two-handed sword. Did I really need that?

1861
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:55,000
Maybe. Where is he? Did he forget about me? Is there anything down here?

1862
02:47:57,160 --> 02:48:03,600
All right, this is pointless. Let's go! Well, it wasn't pointless. Um, is that a side of grace over there?

1863
02:48:04,600 --> 02:48:06,600
Killer?

1864
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:13,120
Yippee!

1865
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:27,240
I'm just trying, from that side. If only you two-handed sword, shut up, and shut up.

1866
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:30,520
I didn't mean to say no.

1867
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:34,080
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

1868
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:40,360
Look at that. I am pure sex. I am oozing.

1869
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:46,320
Demur. Just kidding. That's not how that word is. Um, okay, so we did that

1870
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:50,440
sort of, not really. We could go up here.

1871
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:58,240
No, it would literally just reach around, and that would be at a dead end. There's probably a cave over here.

1872
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:01,320
It seems like there's some sort of...

1873
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:04,720
Whatever the hell this is, I'm...

1874
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:06,720
I'm...

1875
02:49:09,240 --> 02:49:11,240
All right.

1876
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,600
Aw.

1877
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:22,760
I say, how do I get to the green place? Oh, I probably have to clear...

1878
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:31,520
I probably have to clear this castle, which looks quite legit.

1879
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:41,240
This looks nice and small. Looks like there might be little flowers in there. Oh wait, I think that's the...

1880
02:49:41,720 --> 02:49:44,760
Where you fight the scorpion lady. No, I don't want to do that yet.

1881
02:49:49,880 --> 02:49:53,880
We could possibly...

1882
02:49:57,760 --> 02:50:01,560
What a pretty map. Look at the tree just dripping.

1883
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:07,560
No, she's elsewhere. Scorpion lady's green. Oh, then what's... Oh, I thought this was like the...

1884
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:15,120
The thing. Uh, I might just go over there then. Just a little bit more sporing. Let's do it.

1885
02:50:19,240 --> 02:50:27,240
Ooh. Okay, my name is running down the hallway. You will hear them momentarily.

1886
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:45,680
I don't know how to get down there. Get down where? Oh, fuck, you're right. I have to get down.

1887
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:50,960
Bro, this DLC is the most annoying to navigate.

1888
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:54,840
Oh my fucking god.

1889
02:50:55,840 --> 02:51:03,840
Oh my god. Please. Why does this tree look like it's going to smack me and call me something inappropriate?

1890
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:15,840
Hey again. What's up? Can I just hang out with you? Sick.

1891
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:24,840
Did you just have like two... Looks like you have air pods in, but it's just... Why do you look like that?

1892
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:31,840
I like... It's so funny because like you'd first look at them, you're just like, oh...

1893
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:38,840
Why are you guys here? Wait, will it aggro him? Will they aggro him? I want to see if they'll aggro him.

1894
02:51:38,840 --> 02:51:53,840
Save me. Why are you still on my ass? Hit him, not me.

1895
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:56,840
That's what happens. Ah!

1896
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:08,840
He got them earbuds in, literally. I like how I sit at the side of grace and I fucking am hurt.

1897
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:11,840
Save her, AirPodman.

1898
02:52:12,840 --> 02:52:17,840
He has them... He's the type of guy to wear...

1899
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:21,840
Am I kintite?

1900
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:25,840
Fuck is happening. I can't move my camera to look at him.

1901
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:29,840
Alright. Oh, I'm locked on, that's why.

1902
02:52:30,840 --> 02:52:37,840
He's the kind of guy that wears the air pods but like buys the thing to make them wired.

1903
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:41,840
Like how you can, like so you don't lose them from your phone, like that's what he does.

1904
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:45,840
Like he gets a little, like he buys a little thing and he wraps it around his neck.

1905
02:52:46,840 --> 02:52:48,840
And he hangs himself, sorry.

1906
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:51,840
Let me stand up here. Never mind.

1907
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:58,840
You know, you should really stop doing pot, bro. That's like not good for you.

1908
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:04,840
Not at all. There's a dog. Your dog is here. I have to kill you in front of your dog and I have to kill your dog.

1909
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:09,840
Look at all this pile of weed and pot they had. Oh my god, terrible.

1910
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:11,840
Horrible human beings.

1911
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:14,840
Let me go sit down again.

1912
02:53:16,840 --> 02:53:22,840
God, it is really hard to like run around because like it's hard to explore because everything's a fucking cliff.

1913
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:30,840
Let's go down here.

1914
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:39,840
My neck hurts.

1915
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:45,840
It cracked my neck but it didn't work out for me.

1916
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:48,840
Did I just break my armrest?

1917
02:53:54,840 --> 02:53:57,840
I almost snapped my neck there.

1918
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:11,840
Oh, that was awkward.

1919
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:17,840
So I have to go through the big area.

1920
02:54:20,840 --> 02:54:22,840
Oh, fine.

1921
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:25,840
Did I miss any scot-o-tree fragments?

1922
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:31,840
Are there any scot-o-tree fragments that I'm missing and this and where I've been so far?

1923
02:54:32,840 --> 02:54:39,840
I'm just gonna look myself. I don't need you guys, you guys, you guys get overwhelmed when I ask you for help.

1924
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:55,840
No, I want the actual fucking map.

1925
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:58,840
Thank you.

1926
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:05,840
Can I have the map, please? I just want the map. I just want the map. I just, I would like the map.

1927
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:10,840
Give me, no, I don't care about Best Buy ads.

1928
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:32,840
Oh my god, I'm going to fucking kill.

1929
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:39,840
Okay, there's a lot that I missed. Holy hell.

1930
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:47,840
Where am I?

1931
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:54,840
Hold on, I can't see you guys. I can't see your little, your little quips.

1932
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:04,840
There is 50 to get to level 20 because then you just buy three.

1933
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:14,840
Okay, so where am I now?

1934
02:56:17,840 --> 02:56:24,840
Let me look at Scythe of Grace. Jesus fuck, no, that didn't help at all. Actually, no, it might.

1935
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:35,840
Okay, I am at, nope, that's, I'm using my controller to try to control stuff. What the fuck am I doing? Stop.

1936
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:40,840
Oh my god, that's because I'm using my mouse.

1937
02:56:44,840 --> 02:56:50,840
Okay, so I am at the three, no, am I?

1938
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:51,840
Am I?

1939
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:57,840
I am behind the Fort of Reprimand.

1940
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:22,840
So, yeah, I think I got that. Did I get the Morph Ruins encampment? I think I did.

1941
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:40,840
I still haven't gone to Bonnie Village. Where is Bonnie Village? No, that's down there. That's Bonnie Village is down here.

1942
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:53,840
I thought it was on the same level. Okay, there's one in the center that I got. There's one over here. I don't know if I got it.

1943
02:57:55,840 --> 02:57:59,840
There's one over here. I just got that.

1944
02:57:59,840 --> 02:58:12,840
I don't know if I got all of them over here. I think I did. There's one over here. I'm pretty sure I got that.

1945
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:20,840
I don't know. I probably didn't. There's some around here.

1946
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:35,840
Cliff Road Terminus. I don't even have the grace over there. So I could go over there.

1947
02:58:36,840 --> 02:58:53,840
I haven't cleared this out yet. Fuck it. Let's fall. How do I get over there anyways? I don't even think I can. I don't even think I can get over there. Fuck.

1948
02:58:55,840 --> 02:58:58,840
What the sh-

1949
02:59:06,840 --> 02:59:15,840
Should I just go to the Shadowkeep? I feel like I can get over there.

1950
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:18,840
I don't know.

1951
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:43,840
Should I just go to the Shadowkeep? I feel like I should just go to the Shadowkeep. I think I'm just going to go to the Shadowkeep.

1952
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:52,840
Can I combine my tabs, please?

1953
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:02,840
What are you guys saying? Is that where I'm back with more of? Shall we do the five?

1954
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:12,840
Okay. Let's try it. Let's try it. Let's try it.

1955
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:15,840
You should make buffalo wings. Oh, so I'm freaking bomb.

1956
03:00:26,840 --> 03:00:29,840
I'm not ignoring you. I wasn't looking. The chat was closed.

1957
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:35,840
Did I go in there?

1958
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:39,840
I did. I don't know what the heck I'm talking about.

1959
03:00:42,840 --> 03:00:44,840
What's his name?

1960
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:47,840
What?

1961
03:00:55,840 --> 03:00:56,840
Oh.

1962
03:00:58,840 --> 03:00:59,840
Okay.

1963
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:03,840
So I go along here?

1964
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:09,840
Is that what you're saying?

1965
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:12,840
He's chill?

1966
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:15,840
Okay.

1967
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:23,840
Oh, do I get down there?

1968
03:01:25,840 --> 03:01:27,840
These deer are tweaking out.

1969
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:30,840
Guys, are you sure?

1970
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:36,840
Are you sure about that?

1971
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:46,840
I don't know why. I generally shouldn't doubt you guys have actually played the game, whereas I have not.

1972
03:01:48,840 --> 03:01:52,840
All right, let's keep swimming. What the hell?

1973
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:06,840
Ow, I started crying and I was going, what the fuck?

1974
03:02:09,840 --> 03:02:11,840
Oh my God.

1975
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:15,840
Why are the NPCs so violent?

1976
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:19,840
Oh my God, you're actually going to kill me.

1977
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:22,840
Jesus Christ.

1978
03:02:22,840 --> 03:02:25,840
Frozen maggot. I feel like I should start calling you guys.

1979
03:02:26,840 --> 03:02:28,840
Interesting graves.

1980
03:02:28,840 --> 03:02:30,840
Interesting graves.

1981
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:32,840
Acquire materials.

1982
03:02:32,840 --> 03:02:36,840
Where am I? What is that? I kind of want to see what that is.

1983
03:02:39,840 --> 03:02:40,840
Oh, it's this.

1984
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:47,840
Wait, what?

1985
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:49,840
Okay.

1986
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:51,840
Oh, that was pointless. Never mind.

1987
03:02:51,840 --> 03:03:09,840
Okay, throwing it. You just throw hands? Unprovoked? I just walked up to them and stood there and they're like, you know what?

1988
03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:15,840
After your life, Bing Bong, who's a ghost puppy? Who's a ghost puppy chewing on a ghost person?

1989
03:03:15,840 --> 03:03:17,840
I'm dead. I'm not dead.

1990
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:21,840
I just can't fucking platform them.

1991
03:03:22,840 --> 03:03:25,840
Okay, maybe I'll be able to grab this now that they're down there.

1992
03:03:26,840 --> 03:03:29,840
Please? Oh my God, torrent.

1993
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:33,840
Oh, Jesus Christ. It's a fucking smithing stone. Wow.

1994
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:36,840
He did that really badly.

1995
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:42,840
Oh my God, that bat scared me.

1996
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:45,840
I don't know, just like jumped out of nowhere.

1997
03:03:48,840 --> 03:03:53,840
I'd be going up to the bat to where am I?

1998
03:03:57,840 --> 03:04:00,840
Fabuloso. Let's take a seat.

1999
03:04:02,840 --> 03:04:04,840
Can you chill out for a second?

2000
03:04:12,840 --> 03:04:15,840
Matt, no, I'm not doing an arcane build. I'm doing a...

2001
03:04:17,840 --> 03:04:22,840
Intelligence, dexterity, strength build.

2002
03:04:22,840 --> 03:04:25,840
Because I just have a moon veil and I want moon veil part two.

2003
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:31,840
Is this where I was before? Are you fucking serious? This looks like the same fucking castle I was at.

2004
03:04:32,840 --> 03:04:33,840
What?

2005
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:37,840
What is that guy? Hello?

2006
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:39,840
Jars?

2007
03:04:40,840 --> 03:04:42,840
What the hell?

2008
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:46,840
Sorry, ew, you are ugly. Oh my God.

2009
03:04:49,840 --> 03:04:51,840
Do you drop anything interesting?

2010
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:55,840
Let's see, how much damage? Oh.

2011
03:04:56,840 --> 03:04:57,840
Alright.

2012
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:58,840
Alright.

2013
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:08,840
Huh.

2014
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:12,840
The Yoda sword?

2015
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:16,840
Is that the way they call it?

2016
03:05:16,840 --> 03:05:18,840
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

2017
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:22,840
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

2018
03:05:23,840 --> 03:05:24,840
Prospect Sound.

2019
03:05:26,840 --> 03:05:30,840
This doesn't really look like much of a town to me, to be honest with you.

2020
03:05:31,840 --> 03:05:34,840
It looks kind of dead. What do I have all the way over there?

2021
03:05:36,840 --> 03:05:39,840
Let's just yank that.

2022
03:05:39,840 --> 03:05:41,840
Go away. Thank you.

2023
03:05:42,840 --> 03:05:43,840
Alright.

2024
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:46,840
Alright, let's bounce.

2025
03:05:47,840 --> 03:05:49,840
I thought that tree was a thing.

2026
03:05:50,840 --> 03:05:51,840
He's gonna walk.

2027
03:05:52,840 --> 03:05:56,840
Assuming that there'll be these guys. Let's see if I can aggro him.

2028
03:05:57,840 --> 03:05:58,840
Come out. Come on.

2029
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:01,840
Come on.

2030
03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:04,840
Come on.

2031
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:06,840
Come on.

2032
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:07,840
Come out. Come on.

2033
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:13,840
I don't know if I fight the other one just for that yet.

2034
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:23,840
Nice. Got me.

2035
03:06:23,840 --> 03:06:24,840
Got me.

2036
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:34,840
What the fuck?

2037
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:36,840
I don't know what I'm doing.

2038
03:06:36,840 --> 03:06:38,840
Oh, interesting. You got blood?

2039
03:06:40,840 --> 03:06:42,840
That was a stupid thing. That's fine.

2040
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:44,840
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing.

2041
03:06:44,840 --> 03:06:46,840
I keep forgetting to change my physics.

2042
03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:48,840
I keep forgetting to change my physics.

2043
03:06:48,840 --> 03:06:50,840
There's probably not a side of Grayson here.

2044
03:06:51,840 --> 03:06:53,840
Birds. Cool.

2045
03:06:55,840 --> 03:06:56,840
Cool.

2046
03:06:56,840 --> 03:06:57,840
Alright.

2047
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:58,840
Got some pots.

2048
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:00,840
It's alright.

2049
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:03,840
We got some rabbit things.

2050
03:07:04,840 --> 03:07:06,840
Got something else. Let's make a noise.

2051
03:07:07,840 --> 03:07:09,840
Got some more birds.

2052
03:07:10,840 --> 03:07:11,840
We got some platforming.

2053
03:07:12,840 --> 03:07:13,840
You know, this is a nice...

2054
03:07:14,840 --> 03:07:16,840
I thought I was holding a giant fucking lollipop for a second.

2055
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:18,840
Interesting so far.

2056
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:23,840
Yeah, I'm scouting for frags.

2057
03:07:24,840 --> 03:07:25,840
Frag out!

2058
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:27,840
I just throw a scat of tree fragment.

2059
03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:30,840
Oh my god. Sorry.

2060
03:07:31,840 --> 03:07:32,840
That was such a bad joke.

2061
03:07:33,840 --> 03:07:34,840
Oh my god.

2062
03:07:34,840 --> 03:07:35,840
Torrent, help.

2063
03:07:35,840 --> 03:07:36,840
Torrent, help.

2064
03:07:37,840 --> 03:07:38,840
Torrent, don't help that much though.

2065
03:07:43,840 --> 03:07:44,840
Wow, there's a lot of them.

2066
03:07:44,840 --> 03:07:45,840
There's, you know, hanging in.

2067
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:46,840
Let's sneak around this way.

2068
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:48,840
What are they chewing on?

2069
03:07:51,840 --> 03:07:52,840
She's just, like, watching?

2070
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:54,840
Are they chewing on anything?

2071
03:07:56,840 --> 03:07:57,840
Are they just eating their own?

2072
03:07:59,840 --> 03:08:00,840
What the hell is happening here?

2073
03:08:02,840 --> 03:08:03,840
Is he sleeping and they're licking him?

2074
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:05,840
What are they drinking?

2075
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:06,840
I don't know.

2076
03:08:06,840 --> 03:08:08,840
I don't want to disturb them to be honest.

2077
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:10,840
I don't want to disturb them.

2078
03:08:11,840 --> 03:08:12,840
I don't want to disturb them.

2079
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:13,840
I don't know.

2080
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:14,840
I don't want to.

2081
03:08:14,840 --> 03:08:15,840
I don't want to disturb them to be honest.

2082
03:08:16,840 --> 03:08:17,840
They're doing their own thing.

2083
03:08:17,840 --> 03:08:18,840
I'll be over here.

2084
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:21,840
He's just raising his staff.

2085
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:26,840
He's monitoring the whole operation.

2086
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:28,840
That was a chest.

2087
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:32,840
Faboo.

2088
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:34,840
Outer god heirloom?

2089
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:36,840
Question mark?

2090
03:08:42,840 --> 03:08:43,840
I don't know what that means.

2091
03:08:44,840 --> 03:08:45,840
How did I get that?

2092
03:08:46,840 --> 03:08:47,840
I don't even remember picking that up.

2093
03:08:48,840 --> 03:08:49,840
Two-handed.

2094
03:08:50,840 --> 03:08:51,840
Wow!

2095
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:52,840
Raises arcane.

2096
03:08:52,840 --> 03:08:53,840
That was worth it.

2097
03:08:54,840 --> 03:08:55,840
Okay, where's the scottachy fragment?

2098
03:08:57,840 --> 03:08:58,840
Where are you at, bitch?

2099
03:08:59,840 --> 03:09:00,840
Fuck, I can't jump over.

2100
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:04,840
I don't know what that means.

2101
03:09:05,840 --> 03:09:06,840
How did I get that?

2102
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:08,840
I don't even remember picking that up.

2103
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:10,840
Two-handed.

2104
03:09:11,840 --> 03:09:12,840
I hear...

2105
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:14,840
like, monster noises.

2106
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:16,840
There must be one below.

2107
03:09:17,840 --> 03:09:18,840
A little flower.

2108
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:20,840
Oh, thank you.

2109
03:09:21,840 --> 03:09:22,840
Sanguine amaryllis.

2110
03:09:24,840 --> 03:09:25,840
You picked it up at Castle A.

2111
03:09:26,840 --> 03:09:27,840
I thought there's one over here.

2112
03:09:28,840 --> 03:09:29,840
Am I stupid?

2113
03:09:40,840 --> 03:09:41,840
Yep.

2114
03:09:56,840 --> 03:09:57,840
Yes, there's one on the edge.

2115
03:09:58,840 --> 03:09:59,840
It's literally, it's...

2116
03:10:00,840 --> 03:10:01,840
literally...

2117
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:03,840
right there.

2118
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:08,840
Right there.

2119
03:10:08,840 --> 03:10:19,680
I can't see chat and I know you guys are going to be crying.

2120
03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:31,960
Oh the Talisman I got from Castling Hills, honestly, I can't jump down.

2121
03:10:31,960 --> 03:10:32,960
Let's see.

2122
03:10:32,960 --> 03:10:33,960
Do you have anything that I can?

2123
03:10:33,960 --> 03:10:34,960
What's that?

2124
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:35,960
Wow, that was a hit.

2125
03:10:35,960 --> 03:10:39,760
Hey, I do you have anything?

2126
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:44,200
I know you're just chewing on him and he's not like, why is there a Stake America here?

2127
03:10:44,200 --> 03:10:50,160
That doesn't make any sense.

2128
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:56,640
Later nerds, later nerds, I hope you fall off the cliff and give me rooms.

2129
03:10:56,640 --> 03:10:59,080
What the heck?

2130
03:10:59,080 --> 03:11:00,080
Haha, bitches.

2131
03:11:00,080 --> 03:11:04,040
Whoa, whoa, what are you going to do about it then?

2132
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:08,760
Oh, you're just going to stun them with your fonts and fonts with your fucking little thing.

2133
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:09,680
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2134
03:11:09,680 --> 03:11:11,360
That's what I thought you little bitches.

2135
03:11:11,360 --> 03:11:16,360
Oh, I can't jump down there.

2136
03:11:16,360 --> 03:11:17,360
Yep.

2137
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:27,200
All right, that's a very nice Stake.

2138
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:30,200
That's a very admirable Stake.

2139
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:32,920
Hi, got to go.

2140
03:11:32,920 --> 03:11:35,000
It was really nice seeing you though.

2141
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,800
You're very, very sweet.

2142
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:42,920
Okay, so there's a fragment around here somewhere.

2143
03:11:42,920 --> 03:11:43,920
What's that?

2144
03:11:43,920 --> 03:11:46,920
It's very, very strong.

2145
03:11:46,920 --> 03:11:47,920
Hmm.

2146
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:48,920
Hmm.

2147
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:49,920
Hmm.

2148
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:53,920
This must be it right here.

2149
03:11:53,920 --> 03:11:54,920
No.

2150
03:11:54,920 --> 03:11:56,920
What the fuck?

2151
03:11:56,920 --> 03:11:59,920
What the hell?

2152
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:01,920
What is shooting stuff?

2153
03:12:01,920 --> 03:12:03,920
A nice try, doggie.

2154
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:05,920
Where is it?

2155
03:12:05,920 --> 03:12:07,920
Where is it?

2156
03:12:07,920 --> 03:12:09,920
Where is it?

2157
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:13,920
What the fuck?

2158
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:15,920
It's probably a guy.

2159
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:17,920
Probably.

2160
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:22,920
You're probably right.

2161
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:25,920
Where are you, puppy?

2162
03:12:25,920 --> 03:12:29,920
Nope, that doesn't reach.

2163
03:12:29,920 --> 03:12:32,920
What are you doing?

2164
03:12:32,920 --> 03:12:33,920
Ow!

2165
03:12:33,920 --> 03:12:34,920
Ow!

2166
03:12:34,920 --> 03:12:35,920
It's not nice.

2167
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:41,920
Let me hit you.

2168
03:12:41,920 --> 03:12:42,920
It's Potman.

2169
03:12:42,920 --> 03:12:43,920
That's right.

2170
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:47,920
Ever got it said that sometimes the dudes with the pots will have it.

2171
03:12:47,920 --> 03:12:48,920
Hey.

2172
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:49,920

2173
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:50,920
Excuse me.

2174
03:12:50,920 --> 03:12:54,920
Where did Potbro go?

2175
03:12:54,920 --> 03:12:55,920
Potbro!

2176
03:12:55,920 --> 03:12:56,920
Oh.

2177
03:12:56,920 --> 03:12:58,920
Where'd he go?

2178
03:12:58,920 --> 03:13:00,920
Potman.

2179
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:02,920
Whoa.

2180
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:04,920
What?

2181
03:13:04,920 --> 03:13:06,920
What the fuck?

2182
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:08,920
Where did this dude go?

2183
03:13:08,920 --> 03:13:13,920
Is he like a scarab?

2184
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:17,920
Are you shitting me right now?

2185
03:13:17,920 --> 03:13:20,920

03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:12,920
Wait.

don't push me cuz i'm close to the

2292
03:22:07,740 --> 03:22:15,100
I just pushed myself to be honest. I don't really care about those runes. Let's get rid of these.

2293
03:22:17,660 --> 03:22:20,220
Okay, let's look. What else do I got around here?

2294
03:22:23,260 --> 03:22:28,460
I can't go to the hippo yet. The hippo guy. Mesbur's boyfriend.

2295
03:22:31,420 --> 03:22:34,220
I already got one of the three paths across. I already got one there.

2296
03:22:38,620 --> 03:22:47,260
Did I go to...?

2297
03:22:50,860 --> 03:22:55,500
I never went into this. Is this the arena that you fight him in?

2298
03:22:57,420 --> 03:23:00,300
Because there's scatotry fragments and there's two in here.

2299
03:23:02,700 --> 03:23:06,860
Explain. Is this the arena where you fight him? The dancing lion? I don't...

2300
03:23:08,540 --> 03:23:15,340
question. That's endgame stuff? Oh, that's the final area? That's where the gate is?

2301
03:23:17,740 --> 03:23:22,060
Okay, weird. Good to know.

2302
03:23:22,060 --> 03:23:24,060
No.

2303
03:23:30,140 --> 03:23:36,540
Lore reasons understood. All right, so we'll skip that for now because yeah, there's like three.

2304
03:23:37,900 --> 03:23:39,340
Wait, there's one in a secret room.

2305
03:23:43,020 --> 03:23:45,180
There's one in a secret room over here.

2306
03:23:45,180 --> 03:23:52,380
Is that also endgame? I'm assuming so. Unless there's like an area to get it over

2307
03:23:53,100 --> 03:23:57,980
if you go to the theater and there's one over here. Tell me, am I incorrect?

2308
03:24:02,860 --> 03:24:04,220
Could I get that to that?

2309
03:24:06,860 --> 03:24:11,900
No, yes. Waiting for you guys to type in for the latency to catch up.

2310
03:24:16,140 --> 03:24:18,060
It might be the one with the flights?

2311
03:24:20,940 --> 03:24:25,660
Okay. Oh, we'll save that then. So I did that, did that.

2312
03:24:28,300 --> 03:24:33,580
There's one near the pillar path cross. Nope, fuck.

2313
03:24:33,820 --> 03:24:47,980
Well, that's over here. It's literally right here. Wait, is it there? Question mark?

2314
03:24:53,500 --> 03:24:55,180
I can't tell if it's on the edge or if it's...

2315
03:24:58,140 --> 03:25:01,100
I can't tell if it's on the edge or if it's in this area.

2316
03:25:02,060 --> 03:25:02,780
Huh?

2317
03:25:07,740 --> 03:25:13,100
That's where sad... Who's sad poison boy? All right, let's go see sad poison boy.

2318
03:25:17,020 --> 03:25:18,860
Let's see how sad poison boy is doing.

2319
03:25:20,780 --> 03:25:24,380
Is that... Is that you guys? Is that... Are you guys sad poison boy? You love him?

2320
03:25:25,420 --> 03:25:29,980
Do you identify with him? Do you identify with this character? Is he you for real? For real?

2321
03:25:31,740 --> 03:25:35,340
You want to be sad? You love sad poison boy? Is he cute? Like,

2322
03:25:36,300 --> 03:25:39,820
can I use him as a physical representation of you guys in game and just like

2323
03:25:40,940 --> 03:25:48,860
make sweet sweet love to him or something? Is he cute? Maybe? All right, I'll see.

2324
03:25:53,420 --> 03:25:59,260
Is he like handsome and got it bopping? Like, is he... Oh, Swift Spear. Wow, I need that.

2325
03:26:01,100 --> 03:26:08,860
He wears a mask? Oh, you know, I'm into that. I'm into, you know, that's why you, you know,

2326
03:26:08,860 --> 03:26:14,060
harlots wear a mask. I like a little bit of mask play, you know, just like, you know,

2327
03:26:14,060 --> 03:26:17,180
scream guy. Oh, there's a side of grace over here.

2328
03:26:20,380 --> 03:26:24,220
Oh my god, is that him? Is that poison boy? Who won? Is that soldier boy?

2329
03:26:24,860 --> 03:26:27,900
Oh my god, if I can fucking get off the horse.

2330
03:26:31,820 --> 03:26:35,820
He only wants to sleep. What are these?

2331
03:26:39,340 --> 03:26:46,460
Empyrean blood? Hi! Hey, oh, you know, oh, you look like a femme boy to the extreme.

2332
03:26:47,260 --> 03:26:51,820
You know, I like myself a femme boy. I like all types of boys.

2333
03:26:55,020 --> 03:27:00,380
Oh, he sounds so cute. I am. Oh, I'm gonna peg the shit out of you.

2334
03:27:02,620 --> 03:27:08,940
Oh, yeah. Oh, Tiaulia. That's a gay ass name, but you know, you're kind of cute.

2335
03:27:10,060 --> 03:27:15,500
You're really pretty hair. Yeah, you just turn around.

2336
03:27:19,660 --> 03:27:23,900
Turn around. You don't have to be good at this. Just take your ass up in the air.

2337
03:27:24,540 --> 03:27:30,540
Oh, are you now? You know, I like that about you.

2338
03:27:34,380 --> 03:27:35,980
Can you poison these nuts in your face?

2339
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:42,540
Ooh, toxic musling.

2340
03:27:42,940 --> 03:27:52,220
You know, I'll come back to you, cutie pie. Let's chat.

2341
03:27:53,980 --> 03:27:58,540
What can I help you with? Oh, let me take off that mask and see what that mouth do.

2342
03:28:00,060 --> 03:28:04,060
He's so you. He got, he really is. You get like, this is you guys right here. I'm just gonna,

2343
03:28:05,660 --> 03:28:09,660
I'm a fat bastard right now, but he's a fat ugly bastard right now. But you know, just

2344
03:28:10,620 --> 03:28:21,980
if I just take you, he has a quest line. Interesting.

2345
03:28:25,740 --> 03:28:25,980
Cool.

2346
03:28:26,620 --> 03:28:41,820
Sick. We're at seven.

2347
03:28:45,260 --> 03:28:49,980
If you travel further up the cliff following the, you'll hear the other members of chat. What do you

2348
03:28:49,980 --> 03:28:56,860
mean? I go up the cliff where people just chat to chat and shit. Are they, are they have the chat?

2349
03:28:58,780 --> 03:29:06,380
Rada. Rada, rada. Let's see. Where else do we go? What do you mean?

2350
03:29:09,260 --> 03:29:10,940
Him. Who's him?

2351
03:29:11,340 --> 03:29:23,820
Okay, and then the rest are kind of in places I can't get to. What the hell? Is there some in the

2352
03:29:23,820 --> 03:29:33,260
fucking ocean? What the hell? I'm assuming that's below. How do I look below?

2353
03:29:33,260 --> 03:29:36,700
Okay.

2354
03:29:39,980 --> 03:29:45,740
Two in the fucking ocean. I can't fucking accidentally put them to bed.

2355
03:29:48,700 --> 03:29:52,700
Okay, and the rest are kind of later in the map.

2356
03:29:54,380 --> 03:29:56,700
Is this one in the castle front?

2357
03:29:57,260 --> 03:30:02,460
Oh, is this where Mesmer is? Oh, no, not Mesmer.

2358
03:30:11,100 --> 03:30:20,060
Oh, Mesmer, daddy. Little abandoned boy with mommy issues, Mesmer. Okay, I think I can like it up to

2359
03:30:22,300 --> 03:30:24,140
underground. What the frick?

2360
03:30:27,420 --> 03:30:31,100
Okay, I go up the cliff. What do you mean? Which way? Which way up the cliff?

2361
03:30:33,740 --> 03:30:35,740
This cliff that I'm facing over here?

2362
03:30:35,740 --> 03:30:45,740
Okay.

2363
03:30:54,620 --> 03:30:55,020
West.

2364
03:30:58,220 --> 03:30:59,420
And head south? Okay.

2365
03:30:59,660 --> 03:31:08,220
Is this the rest of you guys? Are these you?

2366
03:31:11,900 --> 03:31:13,900
Moning masochistic men. What?

2367
03:31:17,580 --> 03:31:18,700
Am I going the right way?

2368
03:31:21,660 --> 03:31:27,900
Keep going. All right, if you insist. Oh, there's a side of grace over here.

2369
03:31:30,060 --> 03:31:33,420
Oh, hello.

2370
03:31:49,340 --> 03:31:49,980
Are you good?

2371
03:31:59,980 --> 03:32:03,100
Um.

2372
03:32:12,940 --> 03:32:13,900
Where are your legs?

2373
03:32:16,940 --> 03:32:17,420
Hey.

2374
03:32:21,340 --> 03:32:21,580
Oh.

2375
03:32:25,900 --> 03:32:26,220
Yeah.

2376
03:32:26,460 --> 03:32:30,220
There is life in me yet. Are you screaming about a dragon?

2377
03:32:44,460 --> 03:32:46,220
Yeah, when I'm taking a shit.

2378
03:32:51,980 --> 03:32:52,620
All right.

2379
03:32:52,700 --> 03:32:58,700
All right. That's great, bro. Um, can I kill you? No, I'm kidding. I won't kill.

2380
03:33:03,580 --> 03:33:05,740
Why don't you hear? I thought I heard boss music for a second.

2381
03:33:09,980 --> 03:33:13,900
She be after a milkshake. Oh my god. Fowl.

2382
03:33:16,700 --> 03:33:19,180
What's over here? I don't think I've been over here yet.

2383
03:33:19,980 --> 03:33:25,340
These birds? Are they statues? I can't fucking tell.

2384
03:33:27,340 --> 03:33:31,340
Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I feel like one of these things is not like the other.

2385
03:33:33,740 --> 03:33:40,620
One of them real. Oh, it's you. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Oh, you're funny. You're real funny.

2386
03:33:40,620 --> 03:33:43,020
Can I? Ow. Jesus fuck.

2387
03:33:47,420 --> 03:33:50,860
And the rest are pretty real. Yeah, you're real.

2388
03:33:56,220 --> 03:34:00,540
Like how they jump on the ground. How did something die?

2389
03:34:02,780 --> 03:34:08,620
It's over here. Is there one over here? Oh, they're just like hanging up.

2390
03:34:08,620 --> 03:34:11,100
That one has something. I don't know. It's like blowing and shit.

2391
03:34:15,820 --> 03:34:22,220
Oh my god. It's a bird. Bird bath over here. I can't get up.

2392
03:34:24,700 --> 03:34:29,900
I've fallen and I can't get up. I know. I don't need to use target lock. I already fucking know.

2393
03:34:33,260 --> 03:34:37,180
I won a voice act as an NPC in a soulsite game. That is my dream.

2394
03:34:38,140 --> 03:34:41,020
I just want to be like, oh, hi there.

2395
03:34:43,980 --> 03:34:51,020
I suppose you're wondering why I'm here. Well, I'm just a funny girl, you see, and...

2396
03:34:53,740 --> 03:34:54,620
I don't fucking know.

2397
03:34:54,620 --> 03:35:09,820
Oh, something in my eye. What the fuck just got in my eye? Playing with one hand.

2398
03:35:17,100 --> 03:35:22,460
Ah, bitch. My eyes are twitching and there's something in my eye.

2399
03:35:25,580 --> 03:35:32,140
What's in here then? What's in the tower then? I kind of want to go around the tower.

2400
03:35:32,140 --> 03:35:37,740
Suppressing pillar. Suppressing my emotions pillar.

2401
03:35:40,620 --> 03:35:44,540
Let's check it out. I always play with one hand, brother.

2402
03:35:47,900 --> 03:35:53,260
Theater. I would be, I can go so good for my voice acting. Don't even try me.

2403
03:35:55,260 --> 03:36:01,420
I can get really into it. You guys don't hear it on Patreon as much because it's paid. What the fuck?

2404
03:36:02,300 --> 03:36:04,860
It's Patreon. Is it going to teleport me somewhere? What's this?

2405
03:36:05,900 --> 03:36:10,780
Why is there an ancient dragon smithing stone just up here? Anyways, yippee.

2406
03:36:10,780 --> 03:36:25,980
I still have something in my eye. I'm telling you. I got it out. I'm telling you.

2407
03:36:28,300 --> 03:36:32,700
I like how they freeze. Like there's like red light fucking green light over here.

2408
03:36:32,700 --> 03:36:39,420
Yep, bitch.

2409
03:36:46,300 --> 03:36:54,540
Nice try. You almost got me there, Batman. Batman riddle me this.

2410
03:37:03,420 --> 03:37:07,420
For the view and some more, yeah. And this dude just screaming for no reason.

2411
03:37:09,660 --> 03:37:12,540
I'm just gonna do that real quick.

2412
03:37:16,860 --> 03:37:24,140
Because I can, I'll do with my whole, my whole soul. I'll be the best voice actor. Okay.

2413
03:37:25,100 --> 03:37:32,300
Oh, my shit's over there. I totally forgot. I don't really care that much about that. I suppose

2414
03:37:34,300 --> 03:37:37,020
let's go, what is this? I haven't been over there yet.

2415
03:37:43,180 --> 03:37:48,860
Let's go to the shadow of Keep of Mesmer. You think it'd be a more interesting name?

2416
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:54,380
Like I thought I think it'd be more intense. Is there a way to get down there?

2417
03:37:55,340 --> 03:38:01,340
Because I would like to clear other things out. Like I'd like to get over here and here.

2418
03:38:01,340 --> 03:38:06,700
Can I jump down there? Ah, she'd be half like, oh, I should go far.

2419
03:38:08,300 --> 03:38:10,300
Follow the path towards the dragons.

2420
03:38:14,940 --> 03:38:15,980
Yeah, this way.

2421
03:38:19,660 --> 03:38:29,580
Let's do it. Nothing to it. They beheaded every dragon in these parts.

2422
03:38:32,060 --> 03:38:36,540
Let me kill this bird. Oh, my God, please.

2423
03:38:37,500 --> 03:38:41,100
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2424
03:38:42,460 --> 03:38:48,220
Ancient dragon man. Why the fuck is he all the way over there? Take your time.

2425
03:38:51,420 --> 03:38:53,100
Take your time.

2426
03:38:53,100 --> 03:39:15,980
Oh, that's a fucking sick outfit you're wearing, though, dude. I really like it.

2427
03:39:16,940 --> 03:39:23,820
Don't you dare fucking heal. I'm gonna keep spamming you. I know and I should play a lot

2428
03:39:23,820 --> 03:39:31,580
smarter, to be honest with you. Oh, my God, you're gonna kill me. No, I don't want to, too.

2429
03:39:33,020 --> 03:39:38,380
No. No. Why am I feeling like I'm having this kind of a delay?

2430
03:39:39,100 --> 03:39:49,180
That was weird. Can you drop something interesting? No? Are you shitting me right now?

2431
03:39:51,500 --> 03:39:54,540
I was hoping to get your fucking bomb-ass fit, dude.

2432
03:39:55,260 --> 03:40:06,380
Anyways, am I gonna fight a dragon? Let me step on this little...

2433
03:40:07,340 --> 03:40:10,220
It's a broken room.

2434
03:40:22,220 --> 03:40:28,220
See, guys? I can fight. I'm good at what I do. Fuck this bird.

2435
03:40:37,340 --> 03:40:42,220
Is there anything over here? I don't feel like... Oh, my God, I'm lagging a little bit.

2436
03:40:47,660 --> 03:40:55,420
Oh, there's a cave in it. I'm assuming I'm gonna fight a magma man. I don't want to fight a magma

2437
03:40:55,420 --> 03:41:05,980
worm. You could become a dragon? What? A dragon's pit. That's what I call my armpit.

2438
03:41:09,900 --> 03:41:11,740
Is that a boss thing over there?

2439
03:41:17,260 --> 03:41:22,540
Good luck. Oh, great. Hold on. Let me go pee before I do this. Oh, my neck. You hear that?

2440
03:41:25,420 --> 03:41:27,980
Let me check on Fia as well.

2441
03:45:25,420 --> 03:45:29,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2442
03:45:29,980 --> 03:45:33,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2443
03:45:33,980 --> 03:45:37,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2444
03:45:37,980 --> 03:45:39,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2445
03:45:39,980 --> 03:45:41,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2446
03:45:41,980 --> 03:45:43,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2447
03:45:43,980 --> 03:45:45,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2448
03:45:45,980 --> 03:45:47,980
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2449
03:45:47,980 --> 03:45:49,980
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2450
03:45:49,980 --> 03:45:51,980
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2451
03:45:52,540 --> 03:45:54,540
I'm sorry. I'm taking so long.

2452
03:45:54,540 --> 03:45:58,540
But we want some attention, so I'm giving you attention.

2453
03:45:58,540 --> 03:46:00,540
Wait for me.

2454
03:46:00,540 --> 03:46:06,540
You like, um, give me a hug, because I'll stand up on his hind legs and call on my shoulder if you want to hug.

2455
03:46:06,540 --> 03:46:12,540
You, you're so quick today.

2456
03:46:12,540 --> 03:46:16,540
You're so good. Might as well just help me with food.

2457
03:46:16,540 --> 03:46:18,540
Is that everything? Oh, I need a brush. Oh, my God.

2458
03:46:22,540 --> 03:46:28,540
Let me get rid of this. Let me go get some water.

2459
03:46:44,540 --> 03:46:46,540
Water, water, water.

2460
03:46:46,540 --> 03:46:48,540
I feel like I should eat something.

2461
03:46:48,540 --> 03:46:50,540
I have to eat some breakfast.

2462
03:46:51,100 --> 03:46:57,100
I have a bowl of cereal.

2463
03:46:57,100 --> 03:47:01,100
The milk may kill me, but we'll see.

2464
03:47:01,100 --> 03:47:03,100
I'll see if the milk kills me.

2465
03:47:11,100 --> 03:47:13,100
He's not a horse.

2466
03:47:13,660 --> 03:47:21,660
He's getting the figures a horse.

2467
03:47:21,660 --> 03:47:23,660
Hi.

2468
03:47:23,660 --> 03:47:25,660
I know.

2469
03:47:25,660 --> 03:47:27,660
Hi, Chad.

2470
03:47:27,660 --> 03:47:29,660
What are you doing?

2471
03:47:31,660 --> 03:47:35,660
Looks like you're trying to ask yourself a dessert.

2472
03:47:43,100 --> 03:47:45,100
Oh.

2473
03:48:03,100 --> 03:48:05,100
All right.

2474
03:48:13,100 --> 03:48:15,100
Okay.

2475
03:48:35,100 --> 03:48:37,100
I got cereal.

2476
03:48:43,100 --> 03:48:45,100
It's Cheerios.

2477
03:48:49,100 --> 03:48:51,100
I'm going to need to work on my fine motor skills.

2478
03:48:55,100 --> 03:48:57,100
Take a lactate.

2479
03:48:57,100 --> 03:49:13,100
You can't tell me what to do.

2480
03:49:13,100 --> 03:49:17,100
You can't tell me what to do.

2481
03:49:17,100 --> 03:49:19,100
I have my hands up.

2482
03:49:21,100 --> 03:49:23,100
Ah, my headphones.

2483
03:49:27,100 --> 03:49:37,100
That was a pretty good joke.

2484
03:49:45,100 --> 03:49:47,100
Hello, sir.

2485
03:49:47,100 --> 03:49:49,100
Can I help you?

2486
03:49:49,100 --> 03:49:59,100
I'm being accosted by my cats.

2487
03:49:59,100 --> 03:50:05,100
Both Rena and Boomi are over here trying to get my cereal.

2488
03:50:05,100 --> 03:50:07,100
Oh, my God, Boomi, you're so much bigger than Rena now.

2489
03:50:07,100 --> 03:50:09,100
Oh, my God.

2490
03:50:13,100 --> 03:50:17,100
I never really looked at the size difference, but Jesus Christ.

2491
03:50:19,100 --> 03:50:21,100
Oh, my God.

2492
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:29,100
Rena's really staring at my spoon.

2493
03:50:49,100 --> 03:50:53,100
Your dad voicing your model hit div TV on.

2494
03:50:53,100 --> 03:50:55,100
That's funny.

2495
03:50:59,100 --> 03:51:01,100
Stop hitting on my dad.

2496
03:51:01,100 --> 03:51:03,100
Everybody's gay for my dad.

2497
03:51:13,100 --> 03:51:15,100
You're here for me and me only.

2498
03:51:15,100 --> 03:51:17,100
Not my parents.

2499
03:51:19,100 --> 03:51:21,100
No.

2500
03:51:39,100 --> 03:51:41,100
It was fun spending time with them.

2501
03:51:41,100 --> 03:51:43,100
My dad just can't make any dad jokes.

2502
03:51:43,100 --> 03:51:45,100
So did my mom.

2503
03:51:45,100 --> 03:51:47,100
She was so funny.

2504
03:51:49,100 --> 03:51:55,100
I'm making fun of my laugh from the golfing club because I showed them the golfing club.

2505
03:51:57,100 --> 03:51:59,100
No, he did not get his 50 bucks.

2506
03:52:05,100 --> 03:52:07,100
Yes, my parents are married.

2507
03:52:15,100 --> 03:52:17,100
What's the outfit today?

2508
03:52:17,100 --> 03:52:19,100
A mummy outfit?

2509
03:52:19,100 --> 03:52:21,100
Oh, no, it's not.

2510
03:52:21,100 --> 03:52:23,100
I'm not wearing toilet paper.

2511
03:52:23,100 --> 03:52:25,100
I swear.

2512
03:52:25,100 --> 03:52:27,100
I am.

2513
03:52:27,100 --> 03:52:29,100
Rena, you can't have this.

2514
03:52:29,100 --> 03:52:31,100
It's like.

2515
03:52:31,100 --> 03:52:33,100
Oh, come on.

2516
03:52:33,100 --> 03:52:35,100
I have no legs.

2517
03:52:35,100 --> 03:52:37,100
I have no legs.

2518
03:52:45,100 --> 03:52:47,100
I hold on.

2519
03:52:47,100 --> 03:52:49,100
I'll do some.

2520
03:52:53,100 --> 03:52:55,100
That's my surprise face.

2521
03:52:55,100 --> 03:52:57,100
I'm sweating.

2522
03:52:57,100 --> 03:52:59,100
Blushing and sweating.

2523
03:53:05,100 --> 03:53:07,100
No.

2524
03:53:11,100 --> 03:53:13,100
Rena, you can't have the milk.

2525
03:53:13,100 --> 03:53:15,100
It will literally puke.

2526
03:53:15,100 --> 03:53:17,100
You literally puked this morning because you tried to steal my milk.

2527
03:53:17,100 --> 03:53:19,100
Rumi, you either.

2528
03:53:21,100 --> 03:53:23,100
None of you can have it go away.

2529
03:53:23,100 --> 03:53:25,100
Oh, my God.

2530
03:53:25,100 --> 03:53:27,100
We're so big.

2531
03:53:31,100 --> 03:53:33,100
What else do I got?

2532
03:53:35,100 --> 03:53:37,100
What else?

2533
03:53:41,100 --> 03:53:43,100
And I'm like,

2534
03:53:43,100 --> 03:53:45,100
what were you doing, Harlett?

2535
03:53:47,100 --> 03:53:49,100
What were you up to?

2536
03:53:51,100 --> 03:53:53,100
Harlett?

2537
03:53:53,100 --> 03:53:55,100
Excuse me.

2538
03:53:55,100 --> 03:53:59,100
I can't believe you want to go out with my dad.

2539
03:53:59,100 --> 03:54:01,100
You don't want to stay with me.

2540
03:54:05,100 --> 03:54:07,100
Oh, my God.

2541
03:54:07,100 --> 03:54:09,100
We'll be drinking the milk.

2542
03:54:11,100 --> 03:54:13,100
What does this do?

2543
03:54:13,100 --> 03:54:15,100
Oh, what?

2544
03:54:15,100 --> 03:54:17,100
Huh?

2545
03:54:17,100 --> 03:54:19,100
Huh?

2546
03:54:19,100 --> 03:54:21,100
What?

2547
03:54:21,100 --> 03:54:23,100
Huh?

2548
03:54:29,100 --> 03:54:31,100
Huh?

2549
03:54:31,100 --> 03:54:33,100
Oh, it's getting cut off.

2550
03:54:33,100 --> 03:54:35,100
I don't know about that.

2551
03:54:39,100 --> 03:54:41,100
Oh, this is the heart eyes that kept it white.

2552
03:54:57,100 --> 03:54:59,100
Yeah.

2553
03:55:03,100 --> 03:55:07,100

2557
03:55:21,100 --> 03:55:23,100
What?

2558
03:55:23,100 --> 03:55:50,440
You're stupid, you're double stupid, you're triple stupid, you wanna hug?

2559
03:55:50,440 --> 03:55:51,440
You wanna hug?

2560
03:55:51,940 --> 03:55:53,440
Do you wanna hug?

2561
03:55:53,440 --> 03:55:56,440
You wanna hug, don't you?

2562
03:55:56,440 --> 03:56:02,440
You want a hug from me, your madam?

2563
03:56:02,440 --> 03:56:18,440
Come here, let me give you a hug, and we'll give you a smooch, muah, muah, muah.

2564
03:56:18,440 --> 03:56:23,440
That just takes off that, this makes me flat-chested.

2565
03:56:23,440 --> 03:56:30,440
Flat, flat.

2566
03:56:30,440 --> 03:56:36,440
Ah, it's my head's too big.

2567
03:56:36,440 --> 03:56:41,440
My head is too big.

2568
03:56:41,440 --> 03:56:53,440
My head is too big.

2569
03:56:53,440 --> 03:57:01,440
My head is too big.

2570
03:57:01,440 --> 03:57:02,440
Let's do anything?

2571
03:57:02,440 --> 03:57:05,440
Nope.

2572
03:57:06,440 --> 03:57:18,440
Yeah, that's stupid, the fucking wedding which thing got claimed, because of the Halloween music.

2573
03:57:18,440 --> 03:57:21,440
I don't know why I'm using my ring of voice, hold on.

2574
03:57:21,440 --> 03:57:29,440
Sometimes she just slips out when I'm in cutesy mode.

2575
03:57:29,440 --> 03:57:32,440
It's just like demonetized, I don't really care.

2576
03:57:32,440 --> 03:57:38,440
I told the manager to appeal it and stuff.

2577
03:58:03,440 --> 03:58:10,440
No, that's not on YouTube, it's just people like false claiming and stuff.

2578
03:58:10,440 --> 03:58:20,440
I'm trying to copyright stuff that doesn't belong to them.

2579
03:58:20,440 --> 03:58:23,440
It's almost time, oh frick, I gotta go.

2580
03:58:23,440 --> 03:58:27,440
I almost forgot about the members.

2581
03:58:27,440 --> 03:58:34,440
I didn't realize what time it was, I thought it was like four, holy crap.

2582
03:58:34,440 --> 03:58:39,440
Aw.

2583
03:58:39,440 --> 03:58:42,440
Thank you for reminding me.

2584
03:58:42,440 --> 03:58:46,440
Alright, yeah we're still doing it, you kidding me, why would I just cancel that?

2585
03:58:46,440 --> 03:58:48,440
Just to point the freaking out of the drink.

2586
03:58:48,440 --> 03:58:51,440
No.

2587
03:58:51,440 --> 03:58:53,440
Alright, bye.

2588
03:58:53,440 --> 03:58:56,440
I'll see the members in a second.

2589
03:58:56,440 --> 03:59:00,440
Can I raid myself?

2590
03:59:00,440 --> 03:59:03,440
Will that work?

2591
03:59:03,440 --> 03:59:09,440
Can I raid into my own stream?

2592
03:59:09,440 --> 03:59:13,440
Is that a possibility?

2593
03:59:13,440 --> 03:59:15,440
Can I raid into a member stream?

2594
03:59:15,440 --> 03:59:18,440
Oh it says from other channels, no you can't raid into yourself.

2595
03:59:18,440 --> 03:59:20,440
Why did Stronny say I could raid into myself?

2596
03:59:20,440 --> 03:59:21,440
That's not a thing.

2597
03:59:21,440 --> 03:59:24,440
Alright, well.

2598
03:59:24,440 --> 03:59:25,440
What's happening?

2599
03:59:25,440 --> 03:59:28,440
I'm leaving.

2600
03:59:28,440 --> 03:59:30,440
No, even my own streams I can't do.

2601
03:59:30,440 --> 03:59:32,440
They don't show up.

2602
03:59:32,440 --> 03:59:34,440
Hi Mari, bye Mari.

2603
03:59:34,440 --> 03:59:38,440
Whoops, I'm late.

2604
03:59:38,440 --> 03:59:40,440
Just like my, oh my fuck it.

2605
03:59:40,440 --> 03:59:43,440
Okay, I'm gonna go do a member stream.

2606
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:45,440
Bye.

2607
03:59:45,440 --> 03:59:47,440
Bye Stinkies, bye.

2608
03:59:47,440 --> 03:59:50,440
After the member stream, you might do a little bit more, Elden Ring.

2609
03:59:50,440 --> 03:59:53,440
Bye.

2610
03:59:53,440 --> 03:59:56,440
No, they can't, I'm so sorry Mari.

2611
03:59:56,440 --> 04:00:01,440
You have to be a member tier, not emo tier.

2612
04:00:01,440 --> 04:00:04,440
Bye.

2613
04:00:04,440 --> 04:00:07,440
Go to, if you remember, go to my stream.
