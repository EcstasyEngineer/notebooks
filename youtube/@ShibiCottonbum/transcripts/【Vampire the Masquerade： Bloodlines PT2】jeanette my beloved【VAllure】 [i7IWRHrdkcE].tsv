123980	127300	sehen
136320	140280	oh my freaking god
140280	141980	hello
141980	143900	it's me
143900	146860	your favorite, madam
146860	149840	it's so nice to see everybody
149840	153040	Wow, so many beautiful faces in this crowd.
153040	156280	My heart is going doki doki.
156280	160080	Oh, so many well wishes.
160080	161080	What do I do?
163960	165680	We forgot monetization pose.
165680	166680	Let's fucking go.
167840	168680	Oh my god, my back hurts.
168680	169760	Hello, hi.
172880	175120	Hello, yes.
175120	178280	Oh god, that scared me, I just get so red.
178280	180640	Yeah, but I hope you guys are doing well.
180640	183840	I'm doing lovely, minus I randomly got a migraine
183840	187160	and I'm like, what the hell?
189480	191720	I just woke up from a nappy nap.
193560	195160	To hope, and I went away a little bit
195160	199560	because of the nap and I took some acetaminophen.
199560	202280	You know a little bit about acetaminophen.
202280	203880	I really great acetaminophen.
204720	208200	I'm so excited.
208200	213520	Being, getting monetization and being a YouTube partner
213520	217040	has been a goal of mine since I was a teenager
217040	219720	making really stupid videos on the internet
219720	222480	and it feels really good.
223560	225280	I'm just healing my inner child.
225280	229280	I was crying so hard yesterday, tears of joy
229280	232480	and I know like it might not mean a lot to some of you
232520	236280	when you're just like, oh, it's whatever, it's this, it's that.
236280	241160	It's the principle of just like a long-term goal of mine.
243480	247720	It's like a decade in the works, just like,
247720	251600	even if it's a small milestone, but I hit it
251600	254720	and it means so much to me.
256400	258560	Like I turn the background, you might hear them running around
258560	260720	and Fia stole Boomi's toy
260760	262760	and so Boomi's not really happy about that.
266760	269440	But we're gonna have, it's so funny.
269440	271640	Strawni messages me and she's like,
271640	274800	when are we gonna have monetization stream?
274800	277640	Am I, Strawni, I told you, I said it was Sunday
277640	281600	and I don't know if she saw like literally above
283120	285520	like her message was me saying,
285520	288480	I'm having my monetization stream Sunday.
288480	291640	She's like, when are we having your monetization stream
291640	293480	is the next message?
293480	298280	I'm like, I think she just like sent it
298280	300280	and she's just like, did it, did it, did it.
302000	304760	That was funny, but yes, we're gonna have it Sunday.
306360	307840	I'm gonna try to get my,
309840	311600	I'm gonna try to get my toes done tomorrow.
311600	316600	I need them like book an appointment at the place tomorrow.
316600	317920	I should probably do that ASAP.
317920	320160	I probably should have done that before I fell asleep
322120	323840	and then we'll do it Sunday.
323840	325960	We're gonna be doing, I'm gonna have,
325960	328360	I need to set up my camera.
328360	333280	We're gonna be having thigh slash footsie cam.
333280	336640	I don't know how I'm gonna point it like under my desk.
337960	339400	That's gonna be so weird.
339400	341800	I don't know if that'll be allowed.
341800	344480	I'll have to think of like where I can put it.
345560	347080	Put the camera.
348120	350960	Cause I don't think YouTube will take kindly
350960	354560	to me doing like an up skirt sort of thing.
354560	356400	I don't know.
356400	360280	And I have to find, I don't know what to do with my tripod.
361720	363920	And I don't know if my camera will reach.
363920	366480	But yeah, I'll figure, I'll do all that.
369320	374320	Yeah, it'll be at my normal time at 4 p.m. on Sunday.
378000	381520	And then I can't even remember what else was on the schedule.
381520	383280	But yeah, and so we're doing that.
383280	385640	And we're gonna be eating some Japanese snacks.
385640	389480	You know how hard it is for me not to,
389480	392440	I've been holding on to this box of the soccer box
392440	394640	for like since I debuted now.
395920	397360	Cause somebody got it off my throne.
397360	401720	Cause I'm like, oh, I want to do this for like a,
401720	404760	like a membership stream or just like a stream in general.
404760	407800	And then I'm like, ooh, is it actually good for that?
407800	410080	And so we'll be trying some Japanese snacks.
411120	412400	I'm very excited.
412400	414480	I am not as dexterous as my mother.
414480	419160	So as my momay, I still have the Tito's on my desk.
419160	421000	I look like a fucking alcoholic.
421000	422640	If somebody came in to be like, wow,
422640	423480	what the fuck?
423480	425280	I just have a giant bottle of Tito's.
427320	428160	What did you get?
428160	429000	I haven't opened it yet.
429000	430800	I have no idea what's in the box.
430800	432080	What's in the box?
433320	435000	And then the week after,
435000	436640	I want to do a membership stream
436680	439040	or rewatch master of disguise.
439040	441840	I don't know how like watch alongs work.
441840	443840	I've never done a watch along.
443840	446480	I don't even know like how I'll get the,
446480	448640	like where we'll watch it.
448640	449480	I don't know.
449480	450320	I'll figure it out.
450320	451160	I have to ask Strani.
452640	454240	But that'll be on the day
454240	456240	that I can't remember off the top of my head.
456240	457640	I was getting really bombed.
457640	458480	If it's aimed at your feet,
458480	459480	will we get a cat cameo?
459480	460320	Oh, a hundred percent.
460320	464080	You guys will see my messy ass house in my cats.
464080	465120	So it'll be good.
467000	468080	Oh, maybe I can angle it.
468080	469760	So it looks like it's at my cats,
469760	471240	but it's actually at me.
471240	472080	Because it's like,
472080	473840	because Reina usually sleeps by my feet.
473840	474760	And so I can be like,
474760	477240	you guys can't see what I'm doing.
478640	481000	But yeah, it's if it's awesome.
481000	482480	I'm so happy.
482480	484880	I cried so hard yesterday.
484880	487520	It's like 1am and I was already half asleep.
487520	489720	You know, I woke up this morning
489720	491640	and I looked at my counter and I realized
491640	492720	I don't even remember this.
492720	494920	I made tea last night
494960	496920	and I don't even remember making tea.
498360	500640	I mean, it was just like left out.
500640	501960	And I was like, oh,
505120	507800	am I not totally enough to join the turtle club?
511360	512960	But yeah, it's going to be fun.
512960	517920	I am determined to also hopefully hit like 5k this week
517920	519200	or this upcoming week.
520640	522280	And it really sucks.
522280	523880	Because I was looking at my schedule
523880	526400	that my management sent me for my real job
526400	529400	and my hours are like really shitty.
530640	531760	And it would,
531760	533040	I would end up overlapping.
533040	535160	What the fuck is on my arm?
535160	536000	A bug?
536000	536840	Okay, no, it's not.
536840	537680	It's a piece of dust.
537680	538960	I was like, hello, sir.
541760	546200	Because I'll have to overlap with the Zera a lot.
546200	549200	Because I worked till like,
549200	550520	one day I worked till nine
550520	553280	and I'm just like, oh, I don't,
553320	555360	I can't do like an early morning stream.
555360	558200	And I just hope like,
559760	562200	I just, I don't know why they haven't made me part-time yet.
562200	564680	I think my boss called me right before I started stream,
564680	568680	but I didn't answer because I'm like, I'm doing stuff.
568680	573680	So I'll call back my store after I finished stream today.
574200	577120	But I'm hoping that the call was about like,
577120	579040	hey, we're just going to put you on part-time immediately
579040	580760	because I'm like, oh, great.
580760	583840	I'm working 11 to eight and 12 to nine.
583840	585920	That's so great.
585920	587680	Oh my God, every day this week.
587680	588520	Wow.
588520	589520	Thank you.
589520	590560	Thank you so much.
590560	593080	Oh, and you didn't schedule my proper days off
593080	594800	and you took my normal Wednesdays off.
594800	596720	Thank you so much.
596720	598360	Wow.
598360	599200	Thank you.
599200	601040	At least you got my Saturday days off right.
602880	605720	But yeah, I'll be going back to my job
605720	608320	after almost a three month leave
608360	611680	because your girl is depressed-y-s-y
611680	613800	and I also had a lot of health problems going on
613800	616440	and it was really affecting my work.
616440	617600	I was at risk of losing my job
617600	621400	because I was in so much pain that I couldn't go to work
624040	625720	because I love a fibroflare up
625720	627320	because I was so stressed out.
627320	628440	And they were just like talking to me
628440	630120	and be like, you need to work on your numbers,
630120	631160	your sales numbers.
631160	634480	And I'm like, I don't, I really don't give a shit.
634480	636920	Like I'm just trying to live right now.
636960	641240	And that's when Fiya was like not able to walk.
641240	642320	Her legs didn't work
642320	644840	and I had to take care of her and do all her meds
644840	648000	and also take care of myself at the same time
648000	650320	and then take care of Boomi and Reina
650320	652240	and still give them and love and attention
652240	654000	and then still also maintain relationships
654000	657320	outside of my job, like with my family and my friends.
657320	659040	And it was just, it was too, too, too much.
659040	660280	I couldn't handle it.
660280	661320	But I'm going back.
661320	662160	I feel better.
662160	664320	I'm in a better place.
664360	667520	Although if they don't switch my schedule over soon,
667520	669440	I'm probably just like, I might just quit
669440	673240	because I wanted to stay for reasons
673240	675120	but I don't think I'll be able to.
675120	676720	But we'll see.
676720	678160	Yeah, I'm very thankful
678160	680440	that I was able to get a temporary leave.
682200	683440	Yeah, Fiya is doing much better.
683440	684960	She is running all over my house.
684960	686520	She can jump.
686520	689840	She frolics about, she, what is she doing?
689840	691960	Boomi's just watching her like slam a toy
692000	694720	into my trash can and it's kind of funny
694720	697040	because she, I gave them both their favorite toy
697040	698920	with just a little spring toy
698920	702600	and she immediately fucking knocked it under my fridge.
703600	705000	And then Boomi got all sad
705000	706320	because then Fiya threw it
706320	707640	because Boomi likes to play fetch.
707640	709880	So I threw his and then Fiya got it.
709880	711920	And then Boomi looked at me like,
711920	715480	mama, what, why did you throw it to her?
715480	716800	I'm like, I didn't do it.
716800	717840	You were just too slow
717840	719800	and she got to it before you did.
720800	725880	But yes, we're making moves.
725880	726960	We're making strides.
726960	728120	It was so funny.
729280	730560	Do they keep you awake at night?
730560	732080	No, they wake me up early in the morning.
732080	732920	That's what they do.
732920	735320	They actually sleep with me really well at night.
735320	738560	Boomi becomes a sudden love bug at night.
738560	740880	They always sleep by my feet, on my feet.
740880	742440	Reina sleeps by my head.
745560	748160	That's Boomi right now, if you heard him, yeah.
749160	750920	What's the matter?
752120	754320	Where'd your toy go, sweetheart?
755960	757040	Did Fiya take it?
758160	760120	Did she knock it under the fridge?
760120	760960	Probably.
763000	764560	He looks so upset.
766160	770320	Yes, they're very dog-like.
773320	777920	But yeah, so I was gonna say
777920	779320	it was a really funny coincidence.
779320	781440	I'll read you off something.
781440	784000	I'm just gonna be ventriloquist for a second.
784000	786560	But I randomly got this notification from this thing
786560	790720	I used to be subscribed to about like,
790720	791880	it wasn't like horoscopes,
791880	794000	but just like things to like meditate on.
796200	797520	What the fuck has happened?
800480	801840	Hold on, I need to check on my cat.
801840	802960	Reina, are you okay?
802960	804280	Did you just fall?
806760	807600	Fall.
807920	808760	Fall.
821000	823680	I'm trying to find Reina and I'm walking around
823680	826640	and she jumped into my fucking laundry.
826640	829520	I don't know, my dirty clothes hamper.
830400	832560	And so I just look at her in the bathroom
832560	835080	and she's just staring up at me with her dark face
835080	836880	and big eyes like, hello.
836920	839040	I'm sitting and wallowing in your stink.
842520	845280	But the message I got says,
845280	847960	abundance and confidence and badly this is the finest times
847960	849400	where diligence can pay off.
849400	851920	Even if success isn't immediate, it will come.
851920	855800	You'll feel on track with some sort of measurable return
855800	857360	such as respect, greater self-worth,
857360	859560	financial gain, improved stability or security.
859560	861000	And I'm like, wow, that's so crazy
861000	863560	because literally all my dreams just came true yesterday.
863560	865680	Wow, when my dreams came true when I joined Vealer,
865720	867280	but you guys know what I mean.
872560	873840	It all goes on at 5 a.m.
873840	876520	It's supposed to be the end of the day.
876520	878080	You guys are quiet today.
878080	879240	What's going on?
881400	882480	What's up with that?
883480	885360	Everybody's so quiet.
885360	887520	There's like, Mathem, we're just here to hear.
887520	890520	We're just here to hear you, yeah.
890520	891360	I'm in a game.
891360	892200	I'm working.
892200	893040	Okay.
896520	897360	Scream, scream.
897360	899320	Okay, actually you just reminded me
899320	900960	because you just said you achieved your life.
900960	902240	I need a tweet that I am live.
902240	903440	Oh, I'm right now, oh my God.
903440	905240	She just jumped up on my nose.
910040	911160	Well, I hope you guys are having
911160	912840	a good productive day today.
918280	920360	Sorry, I'm just gonna tweet out on why.
922320	924320	For all my little habits.
926680	928000	Why?
933160	938160	But yeah, you can, you'll expect more later streams next week.
940480	941440	All I can say.
946880	948680	All right, I'm gonna go ventriloquist for a second
948680	950200	while I retweet at my all the count.
950200	951400	Did I even retweet it?
953360	954680	All right then.
955680	960800	I need to pull out a tharboop today, what the hell?
960800	961640	Hi.
963480	965080	Hello, hello.
965080	966080	I'm not being productive.
966080	969080	It's not a sheebie, sheebie, no, yeah, I'm being.
969080	971920	All right, I didn't get much done as of today.
971920	973240	I had a weekend off, so I'm good now.
973240	975320	Oh, it's good for you.
975320	977000	Very good for you.
977000	978200	No problem, arrange your schedule,
978200	979800	hope it freezes you, actually.
979800	980640	Yeah.
981640	983040	I would, I'll actually, I do,
983080	984800	I've always liked streaming in the middle of the day,
984800	988720	like people who have watched me before,
988720	992440	I usually actually streamed at like 12
992440	996120	or even 10 a.m. Eastern sometimes, a.m.
998080	1000520	Cause then I just like stream all day and it's great.
1002520	1003440	Okay.
1006600	1009560	I'm gonna, I'm practicing today.
1010560	1015040	I am not gonna yapp as much.
1015040	1017400	Yeah, we're gonna get into the game now.
1019080	1021360	Yes, I'm very EU friendly when it comes to streaming.
1021360	1023040	If my game will load, it will.
1028760	1030120	I'm trying something new
1031000	1033600	because you're more energetic as there are times.
1035720	1036560	Yeah.
1037880	1038720	Maybe.
1040560	1042600	I don't know, actually.
1042600	1044760	I think because like they're,
1044760	1046960	cause I used on Twitch and like everybody
1046960	1051960	and their fucking mom would stream at,
1054400	1057000	come on, come on, they're probably gonna wake up.
1059600	1062640	Sometimes it doesn't show up until, well,
1063760	1064600	there we go.
1067120	1069280	Everybody was streaming and it would be like,
1070240	1074560	it would just be like 20 people,
1074560	1076240	people that I also like to watch myself
1076240	1078960	just streaming all at the same time.
1078960	1081040	And I just, I,
1081040	1083920	I just knew I couldn't compete with the time slot
1083920	1085120	being such a small creator.
1085120	1086640	So I just like to stream in the middle of the day
1086640	1088880	and it was fun and then I had a lot of EU friends.
1091760	1093080	What have I done with the real sheebie?
1093080	1094240	Game's on.
1094240	1095960	All right.
1095960	1097400	Whoopsie daisies.
1100560	1102920	Not even 40 minutes of yet.
1106800	1108920	Yes, I'm sorry to let you down.
1111240	1112920	I'll be honest because of my migraine.
1112920	1115000	I don't have a lot to talk about today.
1116440	1118640	And I was looking back at my body yesterday
1118640	1120600	and I realized I only played two hours
1120600	1121600	to call the lamb.
1121600	1124200	And then I just talked for four hours after that.
1127640	1129360	Oh, where'd my coffee go?
1129360	1130560	Let me grow my coffee.
1138680	1140880	If you guys are quiet, I'm quiet.
1140880	1144440	We're having a chill, the rainy day outside.
1144440	1146200	I might feel a little bit of thunder.
1149960	1151000	I'm in a good mood.
1159760	1160760	He he he.
1163200	1164920	Put my headphones on.
1171880	1175280	We're compensated with pull on all third-gamer movements.
1177960	1179080	Damn, the game is loud.
1179080	1181320	Okay, where was I? I was in the haunted house.
1182520	1188360	I think I might get new headphones because I wish there was a sort of transparency mode on these.
1189360	1191280	I feel like my ears are blocked when I play.
1191920	1192920	I don't like it.
1196480	1198240	I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.
1199240	1200240	I don't like it.
1203240	1205240	I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.
1206240	1207240	I don't like it.
1207240	1208800	Vampire madam is hot, by the way.
1209800	1211800	Oh, yes, you like vampire madam.
1212200	1213800	I wish to fuck your blood.
1215720	1216600	I said fuck.
1217160	1217760	Fuck.
1218520	1219040	Fuck.
1219840	1220360	Fuck.
1221640	1222480	V-sucky.
1223320	1223840	Whoa!
1224720	1225760	Focus on noise.
1226280	1228400	Alright, I remember what I was doing.
1231360	1232600	Okay, I'm here now.
1237240	1238520	Why am I so high up?
1239040	1240600	Can I like be a little bit lower?
1243720	1244920	Okay, none of these doors.
1245400	1247240	Okay, well, it seems like I go through here.
1249560	1250840	Nice.
1251840	1254600	Shower, no mirrors, because I'm a vampire.
1257760	1259160	I swear I'm already getting motion sick.
1260360	1260880	Digit.
1262800	1264880	I walked over to this and just shut off. Okay.
1268240	1270000	Uh, um...
1271560	1273840	Can you please give me time to react to things?
1274240	1275640	Oh my god, look at all the cobwebs.
1276680	1278400	Oh, she was waiting for me.
1279040	1280440	Ah, ow!
1281560	1282720	Fucking, no!
1283040	1283560	Damn it.
1284440	1285560	I can't dodge stuff.
1286000	1287800	Okay, I'm just gonna follow the lady.
1289800	1291000	Lady, come back!
1291480	1292000	Oh.
1292880	1294000	Okay, do I go in here?
1298240	1300480	Nope, nope, nothing in there either.
1301200	1303240	How do I reset the camera?
1306760	1309760	Because I feel like I'm like flying above her.
1314400	1316400	Camera, what?
1328240	1329840	Fit fine, okay, whatever.
1330440	1333760	I meant, mouse, oh my, oh, maybe.
1339480	1340880	Do it a little bit less.
1344640	1346160	What does mouse filter mean?
1352680	1354840	Lady, come back, you can blame it all on Sheepie.
1355320	1358520	Oh my god, this is a wraith whipping things that are in her rage.
1358800	1359680	No!
1362120	1363800	Well, if I can't go that way.
1371560	1373680	Um, I presume I...
1376480	1377000	Yo!
1377320	1378840	Oh, damn, I am...
1380120	1381360	I almost said I'm...
1382600	1383560	I'm acoustic.
1384040	1385480	That doesn't make any sense.
1390000	1391280	Oh, is it on fire?
1391480	1392480	That makes sense.
1393040	1394760	It's very sparkly, it's kind of pretty.
1394760	1396160	I like the purple flames.
1396880	1400280	Purple flames, purple flames.
1400280	1401680	Is there something that I should be doing here?
1402640	1403240	It's in here.
1405320	1406920	Not this fucking music.
1409040	1410640	Oh no!
1411600	1413760	Oh god, I can definitely jump over this.
1416360	1416880	Oh!
1428760	1429800	What the fuck?
1434120	1436200	Are you serious?
1436800	1438800	I didn't think you would kill me!
1441600	1445200	It didn't even give me, like, any warning.
1451360	1454920	Oh my god, I'm already like a third of my health is gone.
1460160	1461720	Um, which way was it?
1462240	1462920	This way?
1462920	1463720	No, this way.
1466200	1467200	No, this way.
1471200	1473680	Okay, it doesn't matter.
1473680	1474880	We're back where we were.
1474880	1476720	This game is very forgiving for...
1478440	1481440	Okay, don't touch the fucking purple fire.
1481800	1483000	Shibi, how about that?
1484280	1484920	All right.
1489200	1489960	Is that going to hurt me?
1490080	1490560	Ow.
1491240	1492040	Jesus.
1492600	1494400	This house is trying to kill me.
1494400	1495520	Okay, don't walk into that.
1496400	1496960	Ah!
1498320	1498640	Should I?
1498640	1499440	I'm going to save.
1502880	1504320	Because I feel like I'm going to die.
1507600	1508160	Can I?
1508160	1509320	Can I help myself?
1509320	1509800	Can I?
1515440	1516400	What the hell?
1517520	1518840	That bed is floating.
1523520	1524520	Excuse me?
1527080	1528520	Why is it in French?
1529000	1529480	Ooh.
1531280	1531960	It's the pen that...
1531960	1532280	Oh.
1534360	1535320	That bed is floating.
1537840	1538360	Can I?
1538640	1539560	How do I get down?
1541840	1544280	Ooh, is a pretty boat in the distance.
1544280	1545320	Do I just jump down?
1545320	1546520	Am I going to kill myself?
1549120	1551840	All right, time to go see Therese.
1552640	1555200	Can this door open any fucking slower?
1558760	1559720	Lovely.
1560760	1561400	Whoa!
1563400	1564840	Oh, I'm fine.
1566440	1567400	It's okay.
1568240	1569440	I survived that.
1569440	1570200	Where the f...
1571640	1573440	Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
1582320	1583520	Can I jump?
1585760	1587160	Okay, there's fire there.
1587160	1588080	So that's not it.
1588080	1588880	Oh, here we go.
1589880	1590320	There we go.
1590320	1590720	Whoa.
1591840	1593960	Thank you very much.
1594840	1599440	Um, I think I can like kill the guy ghost.
1599680	1601120	Whoa, I just thought it was weird.
1602680	1604520	I feel like I'm missing something in here.
1609320	1610000	All right.
1610000	1610480	Um.
1612200	1613000	Later.
1614240	1616040	Wait, I feel like there's a way to like...
1618080	1618520	Isn't...
1618520	1623360	I feel like there's something I have to do to like release the spirits
1624680	1628240	from the bad stuff or maybe it's just giving the pendant.
1634960	1636520	This is the hotel branch location.
1642120	1643280	In the basement, you said?
1645840	1646440	Hmm.
1649440	1650000	Hold on.
1656320	1657360	Journal.
1667280	1669680	What do I do with the fucking thing?
1672840	1674240	How do I release her?
1675040	1676240	How do I release?
1679040	1680120	I'm looking this up.
1680120	1682440	I don't want no ghost to be left behind.
1686440	1693440	How to release ghost vampire the Magrae Bubwim.
1701840	1702440	Hmm.
1721040	1721640	Oh, okay.
1721640	1722240	That's right.
1732640	1734640	I I've played the game before.
1734640	1736640	I just couldn't remember how to do it.
1744040	1744440	All right.
1744440	1746440	Let's let's bounce as well as popsicle stand.
1752040	1753840	No ghost left behind exactly.
1762840	1764840	Wait, isn't this thing supposed to attack me?
1766840	1767840	I didn't do it.
1773840	1774440	Ooh.
1776840	1779840	Oh, wait, I think when you go in here, that's when it attacks you.
1779840	1780440	What's in here?
1781840	1782840	Nothing I can use.
1783840	1785840	It's a giant ass protractor.
1788840	1789440	Oh.
1791840	1792840	It didn't attack me.
1797840	1799040	Soundtrack is bomb.
1799440	1800840	Please let me get out of this hole.
1801640	1804840	Or last time I played this, I got stuck in the hole and I had to restart.
1806840	1807640	Kitchen has a journal.
1807640	1808840	No, yeah, I already grabbed the journal.
1808840	1831840	All right, time to go back and talk to my beloved Therese and my beloved Jeanette a.k.a. Azula.
1831840	1833840	I don't know how to get back up.
1833840	1835840	So I think it's going to go anywhere.
1838840	1840840	Secret bobcat boss fight.
1842840	1844840	I love how I creep.
1846840	1847840	I'm sorry.
1849840	1850840	All right, let me.
1851840	1852840	What the hell?
1852840	1853840	Oh, what the?

1926840	1928840	I've never even noticed that before.
1928840	1930840	Boomi, what are you doing?
1930840	1932840	Boomi, no.
1934840	1936840	Oh my God, dude, what the heck?
1936840	1938840	I'll break it over.
1938840	1939840	It's just a bug.
1941840	1942840	Don't even see it.
1942840	1945840	I need the soundtrack for this.
1945840	1947840	Female, I'll scream.
1953840	1955840	Okay, can I leave?

2271640	2273880	No, please, calm down
2276880	2285880	She's a successful one. Well, it's not fair. I'm not a fool. This club's success is just as much my doing as it is hers.
2285880	2290880	I understand, but I still can't give it to you, baby girl.
2290880	2296880	Do you understand what it's like to have your own flesh and blood ripping you apart on a daily basis for two lifetimes?
2296880	2299880	Can you?
2299880	2304880	I'm sorry to hear that, Jeanette, but I really need to give it to Therese.
2305880	2318880	Hmm, since you're so willing to rave that big spooky place for my darling sister, how about doing a teeny tiny favor for little trouble?
2318880	2325880	Hmm, what would put a smile on that cute, beautiful Harley Quinn-esque face?
2325880	2330880	Do you know Galerie Noir down the street? I happen to know there's a charity event being organized there.

3481080	3485080	It tongue gets word that I threatened Jeanette, which he most certainly already has
3485640	3487640	It's not likely he'll believe me
3487880	3493880	So in order to call off the feud you're going to have to convince Jeanette to forgive you just want to kiss her dead mouth
