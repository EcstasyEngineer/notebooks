You

13
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Your left ear

14
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it buzzing like before

15
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is it a buzz or is it or is it the AC?

16
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, good

17
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because I'm like that squishmallow is far away. I don't know

18
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Alright, so you hear my AC from time to time

19
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, this spyware squishmallow

20
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm gonna give some time for people to come in and chat with you guys

21
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah

22
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I feel like I'm still too quiet though, even when I talk real close to the microphone

23
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't want it to be too loud though

24
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The kitties are quite fine

25
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They're doing very very very well

26
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Maybe it was actually by my feet right now I moved her bed so she could be close to me

27
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is that too loud or is that just right

28
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay

29
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It sounds bad

30
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Choppy

31
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It was reverb

32
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't know why

33
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There's echo

34
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You hear an echo

35
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000

36
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I still have the echo on

37
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, I was still on the church settings whoa

38
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think that's why

39
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh my

40
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I forgot about the church settings

41
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I suppose the church did make everything quieter

42
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I

43
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000

44
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000

47
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000

48
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000

Those ears I'm a bunny girl. That's different from being a furry if I was a furry

61
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'd be completely anthropomorphic like the bunny girl from Zootopia

62
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000

People like usually when we all realize that we all have ASMR that day

106
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,660
We'd like I was gonna do like Hades instead, but then I saw it in the

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,240
Because yeah, I think and I think I see got the idea too because I saw that strong it ASMR so I'm like

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I

182
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,800
You're making sure that you're sitting up straight when you're out of your desk at work

183
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,480
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was so tender for you right there. Let me go in a different spot

184
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,680
You have to make sure that you sit up straight at work sweetheart. This isn't good for you to slouch

185
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,200
It's probably causing you to make you feel even worse than you already are

186
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:35,640
How does that feel? Does that feel better?

187
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:53,320
Let me try on the other side

188
00:26:53,320 --> 00:27:13,440
Looks like you have a knot right here

189
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:24,560
You think I poisoned you? Only with my love. It's so good

190
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:52,120
Yes, I love you so so much. The lunch that I made for you this morning

191
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,440
I secretly put something in it so you would get sick and come home and spend time with me

192
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,440
I'm kidding. That would never hurt you

193
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:21,440
You think I'm crazy or something? Yeah, I'm crazy about you but I wouldn't do that to you sweetheart

194
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:55,440
I think I would choose to go for a couple of knots from your back. Does that make you feel a little bit better?

195
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Just a little bit

196
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Okay, turn around so I can give you a smooch

197
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Now I got your face in my hands and I'm gonna smooch you better

198
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Okay, let me take your temperature

199
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,440
I have the thermometer right here

200
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Let's see what your temperature is

201
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Alright, it's saying you have a fever

202
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Oh no, my goodness

203
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Well, I kissed you on the cheek. I didn't kiss you on the mouth

204
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,440
What to do? What to do? It seems like you have a fever

205
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,440
You might have the flu if you're feeling nauseous

206
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Why don't you lay back on the bed?

207
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:24,440
My cat was scratching the cat scratcher

208
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:32,440
I'll make a compress for you, okay? And I'll give you some medicine

209
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Okay, I'll be right back. Want to go get that for you?

210
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Okay, I'm back sweetie

211
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:34,440
The compress

212
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:46,440
I'm just gonna lay it like this

213
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:54,440
You're not her bird, sweetie

214
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:02,440
I'm only doing what you would do for me

215
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:16,440
Let me get this side

216
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,440
I'm gonna kind of sweat a little

217
00:33:46,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Is it cool when you turn around a little bit?

218
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Okay

219
00:34:32,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Okay

220
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:10,440
Don't worry

221
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I still love you even with your messy hair

222
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Okay

223
00:35:48,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Okay

224
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,440
I think I look cute today, thank you

225
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Alright, let me comb your hair, oh just so it's not all in your face

226
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Let me wiggle behind you real quick

227
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:34,440
Surprise kiss

228
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:46,440
What if I tickle you?

229
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,440
What did I do with the brush?

230
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,440
There it is

231
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:06,440
I got this brand new brush

232
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Sounds quite nice, doesn't it?

233
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,440
And I haven't even started brushing your hair yet

234
00:37:50,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Probably gonna feel wonderful on you

235
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Alright, let me brush your hair

236
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:26,440
On your face

237
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,440
You can always rely on me

238
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Take care of you

239
00:38:48,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Let me get right over

240
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Surprise kiss

241
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Sorry, Reina's singing the song over people

242
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Reina

243
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,440
If you're new here, Reina is one of my three cats

244
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,440
I'll wear three cats, my love

245
00:39:46,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Maybe I'll get Reina over here and give you guys some purrs

246
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Hi Reina

247
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,440
Have you come to check on Howard to see if they're doing okay?

248
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Did you want to get some purrs, Reina?

249
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Did you want to go home and see the cat purrs?

250
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Everybody knows you got the best healing purrs, Reina

251
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Come here, come here

252
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Reina

253
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,440
You're thinking about it

254
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Take care of your cat

255
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,440
There we go

256
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Time for some healing purrs

257
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Reina

258
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Reina came to see you to make sure you're okay

259
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Let's get some purrs on the other side

260
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Reina

261
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Reina

262
00:42:50,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Reina

263
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,440
Thank you Reina

264
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Thank you for your healing purrs, Miss Reina

265
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:32,440
Everybody's saying thank you to Reina

266
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:44,440
I'm going to finish brushing your hair

267
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,440
It's always good to get some kitty purrs when you're sick

268
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
They have healing frequencies

269
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,440
They purr the same frequency as your bones healing

270
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Let's get back together, did you know that?

271
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,440
This is more crazy

272
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Reina

273
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:48,440
Reina

274
00:44:48,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Reina

275
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,440
I smell good because I shower today

276
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:18,440
I wash with the lush intergalactic soap

277
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:34,440
It has sparkles in it so my skin is sparkly

278
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,440
It's just like a vampire

279
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,440
I'm going to suck your blood

280
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Surprise kiss

281
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,440
Over here

282
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,440
I think your hair is fixed

283
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:26,440
I hope that makes you feel a little bit better

284
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
What do you think you need?

285
00:46:44,440 --> 00:47:00,440
Do you need me to get you anything in particular?

286
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,440
I like snuggling with you

287
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,440
You want chicken soup and ginger ale?

288
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,440
Water and hugs?

289
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:20,440
I'll get you anything you want

290
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Want to be the small spoon?

291
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,440
I'll let you be the small spoon

292
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:38,440
I just want you to feel better

293
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:18,440
You two being silly?

294
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,440
Sorry

295
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,440
My internet seems fine so it must be you too

296
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Sorry

297
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:42,440
What would you want?

298
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,440
How about we hydrate you?

299
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,440
I think you need to be hydrated

300
00:48:48,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Being hydrated is very important

301
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,440
Let me get you a ginger ale

302
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:40,440
Do you want a ginger ale?

303
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:48,440
Okay

304
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,440
I got the ginger ale

305
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,440
Extra spicy just for you

306
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:04,440
Extra gingery just for you

307
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Swaps

308
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,440
Swaps

309
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Swaps

310
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,440
I actually have something spicy

311
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,440
I'm really sick to burn it out here

312
00:50:52,440 --> 00:51:08,440
Swaps

313
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,440
Trying to move

314
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:20,440
That was a 3D or something

315
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Swaps

316
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:44,440
Was that loud?

317
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:58,440
Hear that fiddle?

318
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:08,440
Hear the sizzle of the ginger ale?

319
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Swaps

320
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:28,440
Swaps

321
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:44,440
Swaps

322
00:52:44,440 --> 00:53:10,440
This ginger ale is extra sizzly

323
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:20,440
Bird feed you the ginger ale?

324
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:38,440
Swaps

325
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:48,440
Swaps

326
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Swaps

327
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,440
Are you going to drink it or what? You've just been listening to it sizzle

328
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:10,440
You can taste the sizzle

329
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:26,440
Ready? Open your mouth

330
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,440
Very good

331
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,440
I'll give you a break

332
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:38,440
I don't want you choking on this

333
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:50,440
After this I'll prepare you a very special soup

334
00:54:50,440 --> 00:55:04,440
Are you ready?

335
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:20,440
What's in the soup? It's a secret

336
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Swaps

337
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:40,440
Swaps

338
00:55:40,440 --> 00:56:08,440
Swaps

339
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:24,440
I think it's time to prepare the soup

340
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,440
Don't you leave and get up

341
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,440
I said I'll make the soup

342
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:46,440
I have lots of ingredients to add

343
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:58,440
I have my big wooden spoon

344
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:10,440
No no no I don't need any help

345
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:32,440
You just lay down and I'll take care of it

346
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:40,440
And I have my wood bowl

347
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:54,440
Swaps

348
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:10,440
Swaps

349
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:26,440
Swaps

350
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:42,440
Swaps

351
00:58:42,440 --> 00:59:02,440
Swaps

352
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Swaps

353
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:40,440
Swaps

354
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:58,440
Swaps

355
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:08,440
Swaps

356
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:30,440
What kind of soup?

357
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,440
Special soup

358
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,440
It's time to make the soup

359
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:46,440
Let me just put in some spices

360
01:00:46,440 --> 01:01:06,440
Some liquid spices

361
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:12,440
It's very new

362
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:32,440
I hope the ingredients aren't too loud when I put them in

363
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,440
They smell good

364
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:48,440
I should probably pour in the broth first

365

373
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:18,440
Time to pour in the ingredients

374
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:40,440
Out of the way

375
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:58,440

566
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:32,440
I just want you to fall asleep listening to my heartbeat.

567
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:34,440
I hope you feel better soon.

568
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:48,440
I don't want you to be sick for so long.

569
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:52,440
I care about you a lot.

570
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:58,440
And I know you take care of me this way.

571
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:02,440
If I was sick.

572
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:08,440
So of course I'm going to take care of you.

573
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:14,440
I just want you to fall asleep listening to my heartbeat.

574
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:24,440
And make sure you feel quickly enough.

575
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:34,440
Thanks for watching!

576
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:44,440
Thanks for watching!

577
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:54,440

582
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:46,440
I hope you guys had a nice night today.

583
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:52,440
I'm going to introduce you.

584
01:43:52,440 --> 01:44:02,440
Mine is not far in the backhand.

585
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:12,440
And I'm just going to be talking a little bit.

586
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:42,440
I think I might ask for an editor.

587
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:52,440
I'm going to be talking about ASMR videos.

588
01:44:52,440 --> 01:45:02,440
So I'm going to go a little bit more.

589
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:12,440
I think I'm going to do most of the dialogue.

590
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:18,440
And it could boost the volume too.

591
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:22,440
I could do that.

592
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:32,440
I got it.

593
01:45:52,440 --> 01:46:02,440
