1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
It's weird being in voice chat and not being allowed to spell all the secrets of what I've got planned.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,040
Oh no, it's starting!

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,760
It's starting!

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,560
It's starting!

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,920
Here, here.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,320
Oh, so excited.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,840
Did it just pause? It says three.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,440
Yeah, it's supposed to.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,400
Uh-oh.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh no!

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,160
Oh, oh, okay.

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, wait.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,040
Technical difficulties, it's fine lives, it's fine, Luna.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,160
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,000
They're so cute, I can't.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,160
Wait, I'm gonna unmute.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,080
I just realized I've not got desktop audio in their split, so I can't hear the streaming you guys can.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,160
How did you guys split the audio?

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
I've got you guys captured via desktop.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,640
Oh, you have to, you have to make, um, what's it called?

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,000
A split.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,360
Yeah, you guys split in OBS so you can do it.

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,240
Yeah, that's what I did.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
I have two tips.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
I have my headset and my IEMs right now.

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,640
Oh no.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,440
I hear them.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,200
I've bowled this watch a long time ago, that's all I can say so far.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,960
I'll mute it once they finish their intro.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,960
Oh.

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,000
Hello.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,280
Gushy.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
Gushy.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,280
Right.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Gushy.

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,440
Gishy, Gishy.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm like, I got two things she could gush on right here.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,440
Oh, everyone says it's very sweet.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,800
They helped with the watch along.

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,480
I know they're helping them with a big concert.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,760
Yeah.

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,640
Hey, man, you scratch our back, we scratch yours.

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
That's how we do it from around these parts.

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
Mimosa's a good singer.

45
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,360
Yeah.

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,240
Dude, Mimosa's so talented.

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,800
She is.

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
I actually got them lungs on her just hiding.

49
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,120
You wouldn't realize.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
Don't be fooled by the outfit.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
There's lungs under this.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,160
I know.

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
Damn.

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
Her model's so bouncy.

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,040
It is.

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,760
I love that.

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,880
I love the way eyelashes.

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,320
I know it's not a V-tube or mainstream, but I know.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,080
I was just like strawberries.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
I want to eat them.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
The flowers in her ears.

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,480
I just let's.

63
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,880
It's a different place.

64
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,840
So nice.

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,880
Oh, the breadsticks in chat.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,160
Oh.

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,120
I like her custom mic.

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,600
I didn't even notice.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,440
Oh, it's really cool.

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,960
God, I was talking about customized assets today,

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,800
and I was like, I never got girls anything.

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,160
It was OK.

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,920
I was just like, that was, it sounds terrible.

74
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
I was like, if I'm not going to use it,

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm not giving it to them.

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,680
Because I showed my end in screen for like the first time

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
and literally since debut, I showed my end in screen

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
and everyone was laughing.

79
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,800
Why do you hate the ending screen so much?

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,080
I just ends.

81
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,280
She just leaves.

82
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,560
I don't like heart screams.

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
Literally, if you open up one of my boards,

84
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,520
I'm just like, I don't know.

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
I literally spent so much money on it.

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,440
I just never use the thing.

87
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
I've never even seen the stingers.

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
I never even used stingers on debut.

89
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
That's so much I hate them as well.

90
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,880
So I'm showing them the debut.

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
God, this is fantastic.

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,440
This is beyond my expectations.

93
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,840
Mom, this is amazing.

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
She's like an amazing, amazing singer.

95
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
Multi, multi, multi-talented.

96
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Extremely.

97
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,520
Things, streams.

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,760
Freaking makes all her own charts as well.

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,120
Thumbnails.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,480
You name it.

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,960
She does it.

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
She does them all.

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
You didn't know she sings.

104
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
Well, I'm supposed to keep up with everyone's talents

105
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,200
and the VTuber roster that I'm not aware of.

106
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
That's what I thought we'd be from.

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,560
You're not constantly stalking when most is channeling me.

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
Well, that's why I'm supposed to know absolutely everything

109
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
about every other VTuber that's been kind enough

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
to interact with me.

111
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,800
That's right.

112
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,240
You're done for a reason bend over.

113
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,840
Prepare yourself.

114
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,200
What was it?

115
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,680
Tyler.

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,240
Hello, everybody.

117
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,880
Hi, Harold.

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Something is in my eye.

119
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,800
My eye.

120
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
Well, we have a peak refunds.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,960
So I'm surfing the teeth.

122
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
Anyone can hear that?

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,360
No, I don't.

124
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,000
OK.

125
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,400
Meru!

126
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
freak A1 your custom microphone.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Oh, my gosh.

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,200
Oh, she's insane.

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Oh my god, duet!

130
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,440
Oh my god, how long is this concert?

131
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,640
That is like some built-in and pre-pro-new-

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm like generally so impressed with the most of his voice in Burroughs.

133
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Me too!

134
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I wish I could speak Japanese!

135
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Imagine us up there.

136
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Konichiwawa.

137
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Konichiwawa.

138
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Konichiwawa.

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I forget singing in English.

140
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I can even imagine singing in a different language.

141
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Exactly.

142
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I think we got to get some Japanese speakers for Gen 2, mommy.

143
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
We're being influenced live.

144
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
You heard it here, folks.

145
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,720
I saw what you tweeted, Chibi.

146
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't think I didn't see it.

147
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,720
She went on Twitter and she tweeted a sling girl.

148
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Aw, don't look at me.

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
I'm not doing nothing.

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
I freaking saw it.

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
I'm just slowly just putting it into your mind.

152
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I will get you a Halloween variation outfit of you as a sling girl.

153
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Absolutely.

154
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Yeah?

155
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
All yours.

156
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,720
I'm not having an actual sling girl.

157
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
All yours.

158
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah!

159
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
I'm giving the sling girl!

160
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Yes.

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
All right.

162
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I'll settle.

163
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I'll settle for that.

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm the sling girl.

165
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
We've defeated the sling allegation.

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Yeah!

167
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I'm so...

168
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm trying not to scream.

169
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm trying to focus on the thing because I'm about to get real giddy.

170
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Things are jiggling on screen.

171
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I don't know if what you guys are looking at, but things are jiggling to me.

172
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Two things are jiggling.

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Slime bunny girl, like from Queen's Blade, precisely.

174
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,720
A cotton bum family member is going to be the slime girl.

175
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,720
I'll have to think about that.

176
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Sublime.

177
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
She's slimy.

178
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
What are you doing?

179
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Shebeth the Slime.

180
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Shebeth the Slime.

181
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Oh my god.

182
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Look at her little freaking...

183
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Look at her little pony tails, Bob.

184
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Yaeli.

185
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Yaeli fish ribbons as well, like the translucent.

186
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Such a good design.

187
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Unfortunately, it's my turn to sing.

188
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Hold on.

189
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Let me get my pen lights out.

190
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
No!

191
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,720
No eye moner.

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Should we get eye trackers?

193
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I'll do that.

194
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,720
I'll give every girl an eye tracker and we'll watch the most devious videos and stuff.

195
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:08,720
And then we'll see who's got like 93% pervert rate.

196
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Why is Mamosa so good?

197
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Mamosa, why is Mero so good?

198
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Did they die?

199
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Oh, discord crashed.

200
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Sorry, I died.

201
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm asking Mero if she wants to go up on stage because she's watching this.

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I think her makes fucking dying.

203
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Yeah, we can't really hear you.

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Azura, are you alive?

205
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm fine.

206
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm fine.

207
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
I'll take that.

208
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
She's so excited.

209
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
She's so, so excited to get on stage.

210
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
She just ran away.

211
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,720
She's like at the thought, at the concert.

212
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Let me get two pen lights out.

213
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I don't have different colors.

214
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
I only have blue.

215
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,720
I have so many questions for them about how long this took.

216
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
This is insane.

217
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I know.

218
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,720
They should just like take the soundtracks here and just post them as song covers too.

219
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Honestly, that's a smart idea.

220
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
I think they should.

221
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I think they will.

222
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
You think they will?

223
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
I hope so.

224
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Because it's really good.

225
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
They shouldn't just leave it here on the stream.

226
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I want full song covers.

227
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Let us hear your lungs.

228
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
This tiny jellyfish got lungs on her too.

229
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
God dang.

230
00:10:48,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Azura is singing along to it.

231
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
I think that's why she's muted.

232
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Damn.

233
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:14,720
That's where you're not beating the weave allegations.

234
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,720
This concert is epic.

235
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Literally.

236
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
I had no idea what to expect.

237
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,720
I've never actually sat through it.

238
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,720
This is so cool.

239
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Uncle, give us another mate.

240
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,720
I don't know why this creature is dying for me.

241
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
It's hard to know.

242
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm just so surprised at the stage.

243
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,720
All the assets.

244
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,720
The light show.

245
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
It's really pretty.

246
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Mara is so cute.

247
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,720
She is.

248
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,720
This is so cool.

249
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,720
She has her tentacles bounce.

250
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Is Azura's mute at the audio?

251
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
She's going to get coffee.

252
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,720
I mean.

253
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,720
The reminder not to play the audio of the stream.

254
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
On stream.

255
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Question of those headlights being held up by my arms.

256
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Oh, this goes hard.

257
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Got a different vibe.

258
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,720
If I'm he started singing in Japanese, I would have absolutely lost my mind.

259
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Wait, is she about to?

260
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I think this is an English cover.

261
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,720
If you guys had to sing a song for a concert, what would you sing?

262
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
That's my question.

263
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,720
I would rap something ridiculous.

264
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:25,720
ABC's.

265
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Sing five bars, five seconds.

266
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Two in your mom live edition.

267
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Why does this court keep shitting the bed?

268
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Lincoln Park calling you.

269
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
There you go.

270
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
I streamed a fish.

271
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
I probably do American.

272
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I like green.

273
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Okay.

274
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
I may go off.

275
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Hit him.

276
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Hit him.

277
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Hit him.

278
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Hit him.

279
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Hey, don't hurt him now.

280
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Kill him.

281
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:30,720
That's so cool.

282
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Oh, no, she's hot.

283
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,720
I just set the ambiance.

284
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Feel that music.

285
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Feel them tunes.

286
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I saw it.

287
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
I saw it.

288
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Execute me.

289
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I me.

290
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I don't know if you guys have ever played Alice Madness Returns, but when you get low health,

291
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,720
you enter a state of hysteria and you unlock a different version like to your look.

292
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,720
And this I me is like completely making me want to play Alice Madness Returns right now.

293
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
That's a great game.

294
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
I've heard of that game.

295
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
I want to play it too.

296
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh, I recommend.

297
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
I me darkness way.

298
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah.

299
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
I me darkness dementia way.

300
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Just like my immortal.

301
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,720
I love her mic too.

302
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
All the song choices are really good too.

303
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
They're all catchy.

304
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm in.

305
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Oh, shit.

306
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Execution.

307
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm too more to add them to the rest.

308
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Three.

309
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Whoa.

310
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,720
They're all singing together.

311
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Are there songs that support this?

312
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
What is it?

313
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Oh, wait.

314
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
This is crazy.

315
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:44,720
It's not just like one solo song or do it.

316
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Let's go.

317
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Oh my gosh.

318
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Okay.

319
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Oh my gosh.

320
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
YouTube does need anime emotes.

321
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Someone's using a pickle instead of the baguettes.

322
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Put your pickle away.

323
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I love Amara bounces her little tentacle ponytails.

324
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Yay.

325
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
I must have taken so much work to practice.

326
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I have so many questions for them after this.

327
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Like, holy crap.

328
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I'm not singing in Japanese.

330
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
No, I'm not going to ask you to.

331
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Holy crap.

332
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I would never ask you to sing in another language.

333
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Japanese fans would hate me because I would just butcher everything.

334
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Because I would not be able to.

335
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
This is so beautiful and amazing.

336
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm sorry, but.

337
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
I should have said sorry.

338
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,720
I'll do Megan the stallion song.

339
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,720
What does she want?

340
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I didn't hear that new one from Megan the stallion.

341
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,720
I forgot the name of the faking song.

342
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I already forgot the name of the song too.

343
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
I was listening to it this morning.

344
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
It's your time up.

345
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I need some Japanese songs to sing.

346
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Japanese?

347
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
That's okay.

348
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,720
I'll sing that part of it.

349
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
What's up?

350
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
It happens by own words.

351
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
And the birds and the eagles.

352
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
I will sing that version.

353
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Some of the uptails on it that aren't real words.

354
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I just want to smush her little face.

355
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,720
She gives me cute aggression.

356
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I have seen the Japanese version of Doja Cat say so.

357
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
It is very good.

358
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,720
It's very cute.

359
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
I'm making the Scottish version and getting a million views.

360
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
You should.

361
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,720
In the moment, I want to say so.

362
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I love this song.

363
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I just got shivers.

364
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Her voice is so clear.

365
00:19:46,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I'm getting shivers from her singing.

366
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
If you guys want to do song collabs,

367
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,720
I can set the other VTubers for you.

368
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,720
That would be fun.

369
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I love this song.

370
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Do you want to sing magnet with me?

371
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Vocaloid magnet?

372
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
I don't know what that is.

373
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Am I aging myself right now?

374
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,720
No.

375
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Let me look it up.

376
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Maybe I'm forgetting the name.

377
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Miku.

378
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
And forbidden lovers.

379
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
I've never heard this one.

380
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
No.

381
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
You've never heard magnet?

382
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
No.

383
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,720
It's from Chibi Collab.

384
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Jason.

385
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Do you want to do magnet with me?

386
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
You're asking the wrong one.

387
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,720
You were singing a

388
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Ed Sheeran's thing of the whole bit.

389
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
My voice is so broken.

390
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,720
We have mixers.

391
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
We'll do a recorded concert.

392
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,720
I'm just a me.

393
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
You did not even sound like that.

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Come off it.

395
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Come off it now.

396
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,720
There you use these

397
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,720
terminologies again.

398
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,720
I'll make a comment.

399
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I'll be very interested to see

400
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
how your accent would develop.

401
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Chibi had never done it before until

402
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,720
debut.

403
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Then we did the debut mock and she goes

404
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Arise.

405
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Where did this come from?

406
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,720
I was studying.

407
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:11,720
I was, I was, uh, holding my inner Scott since I'm Scottish myself and my mom's side and my mom's side.

408
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Oh, you're more hen. I probably can or then.

409
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,720
I didn't. Yeah, my great-grandmother immigrated from Scotland. I didn't even know that.

410
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,720
That's so cool. I'm here for it.

411
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Oh, she got her love eyes on. She got her love eyes on.

412
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Hell yeah. Go little joke. Go little joke. Go little joke. Go.

413
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,720
My jokes.

414
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
The song is really good.

415
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Maybe like the song.

416
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Is this where I see it in me that her song's being mixed right now?

417
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Oh, it's, that's Fortnite Battle Pass.

418
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,720
You're doing Fortnite Battle Pass as a,

419
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,720
I don't even know what to tell them what the plan was.

420
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Go ahead.

421
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,720
So I really like Amy's voice and I wanted her to make a meme song cover.

422
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,720
And the one song I really wanted her to cover is the song that's Fortnite Metal Pass.

423
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:29,720
That'll go viral. I'll tell you that right now. This is my prediction.

424
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,720
She was alive while she was away on holiday, but unfortunately we were having a lot of delay issues just everywhere.

425
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,720
But she drew her own artwork for it. I'm getting it animated and then it's been turned into a little cute video,

426
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
but it's less than a minute long, so I'm going to get it into...

427
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
They're together!

428
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Sorry.

429
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Because she cut herself off.

430
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Yeah, Rhea!

431
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
We stan Vocaloid. Shadow Wizard Money Gang.

432
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
We love Vocaloid.

433
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Oh my God, Rain's voice is so mummy.

434
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,720
I love that Rain has like a slight valley accent.

435
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Does she?

436
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Yeah.

437
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I didn't notice.

438
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
It's very, very slight.

439
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
It fits her model so well though.

440
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
It does.

441
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
I actually just wanted to really...

442
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Did these were jumping?

443
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Sorry, I'm a child. I'm an absolute child.

444
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Forgive me.

445
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Forgive me.

446
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Veiler Fortnite skins? Absolutely not.

447
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Could you imagine?

448
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:43,720
It was like cash money flow emo on someone after you kill them and it's just Emmys fans.

449
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,720
She's in her jays like dancing over the cars with someone because she got first place.

450
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Oh my God.

451
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Oh, I would do an Arata Shigako song.

452
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I really like Tokyo Calling because it's about...

453
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
You're going to say Tokyo Drift.

454
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,720
No, no, no. It's called Tokyo Calling and it's about how dystopian your life can become

455
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,720
if you don't kind of find the meaning of it or that's what I took away from it and it's like...

456
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,720
One of the lines that really resonates me is like...

457
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,720
They're singing magnet? Are they?

458
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Shut up.

459
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I'm going to lose it.

460
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,720
They are singing magnet. Oh my God, I'm literally going to cry.

461
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,720
This is one of my favorite Vocaloid songs.

462
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Oh my God, actually.

463
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm geeking out. I'm geeking.

464
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Riefland's almost... I was actually...

465
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Hatsune Miku was my entrance into the anime world to say the things. I said what I said.

466
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Are they going to do the Japanese or the English version?

467
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
That's my question.

468
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
The world?

469
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Oh, they're doing the Japanese.

470
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duaa duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu hello.

471
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Creaming your jarts.

472
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
They were creamed long ago. Thank you.

473
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Reia's voice.

474
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,720
I love Reia's singing voice. Oh my God.

475
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
She sounds so like...

476
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,720
It's a little bit more mature. It's so clear and smooth.

477
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I think almost ethereal. You know that?

478
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Yeah, absolutely. Every time she opens, she sings, it gives me servers.

479
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:51,200
servers. Oh, this takes me back.

480
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:23,200
I'm so happy right now. I like

481
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,560
Rains Mike. Mom, can we get

482
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,560
mics? Okay, get makes. Actually,

483
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
this is insider knowledge. You

484
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,320
guys aren't supposed to know

485
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
this, but you can't keep a secret

486
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,600
for the life of you. I started

487
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,000
it. I was like, oh, everyone

488
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,960
else can know that's listening

489
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,400
into a I haven't met any of the

490
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
girls in August and they can

491
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,000
have we are going to discuss

492
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,240
alternative outfits. Well, I

493
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,320
already know I'm getting slime.

494
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,520
Well, that's for Halloween. But

495
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,800
like Halloween. Oh, shit. I'm

496
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
under way. Oh, God. Well, you

497
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,320
just said we're gonna be for

498
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,480
Halloween. She forgot what she

499
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,400
said. If we're doing Halloween

500
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,720
costumes, I'm gonna need to fill

501
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,560
some string. If you guys want

502
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,760
Halloween costumes, you must

503
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,680
tell me in the meeting. I want

504
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,560
to be a slamber for Halloween.

505
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,600
I don't know what I'm going to

506
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,360
do for my alternate outfit. I saw

507
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,280
you do that. I think I'm going

508
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,200
to save the idea for 2.0.

509
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,240
Please remember when if you guys

510
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,360
would like to sign on for the

511
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,080
next year, we also offer a free

512
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,360
alternate outfit on the house.

513
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,680
So if you have one idea you like,

514
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,520
but it's not what you go for, we

515
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,720
can probably cover it later.

516
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,040
Thanks, Trani. Again, inside

517
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,200
your knowledge. If you work

518
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,600
under Vealer and sign on for

519
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
the next year, your split goes

520
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,840
up and further 5% in your

521
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,200
favor. Oh my gosh.

522
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,120
Aren't I just pulling them

523
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,760
strings?

524
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,360
My ever self sacrificing

525
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,440
mother. She's shilling.

526
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,120
What do you mean? You don't like

527
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,840
the way that we rain cloud?

528
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,360
Making kills while watching a

529
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,040
concert.

530
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,160
Oh, strongy.

531
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
Make sure she gets so excited.

532
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,920
That's why.

533
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,840
Bro, I literally leak everything.

534
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
I like all of this place.

535
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,480
I don't know because A.C. is

536
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,640
going to be in the meeting about

537
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,840
all of this unfolding.

538
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,280
So when's that meeting supposed

539
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,640
to be?

540
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,080
I'll I don't know August 1st.

541
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
August 1st. I'll just put that

542
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,680
down, pencil. Someday.

543
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,960
What's the August, September,

544
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,880
October? No, I want to.

545
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
Maybe it was just like short

546
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,960
notice. Or maybe she wasn't

547
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,560
feeling good. It's a lot.

548
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,600
It's a lot of practice.

549
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,920
Stress. It is stressful as

550
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,240
well. Yeah. Yeah, get all that

551
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,080
stuff done.

552
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,720
Look at I.B. just bow bobbing

553
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,680
up and down. She's like, yep,

554
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,840
yep, yep, yep, I'm ready.

555
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,120
Of her jacket came comes up

556
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,760
with her.

557
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,920
And she bubbles.

558
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,320
Oh, I love them.

559
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Sorry, I'm a wee sump.

560
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,400
Yeah, we love we stand Kingdom

561
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,360
Hearts in this home.

562
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
This Kingdom Hearts good. I

563
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
never had the opportunity.

564
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,840
I thought the plan for October

565
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,040
was giggle sticks.

566
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,840
No, no, no, I had.

567
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,120
Oh, my God, the script master

568
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,840
got an absolute bolligan and I

569
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,280
got a refund on some stuff.

570
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,920
Yeah, as you should.

571
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,520
I will I'm going to rewrite it

572
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,880
myself. I'm not even going to

573
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,240
hide you.

574
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,360
Well, apparently he might have

575
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,320
already rewrote it.

576
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,120
I've not looked at it, but I

577
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,400
am. I'm I will I'm going to

578
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
take a peek right now.

579
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,040
Yeah, take a peek.

580
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840
He replaced giggle sticks with

581
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,040
a light stick.

582
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, could you imagine?

583
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,840
OK, I stopped meeting in the

584
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,760
script now and it's just like

585
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,480
fucking substitutes instead.

586
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,600
Just rate clock.

587
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,520
What?

588
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,280
It's going on.

589
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,920
Patriot, it's fine.

590
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Honestly, the fucking

591
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960
the disc stick on us.

592
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,200
Nuzzle Fudge.

593
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,720
Awful.

594
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,240
OK, literally just took out all

595
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,160
of the direction.

596
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,280
Oh, is the actual script usable?

597
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,880
He left in cock-suckery.

598
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,200
Cock-suckery.

599
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,960
I mean, if you can overlook that

600
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,640
as a script usable question,

601
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Mark, we're not going to have to

602
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,960
go in and I honestly

603
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,120
have been I have a bad taste in

604
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,960
my mouth, although I'll talk

605
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,400
about this later.

606
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,120
We'll talk about this later.

607
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,160
Concert, concert, concert.

609
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,960
You know, business, business,

610
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,840
business, business, business, business.

611
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
This is a great song, too.

612
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,200
My light stick burns brighter than

613
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
ever.

614
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,560
I got my light sticks here.

615
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Go off by me.

616
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,880
Don't forget to check out the link

617
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,800
in the description, guys, because

618
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,480
I've got all their links on YouTube.

619
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,320
Like, they have worked so hard on

620
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,360
this concert, even a cheeky song.

621
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,240
And I like on the stream right now.

622
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,760
I pinned it in my chat.

623
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,320
Just give it a cheeky, like, let

624
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,560
them know that I fucking enjoyed

625
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,480
this because this is.

626
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,680
Like, I know you could argue, oh,

627
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,880
they're only singing a three minute

628
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,520
song. No, behind the scenes.

629
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,720
Are you kidding me?

630
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,560
There's so much.

631
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
So much stuff.

632
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,680
All while they were streaming as

633
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,160
well in the background, they would

634
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,000
have had to have been streaming and

635
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,600
then, like, do vocal practice, do

636
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
warm-up practice songs, record, get

637
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,080
it sent to a mixer, edits, or, like,

638
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,400
just be good to them, OK?

639
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
Be good to be nice.

640
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,280
Bambigets, yes.

641
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,800
Welcome to Bambigets in the chat.

642
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,840
Let them know the reflins showed up.

643
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,080
I heard the song in such a long

644
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
time.

645
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
I hear them.

646
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Shut up.

647
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,560
That's months of presence.

648
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,800
You can see all the reflins in the

649
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
chat forgetting.

650
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Good reflins.

651
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,120
I see you well.

652
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,600
That's what I like to see.

653
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,920
You all get rewarded.

654
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,760
Yeah, make sure to click on the link

655
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,160
in my chat. Give them a give them a

656
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
like.

657
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,320
So up to their channels, up to the

658
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,840
girls. I have very stuff in my

659
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,000
description and all the other girls

660
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
do too. So.

661
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Is Mercy in here?

662
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Is she?

663
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,520
No, Mercy's not here.

664
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Mercy's by her lone son.

665
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
OK.

666
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,480
She said she would yap too much

667
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
also.

668
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,720
Yeah, because she's like, I'm going

669
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,160
to be real. I'm going to be mad

670
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
annoying.

671
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,320
She's probably like also geeking

672
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
out right now.

673
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,640
It's probably it's like yapping a

674
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
bunch.

675
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,200
My sweet Mercy.

676
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,440
I was going to pretend that rain

677
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,640
was like just tearing up on the

678
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
guitar.

679
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

680
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,400
Shrondi, can you play the

681
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
instruments?

682
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,360
No, I never learned.

683
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
I was athletic.

684
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,320
Oh, what kind of athletics?

685
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,200
And I was called

686
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,080
athletics and swimming as well.

687
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,840
And I'm I running

688
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,400
like athletics and the hurdle

689
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
athletics and anything that has

690
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
to do with their grippers.

691
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,400
I'm not being the grippers.

692
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,240
Someone commented on my feet.

693
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,480
They were like, you have very long

694
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,600
toes. And I'm like, sorry, you

695
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,360
stuffed your toes so much that

696
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,920
they're like fucking nubs.

697
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,440
But I used me.

698
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,560
I have regular toes.

699
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,960
If you didn't know, you're supposed

700
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,400
to be able to walk on them, not like

701
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,560
a little stubbly fucking way.

702
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Like fucking toes.

703
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,120
And she took that personally.

704
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Honestly.

705
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,880
But I'm saying my toes are long.

706
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,720
My toes are normal.

707
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
All together.

708
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Harmony is the melody of the heart.

709
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,760
I can't stop sharing it.

710
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Reigns boobs.

711
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,040
It's when she bounces, we bounce

712
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,640
so like lately, they're like

713
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
in and out.

714
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,200
Oh, my God, that's another trio.

715
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
That's so impressive.

716
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,040
It's so impressive.

717
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,240
It's got the lungs for this.

718
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm I'm tired just thinking

719
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,240
and can say I know what I'm saying.

720
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
I mean.

721
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,160
Oh, don't hurt them.

722
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
No, don't hurt them.

723
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,240
I also have long toes.

724
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Nothing wrong.

725
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,000
You can really grip it with those

726
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,160
long toes. Yeah.

727
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Grip what?

728
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
It.

729
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,080
Group songs are much harder to mix

730
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
together, too.

731
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
I mean, I feel like it's not hard

732
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,480
to mix anything when it comes to

733
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
these girls because they just

734
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,680
naturally sound perfectly.

735
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Oh, yeah.

736
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,280
They're speaking voices, they're

737
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,480
singing voices.

738
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Yeah.

739
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
Stoney can clap real good.

740
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,280
Oh, we flint.

741
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,560
Grip in the grippy stick with my

742
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
grippers.

743
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
OK, no.

744
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,880
I want that as a tramp stamp on

745
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
my model. Thank you.

746
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Nuzlin, the fast, fast one.

747
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
That's with my grippers.

748
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
I don't know.

749
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,480
I wonder what mic she uses,

750
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,640
Raya, because her stuff is so

751
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
clear.

752
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
I know.

753
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,480
Oh, thank you for the gift,

754
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
it boy.

755
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Who that boy?

756
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Who him is?

757
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,760
I'm not OK, Tyler.

758
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Go off.

759
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
No.

760
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm too pasty to see that song.

761
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,720
Are you enjoying it, Zara?

762
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,520
I just heard our giggle.

763
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
I tell you.

764
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Oh, my God.

765
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
This is fantastic.

766
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Imagine this in 3D.

767
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Oh, that would be so good.

768
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
I would be pissing myself.

769
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Same.

770
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
I didn't know how 3D concerts

771
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
work.

772
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
I didn't know you were going to

773
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
ask me for a Mariah about that.

774
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Yeah.

775
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
He didn't say their knowledge.

776
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Come on, lad.

777
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Come on, Reflin's pill or bring

778
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
one, bring one, bring one, bring

779
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
one, bring one.

780
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Come on, Reflin's pill or bring

781
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
one, bring one, bring one.

782
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Go do the work.

783
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Go on, Reflin's.

784
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Go on.

785
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
There was this company that

786
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
helped Uteno Pandora

787
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
to do her 3D concert

788
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
and it's an upcoming company.

789
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
And I was like, ooh.

790
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Oh, my God.

791
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Inside her knowledge, too,

792
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
I met Uteno Pandora before

793
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
she debuted and before I debuted.

794
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
That's so cool.

795
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Yeah, it's so cool.

796
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
I mean, she doesn't know that.

797
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
She doesn't know that we met

798
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
before, but I know that we met

799
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
before.

800
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Oh, my God.

801
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
That's cool, though.

802
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
She was so nice to me.

803
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
She's so lovely, but I don't

804
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
interact with her anymore

805
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
because she doesn't know who I

806
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
am. Smile.

807
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
Smile.

808
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
She's so, so lovely.

809
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Grin.

810
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Yeah.

811
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
And her goal was to have a 3D

812
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
concert and she achieved it.

813
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Oh, she achieved it.

814
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
That's so sweet.

815
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
I love girlies

816
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
in their dreams.

817
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Achieved.

818
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Achieved those goals.

819
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
You're only holding yourself back.

820
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
This is a good ray of bobble.

821
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
I love seeing how they move

822
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
their models.

823
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
I wonder if...

824
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
What?

825
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
It's not ogre yet, is it?

826
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
No, I'm core.

827
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Come on, get back on the stage.

828
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
God damn.

829
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
We didn't finish it.

830
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
Oh, an idol song.

831
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
We're mollans

832
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
and aimless

833
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
in song together.

834
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Is that a...

835
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Is that a Zora?

836
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Is that a Zora?

837
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Yeah!

838
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Are you enjoying it?

839
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Are you having fun as Zora?

840
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Yeah!

841
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
I didn't realise how reactive

842
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Mimosa's ears are.

843
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Yeah.

844
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
They are.

845
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
They're all well-read.

846
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
Mmm.

847
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
And her boobs, too.

848
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I know, I can't stop sharing

849
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
everyone's boobs.

850
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
I have really bad eyes, though.

851
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,160
So sometimes Mimosa's arms

852
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
look like a part of her hair.

853
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
And she's a little nuggy.

854
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Is she like a little nuggy?

855
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
You know what I love it.

856
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Her arms are very thin,

857
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
so they tend to kind of

858
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
disappear into her hair, for sure.

859
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
She's our little nugget.

860
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
My little nugget.

861
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
I want chicken nuggets.

862
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Oh my god, I had really good

863
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
chicken nuggets yesterday.

864
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
I know this is completely off-dolting,

865
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
but it's fucking delicious.

866
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
I was like,

867
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
I have bad eyes.

868
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
This is not an excuse to stare at boobs.

869
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Let me alone.

870
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it.

871
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
This is so hate.

872
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Hate.

873
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Yeah, Mimosa's voice.

874
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Mimosa's voice.

875
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Her mouth tracking is really good.

876
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,160
Nothing wrong with wanting

877
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
some strawberry milk.

878
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Get out of here.

879
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:18,160
My question is,

880
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
are they doing a five-man song

881
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
at the end?

882
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
I bet.

883
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
I hope so.

884
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
I hope they do.

885
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Yeah.

886
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
I wonder if they'll do

887
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
like an original song.

888
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
Yeah.

889
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
That would be crazy.

890
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
We should do an original song.

891
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Yeah, why did we learn

892
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
not to do an original song?

893
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
I'm like, bro, it's stressful,

894
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
and I was trying to debut.

895
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Last thing I'm going to do

896
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
is give them a custom song

897
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
that they like to try and do.

898
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
We should all have an original,

899
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
we should have a group song

900
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
that's an original.

901
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Okay.

902
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
I'll do the male part of the song

903
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
because my voice can handle that.

904
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
I'll do the rap part of the song.

905
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
I'll do the backup vocals.

906
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
That leaves Azura and Mercy

907
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
and Icy.

908
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
Perfect.

909
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
We're good.

910
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
Yeah, they can carry us

911
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
through the actual vocals.

912
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Exactly.

913
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
I'll just do that.

914
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
Yeah.

915
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Who's Adler of everything?

916
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
I'm scared of you.

917
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Be lower.

918
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
I'm mommy right now,

919
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
taking notes, honestly.

920
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
Bro, I'm spamming their DMs.

921
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
I'm like, how long did that

922
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
fucking take?

923
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
You're supposed to take it.

924
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
Maybe even months, honestly.

925
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Maybe this has been

926
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
cooking since day one.

927
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
You never know.

928
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I know I want to ask

929
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,160
the girls after.

930
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,160
I want to eat

931
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
the strawberries on her head.

932
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
I want to eat her.

933
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Shame.

934
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Look at the little saucy wink

935
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
she ended on.

936
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
She was like...

937
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
She knows what she's doing.

938
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,160
She knows it.

939
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
Not to make you guys jealous,

940
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
but...

941
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,160
Please.

942
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Please, five-man song.

943
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Come on.

944
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Come on.

945
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Moving on.

946
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
I know, I just got scared.

947
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
I'm like, what's happening?

948
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
I feel out.

949
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Okay.

950
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
Oh, my God, I mean...

951
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,160
Really big.

952
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm ready.

953
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,160
Oh, it's a five-man.

954
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,160
Let's go.

955
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
That's amazing.

956
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
What song is this?

957
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Original?

958
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
Is this a K-pop song?

959
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,160
Is it K-pop?

960
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
Yeah.

961
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,160
What song is this?

962
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
I'm wondering...

963
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
It makes sense that they picked

964
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
a K-pop group.

965
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
Yeah, that's true.

966
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
Because they all have

967
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
girl singers with different parts.

968
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
It's a Twice song.

969
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
It is a Twice song.

970
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I feel like I would recognize it

971
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
if it was a Twice song,

972
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
but I guess I'm a fake Twice fan.

973
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Name this particular member's

974
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
grandmother's maiden name right now.

975
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,160
Oh, I'm getting tingles.

976
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
This is awesome.

977
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,160
Oh, my God.

978
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,160
Can someone tell me what song this is?

979
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
It's K-D-A, apparently.

980
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Okay, that makes more sense.

981
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
Oh, it's K-D-A?

982
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Yeah.

983
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,160
Why did somebody say it was Twice?

984
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,160
Why are you lying?

985
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,160
Oh, it's I'll Show You by K-D-A and Twice.

986
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
Okay.

987
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Song for League of Legends.

988
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
Oh, well, that's Azura fucking Happy.

989
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
She's probably geeking out right now.

990
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
Hold on.

991
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
I want to go to her stream.

992
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,160
I'm going to.

993
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
She's going to be singing all the words from that one.

994
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,160
We'll listen to Azura singing, too.

995
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
Yeah.

996
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,160
She's probably harmonizing with them.

997
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
We popped up.

998
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,160
Oh, she's not singing.

999
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Sing for me, Azura.

1000
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Sing.

1001
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
She's just bopping.

1002
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,160
She's bopping from her fear right now.

1003
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
I'm going to say sing.

1004
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,160
I do, like, K-D-A songs.

1005
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,160
Wow, almost his voice.

1006
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,160
I wish I could sing like that, my God.

1007
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,160
I wish I could sing in Korean and in Japanese.

1008
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,160
That sounds so good.

1009
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
This is such a great song for all of them.

1010
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,160
This must have been a lot of practice, my God.

1011
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,160
I like how Azura is just like in the corner.

1012
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Is that chair?

1013
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
I'm leaning hard.

1014
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
Her voice.

1015
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,160
I love Azura.

1016
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,160
No, encore!

1017
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,160
Give us more!

1018
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,160
Mom, I want more!

1019
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,160
I want more!

1020
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,160
No.

1021
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,160
It cannot be.

1022
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Encore.

1023
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,160
Do the DJ scratch.

1024
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,160
Be like, oh, last song.

1025
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,160
We don't have time.

1026
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,160
And then DJ scratch.

1027
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,160
And they're all like, let's go!

1028
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,160
After party.

1029
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,160
Yeah.

1030
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,160
After party!

1031
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,160
On Reia's channel?

1032
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
Yeah.

1033
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,160
I'm going to go to Reia's channel right now.

1034
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,160
Azura!

1035
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
Azura!

1036
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1037
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
Wait.

1038
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Hold on.

1039
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
That was really good.

1040
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
Party, party, party, party, party!

1041
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,160
That was insane.

1042
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Yeah, dang.

1043
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Let's see.

1044
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,160
Arm.

1045
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
Give me one second.

1046
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,160
Never more.

1047
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,160
I'm going to see if we can either watch it.

1048
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,160
If not, I will redirect into her.

1049
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
I'm going to redirect into her.

1050
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,160
How do you redirect without ending stream?

1051
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
You're not in the stream.

1052
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,160
Yeah, you're not in the stream.

1053
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,160
You should edit.

1054
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Edit video.

1055
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,160
Edit video?

1056
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,160
Yeah.

1057
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,160
Yeah, you edit video or you just go into studio, YouTube studio.

1058
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
Yeah, but how do you send them?

1059
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,160
How do you send your viewers to the stream without ending your own stream?

1060
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
Oh, I thought I didn't know what you were asking.

1061
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
Oh, no, I don't know.

1062
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
You can do that.

1063
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,160
You could just post a link and be like, go forth.

1064
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,160
In fact, I'm pulling up the link right now.

1065
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,160
I'll post a link and then I'm going to chat with everyone for a little bit and then I'm going to redirect.

1066
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Okay, I'll do that too.

1067
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
I'm going to see you guys.

1068
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,160
Okay.

1069
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,160
Bye.

1070
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,160
What is it?

1071
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,160
1115.

1072
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
Oh, she's not pulled up yet.

1073
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,160
That's why she's not live.

1074
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
There you go.

1075
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,160
I'm doing remedy for the poor post-concert crisis.

1076
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Okay, I will redirect into the waiting room for them briefings.

1077
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
I'm going to say thank you to Amy.

1078
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
She'd be keeping me company during this.

1079
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Absolutely.

1080
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,160
Likewise.

1081
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,160
Thank you.

1082
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,160
Thank you so much.

1083
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,160
I nailed it.

1084
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,160
And business, business, business.

1085
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,160
I didn't mean to spam their discord.

1086
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
I was supposed to do it live once too.

1087
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
Thank you so much, girls.

1088
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,160
I'll talk to you later, all right?

1089
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,160
Bye.

1090
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,160
Okay.

1091
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,160
Bye.

1092
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
Bye.

1093
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,160
All right, guys.

1094
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,160
That was fun.

1095
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
That was great.

1096
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
My God, that was awesome.

1097
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
It is such a good job.

1098
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,160
I'm so impressed with their singing skill.

1099
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,160
I didn't know that, like, a lot of them had pipes like that.

1100
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,160
And for such a small company to be able to, like,

1101
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,160
make something that amazing,

1102
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,160
you could see why Stradi was geeking out.

1103
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,160
She's feeling very inspired because they did such an amazing job.

1104
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,160
And they're so talented.

1105
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,160
You, my plus girls are so talented and they're so sweet.

1106
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
I love spending time with you, my plus girls.

1107
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
They're literally awesome.

1108
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
But yeah, head on over to Reyes channel,

1109
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,160
the sweet little jote, unfortunately,

1110
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
right at the end.

1111
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,160
I don't know what will consist of the after-party.

1112
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:45,160
It seems like it'll be in 20 minutes.

1113
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,160
Looks like everybody's redirecting.

1114
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,160
Looks like Rocky from Pixeling's also redirecting.

1115
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,160
Okay, yeah.

1116
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,160
I think everybody's kind of redirecting into them.

1117
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,160
So I'll see you guys later.

1118
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,160
Make sure you go check out the watch, the after-party.

1119
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,160
So, yeah, I'll probably be in the chat and geeking out with them.

1120
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,160
So, bye guys. Love you.

1121
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,160
Thank you guys for stopping by and watching this with me

1122
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,160
and, like, hearing how goofy that me and the other girls are together.

1123
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,160
It's so fun, yeah.

1124
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
See ya. See you tomorrow for Twilight.

1125
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,160
Bye.

1126
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Bye.

1127
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Bye.

1128
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:04,160
I forgot you guys can hear me.

1129
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,160
I forgot to bring my mic.

1130
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,160
I can almost hear her.

1131
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,160
Oh, you can almost hear me.

1132
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,160
Oh, I'm a ghost.

1133
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,160
It's like you can hear me.

1134
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
My keyboard's still.

1135
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,160
They check out that you might plus girls info in my description.

1136
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,160
And go and like their video.

1137
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Thank you.

1138
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
Bye.

1139
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,160
You stay.
