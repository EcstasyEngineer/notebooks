5
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:22,920
well, I feel like I'm moving 5 miles an hour

6
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm so tired

7
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,560
How are you I'm not I'm not gonna lie to you

8
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,120
At exactly four o'clock I woke up from a nap walked over to my computer impressed go live

9
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,720
So I'm still waking up

10
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm waking up to the ashes

11
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,280
Okay, it might be a little bit delirious

12
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,400
Got my tea ready to rumble I

13
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,760
Gotta remember who I am who I am I

14
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,960
Also, so like I got an iPad stand

15
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Thank you for your support those who look at my throne and such and I was trying to set it up so that I could use my

16
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,760
iPad almost like a third monitor and look at chat and it was working well except I could see

17
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,640
Like it was so tiny I couldn't see anything and I'm like oh

18
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,640
I'll have to lean forward and squint my eyes to see what the frick. I'm looking at

19
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Oh

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,920

By the way, is she be short for Shabilla

23
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:13,080
I'm too tired to come up with a snarky remark to that

24
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,920
Um, oh no, I see the Tomb Raider. I don't know where I am

25
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Oh

26
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,120
You've got to melt model kids go sick, but you're here. I

27
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
like

28
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,440
some of you guys might saw me all I went to the doctors this morning and

29
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
And

30
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,560
Like

31
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Going out into the world

32
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,560
Takes a lot out of me and interacting with people because I kept kept getting turned around like I kept

33
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,000
Accidentally going the wrong way because my GPS was messing stuff up

34
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,720
I was a little bit late and then the office is taken forever and so I was just so tired

35
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,240
When I got home, but then I had to do a bunch of other stuff to prepare for stream

36
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,000
And then like exactly three thirty eight is fell asleep on the couch

37
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
and knocked out

38
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,480
But uh, we're here we are here

39
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,920
She beat me in losses kind of be I have no sense of direction

40
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,600
Uh, I I never know where I am even in my town that in in my city that I've lived in for

41
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:35,240
My entire life essentially, I'm like, oh, which which road do I take? Where where am I?

42
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,160
It's not a miracle I'm awake right now. I did set an alarm

43
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,800
But I'm like, I know I needed to just like lay down for a bit and just gain my bearings

44
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,080
Um, but I hope you guys enjoyed Tomb Raider

45
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
with IC and then

46
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
ASMR with momay

47
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,360
I am quite E.P. I am waking up

48
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,600
Don't worry. I'll wake up though. I'm just like here. I didn't fall asleep till like 3 a.m

49
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,760
My whole sleep schedule is messed up ever since I streamed so late

50
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
A womb raider? Oh my god

51
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,840
I already made that joke

52
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,840
I already made the ash and dust joke

53
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,520
the

54
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
imagine dragons

55
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,080
Oh, you like imagine dragons. Well, imagine me dragon. He's nuts across your face

56
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Got him

57
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
I forget to put my ooloo mouth on

58
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,440
I'm pretty good. I'm pretty I'm pretty I'm pretty uh

59
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm as

60
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm sort of smart as a whip that doesn't make any sense. But yeah, I have no idea what this game is about

61
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,840
Um, I know like it might be a visual novel

62
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,760
I went in for like a second and I saw that it was voice acted. So I turned off the voices. I'll be voice at voicing

63
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
See the characters today

64
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
And you guys can vote in the voices

65
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,200
Um, it's about bunny girls. Yeah, I like I haven't watched any gameplay

66
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,520
Haven't read

67
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,560
Anything about it. I know it was a flavor of the month game for a very for a little bit

68
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
And I'm like, okay, I'll play it

69
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
um

70
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
So we'll see we'll see

71
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,000
Yawns and finds I'm surrounded by bunny girls

72
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,320
I see this as an absolute win. Okay. I'm gonna love it

73
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,680
I also went in just in case because like when I went to purchase the game

74
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,320
I was like, oh wait, I hope there's not like surprise things that need to be censored. So I went and I double checked

75
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,960
Because I didn't know if it's gonna be like a hoonipop situation. You guys are all just like tricking me

76
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,160
And the whole world is against me tricking me pretending that stuff is normal

77
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,800
And then it's a crazy messed up game

78
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
um

79
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,480
Yeah, so I went in there wasn't any of that

80
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I was like, okay, although

81
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,280
I did see like when I was looking at the steam page for like a brief second when I was purchasing the game

82
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
just like people's screenshots

83
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
And they're all ponzu shots

84
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,280
So I'm like, what am I getting into?

85
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,560
Kushi jokes scare exactly she doesn't know about the level that just opens what?

86
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:50,040
Excuse me. It's just a lot of fan service. It's on brand for me. What color today?

87
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,840
What the fuck does that mean? I'm white

88
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,000
Some I did I did tease a possible brown toggle

89
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,760
um

90
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,920
It's death less messed up than class of 09. I didn't expect it to be messed up

91
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,880
As much as class of 09 panty simulator with a side of alcohol

92
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
You think they meant my ponzu

93
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
I don't remember

94
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
um

95
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Actually, these are my favorite pairs

96
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,880
It's like, uh, it's like rain like pastel rainbowy

97
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,040
lace

98
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
with flowers on it

99
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
And um

100
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
It's a thong

101
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
And it's like has a lot of light blue

102
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,760
It's nice to get my skin tone anyways. Um

103
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:00,120
Usually we're nothing but I had to go out into the world today. So I decided to you know bundle up before going on an excursion

104
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
I

105
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Actually fucking hate thongs. I don't even know why I have so money so money so many

106
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I need to um

107
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,960
buy

108
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
More underwear like some like cheekies

109
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,960
I uh, I accidentally so like I

110
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm a huge fan of like the savage x fenty like rihanna's lingerie line

111
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,880
And I forgot to fucking cancel my membership because they charge $59 a month for membership

112
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
And you can skip the month mind you

113
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,600
And you can like save the money, but I swear to you

114
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,520
I thought I skipped the month and they charged me 60 bucks and I have to spend it on something and I'm like

115
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,280
Well, it looks like I'm getting panties looks like I'm getting panties

116
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,920
They have great stuff, but I'm like what the hell, you know

117
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm like what the what the what the actual fuck?

118
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Um, that's really high quality

119
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,080
It's mostly what I wear. Although I go to the pink store sometimes. Um

120
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
For a little something something

121
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,320
It's been 10 minutes and we're talking about pansos. Yeah, what did you expect?

122
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,520
Are you new here?

123
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,320
Wait a minute. Who are you?

124
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
What does she be

125
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,160
It's funny. You guys have got me saying erm what the sigma and erm what the scallop

126
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,720
I uh because like when I when my stream just wasn't loading when I press start

127
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
I was like, um

128
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
erm what the

129
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,040
What the scallop and then I just like audibly sighed out loud when I when I heard what I said

130
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,600
I'd be disappointed if you weren't still talking about random at this point random

131
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,000
You be it's she be it's a me. She be

132
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Let's go and

133
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Yep

134
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,480
I should put disclaimer. I'm tired of shit. I promise you. I'm not drunk

135
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,560
I'm just tired. I usually like listen. I made a big sacrifice

136
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,200
Streaming at the time that I do because around this time is normally my nap time

137
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
My family is notorious for napping

138
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,240
My mom's the only one that can't my whole dad's side of the family are napping champions and from

139
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
four to five

140
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,440
30

141
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,520
Prime nap time something I've like napped for like four hours before and I still managed to get to sleep

142
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,400
Is it depression? I don't know. Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's

143
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
dysthymia

144
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,880
She be

145
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,720
Did you hear a twitter room of the likes you can see?

146
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,200
I can still see everybody's likes because I have not updated my twitter on my phone

147
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
So you can't hide from me

148
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,800
I know your secrets. I know when you're awake. I know when you've been bad or good. So be bad

149
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
For goodness sake

150
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,840
What is your favorite kind of vegetable um

151
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,000
Is a potato a vegetable I really like potatoes

152
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Yeah, potatoes a vegetable

153
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Yeah, because I didn't have like a seed

154
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,760
I was like the dumbest thing I've ever said is a potato a vegetable. Oh my god. Um

155
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,520
It's funny because like technically zucchini is fruit

156
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
tomatoes are fruit

157
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,920
Like carrots are vegetable and like leafy greens are vegetables

158
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
I really like all vegetables

159
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm like trying to think of a vegetable. I don't like

160
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:08,440
Like because I'll just eat anything. I don't like like I like I'm not a huge fan of arugula, but I also eat it

161
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,960
I really like spinach. Yep. Mm-hmm

162
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,800
I like brussel sprouts. Did you know they've actually um engineered the bad flavor out of brussel sprouts now?

163
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,200
Because my dad used to hate brussel sprouts

164
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,320
And then he like threw some in the air fryer

165
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,480
And like with a little bit of oil salt and pepper and they were like really tasty nutty almost like an artichoke heart

166
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
And he's like this is not like what they taste like

167
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,280
Back then and then we looked it up and did research and they actually engineered the shit out of there

168
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,640
You hate bell peppers. I love bell peppers

169
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,880
Tomatoes are both vegetables and fruit depends on which taxonomy you're using. All right

170
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I don't know what that means, but godspeed

171
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,160
But they didn't smell so strong. Yeah, they do still smell like, you know, the devil's asshole, but it is

172
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,360
Spinach over lettuce for salads 100% I like butter lettuce

173
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,280
um

174
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Because it's similar to spinach

175
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,640
Or I'll use like butter lettuce for like a lettuce wrap pretty good

176
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,320
Why the fuck are we talking about vegetables? You know how much like this is how this is what I mean

177
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,320
I don't know somebody asked me a question. I'm like, all right talks 10 minutes explaining my answers

178
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,520
But her lettuce I barely know shut up get out of here

179
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,680
I think canned steam veggies turn people off flavor so much better

180
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Baked in oil. Oh, yeah, I agree with that

181
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
I prefer all like

182
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,120
I'll eat steamed veggies because I like I like steamed broccoli or green beans. I love green beans

183
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
um

184
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
The best lounge chat. Yeah

185
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Yapa be cotton bum

186
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,720
That's a me

187
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
favorite breakfast

188
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,560
You know

189
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
I love french toast

190
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,720
French toast I think was the first thing I learned how to cook after like learning how to like boil water

191
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,320
And like make eggs. I learned how to make french toast. My mom taught me how to make french toast

192
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,800
Um, and it was so fun that experience. Um

193
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,480
I burned everything, but you know, you live and you learn, but yeah, I love I love french toast

194
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
I love the french

195
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,640
toast

196
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,760
Especially if it's texas toast. I don't know

197
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
um

198
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,080
I'm I'm speaking in a very poor french accent

199
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,680
Because I'm half asleep, but um, I am it is how it is

200
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,120
Uh

201
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,440
No, I didn't I can boil water guys. I'm a very good cook

202
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,200
When you're a kid and you're learning you're not a very good cook

203
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
It's called eggy bread in england

204
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,200
That's fucking weird. It's not a better name. No, I don't like it

205
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Don't X to doubt

206
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:17,080
If you've looked at my all account people have commended me on my cooking skills because I have sent I've taken pictures and posted some food

207
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,600
I have cooked

208
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,440
um

209
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,640
French toast is called lost bread and

210
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I feel like there's a pun in there

211
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
I

212
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,320
Just found out the healthy frozen protein waffles taste and smell like the ben and jerry's waffle cones. Oh

213
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay, but what brand?

214
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,640
I do love waffles though. I used to fucking live off of

215
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,880
um

216
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,400
My mom said I used to love french toast sticks and eggo waffles and then out of nostalgia the other day

217
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,840
I bought some

218
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,200
Eggo waffles, but I don't have any syrup or butter. So

219
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
I mistakes were made

220
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,800
Waffles versus pancakes. I prefer waffles

221
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Like I love I really like pancakes, but like sometimes pancakes can be a bit too mushy for me

222
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,760
And I like the I prefer the texture of a waffle over a pancake and that like a waffle can hold syrup better

223
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
whereas a pancake

224
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,960
Um just becomes kind of just like soppy

225
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,280
I've read french toast sticks. Yeah, it's it's pretty much just like french toast

226
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,080
And you throw it in a toaster and you toast it in there

227
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,240
Or like a con confectionary confection oven or

228
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
an oven

229
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,560
My belgian side tell me waffles raw talking

230
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,920
I I have done that before but I prefer like I

231
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,760
I I'm weird and I prefer to eat waffles with my hands

232
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
like my mom

233
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,480
For some odd reason because it's not like I was going to impress anybody or have a luncheon with the queen

234
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
but she drilled etiquette in like proper

235
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,760
like

236
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Using silverware into me

237
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:12,200
Like which forks and knives to use which like if you're at this sort of event what this means and what that means

238
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,520
um

239
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,680
I think she just wanted me to be like proper

240
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,840
Which isn't like a bad thing like teaching, you know, your child etiquette and

241
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,320
being you know behaved at the dinner table because I was like I remember

242
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,200
um

243
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,120
I would always have to say like can I be excused before I left the dinner table and I had you know all that stuff

244
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,280
And so I remember like one parent when I was over somebody's house

245
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,120
I would just like can I be excused and they're like why are you asking and I'm like

246
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Because I always have to ask

247
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,840
Yeah, she maybe yeah manners make if she be it's funny. I was literally

248
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,400
I don't know why it popped in my head on the toilet, but I was randomly just sitting there. I'm just like

249
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,760
Manners make if the man that's like I didn't even watch Kingsman reach recently

250
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,400
Actually, that's a lie. I watched the Kingsman

251
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
I didn't finish it because it was boring

252
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,120
I got to the part past Rasputin

253
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Rasputin

254
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,520
Poutine that's basically wants poutine now and I was like, all right

255
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,680
This is kind of weird

256
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,960
And it's kind of boring

257
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,800
I prefer the the first Kingsman movies moving on and then I fell asleep and then I just never bothered to watch it again

258
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,000
She'd be getting mad at her friends. I was because they served over over the wrong shoulder

259
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,120
No, like I don't even recall like a lot of that stuff anymore. I remember I went to like um a fancy restaurant with my parents

260
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,800
And this is the type of restaurant where if you get crumbs on the table

261
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,160
They come over and they have a little thing to take the crumbs off and they move them away

262
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,200
And they have like the multiple silverware and it's like that's like a my parents usually go there for their anniversary because it's a very like

263
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,360
pricey place

264
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,680
And I've been like sitting there and I'm like fuck

265
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,040
Which fork do I use for salad again? I don't even

266
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,000
my mom's like

267
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That one I'm like, oh, thanks. Anyways

268
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,280
They lived a certain man

269
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,720
It was a long ago. He was being and strong in his eyes a flaming gold

270
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,560
That's the fucking I love doing that and just dance. It's like probably my favorite song to do in just dance

271
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Besides, I think

272
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,520
Was I like that by Richard? Hold on. I like that just dance

273
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
By the talk by the

274
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,600
Elect was it the toxic revenge or what the fuck?

275
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Toxic Avenger

276
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,640
Am I tripping I could have sworn I like that

277
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,120
By toxic Avenger was in just dance

278
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,360
I'm getting as toxic from Britney Spears

279
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Very frustrated

280
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,360
Whatever I'm having I'm experiencing a Mandela effect for a moment

281
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
It's gonna be saver

282
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,240
I definitely want to like if when they get a 3d model 100 I want to do just dance

283
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
I'm like I need to get back

284
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,720
into like

285
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,240
Dance and shape

286
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
I'm just like a

287
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
I'm just atrophying in my chair

288
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I

289
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,400
Think you had a cool dream toxic Avenger is a movie. No

290
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,520
I think your thumbnail got restricted. Are you fucking serious? I you know, I noticed that when I was on my iPad

291
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I was just like wait a second

292
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Why is it like grayed out

293
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Like it was that like the three dots thing I I didn't know what that meant though, but that makes a lot more sense then

294
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
I'll fix it later. I blame my manager

295
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,080
They approved the the thumbnail

296
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Throw some boobs in the thumbnail

297
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,120
Put some boobs in the thumbnail bitch for some boobs check out Azura's cover of boobs in the thumbnail

298
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,400
That it was leg but the gray was an artistic choice. It's gray in the homepage

299
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
I

300
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,680
Just more reminders that I'm probably never going to be monetized

301
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,560
Sometimes I fall asleep and I hear my bgm in my ears

302
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,680
And is I can't tell if I like it or not

303
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Oh wake up

304
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,880
Oh, I need a non outfit. I was thinking about adding one of those to throw in like one of those, um

305
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,920
Vtuber outfits that I've been using for streams and stuff

306
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,960
I have to get rid of this bod based on what happened with other streamers. Why what happened to their vods?

307
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,920
Wait, I thought everyone got monetized and saying no, that's not true. We applied for monetization all at the same time

308
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
um

309
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The majority of the other girls got it

310
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,080
I'm still I'm still under review. It doesn't have I'm just I'm

311
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,120
mentally preparing myself to be disappointed in case it happens

312
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,680
Serenity

313
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Munchie be would go so hard

314
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,480
Does she know do they know

315
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,760
It was a priestess and a nun and another another iteration

316
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,000

Pole dancing or it's like a rabbit. I don't know

Just pretend it's a chicken

So it's a chicken pole dancing and that's like my face is on the chicken

372
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,320
And then you get chicken strips from sheebie. That's

373
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Chicken member strips. Yep

Worry about me

384
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,120
It's mostly frustrating because I had like I want to do

385
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,320
Like the membership streams that I have in mind

386
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,080

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,320
The box that holds the strips unless

390
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
You would prefer both

391
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
We might do that

392
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Ow, I just like

393
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Hit myself with a nipple really hard

394
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,960
Uh, excuse me. That was a sleepy burp

395
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,480
Bup bup bup bup buddy gordon

00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,200
Can I kiss the boo boo to help you know

401
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,760
Can I be can I be can I be tmi for a second?

402
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,720
So mine are pierced and so sometimes I just get like hooked on stuff

403
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Or I'm just like bump into something like

404
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
And that's like the worst thing

405
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
I don't

406
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,960
No, no, I'm not ripping them. They're not my nipples aren't getting ripped off guys

407
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,040
It's more it's like imagine

408
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,760
Like if it like, you know

409
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,920
Actually, I don't know if it's like this at all because I don't have balls

410
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,640
But imagine you're going to zip up your pants and like a little bit of your ball gets like caught in the zipper

411
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,040
It's like a little bit. It's like a little less than that

412
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
That's what I'm assuming

413
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
But imagine that on your chest

414
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,760
Because it's like, you know, like I'm not gonna elaborate. Anyways, I was just fucking loud. Ha

415
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
I've had it before it hurts ouch

416
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,400
You get in the hospital when you get caught in your zipper

417
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,000
Well, I'm I didn't mean like if you're caught caught like you can't get out

418
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,280
I mean like when you kind of zip it up and just like pinches you a little bit

419
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,440
Like because I'm like, I've done that. I've done that to my pussy lip before and I'm like, ah

420
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,880
I'm just like, ah like gira. Ah, and then I'm just like quickly

421
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Okay, maybe it's not as bad as that

422
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,800
That's imagine you guys are such fucking babies

423
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
You nipple piercings hurt once they're there

424
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,600
Uh for the first like couple months. Yes, they're pretty tender

425
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,000
I remember I went so I went with Salem who I talk about often

426
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,520
She we had only known each other for a week. Mind you. I'm like, hey, do you want to come with me and watch me get my nipples pierced

427
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
And she's just like, oh my god. Yes, sure

428
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,720
Because I want to walk like I want to get them done too and I'm like, okay, let's go and um

429
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,440
We go there

430
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,920
first one goes in and I'm like, ow

431
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,880
That really hurt and I look over and look at Salem's face and her face is like

432
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Completely mortified like

433
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,640
And then the piercer was telling me so usually the adrenaline kicks in

434
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,800
Only for the first one and then kind of tapers off

435
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,120
For the second one so a lot of people don't get the second one done. I'm like, fuck it. Put the second one through

436
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,520
And they did that and it hurt worse and I was like, ah

437
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,400
And then I couldn't like put anything against my chest for like a month

438
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,280
That's when you know what? I went right back to work

439
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,760
Like because I because there's a piercing place in the mall and I just went back to work

440
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
I went on my lunch break. I'm like, fuck it

441
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
I'm a badass bitch

442
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,560
Um, what kind of period I just have barbells

443
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,880
Um, but they look cute in a shirt and stuff. I know some people don't like them

444
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Like but like I know straw knees, um

445
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,200

My model doesn't have it though

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,120
But it it would be on brand for me to have it

449

But like I did I have a high pain tolerance

450
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,720

She doesn't don me though

461
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,200
Wait, what do you normal what about I already forgot what I was talking about

But um, yeah, I have a high pain tolerance. So she doesn't hurt me

463
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,160
Not sorry. She was a doll. It's too soft. She's I am also dollar. Yeah, I'm

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,320
Straw knees a freaking small ass chick. Let me tell you that though. I could probably rest my arm on her head

469
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Uh

470
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,520
Why did I choose this game because I had the word bunny in it and I wanted to play something bunny related

471
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I'll take a seat

472
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,680

476
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,720
in my little

477
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,120
Wait, am I five six in heels? Does that mean I'm

478
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,080
I'm just thinking because if I'm a hundred and sixty eight centimeters while I'm wearing my red heels

479
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,600
Does that mean I'm actually like five four?

My company fired me

570

It is what it is. It's not the first time it's happened

571
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,600
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place. I have nothing but gratitude for the company

572
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,200
My boss even cried for me when they fired me. He said I'm sorry. I couldn't help you out

573
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,200
They told me that this company isn't the right fit for me and that there are other places where I could shine

574
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
It was nice of them to say that

575
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,000
Is there really somewhere out there some place that would take in a fool like me?

576
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,200
Hi to come

Hmm, I didn't know they opened this kind of bar here. It's someplace where I can drink with girls

701
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:33,240
I've never been in a shop like this before. It's clean and the girls are cute. I've only been to the really

702
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:40,120
Disgusting fucked up ones where the girls look like they have track marks up their arms and have been huffing

710
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:21,720
Since when the fuck do you give me the right to go to a bar where I pay money to hang out with you

Anyways, whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come. Why did you just ignore me?

712
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,240
You're so sincere

01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,480
Kind of tinted in my pants seeing that girl bent over that table

723
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,280

01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,360
No way. Why would I take something a girl said to me? Seriously? We're not even know her name

01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,800
I don't even remember what her face looks like. I was just staring at her tits

733
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,760
She didn't seem to be joking around but

734
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
You know her tits

01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:22,040

737
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I'm the only one who thinks that

738
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,080
If I don't finish it myself, maybe it's still possible to start again

I love them to death. They're very proud of me because they know I've wanted to be a content creator for a very long time

828
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:16,280

829
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,240

You're a piggy. I'm gonna rinse the peg. Give me your wallet

838
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:09,560
Vodcon she's a natural. No, it's because so when I first um

839
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,880
When I finally was able to log into my NSFW. I mean my alternative account

840
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:24,120
Um on twitter. I was like trying to go through and there's just like a lot of like fucking like sex bots and I'm like, uh

841
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,360
Okay, and like the majority of them were

842
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,480
goddesses and queens and

843
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,480
mistresses

844
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,880
And they were all just doing like like had that verbiage and I'm like what the fuck is like I'm like

845
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,520
Why is this on my timeline? I started just like following like

846
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,520
anti artists

847
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,080
To meet your person and then I finally went away

848
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,480
I'm like fuck this timeline. I don't want these bitches on my timeline

849
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,680
It's free money

850
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,720
Yeah, but I don't feel good about it

851
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,320
Like a tip is different because you're tipping me because you're enjoying my content

852
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,200
What they're doing is they're

853
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,520
They're like they're not doing it because they want to

854
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
assist in

855
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,640
Trying to say this so that it's

856
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,040
Okay for you too, but at this point I kind of don't give a fuck

857
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,760
uh, they don't

858
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,920
really care about like

859
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,640
Helping out

860
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,640
their little piggy, you know

861
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,560
They just want the money

862
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,640
they don't care about like the actual like

863
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,760
relationship of it

864
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,080
And it's like the respect of it

865
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,480
because there's

866
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,480
Yeah, I don't know never mind

867
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,960
Yeah, they're not really entertainers. It's like like and the girls just like had their fucking feet out

868
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,760
and they're like

869
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:57,640
Send me a tribute of 20 dollars to DM me and I'm like what the fuck is this

870
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,920
It just I'm sorry just like it generally like irritates me

871
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,680
But yeah, but then just donate who don't enjoy that but I also think I'm like it's kind of

872
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,880
It's kind of predatory

873
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,840
Unless you have a lot of expendable income, you know, but

874
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:23,000
I don't judge the people who get pleasure from it. I don't that's fine. You do you

875
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,240
I'm not a huge fan of the people that take advantage of those people

876
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,600
That's it

877
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,760
And those bots are annoying and most of them are fake anyways, so most people are just DMing some random

878
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,480
cash app of like a dude

879
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,360

880
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,600
Texas

881
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,960
Who stole his wife's speed picks and is rinsing out piggies

882
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,720
Hey, at least I'm in his family could get to disney

883
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,920
Problem is that some of those men are just having their low impulse control tickets. That's that's what I mean

884
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,920
That's another point like it's there's that as well 100%

885
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,960
I would like to youtube money, but I gotta admit it. Yeah

886
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,400
I want someone like

01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,240
First and foremost take care of yourself

888
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,840
That's all I say

889
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,080
A day in white tipped one dollar day in white

890
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,400
So what you're saying is they want the tip but don't care about the tip

891
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,920
Exactly

892
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,320

You know, it's important you don't crush the center. It's the sides of the neck because you're trying to cut off the

Well, aren't you just this this is going against one dollar and fifty cents. This is reverse fandom

01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:12,600
Oh, I what I was gonna say, I'll say it from across the room. You can't see me. I'm waving. Hello. Hi. I'm far away. Um

986
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,840
Like I added

987
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,320
Guys are gonna make fun of me and that's okay. I don't mind it because I'm a grown bitch. All right

988
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,840
If you're gonna call me a bitch you better put sense in it in front of it

989
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:28,040
Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame because I don't have one

990
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,360
I've been sleeping on a mattress on the floor for almost two years now

991
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,040
Like you know that one picture

992
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:39,160
Of that guy like like he's like uh write my apartment. It's literally like a tv

993
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,480
In like a lawn chair

994
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,480
My apartment was that for the longest time

995
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,720
And you guys are just so nice and somebody bought me a bed frame and I'm like

996
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,400
Oh my god, I don't have to sleep on the floor

997
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
People are too kind

998
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,480
That's like I I hope that like when I become big enough

999
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:11,880
I can spread that sort of love, you know, like uh do like uh charity streams

1000
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,840
I think that would be really cool

1001
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,560
That would be really neat

1002
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,640
The water ah

1003
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,640
Bring myself in the water

1004
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,120
But yeah, like I would love to also just like help out smaller creators

1005
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:36,120
By like collabing with smaller creators or like um

1006
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,040
Maybe like

1007
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,240
Taking someone in a community who like wants to be a vtuber like helping them fund their model

1008
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,960
I feel like that would probably go bad, but you know, I'm just too nice for him

1009
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,600
Do I need help? Okay

1010
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:02,440
I know someone who's went to k and sold us on the streamer. I remember it when I

1011
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,920
um

1012
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,640
One of my friends you like uh, one of my like uh, I'm gonna pray Jesus fuck anonymous tipped 50 dollars

1013
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:18,440
Here's to a future bed frame also. Give some to your dad. No, I have a bed frame, but thank you

1014
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:23,800
I will I'll let him somebody might supply some of my comic books or something. Um

1015
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,960
He'll he'll he'll treat himself

1016
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,240
It's like I don't know like starbucks coffee or something. Uh

1017
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,120
when

1018
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,160
I first started streaming one of the people I became mutuals with

1019
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:43,720
She just she started shooting later than me and then someone donated her 7k dot like 7k

1020
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,800
I remember the context as to why they were just like

1021
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,400
And just like whipped it at her during stream and I'm sitting there watching the stream

1022
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,080
I'm like, what the fuck like people just like people are yeah

1023
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,800
I was like, holy crap

1024
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,960
people just like

1025
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,200
I just want I just want to know I'm like, what did they do as a job?

1026
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:07,480
Like, you know those guys that like do those tiktoks. They're like, hey

1027
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,880
So what do you do for a living? I just want to ask those people what they do for a living

1028
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,880
I just buy one big bed frame and combine them

1029
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,000
Crazy

1030
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Saudi imagine like this

1031
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:29,240
Like a Saudi prince just like really being obsessed with vtubers. That's actually kind of awesome

1032
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
But um

1033
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,600
Like but it's but it's you guys like I I need to

1034
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:42,600
Make this point to you. It's you guys that keep the vtubing community afloat

1035
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,720
Don't ever forget that without our fan base

1036
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,640
There would be no us there would be no vtuber vtubing

1037
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,840
So that's why your support means a lot

1038
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:02,840
However, you know, there's a fine line just because you do donate does not mean you're entitled to

1039
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,840
Uh all the vtubers attention, etc

1040
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,320
Just yeah

1041
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,360
I don't think I really need to elaborate on that because you are all adults

1042
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,960
Mostly some of you I presume here

1043
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:26,840
Uh, I'm gonna get rich so I can do the ties right like I like so like

1044
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,800
I always said to myself. I'm like, okay

1045
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,880
If I ever blow up and become like a vtuber, fuck you money. I'm just throwing it at other streamers

1046
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,320
I'm just fucking you left right. You get cash. You get cash

1047
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,960
You get because I'm not someone who like needs a lot like I'm cool

1048
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:48,040
All I want is a house and I'm good. It's literally it. I want a house and debt-free

1049
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,680
I'm just living with my cats and my chickens and my goats

1050
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,960
And my quail. I've decided I want quail by the way

1051
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,080
And I want to run a rescue and that's it

1052
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,240
That's it

1053
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,920
That's it

1054
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:08,520
I don't care for fucking fancy cars. I don't wear designer because that's fucking stupid

1055
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,640
So I'm like, yeah, we're chilling

1056
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,840
We're chilling

1057
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,840
In my btsm room. Yep

1058
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,040

1059
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,800
I get a house and I just thought I have like a red room from like 50 shades

1060
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,320

01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,720
I don't know what I would do with peacocks when I sell the feathers

1065
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,120
And

1066
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,000
I also want to pay off my mom's debt and my dad's debt buy my parents a house

1067

And I love her for that

Has any content house gone well? No

1085
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,640
We're changing that

1086
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,120
We'll have to move to one country for a content. I don't know what would be the best place for us to move

1087
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,120
Hmm

1088
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:53,560
What kind of browned on you the biracial kind I don't what flavor of black are you?

1089
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,080
Texas I'm not fucking going to Texas

1090
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,480
You

1091
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:10,920
No, I have had people so like again I work in retail people always because I'm very ethnically ambiguous looking

1092
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,840
um

1093
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,560
I got mistaken for so many different things

1094
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
because I just

1095
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,480
I don't know. I'm like fucking mystique from x-men. I just look like everybody

1096
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,200
except asian

1097
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,520
Actually, no, that's a lie one time somebody thought I was blazian

1098
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:32,360
I thought I was mixed because how I like did my makeup and like it was when I was really into k-pop idols

1099
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,200
So I did my makeup like them and it gave me a little bit of like a

1100
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,160
Little blazian look and I was like I look hot as fuck

1101
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,840
But I'm not

1102
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,640
I'm blue. Yes, I'm blue

1103
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
What's my hex code?

1104
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,520
Hey, but what a candle would you ever want to come up here? I've actually been yeah, this is I

1105
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,480
I guess this is zatsu

1106
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,360
So much for playing a game. I hate myself

1107
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,480
um

1108
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:08,280
I've been to kebek and I've been to motel. Uh, I do like those places

1109
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:19,800
So do you love zatsu's every stream is a zatsu in disguise. Is this like aim street?

1110
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,880
I

1111
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,120
It's because I get distracted

1112
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:28,360
And I go off on tangents and then I want to elaborate on those tangents

1113
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:32,600
And then you guys ask me another question and then I get more. It's your fault. It's all I'm gonna say

1114
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,720
Oh, her name is how the fuck do I know her name now?

1115
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,400
Ah, hold on. Yes, sip a tea before I start this

01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,600
I don't even I'm not even diagnosed ADHD

1117
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,720
I'm just I'm just fucking weird

1118
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,000
Chat reflects the streamer good point

1119
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,840
Nine more hours and we hit the daily insert interns quota

1120
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,760
I don't even get questioned people thought I was Chinese Japanese Korean, but I'm Filipino and just monolingual and I stuck with me

1121
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:12,360
Oh, yeah, I understand. Um, oh, yeah, but I'm my my story. I'm just gonna do it then I'll do I'll say my story

1122
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,440
Then I'll continue with the game. I fucking promise

1123
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,120
I'm adding to my goal list like actually

1124
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,960
Do nothing but a game for the for two hours

1125
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:30,520
Well, that'll kind of well good thing we're playing power power watch simulator tomorrow because then I can yap and game

1126
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,920

01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,400
I'm Haitian. I'm half I'm half Haitian

1144
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,040
And then I'm like a bunch of other

1145
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,720
white things

1146
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,640
literally I have like a

1147
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,400
15 thing list

1148
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,400
on my mom's side of what I am

1149
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,920
And they're just like, oh, but like

1150
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:59,480
Haiti's like right next to the Dominican. So you're pretty much Spanish and I'm like

1151
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,480
Oh my god

1152
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,960

1155
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:28,760
And it's all so hard because I because I worked at my job for so long and we have a very large Spanish speaking population

1156
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:34,440
Um, I do know quite a bit of Spanish and I can kind of usually follow along to what people are saying

1157
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:35,960
so

1158
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:39,720
She would slip into Spanish and I would just respond in English and so she's like

1159
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,600
She looked at me and said you're fucking lying to me

1160
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:47,960

1196
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,440

Any relation to Rodney copper? No

1234
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:31,080

01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:36,680
Distant related to mr. Hopps and lola bunny

And all other bunny vtubers also fall under that sphere

1239
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,960
The auto cast fashion one at some point

1240
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:53,960

1241
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,640
I just looked at it

01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,640
Uh, you guys can make your own

1243
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,040

I'll be honest to you. I don't know who my parents are my rtx parents. They're pretty cool

1283
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,200
But my uh 2d parents. I don't really know too much about them

I kind of try to ignore it that jessica rabbit is my mom and that she cheated on roger with uh bugs

1287
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,480
Or it's like lola cheated on bugs with roger. I don't know the truth of that

1288
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,040
so I try not to worry about it too much because

1351
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:23,640
It just said it just says in the description fresh from the source like what does that mean?

1352
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:28,920
Sorry, I can't elaborate on the drink menu. You'll have to talk to my superior

1353
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:33,800
Okay, uh, I guess I'll just have a normal drink then

1354
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,400
What drink did you want?

1355
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:43,880
Uh, pricey or drink could increase a pricey or drink can increase my likability with the fuck

1356
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:49,240
Uh

1357
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:54,760
Can I I don't have to use my arrows. Where's the sound? Oh my headphones are turned off

1358
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,320
I

1359
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,960
Feel like it if you spend a bag

1360
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,880
Um

1361
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:11,800
Oh wait, I have to use these which are the most expensive drink on the menu

1362
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,760
Jesus fuck

1363
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,640
You

1364
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,800
Bunny trap

1365
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,080
I'll take the house lemon sour

1366
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,640
Oh, so the emmy nade

1367
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,640
Yeah, whatever

1368
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,640
I want to drink something too

1369
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,960
I have to buy you a drink

1370
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:44,120
Is this what?

1371
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:51,160
Like bars are like like some bars are in japan because like I've never been to like a maid cafe or like any of that stuff again. I'm very

1372
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,200
I don't have a sort of thing in america

1373
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:01,080
Cabaret bars it's a hostess club. Yeah, we don't have those around

1374
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:10,840
That's really actually I'm like thinking I'm like wait, it'd be a good job. It's like hooters except they buy you drinks

1375
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:18,760
If you don't drink them to drinks, they will pour what if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced

1376
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,400
Because if you're like hanging out and drinking with people all the time

1377
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:29,400
Like if like you have five customers and they just keep buying you drinks

1378
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:37,560
Like are you limited to like one customer or like what is how does what's the I need an explanation here?

1379
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:46,520
Actually, yeah, I remember someone said they were like trying to make a vtuber hostess bar that would actually be really fucking cool

1380
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:49,240
Like do like hologram Miku

1381
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,560
Except make it a vtuber 3d model

1382
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:57,000
And I will gladly sit and have a drink with you and then I'll probably die because I can't handle. I'll call that will

1383
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,960
um

1384
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:05,400
I'll buy you some a special highball

1385
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:11,640
Actually, you're a nice lady. I'm gonna buy you a fine wine

1386
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh, this is great. I love this

1387
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:22,360
Whoa, uh, hello

1388
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,320
I can zoom

1389
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,960
I

1390
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,960
Can get give them presents holy shit

1391
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:48,200
So being a host a hostess bar is literally like

1392
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:55,000
Being a girlfriend in a hoe without the sex and you just got to be nice to people

1393
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:59,240
I would be so fucking good at that

1394
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,680
Because like I have a very nice and charismatic personality

1395
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:07,240
Just saying look it. There's a couple of you guys here. Hmm

1396
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,640

No, because like

1400
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:21,000
Fendom like that. Usually the doms only take they don't give

1401
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:25,240
Velvet queen tipped 127 dollars

1402
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,360

01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:45,240
I'm really talking about

1407
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:50,440
I'm looking I'm getting panty shots and people are giving me a hundred bucks. What's wrong with it? There's something wrong with this picture

1408
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:57,080
Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm doing a little heart. I'm doing a little heart little signing. Yay for you

1409
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,840
They bought me a drink. It was a very expensive drink. Thank you

1410
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:05,240
Uh

1411
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,880
How do I zoom

1412
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:19,960
I'm like fucking uh, uh, I can't even remember the meme. I just want to zoom

1413
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:27,400
Uh, it's chat. Did you even tell me your name? I'm getting kind of nervous

1414
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:31,880
I mean, it's going to be the first time I meet this next customer

1415
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:33,480
My heart

1416
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:37,160
You know, I'm right here right like I can hear everything you're saying out lab

1417
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:42,040
My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast is racing. Why are you ignoring me?

1418
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:49,080
Oh, what am I saying? The purpose of this place is to make customers feel relaxed not stressed

1419
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:53,960
Yeah, but you're stressing me out because you're acting fucking crazy talking to yourself

1420
01:52:54,760 --> 01:53:00,200
If I'm in a state like this, I'm sure the customer is going to feel the same. Come on now. You've got this

1421
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,160
Bitch, what the fuck are you on?

1422
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:08,680
Sorry, I'm schizophrenic. Okay. Let's start off with the reasonable. Huh?

1423
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:14,600
The first step in the order is to become friends. You're the customer. So please go right ahead with everything you've got

1424
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:18,680
You can't see what I'm doing. So I'm taking my arm

1425
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:23,480
I'm throwing it over my shoulder. I'm throwing it in front of myself like I have a giant cock

1426
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,800
That's my first step

1427
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:32,600
You like what you see

1428
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,720
Huh

1429
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,880
I mean

1430
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,440
She said hit show me what you got so I showed her what I got

1431
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,600
You know, you're fine. Don't worry about it

1432
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:56,600
I hurt my elbow. Um, oh my god

1433
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:59,560
She's my words carefully

1434
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,320
A little bit of hug

1435
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:07,960
What no hug there's a dude at my job that would do that and I fucking hated him

1436
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:14,440
He'd be like, where's my hug? I'm like non-existent. I'm sorry. A customer is calling. Bye. Like

1437
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,400
I'm sorry. If you do that to girls, you're fucking annoying

1438
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:20,360
Where my hug at?

1439
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,720
And then sometimes

1440
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:28,520
Because like for me so I have OCD and certain like

1441
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,400
feelings and like pressure

1442
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,640
and textures

1443
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:35,640
Maybe I'm just autistic. Um

1444
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:42,680
Really bother me. I don't like to be hugged too much unless I really like like you or feel like a really close

1445
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:46,440
family member or family friend or my parents

1446
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,080
Like I literally will only let like

1447
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:50,840
Salem and olive

1448
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:53,320
And my parents hug me and my family members

1449
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:59,160
Well, like when like because I'll say like people are like really touchy feely

1450
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:03,240
And like I don't know like I'm just not like that

1451
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,600
um

1452
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:12,280
Yeah, I'm sorry physical touch is not my love language naturally as a dom. It's it's acts of service

1453
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:16,040
So get on your knees and eat this kushi kuchi. Um

1454
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Um

1455
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,520
Madam desires service

1456
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:29,400
I need a bell. I need a bell to ring. Do I have a bell? I know I have a fucking bell

1457
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:35,960
Well, it's not a bell actually it's I think it's my candle snuffer

1458
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Snuffing see where it is

1459
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,080
But it like sounds like a bell

1460
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:49,480
Oh, it's not dinging

1461
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Usually makes a ding noise

1462
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,480
Damn it

1463
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,640
Madam requires dick

1464
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:05,320
Dick act as once just imagine bell noises. Okay. Thank you

1465
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,280
Hmm

1466
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:18,360
Or kuchi we don't discriminate in this household, okay

1467
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,640
So a toast or something

1468
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,600
So a toast or something

1469
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:29,640
That's what I just fucking said

1470
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:36,360
That's the spirit you seem eager to start drinking but don't you think sharing each other's names comes first?

1471
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:42,280
Well by the little bar that's next to your body. I can kind of surmise your name is kana or kana or

1472
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:45,880
Can I eat your pussy out tonight?

1473
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:47,720
What?

1474
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,720
Never mind

1475
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:52,120
Anyways, I'd love to know more about you

1476
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:56,760
Right. My name is haito kana. Yeah kanda

1477
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:03,400
I will butcher butcher japanese names. I apologize to my japanese friends

1478
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,200
The vod staying up

1479
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:10,440
relax the vod staying up

1480
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:13,160
relax, oh

1481
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:18,200
I just remembered because I just see I see someone with ochi marks in their name that aren't mine

1482
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:21,480
Fuck you first of all, but I don't really blame you because um

1483
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,080
My ochi marks don't work

1484
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,640
on youtube so

1485
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:31,000
We're gonna do a quick tangent when I say quick. I mean 30 minutes

1486
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,880
um

1487
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,200
I was gonna suggest that we pick some that are youtube friendly

1488
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:44,840
The shit we're missing every free guy interaction see that um

1489
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:50,280
Only 30 that's optimistic. Hey, hey

1490
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:56,920
Slow your fucking roll kid. Okay. Don't disrespect me in my own households

1491
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:03,880
Arobin, but yeah, but yeah, I know mercies don't like mercies scissors don't work

1492
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,320
So I'm your vote is a snail in a tongue

1493
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,800
Yeah, I see yeah polar bear doesn't work

1494
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:21,960
But like bear and ice cube makes sense that works. Oh

1495
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:29,880
Since the bunny works I will be bold and suggest the heel and the other bunny

1496
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,360
But the bunny doesn't work

1497
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:43,480
Is it the bunny face because the bunny like body doesn't work

1498
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:53,480
But like try to put the because like you know like you look at my um

1499
01:58:55,160 --> 01:59:00,360
Um my old videos I had the rope in the bunny in my title. I might have taken it out actually

1500
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,760
They don't show up. They just show up as squares

1501
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:07,720
So I think the bunny head would work and then the high-heeled shoe would work

1502
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,520
Bunny twins in an act

1503
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,960
That's just the shining

1504
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:26,680
No, it was the it was the it's the the bunny with the body and the rope they both don't work

1505
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,160
Is it device to shoot? No

1506
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:40,520
Because that's the second one you posted nugget isn't an emote actually like a like a normal emo. I don't think

1507
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,080
Okay, here let's let's do this together

1508
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,000
I'll put some in your fucking name then we'll see

1509
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:57,880
What a fitting game all right now I have to pick them

1510
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,600
Yeah, can you even test the working chat? Yeah, looks like see the working chat

1511
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:05,880
But if you put them in your name doesn't work

1512
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:12,360
Oshie mark can just be the membership icon. You mean the gimp bunny? I don't

1513
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,360
No

1514
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:21,400
No, but no I want Oshie marks. I'm not settling

1515
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:25,960
A bunny in vomit

1516
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:31,640
You fall for that a bunny and a knife. I'm not I would say probably a heart and a knife for mercy

1517
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,400
I'm gonna say

1518
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:39,800
The gunny if you will is there there's only a pistol. I wish I wish they had like this water pistol

1519
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:41,800
I wish they had the old gun

1520
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,600
I use this account for normal stuff though

1521
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,560
Well, that's too fucking bad

1522
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:54,920
I'm not changing my Oshie marks like this is the only specific to actually, you know what?

1523
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:02,680
Until membership's open if you want to show your support and show that you're a harem member

1524
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:05,080
You can put just the red high-heeled shoe in your name

1525
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:07,640
So I don't think anybody uses that

1526
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,040
I said yeah, the red high-heeled shoe would be cool

1527
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,560
Because I think there's the red high-heel shoe works

1528
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:17,640
And then like some bunny doesn't even that can just be anybody

1529
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,880
Yeah, yeah

1530
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:30,200
Yeah bunny head red heel pig

1531
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:38,120
Yeah, whatever fucking one works, but just the red heel definitely because that one's obvious

1532
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:43,960
Some body what's told me a rat

1533
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:48,200
That would be more in me she got rats

1534
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:56,360
Yeah, so you can do you can do a heel and whatever your heart desires

1535
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:01,160
What's an Oshie mark? I like to explain it as imagine. It's a cutie mark

1536
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:04,120
Of your favorite vtuber, but what's a cutie mark?

1537
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:08,280
It's a little symbol that shows aspects of the pony's personality

1538
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:16,920
For example twilight sparkle. She's purplish like twilight and there's a sparkler name. So it's like a purply sparkle sparkle on her punch

1539
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,280
I've always said that Oshie marks are just cutie marks

1540
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:32,920
Did you put a red heel in a pregnant man?

1541
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:38,040
That was good. That was fucking good. They got me

1542
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:43,960
Hmm so pop rocks to eat

1543
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,640
I'm

1544
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,200
Boomi's looking at me like what the fuck are you doing?

1545
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:03,480
Good night

1546
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,400
No, there's this I think there's a setting just to like put it in your name like your display name

1547
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,800
Only if you want to

1548
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:23,640
Oh, look at you guys with your bunny heel. Oh, it makes me happy

1549
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:28,760
Oh my god, that makes me so happy

1550
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,200
I'll I'll add it to my description

1551
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,240
Like if you want to show your support

1552
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:40,200
Here are the youtube Oshie marks and I'll just put like the bunny in the heel

1553
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,640
He'll in a nose

1554
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:47,400
Cool

1555
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:49,640
My day is made

1556
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:53,000
Bro, I was so productive today. I went to the doctor's office

1557
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:56,600
I paid some bills. I still haven't done my dishes

1558
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:03,000
I picked up my mail my packages. I'm streaming

1559
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:06,600
I got lunch

1560
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:14,840
I'm feeling good today. I napped for 30 minutes. It was more like 15

1561
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:19,480
These pop rocks are so fucking good

1562
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:22,360
I'm adulting

1563
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:26,120
Can you play the game now, please? Can you please play the game?

1564
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:30,040
Shabby shabby, shut the fuck up

1565
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:36,280
The big kids are talking the big kids the adults are talk

1566
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,680
I just choked in a pop almost a pop socket pop rock

1567
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:44,360
Suck my left titty anyways

1568
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:50,680
You don't need to keep looking at me like that. There's a k pop rocks are awful

1569
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,520
Nobody asked

1570
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:59,080
Did anyone ask what is that? Oh, nobody asked. That's crazy. Anyways

1571
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:04,600
I'm more of a writing F

1572
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:08,120
You don't need to keep looking at me like that

1573
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:13,960
Oh, sorry. I wanted to remember your name and face you see

1574
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:18,120
So well, I look like the other two guys in this place. I'm just

1575
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
a black void

1576
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,120
If yeah, I know but you know

1577
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:31,640
There's no need to worry. I've matched your face to your name now, but I look I'm an unlockable character

1578
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:34,280
Okay, it's my turn now

1579
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:39,320
All right, my name's conna. I don't mind if you give me a nickname, but I sure you hope to

1580
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:41,960
Yeah

1581
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:43,960
All right, I'll call you conty

1582
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:47,480
Because you're con you talk to yourself a lot

1583
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:52,360
I'll do my best to match your name to your face then conna chan. Yeah

1584
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:58,760
Gonna come on her chin. What was that? Oh, so conna chan

1585
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:02,680
Hey, stop it. You're making me all flustered

1586
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:09,880
I I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at. Well, you got massive fucking jugs

1587
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,440
so

1588
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:15,720
I suppose there's some things you learn from firsthand experience

1589
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:19,480
Yep, I guess I got a little smarter from this whole situation

1590
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:25,000
What are you talking about? Well, tell me more about yourself. Hi to come

1591
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:31,480
I messed up real bad at work recently and because of that the boss fired me

1592
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:36,360
So I've been assisting a friend. It is I wonder what you did for his job. Like, what did he fuck up?

1593
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:42,520
If you ever knew a compilation of streams this will definitely make it

1594
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:57,720
It's more like you're not you're cleaning and not making more dirty dishes to clean dishes up. Yeah, it's because like I had dishes and dishwasher

1595
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:01,480
I still need to take them out and put the other dishes away and then put the new ones in the dishwasher

1596
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:08,280
So someone's sandwich probably forgot to use MLA format. That's what I'm going with

1597
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,760
I need more

1598
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,840
My god, I really like the like

1599
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:19,800
like the

1600
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:24,440
Stuff coming from the ceiling that the uh all the drinks are on that's actually really fucking cool like the

1601
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:27,400
The place in here is pretty sick

1602
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:29,320
Oh, that sounds rough

1603
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:31,320
Anyways, want to buy me another drink?

1604
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:34,920
If I was in your shoes, I probably wouldn't even be able to eat

1605
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:37,720
You should just kill yourself

1606
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:41,240
I

1607
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:48,840
What uh, though, I sorry. I meant to say though. I'm sure words can't express how awful you must feel. I'm so sorry

1608
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:51,880
Did you just tell me to kill me? No

1609
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:53,880
Silly

1610
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:55,880
All right. I got it

1611
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:59,960
I'm going to do my absolute best in order for you to get back on your feet

1612
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,640
What the fuck are you gonna do? Are you gonna give me a job?

1613
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,200
Oh

1614
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:11,160
The time you spend here will be I'm gonna ignore that the time you spend here will be a constant smile

1615
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:13,560
I can assure you that much

1616
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,440
I hope we get a long haitoku

1617
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:18,920
Can you keep drinking haitoku?

1618
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:23,160
Don't push yourself. Okay. I have like five other guys. I need to hang out with

1619
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:25,960
And we're gonna get some burgers and fries later

1620
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I can't should I keep talking to her

1621
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:36,600
I

1622
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,920
This game sucks, dude

1623
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:53,960
No, no, that's funny. Okay

1624
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:58,520
Wow, is it already this late? I'll head back home

1625
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:02,440
Jesus fuck

1626
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,640
Thank you for today. See you soon

1627
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,240
Yeah, thanks for everything. See you soon

02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:53,080
Um, well right now I'm an assisting and acquaintance with their job

1961
02:36:55,400 --> 02:36:57,400
But until recently

1962
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:03,240
Charlie spurting Charlie dollars and 20 cents. It's too late. I wear an eye patch

1963
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:08,280
L and my medical bills are astronomical. I think the prayer is too late

1964
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:12,600
Jesus fuck

1965
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:17,080
I'm sorry. I hope I hope that can be recovered for you

1966
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:21,400
So far

1967
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:27,240
Uh

1968
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:30,600
Uh, stop. Yeah, stop the fucking

1969
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:35,240
Are you a toxic or a pirate bro? You're so fucking out of pocket for that

1970
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:39,480
Honestly, uh eye patches are badass though

1971
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:43,640
Like there's like this one like governor. I think of in america that was a former, um

1972
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:45,400
It's like a military veteran

1973
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:48,760
And he wears an eye patch and he looks fucking cool and you can pretend you're solid snake sometimes

1974
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,400
so

1975
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:54,600
That's good. I hope it goes well

1976
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:56,200
Thank you for the the tip

1977
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:58,200
Let me just scratch my nose

1978
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:05,640
But until recently I was implanted company. However, do you know a plethora of mistakes? I was terminated

1979
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:08,600
Is there even a word for plethora in japanese?

1980
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:15,000
Hang on hi tan. I can't keep up with all that formal speech stopping a fucking weirdo

1981
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:18,280
I'd be super grateful if you could just like talk normally

1982
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,600
It's like what is this?

1983
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:22,600
I'm moving my hands around you can't tell

1984
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:25,560
Yes, it's called plethora

1985
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:28,840
Oh really, I'll drop the pretenses then

1986
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:32,040
Thank you. You're such a nice guy. Hi chum

1987
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:37,560
Even if you're too formal and weird sometimes it's their loss for firing you you're better off without them

1988
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:42,760
No, they treated me pretty well, but I'm kidding by okay now

1989
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,720
I won the gamble the other day and I did well

1990
02:38:46,600 --> 02:38:52,600
Wow, you're really something hi tan. You don't badmouth them even after getting fired. I respect that

1991
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:55,160
You know you're for real for real

1992
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:59,720
No cap facts. No printer ink. What the fuck did you just say?

1993
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:02,840
You're a stand-up guy. You must get that a lot, huh?

1994
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:11,160
I don't get that at all they do let me hear some more

1995
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:15,800
Let me hear some more. I need you to feed can you feed my ego?

1996
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:18,520
You feed my ego, please

1997
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:26,120
You're such a kind upstanding person. Hi chan. It's true. I just met you. We've only talked once

1998
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:31,320
You're really kind of fucking weird, but sure. You know, you are so kind

1999
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:33,880
in upstanding

2000
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:35,720
I already said that

2001
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:39,400
You already said that. Yeah, but you're kind and upstanding. Okay

2002
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:45,480
Oh, hey, let me tell you something. I'm serious. Well, I'm always serious, but I'm seriously

2003
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,120
serious

2004
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:50,120
Are you okay?

2005
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:54,760
Meeting new people is really important right in life. I mean online, you know

2006
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:00,040
So I'm really grateful to have met you hi chan

2007
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:05,080
And maybe far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I can

2008
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:07,240
Hope you're ready

2009
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:09,240
I'm gonna sit on your face

2010
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:10,760
Oh, what?

2011
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:13,000
Um, sorry. I didn't mean to say that ellipses

2012
02:40:14,600 --> 02:40:17,720
How embarrassing what am I saying sit on your face?

2013
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:24,040
That was so forward of me. Um, well you get the idea. Did you catch all that? I'm not saying it again

2014
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:26,600
I'm gonna sit on your face

2015
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:32,040
By the way, the other girls here will also sit on your face and they're really nice too. I think you'll like this shop a lot

2016
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:39,240
If you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few times feel free to slide

2017
02:40:39,400 --> 02:40:42,200
Up to the next row and set or you can have us both at once

2018
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:49,320
I'm not the type of girl who's bothered by that sort of thing to be you know

2019
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:53,640
With another girl and a guy I'm I'm bi, you know

2020
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:55,960
I'm pretty fluid

2021
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:57,960
I don't believe in labels actually

2022
02:40:58,520 --> 02:41:01,320
Uh, can you can we change the subject fine?

2023
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:07,000
Well on the other hand if you do find that I'm your type it'd make me pretty happy

2024
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:09,240
Uh, well, I'll leave it at that

2025
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:12,840
So like do you want to have a threesome or?

2026
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:17,640
Uh, I I didn't pay for that kind of service

2027
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:23,080
It's on the house. Just say fucking yes. I don't think I'm comfortable with that

2028
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:26,120

Hmm

2057
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:41,000
Now it's my time to rest up and recover. This is the only place that can heal my mind

2058
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:48,920

Um, what drink did you want?

02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:58,200
Um, we don't do that store to service here. This place fucking blows

2088
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:02,200
Where's my happy ending?

2089
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:06,120
What good would I be if I couldn't put on a smile? I'm ignoring that

2090
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:08,360
Hmm

2091

Yeah, my neighbors are walking by you actually don't look like you're feeling so great yourself

2092

Really I'm feeling fine physically today and I don't have any problems

You look shitty. It's all I'm gonna say buddy. Did you shower?

2094
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:25,640
You smell like you haven't showered

02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:28,760
You sure nope, but you're definitely not feeling good

2096
02:46:29,480 --> 02:46:31,480
Not at all

2097
02:46:31,480 --> 02:46:33,960
This is a bad omen, you know

02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:35,960
Get it today's fortune

2099
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:41,960
You know would make the the bad omen go away if you buy me a better drink

2100
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:45,640
Or some sushi

2101
02:46:46,120 --> 02:46:49,800
Or if you have that threesome I keep talking to you about you know, I never mind you smell bad

02:48:22,840 --> 02:48:25,240
Like I don't want us free threesome bra. I'm like

2124
02:48:25,800 --> 02:48:30,280
Uber uncomfortable with that. Oh like I don't want a threesome bra

2125
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:35,320
I'm like uber uncomfortable with that. I only do threesome with my bros

2126
02:48:36,280 --> 02:48:38,280
We Eiffel tower

2127
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:40,200
Each other

2128
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:41,160
Huh?

2129
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:43,160
Nothing. It's kanda

2130
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:47,960
Right, but what I want to know is your first name

2131
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:54,600
I don't think I called you by your first name last time. You literally gave me a female honorific

2132
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
because you're a bitch

2133
02:48:57,480 --> 02:49:03,880
First the characters for cup in person then dry in field. That's how you spell haito kanda. Remember now

2134
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:09,800
You got me, huh? I totally forgot your name. I'm really sorry

2135
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:12,760
Okay, I found a way online

2136
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:15,160
I'm one of those

2137
02:49:15,160 --> 02:49:18,840
Oh my god, witch talk is so helpful to learn someone's name after you forget it

2138
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:22,360
It's said to offer to tell their fortune with it clever, huh?

2139
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:26,440
But how did you figure it out? Was it acting suspicious?

2140
02:49:29,720 --> 02:49:31,720
These girls are annoying me

2141
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:38,920
You seem like the type of person who can't tell a lie french hand, but you kind of just technically lied by a mission

2142
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:42,120
It was written all your face how you were acting

2143
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:46,360
I get it people usually tell me they can read me like an open book

2144
02:49:48,280 --> 02:49:52,200
I live honestly. It's so tiring to cover up stuff with lies

2145
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:56,440
It's easier just to be honest and then apologize when you get scolded

2146
02:49:57,720 --> 02:50:03,640
I'm sorry. Hi Chan. You told me your name, but I forgot it and then I tried to pull the wool over your eyes

2147
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:06,280
I'm really sorry. So, um

2148
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
What are you gonna do to make up for it?

2149
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:11,880
What do you mean?

2150
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:16,440
I'd like my happy ending, please. I'd like to order one happy ending

2151
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:19,400
Get on your knees

2152
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:21,400
Come on

2153
02:50:21,400 --> 02:50:25,000
No, I I I can't we're at work and I I'm asking politely

2154
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:28,600
I know where you live

2155
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:31,800
Oh, okay. Can I do it later?

2156
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:33,800

2157
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:36,120

2164
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:20,360
I don't think it was kaito. I said hi, though

2165
02:51:26,920 --> 02:51:29,720
I never thought I wanted to be in top of this game, but here we are

Scare you it's good. You should be scared. It's all right to bother me at all

For real. Yay. Well, then let's get back and have some fun

2175

2186
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:20,120

2195
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:02,200
I'll head back home

2196
02:54:05,560 --> 02:54:07,560
Bigger when you pull on it

2197
02:54:08,840 --> 02:54:11,800
Thank you for today. I have to brush my teeth

2198
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:14,920
Taste it like cigarettes. See you soon

2199
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:22,200
Yeah, thanks for everything. Didn't even get to come. See you soon

2200
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:32,200
Oh fuck

2201
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:36,280
Oh, you know what this means

2202
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:41,720
I wish this had more banger music. This is not a banger music guys

2203
02:54:54,840 --> 02:55:01,720
Okay, sometimes the eyes glow and sometimes they don't when it's red it means I lost. Oh fuck. Uh, we're gonna do it again

2204
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:08,360
We got we got money to spend. Oh when it glows one eye, we win. I'm pretty sure and it turns white

2205
02:55:11,320 --> 02:55:15,800
Or not it does not oh, I did win. Yeah

2206
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:19,960
Let's do it again

2207
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:25,480
It's not more impressive when you measure in millimeters. I lost again

2208
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:27,480
Oh

2209
02:55:27,720 --> 02:55:33,640
Baby a triple all baby a triple three dollars and thirty three cents. Thank you razz nuts

2210
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:37,320
Just a tip. Thank you for the tip. Thank you for the tip

2211
02:55:38,520 --> 02:55:40,520
All right lost again

God damn it

2213
02:55:43,240 --> 02:55:45,240
I won

2214
02:55:47,080 --> 02:55:48,360
All right, I didn't win that much though

2215
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:53,800
Okay, if you get the one red glowing eye and white screen you win big

2216
02:55:53,800 --> 02:55:58,040
But if you just get a no glowing eyes and white screen you kind of win a little bit

2217
02:55:59,640 --> 02:56:03,560
But if you get two glowing red eyes you lost badly and if you get

2218
02:56:04,360 --> 02:56:06,360
no glowing red eyes

2219
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:08,600
Uh

2220
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:10,600
You lost

2221
02:56:11,480 --> 02:56:14,440
Small amount one red glowing eyes lost like a medium amount. Okay

I know I'm not gonna game the system. Fuck that

2227
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:36,920
We're not gaming the system. I didn't read that. It's fine

2228
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:41,880

If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this I swear I didn't put razors in them. I swear

2242
02:57:47,160 --> 02:57:50,680
Just don't look just close your eyes when you eat them. Uh, I hope you like it

2243
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:54,520
Wow, thanks, I'll take care of

2244
02:58:08,840 --> 02:58:10,840
How those get in there

2245
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:16,440
Why did you put razors in this

2246
02:58:17,720 --> 02:58:19,720
You good did nobody get my bit

2247
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:24,440
They weren't paying attention. Um, you seem happy. Did something happen?

2248
02:58:25,960 --> 02:58:27,960
Did you guys think I actually hurt myself?

2249
02:58:29,400 --> 02:58:31,400
Well, you came all this way to oh, sorry

2251
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:41,080
Thanks, but you seem much happier than usual

2252
02:58:42,200 --> 02:58:44,360
I'm not I just swallowed a razor, but

2253
02:58:45,240 --> 02:58:47,240
We have medical concerns. I'll be okay

2254
02:58:48,040 --> 02:58:52,520
Um, maybe it's because I really got some time to relax during my time off recently

2255
02:58:53,720 --> 02:58:55,880
You used your days off to the fullest then

2256
02:58:58,120 --> 02:59:00,120
Did you go shopping?

2257
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:03,640
I mostly shop online these days

2258
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:06,840
I'm a neat except I need to go

2259
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:09,720
To this job so I can make money

2260
02:59:10,360 --> 02:59:12,360
Because I like to play gotcha

2261
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,320
Why are you telling me all this because you fucking asked?

2262
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:21,160
Um, but sometimes going around different stores and looking at what they have makes me feel super excited

2263
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:23,960
I played with my dog for the whole day less

2264
02:59:27,560 --> 02:59:31,240
Naughty naughty you teasing me naughty naughty

2265
02:59:33,880 --> 02:59:35,880

2266
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:38,920
Bro, oh hi mero

2267
02:59:48,520 --> 02:59:50,520
She plays blue archive

2268
02:59:56,040 --> 03:00:01,880
Hello, hello, mero my sweet little cute

2269
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:09,800
I'll see your golden tree

2270
03:00:10,280 --> 03:00:12,280
Uh-huh. He's a chihuahua

2271
03:00:12,600 --> 03:00:17,640
He's a chihuahua hula called wawa. You mean a chihuahua. Yeah, whatever. He's super cute

2272
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:25,720
And when you call him wawa chin, he waxes tail and comes to you when he sleeps. It's always next to me too

2273
03:00:27,800 --> 03:00:32,920
He loves walks too, so I take him to this really big park near my place whenever I get a day off

2274
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:35,400
That's what we did last time too

2275
03:00:36,840 --> 03:00:38,840
So you just hang out with your dog? Yeah

2276
03:00:39,880 --> 03:00:42,840
That sounds great or whatever. I love dogs too

2277
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:48,680
Really? Yeah, I have a husky golden retriever mix

2278
03:00:50,920 --> 03:00:52,920
That's fucked

2279
03:00:53,160 --> 03:00:58,360
Well, I hope you give wawa. Sorry. I hope you give wawa chin a nice pat if you ever come around

2280
03:00:58,760 --> 03:01:01,800
I'm sure you'll end up enjoying this company too. No

2281
03:01:02,760 --> 03:01:07,880
Oh, should you blame it on the alcohol?

2282
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:14,760
We know her routine we can go mercy mode now. I know she's she's giving up a lot of information

2283
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:17,880
Oh, no, no, no, no

2284
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:22,520
It's where color is red. Oh my god

2285
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:25,640
Do you think he'd be fine to run? Why are you?

2286
03:01:26,600 --> 03:01:28,600
This is the like the third

2287
03:01:29,160 --> 03:01:32,120
Time I've talked to you and you're like I need to meet my dog

2288
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:38,040
Do you think he'd be fine around me though? I wonder if he'll think I was trying to take his master away from him

2289
03:01:39,160 --> 03:01:40,200
because

2290
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:42,200
I have a question to ask you

2291
03:01:42,760 --> 03:01:44,760
Will you be my master?

2292
03:01:45,880 --> 03:01:47,720
Or my mistress?

2293
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:49,720
What? Never mind

2294
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:52,440
How are those socks?

2295
03:01:53,160 --> 03:01:55,160
You gave them to the other girl. Oh

2296
03:01:56,600 --> 03:01:58,120
Who knows

2297
03:01:58,120 --> 03:02:00,920
That could happen wawa chin loves me so much after all

2298
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:04,120
You're trying to seal me away

2299
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:06,840
Huh, what's wrong?

2300
03:02:07,080 --> 03:02:09,080
I'm just trying to buy your affections

2301
03:02:09,640 --> 03:02:13,320
Uh, nothing at all. I'm feeling a little sweaty right now. Actually

2302
03:02:14,040 --> 03:02:16,040
God, I wonder what's wrong with me

2303
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:19,880
Oh, are you good? Sorry. It's my lush. I mean

2304
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:22,840

03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:30,920

03:02:59,640 --> 03:03:01,800
What's that buzzing noise? Don't worry about it

2313
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:08,440

2316
03:03:33,240 --> 03:03:35,240

2317
03:03:35,320 --> 03:03:37,320
Um

2318
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:44,440
Okay, there's not a lot to do in this game and it's kind of annoying

2319
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:49,720
I'm like, uh, okay. So I get them gifts. I talk. Is that really it?

2320
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:55,800

Okay

03:04:07,720 --> 03:04:12,520
Okay, okay. My stride is totally wrong then usually I thought the thing would give an indicator, but it really doesn't

2326
03:04:21,880 --> 03:04:23,880

2327
03:04:31,560 --> 03:04:33,560

Finally

03:05:55,800 --> 03:06:00,120
I guess the point is to lift the fantasy of having your life ruined by hostess club addiction

2345
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:03,240
All right

2346
03:06:03,240 --> 03:06:05,240
One voice

2347
03:06:05,400 --> 03:06:06,680
One voice

2348
03:06:06,680 --> 03:06:08,680
One voice to you governor

2349
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:12,600

03:06:19,080 --> 03:06:21,000
Sporty tomboy

03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:26,360
Mommy vibe smoker voice sexy as possible voice. She's very coup d'etre really

2353
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:30,680
Nerdy voice mommy

2354
03:06:31,240 --> 03:06:34,440
Theater attitude is like first. Okay. We'll chat a little bit. I'm gonna give her a present

2355
03:06:36,040 --> 03:06:40,200
Actually, no, I'm not gonna give it her just yet. I'll give her I might extend my time with her

2356
03:06:41,800 --> 03:06:43,800
Because I've talked to them the most the other two girls

2357
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:47,400
Want to get some food

2358
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:49,480

03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:02,840
Oh, hello. Nice to meet you

2362
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:05,800
Would you like to introduce yourself?

2363
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:10,120
Oh, yeah, you may call me hi to kanda

2364
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:13,320
Oh

2365
03:07:13,320 --> 03:07:15,320
You don't have to be polite with me

2366
03:07:16,200 --> 03:07:22,280
Oh, I see. I mean, okay. I'm hi to kanda. I helped my friend for work

2367
03:07:23,080 --> 03:07:25,080
I didn't ask that

2368
03:07:25,320 --> 03:07:27,320
You help your friends like

2369
03:07:28,600 --> 03:07:30,600
With a hand job

2370
03:07:31,880 --> 03:07:37,160
Yeah, I was working at a company up until recently but I messed up

2371
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:39,800
It got fired

2372
03:07:39,880 --> 03:07:41,560
fired

2373
03:07:41,560 --> 03:07:43,560
right

2374
03:07:44,520 --> 03:07:46,520
Are you bad at holding conversation

2375
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:50,520
Are you person of a few words?

2376
03:07:51,720 --> 03:07:54,520
I guess I don't speak much

2377
03:07:56,120 --> 03:07:58,120
Um hi to

2378
03:07:59,080 --> 03:08:01,080
Why do you sound like a fucking robot? Yeah

2379
03:08:02,200 --> 03:08:05,240
I'm oh, I just spilled apple sauce on my shirt

2380
03:08:08,840 --> 03:08:10,840
It's choked on it

2381
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,320
I always hit my head on my mic. I'm falling apart

2382
03:08:15,880 --> 03:08:17,880
I'm sorry

2383
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:20,840
You're kind of a loser

2384
03:08:27,400 --> 03:08:29,400
The guy is a charmer

2385
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:36,120
What does that mean

2386
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:40,280
I'm sorry. I'm like this. Maybe you won't be able to have a good time

2387
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:43,480
It's okay. Who knows what will happen

2388
03:08:43,960 --> 03:08:45,960
You can sign my dick

2389
03:08:46,680 --> 03:08:48,680
I could suck your toes

2390
03:08:49,080 --> 03:08:51,080
You can suck my dick

2391
03:08:51,240 --> 03:08:53,240
Just met each other

2392
03:08:53,240 --> 03:08:55,240
So my dick

2393
03:08:55,400 --> 03:09:00,520
I think would be nice if you could suck my dick. Just take things slow, you know first base

2394
03:09:01,560 --> 03:09:03,160
Sucking my dick

2395
03:09:03,160 --> 03:09:04,680
No rush

2396
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:06,680
We already started to get to know each other

2397
03:09:07,480 --> 03:09:09,480
Oh

2398
03:09:09,480 --> 03:09:11,240
Thank you

2399
03:09:11,240 --> 03:09:13,240
You're kind one. Hi, though

2400
03:09:13,720 --> 03:09:15,720
Do you want some alcohol?

2401
03:09:16,360 --> 03:09:18,920
What should I do? Is there anything I should prepare?

2402
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:22,280
Yeah

2403
03:09:22,840 --> 03:09:27,480
My efforts have been rewarded. I want to drink something delicious

2404
03:09:29,240 --> 03:09:35,160
What drink did you want? I'm giving her like several different voices. I'm so sorry. I'm buying you

2405
03:09:36,840 --> 03:09:38,840
I don't have enough money. Uh

2406
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:42,600
Well, okay, what drink do I want so I will have

2407
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:45,400
I'll just have a beer

2408
03:09:45,400 --> 03:09:50,520
Where's the beer the fuck is the beer? I'll have a beer. I don't know why we have it in these glasses, but

2409
03:09:52,360 --> 03:09:54,360
Can I have a drink with you?

2410
03:09:54,520 --> 03:09:59,320
Yes, my beautiful princess. I'm gonna get you a bunny punch

2411
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:04,680
Because I'm gonna punch my dick into your womb and fill you with children

2412
03:10:07,320 --> 03:10:09,320
I like that. All right

2413
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:16,360
What that's it I expected more

2414
03:10:19,160 --> 03:10:21,160
Deep the deep Riz

2415
03:10:21,800 --> 03:10:23,800
S to your Riz. Thank you

2416
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:26,600
Okay, I have a present for you

2417
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:34,520
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this? I hope you like it

2418
03:10:35,320 --> 03:10:37,320
It smells like my mom

2419
03:10:39,880 --> 03:10:41,880
What don't worry about it

2420
03:10:44,920 --> 03:10:46,920
Okay, thanks

2421
03:10:47,240 --> 03:10:49,240
We have to take care of it

2422
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:51,320
Take care of what?

2423
03:10:51,320 --> 03:10:52,520
Your dick

2424
03:10:52,520 --> 03:10:54,360
Huh?

2425
03:10:54,360 --> 03:10:56,360
What?

2426
03:10:58,520 --> 03:11:00,520
I keep doing double takes to see if this is the time

2427
03:11:05,480 --> 03:11:07,480
Oh

2428
03:11:07,880 --> 03:11:12,120
Why are they just staring at each other and quiet? Oh my god

2429
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:17,800
Wait, wait, you buy a drink for the bartenders. Yes. Yes, you do

2430
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:23,000
This is this is this is a good stream today

2431
03:11:25,560 --> 03:11:32,760
Is there anything you want to talk about? Yeah, uh, you think tomorrow be sunny or whatever

2432
03:11:35,480 --> 03:11:38,280
Um, there's a monsoon raging outside

2433
03:11:41,080 --> 03:11:47,960
I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no idea

2434
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:51,800
Sorry

2435
03:11:53,800 --> 03:11:56,840
Buy a drink for the bartender to take a small sip and throw it into the plants. Oh, yeah

2436
03:11:57,480 --> 03:11:59,800
But like how do they pace themselves? You have to have like

2437
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:01,640
quite

2438
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:05,640
Like you have to be able to handle your liquor if you're serving patrons from let's say like

2439
03:12:06,760 --> 03:12:08,760
Let's say your shift is like five hours

2440
03:12:09,960 --> 03:12:11,960
And maybe you hang out with a guy for each hour

2441
03:12:12,200 --> 03:12:16,520
Like how many people are buying you more drinks? Is this happening? Like I need to know the schematics

2442
03:12:17,640 --> 03:12:19,640
Goofy

2443
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:23,800
Do they really only take one sip?

2444
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:25,960
I

2445
03:12:25,960 --> 03:12:32,520
Are all they're pretty good. No, like legit like tell me the tea is the tea piping hot cuz spill it

2446
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:37,960
You don't drink with every patron. Okay. Do they actually puke constantly?

2447
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:42,760
This is the equivalent of the ghost anime top. I love that fucking dumbest hilarious

2448
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:47,880
It's basically they're tipping they mix it for themselves. They probably don't mix. Oh

2449
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:54,040
Oh, that's true. I because I had a friend actually I don't had a friend. She does this currently olive

2450
03:12:54,280 --> 03:12:58,840
She bartends and she tells me sometimes customers try to buy her a drink and she just literally gives herself

2451
03:12:59,320 --> 03:13:01,960
Like a sprite and says it's a gin and tonic

2452
03:13:03,880 --> 03:13:05,880
Yeah, or they mix the drink of water

2453
03:13:06,680 --> 03:13:09,240
Excuse me hostess. Will you bear my children?

2454
03:13:11,240 --> 03:13:14,520
Like there is a job somewhere in the world that you just get paid to drink that's basis

2455
03:13:14,680 --> 03:13:17,000
That's kind of cool like that. Like I'm like hostess job

2456
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:19,720
That's not bad

2457
03:13:19,720 --> 03:13:21,320
Like does it pay well?

2458
03:13:21,320 --> 03:13:23,000
you know

2459
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:26,200
Shall we look up the weather forecast because we're fucking nerds

2460
03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:29,560
Are you always curious about the weather?

2461
03:13:31,320 --> 03:13:37,720
I just want to know how wet you're gonna be tomorrow. Uh, no, not really. I'm just making small talk

2462
03:13:40,680 --> 03:13:43,480
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean anything by that

2463
03:13:44,680 --> 03:13:48,280
This is who I am all the time. Is that okay with you?

2464
03:13:49,480 --> 03:13:51,480
Can you please marry me?

2465
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:56,680
It's all right with me. So please marry me. I'm on my knees. Please. I'm begging

2466
03:13:57,560 --> 03:13:59,880
We're just starting to get into each other, but you're my life

2467
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:03,800
You're a peculiar one

2468
03:14:03,880 --> 03:14:05,640

2469
03:14:05,640 --> 03:14:10,840
You laughed just now. Didn't you that means you should marry me? I also know where you live. I know where all the girls here live

2470
03:14:10,840 --> 03:14:12,840
Okay

2471
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:16,520
You have a cute smile, especially when you're sleeping

2472
03:14:17,480 --> 03:14:18,520
What?

2473
03:14:18,520 --> 03:14:20,040

2474
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:21,720

Thanks

2476
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:27,640
What will you do? Are you still going to drink? Should I prepare some more alcohol?

2477
03:14:28,520 --> 03:14:30,280
Yeah

2478
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:32,520
Thank you. It means you'll still be with me

2479
03:14:33,560 --> 03:14:35,560
What drink did you want?

2480
03:14:35,640 --> 03:14:38,840
Uh, can I get like absolutely black? Oh, I can only have three drinks. Okay

2481
03:14:39,160 --> 03:14:41,160

I'll have some wine for chip. We're hanging out

2483
03:14:49,560 --> 03:14:53,480
Beer before liquor never been sicker liquor before beer you're in the clear

2484
03:14:55,160 --> 03:14:58,680
Can I have a drink with you? Of course you can girly pop

Only the best for my queen

2487
03:15:05,240 --> 03:15:07,240
I'm so happy. I'll get the bottle

2488
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:10,840
Oh

2489
03:15:14,200 --> 03:15:17,640
Oh, I got enough cash. Yeah, I got fucking enough cash

2490
03:15:21,320 --> 03:15:24,760
You're by the 50k you had bought all that ending. Let's chat

2491
03:15:28,600 --> 03:15:31,880
Are you having fun? She looks so fucking pissed off right now

2492
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:38,520
Yeah, why are you looking at me like that? No, I think I'm enjoying myself. Please stop looking at me like that

2493
03:15:39,240 --> 03:15:41,240
Good. Well, that's nice

2494
03:15:42,200 --> 03:15:44,600
Muka Chen, are you enjoying yourself?

2495
03:15:46,520 --> 03:15:52,360
Still undecided. You kind of smell bad. I would rather be hanging out with the people over there

2496
03:15:53,640 --> 03:15:56,840
They actually buy me the 50k and bottle

2497
03:15:58,040 --> 03:16:00,040
But it's whatever

2498
03:16:01,240 --> 03:16:03,240
I don't exactly hate it

2499
03:16:03,240 --> 03:16:07,240
Why don't you hate it?

2500
03:16:09,960 --> 03:16:11,960
Is that it? I don't even know why I asked that

2501
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:14,520
She's looking at us like we're garbage

2502
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:18,120
You kind of gross me out and you kind of disgust me

2503
03:16:19,560 --> 03:16:24,520
I would rather not hang out with trash like you, but I need to pay the bills

2504
03:16:25,400 --> 03:16:27,400
So here I am

2505
03:16:29,960 --> 03:16:31,960
I don't know

2506
03:16:33,640 --> 03:16:35,400
I wonder why

2507
03:16:35,400 --> 03:16:36,920
um

2508
03:16:36,920 --> 03:16:38,680
Huh

2509
03:16:38,680 --> 03:16:44,520
I don't believe you. Hi, though. Are you really enjoying it? Why are these girls gaslighting me?

2510
03:16:46,200 --> 03:16:48,680
They literally like I'm fine and they're like you're not okay

2511
03:16:49,480 --> 03:16:51,480
Tell me what's wrong

2512
03:16:51,480 --> 03:16:53,480
Give me your money

2513
03:16:53,880 --> 03:16:55,800
And buy me a drink

2514
03:16:55,800 --> 03:16:58,120
And I'll pretend to cheer you up. So when you come here

2515
03:16:58,760 --> 03:17:02,440
You think you're getting you're think you're getting serotonin and dopamine from only me

2516
03:17:02,680 --> 03:17:06,200
So then you have to come and then you have to spend more money to feel like you're okay

2517
03:17:06,440 --> 03:17:11,160
Because you need me to tell you when you're okay or not. This is toxic as hell

2518
03:17:17,240 --> 03:17:20,440
This is a scyop. This is a fucking scyop

2519
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,400
Just I don't know how but it is

2520
03:17:28,680 --> 03:17:33,320
Haha, it's okay. You don't have to worry about me

2521
03:17:35,080 --> 03:17:37,080
I worry though. You're my customer

2522
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:40,040
You must have a good time

2523
03:17:40,440 --> 03:17:42,440
You must have a good time

2524
03:17:43,400 --> 03:17:45,400
Okay, is she an android?

I don't know man. Okay, just just checking. Uh, well everyone enjoys themselves in their own way

2526
03:17:53,080 --> 03:18:01,800
Hmm, I'm not enjoying this. I wish I was doing something else. You're so odd. Did you know that?

2527
03:18:02,920 --> 03:18:04,920
Haha, yeah, I know

2528
03:18:06,840 --> 03:18:08,840

2530
03:18:13,480 --> 03:18:15,480

03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:34,280
I really like your facebook page

2623
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,000
I want to come and see you if I didn't

2624
03:26:38,120 --> 03:26:40,120
It's funny that you think that

2625
03:26:41,400 --> 03:26:46,440
It doesn't even hurt my pictures. It's so funny that it acts. It's actually a little embarrassing

2626
03:26:49,960 --> 03:26:53,480
Thank thanks though those pictures are so embarrassed sometimes

2627
03:26:53,800 --> 03:26:57,160
What freaks me out is the dialogue that I'm dubbing and making up

2628
03:26:57,800 --> 03:27:02,360
Makes sense for their responses. She's like it's so embarrassing like as if

2629
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:04,840
as if he um

2630
03:27:04,840 --> 03:27:07,400
As if she like that was an actual fucking line

2631
03:27:09,800 --> 03:27:11,800
It's so funny

2632
03:27:14,280 --> 03:27:15,400
Hmm

2633
03:27:15,400 --> 03:27:18,600
That thanks though. Did you like the bikini ones?

2634
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:24,760
Huh, I mean anyway, you want us to know about my days off? Let's spin this around. What do you think I do?

2635
03:27:25,720 --> 03:27:27,880
Uh, I feel like you go out shopping

2636
03:27:28,600 --> 03:27:32,440
Go out shopping for clothes. Sorry. Go out shopping for clothes and stuff

2637
03:27:33,160 --> 03:27:36,120
Too bad. I'd like to shop, but I have no money

2638
03:27:37,240 --> 03:27:42,760
Wow, she's me for real for real. So that's why I whore myself out in this buddy garden

2639
03:27:43,720 --> 03:27:51,400
Please can you please take the offer for the threesome? I'm giving you a discount. It's only $150

2640
03:27:52,120 --> 03:27:57,640
Most of the time it's 300 you get two for the price of one. Okay

2641
03:27:58,760 --> 03:28:00,760
I'm not interested

2642
03:28:00,840 --> 03:28:02,040
Whatever

2643
03:28:02,040 --> 03:28:05,400
I went to shop and wait until I find something I really want

2644
03:28:06,120 --> 03:28:08,120
Then I buy it

2645
03:28:08,760 --> 03:28:10,760
But my whole money

2646
03:28:13,160 --> 03:28:15,000
She's planning something

2647
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:18,120
I went to karaoke in front of the station by myself last weekend

2648
03:28:18,520 --> 03:28:23,160
I sang nothing but the songs I wanted to sing myself doesn't everybody fucking do that

2649
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:29,000
I guess you try to pick songs that everyone knows when you go with friends

2650
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:37,480
That oh that t-dos came back up. Oh, then I mentioned it get as a reflux when I have vodka

2651
03:28:40,200 --> 03:28:43,880
Yeah, I like hearing people sing so going with friends is fun too

2652
03:28:44,280 --> 03:28:48,840
Mostly I just go by myself because my friends are in my head. They're TALPAs

2653
03:28:51,320 --> 03:28:53,320
Shut up, Jeff

2654
03:28:53,560 --> 03:28:55,800
Last weekend I wanted to sing a blow off scene

2655
03:28:57,160 --> 03:29:01,640

Obviously not. I don't even know anyone who'd want to I'm a fucking loser

2659
03:29:18,520 --> 03:29:23,240
Oh, yeah, I guess you need two willing participants for that like me and one of the other girls

2660
03:29:23,720 --> 03:29:25,400

2661
03:29:25,400 --> 03:29:26,920

Okay, I'm gonna save and then I'm gonna keep gambling because I want to see like because I feel like

It's gonna be very forgiving

2679
03:31:06,600 --> 03:31:08,600
I

2680
03:31:08,920 --> 03:31:10,920
When you try to gamble with a low amount

2681
03:31:13,480 --> 03:31:17,720
Open the window and a breeze rolls in and I cheers in my pads

2682
03:31:19,080 --> 03:31:22,120
It's barely enough for the bill. I was fine. Oh

03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:25,320
See it doesn't do that much

2684
03:31:26,040 --> 03:31:28,200
300 yen is about like fucking five bucks

2685
03:31:29,800 --> 03:31:32,840
And I went like 50 kn because I'd be sick

I'm helping out my friend now, so it's okay. You don't have to worry about that

I'm not worried. Honestly. I don't care. Oh, oh, okay

2760
03:36:33,720 --> 03:36:35,720
She's just so unbothered

2761
03:36:37,880 --> 03:36:41,560
She only cut she only works this job just to insult her patrons

2762
03:36:41,640 --> 03:36:44,840
She makes plenty of money like she's she's like a trust fund baby

2763
03:36:44,840 --> 03:36:47,800
She just comes here because she has a sick twisted pleasure

her clients

2766
03:36:58,760 --> 03:37:00,760
You must spend your money wisely

2767
03:37:01,320 --> 03:37:03,320
Do you know that I was gambling?

2768
03:37:04,200 --> 03:37:05,880

It's because I'm the only one I am the one don't need the gun to get respect up on the street

I'm the only one my little sister mocha has

2871
03:44:30,600 --> 03:44:34,280
Oh, I didn't know I'm sorry

2872
03:44:36,440 --> 03:44:41,240
Yeah, it's okay. I don't even know why you're apologizing. It's not like you killed them

2873
03:44:42,120 --> 03:44:47,160
Or did you you know, I haven't been able to find my parents killer? Did you fucking do it?

2874
03:44:48,600 --> 03:44:50,280
Hmm

2875
03:44:50,280 --> 03:44:52,280
What?

2876
03:44:52,280 --> 03:44:54,280
Uh, uh

2877
03:44:54,280 --> 03:44:56,280
You must be lonely if it's just you two

2878
03:44:57,000 --> 03:45:02,680
She's Batman. I was the only thing I was gonna make a um

2879
03:45:03,880 --> 03:45:08,280
Make a Batman joke be like wait a second. What are your parents names?

2880
03:45:10,760 --> 03:45:13,240
Martha and I forget the dad's names

2881
03:45:14,600 --> 03:45:16,600
Wayne holy shit

2882
03:45:17,320 --> 03:45:19,320
You must be lonely if it's just you two

2883
03:45:20,680 --> 03:45:23,720
I'm not lonely. I have mocha and my online friends

2884
03:45:23,720 --> 03:45:27,960
So you're the foundation of her life

2885
03:45:29,000 --> 03:45:31,000
So you're like her mom

2886
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:33,000
Does that make you a milf?

2887
03:45:33,000 --> 03:45:33,960
A what?

2888
03:45:33,960 --> 03:45:35,960
Like a milt. Do you know what a milf is?

2889
03:45:36,360 --> 03:45:38,040
No

2890
03:45:38,040 --> 03:45:43,480
Just looking up on her dictionary. Um, okay. Yes. There's nobody else I can turn to

2891
03:45:44,440 --> 03:45:50,120
That's unbelievable. So if I take you on vacation, does your little sister have to come with us or does she just stay home with nobody?

2892
03:45:51,160 --> 03:45:53,160
I just thought of that now is that

2893
03:45:53,720 --> 03:45:55,080
Is that a thing?

2894
03:45:55,080 --> 03:45:59,720
Uh, I admire you for leaving her behind if you do so we can like do stuff

2895
03:46:01,800 --> 03:46:03,800
It's not unbelievable. I just live

2896
03:46:04,680 --> 03:46:06,360
the two of us

2897
03:46:06,360 --> 03:46:08,360
Hideout, do you want to drink a little more?

03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
I'll get you some more if you want. Yes

2899
03:46:12,680 --> 03:46:14,680
I might be a little happy

2900

My ear is itchy

2905
03:46:24,040 --> 03:46:30,120
Does everyone ever use the word mill fire all before yes, I just did just now

2915
03:47:16,520 --> 03:47:18,520
That was a nice color like the lace

2916
03:47:19,080 --> 03:47:23,960
The other girls have fucking boring ass panties. See that's why I like her. She's a freak. She matches my freak

2917
03:47:24,840 --> 03:47:26,840
She may not act like it, but she's a freak

2918
03:47:27,400 --> 03:47:29,400
She's a low-key freak

2919
03:47:30,120 --> 03:47:33,560
You know, she'd be on the grapefruit technique because she a freak that rhymed

2920
03:47:34,440 --> 03:47:35,960
aren't that unique

2921
03:47:35,960 --> 03:47:37,560
anyways

2922
03:47:37,560 --> 03:47:41,320
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this? I hope you like it

2923
03:47:42,040 --> 03:47:44,040
Really? Oh, okay. Thanks

2924
03:47:44,920 --> 03:47:46,920
I was just plain happy

2925
03:47:47,240 --> 03:47:50,040
What do you like talk about your feelings that way?

2926
03:47:51,720 --> 03:47:55,800
What are you talking like and in the past tense?

2927
03:48:00,840 --> 03:48:04,200
I was happy you're not happy now

2928
03:48:06,520 --> 03:48:11,400
Grapefruit patreon audio when uh, I don't think that's not till uh, august or july I can't remember

2929
03:48:11,640 --> 03:48:17,160
I went crazy on that that audio holy holy moly

2930
03:48:19,960 --> 03:48:23,960
Yeah, check out my patreon if you liked what she saw today because then

2931
03:48:25,560 --> 03:48:27,560
When I when we finally open uh

2932
03:48:28,760 --> 03:48:30,760
The fun place with the fans

2933
03:48:31,160 --> 03:48:35,640
Not the only those but like the ones that there's like a guy named lee there. Um

2934
03:48:36,440 --> 03:48:40,360
I'll probably play hoony pop and I'll probably do a similar thing to this where I voice all the characters

2935
03:48:41,080 --> 03:48:43,880
And we get all the fun special stuff. So

2936
03:48:44,920 --> 03:48:46,520
Yeah

2937
03:48:46,520 --> 03:48:48,520
Brilliant segue. Thank you

2938
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:50,920
Thank you. Thank you

2939
03:48:51,080 --> 03:48:55,160
Yes, nice. Oh very nice. Yes. Oh, yeah, silly fans. Yeah

2940
03:48:58,200 --> 03:49:00,600
Sounds like a peak lee stream. Yes

2941
03:49:01,640 --> 03:49:03,640
Do you feel any pop might kill me?

2942
03:49:05,800 --> 03:49:08,440
Yes, I've been here for the longest out of all the cast members

2943
03:49:10,440 --> 03:49:12,280
See, I told you

2944
03:49:12,280 --> 03:49:17,160
She's a she's not she's a trust fund, baby. She also lives on our parents life insurance

2945
03:49:17,800 --> 03:49:19,640
That's that's a lore

2946
03:49:19,640 --> 03:49:22,200
Surprised she just comes here for fun to insult people

2947
03:49:23,480 --> 03:49:25,080
What's the issue?

2948
03:49:25,080 --> 03:49:27,080
Because of the way I am

2949
03:49:27,400 --> 03:49:32,120
Is it because you're not good at making small talk and you're bad at serving customers?

2950
03:49:34,840 --> 03:49:37,240
Dude what the fuck you have to say that

2951
03:49:41,240 --> 03:49:44,760
Yeah, how have you been here so long? You're just shit at talking to people

2952
03:49:45,800 --> 03:49:49,000
But you're an idiot. I hate you. Don't ever come again

2953
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:52,840
So that's how you prove what the fuck just happened

2954
03:50:00,600 --> 03:50:06,840
So that's how you perceive me. No, no, I'm sorry. That's not what I think of you at all. Although I said it out loud

2955
03:50:06,840 --> 03:50:13,960
And it wasn't even like a dub from the person voicing me right now. I'm just a dick

2956
03:50:15,720 --> 03:50:17,720
That's okay. You're right anyway

2957
03:50:20,040 --> 03:50:23,720

Oh boy whore arc let's go. Do you have friends? No

2984
03:52:07,800 --> 03:52:09,800
It's not like you have any friends either

2985
03:52:10,680 --> 03:52:15,160
Uh, yeah, I do the work I'm doing is all through a connection with my friend

2986
03:52:15,960 --> 03:52:18,520
That my parents totally didn't pay to be friends with me

2987
03:52:19,720 --> 03:52:23,880
You do have friends. That's unexpected. You kind of seem like a loser

2988
03:52:24,840 --> 03:52:26,040
Damn

2989
03:52:26,040 --> 03:52:27,880
You have to be so harsh

2990
03:52:27,880 --> 03:52:29,880
Why is that so surprising?

2991
03:52:30,280 --> 03:52:37,880
You're the type of guy who gets fired. I figured might make a mess with friendships as well. Jesus. Why is she cooking me?

2992
03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:47,000
I'm like I feel personally attacked

2993
03:52:49,000 --> 03:52:51,880
But it makes sense because all you guys are fucking subs and she's a fucking

2994
03:52:52,360 --> 03:52:56,600
She's fucking insulting. You know, you're all getting off on it. Yeah, I bet you fucking like it

03:53:08,840 --> 03:53:10,840

Great stream. Thank you. Thank you

03:57:35,640 --> 03:57:37,800
Restella acting made the stream amazing

3054
03:57:38,840 --> 03:57:40,840

the uncensored version on

3060
03:57:57,880 --> 03:57:59,880
The Lee's fan site

03:58:03,080 --> 03:58:05,400
Oh, man, if you play who you pop, I'll be there hands down

3062
03:58:07,480 --> 03:58:11,720

Like all those years ago that is when I bought it and I have not touched it since I bought it

3070
03:58:43,080 --> 03:58:45,080
I've never played the game

3071
03:58:48,280 --> 03:58:50,280
I don't even know why the fuck it never did

3072
03:58:51,720 --> 03:58:53,720
I think I was like meaning to play it

3073
03:58:54,440 --> 03:58:56,440
a couple of times

3074
03:58:56,760 --> 03:58:59,240
Oh my god, I just looked outside and the way the sun is setting

3079
03:59:21,400 --> 03:59:25,320
So like I know the premise and like what to expect and all that other stuff

You know, I can't stay away from you. You know, I stream for hours when I can

3115
04:01:42,840 --> 04:01:44,840
Wait, is there a delayed?

3116
04:01:45,720 --> 04:01:48,600
Like she actually delayed her stream. Does she actually like change the time?

3117
04:01:51,480 --> 04:01:54,120

3118
04:01:56,360 --> 04:01:59,560

04:02:28,440 --> 04:02:30,440
I'm looking at

3124
04:02:32,440 --> 04:02:38,600
Our Azura's chat and she's like we didn't get this lady a toaster ASAP because like can we just talk about how she baked her toast?

3125
04:02:40,440 --> 04:02:42,600
She baked her toast and burnt it

3126
04:02:44,920 --> 04:02:46,440
I

3127
04:02:46,440 --> 04:02:49,240
Can I hope one of you guys suggested a um

3128
04:02:50,440 --> 04:02:52,440
Toaster for her throne, please

04:02:54,440 --> 04:02:56,440
Please I'm afraid she's she will burn her toaster

3130
04:02:58,440 --> 04:03:00,440
Burn her house down

3131
04:03:00,440 --> 04:03:02,440
She would burn her house down

3132
04:03:06,440 --> 04:03:08,440
Yep

3133
04:03:08,920 --> 04:03:12,920
I feel like if I go and I read somebody else then she's gonna suddenly be there

3134
04:03:15,640 --> 04:03:18,440
She's watching scatter. Yeah, I'm fucking watching

3135
04:03:19,800 --> 04:03:21,800

04:03:39,320 --> 04:03:43,160
Are we splitting the raid? Can you split a raid? Is that a thing?

She's live. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right

3143
04:03:52,280 --> 04:03:57,320

3144
04:03:57,960 --> 04:04:00,120
Three words for my luscious lips

3145
04:04:02,280 --> 04:04:06,280
Losers trash scum later nerds
