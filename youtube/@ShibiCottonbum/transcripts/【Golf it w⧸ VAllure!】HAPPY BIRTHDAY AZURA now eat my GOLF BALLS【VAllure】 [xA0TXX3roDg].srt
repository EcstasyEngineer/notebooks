Okay, should I start the game does anyone want do you want more strokes? Do you want more? I would love more

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Yeah, collision will be funny

We can hit each other we hit each other's balls. Oh my god

19
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:05,640
Did you guys customize your balls? No, no, how do you do that? How do I customize my balls? I can customize my balls

20
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,200
Yeah, that's all the main screen. You guys didn't customize your balls

21
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,040
Hope let's sit. Oh my gosh. I can customize my ball. Give me a second. What's the name is the

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Got I have a flaming hot ball

25
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,400
Okay, now my ball has hearts

26
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
There's one with axis in me

27
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Oh

28
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Everyone's so excited to have their own custom ball

29
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,860
All right, let me know you're done customizing your balls

30
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Then you should like radio

31
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640

Well, oh not every player is ready not every player is ready

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
How do I do this? Hello?

40
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
This is so weird

41
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm so close

42
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,600
Wait, I don't know how to do it either. How do you game? You have to

43
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Click

44
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,760
Hershey's is so cute you got to pull it back early pop

45
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,960
Ezra will say thank you once the collabs over. Um, but thank you everyone who's supporting this

46
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Ignore me

47
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
No way

48
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,080
Fuck get me off the fucking thing

49
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Oh

50
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,320
I'm still struggling to figure out how to play right now

51
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
You got this little sis. Yeah

52
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,440
It is so much better. No, not the double boogie

53
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,640
The boogie of course a double boogie

54
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,200
I got boogie. Oh shit as boogie is. Where's the hole?

55
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm scared

56
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Let's go

57
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Oh

58
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,880
I thought I was gonna be the only one that didn't get it and I was gonna cry

59
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Hi, thank you

60
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,960
I'm trying to learn how to do this is hard. Okay

61
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:50,640
I am terrible at this. Please. I'm gonna thank god. Triple bogey. That's fine. I can work

62
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:58,080
out this mercy. We didn't play a practice room to be honest. We're just going to seven

63
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:24,560
strokes for different folks. Thank you, Mr. Anonymous. Thank you, Mr. Anonymous. Oh,

64
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:33,480
frick. Hold on. Oh, frick. I'm truly dark in this one. I see. Why are you on my back side

65
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:43,560
right now? I see. I do what I want. I can't see. I'll get the action show. Am I just dead?

66
00:14:43,560 --> 00:15:03,840
Golf. Golf. Golf. Golf. Golf. Golf. Golf. I'm so mad. Oh, my God. All right. Here we go.

67
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:15,240
We got to do where the fuck I am. Come on. Come on. Where the fuck I am. Okay, hold on.

68
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:42,160
Fuck this shit. Me and Mercy are struggling over here. I can tell. I'm fine. I'm not the one

69
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:52,800
struggling in the game for the rest of my life. I'll thank you. Shut up. Talks and golf. You know what?

70
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Me and Mercy, we're fine on the bottom. We'll lift everybody up, you know? I don't want to be on the bottom. I want to be on top. Where's the hole?

71
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, fuck. What? You can come off the ground. Can I jump? Is jumping the same? I don't know. You can come off this map. Okay, right.

72
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Enough. That's three strokes. I keep trolling. I'm trolling. Stop trolling. Come on. Okay. Now we start. Damn. Am I going to roll over?

73
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What?

74
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, my God. I'm going to Kermit.

75
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Guys, guys. What the hell is this?

76
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm throwing. I'm going to throw. I'm going to throw so freaking hard.

77
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to cry. Where am I? Hello? Oh, what the fuck am I supposed to say? No, I killed Aisy. I killed Aisy.

78
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm creeping. I'm on the edge of glory.

79
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Fuck this. I'm not going to live in the old me. Who the fuck am I doing? Who the fuck am I doing?

80
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Who the fuck am I doing?

81
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Of course.

82
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Strati has salt.

83
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I did it.

84
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's not a maximum amount. There has to be a maximum amount. It's 12 strokes.

85
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, it can't be because I've managed to win this little game.

86
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I thought it was 12. I guess it's not.

87
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Shortened behavior. Shortened behavior.

88
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh, almost holding one.

89
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That was a moment. I needed to even the playing field.

90
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, okay.

91
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Sorry, I swore.

92
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
How dare you swear?

93
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I can't believe you, Mercy. How could you swear? It's so fucking stupid.

94
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I got the trick shot.

95
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm so sorry. I said such bad words. I will remember to fuck myself.

96
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're going up. You're going up.

97
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yourself? I can't believe you're going up yourself.

98
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Are you winning?

99
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What the fuck is the salt thing?

100
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's me. I put salt on myself.

101
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh my god.

102
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What the heck?

103
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Strati got one.

104
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm Scottish. Didn't you know golf started in Scotland to have like a racial passive to this?

105
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm not even kidding.

106
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Stop, stop, stop.

107
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Please, please, please.

108
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We have thrown in that 17.

109
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No, I see. I see it's on the bottom.

110
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I see his bottom and only one made up for all your 12 strokes.

111
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What was that?

112
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What was our math?

113
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That was me having mental breakdown.

114
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's go.

115
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Strati, get out of my face. Strati, don't fuck me up.

116
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I was doing so good. What the fuck?

117
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Are you reaching over golf right now?

118
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Wow.

119
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I always fucking suck at games.

120
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Give me a second.

121
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I got a spammer in chat.

122
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What are they saying?

123
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What are they saying?

124
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm going to far on them.

125
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm going to far on them.

126
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Shibin on them.

127
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Shibin and Fartin so hard.

128
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You know them hard.

129
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm tired because I block that motherfucker.

130
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Motherfucker.

131
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Thank you.

132
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What?

133
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That was like a pro strat. Hold on.

134
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What the hell?

135
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This shit.

136
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Dammit.

137
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Dammit.

138
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Where is the hole?

139
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's like through the yellow tunnel.

140
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
How am I going to jump through that?

141
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I keep on getting the...

142
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay.

143
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So mad.

144
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That was going to be A plus plus.

145
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Why do I have to be behind whatever the fuck this is?

146
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What does bogey mean?

147
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Stop.

148
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Bogey is free.

149
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm being hit.

150
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm going to start choosing violence.

151
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I'm going to start targeting others.

152
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Don't sabotage us.

153
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Wait, they're moving?

154
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The goal is moving.

155
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Here we go.

156
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What the hell?

157
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We got time, man.

158
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We need to pick the easy peasy levels.

159
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What is this?

160
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But it makes it harder.

161
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Where am I?

162
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Are we supposed...

163
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There's no way we're supposed to just eat ourselves.

164
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's do a little bit of this.

165
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's do a little bit of that.

166
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And then a little bit of this.

167
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Sorry.

168
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No, never mind.

169
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
How am I supposed to fucking do it?

170
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Please.

171
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Please, I'm begging.

172
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let me come a little bit closer.

173
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Shit.

174
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh shit, I did it before.

175
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I got this.

176
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't get all this.

177
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Bad timing. It's okay.

178
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay, we're still here.

179
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Quick time of it.

180
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh, thank you so much.

181
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Thank you very much.

183
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm so close.

184
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh wait, that actually almost helped me.

185
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Where am I?

186
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Emmy, go!

187
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Emmy, I'll let you go first.

188
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What the fuck was that?

189
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry!

190
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What the hell was that, Emmy?

191
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can't!

192
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Wait, did anyone get in the hurry?

193
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Damn.

194
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I killed myself.

195
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm throwing myself on the train tracks for real.

196
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm about to end it all.

197
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Jesus.

198
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That was so hard.

199
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Azura did it?

200
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I did it!

201
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay, I'm going to come a little bit closer.

202
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes!

203
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't think this is happening.

204
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No, wait, how did I not get in the hole?

205
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You did get it, Mercy.

206
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You got it, Mercy.

207
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I only got it.

208
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I only got 25.

209
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Congratulations!

210
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you!

211
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Thank you for the 25, Mr. Anonymous.

212
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Why did I get penalized 17?

213
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No one else called penalized 17?

214
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why do you say it like that?

215
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Penalized?

216
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Penalized?

217
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I got ethic hide.

218
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Penalized.

219
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Where's the thing?

220
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Over there.

221
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Wait, how do you...

222
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How do you say penis?

223
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
How do you spell penalized?

224
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
P-E-N-I

225
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
P...

226
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
P-E-N-A

227
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You're doing it too strong.

228
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I don't know how to spell.

229
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Listen to me.

230
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Where is the gun?

231
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
In the hole.

232
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The fucking train!

233
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

234
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Wait, any of these is the goal?

235
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I wish I could...

236
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I've never played this game before.

237
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hey, Estrani, how do you say pen?

238
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Pen.

239
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Pen.

240
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Pen.

241
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Pen.

242
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Pen.

243
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm literally gonna cover...

244
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Penalized.

245
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Penalized.

246
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Penalized.

247
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Penalized.

248
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Penalized.

249
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Please feel the love of the holy goddess Azuro.

250
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That was fucking hard.

251
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, god.

252
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Which one is the hole?

253
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Are they all the holes?

254
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Hole.

255
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
My hole.

256
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, I thought I was a crab.

257
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
How am I supposed to...

258
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Bunk.

259
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm glad I'm not the one...

260
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm still at the fucking start.

261
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm still at the start too.

262
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I have to relax.

263
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay, I did it.

264
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I made it.

265
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Alright, let's go.

266
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Now I just realized I forgot to turn off this.

267
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What?

268
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What are you doing?

269
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What have you done?

270
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's nothing, so they didn't do anything.

271
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Did you have your background music on?

272
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
No!

273
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, mine is. I saw my background music on.

274
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Now where?

275
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay, alright.

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Where is it?

277
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Bunk.

278
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's the same place as before.

279
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm going this way.

280
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm following Emmy.

281
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Rather gently that time.

282
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Do apologize.

283
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Shit.

284
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Alright.

285
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm on X games.

286
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So is Emmy.

287
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
No!

288
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Stay, stay, stay.

289
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That was so funny to see.

290
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Son of a...

291
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Double bogey.

292
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Someone literally goes to my stream.

293
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I switched streams just to say,

294
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
it's Pen Owl Lies.

295
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Okay, dude.

296
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Pen Owl Lies.

297
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Queen Owl Lies.

298
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Queen Owl Lies.

299
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What happened?

300
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
What are you doing?

301
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Fuck!

302
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I see Frozen.

303
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No, I killed Icy.

304
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No, you killed Icy.

305
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
In what?

306
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Glitching for me.

307
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Let's go home.

308
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What the fuck?

309
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What is this?

310
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You guys suck at gosh.

311
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's amazing.

312
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What do you mean?

313
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I almost shoved those goggles in your mouth

314
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and F.

315
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I was doing amazing.

316
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Azura's killing us all.

317
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Azura is doing good.

318
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
How do we get over to this one?

319
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
F is always a good gamer.

320
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We've all seen it multiple times.

321
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Azura is just nothing fucking new.

322
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I can't fucking do this.

323
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Icy, get away from me.

324
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Don't hit me.

325
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Wait, what?

326
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I did not hit her.

327
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I did not hit her.

328
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I did not.

329
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What the fuck?

330
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I was so close.

331
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What?

332
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I have to be back all the way over here?

333
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Are you kidding me right now?

334
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Fucking shit.

335
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Please stop.

336
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We'll play the beginner map.

337
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We'll play golf with friends

338
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
where we can jump.

339
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Golf with friends?

340
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Enemies.

341
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Damn Royale Golf.

342
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Damn Royale Golf.

343
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Wow.

344
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
All right.

345
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Here we go, folks.

346
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Here you go.

347
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Here's a bunch of nothing.

348
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Here we go.

349
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Here we go.

350
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Go girl.

351
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Go girl.

352
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Wait, I also got monkey spam.

353
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You also got monkey spam?

354
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah.

355
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What the heck?

356
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Chongo, what are you doing, brother?

357
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Don't even say their name.

358
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
They love attention.

359
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I wish I had mods.

360
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That'd be great.

361
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Same.

362
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I think everyone's mods are not used to this game.

363
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
They're like asleep right now.

364
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Remember.

365
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah, thank you for

366
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
remembering Azura.

367
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Thank you for the member.

368
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What was his name again?

369
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We can all celebrate his name.

370
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What was his name again?

371
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Azura?

372
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
For the member?

373
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah.

374
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm now recovering from this.

375
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
There's financial ruin because of golf.

376
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Stagfin.

377
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Stagfin.

378
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Thank you Stagfin.

379
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Thank you Stagfin.

380
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Stagfin?

381
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't know, I'm just guessing.

382
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Thank you Mr. Siegfried.

383
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm sad, I am sad.

384
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Thank you Mr. Sigma.

385
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Sigma nuts.

386
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Actually I was wondering,

387
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
would you guys ever go to Saucon with me?

388
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Saucon.

389
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Saucon.

390
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm so happy I didn't fall.

391
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I was about to say.

392
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I was like,

393
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't want to warn you guys.

394
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I was like, nah, let them fall.

395
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Where's my ball?

396
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
At least they don't know about Madder Daddy's.

397
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's all I'm saying.

398
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That's another one.

399
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What is Madder Daddy's?

400
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh, Notha, how about you baby girl?

401
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Madder baby.

402
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Would you rather eat a baby ghoul

403
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
or a Madder baby?

404
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It was Madder.

405
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, I know this one.

406
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I know, it was Madder with you.

407
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I know this one.

408
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you already go?

409
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh, wait.

410
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm waiting for you.

411
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I didn't notice.

412
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I was laughing too hard.

413
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Thank you Grim by Vila

414
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
for the 10 gifted membership.

415
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Thank you Grim by Vila.

416
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Thank you Grim by Vila.

417
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Thank you Grim by Vila.

418
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We got a lot of money for the 100 dollars.

419
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Thank you.

420
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Thank you.

421
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It smells slow for me.

422
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Are you okay?

423
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's not blue.

424
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Why is it white?

425
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Why?

426
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You can't just ask that.

427
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Why?

428
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You can't just ask that.

429
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It has blue tails.

430
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah.

431
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Where's the hole?

432
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Is this the X?

433
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
No, X is not the hole.

434
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
X is not the hole.

435
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
X marks us up.

436
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That's not it.

437
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Are they fake holes?

438
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They might be fake holes.

439
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Wait, can I clip through

440
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and see where this leads to?

441
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Why is it a point on the hole?

442
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm more surprised.

443
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Are you kidding me?

444
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
How did it not fall in?

445
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't get that.

446
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
How am I supposed to get there?

447
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Don't tell him.

448
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Don't tell her.

449
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
She'll figure it out.

450
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You got this, Trani.

451
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You're so close.

452
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Hold on.

453
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
No, Trani, it's definitely the one behind you.

454
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm in commission, Trani.

455
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Trani, it's the one behind you.

456
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No, it's the one.

457
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's the one you're right next to right now, Trani.

458
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's that one, Trani.

459
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Get that one.

460
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Right there.

461
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Trani, go for it.

462
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Trani's here right now.

463
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You're getting suspended.

464
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You're not getting suspended.

465
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm not getting suspended.

466
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm getting suspended.

467
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I was like first suspension of Vila right now.

468
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I was like first suspension of Vila right now.

469
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Oh, shit, it's moving.

470
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If I got that in whole in one,

471
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I would have literally just sucked my own pee pee.

472
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm going to cry.

473
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Don't worry.

474
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll do it.

475
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Just scream.

476
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Your microphone control is so good.

477
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Damn.

478
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I fucking can't.

479
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I think I'm going to play.

480
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Can I stop bouncing?

481
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
For the love of God?

482
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Alright, there you go.

483
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I need to like aim higher.

484
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay, that was far too hard.

485
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I almost got it.

486
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Too much power.

487
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Where am I?

488
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Where did I go?

489
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay, this one's hard.

490
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I have the power.

491
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I've got the power.

492
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Shit.

493
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Let's go.

494
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What?

495
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I literally just got in.

496
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
How did I not get in?

497
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Did you guys see that?

498
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Fucking ball.

499
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Chat, did you see that?

500
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I literally just made it in

501
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and they kicked me back.

502
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Same.

503
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That's okay.

504
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Are you shitting me right now?

505
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And then too hard.

506
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Please stop moving.

507
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Just get in.

508
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Finally.

509
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Oh my God, A.C. is still playing with the hell.

510
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
How did you get over there?

511
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
$25, thank you.

512
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Thank you.

513
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
No, we were going to have time.

514
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh, right.

515
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Time's up.

516
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Hey, I came in third.

517
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I got the grease flag.

518
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Grease flag, baby.

519
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Why am I playing?

520
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Why am I going to do with this?

521
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I got a shadow.

522
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh my God.

523
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I got witches up.

524
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I didn't get anything fucking beautiful.

525
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I got goggles.

526
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
$500.

527
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
From who?

528
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What the fuck?

529
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Mercy, why do you leave?

530
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Thank you God.

531
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Thank you God.

532
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Thank you Mr. James.

533
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
$500.

534
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I need to be invited again.

535
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I need to be invited again.

536
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
She just got so mad and left.

538
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's okay.

539
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I rage quit.

540
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm so sorry.

541
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You're so real for that though.

542
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
We win.

543
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
At least you won first place.

544
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Like me.

545
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

546
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Surely.

547
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Perhaps you guys don't get the password.

548
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Why what?

549
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah.

550
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Why what?

551
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Added instead.

552
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Remember to

553
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
use

554
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Everyone's cold.

555
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
For what?

556
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
What the fuck?

557
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
What the fuck?

558
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What the fuck?

559
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You're cold.

560
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What the fuck?

561
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You're cold.

562
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You're cold.

563
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You're cold.

564
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You're cold.

565
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That's amazing.

566
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Wait, did somebody do what I did?

567
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What did you do?

568
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Nothing, never mind. Let's not talk about it.

569
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No, no, no.

570
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh wait, I know.

571
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Avoid if we...

572
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
We never did it.

573
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Never did it.

574
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
What took place though?

575
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Our lovely

576
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
super bunny

577
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Mandy.

578
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I've been chilling.

579
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Gamers up so hard.

580
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
By the way,

581
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
guess what I'm drinking?

582
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Blah, blah, blah.

583
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm forever drinking lean.

584
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm sorry. That sounds bad.

585
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I really like lean. Lean is good.

586
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I wish I had the caffeine one of lean.

587
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Wait, didn't they...

588
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I want lean.

589
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I need to get high.

590
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
No, no, no.

591
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It doesn't.

592
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
He's wearing a mustache and glasses.

593
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't think I got an invite.

594
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You're in the game.

595
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You're in the game.

596
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You're in the game.

597
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, there we go.

598
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Look, we are playing golf in my home.

599
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We're in the ice hole.

600
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
We're in the ice hole.

601
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Shit.

602
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Wow, and I'm doing fucking terrible.

603
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Is it more slippery because it's icy?

604
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I think so.

605
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yes, I mean...

606
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You can go on.

607
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Go on then, Stormy. Go on.

608
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I need to get to going.

609
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Otherwise, I'm going to hit you

610
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and I'm going to laugh at you.

611
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's the question.

612
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That's why...

613
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You want to slip on me?

614
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You need to slip on these slides.

615
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm going to achievement.

616
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Hit the ball 110.

617
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
No one special, but actually special to me.

618
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Thank you.

619
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
She's special to me.

620
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
She's very special to me.

621
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
AC has home and family.

622
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
What the heck?

623
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Let's fucking go.

624
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Wait, I wish I could zoom.

625
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Why can't I control the camera?

626
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I think you can.

627
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I think you can.

628
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's the scroll wheel.

629
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Alright.

630
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Azure, your mic's cut and everything.

631
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
If I turn around and go back to the hole

632
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
that we went to before, does that count?

633
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm tweaking.

634
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That's so hot.

635
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I think it would count.

636
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That's 3,500.

637
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
3,500?

638
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Let's go.

639
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Thank you for recording.

640
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Thank you.

641
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Thank you.

642
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh, my internet died.

643
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There's that moving truck.

644
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Thank you.

645
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Thank you.

646
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Azure will go over the names

647
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
after the collab.

648
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I promise she'll do it.

649
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'll make her do it.

650
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That's very sweet.

651
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
A majority of everyone is a thought of this.

652
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
There's 100.

653
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh, baby.

654
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh, baby.

655
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm happy right now.

656
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's okay.

657
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Her crying is going to make me want to cry.

658
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I just want to hug her.

659
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Oh, my gosh.

660
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You are doing fantastic, sweetie.

661
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You deserve this.

662
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
100%.

663
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
We're getting you out of that house.

664
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm getting you out of that house.

665
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm just going to fucking sit.

666
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Don't meet me, Mods.

667
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Don't meet me in a minute.

668
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Go, go, send her some love, guys.

669
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I can't even say it.

670
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I love you all.

671
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Okay, we have advantage now that

672
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Azure fucked up that last one because she's so happy.

673
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Hold on, gamers.

674
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Hold on, gamers.

675
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
We've got the good ending.

676
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That's right.

677
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Keep supporting Azure so we can win.

678
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
She wins everything.

679
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
We play real.

680
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Let's go.

681
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm trying so hard.

682
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I tried.

683
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Geography.

684
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I didn't hit it hard enough.

685
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I can't see.

686
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Oh, no.

687
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
She's tearing up.

688
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
She can't see the mask.

689
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
She can't see.

690
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I can't see.

691
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's okay.

692
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
We have advantage.

693
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
That means we can win.

694
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You can finally lose.

695
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Sorry, my internet is dying.

696
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh, no.

697
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Thank you.

698
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
For once in my life.

699
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Thank you.

700
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Why am I on top of scrawny?

701
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah, you like that.

702
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Why am I on top of Azure?

703
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What's happening?

704
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Is your ping high?

705
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
No, your ping can be high.

706
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
My internet is dying right now.

707
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Where's the hole?

708
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I lose.

709
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Watch an A.C.

710
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Bogle's flying and then hearing...

711
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
No, I didn't really...

712
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I fucking hit it.

713
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Why does it say I have five strokes?

714
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't understand that.

715
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I never...

716
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah.

717
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What the hell?

718
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
No.

719
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Damn it.

720
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It has a goal.

721
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Hit you.

722
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Can I land in another place?

723
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Can I land in another place?

724
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Oh shit.

725
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
My internet is dying.

726
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That lock is scaring me.

727
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That lock is scaring me.

728
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh my god.

729
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Fuck my nuts.

730
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Why is it so hard?

731
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
My legs healed.

732
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I tried so hard.

733
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I tried so hard.

734
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
No, stop.

735
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
In the end.

736
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Not you guys, you guys are fine.

737
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Please, Jesus fucking Christ.

738
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm gonna kill my mom.

739
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm gonna kill my dad.

740
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm gonna be like a champion.

741
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I can't do this one.

742
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I can't do this one.

743
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I did it.

744
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I literally can't do this one.

745
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You can, Emmy.

746
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I believe in you.

747
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, she literally actually can.

748
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I can't do it.

749
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Are the holes over there?

750
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I can't do it.

751
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
No, my internet.

752
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Oh, thank you.

753
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Whoever hit me, I appreciate that.

754
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It was me with me.

755
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You're welcome.

756
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You're welcome.

757
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I can't see.

758
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Surprise.

759
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
There you go.

760
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Please don't hit me off.

761
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I will cry.

762
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oh, thanks.

763
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Appreciate that.

764
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I should just say where I am because people will just hit me.

765
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Get out of my way.

766
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Stop.

767
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I don't have a chance to do anything.

768
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I am not

769
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
shouldn't you right now?

770
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm stuck on a rock.

771
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Where are you?

772
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh, my God.

773
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm stuck.

774
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Oh, no.

775
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Hold R for reset.

776
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Hold R for reset.

777
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, OK.

778
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
OK, let's go.

779
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Save.

780
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So is it impromptu?

781
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
karaoke?

782
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That was almost a move.

783
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That was a good one.

784
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I got stuck on it.

785
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I need 30 seconds left.

786
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm very on.

787
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,960
She made it.

788
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
I'm stuck.

789
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,960
I got it.

790
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,120
Oh, my gosh.

791
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,620
Shit.

792
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,360
I'm unable to.

793
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,000
What the fuck is ASMR happening right now?

794
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,400
Wow.

795
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,760
Clearly, I don't have any advantage.

796
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,440
This is some nice music.

797
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,920
Whee.

798
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,400
Oh, no way, I can't do that.

799
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,000
Fuck.

800
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,960
Oh, thank you.

801
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,920
No.

802
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,320
Any time.

803
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,720
Happy to oblige.

804
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,960
Nice job.

805
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,560
Oh, shit.

806
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,960
No.

807
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,440
Are you kidding me right now?

808
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,940
Ah!

809
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
Hard, baby.

810
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
You were a masochist.

811
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,920
We're getting whacked about, Amy.

812
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
We thought you were a masochist.

813
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
I was like this.

814
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Sorry, Amy.

815
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
I'm sorry.

816
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,520
You just fond in front of me out of nowhere.

817
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,400
Nice job, I see.

818
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,800
Where's the whole at?

819
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,600
OK, she's behind us.

820
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,320
Pure wire halt.

821
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,680
OK, that was a bit too aggressive.

822
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,680
That's fine.

823
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,800
No, that's aggressive.

824
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,680
All right.

825
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,960
Lower that test off to run.

826
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

827
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,600
Gamer move.

828
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,680
Why can't I hide?

829
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,120
I wish this was a game mechanic.

830
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,520
Fuck this.

831
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,440
Thank you so much for the talk, Sophie.

832
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,080
Minimum power.

833
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Maximum power.

834
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,880
I think you're wrong, Amy.

835
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
So true, Bresty.

836
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
You're wrong.

837
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
No.

838
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,400
What?

839
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,480
My mouse is freaking out as well.

840
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,320
Oh, perfect.

841
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
Squeak, squeak.

842
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
What?

843
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,680
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

844
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
I need to get a new mouse.

845
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,480
My mouse double clicks, and I'm getting extra strokes.

846
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,600
That's useful for some games.

847
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,600
No, I'm stroking.

848
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,160
No, you're not stroking mine.

849
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,560
Whoa.

850
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,800
It is diswanding.

851
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,280
I can't.

852
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,080
I see what Strawny would say.

853
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,120
I just won this wedding.

854
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,820
I can't either.

855
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,440
So you won the wedding?

856
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,240
Sister's wedding?

857
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,600
Who's getting married to Amy?

858
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,360
What's her name?

859
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:10,940
I'm a good girl.

860
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,640
She's getting married.

861
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:27,700
Oh my god, fuck you can jump in golf with friends, so I'm disappointed this isn't that and isn't in this game

862
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,360
Okay

863
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,320
I'm familiar with this game. I'm actually not familiar with both the friends should be it's the opposite for me

864
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,720
I'm familiar with golf with friends, but this is my first time playing. Yeah, same

865
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,320
Underdog game

866
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,000
Strap and thank you I hate this

867
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
Like

868
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,080
Normally she makes the other screams, so I know it's nice to be on the receiving end of her screams

869
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,800
I'm on X games. Oh, that didn't work. I'm on X games. Oh

870
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,760
That kind of

871
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,840
Oh too hard

872
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
Oh

873
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
You better get the party started

874
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,360
If you're gonna spawn golf and at least make your hey, I'm in first for the first time. Oh

875
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
My god, what was it?

876
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
Oh

877
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,080
What the shibbity wait wait I can take this to my advantage

878
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,080
You're gonna put that in my head

879
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,280
The music is so calm considering how chaotic we are

880
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,760
I'm blowing it. I'm blowing my lead

881
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,600
I hate I hate video game and I hate gaming and I hate

882
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,000
Bring anyone and anything alright, I'm innocent

883
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,480
If everyone wants to pick I'll take responsibility for picking this one

884
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,600
I thought this was the main one apparently it's golf it with friends, but I've never played golf it guys

885
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,600
I literally

886
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,760
I originally thought it was golf with friends. I would love to tell the story is a row. Yeah

887
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,120
So Emmy hosts the lobby and we're all joining and is there is like it's just no letting me in

888
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,040
We're like, okay, that's strange. Okay. Well, you know what we've got enough time

889
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:12,800
We'll go by golf with friends and she's like go for friends. Yeah go for friends cuz we're on golf it right now

890
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,440
She's on the wrong game

891
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
Patiently

892
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,200
Where's the hole how do we get in there?

893
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
I'll take it

894
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:13,280
Something and I did nothing, you know what see my ancestors big William Wallace I call upon me

895
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,280
What the fuck are you doing? Come on?

896
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,120
Where we go, I just want to win one round of golf it before we have to pop off

897
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
I'm already popping off

898
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,560
Where's the whole

899
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,040
ostero

900
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,520
From

901
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,320
Baste no question mark occupational

902
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,520
We did 650

903
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Can you see that

904
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:13,720
I'm on the edge of glory right now. You're gone this map. Yeah, I know. Oh, Frostyno.

905
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:23,860
Frostyno. Frostyno. I don't know how I got Bastardo from Frostyno, to be honest.

906
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:33,860
That's the hole. You're on a different one. That's the last level.

907
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,860
Hey, don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave.

908
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:43,860
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Perfect. There's a hole.

909
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:49,860
A little 1-8-8. Look at it. Look at it. Like going in and out.

910
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:53,860
What? Excuse me.

911
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:09,860
Okay, I'm gonna let them all collate ahead. I know I'm just rolling.

912
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,860
I'm not gonna kiss me, but come on.

913
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,860
Let me roll and I hate this. There you go, I see.

914
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:25,860
The A killing me. I love getting beat up by you.

915
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,860
We are bulls with the bank together. Oh, what the heck? Please don't hit me.

916
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,860
Oh, no! Am I going backwards? We are going backwards on the hill.

917
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,860
We're strong. Oh, there she is.

918
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,860
Oh, there she is.

919
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,860
Strani, you're going the wrong way, sweetheart.

920
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,860
Wait, why is it and I'm getting pushed forward?

921
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:57,860
It's because it's the ice. It's the ice. Ice, ice, ice, baby.

922
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,860
Oh my god.

923
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,860
I can't wait to take the first spot from Strani because of this one.

924
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,860
I need to possess my Robert the Bruce right now.

925
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,860
I'm gonna teach you a little bit about Scottish history, right?

926
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,860
Big Robert the Bruce Eye. He said English. No, you're not having this land.

927
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,860
And why is he not possessing me right now? Because what's going on?

928
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,860
I have no idea what she's talking about.

929
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,860
I don't watch the stream and you all have to sit in it.

930
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:33,860
His name is Robert the Bruce, Big Willie Wallace, Big Mary, Queen of Scots.

931
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,860
Oh my god, A.C. Wubbins, we spanked. Oh, I love you, A.C. Wubbins.

932
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,860
I didn't have to.

933
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,860
And we go, shit.

934
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,860
I must confess.

935
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,860
Merce, okay, Merce, you can go first.

936
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,860
There's a Mulan song that goes like, and sisters hear my plea.

937
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,860
Do, do, do, do, do, do. Make a fool of me.

938
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,860
I'll bring honour to Scotland.

939
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,860
She'll bring honour to us all.

940
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,860
Hey, you know what, you know what?

941
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:17,860
It's so cute.

942
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,860
I wonder what, what, what?

943
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,860
I understand. The Azura goal on our screen right now says

944
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,860
Azura's sus audio roleplay. We couldn't actually put what the content

945
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,860
of that roleplay is on the screen.

946
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,860
Maybe fall. Oh, it's behind us.

947
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,860
Did I get it?

948
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,860
What?

949
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,860
What the fuck?

950
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,860
I was trying to see if I could pop over.

951
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Not bad, not bad.

952
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,860
Aw, dang it.

953
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,860
Let's go golfing. Aw, dang it.

954
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:09,860
Aw, dang it.

955
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:13,860
Well, that didn't work.

956
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,860
I love AC's frustration screams.

957
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,860
Cause they're cute. I'm like mine. They're like, you know, like a pterodactyl.

958
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,860
Pterodactyl?

959
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,860
That scream in my microphone doesn't pick it up.

960
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,860
Oh, dang it.

961
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,860
Oh, fuck me, bro.

962
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:41,860
Okay.

963
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,860
Aw, come on.

964
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,860
Give me, give me. I've got a bone to pick with.

965
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,860
Hold on a minute. Your tweet gave me a heart attack.

966
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,860
Cause it didn't display fully.

967
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,860
So the first sentence is I'm leaving viola and I'm like, aww.

968
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,860
No, no, no.

969
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,860
Not like this.

970
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,860
At least let me hit the three month anniversary before someone goes.

971
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,860
Please.

972
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,860
Sorry, she was having a little stomachache.

973
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,860
It's not over until it's over. You know what I'm saying?

974
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,860
Oh, what the hell?

975
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,860
No, what?

976
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,860
How do they do worse on the second part?

977
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,860
Holy shit.

978
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,860
Holy one.

979
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,860
Son of a...

980
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,860
What did you do?

981
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,860
I'm watching her stream right now. I'm opening up her stream. I want to see.

982
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,860
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

983
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,860
No.

984
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,860
That's fucking amazing.

985
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,860
She beat me. You whore.

986
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,860
You beat me by one point because of that hole in one.

987
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,860
You're American on here, please.

988
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,860
It's alright. I'm also Scottish.

989
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,860
It's also the Scotland. Let's go.

990
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,860
You better be Scottish.

991
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,860
Everyone drink water.

992
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,860
I'm sorry. Water. But I have gamer stuff. Is that okay?

993
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,860
It's not the only water you need. Use code Marcy for 10% off.

994
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,860
Let them know. Use code Marcy for 10% off gamer subs. Let them know.

995
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,860
Use code Zara. Use code Chibi. Use code IC.

996
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:01,860
Use code Emmy. Use code Stryker.

997
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:05,860
I'd rather you use the girls' codes than my codes. So use one of their codes instead.

998
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,860
Let's go.

999
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,860
I didn't get a prize. So rude.

1000
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,860
No consolation prize, exactly. No. I got third place and I didn't even

1001
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,860
get a medal or a prize or even an achievement.

1002
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,860
I didn't get anything either.

1003
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,860
Participation award.

1004
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,860
You get a participation award.

1005
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,860
To ground my enemies with...

1006
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,860
How did I come in first and then not get anything?

1007
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,860
I can be sushi.

1008
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,860
I want to be your whole in one.

1009
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,860
I want to be your whore in one.

1010
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:57,860
I want to be your whore in one.

1011
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,860
Thank you.

1012
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,860
This is a four.

1013
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,860
Thank you.

1014
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:13,860
I don't know why.

1015
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,860
I like being spanked.

1016
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:21,860
Give me a moment. I need to rethink that one.

1017
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,860
Honestly, I need to recalibrate the joke.

1018
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:29,860
Give me a second.

1019
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:33,860
That's all I need. I just need a moment.

1020
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,860
Zara with the whole in one.

1021
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,860
It's all about time and all.

1022
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,860
Oh, come on.

1023
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,860
Thank you.

1024
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:53,860
I'm on a lily pad.

1025
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,860
Not too hard, but hard enough to make you through.

1026
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,860
Not too hard, but hard enough to make you come.

1027
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,860
Give me that par.

1028
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,860
My enemies now in my way.

1029
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,860
I see a struggle.

1030
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:17,860
Can I get a sanity check on our polar bear?

1031
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,860
I would like a sanity check on our polar bear.

1032
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,860
Thank you so much for 100 dollars.

1033
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,860
Thank you.

1034
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,860
What was the name?

1035
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:37,860
Are we all like to say that?

1036
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,860
Are we going to?

1037
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:45,860
No.

1038
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,860
What about grooming?

1039
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:53,860
Brushing your hair.

1040
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:57,860
Plenty of grooming to go around.

1041
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,860
I have five birdies.

1042
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,860
Is your make on or am I getting nervous that you're deadly silent?

1043
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:09,860
Because you're about to go feral.

1044
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,860
Silence from mercy is scary.

1045
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,860
From AC's worst because she's feral polar bear.

1046
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,860
She's learning how to begin civilization again.

1047
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,860
I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky.

1048
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:29,860
Can you hear me?

1049
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,860
I was talking. I was talking.

1050
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,860
I was talking.

1051
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,860
What the fuck?

1052
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:45,860
I was literally still raging.

1053
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,860
It was awfully quiet without your raging.

1054
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:53,860
It's time to rage some more.

1055
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,860
Exactly. Where am I?

1056
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,860
Can I?

1057
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,860
What the heck is this?

1058
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,860
This is going to be a headache and a hassle.

1059
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,860
Unless.

1060
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:17,860
No.

1061
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,860
What the fuck?

1062
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:25,860
Was the picture on Twitter or keyboard broken?

1063
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,860
I don't know.

1064
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,860
This is so rude.

1065
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,860
Why did you go that way?

1066
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:41,860
It's the wrong way.

1067
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,860
Fuck I'm fucking stupid.

1068
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,860
It's like me. I hate video games.

1069
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:53,860
I hate golf.

1070
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,860
You're becoming a hater.

1071
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,860
Maybe I always was.

1072
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,860
I was the hater.

1073
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:09,860
I was not too good.

1074
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,860
I see land in the middle.

1075
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:17,860
Upwards.

1076
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,860
Upwards and then you land in the middle of that bridge.

1077
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:25,860
In the middle of this bridge.

1078
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,860
Try aiming for the wall.

1079
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:33,860
Upwards.

1080
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,860
Try aiming for the wall.

1081
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:41,860
Just a little.

1082
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:45,860
Oh no.

1083
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:49,860
You're going to run out of time.

1084
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:53,860
Baby.

1085
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,860
Sorry.

1086
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,860
I almost got a hole in one.

1087
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,860
I did a rimshot.

1088
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,860
You know what I'm saying?

1089
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,860
You were saying?

1090
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:17,860
Thank you very much.

1091
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,860
Sorry, the aim at the end of that was brother.

1092
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,860
Here I am.

1093
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:29,860
Nice.

1094
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,860
Here we go.

1095
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:37,860
Almost.

1096
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:41,860
I'm looking back.

1097
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:45,860
She's dying.

1098
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:49,860
5 members.

1099
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,860
That was pretty close.

1100
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:01,860
Thank god.

1101
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:05,860
I almost got a hole in one on that one.

1102
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,860
I hate video games and I hate golf.

1103
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,860
Tiger Woods.

1104
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:17,860
Does anyone know any names of any other golfers?

1105
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:21,860
I don't watch golf.

1106
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:25,860
OJ Simpson.

1107
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:29,860
Did you say OJ Simpson?

1108
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,860
He's a football player that murdered his wife.

1109
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:37,860
That's what he is.

1110
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,860
My apologies.

1111
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,860
I don't know American things.

1112
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:49,860
I tried my best.

1113
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:53,860
You tried.

1114
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,860
I know fictional golfers.

1115
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,860
Fictional golfers?

1116
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,860
There's no end on fictional golfers.

1117
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,860
In the anime and video games.

1118
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,860
That makes sense.

1119
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,860
I'm getting edge by a hill.

1120
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:21,860
Baby.

1121
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:25,860
No triple.

1122
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,860
Baby a double.

1123
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,860
Sheepie's gone over.

1124
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:37,860
I'm locked in.

1125
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:41,860
I'm 100.

1126
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:45,860
Thank you for the 5 hundo.

1127
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:49,860
I'm coming back to the start.

1128
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,860
You put me back to the start.

1129
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,860
You put me back to the start.

1130
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:01,860
You do that on your table.

1131
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:05,860
I'm so close.

1132
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,860
I'm so close.

1133
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:13,860
I literally rolled on her POV.

1134
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,860
What?

1135
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,860
You're a race.

1136
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,860
I can't believe it.

1137
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:29,860
I was too soft.

1138
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:33,860
You gotta be dumb.

1139
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,860
I can't believe it.

1140
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:41,860
You sprinkled salt on your balls.

1141
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:45,860
Did you know that if you dip your balls in soy sauce you can taste it?

1142
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,860
You can probably do that right now.

1143
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:53,860
I had my viewers do it.

1144
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,860
They said it wasn't true.

1145
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,860
You're supposed to tea.

1146
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:05,860
It was pretty nice.

1147
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:09,860
Somebody dipped it in syrup too.

1148
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,860
That's when you know he's Canadian.

1149
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,860
Popped that stuff in maple syrup.

1150
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:21,860
I don't know what the Canadian theme song is.

1151
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:25,860
That's not what they're called.

1152
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,860
Canada.

1153
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:33,860
Canada.

1154
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:37,860
I love it.

1155
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,860
You have a video of the person dipping their toes in the peanut butter.

1156
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,860
Someone was licking it off.

1157
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:49,860
If one of you guys dipped your toes in peanut butter

1158
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:53,860
don't mind me.

1159
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:57,860
I love peanut butter.

1160
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:02,860
for you. I love peanut butter.

1161
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:07,860
smooth peanut butter personally.

1162
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,860
I don't like peanut butter.

1163
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,860
Wow.

1164
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:18,860
Wow.

1165
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,860
Can you eat it or is it bad?

1166
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,860
It's like real peanuts.

1167
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,860
If it's made out of like a bunch of other stuff, I can't eat it.

1168
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,860
Yeah, there's peanut butter that's like 100% just peanut.

1169
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,860
You're fucking shitting me right now.

1170
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,860
That's the only one I can eat.

1171
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,860
You can eat me.

1172
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:44,860
Strawny's on my arse.

1173
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,860
I'm coming.

1174
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,860
I need to keep.

1175
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,860
It's all good.

1176
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,860
Oh, sorry.

1177
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:03,860
I couldn't hear.

1178
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,860
What did you say?

1179
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,860
What did you say?

1180
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:13,860
I didn't hear it.

1181
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,860
I didn't hear it.

1182
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,860
I didn't hear it.

1183
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,860
They're all talking about peanut butter.

1184
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,860
Someone said all of a sudden I'm a dog.

1185
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,860
I see.

1186
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:37,860
What the fuck?

1187
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,860
Someone hit you.

1188
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:45,860
I didn't hear it.

1189
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:49,860
I'm going to be stuck here all fucking day.

1190
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,860
Go ahead.

1191
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,860
Damn, she's doing that rim job.

1192
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,860
We love hearts coming off you.

1193
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,860
Strawny is straddling me right now.

1194
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,860
We're on the same number.

1195
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,860
What does she get distracted by?

1196
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,860
Slime.

1197
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,860
Slime girl.

1198
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,860
Slime girl.

1199
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,860
I hate slime girls.

1200
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:29,860
I hate slime girls.

1201
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:33,860
I hate slime girls.

1202
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,860
I hate slime girls.

1203
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,860
I'm so angry about slime girls.

1204
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,860
Slime girls.

1205
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:49,860
I want to fuck them.

1206
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,860
Here, you're going to have to help me out.

1207
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:57,860
Distraction.

1208
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:01,860
Let the squish win.

1209
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,860
I'm a threat. What is happening?

1210
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:09,060
Oh, what is happening?

1211
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,060
Don't they're getting corraled like animals.

1212
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,260
Don't you see the game has us pitched against each other.

1213
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,660
But through the power of friendship and love, we'll make it.

1214
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,960
In the words of Icy, that's so true, Bresty.

1215
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:36,360
She choked, she choked, folks.

1216
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,860
She fucking choked.

1217
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,260
She choked that chicken.

1218
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,760
Oh, my God.

1219
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,860
I'm going to fart.

1220
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,560
I'm going to fart.

1221
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,160
I'm angry.

1222
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,360
Oh, come on.

1223
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,560
Can't be too hard.

1224
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,960
Can't be too hard.

1225
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,860
Go first.

1226
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,360
Thank you.

1227
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:01,360
You knocked me off the mat twice to restart me.

1228
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,260
That's at least a bit of payback.

1229
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,060
What the fuck?

1230
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:05,660
That's right.

1231
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,260
Keep choking, she's eating.

1232
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:08,860
Oh, no.

1233
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,760
Oh, dear, she be am I getting under your skin hen?

1234
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,860
Oh, dear.

1235
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:13,960
Oh, dear.

1236
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,360
Remember that time the men put the tea in the harbor?

1237
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,060
Aye, that's right.

1238
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:18,660
I don't remember.

1239
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:21,060
Even though I'm full, I don't remember.

1240
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,860
Oh, it's there.

1241
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,060
That is there.

1242
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:24,860
That's right.

1243
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,560
That is historically accurate.

1244
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,960
That's what's bothering me.

1245
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,060
I was watching it.

1246
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:35,360
Is the Americans revolted against the taxes against you?

1247
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,960
Aye, that's right.

1248
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,760
Aye, that's right.

1249
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,560
God damn it.

1250
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,360
It's working.

1251
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:40,660
Right.

1252
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,060
Someone else give me American history.

1253
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:42,460
Come on.

1254
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:42,960
Quick.

1255
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,760
Come on, hold.

1256
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,760
She's like, I was there.

1257
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,260
I was there.

1258
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,460
Everyone should just start speaking in their accent,

1259
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,960
their actual accent.

1260
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,860
I don't think anyone would understand me if I started

1261
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,660
lifting it on.

1262
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,560
It is my accent.

1263
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,560
I don't think anybody wants to hear my New England accent.

1264
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Go for it, go for it, go for it.

1265
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,460
Go for it.

1266
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,160
Oh.

1267
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,060
No, I'm too shy.

1268
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,960
New personal.

1269
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,560
Oh, that's so cute.

1270
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,560
Their actual accents.

1271
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,660
This is my accent.

1272
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,360
Well, I'm literally taking in.

1273
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,860
This is my accent.

1274
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:21,060
This is my accent.

1275
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:23,360
So cute.

1276
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,560
I'm trying.

1277
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,660
That was pretty cute, Emmy.

1278
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,060
I won't lie to you.

1279
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,860
That was really cute.

1280
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:31,260
It's like my accent.

1281
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,160
Oh.

1282
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:32,960
Oh, your homework.

1283
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,660
Why you no doctor?

1284
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,060
Oh, my God.

1285
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,060
Mercy.

1286
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:37,860
She's allowed to do it.

1287
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:38,260
Hold on.

1288
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,660
She's allowed to do it before anyone starts getting weird.

1289
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,560
You can do it.

1290
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,760
She's a liar.

1291
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,260
She's a liar.

1292
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,760
I don't know how to do it.

1293
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,060
Canceling Mercy.

1294
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:46,760
Fuck.

1295
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,560
Canceling her.

1296
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,660
Drops.

1297
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,160
Hello, welcome in.

1298
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,560
Hello.

1299
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,160
I don't lie.

1300
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,260
It was an ASMR idea too.

1301
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,860
Well, not really ASMR because it was like really aggressive

1302
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,060
and it would be a lot of yelling.

1303
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,560
Yeah.

1304
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,460
Anybody want anything from Donk's kid?

1305
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,360
Yeah.

1306
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,660
Yeah, you fucking stupid.

1307
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:14,260
From what?

1308
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,760
What?

1309
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,760
That was not my bar before anyone starts accusing.

1310
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,960
That was not me for once.

1311
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,360
That was my bar.

1312
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,360
That was Amy's burp?

1313
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,660
That was a really good burp.

1314
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,760
That was a very good burp.

1315
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,360
Oh, fuck.

1316
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,360
This is hard.

1317
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,160
Oh, thank you for lighting me up though.

1318
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:31,560
I see.

1319
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:31,960
Hold on.

1320
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,560
Let me go.

1321
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,360
Give me a second.

1322
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,360
Oh, my God.

1323
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,960
No.

1324
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,360
I'm assuming.

1325
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,160
How are we saying that?

1326
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,960
I said, let me go.

1327
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,560
How the fuck?

1328
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,460
Who just spanked me?

1329
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:46,760
Oh, no.

1330
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,460
Should I go back again?

1331
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,760
2D suspension.

1332
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,360
And we're going to make up a story about how you don't feel

1333
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,660
well, 2D suspension right now.

1334
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,360
Azura, do not move, Azura.

1335
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,760
Sheebie.

1336
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,460
I'm waiting.

1337
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,660
I'm waiting my turn.

1338
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,660
Everybody's chaotic right now.

1339
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,260
Fucking go.

1340
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,160
Azura.

1341
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,660
Azura, go.

1342
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:12,660
Fuck it.

1343
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:16,260
Oh, my God.

1344
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,460
Give me time.

1345
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,460
Oh, there we go.

1346
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,460
Oh, no, wait.

1347
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:24,460
You just got knocked in.

1348
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,460
What?

1349
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:28,460
You just went in for me and then you jumped out.

1350
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,160
Strongly.

1351
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,760
The ping is the ping.

1352
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,760
Oh, my God.

1353
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,760
Did it keep hitting me?

1354
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,160
It's in your neck.

1355
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,260
I'm winning.

1356
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,160
I'm still winning.

1357
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:36,660
There's a chance.

1358
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,760
So you're saying there's the chance.

1359
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,760
So you're saying there's a chance.

1360
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,460
I'm going to lose.

1361
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,860
You got this, Amy.

1362
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,460
Just time me out already.

1363
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,460
You killed me.

1364
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:47,960
Thank you.

1365
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,460
Thank you, binary.

1366
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:49,960
Call fit.

1367
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,960
The game is pain personified.

1368
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,160
It is.

1369
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:54,960
How am I?

1370
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,260
OK.

1371
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,760
How are we supposed to get there?

1372
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,460
I'm so sorry.

1373
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,460
Whoever went in the water.

1374
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,460
But I heard the SFX so clearly.

1375
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:08,260
It was like, it was so high quality.

1376
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:09,860
Strongly, you better go.

1377
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,260
I'm on a ramy in the boat.

1378
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,660
I have, I have, but I keep moving.

1379
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,460
Someone hit me and I keep moving.

1380
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,460
I know I know.

1381
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,460
I need to get away.

1382
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,460
I'm in.

1383
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,460
I'm in.

1384
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,460
No, I was so close.

1385
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:21,960
Fuck.

1386
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,460
Shit, albatross.

1387
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:24,460
I'm in.

1388
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,460
I can't.

1389
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,460
Oh, that's a great song.

1390
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:31,460
Pop, pop, pop.

1391
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,460
Pop, pop, pop.

1392
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,460
Real gamer blames the pangs.

1393
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:36,960
Exactly.

1394
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,460
My pain is astronomical.

1395
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,460
This is going to be so fucking hard.

1396
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,460
Displead.

1397
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,160
I hate this.

1398
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:49,660
If I hit someone in there, I'm gonna be so pissed.

1399
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:53,660
The war physics in this game, I have to compliment it when we use it on the war.

1400
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:57,740
Someone named CPS just tipped me in talking about how I killed my Tamagotchi.

1401
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,740
Oh no!

1402
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:03,180
He hasn't forgiven you for your crimes against your Tamagotchi.

1403
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,460
I've killed many a Tamagotchi.

1404
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:09,260
I might choke out for this.

1405
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,260
Oh man.

1406
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,260
Oh shit.

1407
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,260
Yes!

1408
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,260
Yes!

1409
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,260
Yes!

1410
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,260
Yes!

1411
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:16,260
Yes!

1412
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:17,260
Yes!

1413
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:18,260
So much for the $500!

1414
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,260
Wow!

1415
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,260
Holy shit.

1416
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,260
From who?

1417
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,260
Let's fucking go.

1418
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,260
From Garfunkel.

1419
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,260
Garfunkel!

1420
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,260
Thank you Mr. G.

1421
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,260
More like bank funkel.

1422
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,260
More like bang funkel.

1423
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,260
I don't fucking know.

1424
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,260
I don't fucking know.

1425
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:41,260
First places we meet up with you.

1426
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:42,260
What's the art?

1427
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:44,260
Wait just trying to get in.

1428
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,260
Oh I'm fucked.

1429
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:48,260
Yeah, Sonny got it.

1430
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,260
Check out the scoreboard.

1431
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,260
Press shift and see how many it took me to do.

1432
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:54,260
We're gonna find out what happened to me.

1433
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,260
Yeah.

1434
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,260
Are you fucking shitting me right now?

1435
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,780
I've made my ancestors proud.

1436
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,780
I can mess up everything after that.

1437
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,780
I got a white top hat.

1438
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,660
Costa Rica flag.

1439
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,580
I unlocked a literal Joby.

1440
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:28,020
I unlocked a literal door because I'm stupid I was also too excited a maybe I don't know

1441
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,800
I miss so many I miss so many

1442
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,740
Close your eyes

1443
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,920
Very

1444
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:55,980
I'm really feeling it. Are you feeling it now mr. Mercy? Should I do?

1445
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,100
Should I do should I do hard mode? Yeah, do it. Yes

1446
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,880
And then we'll end on this one because we've almost

1447
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:12,660
If I think one more game is gonna take us like 30 minutes and then Azura can get on with her business

1448
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,360
Grim by Vila I get strengths again with the

1449
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,740
You're gonna kill Icy with hard mode

1450
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,660
Lagging

1451
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:51,180
I can't wait. I'm sorry. I forgot to hit ready. I was waiting for you. These carrots

1452
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,340
Oh

1453
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,860
Fucking carrots, we're on the farm reef lens

1454
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:01,760
Sorry Pete have a milk and farm. Please excuse me

1455
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,380
This is a weird J temple

1456
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:10,860
There's turnips on the floor. What's with the random bar at the bottom?

1457
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,860
No, I radishes

1458
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:21,220
How do you get on the thingie strontie strontie, don't do it baby strontie. I'm not

1459
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:27,620
We are I think we're touch it. Oh, no, we're not touching or we're very close to touching tips

1460
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,540
Oh my gosh, am I

1461
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:38,660
This is anyone's when because of how awkward this map is this is literally anyone's win. It's my game

1462
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:43,500
Why do I keep on getting back one of y'all

1463
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:53,300
Okay, we're in yes, yes. Yes. Yes, you know what this is the last game I choose violence

1464
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,300
Oh

1465
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,740
Why am I in such a bad spot a bitch?

1466
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,340
Amy Amy move first, okay?

1467
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,460
I'm still at the fucking beginning

1468
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:36,740
