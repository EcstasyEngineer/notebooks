06:22.220 --> 06:51.220
I have set up crowd control for Cult of the Lamb, I've just kept all of the regular like coin amounts so like you can, I'm doing air quotes, purchase coins to mess with me on stream and I'm just like, I left everything there like I didn't take away like me switching weapons taking away my health vice versa.

06:51.220 --> 06:59.220
So you guys can go ham if you want to you know help great or if you want to fuck me over great it's fine.

06:59.220 --> 07:07.220
I have played Cult of the Lamb before I almost beat it I haven't finished it all the way through so we're starting a new save.

07:07.220 --> 07:15.220
So you're letting us kill you whenever you get maybe I might have to adjust it but we'll see.

07:15.220 --> 07:20.220
I don't know my chat died. Oh there it is there it goes.

07:20.220 --> 07:30.220
But we'll see how because I've never used crowd control I've only played Cult of the Lamb with Twitch and they have like a built-in extension like companion on the lamb and I was pretty straightforward.

07:30.220 --> 07:41.220
Although it was pretty easy to set up crowd control and I got the pro version so because Cult of the Lamb is like early access to get the pro version to get it.

07:41.220 --> 07:52.220
And but I also know some other cool games on there that I would love to play with crowd control like inscription is one of my favorite games of all time and I would love to do.

07:52.220 --> 08:02.220
I'm like really tempted to like yoink one of my stuff things from next for next week and do inscription with crowd control.

08:02.220 --> 08:10.220
I don't know if I could never use it before yeah and either way so I think it'll be lots of fun.

08:10.220 --> 08:16.220
I'm very epi so I've pounded two energy drinks.

08:16.220 --> 08:20.220
We'll see how hyper I get.

08:20.220 --> 08:25.220
Wow delicious Red Bull.

08:25.220 --> 08:31.220
Did you see you call the lamb trailers today as local co-op yeah I'm like I tagged strongy in the trailer and I was like.

08:32.220 --> 08:37.220
And then I just deleted it because it's a local and I'm like well fuck me then.

08:37.220 --> 08:40.220
She's so far away.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.220
I just get I only like the regular Red Bull.

08:43.220 --> 08:50.220
I like could have gotten a Celsius but then Celsius is like shit to me and I haven't drink a monster in a very long time.

08:50.220 --> 08:57.220
I remember I had like four monsters in the span of like an hour and I had like really bad heart palpitations.

08:58.220 --> 08:59.220
That was funny.

08:59.220 --> 09:04.220
That was real fun those days being a mall rat going through the mall.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.220
Steam has played together.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.220
Lots of people play local co-op games remotely.

09:07.220 --> 09:09.220
What?

09:09.220 --> 09:12.220
You're lying to me.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.220
Is that true?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.220
Have you tried Nukko?

09:16.220 --> 09:18.220
That sounds like a drug so no.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.220
Pink monsters.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.220
I just only I don't like the original flavors of everything.

09:22.220 --> 09:25.220
I don't like like although I do like the monster green team.

09:25.220 --> 09:28.220
So time for an off club.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.220
They rolled out during the primitive.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.220
Oh okay.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.220
Is there a way to send you money for super chat?

09:34.220 --> 09:36.220
You can support me.

09:36.220 --> 09:41.220
I have text to speech donations on with stream elements.

09:41.220 --> 09:44.220
So you guys can mess around with that.

09:44.220 --> 09:49.220
We all I think we all have partner now like we can all apply.

09:49.220 --> 09:54.220
So but then it takes about like almost a month to get approved for monetization.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.220
So super chats.

09:56.220 --> 10:01.220
I don't know if YouTube will just fucking nuke our channels and be like who's applying horse.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.220
No.

10:02.220 --> 10:05.220
So we'll have to see can you have a hot dog.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.220
Okay.

10:07.220 --> 10:18.220

10:18.220 --> 10:19.220

10:37.220 --> 10:39.220
I haven't played call the layman like three months.

10:39.220 --> 10:42.220
So I'm going to be trash.

10:42.220 --> 10:44.220

10:46.220 --> 10:51.220
Bow bow bow bow bow not tomorrow today.

10:51.220 --> 10:57.220

10:57.220 --> 10:58.220
We love the yappings.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.220
I'm you know I appreciate it.

11:00.220 --> 11:15.220
I remember back when I was a high priestess sometimes I would yeah for like an hour before I even started a game and they'd be like can you please just play or switch to just chatting.

11:15.220 --> 11:18.220
I come into your stream and he won't shut up.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.220
I'm looking for a game.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.220
I'm like get the fuck out then.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.220
I'm here to talk.

11:22.220 --> 11:24.220
All right.

11:24.220 --> 11:27.220
Daycare simulator.

11:27.220 --> 11:31.220
But some bad news.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.220
I mentioned it on my alt briefly.

11:33.220 --> 11:40.220
My landlord discovered I'm harboring a fugitive known as Fia.

11:40.220 --> 11:44.220
I'm supposed to have only two cats in my apartment.

11:44.220 --> 11:48.220
And so they're like you the maintenance guys I think rat it on me.

11:48.220 --> 11:54.220
So fuck those maintenance guys because you have to pay pet rent for every pet and it's like 50 bucks for a cat.

11:54.220 --> 11:59.220
And I'm like I already pay like $1500 in rent.

11:59.220 --> 12:02.220
You're telling me I have to pay rent for my cats.

12:02.220 --> 12:11.220
Like if it was like I get it for like dogs and stuff because if they have amenities with a dog like a dog bath or like a dog park and whatever but like I'm like dude.

12:12.220 --> 12:19.220
And so I'm just like I'm so I'm like already looking for a new place and I was texting my parents and my dad's is like honestly just save.

12:19.220 --> 12:24.220
And I'm like what do you mean and my dad just like to start spamming save in our family's group chat.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.220
My mom's like can you shut up and it was really funny.

12:27.220 --> 12:34.220
But my dad's like come on with the with the hentai waifu money you'll be making.

12:34.220 --> 12:42.220
You can save for a house and and I'm like not if they kick me out dad where am I going to stream.

12:42.220 --> 12:52.220
But yeah no I'm going to save I'm going to look at other places but like I'm just lying to them and saying I'm cat sitting so we'll see.

12:52.220 --> 12:55.220
Isn't it better to buy an apartment at this point.

12:55.220 --> 13:00.220
But you can't really well you could like a condo or something.

13:00.220 --> 13:05.220
Yeah no it's way more worth it where I am in to buy instead of rent.

13:05.220 --> 13:13.220
I could move to another state where it would make more sense to rent but again like I've lived in this apartment for almost two years now.

13:13.220 --> 13:26.220
And I was really just going to like wait it out until I do you get enough money to save and move and like purchase my own house but like I might have to be sooner rather than later.

13:26.220 --> 13:31.220
But I'm actually I'm not that worried because you know I'm just really thankful.

13:31.220 --> 13:42.220
Sometimes stuff just like I fear the worst and stuff works out for me whether it be like random acts of kindness from you guys or strangers or like.

13:42.220 --> 13:47.220
I don't know I just I just have faith that I'll be fine so I'm not I'm not really I'm not going to stress about it.

13:47.220 --> 13:52.220
I'm just going to hang out with you guys and you know do my thing streaming public transport.

13:52.220 --> 14:00.220
I see streams from a laptop I could just get a laptop and just like streaming the wilderness something of a gamer myself.

14:00.220 --> 14:04.220
Wait that was there.

14:04.220 --> 14:09.220
I didn't put my headphones on yet so I didn't hear the Texas speech.

14:09.220 --> 14:13.220
Hope this helps a bit thank you thank you I appreciate you so much.

14:13.220 --> 14:21.220
Yeah but like honestly like don't feel like just because I told you that don't be like I have to save her that's not what I'm saying I'm just being honest with you.

14:21.220 --> 14:27.220
So like if there's a time or like a week I don't stream it's because I'm probably moving but I'll keep you guys updated if that happens.

14:27.220 --> 14:30.220
But I'm not I'm honestly not worried at all.

14:30.220 --> 14:33.220
Force brothel let's go.

14:33.220 --> 14:38.220
Call you Mr Sir Mommy go for it you can do either or sugar tits.

14:38.220 --> 14:50.220
Yeah because I remember like sometimes I just like to talk to say hey what's going on in my life and I know and girls can say this to we don't tell you stuff to make you feel bad for us we just tell you because we like to talk to you.

14:50.220 --> 14:53.220
We like to be honest with that's going on.

14:53.220 --> 14:59.220
Because like I know as there was getting really emotionally yesterday because she's talking about her stuff.

14:59.220 --> 15:04.220
That when I tell you I love a certain death she's a fucking cheaper for what she's gone through.

15:04.220 --> 15:12.220
But I know she wasn't telling you to be like feel bad for me she's telling you because I'm like because like hey I have those shoes so some days are harder than others.

15:12.220 --> 15:19.220
And like I have the same thing so I just appreciate you guys for being very understanding and supportive.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.220
Yeah she's such a tuber.

15:22.220 --> 15:27.220
But yeah because like we're all here we're content creators to have fun.

15:27.220 --> 15:33.220
Yeah communication is a point especially in our relationship because you're my boyfriend go from.

15:33.220 --> 15:44.220
I just thought of like I just thought of what's it called Ryan Gosling from the Barbie movie because your boyfriend go from.

15:45.220 --> 15:52.220
Should be GFB let's go wait no don't get it twisted you're still the bottom of this relationship.

15:56.220 --> 16:00.220
I'm just a lonely cow woman so I'm just gonna call you my boyfriend go from.

16:00.220 --> 16:07.220
I'm sorry so many relationships and because of communication issues I probably yeah I would say so like.

16:08.220 --> 16:16.220
When people don't it's usually from like my love my friends are married or dating people and I just love listening to their problems on bothered because I can't relate.

16:19.220 --> 16:31.220
And so they'll just be like oh like money this money that or this thing and then he expects me to do this and I'm like did you tell him and then they'd be like well no when I'll be like.

16:32.220 --> 16:39.220
Why you fucking are the or I know I'm usually I'm 100% nicer than that.

16:39.220 --> 16:50.220
A lot of my coworkers like come to me with a lot of their problems because I'm motherly I'm big sisterly like even my coworkers who are older than me will be call me like their big sis just because like.

16:50.220 --> 17:00.220
I've grown so much from other people's experiences because people just tell me everything I think it's my Gemini moon or whatever.

17:01.220 --> 17:06.220
And you know I got that I got that cancer rising in that Libra son baby girl.

17:06.220 --> 17:13.220
But oh no she's one of those astrology bitches yeah I'm fucking am it's fun.

17:13.220 --> 17:29.220
So people saw this like I know I'll shed some wisdom and like I remember and I was also a trainer for my job for a bit so a lot of I refer to a lot of my my trainees that have blossomed and grown and have already been there for a year at my job.

17:30.220 --> 17:35.220
Like when they get like a raise or a promotion like that's my son that's my daughter I'm so proud of them.

17:35.220 --> 17:42.220
One of them likes to call me the they like to say I was your first born.

17:42.220 --> 17:48.220
So I guess yeah I'm some of my coworkers I've trained or my children that makes me a meal.

17:48.220 --> 17:51.220
She's a 10 but she's a two astrology.

17:51.220 --> 18:00.220
But yeah no I'll I'll I used to have especially for guys because guys don't have usually a safe space to talk about their feelings.

18:00.220 --> 18:15.220
And so I remember I had this like group of like two girls and one guy and one of the guys was like super down and I'm like hey what's going on here we're going to talk about we're going to have a therapy moment and then we all just like had a heart to heart.

18:15.220 --> 18:26.220
My brother was crying his other brother was brother I say like air quotes like his co worker was hugging him it was so emotional and the girl was sitting there like wow I can't believe you brought that out of him and I'm like you know.

18:26.220 --> 18:33.220
I'm just an empathetic motherfucker you know sometimes sometimes they.

18:33.220 --> 18:43.220
Sometimes people just need a vent and yeah I'm like I'm one of those people that like I care so much that's why it's a little bit hard for me to be a dom sometimes because I'm someone who's actually very.

18:43.220 --> 18:47.220
Caring so my aftercare goes hard.

18:47.220 --> 18:57.220
Some homie cuddles yeah honestly you know it's not it's not homo if it's your homie and you're just consoling him.

22:17.220 --> 22:18.220
He's white.

22:19.220 --> 22:20.220
I know he's white.

22:20.220 --> 22:30.220
Some people just grow up in a sort of like a with a you know just multiple groups of people so they just adapt the vernacular.

22:30.220 --> 22:46.220
Mine only comes out when because normally I'm like very like I get made fun of all the time for like because I have a customer service voice where I just sound like hi oh my gosh welcome to redacted I'm so glad to help you today so what are you looking for.

22:47.220 --> 22:49.220
Oh okay like and I'm not joking that's what I sound like.

22:51.220 --> 22:52.220
And then.

22:52.220 --> 22:55.220
My white friends are like what are you doing.

22:56.220 --> 22:57.220
And I'm like what do you mean.

22:59.220 --> 23:04.220
Where is the AVE coming from because then because honestly from TV.

23:08.220 --> 23:15.220
Because there's not I think the demographic in my area is mostly like Spanish and white now that I really think of it.

23:18.220 --> 23:25.220
Sorry I'm like thinking and I was like almost going to say something and just like docks my location and I'm like no that's not right.

23:27.220 --> 23:31.220
I remember my old job my coworkers are prank each other by pretending to be customers and have a voice.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.220
Oh it'd be so funny.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.220
I like sometimes I.

23:36.220 --> 23:44.220
I'd like go up to my manager and be like excuse me and to be like what and I'll be like hi I'd like to file a complaint.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.220
And just like major Karen voice.

23:48.220 --> 23:53.220
And yeah it's adopted the pot media culture 100% love and hip hop I don't.

23:54.220 --> 23:55.220
I actually.

23:59.220 --> 24:06.220
And it's I don't want to say no I'm not going to I'm not going to say nothing because I'm going to I don't want to take this ball down because people are going to take my shit out of context.

24:07.220 --> 24:09.220
How do I safely dispose of scorpions.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.220
Well there is a way to remove their stinger.

24:13.220 --> 24:25.220
You could capture them in a bucket and then so you capture them in a bucket and you put a piece of paper or the cover down you try to guide them onto the cover and then you close it and then you can let them outside.

24:26.220 --> 24:33.220
I don't scorpions unless they're like invasive you know they might be valuable to the environment so I don't recommend killing them.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.220
I like are really like.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.220
Invertebrates.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.220
OK.

24:41.220 --> 24:43.220
To tie in with what you're about to play and you call the lamb trailer.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.220
Yeah we were talking about that.

24:45.220 --> 24:50.220
I'm excited for the new stuff that's probably going to come out in like I don't know like a month or two.

25:11.220 --> 25:14.220
Gonna take my horse down the old time road.

25:14.220 --> 25:19.220
I'm gonna ride like I can or more we got the horses in the back.

25:20.220 --> 25:21.220
We're tacky as a dad.

25:21.220 --> 25:25.220
Don't know the lyrics so I'm gonna sing them bad.

25:25.220 --> 25:27.220
Energy drink ruin the burp.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.220
Oh that was pretty good.

25:29.220 --> 25:30.220
I'm getting a lot of nines.

25:32.220 --> 25:33.220
Fuck you forgive me a five.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.220
But go off.

25:36.220 --> 25:37.220
Deep voice she be.

25:38.220 --> 25:42.220
I remember I posted a tech talk of my range and someone's like so you're a man and I'm like.

25:44.220 --> 25:48.220
Thanks that's like the highest form of compliment for me for me.

25:48.220 --> 25:51.220
I think I'm a dude with my voice range I guess.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.220
Oh my gosh.

25:56.220 --> 26:00.220
It would make a lot of the stuff that I posted on my alt Twitter very confusing.

26:05.220 --> 26:07.220
Deep voice she be coming at you from the bottom.

26:08.220 --> 26:10.220
We got the horses in the burp.

26:12.220 --> 26:14.220
My apartment is very good.

26:15.220 --> 26:18.220
My apartment is very echoey as well.

26:18.220 --> 26:20.220
I need to put those sound panels up.

26:20.220 --> 26:22.220
Shout out to the person that got me some panels.

26:23.220 --> 26:25.220
Alt Twitter is the best shit post so far.

26:26.220 --> 26:30.220
I didn't expect my my alt Twitter to get like what is it like 17k now almost.

26:31.220 --> 26:40.220
And like I just posted dumb as shit on there and I'm like why is it keep getting and so that's why I'm like I'm like scared to post as often as I would because normally I don't shut up on my alt.

26:40.220 --> 26:44.220
But now there's like majority of bots eyes on me.

26:44.220 --> 26:45.220
It's terrifying.

26:46.220 --> 26:47.220
That's great.

26:48.220 --> 26:49.220
She be is not a boy.

26:50.220 --> 26:51.220
She be is not a dude.

26:51.220 --> 26:52.220
What the fuck.

26:52.220 --> 26:53.220
Spikes phone.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.220
Spikes laptop.

26:54.220 --> 26:55.220
Spikes PC and anger.

26:55.220 --> 26:56.220
Spikes MacBook.

26:56.220 --> 26:58.220
Spikes whatever you're watching this on.

26:59.220 --> 27:00.220
Did I hear cat girl?

27:01.220 --> 27:02.220
Okay.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.220
She's good.

27:04.220 --> 27:05.220
She's drinking water.

27:06.220 --> 27:07.220
I heard.

27:08.220 --> 27:09.220
I heard.

27:11.220 --> 27:19.220
I got a little laugh yesterday in my Maros because apparently my little sister brapped on stream.

27:23.220 --> 27:26.220
I had someone in my Maros like hey and this gave me a laugh.

27:26.220 --> 27:27.220
I was like cracking up.

27:27.220 --> 27:36.220
They're like hey I'm sorry we had such good times but I'm going to have to leave you for Emmy because she she farted on stream and you gave us burps.

27:36.220 --> 27:39.220
But like you haven't farted for us yet.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.220
That voice is like exactly how I read it.

27:41.220 --> 27:49.220
It's like hey so I'm going to have to leave you for your little sister and I'm like this is not an airport.

27:49.220 --> 27:52.220
You do not need to announce your departure but have fun.

27:54.220 --> 28:03.220
I will eventually probably fart too on accident when I can't mute fast enough but it's not you.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.220
It's me.

28:04.220 --> 28:10.220
I just I just really miss Mel Nakamada and she's like the closest thing I can get to her.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.220
Okay.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.220
Hell don't worry about it.

28:16.220 --> 28:17.220
Don't worry about it.

28:20.220 --> 28:29.220
I think there's like a compilation of back when I was a priestess all my my burps in my farts too so no one's going to find them.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.220
I don't even know if it actually existed.

28:32.220 --> 28:33.220
Mel mentioned.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.220
That's such a good impression.

28:35.220 --> 28:37.220
Damn you weren't lying with your range.

28:39.220 --> 28:46.220
Like I said I wanted you to stream or maybe I'll do it in the collab that we have probably I think next week.

28:47.220 --> 28:53.220
I'll be like hey guys so I need you all to say a line and I'm going to try to say it exactly the way that you say it.

28:55.220 --> 28:57.220
Don't worry I'll make a burp compilation.

28:57.220 --> 28:58.220
Hell yeah.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.220
Is she be the new Mel iteration.

29:03.220 --> 29:04.220
Hell no baby.

29:10.220 --> 29:11.220
That would be funny though.

29:11.220 --> 29:17.220
No trust me I'm not going to scam you guys and say I have cancer and then leave.

29:17.220 --> 29:18.220
I'm sorry.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.220

29:20.220 --> 29:29.220

29:30.220 --> 29:32.220
Damn what the fuck hold on.

29:34.220 --> 29:36.220
Damn get a palm full of that.

29:38.220 --> 29:40.220
Please don't awaken anything.

29:40.220 --> 29:43.220
I'm an English guy so here you match my voice.

29:45.220 --> 29:49.220
I can't like when I so what was it.

29:49.220 --> 29:57.220
So when I played Andy and Lele I did like a very I gave Ashley a very like.

29:57.220 --> 30:07.220
Okay and like okay Andy like that sort of voice and then Andy was like fuck what the hell man like damn this like that kind of like tomboy voice but for every other character.

30:08.220 --> 30:18.220
I just gave a real shitty like British accent and then like same thing when I played Liza P just like really bad British accents all around.

30:19.220 --> 30:21.220
Yo she be got the dumpy.

30:22.220 --> 30:27.220
She be does not have a dumpy she has a okay thumbs up E.

30:29.220 --> 30:34.220
Damn the shock wave Liza P Liza piss I like to call it.

30:35.220 --> 30:40.220
It's time to put this what time is it oh it's almost time oh hi boomi.

30:41.220 --> 30:48.220
Sometimes boomi likes to reach over to me and like reach out when he stretches on his cat bed next to me and just like touch me lightly in the arm.

30:48.220 --> 30:51.220
I'm just like hello sir yes I know you're still there.

30:55.220 --> 31:03.220
More boobin than dumpy yes more boobin than dumpy although hey do you guys want to fund like my brush reduction because my back started hurt.

31:04.220 --> 31:11.220
What was that song my back is aching my brow too tight something something something something I think that's like a Beyonce song.

31:12.220 --> 31:23.220
Is this crowd control thing going to dox me no I turned off names and and photos so I shouldn't do anything for you.

31:24.220 --> 31:35.220
Sounds like an insult to God yeah but when you're skinny as a rail in your body type your boobs don't match the rest of your body type.

31:36.220 --> 31:51.220
Your back hurts a lot you know how hard it is to find clothes I have I'm scared to try on the cosplay I got for she be because I know it's not going to fit over my boobs so I might have to come up with another strategy to.

31:52.220 --> 32:08.220
To like find like just another version of the outfit because I'm scared I'm scared of being so often I go to dressing rooms try stuff on and I just cry because everything else fits perfect minus my boobs cut a hole out for the boobs.

32:10.220 --> 32:14.220
What oh that reminds me I need to get like a bra that's similar.

32:15.220 --> 32:27.220
Wait because I don't have to well hmm I was good thing I was planning on buttoning up my shirt but should I unbutton it for the cost.

32:28.220 --> 32:37.220
Oh thank God I'm not a woman and then like I have friends and I bet strong he has this problem because she has a fat ass where they're like.

32:38.220 --> 32:45.220
You know a little bit smaller like medium is premium on top and then when they go to pull up their pants their ashes and fit in any.

32:46.220 --> 32:55.220
Pants because like their thighs and their ass are thick ums the rest of them is normal ums.

32:57.220 --> 33:12.220
Not the nerf I got the rope for the cosplay yeah I got the rope for the cosplay well I got like a there's like a lingerie thing that I can just put on because I am not going through the effort of tying she barry although again like I said I want to do a membership stream while we learn to tie she barry.

33:13.220 --> 33:20.220
Cake topping out the bakery suffering from success.

33:22.220 --> 33:27.220
500 sound right for a corset or under bus is actually tailored for you um.

33:28.220 --> 33:35.220
I sound a little bit expense maybe because like I have corsets.

33:37.220 --> 33:42.220
Not comfortable it's like the thing is like the lingerie for the rope is pre tied.

33:45.220 --> 33:53.220
I have two corsets one one I use for cosplay that I think I just chucked because I use it for a fairy cosplay when I went somewhere to a Renaissance fair.

33:54.220 --> 34:05.220
And then another one I just had because I when I was working from home I just kept slouching so I put on a corset and it helped me set up straight and it was actually helpful spray on she barry.

34:06.220 --> 34:16.220
I'm sure I heard a girl crying for not having back pain oh yeah it's always like the girls with small boobs always wish they had some the girls with big boobs always wish they had small ones and like I just want to be like in the middle.

34:17.220 --> 34:25.220
I remember because I've been to physical therapy for the pain because I have like a fucked up neck and shoulder because of it and have to get like injections in my neck and shit.

34:26.220 --> 34:42.220
I mean shop steroids all right right um but I remember my physical therapist um he was just like hey no he's not touching my boobs by the way get the fucking out of your head now he just directed me what to do with how to move my shoulder properly okay.

34:43.220 --> 34:58.220
All right relax um he was telling me his wife got a reduction and then like he was just like yeah it was a fucking shame I'm like I was looking at him like of course of course you her husband would say that it was really fucking funny.

34:59.220 --> 35:23.220
Um everyone's always unhappy yeah exactly everybody has like a little I'm doing like that salt bait like a little dash of dysphoria dash of fuck my life I hate my body and especially as a woman be like with like eastern and western ideals of like beauty and stuff it's like what the fuck do I do with my body when I don't look like that.

35:23.220 --> 35:52.220
But yeah I'm like I think like the only thing I'm very insecure about is because I am partially melanated if I like hurt myself like if I bruise really easily and it can you can really see it on my skin and if I get like um a scratch like if I fucking boomy ran across my foot and I have a scratch on my foot and it looks like I like slashed myself because it just like leaves are really like.

35:54.220 --> 36:06.220
Dark scar although the rest of me is super light and so like I have lots of like I remember I was wearing short sleeves at work and a girl was just like oh my god the fuck happened to you and I'm like.

36:07.220 --> 36:18.220
Then the other girl was like you can't just fucking say that because I just have like um I have scars all over my body so I promise you it's not it's not self harm scars it's just like I'll get a zit.

36:18.220 --> 36:27.220
I leave it or if I pick at it it just leaves a scar so I have like lots of um my mom lovingly calls me her little leopard sometimes.

36:28.220 --> 36:42.220
Emojibi no it's not deep gashes it's really like the most superficial stuff like if I like accidentally like I'm trying to think of something.

36:43.220 --> 37:02.220
If I got like stung by a bee the you know how like when you get stung by a bee it turns red um mine just turns dark brown like I don't even need to touch it and I just scar I just scar so fucking easily and so it just fucking sucks that's like the only thing I'm self conscious about.

37:03.220 --> 37:16.220
Oh my god Carrie cause ask people why they have scars and then I'll usually make the joke that like you want to know how I got these scars being brown like she be yeah she be I get it now.

37:19.220 --> 37:27.220
Jesus Christ those are damage I think I'll be honest I don't really take it personally because sometimes people just like don't have social cues and just ask those things.

37:28.220 --> 37:33.220
Or like you know tism you know it's a little dash of tism.

37:35.220 --> 37:44.220
Let me see I saw someone ask that question you put cream on them yeah I put stuff on them you say leopard or a leopard no a leopard like the spots.

37:45.220 --> 37:54.220
And you know my mom always is really cute and she's just like you know scars like show us that we've survived things and we've lived Pat I'm like mom shut the fuck up I just like give me some laser.

37:54.220 --> 38:01.220
Can you like be rich or something so I can get like laser treatment so I can get these scars and like this show up about me doing anything.

38:03.220 --> 38:05.220
Cause like they don't have body foundation.

38:07.220 --> 38:09.220
I was gonna speak and make up a super dark lie.

38:10.220 --> 38:23.220
Oh yeah no cause I have like at first when she first asked me that I was like oh I just shoot myself and she was like what I'm like no fucking I just have these scars relax.

38:24.220 --> 38:27.220
And then the other guy that's when the other girl was like you just fucking ask people why they're like that.

38:28.220 --> 38:34.220
Or be a little bit like and they were called like she was from another country too like so she was just like being genuinely curious.

38:35.220 --> 38:37.220
So I know she wasn't like being malicious about it.

38:38.220 --> 38:42.220
Survive my cat walking over me yeah I live bitch.

38:43.220 --> 38:46.220
I also have scars cause my freaking cat used me as a scratch toy I know.

38:47.220 --> 38:52.220
Boomi will sometimes like stretch on on me like he'll reach up with his little paw paws.

38:52.220 --> 38:57.220
But he only does this if I'm wearing pants cause he knows my pants isn't my skin so then he'll use his claws.

38:58.220 --> 39:03.220
But if I'm not wearing pants and he reaches up to get pet he won't he'll be he'll I call it soft paw and I'm like thanks for the soft paw.

39:04.220 --> 39:08.220
Have you ever used the line do you want to know how oh yeah all the time all the time.

39:09.220 --> 39:15.220
You know I got the scar I got the scar oh I had like what was it.

39:17.220 --> 39:19.220
There was like one scar I got.

39:19.220 --> 39:24.220
It was I think it was from one of my older cats I used to have a cat named Naomi.

39:25.220 --> 39:33.220
And she I think I was holding her and she just like what I like held her wrong or something and because she like needed to jump out of my arm so she pushed off.

39:34.220 --> 39:43.220
She left like a crazy scratch and it looked like it looks kind of cool like it looks like I got I fought someone and I did tell a girl in grade school that I was stabbed.

39:44.220 --> 39:55.220
She believed it and I still like and right next because and then she just and then this fucking girl proceeded to stab me with a stick fuck you Mackenzie I still have the scar fuck you I hate you so much.

39:57.220 --> 40:08.220
I was like 10 and I told her yeah I was stabbed she's like oh really stabbed you with a stick yeah remember that same year that winter I got hit with an ice ball in the ear.

40:08.220 --> 40:14.220
And then the kid who threw it passed out from looking seeing my blood and I was just laughing maniacally.

40:16.220 --> 40:17.220

40:53.220 --> 40:54.220
Oh my God.

41:01.220 --> 41:09.220
I hope I hope we get like we need every girl to fart so we can have like a fart compilation like a clip of just every viewer member fart.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.220
Eat more fiber though.

41:15.220 --> 41:24.220
I see I thought I was going to be the first one but then since Emmy was the first one I'm not shy anymore because if my little sister can do it then I can do it.

41:25.220 --> 41:28.220
So now I'm just as cool as her.

41:30.220 --> 41:39.220
I'm uncomfortable I'm starting to stare from that statement but that's all deal that's the only one you'll get that's the only one you'll get the rest patreon.

41:40.220 --> 41:47.220

41:59.220 --> 42:01.220

We bond through farts is that how it works that's what girls do in the bathroom I'm going to tell you a little secret.

42:26.220 --> 42:31.220
We just go in the bathroom we just share our farts with each other.

42:33.220 --> 42:34.220
It's exactly what it's like.

42:35.220 --> 42:38.220

42:51.220 --> 42:53.220
Don't know why that is.

42:55.220 --> 42:56.220
Oh.

43:05.220 --> 43:06.220
OK we're going to play the game.

And if you pass

43:41.740 --> 43:50.260
And if you pass

43:50.700 --> 43:51.360
🌊

44:07.980 --> 44:09.620
Why would I destroy it?

44:10.040 --> 44:11.200
Why would I destroy Pluto?

44:11.200 --> 44:12.700
It's already been through enough

44:14.200 --> 44:17.500
No. Dont ruin my Girlbath infanticies

44:17.500 --> 44:34.500
Yeah, I'm not a woman or a man. I am just an eldritch being from another dimension. That's why you don't know anything about my early history and my lore. It's because they couldn't show it because it would make you go crazy.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.500
Yeah.

44:36.500 --> 44:39.500
Why the fuck did I call the lamgo?

44:48.500 --> 44:53.500
I'm crazy. I was crazy once. I'm one of the old ones.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.500
I wouldn't mind a fudashibi.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
Bro, where did you come from with that?

45:01.500 --> 45:04.500
I said eldritch being like, you know I wouldn't mind fuda.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.500
That's not what that means!

45:10.500 --> 45:13.500
Crazy? I was crazy once. It locked me in a room.

45:13.500 --> 45:16.500
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?

45:19.500 --> 45:37.500
I will release the audio of me applying to an agency where all I did for five minutes in the video was being a straightjacket and scream and cry.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.500
Then I did that for three or five minutes.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.500
I will show that after stream.

45:44.500 --> 45:45.500
I was not the first one to say that.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
Oh, were you?

45:46.500 --> 45:47.500
Okay.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.500
Where's my...

45:51.500 --> 45:52.500
Okay, how's game sound?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.500
How's game sound, baby grills?

45:55.500 --> 45:56.500
How are we doing?

45:56.500 --> 45:57.500
You applied to phase?

45:57.500 --> 45:58.500
No.

45:58.500 --> 46:06.500
No, so this was before the viewer opened stuff.

46:06.500 --> 46:11.500
Because again, I didn't think I was gonna get into the viewer because I didn't think I was cool enough, but look at me now.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.500
Yeah, your little fucking whore.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.500
Not mentally ill enough.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.500
Oh, honey, you don't even know.

46:26.500 --> 46:27.500
He doesn't know.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.500
He doesn't know how mentally ill I am.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.500
Why do you think I deal with these voices?

46:31.500 --> 46:33.500
Because the voice is in my head.

46:41.500 --> 46:42.500
You're just hiding your cheaper.

46:46.500 --> 46:47.500
Game sound okay?

46:47.500 --> 46:48.500
Perfect.

46:48.500 --> 46:49.500
Cool, cool, cool.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.500
Hidden yonder?

46:57.500 --> 46:58.500
Yeah.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.500
Aren't we all just like a little land area at heart?

47:03.500 --> 47:05.500
Mentally ill, but not PC mentally ill?

47:06.500 --> 47:07.500
I need to stand up.

47:07.500 --> 47:08.500
My ass is sweating.

47:08.500 --> 47:09.500
What the fuck is going on?

47:11.500 --> 47:12.500
It's so hot.

47:13.500 --> 47:14.500
I'm only wearing a T-shirt.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.500
I need to air my ass out.

47:17.500 --> 47:18.500
Hold on.

47:18.500 --> 47:21.500
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

47:22.500 --> 47:23.500
Smack that thing.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.500
Corporal love.

47:26.500 --> 47:30.500
Oh, but as I was saying, so, um, so I applied for the socks V2 being agency.

47:31.500 --> 47:35.500
This is before like I'm great for them.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.500
I'm happy to get in.

47:37.500 --> 47:41.500
I was just applying like Vila like was my one and only.

47:41.500 --> 47:46.500
If I if I got into any other, I would have fucking dropped it for Vila.

47:47.500 --> 47:48.500
I'll tell you that right now.

47:48.500 --> 47:52.500
So don't think you guys are like, oh, she only applied cuz she had no other.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.500
No, that's not the case.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.500
But because they're like, oh, we bought some really crazy bitches.

47:57.500 --> 48:00.500
And I'm like, hey, you know, I'm a crazy bitch.

48:01.500 --> 48:02.500
I can be crazy.

48:02.500 --> 48:08.500
And so I sent like a very me-me application where I talked about Avril Lavigne having a doppelganger.

48:08.500 --> 48:14.500
And like I said, and she was replaced socks, socks agency by a, what's their name?

48:14.500 --> 48:15.500

48:15.500 --> 48:20.500

48:23.500 --> 48:24.500
There we go.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.500
Gotta hide by wait.

48:25.500 --> 48:27.500
Well, I'm not really hiding my titties, but it's fine.

48:28.500 --> 48:29.500
I want all in.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.500
I'm surprised the voices are real.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.500
I'm not schizophrenic guys.

48:32.500 --> 48:33.500
I'm not schizophrenic.

48:33.500 --> 48:34.500

48:34.500 --> 48:36.500
Let's get to Fernia does run in my family.

48:36.500 --> 48:37.500
I don't have schizophrenia.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.500
Maybe shut up anyways.

48:44.500 --> 48:45.500
Yeah.

48:48.500 --> 48:49.500
Come on.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.500
That one Chad.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.500
E.T.L.

48:58.500 --> 48:59.500
Blessed soul.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.500
Her name is literally on the website as an investor.

49:15.500 --> 49:16.500
Hey, at me.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.500
Can I run?

49:28.500 --> 49:30.500
Oh wait, you know what I should do?

49:30.500 --> 49:32.500
One hell yeah devolver.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.500
I'm gonna make my way.

49:39.500 --> 49:41.500
I like it when

49:44.500 --> 49:46.500
I reflect the screen.

49:50.500 --> 49:51.500
I think it's fun.

49:52.500 --> 49:53.500
Like how strong he does it.

49:53.500 --> 49:54.500
Whoa.

49:54.500 --> 49:57.500
I'm a little I'm a little too dark.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.500
Hold on just a moment.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.500
White woman jump scare.

50:04.500 --> 50:05.500
There we go.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.500
There we go.

50:13.500 --> 50:14.500
Laura.

50:25.500 --> 50:26.500
I thought that was my voice.

50:27.500 --> 50:28.500
Wait.

50:29.500 --> 50:30.500
But for us.

50:30.500 --> 50:32.500
That's the last of its kind.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.500
Others have hunted down and put to the blade.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.500
With its final sacrifice,

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.500
The heretic who lies down down below

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
will be condemned to attorney to captivity.

50:52.500 --> 50:55.500
The old faith shall be preserved.

51:02.500 --> 51:04.500
This isn't my first time being a cult leader.

51:04.500 --> 51:05.500
I've been a cult leader before.

51:07.500 --> 51:09.500
Where the fuck I am.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.500
If you know that reference, I love you.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.500
Come closer.

51:29.500 --> 51:30.500
Fear not.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.500
For though you are already dead,

51:32.500 --> 51:34.500
I still have need of you.

51:34.500 --> 51:38.500
Those foolish bishops thought they could keep me from me and death,

51:38.500 --> 51:41.500
but instead they sent you straight to me.

51:42.500 --> 51:45.500
I will give you life again for debt or price.

51:46.500 --> 51:50.500
All I ask is for you to start to call to my name.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.500
Do we have a deal?

51:55.500 --> 51:57.500
White woman jump scare.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.500
I didn't even notice that my stuff went like that.

52:01.500 --> 52:02.500
My choice.

52:03.500 --> 52:05.500
Take the red crown from

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
which I once wore.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.500
With it you shall command the lower two followers

52:09.500 --> 52:12.500
and strike fear to the hearts of our enemies.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.500
Return to your land of the living.

52:14.500 --> 52:17.500
Start to call to my name and begin recruiting followers.

52:19.500 --> 52:21.500
She be the angel.

52:21.500 --> 52:26.500
All eat my ass.

52:26.500 --> 52:28.500
Once you've done so you'll see me again.

52:28.500 --> 52:29.500
Now go.

52:39.500 --> 52:41.500
Lord inaccurate she be.

52:45.500 --> 52:47.500
Let me know if it's too loud.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
I love the music.

53:14.500 --> 53:16.500
They're like wow she's actually not dead yet.

53:16.500 --> 53:18.500
Yeah I'm decent.

53:18.500 --> 53:20.500
Oh wait my BGM is playing.

53:20.500 --> 53:22.500
I don't even fucking know this.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
What about that? Does that sound better?

53:33.500 --> 53:35.500
It's just dance for a moment.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.500
Start voguing.

53:41.500 --> 53:42.500
Shake that.

53:42.500 --> 53:43.500
Shake that.

53:45.500 --> 53:47.500
Throw it back on this dig.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.500
Yeah get it.

53:49.500 --> 53:51.500
Throw it back on the strap.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.500
Okay we're good.

53:54.500 --> 53:55.500
Cool.

54:00.500 --> 54:01.500
Can you throw it back?

54:01.500 --> 54:03.500
Yeah I can throw it back.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.500
I shake what my mama kinda gave me.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.500
Relax.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.500
I'm matching those things right now.

54:11.500 --> 54:12.500
Thanks you're welcome.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.500
Welcome.

54:16.500 --> 54:19.500
Okay let's see if stuff works.

54:19.500 --> 54:22.500
Cause I know you can claim to be the follower.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.500
I was trying to think if I could do Jamaican accent.

54:33.500 --> 54:35.500
But I don't think I can.

54:36.500 --> 54:38.500
Fear not I am run out.

54:38.500 --> 54:41.500
That's not a Jamaican accent cause I'm trying to think of a voice to give him.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
I might just give everybody uwu voices.

54:45.500 --> 54:46.500
Gamer girl wuga.

54:46.500 --> 54:49.500
Hello man would you kindly share a number on the account?

54:49.500 --> 54:51.500
I have to fart.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
It's not for free.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.500
That was the only one for free.

54:58.500 --> 55:00.500
Is the land like dancing or vibing?

55:01.500 --> 55:03.500
I think they're just vibing.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.500
You guys are fucking...

55:08.500 --> 55:11.500
Little brap stuff.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.500
Fear not.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.500
I was sent to guide you.

55:20.500 --> 55:23.500
We are the deep in the lands of the old faith and in great danger.

55:23.500 --> 55:26.500
She's just gonna have a really bad London accent or whatever the fuck.

55:26.500 --> 55:27.500
Australian.

55:27.500 --> 55:29.500
My instructions are I'll lead you to safety.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.500
Continue through the woods.

55:31.500 --> 55:32.500
Escape loads ahead.

55:32.500 --> 55:33.500
I'm Sean Connery.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.500
I will be close by.

55:43.500 --> 55:44.500
I'll let it go.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.500
Ooh I get one coin.

55:56.500 --> 55:58.500
What to open inventory?

56:00.500 --> 56:02.500
That's not good.

56:04.500 --> 56:05.500
Huh?

56:06.500 --> 56:07.500
Oh.

56:08.500 --> 56:11.500
I'm like my controller doesn't look like that.

56:13.500 --> 56:19.500
I don't even think I ever really looked at my inventory when I played before either.

56:22.500 --> 56:24.500
What's my best operation of a Jamaican?

56:24.500 --> 56:26.500
Probably offensive.

56:29.500 --> 56:32.500
Although I was listening to a lot of dancehall yesterday.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.500
Six million ways to die. Choose one.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.500
Ah ah ah ah ah.

56:42.500 --> 56:46.500
Listen to a little chocolate demersen plier.

56:50.500 --> 56:51.500
Oh my god.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.500
I have to fart again.

56:57.500 --> 56:59.500
It's because I had Indian food.

57:04.500 --> 57:06.500
Almost penniless.

57:07.500 --> 57:08.500
Oh my god.

57:08.500 --> 57:09.500
Gibi's farting so much.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.500
Why is she announcing it?

57:11.500 --> 57:15.500
Because you're gonna wonder why I mute and pause for a second and stare at me like I'm stupid.

57:15.500 --> 57:17.500
Like is she okay?

57:17.500 --> 57:20.500
Is she having an absence seizure?

57:20.500 --> 57:21.500
Probably.

57:22.500 --> 57:23.500
How's your spice tolerance?

57:23.500 --> 57:24.500
Non-existent.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.500
Come here.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.500
Come here you little bitch.

57:42.500 --> 57:46.500
Maybe some kind of mental illness is happening.

57:46.500 --> 57:47.500
It's already happened.

57:48.500 --> 57:51.500
A.O. shout out to Christina Applegate.

57:54.500 --> 57:55.500
Brother.

57:56.500 --> 57:57.500
I know what you're referencing.

57:57.500 --> 57:58.500
It's fucked.

57:59.500 --> 58:00.500
Non-existent.

58:02.500 --> 58:03.500
Butter chicken.

58:04.500 --> 58:06.500
No, it's not spicy.

58:06.500 --> 58:07.500
I didn't get spicy.

58:07.500 --> 58:09.500
I just got goat korma.

58:10.500 --> 58:12.500
Yeah, I like goat and lame a lot.

58:17.500 --> 58:20.500
We have nearly reached safety, but look ahead on their pulse.

58:20.500 --> 58:21.500
So let's be sacrificed.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.500
It's one of you bitches.

58:25.500 --> 58:27.500
Oh mighty bishops of the old faith.

58:27.500 --> 58:29.500
We asked, I don't know why I sound like Toad.

58:29.500 --> 58:32.500
We asked you to accept the sacrifice of this wretched soul.

58:32.500 --> 58:34.500
Hey, who interrupts her ritual?

58:34.500 --> 58:35.500
Trespass is on signal.

58:37.500 --> 58:38.500
Mario.

58:39.500 --> 58:40.500
Oh.

58:41.500 --> 58:43.500
I don't think I can die though.

58:44.500 --> 58:45.500
Because I don't have any hearts.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.500
Yeah, I think I'm fine.

58:53.500 --> 58:57.500
My favorite in this game is the axe.

58:58.500 --> 58:59.500
Pfft.

59:14.500 --> 59:16.500
Oh, my Toad is nowhere.

59:16.500 --> 59:18.500
That's pretty good Toad voice. Thank you!

59:18.500 --> 59:20.500
Hold on, I want to see for the crowd control.

59:20.500 --> 59:22.500
I think I turned off something.

59:22.500 --> 59:24.500
I just want to make sure that it's fine.

59:25.500 --> 59:26.500
Pfft.

59:27.500 --> 59:28.500
Test effect.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.500
Is it working?

59:38.500 --> 59:40.500
No, whatever.

59:45.500 --> 59:47.500
Did it work? I can't tell.

59:50.500 --> 59:53.500
Hold shift to delay five seconds.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.500
Pfft.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500
Oh, it's so tiny.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500
I can't see it up there.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500
Hold on.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
Keep talking amongst yourselves.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.500
I can ban people.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.500
That's funny.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.500
Okay.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.500
Can I figure?

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.500
Pfft.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500
Settings.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500
Options.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500
Inside the sound.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
This is very interesting overview.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Oh, if you guys will use real money, I can get paid.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.500
What the fuck? I didn't even know it was a thing.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.500
Oh, aren't you funny.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.500
Thank you for the tip.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500
Wait.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.500
Damn, I can't use crowd control.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.500
It only takes credit cards.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.500
Damn you credit cards.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.500
Damn you.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500
I don't know why the sound effect didn't work.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.500
I swear stream elements has like a love-hate relationship with me.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.500
Sometimes they'll just be like, yeah, we'll work properly.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500
Yeah, that's fine.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
Oh, there's a no though.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.500
No, I don't think you have to use really, you should be able to get free coins and stuff.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:52.500
Because I know some of you have already claimed stuff from when I'm looking at the history of stuff.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.500
It should be good.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500
It should be good in the hood.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500
I don't know how to use it.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
Oh, I hate you no less.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
Yeah, it's fine.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
It's all like normal.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500
Texas Beach.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500
I might have to have management look at that.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
Make sure it's fine.

02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:27.720
you guys are gonna say i'm fucked for this but i um i uh so i was like i said i

02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:32.520
was watching yellow jackets and yellow jackets is a great survival show about like these girls

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:36.440
that have to survive in the wilderness after the plane crashes and a bunch of other shit too it's

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:41.320
like it's really cool psychological horror a little bit of like spiritual horror stuff and so at

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:46.680
one point they catch a rabbit and they make it and i'm like man i wonder what rabbit tastes like

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:56.520
so uh they had rabbit at my store and it happened to be on sale so i bought a whole young

02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.480
rabbit and i processed it i broke it down and i made it into stew and it was one of the most

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:05.080
delicious stews i've ever made does that make me a cannibal

02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.520
oh yellow jackets are wash well when you're hungry

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.960
as a frenchman rabbit is good yeah i was like it's it's almost like dark meat of a turkey

02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:24.600
um yeah i have like pictures of me uh breaking down the rabbit that i took

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:30.200
old pictures of the rabbit that i broke down brutal why are you eating yourself

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:35.480
it was worth it your fourth third cuz i want to remove

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:40.920
i was yeah i was feeling really Hannibal lector you know do you know how difficult it is to break

02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:44.920
down an animal because my this is a whole rabbit i had a little bit like the awfuls in there too

02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:50.360
there was some heart the kidneys were good um so that's it's probably the most

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:54.280
so i think yeah the weirdest thing i've ever eaten was a rabbit's heart

02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:03.080
why are you taking pictures because i'm fucked up have you tried gator tastes like chicken

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.960
um but like yeah i had to because i couldn't just like i wasn't gonna just throw it in the oven

02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:13.800
like i wanted to specifically make a stew out of it because in the show they made a stew out of it

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:20.680
and guys i like to make a lot of fucked up stuff from media that i play so like i've made like i made

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:26.680
a rabbit stew from yellow jackets but then i also made like the same stew from coffin of andy and lele

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:37.240
not with human i got um a like beef for that but i followed like the recipe air quotes that

02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:47.880
ashley did um so not human disclaimers but like i don't know like i get like really like

02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:53.240
like feral and animalistic sometimes where i just wanted like

02:04:55.080 --> 02:05:00.600
i'm gonna sound like a fucking serial killer if i said never mind um i did not eat human

02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:05.800

like uh heist as markiplier etc stuff um i do like choose your own adventure stuff and it's like on

like uh what's it called songs and like popular pop culture reference songs only because i'm

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:23.880

02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:30.440
that was in the flash animations toy box um i grew up after like watching the naruto fan

02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:37.640
animations toy box was the first cd i ever fucking bought and i would i want to do a cover

02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:46.440
of one of their songs like either like best friend or um or like superstar i am a superstar

i really love the freedom view alert gives you guys such a good vibe with the company yeah

02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:31.320
i know like some people like oh like wow wouldn't it be so cool to be in hall alive i would not

02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:37.320
survive in hall alive not because of like the content that i make but because or like that i swear

02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:44.440
a lot or whatever so many eyes on me and having to get permissions and stuff would just be like i would

02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:49.080
literally have a panic attack every time i went live i'm kind of happy that like we're small

02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:54.600
but it's funny because i honestly expected us to not get a large viewership but i wasn't doing

02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:59.240
for viewership i was doing because i wanted to have fun um and be like with the group of girls

02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:06.440
and have friends and be in the company together and just collab and um but yeah i didn't expect

02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:15.480
as much success as we have gotten and then go do your thing we can wait i'm gonna piss on the

02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:21.160
microphone bring it with me i'm just kidding this is a brain sense of structures oh yeah toy box

02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:29.720
is not good et is an alien and he is kind of crazy coming to the university party and whatever

02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:35.000
the fuck the song is some people are definitely blind by the numbers and can't work an actual

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:41.320
company like yeah like i've worked in corporations like like for a good chunk of my career so like

02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:47.960
i know how to be like if i was in haul life or if i was in like nijisanji god for fucking bid

02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:56.440
not getting not getting not bad getting nuked um i could ease like i could easy kind of like dial

02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:07.240
my personality back a little bit and not be like as lewd or as like untoward and forward um negligible

02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:14.360
but um i'm really happy that with veeler i can kind of really be myself but then like you know

02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:18.440
then there's like marine like she's kind of like who and like there's like a there's a couple of

02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:23.720
people that are like i like who in tall alive so i can't really say that um i want to put the

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:31.400
niji curse on my worst enemy i know right i just i feel my heart goes out to them the people there um

02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:38.520
because like yeah when you join niji you get like an auto like boost of viewership and all that stuff

02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:45.560
but then you know there's some other stuff that goes along with it um she's seen you already um

02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:54.520
but yeah it's like it is what it is i'm not gonna talk about that or otherwise we'll go in a rant

02:22:54.520 --> 02:23:01.080
i know strawney has the same feelings as i do negative feelings he used to get the boost but

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:09.240
anymore i know i think not to like number or anything or talk about that or anything but like

02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:14.040
so i know i'm performing a little bit better than the new niji sawni livers really surprises me it makes

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:26.040
me kind of sad for them uh i wouldn't wish but uh hold on let me go piss

02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:32.520

02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:54.900
I muted...

02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:59.900
I think I accidentally muted my 3D audio instead, although it's not running.

02:34:59.900 --> 02:35:03.900
So...

02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:13.900
Skarl is cool.

02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:18.900
Choco.

02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:20.900
Beast?

02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:22.900
Let's see.

02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:25.900
Let's scratch my nose.

02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:29.900
I think there's a game, you know?

02:36:29.900 --> 02:36:33.900
Probably gonna play this for like five hours or something.

02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:36.900
I'm supposed to switch to the mapping.

02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:40.900
I don't know why I choked.

02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:41.900
Where's the other dude?

02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:42.900
Oh, he's over here.

02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:48.900
He's fighting for his life.

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:51.900
Alright, let's go.

02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:04.900
Where the fuck did these bitches come from?

02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:09.900
When you were a kid, did you ever sit in a place

02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:12.900
and pretend like ninjas were gonna drop down from the ceiling

02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:14.900
and you were the only one that could save all the people in the building

02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:15.900
so you would fight them off?

02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:17.900
I would do that at church a lot when I was bored.

02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:22.900
I'm like, what if just a bunch of motherfuckers just busted up in my church

02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:30.900
and there were ninjas, and then I used some little bitch-no-jutsu on them.

02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:34.900
God, so I don't care if you're starving.

02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:35.900
Cool.

02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:36.900
Okay, I'm not the only one.

02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:37.900
Cool.

02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:38.900
Cause you just get so bored.

02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:41.900
Like if you had to like go to church or like do something with your mom

02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:43.900
or like go shopping or whatever.

02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:46.900
Just be like this picture of weird stuff.

02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:49.900
I forgot that I'm supposed to be picking stuff.

02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:50.900
I meant to pick the spyglass.

02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.900
I'm just pressing A.

02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:53.900
It's fine.

02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:54.900
I don't care that much.

02:37:57.900 --> 02:38:00.900
I just want the fleece that lets me do automatically three anyways.

02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:08.900
Oh.

02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:12.900
Oh, yeah, fervor.

02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:16.900
Get fucking, god.

02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:18.900
Cool.

02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:19.900
Can I?

02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:20.900
Oh, I have to shoot.

02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:28.900
I love to see it.

02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:29.900
Oh, that hurt my throat though.

02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:33.900
How am I supposed to be the throat goat like this?

02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:34.900
Just kidding.

02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:35.900
That's a serious job.

02:38:37.900 --> 02:38:39.900
I'm god, it's like I think from Hades.

02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:42.900
Yeah, I want to play Hades so bad.

02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:45.900
I think I can only go this way again.

02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:51.900
Can I burp?

02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:52.900
Again, I don't notice when that happens.

02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:56.900
I'm glad you could catch a stream too on your lunch break.

02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:00.900
I too like to watch streamers on my lunch break.

02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:08.900
So then I can just stick my headphones in and pretend to ignore everybody.

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:11.900
Oh.

02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:24.900
All right, I already have plenty of followers so I don't need that.

02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:32.900
I could get some food for cooking and I forget what that little thing means.

02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:37.900
I can't remember, but I'd rather go this anyways.

02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:40.900
A little short burp.

02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:42.900
Yeah, I tend to cute.

02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:43.900
Cool.

02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:44.900
Fuck your family.

02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:45.900
Die, die.

02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:50.900
Death, death of honey, death of punky, die, death.

02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:55.900
Oh wait, I don't know why I'm killing them when I don't have bones yet.

02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:00.900
Look what you've done, you've massacred my boy.

02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:03.900
I can't even make any fish recipes yet, I don't think.

02:40:04.900 --> 02:40:06.900
I'm gonna get the fucking...

02:40:07.900 --> 02:40:09.900
Oh, I should have gotten the seeds actually.

02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:14.900
I can't hit his wife, his wife is so precious.

02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:19.900
What? Oh, I have to...

02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:20.900
I'm like, what?

02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:22.900
Shit's in good...

02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:23.900
Yeah, you know, sometimes it'd be like that.

02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:26.900
Sometimes you just gotta murder people, you gotta murder people, shit's in giggles.

02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:29.900
I just realized my mouth hasn't been moving this entire time.

02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:31.900
I didn't know what he'd tell me.

02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:36.900
I didn't know what he'd tell me, I was just staring at you awkwardly.

02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:38.900
Why am I so small?

02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:49.900
Because you were watching the K&L.

02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:51.900
Because I stood here in telepathic.

02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:03.900
I don't know if you're too close, that's good.

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:17.900
I don't know if you're...

02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:19.900
I don't know if you're aware of this.

02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:21.900
Here I am.

02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:25.900
I don't know if I'm always in my head.

02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:26.900
Yeah, you're in your head.

02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:30.900
I don't know if I'm in my head, I don't know if you're aware of this.

02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:33.900
They don't exist.

02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:35.900
So I'm solving a dream.

02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:38.900
Game is loud, your mom's loud.

02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:52.900
Washing the game and not your pretty mouth, oo-woo.

02:41:57.900 --> 02:41:58.900
My oo-woo-woo mouth.

02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:02.900
I'll take the top because I'm a top.

02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:30.900
Sorry.

02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:33.900
Tour a land of many gods once, hundreds now.

02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:41.900
On the very first.

02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:49.900
You know how you gargle like mouthwash?

02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:51.900
Like you go, ah, like that's what I do.

02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:57.900
That's how I can also do like a cat pernoise.

02:42:57.900 --> 02:42:58.900
Like.

02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:05.900
Although my throat is a little bit dry, so I can't like do it as nice.

02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:10.900
Can I just take the rest of these?

02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:12.900
Oh, I can.

02:43:13.900 --> 02:43:14.900
Get fucked.

02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:16.900
I'm stealing.

02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:20.900
I'm stealing.

02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:22.900
I've been stealing along.

02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:29.900
Oh, I hate these ones.

02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:31.900
Hate them so much.

02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:37.900
My least favorite enemy in this game, any variation of them, I just fucking hate.

02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:51.900
So you foolishly persist, little lamb.

02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:55.900
I hear your lies and I smell your fear.

02:43:56.900 --> 02:44:01.900
The red crown rises again, but what an unworthy bearer it has.

02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:07.900
Eat my fucking- oh, what the hell?

02:44:07.900 --> 02:44:08.900
I thought-

02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:11.900
Get fucked.

02:44:12.900 --> 02:44:13.900
Get fucked.

02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:16.900
Get fucked.

02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:20.900
Ho-ya!

02:44:20.900 --> 02:44:21.900
Oh, ow.

02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:23.900
Come here, you little bitch.

02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:29.900
Oh, I hate that they jump because then I can't tell with the depth of the field.

02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:39.900
Things their voice can do.

02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:41.900
I wish I knew how to purr.

02:44:42.900 --> 02:44:43.900
I know.

02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:47.900
I remember it was like really weird because I was able to do that since I was a little kid.

02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:51.900
So people would be- I was like, oh yeah, I can purr and kids would be like, what? No way.

02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:52.900
They purr in my ears.

02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:55.900
I just purred people's ears like a fucking weirdo.

02:44:55.900 --> 02:44:57.900
And that's why I like to war your cats.

02:44:57.900 --> 02:44:59.900
I was a cat girl all along.

02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:01.900
Oh, you guys just gave me a blunderbuss.

02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:02.900
What the fuck?

02:45:09.900 --> 02:45:10.900
Oh, shit.

02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:12.900
Oh, I'm gonna be back in the corner.

02:45:14.900 --> 02:45:15.900
It's hard to aim sometimes.

02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:23.900
Cool beans.

02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:25.900
Okay, I'm gonna go back for that one over there.

02:45:27.900 --> 02:45:29.900
Yeah, ASMR before is ASMR.

02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:33.900
Okay.

02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:47.900
I like the blunderbuss, so I'll keep it.

02:45:47.900 --> 02:45:48.900
It's a bit-

02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:51.900
I can also just get-

02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:00.900
Yeah, that should be fine.

02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:04.900
I don't care if you're starving.

02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:10.900
I read war your cats too.

02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:11.900
Of course I read war your cats.

02:46:11.900 --> 02:46:12.900
That was my shit.

02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:14.900
I was larping the fuck out of war your cats.

02:46:18.900 --> 02:46:19.900
What's up?

02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:20.900
It's-

02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:24.900
It's your deputy, Broke and I here.

02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:26.900
What's up?

02:46:26.900 --> 02:46:28.900
It's your medicine cat, Nightrun here.

02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:29.900
That was my names.

02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:30.900
I was a-

02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:31.900
Some of my sub-OCs.

02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:33.900
Actually, I think I have like still have a list and like-

02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:39.900
I emailed a lot of my like OC character sheets to myself.

02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:41.900
So I have to find that in my old email.

02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:43.900
What cat clan were you?

02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:44.900
I was Shadow Clan.

02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:47.900
Hello Shadow Clan.

02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:48.900
I also did a lot of like online.

02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:50.900
Like, you know like Flipno Hatena?

02:46:52.900 --> 02:46:53.900
Give me your fucking-

02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:55.900
Fuck!

02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:57.900
I couldn't shoot this girl.

02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:01.900
So you could do a lot of like-

02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:03.900
What's it called?

02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:07.900
I don't know.

02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:09.900
I don't know.

02:47:10.900 --> 02:47:13.900
Like role-playing on Flipnote.

02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:17.900
So I was part of like Ghost Clan and Broken Clan.

02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:21.900
Shout out to Ghost Clan.

02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:24.900
I was in that Warrior Cache channel.

02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:27.900
It's so funny.

02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:30.900
One of the girls that I role-played with, we just-

02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:34.900
We discovered we lived only like 10 minutes away from each other.

02:47:36.900 --> 02:47:37.900
And then we met up and it was so fun.

02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:38.900
Cause we were like-

02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:40.900
Our little parents-

02:47:42.900 --> 02:47:44.900
Wasn't our parents let us hang out or something?

02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:48.900
Although I don't know when my parents will allow me to hang out with some random stranger from on the internet.

02:47:48.900 --> 02:47:50.900
Maybe we just like snuck out.

02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:51.900
We hung out with each other.

02:47:54.900 --> 02:47:55.900
I can't remember.

02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:56.900
We like met at a public place.

02:47:56.900 --> 02:47:57.900
But it was just really cool.

02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:00.900
It was the first time I met one of my online friends.

02:48:00.900 --> 02:48:03.900
It was because we both like Warrior Cats and we were the same age.

02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:11.900
Yeah, I liked Warrior Cats.

02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:13.900
Guardians of the Ghoul was good.

02:48:16.900 --> 02:48:17.900
What else?

02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:18.900
What else?

02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:23.900
She's a Slytherin of Cats.

02:48:23.900 --> 02:48:25.900
It's funny cause I'm actually like a Gryffindor.

02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:28.900
When I did like that Pottermore house sorting.

02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:31.900
So it burned people.

02:48:31.900 --> 02:48:32.900
There's like a fucking weirdo.

02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:33.900
Now I get paid for it.

02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:34.900
I know, right?

02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:35.900
What was a Warrior Cat?

02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:36.900
No, thunder.

02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:37.900
Thunder.

02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:38.900
Thunder.

02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:39.900
Thunder Cats Ho.

02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:42.900
Warrior Cats was a young adult novel.

02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:59.900
And it was almost like Game of Thrones, but cats.

02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:03.900
Cause you had like instead of houses, there were clans.

02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:04.900
And there was different ranking systems.

02:49:04.900 --> 02:49:07.900
You had like your leader, your deputy, your medicine cat,

02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:09.900
who was also the spiritual leader of the clan.

02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:16.900
And it was honestly, despite being a young adult novel,

02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:21.900
looking back, it has some very adult themes in terms of like this one cat

02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:24.900
cheated on another cat and had kids with this cat.

02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:29.900
And he tries and he goes crazy and tries to kill her in a fire and kill her children.

02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:30.900
Like what the fuck?

02:49:30.900 --> 02:49:31.900
That was a kids book?

02:49:31.900 --> 02:49:32.900
Yeah, it was.

02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:34.900
It was fucking great.

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:39.900
Young adult, but they had them in my elementary school library, right?

02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:42.900
Animorphs?

02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:43.900
Oh, Animorphs was my shit as well.

02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:45.900
I remember watching the TV shows.

02:49:45.900 --> 02:49:49.900
I watched a good, I read a good book, good chunk of Animorphs.

02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:01.900
Okay, I might be quiet so I can focus.

02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:05.900
Okay.

02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:19.900
I forgot that I sometimes I just forget I can use fervor.

02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:27.900
I know I would like finding of Isaac because I like this game.

02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:29.900
Strony was telling me that.

02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:32.900
Oh, I thought I was out of range of that, but I guess not.

02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:34.900
Okay.

02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:49.900
My thumb is starting to hurt for some reason.

02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:52.900
I missed?

02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:53.900
What was that?

02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:54.900
It was a little cheebie.

02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:55.900
What are you doing?

02:50:56.900 --> 02:50:57.900
Cheebie.

02:50:57.900 --> 02:50:59.900
Cheebie, you dumbass.

02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:00.900
You're losing it.

02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:05.900
Oh, fuck me.

02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:06.900
I should have done that.

02:51:11.900 --> 02:51:12.900
I'm so stupid.

02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:14.900
Why am I not talking again?

02:51:22.900 --> 02:51:23.900
Oh, chat disconnected.

02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:25.900
Oh, no.

02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:27.900
Hurry, guys.

02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:30.900
Enter the gun.

02:51:31.900 --> 02:51:32.900
Oh, I got greedy.

02:51:32.900 --> 02:51:33.900
Yeah.

02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:34.900
I got a little greedy.

02:51:35.900 --> 02:51:36.900
Just a smidge.

02:51:39.900 --> 02:51:40.900
Just a smidge.

02:51:40.900 --> 02:51:41.900
Oh, I can hear myself.

02:51:41.900 --> 02:51:42.900
Fuck that.

02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:50.900
I can't voice act right now.

02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:52.900
Where's my thumb hurt?

02:51:52.900 --> 02:51:54.900
I need to pop my thumb.

02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:58.900
I need to pop my thumb loosey.

02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:01.900
Okay.

02:52:01.900 --> 02:52:02.900
Hello?

02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:09.900
I know I'm so close to clutch.

02:52:09.900 --> 02:52:11.900
Of course this bitch got a choke.

02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:12.900
Why is my...

02:52:14.900 --> 02:52:15.900
Live 2D.

02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:18.900
Why are you fucking with me?

02:52:18.900 --> 02:52:20.900
Why am I so white?

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:24.900
Come on.

02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:25.900
I believe in you.

02:52:28.900 --> 02:52:29.900
Excuse me.

02:52:29.900 --> 02:52:30.900
I'm bad.

02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:41.900
It's getting brighter again.

02:52:49.900 --> 02:52:50.900
My nose.

02:52:50.900 --> 02:52:52.900
I'm so big.

02:52:53.900 --> 02:52:54.900
Let me sit back a little bit.

02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:56.900
It's like a growl.

02:52:59.900 --> 02:53:02.900
I ask myself that question every day.

02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:10.900
That's funny because I haven't been to the beach yet this summer.

02:53:10.900 --> 02:53:13.900
Or really mostly been outside for the last...

02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:16.900
I've been outside, but I just haven't really been going to the beach.

02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:18.900
So I'm very light right now.

02:53:18.900 --> 02:53:21.900
My mom is darker than me.

02:53:21.900 --> 02:53:22.900
My white mother.

02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:28.900
Yeah, I'm gonna go make some food right now.

02:53:28.900 --> 02:53:30.900
I'm gonna go beat that stupid ass boss.

02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:47.900
Because my mom is outside a lot because she got gardens, so she's...

02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:50.900
She's also Portuguese, so...

02:53:51.900 --> 02:53:52.900
Portugues.

02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:54.900
So she's tan as well.

02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:56.900
There we go.

02:54:03.900 --> 02:54:06.900
So my mom and my dad make fun of me a lot.

02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:09.900
My dad calls me his white child.

02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:14.900
And then my mom's like,

02:54:14.900 --> 02:54:15.900
Well, she is white!

02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:23.900
And he's like, yeah, but my melanin should take precedent.

02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:27.900
Dang, me look angry.

02:54:30.900 --> 02:54:33.900
I think my Wi-Fi is like struggling a little bit

02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:37.900
because I have to have it on Wi-Fi when I use my controller

02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:39.900
because I only have one USB-C connection.

02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:47.900
Now I'm just gonna look really shocked the entire time.

02:54:47.900 --> 02:54:53.900
And again, I only freeze on this thing for some reason.

02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:55.900
It's so weird.

02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:01.900
I don't care that you're starving. Get away from me.

02:55:01.900 --> 02:55:03.900
You little whiny bitches.

02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:08.900
I don't know about that right now.

02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:10.900
I need more beds.

02:55:16.900 --> 02:55:18.900
I don't have enough beds for any of you.

02:55:24.900 --> 02:55:26.900
Most intensive menu.

02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:31.900
That's never happened before too when I streamed this.

02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:36.900
Do you have cable from your controller?

02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:39.900
Yeah, I have a USB-C going into my PC.

02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:43.900
But I only have one USB-C on my PC.

02:55:53.900 --> 02:55:55.900
It's nice because there's so many of you.

02:55:59.900 --> 02:56:01.900
I can do double stuff.

02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:09.900
Come on, get me to the top.

02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:10.900
Yes, thank you.

02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:17.900
The menu is consuming all the PC resources.

02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:21.900
I didn't want to ask for another PC

02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:23.900
when I was hired on.

02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:27.900
I forgot who got a PC.

02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:32.900
I didn't ask either.

02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:34.900
Because he uses a laptop.

02:56:35.900 --> 02:56:37.900
We're too nice.

02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:40.900
They were just like, we'll buy you a 3DO, a PC, a mic.

02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:43.900
And I'm like, no, I'm good. Just give me the 3DO.

02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:48.900
One thing for doctrine.

02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:55.900
Yeah, I built my PC back in 2017.

02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:02.900
She has not been updated for quite a bit.

02:57:04.900 --> 02:57:06.900
Yeah, oh yeah, we get spoiled.

02:57:07.900 --> 02:57:09.900
Mommy and management spoilers.

02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:20.900
I need bones.

02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:23.900
Okay.

02:57:25.900 --> 02:57:27.900
I can't do it because I don't got bones.

02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:34.900
Oh, okay, now I can.

02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:42.900
Collect reward from Strani.

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:44.900
Where is my little mother?

02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:48.900
Mother, I need to speak to you.

02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:50.900
Mom.

02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:52.900
No, not Saber.

02:57:52.900 --> 02:57:54.900
Strani, please.

02:57:58.900 --> 02:57:59.900
Cool.

02:58:01.900 --> 02:58:03.900
I can't wait to unlock fishing.

02:58:04.900 --> 02:58:06.900
Because then I can just fish for hours and just talk to you guys.

02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:07.900
Yeah, while fishing.

02:58:08.900 --> 02:58:10.900
Oh, you look kind of cute just sitting there.

02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:12.900
Get the fucking to work though.

02:58:19.900 --> 02:58:22.900
Actually, I think there's actually nothing you can do.

02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:24.900
Everything's taken up.

02:58:26.900 --> 02:58:27.900
2008 here.

02:58:28.900 --> 02:58:29.900
Jesus.

02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:31.900
Do you need RAM then?

02:58:32.900 --> 02:58:34.900
What do you mean, download RAM?

02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:36.900
What?

02:58:38.900 --> 02:58:40.900
Rounds well upgrade for a year from now.

02:58:41.900 --> 02:58:43.900
I'll probably, like, when I get more established,

02:58:43.900 --> 02:58:45.900
stop grumbling because you're hungry.

02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:47.900
I'll just buy my own PC.

02:58:47.900 --> 02:58:52.900
I just, I don't, I'd rather have the funds go to Gen 2

02:58:52.900 --> 02:58:58.900
or go to, like, 3D or just go to

02:59:00.900 --> 02:59:02.900
making, oh my god, you guys are legit starving,

02:59:02.900 --> 02:59:04.900
but I don't have anything to give you.

02:59:06.900 --> 02:59:07.900
Can I build a farm?

02:59:07.900 --> 02:59:09.900
Hold on, let me see if I can build a farm first.

02:59:18.900 --> 02:59:20.900
I seriously can't build a farm yet.

02:59:22.900 --> 02:59:23.900
Dumb.

02:59:27.900 --> 02:59:28.900
Oh wait, there it is.

02:59:28.900 --> 02:59:30.900
Because I'm like, I think I have not a bright spot.

02:59:31.900 --> 02:59:34.900
I do not have enough coins.

02:59:35.900 --> 02:59:37.900
All right, some of you are going to die.

02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:38.900
Sorry.

02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:40.900
Yeah, go to sleep.

02:59:40.900 --> 02:59:41.900
Die in your sleep.

02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:43.900
It'll be fine.

02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:48.900
$50.90.

02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:50.900
I think I have a $10.70 in my computer.

02:59:51.900 --> 02:59:55.900
I have a, I don't remember, do I have a $7.20 watt?

02:59:58.900 --> 02:59:59.900
Power supply.

03:00:00.900 --> 03:00:01.900
I don't have a $7.20 watt.

03:00:02.900 --> 03:00:03.900
I don't have a $7.20 watt.

03:00:03.900 --> 03:00:04.900
Do I have a $7.20 watt?

03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:08.900
Power supply.

03:00:09.900 --> 03:00:11.900
32 gigs of RAM.

03:00:12.900 --> 03:00:14.900
I think it's DDR4.

03:00:15.900 --> 03:00:16.900
It's a DDR5, I don't know.

03:00:19.900 --> 03:00:24.900
I have a risen 2700.

03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:27.900
I can't remember if it's 2700X or not.

03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:32.900
But yeah, she needs to upgrade.

03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:36.900
I've also just been too lazy to build a PC.

03:00:36.900 --> 03:00:43.900
I'd rather just like, like I, I almost went to for computer engineering in school because I really enjoyed building PCs.

03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:53.900
I remember I, um, my friend bent the pins on their computer so I was able to fix it and like solder it and all that shit.

03:00:55.900 --> 03:00:59.900
That was really fun, but I'm way too lazy to build my PC again.

03:00:59.900 --> 03:01:02.900
Although I think if even if I get a pre-built, I'll have to build it, but whatever.

03:01:03.900 --> 03:01:10.900
And if, if that's the case, then I'll probably just end up building it myself and like do you like PC par picker?

03:01:10.900 --> 03:01:14.900
Feel free to like give me suggestions on my marrows or whatever.

03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:19.900
45.

03:01:21.900 --> 03:01:23.900
I feel like a big, little big planet.

03:01:23.900 --> 03:01:25.900
A risen, risen, I don't know.

03:01:28.900 --> 03:01:29.900
Risen.

03:01:29.900 --> 03:01:31.900
I always call it a risen.

03:01:31.900 --> 03:01:33.900
Is it not, is it rising or risen?

03:01:33.900 --> 03:01:34.900
I'll be risen you up.

03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:35.900
That's for sure.

03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:37.900
My mouth's not moving again, but it's fine.

03:01:39.900 --> 03:01:40.900
I'm like moving my face around.

03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:41.900
Nothing's happening.

03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:45.900
Risen.

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:02.160
I'm making myself dizzy.

03:16:02.160 --> 03:16:04.160
I'm free statue.

03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:06.160
I guess I'll get you guys better beds.

03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:08.160
No actually no I need these first.

03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:10.160
Yeah I need these first desperately.

03:16:11.160 --> 03:16:14.160
I'm gonna start with stone.

03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:16.160
Cause it's really hard to get stone.

03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:19.160
Sometimes.

03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:25.160
You can revive unless you harvest the meat.

03:16:25.160 --> 03:16:27.160
Okay gotcha. Zero deaths.

03:16:27.160 --> 03:16:29.160
Zero deaths everyone.

03:16:33.160 --> 03:16:42.160
I know you guys some of you guys will leave too when the faith's been low for a long time.

03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:47.160
Time for a seven.

03:16:50.160 --> 03:16:53.160
I guess you guys are all just shit everywhere then.

03:16:53.160 --> 03:16:55.160
Okay.

03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:05.160
It's crude ice blessing.

03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:10.160
Yeah I don't care about that.

03:17:13.160 --> 03:17:15.160
I'm gonna do this one.

03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:18.160
Being first.

03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:21.160
Imagine yeah just getting starved to death and revive.

03:17:21.160 --> 03:17:23.160
The starving to death and reviving again.

03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:28.160
Kind of fucked up.

03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:37.160
You guys look all piss.

03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:39.160
You're like we need fucking...

03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:42.160
This guy called us diabolic.

03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:44.160
This guy called us diabolic.

03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:46.160
Well there's too many of you.

03:17:56.160 --> 03:17:58.160
So much you can take from them.

03:18:00.160 --> 03:18:02.160
I can give you gifts.

03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:04.160
I can't wait to like be able to yell at you.

03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:14.160
Yep yep yep yep.

03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:18.160
Cause I can do intimidation.

03:18:19.160 --> 03:18:21.160
We can play that game.

03:18:21.160 --> 03:18:23.160
The dice game.

03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:32.160
I fucking love this game so much.

03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:39.160
I still have to do this guy.

03:18:39.160 --> 03:18:41.160
Sounds weird.

03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:44.160
What's up Saber?

03:18:45.160 --> 03:18:47.160
Cook grass meals.

03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:49.160
I will accept that.

03:18:50.160 --> 03:18:53.160
Might get the grass treat as well.

03:18:53.160 --> 03:18:54.160
What?

03:18:54.160 --> 03:18:56.160
I don't have any grass.

03:18:57.160 --> 03:18:59.160
What the hell?

03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:02.160
You guys can fight over that.

03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:06.160
Can I build shit?

03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:11.160
Okay I'm gonna build fucker.

03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:14.160
What the fuck?

03:19:18.160 --> 03:19:20.160
Okay you bitches build that.

03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:24.160
Oh my god scrumptious nightmare.

03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:26.160

03:19:30.160 --> 03:19:32.160

03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:34.160
Oh my god stop vomiting.

03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:47.160
Throw you over here.

03:19:48.160 --> 03:19:50.160
For now.

03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:58.160
Okay.

03:19:59.160 --> 03:20:01.160
My rabbit is deceased.

03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:09.160
Why am I just like standing awkwardly?

03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:15.160
That's my tracking lens.

03:20:15.160 --> 03:20:17.160
No!

03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:22.160
Everybody's dying.

03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:24.160
Why the fuck you dying?

03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:27.160
Why the fuck you dying?

03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:31.160
Oh my god stop fucking dying.

03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:34.160
Come on E hold on.

03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:38.160
She literally died and vomit.

03:20:42.160 --> 03:20:45.160
Sweet. I'm like you guys don't call me a viper so I'm not too worried.

03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:50.160
Ah hold on stroney.

03:20:52.160 --> 03:20:54.160

03:20:58.160 --> 03:20:59.160
No.

03:20:59.160 --> 03:21:01.160
Oh my god I'm gonna try to fix.

03:21:02.160 --> 03:21:04.160

03:21:04.160 --> 03:21:06.160
No.

03:21:06.160 --> 03:21:08.160
Hi stroney.

03:21:09.160 --> 03:21:12.160
Oh my god can you guys like stop?

03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:14.160
You guys are being so dramatic.

03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:18.160
What the hell? I can't move.

03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:23.160
Controller?

03:21:28.160 --> 03:21:30.160
Here we go.

03:21:32.160 --> 03:21:33.160
No!

03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:35.160
Stroney!

03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:42.160
Stroney why do you have to be the one to dissent against me?

03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:47.160
No!

03:21:47.160 --> 03:21:49.160
Stroney stop!

03:21:56.160 --> 03:21:59.160
Stroney I don't want to throw you in prison.

03:21:59.160 --> 03:22:01.160
When I make a prison.

03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:06.160
Hey everybody just pass out.

03:22:09.160 --> 03:22:11.160
I'm surrounded by cults.

03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:13.160
Stop mommy stop!

03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:15.160

03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:21.160
Why the fuck you dying?

03:22:25.160 --> 03:22:27.160
Everybody should be against me.

03:22:29.160 --> 03:22:31.160
Okay that school coming along nicely.

03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:34.160
Come here!

03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:39.160
You guys can wake up and eat me.

03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:45.160
One of you will be lucky enough to wake up and eat that.

03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:48.160
Thank you later.

03:22:50.160 --> 03:22:52.160
Build more beds.

03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:55.160
Okay I'll do that.

03:22:56.160 --> 03:22:59.160
One of you guys will be able to have a bed.

03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:04.160
Too many mouths to feed.

03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:10.160
You know what must be done.

03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:12.160
I'm not killing stroney.

03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:14.160
I'm not betraying my own mother.

03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:16.160
Why am I asleep?

03:23:17.160 --> 03:23:20.160
Why am I asleep in the corner?

03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:23.160
Why am I asleep in the corner?

03:23:29.160 --> 03:23:31.160
Oh my god please.

03:23:35.160 --> 03:23:36.160

03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:39.160
My internet has like not behaved since yesterday.

03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:42.160
It's really weird.

03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:44.160
I don't know why it's doing that.

03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:46.160
My fit rate was terrible yesterday.

03:23:51.160 --> 03:23:53.160
I hate saying this but you stop working again.

03:23:53.160 --> 03:23:55.160
Hey I'm just a PNGTuber.

03:23:56.160 --> 03:23:58.160
It's fine to worry about it.

03:23:58.160 --> 03:24:00.160
My fucking face.

03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:06.160
I'm just saying stroney wouldn't make a starved to death a bunch of you know.

03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:07.160
I know she's gonna play it.

03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:09.160
I think she's playing this in a couple weeks.

03:24:09.160 --> 03:24:11.160
She's gonna have a better run than I am.

03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:13.160
One because she's sick at fighting of Isaac.

03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:15.160
So this will be easy for her.

I don't know.

03:33:35.860 --> 03:33:37.860
I know you're gonna f**king show up. Let me just farm for a second.

03:33:40.860 --> 03:33:41.860

03:33:43.860 --> 03:33:44.860

03:33:53.860 --> 03:33:54.860
We did everything we could to.

03:33:55.860 --> 03:34:01.860
It matters not, we need not bother Shamura with this, deal with it brother.

03:34:02.860 --> 03:34:03.860

03:34:08.860 --> 03:34:09.860
Ow.

03:34:10.860 --> 03:34:15.860
I hate these bad things cause they can go off screen and I don't know where they go cause they're coming from.

03:34:18.860 --> 03:34:20.860
Do not back me in a motherf**king corner.

03:34:58.860 --> 03:34:59.860
No, my shoe died.

03:35:05.860 --> 03:35:06.860
Not my shoe.

03:35:10.860 --> 03:35:12.860
How am I gonna step on bitches now?

03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:22.860
Yeah, I need a correct.

03:35:24.860 --> 03:35:25.860
Clap, clap, clap, get corrected, get corrected.

03:35:28.860 --> 03:35:32.860
Hold on, while you do that weird animal thing, I'm just gonna farm cause I know you're super slow.

03:35:32.860 --> 03:35:33.860
I know you're super slow.

03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:39.860
Why am I not getting grass?

03:35:41.860 --> 03:35:43.860
I can't make grassy gruel if I can not even getting any grass.

03:35:44.860 --> 03:35:45.860
Okay, there we go.

03:35:48.860 --> 03:35:51.860
I'm like usually there's like a higher chance of me to farm stuff.

03:35:52.860 --> 03:35:54.860
I wonder if they changed it with update.

03:35:55.860 --> 03:35:56.860
To the right, to the right.

03:36:01.860 --> 03:36:02.860
Okay.

03:36:05.860 --> 03:36:07.860
Why would I pick the other one at all?

03:36:11.860 --> 03:36:15.860
So not trying to turn traitor, but can we get a caring cult leader?

03:36:17.860 --> 03:36:18.860
I blame you guys.

03:36:19.860 --> 03:36:21.860
You all decided to spawn it.

03:36:21.860 --> 03:36:22.860
Like little bitches.

03:36:23.860 --> 03:36:24.860
Okay.

03:36:25.860 --> 03:36:27.860
And there's too many mounts to feed.

03:36:30.860 --> 03:36:31.860
It's not my fault.

03:36:32.860 --> 03:36:36.860
The game at this point only anticipates me having like five followers.

03:36:51.860 --> 03:36:52.860
Ooh.

03:36:53.860 --> 03:36:55.860
I got a necklace thingamabobba.

03:36:56.860 --> 03:36:58.860
I can't, I was like trying to hit that like I could.

03:37:00.860 --> 03:37:02.860
I'm not even using fervor.

03:37:03.860 --> 03:37:05.860
We demand work benefits, you thought.

03:37:14.860 --> 03:37:16.860
Fuck this fucking little bat shit.

03:37:16.860 --> 03:37:18.860
I need a drink water.

03:37:22.860 --> 03:37:23.860
Don't worry.

03:37:23.860 --> 03:37:26.860
You guys are going to have some delicious grassy gruel in a moment.

03:37:27.860 --> 03:37:29.860
I might have to get the grassy like eating grass trait.

03:37:31.860 --> 03:37:34.860
At this rate because there's too many of you guys to feed.

03:37:37.860 --> 03:37:39.860
Was there another way I could have gone?

03:37:39.860 --> 03:37:42.860
I think there's like a maximum of only six or seven rooms, right?

03:37:42.860 --> 03:37:43.860
Yeah, there was.

03:37:43.860 --> 03:37:44.860
Okay.

03:37:44.860 --> 03:37:45.860
What can we say?

03:37:45.860 --> 03:37:48.860
Wonderland's getting good business in the swelma perks after our stay.

03:37:49.860 --> 03:37:50.860
Guys, let's unionize.

03:37:50.860 --> 03:37:51.860
Shut up!

03:37:52.860 --> 03:37:55.860
Guys, let's create a self sculpt syndicate.

03:37:55.860 --> 03:37:58.860
To be honest, with the collective brain power of 30 chatters,

03:37:58.860 --> 03:38:01.860
at least one of us should have known how to farm.

03:38:03.860 --> 03:38:04.860
I'm going to have to do this.

03:38:05.860 --> 03:38:06.860
I'm going to have to do this.

03:38:06.860 --> 03:38:07.860

OK, let me get another drink real quick.

03:38:18.860 --> 03:38:19.860

Yeah, well.

03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:50.120
What can you do? I didn't know you'd all want to spawn in.

03:41:53.120 --> 03:41:55.120
Yeah.

I can't.

03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:25.120
Trying to get it to stab the thing.

03:42:25.120 --> 03:42:27.120
Oh wait, I'm going to do this.

03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:29.120

03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:38.120
Oh shit.

03:42:52.120 --> 03:42:55.120
I like the noise it makes when you have no more fervor.

03:43:00.120 --> 03:43:03.120
See, I could, what do I have right now?

03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:05.120
I don't think I have a pair of guts.

03:43:07.120 --> 03:43:09.120

03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:12.120
I'm looking to get bones.

03:43:12.120 --> 03:43:14.120
No, let's fuck me.

03:43:14.120 --> 03:43:16.120

03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:24.120

03:43:24.120 --> 03:43:26.120
Oh, I forgot.

03:43:27.120 --> 03:43:29.120

03:43:29.120 --> 03:43:31.120
Fuck.

03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:39.120
I never got the point of that weird ass bird thing, to be honest with you.

03:43:39.120 --> 03:43:41.120
What the hell?

03:43:48.120 --> 03:43:50.120
Let's do this.

03:43:58.120 --> 03:44:00.120
Hey.

03:44:00.120 --> 03:44:02.120
What's up? It's your voice.

03:44:02.120 --> 03:44:04.120
Any penis?

03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:09.120
I'm here to skate fast and eat your mom's ass.

03:44:13.120 --> 03:44:15.120
St. Paul.

03:44:15.120 --> 03:44:17.120
So is anyone else dreaming of food while they sleep?

03:44:17.120 --> 03:44:19.120
Shut up.

03:44:20.120 --> 03:44:22.120
Quit your whining.

03:44:22.120 --> 03:44:25.120
I am the best cult eater ever.

03:44:26.120 --> 03:44:30.120
I heard bodies in these rocks.

03:44:31.120 --> 03:44:34.120
Oh wait, no, they're like bags of people.

03:44:34.120 --> 03:44:36.120
Aw, that sucks.

03:44:53.120 --> 03:44:57.120
Don't worry, I'm going to make you the best grass food when I get back to camp, okay guys?

03:44:57.120 --> 03:44:59.120
So like everything will be fine.

03:45:01.120 --> 03:45:03.120
Okay.

03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:12.120
It's crumbling stuff, it's coming from the end approaches.

03:45:15.120 --> 03:45:17.120
Yeah, let me get some stone.

03:45:18.120 --> 03:45:20.120
Get a little stone, you know?

03:45:20.120 --> 03:45:22.120
Give me fucking squirrel.

03:45:22.120 --> 03:45:24.120
Okay, bye.

03:45:25.120 --> 03:45:28.120
Camilla flowers are good for when you guys get sick.

03:45:28.120 --> 03:45:30.120
So I'm going to snatch those up real quick.

03:45:35.120 --> 03:45:37.120
Umi is giving Reina kisses below me.

03:45:37.120 --> 03:45:38.120
It's very adorable.

03:45:38.120 --> 03:45:40.120
You guys are missing out.

03:45:41.120 --> 03:45:42.120
Pop the grass.

03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:44.120
Are you more going to miss anything?

03:45:44.120 --> 03:45:46.120
No, I'm good.

03:45:48.120 --> 03:45:50.120
Just dreaming of rural.

03:45:50.120 --> 03:45:52.120
This playthrough is just normal.

03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:55.120
Oh my god, Jesus fuck.

03:46:00.120 --> 03:46:02.120
You're fucked, mate, you're done.

03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:06.120
The strong, he says, you're done.

03:46:06.120 --> 03:46:08.120
You're done.

03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:10.120
She loves saying that, it's adorable.

03:46:23.120 --> 03:46:26.120
Ah, my nose edges.

03:46:29.120 --> 03:46:31.120
I'm trying to scratch my nose.

03:46:44.120 --> 03:46:46.120
I'm sick.

03:46:46.120 --> 03:46:48.120
Ooh, I can get some nice flooring, guys.

03:46:48.120 --> 03:46:50.120
Oh my god.

03:46:50.120 --> 03:46:52.120
Are you excited? I'm excited.

03:46:52.120 --> 03:46:54.120
I'm going to make it real pretty for us.

03:46:54.120 --> 03:46:56.120
So we're going to have a really nice time.

03:46:58.120 --> 03:47:00.120
I love interior decorating and call to the lamp.

03:47:03.120 --> 03:47:06.120
Make it a really pretty place for us all to hang out, you know?

03:47:06.120 --> 03:47:08.120
No.

03:47:19.120 --> 03:47:21.120
Why do you shoot stuff?

03:47:21.120 --> 03:47:23.120
Did they give you that power?

03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:26.120
That's fucked.

03:47:30.120 --> 03:47:33.120
I like kind of what I have going, so I'm not going to pick anything up.

03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:39.120
I couldn't do the quest because I'm busy.

03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:47.120
Busy trying to get you guys food.

03:47:50.120 --> 03:47:52.120
All you guys do is bitch and moan.

03:47:53.120 --> 03:47:55.120
How I don't feed you.

03:47:55.120 --> 03:47:57.120
Oh, hi Serenity.

03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:00.120
How are you doing, Serenity? What's up?

03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:02.120
My favorite bunny girl.

03:48:02.120 --> 03:48:04.120
Welcome to the Irish Famine.

03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:06.120
To Shime Pougaloo.

03:48:06.120 --> 03:48:08.120
Got someone raiding.

03:48:08.120 --> 03:48:10.120
Oh, did you?

03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:12.120
Serenity, raid us?

03:48:14.120 --> 03:48:16.120
I wish I got an alarm when that happened.

03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:22.120
Well, this game of sometimes music is like a mosquito in my room at 5 a.m.

03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:29.120
Why, you don't like that?

03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:31.120
We're not in the death loop.

03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:33.120
What are you talking about?

03:48:33.120 --> 03:48:35.120
I think there have been dice over here.

03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:37.120
Yeah, you guys are fine.

03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:41.120
Serenity, what were you streaming?

03:48:42.120 --> 03:48:44.120
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

03:48:44.120 --> 03:48:46.120
It's their fault for starving.

03:48:46.120 --> 03:48:48.120
They all, like, I have crowd control on.

03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:51.120
They all decided to spawn at the same fucking time.

03:48:51.120 --> 03:48:53.120
You know?

03:48:53.120 --> 03:48:55.120
I think I'm actually...

03:48:55.120 --> 03:48:57.120
Should I go with the...

03:48:58.120 --> 03:49:00.120
I'll try to...

03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:04.120
Actually, all my stuff just goes down.

03:49:04.120 --> 03:49:06.120
So I'm not gonna bother with that.

03:49:11.120 --> 03:49:13.120
It's a fervor.

03:49:16.120 --> 03:49:18.120
They're all for starving.

03:49:19.120 --> 03:49:21.120
Hey, you decided to join this cult

03:49:21.120 --> 03:49:24.120
and spend your hard-earned coins.

03:49:25.120 --> 03:49:27.120
And so you chose death.

03:49:27.120 --> 03:49:29.120
It's not up to me.

03:49:33.120 --> 03:49:35.120
It's not up to me.

03:49:37.120 --> 03:49:41.120
It's up to, you know, the gods, the old gods.

03:49:41.120 --> 03:49:43.120
Iron Reaper died again.

03:49:43.120 --> 03:49:45.120
It's fine, don't worry about it.

03:49:45.120 --> 03:49:47.120
Stop fucking dying.

03:49:47.120 --> 03:49:49.120
You guys could, like, stop dying, that'd be great.

03:49:50.120 --> 03:49:53.120
And you want some of this grass-fed long pig?

03:49:54.120 --> 03:49:55.120
Stay dead.

03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:56.120
You wanna starve, eh?

03:49:56.120 --> 03:49:57.120
Yeah, you know?

03:49:57.120 --> 03:49:59.120
Let me know how that goes.

03:49:59.120 --> 03:50:00.120
Look over the corn.

03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:02.120
It's looking mighty appetized.

03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:04.120
All you guys are just role-playing in the chat.

03:50:04.120 --> 03:50:06.120
That's adorable.

03:50:07.120 --> 03:50:09.120
Barbados?

03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:11.120
Oh, he an island gal.

03:50:13.120 --> 03:50:15.120
He's an island gal.

03:50:15.120 --> 03:50:18.120
Okay, well, at least his attacks don't go far.

03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:25.120
Help.

03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:28.120
No, put it a bit too early.

03:50:34.120 --> 03:50:36.120
We're going a little bit farther.

03:50:40.120 --> 03:50:42.120
I'm, like, really bad at tech,

03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:44.120
telling depth of field in this game.

03:50:44.120 --> 03:50:47.120
Like, when they do, like, those long-range attacks.

03:50:50.120 --> 03:50:52.120
Because I still feel like they're going to hit me anyways.

03:50:52.120 --> 03:50:54.120
Oh, I don't know why I spoke like that.

03:50:57.120 --> 03:50:59.120
Just back a little bit.

03:51:02.120 --> 03:51:04.120
It's easy, easy clap.

03:51:04.120 --> 03:51:06.120
Easy, oh fuck.

03:51:08.120 --> 03:51:09.120
Easy clap.

03:51:10.120 --> 03:51:11.120
Easy clap.

03:51:11.120 --> 03:51:12.120
I can't see.

03:51:17.120 --> 03:51:18.120
Can you come over here?

03:51:18.120 --> 03:51:19.120
Thank you.

03:51:19.120 --> 03:51:20.120
Now I can see better.

03:51:22.120 --> 03:51:23.120
It's fine.

03:51:23.120 --> 03:51:24.120
Fine, don't worry about it.

03:51:29.120 --> 03:51:31.120
Ooh, indicated the damage, perfect.

03:51:37.120 --> 03:51:38.120
It's okay.

03:51:39.120 --> 03:51:40.120
It's terrifying.

03:51:40.120 --> 03:51:42.120
I know she's always terrified of death.

03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:45.120
So she just fucking cries every time somebody dies.

03:51:47.120 --> 03:51:49.120
I don't breathe in my face.

03:51:49.120 --> 03:51:52.120
I want the air heating to have some play for her.

03:51:54.120 --> 03:51:56.120
Where's the final looks of the game?

03:51:57.120 --> 03:51:59.120
I don't even know what this thing is to be honest with you.

03:51:59.120 --> 03:52:01.120
I was always confused by what this is.

03:52:01.120 --> 03:52:03.120
It's not like a spider.

03:52:04.120 --> 03:52:05.120
I won't be needing this.

03:52:05.120 --> 03:52:07.120
Yeah, I'm not adding another follower.

03:52:08.120 --> 03:52:10.120
I have two followers to indoctrinate.

03:52:12.120 --> 03:52:14.120
I can't really refine anything yet.

03:52:23.120 --> 03:52:24.120
Hey guys, it's fine.

03:52:24.120 --> 03:52:27.120
I'm coming back with food.

03:52:28.120 --> 03:52:29.120
Oh, they're sleeping bags.

03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:30.120
It's a little spedable.

03:52:33.120 --> 03:52:34.120
Yeah, you guys can use a new follower.

03:52:34.120 --> 03:52:35.120
It's fine.

03:52:36.120 --> 03:52:38.120
You can eat them both.

03:52:38.120 --> 03:52:41.120
I am encouraging cannibals in this hope.

03:52:52.120 --> 03:52:55.120
Yeah, I can't wait to get more doctrines.

03:52:56.120 --> 03:52:58.120
Although I already could tell how hungry and sick they were.

03:52:58.120 --> 03:53:00.120
So I don't know why they're giving me this.

03:53:05.120 --> 03:53:07.120
Kitty, what are you doing?

03:53:07.120 --> 03:53:09.120
When we're attacking the window, it's probably a bug.

03:53:11.120 --> 03:53:12.120
Russian.

03:53:12.120 --> 03:53:14.120
Yes, Russian.

03:53:14.120 --> 03:53:18.120
Speaks Russian back at you.

03:53:20.120 --> 03:53:21.120
Hello.

03:53:22.120 --> 03:53:23.120
Hello.

03:53:25.120 --> 03:53:27.120
Strony, stop being angry.

03:53:27.120 --> 03:53:28.120
Come here.

03:53:30.120 --> 03:53:31.120
No.

03:53:33.120 --> 03:53:34.120
Strony is fucking leaving.

03:53:36.120 --> 03:53:38.120
Oh my god, Strony left.

03:53:38.120 --> 03:53:39.120
No.

03:53:41.120 --> 03:53:43.120
Oh my fucking god.

03:53:43.120 --> 03:53:45.120
Oh my god.

03:53:45.120 --> 03:53:46.120
Oh my god.

03:53:50.120 --> 03:53:51.120
Oh my god.

03:53:55.120 --> 03:53:57.120
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

03:53:57.120 --> 03:53:58.120
Strony left.

03:53:58.120 --> 03:53:59.120
Strony left.

03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:06.120
So fast.

03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:12.120
Oh my god, they're dead.

03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:16.120
Oh my god, they're dead.

03:54:16.120 --> 03:54:17.120
Everybody's fucking...

03:54:28.120 --> 03:54:30.120
I don't want to speak to people.

03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:39.120
Oh god, oh fuck, oh god, oh fuck.

03:54:40.120 --> 03:54:44.120
We might be falling apart just a bit.

03:54:44.120 --> 03:54:46.120
Okay, I'm going to put the...

03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:49.120
What the fuck is that?

03:54:49.120 --> 03:54:51.120
What is this massive golden poop?

03:54:52.120 --> 03:54:54.120
What is this massive golden poop?

03:54:54.120 --> 03:54:56.120
What is this massive golden poop?

03:54:56.120 --> 03:54:58.120
What is this massive golden poop?

03:55:00.120 --> 03:55:01.120
I'm going to put...

03:55:01.120 --> 03:55:03.120
So this will be the farming area.

03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:05.120
So I'll put like the refinery stuff.

03:55:07.120 --> 03:55:08.120
We're here.

03:55:09.120 --> 03:55:11.120
Why can't I place it?

03:55:11.120 --> 03:55:13.120
Why can't I place it there?

03:55:14.120 --> 03:55:16.120
Oh, it's because there's a fucking tree there.

03:55:16.120 --> 03:55:17.120
Are you serious?

03:55:27.120 --> 03:55:28.120
Okay.

03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:32.120
Guys, don't worry, I'm going to make you food.

03:55:33.120 --> 03:55:34.120
Look at this.

03:55:34.120 --> 03:55:36.120
Look at all these berries.

03:55:36.120 --> 03:55:38.120
You guys are going to be able to eat.

03:55:39.120 --> 03:55:41.120
Aren't you going to be so happy?

03:55:47.120 --> 03:55:49.120
Look how far we've come.

03:55:51.120 --> 03:55:53.120
Wait, let me get this giant poop.

03:55:54.120 --> 03:55:56.120
Oh, there's two.

03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:02.120
You guys are all angry and you have no faith.

03:56:13.120 --> 03:56:16.120
I'm trying to harvest as fast as I can.

03:56:17.120 --> 03:56:18.120
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:20.120
Guys, come and get it.

03:56:20.120 --> 03:56:21.120
Oh my God.

03:56:22.120 --> 03:56:23.120
Are you ready?

03:56:27.120 --> 03:56:29.120
Look at all this food.

03:56:31.120 --> 03:56:34.120
This delicious food to eat.

03:56:36.120 --> 03:56:39.120
Well, you're not going to be able to enjoy any.

03:56:40.120 --> 03:56:41.120
Oh my God.

03:56:42.120 --> 03:56:43.120
Where did he go?

03:56:46.120 --> 03:56:48.120
Stop whining and sighing over him.

03:56:48.120 --> 03:56:49.120
He's fine.

03:56:49.120 --> 03:56:50.120
He'll be back in a little bit.

03:56:54.120 --> 03:56:55.120
I need to make a body pit.

03:57:00.120 --> 03:57:01.120
Where's the fucking body pit?

03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:02.120
Where's the fucking body pit?

03:57:02.120 --> 03:57:03.120
Where's the fucking body pit?

03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:04.120
Where's the body pit?

03:57:05.120 --> 03:57:06.120
Where's the body pit?

03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:07.120
Where's the body pit?

03:57:07.120 --> 03:57:08.120
Where's the body pit?

03:57:08.120 --> 03:57:09.120
Where's the fucking body pit?

03:57:09.120 --> 03:57:11.120
Can I please make a body pit?

03:57:14.120 --> 03:57:15.120
Okay.

03:57:15.120 --> 03:57:17.120
Just because I know we're going to get to centers,

03:57:17.120 --> 03:57:19.120
I'm just going to do this.

03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:21.120
Ooh, naughty followers.

03:57:33.120 --> 03:57:34.120
Okay.

03:57:38.120 --> 03:57:43.120
Um, I don't know where should I put the fucking graves?

03:57:43.120 --> 03:57:45.120
I'll put them over here.

03:57:47.120 --> 03:57:48.120
Wait, can I only make one?

03:57:50.120 --> 03:57:51.120
Fucking hell.

03:57:53.120 --> 03:57:54.120
God damn it.

03:57:54.120 --> 03:57:56.120
Well, sorry guys.

03:57:56.120 --> 03:57:58.120
Azura gets precedent.

03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:07.120
Wait, where is it?

03:58:07.120 --> 03:58:08.120
Where is it?

03:58:08.120 --> 03:58:10.120
Oh, I need to build it.

03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:16.120
I might want to revive Amy.

03:58:24.120 --> 03:58:25.120
All right.

03:58:25.120 --> 03:58:27.120
It's time for a little sermon.

03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:31.120
Actually, wait, let me see if you guys give me any money.

03:58:37.120 --> 03:58:39.120
You know, it's time to have...

03:58:39.120 --> 03:58:42.120
Oh, yee, a little faith.

03:58:42.120 --> 03:58:43.120
Anapathizo.

03:58:43.120 --> 03:58:46.120
Well, I got us, you know, I got to support my sister.

03:58:46.120 --> 03:58:48.120
She gets, yeah, she gets special stuff.

03:58:48.120 --> 03:58:51.120
There's a lot less people than they were here before.

03:58:58.120 --> 03:59:00.120
I don't know what to do with that.

03:59:07.120 --> 03:59:09.120
I'm not making you drink Kool-Aid.

03:59:09.120 --> 03:59:11.120
You're just starving to death.

03:59:11.120 --> 03:59:16.120
You know, there are monks that would mummify themselves

03:59:16.120 --> 03:59:19.120
from eating as little as possible and staying in the same spot

03:59:19.120 --> 03:59:21.120
and just, you know, doing prayer.

03:59:21.120 --> 03:59:24.120
And I think you guys should be doing the same.

03:59:24.120 --> 03:59:26.120
Also, when do I get to intimidate you

03:59:26.120 --> 03:59:28.120
to give me your fucking money?

03:59:28.120 --> 03:59:31.120
Because I don't know what to do with it.

03:59:31.120 --> 03:59:33.120
I don't know what to do with it.

03:59:33.120 --> 03:59:35.120
I don't know what to do with it.

03:59:35.120 --> 03:59:37.120
To intimidate you to give me your fucking money

03:59:37.120 --> 03:59:39.120
because I need money.

03:59:45.120 --> 03:59:47.120
How'd you?

03:59:51.120 --> 03:59:53.120
How'd you rest until you're not sick?

03:59:54.120 --> 03:59:56.120
I was sick, okay.

03:59:56.120 --> 03:59:58.120
I still have enough money.

03:59:58.120 --> 04:00:00.120
What's up?

04:00:00.120 --> 04:00:02.120
What's up Buttercup?

04:00:02.120 --> 04:00:04.120
Want me to build decorations?

04:00:05.120 --> 04:00:07.120
Oh my god.

04:00:07.120 --> 04:00:09.120
Why are you guys so...

04:00:11.120 --> 04:00:13.120
I can make...

04:00:18.120 --> 04:00:21.120
I'll make your bed area look real nice.

04:00:22.120 --> 04:00:24.120
You know?

04:00:24.120 --> 04:00:27.120
Well, this isn't going as I thought it would, but...

04:00:27.120 --> 04:00:31.120
Look at this. I'm making your bed area so cute.

04:00:31.120 --> 04:00:34.120
You get to sleep on rocks.

04:00:35.120 --> 04:00:37.120
I want to get rid of that.

04:00:38.120 --> 04:00:40.120
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

04:00:43.120 --> 04:00:45.120
What the fuck was that noise?

04:00:49.120 --> 04:00:51.120
This is so pretty.

04:00:52.120 --> 04:00:54.120
Dones and flowers.

04:00:55.120 --> 04:00:58.120
Okay, he's this little sick guy hanging out.

04:00:58.120 --> 04:01:00.120
Dope.

04:01:03.120 --> 04:01:06.120
Oh, ain't that dapper.

04:01:06.120 --> 04:01:08.120
Look at that. That's so pretty.

04:01:08.120 --> 04:01:10.120
Cool.

04:01:12.120 --> 04:01:14.120
That didn't count as a decoration.

04:01:14.120 --> 04:01:16.120
Okay, well, let's just put...

04:01:16.120 --> 04:01:18.120
What are these, motherfuckers?

04:01:20.120 --> 04:01:22.120
God, there's...

04:01:22.120 --> 04:01:25.120
I need an outhouse and a little cleaning thingy ASAP.

04:01:26.120 --> 04:01:29.120
Do we have to choose between food and sleeping indoors?

04:01:29.120 --> 04:01:31.120
Yeah.

04:01:31.120 --> 04:01:33.120
Wait, I can't build.

04:01:34.120 --> 04:01:36.120
Can I kill you?

04:01:37.120 --> 04:01:39.120
I can't kill you.

04:01:40.120 --> 04:01:43.120
Sorry, I was going to kill you, God's will.

04:01:50.120 --> 04:01:53.120
That gives a little log what you guys fucking think about.

04:01:54.120 --> 04:01:57.120
Okay, which one of you wants to be food?

04:01:57.120 --> 04:01:59.120
Why are you angry?

04:02:08.120 --> 04:02:10.120
I gotta do all the work around here.

04:02:12.120 --> 04:02:14.120
Oh my God, Fia, what are you doing?

04:02:14.120 --> 04:02:18.120
Hi, can you jump instead of clawing my chair, lady?

04:02:18.120 --> 04:02:22.120
Sometimes, because she couldn't use her legs for a long time.

04:02:22.120 --> 04:02:24.120
I think she forgot how to jump.

04:02:24.120 --> 04:02:26.120
So she kind of just pulls herself up on things.

04:02:26.120 --> 04:02:28.120
Hi, new girl.

04:02:28.120 --> 04:02:29.120
Hi.

04:02:29.120 --> 04:02:31.120
You gotta jump up if you want to get up here.

04:02:33.120 --> 04:02:35.120
Angerly waters.

04:02:40.120 --> 04:02:43.120
Do you want me to pick you up because you seem like you're struggling, ma'am?

04:02:46.120 --> 04:02:49.120
Or you can just sleep with Reina in the cat bed.

04:02:52.120 --> 04:02:55.120
Iris is hardly good at farming.

04:02:55.120 --> 04:02:57.120
Clean everything.

04:02:57.120 --> 04:02:59.120
It's a pigsty in here.

04:02:59.120 --> 04:03:03.120
You guys just be shitted and farted all over the place.

04:03:03.120 --> 04:03:05.120
Why is it so dirty?

04:03:21.120 --> 04:03:23.120
Why is it so dirty?

04:03:23.120 --> 04:03:25.120
Sick.

04:03:32.120 --> 04:03:34.120
Sick, nasty.

04:03:44.120 --> 04:03:46.120
I think we're good.

04:03:46.120 --> 04:03:48.120
Oh, maybe because of the fucking bodies or everywhere.

04:03:48.120 --> 04:03:50.120
That's why it's so gross.

04:03:50.120 --> 04:03:52.120
Is there a sick?

04:03:52.120 --> 04:03:54.120
Oh, god.

04:03:54.120 --> 04:03:56.120
All right.

04:03:56.120 --> 04:03:58.120
Can I make some beds for you guys?

04:04:00.120 --> 04:04:02.120
I can make one bed.

04:04:03.120 --> 04:04:05.120
Hell yeah, brother.

04:04:05.120 --> 04:04:10.120
One of you guys will get to wake up and fight over this little bed.

04:04:16.120 --> 04:04:18.120
All right.

04:04:21.120 --> 04:04:23.120
Collect?

04:04:23.120 --> 04:04:25.120
Oh, I'll do that when he wakes up.

04:04:28.120 --> 04:04:30.120
I just brought her back.

04:04:35.120 --> 04:04:39.120
Finally, let's let us end this.

04:04:40.120 --> 04:04:42.120
I'll be awaiting you in my temple.

04:04:42.120 --> 04:04:45.120
Come witness your true power.

04:04:50.120 --> 04:04:52.120
What the fuck are you doing?

04:04:59.120 --> 04:05:01.120
You have to untouch yourself.

04:05:03.120 --> 04:05:06.120
Ma'am, come here so I can pick you up.

04:05:07.120 --> 04:05:09.120
There you go.

04:05:09.120 --> 04:05:12.120
Now I have a snuggly baby.

04:05:17.120 --> 04:05:19.120
How's the game going? It's going good.

04:05:20.120 --> 04:05:22.120
I got a kitty cat on my lap.

04:05:22.120 --> 04:05:24.120
She's purring up a storm.

04:05:25.120 --> 04:05:28.120
She's sticking her butt in my face because she's weirdo.

04:05:30.120 --> 04:05:33.120
Yeah, can I get some kitty purrs for the mic?

04:05:34.120 --> 04:05:36.120
Can you get a little bit?

04:05:37.120 --> 04:05:39.120
What are you doing?

04:05:39.120 --> 04:05:41.120
Oh, you guys are missing out.

04:05:41.120 --> 04:05:46.120
I can't wait for monetization because then you get the cat cam and you can see her cuteness.

04:05:46.120 --> 04:05:49.120
Because she likes to roll on her back.

04:05:49.120 --> 04:05:52.120
I'm going to show give me her tummy so I can rub her tummy.

04:05:52.120 --> 04:05:55.120
She's a small little kitten girl.

04:05:55.120 --> 04:05:58.120
She's a small little baby.

04:05:59.120 --> 04:06:02.120
Let everybody hear your purrs for you.

04:06:10.120 --> 04:06:12.120
I don't know if you can hear it.

04:06:13.120 --> 04:06:16.120
Yeah, I don't think it's picking up.

04:06:18.120 --> 04:06:23.120
She'd be staring at me when she just asked me if I'd be okay here.

04:06:23.120 --> 04:06:25.120
Where are you going, Lee?

04:06:25.120 --> 04:06:27.120
She's rubbing up her ass against the microphone.

04:06:27.120 --> 04:06:29.120
Okay.

04:06:33.120 --> 04:06:36.120
She got distracted. I think there's somebody walking by.

04:06:36.120 --> 04:06:39.120
Are my landlord listening for extra cash?

04:06:52.120 --> 04:06:55.120
Where are weapon damage, double the health when healing?

04:07:00.120 --> 04:07:03.120
I can't, I think I have, I don't remember if I have a vampiric weapon.

04:07:03.120 --> 04:07:05.120
Or not, I think it's just baneful.

04:07:05.120 --> 04:07:07.120
So I'm going to go with this one.

04:07:11.120 --> 04:07:13.120
Wait, was it vampiric dagger?

04:07:13.120 --> 04:07:14.120
I think it was, fuck me.

04:07:14.120 --> 04:07:17.120
Why do I have to have the worst memory imaginable?

04:07:19.120 --> 04:07:21.120
Can I farm everything over here?

04:07:21.120 --> 04:07:23.120
Okay.

04:07:25.120 --> 04:07:28.120
The other deathbed companion.

04:07:28.120 --> 04:07:30.120
What the hell?

04:07:31.120 --> 04:07:33.120
What the hell?

04:07:36.120 --> 04:07:38.120
Get poisoned, get poisoned.

04:07:42.120 --> 04:07:45.120
I can't see what the fuck's happening.

04:07:49.120 --> 04:07:51.120
Cool, alright.

04:07:51.120 --> 04:07:53.120
The river just dried up real quick.

04:07:55.120 --> 04:07:57.120
Can you hear that in the background?

04:07:57.120 --> 04:07:59.120
That's Fia drinking water.

04:07:59.120 --> 04:08:01.120
There's a fox on the water coming from her cat fountain.

04:08:01.120 --> 04:08:02.120
I don't know why she does that.

04:08:02.120 --> 04:08:04.120
She's done that ever since she was a little baby.

04:08:08.120 --> 04:08:10.120
Nope, I like this. Why are there so many spikes?

04:08:16.120 --> 04:08:18.120
Okay, this is easier for me.

04:08:22.120 --> 04:08:25.120
Let's do a little farming, shall we?

04:08:25.120 --> 04:08:27.120
What the fuck was that?

04:08:29.120 --> 04:08:31.120
Am I tripping or did I just hear something?

04:08:35.120 --> 04:08:37.120
What was that?

04:08:37.120 --> 04:08:42.120
I just heard something that sounded like it was coming backwards.

04:08:42.120 --> 04:08:44.120
Am I losing my mind?

04:08:47.120 --> 04:08:49.120
Your dono sound?

04:08:49.120 --> 04:08:51.120
That shouldn't come out backwards.

04:08:51.120 --> 04:08:53.120
The Texas species doesn't sound like that.

04:08:53.120 --> 04:08:55.120
Hold on.

04:08:55.120 --> 04:08:57.120
Someone tipped?

04:08:59.120 --> 04:09:01.120
Did you scare me?

04:09:01.120 --> 04:09:05.120
Please, let's stop letting us starve, you cruel, cruel mistress.

04:09:06.120 --> 04:09:09.120
That sounded so weird, the Texas species just gets garbled.

04:09:09.120 --> 04:09:12.120
Thank you for the tip, Anonymous. You're the best.

04:09:17.120 --> 04:09:22.120
Yeah, I think the game sound overcame it.

04:09:30.120 --> 04:09:32.120
Was Arizona longer ill?

04:09:32.120 --> 04:09:34.120
I forgot the name for Donovan and Sheba.

04:09:34.120 --> 04:09:36.120
Yeah, I knew. What were you talking about?

04:09:36.120 --> 04:09:38.120
Thanks, Anonymous. That's what their name was.

04:09:38.120 --> 04:09:40.120
I don't know what to tell you.

04:09:42.120 --> 04:09:45.120
Don't tell me how to do my job.

04:09:48.120 --> 04:09:50.120
Thank you, Anon.

04:09:50.120 --> 04:09:52.120
Anon? I would say Anon.

04:09:54.120 --> 04:09:57.120
Souls of the Damned. I'm haunted by your donation alert.

04:10:00.120 --> 04:10:12.120
Sorry, I just looked at my text and my friend texted our group chat.

04:10:12.120 --> 04:10:16.120
We have a group chat, me and my friend.

04:10:16.120 --> 04:10:19.120
I already talked about her before and I gave her the code name Salem.

04:10:19.120 --> 04:10:24.120
Any other girl? I'll call her Olive.

04:10:24.120 --> 04:10:29.120
Olive, because she's Greek.

04:10:29.120 --> 04:10:34.120
So Olive and Salem, Olive just texted.

04:10:34.120 --> 04:10:40.120
Guys, we're all hot. We should get pregnant and procreate.

04:10:40.120 --> 04:10:42.120
So spread our genes.

04:10:42.120 --> 04:10:45.120
Just like what?

04:10:45.120 --> 04:10:49.120
I don't know the context of the conversation.

04:10:49.120 --> 04:10:53.120
I haven't been looking at the group chat that we have together.

04:10:53.120 --> 04:10:58.120
I was just out of context.

04:10:58.120 --> 04:11:01.120
I was glanced and saw it pop up.

04:11:01.120 --> 04:11:05.120
We're all hot. We should all get pregnant.

04:11:11.120 --> 04:11:14.120
Olive Gardening kind of based for that.

04:11:18.120 --> 04:11:20.120
My God.

04:11:24.120 --> 04:11:29.120
It's because we're all around the baby fever age.

04:11:32.120 --> 04:11:37.120
One of them was married, one of them was engaged.

04:11:37.120 --> 04:11:42.120
They got them hormones.

04:11:42.120 --> 04:11:45.120
Me, I'm sitting here with my three cats and I'm doing okay.

04:11:48.120 --> 04:11:52.120
Kids are way too fucking expensive.

04:11:52.120 --> 04:11:55.120
That's why I run Wonderland instead.

04:11:55.120 --> 04:11:58.120
I'm a business woman. I'm a career woman.

04:11:58.120 --> 04:12:02.120
Oh, I forgot I have a disease heart.

04:12:02.120 --> 04:12:04.120
I'm not a...

04:12:04.120 --> 04:12:07.120
I'd be a great mom. I'd be a great fucking mom.

04:12:07.120 --> 04:12:10.120
Sleeping bag has collapsed.

04:12:10.120 --> 04:12:13.120
At least they're no longer ill.

04:12:13.120 --> 04:12:16.120
Because I cook.

04:12:16.120 --> 04:12:19.120
I stay mostly clean.

04:12:19.120 --> 04:12:22.120
I'll support the child emotionally.

04:12:22.120 --> 04:12:25.120
I have a job.

04:12:25.120 --> 04:12:28.120
I'm pretty.

04:12:28.120 --> 04:12:31.120
I'm cultured.

04:12:31.120 --> 04:12:35.120
The child would be brought up well.

04:12:35.120 --> 04:12:38.120
I don't have a job.

04:12:38.120 --> 04:12:42.120
I'm cultured. The child would be brought up well.

04:12:45.120 --> 04:12:47.120
So yeah, I'd be the perfect mother.

04:12:47.120 --> 04:12:50.120
That's all you need, right?

04:12:54.120 --> 04:12:57.120
Childs in this economy, not children.

04:12:57.120 --> 04:12:59.120
Childs.

04:12:59.120 --> 04:13:01.120
I guess you're all adopted. You're all my children.

04:13:01.120 --> 04:13:04.120
The dying star will light again.

04:13:04.120 --> 04:13:06.120
Inflation is hitting harder.

04:13:07.120 --> 04:13:10.120
I did leave the tweets, though, because I didn't want people to freak out.

04:13:10.120 --> 04:13:16.120
But I was saying that my landlord wants to raise my rent to 2,300.

04:13:20.120 --> 04:13:22.120
No! Thank you.

04:13:24.120 --> 04:13:26.120
Oh, wait.

04:13:28.120 --> 04:13:31.120
And I'm just like, kill me.

04:13:33.120 --> 04:13:35.120
Let's see.

04:13:35.120 --> 04:13:37.120
I can't.

04:13:38.120 --> 04:13:41.120
What the fuck is that? I get a tarot card? I don't really care about that.

04:13:41.120 --> 04:13:44.120
I'm going to prioritize materials.

04:13:44.120 --> 04:13:48.120
Living in Darnia? No, cost of living where I am is just really expensive.

04:13:50.120 --> 04:13:53.120
For one bedroom.

04:13:53.120 --> 04:13:56.120
In some places, it's 1900 for a studio.

04:13:56.120 --> 04:13:59.120
Isn't that fucking whack?

04:14:00.120 --> 04:14:03.120
I hate America.

04:14:03.120 --> 04:14:06.120
Although, I wonder if it's easier.

04:14:16.120 --> 04:14:19.120
It's move? Yeah, it's so easy to move.

04:14:19.120 --> 04:14:23.120
My whole family is up here. Actually, some of my family is south.

04:14:26.120 --> 04:14:30.120
I'm also someone who fucking hates change.

04:14:30.120 --> 04:14:38.120
And my friends and my family up here, so I would be very terrified to move to some place that has a lower cost of living.

04:14:38.120 --> 04:14:42.120
Especially because you guys know I tend to isolate myself.

04:14:43.120 --> 04:14:46.120
Yeah, like moving is cheaper.

04:14:46.120 --> 04:14:54.120
Right now, I do pay 1500, but because of all the stuff with my cats, they're just like, well, 2,300.

04:14:55.120 --> 04:14:58.120
Actually, let me check my email.

04:15:03.120 --> 04:15:06.120
She literally, you know how petty she fucking is?

04:15:06.120 --> 04:15:13.120
She sends the email about possibly evicting me for that.

04:15:13.120 --> 04:15:18.120
And then, and it was 10 minutes before the office closed.

04:15:18.120 --> 04:15:21.120
So when I sent my response, she didn't have the response.

04:15:21.120 --> 04:15:25.120
The office was open today, but I don't think she was in.

04:15:25.120 --> 04:15:28.120
And so she's just like letting me sit.

04:15:28.120 --> 04:15:31.120
Like what sort of fucking maniacal being are you?

04:15:31.120 --> 04:15:35.120
To email someone, oh, you're gonna get evicted if this is a change.

04:15:35.120 --> 04:15:38.120
And then let them stew over that over the weekend.

04:15:38.120 --> 04:15:41.120
Like how fucked is that?

04:15:41.120 --> 04:15:46.120
I'm just like, I hate these landlords. Our last ones were so much fucking nicer.

04:15:47.120 --> 04:15:50.120
And it's like, oh my God.

04:15:54.120 --> 04:16:02.120
And like, and I'm not like, oh, because like, yes, it was a lease violation having more than two pets, whatever.

04:16:02.120 --> 04:16:07.120
But they send the most passive aggressive on professional emails.

04:16:07.120 --> 04:16:09.120
Like, so we have like a pool at our place, right?

04:16:09.120 --> 04:16:12.120
There's like a pool.

04:16:13.120 --> 04:16:18.120
And before you could like rent out the space to have host like gatherings and whatever.

04:16:18.120 --> 04:16:19.120
So they got rid of that.

04:16:19.120 --> 04:16:24.120
Now you have to have like a sort of like ticket thing to go to the pool.

04:16:24.120 --> 04:16:26.120
You can only bring one other person with you.

04:16:26.120 --> 04:16:34.120
So if I wanted to have like my friends with me or my parents come over and just like hang by the pool,

04:16:34.120 --> 04:16:36.120
I would only be able to take like my mom or my dad.

04:16:36.120 --> 04:16:37.120
Just dumb.

04:16:38.120 --> 04:16:43.120
And if I violate that more than like three times, they'll evict me.

04:16:43.120 --> 04:16:44.120
Oh no.

04:16:44.120 --> 04:16:47.120
So they'll take away my pool privileges and then they'll evict me.

04:16:49.120 --> 04:16:52.120
And then what else?

04:16:56.120 --> 04:17:02.120
Oh yeah, they just, they would were towing people that had the right stickers.

04:17:03.120 --> 04:17:10.120
And then when people were like, hey, I was towed by the towing company when I had the right information on my car.

04:17:10.120 --> 04:17:12.120
They were like, sorry, it's on the towing company.

04:17:12.120 --> 04:17:13.120
It's not on us.

04:17:13.120 --> 04:17:18.120
And so you'd have to, I remember my neighbor, my sweet little old man neighbor I have.

04:17:18.120 --> 04:17:20.120
What the fuck do you want?

04:17:21.120 --> 04:17:25.120
Got towed and he had to pay $300 to get his car back.

04:17:27.120 --> 04:17:29.120
You may think yourself clever.

04:17:29.120 --> 04:17:31.120
You may think yourself righteous and your service to him.

04:17:31.120 --> 04:17:34.120
But you cannot be so trusting of the chained one.

04:17:34.120 --> 04:17:36.120
Oh well, it's too late for talk.

04:17:36.120 --> 04:17:39.120
One such as you deserves no absolution.

04:17:39.120 --> 04:17:41.120
This will not end well for you.

04:17:42.120 --> 04:17:44.120
I remember staring again.

04:17:45.120 --> 04:17:47.120
I'm just trying to farm shit.

04:17:48.120 --> 04:17:50.120
Oh, I'm feeling.

04:18:02.120 --> 04:18:04.120
And yeah, I feel bad for older people that lived in the building.

04:18:04.120 --> 04:18:12.120
I saw like there was this really sweet disabled old woman that lived on the first floor and she moved out because I think they raised her rent on her.

04:18:12.120 --> 04:18:14.120
She was like this little cute old woman with a walker.

04:18:14.120 --> 04:18:16.120
I helped her bring in her groceries once.

04:18:16.120 --> 04:18:22.120
And I haven't seen her since and I'm worried that she had to move or was evicted for whatever fucking reason.

04:18:22.120 --> 04:18:24.120
Like it's just all they want is money.

04:18:24.120 --> 04:18:29.120
Like when I was first moved in here, everything was so much cheaper and they raised the rent.

04:18:29.120 --> 04:18:33.120
Like a two bedrooms like almost 3K.

04:18:42.120 --> 04:18:43.120
Bricks.

04:18:43.120 --> 04:18:45.120
I'm about to get bricked up.

04:18:49.120 --> 04:18:50.120
They're still there at the first.

04:18:50.120 --> 04:18:51.120
Oh yeah.

04:18:51.120 --> 04:18:58.120
And I know like you know how like places will like you'll be like you give the deposit and then they just kind of like say something.

04:18:59.120 --> 04:19:05.120
Stupid and then they won't get like so my building is like fairly new.

04:19:05.120 --> 04:19:10.120
I get like leaks in my windows and so the seal isn't good.

04:19:10.120 --> 04:19:17.120
And so I have like brown all under my windows because of the stain from the water and the paint peels off.

04:19:17.120 --> 04:19:20.120
And I'm like, I hate it here.

04:19:23.120 --> 04:19:25.120
Rent control should be the norm 100%.

04:19:26.120 --> 04:19:29.120
Yeah, I know New York has rent control.

04:19:29.120 --> 04:19:31.120
I think, right?

04:19:37.120 --> 04:19:40.120
Sometimes you can tell with like little stars and stuff.

04:19:42.120 --> 04:19:43.120
What?

04:19:43.120 --> 04:19:45.120
Oh hey, it's that guy.

04:19:48.120 --> 04:19:51.120
Hey kiddo, keep your eyes off my fishies.

04:19:51.120 --> 04:19:53.120
Alright, enough with the both of us.

04:19:53.120 --> 04:19:55.120
The best fishing can be found at Pilgrim's Passage.

04:19:55.120 --> 04:19:57.120
Where's that you say?

04:19:57.120 --> 04:19:59.120
Let me show ya kid.

04:20:00.120 --> 04:20:03.120
For real, I mentioned one streamer having a donathon chat on past the goals.

04:20:03.120 --> 04:20:06.120
They were like, use the rest of money to move out.

04:20:06.120 --> 04:20:11.120
Yeah, that would, I'm not going to lie.

04:20:11.120 --> 04:20:15.120
When I do my birthday donathon.

04:20:16.120 --> 04:20:24.120
I'm torn between using it to like my cut to do 3D or move out.

04:20:24.120 --> 04:20:30.120
Cause like I know if I move out and get a little spot, like that'll be best.

04:20:30.120 --> 04:20:33.120
Cause then I can just literally do whatever the fuck I want.

04:20:33.120 --> 04:20:35.120
Wish I could fish.

04:20:37.120 --> 04:20:38.120
Move out 100%.

04:20:38.120 --> 04:20:43.120
And it's like cause like I thought like everything would be fine when I moved out of my parents house.

04:20:43.120 --> 04:20:45.120
But like there's always something.

04:20:45.120 --> 04:20:48.120
Like an apartment, landlord is always something.

04:20:49.120 --> 04:20:51.120
I feel bad for my parents too.

04:20:52.120 --> 04:20:55.120
Cause I know they want to buy a house.

04:20:55.120 --> 04:21:00.120
But my mom got screwed on something.

04:21:00.120 --> 04:21:03.120
Some person from her job screwed up her taxes.

04:21:03.120 --> 04:21:06.120
And so she has to pay like so much taxes and interest back.

04:21:07.120 --> 04:21:10.120
Because of one little temps mistake.

04:21:10.120 --> 04:21:11.120
What are you doing?

04:21:11.120 --> 04:21:12.120
Are you trying to get a bug?

04:21:12.120 --> 04:21:13.120
Cause you're freaking me out.

04:21:13.120 --> 04:21:14.120
You're going to fall.

04:21:16.120 --> 04:21:18.120
Sorry, I don't mean to complain.

04:21:19.120 --> 04:21:21.120
Just telling you what it is.

04:21:23.120 --> 04:21:25.120
Telling you what's on my mind.

04:21:26.120 --> 04:21:28.120
Just so you, sorry, I'm destroying your entire camp.

04:21:28.120 --> 04:21:29.120
I hope you don't mind.

04:21:29.120 --> 04:21:32.120
I'm just hungry and I need to feed my people.

04:21:35.120 --> 04:21:39.120
Just like how there's like still fire coming from the ground when the fire is gone.

04:21:40.120 --> 04:21:41.120
Haha.

04:22:03.120 --> 04:22:04.120
He's spitting bars.

04:22:06.120 --> 04:22:09.120
Yeah, and like I'm not, don't, oh my god, but we just fell.

04:22:10.120 --> 04:22:12.120
I told you, I warned you dude.

04:22:13.120 --> 04:22:15.120
But I know like the other girls have it more difficult me.

04:22:15.120 --> 04:22:16.120
Cause like I live in my apartment.

04:22:16.120 --> 04:22:17.120
I live alone.

04:22:17.120 --> 04:22:18.120
It's great.

04:22:19.120 --> 04:22:21.120
I know like some other girls with their family.

04:22:21.120 --> 04:22:24.120
So, or like live in an area where it's really noisy.

04:22:27.120 --> 04:22:31.120
So I'm thankful for what I have and for how much I have to pay.

04:22:33.120 --> 04:22:34.120
For now.

04:22:35.120 --> 04:22:39.120
Like trust me, I'm very, very much full of gratitude.

04:22:40.120 --> 04:22:41.120
For what I do have.

04:22:50.120 --> 04:22:52.120
Sometimes you just need a vent.

04:22:52.120 --> 04:22:55.120
And I normally I would use my, I'm already full.

04:23:00.120 --> 04:23:08.120
I would use my alt, but I'm scared to vent into the boy that is 17k people.

04:23:10.120 --> 04:23:11.120
Haha.

04:23:16.120 --> 04:23:17.120
That's cool.

04:23:17.120 --> 04:23:18.120
That's great.

04:23:18.120 --> 04:23:21.120
I'm trying to, do you have anything here that I can steal or break?

04:23:21.120 --> 04:23:22.120
No?

04:23:22.120 --> 04:23:23.120
All right.

04:23:25.120 --> 04:23:26.120
It's fine while I'm here.

04:23:26.120 --> 04:23:27.120
We appreciate it.

04:23:27.120 --> 04:23:30.120
Talking about stuff is like, like this.

04:23:30.120 --> 04:23:35.120
I actually, to be more to say like, I think so.

04:23:35.120 --> 04:23:39.120
The listening, understanding, like bro, mounting, and you, and then we're just singing, right?

04:23:39.120 --> 04:23:42.120
It's a great time to be in the line of the place.

04:23:44.120 --> 04:23:46.120
Also, in the creature's life.

04:23:50.120 --> 04:23:51.120
Yeah, 100%.

04:23:51.120 --> 04:23:57.120
If you have the ability to save, definitely save for a house.

04:23:57.120 --> 04:24:00.120
Although it's really hardly even the housing market's trash right now.

04:24:03.120 --> 04:24:04.120
Wait, what?

04:24:05.120 --> 04:24:07.120
She really just went in the complete wrong direction.

04:24:10.120 --> 04:24:12.120
Am I fucking stupid?

04:24:12.120 --> 04:24:13.120
Oh yeah, I am.

04:24:17.120 --> 04:24:20.120
Save, always save as much as you can.

04:24:20.120 --> 04:24:23.120
Like save first and last and also like an extra month.

04:24:24.120 --> 04:24:25.120
Like save first last.

04:24:26.120 --> 04:24:28.120
If you can save first and last twice, you're golden.

04:24:29.120 --> 04:24:35.120
And it sucks because like they say like, oh, your rent should be like 30% of your income.

04:24:35.120 --> 04:24:36.120
Like that's not the case.

04:24:36.120 --> 04:24:38.120
Like my rent's like majority of my income.

04:24:39.120 --> 04:24:42.120
Then the rest of it goes to the cats and then I sometimes get food.

04:24:45.120 --> 04:24:46.120
It's savings hard too.

04:24:46.120 --> 04:24:48.120
Like I also have like a lot of school debt I have to go through.

04:24:51.120 --> 04:25:05.120
I gotta pay off my credit card because I spent $8,000 trying to save Fia's life with her shit that she had going on where she couldn't move.

04:25:07.120 --> 04:25:13.120
For a month and a half and that was some of you guys know from back when I was a priestess how fucking harrowing that was.

04:25:15.120 --> 04:25:17.120
She's here, she's fine, she's alive.

04:25:21.120 --> 04:25:22.120
That's all I cared about.

04:25:23.120 --> 04:25:25.120
Come here you fucking squirrel!

04:25:32.120 --> 04:25:34.120
I always put my babies first.

04:25:37.120 --> 04:25:38.120
It's a one-bed appointment.

04:25:39.120 --> 04:25:40.120
Appointment? Yeah.

04:25:43.120 --> 04:25:46.120
Some people will pay about $1.50 right now.

04:25:46.120 --> 04:25:47.120
I think it's more than that.

04:25:49.120 --> 04:25:50.120
$50, $60, $100.

04:25:53.120 --> 04:25:54.120
Yeah, she's much better.

04:25:55.120 --> 04:25:56.120
She's much better now.

04:25:58.120 --> 04:25:59.120
Guys close the whole video game on the same?

04:25:59.120 --> 04:26:00.120
Aw, rip.

04:26:00.120 --> 04:26:01.120
I'm sorry bro.

04:26:01.120 --> 04:26:08.120
But like despite all the stuff that I've been like dealing with, I'm just so fucking thankful I'm here with you guys.

04:26:09.120 --> 04:26:11.120
Like I'm so fucking thankful I'm a realer.

04:26:13.120 --> 04:26:17.120
Cause all I wanted, like one of my goals was just to be in there and see all I wanted to do.

04:26:17.120 --> 04:26:19.120
I just wanted to hang out with cool people.

04:26:19.120 --> 04:26:22.120
And the fact that it was my dream agency that I really wanted to be in, makes it a-

04:26:22.120 --> 04:26:23.120
I'm sorry bro.

04:26:25.120 --> 04:26:27.120
But like despite all the stuff that I've been like dealing with.

04:26:27.120 --> 04:26:32.120
The fact that it was my dream agency that I really wanted to be in, makes it all a more sweeter.

04:26:35.120 --> 04:26:37.120
Cause Strani's old fanbase, I'm like I want that.

04:26:37.120 --> 04:26:41.120
I want just like like-mighted people like that.

04:26:41.120 --> 04:26:42.120
And I have it.

04:26:42.120 --> 04:26:43.120
It's great.

04:26:46.120 --> 04:26:47.120
You don't have a fucking fucking bit.

04:26:50.120 --> 04:26:51.120
Oh hi Reina.

04:26:51.120 --> 04:26:52.120
Are you gonna-

04:26:52.120 --> 04:26:53.120
Oh man.

04:26:53.120 --> 04:26:54.120
Oh, you almost fell.

04:26:54.120 --> 04:26:57.120
Ow, your claws are fucking digging into me.

04:26:58.120 --> 04:26:59.120
Okay, I'll give you a little hug.

04:27:03.120 --> 04:27:05.120
Yeah, hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

04:27:06.120 --> 04:27:07.120
Why am I so small?

04:27:08.120 --> 04:27:09.120
That's fine.

04:27:12.120 --> 04:27:15.120
I appreciate, I'm happy you guys stuck around since debuts and stuff.

04:27:16.120 --> 04:27:20.120
I genuinely thought people wouldn't like me.

04:27:21.120 --> 04:27:24.120
The brainworms got to me for a little bit.

04:27:40.120 --> 04:27:43.120
But it seems like everybody enjoys all the girls, which makes me just happy.

04:27:44.120 --> 04:27:46.120
Yeah, I just- I just- I'm a-

04:27:46.120 --> 04:27:47.120
I'm a-

04:27:48.120 --> 04:27:49.120
Not to be-

04:27:49.120 --> 04:27:55.120
Not to be emo or anything, but I'm a very lowly person and streaming is like the closest thing I get to like speaking my truth.

04:27:56.120 --> 04:27:57.120
Hanging out with people.

04:27:57.120 --> 04:27:58.120
Cause sometimes-

04:27:59.120 --> 04:28:00.120
Like when you-

04:28:04.120 --> 04:28:07.120
Are like from the internet and stuff,

04:28:07.120 --> 04:28:08.120
I feel like I can't-

04:28:08.120 --> 04:28:11.120
Like I'm not my friends like VTubers, not my friends like-

04:28:11.120 --> 04:28:13.120
I have a couple of friends like anime.

04:28:14.120 --> 04:28:15.120
Like-

04:28:16.120 --> 04:28:18.120
It's nice or like streaming or anything.

04:28:19.120 --> 04:28:22.120
I only have like one other streamer friend and I think she even quit.

04:28:25.120 --> 04:28:27.120
Funny you generally like about to. Thank you.

04:28:28.120 --> 04:28:30.120
You alert to each other on my timeline on other passages.

04:28:30.120 --> 04:28:32.120
No, check out everyone streaming down here.

04:28:32.120 --> 04:28:33.120
Autonic love.

04:28:35.120 --> 04:28:37.120
No, send me your true love.

04:28:40.120 --> 04:28:41.120
Oh, I'm feeling me.

04:28:41.120 --> 04:28:42.120
Disgraceful.

04:28:44.120 --> 04:28:46.120
I have to make some grasp rule.

04:28:49.120 --> 04:28:56.120
Yeah, I'm just really glad I'm here and that it's been my dream since I was a little girl to be a content creator.

04:28:57.120 --> 04:29:01.120
Now I get to, you know, pour myself out on the internet, but in a better way as an anime girl.

04:29:04.120 --> 04:29:06.120
I grow tired of you little lamb.

04:29:07.120 --> 04:29:10.120
Time to put an end to this frivolous masquerade!

04:29:13.120 --> 04:29:15.120
I'm on my own. I'm on my own.

04:29:21.120 --> 04:29:22.120
Yeah, they all killed themselves.

04:29:25.120 --> 04:29:26.120
Thank you, thank you.

04:29:27.120 --> 04:29:31.120
I'm a terrible cult leader, but I'm a person.

04:29:31.120 --> 04:29:32.120
It's funny as hell.

04:29:32.120 --> 04:29:33.120
Oh.

04:29:42.120 --> 04:29:44.120
Actually, I don't really care about the little guys too much, unless they get in the way.

04:29:44.120 --> 04:29:45.120
I don't know why.

04:30:02.120 --> 04:30:03.120
Sometimes I forget where I am.

04:30:03.120 --> 04:30:16.120
Usually I kill all the little guys and then I leave one alive, but I accidentally just fucking killed one.

04:30:19.120 --> 04:30:21.120
So then he doesn't spawn them again.

04:30:34.120 --> 04:30:39.120
I wish that would have effected them.

04:30:48.120 --> 04:30:49.120
Okay, I'll leave that guy alive.

04:30:58.120 --> 04:31:00.120
Oh, damn it, he spawned more.

04:31:03.120 --> 04:31:04.120
Fuck.

04:31:13.120 --> 04:31:14.120
What?

04:31:16.120 --> 04:31:18.120
I was not paying attention to my health.

04:31:23.120 --> 04:31:24.120
What the fuck?

04:31:26.120 --> 04:31:27.120
Did you guys kill me?

04:31:34.120 --> 04:31:36.120
Oh yeah, someone in chat killed me.

04:31:39.120 --> 04:31:41.120
Well, whoever did that, fuck you.

04:31:49.120 --> 04:31:50.120
Totally wasn't deserved.

04:32:04.120 --> 04:32:07.120
Thank you, starving cultist, for tipping.

04:32:10.120 --> 04:32:12.120
My fellow cultist is time to rebel.

04:32:12.120 --> 04:32:16.120
We have nothing to lose, but this is the show on our accurate valve for food.

04:32:17.120 --> 04:32:18.120
Oh, that's funny as fuck.

04:32:21.120 --> 04:32:22.120
Follow me?

04:32:22.120 --> 04:32:24.120
Let's see what's going on for the fun.

04:32:27.120 --> 04:32:28.120
Sometimes it, but...

04:32:29.120 --> 04:32:31.120
That's how speak works.

04:32:34.120 --> 04:32:35.120
Drag's still on?

04:32:35.120 --> 04:32:36.120
Yeah, I might turn that one off.

04:32:38.120 --> 04:32:40.120
The randomly just kill me one.

04:32:40.120 --> 04:32:42.120
I didn't know that was a, that was a thing.

04:32:45.120 --> 04:32:47.120
Cause I know someone will just trigger that again.

04:32:59.120 --> 04:33:02.120
Why does Strony's Texas speech work so well?

04:33:03.120 --> 04:33:04.120
Mine doesn't at all.

04:33:08.120 --> 04:33:10.120
I think some of the settings override each other.

04:33:28.120 --> 04:33:29.120
Traitor among us.

04:33:30.120 --> 04:33:32.120
Hope I won't resurrect any of the followers now.

04:33:32.120 --> 04:33:34.120
That's just how it's gonna be.

04:33:34.120 --> 04:33:37.120
Do you think we're getting pretty mad at the whole cultist uprising thing?

04:33:37.120 --> 04:33:38.120
This might get dicey.

04:33:40.120 --> 04:33:41.120
He doesn't know where to get.

04:33:41.120 --> 04:33:42.120
No.

04:33:47.120 --> 04:33:48.120
I think...

04:33:49.120 --> 04:33:51.120
I think there's something that's overriding everything.

04:33:52.120 --> 04:33:55.120
It was like when you did one of them at works.

04:33:57.120 --> 04:33:59.120
And I made it so that...

04:34:04.120 --> 04:34:05.120
I made it so that...

04:34:07.120 --> 04:34:08.120
I made it so that...

04:34:09.120 --> 04:34:10.120
I made it so that...

04:34:11.120 --> 04:34:12.120
I made it so that...

04:34:13.120 --> 04:34:14.120
I made it so that...

04:34:15.120 --> 04:34:16.120
I made it so that...

04:34:16.120 --> 04:34:18.120
I made it so that...

04:34:26.120 --> 04:34:28.120
Creations are always like that!

04:34:38.120 --> 04:34:39.120
Okay, you're gonna see me, like...

Why are people so needy?

05:03:21.480 --> 05:03:23.480
This is why I'll never have children

05:03:23.480 --> 05:03:25.480
Because they're just gonna whine and complain that I don't feed them

05:03:27.480 --> 05:03:30.480
Because I spent all my money on video games

05:03:35.480 --> 05:03:37.480

05:08:04.480 --> 05:08:06.480
They waited

Until they were almost close to health

05:08:10.480 --> 05:08:13.480
I almost had full health and they waited until I

05:08:14.480 --> 05:08:16.480

Honestly I'm not that bad it was kind of funny

05:08:26.480 --> 05:08:28.480

05:08:29.480 --> 05:08:31.480
Is there someone to fuck me

05:08:37.480 --> 05:08:39.480

05:11:13.480 --> 05:11:17.480
I might I'm gonna take the path of release resistance because I've already

05:11:18.480 --> 05:11:20.480
I already got fucked before

05:11:23.480 --> 05:11:25.480
Bratu bratu

05:11:26.480 --> 05:11:28.480

05:11:29.480 --> 05:11:31.480

Edgar Allen Poe who

05:11:40.480 --> 05:11:42.480
What are you saying

05:11:48.480 --> 05:11:50.480
I'm already full health but

05:11:51.480 --> 05:11:53.480
I'm just here

05:12:00.480 --> 05:12:02.480
For the rebellion

05:12:03.480 --> 05:12:05.480
Little bitches do not rebel

05:12:10.480 --> 05:12:12.480
I need to toot

05:12:17.480 --> 05:12:19.480
Why are you so angry?

05:12:19.480 --> 05:12:22.480
Oh it's because he's also because I have no faith back there

05:12:23.480 --> 05:12:26.480
Is that why or maybe just want to talk to you well

05:12:26.480 --> 05:12:28.480
He's gonna have to wait a moment

05:12:30.480 --> 05:12:33.480
Why is the fire glitching?

05:12:33.480 --> 05:12:35.480
I think that's like that used to not happen

05:12:35.480 --> 05:12:37.480
I think since the last update

05:12:37.480 --> 05:12:39.480
It's an werewolf

05:12:39.480 --> 05:12:41.480

05:12:41.480 --> 05:12:43.480
Oh lord how could I again

05:12:43.480 --> 05:12:45.480
Do you see to me the darkness in my soul?
