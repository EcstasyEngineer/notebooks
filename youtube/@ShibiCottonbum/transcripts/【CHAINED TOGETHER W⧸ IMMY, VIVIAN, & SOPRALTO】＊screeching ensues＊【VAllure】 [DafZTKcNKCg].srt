1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

5
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

6
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

7
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

8
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

9
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You

10
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You

11
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You

12
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You

13
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You

14
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You

15
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,940
It looks like those frogs with butts.

16
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,680
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about?

17
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,680
It's, I believe it's called a grease glass.

18
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,280
I don't like grease glass.

19
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,880
That's what all the grease is made.

20
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,440
That just doesn't look real to me.

21
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,080
It's like my brain doesn't want to.

22
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,120
I know, same.

23
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm just like.

24
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,320
Where's the tail?

25
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,400
Is that your guinea pig?

26
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
No, I do.

27
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
I used to own guinea pigs, but that's

28
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,640
why I knew they don't have tails.

29
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Oh, OK.

30
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,960
This is your butt, though.

31
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,000
It's my butt.

32
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,280
Oh my god, look at the little feet.

33
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
Yeah, they have little rat feet.

34
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,640
They are very rat-like.

35
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
I mean, they are rodents.

36
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,840
I'm allergic to guinea pigs and rodents.

37
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,520
You should be honestly fine with guinea pigs.

38
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,080
I think guinea pigs are pretty good with people who have allergies.

39
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,960
I'm allergic to rabbits and I'm allergic to guinea pigs.

40
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,440
Don't ask me why I'm a rabbit and I'm allergic to rabbits.

41
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
This is how things are.

42
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,680
Can I ask you why you're allergic to guinea pigs?

43
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,800
Because my friend had a guinea pig,

44
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,440
and I would always get itchy and like, sneeze-y.

45
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
That's crazy.

46
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,640
Guinea pigs are like one of the harder animals to be allergic to.

47
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
I guess I win that that.

48
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm allergic to animals that I wish I could love,

49
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,400
but I can't because they make me sneeze.

50
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
This is a shame.

51
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
You can't even love yourself.

52
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,280
I know I can't.

53
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,440
It stinks.

54
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,120
Last time I hung out with a bunny,

55
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,080
I almost went into anaphylactic shock.

56
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
It was, again, a travesty.

57
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,360
You know, I have a friend with seven cats.

58
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,960
And my roommate's like heavily allergic cats.

59
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,520
Oh, gosh.

60
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,960
So we go over and even with like air purifiers

61
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,440
and it cleaned the place regularly,

62
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,080
it like, he dies after like an hour.

63
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Oh, no.

64
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
Oh, no.

65
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Natural selection.

66
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,560
Oh, my God.

67
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Amy's going to kill me.

68
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,680
She's like, I'm sorry,

69
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,640
she be we have to make room for the strong

70
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,440
and then she just cuts my head off or something.

71
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,480
I don't know.

72
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,880
She just sticks her out.

73
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,640
I don't know if I'm allergic to rats.

74
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll be on our mice.

75
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know.

76
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,760
They're not they're not particularly fluffy creatures.

77
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah.

78
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
Are they hot or something?

79
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,800
It's like the spit.

80
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,240
It's a spit.

81
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
No, but they're soft.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,120
Rats are really soft.

83
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,480
I can't be back in the school.

84
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,960
You touched a rat.

85
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,640
Mm-hmm.

86
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Like.

87
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,560
What do you want to say?

88
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,160
Go ahead.

89
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,640
You know, I'm going to say,

90
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm going to hold my tongue on this one.

91
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm going to hold my tongue on this one.

92
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,720
No, no, no, no, go ahead, say it, go ahead, say it, say it.

93
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,960
I know you're going to bully me later.

94
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,880
No, no, no, no, say me my bully, though.

95
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
You mean my bully?

96
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
Say it.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
I'm not going to say it.

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm going to say it.

99
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
Don't you own rats?

100
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,640
I do.

101
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,760
Yeah, yeah, say it, go ahead, say it.

102
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm not trying to get beat up.

103
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,960
I'm trying to get beat up here.

104
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,080
Self-preservation.

105
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,640
She will survive me.

106
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,400
Not so much.

107
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
That's awesome.

108
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,640
It's like that.

109
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,480
It's like that scene from Ben 10 with Kevin.

110
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,560
He's like, you got to treat a woman like you treat your car.

111
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,600
And the girl is like, yeah, go on.

112
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,160
And he's like, no.

113
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,280
I swear it's not the same.

114
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,320
It's the way you bring up the scene every time I talk to you.

115
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,280
You know what's crazy?

116
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,240
I think it was like, honestly, seven-year-old me.

117
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Whenever they came out with like teen Ben 10,

118
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,400
I thought Kevin was so hot.

119
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,320
You're not wrong.

120
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
Kevin, who?

121
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Sorry, Emmy is the ultimate zoomer.

122
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,560
Kevin 11.

123
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Wait.

124
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
Kevin 11.

125
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,520
Kevin 11.

126
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,000
I think it's Kevin 11.

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Yeah, Kevin 11.

128
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,640
Kevin 11.

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
And he has like a car?

130
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,440
Yeah.

131
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,600
No, no, no, no.

132
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
OK, OK, there's like an ugly one.

133
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
Wait, I want to see.

134
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,000
How did this age, because I haven't seen that show in a long time.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,480
Oh, wait, no.

136
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
OK, wait, yeah.

137
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,640
There's like, there's an ugly one where he kind of looks

138
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,800
like a stoner and he does not look good.

139
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,200
Yeah.

140
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,920
No, not him.

142
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,320
No.

143
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
It was a different version.

144
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,960
No, I think I see the version you mean.

145
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Yeah, OK, there we go.

146
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,240
With the black t-shirt and the gray sleeve.

147
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,560
Yeah, that's the one.

148
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,880
That's the hotline.

149
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,240
OK, OK, OK.

150
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I see what you mean.

151
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,600
They were judging us.

152
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
She was like, what stoner ass?

153
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
The first picture I saw, I was like.

154
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,440
You look fine back in the day.

155
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,880
Oh, it was like the alien.

156
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
No, no, no, no, no.

157
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,400
Maybe Viv likes the alien.

158
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,240
Yeah, four arms is hot.

159
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,080
OK, maybe we should start the game.

160
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,040
Or we should introduce ourselves.

161
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's it.

162
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,960
Oh, I just see everyone new, but that's my bad.

163
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,240
Not everyone knows.

164
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,040
It's OK.

165
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,760
We can.

166
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,000
Because the only people that matter are the four people

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,360
in this call, and we love each other.

168
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm going to ask, are these the friends?

169
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
What's wrong with that?

170
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,640
What do you mean, are these the friends?

171
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
Of course, they're my friends.

172
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,240
Hi, I'm friends.

173
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,400
Are these the two friends you have, the three?

174
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
You not count, right?

175
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,520
Did you say two?

176
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,880
I didn't count myself, yeah.

177
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,360
She's more than a friend.

178
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,080
She's my wife.

179
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,560
She's her twin flame.

180
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,440
We could have been roommates.

181
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,480
Do you guys think, so what is a twin flame?

182
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,280
Is that like a soulmate?

183
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,160
It's a cult.

184
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,660
What?

185
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,160
No.

186
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,720
It's a cult.

187
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,360
No, no, no, that's that.

188
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
That's something else in me.

189
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,360
No.

190
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,440
A twin flame is usually someone that you're

191
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,240
meant to have a relationship in a karmic cycle.

192
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,040
And it's very hot and burny.

193
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,960
And it can actually be pretty toxic,

194
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,840
but very passionate and loving at the same time.

195
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,920
But they're not your soulmate.

196
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,640
It's like a shitty soulmate.

197
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,480
A shitty soulmate?

198
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,960
Yeah, that's us.

199
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,440
I beat her in game pigeon, and then I laugh at her.

200
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,360
OK, to be fair, I was going to go easy on her,

201
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,520
and then she said, you're going down.

202
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,400
Oh, she does play pool.

203
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,240
It's terrible.

204
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
I thought they would like that.

205
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
I thought they'll make it hotter for you.

206
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,200
She did.

207
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
So we played eight ball, and then she

208
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,000
made fun of me for a bad play, and then she immediately

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,600
hit the eight ball into the hole, and she lost.

210
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm not sure if we're first round.

211
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,760
I didn't know how eight ball works.

212
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,040
I didn't know, like, you literally couldn't touch the eight.

213
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I didn't know.

214
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,440
It was unlucky for me.

215
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,640
I mean, we should probably introduce ourselves.

216
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,560
Sorry, I'm reading my chat because they're like, wait,

217
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,280
isn't that like in the Will Smith movie in Hancock?

218
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,760
And I totally forgot that that is part of that movie.

219
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,320
What is?

220
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,160
The Twin Flames something, really.

221
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,880
But it is a cult.

222
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,360
You're right.

223
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
Yeah.

224
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,200
I only know the cult one.

225
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,680
It's all you need here.

226
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,180
OK.

227
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,640
OK, hi, hi, hi, everyone.

228
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Hi, chat.

229
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,120
I'm Amy.

230
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,800
I'm from Vealer.

231
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,760
Yeah.

232
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,280
Yeah, nice to meet you.

233
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Yeah.

234
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,920
Almost.

235
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,080
That's fair.

236
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,840
Who wants to go next?

237
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,040
If no one raises their hand, I'm going to choose.

238
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,880
OK, I won't be volatile.

239
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Um, hi.

240
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,160
Hello there.

241
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,120
My name is Sheebie Cottonbum of Gen 1, Vealers, Indulge.

242
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,800
And I'm your favorite dorky girl failure, Dom, failure.

243
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,400
What?

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,320
She already fucked it up.

245
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,560
Yeah.

246
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,040
Good job, Sheebie.

247
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
I tried my best.

248
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Viv, do you want to go first?

249
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
You want me?

250
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
Yeah, OK, I guess I'll go.

251
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,680
Hi, I'm Vivian Voss.

252
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,280
You're a good biker babe.

253
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Nice to meet you.

254
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,520
You're a biker?

255
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah.

256
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,880
Like a tricycle?

257
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,480
She doesn't even know what to say.

258
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,280
She just stared at the camera like, what the fuck did she just say?

259
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,160
I need to take a really big breath after that one.

260
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,960
I would have anger management issues.

261
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,480
She was having flashbacks to something else.

262
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,880
No, it's a unicycle.

263
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
She's the only human.

264
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,480
Wait, actually, no, Amy's human.

265
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,240
Are you human?

266
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
I thought you were like a, what is it called?

267
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
A gamer.

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,440
I hate you.

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
I have a different race.

270
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm a gamer.

271
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,120
I mean, look at that dent.

272
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,280
Oh, she just has that dent.

273
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,400
Chad, you guys didn't know this, but we were in call

274
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,240
and we were talking about something completely different.

275
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,640
And then I just went, why do you have a dent?

276
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,000
And I never noticed that he has a lovely cute dent in her head.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,480
I can rest my booba in it.

278
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,000
That's why it's dented.

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,160
Because it's totally not mine.

280
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,840
I actually kind of want that as a photo.

281
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,160
Me just like picking her up and tucking her under my breast.

282
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,840
This is just holding her closely to my bosom.

283
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,240
That was fair.

284
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,480
I was like that, too.

285
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,600
All right, so am I the only one who's played this before?

286
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,640
I haven't done my intro.

287
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,280
Oh, I'm leaving.

288
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,320
I'm just going to be down here.

289
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm Sopralta, also Nana Safi.

290
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm a guinea pig.

291
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,480
I have a nice butt, apparently.

292
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,200
That's it.

293
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,320
We didn't say nice.

294
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,080
I know.

295
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,320
I have a nice butt.

296
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Confounding.

297
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,040
I mean, it's a butt, all right.

298
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,080
Something.

299
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,400
OK, I don't have a tail.

300
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,760
I mean, your butt hangs kind of low.

301
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh, you got a long back or something like that.

302
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,320
Oh, are you talking about her guinea pig butt?

303
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,520
Yeah, her guinea pig butt.

304
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,400
She's just mad.

305
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,320
I said she rides a bicycle.

306
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,440
A tricycle.

307
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,680
Oh, a tricycle, yeah.

308
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,720
OK, we should start this game before she kills me.

309
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
OK, I'm starting it.

310
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,840
Has anybody played the game?

311
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,360
Oh, my piramid is back.

312
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,520
We have played before.

313
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
Vivi's going to kill us.

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,160
Wait, who's in the middle?

315
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,120
OK, so we got Emmy and Sopralta on the ends.

316
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,520
Very interesting.

317
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,160
Emmy.

318
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,600
Emmy, what?

319
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,080
No, you might.

320
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,200
I actually think I trust you more than Sopralta.

321
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
What?

322
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,560
I'll have you know.

323
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,160
Even though you've never played before.

324
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,680
What is the end like an important task?

325
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,440
Yes.

326
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,600
There's no God here.

327
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
Only name and people.

328
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,120
Oh, I can pull you guys in.

329
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
Oh, I'll pull you in.

330
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,320
I figure how to pull.

331
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
How do I pull?

332
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,920
It's easy like look at them.

333
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,120
Are we both an old man?

334
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,920
Yeah, they're both an old white man.

335
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,360
I specifically chose the old man.

336
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,880
And I'm pretty surprised for being an old guy.

337
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,800
Pretty fly for an old guy.

338
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
We are barefoot.

339
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
What the heck?

340
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,520
No, no, no, don't let them look.

341
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,280
Don't let them look.

342
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,200
Don't let them look.

343
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,240
OK, cover it with the chains at all times.

344
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,600
It's not too hard so far.

345
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,280
Oh, walking.

346
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,160
The boy said about not trusting me.

347
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,640
Don't do it.

348
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Don't do it.

349
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,800
Don't do it.

350
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Don't do it.

351
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,160
Just immediately, but begging.

352
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
You guys can't see.

353
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,960
See what?

354
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,680
See what?

355
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,160
See he's not in your mouth.

356
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,480
You can't see my how can you not see my game?

357
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,040
Pull me.

358
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Just pull me.

359
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm pulling the one.

360
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
OK.

361
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,280
Pull it in.

362
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Pull it in.

363
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh, it lagged.

364
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,760
It lagged.

365
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,640
It's still in the character selection screen for everyone.

366
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
How is that happening?

367
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,280
Were you showing window capture or were you showing game

368
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,760
capture?

369
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,320
Oh, OK.

370
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,680
OK, now it's working.

371
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,480
Now it's working.

372
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,800
OK, I don't know why it did that.

373
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,680
I'm going to lock in.

374
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,120
Time to lock in.

375
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,440
Apologies.

376
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,160
I put normal motion when I remember.

377
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,800
So do you want to have countdown?

378
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Do you want to have countdown?

379
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Countdowns.

380
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,720
No, we don't do countdowns.

381
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,480
OK, we just go for it.

382
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,600
We just read each other's minds and hope for the best.

383
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,640
You know what we kind of look like?

384
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,080
So Stan, Ford, Mabel, and Wendy.

385
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, you're not wrong.

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,080
What is that?

387
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,760
From Gravity Falls.

388
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,960
All right, go in order.

389
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,360
Or not, that's fine.

390
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,800
We've gotten this far.

391
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm just waiting for one of us to fall off.

392
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,200
Well, he's like, you want me to fall off?

393
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
No.

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Did you just say fall off?

395
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, if you do, we can just pull you back up, I guess.

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,520
Is that a bet?

397
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,360
Yep, bet.

398
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,960
Do it.

399
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,320
Do it.

400
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,120
Throw yourself off.

401
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Do it.

402
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Did you just say fall off?

403
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,600
Did you just do it?

404
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,760
Mabel, pull us up.

405
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Go, go, go!

406
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
OK, OK, OK.

407
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,240
You're too heavy.

408
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
Grab, grab, grab, grab.

409
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Oh, sorry.

410
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,440
Oh.

411
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,920
Hail.

412
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Hail.

413
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,320
Amy, swing on the other side.

414
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Jump off the other side.

415
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
All right, I can just stand here, can I?

416
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
We're going to fall off!

417
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
No, just fall, just fall.

418
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
It's literally, we're just going to fall to the bottom.

419
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
It's OK.

420
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
I'm standing.

421
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm actually fine.

422
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Oh, no, I'm swinging again.

423
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Oh, OK, wait.

424
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
We're literally almost at the end.

425
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Come on.

426
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Amy with the carry.

427
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
How did she manage that?

428
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
She's a gamer.

429
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
I think we should leave Sepral.

430
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
No, OK.

431
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
We should cut her off at the end.

432
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,120
So you can't leave me.

433
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I should have eaten you in the womb.

434
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Don't fall off in the hole.

435
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Oh, does that fall off?

436
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Oh, my God.

437
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
Do you have selective hearing?

438
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
I mean, I am an old guy.

439
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
You got to adjust your hearing aid, brother.

440
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
All right, so don't touch that.

441
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Oh, my God.

442
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Oh, my God.

443
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Guys, guys, guys.

446
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Amy, Amy, pull us up.

447
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Amy.

448
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
I can't.

449
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm going to fall if I turn around.

450
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
No, OK.

451
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Just pull this back up, back up.

452
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
You see that thingy?

453
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
What the?

454
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
The little stick.

455
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Why don't you jump on the other side of the stick

456
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
and then we can like...

457
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Or you can back up on the rock.

458
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
I can't jump.

459
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
And then press E?

460
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Someone's going to write.

461
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Better idea, better idea.

462
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
OK, there we go.

463
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Can you guys...

464
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Can you come up from here or no?

465
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Can you pull me?

466
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
What for you?

467
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Can you come up here for me?

468
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Can I come up?

469
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I'll come in for you.

470
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
OK.

471
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Help me, please.

472
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Thank you.

473
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
OK, too bad.

474
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I can't wait.

475
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
We've only gotten this far.

476
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
We're not even at like the crazy part yet.

477
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Wait, what do you mean?

478
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
No, this is not...

479
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,720
You're telling me we haven't even gotten past the tutorial?

480
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
No, this is literally still a tutorial.

481
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
This is a tutorial?

482
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Essentially.

483
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
This kind of gives you a taste of everything.

484
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
OK, OK, ready?

485
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
So don't touch these.

486
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
We have to jump over them.

487
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Can the chain touch it?

488
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Yes, that's fine.

489
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
OK.

490
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,720
You can also run.

491
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Don't get hit by that.

492
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,720
And then you can Mario climb the fence.

493
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Mario climb the fence.

494
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
You'll see what I mean.

495
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
We've literally played this game before.

496
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,720
What do you mean, Mario climb the fence?

497
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Someone said we're just two pairs of the same person.

498
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
They're kind of right.

499
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
You're not wrong, actually.

500
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
I was thinking that earlier.

501
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
I didn't want to say it.

502
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
How do I get off?

503
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Just press B.

504
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
All right.

505
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
OK, so there's a trampoline.

506
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
So we're just going to...

507
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
One, two, three.

508
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Yippee, dude.

509
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Oh, what just happened?

510
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
All right.

511
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
No, get off.

512
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Get off of it.

513
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Get off of it.

514
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
All right.

515
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Aim towards the other one.

516
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
There you go.

517
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Yippee.

518
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Yippee.

519
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Ah!

520
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
OK.

521
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
OK.

522
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Nice.

523
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Nice.

524
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Keep going.

525
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Nice.

526
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Don't worry.

527
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,720
It means we got you.

528
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
I'm stressing.

529
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
OK.

530
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Now let's go through the tunnel.

531
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
We're going the hole.

532
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
The hole of love.

533
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
The love.

534
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
The tunnel.

535
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
The tunnel.

536
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
I love you, baby girl.

537
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
I love you too.

538
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Pookie.

539
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Pookie bear.

540
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Pookie bear.

541
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Sunshine.

542
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
No, that's only for me, babe.

543
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
That's only for me.

544
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
That's only for me.

545
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
OK.

546
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,720
I know for a fact we're going to fall off this time.

547
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
No, no, no.

548
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I got this.

549
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
I got this.

550
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
OK, you go first.

551
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
You go first.

552
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,720
I don't trust her.

553
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Don't jump like that.

554
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
You're making me nervous.

555
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
OK.

556
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
OK.

557
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
OK.

558
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
OK.

559
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
I can't jump up.

560
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
I didn't feel like auto or whatever.

561
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
It doesn't for this one.

562
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Sometimes.

563
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Which way do I go?

564
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Like this way?

565
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Follow your heart.

566
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
I trust you.

567
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Are you saying that's because I'm Asian?

568
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
What?

569
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
What?

570
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
I didn't even know you were Asian.

571
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I thought you were guinea pig.

572
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Exactly.

573
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I can be both.

574
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I can be Asian.

575
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
I can be Asian.

576
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Are there Asian breeds of guinea pigs?

577
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
No.

578
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
But you know, coffee bars are loved by all of Asia.

579
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
So if you think about it, it's kind of like close enough.

580
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
That's true.

581
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
They are pretty.

582
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
They are the biggest guinea pig.

583
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Coffee bars?

584
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Are they the largest rodents?

585
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Really?

586
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Probably not.

587
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
They have like...

588
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Horse hair.

589
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Yeah.

590
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I want to pet one.

591
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Yeah, it's kind of like a broom.

592
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
It's like a school.

593
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Have you ever touched a coffee bar?

594
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
No, but I'm going on in October to Japan.

595
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I'm going to go touch one.

596
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Nice.

597
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm going to see them in the onsen.

598
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
I'm going to touch it.

599
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
I'm going to pet it.

600
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Are we still talking about coffee bars?

601
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
No, I don't think we're allowed to.

602
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
If I could...

603
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
You can't...

604
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
You can't bathe with them?

605
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
What's the point?

606
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Hold on.

607
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Hold on.

608
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Okay.

609
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Did you know that they poop in the water?

610
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Oh, okay.

611
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Yeah, so do I.

612
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
And?

613
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,720
And the water that you bathed in me?

614
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
The bathtub ASMR is about to go crazy.

615
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Where are you?

616
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,720
She took us the long way.

617
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Well, I didn't know there was another direction on my bed.

618
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
No, you're fine.

619
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
I'm just teasing you.

620
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Wait, there's a short way?

621
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Yeah.

622
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Someone say short?

623
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Like you.

624
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
I'm not short.

625
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I'm taller than you.

626
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
No, you're not.

627
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Well, how tall are you?

628
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
5'2".

629
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
5'2".

630
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
No way.

631
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
I'm 5'3".

632
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
No way.

633
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
This is my dick.

634
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Wow.

635
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
My balls.

636
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Do you think that one inch saves you?

637
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Me here, my 5'8".

638
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Yeah, the one that was in the cedar.

639
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Throwing everybody around.

640
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Oh, my God.

641
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Look at that.

642
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Look at that monster.

643
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
He's kind of cute.

644
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Where do we go?

645
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
The monster?

646
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Yeah, the monster over here.

647
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Over here.

648
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Over here's a long-ass tongue.

649
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
What that tongue do?

650
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
He's got a tongue?

651
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
I think he has a tongue.

652
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
That's a tongue.

653
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
He does have a tongue.

654
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Yeah.

655
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I think you can zoom in.

656
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
There's a way to do it.

657
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I can't remember how, though.

658
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Is it tilde?

659
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Tilda to zoom in?

660
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Tilda?

661
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,720
No, I think that's to bring up the console, isn't it?

662
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
How do you zoom in?

663
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,720
What Emmy needs to figure out is how to spawn us when we fall off, because we can restart

664
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
at little checkpoint places.

665
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Oh, we can't?

666
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
No, we're a raw dog in it.

667
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
You want to start raw dog this?

668
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I think we're going to fail.

669
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
We have to do it all in one go.

670
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Which way do we go from here?

671
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Remember that time?

672
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I was just trying to figure it out.

673
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
I think we're going to fail.

674
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
We have to do it all in one go.

675
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Which way do we go from here?

676
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Remember that time?

677
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
We jump on the rock.

678
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,720
And you kept saying stuff about where we find the spawn.

679
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Oh, OK, Emmy.

680
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
It looks like we're going, Emmy.

681
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
It looks like we're going, Emmy.

682
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
He said, jump on the rock.

683
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
He said, where are we going?

684
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
And I said, the rock.

685
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
And then you're like, OK.

686
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
And then you just go.

687
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
None of us made a move to go.

688
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Pull me up.

689
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Pull me up.

690
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Pull me up.

691
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Pull me up.

692
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Pull me up.

693
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,840
Please pull me up.

694
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,720
Pull me up.

695
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Pull me up.

696
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,720
You guys are saying we do this all in one go?

697
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,720
You guys are saying?

698
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Let's all agree this is Emmy's fault, and none of us

699
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
are ready to go yet.

700
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
No, we're joking.

701
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
We're jumping on the rock.

702
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
We jump on the rock.

703
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
I did say, jump.

704
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
You asked me, where are we going?

705
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
And I said, we're going to that rock.

706
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,820
that rock, and then me every-

707
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,660
Okay, so I went to the-

708
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,740
You knew this way, you knew this way.

709
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,860
Wait, how do I respond?

710
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,080
Tell me the way.

711
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,580
I honestly don't know,

712
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,460
because I think Apollo did it.

713
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,780
Or, when I played with her.

714
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,180
Okay, wait, hold on, let me look it up then.

715
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,740
I think it's like, I think the way it's done is,

716
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,580
something like-

717
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,420
You just press a button.

718
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,140
It's in the menu, right?

719
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,780
Oh, it's a button?

720
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,180
Well, I think it, I don't know.

721
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,140
I'm just guessing.

722
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,700
There is a button that you press.

723
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,540
Are you making out with me,

724
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
when I'm your sibling?

725
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,700
Self-sist.

726
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,020
Looks at me.

727
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,240
My friend Hachi would be totally into that.

728
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,080
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

729
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,920
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

730
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,860
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

731
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,460
Two identical twin old man.

732
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,940
We have a friend Hachi,

733
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,240
and Hachi loves Genji Ex Hanso.

734
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,020
Honestly, I don't blame her.

735
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,860
What?

736
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,260
I think I'm traumatized again.

737
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,340
From the overwatch.

738
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,740
Did we reach 576 meters?

739
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,860
No.

740
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,060
I don't think we got to-

741
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
Oh, sorry, I'm playing on normal mode.

742
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,140
There's no checkpoints on normal mode.

743
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,980
I told you.

744
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,340
All right, no, I'm dogging it.

745
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,740
I don't think this counts as a fall,

746
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,460
because that was our tutorial, you know?

747
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,300
We had to warm up first.

748
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,140
Yeah, that was warm up.

749
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,540
Oh, guys, we are going to-

750
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,580
Ah!

751
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,860
Okay.

752
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,260
Hachi will never live that down.

753
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,420
Nope.

754
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,580
She traumatized me, and now she's stuck with it.

755
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,500
On the pause menu, then teleport

756
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,660
at the center of the screen.

757
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,580
But we are in normal mode, it doesn't have-

758
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,580
Sorry, I thought I didn't want to be a scrub

759
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,020
and choose easy mode, you know?

760
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,700
No, we're gamers.

761
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,900
We're gamers, we got this.

762
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,740
Yeah.

763
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
We're stinky gamers.

764
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,900
Of course.

765
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,700
I sour, I'm gonna go about you.

766
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,100
Well, you sour every four days.

767
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,180
That still means I sour.

768
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,020
Is that a problem?

769
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,860
How often do you guys sour?

770
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,980
Not for me, it is.

771
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,860
Oh, we could take the shortcut to the right.

772
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,100
That's a shortcut?

773
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,940
Yeah.

774
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,780
Go for it.

775
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,620
Is it?

776
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,940
Yeah.

777
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,940
Either way, Viv.

778
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,340
I didn't know this was a shortcut.

779
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,180
Me neither.

780
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Why didn't we do this the first time?

781
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,940
I was just following you all the way.

782
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,300
Look, we did it!

783
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,540
We did it!

784
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
Nothing to it.

785
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,380
I wonder how far,

786
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,780
I hope we get to at least the car.

787
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,100
There's a car?

788
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,580
You've never gotten to the car?

789
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,060
No, we see, she like rage quit.

790
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,220
Last time we played it.

791
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,700
Who rage quit?

792
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,540
You!

793
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,660
Not even two hours in, she all taps fours.

794
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,380
I may have done that.

795
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,220
You can just move your mouse and like,

796
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,980
slowly turn it as you walk.

797
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
No, I'm too nervous.

798
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,140
No, we're still running there.

799
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,940
Someone's slowing us down here.

800
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,300
Yeah, it's freaking me.

801
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,660
If he ends too scared to move forward.

802
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,780
I don't want to follow.

803
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,780
If you're me, Kimber,

804
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,780
I'll catch you, Jinx.

805
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,140
I'll catch you.

806
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,620
Wait, so who's seen Gravity Falls here?

807
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,460
Me.

808
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,820
I've seen a little bit of it.

809
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,660
I found out the other day that apparently Mabel

810
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,980
was supposed to die on the show,

811
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,340
and Disney said no.

812
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,660
I would say no too.

813
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,860
Mabel's really cute.

814
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,700
I love her too.

815
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,540
I love Mabel.

816
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,100
They wanted like a sacrifice kind of thing going on.

817
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,940
No.

818
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,780
And like what's Scar a place of like a,

819
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,780
I can't talk, a generation of kids.

820
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,460
Sorry, I had a brain aneurysm.

821
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,940
Listen, you know, the death of a character.

822
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,460
Like, it's character development.

823
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,500
Look at us insane.

824
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,580
And it was the end of the show.

825
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,180
What more development do you need at the end of the show?

826
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,020
No, no, no.

827
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,620
It was just overall, she was supposed to die.

828
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,460
I don't know where.

829
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,620
Oh, like in general, at some point in the show.

830
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,500
The first pilot episode, they just killed her.

831
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,340
We don't like her.

832
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,180
Get her out of there.

833
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,660
The pilot though, the pilot was such an adult version.

834
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,500
Was it?

835
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,180
You know, you guys can get off here, right?

836
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,020
No, no, no, no.

837
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,860
We're going the whole way.

838
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,700
Just kidding.

839
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,540
How do we get off?

840
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,380
Okay.

841
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,460
We need to run her here.

842
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,780
Already?

843
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,620
Yeah.

844
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,460
Go.

845
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,300
Oh, what?

846
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

847
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

848
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

849
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,640
How do we not make it?

850
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,480
God, guys.

851
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,500
I don't know if that was my fault or not.

852
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,140
I'm kind of confused.

853
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,380
It was not me, it was the last one.

854
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,220
It was the last one.

855
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,160
I was the last one.

856
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,980
Yeah, it was the last one.

857
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,620
Yeah, exactly.

858
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,300
Oh, was she too late?

859
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,520
Are you saying I'm fat?

860
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,980
Are you sure?

861
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,520
You don't want to do the teleport.

862
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,620
Thank God.

863
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,540
Okay, we'd have to leave the...

864
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,380
Yeah, we'd have to leave the game so I can change it to easy mode. I think

865
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,220
No, it's the same map you just be able to teleport to where you fell from

866
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,620
Chat would want us to be in pain

867
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,800
Don't give them chance to respond because we already know what they're gonna say

868
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,900
You guys should totally go in easy mode because yeah, that's what I'm gonna say. I believe I believe you and wait

869
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
I'm gonna do double-dutch

870
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,100
What's a double-dutch?

871
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,620
You don't know what the whole touches is that an American thing?

872
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:44,140
No, it's like a like when you're jump roping. Yeah, it's too. It's two ropes

873
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
three people so two people are like

874
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,460
Yeah, you never you never did you ever skip rope in me?

875
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,700
Well, I only did it because I was at a mandated after-school program because I was dumb

876
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,020
Yeah, my chat also said hard motor bust

877
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,900
Can we bust what does bust mean I can bust a move I can't crouch so I can't twerk

878
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I

879
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Can't read your mind y'all

880
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,340
I'm trying my hardest my telepathy is out of

881
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,420
Swap the flats with the the mommies

882
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,540
Oh

883
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
It means in me

884
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,980
Is the fight that goes with Shabby's mommy?

885
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
And I don't want to live anymore

886
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,180
Shabby is a rabbit and I am a guinea pig so like to we're chilling we're vibing

887
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
I could feed her

888
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,820
I'll share my snacks. Yeah, we eat the same food

889
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,660
Yeah, basically, I don't like carrots. What do you like?

890
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,020
Letters won't feed you some lettuce. Do you like arugula?

891
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,980
Arugula, I mean I'll eat it. You like zucchini. My mom just grew some zucchini in our garden. Oh my god

892
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,140
I love zucchini. I'll give you some zucchini. Just don't do anything else

893
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,860
Actually, you know my guinea pigs the ones I own ready

894
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,860
We fed them like exotic Asian fruits

895
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Impressed like what?

896
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,020
Do you guys know like like leechy. Oh, I love leechy. Yeah, we gave them leechy. We gave them

897
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,980
Rambootin. Oh, magazine. Oh

898
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,540
Damn well fed

899
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,220
Yeah, of course guinea pigs are always

900
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
Rotons

901
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Okay, so

902
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,020
We gotta

903
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,860
Climb up here, and I can't climb for some reason. Oh

904
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:03,820
It's this again. Yep, and then we gotta be able to jump on the rocks later if you look up you can see where we are

905
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,820
Look down

906
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Oh

907
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,060
You hear the screams of the dams very nice on beyond how right now

908
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,620
Yeah, I was gonna say it's just reminds me of Florida

909
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,620
No, I've been multiple times

910
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,540
And they had a lot of

911
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
They do

912
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,820
Guanas

913
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,500
You got the same me no, I just don't like alligators. They are scary

914
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,340

I

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Space bar

00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,140
Okay, all right, don't step on it yet

1094
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,780

Okay, this one's hard to mess up this one's hard to mess up. Don't say that

1096
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,460

00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,900
I can't

1107
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,860
There we go

1108
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,900

Your toes are cold. She just

00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,940
I did that I changed characters and I was wondering if I could go back to being an old guy

1112
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,620
Oh, wait, it was you changed characters because you clicked on wait. What?

1113
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,340
Where are you going?

1114
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,260
Look all around. The last time I stood in there is when I noticed I changed characters

1115
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,420
So I thought maybe if I did it again, I could be the old guy. Maybe I don't know why I changed you

1116
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,740
Maybe you gotta get to another checkpoint. Oh my god. Why can't we all be an old guy?

1117
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:42,620
I well, I don't want to be old and ugly. I don't want to be old. You're saying I'm old and ugly

1118
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:47,260

Okay, ready? Are you serious? Are you serious?

01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,100
Are you serious?

01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,700
Wait, actually

1147
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,580
No, no.

1148
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,740
I said oops. I said oops

1149
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,740
All right. Let's let's jump on to this rock ladies

1150
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,700
Okay.

1151
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,700
Lead the way, any one of you.

1152
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,700
Okay.

1153
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,700
It doesn't matter which direction you go in.

1154
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,700
Oh, there are dead ends.

1155
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,700
He's not letting me.

1156
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,700
But you'll see the dead ends, because it'll just won't let you move forward.

1157
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,700
We gotta wait to stop you.

1158
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,700
Okay.

1159
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,700
You fucking hell!

1160
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,700
What just happened?

1161
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,700
Okay.

1162
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,700
Okay.

1163
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,700
So you guys want to play?

1164
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,700
Oh, no, this is the nearest safe location.

1165
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,700
I tried to teleport to the nearest safe location.

1166
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,700
So should we go in the easy mode?

1167
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,700
Wait, there's no safe point?

1168
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,700
No, I don't see one in any of those settings.

1169
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,700
Chad, can we go to easy mode now, please?

1170
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,700
Chad, can we have permission for easy modes?

1171
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,700
I don't think we should.

1172
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,700
Wait, does it have to be the person who's running the thing to do it?

1173
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,700
I think we have to restart it.

1174
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,700
Okay.

1175
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,700
Chad, can we do it?

1176
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,700
No.

1177
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,700
Please.

1178
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,700
Please.

1179
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,700
That was so funny.

1180
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,700
Okay, quiet.

1181
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,700
My flavor is struggling right now.

1182
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,700
Everybody is in like two frames per second.

1183
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,700
Mm-hmm.

1184
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,700
We're in PowerPoint mode, literally.

1185
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,700
They're so funny.

1186
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,700
Oh, my God.

1187
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,700
Okay, it's gonna be the same.

1188
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,700
Oh, wait, if I type in the password, oh, no, they can't see.

1189
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,700
Okay, that's good.

1190
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,700
Just get rid of it real quick.

1191
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,700
Get rid of what?

1192
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,700
Just tell me.

1193
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,700
Just do it.

1194
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,700
Okay, same password, same password,

1195
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,700
and it's gonna be beginner mode.

1196
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,700
Yeah, okay.

1197
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,700
Should I do close chain?

1198
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,700
No.

1199
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,700
I don't know what that means.

1200
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,700
We're all connected to each other rather than being like a line.

1201
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,700
Yeah, we're all connected to each other.

1202
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,700
No, don't do that.

1203
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,700
Wait, wouldn't it be easier?

1204
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,700
No.

1205
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,700
Wait, did you open the thing?

1206
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,700
Oh, we're just inpatient, sorry.

1207
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,700
There you go, you can join.

1208
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,700
Should we all be old men?

1209
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,700
Yes.

1210
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,700
There's Steve from Minecraft.

1211
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,700
I'd rather be a hag, honestly.

1212
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,700
Is there even a hag?

1213
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,700
I think there is a hag.

1214
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,700
Wait, wrong password?

1215
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,700
Oh, shit.

1216
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,700
What did you do?

1217
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,700
I swear I put the same password.

1218
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,700
Let me just check what I wrote in there.

1219
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,700
Did you spell it wrong?

1220
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,700
I wouldn't do that.

1221
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,700
I'm gonna join last so I can be at the end.

1222
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,700
Close to game.

1223
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,700
Yeah, you need your goats at the end, huh?

1224
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,700
You know what?

1225
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,700
The two mommies need to be the front and the caboose.

1226
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,700
That's better.

1227
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,700
Well, that would mean that me or...

1228
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,700
Sandwiches.

1229
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,700
I require mommy milk.

1230
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,700
Please, I'm a baby.

1231
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,700
No.

1232
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,700
Okay, I made it again.

1233
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,700
I don't think I've ever lost.

1234
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,700
I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

1235
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,700
Don't start the game without me.

1236
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,700
Don't start the game without you?

1237
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,700
Don't start the game without me.

1238
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,700
Drag her along.

1239
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,700
Just drag her along.

1240
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,700
Yeah.

1241
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,700
I can't get in.

1242
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,700
You got to refresh it.

1243
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,700
It says refresh password again?

1244
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,700
Hold on, let me refresh.

1245
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,700
You guys not spell the password?

1246
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,700
No.

1247
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,700
Okay, I'm in.

1248
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,700
I think you just had to refresh it.

1249
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,700
Yeah, I had to refresh the entire thingy.

1250
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,700
No, I want to be an old guy.

1251
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,700
He looks like his name is like...

1252
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,700
If I'm a buff guy, will I be able to carry people better?

1253
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,700
Like pull people up?

1254
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,700
No, I don't think so.

1255
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,700
I need to go to the bathroom too.

1256
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,700
Let's see.

1257
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,700
You know when you load it in, I thought it said skibbity.

1258
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,700
Wow, I can't believe you've said that.

1259
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
I'm so sorry. The brain rot.

1260
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,700
No, it's okay. I'll say it.

1261
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,700
What the shibbity a lot, so it's fine.

1262
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,700
What the shibbity?

1263
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,700
What the shibbity?

1264
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,700
We can't even start the game without her.

1265
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,700
She thinks we can.

1266
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,700
I would have dragged both of them, honestly.

1267
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,700
Same. And blamed them if we could.

1268
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
Look at their little bodies.

1269
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,700
They look so cute.

1270
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,700
I just realized,

1271
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,700
Sepralta's ears flick. That's really adorable.

1272
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,700
That is really cute.

1273
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,700
And then Amy has a snot bubble when she sleeps,

1274
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,700
but I do too.

1275
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,700
You do?

1276
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,700
Yeah, Rigger did that.

1277
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,700
I don't know if it'll work, because I might have taken it off.

1278
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,700
Yeah, I did.

1279
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,700
Sometimes if I just go off to the side too far,

1280
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,700
I just fall asleep.

1281
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,700
It's like how Emmys is right now.

1282
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,700
Man, she's a long piss.

1283
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,700
You know, some people wash their hands.

1284
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,700
I did wash my hands.

1285
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,700
You want to smell them?

1286
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,700
I bet you just crack your hands with the water.

1287
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,700
You don't even put soap on it.

1288
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,700
No, I use Bath and Body Works soap.

1289
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,700
She dips her hands in the toilet after.

1290
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,700
You know when I was crazy?

1291
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,700
Me?

1292
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,700
No.

1293
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,700
You know,

1294
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,700
sometimes

1295
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,700
if you have

1296
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,700
the toilet

1297
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,700
and if it's too

1298
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,700
forceful or too powerful,

1299
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,700
the water will splash up.

1300
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
Are you talking about when we sit on the toilet

1301
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,700
and we piss hard, the water will splash back on us?

1302
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,700
No, when you're flushing it.

1303
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,700
Sometimes it gets on the seat.

1304
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,700
Yeah.

1305
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,700
So it happens in public restrooms sometimes.

1306
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,700
If I see that,

1307
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,700
I immediately just go to a different bathroom.

1308
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,700
Same.

1309
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,700
I can't deal with that.

1310
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,700
Just piss.

1311
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,700
Don't sit down. Just squat.

1312
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,700
I don't like squatting.

1313
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,700
I'll just bare ass it.

1314
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,700
I can't squat.

1315
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,700
I mean, I can, but I don't like it.

1316
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,700
So you'll bare ass stick your ass on a nasty toilet seat if you had to?

1317
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,700
No, I just hold it.

1318
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,700
I'll do it.

1319
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,700
The only time I squat is in a porta potty

1320
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,700
because hell no.

1321
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,700
I don't have it in me to use a porta potty.

1322
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,700
I think I'd rather pee.

1323
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,700
When I went to a run fair, I had to use a porta potty

1324
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,700
because I was literally going to piss myself.

1325
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,700
You could have bottled it.

1326
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,700
I don't, I did not have a bottle nearby.

1327
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,700
I've had to pee in a cup for a doctor's appointment

1328
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,700
before and I hated it.

1329
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,700
Peeing in a cup is fun.

1330
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,700
It makes a little fun noise.

1331
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,700
No, because you have to be nervous

1332
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,700
because then I can pee and then they're like,

1333
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,700
are you done yet? And I'm like, no.

1334
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,700
I just go into Zen mode

1335
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,700
and I breathe deeply

1336
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,700
and then I just like piss.

1337
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,700
Yeah, I just go as you

1338
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,700
and then as I blow out, I piss.

1339
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,700
Okay, but you have to like piss or like a gentle pisser.

1340
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,700
I'm a gentle pisser.

1341
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,700
Wait, how do you, what's the difference?

1342
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,700
I just let it dribble.

1343
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,700
You know, I don't have to force it.

1344
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,700
What?

1345
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,700
I have a great pelvic floor strength though.

1346
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,700
Don't get it twisted.

1347
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,700
No, no, I believe you. I believe it's great.

1348
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,700
You think it feels nice to force it out?

1349
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,700
Yeah, it does a hundred percent.

1350
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,700
I love like if you just like really piss really hard.

1351
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,700
You're like, ugh.

1352
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,700
Just, what is he?

1353
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,700
How hard I can piss?

1354
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,700
Try to check it in there.

1355
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,700
Pissing all by yourself, handsome.

1356
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,700
Oh my god.

1357
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,700
Yes, you want to hold my hand like this.

1358
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,700
Yeah, I think Viv has met her match.

1359
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,700
Oh wow.

1360
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,700
Me and Viv, I see a lot of myself in Viv.

1361
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,700
You know, because we're old.

1362
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,700
No!

1363
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,700
You're a hag.

1364
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,700
Viv is a hag.

1365
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,700
Hags are in demand.

1366
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,700
Maybe not, maybe other hags.

1367
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,700
I don't know about you.

1368
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,700
Look at us all running in sync.

1369
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,700
I'm pretty proud of us.

1370
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,700
You stop.

1371
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,700
I dropped something, but I don't know where it is.

1372
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,700
Is it this big rock?

1373
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,700
Is it your boobs?

1374
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,700
You drop your pocket.

1375
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,700
You will see me in Japan.

1376
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,700
My boobs, I'm pretty sure, are bigger than yours.

1377
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,700
I could teach you, but I have to charge.

1378
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,700
My boobs are great.

1379
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,700
What the fuck?

1380
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,700
You felt each other's boobs?

1381
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,700
How do you know they're softer?

1382
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,700
We're gonna, in October, we're gonna...

1383
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,700
Do you still have in Japan?

1384
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,700
No.

1385
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,700
Yeah? No?

1386
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,700
I don't want to see her.

1387
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,700
You don't want to see her?

1388
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,700
She's mean to me.

1389
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,700
You're kind of mean back though.

1390
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,700
You're very sun.

1391
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,700
She's just bark.

1392
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,700
She's mean.

1393
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,700
You're my soulmate.

1394
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,700
No, we're twin flames.

1395
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,700
Because we're...

1396
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,700
Nice callback.

1397
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,700
Love that.

1398
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,700
The underworld.

1399
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,700
Already off you a great start, ladies.

1400
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,700
We were taking the shortcut.

1401
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,700
We are!

1402
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,700
We're just not ready for it.

1403
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,700
Okay.

1404
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,700
At least now when we fall off, we'll start back up here.

1405
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,700
You think we lost the brain though?

1406
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,700
Probably.

1407
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,700
What were you guys talking about?

1408
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:58,700
We were talking about how long we were pissing,

1409
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,700
and then we were just talking about pissing in general,

1410
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,700
and then like pissing in the club.

1411
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,700
And we were talking about porta-potties,

1412
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,700
and how we hate porta-potties.

1413
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,700
Do you squat or do you bear ass a toilet,

1414
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,700
or do you put a little liner down at me?

1415
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,700
It really depends.

1416
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,700
I never really squat though.

1417
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,700
If it's too dirty, I just don't go.

1418
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,700
Exactly.

1419
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,700
But what if you have to?

1420
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,700
Then I'll piss on the fucking floor and add to the mess.

1421
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,700
I'm kidding.

1422
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,700
I'm just kidding.

1423
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,700
Do you guys see that tick-tock of the girl

1424
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,700
that shot herself in Walmart?

1425
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,700
What?

1426
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,700
What?

1427
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,700
She recorded a tick-tock of her crying,

1428
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,700
and she's like,

1429
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,700
guys, I just shot myself in Walmart.

1430
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,700
Of course it happens at a Walmart.

1431
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,700
And then apparently...

1432
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,700
There's somebody who was like,

1433
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,700
I saw someone shit.

1434
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,700
Yeah!

1435
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,700
Someone else made another tick-tock.

1436
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,700
Guys, I just...

1437
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,700
I love it when there's like

1438
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,700
tick-tocks of multiple

1439
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,700
angles and stories

1440
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,700
of the same thing.

1441
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,700
Yeah!

1442
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,700
Oh my god.

1443
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,700
I think the power

1444
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,700
of us talking about piss and shit

1445
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,700
is making us play really good.

1446
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,700
I know, we're not even thinking.

1447
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,700
We're just going.

1448
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,700
We're just so focused.

1449
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,700
Yeah.

1450
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,700
More piss and shit talk.

1451
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,700
Oh, never mind.

1452
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,700
I think it's or because we're all old moms.

1453
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,700
Maybe.

1454
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,700
Maybe it's the power of VIV.

1455
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,700
I don't know, I just fell off.

1456
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,700
He really fell off, sis.

1457
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,700
He couldn't handle it.

1458
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,700
What did weight girls actually shit?

1459
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,700
Oh, uh...

1460
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,700
Something.

1461
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,700
We do something like the male equivalent,

1462
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,700
but it's not quite shitting.

1463
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,700
You know like how owls like puke out the bones?

1464
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,700
Yeah, we grind stuff

1465
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,700
like gizzard and then we throw it up.

1466
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,700
Yeah, that's basically what girls do.

1467
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,700
Oh, no.

1468
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,700
We're good, guys.

1469
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,700
We're good. We got this.

1470
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,700
And even if we fall off, we have the checkpoint

1471
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,700
stuff, so it's not a big deal.

1472
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,700
We got it. Keep going to the

1473
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,700
side.

1474
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,700
Go, no stop.

1475
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,700
Go for it, everyone.

1476
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,700
Oh, I keep forgetting you can sprint.

1477
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,700
Sprint!

1478
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,700
Come on, use your old man legs.

1479
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,700
Pull me.

1480
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,700
Pull me to victory.

1481
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,700
He held back my shoe.

1482
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
I'm seeing some problems with this bangle.

1483
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,700
I'm trying to go forward.

1484
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,700
I'm trying to go forward.

1485
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,700
And she's just like not moving.

1486
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,700
Go, our leader.

1487
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,700
Our fearless leader.

1488
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,700
Me? Yes, you're the fearless leader.

1489
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,700
Cute girls go first.

1490
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,700
Cute girls first.

1491
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,700
Me and Viv go last because we're hacks.

1492
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,700
We're old.

1493
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,700
I'm 56 years old.

1494
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,700
My birthday is coming up. I'm turning 57.

1495
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,700
Not forever 56.

1496
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,700
You wear diapers?

1497
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,700
Yeah, I dabble.

1498
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,700
Do I sell those diapers?

1499
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,700
Do I sell them?

1500
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,700
You only have $2.

1501
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,700
You can't afford them.

1502
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,700
I can pay in other ways.

1503
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,700
Your body?

1504
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,700
Wait, where are we going?

1505
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,700
Wait a second.

1506
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,700
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1507
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,700
We're diaper talking.

1508
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,700
Yeah, I was wondering too.

1509
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
Yeah, I can sell you a liver.

1510
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,700
Can you sell them on eBay?

1511
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,700
I can do that.

1512
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,700
I like to make works of art

1513
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,700
with the remnants of what's inside.

1514
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,700
I feel like Etsy.

1515
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,700
Yeah, Etsy.

1516
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,700
You know those scary terms of service?

1517
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,700
Abadazzle.

1518
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,700
That's why we keep it on the DL.

1519
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,700
It's a secret operation.

1520
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,700
Secret biohazard.

1521
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,700
That's what the store is called. How did you know?

1522
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,700
Secret biohazard.

1523
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,700
We are the old men.

1524
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,700
We're quadruplets.

1525
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,700
We are the retirement home.

1526
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,700
Stop it, you're a son of a bitch.

1527
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,700
Sorry mom.

1528
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,700
We were ready, we were ready.

1529
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,700
We did the time.

1530
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,700
Victoria's fire hazard.

1531
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,700
I can't get up.

1532
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,700
Help me.

1533
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1534
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,700
Go.

1535
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,700
Okay.

1536
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,700
That was pretty good.

1537
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,700
This one, this one, this one.

1538
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,700
I think we got to just say this one.

1539
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,700
This one, this one, this one.

1540
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,700
Send it.

1541
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,700
Remember you can sprint.

1542
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,700
Yes.

1543
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,700
I'm still proud of us.

1544
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,700
Wait, why did I just fall off?

1545
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,700
Can I sprint up the ladder?

1546
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,700
Wait, is there a timer?

1547
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,700
No, that's just how much time has taken us so far.

1548
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,700
Only six minutes.

1549
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,700
Yeah, that's not bad.

1550
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,700
Because people probably speedrun this.

1551
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,700
Yeah, probably.

1552
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,700
Oh yeah, we're speedrunning this.

1553
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,700
Wait, let me try it.

1554
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,700
This game is actually really long.

1555
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,700
Can you guys pause real quick?

1556
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,700
Yeah.

1557
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,700
Let me turn.

1558
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,700
Why are you?

1559
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,700
Look how it is posted.

1560
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,700
Are you like that?

1561
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,700
The spread eagle.

1562
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,700
The what?

1563
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,700
Oh, the spread eagle.

1564
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,700
Do you guys ever watch Chicago?

1565
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,700
No.

1566
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,700
Chicago.

1567
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,700
Wait, is it the...

1568
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,700
Wait, no.

1569
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,700
It's the one where it's like cellblock tango.

1570
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,700
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1571
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,700
And then her like sister and her husband

1572
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,700
were doing the spread eagle.

1573
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,700
Ready?

1574
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,700
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1575
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,700
Go, go, go, go, go.

1576
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,700
I didn't know.

1577
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,700
Describe it more in detail though.

1578
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,700
I just always thought spread eagles

1579
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,700
and your legs are just like in the air like spread.

1580
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,700
I don't know.

1581
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,700
Is that not what it is?

1582
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,700
No, no, no, it is what it is.

1583
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,700
But that was like also help.

1584
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,700
I'm stuck behind the ladder.

1585
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,700
I keep getting stuck on stuff.

1586
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,700
Thank you.

1587
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,700
This is why I'm not the leader. I'm too dependent.

1588
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,700
I will jump off right now.

1589
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,700
Do not touch me.

1590
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,700
Do it, do it, jump.

1591
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,700
Jump.

1592
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,700
Wow.

1593
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,700
I'm so anti-limactic.

1594
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,700
Do it.

1595
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,700
It's like you're chocolate.

1596
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,700
Okay.

1597
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,700
Amazing timing.

1598
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,700
Okay, now.

1599
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,700
Okay.

1600
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,700
I'm going all this way.

1601
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,700
I'm going all this way.

1602
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,700
We're not that dumb.

1603
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,700
We still got six brains.

1604
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,700
I mean eight.

1605
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,700
Did we get each?

1606
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,700
No.

1607
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,700
We lost you because we missed the number the first time

1608
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,700
and then we had talked about this.

1609
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,700
Oh, my game is lagging.

1610
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,700
Oh, pause.

1611
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,700
Let me fix your game.

1612
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,700
Pause.

1613
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,700
Die.

1614
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,700
Go.

1615
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,700
I'm feeling chaotic.

1616
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,700
Go, go, go, go.

1617
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,700
This actually works out.

1618
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,700
See?

1619
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,700
That was fine. I just dangled off the side.

1620
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,700
It works out.

1621
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,700
Because if you do the balancing

1622
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,700
and two people are on one side

1623
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,700
and two people are on the other,

1624
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,700
you can get under some of the obstacles.

1625
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,700
Oh, I didn't mean to fall off.

1626
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,700
Sorry.

1627
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,700
All right.

1628
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,700
Ready?

1629
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,700
Go, I guess.

1630
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,700
Oh, my God.

1631
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,700
Where am I going?

1632
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,700
I can't tell which one's me anymore.

1633
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,700
Okay, let's go Hag Squad.

1634
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,700
It's this way.

1635
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,700
That's right. We go up here.

1636
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,700
How do we Hag Squad?

1637
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,700
What's the mail version of Hag?

1638
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,700
Just hold me in.

1639
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,700
OG Sun.

1640
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,700
OG Sun Squad.

1641
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,700
Let's go.

1642
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,700
Nice.

1643
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,700
I wasn't looking.

1644
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,700
Come on, fellow.

1645
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,700
Don't go yet.

1646
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,700
Don't go yet.

1647
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,700
I'm so sorry.

1648
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,700
Remember, you want to run ahead and then jump.

1649
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,700
It's fine. Just do the press the button.

1650
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,700
Press the button.

1651
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,700
Oh, highest unlocked point.

1652
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,700
Oh, my God.

1653
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,700
Is that so much better?

1654
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,700
Oh, my God.

1655
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,700
Wait, what happened?

1656
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,700
What happened?

1657
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,700
Why are we all there?

1658
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,700
What the heck?

1659
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,700
Do you want to do it again

1660
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,700
to see if we change again?

1661
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,700
Okay.

1662
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,700
Oh.

1663
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,700
No.

1664
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,700
Oh, my God.

1665
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,700
Oh, my God.

1666
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,700
Oh, my God.

1667
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,700
The OG Sun Squad is now just down to one.

1668
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,700
Oh, wait.

1669
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,700
Back out.

1670
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,700
Go.

1671
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,700
Jump.

1672
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,700
Oh, fuck.

1673
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,700
It's fine.

1674
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,700
Don't worry. I've got you.

1675
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,700
I got you.

1676
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,700
I want some ice cream, but I'll probably die.

1677
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,700
I'm just craving. Maybe I should get some sherbert.

1678
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,700
Because I'm alert.

1679
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,700
Well, I'm not allergic,

1680
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,700
but I'm definitely intolerant.

1681
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,700
But there's milk and sherbert.

1682
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,700
Is there?

1683
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,700
Sorbet, sorry.

1684
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,700
I think you mean sorbet.

1685
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,700
Sorbet, sherbert, all the same to me.

1686
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,700
When sherbert has milk sorbet, it does not.

1687
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,700
Why are we all?

1688
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,700
What are we doing?

1689
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,700
What are we doing?

1690
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,700
We're all just baiting each other.

1691
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,700
What is happening here?

1692
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,700
We're just like, do we go now?

1693
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,700
No, now?

1694
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,700
No.

1695
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,700
Okay, ready?

1696
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,700
Go.

1697
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,700
That was so funny to me.

1698
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,700
You guys just running back and forth.

1699
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,700
Don't touch the thing.

1700
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,700
I did it.

1701
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,700
I touched it.

1702
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,700
I did it.

1703
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,700
I touched it again.

1704
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,700
I did it.

1705
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,700
Quick, do it.

1706
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,700
Hit the button.

1707
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,700
Okay.

1708
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,700
Okay, we got this.

1709
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,700
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1710
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,700
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1711
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,700
Yeah, just go, go, go, go, go.

1712
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,700
There you go.

1713
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,700
Speedrun, go, jump.

1714
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,700
Go.

1715
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,700
I went too early.

1716
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1717
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,700
Grab the hook.

1718
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,700
Grab the hook.

1719
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,700
Okay.

1720
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,700
Yay!

1721
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,700
Yay!

1722
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,700
I think I was about to climb off.

1723
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,700
Just climbed up just to get taken off.

1724
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,700
Here we go.

1725
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,700
We're heading to the car.

1726
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,700
The car.

1727
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,700
Oh, the car.

1728
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,700
There's a little bit more, but then there's the car.

1729
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,700
Best driver bib has it.

1730
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,700
I have a feeling she's going to lose this time.

1731
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1732
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,700
Do you want to, I kind of want to watch

1733
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,700
Amy or Sopalto try to drive now that we have the checkpoint.

1734
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,700
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

1735
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,700
I don't have a driver's license.

1736
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,700
I don't know if I qualify.

1737
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,700
I mean, this is your training right here.

1738
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,700
Yeah, this is the test.

1739
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,700
Okay, I'll drive.

1740
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,700
Go ahead, Amy.

1741
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,700
Get in the back, ladies.

1742
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,700
We're going shopping.

1743
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,700
It looks like old man just driving us.

1744
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,700
How do I turn?

1745
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:26,700
How do I turn?

1746
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,700
You did it, you got it?

1747
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,700
Oh, I have to be moving forward to turn.

1748
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,700
Yup, yup.

1749
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,700
It's a little tricky.

1750
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,700
It is harder than it looks.

1751
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,700
Oh boy.

1752
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,700
Oh boy.

1753
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,700
I won't be running into every single one of these.

1754
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,700
Excuse me.

1755
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,700
Proceeds to hit one.

1756
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,700
I won't, I won't.

1757
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,700
You got to go faster to avoid them.

1758
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,700
They actually don't really knock you off.

1759
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,700
They kind of just bop you.

1760
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,700
Oh, nice job.

1761
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,700
Thread in the needle.

1762
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,700
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1763
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,700
Ah! Ah!

1764
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,700
Ah! Ah!

1765
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,700
What the f...

1766
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,700
What just happened?

1767
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,700
Stay calm, stay calm.

1768
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,700
I'm letting you see both of us and...

1769
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,700
Stay where you're staying!

1770
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,700
Stay where you're staying!

1771
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,700
I'm letting you see!

1772
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,700
I'm letting you see!

1773
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,700
I'm letting you see!

1774
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,700
I'm letting you see!

1775
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,700
I'm letting you see!

1776
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,700
Maybe it's because we're on easy mode.

1777
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,700
No, even on easy mode, you can fall off.

1778
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,700
That's so weird.

1779
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,700
We made it!

1780
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,700
We made it!

1781
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,700
Thanks for the design.

1782
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,700
Thanks for the design.

1783
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,700
You did that.

1784
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,700
You're very welcome.

1785
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,700
I can't, my face hurts.

1786
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,700
That one.

1787
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,700
And...

1788
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,700
Jump.

1789
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,700
Jump again.

1790
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,700
And I'm gone.

1791
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,700
And then we did.

1792
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,700
Wait.

1793
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,700
I'm gonna make it.

1794
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,700
Oh, okay.

1795
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,700
Sopralto. Wait.

1796
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,700
Oh, no.

1797
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,700
Oh, no, we don't need you.

1798
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,700
I'm gonna be really funny if Sopralto...

1799
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,700
Wait.

1800
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,700
Let's do it.

1801
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,700
Wait. Oh, okay.

1802
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,700
Let's see if Sopralto can do it.

1803
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,700
Come on.

1804
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,700
Come on, Sapikins.

1805
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,700
Okay.

1806
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,700
Oh, you're going fast.

1807
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,700
Oh, she's zooming.

1808
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,700
Hit it.

1809
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,700
Kill him.

1810
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,700
Don't actually kill him.

1811
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,700
Okay, keep going.

1812
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,700
Oh, she's driving backwards.

1813
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,700
That takes skill.

1814
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,700
I'm trying to figure out how to reverse.

1815
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,700
There you go.

1816
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,700
Three point turn.

1817
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,700
Don't drive us into the hole.

1818
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,700
Okay.

1819
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,700
Oh, don't make me laugh.

1820
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,700
I'm gonna mess it up.

1821
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,700
You probably were gonna mess it up anyways.

1822
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,700
But, yeah.

1823
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,700
No, it'll happen.

1824
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,700
No, maybe guinea pigs shouldn't drive.

1825
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:14,700
No, you're doing it.

1826
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,700
She's doing it.

1827
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,700
She's doing it.

1828
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,700
We're going backwards.

1829
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,700
Are you threatening to kill us?

1830
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,700
What's happening?

1831
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,700
Turn.

1832
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,700
Turn.

1833
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,700
Don't act like this.

1834
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,700
Please.

1835
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,700
Turn, turn.

1836
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,700
Turn.

1837
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,700
Turn.

1838
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,700
Turn.

1839
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,700
Turn.

1840
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,700
Turn.

1841
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,700
Turn.

1842
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,700
See, I told you you can get knocked off.

1843
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,700
Just drive backwards.

1844
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,700
Turn around.

1845
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:58,700
Oh, can we restart this part?

1846
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,700
No, you can do this.

1847
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,700
I believe in you.

1848
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,700
Just drive backwards.

1849
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:04,700
Just drive backwards.

1850
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,700
Just drive backwards.

1851
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,700
I can't see backwards.

1852
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:07,700
You can't see?

1853
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,700
Just turn your camera.

1854
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,700
Wait, I got it.

1855
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:10,700
Wait, I can use the ramp to help me.

1856
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,700
Oh, my God.

1857
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,700
Oh, my God.

1858
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:25,700
What are you doing?

1859
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,700
Mario Karting.

1860
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,700
I can't believe this happened again.

1861
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,700
You got this?

1862
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,700
I don't want to do these things.

1863
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:34,700
Great.

1864
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:41,700
Baby, pull this back.

1865
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,700
No.

1866
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,700
All right.

1867
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,700
Well, now we know how that was going to go.

1868
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:47,700
Yeah.

1869
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:48,700
Oh.

1870
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:49,700
Okay.

1871
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,700
I didn't know what to do.

1872
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,700
I didn't know what to do.

1873
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:52,700
Can you pull?

1874
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,700
I'm trying.

1875
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,700
I'm trying.

1876
01:26:54,700 --> 01:27:01,700
I wish they had little dance moves.

1877
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,700
Like a little form.

1878
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,700
Like I could e-boat.

1879
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,700
Like the orange justice here.

1880
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:07,700
Exactly.

1881
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:08,700
This is me dancing.

1882
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,700
Oh, my God.

1883
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,700
I'm laughing again so hard.

1884
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,700
I'm doing a little bit of a chat, though.

1885
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,700
I'm crying.

1886
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:13,700
This is the best part.

1887
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,700
I'm crying.

1888
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,700
I'm crying.

1889
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:16,700
I'm crying.

1890
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,700
I'm crying.

1891
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,700
I'm crying.

1892
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,700
I'm crying.

1893
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:20,700
I'm crying.

1894
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,700
I'm crying.

1895
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,700
I'm crying.

1896
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:23,700
I'm crying.

1897
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,700
This is not a good dance.

1898
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,700
Maybe if we were talking about piss, I would have done better.

1899
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,700
Okay.

1900
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,700
I miss.

1901
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,700
Okay.

1902
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,700
Okay.

1903
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,700
What's your favorite flavor of piss?

1904
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:34,700
Apple juice.

1905
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,700
Red.

1906
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:36,700
Oh.

1907
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,700
Red?

1908
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:38,700
I like mine a little spicy.

1909
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:39,700
Oh, please stop falling off.

1910
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:40,700
I could drive again.

1911
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:41,700
My turn.

1912
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,700
Did she get in the front?

1913
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,700
Who's in the front right now?

1914
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,700
I'm in the front.

1915
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:45,700
I'm in the front.

1916
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:46,700
I'm in the front.

1917
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,700
I'm in the front.

1918
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,700
I'm in the front.

1919
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,700
I'm in the front.

1920
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,700
I'm in the front.

1921
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,700
I'm in the front.

1922
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,700
I'm in the front.

1923
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,700
I'm in the front.

1924
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:54,700
I'm in the front.

1925
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,700
I'm in the front.

1926
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:56,700
Who's in the front right now?

1927
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,700
It's me.

1928
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,700
Okay.

1929
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,700
Okay.

1930
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,700
Thank goodness.

1931
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,700
Thank goodness.

1932
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:02,700
Why am I going backwards?

1933
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,700
I'm in the front.

1934
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,700
You are?

1935
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:05,700
Wait, what?

1936
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:06,700
Oh, I thought I was driving.

1937
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,700
What are you doing?

1938
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,700
Wait, who's driving?

1939
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,700
Me.

1940
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,700
Are you really?

1941
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,700
Seriously?

1942
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,700
I was like, wait, that can't be.

1943
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,700
Yeah, that makes sense.

1944
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,700
Yeah.

1945
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:15,700
Yeah, that's sloppy.

1946
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,700
Yeah, that's happy

1947
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:25,060
I've never gotten pulled over and I have a really good lesson. It's just not in hell

1948
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:32,980
I don't know if that's true. I think you're lying to us. I think you're like driver's license is fake

1949
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:36,140
Did you die in a car crash? Is that how you got to hell?

1950
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:39,580
She crashed a car. She had like 50 pedestrians

1951
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:48,700
He's like just hitting a strike. You ever thought about that?

1952
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,700
I'm stuck. Alright, my turn

1953
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,700
I

1954
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,700
Think it's how entertained we are by this car

1955
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:25,420
I wish I could jump and do flips can I go faster? No, this is the max you can go

1956
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,740
It's because you're just a bad driver, babe

1957
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:40,780
Sorry freeze old

1958
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:07,780
I was doing pretty good. I was going I was going no stop. Okay. I almost made it to the end somebody's a decent driver here, you know, not you

1959
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,100
You

1960
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:22,740
They do you get stuck on some things, but some things they don't get stuck on which is

1961
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,100
Okay, I'm ready

1962
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,340
I'm ready to throw myself off the cube

1963
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:35,980
Okay, I have already thrown myself off the cube

1964
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,700
I'm on the cube. I'm on the cube

1965
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,740
I'm no longer on the cube

1966
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,980
I'm on the cube. I'm jumping off the cube

1967
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,700
I was one

1968
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,500
Okay, so now we'll respond like right here. So it's fine

1969
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,500
You're like a side character

1970
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:10,300
One that dies on episode three and you motivate you motivate everybody else

1971
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:15,180
She's the Mabel sacrifice

1972
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,140
I can't

1973
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,860
Can't

1974
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:38,820
I almost as far did it cuz I was laughing so hard

1975
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,380
Jump up my head is too big

1976
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:58,780
See it's hard we have to like go over here and yeah

1977
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:02,620
Yeah, it's easier from the little platform

1978
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,860
I

1979
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,500
Mean

1980
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,780
And we have the giggles too much it's getting harder

1981
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,840
Oh, I can see my insides I did not like that

1982
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:01,580
You can see your inside. I like a like clip so that I could see my inside of my model. It was kind of scary

1983
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:10,100
It's doing it again. I can see inside my pants and I get the chain looks like looks like so if you back up against this and

1984

Goodbye wait, are we grunting are we?

1992
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:34,820

Don't want to make those noises. I don't think I'll ever leave these noises down if I make them. Hell. They're not that bad

1997
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,660
I mean, they'll be in private me and you and maybe a few other people

1998
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,780
I'm literally gonna cry, please

1999
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:03,580
Oh

2000
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:17,140

It's time it's time it's time by the way, so let's let's just wait a moment

2025
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:43,660
Yep, yes, it is mm-hmm, and we're only gonna go higher

2026
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:48,520
Mm-hmm, do you think we can finish the game? No, no

2027
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:54,980
This game is so much bigger. There's a whole other level before this after this one. Okay

2028
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:04,420
Yeah jump just try not to vault just try to jump it's hard. I actually know it yeah, I give up

2029
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:06,420
I can't even follow my own fucking advice

2030
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,420
Oh

2031
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:28,740
I'm ready. Yes. Go. Oh, okay

2032
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,420

Thank God

2037
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,420
You could like fall off of it

2038
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:13,820
We did it gang

2039
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:30,380
Welcome to the whispering balls I got an achievement me to reach the mysterious cave

2040
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:32,380
Oh

2041
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:37,540
If you guys want to explore feel free there's nothing but go ahead. No, I'm good

2042
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:41,140
Don't worry. No. Yeah

2043
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:43,140
The elevator is very safe

2044
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:49,260
Okay, so be careful because there might be a spot where you can fall through are we naked

2045
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:52,900
No, oh and my it looks like we're naked

2046
01:40:53,740 --> 01:41:00,020
Wait, oh you can die. Yes. Oh do we do we drown? No? No, I already did

2047
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,300
Oh

2048
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:08,540
True true true. Oh, wait. No, I don't think we're at that water spot yet. Where you have to like swim around all and go

2049
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,420
Why are we have to run there's something chasing

2050
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:21,500
They should do that they should add like a monster that chases you so it's like scarier. Yeah. Yeah

2051
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,780
Very safe

2052
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,500
It's funny you what you guys look like when you look up

2053
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:35,180
Oh, wait, our heads actually turn. Yeah, it's kind of funny

2054
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:39,420
Okay, so this is a puzzle

2055
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:45,740
You say oh, what are you serious? It's a puzzle. You have to get the jump and we have to hit the buttons

2056
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:49,300
six brain cells we got this

2057
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:54,660
We have to hit them all. Yes in order to open the door

2058
01:41:54,660 --> 01:42:00,100
Okay, where's the next one up here up there?

2059
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,260
And then I got it

2060
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:11,620
Then we gotta go to the I can't remember if they're timed or not. Where's the last button? It's on the other side

2061
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:17,060
Where I am I'm I'm I'm in stuff to help me

2062
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:22,420
I can't get up. Where's the last button? It's behind you up here

2063
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:25,140
What

2064
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:29,380
Sorry, miss. Oh, we did it. Nice

2065
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:36,820
Easy peasy lemon squeezy

2066
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:41,220
Okay, now we got to make that that sprint jump ready jump grab

2067
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:43,700
Yep

2068
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,220
Okay

2069
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:49,460
We're from the side

2070
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,660
I'm going. Oh, no. Oh, no

2071
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:56,900
We're good. We're good. Okay. Wait, wait here

2072
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,700
Go down go down

2073
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:02,260
Goodbye

2074
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,260
Oh, hey look we're back to the car

2075
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:14,020
No, no, absolutely not. It means hell. It's me driving that car

2076
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,580
Okay, there we go

2077
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:30,580
I'm stuck

2078
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:33,140
It's okay. I'm a fairy

2079
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,100
She was a fairy

2080
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,660
Hi Sophie

2081
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:46,020
Back to the car

2082
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:51,540
You won the car you were obsessed with this car. You just want to drive again. No, I think I just like see

2083
01:43:55,780 --> 01:44:00,260
I have a very nice car that you don't use it's a mom van

2084
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:08,580
And you're calling me and Viv the hags. It probably has zero miles on it too. I think it's like 25,000

2085
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:11,060
miles pretty good

2086
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:13,060
I actually don't know what that

2087
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:19,140
Um, I it's how many like it's just how much you've used your car

2088
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:26,980
But also it my parents gave it to me so I could go to college to get more knowledge

2089
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:34,180
And then I chose to become a streamer so you see where I'm happy

2090
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:39,380
Oh gosh

2091
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:41,220
Oh gosh

2092
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:44,740
So this is where me is Zura, Apollo and um

2093
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:50,180
Freya got stuck on really hardcore last time and we were raging by the end of the street

2094
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:57,380
Yeah, I go over here. He's got to be mindful of the lasers. Demure very demure very mindful. Okay, be ready to jump

2095
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,860
I'm always mindful

2096
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:05,060
Okay, and then we're right here too. Yep, then turn to the side and then go over there. Oh

2097
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,180
We're so good at this

2098
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:12,180
We let us finish those first. I mean look at us go

2099
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,540
All right, where are we going next to that one that one?

2100
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:19,220
Oh, okay, our massive. We're actually doing a lot better

2101
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:26,420
When I played this last holy crap. It's the piss buff. It's the piss buff. It's the piss buff

2102
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:28,420
Oh

2103
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:37,300
Oh, sorry, I jumped too soon. It's all right. I jumped too soon. Oh my god. Oh my god. This game's breaking me

2104
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,500
Almost there. Oh

2105
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:43,780
That was backed up so far. I fell off

2106
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:45,780
Okay

2107
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:49,940
We did it. You guys couldn't do that. Yeah, we couldn't for some reason

2108
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:54,020
They didn't have the joint chemistry that we do our brain cells

2109
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:59,220
I think it was this one actually that we we had it because we when you fall you have to start back

2110
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,500
Yeah

2111
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:05,700
Yeah, but you have to start back at um this part

2112
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:11,300
Because it's the same level technically that's why

2113
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:16,100
How long have we been doing this 147 45

2114
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,980
Oh

2115
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:22,020
141 45

2116
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:25,220
So 147 is close enough you round me

2117
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,980
I don't like

2118
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:31,540
I missed

2119
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:36,260
Oh, we were about to fall perfectly in that hole

2120
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:40,020
I felt perfectly in your your hole last night

2121
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:45,060
I felt perfectly in your mom's hole last night. I was gonna say that

2122
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:49,620
I was gonna say that but I don't want to put your mom into this and now I see that we're allowed to

2123
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:52,420
Of course we are mom's fair game

2124
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:55,780
Like she was last night

2125
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:01,380
Me and emi straight the same two brain cells apparently ready

2126
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,580
Yes, okay, don't miss

2127
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,980
I didn't even get to jump I like someone fell into it

2128
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:15,700
I jumped on top of it. I'm sorry. It's okay. I can't be mad at you. It feels soppy. I would have been pissed

2129
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:19,060
I'm gonna jump off the I'm gonna jump off the map right now. Don't touch me

2130
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:22,420
Do it. I'll pee in your fucking suit

2131
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:27,940
Don't test me. I'm fully off laughing

2132
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:31,780
You see what I have to do is she's so mean to me

2133
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:35,540
Is that mean or me defending myself? It's kind of hot. You guys should kiss

2134
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:40,980
We are we're gonna hold toes our toes. You're gonna get a lot in our locked toes

2135
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:46,580
You know a little crazy thing. I actually don't like people touching my feet

2136
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:49,540
Really?

2137
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:52,660
Oh my god

2138
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:55,940
You haven't had me touch your feet. Okay. You don't know what it's like

2139
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:02,500
One time I went to get a massage and I told the lady not to touch my feet because I felt felt weird about it

2140
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:09,220
I just don't like people touching my feet. I don't know. I've just been a thing. Do you get ticklish?

2141
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:16,180
No, no, it's just like I get ticklish. I just don't like go go go go the only time I'll let people touch my feet is my pedicurist

2142
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:22,180
And I'll giggle every time and she makes fun of me. Oh, so you're ticklish. I'm extremely ticklish on my feet

2143
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:26,340
Well, you just gave us ammo. What are you gonna do with that?

2144
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,500

2149
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:01,700
Sorry, I didn't know where you're going. I was turning on the light. It's dark in my house

2150
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,620

01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:10,580

2154
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:27,540

2155
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:32,180
Back to the car

2156
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:36,420

01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:47,220

It's not gonna be me

2160
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:54,580
Did you do that on purpose

2161
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:06,100
It's like I know like ticklishness is a fetish

2162
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:12,740
You know what ticklishness is a fetish? Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Yeah, like, I know some people get off from being like tickled

2163
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:15,460
What? Yeah, yeah

2164
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:17,700
Yeah, it's a thing. It's a thing for sure

2165
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:20,660
You know, I took sexual psychology and I didn't even know that

2166
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:26,500
Really? I mean, I don't think the point of sexual psychology is to teach you about every single kink that exists

2167
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:30,180
No, no, I did learn that there's a difference between a kink and a fetish

2168
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:32,100
Oh, wait, what's the difference?

2169
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:36,580
Uh, a kink is something that amplifies the the the dew, you know

2170
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:40,580
And then a fetish is something like you genuinely need to get off

2171
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:43,060
Oh

2172
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:46,580
So warwick for me. Yes

2173
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:49,380
Okay, okay. Wait, what's warwick?

01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:06,260
No, it's okay. You don't have to tell me about it

2178
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:09,220

02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:05,220
And it was so it was about this like

02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:12,580
There's a delinquent boy and they were childhood friends

2305
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:16,260
With this one guy who's like the honorable student, but they all go to different

2306
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:20,340
Oh my god. I know what you're talking about and I read and then they're like they're like

02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:25,220
You're you're uh, are you at top or bottom? Is this like omega versus shit?

02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:29,140
No, no, no, I can't get up or an omega

2309
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:34,980
So are you top or bottom and then you don't pull me up just keep going just keep going

Hold on. I'm getting it. I'm getting it
