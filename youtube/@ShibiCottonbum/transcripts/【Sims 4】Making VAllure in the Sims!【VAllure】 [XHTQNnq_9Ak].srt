just have boomi and Fia and Reina as throwables if anybody knows of an equivalent I don't know

47

50
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:11,100
dom of jan ones indulge from vealer and I like to be silly and I like to you know what I decided

51
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm probably gonna make do a sock puppet making stream ever since the hand cam from yesterday

52
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,540
I think I'm gonna do that I'm gonna make sock puppets of all my gen mates I think that's a great

53
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:32,620
idea um a custom Muppet is 500 bucks be crown funding that boys no kidding no

54
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:43,340
no suck my members boomi kaiju fight that'd be sick um but yeah I'm that she be but um it's funny

55
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,940
because I actually used to stream at this time all the time I used to stream at 10 a.m. and um

56
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,580
12 p.m. um so it's actually kind of nice waking up early to get stuff done and then like hopping

57
00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:00,060
on stream early and then I have time to like I need to clean my house I need to send Zumba on a mission

58
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,500
Zumba is my Roomba his name is Zumba and he needs to clean up all the litter that's on my floor

59
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:16,060
right now boomi what are you doing um but uh Muppet on Throne why you gotta mess with boomi like

60
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,940
that all I want to do is cuddle and sleep I was trying to uh tomah I don't think you noticed this

61
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:28,060
but I had a lot of typos and when I was messaging you on discord um because boomi was laying on

62
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,460
my keyboard and it was hard for me to like type around him because he was just big plopping on

63
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,140
stuff all right let me actually I'm gonna put I have a neck pillow I'm gonna stick that in the um

64
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:45,500
microwave because it's like has um essential oils and stuff because my neck hurts

65
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,140
but uh I'm in a good mood today although I need to clean my house

66
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,980
that's pretty it's messy I feel like a mother because I'm taking care of my baby

67
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,140
I put on the cat cam but I am not properly clothed for the occasion so

68
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,380
Zumba versus actually boomi's fine with it he just like stares at it a little bristle excuse me

69
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:38,620
a little bristle does like choked we'll pick up um the thumbnail is hilarious you like it

70
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:46,060
I like so like I don't make my thumbnails um I am so lucky to have a management team

71
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:52,460
and a manager that makes my thumbnails for me um in my schedule for me well I'm like I make my

72
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:59,980
schedule they just put it together and so they send me that and I'm just like what is this

73
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:08,780
this thousand yard stare I'm just I'm like this is terrifying are you going to install wicked

74
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:16,300
whims I was tempted to I was very tempted but I obviously can't play wicked whims on here so I

75
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:23,980
might actually get wicked whims for um the house of blue I just adopted a pair of kittens and right

76
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:32,060
now they're tearing apart some paper oh congrats nice job yes adopts don't shop you know always

77
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:41,100
rescue um I wish I had done that uh before uh because so many cats and kittens are in shelters

78
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,340
and stuff so make sure you if you're considering a cat or a dog or any sort of animal see if they

79
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:55,820
have one available near you at a local rescue or shelter um inside you there are two mothers one

80
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,060
that takes care of fear the other one takes care of like the tomagotchi where is the tomagotchi

81
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,980
I've actually been taking good care of the tomagotchi it looks like pekora now

82
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,620
it wears a pekora wig let me see what's it up to I checked on it this morning oh it pooped

83
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:16,780
nice

84
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,940
it's at it's at top happiness and top food I have so much money because I've been playing games

85
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,620
oh yeah shout out to the management yeah boomi and fia are rescued um reina was from a breeder

86
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:42,380
because we my mom was um pretty allergic to cats and so sime's are a little bit less dandery

87
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,500
so she wanted to go to a breeder um but my mom even herself wishes that she went to a shelter

88
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,940
because she realized she was allergic to reina anyways because reina is weird and she uh still

89
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,980
had a lot of danger although her sister soley who was um no longer with us but she's forever in our

90
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:16,300
hearts um was not like that like she it was funny okay I got that yeah I like yeah I'm paco mama um

91
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm actually I'm mildly allergic to cats myself but only if I like rub my eyes but I feel like

92
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:32,620
that's anybody um and same thing with dogs fia oh thank you for the lick she licked my nose

93
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,100
she licked my nose earlier she gave me a nose lick

94
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,940
um tall gachis are addictive it'll probably scream at me during stream

95
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,660
yeah I've been like rubbing my eyes all morning that's how I know I need to like

96
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,380
okay boomi I need to um like clean the house because I'm like I probably need the vacuum

97
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,980
song what's the guy's doing they're playing in the tunnel that I got them

98
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,700
um I must now observe that by by the transit property owner says she now has a monkey

99
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,020
don't let the distract her from the fact that paco has a monkey

100
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
okay

101
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,740
the monkey's cute though as she has

102
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,940
I wonder what it's like to have I don't know it's such an interesting looking monkey because

103
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,540
it doesn't look like a typical monkey but it's a type of monkey

104
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:44,220
yeah did you know so I had a friend at my last job who her mom was like an allergy um

105
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,900
specialist or therapist and she was able like you can go to allergy therapy and they'll treat

106
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,980
you for it and usually they can cure you of your allergies and I couldn't I didn't believe her and

107
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,340
she's like oh no I used to be severely allergic to cats and dogs and I have like and I have two

108
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:11,900
dogs now and I'm like what how does that work they're loud I would probably it's not actually

109
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:22,060
a monkey it's just pretend I'm still peckering um I think I would probably just buy um stronti what

110
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:29,500
are you saying stronti's messaging me she's like oh you're streaming never mind um uh I would say

111
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I would probably build a whole like enclosure for it if I had any exotic pets exotic pets are a lot

112
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,020
of money so I build like this whole enclosure for it if I have one which I bet peck or peck or

113
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,660
actually has

114
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,940
blah blah oh tomah just sent me a thing called kudino e-pets

115
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,860
oh I might have to look at that

116
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:12,860

117
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:32,060

129
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,540
it probably was rabies and I was like um actually mom did you know that rabies are uh opossums are

130
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:05,020
one of the few animals that are actually immune to rabies and cannot contract rabies pushes up

131
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:14,140
glasses uh opossums deserve more love man uh rebranding right now as a possum chuba

144
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,460

145
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,860
room that who played video games all day and then they came to life and then they became

146
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,820
and they're just like covered in garbage and sludge and like they have like a

147
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:07,820
like a really crusty sock stuck to their hair a bionicle vtuber a sad sad toy story

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,940
um

199
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,900
that's not mercy

200
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,420
top left

201
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:51,660
buddy what do you mean oh identity oh okay okay okay I got you that's not mercy that is not mercy

202
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,820
um

203
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,780
a boy named grace um

204
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:14,460
a feminine lobo okay you know what I think I might start with her she got some eyebrows um

205
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:21,740
um so obviously she is should we do you make them adults or young adults

206
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,900
and I'll do young adults you know that looks better walk style uh

207
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,020
this is gonna be mercy's walk style

208
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,580
uh the voice

209
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,180
no way

210
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,460
what did she say my what

211
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,460
what

212
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,460
it's mercy

213
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
uh

214
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,860
sarpa of a chorg you know that's kind of too girt like I like this one

215
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,060
that sounds like an anime character dub

216
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
zarkini enough wait

217
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,020
huh

218
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,780
I don't like that

219
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,380
amigabor

220
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:51,900
I think that sounds like her a little bit

221
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,660
mercy could have been a shodan protagonist no I'll probably end up giving that voice to like

222
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:11,740
emi that's okay uh okay so uh her aspiration is obviously love

223
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:23,900
she's a serial romantic she wants to find the one that's what it is that's yep

224
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,180
mm-hmm

225
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,660
simlish that's like I like finding like songs that are like the original artist records in simlish

226
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,020
I forget what I was listening to I think it was like it was like katie perry and she was singing in simlish

227
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,220
how good is my simlish a warm a bambi

228
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,060
zaba zoo I don't fucking know what he told me

229
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,660
me just talking in tongues

230
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,820
I bet they did uh let's see her preferences

231
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,380
she likes to do activities her activities

232
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,260
excuse me

233
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:23,900
um let's see because like mercy isn't super into like musical stuff or cooking

234
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,700
I feel like she'd be into handiness for some reason or writing what do you guys think or

235
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,380
no no mischief is definitely for like I see her in me um video gaming I think I might give

236
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:51,100
the video gaming to Azura just stalking yeah no sewing there's no like um doing that sort of stuff

237
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,540
they have programming and mixology though I guess those are just I'll do handiness

238
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,740
yeah

239
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,220
wait can I do multiple oh I can she can I was just 50

240
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,860
oh what the heck well obviously there's probably more like I don't have any mods installed on this

241
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,620
I'll put video gaming and writing then

242
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,300
cool okay

243
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,220
you you said it you said it mercy

244
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,260
is mixology another word for orgasm there any scissors probably but we should probably keep them away

245
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,980
okay mercy's traits clumsy like myself

246
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,500
uh romantic

247
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,500

254
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:47,100

255
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,220

can this is there a purple color okay I guess that's the closest to purple

259
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,900

260
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,380

okay medium then because that's too short

438
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,340

oh my god what are these Karen ass haircuts though

441
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,500

442
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,620
oh my god I will all change her face very fast

443
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,620
do light blue I can't do light blue there's only turquoise blue

444
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,140
so I have to make it white because that's the closest I can do I should just give her ban two knots

445
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,940
okay you know what I'm just gonna keep it like that for now she looks like she looks weird right now

446
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,420

447
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:57,420
okay she has no no that's a Karen haircut you're not wrong hold on uh

448
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:04,300
I'll keep it like that then I don't know she's looking like a freaking Targaryen

449
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,420
let me just change her face because it's bothering me

450
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,860
uh can I randomize her face

451
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:26,780
that's a no that's not gonna work

452
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,300
that kind of looks right her neck looks a little

453
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,420
why is her body looks so weirdly proportioned

454
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:49,660
I was hoping when I randomize the face it would randomize all her features

455
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,580
because this will just randomize the skin tone

456
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,060
I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa

457
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:15,900
I hate that what is that face

458
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,020
what is happening why is I see the hardest to make so far

459
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:33,500
ew okay hold on let me do this face

460
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:41,340
yeah that looks cool uh whatever uh anyways let's just zoom in

461
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,700
you know what look turn that way I see while we do this

462
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:55,020
well madam cook uh I don't I don't know we'll have to see um let's see I think for her

463
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,140
what should her aspiration be

464
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:11,660
I feel like it should be like family should be like nature because she's from

465
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,340
God quest

466
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:27,820
I think it should be family yeah family she wants a big happy family yes

467
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:40,460
and then her preferences music duh um she likes all music winter holiday music yes

468
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,100
what is s-pop is that supposed to be like k-pop but simlish

469
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:57,580
new pop music kids radio lullabies hip-hop electronical carnival beats um I don't

470

473
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,820
I feel like she should be hotheaded because she's a bear

01:02:53,820 --> 01:03:00,140
just give her blue eyes eye details no I want to change her eye color

484
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:09,580

if I try to put a vest on her I don't know if there's any vest what if I do

501
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,220
because it might be under something masculine

502
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,860
oh I think she looked cute in a little crop top to be honest

503
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:31,580

okay let me make you white again she's she's pale milk ew that's not the right color

727
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,900
that sounds bad

728
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,100
I'm so sorry

729
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:45,900
yeah okay I'll make her neutral toned because she's not as cool as I see what I can I can slide to

730
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,500
customize the color what

731
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:53,340
okay

732
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,300
or I can really make her dead

733
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:11,500
no this looks like sour milk that sound I should shut up that sounds so bad

734
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:23,740
never I'm just gonna stop talking that sounds so racist I'm so sorry

735
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,540
all right let's just do strotties

736
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:30,700
hold on she's she's a little bit too thick oms

737
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:32,700
yeah

738
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,500
yeah

739
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:46,700
as big as I can make your butt safely your arms are so long for no reason

740
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:52,300
your arms usually are like up here why are your arms so long

741
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:57,740
uh can I do like her body

742
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:00,780
tight

743
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:10,860
y'all mama yeah let's just do that all right

744
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:17,020
hey strontie how's it going what color are your eyes again purple

745
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:23,580
so I can give her purple eyes but I can't give orange eyes to icy doesn't make any sense

746
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,180
um

747
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,660
you want to be stuck around with that bbl

748
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:38,540
it's a creepy ass teeth um so for her

749
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:51,180
what should stronties um aspiration be I think perhaps family and then have a successful lineage

750
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:55,980
I think that will be it it was nature

751
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:02,700
that would just be everything about fishing and that's the opposite so I think family with

752
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:07,180
she wants her people to succeed popularity no she doesn't care about popularity

753
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:09,580
um

754
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:14,860
hobbies

755
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:18,460
video gaming

756
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:26,460
excuse me rockets uh let's give her rocket science you know what just because

757
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:36,860
comedy I know she's a cuttlefish and she's trying to save the oceans but I'm gonna put

758
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:44,220
fishing just so you can see her by the water can I make strontie perpetually pregnant no

759
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:52,780
actually well probably no why are her boobs big get get rid of those things I can't believe you

760
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:56,860
can't make them flatter than that to be honest there's all this like body stuff in here but

761
01:36:56,860 --> 01:37:02,460
you can't make them super flat um all right so let's say she is

762
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:06,060
let's see

763
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:14,380
let's do loves outdoors

764
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,500
family oriented

765
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:31,660
and then

766
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:37,100
I think I'll put self-assured or ambitious

767
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:44,540
this

768
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:49,740
ambitious

769
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:54,540
steps maybe

770
01:37:54,540 --> 01:38:01,740
how noi noi noi noi all right let's fix her face so she doesn't look so much like I see

771
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,100
her

772
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,300
I can't tell who's talking I think it's reina

773
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:31,180
what are some of these eyes I don't Jesus seeing into your freaking soul

774
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:38,460
I make them a little bit smaller

775
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:44,780
pretty sure that was the original ones I started with but that's fine

776
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,460
um no okay put them back I just

777
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,660

oh my god it's kind of funny at the same time no I'm sorry it's so bad giant eyes for hypnotizing

781
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:29,660
let's give her like a thinner brow

782
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,500
that looks very mischievous

783
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,780
where is it that's actually so I like that one

784
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:52,780

01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:44,060
no no

794
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:55,740
kind of like the original nose I had but I don't know which one it was maybe that one

795
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:01,740
she was starting to look like baby doll from sucker punch

796
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,500
oh you know what I forgot to do I forgot to do her walk

797
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:15,500
strawberries walk

798
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,140
she walks goofy

799
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:24,940
no

800
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:28,940
mm-hmm

801
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:37,500
I think I like I think I like the

802
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:46,380
yeah I think I like that goofy cuttlefish I like that because it has the spirals

803
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,460
that's not even goofy she's just hunched over

804
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:59,660
she made them enemies after we broke up that's so scary

805
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:06,060
yeah we got cool okay she'll get the goofy walk then let's do her voice

806
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:17,340
I'm trying to go strong his voice right now I know she's about to start streaming

807
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:22,860
so if there's reeflings in the chat of course thank you for stopping by you can go say hi to

808
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:27,660
moment because I'm I do want to get through making all of us beforehand stream

809
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:34,620
we both say you say that's a nice war bow that doesn't give the charm

810
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:38,460
what

811
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:42,780
what

812
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:58,940
I can't add a Scottish accent

813
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:04,780
I could have two tabs open thank you I appreciate it

814
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,380
very hypnotic goofy walk indeed

815
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:14,140
I don't think I'm ever gonna get shiny's voice because none of them are gonna sound like her

816
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:17,660
because of the accent all right anyways let's continue working on her face

817
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:25,900
she's very cute she looks better no those lips are not it

818
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:39,340
it's hard to think of them as like non-anime women and like what type of lips they'd have

819
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:42,620
because they'd all just be like this it was that this was you're being real

820
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,860
this can I gender

821
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,300
okay those are fine

822
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:58,220
I don't want to give her a little thinner face

823
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:10,140
or how do I do her cheekbones because her cheekbones look a little bit

824
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:14,620
like

825
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:22,620
okay

826
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:31,500
that kind of makes her look like she has a double chin oh no she doesn't

827
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:34,540
I think it's just a shadow looks okay

828
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:35,760
okay

829
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:43,980
what is up with that freaky smile though I don't like

830
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:57,420
she constantly has that on her face from the reeflings

831
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:03,020
uh let's do a little

832
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:06,540
can I make it more subtle actually

833
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:14,540
that's cute oh wait I need to get the stuff off her face

834
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:21,500
what is this just cony confetti

835
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:26,540
oh my eye is watering

836
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:28,540
oh

837
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:34,540
I'm chip stealing eyes

838
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,900
it's me I'm the Batman

839
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:48,220
okay maybe it'll start looking like her let me change her outfit so I'll do stylized looks

840
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:52,380
her everyday look should be Leia

841
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:57,340
no um well what's shawty's everyday look be

842
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:03,260
she's wearing a kimono

843
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:13,020
or a yukata is there a yukata it'll just look like a that no that's Korean

844
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:19,340
it'll just like a woman like a white woman cosplaying as an asian woman I don't know if I like that

845
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,380

outfit. Cold weather, she's wearing...

1126
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:50,460
I don't like the cold weather looks like... What is she wearing in cold weather, boys?

1127
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:55,420
Wait, I feel like... Am I missing one? No.

1128
02:19:55,900 --> 02:20:10,620
This is actually pretty... Oh, I forgot to give her fishnets.

1129
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:15,100
Actually, no, she doesn't have fishnets. Her fishnets are on her chest.

1130
02:20:15,900 --> 02:20:19,500
This kind of works. Get rid of this gross ass makeup, though. No.

1131
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:28,220
No. Not it. The skirt? Whack. Whack. The skirt is whack.

1132
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:40,700
Okay, I kind of hate this.

1133
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:48,860
Perfect, Emi. She's ready for a night on the town.

1134
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:56,380
That's cute. I see you wear that. Yeah. Can I change her to like some crazier boots?

1135
02:20:57,180 --> 02:21:02,220
Just give her demonias. When it's snowing outside, that actually works. I'm down.

1136
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:07,980
Ah, I'm stretching.

1137
02:21:10,780 --> 02:21:13,740
All right, it's kind of a mood. All right, Azura.

1138
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:20,860
I was like, why do I feel like I'm forgetting someone? It was myself.

1139
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:24,940
Because I was like, wait, there's Azura, but who else? Let's do Azura.

1140
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:32,860
Should I make Azura an old lady because she's ancient?

1141
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:44,700
Azura, what happened to you?

1142
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:55,660
You know what? Damn, Azura, you still got it.

1143
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:06,620
What? No, she's going to be a young adult.

1144
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:13,980
This character is very ethnically ambiguous.

1145
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:24,380
Gosh, no, you look very annoying for some reason. You look like someone I'd meet at a theater

1146
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:27,500
event and you would not stop talking about how you helped out behind the scenes.

1147
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:34,140
Okay, this kind of works. What color is Azura's hair? Her hair is mint.

1148
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:36,780
That's as good as it's going to get.

1149
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:43,500
Let me change her skin tone a little bit.

1150
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:49,100
Can I change her outfit while I'm at it just so I can see what the heck I'm doing?

1151
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:55,820
Because I'll make her fig. This is not, this figure is not working for her. Let's just do that.

1152
02:22:56,380 --> 02:23:01,180
All right, that's Snatched Waste, Big Booba, Thicc.

1153
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:12,140
Okay, she's not, she's, yeah, there we go.

1154
02:23:14,300 --> 02:23:15,500
Hold on, fix that dumpy.

1155
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:20,300
Heal. I can't make her boobs any bigger.

1156
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:27,980
I can make him sack here. Let's give her some perky, perky fangs. Yeah, she's queen.

1157
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:38,380
Every day I see you get cuter than the last. Oh, that's impossible. I probably get more annoying.

1158
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:47,580
All right, oh, let's make her, uh, that kind of seems right.

1159
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:51,820
Neutral tones.

1160
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:59,260
This is, this is how people draw black people in the vtuber community. That's how they color them.

1161
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:07,340
This, that, or this, or alternatively.

1162
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:15,900
I'm just looking for gray tones. Frick.

1163
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:24,140
I remember I would ask for a tan if people would send me this, and I'm like, this is weird.

1164
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:34,060
Oh, okay, let's do a little bit. She's definitely more warmer tones, but she's not orange. I don't,

1165
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:43,900
maybe, no, that makes her look freaking green.

1166
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:58,460
The fact that it's hard to get her freaking skin tone. Okay, I think that's the closest one.

1167
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:06,540
Yeah, it's interesting. And especially like lighting-wise, they, they struggle with skin tones.

1168
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:13,660
Um, she's actually a little bit lighter than that, I realize. She's actually this skin tone,

1169
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:21,260
but we'll make her a little bit darker. Or I could try to find her actual skin tone.

1170
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:24,460
I don't really think, I like, I know I won't be able to find my actual skin tone.

1171
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:28,140
None of these match me. None of these match Azura's natural skin tone either.

1172
02:25:29,180 --> 02:25:30,940
Um, okay, let's just go back to this one.

1173
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:43,020
Can I like, yeah, use a color picker? Yeah, usually that's why, like, we offer palettes on our,

1174
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:48,940
like, I'm getting an updated ref sheet with my tan, and so I'm gonna, like,

1175
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:52,380
you can just, people can just color pick it from the picture, but they never do.

1176
02:25:52,460 --> 02:26:01,900
Oh, if the tone's wrong, at least for me, if you're commissioning it for Azura,

1177
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:08,140
then, um, I think me and Azura kind of both understand that nobody's probably gonna get

1178
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:13,020
our skin tone right. It's very rare when someone does. Um, but you know, sometimes there's really

1179
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:18,140
good skeb artists that gets, like, uh, on my PL, they got my skin tone right. And sometimes they

1180
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:22,540
just made me white. It's funny, more, the more people I commissioned on, I've commissioned

1181
02:26:23,180 --> 02:26:30,860
for my PL, when I was Rena on Vigen, made me white, and she was even lighter than how I am now.

1182
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:37,100
Or, like, around the same skin tone, and people would just, like, make her, like, green. I don't

1183
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:43,660
like what's happening. Doesn't the slide do anything? I don't, it kind of just makes it lighter.

1184
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:49,260
Like, yeah, it doesn't really do much.

1185
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:58,380
All right, we'll just, we'll do that. It's kind of a mood. Excuse me.

1186
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:09,020
Why can't I type? Cap lock on.

1187
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:21,980
Let's find a deeper tone. No.

1188
02:27:29,180 --> 02:27:33,100
That sounds like a zero when she gets really happy and excited.

1189
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:36,620
When she does, like, a goofy voice when she's, like, doing,

1190
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:41,100
is our child still, like, yes, our child's doing fine.

1191
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:48,540
Yeah, yeah, it's difficult. Yeah, that's a good point. Sometimes that they,

1192
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:53,340
they do a shadow or a highlight or, like, a lighter portion instead of just, like, the flat.

1193
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:58,300
Zarkiny and a fliss.

1194
02:27:58,300 --> 02:28:00,300
Zarkiny and a fliss.

1195
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:06,300
Wait, I got her voice really good before.

1196
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:19,260
That just sounds like Deku.

1197
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:24,220
That just sounds like Deku.

1198
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:35,180
It sounds really close.

1199
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:47,180
It sounds really close.

1200
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:51,180
Oh, Azura, stop, behave.

1201
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:59,180
Be Vos Febene.

1202
02:29:04,380 --> 02:29:07,180
It sounds like goofy.

1203
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:15,180
It's weird because between here and here it just sounds like...

1204
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:21,580
I kind of like that. I think that's as good as it's going to get.

1205
02:29:21,900 --> 02:29:24,860
Azura's walk. I think she'd have a perky walk.

1206
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:31,820
Yeah, what's this stuff? That'll be my walk.

1207
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:38,940
I naturally, like, walk really bouncerly, I've been told.

1208
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:41,660
What is snooty walk? That's stupid.

1209
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:46,140
No, yeah, I like the perky walk. For Azura, a hundred percent.

1210
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:54,700
All right, for Azura, naturally, it's family and to have as many children as possible.

1211
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:55,580
We all know this.

1212
02:29:58,140 --> 02:29:59,660
Activity cooking.

1213
02:30:03,180 --> 02:30:07,660
She burns everything. I wanted to frown on cooking.

1214
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:09,740
She doesn't like cooking.

1215
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:13,660
She likes fitness. She does like fitness a lot.

1216
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:16,860
Mischief.

1217
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:22,620
Painting. Video gaming.

1218
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:32,620
Yeah. Oh, there's different... I can add more? Purple.

1219
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:37,740
I didn't know I could do that for everybody.

1220
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:39,820
Damn it. It's fine.

1221
02:30:41,820 --> 02:30:42,460
Lullabies.

1222
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:51,740
I actually don't really know the music that Azura's into.

1223
02:30:54,060 --> 02:30:54,540
Romance.

1224
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:01,180
World.

1225
02:31:07,180 --> 02:31:08,780
Common little mama.

1226
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:15,500
Because he always says, shut up. Shut up. No.

1227
02:31:16,860 --> 02:31:21,100
Shut up about my... I don't always walk on my tiptoes.

1228
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:28,300
I usually walk on my tiptoes to be quiet or if I'm avoiding stepping on stuff in my messy house.

1229
02:31:30,620 --> 02:31:32,060
What don't you understand?

1230
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:34,460
Let's see.

1231
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:39,420
I'll make her a cup of boll.

1232
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:49,340
That's literally her though.

1233
02:31:53,900 --> 02:32:00,380
Who am I sneaking by? Yeah. My cat's boomy so he doesn't assassinate me.

1234
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:03,900
Let's do foodie because we all know she likes to whore people.

1235
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:08,380
Oh. Oh, shit. Architects are gonna love that.

1236
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,340
Put our maker a vegetarian.

1237
02:32:14,620 --> 02:32:16,380
And also make our family oriented.

1238
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:23,260
It's a snob. Oh, snob conflicts with goofball.

1239
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:29,340
Perfect. Perfect. A little similar to icy so I might change that.

1240
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:32,700
Or wait, was it mercy?

1241
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:45,500
Well, I think it changes for her because she's a teen. Okay. Yeah, it does.

1242
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:49,580
Let me fix. Let's continue with Azera. Hello. Hello.

1243
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:52,620
It was kind of a look for her.

1244
02:32:57,980 --> 02:33:00,300
Kind of want to change up her face a little bit.

1245
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:09,420
No.

1246
02:33:18,220 --> 02:33:18,940
Oh, my God.

1247
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:27,740
What is that? Why is her head so huge? Is she like?

1248
02:33:30,380 --> 02:33:32,860
I can't. You know what? I'm just gonna go back to what I had.

1249
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:41,340
Because that was the closest.

1250
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:51,020
Yeah, it gave her a straight five head.

1251
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:59,340
That was not it. Why are these? Is her head?

1252
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:06,140
Oh, actually that kind of helped. Because I don't know why her forehead was so like

1253
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:14,060
huge. It can make her head big. No. It's not what I wanted. Oh, no. I think I messed it up.

1254
02:34:14,860 --> 02:34:22,140
Oh, wait. No, it's fine. I think. I think that looks fine. Color Azera's eyes.

1255
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:24,220
There. I think they're orange. Yeah, they are.

1256
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:37,820
So it could be light. Actually, can I make them? Damn, I can't do like yellowish or anything.

1257
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:46,860
Strani gave us all orange eyes.

1258
02:34:52,060 --> 02:34:54,700
I still can't get rid of this freaking five head.

1259
02:34:55,660 --> 02:35:02,540
If I elongate her face, will that help? All right, let's do hair. This hair is pretty close.

1260
02:35:08,780 --> 02:35:14,300
Oh, this is literally her hair, though. Can I please make her forehead just smaller?

1261
02:35:14,300 --> 02:35:16,220
Why is her forehead so big?

1262
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:20,220
Bro.

1263
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:31,660
Please let me fix her forehead.

1264
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:39,740
All right, let's. I have to change her eyebrows, too, to just little circles.

1265
02:35:39,740 --> 02:35:50,380
I don't think there's anything like that in this. I give her no eyebrows.

1266
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:56,780
What is the difference between these no eyebrows and these no eyebrows? There's no difference.

1267
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:02,540
No, I hate it.

1268
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:09,020
I give her really thick eyebrows. No, I don't like it.

1269
02:36:10,140 --> 02:36:15,180
I kind of looks like it. Can I make them like.

1270
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:33,420
She looks perpetually surprised. Her hair seems like a helmet. I know. I just hate it.

1271
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:36,220
There's nothing better.

1272
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:50,940
What is that? I don't understand. Why does her head look like that? How do I fix it?

1273
02:36:54,220 --> 02:36:55,180
That's actually cute.

1274
02:36:58,540 --> 02:36:59,660
That looks like my all-in.

1275
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:13,020
Okay, all right, let's fix her eyebrows and make her eyes a little bit bigger.

1276
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:20,780
No, no, no, this is not what I wanted.

1277
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:41,020
All right, I guess that's fine. That's actually, she looks cute.

1278
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:47,740
All right, I can't fix the forehead. That's just goes as it's going to get.

1279
02:37:48,700 --> 02:37:51,660
It has to be as if my aunt is married.

1280
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:56,220
She could release an auntie.

1281
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:05,420
Is there a, all right, is there a, let's, let's, uh, let's work on that body.

1282
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:11,820
Give you a little bit more belly. Yeah, a little bit more thigh.

1283
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:17,420
Just, wait. Oh my God.

1284
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:23,580
When the thighs don't match the BBL.

1285
02:38:28,300 --> 02:38:29,740
Her look like muscular.

1286
02:38:29,740 --> 02:38:30,460
Whoa, Ben.

1287
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:33,500
Yeah.

1288
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:38,380
Chicken legs.

1289
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:43,580
Okay, her every day.

1290
02:38:56,780 --> 02:39:00,780
These are two very different outfits. Why are they so close to each other?

1291
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:13,260
Oh my God, literally cat woman, but it kind of works with the gloves.

1292
02:39:14,700 --> 02:39:16,620
I don't know why. It kind of just like,

1293
02:39:19,020 --> 02:39:20,940
kind of just like feels right.

1294
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:43,260
Let's see. There's nothing like flowy.

1295
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:52,860
Make that waist a little bit more snatched.

1296
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:58,140
She's thick, but she's still snatched ladies and gentlemen.

1297
02:40:01,020 --> 02:40:09,420
Damn, I kind of like that.

1298
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:11,580
Can I make it purple?

1299
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:17,420
No, that looks so ugly. Never mind.

1300
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:24,700
Let's give her a purple tracksuit.

1301
02:40:25,820 --> 02:40:28,460
It's Lulu, ladies and gentlemen. It's Lulu.

1302
02:40:31,180 --> 02:40:34,860
All these just make her look like an old woman and also my aunt.

1303
02:40:37,820 --> 02:40:41,340
Let me just, let me change the face shape a little bit.

1304
02:40:45,820 --> 02:40:52,060
No, no, no, no, no. No, what's up with this philtrum?

1305
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:59,340
Oh my God.

1306
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:07,980
I forgot to give Amy her like missing teeth. Hold on, let me do that.

1307
02:41:13,660 --> 02:41:16,620
Amy, show me your mouth. Open up your mouth, ma'am.

1308
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:22,700
Where do I do your teeth? I forget.

1309
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:36,940
Perfect. You get a, you get a cool gap. What is this? Oh, let's break braces.

1310
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:43,660
No, we'll do a cap. That looks terrifying, but it's fine.

1311
02:41:44,620 --> 02:41:46,940
Just don't, don't, don't open your mouth ever.

1312
02:41:55,340 --> 02:42:01,100
Gonna upload the household systems workshop. Why do you guys want me to? For what reason?

1313
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:11,180
How do I fix that? I don't like her mouth.

1314
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:34,380
Okay, I kind of liked what I had before.

1315
02:42:44,460 --> 02:42:53,820
That looks cute. Okay. That looks, not the outfit. Fuck the outfit. The outfit looks like trash.

1316
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:58,380
Is that a Zura? Yeah.

1317
02:43:04,540 --> 02:43:11,500
They're just gonna use it as a time for scientific purposes. Yeah, I'll do it. You guys can dress

1318
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:17,740
up, dress us up and make better mods. Let's see, can I please get rid of this outfit on you?

1319
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:22,060
Why does this actually fit her?

1320
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:35,420
Grandma ma'azu. I hate the makeup though. Care to the makeup.

1321
02:43:36,380 --> 02:43:45,580
It kind of works. It's kind of a vibe. Yeah, I think it's, yeah, the markings like the body.

1322
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:49,340
I think you're right. Oh wait, can I give her tattoos? That's right. I should be able to give her tattoos.

1323
02:43:55,180 --> 02:43:56,700
Where's the tattoos? Okay.

1324
02:43:57,020 --> 02:44:00,060
Ooh, sick.

1325
02:44:04,060 --> 02:44:07,340
No, no. Let's see.

1326
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:17,340
This high key makes me want to give myself tattoos. What? Why does that kind of work? That's really pretty.

1327
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:33,980
You can't even see that. Oh wait, can I get rid of, hold on, get rid of all the tattoos. I'll do like,

1328
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:39,100
they don't have face tattoos, trash.

1329
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:49,900
Is there a league tattoo? Probably. I think tribal would work for her.

1330
02:44:57,660 --> 02:45:03,020
I think that would kind of work. Ooh, that's actually cute. A little bit of henna moment.

1331
02:45:04,220 --> 02:45:09,420
I kind of like, I might go with that. I wish I could change the color to make it like a different

1332
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:15,020
color or whatever. What? Oh, can you give her a sims tattoo or a little heart?

1333
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:25,100
Can I do one on each arm? Oh, I can. Okay, that's kind of cool.

1334
02:45:27,420 --> 02:45:39,580
Ah, indeed. This kind of just looks like a goat. It looks kind of looks like a goofy deer,

1335
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:45,100
but I know it's not. I know it's like wings or a heart or whatever. I want to do that.

1336
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:50,940
Damn, she thick. Of course it's a zur. I got to make her thick.

1337
02:45:51,900 --> 02:46:00,220
Yeah, I think that fits the goddess theme. That's kind of sick too, to be honest. I like the chest

1338
02:46:00,220 --> 02:46:08,220
piece, subtle. I think that's like Romanian. I've seen like a Romanian tattoo artist have that sort

1339
02:46:08,220 --> 02:46:24,060
of style, I swear. That's me. Actually, no, I shaved my legs yesterday, but I only shaved

1340
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:32,540
like the bottom half on my leg. I was so lazy. Oh, I needed to put like a nicotine patch on

1341
02:46:32,540 --> 02:46:35,500
Strani. That's right. I was going to use one of these and put it as a nicotine patch

1342
02:46:39,660 --> 02:46:45,180
for her every day. You can't tell it's there. She's wearing no shoes.

1343
02:46:51,580 --> 02:46:52,620
Can I do body please?

1344
02:46:53,420 --> 02:47:01,340
Milka wearables. I need something that looks like a nicotine patch.

1345
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:06,380
Perfect.

1346
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:18,540
Perfect. Let's put another one on her belly.

1347
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:26,380
Actually, no, that doesn't work. I like it on her arm. Let's get rid of the port though.

1348
02:47:29,100 --> 02:47:30,460
I like it. Sick.

1349
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:42,460
Can you move them? I don't think so. Puts them everywhere.

1350
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:49,500
It's kind of works, guys. I don't know. Hold on. Let me...

1351
02:47:53,100 --> 02:47:56,940
Is there like... I'd prefer her in like pants though, rather than a skirt.

1352
02:47:59,340 --> 02:48:00,300
Or like some shorts.

1353
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:08,140
Some panties. That actually kind of goes.

1354
02:48:13,180 --> 02:48:16,780
Because you know how she has like her little thing in the front?

1355
02:48:24,220 --> 02:48:28,860
Yeah, that's her every day, guys. Can I make the tattoos purple? I don't think so.

1356
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:35,180
The snooze dip. Guys, stop asking what I'm gonna make those mods. It'll be like another time.

1357
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:40,540
Oh my god.

1358
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:46,700
I kind of like that. It's kind of a look. That's it, guys.

1359
02:48:48,620 --> 02:48:52,540
Yeah, I'm looking at her current outfit. Okay, and she's wearing like...

1360
02:49:05,660 --> 02:49:15,900
She wears like light socks. Well, she wears purple ones.

1361
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:24,220
Yeah, she wears purple thigh highs. Can I make them?

1362
02:49:31,900 --> 02:49:32,940
Or maybe I can do...

1363
02:49:36,140 --> 02:49:44,860
That actually kind of works, but we want to... I want her to remain sultry.

1364
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:57,980
Because I want her toes out, so I'm not gonna do that. Yeah, we'll just keep them like that.

1365
02:49:58,540 --> 02:50:07,500
Yeah, I don't know because like I like it because it works, but like if it wasn't the right color.

1366
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:18,380
But they don't have the right color, which is annoying. These ones kind of work, but...

1367
02:50:18,380 --> 02:50:28,060
That does look stupid. Okay, let's get rid of those. Hello.

1368
02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:32,220
What do you think, bleeding heart? She's kind of mommy.

1369
02:50:34,460 --> 02:50:44,540
Damn, mama. Damn. Oh my god. Okay, four more. What is this?

1370
02:50:48,460 --> 02:50:57,020
I wanted this for Isara, for formal. It's kind of sick.

1371
02:51:01,980 --> 02:51:04,060
Put her in a cutesy tracksuit.

1372
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:17,100
Actually, I like that more because that matches her hair.

1373
02:51:19,100 --> 02:51:24,780
As a bleeding heart would. And then for her...

1374
02:51:29,420 --> 02:51:30,780
Probably nothing.

1375
02:51:33,740 --> 02:51:41,020
I actually could see her in the bathrobe because that goes with her hair color. Let me get rid of her shoes.

1376
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:52,780
I kind of like that. Can I get it better? I know there's a different towel.

1377
02:51:53,420 --> 02:51:58,700
Oh my god, that would actually work. She just sleeps because she's always walking around.

1378
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:03,260
Wait, no, I'll do that for her bathing suit. Can I do that for her bathing suit? I don't know.

1379
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:04,860
I'll try to do it for her bathing suit.

1380
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:10,780
Okay, that one's a shorter one.

1381
02:52:14,540 --> 02:52:20,300
I kind of... Because you know, her outfit, her loading screen, her bedroom, you know?

1382
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:23,740
Wait, I'm going to see if I can do that for her.

1383
02:52:26,700 --> 02:52:31,100
Okay, yep, that's her bathing suit. And this will be her sleepwear.

1384
02:52:32,060 --> 02:52:38,060
Why is this kind of a fit? Oh my god.

1385
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:44,620
Bruh. It doesn't make sense that she's wearing it.

1386
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:51,180
So I'm going to change that, but like, say, um, gheat.

1387
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:54,700
Oh my god.

1388
02:53:01,100 --> 02:53:06,380
Oh my god, it's sneezing close to the thing.

1389
02:53:10,460 --> 02:53:15,180
I wanted to see this on her. No, I don't like any of these for the party.

1390
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:19,100
Uh, let's do full body party.

1391
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:31,660
No. That's actually cute. She looks very mythical.

1392
02:53:38,140 --> 02:53:42,460
Put her in that. Oh my god.

1393
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:47,580
Wait, are there different colors for this?

1394
02:53:51,340 --> 02:53:55,740
This is cute. She looks so good.

1395
02:53:59,500 --> 02:54:01,260
I kind of like it though.

1396
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:06,140
She looks so classy.

1397
02:54:07,100 --> 02:54:12,380
I think I might give her that.

1398
02:54:16,140 --> 02:54:20,860
The neutrals in her hair. I think I like the gray version the most.

1399
02:54:21,900 --> 02:54:25,740
I kind of like, she's like casual comfy because you know, Zara's comfy.

1400
02:54:26,700 --> 02:54:33,820
Azura rocks it. God damn. Look at her titties, bro. I'm kind of feeling it.

1401
02:54:37,100 --> 02:54:40,860
So it's either like that, but that looks really nice for a party though.

1402
02:54:43,340 --> 02:54:44,300
Maybe I'll do this.

1403
02:54:46,940 --> 02:54:50,380
I'll do that one for the cold weather. I'll do that for cold weather.

1404
02:54:50,380 --> 02:54:54,060
She wears that for cold weather. That's what I'll do. That makes sense.

1405
02:54:56,220 --> 02:54:57,180
What the heck is that outfit?

1406
02:55:02,700 --> 02:55:10,540
That looks, that looks so uncoated. Get these stupid things off her. Get them off.

1407
02:55:12,780 --> 02:55:16,380
Take, why is she wearing these? Get them off her face.

1408
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:22,620
The necklace. I don't even know why the necklace is there.

1409
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:26,140
I don't know how to get the necklace off.

1410
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:33,660
How the heck is there a necklace on her and I can't take it off? Is that part of the outfit?

1411
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:45,980
Azura's serving. She truly is. Oh, getting married to Azura. Sorry, this is cold weather

1412
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:48,060
outfits. What am I doing? That's cute too.

1413
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:58,700
Oh my God, I forgot about this though. That'll be her hot weather outfit.

1414
02:55:59,660 --> 02:56:01,740
Or maybe that will be her party outfit.

1415
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:12,140
Guys, Azura can rock anything. I don't know what to do.

1416
02:56:12,700 --> 02:56:20,780
She's so, like, she just eats. Oh my God, the corset back.

1417
02:56:24,460 --> 02:56:25,420
That's humans.

1418
02:56:31,580 --> 02:56:31,900
Okay.

1419
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:38,620
I don't like the necklace. How do I get rid of the necklace? What if I?

1420
02:56:42,140 --> 02:56:53,100
Cold weather outfit, folks.

1421
02:56:57,420 --> 02:56:58,860
Oh, actually, wait.

1422
02:57:02,460 --> 02:57:11,820
Hold on, folks. She kind of rocks this though. Virgin slayer outfit. Oh my God, bro.

1423
02:57:12,700 --> 02:57:22,540
Guys, I, yeah, I just hold on. Let me fix her freaking shoes. Oh my God, guys.

1424
02:57:23,900 --> 02:57:24,300
Guys.

1425
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:30,860
Guys, not the Uggs. Not the Uggs. Get rid of those Uggs. No way.

1426
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:41,740
That's the one. This is the one, boys. I think that's the one. Okay. I didn't do her hot weather

1427
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:43,900
outfit though. No, we don't want the...

1428
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:52,540
That looks, again, like one of my aunties in that freaking outfit.

1429
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:56,540
That cat food's going off.

1430
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:03,420
Who would dispenser my beloved?

1431
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:07,820
Yeah, you've technically seen her in that sweater.

1432
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:12,060
Don't worry, Fia. I'll feed you after I make myself.

1433
02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:18,460
Oh, actually, wait.

1434
02:58:21,580 --> 02:58:22,700
I kind of like this undress.

1435
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:34,140
Rock angel. Why can't Azura just like eat anything? She just served. She left no crumbs, bro.

1436
02:58:37,820 --> 02:58:46,380
Full body hot weather outfit. Okay, hold on. Let's just...

1437
02:58:50,140 --> 02:58:51,580
I need to get rid of this.

1438
02:58:51,900 --> 02:58:52,380
Yes.

1439
02:59:02,060 --> 02:59:02,380
No.

1440
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:06,780
What are they? These are...

1441
02:59:09,260 --> 02:59:12,220
She looks cute in that. Even she's the only one that could rock the hat.

1442
02:59:16,460 --> 02:59:20,940
Oh, queen? Azurian glasses?

1443
02:59:21,580 --> 02:59:22,540
Yep, got it.

1444
02:59:28,060 --> 02:59:29,900
This is for hours until it returns.

1445
02:59:34,620 --> 02:59:39,660
I like... Yeah, I like the shoes. Let me see if I can change the color of the dress.

1446
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:46,380
I don't like any of the colors for the dress.

1447
02:59:52,220 --> 02:59:59,340
Okay, maybe it's the makeup that's throwing me off. I'm like, nothing looks good. It's the makeup.

1448
03:00:03,260 --> 03:00:06,060
It's the beach episode, cowgirl.

1449
03:00:13,180 --> 03:00:16,940
Let's get rid of this hat. Although it is... Look, she rocks a hat, though.

1450
03:00:17,500 --> 03:00:25,580
I feel like this could be better. Sunglasses, you said?

1451
03:00:29,740 --> 03:00:33,260
That's kind of... That kind of rocks. She looks kind of badass.

1452
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:35,340
I just feel like there could be something better here.

1453
03:00:35,660 --> 03:00:45,260
I just feel like there could be something better.

1454
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:49,980
Oh, precisely. Literally, this is so much better.

1455
03:00:49,980 --> 03:00:52,780
What? Sick. What else do we got?

1456
03:01:01,580 --> 03:01:02,380
Also sick.

1457
03:01:05,340 --> 03:01:19,980
Actually, I think I like the pants the most. The jumpsuit.

1458
03:01:22,060 --> 03:01:23,820
I think I like the jumpsuit the most.

1459
03:01:27,260 --> 03:01:30,380
Another color. Oh, what would she look like with the hat with this, actually?

1460
03:01:30,540 --> 03:01:35,580
Wait, how do I get a hat?

1461
03:01:44,860 --> 03:01:49,100
No, I think that looks the best. She looks so cool. She's just like, yeah,

1462
03:01:49,100 --> 03:01:57,500
I'm ready to step out in the town. Oh my god. Wait, though. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1463
03:01:57,500 --> 03:02:05,980
wait. I feel like the hot dog the most. Guys, because you all know Azur from the south,

1464
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:11,580
so you know she got to rock that hat. You know she's going to rock it.

1465
03:02:14,460 --> 03:02:21,260
Save a horse ride a cowboy, am I right? Yee-haw. Yee-yee. Yee-yee.

1466
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:33,580
Yee-yee. Okay, so that, I actually think I like the cowboy hat. It's kind of a mood.

1467
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:43,500
That's cute. She's so fucking cute. Oh my god. All right, I think that's Azur, guys. I think that's

1468
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:51,580
Azur. I think that's Azur. I think we're moving on to me.

1469
03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:09,260
And there I am. There I am, everybody.

1470
03:03:09,980 --> 03:03:17,420
Azur. I don't know how it can get better than this.

1471
03:03:26,460 --> 03:03:29,340
They got that. I didn't even need to randomize or anything.

1472
03:03:30,140 --> 03:03:35,580
Hello, my name is Sheeby Cottonbomb. Can I get it? Yeah, like, damn.

1473
03:03:41,900 --> 03:03:47,580
Yep. Wait, what is this? Oh.

1474
03:03:47,740 --> 03:03:49,740
Oh.

1475
03:03:55,180 --> 03:03:58,540
What? I can change everybody's sexual orientation?

1476
03:04:01,420 --> 03:04:02,780
What? Can I make us okay?

1477
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:03,980
Okay.

1478
03:04:15,020 --> 03:04:17,500
This sim feels jealous of any romantic parties.

1479
03:04:17,500 --> 03:04:31,820
Why are there romantic boundaries in the sims? I...

1480
03:04:31,820 --> 03:04:47,740
Well, I think they're all default checked off, yes, so that's fine.

1481
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:52,140
Yeah, okay.

1482
03:04:53,020 --> 03:04:57,260
This is Azur.

1483
03:05:00,380 --> 03:05:05,420
Still look behind this crazy DLC. Okay, let me just try to find myself.

1484
03:05:09,580 --> 03:05:11,260
If it's a fwima.

1485
03:05:11,580 --> 03:05:13,580
Yeah.

1486
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:20,460
No. What is that hair?

1487
03:05:23,820 --> 03:05:25,500
Why is this Taylor Swift?

1488
03:05:30,380 --> 03:05:35,180
With locks, bro. Why is this Taylor Swift with locks?

1489
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:42,140
I can't.

1490
03:05:45,900 --> 03:05:47,740
No, what is happening?

1491
03:05:52,380 --> 03:05:54,140
Oh my god, you look like a predator.

1492
03:05:57,260 --> 03:06:06,780
Oh, Miba Shaila. You know what? No, I don't resonate with that face.

1493
03:06:11,580 --> 03:06:11,820
Oh.

1494
03:06:16,460 --> 03:06:19,100
No, I get closer and it gets bad.

1495
03:06:27,340 --> 03:06:28,220
Fia's being cute.

1496
03:06:34,380 --> 03:06:37,580
Again, this looks like Taylor Swift, except she's Gyaru.

1497
03:06:38,540 --> 03:06:39,580
I don't...

1498
03:06:41,820 --> 03:06:43,020
I'm a little bit thicker.

1499
03:06:51,100 --> 03:06:59,820
Okay, I'm... I can work with that. Let me change the chin. Let's change the skin tone.

1500
03:07:07,820 --> 03:07:13,900
Okay, all right.

1501
03:07:15,180 --> 03:07:16,460
Since Ronnie's hair be pink.

1502
03:07:18,300 --> 03:07:20,700
Yeah, but she's green woman, so her hair is green.

1503
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:31,820
Okay, you know what? Hold on. Let me check what her hair would look like with pink.

1504
03:07:37,820 --> 03:07:40,140
Does that look right to you?

1505
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:46,460
I don't think so. Actually, I think Emmy's hair color should be more like this.

1506
03:07:47,180 --> 03:07:51,020
Actually, or is that my hair color? And my hair color is more like this now.

1507
03:07:54,620 --> 03:07:57,420
But Emmy's hair in her model is just like very orange though.

1508
03:07:57,900 --> 03:08:06,620
His lips are huge because she's got DSL.

1509
03:08:10,060 --> 03:08:12,860
So, maybe make them smaller. She's got little pouty lips.

1510
03:08:23,180 --> 03:08:24,060
That actually looks better.

1511
03:08:28,380 --> 03:08:34,940
I can't... No, you can't do two tones.

1512
03:08:39,420 --> 03:08:42,140
Let me make my mouth a little bit smaller.

1513
03:08:45,740 --> 03:08:49,820
My eyes need to be a little closer together.

1514
03:08:51,980 --> 03:08:54,060
You can't... I can't put them closer together.

1515
03:08:54,540 --> 03:09:02,540
There we go. Hair. There's not going to be drills. I don't...

1516
03:09:09,740 --> 03:09:13,180
Yeah, my hair's pretty white and my eyes are red. Although, I could make them blue.

1517
03:09:13,900 --> 03:09:16,860
Oh, that's not my hair. My eyes...

1518
03:09:20,060 --> 03:09:21,500
God, give me gross.

1519
03:09:24,060 --> 03:09:29,900
Because I couldn't make my eyes blue now if I wanted to.

1520
03:09:36,140 --> 03:09:43,100
Or I can make them red. The red looks better. I look old by now, but it's fine.

1521
03:09:48,220 --> 03:09:52,620
This is face reveal. Yeah, guys, this is me. This is exactly what I look like in person.

1522
03:09:54,620 --> 03:10:04,220
Let me put... Give myself some makeup. Give myself some eyeliner like straw knees.

1523
03:10:11,100 --> 03:10:15,340
Here's a G. Cocho, you're a lie.

1524
03:10:17,580 --> 03:10:21,900
When blue, I had people look at you. Let's give a little bit of a...

1525
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:26,380
You know, I don't really like glossy like that. I don't like the two-tone.

1526
03:10:26,380 --> 03:10:28,380
Where is the lip I gave straw knee?

1527
03:10:32,060 --> 03:10:36,060
I don't know where it went. I do like the diffused lip. The diffused lip is nice.

1528
03:10:38,060 --> 03:10:42,700
Here it is. I actually do usually like... If I wear a lipstick, I do do like the kind of like the

1529
03:10:43,660 --> 03:10:52,860
K Korean style. Let's do like a soft pink. Actually, I think red would probably be the

1530
03:10:55,420 --> 03:10:56,300
most accurate.

1531
03:11:00,460 --> 03:11:00,860
Do you?

1532
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:08,940
Nope, nope, nope, nope. Let's keep the hue what it was. Let's let's put it back.

1533
03:11:08,940 --> 03:11:13,660
What is this? Capacity?

1534
03:11:16,140 --> 03:11:19,420
Yeah. Put a little blush.

1535
03:11:23,340 --> 03:11:25,740
Hold on. Let me put on my actual face.

1536
03:11:26,460 --> 03:11:35,900
Yeah, that's me guys. Yeah, that looks about right.

1537
03:11:39,580 --> 03:11:42,700
Wait, what's the... What is this?

1538
03:11:45,420 --> 03:11:47,900
Oh, there's contour? What the hell?

1539
03:11:48,860 --> 03:11:52,540
Bro, I'm contouring my face. Don't mind if I do.

1540
03:11:53,980 --> 03:11:58,860
I look like such a girly girl. What is up with that? Let me change my nose.

1541
03:12:02,620 --> 03:12:07,420
Boomi, hello, how can I help you sir? You can't lay on my keyboard. He's staring at my sim.

1542
03:12:07,580 --> 03:12:18,380
Can I... What the heck happened? I don't know what just happened.

1543
03:12:25,260 --> 03:12:29,580
Projecting my own face onto this. Although, no, it honestly looks nothing like me, but you know.

1544
03:12:38,220 --> 03:12:48,220
I need some boy. You smell like camp food. Oh, squeezed a pouch. Don't mind if I do.

1545
03:12:53,500 --> 03:13:03,340
He's staring at him. Okay, that looks pretty... Yeah. I feel like I need to be like more darker.

1546
03:13:08,300 --> 03:13:17,020
Like my eyebrows. Because my eyebrows are black and they're thin. Oh yeah, there you go.

1547
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:20,460
That's pretty cute. All right.

1548
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:26,860
I will be adding a beauty mark.

1549
03:13:27,740 --> 03:13:31,740
Yep.

1550
03:13:33,260 --> 03:13:40,620
What is this? No, I don't have that. What is this? Black lines? Damn.

1551
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:47,020
Oh, little Marilyn Monroe moment.

1552
03:13:51,980 --> 03:13:56,620
What is this? Oh my god, these... I actually have freckles like this on my face.

1553
03:13:56,620 --> 03:14:04,700
That's really cute. I'll take those off though. Oh, I already clicked that. Give my head forehead

1554
03:14:04,700 --> 03:14:14,140
wrinkles. Okay, hold on. We got to go back to this, guys. Ew, hold on. Let me just fix the outfit just

1555
03:14:14,140 --> 03:14:23,420
real quick. Because I can't stay until... What the heck? That was not there before. Where'd it go?

1556
03:14:24,220 --> 03:14:31,260
Did you guys see that split second of something else? What the heck?

1557
03:14:41,020 --> 03:14:42,220
That looks so stupid.

1558
03:14:47,740 --> 03:14:51,820
Perfect. I look like what's her face from... I don't even know.

1559
03:14:51,820 --> 03:14:54,220
We'll keep that on for now while I do this.

1560
03:14:57,900 --> 03:15:00,540
Ew, I can't stand to look at it though. The makeup is bad.

1561
03:15:03,580 --> 03:15:05,020
My aspiration...

1562
03:15:09,180 --> 03:15:11,260
Friendships faster. Fortune.

1563
03:15:12,700 --> 03:15:16,620
Deviants. What do you guys think mine would be? Knowledge. Knowledge.

1564
03:15:17,580 --> 03:15:22,220
Fam... Nah, we know. Family's only with cat. Deviants?

1565
03:15:25,740 --> 03:15:27,020
You guys say deviants?

1566
03:15:31,100 --> 03:15:35,020
Popular... Let me see. What are the popularity ones? Oh, snap.

1567
03:15:37,500 --> 03:15:42,060
Be a positive influence. Become a famous comedian.

1568
03:15:46,700 --> 03:15:51,500
I do want to make a lot of friends. Maybe I want to make a lot of famous comedians.

1569
03:15:53,660 --> 03:15:57,660
Real estate. Well, I can't... That's like... Because I can't...

1570
03:15:59,260 --> 03:16:03,420
Let me see. What's under fortune? Fabulously wealthy.

1571
03:16:05,580 --> 03:16:11,500
Owning the biggest fanciest home. I already... Owning Wonderland, I guess.

1572
03:16:11,900 --> 03:16:19,420
Knowledge. Peter Wiz. Renaissance. Nerd brain. I think?

1573
03:16:22,780 --> 03:16:25,580
Joke star. Let's do that. Let's do joke star.

1574
03:16:29,020 --> 03:16:31,980
Yeah, I like that. Why do I look like Nicki Minaj?

1575
03:16:34,140 --> 03:16:40,620
Let's see. What are my likes? I like to cook comedy naturally. I like all of these things.

1576
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:43,420
Oh, let's do gardening. Mischief.

1577
03:16:45,580 --> 03:16:51,580
A video gaming writing. Yeah. Wait, hold on. I need to do more. Favorite color? Red.

1578
03:16:56,380 --> 03:17:00,780
Oh my god. Oh my god, my voice is annoying. Hold on. Let me change my walk.

1579
03:17:10,620 --> 03:17:16,300
Swagger walk. Thank you.

1580
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:22,780
The popcorn. I've only burnt popcorn. That was the first time I've ever burnt popcorn in my life, bro.

1581
03:17:34,700 --> 03:17:35,200
Ew.

1582
03:17:40,620 --> 03:17:51,100
Narskosmiva, huh? Holy nine, Mokosa. Holy nine, Mokosa. Holy nine, Krupova.

1583
03:17:54,460 --> 03:17:56,300
Uh, what's the...

1584
03:18:00,140 --> 03:18:00,640
No.

1585
03:18:03,020 --> 03:18:03,520
No.

1586
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:08,480
Wistedib-sarpava. A-wistedib-sarpava. Yeah, that's me.

1587
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:22,000
A-banzan-a-satorb. I think my voice is a little bit higher.

1588
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:37,280
And a prep kid-off.

1589
03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:44,800
Why is it a valley girl? Because I don't know. Sometimes I do a valley girl voice.

1590
03:18:48,880 --> 03:18:50,560
Holy nine, Mokosa.

1591
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:56,960
Guys, I can't find my voice again.

1592
03:18:59,040 --> 03:18:59,840
I'm not that deep.

1593
03:19:00,720 --> 03:19:03,280
I'll make the... Yeah, I'm in the center. All right.

1594
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:16,080
Music genre. Let's do alternative electronica, hip-hop. Pop. Spooky.

1595
03:19:16,800 --> 03:19:18,000
Yeah.

1596
03:19:21,840 --> 03:19:25,600
Hates children. Bro, naturally.

1597
03:19:29,600 --> 03:19:32,960
Yeah, Marchand Clazoi.

1598
03:19:36,160 --> 03:19:38,400
Yes, yes, I'll do that. The discovered.

1599
03:19:41,520 --> 03:19:42,160
Let's see.

1600
03:19:42,160 --> 03:19:47,760
All right, you guys can pick the... Actually, no, I'm a bookworm.

1601
03:19:51,280 --> 03:19:52,320
I should be a klepto.

1602
03:19:55,600 --> 03:19:56,560
I should be a slob.

1603
03:19:58,800 --> 03:20:02,640
Guys, I don't know what to do for the other ones. Should I be a snob?

1604
03:20:03,600 --> 03:20:07,600
Mean.

1605
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:15,920
Do me? You want me to be mean?

1606
03:20:18,960 --> 03:20:20,960
I'm not evil. I'm an evil bro.

1607
03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:31,200
Clumsy geek and glutton. How am I to glutton?

1608
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:38,800
Non-committal. No, I don't like that.

1609
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:45,440
I snack every stream. That doesn't make me a glutton.

1610
03:20:47,520 --> 03:20:53,440
You dicks. I just like to eat with you because you remind me when to eat.

1611
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:56,960
Clumsy. That's accurate.

1612
03:20:58,960 --> 03:21:01,760
Who is calling me? I don't recognize that.

1613
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:05,360
Uh, clumsy.

1614
03:21:16,800 --> 03:21:18,240
Hates children.

1615
03:21:21,280 --> 03:21:23,360
All right, you guys can pick the last one.

1616
03:21:23,360 --> 03:21:32,160
Food hacks. You're like, yeah, I eat every day.

1617
03:21:37,040 --> 03:21:39,760
I usually forget to eat. That doesn't make me a glutton.

1618
03:21:44,160 --> 03:21:49,360
All right, you guys can pick the last one for me. So I'll go through them.

1619
03:21:53,360 --> 03:22:09,360
Perfectionist. Perfectionist.

1620
03:22:11,120 --> 03:22:14,480
Back to back. Perfectionist. Genius. Incorrect.

1621
03:22:17,440 --> 03:22:21,840
I think I will put perfectionist. I'm a clumsy, but I'm a perfectionist.

1622
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:31,360
Good fall.

1623
03:22:42,800 --> 03:22:47,200
No, actually, this is laugh at failure instead of becoming upset. That's incorrect.

1624
03:22:49,040 --> 03:22:50,640
I'll do goofball instead.

1625
03:22:53,680 --> 03:22:56,320
Kang. No, Kang.

1626
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:08,640
It may needs the perfectionist tag. Maybe. I'll see. I think I should be able to pick it

1627
03:23:08,640 --> 03:23:17,040
when she ages up. It sounds so bad. Can I fix my face?

1628
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:30,400
Can I please take off that makeup? It looks terrible.

1629
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:36,960
That's not the makeup I had on before.

1630
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:45,040
Oh, wait, put the bag.

1631
03:23:53,360 --> 03:24:11,040
Oh, that's you.

1632
03:24:23,680 --> 03:24:35,040
Can I take your glasses off, please? Okay, let's let's do hair.

1633
03:24:40,160 --> 03:24:40,560
Actually,

1634
03:24:40,720 --> 03:24:50,240
I said nobody looked at me like that.

1635
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:58,320
What is the difference between these two that's bumped out really?

1636
03:24:58,320 --> 03:25:03,520
You're going to waste a slot like that. This is the, oh, actually, that may work,

1637
03:25:03,520 --> 03:25:07,680
but I don't like how it looked. Oh, no, never mind. Why is it a freaking bob in the back?

1638
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:12,720
B.O.B., so they call a new bob?

1639
03:25:20,800 --> 03:25:24,240
I actually don't like how this looks. Why does my nose look like that?

1640
03:25:25,120 --> 03:25:35,680
Okay, myself a white woman nose.

1641
03:25:38,880 --> 03:25:43,040
My dad said I had a white woman nose the other day, and I'm like, that's not true,

1642
03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:48,720
because I have a little button nose, but it's not pointy like my mother's.

1643
03:25:48,720 --> 03:25:53,760
So I'm like, what are you talking about? I'm like, dad, that's not nice.

1644
03:25:53,760 --> 03:25:54,800
Can't believe you just say that to me.

1645
03:25:57,920 --> 03:25:58,480
What did you say?

1646
03:26:04,160 --> 03:26:06,720
Nose reveal when? Never.

1647
03:26:09,840 --> 03:26:13,920
It does look nice from far away, and it's not like we're going to be up and close to the

1648
03:26:13,920 --> 03:26:18,320
Sims all the time. So actually, I think I'll do that. I think I'll do that hair.

1649
03:26:19,120 --> 03:26:21,360
What? Is there eye shadow on?

1650
03:26:27,680 --> 03:26:30,800
Is there eye shadow on? No? Okay, because I'm like, what the hell?

1651
03:26:31,040 --> 03:26:40,160
I wish I could give myself bunny ears. That would be great.

1652
03:26:44,080 --> 03:26:48,960
All right, let's get into it, guys. Every day outfit. Let's find out.

1653
03:26:49,360 --> 03:26:57,280
Teachers bit. So it would be like a suit outfit.

1654
03:27:01,040 --> 03:27:07,360
Is there like a suit? That's cute. Actually, let me fix my body type real quick.

1655
03:27:07,360 --> 03:27:09,040
Let me throw in a bathing suit and do that.

1656
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:24,160
Oh, that's fine. Huge. Not as big as Azura's though, but big. Snatch. Thighs are fine.

1657
03:27:26,880 --> 03:27:29,840
All right, that's good. Okay, sets.

1658
03:27:33,760 --> 03:27:36,880
Why do I look like I'm going to like... That looks so weird.

1659
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:47,840
That actually looks kind of cute. Let me find jumpsuits. Yeah.

1660
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:53,040
Oh, nobody look. Nobody look at me.

1661
03:27:56,000 --> 03:28:03,680
Can I find like a top jacket? I just need like a suit jacket. Can I please have a

1662
03:28:04,640 --> 03:28:10,080
button up? No, that's not it. Suit jacket.

1663
03:28:12,800 --> 03:28:14,720
This definitely like makes me look like a mom.

1664
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:19,360
This definitely makes me look like a mom.

1665
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:24,320
Can wear a jacket over a bra. That's a great question.

1666
03:28:25,200 --> 03:28:33,280
Okay, I feel like my poops need to be bigger.

1667
03:28:40,320 --> 03:28:44,560
This is this is definitely mommy. Let me get myself a skirt.

1668
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:49,920
I can't tell if I like this one or that. Actually, I like the shorter one.

1669
03:28:50,240 --> 03:28:59,680
Yeah. Oh, hello. Can I just wear this?

1670
03:29:07,440 --> 03:29:10,880
Can I just wear that? Why are the shoulders so pointy?

1671
03:29:11,760 --> 03:29:19,760
Can I just wear that? Hold on. Actually, hold on. Hold on.

1672
03:29:28,240 --> 03:29:36,000
Hold on. Hold on. Work with me. Work with me. Work with me. Work with me.

1673
03:29:36,960 --> 03:29:40,160
Work with me, you guys. Hold on.

1674
03:29:42,720 --> 03:29:47,840
Just just hold on. Bear with me. I'm I'm I'm thinking.

1675
03:29:52,480 --> 03:29:56,240
It's it's coming to me.

1676
03:29:56,640 --> 03:30:06,160
I am cooking. Let me cook. Just just let me cook.

1677
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:11,280
Let it let the cooking happen.

1678
03:30:19,280 --> 03:30:21,280
Let the cooking happen.

1679
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:29,760
What is the difference between these two? Nothing. Oh, this is one have a line and one doesn't.

1680
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:37,520
That actually kind of works.

1681
03:30:40,880 --> 03:30:46,560
Let's do my fingernails. No, I don't like the multiple colors.

1682
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:55,040
Can I have like normally colored fingernails? Why are these both the same thing? Oh, one's matte,

1683
03:30:55,040 --> 03:31:04,480
one's not. Can I just have all red fingernails? What the hell is that?

1684
03:31:09,760 --> 03:31:15,520
That looks kind of weird, but I want longer fingernails. Why is this kind of cute though?

1685
03:31:17,520 --> 03:31:24,640
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'm kind of feeling this. Oh, is this the right one? Here it is. There we go.

1686
03:31:26,960 --> 03:31:30,640
Perfect. Yeah, get those red.

1687
03:31:33,520 --> 03:31:35,520
Is there like a short skirt I can wear?

1688
03:31:47,440 --> 03:31:53,840
Why? I could have sworn there was more short skirts. What happened to them all?

1689
03:31:59,360 --> 03:32:00,400
That's weird. I could have.

1690
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:06,080
Where did the skirts go? There was more skirts than this.

1691
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:14,880
Oh, I didn't even press that. That looks stupid. Not the clashing patterns.

1692
03:32:16,640 --> 03:32:20,880
I think that's going to be it. Let me see if I can...

1693
03:32:24,320 --> 03:32:25,600
Can I? What if I'm like...

1694
03:32:30,560 --> 03:32:31,920
Wait a second.

1695
03:32:31,920 --> 03:32:50,480
Wait. I kind of like the red. The red one does kind of eat them. Oh wait. Sorry, I'm snapping.

1696
03:32:50,560 --> 03:32:58,000
I think I like the red.

1697
03:33:01,440 --> 03:33:06,400
Okay, let's go with that. I'm just wearing panties and that's it. This is my outfit.

1698
03:33:06,400 --> 03:33:13,040
That's what I wear. Okay. Formal. What is this? That's ugly.

1699
03:33:20,800 --> 03:33:22,720
I just wear it like... I just add pants.

1700
03:33:26,880 --> 03:33:27,760
Ooh, the makeup's nice.

1701
03:33:32,560 --> 03:33:34,080
That's a little bit much.

1702
03:33:41,120 --> 03:33:46,800
Why does this kind of fucking look sick on me though? It is a Jessica Rabbit dress. That's true.

1703
03:33:50,640 --> 03:33:54,480
It is Jessica Rabbit-y.

1704
03:33:58,960 --> 03:34:01,600
Where'd it go? All I have is the dude ones.

1705
03:34:04,640 --> 03:34:07,440
Okay, let me look. Let's look at some more full-body dresses.

1706
03:34:08,320 --> 03:34:14,960
Because there's that, but there's also this. Oh. Holy moly.

1707
03:34:15,440 --> 03:34:24,720
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way. It sounded like Meg Gara.

1708
03:34:29,680 --> 03:34:32,240
Yeah, that one needs booba support, bro. I kind of want to get...

1709
03:34:36,160 --> 03:34:42,640
Give me a flat tummy. Kind of. Kind of eats, guys. I think that's it.

1710
03:34:43,360 --> 03:34:46,640
Full-body athletic.

1711
03:34:48,560 --> 03:34:53,920
A few stylized looks. Trying to think of... I usually just wear something like this,

1712
03:34:53,920 --> 03:35:01,360
to honest, when I go to the gym. Kind of works. Is there like a red version?

1713
03:35:08,400 --> 03:35:09,200
Where's the shirt?

1714
03:35:09,200 --> 03:35:14,800
Where's the shirt? Is it selected? I can't tell.

1715
03:35:19,440 --> 03:35:28,800
I wish if I clicked on the shirt, it would just show the shirt at the freaking top.

1716
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:41,920
I don't like that.

1717
03:35:45,120 --> 03:35:48,640
Is there like a red? No, it's only pink. Give me red.

1718
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:54,640
But it doesn't look good. What about this red?

1719
03:35:57,440 --> 03:35:58,800
Damn, curvy as fuck.

1720
03:35:58,800 --> 03:36:08,800
F the leggings.

1721
03:36:13,840 --> 03:36:17,680
Where those fishnets go? I just throw fishnets on me. I don't care about that.

1722
03:36:17,680 --> 03:36:27,200
I'm getting a... yeah. Working on Madem. They're better shorts.

1723
03:36:34,160 --> 03:36:35,120
Is everything pink?

1724
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:47,440
There's like different shades of red and it looks stupid. I have like cartoon

1725
03:36:47,440 --> 03:36:52,160
character proportions. Don't worry about that. Give myself an America.

1726
03:36:54,160 --> 03:36:57,760
I kind of like the America shirt. Oh wait.

1727
03:37:00,160 --> 03:37:02,480
That kind of works. Can I give myself black shorts instead then?

1728
03:37:03,040 --> 03:37:12,640
It's like a reverse of my normal outfit. Black. Or black?

1729
03:37:18,880 --> 03:37:19,600
Can I just like...

1730
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:28,240
I just exercise in panties. Skin tight.

1731
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:33,840
Those are just skinny jeans. What?

1732
03:37:38,080 --> 03:37:42,880
This is how I exercise, boys. So let's throw some leggings on.

1733
03:37:45,280 --> 03:37:50,720
What is that? I'm sort of sick. All right, let's put on some nice sneakers. Perfect.

1734
03:37:50,720 --> 03:38:01,360
I'm looking for the right shade of red and I can't find it.

1735
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:05,280
That's going to bother me.

1736
03:38:11,280 --> 03:38:15,840
I don't even think I'm going to play the game today because I stream at three hours

1737
03:38:15,840 --> 03:38:21,360
doing the Gunpla for members. I like how it's taken me so long to do this.

1738
03:38:24,880 --> 03:38:28,400
I have to take a break also because I'm getting a headache. So I don't want to have a...

1739
03:38:28,400 --> 03:38:32,480
I don't want to have to cancel the members stream. All right, that's cute.

1740
03:38:37,360 --> 03:38:40,080
Kind of a look but not what we're going for.

1741
03:38:46,160 --> 03:38:46,960
There we go.

1742
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:56,480
Oh, we love it. Hold on.

1743
03:38:56,800 --> 03:39:16,400
This is what I sleep in on the daily. Hold on, I might do the reverse of this outfit.

1744
03:39:17,680 --> 03:39:20,400
This is so it goes with the black butter. Yeah, looks cool.

1745
03:39:20,560 --> 03:39:25,760
It looks kind of nice and then look and then naturally

1746
03:39:28,240 --> 03:39:35,600
got to do the bunny slippers. Does that make them black bunnies? I like the white. It's just like

1747
03:39:35,600 --> 03:39:44,400
random. Bye bye. I love the other dress in a press collab. I want to play the game so bad.

1748
03:39:44,880 --> 03:39:46,400
Um, cool.

1749
03:39:48,960 --> 03:39:56,400
It's kind of a look. Nice party. Why is this such a freaking cute outfit?

1750
03:39:59,360 --> 03:40:03,760
Hello? It's not what I want though. We're going to do a stylized look.

1751
03:40:06,480 --> 03:40:10,560
Or just a bunch of dude outfits. I should probably wear the cougar outfit.

1752
03:40:14,800 --> 03:40:18,000
No, I just want to do that one character from Hoony Pop.

1753
03:40:26,400 --> 03:40:27,520
Oh, that actually is cute.

1754
03:40:33,520 --> 03:40:36,880
It's kind of cute. It's kind of a look. Jessica.

1755
03:40:44,400 --> 03:40:50,880
I kind of like this better.

1756
03:40:52,960 --> 03:40:58,080
No, that kind of looks too mommy because like I'm a hot mom, you know.

1757
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:04,720
Perfect. I think that's great. Can I get that in red though?

1758
03:41:04,880 --> 03:41:11,040
Close enough. Love to see it.

1759
03:41:13,360 --> 03:41:15,040
Can I wear lingerie to a party?

1760
03:41:17,760 --> 03:41:20,000
Hey, what type of party are we having?

1761
03:41:23,440 --> 03:41:27,680
This is very cute on me too. Looks good on me and Azura.

1762
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:33,680
Uh-huh. No, I would not wear that to a party.

1763
03:41:35,200 --> 03:41:38,240
You will not catch dead. I'm mad I'm wearing that to a party.

1764
03:41:39,280 --> 03:41:46,080
Let me look at dresses. Trying to find all the dresses.

1765
03:41:49,040 --> 03:41:50,800
It's really cool that I have a gunbook.

1766
03:41:50,800 --> 03:41:59,440
Um, a little basic. That's a little cute. Can I see a red version?

1767
03:42:01,760 --> 03:42:04,880
Not feeling it too much. I don't like the stripes.

1768
03:42:07,200 --> 03:42:13,120
Oh, is this in red? Damn, if that was in red, that would have been perfect. It's not in red.

1769
03:42:16,720 --> 03:42:18,560
All right, we'll go with the OG.

1770
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:27,200
Yeah, me and Marcy can wear the same dress in different colors.

1771
03:42:28,560 --> 03:42:32,480
Oh, snap. Uh, let me change the color of this top and I'll actually do that.

1772
03:42:34,800 --> 03:42:37,920
Let's do black. That's not black. That's like brown. What?

1773
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:47,840
I have like, let's just do red.

1774
03:42:51,440 --> 03:42:55,840
Let's go to the beach, beach. Ninky Minjaj.

1775
03:42:58,560 --> 03:43:00,560
We'll keep it a classic, you know?

1776
03:43:01,200 --> 03:43:07,920
I know the room is, it does make it just go boy.

1777
03:43:12,000 --> 03:43:20,720
Yeah, it looks nice. It's kind of, kind of it.

1778
03:43:20,720 --> 03:43:23,760
Like my little drill hair.

1779
03:43:24,080 --> 03:43:36,560
I should just like have heels at all times. I wear heels even to the, the clown shoes.

1780
03:43:36,560 --> 03:43:40,960
Um, even to the beach, I'm just in high heels.

1781
03:43:43,840 --> 03:43:47,840
Wait, that actually kind of works. Oh yeah, other open-toed shoes stuff.

1782
03:43:48,160 --> 03:43:56,960
Wait, what are these freaking dolly heels? Those are so cute. What the hell?

1783
03:43:58,800 --> 03:44:01,760
I realized my skin tone looks a little washed out. I might change my skin tone.

1784
03:44:02,560 --> 03:44:07,840
Um, let's get these in red. That's kind of cute.

1785
03:44:11,120 --> 03:44:11,680
What is that?

1786
03:44:18,720 --> 03:44:22,720
Oh, what if I wear the sundress?

1787
03:44:25,520 --> 03:44:29,600
I look nefarious. Uh, rock angel.

1788
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:35,360
He leads to the beach, heels to bed.

1789
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:39,440
Wait, did I? No, I had the bunny slippers.

1790
03:44:39,760 --> 03:44:44,160
There's the micro in the bikini.

1791
03:44:49,840 --> 03:44:51,520
Hold on, I'm just gonna put this on for now.

1792
03:44:55,600 --> 03:45:02,160
And then I'm gonna fix my freaking makeup.

1793
03:45:02,880 --> 03:45:14,880
Um, let me fix the outfit.

1794
03:45:20,400 --> 03:45:26,560
Hey! Oh, that's cool. I can't stop teasing.

1795
03:45:26,880 --> 03:45:32,480
Like, this is such a 2000s outfit. Like, what is it doing here?

1796
03:45:37,840 --> 03:45:45,360
What? Am I going to Italy? Oh my god, those, those stripes are doing me favors. I'll tell you that.

1797
03:45:48,800 --> 03:45:52,000
Thank you. I can't stop teasing. That like hurt.

1798
03:45:56,560 --> 03:46:10,480
I swear to hell. It's hot outside. I'm wearing a bunny outfit. I should just have this view every day.

1799
03:46:11,440 --> 03:46:22,400
Hell yeah!

1800
03:46:25,520 --> 03:46:32,400
Wine shirt in the fanny pack. Let's go. I actually have this dress and I'm not even joking. I have this dress

1801
03:46:35,040 --> 03:46:36,080
except it's a lighter.

1802
03:46:37,040 --> 03:46:52,000
That's kind of crazy to me. I literally have that dress. Um, a clip that's shorter.

1803
03:46:53,200 --> 03:46:59,200
What up? You have the red Hawaiian shirt? I think I like that. What about this? No.

1804
03:46:59,360 --> 03:47:12,640
Maybe I can wear like, ooh. Bottoms? Any bottoms in the chat?

1805
03:47:19,840 --> 03:47:23,360
Can I just see all skirts? I feel like there are more skirts than this.

1806
03:47:24,080 --> 03:47:26,800
And they're just hiding from me.

1807
03:47:39,120 --> 03:47:39,600
All right.

1808
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:50,400
I've actually worn something like this, but then, um, yeah, I've worn like fishnets with it.

1809
03:47:53,920 --> 03:47:58,160
This is literally an outfit that I've worn before.

1810
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:05,040
Nice slings. Two, two, two. Make some man go. I can't whistle.

1811
03:48:07,040 --> 03:48:13,360
That's the way they all come through. Like, low cut. See through. Sure does that make you.

1812
03:48:14,240 --> 03:48:20,960
And I just set them up. Anywhere's my nails?

1813
03:48:24,880 --> 03:48:31,680
Let's go to the beach. Beach and Ninky Minjaj. I don't know if it's so.

1814
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:39,120
That looks right. Y'all.

1815
03:48:39,120 --> 03:48:43,120
Oh, hello.

1816
03:48:48,080 --> 03:48:50,400
Yeah, it looks like I'm going to a warp store.

1817
03:48:59,840 --> 03:49:03,040
There's our boxer briefs. What are those? Aren't those like briefs?

1818
03:49:04,000 --> 03:49:08,080
I don't know what those are, but I see the little thingy,

1819
03:49:09,120 --> 03:49:15,200
little little little pee pee holder, maybe a white top. Honestly, wait.

1820
03:49:18,080 --> 03:49:21,520
Yo, I kind of like that.

1821
03:49:24,160 --> 03:49:28,720
Casual madam. Wait, casual madam.

1822
03:49:28,720 --> 03:49:35,680
I look so goofy, though. I like that. I like the more youthful look of the other one.

1823
03:49:40,400 --> 03:49:44,080
A moment with those boxers or brief. You know what? I'm literally going to just wear

1824
03:49:44,960 --> 03:49:54,800
men's underwear just because it looks right with this outfit. It just goes. It's kind of a mood.

1825
03:49:59,440 --> 03:50:03,840
I hate like these are so like this is so ugly.

1826
03:50:08,720 --> 03:50:12,000
Wait, I'm Guy Fieri.

1827
03:50:20,480 --> 03:50:26,000
Wait, that just looks like this looks like a character from a show.

1828
03:50:26,080 --> 03:50:29,200
What is it? Look like I can't I can't tell who it looks like.

1829
03:50:31,520 --> 03:50:32,480
After hours.

1830
03:50:35,120 --> 03:50:35,620
Cute.

1831
03:50:39,360 --> 03:50:40,880
I write sins, not tragedies.

1832
03:50:46,320 --> 03:50:49,840
I chime in with the half of you people I've ever heard of.

1833
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:59,120
Closing the goddamn sword. No, it's much better to waste these kinds of things with the sets up.

1834
03:50:59,120 --> 03:51:01,600
Wait a second.

1835
03:51:08,320 --> 03:51:13,520
You spin me right around, baby, right around. Wait, hold on.

1836
03:51:13,520 --> 03:51:17,920
What did I have for formal? What did I have for party? Fuck it. No, we're not.

1837
03:51:18,160 --> 03:51:21,280
We're doing that outfit. We're matching Emmy.

1838
03:51:24,800 --> 03:51:25,600
And strongy.

1839
03:51:28,160 --> 03:51:29,440
Where is it? Oh, there it is.

1840
03:51:32,320 --> 03:51:35,680
I just want to know your name.

1841
03:51:37,680 --> 03:51:43,360
Yeah, is there any fur? That's a great question. Oh, frick. Go away. Go away.

1842
03:51:43,840 --> 03:51:52,480
No, I want. Okay. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see.

1843
03:51:56,880 --> 03:52:04,560
Tops. Jackets. No fur. Jackets with no fur. No, it's fur.

1844
03:52:04,560 --> 03:52:08,160
The whole, wait, actually, I might just do that outfit that I almost gave a zero,

1845
03:52:08,160 --> 03:52:09,760
except I put her in the sweater dress.

1846
03:52:10,320 --> 03:52:13,200
Where is it?

1847
03:52:17,840 --> 03:52:21,680
Actually, I should have actually keep it on feminine. Actually, no.

1848
03:52:25,360 --> 03:52:29,520
Yeah. So some other stuff keeps popping up in the morning.

1849
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:33,440
Yo, can I take off the choker?

1850
03:52:33,680 --> 03:52:40,560
Okay, let me just switch to that and then switch to that. Oh, nope. I won't let me take off the choker.

1851
03:52:47,360 --> 03:52:48,320
Can I take the color of this?

1852
03:52:53,520 --> 03:52:59,680
I've worn this outfit before, minus probably black leggings. Let me see. Where the heck did I go?

1853
03:53:04,160 --> 03:53:13,920
Wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1854
03:53:21,680 --> 03:53:23,680
This is going to be my formal wear.

1855
03:53:27,280 --> 03:53:28,720
No, we don't want formal. Where is it?

1856
03:53:29,040 --> 03:53:47,760
I'm sorry, Jessica. You're gone. It's a mood, but it's not at the same time. Where is it?

1857
03:53:51,120 --> 03:53:55,040
Okay, red formal party.

1858
03:53:59,680 --> 03:54:02,480
We'll be, where'd it go?

1859
03:54:06,320 --> 03:54:18,880
Party? Yeah, party and party and yeah. Fun, fun, fun, fun, looking forward to the weekend.

1860
03:54:20,480 --> 03:54:23,200
Yeah, that's about right. That's about right.

1861
03:54:23,600 --> 03:54:34,080
Why do I look kind of cute with the choker on? I might keep that on. Is there a red one?

1862
03:54:36,160 --> 03:54:42,880
Oh, yeah, that works. Let me just take off this bracelet.

1863
03:54:43,120 --> 03:54:48,160
So the choker actually works.

1864
03:54:51,680 --> 03:55:02,400
Why is I could do every accessory besides freaking every day? Let me put my toes on.

1865
03:55:03,120 --> 03:55:13,200
I can't see my toes, but it's fine. Okay, let me see if I can change my skin tone a little bit.

1866
03:55:16,880 --> 03:55:17,200
Nope.

1867
03:55:17,440 --> 03:55:17,920
Okay.

1868
03:55:31,600 --> 03:55:32,480
I don't like these.

1869
03:55:38,000 --> 03:55:41,360
This is just sheebie. Sorry, no, this is just sheebie.

1870
03:55:42,320 --> 03:55:46,960
This is, this is, this is sheebie. I love vanilla.

1871
03:55:52,480 --> 03:55:54,960
If I stay cool toned, I'm just turning purple.

1872
03:56:02,560 --> 03:56:03,920
All right, we'll just stay with what we had.

1873
03:56:04,880 --> 03:56:12,240
There's a skiter for the slings do. It literally just slides through stuff. Like it's just like,

1874
03:56:13,760 --> 03:56:15,040
it doesn't really make a difference.

1875
03:56:17,760 --> 03:56:23,680
It doesn't say to slide the customized color, but then it like lightens it just the slightest bit.

1876
03:56:23,680 --> 03:56:38,480
It's rich. All right. I think we got the outfits. So that's that's it for that.

1877
03:56:39,680 --> 03:56:44,880
Let me get that. We got that. We got that.

1878
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:52,080
Then you got that for a party. Then we got that where we're going swimming.

1879
03:56:52,960 --> 03:56:57,680
You got that when it's hot outside. It looks kind of goofy, but you know, it's a look.

1880
03:56:58,480 --> 03:57:04,640
And that for when it's, you know, cold weather like fall, you know.

1881
03:57:06,960 --> 03:57:08,720
Wait, can I wear baby doll heels with this?

1882
03:57:09,280 --> 03:57:16,480
No, I don't care if it's hot, whether or not give me the baby doll heels.

1883
03:57:18,000 --> 03:57:20,960
I'm just going to look like, you know, a whore all the time.

1884
03:57:29,920 --> 03:57:31,200
This looks so stupid.

1885
03:57:31,200 --> 03:57:35,920
Let me see if I can find a full body outfit that's like better.

1886
03:57:40,240 --> 03:57:41,360
Or at least like shorts.

1887
03:57:47,200 --> 03:57:48,800
And it's hot weather. Can I just wear...

1888
03:57:48,800 --> 03:57:50,800
Yeah.

1889
03:57:58,240 --> 03:57:58,800
Wait, no.

1890
03:58:02,400 --> 03:58:02,960
Wait, no.

1891
03:58:02,960 --> 03:58:07,680
Take a white...

1892
03:58:18,560 --> 03:58:24,400
You like what you see? I look like Angelic.

1893
03:58:24,400 --> 03:58:33,920
Ooh, indeed, sister. They don't come in white, they only come in gray.

1894
03:58:36,080 --> 03:58:38,320
You know, madam would be stepping on the town like this.

1895
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:47,840
You know, I just go outside, just walk, just walk over and be like, hey guys, what's going on?

1896
03:58:48,480 --> 03:58:49,840
It's hot out.

1897
03:58:50,560 --> 03:58:55,200
Is it ever like a red top?

1898
03:58:57,040 --> 03:58:59,360
Look stupid. I like really like the shirt.

1899
03:59:16,240 --> 03:59:19,280
Oh my god. Oh my god.

1900
03:59:20,560 --> 03:59:29,360
This is just like, it looks like a one piece. I'm looking very on to you right now on this outfit.

1901
03:59:36,320 --> 03:59:38,720
Wait, where's my stomach?

1902
03:59:41,840 --> 03:59:43,360
Oh wait, no, it's because my underwear is there.

1903
03:59:45,280 --> 03:59:47,680
Why do I like the America look, guys?

1904
03:59:48,320 --> 03:59:51,360
Gonna make my sisters? Not right now.

1905
03:59:54,960 --> 03:59:56,000
Why do I like that?

1906
03:59:57,920 --> 04:00:02,800
What if I make the heels? Because I'm, you know, one of the Americans, you know.

1907
04:00:11,600 --> 04:00:12,640
Hey guys.

1908
04:00:15,520 --> 04:00:17,040
You say one of the Olympics.

1909
04:00:17,680 --> 04:00:19,200
Did they? I don't want you looking.

1910
04:00:20,720 --> 04:00:26,000
Merica. Look, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're not doing that.

1911
04:00:33,200 --> 04:00:34,560
Can I get like a flowy skirt?

1912
04:00:37,760 --> 04:00:41,280
Yo, actually, wait, hold on, let me cook.

1913
04:00:41,600 --> 04:00:45,120
Never mind. Never mind.

1914
04:00:46,080 --> 04:00:52,640
Never mind. The cooking did not go well. It kind of got burnt. It kind of just didn't work out.

1915
04:00:56,240 --> 04:00:57,040
Let's see that.

1916
04:01:01,280 --> 04:01:03,520
And where is that one vest?

1917
04:01:03,520 --> 04:01:15,520
I'm right. I chime in with the haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door? No. I don't

1918
04:01:15,520 --> 04:01:21,440
know why it's British. Why are there so many evil coded stuff? Am I just a scene boy?

1919
04:01:21,440 --> 04:01:26,480
What? Let's just walk around like that. There we go. Hot weather outfit.

1920
04:01:34,320 --> 04:01:41,840
There's a black one. Actually like it in white. It's kind of a mood.

1921
04:01:44,720 --> 04:01:49,680
I wouldn't ever wear this, but what the fuck is a kilometer?

1922
04:01:52,240 --> 04:01:59,360
Okay, but I should probably finish. It's taken me four hours to make all of us guys.

1923
04:01:59,360 --> 04:02:01,920
It's like, what? No, I hate this outfit, though. I actually hate this.

1924
04:02:02,640 --> 04:02:06,480
Guys, I can't, I can't, I can't figure out what I like.

1925
04:02:09,840 --> 04:02:11,200
This is funny that I have an outfit.

1926
04:02:12,160 --> 04:02:23,120
Let's get rid of that.

1927
04:02:29,440 --> 04:02:35,280
Oh, we should just keep it basic. I feel like I should just be keeping it basic.

1928
04:02:36,240 --> 04:02:40,720
How to basic, if you would. If you will, if you would.

1929
04:02:43,360 --> 04:02:49,520
That looks pretty good, to be honest with you. Like, I don't know about you guys, but that looks

1930
04:02:49,520 --> 04:03:03,200
pretty damn good for a hot weather outfit, don't you think? Pretty damn good. Yeah, it's clown.

1931
04:03:05,680 --> 04:03:17,200
Those are just PJs.

1932
04:03:17,200 --> 04:03:38,080
I wish they had shorter dresses. That looks great, actually. Or alternatively.

1933
04:03:38,880 --> 04:03:44,720
Why is my hair clipping through the hot dog? Or alternatively.

1934
04:03:47,600 --> 04:04:00,720
Or, that actually looks pretty nice. However, however, why does it look good? But,

1935
04:04:00,720 --> 04:04:10,560
it looks too warm. Oh, wait, this? Let me change the top, and maybe if I do like a crop top?

1936
04:04:15,040 --> 04:04:22,800
Wait, is that a full body thing? I can't just have that. I just want the skirt on that.

1937
04:04:23,360 --> 04:04:31,440
I just want the skirt. I don't care about anything else. That's stupid. What?

1938
04:04:33,680 --> 04:04:35,280
Crop top. Drop top.

1939
04:04:40,320 --> 04:04:44,320
I remember when infinity scarves were a thing. That was an interesting time.

1940
04:04:44,320 --> 04:04:55,600
Just make myself naked. I'll move all my clothes in Minecraft, of course. What?

1941
04:04:56,000 --> 04:05:06,880
Wait.

1942
04:05:11,120 --> 04:05:12,480
Can I just wear this when it's hot?

1943
04:05:19,040 --> 04:05:20,880
I'm looking for the right shade of red.

1944
04:05:26,480 --> 04:05:36,880
Yeah, perfect. Yeah, it looks right.

1945
04:05:45,840 --> 04:05:48,400
I could wear whatever I want when it's hot. You promise?

1946
04:05:49,280 --> 04:05:56,160
You promise? Do you promise?

1947
04:06:01,840 --> 04:06:07,680
Why is nothing red?

1948
04:06:14,800 --> 04:06:18,160
Why are these two different shades when they're supposed to be part of the same set?

1949
04:06:19,280 --> 04:06:23,440
Okay, wait. I found it.

1950
04:06:25,920 --> 04:06:28,240
Lovely. Can I get some like...

1951
04:06:38,720 --> 04:06:40,560
That looks good for hot weather, don't you think?

1952
04:06:44,240 --> 04:06:46,160
That looks pretty good for hot weather, guys.

1953
04:06:48,400 --> 04:06:59,760
I know. I could have sworn that the old games had color wheels and you could just like pluck them.

1954
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:06,080
Like, I'm so sure that that was a thing.

1955
04:07:10,960 --> 04:07:12,560
At least try to make them look like shorts.

1956
04:07:12,800 --> 04:07:16,720
Nope, they don't look like shorts.

1957
04:07:24,080 --> 04:07:25,360
This is ridiculous!

1958
04:07:32,240 --> 04:07:35,280
Oh, that's hot. I just walk her. I just take off my jacket.

1959
04:07:37,680 --> 04:07:40,320
I just take off my jacket. That's it.

1960
04:07:41,280 --> 04:07:44,400
It looks like I should have a belly ring.

1961
04:07:53,360 --> 04:07:57,440
What are these? What are those?

1962
04:08:06,080 --> 04:08:06,800
I'm ready to go.

1963
04:08:10,720 --> 04:08:17,920
Let's do a little open toe. No, they have to be red.

1964
04:08:21,120 --> 04:08:26,960
I don't really like the open toes. Kind of look gross, except for those ones. Those are nice.

1965
04:08:31,280 --> 04:08:35,920
Again, it's not the same red, so it's bothering me because that's just how my mind works.

1966
04:08:41,280 --> 04:08:44,080
For hot weather, it's probably good to have the toes out.

1967
04:08:48,960 --> 04:08:51,200
I also think you just need to pick one.

1968
04:08:59,600 --> 04:09:03,120
Listen, I'm trying my best out here.

1969
04:09:07,440 --> 04:09:08,800
Aren't you entertained?

1970
04:09:10,640 --> 04:09:12,640
Isn't this entertaining for you?

1971
04:09:16,000 --> 04:09:17,600
I should probably wear a shirt.

1972
04:09:28,720 --> 04:09:37,200
No, I don't like it though. I like just having my bra out because it looks funny, but will be appropriate.

1973
04:09:41,200 --> 04:09:42,480
Honey, we need some dinners.

1974
04:09:44,320 --> 04:09:49,520
Yeah, I do. Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, guys. This is the final looks for everybody.

1975
04:09:55,600 --> 04:09:56,080
Hold on.

1976
04:09:58,400 --> 04:10:02,720
So you got Mercy. Mercy, Modest.

1977
04:10:04,320 --> 04:10:10,000
Mercy, Modest. Gameplay time. No, I know I was going to take hours to do just to design us.

1978
04:10:10,320 --> 04:10:16,160
That's why this isn't playing the Sims and making my gen mates. No, it's just designing my gen mates, guys.

1979
04:10:18,720 --> 04:10:20,000
All right, let me get... I see...

1980
04:10:30,960 --> 04:10:33,600
Let me go. Wait, hold on. Shrani's hair should be...

1981
04:10:35,040 --> 04:10:38,800
Not pink. She doesn't look like herself. It should be green. It looks better green.

1982
04:10:41,040 --> 04:10:42,480
Then we got Shrani.

1983
04:10:49,360 --> 04:10:50,720
Then we got Emi.

1984
04:10:55,600 --> 04:10:58,320
Wait, is that her everyday? No, that's not her everyday outfit.

1985
04:11:00,800 --> 04:11:01,200
Hello?

1986
04:11:07,120 --> 04:11:08,000
Then we got Emi.

1987
04:11:10,320 --> 04:11:21,600
Long Emi. Long Emi and I see. Then we got Ezra.

1988
04:11:25,520 --> 04:11:30,960
Actually, it looks probably the best set of all of us. Hold on. Let me grab her other outfit.

1989
04:11:31,680 --> 04:11:33,040
Her OG outfit.

1990
04:11:36,320 --> 04:11:37,600
Then you got Ezra.

1991
04:11:41,120 --> 04:11:43,120
Oh my gosh, she doesn't wear pants.

1992
04:11:48,880 --> 04:11:50,000
And then you got me.

1993
04:11:57,360 --> 04:11:59,680
It looks so silly.

1994
04:12:02,320 --> 04:12:05,040
I can't get over it. How silly it looks.

1995
04:12:07,120 --> 04:12:08,320
Oh my god.

1996
04:12:11,040 --> 04:12:13,040
I wish I could make Emi cuter.

1997
04:12:18,800 --> 04:12:19,360
Feel her.

1998
04:12:24,560 --> 04:12:28,000
I think I should get a design. What do you mean? Make her a child?

1999
04:12:28,560 --> 04:12:28,880
What?

2000
04:12:32,480 --> 04:12:33,680
Let me see what it looks like.

2001
04:12:40,320 --> 04:12:55,600
No, no, no. That's bad. That's terrible.

2002
04:13:01,920 --> 04:13:04,000
Yeah, that looks better. What do I see?

2003
04:13:10,880 --> 04:13:14,480
Why is her hair black?

2004
04:13:18,320 --> 04:13:20,000
That doesn't make any sense.

2005
04:13:23,280 --> 04:13:28,000
Why is she a little boy child? Why is her hair black?

2006
04:13:38,080 --> 04:13:39,600
I see a look like that.

2007
04:13:41,120 --> 04:13:43,600
What happened to her?

2008
04:13:50,480 --> 04:13:52,080
Why is her hair black?

2009
04:13:58,240 --> 04:13:59,200
That's so weird.

2010
04:14:01,600 --> 04:14:04,480
Wait. No, did it mess up everything? Hold on.

2011
04:14:10,800 --> 04:14:11,920
She looks good black hair.

2012
04:14:14,160 --> 04:14:16,240
Yeah, I just like fully reset for some reason.

2013
04:14:22,320 --> 04:14:25,520
Why does this baby look like that? I hate it so much.

2014
04:14:28,320 --> 04:14:29,200
That was crazy.

2015
04:14:33,040 --> 04:14:35,760
Okay, that's better. Did it mess up Emi's stuff too then?

2016
04:14:35,760 --> 04:14:39,360
Oh, it did. Damn it.

2017
04:14:43,600 --> 04:14:49,440
No, no, no, no, no, no. She looks like Chucky. No.

2018
04:14:54,400 --> 04:14:59,040
I actually, I don't think I like the cap teeth. Let me take out these. Why does she have like plugs?

2019
04:15:02,240 --> 04:15:04,000
It's like she doesn't have freaking gauges.

2020
04:15:06,160 --> 04:15:13,680
Give me, I think I might give her braces instead. I think that's cute.

2021
04:15:16,960 --> 04:15:18,640
Let's do braces instead.

2022
04:15:23,360 --> 04:15:24,800
Yeah, Emi with braces.

2023
04:15:26,800 --> 04:15:28,960
I've only seen like one VTuber with braces.

2024
04:15:29,680 --> 04:15:39,280
All right. All right. I think that's it, folks.

2025
04:15:44,000 --> 04:15:50,320
I'm her, her, her, her, her. She, she, she take a look. It's me, me, me.

2026
04:15:52,960 --> 04:15:54,080
Chucky, you're Coraline.

2027
04:15:54,560 --> 04:15:57,360
Coraline. All right.

2028
04:16:01,120 --> 04:16:04,800
Modis. Look at that. Hold on.

2029
04:16:12,320 --> 04:16:12,960
Take a picture.

2030
04:16:15,840 --> 04:16:16,320
Wait.

2031
04:16:16,560 --> 04:16:31,120
Oh, it's Johnny. We're all the same height. I wish you could, I could change the heights.

2032
04:16:31,120 --> 04:16:35,200
Can I upload a picture? Share a household to the gallery?

2033
04:16:38,720 --> 04:16:43,200
Oh, is this like where I like set, like say who, like that I made it?

2034
04:16:47,280 --> 04:16:56,320
LOL. It's the veeler girls.

2035
04:17:05,840 --> 04:17:10,320
Do I just do it? How do I share it?

2036
04:17:17,280 --> 04:17:21,920
Can they do it? I don't know what I'm doing.

2037
04:17:26,960 --> 04:17:30,160
Does that make it so you guys can download the model? Because that would be fine.

2038
04:17:34,880 --> 04:17:42,880
What? Oh snap. Okay. We have $30,000. It's fine. I know the mother load. Willow Creek.

2039
04:17:46,880 --> 04:17:49,920
I feel like.

2040
04:17:58,880 --> 04:18:07,040
What? This world does not have any good starter lots. Oh, why would you give that to me then?

2041
04:18:07,120 --> 04:18:10,960
Let's do Willow Creek. Select a place to live.

2042
04:18:16,320 --> 04:18:17,760
A hovel.

2043
04:18:29,360 --> 04:18:30,480
I cannot afford it.

2044
04:18:31,280 --> 04:18:35,280
Wait, how do I do the mother load?

2045
04:18:40,240 --> 04:18:42,560
He did. Oh my God. Can I have them?

2046
04:18:43,200 --> 04:18:49,200
Say, I'm girl. You live like this. Zero DLC. Listen, I'm not spending money on that right now.

2047
04:18:49,200 --> 04:18:51,200
How?

2048
04:18:54,640 --> 04:18:54,960
Tilled.

2049
04:19:00,240 --> 04:19:04,160
Frick, I don't think I can do it. Hold on.

2050
04:19:06,560 --> 04:19:12,560
How to do mother, wait, how should you cheat Sims for?

2051
04:19:12,560 --> 04:19:21,920
Okay.

2052
04:19:33,200 --> 04:19:34,240
Help. No.

2053
04:19:38,880 --> 04:19:40,160
How do I do the mother load cheat?

2054
04:19:43,280 --> 04:19:49,920
Mother load cheat. Sims for.

2055
04:19:57,920 --> 04:20:03,920
Mother load. Why is it in caps? Mother load. Why isn't it working?

2056
04:20:12,560 --> 04:20:23,360
Why can't I get more funds right off the rip? I used to be able to do that.

2057
04:20:24,480 --> 04:20:31,280
I have to get a house first. That's stupid. I wanted to get one of these. I want to get a mansion.

2058
04:20:33,680 --> 04:20:37,280
Well, I'm moving us. Where's the cheapest one?

2059
04:20:37,840 --> 04:20:41,040
We're living here.

2060
04:20:51,920 --> 04:20:54,720
Can this be a perfect home? It's a patch of grass.

2061
04:20:57,840 --> 04:21:00,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to do that. I'm going to buy the mansion.

2062
04:21:00,720 --> 04:21:08,000
Mm-hmm. Oh my god. Look at us. That's so crazy.

2063
04:21:13,760 --> 04:21:19,440
Why is the camera flying away? Why did it go all over here? What the heck?

2064
04:21:22,160 --> 04:21:24,080
Dag dag. Dag dag.

2065
04:21:27,760 --> 04:21:28,400
What's happening?

2066
04:21:31,040 --> 04:21:36,560
Hold on. I'm not traveling. Go back.

2067
04:21:43,840 --> 04:21:44,560
Hold on.

2068
04:22:00,640 --> 04:22:06,320
Don't worry about it. I'm doing it so fast I can't keep up.

2069
04:22:09,840 --> 04:22:12,240
I just want a million dollars. I spelled it wrong.

2070
04:22:15,040 --> 04:22:22,560
Copy and paste? No, I'm getting my stuff up. My words for a minute.

2071
04:22:30,480 --> 04:22:32,480
Uh-huh.

2072
04:22:40,480 --> 04:22:44,080
Yay. Wow. How did we do that? That's crazy. How do I move out?

2073
04:22:48,400 --> 04:22:52,560
How do I? They're all just like chatting. How do I sell?

2074
04:23:01,360 --> 04:23:02,560
Okay, that's great. Thank you.

2075
04:23:05,920 --> 04:23:08,800
I got charisma. Don't know how.

2076
04:23:12,080 --> 04:23:13,440
Is there a comedy?

2077
04:23:18,240 --> 04:23:20,960
Phone? Where's the phone?

2078
04:23:31,280 --> 04:23:36,960
Is it loading?

2079
04:23:40,240 --> 04:23:41,120
That's great.

2080
04:23:45,200 --> 04:23:46,560
Oh, okay. I was just taking a while.

2081
04:23:56,080 --> 04:23:57,360
Okay. Oh, let's see.

2082
04:24:00,960 --> 04:24:04,720
Four beds, three bathrooms. Four beds, three bathrooms.

2083
04:24:09,040 --> 04:24:10,480
Three. No, that's not enough.

2084
04:24:13,040 --> 04:24:13,600
What's this?

2085
04:24:16,640 --> 04:24:17,680
Oh, it's the goth house.

2086
04:24:20,240 --> 04:24:22,960
We can live right next to the goths. I don't know.

2087
04:24:23,760 --> 04:24:27,520
This one's more expensive though. We'll buy the more expensive one.

2088
04:24:31,040 --> 04:24:31,760
How do I get it?

2089
04:24:35,520 --> 04:24:36,080
I want it.

2090
04:24:40,160 --> 04:24:40,640
What's this?

2091
04:24:44,560 --> 04:24:46,320
Did I select it? Oh, it's already selected.

2092
04:24:47,680 --> 04:24:50,000
Why is that house selected?

2093
04:24:51,840 --> 04:24:53,840
Oh, they're not selected. I don't freaking...

2094
04:24:55,040 --> 04:24:55,680
We're going!

2095
04:24:58,720 --> 04:24:59,440
Furnished?

2096
04:25:01,120 --> 04:25:05,280
Bulldozed a lot because I suck at making some houses.

2097
04:25:14,480 --> 04:25:14,800
Wow!

2098
04:25:18,240 --> 04:25:19,360
I know there's a piano.

2099
04:25:21,360 --> 04:25:22,880
Yeah, I can probably like add another floor.

2100
04:25:24,480 --> 04:25:28,320
I can put in a pool. Oh yeah, pool right here. Perfect.

2101
04:25:29,120 --> 04:25:32,880
We got a gazebo. We can bury a body under. Perfect.

2102
04:25:32,880 --> 04:25:35,600
We got a little thing. Go fishing. Perfect.

2103
04:25:37,280 --> 04:25:37,760
How do I...

2104
04:25:40,640 --> 04:25:43,360
How do I go to the next floor?

2105
04:25:47,280 --> 04:25:49,840
How do I go to the next floor? Where am I?

2106
04:25:51,920 --> 04:25:55,200
I'm just watching TV. What am I watching?

2107
04:25:59,040 --> 04:26:03,680
If I tell gross joke, what if I select a zero?

2108
04:26:03,680 --> 04:26:06,080
We'll like... Oh, okay.

2109
04:26:09,120 --> 04:26:11,920
We can all sleep with each other. There's plenty of bedrooms.

2110
04:26:12,480 --> 04:26:15,120
Yeah, we can share. We can share beds.

2111
04:26:17,760 --> 04:26:20,640
Look at this. This is Emmy's room. She's already claimed it.

2112
04:26:23,440 --> 04:26:26,320
We can share. This is the Wheeler house, guys.

2113
04:26:29,280 --> 04:26:31,760
One more bed. No, because we can share a bed.

2114
04:26:33,760 --> 04:26:36,000
Why is Azera playing the violin badly?

2115
04:26:37,120 --> 04:26:43,040
And then Strani is playing chess with herself. That's insane.

2116
04:26:45,440 --> 04:26:52,400
Awesome. That's great. That's really cool. What am I doing outside?

2117
04:26:59,040 --> 04:27:03,520
Where is she?

2118
04:27:08,720 --> 04:27:12,640
Me and I see it. Where is she? You're just going to watch TV.

2119
04:27:14,560 --> 04:27:15,920
What are we watching?

2120
04:27:20,640 --> 04:27:23,520
Order pizza. Let's order a pizza for them.

2121
04:27:23,520 --> 04:27:28,080
What would that be under?

2122
04:27:35,040 --> 04:27:39,200
Business? Find a job? Save it?

2123
04:27:44,000 --> 04:27:49,120
How the frick do I order pizza? Home icon delivery. Oh, okay.

2124
04:27:53,840 --> 04:27:58,000
Zoomers?

2125
04:28:00,480 --> 04:28:04,080
Why is normal pizza delivery different? Oh, I'm ordering pizza.

2126
04:28:05,200 --> 04:28:10,400
Canadian bacon pizza? Let's get... I feel like all the girls will like pepperoni.

2127
04:28:13,520 --> 04:28:16,400
I'm talking about pizza. Mercy's talking about me.

2128
04:28:17,200 --> 04:28:26,160
My pizza's on the way. Perfect. Take a photo with the phone.

2129
04:28:27,360 --> 04:28:32,560
Why do I look so cute? I'm flirting. Am I flirting with Amy? I mean, I see.

2130
04:28:34,080 --> 04:28:35,360
No, I'm flirting with Mercy.

2131
04:28:35,360 --> 04:28:39,440
Why am I flirting with Mercy?

2132
04:28:42,640 --> 04:28:43,280
Oh, my God.

2133
04:28:45,520 --> 04:28:48,560
Get a pizza. Oh, that's a good idea. I might order pizza.

2134
04:28:50,480 --> 04:28:55,440
Do you guys want to order pizza? Do you guys want to order pizza together?

2135
04:28:59,200 --> 04:29:02,160
Like that pizza I had the other day was good. I'm like, I want pizza again.

2136
04:29:02,960 --> 04:29:07,680
Oh, here's the pizza. She may go get it. She may go get the pizza.

2137
04:29:08,640 --> 04:29:12,080
How do I rotate the camera? Is it control? Shift?

2138
04:29:15,760 --> 04:29:16,880
Is somebody going to enter the door?

2139
04:29:20,080 --> 04:29:21,840
Mercy's going to grab it. Thank you, Mercy.

2140
04:29:23,840 --> 04:29:28,080
Mercy, pick up the speed, sweetheart. Mercy.

2141
04:29:28,400 --> 04:29:40,960
Mercy, imagine you go to drop off a pizza and the person walks up to you like that.

2142
04:29:46,880 --> 04:29:48,720
What's Amy doing? Is she still gaming?

2143
04:29:51,280 --> 04:29:52,320
Amy's just gaming.

2144
04:29:53,280 --> 04:29:55,760
Was she playing fucking FIFA? What is this?

2145
04:29:58,560 --> 04:29:59,840
She's feeling inspired.

2146
04:30:05,520 --> 04:30:07,600
Okay, what's, what's, what's Strony doing?

2147
04:30:14,880 --> 04:30:20,720
Strony? Strony? Strony? Where are you?

2148
04:30:22,480 --> 04:30:23,680
Okay, what was that?

2149
04:30:33,200 --> 04:30:37,200
Camera options? Oh, I can take screenshots.

2150
04:30:46,320 --> 04:30:50,160
Oh, Mercy has identified a guppy. Thank you, Mercy.

2151
04:30:52,320 --> 04:31:00,320
Why is the Sarah playing the violin? I can't. How do I rotate the camera?

2152
04:31:05,600 --> 04:31:07,280
She's playing just with the voices.

2153
04:31:10,640 --> 04:31:17,040
She's fine. Is she going to go use the bathroom? Oh, wait. No, let me watch.

2154
04:31:22,320 --> 04:31:47,040
Oh, you're thinking about me? Is she walking like that? I forgot I made her walk goofy.

2155
04:31:52,320 --> 04:32:05,040
Strony? You coming to see me? Oh, look at us. We're having a good time. Oh my god.

2156
04:32:11,920 --> 04:32:19,360
Look at us. All we need is freaking, I need, I need a Zura. Like, I need us all down here

2157
04:32:19,440 --> 04:32:22,720
and in me too. Why am I flirting with everybody?

2158
04:32:26,640 --> 04:32:27,840
Oh, Mercy, what did I say?

2159
04:32:32,400 --> 04:32:36,640
Oh, did you see Mercy just get closer to me? Are you guys going to eat the pizza?

2160
04:32:39,600 --> 04:32:43,440
Call the mill. Strony, why don't you let everybody know the food's here?

2161
04:32:44,160 --> 04:32:49,360
Why are we doing musical chairs?

2162
04:32:54,160 --> 04:32:56,800
Oh my god, this is great, guys. This might be my new obsession.

2163
04:32:57,840 --> 04:33:02,560
I might Tamagotchi and all Sim stuff. Oh my god.

2164
04:33:03,120 --> 04:33:14,400
Look at us. Oh my god, this actually brings me so much joy. I'm not even kidding.

2165
04:33:15,680 --> 04:33:21,440
Look at, get the freaking thing out the way. How do I take a screenshot?

2166
04:33:21,440 --> 04:33:24,720
A break lent him. So chimzababi.

2167
04:33:35,280 --> 04:33:46,960
Yeah. Can I tweet this? Oh, the Tamagotchi's yelling at me. Hi, hi, what's up,

2168
04:33:46,960 --> 04:33:55,200
Tamagotchi? You pooped everywhere. Well, I'm not doing that right now. How do I,

2169
04:33:57,120 --> 04:34:02,480
how do I, what happens with this screenshot? Your pictures can be viewed. Camera options.

2170
04:34:03,360 --> 04:34:08,000
I want to upload this. Somebody, wait, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take an actual

2171
04:34:08,000 --> 04:34:21,760
screenshot. I took an actual screenshot. File, save.

2172
04:34:27,680 --> 04:34:30,640
All right, all right, all right, all right. Hold on.

2173
04:34:38,240 --> 04:34:42,240
Yay.

2174
04:34:46,000 --> 04:34:54,320
We're a happy family having pizza. Look at that. Oh my god, I'm like, I'm so happy right now.

2175
04:34:54,880 --> 04:34:56,240
This makes me so happy.

2176
04:34:56,240 --> 04:35:04,320
Wait, what? Why can't I, what's up with Ibi's skirt?

2177
04:35:05,440 --> 04:35:11,040
Yo, Ibi. We're just playing musical chairs. Oh, we're all sitting together.

2178
04:35:12,640 --> 04:35:15,280
Thank you. Thank you, Strani, for picking up after us.

2179
04:35:15,440 --> 04:35:25,280
So, I'm going to end stream here and take a little break.

2180
04:35:27,840 --> 04:35:37,680
I'm on a raid into, I think, I think, I think Strani's playing Bioshock, so I'll raid into her

2181
04:35:38,640 --> 04:35:40,720
and I'll be back for the member stream.

2182
04:35:46,080 --> 04:35:53,680
I hope you guys enjoyed. She can write jokes on a computer. Oh, I see a programmer? Dang,

2183
04:35:53,680 --> 04:36:02,400
okay, girls are incredible. But bye, guys. So, I stream at 7 p.m. Eastern. We're going to try to

2184
04:36:02,400 --> 04:36:06,480
build a gun plot. I've never built a gun plot before. I'm probably not going to be good at it,

2185
04:36:06,560 --> 04:36:16,320
and if I'm not good at it, I'm probably just going to Zatsu. Bye. Bye. Have a good time. I hope,

2186
04:36:16,320 --> 04:36:23,600
I'm glad you guys enjoyed. Why just use a toilet? Okay, Strani, you need to take a shower or bath.

2187
04:36:24,640 --> 04:36:28,720
I have to figure out how to play this game because I haven't played The Sims in a while,

2188
04:36:28,720 --> 04:36:33,680
and I don't think I ever put The Sims 4. Bye, everybody. See you later at the pizza party. I

2189
04:36:33,680 --> 04:36:37,600
just smacked the microphone. I'll see you at the pizza party. I'm getting just cheese pizza

2190
04:36:37,600 --> 04:36:42,080
because I'm regular. Oh my God, Strani's cooking. I don't know if Strani can cook. I don't believe

2191
04:36:42,080 --> 04:36:50,640
she could. All right, bye. Tell her, tell her, um, wait, no, it does because, because the RuneScape

2192
04:36:50,640 --> 04:37:08,640
streams. I don't know. I can't think of, don't forget the surprise. Yes, I'm going to post that right

2193
04:37:08,640 --> 04:37:14,400
after this. Thank you for the reminder. Oh my God, that's so good. Can you see my, oh,

2194
04:37:15,280 --> 04:37:25,360
excuse me? I can see my, thinking about steak. Why do I look crazy?

2195
04:37:32,960 --> 04:37:37,840
Look at us. Wait, where the fuck is IC? Is IC pissing somewhere?

2196
04:37:38,000 --> 04:37:47,440
Probably. Okay. Bye, guys. Bye. Bye. Bye. Just say Sim, just say Simlish Raid or something.

2197
04:37:52,640 --> 04:37:58,880
Smells bad. You should take a shower or a bath. Open your needs panel. How about that?
