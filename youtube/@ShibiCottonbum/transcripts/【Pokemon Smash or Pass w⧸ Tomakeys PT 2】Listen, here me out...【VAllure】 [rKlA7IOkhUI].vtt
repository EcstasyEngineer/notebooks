Oh

05:59.680 --> 06:07.600
You're not in here, why isn't it working? What if I unplugged this sometimes sometimes my goal XLR like transfers stuff really weirdly

06:12.600 --> 06:17.320
Yeah, like you're yeah, you're my Tulpa nobody can hear

06:24.640 --> 06:28.360
I'm sorry, you guys can't hear all the funny stuff that trinket is saying to me

06:30.160 --> 06:32.160
Sometimes my goal XLR were transfer

06:33.080 --> 06:34.520
stuff

06:34.520 --> 06:37.820
Let me see. I just have to click through a bunch of crap and hope that it works

06:39.600 --> 06:41.600
Start singing or something

06:54.200 --> 07:03.360
Why I want it it doesn't want to pick that up hold on maybe if I go to properties

07:12.800 --> 07:16.760
That was really good though, it was really good too, they'll never know oh

07:19.800 --> 07:22.840
What if I do say something

07:24.480 --> 07:28.400
Why doesn't it want to pick up on what?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Maybe that'll be a bummer

07:36.720 --> 07:42.960
Just from Firefox. Oh, there it is there they go. Yeah, there you are. Okay. Let me turn you down a bit

07:44.840 --> 07:46.840
PoE fixed

07:47.880 --> 07:49.880
Harlots she's here

07:50.320 --> 07:59.880
Curse collab never curse couldn't be us. We're so lucky everything works out for us

08:02.520 --> 08:08.840
Only members can hear her voice. I would be interesting. She was spitting bars. You guys missed out

08:09.560 --> 08:12.000
Let me pull up the smash or pass window

08:13.200 --> 08:15.200
hell yeah, uh

08:16.080 --> 08:18.560
Trinket is currently cooking up a mup itself

08:19.880 --> 08:22.440
I am are you giving yourself a Scooby-Doo caller?

08:24.240 --> 08:26.240
That's always been in the plans

08:27.680 --> 08:30.520
Up always the jam. I love it

08:31.440 --> 08:37.400
Because Scooby-Doo is well, he's not my first choice husband, but he's definitely like

08:37.960 --> 08:39.960
on the list of

08:40.160 --> 08:43.800
Cartoon characters that would be an automatic smash for me. Yeah

08:44.440 --> 08:46.240
Yeah

08:46.240 --> 08:52.000
But like if I take Scooby I have to take the rest of the the mystery game you understand I understand

08:52.640 --> 08:54.000
because like

08:54.000 --> 08:59.800
Actually, I was talking about this on Sunday because I've been on a real Omegaverse kick lately. Mm-hmm

09:00.600 --> 09:03.600
And so I yeah, I sent me some of my diverse stuff

09:05.320 --> 09:11.040
Because I've been recommended to it by in budding friendship, but I'm really enjoying it, but

09:12.120 --> 09:15.720
In my mind, right? Mm-hmm in my mind

09:16.240 --> 09:19.440
There is like this the Scooby-Doo game, right?

09:20.080 --> 09:22.680
Chaggy is very much an alpha

09:24.120 --> 09:26.120
And so and so is

09:26.800 --> 09:28.480
Okay

09:28.480 --> 09:35.920
Fred is a very beta male. Okay, but he's got Omega tendencies. All right

09:36.960 --> 09:38.960
Daphne is a straight-up

09:39.360 --> 09:45.640
Beta with Omega tendencies, but she's more like badass. All right, that's beta and then

09:46.240 --> 09:49.200
Velma is nothing but pure Omega energy

09:50.320 --> 09:56.680
Like Velma's been with everybody on the crew. Velma's just like the comfort creature in the mystery ink machine

10:01.680 --> 10:03.680
I never would have thought of this like

10:07.880 --> 10:11.760
If the gang or Omegaverse, that's you know

10:12.600 --> 10:19.200
That's just that's just that's just how it goes. That's just how it be. I don't think I'm wrong. I

10:21.200 --> 10:28.320
Think I'm more right than anything honestly. Yeah, Trinket's getting me into Omegaverse stuff. So blame her for anything

10:29.280 --> 10:34.840
Like if madam she be starts calling you guys submissive and readable some of you might be Omega's

10:36.360 --> 10:40.080
Well, it looks like I have some inappropriate stuff on my screen, but I promise I don't

10:41.760 --> 10:43.480
You know

10:43.480 --> 10:49.880
The whole stream is gonna be inappropriate, but you know pop offs pop off singular window. That's blurred pop off

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
It's from the the sucker punch stream, I know I was there

10:58.880 --> 11:00.880
Yes, I know you were there I

11:01.960 --> 11:07.000
Really like suck a sucker punch with all you guys. It was really good. Did you like it?

11:07.000 --> 11:11.720
I mean, I was a little confused, but I see where it's going for yeah

11:12.040 --> 11:17.920
Like it's um, it's like American McGee's Alice in Wonderland. Yeah

11:18.800 --> 11:23.400
But like a little more a little more nuance. Mm-hmm

11:23.960 --> 11:27.320
Like it's a it's a fantasy within a fantasy

11:29.280 --> 11:34.440
Within a real situation that she's just dissociating the whole time with precisely

11:37.360 --> 11:39.360
It's very oops, it's very

11:42.280 --> 11:46.240
Frick did I accidentally smash the wooden version

11:47.720 --> 11:52.480
So I'm so glad that that manlet didn't say her at the very oh, yeah

11:53.400 --> 12:00.120
Anything that he wanted from the situation. Yeah Oscar Oscar Isaac got what was coming from blue

12:00.120 --> 12:05.860
And then like and then he was a snitch at the very end. I know it was ridiculous

12:06.500 --> 12:09.300
He's oh, he's so frustrating, but pretty

12:11.420 --> 12:15.140
Like that the girls actually died that the orderlies kill them

12:15.140 --> 12:18.300
I think the order that's what I was thinking about as I was falling asleep

12:19.220 --> 12:21.220
after stream, I'm like

12:21.380 --> 12:23.860
Because every time I watch the movie I like think of other

12:24.500 --> 12:28.100
things like different like parallels and stuff and I'm like cuz

12:28.860 --> 12:34.860
Doc the doctor never said that two other patients died. She just said she started a fire

12:35.300 --> 12:40.020
And got let one escape some but I'm I still think that they died a hundred percent

12:40.020 --> 12:43.700
You know, you know what could have happened because like and like insane

12:43.700 --> 12:47.100
Asylums were so bad during the time period that I'm presuming this yeah

12:47.100 --> 12:52.500
It looks like it was like the 50s or 60s or something like they might have died due to treatment

12:54.500 --> 13:00.020
With their death by just giving it to an orderly because the orderlies would take patients away. Yeah

13:00.580 --> 13:02.580
That's a good. That's a very

13:03.180 --> 13:05.180
Good observe

13:05.180 --> 13:08.740
Observation hundred percent. Sorry. I'm half asleep so I can barely form words

13:09.540 --> 13:12.580
That's okay. I've got more than double words. I

13:14.180 --> 13:21.320
Didn't do like the New York Times wordal bullshit, but like I'll I'll make up some I'll make up some nouns and some adjectives for you

13:21.820 --> 13:24.260
A E I O U Y

13:24.900 --> 13:27.940
Okay, W X nice

13:28.620 --> 13:30.540
Fabulous

13:30.540 --> 13:36.900
Maybe maybe is maybe a cue the maybe a cue a rare cue in there a rare cue

13:40.660 --> 13:42.660
I'm barely following

13:44.420 --> 13:46.420
All right

13:46.420 --> 13:51.300
How are you going with your Muppet version we might we might transform to Muppets I

13:52.220 --> 13:56.340
Guess I just got to do the one thing for the hair and then

13:57.500 --> 13:59.500
Let's see

14:00.540 --> 14:04.900
All I got to do is do my little pinkies little pinkies little pinkie poos

14:05.540 --> 14:09.940
Yeah, my little pinkie poos it it makes it makes the look. I'm very fashionable

14:10.220 --> 14:13.780
You always have to have a bit of pop, you know, I agree

14:16.100 --> 14:18.100
Pull up my food you took

14:18.980 --> 14:21.700
So I can just have my Muppet self next to me

14:22.340 --> 14:26.140
Because there there is a Muppet, but it's of the monkey. Oh

14:26.980 --> 14:30.420
Yeah, I'm Toma like how you call her the monkey

14:43.940 --> 14:46.940
Ignore the random browser source on my screen

14:49.140 --> 14:51.140
There we are

14:52.140 --> 14:55.700
Wait, I'll have to go into

14:57.500 --> 15:00.420
Flip it horizontally, I do have to flip it horizontally

15:02.140 --> 15:04.540
Or we swap places because of the way that I

15:07.740 --> 15:09.740
Looks like we're gonna have a great conversation

15:10.460 --> 15:14.740
It's like my mic just constantly on in this call. What the hell I

15:15.900 --> 15:17.900
Mean, there's a little bit of

15:18.740 --> 15:20.740
Was it my fucking AC

15:20.900 --> 15:24.660
But that's not that's not bad. I kind of like it. It's a nice background

15:25.460 --> 15:29.260
I appreciate that everyone likes my background noise. I

15:30.060 --> 15:32.460
Mean, it's it's like the white noise

15:32.460 --> 15:36.740
It's like when you're sitting out on a on a hot porch and you're listening to the summer rain

15:36.740 --> 15:39.420
And you get that nice rain smell and you just

15:40.300 --> 15:42.300
And you just snored it

15:42.340 --> 15:45.900
Yeah, you you snort the rain you snort the rain smell

15:46.900 --> 15:55.420
Absolutely. Oh my god. All right. I have my little mini me next to me and now she talks when she's supposed to

15:56.980 --> 15:58.980
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

15:59.380 --> 16:01.380
I'm almost done

16:01.620 --> 16:03.620
Take your time

16:03.620 --> 16:05.620
I'm just staring at this ugly wooden ball

16:07.020 --> 16:09.260
He is the world

16:09.380 --> 16:11.380
I

16:13.940 --> 16:15.940
Hate him

16:16.220 --> 16:21.220
Just he's so ugly. Why did they make him made out of wood? They had they had metal

16:21.380 --> 16:26.780
Why is his top made out of wood? I don't know. I feel like they could have also put that part on the bottom

16:28.260 --> 16:30.260
They could have

16:31.380 --> 16:37.860
Actually when they did it for a wool tour but looks even crazier, so he looks better than wool tour at least

16:40.260 --> 16:45.220
Splinters very true. I'd like to talk with Muppet she be after stream about what?

16:46.980 --> 16:48.980
About what?

16:50.340 --> 16:54.420
You have with this Muppet. Yeah, what business do you have with this Muppet?

16:59.340 --> 17:04.020
You want to throw it at a wall that hurts that hurts me deeply

17:04.020 --> 17:10.460
I mean, there is that trend where people like buy Fumos, right and they just beat them and then they yeah

17:10.700 --> 17:12.980
Kind of soak them in milk and throw them at a wall

17:13.620 --> 17:20.540
Of course, I don't think your demographic wants to soak them in milk. Yeah, probably not milk, but something probably

17:21.420 --> 17:23.420
Similar to that

17:25.420 --> 17:29.620
Wait, why did they why did they put Fumos and milk? I

17:31.540 --> 17:32.580
Don't

17:32.620 --> 17:41.020
What's the you know, I I couldn't tell you why anybody does anything except you know for the laughs

17:43.580 --> 17:46.500
Yeah, just for the laughs for some twisted laughs

17:47.100 --> 17:50.500
Just for just for a little hee-hee hoo-hoo ha ha, you know

17:51.740 --> 17:57.500
It's a little tee-hee's a little tee-hee hee-hee's. I'm speaking of which I need a tweet hee-hee hee-hee hee's

17:58.180 --> 18:00.180
Hee-hee hee-hee

18:03.300 --> 18:05.300
Hee-hee hee-hee hee-hee hee-hee

18:05.700 --> 18:07.700
I love the out-of-pocket

18:08.540 --> 18:09.740
thumbnail

18:09.740 --> 18:11.740
My manager made for me. I

18:12.500 --> 18:16.100
Also like it. It's very different. I wasn't even gonna bother covering it up

18:16.100 --> 18:20.180
And then it's been up for a while and hasn't gotten demonetized. So it's fun

18:20.180 --> 18:26.180
Well, that's because ass and boobs is different you can have ass because no boobs butts are funny

18:26.180 --> 18:29.620
No, yeah, because I just have a front butt on my chest

18:30.140 --> 18:36.020
Yeah, you do but there's also like the risk of having like that female presenting nipple. I

18:37.860 --> 18:42.660
Couldn't have a female presenting nipple on my butt. She maybe

18:47.660 --> 18:55.900
Like a raised mole like a pimple like a butt pimple. Oh gross. No, but no butt pimples here. Please. No, thank you

18:57.460 --> 18:59.460
All right

18:59.620 --> 19:01.420
Tweeted I

19:01.420 --> 19:03.420
Forgot to tag you

19:03.580 --> 19:05.580
That's okay. I'll retweet it. I'll find it

19:07.660 --> 19:09.660
I am a mess

19:10.140 --> 19:16.620
That's okay. You're running on what an hour of sleep essentially not even more like ten minutes

19:18.140 --> 19:25.540
That's a power nap. That's like the ten minute power hour, but you know a little bit shorter than a ten minute power hour now

19:26.540 --> 19:29.020
RIP original game grumps. I know right

19:35.420 --> 19:37.420
Not the pimples

19:38.020 --> 19:43.180
Amy would love that. Yeah, cuz well though. Yeah, we like to pop zits, but I don't want one on my butt

19:43.180 --> 19:48.700
Oh, yeah, no, that's awful, but it's a popping videos are very nice

19:48.700 --> 19:50.660
I love watching pimple popping videos

19:50.660 --> 19:55.980
It's just like I could sit there for hours and just get sucked into a rabbit hole of just pimple popping videos

19:56.580 --> 19:57.820
right

19:57.820 --> 19:59.820
Yeah, do you ever just like enjoy?

20:00.820 --> 20:03.820
Looking at it like the ear wax removal ones as well

20:03.820 --> 20:08.380
I I watched it ear wax removal one the other way, but for some odd reason that

20:09.020 --> 20:16.460
Actually grosses me out a little bit, but like but which is weird cuz like I like to watch like the really like big

20:16.460 --> 20:18.460
cyst pops like the like

20:19.300 --> 20:24.380
Dr. Pimple Popper. Yeah, like the really gross one. So I don't know why ear wax just like

20:25.220 --> 20:31.900
Doesn't do it for me, but I watched your brain. Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe cuz it's yeah, it's not something

20:31.900 --> 20:34.700
It's not like being extract. Well, it is being extracted. It's not being like

20:35.380 --> 20:38.140
Pushed I don't know how to explain it. It's the act

20:38.820 --> 20:43.340
It's the act of unless it's um, I did watch one in this person

20:43.340 --> 20:46.700
Just like twirled a little tool in their ear and just like yoinked it out and I was like whoa

20:47.700 --> 20:50.740
That's really cool. I wish I could get my ears professionally cleaned

20:51.820 --> 20:54.300
You can if you get like one of those

20:55.020 --> 21:00.520
Watery things like a water pig you could just point it at your ear and you can irrigate your ear. Oh

21:01.580 --> 21:06.660
Soffeting drops boom. I feel like I would just give myself an ear infection just

21:07.620 --> 21:13.800
Somehow cuz I'm sometimes prone to those I would definitely just like end up giving myself an ear infection

21:14.600 --> 21:19.920
Honestly, I always get ear infections and I always get like sore throats at the beginning of the year

21:19.920 --> 21:23.360
No, honestly every new years. I'm like, this is the year

21:23.360 --> 21:28.320
I'm gonna ask the ask the dentist to take my tonsils out. Oh, I've asked them

21:28.320 --> 21:33.240
They said told me no cuz I have like enlarged tonsils. They're like, you know bigger tonsils than normal

21:33.240 --> 21:35.560
I'm like great yoink them out. I'm tired of them

21:36.080 --> 21:40.040
Cuz they're just like I don't know. I don't like open my mouth and I'm just like

21:41.000 --> 21:47.080
Not that they're noticeable, but like whatever I poke around in my mouth a lot. It sounds weird. I don't know

21:54.520 --> 21:57.380
You ever you ever get one of those like tonsil stones

21:58.160 --> 22:00.160
Yes, I hate them. That's yeah

22:00.480 --> 22:05.620
You're always like you're always just trying to draw it up and then like it feels like you're gagging. Yeah

22:06.500 --> 22:12.140
It's so gross, it's I hate them they smell like death smells like a dead grandma

22:12.940 --> 22:17.140
And no matter how much you brush your teeth your breath never gets any better when you have one

22:17.220 --> 22:19.980
Yeah, that's why sometimes I'll just check make sure

22:20.540 --> 22:24.500
Because my my tonsils are bigger sometimes I'll like get one and I'm like, ah

22:24.980 --> 22:29.100
No, that's why I'm just like just let me let me just like laser them off

22:29.500 --> 22:32.340
So I don't ever have to get tonsil stones ever again. Oh

22:36.620 --> 22:38.620
I forgot I was gonna say

22:40.780 --> 22:42.780
Doesn't matter

22:50.820 --> 22:52.820
I'm EP second

22:53.540 --> 22:55.540
So I'm just like what do I talk about next

22:57.340 --> 22:59.940
The infinity tonsil stones gross. Oh

23:00.660 --> 23:01.780
Oh

23:01.780 --> 23:06.340
That's like. Oh god, it's tonsil stones all the way down like

23:08.140 --> 23:14.820
But it could be worse it could be worse it could be kidney stones. That's true kidney stones are horrible. I've heard I

23:15.460 --> 23:19.940
Have never had one. They're probably all resting inside me like hidden diamonds

23:21.460 --> 23:26.020
No, then you would be be peeing just pure fire

23:27.020 --> 23:29.020
Constantly

23:29.100 --> 23:34.940
But like also I feel like you could make jewelry if you were just an infinite kidney stone source

23:36.660 --> 23:40.580
It's more like from what I've heard it's more of like a sandy

23:41.500 --> 23:44.220
Granule rather than like a stone stone

23:44.980 --> 23:49.020
Yeah, but what if you like sand it and smooth it like you get like just like a little roller

23:49.780 --> 23:51.780
Yeah, yeah

23:51.900 --> 23:55.700
Make a little kidney stone ring and then be like I want you to have this

23:56.820 --> 24:03.700
My piss buddy, my buddy and it's like this is a part of me that I'm giving to you. We are pistars and arms

24:10.540 --> 24:12.540
Yep, yep

24:13.060 --> 24:18.220
Truly truly that's how that's how we roll in this household. Hmm. I

24:18.820 --> 24:23.860
Had tonsils taking out cuz constant ear infections. Oh, that's the word. That's the worst

24:23.900 --> 24:26.780
That's why I wanted to get the cuz I also um, I

24:27.460 --> 24:30.460
Have because of inflammation in my neck for my arthritis

24:30.460 --> 24:36.380
I'm one of my eustachian tubes are always kind of like sort of blocked and I was hoping if I got my tonsil removed

24:36.820 --> 24:40.220
It would like help with that because I'm just like I feel it

24:40.220 --> 24:42.480
I'm sometimes like deaf in my right ear because I'm like what?

24:43.220 --> 24:44.820
Why I

24:44.820 --> 24:50.060
Can't hear what you're saying. It's like the weirdest feeling having your ear blocked

24:52.060 --> 25:00.380
Hi Rena, all right, I hope my art program unfreezes itself soon so I can finish saving this magnificent muppet that I've drawn

25:01.860 --> 25:03.860
It is quite gorgeous. You guys are not ready

25:05.300 --> 25:11.060
Let me go back in to share my no not share my screen. Oh wait you ended it. Oh

25:11.780 --> 25:15.780
I'm sorry. I guess. No, you're fine. You're fine. Okay

25:18.260 --> 25:20.260
I wanted to look at where you were at

25:20.900 --> 25:25.940
Oh, I finished it. You think trinket could be turned up a little bit more. I can do that for you. Whoo

25:33.780 --> 25:37.540
Someone thrown her that horn thing that people used to hear better

25:38.500 --> 25:45.060
It happens because I'm 56. That's correct. Did you know that wax candles don't work?

25:46.700 --> 25:48.700
Like what do you mean?

25:48.700 --> 25:54.740
Like there's like this old wives tale where if you put like some foil and a candle in your ear. Oh

25:55.500 --> 25:57.500
Yeah, ear candling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

25:57.940 --> 25:59.940
It doesn't do anything

26:00.500 --> 26:02.180
Have you tried it?

26:02.180 --> 26:05.100
No, I did research on it. I

26:05.580 --> 26:11.500
Swear I've done it before when I was a kid and it worked. I don't know. I kind of just been tripping as a child

26:12.460 --> 26:15.020
I mean, I'm totally delusional as children. Yeah

26:16.060 --> 26:19.340
Maybe but like I feel like I feel like

26:20.380 --> 26:22.060
Maybe

26:22.060 --> 26:24.460
Yes, I forget there is the science behind it

26:26.700 --> 26:32.300
It's the science behind it and there's it's a big scam. It's the paper cone works not wax

26:32.300 --> 26:37.260
Oh, maybe I was the paper cone that I had. Hello. Hello. Welcome in

26:41.260 --> 26:43.260
Time candles or wax play

26:46.780 --> 26:50.860
Oh, wait, nope. Oh, the monkey's here. No

26:54.300 --> 27:00.140
I was trying to do the car. Monkey jumpscare monkey monkey Muppet jumpscare. Whoops

27:02.540 --> 27:09.500
Hold on. I got I got you. I got you. I'm just waiting with excitement

27:11.260 --> 27:14.060
It's the debut everyone's been waiting for

27:21.420 --> 27:23.420
Wait

27:24.300 --> 27:27.660
Wait, hold up. Hold on. Hold on. Wait

27:28.620 --> 27:34.780
Wait, I'm fukie. Fukie hard. Hold on. I'm fukieing so hard right now. I'm fukieing my shibidi

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
so hard

27:37.740 --> 27:39.740
Okay, okay, okay, okay

27:40.300 --> 27:43.020
Okay, I think I think we got it. Yeah, blam

27:44.060 --> 27:45.740
Oh

27:45.740 --> 27:47.660
There she is

27:47.660 --> 27:49.660
She's so cute

27:51.020 --> 27:52.540
There we go

27:52.540 --> 27:54.940
I can't believe it. I'm gonna flip you

27:55.980 --> 27:57.100
um

27:57.100 --> 27:59.100
Hold on a moment

28:01.820 --> 28:06.380
30 minutes not bad. Yeah, yeah, you did that in uh, honestly a quick amount of time

28:08.780 --> 28:10.780
Poy fuked

28:11.180 --> 28:13.180
Play fuked play fuked and now

28:14.060 --> 28:16.060
I will remove my

28:17.340 --> 28:19.340
Excuse me to deform

28:19.500 --> 28:21.500
Farewell

28:24.060 --> 28:26.060
I may make you a little bit

28:28.060 --> 28:32.940
But I think I'm smaller than you you are so I'm gonna I thought as much

28:34.140 --> 28:37.500
I'm just a little just a little we look so great

28:39.420 --> 28:41.420
Just a bunch of muppets

28:43.180 --> 28:49.660
In your little hands, where's your wait, where's your other hand? It's it's it's resting. I'm tired

28:50.620 --> 28:52.620
It's resting

28:52.940 --> 28:54.060
Ah

28:54.060 --> 28:58.780
My hand's not up. I'm polite. I have my hands in a polite position because I'm a guest here

29:00.220 --> 29:03.020
Because it looks like you have two hands up your butt

29:04.060 --> 29:06.060
I might

29:11.420 --> 29:16.220
This is this is muppet time with uh trinket and sheafy

29:16.220 --> 29:24.380
We're gonna we're gonna smash and pass some balls. Yeah, okay. We already I think we already passed on this one, didn't we?

29:24.940 --> 29:27.580
Yeah, we passed on we passed on these wooden balls. Yeah

29:28.460 --> 29:32.460
The splinters aren't worth it. No, no, thank you. I'm good with that

29:32.940 --> 29:35.660
Never saw this episode of the muppets while you're about to

29:37.180 --> 29:39.180
Be the best episode you've ever seen

29:39.900 --> 29:41.900
Uh execute these are eggs

29:43.340 --> 29:45.340
How to eat them um

29:46.380 --> 29:48.940
I could I could see them being useful though

29:49.660 --> 29:55.980
You know like you could be into obvi position. I was thinking that I'm not into that but I get it

29:57.180 --> 30:02.140
Because like I've I've read I've read some I've read some mangoes in my in my history

30:03.020 --> 30:03.980
and

30:03.980 --> 30:05.980
you know

30:06.060 --> 30:08.060
Sometimes sometimes

30:08.300 --> 30:12.780
Sometimes you're just introduced a little too early to some things and they're just with you for life

30:12.940 --> 30:15.980
That's very accurate. I agree with that statement

30:17.500 --> 30:22.220
So like honestly, it's a it's a smash and eat for these. It's a smash and eat

30:22.540 --> 30:24.860
I it's it's just a pass and eat for me

30:25.580 --> 30:30.540
Do you think do you think the body has the ability to boil eggs if you like put them in there though?

30:37.580 --> 30:41.500
I don't know let's try with the chicken egg and I'll get back to you

30:43.740 --> 30:45.740
It's okay

30:45.980 --> 30:48.140
Oh my goodness body well actually

30:48.940 --> 30:51.340
No, because what's the body the body's?

30:52.220 --> 30:54.220
basal temperature

30:54.220 --> 30:56.380
Is like 97. I I bet

30:57.100 --> 30:59.100
How how much the boiling?

30:59.500 --> 31:06.140
Rate for water isn't like 110 or something Fahrenheit. So what you're telling me is we need to find a sick person

31:06.380 --> 31:08.380
Have them put the eggs up there

31:08.700 --> 31:11.820
And then have the lady eggs and then you could have like

31:12.460 --> 31:16.540
A sentry style boiled egg from another woman. That's perfect

31:17.260 --> 31:22.460
So 100 degrees Celsius. Yeah, so yeah, it's essentially what we do for like 10 to 12 minutes do that

31:23.260 --> 31:25.740
Yeah, this is an experiment that I think should actually happen

31:26.700 --> 31:28.700
It would be like a tea egg

31:29.020 --> 31:31.020
Yeah, like a little quail egg

31:31.980 --> 31:33.580
Tuck it up your butthole

31:33.580 --> 31:37.420
If any of you guys get sick with the fever, I need you to do this. Uh, this is uh

31:38.460 --> 31:41.260
This is a question. This is a request for you

31:42.620 --> 31:45.580
It takes 300 700 slaps to cook a whole chicken

31:46.620 --> 31:48.060
What?

31:48.060 --> 31:51.100
I I mean, I guess if you just keep slapping it

31:51.820 --> 31:55.340
I feel like that would have to be 700 slaps at all at once. Wouldn't it?

31:56.220 --> 32:00.940
No, no, no like seven like it the heat would build up probably maybe

32:02.140 --> 32:05.740
If I if I slap my ass 700 times

32:06.860 --> 32:08.860
You're that

32:12.780 --> 32:18.860
Can't be helped you're cooked at that point. I'm cooked. Yeah, I'm cooked so cooked. All right executor

32:21.020 --> 32:25.420
He could be cuter. He could be cuter eggs that could be cuter, you know

32:26.940 --> 32:28.940
But I like his dopey face

32:30.220 --> 32:34.060
He's got three of them. I mean I give him a smooch, but I move on

32:35.020 --> 32:36.060
Yeah

32:36.060 --> 32:40.300
Really? I definitely kiss like one of the faces. Yeah, maybe not one in the back

32:40.460 --> 32:42.460
He looks like a kisser

32:43.500 --> 32:48.700
I gave him a little smooch and I feel like he would get like bashful like uh like bashful from um

32:49.660 --> 32:51.180
the

32:51.180 --> 32:54.620
I almost said the wizard of Oz uh snow white

32:57.180 --> 33:01.820
Okay, but the apple-throwing trees in the wizard of Oz might might hit for some people, you know

33:03.260 --> 33:07.500
They definitely might definitely hit people. That's that's that's totally true

33:08.140 --> 33:10.780
Oh my gosh, I haven't seen the wizard of Oz in such a long time

33:11.580 --> 33:14.060
Uh, what about the tall boy version?

33:14.780 --> 33:16.540
Oh, that's a smash

33:16.540 --> 33:18.140
Why?

33:18.140 --> 33:19.820
I mean

33:19.820 --> 33:21.820
He's like six one

33:22.780 --> 33:24.780
I almost spit out my tea

33:26.700 --> 33:31.900
How tall is the executor elolan version he's seven feet tall he's seven throat goat

33:32.780 --> 33:34.780
Five was a dude then yes

33:35.740 --> 33:38.860
I mean are you a tree hugger trinket?

33:39.660 --> 33:45.500
I mean tree humper in nature in my nature. That's a good point. It's in my nature. That's a good point

33:49.260 --> 33:51.260
I'm gonna pass

33:51.260 --> 33:52.860
I'm gonna smash

33:52.860 --> 33:54.060
um

33:54.060 --> 33:59.100
Cubone I would just want to take care of this little cute baby. That's it. I mean he is an orphan

33:59.980 --> 34:01.980
Yeah, I'd be a good mom

34:02.940 --> 34:07.020
You would I think I I I'd you know treat him right

34:08.300 --> 34:12.780
Make sure he's not too traumatized by his mother's death and make him work stop wearing his mom's skull

34:14.220 --> 34:17.820
I you can just keep it, but like I don't want to wear it. That's that's not really good

34:18.620 --> 34:20.620
you know

34:20.620 --> 34:23.260
That's not a good healthy. No, it's not healthy

34:23.740 --> 34:25.180
But you know

34:25.180 --> 34:27.820
I have this theory about cubone. Uh-huh

34:28.540 --> 34:32.620
I think cubones like once they get over the loss of their mother become kengis kongs

34:33.260 --> 34:34.860
Oh, yeah

34:34.860 --> 34:36.380
I feel like

34:36.380 --> 34:39.500
In a distant dream. We've had this conversation before

34:40.700 --> 34:45.500
Or maybe I with a with a particular cat. I'm not sure

34:46.140 --> 34:48.140
um

34:48.700 --> 34:51.820
All right, so what would you do? I kind of want to eat it at the same time

34:52.380 --> 34:55.260
Is it messed up that I kind of want to cook it in its mom's skulls a little bowl?

34:55.260 --> 34:59.820
I mean we do the same thing with bread bowls. Exactly

35:00.620 --> 35:04.700
So like I don't see anything wrong with it. All right. Okay. I feel a little bit better about that now

35:05.340 --> 35:09.500
It's kind of like the same sort of principle. Do you feel bad when you have scrambled eggs and chicken?

35:09.980 --> 35:11.980
Oh, that's a good point

35:13.740 --> 35:15.740
I can't believe eggs are just chicken periods

35:17.020 --> 35:19.020
I think about that often

35:19.180 --> 35:24.060
It's kind of messed up sometimes you can get lucky with a double yoker. That's true

35:25.020 --> 35:27.020
That chicken would have had twins

35:29.580 --> 35:32.940
Imagine if women's eggs were that big when we had our periods

35:33.820 --> 35:39.660
God that would fucking suck. I would hate my life even more than I already do getting a period. Oh my god

35:40.380 --> 35:45.980
But what if it came out so easily like an egg like once a month like bomb actually that would be nice

35:46.540 --> 35:50.060
Because if it was if I just had to lay an egg once a month and that was all I had to do

35:50.140 --> 35:54.460
Instead of being pained for eight days and just bleed heavily then um

35:55.180 --> 35:57.180
Yeah, I'd rather lay an egg

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
And then you can eat it, right?

36:00.060 --> 36:06.220
Yeah, absolutely like almost like when pregnant women eat the prosenta. It's probably has like nutritional properties just like normal eggs

36:06.940 --> 36:09.660
Honestly, it would probably open up a new market

36:10.380 --> 36:16.700
And like there would be so less like human hunger like just get yourself a woman to lay you an egg. Yeah

36:17.500 --> 36:20.220
I feel and then yeah, the whole like egg industry

36:20.860 --> 36:24.780
Would be a very different place guys. I think we should make this happen

36:25.820 --> 36:28.060
Honestly, how do we get women to start laying eggs?

36:29.340 --> 36:31.340
Honestly new work class

36:33.980 --> 36:36.860
But then again like do they well

36:38.700 --> 36:41.660
Does the egg stay inside when when it's fertilized?

36:43.180 --> 36:45.180
Oh, that's a good point

36:46.140 --> 36:54.380
Hmm, huh. Hmm. You have to workshop that. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna pass. Uh, Marowak

37:01.500 --> 37:04.940
I'm good. I'm good. It's a pass for me. Okay

37:07.580 --> 37:12.060
This one's kind of cool looking but it's just repainted and made skinny

37:13.020 --> 37:17.260
Basically, it's slim though. Yeah, I'm Marowak but cooler

37:18.540 --> 37:20.540
Burn the work mom

37:20.860 --> 37:23.260
Yeah, yeah, he's like a little like scene kid

37:25.020 --> 37:27.820
Going through her golf girl phase before she becomes a mom

37:30.780 --> 37:32.780
Hitman Lee

37:33.420 --> 37:36.540
Man's got legs and arms no mouth though. Yeah

37:37.260 --> 37:39.740
What no mouth don't do it's kind of disappointing

37:40.460 --> 37:43.980
I mean you could still sit on the face. It'd just be more like a mutual rub

37:45.340 --> 37:48.300
You could use the you could use the legs as a grinder

37:49.260 --> 37:51.900
You could and maybe the face as a grinder

37:52.940 --> 37:57.260
He's also got fingers. That's a good point. I don't know. I just don't feel

37:57.980 --> 38:00.220
I'm not feeling anything with this, you know

38:01.100 --> 38:04.140
Yeah, there's there's not enough defining features. Yeah

38:05.020 --> 38:09.500
He's kind of like and he's kind of like a faceless man from a hentai. Yeah

38:09.980 --> 38:11.980
I

38:12.300 --> 38:14.620
Like he just needs like protagonist hair

38:15.340 --> 38:17.980
Could be like the self-insert and then you're golden

38:18.620 --> 38:20.220
For what he is

38:20.220 --> 38:25.660
But then I would if he looked more like the the faceless protagonist because the faceless protagonist

38:26.140 --> 38:30.300
Always has a mouth and like long hair covering their eyes if it was reversed

38:30.780 --> 38:32.780
I would I would then I would say yes

38:33.580 --> 38:35.580
But this is not the case so

38:36.060 --> 38:41.500
Pass he's a pass. Uh hitman chan. Hitman chance of smash. Yeah

38:42.380 --> 38:45.980
Yeah, very cute. I like their outfit. She got a little skirt going

38:48.700 --> 38:52.620
I bet I bet the I bet the third leg has a little boxing glove at the end

38:58.620 --> 39:00.620
Bro I need a drink for this

39:01.340 --> 39:03.340
Hahaha

39:04.940 --> 39:06.940
I always thought hitman chan was a girl

39:08.460 --> 39:10.620
Because it's just chan and she's wearing a dress

39:11.260 --> 39:15.020
It could be a girl or a boy. Oh, okay. I don't know. I just always saw it like that

39:15.420 --> 39:18.140
Uh, I'm just feel like I'd be kind of scared because I feel like they'll be very

39:18.540 --> 39:22.780
Fisting and if you're saying there's a little glove at the end of that then I'm even more terrified

39:23.420 --> 39:26.700
I mean, it's just it's just punching up at the inside door

39:27.580 --> 39:32.700
Yeah, my inside door just got really scared and quivered in fear

39:34.140 --> 39:36.140
They're 100 male. Okay, then I'm

39:36.380 --> 39:38.620
Riona. Yeah for yeah a little riona

39:39.340 --> 39:42.540
But I would rather like an actual fist than a glove for that

39:43.340 --> 39:44.540
You know

39:44.540 --> 39:49.180
I I would hate to think that like it has a little hand at the end of its third leg though

39:49.980 --> 39:51.980
I'd hate to think that

39:52.460 --> 39:54.460
passing

39:55.260 --> 40:02.300
Yeah, they've always been cute to me. I'm a smash hitman champ. You're gonna have okay understandable. Um look at tongue

40:03.020 --> 40:04.540
Oh, that

40:04.540 --> 40:09.020
The conversation doesn't need to be I know it's it's a no-brainer to be honest with you

40:09.900 --> 40:11.900
smash

40:13.420 --> 40:16.300
The tongue king the gluck look five thousands

40:17.100 --> 40:23.340
Throat goat throat goat, you know, probably no gag reflex because he swallows just about anything you give him precisely

40:23.420 --> 40:25.420
A call him Kirby the way he swallows

40:28.060 --> 40:30.060
Coughing

40:32.300 --> 40:34.300
That's a pass

40:34.860 --> 40:36.940
I like the pause we both had we're just like

40:38.780 --> 40:40.780
Like if I were a guy

40:41.980 --> 40:44.220
And I had like an air purifier

40:45.900 --> 40:47.900
Maybe use the holes for something

40:48.220 --> 40:49.340
Yeah

40:49.340 --> 40:50.220
Yeah

40:50.380 --> 40:55.660
Tuck a little honestly by default. No, that's a pass. Yeah, that's that's I feel like I would just die

40:55.820 --> 40:58.060
Like I something would happen and then same with wheezing

40:59.100 --> 41:02.620
I mean unless it's like that dank's uh coming out of there. No

41:03.340 --> 41:06.940
Yeah, like I just feel like it just smells like farts or it's gonna kill me so

41:07.820 --> 41:08.940
Yeah

41:08.940 --> 41:13.340
Like if he wasn't like an abuser and you could burn that that that magic leaf in him probably

41:13.340 --> 41:15.340
Yeah

41:18.060 --> 41:21.980
Now this one just looks like a gentleman who's wanting to pay for a good time

41:23.500 --> 41:25.500
Bring me your finest

41:25.740 --> 41:27.580
courtesans

41:27.580 --> 41:31.260
Like he you just see him on the street. He's got a little he's got his top hats

41:31.500 --> 41:36.620
You give him a little cane and he's like, excuse me, madam. How much for you think I've got about

41:37.020 --> 41:39.020
20 dimma dome dollars

41:39.980 --> 41:45.660
I have about 20 pounds to pound your life away if you'll have me of course

41:46.380 --> 41:47.740
um

41:47.740 --> 41:53.180
I'll pass but I would I would I would entertain him for a bit, but then I wouldn't let him hit

41:54.060 --> 41:57.820
Honestly, if he spoke to me like the high roller from sucker punch

42:00.460 --> 42:05.660
Just like sucker punch sucker punch high roller have me like yeah, john ham

42:06.620 --> 42:08.620
Cancel man john ham

42:16.540 --> 42:18.540
Yeah, what about this rocky unicorn?

42:20.940 --> 42:23.660
Uh, you know, I bet is very right horny

42:26.220 --> 42:29.980
I mean, I mean, there's there's there's three different ways to mount it

42:31.420 --> 42:33.420
Yeah, you have a lot of ridges

42:33.740 --> 42:35.420
to ride

42:35.420 --> 42:38.780
So like, you know, it's for it's for you and the besties

42:39.580 --> 42:41.580
Yeah, that's definitely like a group

42:42.620 --> 42:44.540
activity, um

42:44.540 --> 42:50.220
But like what if you're alone and it tries to sit on you or like mount you I think I would just die

42:51.260 --> 42:56.460
No, he's a he's a rock. He's a rock monster. No. Yeah, I'm gonna pass because like at some point

42:56.940 --> 42:59.740
He's gonna ask why I'm not giving

43:00.620 --> 43:05.180
And I want to be able to provide that's you know, what a good partner does, you know balance

43:05.580 --> 43:09.980
Give and take I mean you'd have to knock him on his back and like strand him like a turtle

43:10.060 --> 43:13.980
I feel like yeah, and I don't even think he could be on his back right like normally

43:14.220 --> 43:17.340
You'd have to do like sideways because his little back horn

43:17.980 --> 43:22.620
Yeah, he'd definitely freak out. Yeah, I feel like he would just not have a great time. We're just not compatible

43:23.180 --> 43:27.660
No, no, he's too big. We're too squishy. We're muppets. We're muppets

43:28.540 --> 43:30.540
Uh ride on

43:30.540 --> 43:36.300
It's kind of more doable. Yeah. Hello. It's called ride on. Why would I not ride on on the ride on?

43:37.660 --> 43:40.380
He's he's also got that physique like a dad bod

43:40.940 --> 43:42.940
You know, I like me. I like me a dad bod

43:43.340 --> 43:47.180
You know what he feels like he could be the male version of a kengis kong

43:47.820 --> 43:51.180
I always thought that I always thought he was the male version of it because they look

43:51.900 --> 43:54.380
Precisely the same minus the pouch in the color scheme

43:55.100 --> 44:01.020
Right and there's like it's almost like uh the males are smaller because the kengis kongs are quite large

44:01.820 --> 44:05.820
But then again, they're probably like in the same like egg class too. So

44:07.260 --> 44:10.620
I'll smash. What about you? I'll smash it as well. Yeah

44:11.980 --> 44:15.260
Chancey, I'm pretty sure that horn goes around and around and around

44:16.940 --> 44:21.100
Horn for days horn for days spit on that like a top

44:22.060 --> 44:24.060
Um chancey

44:25.100 --> 44:28.460
You know what? I've always been a chancey fan. Uh, she's a smash for me

44:28.780 --> 44:35.420
I was gonna it's just like would you take her egg and pop that sucker in like who's gonna give you the egg if you're sad

44:37.420 --> 44:43.660
So like if you're in a sexy situation with a chancey that thing's going probably up one of the holes

44:45.740 --> 44:50.940
And it like dissolves and it's like all glittery and then you just feel better and really happy because like

44:51.500 --> 44:54.380
That's that's what she does. She hunts you down

44:56.380 --> 44:58.380
And gives you your her egg

44:59.820 --> 45:01.420
I think

45:01.420 --> 45:06.220
I think I would sit I would eat her and I think I'll sit in the cockshare for that one

45:07.100 --> 45:09.100
Okay, because I want to see how that works out

45:10.380 --> 45:16.620
So past it would be a sweet it would be a sweet urethane. That's what yeah, that's what and I you know, I'm I kind of want to watch

45:17.180 --> 45:18.380
um

45:18.380 --> 45:22.220
But it's like it's funny because I'm on the fence if there was like a maybe I would give a maybe

45:22.940 --> 45:24.940
Like I have to be in a the right headspace

45:25.580 --> 45:26.700
uh

45:26.700 --> 45:28.700
Tangela tangela I can never pronounce

45:29.500 --> 45:31.500
Tangela tanga see I can't

45:32.540 --> 45:34.300
It's okay. It's

45:34.300 --> 45:35.820
tangela here

45:35.820 --> 45:37.820
Why she's a lady

45:39.660 --> 45:45.420
She's got that beautiful hair. Yeah, what's the consistency of uh, it's little

45:46.380 --> 45:48.380
Are they like tentacles?

45:48.540 --> 45:50.540
Or she's like a bush

45:50.540 --> 45:52.540
I'm gonna say they're like tentacles

45:52.540 --> 45:54.220
Okay

45:54.220 --> 46:01.020
And I always like imagine they're like a jelly sort of consistency. Yeah, like wishy. Yeah, because I'm like then yes

46:01.660 --> 46:03.660
I'm a fan of tentacles

46:04.140 --> 46:05.500
uh

46:05.500 --> 46:07.500
People are saying vines

46:08.300 --> 46:14.060
Are they vines? I don't know. I don't know is tank what way I know she's a plant

46:14.940 --> 46:16.940
Hold on

46:17.180 --> 46:23.340
Is tangela I can I'll answer this with a quick google search grass type. It goes our vines. Yeah

46:24.300 --> 46:30.700
I mean, I don't want vines up my Muppet Muppetissie, you know, but there's but there's no leaves

46:30.940 --> 46:32.940
So they're like perfectly smooth

46:33.100 --> 46:35.100
Uh true

46:35.980 --> 46:38.460
I'll give it a chance. I'll give it a chance

46:39.340 --> 46:41.500
You'll give them a chance because you like them a lot

46:45.020 --> 46:47.020
Uh kengish con

That's her. Yeah smash

47:10.540 --> 47:15.260
Smash and then you know, I'll take responsibility. I'll help raise this child with her

47:15.820 --> 47:19.740
You would have such a wholesome family life together. I believe

47:20.540 --> 47:23.900
You're not the stepdad. You're the dad that stepped up. Yeah

47:25.740 --> 47:27.740
That's such a good fucking line

47:30.620 --> 47:33.100
Uh the mega version where the kid

47:33.980 --> 47:35.820
is just out of the

47:35.820 --> 47:37.260
pouch

47:37.260 --> 47:39.740
You give that kid 20 to go to the movies

47:41.260 --> 47:45.340
Oh, yeah, it's me and your mom. We're gonna hang out go hang out with your friends

47:46.300 --> 47:49.820
I'm good. Don't come home for like at least three hours. Yeah, don't

47:50.620 --> 47:52.620
possibly four if we're

47:53.020 --> 47:55.260
We're up. We're trying new things. Um

47:55.980 --> 47:59.980
We're playing new games. Don't worry about it kiddo. Here's some here's some pizza money

48:00.460 --> 48:02.460
Go to the arcade

48:03.260 --> 48:06.940
And then you're you're just you're just in the bedroom you're playing smash on switch

48:08.140 --> 48:10.780
We just didn't want the kid to interrupt

48:12.940 --> 48:14.300
Uh

48:14.300 --> 48:16.300
Horses for the male gaze

48:16.460 --> 48:19.100
However, remember that one toy

48:20.700 --> 48:24.300
This the sucker toy does this because can horsey also suck

48:25.180 --> 48:27.980
Yeah, because I feel like it would be like one of those little

48:30.140 --> 48:37.100
Like a little as long vibrator toy like a rose as long as it has like an any and any option and not

48:37.260 --> 48:40.860
Like an outie only option with just the bubbles

48:42.700 --> 48:45.740
Because like the last thing you want to do it is blow in

48:47.340 --> 48:49.340
Yeah

48:49.500 --> 48:53.180
Like I wouldn't I would just it would primarily be used for down there

48:54.140 --> 48:55.180
Yeah

48:55.180 --> 48:58.780
Or nipples or yeah or nipple. Yeah a little bit of

48:59.980 --> 49:01.980
Muppet nipple

49:03.500 --> 49:05.500
Felt up if you know what I mean

49:06.220 --> 49:12.620
Oh, I get it because of the material. Yeah, you got it. I got it. I'm so smart

49:14.540 --> 49:16.540
Um, so I will say

49:16.540 --> 49:18.540
smash for horsey

49:18.700 --> 49:21.980
I'm I'm also gonna have to go with smash for this one. Okay

49:22.620 --> 49:24.620
But again, if I was a man, then I would

49:25.180 --> 49:30.300
This would be a no brainer. That's a hole every hole's a goal if I was every hole's the goal

49:30.780 --> 49:32.780
Even even coffings

49:33.500 --> 49:35.500
Um

49:36.780 --> 49:41.580
For cedra though, I feel like it wouldn't be as good

49:42.780 --> 49:44.780
Because so many harsh edges

49:45.580 --> 49:49.020
Too sharp. Yeah, I don't feel like I would be able to get a good grip

49:50.380 --> 49:51.980
Well, you could definitely get a good grip

49:51.980 --> 49:56.460
But I feel like once you were done and like you were in bed not cuttable. Yeah

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
You roll over that thing you're impaled

49:59.740 --> 50:00.860
Yeah

50:00.860 --> 50:06.620
And not like in the good way obviously sliced up on like sandpaper like scales or something

50:08.300 --> 50:10.620
Yeah, too aggressive. I'm gonna say pass

50:11.340 --> 50:13.340
Pass sorry cedra

50:13.580 --> 50:14.860
Goldeen

50:14.860 --> 50:19.260
That's a no brainer right there. That's for everybody. That's for everybody

50:19.900 --> 50:21.900
It's got two e's for everyone

50:22.060 --> 50:24.060
I

50:25.500 --> 50:29.980
Ready to eat you for everyone. I mean so good they put it in twice

50:32.540 --> 50:35.500
All right, we are fucking the goldfish smash

50:37.020 --> 50:40.380
How see king I don't like the teeth. No, no pass

50:41.980 --> 50:49.660
Pass down. It's a downgrade. Yeah, be careful. Be careful who you call cute in high school. They might just never glow down

50:50.060 --> 50:52.060
I

50:52.300 --> 50:54.300
star

50:56.460 --> 50:58.300
I mean

50:58.300 --> 51:00.300
I'm robbing it. Yeah

51:01.420 --> 51:03.820
I would definitely rob this thing. Um

51:05.740 --> 51:07.740
I'm like wondering if

51:10.940 --> 51:13.740
You could like put little things on each of its little hands

51:15.820 --> 51:17.820
They use it as like a multi-use toy

51:18.140 --> 51:20.640
You definitely could

51:22.620 --> 51:24.620
Yeah, but like it would just be

51:25.820 --> 51:27.820
But then again, it's a fucking starfish

51:28.780 --> 51:36.060
Like at that point you might as well just get yourself something fake and not a living creature. Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm thinking like

51:38.140 --> 51:40.140
It's a pass. Yeah, I'm gonna pass

51:40.780 --> 51:47.180
Sorry star you star me same thing. I'm robbing it robin robin. You're robbing it. Oh by the way if you're new here

52:34.300 --> 52:36.300
That's just how we are

52:36.300 --> 52:40.860
I mean, that's just the nature of things you see a muppet. You're wondering if that muppet's gonna smash a pokemon

52:41.100 --> 52:45.100
Or pass it or eat it because I imagine if there's a muppet pokemon

52:47.500 --> 52:50.860

52:51.580 --> 52:53.100
Mimmy no

52:53.100 --> 52:56.300

52:57.020 --> 52:58.700
Yeah, well

52:58.700 --> 53:03.580
Or or like a bat or or what's that? What's that one doll called the one with the zipper mouth?

53:04.140 --> 53:06.140
I know exactly which one you're thinking about

53:06.220 --> 53:11.420
It's like a little yeah, oh my god, you're right. It would be like a little puppet

53:12.700 --> 53:15.340
Or just shop it. Thank you. Thank you, heebie-teebie

53:15.980 --> 53:17.980
Yeah, but that or shop it. Yeah

53:17.980 --> 53:19.340
Yeah

53:19.340 --> 53:27.260
Dog and bunny muppet duo doing smash or pass pokemon. It's quite the the time the an interesting timeline

53:29.580 --> 53:34.540
Um, but yeah, I hope you stick around like comment and subscribe

53:36.140 --> 53:39.180
I almost said Jenna marbles line. I put out new videos every Wednesday

53:40.060 --> 53:43.660
I miss her. I miss her so much. I miss her

53:44.860 --> 53:48.700
Not the internet for running off a very wholesome woman. I know

53:49.340 --> 53:54.620
She was my comfort comfort youtuber and watch. I know I love nasty boy kermit

53:56.700 --> 53:59.660
Oh, and I want to go back and like watch some of her old videos after this

54:00.380 --> 54:01.980
I'll save

54:01.980 --> 54:03.980
All right, mr. Mime

54:04.700 --> 54:09.180
Okay, so I have very complex emotions about mr. Mime. Please elaborate

54:09.980 --> 54:16.140
Okay, so there's a comic that's on tumblr where they talk about the logistics of eating mr. Mime

54:16.540 --> 54:18.540
And that has been with me for years

54:18.780 --> 54:22.780
Look, why do I feel like I've heard this before? Oh, yeah, ash's dad is the

54:23.660 --> 54:24.860
also the

54:24.860 --> 54:27.100
Also ash's dad. Yeah, I mean

54:27.580 --> 54:33.740
I don't mind sharing with ash's mom because she's she herself seems like a bit of a freak who would share mr. Mime

54:33.980 --> 54:35.740
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

54:35.740 --> 54:37.740
And also he is a definite smash

54:39.580 --> 54:41.580
Um, I'm good

54:42.060 --> 54:45.180
I feel like I feel like his fingers would be like sticky

54:45.900 --> 54:50.700
I just think of mr. Mime from the live action pokemon movie and he was terrifying

54:51.580 --> 54:55.100
I don't I don't I'm not I'm not envisioning real life pokemon

54:55.100 --> 55:00.780
I'm envisioning cute 2d once because we're too. I know 2d muppet girls. I'm just I'm just

55:01.740 --> 55:06.140
I'm just uh traumatized from live action mr. Mime

55:07.660 --> 55:15.420
And also uh like clefable or clefairy, whichever one it was. No, it was jigglypuff. Those things were freaking terrifying for that movie

55:15.980 --> 55:21.660
Everything in that movie was freaking terrifying. It really was uh clowns sometimes scare me as well. So

55:22.620 --> 55:23.660
Aw

55:23.660 --> 55:25.660
Not even actually it's like they

55:26.540 --> 55:29.100
They're unnerving. I just think of john wane gasey

55:30.060 --> 55:31.900
Oh

55:31.900 --> 55:34.700
I feel like I feel like mr. Mime would gasey some

55:36.380 --> 55:38.460
Some in uh innocence. So

55:41.020 --> 55:42.380
Man

55:42.380 --> 55:47.020
I'm not I'm not that caught up on my true crime. I wish I knew more about I never

55:47.660 --> 55:49.660
Please don't

55:49.900 --> 55:51.500
It's bad

55:51.500 --> 55:54.140
Fair enough. Um, I'm gonna pass

55:55.020 --> 55:59.900
Like what's your opinion on people who actually have it for the new it clown and not the old it clown

56:00.460 --> 56:02.460
That's so funny to me because like I

56:03.500 --> 56:05.740
I've seen it like I like understand it

56:06.300 --> 56:08.940
Again, sometimes when I'm really scared of something

56:09.660 --> 56:14.780
I'll sexualize it. So I'm just like I'm gonna trick myself into being horny for it

56:15.180 --> 56:19.420
And so I did do that with pennywise at some point and so now I'm not scared of pennywise

56:20.380 --> 56:27.500
That's fair, but I mean, how could you not look at that clown and think damn that head that head is totally okoteer

56:29.260 --> 56:31.580
I could sell ad space on that clown's head

56:32.620 --> 56:34.620
Make a million dollars

56:35.740 --> 56:37.740
I'm just terrifying

56:37.820 --> 56:43.420
Innocent children. They're just like, what's this weird ad placement on this head? Now. I want to buy a box of pop-tarts crazy

56:44.060 --> 56:49.020
Um, yeah, joes. Where where's the address? Oh, there it is. It's right underneath the advertisement

56:49.820 --> 56:51.820
Oh

56:53.340 --> 56:55.340
Seven head um

56:56.540 --> 57:00.860
Okay, what about the the galar version? I'm robbing it

57:01.660 --> 57:07.100
I mean, he looks so fashionable. Look at that drip. He's iced out

57:08.380 --> 57:10.380
He's got his yee yees on

57:11.260 --> 57:13.260
He's on

57:17.420 --> 57:19.740
I'm gonna pass. I kind of he's just so he's just cute

57:21.100 --> 57:25.420
Yeah, I like his little shoes. I just want to rob him and just be like go on your way

57:26.540 --> 57:28.780
Like you're gonna steal his shoes. Yeah

57:29.820 --> 57:35.740
I I feel like I'm obligated to smash if you're just gonna take his shoes. I'm gonna take his shoes in the jam on his chest

57:36.700 --> 57:40.700
All right, then it'll it'll be a smash and grab. You smash. Yeah, smash and grab

57:41.340 --> 57:45.260
By the way, we do a smash pass eat and rob

57:46.460 --> 57:49.740
By the way for ours, uh smash passes for these pokemon

57:49.740 --> 57:52.620
So sometimes people decide to eat these like because I would definitely eat him too

57:53.580 --> 57:55.580
He looks like he would taste like ice cream

57:56.060 --> 58:00.860
He looks really sweet like a blueberry taste good like blue raspberry icy

58:02.380 --> 58:04.380
Very I'm also eating him now

58:05.740 --> 58:08.460
That's fair. My cat's food is going off

58:10.780 --> 58:12.780
That's okay. Sorry

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
Well, they gotta eat they do

58:16.460 --> 58:20.540
I just have to announce it every time so people don't think there's like gunfire in the background

58:23.420 --> 58:26.540
But fireworks are still existent. That's true

58:28.940 --> 58:30.940
Oh, yeah, the fireworks will be on

58:31.260 --> 58:33.980
The 13th for me. So I can't wait to be fighting

58:34.860 --> 58:36.860
In the trenches when that happens

58:37.180 --> 58:38.700
Oh my god

58:38.700 --> 58:40.700
My heart goes out to you

58:41.580 --> 58:44.060
My cats do not have a good time. Um

58:45.100 --> 58:47.100
cypher

58:47.500 --> 58:49.020
Okay, but

58:49.020 --> 58:51.980
He he kind of he kind of hot. I was gonna say smash

58:52.780 --> 58:54.700
Yeah, a little bit of knife play

58:55.500 --> 59:00.860
Yeah, put hold hold those little danger hands up to your throat and go at it

59:01.100 --> 59:03.100
Yeah

59:04.620 --> 59:06.620
If precisely smash

59:07.180 --> 59:09.180
Everyone's everyone's just like, yeah

59:09.660 --> 59:12.220
There's some loud eaters. Can you hear them eating?

59:14.380 --> 59:16.700
I mean kind of jealous. I don't think so

59:18.300 --> 59:20.300
They do much very loudly my cats

59:20.300 --> 59:22.300
Uh jigs

59:22.780 --> 59:24.780
Uh smash

59:26.380 --> 59:28.700
Jeans herself is a queen so I don't

59:29.660 --> 59:34.140
I'll yeah, I don't know she has them perfect if I was a dude

59:35.180 --> 59:37.180
She is perfect blowjob lips

59:37.900 --> 59:42.300
Not only that she's got canonical titties. Yeah, she literally

59:43.740 --> 59:45.740
I wonder what she looks like

59:47.500 --> 59:51.580
Like what's her body type under that like what are her legs look like I wonder

59:52.780 --> 59:54.780
Probably cute, right

59:54.860 --> 59:58.380
Like like maybe like she's a little chubby chubby guy

59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.780
Little chubby lady. Maybe

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:08.220
And and like not only that like her wig is on point. She is she it's it's there snatch

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.260
The lace is laid. Yeah

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.900
Yeah, the original this was just a lovely little uh

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.180
African uh

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:35.980
No, you're right, but like mr. Popo was like the same way so we can't really be mad at it because we like dragon balls

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.460
E

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.820
Yeah, mr. Popo never changed nothing

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:45.820
I ain't made mr. Popo purple. Yeah, Mr. Popo stayed black

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.020
He was black

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.780
I'm not gonna lie. I do love mr. Popo and dragon balls either you bridged. Oh, yeah

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.940
I have to watch it again. I don't remember what the

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:07.900
This uh voices were because I remember cracking up. I used to watch that in young justice abridged. Oh my god

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:15.740
Oh, I might recommend watching a sword art online the abridged as well. Oh my god. I'm so watching

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:22.460
Says it made me actually like sword art online because I did not like sword. I don't like sword art online

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.820
And this will make you like it. Okay, perfect

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.300
Wasn't jinx based on a japanese mountain yokai with black skin and large lips?

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:35.020
Yes, probably a hundred percent because all the pokemon are based off of like yokai

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.180
and

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:41.020
animals and animals and just like japanese demons and stuff

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.340
And uh mystical creatures so a hundred percent. That's definitely it

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.300
But it just it just looks funny

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.300
Hahaha

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.660
Electabuzz

01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:01.980
Do you think he could do that? I think he can I think he can localize his his electrical flow

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.660
I just don't like his face

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.060
You know what I've always wondered is he like a tiger? I don't know

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.820
I generally don't know because I can't like he has like fuzzy arms

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.260
But the rest of him isn't fuzzy and I don't think he's a bee. No

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.580
Yeah, but he's like

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.820
he's like a

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.060
Bee dinosaur tiger

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:35.260
I'm I'm still a smash though. Yeah

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.420
Because he's got handlebars on his head. He does

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:47.100
Maybe he's got really soft-looking arms like really powerful arms as long as his teeth

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:53.260
Don't nip at me and actually no, you know, never mind. I don't mind a little bit, but you know, I just said for

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.300
Scyther

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.300
So I I'm not I'm not scared

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.100
Um, so yeah, I guess I'll smash

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.300
Yeah, definitely a definite smash there. Yeah

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.420
He's a mix of an oni and a tiger. Oh

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:13.500
Oh, okay. See that makes sense. That makes sense to me. I get it now. Uh booty cheek head

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.180
Pass pass

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.940
He's just always gonna have that stupid look on his face

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.740
pincer

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:32.460
That's a pass for me. Yeah, I'm I always think of fucking earwigs when I look at a pincer and I hate those bugs

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.540
Now if you had said like hair across we are not there yet

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.580
But we're

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.580
Pincer mega no same thing. No, no

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:51.500
Magmar is good for hot talking. I'm not a dude. So again, I have a penis envy for some of these pokemon

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.140
Yeah, so I can't use them in the same way

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:58.380
Uh toros

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.620
um

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.180
This one's hard. I'd probably die

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.900
Because that's just a bull

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:09.900
It is but if I'm a pup I'm a muppet then I could probably take it

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:17.340
Yeah, definitely because like that's how they that's how they breed the cows. Yeah

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:25.420
You know what I'm gonna say smash, you know, I'll I will too. I'm curious. Yeah

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.420
Yeah

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.500
Take the bull by the horns you got it

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:44.220
Agmar is good for hiding stuff. There's a scene where magmaru hands you a nice toasty pokeball he retrieved from somewhere warm

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.100
Oh god, he folded out his ass. Uh magic heart

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.780
Smash

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.300
Magic heart

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.300
Yeah, why?

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:03.740
Okay, so like it's gonna sound really weird, right? Okay, but

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:10.940
First of all, he's really hard and rigid and you can't eat him because they've already confirmed that in the anime

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:16.140
But like he does the only thing he does is splash which means he's gonna be moving

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:23.580
And like his mouth is the perfect size to like latch on to you like one of those said toys. Okay

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.540
I feel like with the splash though

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.260
It'd be just too much wetness

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.300
Like it would be uncomfortable

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:37.580
Nah, it'd be fine. It'd be fine. Definitely would have to lay a tarp down

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:43.500
Well, yeah, but like none of these are gonna be clean. It's pokemon. That's a good point

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:50.620
I'm gonna pass because I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face having that thing latched on to my

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:58.540
Muppet that's part of the experience. You gotta you gotta bully the fish. So he gets the anger so he can become the next one

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.940
Because we all know that the next one is what we all want

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.220
I'm terrified. No, I'm not

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.260
I can't

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.100
You really?

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.020
I don't know

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.220
I mean, it might be too big. I don't think I could handle it

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:30.540
You could take it. You could take it. You can definitely take it. I'll try. I'll take it. I'll smash

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.380
Yeah, it garrados is like a smash and even then you don't even have to be on the underside

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:40.780
You could be on top because like he doesn't need anything. Yeah

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:49.020
I'm sure it's like the same logic of salmon spawning where like you like your eggs and he comes and he fertilizes

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:55.740
And you just go on about your business. But this time you're just on the back riding. That's a good point. Okay

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.420
This one's too much though. That one's a lot too much

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:04.220
It's very goofy. It looks like they just smack the head onto like a smaller fish

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.340
Every time I see this one

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.460
It's a pass uh lapras smash smash. Look at that fucking face

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.020
She's so pretty

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.300
So pretty

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.540
The little seductive gays. Are you kidding me?

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:23.820
Easy smash and she she just looks caring. I'll put on a strap for her

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.860
Well, she looks at me while I hit it from behind

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.220
I'd be under the water for her. I'd take it. Yeah

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.700
Yeah, yeah

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.220
smash

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.220
Yeah

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:42.300
Giganta max I thought there was a cruise ship on her back for a second. Um

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:48.060
That's just a giant version. Yeah, you'll risk it for the biscuit. I can't it's too big

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.340
I'll be crushed. My muppet body would be

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.540
Destroyed

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.820
You know, I I have I have no qualms

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:05.180
Against uh, this this lovely lady letting me be under her flippers. Okay. All right

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.100
Moving forward ditto

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.300
Smash smash. Obviously ditto is always an obvious smash

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:19.020
Yeah, obviously like ditto can be your wildest dreams or your blandest. Yeah, exactly

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:24.700
Depending on how safe you want to be. Yeah, you can go really vanilla. You can get really dark with it

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.260
Ditto's there for you

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.060
Yeah, you know, you know, just ditto man ditto

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.620
God, now I'm thinking about the pokemon

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:38.860
Movie like the detective pikachu one. We just find out like the guys that have been like with the guy

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.060
We're just dittos. Yeah

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.060
I

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:49.980
Evie

01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:01.100
I'm gonna say pass for evie. Yeah, it's a it's a baby. You gotta get to the evolutions. Yeah

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.580
That one's like a fluffy one. It's very cute

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.580
Big boy. I want to pet its fluff, but I wouldn't

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.540
I wouldn't do that

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.540
It looks mischievous too

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.860
Like he knows he knows what he's doing

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:24.540
Uh, vaporeon is an obvious smash for me because we all know vaporeon is the most breedable pokemon of all the uh

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:30.940
All the evolutions so of course the most compatible with the human physiology both man and woman. Yeah

01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.820
So that's a smash

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.780
I

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:38.860
Uh jolteon

01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:42.540
Honestly, I've never been that fan much of a fan of jolteon

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:49.660
I like jolteon, but not like that. I always thought jolteon was like I I remember I have to have a jolteon on my team

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.460
When I would play but not not like that

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:58.380
I would chew on a jolteon toy growing up because it was made out of that good rubber. Ooh

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.260
That good rubber that good good

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.260
But but it's but it's a pass. Yeah, I'll pass

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.660
flaryon

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.660
pet smash smash. Yeah

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.740
smash

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.740
I'm passing on flaryon

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.100
That's fine, but like he's so fluffy. He's fluffy. I just pet him

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.340
That was a little fluffy boy. It's one of touches little little feets

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.900
I feel that but like I I see a personal bed warmer

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:32.060
It's never cold. That's very true, but what if you get too hot?

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.100
I can always take the blankets off. Okay

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.020
Can we even feel heat as puppets?

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.660
Yeah

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.660
When we get too hot we're on fire

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.380
I look over and look at the poory gone just like here

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.100
right after the evolutions

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.380
That always cracks me up

01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.220
So not this poory gone, but definitely the poory gone too

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:03.260
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna pass on this one

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.820
uh

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.580
Omenite

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:14.140
That's a smash. It's a smash. I've always thought omenite was really cute. It looks like a little mustachioed man

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.820
Right. He's so cute. He's so cute

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.260
I love him. I would probably eat him as well

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.260
Oh

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:30.380
I remember lord helix. So like were you familiar with twitch plays pokemon like four million years ago?

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.140
No

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:36.220
Explain, so what what it was is on twitch. There was a stream

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:42.220
Where twitch chat was playing pokemon one line at a time basically one chat line at a time

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.700
Oh my god

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.420
They beat the game and like one of them was

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.620
A helix because they had the helix fossil

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.900
It was it was absolutely amazing. That is pretty sick

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.100
Uh almost star

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.580
No, I don't like the I'm I like tentacles, but I don't like the beak

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:13.020
I don't like the beak. I don't like the shell the eyes freak me out. Yeah, and I'm I'm okay with that

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.580
I'm I'm that's a no. Thank you

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.620
Uh

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:22.540
Kabuto

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.860
I've never liked him neither have I I also just think of kabuto from naruto. So

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.540
There was a guy in naruto named kabuto

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.940
Was there or was it something else? I'm pretty sure there was

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.140
Hell if I know chat helped

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.060
I don't yes. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:47.100
And it's funny because he pushes up his glasses and his eyes look like that

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.540
So I always I always think it's funny

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.580
Yeah, the white haired guy

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.580
I always I thought he was cute

01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:58.300
Because I like his little glasses and his glasses would glint

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:04.060
I got you. He's doable from naruto though. Yeah, I agree with that statement. Um

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.420
Pass kabutops

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:10.060
That's a smash

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.980
Uh

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.980
I don't want to be topped by kabutops

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.340
Uh, I feel like we would

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.620
I just don't think we're compatible

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.620
with my with my dom

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.380
You know

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.980
I don't know. I think he might take a pigging if he was just fim dom him hard enough

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.100
You know just girl boss harder. This girl boss harder

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:38.060
Just girl boss harder because like he's basically scyther. Yeah, no wings. No wings. That's that's a good point

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.420
Ah

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.740
And plus like if you just chain his little like

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:50.380
Scythe sysicles like in front of him then like all he's got to do is move his back back legs

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:56.540
All right, and then yeah, yeah, you have that you have that action pump action going on

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:05.980
Just gonna hog tie up this kabutops this kabutops is getting topped. All right, I'll smash

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.940
Yeah

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:11.340
Rip you in half from a hug

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.260
aerodactyl

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.340
Okay, this one actually pisses me the fuck off. I hate its face so much

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.580
I hate him

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:24.780
But like not just because of the way he looks that episode of pokemon pissed me the fuck off

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:32.300
Where ash gets like abducted by the aerodactyl and he tries to tell people. Yeah, that was me and nobody fucking believes him

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.180
This motherfucker

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:41.580
Like no one will believe you get abducted by an aerodactyl because look how goofy that thing looks

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:49.420
But then again, like nobody ever believes ash when he when he tries to count his adventures. I think he just gave up

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.540
That's very accurate. I think he just yeah

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:58.060
He just is like this came to terms that he's forever a child and no one will ever believe anything he ever says

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:04.780
Like his very first adventure like he can't tell anyone that he was the kid who saved the world because of you two and mew

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.860
Felt so fucking bad for him

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.500
Like throwing himself into like a pokemon battle

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:14.540
And then like when they meet mew two again, it's like, oh, this is our second time eating

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.260
It's like I have no memory of the first time. It's like

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.900
Oh my god

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.460
Sorry, I didn't mean to go off on a little rant there

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:33.580
No, I love your little rant. It's perfect. I hate aerodactyl. I bet you'll hate aerodactyl mega even more

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.260
He looks like a gross dude with a goatee that would like

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.140
Have a weird van

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.140
and always smell like piss

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:52.380
He looks like that bad dragon from like, uh, what was that movie dragon heart?

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.020
Oh

01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:00.140
From dragon heart. I hate it. I thought you meant bad dragon and I like like in the toy and I was very confused

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.260
Not a bad dragons are okay, but this one is a bad bad dragon. Oh my god

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:10.140
Yeah, the drag I haven't watched dragon heart in a long time. Holy crap. Everybody used to love that movie

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:17.020
Oh, I distinctly watching that distinctly remember my heart is well protected

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:25.820
So pass, uh, snorlax smash smash

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.740
smash

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.740
You got the nice little

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.060
old chubby boy

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.060
perfect for snuggling

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:39.900
He is he's so good. He's like you're but he's your lazy fuck. Yeah

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.460
Yes

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.620
That's literally me

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.660
Not eating this one now. I wouldn't eat snorlax

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:56.380
He's like totoro. Yeah. Oh, I want to smash totoro though

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.380
I'll smash snorlax

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:04.780
I mean, he's not totoro, but he's like totoro. He's like sexy totoro

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:11.420
Sexy totoro. Yeah, look at his sexy gaze with his eyes half closed

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:17.740
Look, it took this man over like 10 years to stand up. I'm not I'm not gonna say that he's not sexy

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.380
Yeah, and I can you can just ride him

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:23.340
And just you know do whatever you want

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.220
Of course. Yeah

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.220
Yeah, smash. Yeah. Yeah

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.580
Uh

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.380
That's a tree. Where's his face?

01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:41.900
Where's the gigantic max? He's just gone. He's just he's laying down again. He's tired. He got up

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.700
When you when you smash the first time and he's like

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:52.540
He's like just do do what you want pick an apple walk walk the bushes

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.460
I'll definitely pick an apple. I'm so I'm eat. I guess I'll eat him

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:04.300
You'll eat from him. Yeah, I'll eat the produce of his long eats

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.220
I don't know. I feel like it's still a smash. I feel all right to use. I feel like you could use his

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.500
Snorlax

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.180
his his

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:20.060
What what am I thinking of Snorlax sack as like a beanbag chair sort of situation? No

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.940
Like it's sort of a micro

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.300
macro sort of situation. Yeah, it's very like giant

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.100
Giantess

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.100
Yeah, except he

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.180
Except he's like the giant. Yeah

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.780
And it's more chill

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.340
It is definitely a lot more chill and you could take a stroll in his gardens afterwards

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.140
Yeah, air air yourself off

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.740
Air yourself off. You're just like a wet

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.740
Muppet yeah

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.740
He just here just like plop as every time you move

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:02.220
It's like just wet fabric as you're going up the sidewalk his treasure trail

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.100
Oh my god

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.140
I like how he does like have a happy trail technically

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.220
See

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:14.060
If he wasn't they knew what they were doing when they designed them

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.180
I'm still gonna pass I'm gonna smash

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.580
Okay

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:27.500
This is a bird. This is a bird. I'm eating it. I'm eating past the bird pass

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.700
However

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.100
This one

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.380
Like

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:40.700
Don't get me wrong. I'm sure regular articuno is like the equivalent of eating cold fried chicken, which is delicious

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:48.860
But this one this one's more smashable because of like that's just the just the that's the cunty energy that it's the aura

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.900
He's serving a very tuxedo mask

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.660
I'm gonna yeah, I'll smash I'll smash this bird

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:03.260
Like if it if articuno galer was like a bunny, this is what harlott's final form would probably have

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.660
Oh my god, you're so great actually

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.220
That would be so true

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.220
They do have the same air of it as a harlot

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.460
um

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:14.380
Zaptos

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:17.980
Look at those drumsticks good for dipping and mashed potatoes

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:21.180
I'm having that with honey mustard

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.020
Eating this. Oh, yeah

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.340
Passing and eating passing and eating

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:29.260
Okay, but zaptos galer

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.900
Hello

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:36.300
These thickums I still want to eat him. He looks like spicy chicken

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:44.060
I think I'd smash him. Yeah, the the spice would be fun to deal with but probably would hurt a little bit. Yeah

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.060
Do you would it be spicy when you copulate?

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.900
God, what if it is

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:55.660
I just feel like I would just be burned like that's why it's hard for me

01:20:56.620 --> 01:21:01.660
To think that way about fire type pokemon because i'm like I feel like they're just too warm

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:04.060
Sometimes

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:09.740
I think I would burn myself and it's a little cloaca. I'm sure if you use like protection it would be fine

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.540
spicy turkey

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.700
He gained seasoning um

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:19.900
I'll eat him

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.220
All right

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:25.580
Moltres, uh again spicy chicken. I'll eat that

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:30.780
I never liked Moltres. He was always ugly. Yeah, I never liked Moltres either

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.660
However

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.700
The glare version

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:46.300
He's very pretty very pretty but he kind of looks like a dick

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:51.740
Yeah, like he's got ass hole vibes. Yeah, he's fuck boy energy

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:53.660
He does

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.820
I'm gonna pass but he's pretty to look at

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.900
He is I I keep him in a gilded cage. Yes

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.620
We'll steal him. We're robbing him like his actual self

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.340
Yeah

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.340
Uh dratini

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.340
So

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:14.700
Dratini's are really cute. That's what these are so cute

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.420
That's a worm

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.380
That's a little guy. It's a little worm guy

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.180
I'm gonna pass

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.180
I'm passing

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:30.540
Don't you dare leave him alone. We're passing everybody. Relax dragon air

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:33.340
That's a smash. That's a smash

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:37.980
Dragon air has always been a beautiful lady. Oh, yeah, I I remember

01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.060
being young playing pokemon

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.540
And just

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.180
Intensely looking at dragon air and wanting a dragon air so bad

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:54.540
Because like not only does it have like three gems that you can touch

01:22:55.420 --> 01:23:02.460
Together, right? It's got beautiful winged ears beautiful and it's just long and smooth. Yeah

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:07.660
Everything I feel like it'll be really good for snuggling like you can just like coil up with it

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:13.900
Mm-hmm, and then yeah, I bet like the tail is very prehensile prehensile and it can control it pretty well

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.900
So it just like pump in and out

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.100
Yeah

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:21.900
Yeah, I'm I'm really feeling dragon air 100 percent always. Yep

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:26.780
Dragonite dragonite. We gotta have words, buddy. I don't

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.500
What happened?

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:35.660
What happened man? You had two you you were winning you were winning two. I feel like I got catfish

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.900
like

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.660
Why why does he turn orange? I never got that

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:47.020
Why is he not like a beautiful blue dragon?

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.300
I know it bothers me like a like a nice

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.340
almost like almost like Gyarados

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.660
type dragon

01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.660
But a lot smoother and like winged

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:03.340
Like there there should be an alternate reality where dragonite looks more like it's dragon air self

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:10.460
Yeah, like I don't care how they do it put it put dragonite in another like

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:17.420
Like a country like galare and give him an alternate form make him blue

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.340
make him

01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:25.580
Like beautiful because he deserves to be beautiful instead of a Barney look at motherfucker

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:31.100
I would give him a hug though. I would I would hug him. He's cute, but annoying

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:33.740
pass

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.740
Mewtwo

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.060
Mewtwo looks like a lush vibrator

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:43.260
Honestly, he do he look like he look like a lush three

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.900
Like he's he's strapped in he's ready for you

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.940
Oh, that makes a lot of sense

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:55.020
So do you see the comment in the chat?

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:59.580
Oh, which one there's a theory that dragonite and Gyarados got swapped during development

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:04.620
Gyarados would have been dragon airs evolution the blue dragon dragonite would have been magic harps evolution

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.660
The color scheme makes sense

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.540
Yeah, I don't like it though. Yeah

01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.620
I don't like it

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.660
Love sense looking motherfucker. Yeah, I would smash Mewtwo

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.260
I would too

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.020
He's skilled with his hands too. Yeah, and he's a psychic type so

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:26.300
Really put my brain to work

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:30.780
Um, it's called a dragonite a Barney look at it

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:38.140
They should have done better. They should have done better all those years ago and we wouldn't have called him a Barney looking motherfucker

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.380
Mew or Mewtwo in terms of like power

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.700
I'll be

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.700
Isn't that Mew? Yeah, Mew

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.700
Because Mew is older than Mewtwo. Mewtwo's a baby. Yeah

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.820
Mewtwo mega

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.820
I always like the design of this but I don't

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:59.100
Like it

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.100
Like that I

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:05.660
I don't know. It's a little weird for me. Yeah

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.060
Okay pass um mega x

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:22.700
I mean it's just a smaller tail and like more broader shoulders and arms

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:27.180
He looked like he stand on business though. Like he can really plant himself

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.900
Really really mating press

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:38.140
Just really get in there. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I'll I'll say

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.260
Yeah

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.660
I'll smash

01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.260
You know what?

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:48.780
If I could see him from behind because I'm sure he's got a like a big back porch

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:51.500
I'm gonna say yeah. Yeah, okay

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.980
Smash

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:55.100
Smash

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:57.100
Um Mew

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:01.740
This is a mouse. You're a smash Mew. Yeah, I'm a smash Mew. Also

01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:08.380
Also, I figured Mew was always a cat. That's why it was Mew. Oh, that's a good point

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:18.300
It just looks like a mouse to me Mew is another of all pokemon forms aside

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.580
Good point

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:26.140
Besides like

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.380
even even though like

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:33.420
Like if we're just talking like pokemon wise the moveset that Mew has

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:38.620
Probably way better than Mew two for smash it. Yeah

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:43.260
I just also the tail the tail looks way more

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:48.700
Like human body anatomy muffin friendly. You're right

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.580
So like you just can't

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.620
Those little arms. It's also just too cute

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.860
Well, I could hug it. I don't need it to hug me

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:05.580
I was like, it's a little paw paws. It's so cute. I can't I like the world something so cute

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.780
Mew is a fetus

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:12.620
Ah

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.620
Well, if I guess I'm looking at it like a fetus, I guess I'd eat it more than I would

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.180
I'd eat a fetus

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.020
I mean, it's just under cooked meat

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:26.460
Yeah, that's a good point

01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:29.180
Um chikorita

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:33.260
Uh canonical first yandere of the pokemon series

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:36.460
I would eat chikorita

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:41.180
I want animation. I think of someone like cooking a chikorita. I was like that looks delicious

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.820
So do you think like it's it's more meat or more vegetable? I feel like

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.060
I feel like it has like a meaty core

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.020
But like veggie on the outside

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:57.100
I'm gonna pass on eating this thing, but it's definitely not a smash

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:01.740
I'm gonna pass and I'm gonna eat it. I know you don't like vegetables that much

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.460
I hate vegetables

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:10.380
Okay, bay leaf is sexy though. I like bay leaf. I like bay leaf's face. I like I like their style

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.660
I would smash bay leaf. Yeah, bay leaf is a smash

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:19.260
Chikorita's an impossible burger. Understandable. I would get that meat substitute

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:25.820
The Thickorita video I now I'm tempted to find out what that is. Smash bay leaf

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:27.260
Um

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:29.260
Meganium

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.460
It's just essentially almost a feminine

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:39.100
Yeah, I bet it smells nice like yeah, gardenia. Ooh

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:43.340
Smash yeah

01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:45.420
Cyndaquil

01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.060
Oh, that's a pass but a cuddler. Yeah

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.940
I want one. I want to get poked

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:56.300
Quilava burned, but like real cute real cute

01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.100
Quilava looks too sassy to me

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:04.300
Now quilava is a smash for me. Yeah

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:10.460
Yeah, he's in his in his rebellious teenage phase. I know he has a little mohawk going

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:15.340
He's got that anime protagonist. He just needs goggles and a scarf

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.500
Maybe like some maybe like some gloves too

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:28.060
So real got yourself a whole OC here. Just need some accessories. That's true. You could turn off the flames. That's a good point

01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.660
Um, I'll pass

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.940
Typhlosion I'd smash

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.980
Good

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.980
Good good

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.700
Good as he is a smash

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:45.100
uh

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:49.260
Typhlosion his he I can't never pronounce that looks a little bit

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.460
Predatory in my opinion

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:56.460
It's a smash for me. Yeah, he's got prettier

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.540
I need

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:06.620
He's like ladies. Can I buy you a drink? I don't know. He just seems sleazy to me

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:10.300
I'm gonna like he's really nice to look at but I feel like I ended up being disappointed

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.820
You know what? I'm okay with him looking sleazy

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:18.940
Because like all all he's got to do is like close his eyes and have like that fox face expression

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:26.460
Okay, like some some uh dojins have and I'm just I'm sold. I'm just here's the bedroom eyes. Very true

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.380
All right

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.900
Totodile

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.900
No, oh no

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.260
Totodile is one of my favorite. I would usually

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:37.260
um

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.260
I forgot is that heart gold?

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:44.060
I think totodile gold silver. Yeah, uh, I love my heart gold game

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:46.540
I love totodile so much

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:50.860
And that it's evolutions because they were my starter. I can't I could never

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.340
I guess totodile has always been a delight. Yeah

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.260
Crocodile is ugly to look at though. I hate crocodile

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.340
He needs

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:06.060
He needs a little club. He needed a bone club. He needs to pull this together. Yeah

01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:10.700
He looks so much like a dinosaur rather than like a crocodile here in my opinion. Yeah

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:17.500
Um, but it's still a pass. Yeah for alligator looks like he's cross-eyed sometimes and he's like screaming

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:27.900
I look I feel like for alligator. I would just ask why are you so loud? Yeah, I feel like he's about to hit the dab

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.900
Um

01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:34.140
Let it be said the for alligator is a dancer

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:40.860
For alligators, I'm going to chase you down the alley

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:46.220
He's referring to t-pose. Yeah, I just I'm gonna pass the for alligator

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:47.980
uh

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:49.980
centret

01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:51.740
uh

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:52.940
Pass

01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:55.020
Yeah, I don't know what I could do with that

01:32:55.980 --> 01:33:00.300
I mean a hug. Yeah, definitely hug hundred percent hug

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:03.740
But it's a pass. Yeah

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.620
Now furret

01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.620
Furret's too cute for me

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:17.740
Nah, furret's a great up smash because first of all furrets are real fucking big furrets are big

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:23.420
They're pretty giant. I always thought they were small and then I remember looking at the pokedex and seeing how big they actually were

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:27.340
And I was like what the fuck furret seems a vigorous. Mmm

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.140
Also, I just love that song

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:47.180
Um, I'll pass on furret you're smashing him. I'm smashing him

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.740
Uh hoot hoot

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.820
No, that's an owl

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:55.980
I thought with one foot that is a poor baby disabled owl

01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.340
I remember I used to pronounce it hoot

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:08.060
I mean to be fair though, it's pokemon so that that could be a legitimate american pronunciation

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.220
hoot

01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:13.660
Oh pass knocked owl

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:20.780
He's so serious very serious. I feel like he'd be such a boring lay

01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.260
Yeah

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.660
And he would just be really judgmental of you after

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:30.460
Yeah, like, you know, you could have done this better or I didn't like how you did that and I'm just like

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.020
I didn't even get to come

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:34.620
so

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:39.100
I bet this knocked owl would look at you and be like I can tell the type of poor and you watch is boring

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:47.260
Like like he's into some real freaky stuff and he's always trying to ask you for a little bit more

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:52.460
And you're just like you're a fucking owl. I don't want to do that. And he's like, why are you even here? Yeah

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:56.620
All right pass the knocked owl

01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.020
ladyba

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.420
Hmm, ladyba is so cute

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:06.060
Ladyba is so cute. There's little fist leggies

01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:09.020
Looks like he's gonna punch me

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:15.500
But like adorably like it won't hurt. It'll be like a little like like squishy noise like the squeaky squeaky toy noise

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:20.300
Yeah, I think ladyba's like a pass for me. Yeah

01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.700
Yeah

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.700
You're hearing audio cut out

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:29.180
Oh, it's it. Uh, is it me? Is it me my audio coming out?

01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:33.980
Tell us

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.620
360 degree eye contact though

01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.740
I mean, that's pretty impressive

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.140
Very impressive

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.500
Epee. Uh, all right pass ladyba

01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.940
Okay pass ladyba

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:51.740
Lady in

Okay, I really like lady ins design though. Me too. Like a like a little sentai guy

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.500
He really does look like a little sentai guy

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.540
All audio, huh?

01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:08.700
Well, the stream did like turn into a black screen for me for a moment. So I did it could be my bit rate

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.180
Oh, yeah, my bit rate is shit right now

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.700
Damn, I just looked at it. I'm getting so many dropped frames

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:19.580
Um, yeah, the stream is lagging. I can see it

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.460
Oh

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.460
No

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:30.940
I'm not getting ever getting buffering. That's too bad. Yeah, my I literally have like

01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:35.340
Normal bit rate, but I have so many dropped frames right now

01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:40.380
You know what? It's just youtube trying to nerf us because we're too powerful with these

01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.340
Definitely, they're just like stop

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:45.820
You can't handle it

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:47.820
enough

01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:51.580
Um, it's normal now. It hasn't it's gonna keep doing that. I can tell

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.140
I can see it doing it on my oh there it goes now. It's good

01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.460
We're back

01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:00.460
All right, we've never been more back

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.980
Uh, I'm passing on lady and just because I just I just want to be his friend

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.700
Yeah, like we would go on a picnic

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:10.140
Yeah, 100 and then he would like show me his cool fighting moves

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:14.860
I'd make him a flower crown. That's cute

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.100
Okay, spin or act spin or act

01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:23.100
I was like it's a like unhappy face on the back on its little butt

01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:28.700
Because like I bet I bet he hears nothing but people screaming at him

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:32.460
I'd hang out with him. I take him on a date

01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:35.980
I wouldn't do anything though

01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:39.180
Yeah, but like I love spiders

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:47.100
I would definitely let him stay in my house and yeah, we locate him to the outside. Yeah, I'll be like you can hang out

01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.620
You can be a roomie

01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:50.220
I'll pass

01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:52.060
yeah

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:56.620
And then they just like randomly glow up and they get their roommate that gets a little bit handsomer

01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:00.220
And you're just like should I and then you kind of like fight internally with yourself

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:03.900
That's how I would feel about this spider

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.540
In

01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:08.540
Ariados, yeah

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:10.220
You know

01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:12.220
honestly infinite rope

01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:23.340
I'm gonna smash their

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:30.940
I was also smashing. I'm also just thinking of like spider riders. Does anybody remember spider riders calling all spider

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:33.580
Riders, that's

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.860
I remember spider riders

01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.820
It never I never found out how it ended

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:44.300
Yeah, I didn't I don't think I ever finished it or didn't it like get canceled

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.020
I think it got canceled. Yeah

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.300
Stream got smashed

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:53.020
Just for a second. I think it's back up now. Okay

01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:56.540
Weird

01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:03.660
All right, maybe we'll only last until 10 if my internet's gonna keep being crappy or if you just gonna be gotcha

01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:06.780
all right

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.060
smash

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:10.060
crowbat

01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:12.860
This seems angry

01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:17.900
Yeah, I don't want to deal with I don't want to deal whatever anger issues. He's got going on. That's a pass for me

01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:20.220
Hmm

01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.260
Like all he's gonna do is bitch out you in bed same

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:28.460
I believe that too. Oh, yeah, I can see it on my side. How am I stream is buffering

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:40.220
He just reloaded the page. Okay, weird. I'm sorry you guys got kicked out for a little bit

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.940
Yeah

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:47.580
Oh, yeah, I could see a lot of people dropped off randomly. That's too bad. Damn you YouTube

01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:51.900
Hopefully they find out the stream again. Um, let's get to you

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:54.380
Uh chinchu

01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:56.380
This happened to Azura all day

01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:57.900
Oh

01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:02.060
I think chinchu is so cute. Chinchu is so cute. I couldn't do anything to this little baby

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:09.660
No, no, I couldn't do anything to them. They're too cute. Yeah and lantern lantern just looks like a such a happy person

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.460
Little happy pokemon

01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:17.100
They're just happy to tell you what they found in the ocean today. Yeah, I found a seashell

01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:21.740
And you're just like, yeah, then you kind of just go a little like see adventures with them

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:24.700
Yeah, yeah, I'll be a good friend

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:31.660
Pichu I'm gonna sound really really inhumane, but I'm eating that motherfucker

01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:41.900
I'll eat them right alongside you hell. Yeah, we're eating this little mouse

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:45.820
Uh also eating clefa

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:53.020
There's there's no room for argument here. They're both they're both edible. I bet they taste like candy

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.540
I know

01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:59.740
Pichu's probably like lemon flavor candy clefa bubblegum flavor. Yeah, I was like it looks like bubblegum

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.420
I'm chewing on that with bits of chocolate. Yeah

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.660
Iggly buff

01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:11.340
I almost said ugly buff. I mean, you're not wrong

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.740
Also

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.740
It's like balls on its head

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:23.020
When they introduced baby pokemon in the second gen they fucked up because these are just food

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:27.900
Yeah, I'm I'm eating this one. I don't get the spiral in the middle of its head. I don't know the lore from that

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.820
That's like its baby curl. It's big. Oh, I don't like that

01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.940
Yeah, it just looks like a Naruto

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.340
village sign

01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.140
Oh, it's from the leaf village

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.460
I'm eating it

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:47.340
Jigglypuff's got to get her curl from somewhere. That's her baby hair. That's her baby hair

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:50.300
Uh togapi

01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.700
Eating eating eating this egg

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.980
It's just an egg that sat a little too long. Yeah

01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:59.180
Gain sentience

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:03.980
Little too hard boiled, but that's okay. We can fix that. Yeah

01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:10.060
I'm trying to think about how I would prepare this togapi

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:14.860
Hmm

01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:17.820
You know since it's like technically a hard hard boiled egg

01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:22.380
All you have to do is like maybe like stab it and then you can probably just eat it

01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.780
Yeah, maybe it'll be like a little deviled egg moment

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:26.700
Oh, yeah

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:27.980
Ooh, that'd be pretty good

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:31.100
Like yeah, like you cut off like the top where the three spikes are

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:35.420
Yeah, you scoop out the insides and you make like the inside for devil salad. Mm-hmm

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:37.740
Delicious

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:43.820
When this turn into an eater pass, uh, how we do pokemon smash or pass is we do you'll uh,

01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.500
Smash or pass them

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:50.460
Or we will also eat them or we'll rob them because some of them have jewels and we want to steal them

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.460
Devil's togapi, uh

01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:57.740
I can't pronounce that

01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:02.540
Oh, that's toga tick. Oh toga tick. I was like, yes togetic

01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:07.100
Toga tick

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:09.260
Smash pass eat and rob

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.460
Honestly, I'd let I live and let live for this one

01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.980
Isn't it really big?

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:21.340
No, not quite the next one is though. Okay, because I'm like, can't you like fly on one of them or whatever?

01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:25.340
Yeah, it's the last one. Okay. I don't I'm gonna pass on this one

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:33.820
Oh, I forgot the next one comes in the next gen. Yep, that's right actually not to

01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:36.780
Eating that it looks like a green apple

01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:38.780
Honestly

01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:44.140
I I want to pick it up and bounce it because it looks like it has like the same feeling as a tennis ball

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:48.780
I was thinking like a bouncy ball. I would chew on it because then maybe it's like rubbery

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.820
Like a chew I want to know if it smells like a tennis ball

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.820
Okay sniffing sniffing not we have a new

01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:58.620
entry sniff

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:03.820
I definitely would give him a whiff. He looks like he smells like a tennis ball

01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.940
Uh, is that too?

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.940
It's a tennis ball tent

01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:12.540
It is a tennis ball tent with a little cat on his on his shirt

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:17.180
Very cute. I feel like he would like open up his wings and flash me

01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.900
Yeah

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:21.500
Like you think he's

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500
You think he's like skinny underneath the rope

01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:30.380
Uh because of the the spacing of his feet. I feel like he's pretty close in the body type

01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.420
Under the robe like that shape

01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.140
Hmm

01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:39.580
Wait, isn't that wait, isn't that just actually his wings just held in front of him?

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.780
So he is just like

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:46.460
That cone shape

01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:52.140
I don't know that would mean he's pretty wide. You know what either way it's a pass for me. Yeah

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:56.060
Marie oh

01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.780
That's a pass but like pass

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:02.940
I love Marie but it's so cute. I might try to eat it

Monkey, I know you're like your monkeys

01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:43.500
I do like my monkeys, but a pom's always kind of pissed me off a little bit. All right

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:49.980
And I don't know what it is about a pom. I just a pom doesn't feel like a smash for me

01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:53.180
Understandable. I feel like a pom

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:57.820
I just seems like he would just pull some really stupid shit during

01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.780
And then like as like a prank

01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:04.620
And then just like try to laugh about it afterwards

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:10.380
But like it makes me feel really bad or so. I don't know like like he would run up slap your ass

01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:16.060
And when you tried to get mad at him, he would be like, it's just a prank bro. It's just a prank. Yeah, I just don't

01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.940

It's going in my pocket. Yeah, definitely

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.460
Definitely stuck in the pocket could use it as a plug

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:54.860

01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:10.540

01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:34.700
Mm-hmm

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:37.740
Maybe he takes off his hat

01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:41.180
Not the hat stays on I don't want him to bump me with it

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:45.580
Well, just don't just don't put your head up there. Okay

01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:48.860
How big is slow king

01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:50.620
Uh

01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:54.860
I think he's like what five feet how tall are we as muppets?

01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:59.020
Are we like a foot tall? What are we?

01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:04.460
So let's see here. I think slow king slow king's about six foot seven

01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:06.860
What?

01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:08.540
Yeah

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.540
Or I guess he's like

01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.700
Five foot eleven

01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:19.340
Bulbapedia is giving me two different answers. Okay, so average slow king's fucking six feet tall for no reason

01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:22.380
um

01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:24.460
I might steal a hat

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:28.140
I'm also again wondering how big I am how big are we?

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:35.020
Well, I mean canonical. Well, we're on. Well, if you if you check yourself, you'll see that you're on a hand

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:39.660
I'm looking at my hand size right now. So that means I'm like less than a foot

01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:43.260
Yeah, you're probably like about two feet

01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:49.020
Because like you got to put your hand into the top. Oh, that's true

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:53.500
Okay, and then like the rest of it's got to be your body. So like

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:58.940
About two feet because like your hand itself is maybe like what six inches

01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:04.780
I need a

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.380
I need a ruler

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:08.380
I have very long fingers

01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:10.540
Now harlots, did you know

01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:16.460
If your hand is bigger than your face, you might be a candidate for a cancer screening

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.700
Wait, what?

01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.300
My hand is half bigger than my face and I'm safe. Did you actually put your hand up there?

01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:26.860
I did if I know if you were here you would have smacked me in the face. Yes, I would

01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:37.020
We need to do an off collab where we do this in person

01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:45.660
I just actually get smacked in the face for my stupidity. I realized what that was afterwards. I was like wait, I remember this

01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:54.300
All right, I guess I'll smash low king. Yeah

01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:01.260
Still a smash for me, baby. No, thanks

01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:07.500

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:10.380

01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:01.820
Heck yeah

01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:03.820
Yes, I understand the message was unpanned

01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:07.420
I'll pin this one

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:09.900
You know the bots just need you to know

01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:14.140
That's that you're just undoing the thing that you said you wanted to do. Yeah

01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:19.420
Um, but toma is very cool

01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:25.260
She's very talented and sweet as you can see she's a great artist from both of our

01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:28.380
muppet forms

01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:32.620
Do you want to tell them the good news by the way that you showed me the other day?

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:35.100
the pdf

01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:37.660
Oh, I have drawn up

01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.460
What is a rigable?

01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:41.580
uh

01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.580
shibby cotton bum muppet

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:46.700
That can be live 2d rigged

01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:50.060
unfortunately, I'm a little dog water at

01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:52.860
rigging so

01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:55.260
I might

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:57.500
Need a lot of time to rig it

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.340
Or I can find somebody to help

01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:04.780
Rig it

01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:06.780
DEMPA actually might know how to rig

01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:09.740
Mike you could probably ask DEMPA. I just thought of that

01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:12.140
Maybe

01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:15.740
I just and it's funny because like I just like woke up and she's like look what I made

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:19.180
She just slid me the pdf

01:59:19.580 --> 01:59:22.940
And I was just screaming I was so happy

01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:29.420
I'll tell you I'll I'll tell you how it how it came to be. I was there the entire uh

01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:35.260
Ellen ring stream. Yeah, the entire elden ring stream and I was just working on it

01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:39.180
It's it's you guys don't even know

01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:42.300
My final form

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:44.300
Slowly coming to fruition

01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:51.980
I'm tempted even a surprise. There's even a surprise in the pdf for you. No, I didn't even I didn't want to uh

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:57.340
peek through the files too deeply because I kind of wanted to wait and be surprised until it's rigged

01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:00.140
um

02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:05.500
Maybe I can also look at some rig videos to see if I can do it myself

02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:09.020
I've never even tried rigging before but it's a very good skill to have

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.460
It is yeah, and just being able to cut

02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.180
Stuff as well to make models

02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:19.500
Um, I need to learn how to draw properly first. I'm still working on that

02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:27.260
You draw plenty. Well, it's really cute your art style. It's developing into something that suits you. Oh, thank you. I try

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.580
Oh

02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:34.220
But um, yeah, please give uh trinket a follow on tomah keys

02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:39.360
We're starting a muppet tuba revolution

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:42.700
We love muppets. We love muppets here

02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:46.220
Now I think I want to do a muppet watch a lot at some point

02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:50.300
And probably have you on for that. We can watch like muppets in our space or something

02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:55.740
Ah man, I was actually just talking about how in the late 2000s

02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:58.380
Late 90s early 2000s

02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:03.660
There was like just this theme of found family and it started off with gonzo just being like

02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:06.540
I'm not sure if i'm a whatever anymore

02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:11.420
And then you just the next year after that you come out with the tigger movie and it's like

02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:16.140
Man, maybe being the only tigger isn't so based

02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:19.500
That's such a good one. There was like a weird

02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:22.060
Arrow where there was a lot of found family stuff

02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:25.820
Which is also very sweet and cute because everybody deserves family, you know

02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:29.900
But like I went back and I watched the trailer for the tigger movie, right?

02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:34.380
Do you know how they advertise the tigger movie coming out? No, how did they?

02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:38.460
Do you remember first they give you like a really high energy like

02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:46.460
Basically the whole high energy song about tigger teaching ru how to do like the soup the the super duper alley uber

02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:51.820
Bounce essentially doesn't he like it's raining and it gets really depressing or something

02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:57.900
No, they don't show you any context to what happens in the movie. All you know

02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.620
It's like, oh, it's a little tigger movie. My kids are gonna love this

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:05.340
They don't tell you about the trauma you're about to deliver upon your kids like firsthand

02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:07.900
The tigger like runs away because he's like

02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:13.420
My family never was coming. Well, I'm going to go find them. Oh my god

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:16.940
Like you don't know that you're in for an emotional bomb

02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:22.540
They do the same fucking bullshit with the with the hunt for christopher or the search for christopher robin

02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:28.460
Where it's like, oh no christopher robin's gone missing. We've got to go and find him. He's been stolen by

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.260
Skull

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:35.180
But it's like and then you have like winnie the pooh just getting all depressed

02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:40.540
And everyone just doubting themselves the entire movie and winnie the pooh has like all this cryptic knowledge

02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:43.260
That he can't remember because he's a silly old bear

02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:45.900
It's the worst

02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:49.180
We do not like

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:53.900
Winnie the pooh trauma trauma here whether it wouldn't matter the character

02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:57.660
They don't deserve this

02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:02.700
They do it to everyone though. The only people who haven't had trauma is perhaps kanga

02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:08.940
Kanga hasn't had a single bit of trauma at all. Yeah, kanga's pretty chill

02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:13.580
Kiglet's had trauma. I think it's trauma in the animated series

02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:19.820
Tigger has a whole fucking movie about it. So does winnie the pooh. Eeyore's just like always depressed

02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:26.300
Yeah, Eeyore Eeyore Eeyore never knows a moment's peace because he's always at the beck and call of everybody else

02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:33.100
And then like you have made up characters like gopher who's like well study

02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:36.380
Ah, i'm just dandy

02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:42.540
I feel like yeah kanga is a single mom. That's right because i'm like i can't

02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.980
I feel like she was like arguing with owl about something

02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:49.900
She's a single mom. Yeah

02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:54.460
And then owl nothing bad ever happens to owl

02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:58.380
Owls in fact he causes all of the problem

02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:04.860
Owl causes 90 of the problems because they all go to him because he's the owl and supposedly learned

02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:07.180
But owl can't read either

02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:09.500
Nope

02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:12.380
He's secretly he thinks he's so smart, but he's not

02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:15.180
He's not he just uses

02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:19.180
The ignorance of the other animals against them

02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:23.660
To be some pseudo leader in its sickening

02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:28.220
And then they introduce like a half a lump and that doesn't really go anywhere

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:31.660
Half a lump is so cute though

02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:33.740
What's his name? It's like ala something

02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:39.660
I forget it did like ala wishes. Yeah ala wishes. I love that name ala wishes

02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:42.060
It's so cute

02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:46.700
And like I feel like if like 2d animation for disney had gone on for a little bit longer

02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:50.220
We would have gotten a like a woozel character joining the cast as well

02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:55.580
Like a little friendly woozel since we got a really friendly half a lump

02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:01.420
Why don't they come up with these names

02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:08.460
So owls just Congress I suppose yeah pretty much

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:13.100
I like how he just went on a random tangent

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:15.500
I'm not waiting for the whole character

02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:19.500
I'm so sorry. No when it was the both of us and it was so funny

02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:22.620
Oh

02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:29.180
Okay, well, is there any closing words you want to say to the harem before we

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:31.900
You say goodbye

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:33.900
Brush your teeth wash your butt

02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:38.860
And if you ever need that extra clean feeling you can use

02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:44.380
Water on your toilet paper and it essentially acts as a wet wipe. Yeah

02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:47.180
and then you don't have to you know

02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:50.300
Cause issues in your plumbing system by using like

02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:53.580
Cotton L wipes or something or baby wipes

02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:59.340
Yep, and if you're a little bougie you could put rose water on your toilet paper and then

02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:04.380
Or witch hazel which acts as an astringent and it doesn't burn

02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:07.100
Very true. Very true. Or you can get a bidet

02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:10.300
Or you could get a bidet. I want to try to get a bidet

02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:13.180
I don't I couldn't I probably want to be able to install it in my apartment

02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:15.660
But it'd be really cool to have a bidet

02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:18.940
It would just shoot water up right up my butt

02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:23.260
Like like galaga

02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:30.300
Oh, no, I don't joker. That's why you double up the toilet paper. Oh, yeah, what you want to yeah

02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:34.780
You want to fold that up a couple times before you get you don't want to do like one single square

02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:37.660
Yeah, who does that?

02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:39.740
I know somebody who does that

02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:44.380
What am I friends? I remember sleeping over her house

02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:49.100
And she's like, oh, can you grab me a square toilet paper? Like I'm out of toilet. I'm like a square

02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:51.820
A square

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:57.100
How do you know a square is not going to keep your hands clean you got to double that shit up exactly

02:06:57.500 --> 02:06:58.860
I

02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:00.860
I questioned our friendship after that

02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:02.620
honestly

02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:07.020
Like don't fall for the charnel bears or the shaman bear propaganda

02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:13.340
You use as much toilet paper as you want you bought it. I think it was because she grew up mostly in a house full of boys

02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:18.140
And for boys like they don't really like when they pee they don't wipe

02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:21.020
Or they just like do a little shake

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:25.580
No boys don't wipe. Yeah, they have to do that shake and then you got to wonder like well

02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:31.020
What didn't it be effective if they did do like a little dab? Yeah, I think that's she got the dab from that

02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:34.700
It's

02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:38.940
Yeah, you got a little then you got a little piss stain on your pants, especially if you were in sweatpants

02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:43.500
Yeah, and then it just makes like makes it look like you didn't like make it in time. Yeah

02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:49.500
And that's kind of sad if you think about it like at least when a girl doesn't make it in time

02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:51.660
It's kind of like hell. Yeah

02:07:54.780 --> 02:08:01.260
But the smell is there, but we can cover that up too. It's a little perfume bath and potty wars

02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:10.140
That's why your kegel exercises are very important to keep you from pissing when you sneeze

02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:13.100
Like and it's weird because I didn't

02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:18.780
When I was sneezing the uh, I don't is that what you're referencing right now? Yeah, okay. Um

02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:23.980
I'm like just I just suddenly feel personally attacked to be funny if you weren't even talking about that

02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:29.420
It wasn't because it happened it happens to me too because like when you get older you think

02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:32.700
Oh, nothing bad's ever gonna happen to me and then next thing you know

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:37.420
You're sneezing and like lord help you if it happens to be like one of those days of the month

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:39.980
And oh, that's the worst

02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:42.540
And then you're like a gusher and then you're just

02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:49.020
You're just call. Yeah, call me your little ketchup packet when I sneeze. I swear to god. Um

02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:53.500
Um, no, it wasn't even pee

02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:02.380
You know

02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:04.620
That's fine

02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:10.460
That's fine. You know, the body is full of mysterious substances. Yeah

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:13.740
We could basically say that it was sprinkles

02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:16.380
sparkles

02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:18.380
Rainbows at this point

02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:20.540
Like

02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:31.020
Like honestly, I'm still trying to figure out if the human body could essentially work like a straw

02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:35.020
I wonder

02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.020
Oh, can you do like

02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:40.860
Did you see that like clip of like the girls doing kegel exercises?

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.980
And they're pulling up stuff through this. Yeah

02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:47.020
I want to try that

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:50.380
I

02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:53.660
Would you ever try that

02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:58.380
I would but I don't think I could do it. I don't have the pelvic wall string

02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:00.780
I'm practicing right now

02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:01.900
one

02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:02.940
two

02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:03.980
two three

02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:06.140
three four four hold it

02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:10.220
Release

02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:22.060
I hope you did it. I hope you did it with us harlot. Yeah, you better

02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:26.620
You'll have to go back and you'll have to do it all over again. Exactly

02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:34.620
And remember if you're clenching your butt, you're doing it wrong

02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:36.940
Um

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:42.940
But yeah, no, yeah guys can do it too. It just makes your your little pee pee bounce

02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:50.540
Yeah, and like it's okay because you guys have that button in the backside. Yeah to help

02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:53.580
Doesn't it like strengthen their prostate or something?

02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:59.340
Yeah, it does. I think also, I don't know if I told you this really interesting fact

02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:03.020
What so there there's a scientific method of like

02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:05.980
Undoing hiccups

02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:10.220
That has been proven and you'll never guess how is it doing

02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:12.620
Kegels

02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:17.740
No, no, no, it's actually a lot easier than doing kegels. Okay. You just got to put a finger up your butt

02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:19.900
What?

02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:23.260
Yep, if you put a finger up your butt it helps you stop the hiccups

02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:26.780
How

02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:32.540
Well, see there's a thing in your in your in your in your rectal space. Okay, I guess kind of push

02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:40.300
It's not fake. You can google it. You can google it. It's there are there are there are there are there are findings

02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:42.380
scientific finding

02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:44.380
This is how I got my friends

02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:46.540
Okay, so are you guys saying it's true?

02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:49.180
Very interesting

02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:52.780
I know lots of stuff

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:54.780
That's how I know

02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:55.660
Oh

02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:58.380
She does know lots of stuff. I'm being so educated right now

02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:03.740
Honestly, it's a mystery what I know. I don't even know what I know until I tell people

02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:06.380
It just comes up

02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:11.420
I know that happens to me sometimes too just have random facts and I'm just like why did I say

02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:14.380
But it's really prevalent

02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:21.100
I can't tell you when the war of 1812 took place, but I can tell you that scooby-doo was created on september 1969

02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:28.300
That's a more important fact

02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:31.420
See it's important to know

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:39.900
1812 a fire call when the war of 1812 took place

02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:48.780
Yeah, but when in 1812, I don't know

02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:53.100
I

02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:59.020
Yeah, you shove your finger up your butt to scare the hiccups away

02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:02.940
Because everybody knows the hiccups come from the butt

02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:15.660
I'm gonna try that next time I get hiccups

02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:20.780
My fingers going up my butt and I'll tell you if guys if it works

02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:26.540
Someone else's butt no you don't do that

02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:33.660
Could you imagine though if we were on the magic school bus and it taught history instead of science and we went back in time

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:38.940
That would be so cool actually if they had like a magic school bus equivalent for that

02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:41.980
Yeah, I like history

02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:46.220
How come miss frizzle only taught science actually? Yeah, well they had

02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:51.660
So many other subjects you need to learn in school and they were young enough that they only had one teacher

02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:54.460
Yeah, she only taught science

02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:58.380
Why wasn't she teaching like math or english or

02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:06.620
Anything else like we had a music episode, but that was science adjacent. Yeah, they definitely should have taken her teaching license away

02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:14.620
Also, I don't think any of these children's parents knew that they were leaving school in the middle of the day and going into like someone's body

02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:18.620
Then they like travel into someone's body at one point on the bus

02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:23.340
More than once don't they need like a parents permission slip for that?

02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:26.300
nah

02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.460
Don't they need consent to

02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:35.660
I mean the child's at school that's consent enough for them to fly a bus into the child, right?

02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:46.620
Well, actually no because they flew up. They flew the bus into Ralphie's sick body. Yeah, how can he consent to that? That's not fair

02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:54.780
Well, I guess Ralphie said it was okay because he's like you guys are going inside me and miss frizzle's like yep

02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:56.460
well

02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:58.460
I feel like he felt like he didn't have a choice then

02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:05.340
And you know, it's fucked up Ralphie's mom in that episode we find out that her like profession is she's a doctor

02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.820
What a shitty doctor

02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:12.460
So she doesn't

02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:16.620
So she's like so like she even sees them inside of Ralphie's body

02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:21.580
And she doesn't put two and two together because she's like wow this actually looks like the inside of a body

02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:25.660
I can't believe your classmates put this together for you so you can learn how you're sick

02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:29.820
Maybe it's a little too much excitement though. We should probably turn this off

02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:32.060
Just

02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:34.460
Gaslighting her son

02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:38.140
Maybe she was gaslighting herself. Oh, yeah, the kid that almost died in space

02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:41.420
Yep, that was Arnold. Take Arnold. Yeah, I was an Andrew

02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:45.340
And then you had like the narc phoebe

02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:48.060
Oh, I hated phoebe

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:53.100
They never did this at my old school. Bitch. You ain't at your old school. And we don't know why

02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:58.060
Are you gonna expel because of how annoying you are

02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:03.180
Fuck it. Phoebe. Fuck it's Phoebe, man. Carlos

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:07.100
Carlton is terrible puns

02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:14.220
And then you had Tim who could draw

02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:17.980
That was his that was this thing that was this thing

02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:23.180
Yep, and then you had Keisha who was a good journalist. She was pretty good

02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:25.900
I thought Keisha was cool

02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:32.620
Yeah, Keisha was real cool. Arnold's now wanda. I wanted to wanda wanda fighting the fighting the curb in 4k

02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:35.900
Every other episode they killed Arnold's cousin

02:16:37.260 --> 02:16:39.020
wait

02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:40.460
They killed janet

02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:41.900
I hated janet

02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:43.900
Janet was real annoying

02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:47.740
Arnold's cousin almost rat the class out to the police and then they killed her was

02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:54.300
I believe it too. I kind of want that to be canon

02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:01.260
And then of course you have dorthian girl with two names bit of a no at all. Yeah

02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:08.140
What a what a what a ride that show was I know

02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:16.060
I wish I could be on the magic school bus. Yeah despite everything I wish I could be there too

02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:19.820
I think

02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:22.220
I'm trying to think of like what our character types would be

02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:26.700
Hmm. Well, it is a short bus. So that's money

02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:35.020
I'll be the really dumb blonde that doesn't understand what's going on

02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.300
I'll be the one that thinks of way too many things that don't

02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:43.020
pertain to the moment

02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:49.180
You're just like they're like in his body and you're just like did you know that plants and they're like shut up trick

02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:57.260
Ah, you just say the most inopportune facts at the wrong time

02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:01.500
Did you know more people die because they wear their seatbelts?

02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:10.380
Everybody on the bus just takes off their seatbelt seatbelts everyone and then you just say that

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:21.660
Horror theory is interesting on the magic school bus. Is there a creepypasta of that? I bet there is

02:18:22.220 --> 02:18:24.220
Look, there's so many

02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:26.140
Like I think like around last year

02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:28.380
I stumbled upon the tiktok series where they were

02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:32.380
Introducing like the magic school bus as a horror based theme and like

02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:38.700
Every every field trip somebody would die, but they would be reincarnated by the end of the adventure. Oh my gosh

02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:44.540
That is to miss frizzle just like some sort of crazy witch

02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:48.860
Honestly, okay. So talking about I'm so sorry

02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:54.380
Can I can I tell you about mary poppins? Yes, you could tell me about mary poppins

02:18:55.340 --> 02:19:03.580
Okay, so you know how I also love mary poppins and you are aware that they came up with a mary poppins to mary poppins returns, right?

02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:05.820
Yes, I remember watching that with my mom

02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:08.300
Okay, mary poppins 2

02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:13.900
Pisses me off right because it is seen for seen original mary poppins except now mary poppins

02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:19.500
Now that she has like CGI magic instead of like practical effect magic feels more like a demon

02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:25.740
Who's come back to feel some contractual agreement that she has with the bank's children

02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:29.180
That

02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:31.180
That actually makes so much sense

02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:36.540
Because there's that scene like towards the end of the movie where we're already past like the point of hype

02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:41.260
And they're like, oh no, we have to get up to the top of big Ben to stall time

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:46.620
And so you see all these lamp lighters making their way on the BMX bikes

02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:52.860
Ladder to shit climbing on the outside of big Ben and mary poppins is standing there cool as a cucumber

02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:58.460
And like she finally gets fed up like never seen humans to do a woman. She's not human

02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:01.020
She's a demon

02:20:01.180 --> 02:20:03.820
At that point and then she flies up with her umbrella

02:20:03.900 --> 02:20:10.460
You see her silhouette and I'm like, bitch you could have done that the whole time and save these people like death because I'm pretty sure

02:20:10.860 --> 02:20:14.620
Almost five of them fell off the tower that is big Ben

02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:18.220
That would make a lot of sense because then as a demon she would just

02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:21.580
Like to see humans suffer from time to time

02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:24.140
And she does see humans suffer

02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:29.500
She actively does see them suffer and then she likes to punish them especially when they're kids

02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:31.820
and kind of like

02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:35.260
Because think about like the medicine they didn't want to eat the medicine. She kind of like tortures them even

02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:40.780
Yeah, because like you can even tell that she's not really there for the children to learn a lesson

02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:46.140
No, the actual children. No, she's there for michael and jane because jane's almost like a spinster

02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:51.660
She's like, I don't really want to date anyone mary poppins mary poppins sets her up with lynn manwell maranda

02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:55.980
And then out of everybody, you know, that's your torture. No

02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:02.620
And then like for michael, she's like you need to get over your dead wife. You have children my guy

02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:05.420
i'ma help you

02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:07.260
understand this

02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:10.540
That you need to be the adult and they need to not be the adult

02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:15.500
Well, what what would be what would be the the narrative with the chimney sweep?

02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:21.660
So the chimney sweep is lynn manwell maranda is taking on the role of burt

02:21:22.380 --> 02:21:24.460
In this movie, but what about like normal burt?

02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:27.180
normal burt

02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:28.700
What would be the

02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:30.700
the story between them that he like

02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:33.340
Fallen was she like a succubus?

02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:36.060
so the way that I see it right

02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:39.020
Is in the very first mary poppins movie

02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:46.700
mary poppins has been to london before and she's known burt since she was like a younger sort of demon slash witch

02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:52.940
And they sort of have like this sort of coexistence things because burt's got a little tricky magic of his own

02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:56.460
True, but he can't really do it because he's not really a fully

02:21:57.260 --> 02:22:02.860
Realized or or a wizard of some bro. I imagine they do like sabrina the teenage witch like they do with netflix

02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:07.820
Except they do mary poppins and they make like a darker mary poppins when she was younger

02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:13.820
You know what this disney's missing out because I have a million great ideas

02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:17.600
They need to hire you. This is brilliant

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:22.800
I love that so much

02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:26.720
Pennywise feeds on fear poppins feeds on joy

02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:32.160
I don't even you know what I don't even think poppins feeds on joy

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:35.280
She feeds on what is considered obedience

02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:43.520
Essentially obedience turning people into societal members and also teaching good family values

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.280
Because it takes place in britain even though they don't have british accents

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Yeah, good point

02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:56.480
Because like mary poppins could care less about women's suffrage in the first movie. Yeah, good

02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:59.360
Yeah, she was just like whatever

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:06.000
Whatever, I don't I don't need to vote human laws don't really affect me. Yeah, she's like I've seen centuries of this

02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:10.480
It all it all turns out the same

02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:12.480
Hmm

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:20.080
Women go on having children men go to work and they neglect their kids. I'm here to teach you. Don't neglect your kids. Yep

02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:23.040
I like this theory. This sounds very legit

02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:33.200
Sorry, we went we went we went on a weird sort of roundabout from winnie the pooh

02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:36.800
To magic school bus to mary poppins

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.800
Mm-hmm

02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:42.000
We should just I like how we just have like lengthy discussions about

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:44.800
children's movies and shows and how they

02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:49.280
See just conspiracy stream about how they're secretly all twisted

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:53.200
Analyze them

02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:56.160
I'm a bit of a conspiracy theorist

02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:01.520
I like it though. Are we all we should we should they're all we should all should uh, you know

02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:06.400
Humor a little bit of conspiracy every now and then a little bit. Sometimes it's the truth

02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:12.320
Yeah, like did you guys know that there's a genre of music that's devoted to flat earth?

02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:14.880
What?

02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:22.160
Yeah, what's it called listing is it good flat earth. It's honestly flat earth got some bops to it. Okay

02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.880
all right

02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:30.960
Trinket 15 minute rambles are impressive. This is why we're good friends because we're both just yappers

02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:34.880
She's the only one that can match my yap

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:39.520
I can yapp as long as someone yaps with me

02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:46.480
Flatcore oh my god, I mean they're bops

02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:50.880
Oh, Mary and peter pan are the same

02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:55.200
What explain elaborate on the peter pan theory

02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:04.960
Oh, okay. I see what they're going for so peter pan himself is a bit of a demon because he goes and he kidnaps children from open windows

02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:06.320
True

02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:08.320
Because he he gives them this lie

02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:13.120
You can come with me and never grow up, but that's not necessarily true for children that go with him

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:20.560
Because they do eventually grow up and when they grow up in neverland they turn into pirates in which peter pan kills pirates

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:24.160
And he's just constantly feeding himself

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:27.440
Whatever sick twisted

02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:30.080
Joy he gets out of killing pirates

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:32.640
Oh my god

02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:40.480
And then here's here's another good one for you when he's actually going to uh the the window of the darlings where windy

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:42.400
john

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:44.000
and

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.640
Windy john and never got the other one

02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:50.800
I forget him too. Anyways, michael there it is. Yeah michael

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:57.120
So when when he goes to that window, he's been there a few times because he loves listening to windy tales stories

02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:03.200
But there's not an opportunity for him to kind of slip in and steal the children because they're perfectly happy

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:05.040
They have no reason to run away from home

02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:12.320
Yep, until like that night when the father's fed up because a dog shouldn't be a nanny that don't don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise

02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:17.840
I would make a great nanny. I am a dog. She would be a great nanny. I will watch I will watch your children for you

02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:20.320
Yeah, and then I'll take a nap. Yep

02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:24.240
So anyways, peter pan sneaks into the house, right? Yeah

02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:27.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah because because his shadow gets away from him anyways

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:30.400
So that's like the reason why he goes in. Yeah

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:35.600
Yeah, so he goes in wendy's like, oh my god. There's a boy in my room

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:38.640
Peter pans like

02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:41.520
Well, yeah, but i'm here for my shadow. Oh

02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:43.200
well

02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:49.120
I can help you stick it back because he was trying to stick his shadow back on with soap at first because you know soap's kind of sticky

02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:53.200
So yeah, a little bit sticky. It's not that smart. He's not that smart because it also can be slippery

02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:56.720
Yeah, and so she's like, I'll just sew it on for you

02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:00.800
And of course wendy's getting fresh because she's about to hit that puberty streak and she's like

02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:03.840
I'll give you a kiss and he's like, okay

02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:08.560
And she and he's like hold out his hand. She gives him a thimble, of course, and you know, but

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:13.680
Then she's like, okay, then I'll give you a thimble and she's she's about the plant one on him

02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:20.560
Of course and then tinker bell a little the little demon that that stole peter pan away. She is fey. She is fey

02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:23.280
He is fey. So is peter pan a changeling?

02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:28.080
Peter pan would be a changeling because he was human and then he was

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:32.480
Abducted by fairies because he ran away from his parents when he was still a baby

02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:39.040
Because they were they were talking his future way too early above him. Yeah, like that's how you give a baby anxiety

02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:41.520
Oh, we'll visit the finest schools

02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.840
Yardsdale

02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:49.680
Princeton and he'll join his father in the courts and it's like, ah, he just couldn't handle that

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.320
Yeah, so

02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:57.680
He goes to neverland. He grows up there. He develops his own sort of magic because yeah, peter pan doesn't need

02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:00.800
Yeah, peter pan doesn't need fairy dust

02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.640
To like fly he makes his own now because he's imbued with magic

02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:09.680
Yeah, because he's been there for so long since like right only happens when you're young. I bet

02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:12.800
Huh, that's really interesting then because like why didn't

02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:15.680
some of the kids

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:17.280
get the same

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:19.280
ability as him

02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:22.480
Because they're always changing out because they always grow up

02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:25.760
What stops him from growing up?

02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:27.040
well

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:29.040
Because he was the first

02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:35.600
He and neverland are kind of tied together now neverland's attached to him. He's attached to neverland

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:40.480
That's why whenever he leaves neverland if it's frozen over. It's cold. It's dead

02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:45.280
And then when he returns the sun is back. It's warm. It's summer. You do fun stuff

02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:47.920
I can't live without him and he can't live without neverland

02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:50.160
Right

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.160
Fascinating

02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:55.040
So anyway peter pan is in the same

02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:59.760
Like breath like mary poppins in that he

02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:06.320
He doesn't really help children, but he steals children. Yeah, he's an entity that just does things on us on win

02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:09.120
right and mary poppins is like

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:13.680
The one who comes to you for when she needs to eat

02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:16.400
mm

02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:19.920
Whereas with nanny mcfee nanny mcfee is just selfish

02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:24.640
I used to love nanny mcfee that movie was so I love that movie

02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:27.280
I love nanny mcfee nanny mcfee is

02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:32.640
Like the saw the opposite side of mary poppins. Yes, just like more

02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:35.920
hardcore

02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:43.600
She she's like she's like when mary poppins fails to get the job done. She's the boot camp of equivalent of mary

02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:45.200
Yeah

02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:47.200
but she's not like

02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:49.920
I wouldn't say she's a demon

02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:52.880
No, she's not I would say just she's like a witch

02:29:53.680 --> 02:30:00.160
Yeah, she's like a cursed hag. Yeah just gets off on like the more you hate me the longer I'll stay

02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:03.680
Yeah, but when you want me I'll go away

02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:06.480
It's like damn. Okay

02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.360
Yeah, it's like it's and that's how you know

02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:12.640
Because that's how witches are like a riddly like that

02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:15.600
Yeah, yeah

02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:17.600
Peter Pan is an s of scp

02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:24.000
Yeah, I don't remember a lot of the nanny mcfee movie the second one

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:29.760
I don't remember the second one either, but I feel like it's not attached to the first one really

02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:33.360
Oh, wait, really

02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:36.960
It's a really good point. No, I'm going back to Peter Pan

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:40.800
Neverland takes the time from the children that he brings and gives it to Peter Pan

02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:47.760
That would make a million dollars worth of cents. Mm-hmm. He's stealing time from them

02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:51.600
Boy Robin Williams version

02:30:52.320 --> 02:31:00.080
Oh, I do love the Robin Williams version. Yeah, where he goes back like because like even in the storybook like the original

02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:05.120
M.M. Berry Peter Pan storybook, which by the way fun fact about Peter Pan

02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:07.360
It is not actually public domain

02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:14.400
Any money that you make off of Peter Pan should go to the children's hospital because the rights are owned by a children's hospital

02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:16.480
That's really cool

02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:22.080
But a lot of people don't listen and do that. So, you know, it's kind of a hand wash at this point

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:23.760
but

02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:25.760
I digress

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.360
I digress uh my point being

02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:32.640
So with Peter Pan. Mm-hmm

02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:35.760
Wait, hold on. What was I saying?

02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:39.360
Oh, hook. Yeah, we were talking about hook

02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:42.800
So it's really interesting because Peter Pan actually in the book

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:47.040
Takes Wendy's daughter Jane with her kind of like how

02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:52.080
When Disney made Return to Neverland the sequel that does introduce you to the fact that

02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:55.840
Wendy grows up and has a daughter named Jane. Yeah, you know in a son

02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:59.360
and so he actually does take Jane to

02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:03.760
Like Neverland and she becomes the very first quote-unquote lost girl

02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:08.320
But when hook happens we we pass over Jane and we meet Moira

02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:12.000
Who is

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.160
Wendy's great granddaughter and Peter is just so enamored with love

02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:19.760
He's like, I don't want to go back because he now has something

02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:22.320
to stay for

02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:27.440
It's kind of weird he just like goes after one daughter after the other

02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:33.360
Well, because he wants to keep the bloodline coming to Neverland because they're great storytellers apparently

02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:38.880
Yeah, but like when he when he finds that one and it gets like I I love using this the zing

02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:41.280
the zing

02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:43.760
You know the hotel Transylvania zing

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:51.760
Um, he's just like, yeah, no, I'm staying and then of course in in the hook timeline. It just goes all awry

02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:53.360
Hmm

02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:59.840
Now I will say my favorite rendition of peter pan is the live action peter pan that came out in like 2000

02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:03.200
With that one boy jeremy with the focus aim is

02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:06.560
Yeah, and the hot in the hot rendition of yeah

02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:09.600
Yes, I like had this really weird like

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:15.520
Romantic subplot between captain hook and wendy where captain hook was kind of oh wait. Do you mean the more recent one?

02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:22.000
Um, no not pan because pan was dog stockwater. I didn't even watch that one

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:29.760
I have to it was it. Yeah, it's one of jeremy's something. Um, it would have been peter pan from 2003

02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:37.760
Yes, yes. Oh, yeah, wait. Oh, yeah, jason eyes explain captain hook

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:41.120
And he was hot. Yeah, that's so true

02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:46.960
And like honestly if if I were to put together like a peter pan watch along

02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:50.560
I would show that peter pan from 2003 followed by hook

02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:58.480
So true because that would be the best way to watch it because you kind of get like this nice fun story where it's like

02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:00.560
Oh, okay, you get a really

02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:04.400
Book accurate peter pan and then you get like fan fiction that is hook

02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:11.920
Sorry, I'm staring at pictures of the movie because I'm like my memory is being jogged

02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:14.000
I'm like, wow

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.160
I love that. I do believe mr.

02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:20.080
Mr. Smee was always played by

02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:22.640
Yes, me

02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:26.400
Let's see. Mr. Smee was always played by um, um, um

02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:33.120
Uh, oh man. The name is the main the name is uh escaping me. I have no idea

02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:39.120
Uh, he was he was eddie valiant in who frank roger rabbit. Oh

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
You're right. Oh my god

02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:44.640
It's just

02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:51.280
He he plays a really good schnee. He does. You're not that's so and mario. You're right. Oh my god

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:54.800
He's also mario on the live action mario the first one

02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:59.760
Oh, that one was so goofy drunk off his drunk off his ass. Yeah, essentially

02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:08.960
But I don't think he placed me in the 2003 peter pan. I think he's gone by then. Yeah, I don't think he did. Um

02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:15.200
Peter being the grim reaper neverland is the afterlife in a shadow was a demon following him

02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:18.720
Interesting theory

02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:25.520
Oh, uh to answer miss morgan, I've seen twisted the musical but miss shabby doesn't like musical

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:27.840
I don't like musicals

02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:32.000
Yes, please do tell me

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:38.320
Okay, so twisted is basically like a retelling of a laden, but it focuses on jafar more than it does a laden

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.840
Really, it's actually a very good musical. I highly recommend it and I know you hate musicals

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:47.920
I know you do but

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.240
It's star kid musicals are a are a are a fish of a different color

02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:55.760
Like they are rainbow fish to me. Well, explain the plot to me

02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:58.560
Okay elaborate further

02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:00.880
so if you can't imagine

02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:03.920
twisted takes place towards the beginning of

02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:06.480
a laden essentially

02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:12.240
But instead of jafar like being an asshole like he is in the original movie jafar is actually this well meaning

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:14.720
royal vizier who just wants to do

02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:20.560
Good things for the kingdom, but everyone thinks that everything is his fault because he is the royal vizier

02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:27.680
But he's taking up the mantle after a bunch of corrupt royal viziers who only believe in the golden rule that is

02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:30.800
get paid

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:33.520
whereas jafar uh

02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:40.880
Is more on the side of do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Okay interesting

02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:49.200
Everyone is a is a bastardization of themselves including the princess who doesn't have a name. She just goes by princess. That's funny

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:53.280
You have captain of the guard who's really funny. He has

02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:58.880
Um, you have a laden who is a 32 year old man

02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:08.240
Who they make him really creepy and he just he's an asshole. He steals everything. Oh, I need to I need to look up pictures of

02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:11.200
Yes

02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:17.120
And honestly the acting is really good. I would love to just sit down and watch this with you

02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:23.200
And you also find out the jafar had a loving wife who he loved

02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:29.200
Based off of charizard. You know the uh story teller of a thousand and one

02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:30.640
night

02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:36.240
Sorry, I'm looking at the cast pictures and this is goofy. Wait, is this supposed is this right by the same person who wrote wicked?

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.200
Not wicked. No because it looks they have the same exact

02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:43.520
like

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:48.000
Cover it's sort of a it's sort of a play on wicked whereas wicked. I do like wicked

02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:50.320
I did watch wicked wicked. It's like the only musical way

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:53.280
And lion king was very good

02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:55.920
Uh, then I think you would absolutely adore

02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.080
Twisted all right. I might have we might have to watch that together then

02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:08.320
Yes, and it's on youtube like the whole thing. Oh sick. Okay, perfect because star kid always puts their musicals on youtube

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:10.400
All right

02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:17.040
I might be able to stomach a musical because the plot is very intriguing and again. I do like cool twists on

02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.880
Already told stories like that. So I really liked wicked for the reason. I can't wait for the wicked movie to come out

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:26.320
also a really good thing about uh

02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:32.320
About twisted is you know how in Aladdin like the movie Aladdin like the cartoon

02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.040
there's like that prince who's like a throwaway gag where he goes to meet the princess and

02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:43.680
Jasmine sticks her tiger upon him and yeah, and all you remember is like he has funny boxers and he's just storming back to

02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:45.920
Oh, yeah, because it frips his pants off. Yeah

02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:50.480
He actually is a character a likeable character with a likeable song

02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:57.120
They give him a whole like it's so funny when like sometimes uh spin-offs like elaborate

02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:00.640
Unusually like throw away at like NPC like characters

02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.360
It's then they give him some backstory. I love that

02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:06.960
Oh my god

02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:12.240
He's a huge plot point and twisted. I don't know so many of you guys like musicals

02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:14.880
I

02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:20.000
Love musicals. Oh my my my audience likes musicals too. Apparently. I'm very surprised

02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:24.000
I can I can introduce you to some that you might actually like

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:27.920
Oh like

02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:32.320
I don't know if I don't know if you've ever given it a try but uh, I'll give Roger and

02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:37.600
Roger and Hammerstein Cinderella with brandy and Whitney Houston's pretty good. Oh

02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:41.280
Don't even get me. I had that movie on

02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:44.400
I loved that movie

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
I love brandy cinderella

02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:50.720
Oh my god

02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:54.720
Of course, I'm a I'm a black girl. How could I not like this?

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:01.840
So good

02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:05.040
Oh my god, I forgot that that was technically a musical

02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:09.120
I think I didn't mind them as much when I was a kid now. I'm just like I'm irritated

02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:16.400
I had I had I had my boss described to her co to her grandson because we went to go see wonka during christmas

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:23.520
That a musical is just a movie where the dialogue turns cursive sometimes the dialogue turns cursive

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:26.480
Okay, I have seen descendants. I won't lie. I have watched

02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:29.840
I think two of the descendants movies

02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:36.080
I know that a christian chenna with is in one and she's got a bomb musical number that I really like

02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.040
I think there's a third one

02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:43.200
I know that they're coming out with an alice in wonderland one, but I've never seen them

02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:45.680
interesting

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:50.960
Mm-hmm. I've also never actually watched high school musical because it was so advertised so heavily

02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:55.520
I was just like I ain't watching this. I liked high school musical. Okay. Maybe I did like musicals

02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:01.840
I was like, uh, and I said I didn't watch a lot of musicals. Oh, yeah. I know I liked high school musical

02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:04.480
I pretended to hate it

02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:06.480
But I secretly liked it

02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:08.560
I really like get your head in the game

02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:13.280
I remember trying to do the and that and we're all in this together the choreography. Oh

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.200
I hate myself for that

02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:19.840
My only my only regret is I got on the glee train too late

02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:24.480
I don't like glee though. I tried watching glee my parents liked glee a lot

02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:28.480
I don't blame you for not liking glee though because it's like digrassy

02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:31.440
Yeah

02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:34.960
That's a good grassy hilarious

02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:38.560
I don't I haven't watched a grassy in the longest time

02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.200
I I'm wondering how it aged

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:48.080
You should do you should do a watch along the watch along the grassy watch and this drake in a wheelchair just hanging out

02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:51.200
um, I mean, I'd rather watch misfits

02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:54.320
or freaks and geeks

02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:56.160
um

02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:57.360
I don't

02:41:57.360 --> 02:41:59.280
Have you ever seen freaks and geeks freaks and geeks?

02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:01.920
No, I don't think I've ever seen freaks

02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:09.920
You would love freaks and geeks son. Oh my god. I think probably with seth rogan and

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:12.800
His friend that always does james franco

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:16.800
I think

02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:20.960
Maybe I might like it because I did like uh, the whitest kids, you know

02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:27.280
You would okay. You definitely like it. You definitely will either it's like it's so goofy

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:32.000
We love goofy and then you also have um, oh, what's her name?

02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:36.000
I always forget her name

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:43.040
Her funny name goofy is canonically the only disney character that has had sex. I yeah, he

02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:45.200
Goofy gets it

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.680
Yeah, he can he can get it. Yes

02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:50.880
I forget like he's got a son. Yeah

02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:57.200
Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I misspoke pete also has had relations more than relations

02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:01.360
Well, yeah, he has a smoking hot wife named peg

02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:03.040
True

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:09.760
That's right. Actually a beautiful daughter. He has two children. All right, so I guess only the dogs can reproduce in this

02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:12.800
Well pizza cat

02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:14.320
Pizza cat

02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:15.840
Yeah pizza cat

02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:17.360
What?

02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:20.720
Yep, he has pistol. He has peg. He has pj

02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:28.880
Egg like pete it's a cat. That's why he hates mickey mouse so much, but he's super chill with goofy

02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:35.360
My life is a lie

02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:38.560
I had no idea. I thought he was just a short-eared dog

02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:41.280
Not either cat

02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:45.600
Pistol pete is the youngest daughter of pete and peg that appeared in goof troop

02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:48.480
Mm-hmm

02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:50.800
It's funny because

02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.880
In the series max is 11 and a half years old moves his father and their cat waffles

02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:57.520
So it's like they own a cat and there's cat people

02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:03.440
Well, to be fair pete had a dog and it was like a real bougie dog

02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:06.480
Oh, I remember this from goof troop. Yeah

02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:11.040
His voice by Nancy Cartwright. Oh, yeah, who boys Bart Simpson

02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:14.720
Yep, she's been in the industry a lot. Yeah

02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:20.480
I've been watching um game grumps play like the putt putt and she voiced in some of the

02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:22.080
the

02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:24.080
Super ever going it's called

02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:26.800
Whatever company that made those games

02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:29.600
Super humongous. Yeah

02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:33.600
Yeah, I'm just like man. I never played any of these games. I kind of wish I did

02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:39.040
My favorite putt putt is putt putt saves the zoo. Putt putt saves the zoo. I remember watching them play that

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:41.680
It's pretty goofy. Um

02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:44.240
Yeah, I think I think it was before my time

02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:46.560
the putt putt games

02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:50.720
I think they're on sale on the steam sale now. That'll be funny to play

02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:55.360
I I kind of want to play pajama sam though

02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:58.880
Pajama sam. Oh, yeah, I watched game of play pajama sam

02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:01.760
Or that was that was good too

02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:04.400
there's like really cute point and click adventures and

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.760
I think actually maybe I'll recommend mercy to play one of those because mercy has gets motion sick

02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:13.200
And so I think she would probably appreciate kind of a cutesy goofy

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:15.360
point click

02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:17.360
Maybe she's already played one

02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:20.720
Maybe or she might like monkey island

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:23.200
What's monkey island?

02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:25.760
Monkey island is like a pirate

02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:29.280
adventure sort of like point and click adventure

02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:31.600
But I don't know too much about it

02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:35.120
But I but people are always recommending to play it

02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:41.200
Maybe if she played that because then she would can wear her little eye patch and then she can cosplay as a little pirate

02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:42.400
Yeah, yeah

02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:48.080
She usually cosplays as the characters in the games that she plays like she was mario the other day and now we call her mercy

02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:50.240
Oh, it was very funny

02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:56.480
By madame you're 56. That's true. So it was it was after my time actually

02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:59.200
This the super humongous games

02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:01.840
Oh

02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:05.200
All right, P. But now you can play them with your computer. Yeah

02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:09.600
I was too poor as a child to afford them before

02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:12.560
back when I was

02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:14.800
Born in 19 fort. That's not

02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:18.960
I don't know. I can't I can't really math. So like can I

02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:24.720
I like how misdreavus is just in between us this entire time during this conversation

02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:31.440
I know just like minding her own business. She's in her own lane. Yeah. She's hanging out

02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:34.800
Oh

02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:36.800
All right

02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:38.800
That was a good tangent for 40 minutes

02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:42.080
My dad

02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:48.000
No, please don't ever don't ever apologize. Literally. I I told you I was streaming till like 4 a.m. Yes

02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:50.480
today technically

02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:53.600
Because I was just going on tangents just talking about absolutely nothing

02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:59.600
Oh my god, this is great. I also just like getting lore like

02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:03.360
TV lore from you and cartoon lore

02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:09.200
Man, I I can go off on like any sort of cartoon without trying

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.880
My favorite though has been like pebble and the penguin

02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:17.440
But I won't get you started because we'll be here for two hours. Did she just start watching that?

02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:20.240
I I watch it every week

02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:28.880
Sorry, I like it's funny watching my muppet bounce

02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:34.320
Also, my favorite thing to say right now is rest in peace martin short

02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:37.680
Is he dead? Yeah, I'm like, no, he's dead

02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:41.920
No, he's not dead, but it's past his bedtime and I'm hope he's sleeping. Well

02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:46.880
I hope if you're sleeping well

02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:50.320
I hope you're sleeping. Well, mr. Martin short. I love you

02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:58.720
Uh great comedian him and uh, I love him and

02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:01.600
What's his face?

02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:04.320
They're always it together in something

02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:10.240
Oh my god, I'm gonna they're literally in no murder no murders in the building together

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.200
Uh

02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:16.400
It can't be Andy dick everybody. No, it's not any dick

02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.160
Everybody hates Andy dick. Oh my god. I'm gonna I'm just gonna look up

02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:28.240
Because I I like martin short, I even liked him in that

02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:31.200
Steve martin. Thank you

02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:33.360
Steve martin so funny

02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:39.840
Yes, I liked I liked martin short in that terrible dorthy returns movie. That was like basically

02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:43.280
The producer's live action in real life

02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:47.360
If you don't know what the producers is about

02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.560
Which is a musical by the way, but it was like a movie that is called a musical before it was a musical

02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:55.040
it's basically about like

02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:03.280
Uh an accountant and a producer getting together and the accountant's like hey your books are wrong and the producer's like look man

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:09.440
I'm on hard times. Can't you just move a few decimals and then the accountant's like, you know,

02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:13.680
You know, you could make more money with a flop than with a hit

02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:19.840
Because if you make a flop, you don't have to pay back what you spent on the flop

02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:24.480
Which is like what a lot of a lot of uh hollywood companies do

02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:31.760
Right now where if they considered like a form of media a flop, they'll write it off for taxes and they can't like

02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:34.480
Make that's so stupid

02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:37.920
It is it's how we get a lot of lost media and I hate it. Damn

02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:41.280
Damn them

02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:43.520
Someone's asking where your clothes are at

02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:45.920
I'm a dog

02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:48.320
I'm wearing a collar. That's my clothes. Yeah

02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:51.280
She's clothes. She's wearing her collar

02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:53.600
Let's think about me where your clothes at

02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:57.680
I'm like the dog like walks into a room

02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:00.560
Oh

02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:06.880
Like you don't go around looking at like family guy wondering like man. Why isn't brian wearing a shirt? That's a good point

02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:11.200
I'm only wearing clothes because my bunny boobies are very large

02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:14.720
And that's I just don't think it's the proper thing to do

02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:21.680
Obviously, you're very talented. That's why you have clothes. Yeah, although I wonder if I took my bra off

02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:24.960
Would I just have velvet?

02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:26.320
Hmm

02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:32.640
You know, I imagine maybe I had considered giving you a muppet nipples, but we didn't do it

02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:35.280
Yeah, the other art you gave me muppet nipples

02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:38.880
Well, yeah, but that was for a comedy. Yeah

02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:41.920
So, I mean I'm

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:45.680
Because you don't have any nipples. That means I don't have any nipples. We're just nipple monopolist

02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:52.160
Like if I had like legs like if you sewed me up and you like made me like a full body muppet

02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:54.720
I probably have I probably have mupples

02:50:55.760 --> 02:50:57.920
Yeah, I kind of lower down on your belly. Yeah

02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:03.280
Yeah, like especially in this form, but who knows who knows if it's between like two

02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:06.880
Four and six who knows we'll roll a dice when we get there

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
roll for mupples

02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:12.160
Roll for mupples one d6

02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:15.600
No muppet milk. Uh, sorry. No, I don't think

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:19.600
I don't have organs

02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:23.520
We yeah, we don't have well you could pour milk on us and suck it out like

02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:27.200
Like a security blanket sort of thing. Yeah

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:30.480
Like use my little muppet

02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:33.200
Booby is a security blanket

02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:35.440
Yeah, I was a little passy

02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:39.760
Yeah, just pour a little milk on her and then just suck it out. Yeah, see that works

02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:43.840
Yeah, it's kind of like what people do with their hoodie strings like delicious

02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:51.360
Honestly hoodie strings are quite delicious. I will honey, especially when their agla is just like just right

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:56.720
Oh, I know what you're talking about and I 100% agree and like chewing on that

02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:01.840
And and like getting the knot undone and then redoing it later. Hmm

02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:11.200
They don't get it. This is why we're on the short bus and uh, the magic school bus

02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:16.800
We don't understand the science and miss frizzle just keeps us there. Yeah

02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:25.920
Okay, they don't have organs we can go as deep as we want without worry of wrecking you can still rip us

02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:30.480
Well, yeah, but we could be sewn back up. Yeah, we could be sewn back up

02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:35.840
So I guess like as long as we're forever it immortal in the muppet form

02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:41.360
It it could get as violent as possible. But like cleaning ourselves would be kind of frustrating

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:44.240
Do you think they would just throw us in the washing machine?

02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.280
No, we don't need to breathe. So I think that would work out

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.120
Yeah, but I'm gonna request goggles and

02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:56.640
Because I can't see underwater neither can I I didn't know that people can normally see underwater

02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:03.760
I didn't know that either. It's it makes my eyes all stingy. I know it hurts my eyes real bad even if it's in like a normal clear

02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:07.760
Water thing. I thought nobody could see underwater

02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:09.760
Same

02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:11.760
Apparently, it just means I'm blind

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:17.440
Do you also hate getting water up your nose? Yes, it burns. I I hate water on my nose

02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:19.680
So bad

02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:23.360
Like you take a washcloth and you dip it in like the shower water and then you wipe your face

02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:26.720
You don't go like full face into the water. No, exactly

02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:29.680
I get you. I'm good on that

02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:33.360
Or like I like plug my nose

02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:38.000
Plug your nose close your eyes and just a quick

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:42.720
And then that you're out. Yeah, just like what's that? I saw that animation

02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:48.160
Oh, wait, it's yeah, what's when the dwarves from snow white are washing their face

02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:50.880
God that meant that that scene makes me

02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:53.280
Irrationally angry. Why?

02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:57.760
Because I would try to do it and that's how I learned that I hate what getting water up my nose

02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:01.040
You do grab a dub is up and

02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:10.320
And and then the fact that oh man, I'm going to go off on another tangent grumpy was absolutely right the clocks

02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:12.400
Though white as a fucking trifle

02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:15.120
Because

02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:16.640
Because

02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:21.440
Like I don't blame grumpy for being a woman hater. She brought a lot of trouble. Yeah

02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:26.160
They were just chilling and she did just like barge on right in do everything

02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:29.040
And she brought a witch

02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:34.640
Like if somebody came into my personal space and cleaned up everything my organized chaos

02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:36.320
I'd be so upset

02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:38.640
And then like you hear the distress. It's like

02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:44.400
Somebody washed my cup sugar is gone. It takes time to develop a sugar crust

02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:48.560
It takes time that bitch cleaned his cup

02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:53.840
And you know, she probably didn't clean it properly. She had the animals do it and they probably licked that

02:54:54.000 --> 02:55:00.880
Oh, yeah, it's all it's not even properly cleaned. It's it's even technically dirtier than when she they how they left it

02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:03.760
Oh

02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:05.760
gross

02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:10.720
And then she had the nerve to shame them. It's like did you wash your hands before supper?

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:16.400
Bitch, you're in their house. How are you gonna make the man? I know she just comes in all high and mighty

02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:20.160
Like princesses, man. She wasn't I am I am

02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:27.760
I have come up with the opinion that snow white is not just a movie about a princess who's evil stepmother

02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:34.020
Like once her dead it is about two doms in a kingdom fighting for supremacy

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.800
Because so light is a developing dom

02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:41.280
And she's those little men

02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:48.400
Yes, the queen is a developed dom and she doms the kingdom. Yeah, she does this for beauty and her power

02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:56.720
But like at the same time she's like, oh no an up-and-coming bitch and that up-and-coming bitch is using her powers

02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:58.080
Yeah

02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:03.680
Unbeknownst to anybody to get things done the way she wants. She domps the forest. Oh my god

02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:06.480
She doms the little men

02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:12.240
And she basically doms the heart of the prince who's just kind of waltzes into her. I know he just like shows up

02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:13.760
That's kind of weird

02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:15.840
When she's singing and he just shows up. They're all weird

02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:19.760
I think the queen is the only in the dwarf is the only rational ones here

02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:21.840
right

02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:23.680
damn

02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:25.680
But yeah, that's how I fell about snow white

02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:27.680
Hahaha

02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:36.160
Snow white being a soft dom actually makes sense and she's around 14. Oh, I forgot how young she was

02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:40.480
It's just she be no. No. No. I'm not snow white

02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:43.440
I'm not snow white either

02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:46.000
I was about to start singing wishing well

02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:49.920
I'm wishing

02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:52.640
I'm wishing

02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:55.600
For the one I love

02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:02.480
I thought we're gonna do it for a moment. Oh, yeah, but it's always to find me

02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:05.520
to find

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400
Today

02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:17.440
Now that I found you here's what I have to say

02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:19.520
Hey

02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:25.680
And then he just goes in for it and she's like, oh my god, damn just like that

02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:33.200
Jesus oh my god, I think I got the vapors the vapors

02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:39.200
Oh

02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:43.760
No, she'd be just Jessica Ravis says has to help her out the laundry she

02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:52.240
Uh goes from soft on snow white and everything to mean like yeah, so I think about snow white so casually

02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:54.800
okay, yes, but um

02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:56.240
in short

02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:59.680
If you do use our Muppet bodies for your gooning purposes

02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:03.920
You have to make sure that you either align us with something

02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:07.840
Or clean us properly because that just isn't fair to us, you know

02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:11.760
Right, don't just throw a rag at us and call it a day

02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:17.440
You know, we're not proper aftercare. Yeah, don't use us as a rag

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.680
Oh, no, I just realized I never told you my ratatouille theories

02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:29.200
And we'll save that for the next episode

02:58:31.840 --> 02:58:34.320
Next time on tracking balls

02:58:38.800 --> 02:58:40.800
All right, I'm gonna go to bed

02:58:42.720 --> 02:58:46.000
You'll have to you guys will have to find out in the next episode of smash your pass

02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:51.200
We'll figure out a time. Let's slap it on my schedule next week. Um, but good night

02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:56.240

Yeah, always fun to have Trinket on and I'll just spend time with her in our an hour muppets together

02:59:14.960 --> 02:59:16.960
We're too powerful

02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:19.040
too

02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:22.000
We could yap for hours and be actual yapping

02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:27.840
All right, bye guys

02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:32.240

02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:35.040
Wipe your butt

02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:37.040
Put a little water on it

02:59:37.840 --> 02:59:43.520
And don't do that single paper bowls yet. Don't do it. Don't do it. You stinky

02:59:44.400 --> 02:59:46.400
