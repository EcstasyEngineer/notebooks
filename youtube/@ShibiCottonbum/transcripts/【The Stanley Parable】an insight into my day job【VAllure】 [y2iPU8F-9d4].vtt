I fell asleep from ICStream, I did. I fell asleep to her ASMR.

03:49.120 --> 03:54.120
I woke up momentarily because her redirect was strawny.

03:54.120 --> 03:59.120
So I heard strawny's voice for a couple seconds and I took off my headphones because she was like...

04:09.120 --> 04:11.120
I need to wake up.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.120
I need to wake up.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.120
I need to wake up.

04:20.120 --> 04:24.120
My cats also are eating in the background.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.120
Thank you.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.120
You have with you to wake up.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.120
Here is my donation of virginity.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.120
Oh, I can hear myself.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.120
Oh no, fuck.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.120
Gross, gross, gross, I hate that.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.120
It's because I went and after the last stream,

06:27.120 --> 06:30.120
I tried fixing my microphone again.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.120
But I guess it's still not good enough.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.120
Alas, I give up.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.120
I like...

06:39.120 --> 06:44.120
Am I going to have to like get strawny in here or something?

06:44.120 --> 06:47.120
Are we going to bring double sheebie?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.120
No, no double sheebie.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.120
Oh, Reina's here.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.120
Hello, Reina.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.120
What's up?

06:51.120 --> 06:55.120
Oh, let me move my headphones so you can lay in your bed.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.120
And Fia must be munching.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.120
Oh my gosh, please don't knock over my drink on my own keyboard.

07:03.120 --> 07:09.120
I usually just throw my headphones above my mic arm.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.120
I'm not hearing double sheebie ads because I shut myself up real quick.

07:14.120 --> 07:17.120
Because I was like, why is my desktop audio going crazy?

07:17.120 --> 07:22.120
And I realized my thing was unmuted because I had been listening to myself,

07:22.120 --> 07:27.120
fighting with my lovely AT2020 that I've had for over a decade.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.120
You're the best microphone ever, baby girl.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.120
But yeah, double sounds twice as good.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.120
I remember my ASMR stream, I was double for like half the stream

07:38.120 --> 07:41.120
and everybody was like, yeah, it was actually sounded okay.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.120
And I'm like, what the fuck?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.120
Reina, are you waking up?

07:51.120 --> 07:55.120
Reina, I was also almost late because Reina was coughing up her ball.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.120
My poor old lady.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.120
Now she came out to snuggle with me.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.120
So I was like watching her.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.120
And then I'm like, oh fuck, I have to pee.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.120
And I'm like, lady, are you okay?

08:06.120 --> 08:09.120
And then I'm like, oh, oh.

08:10.120 --> 08:14.120
Imagine having an ass in an AT2020 mic as opposed to a shirt.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.120
Okay.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.120
They cut, I thought it was fine.

08:20.120 --> 08:24.120
Although what, do you want me to throw a shirt on my, my throne?

08:24.120 --> 08:27.120
Do you want you guys want to drop $400?

08:27.120 --> 08:29.120
Sure, go for it.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.120
I don't think that'll fix my audio.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.120
It's definitely more of a, what's it called?

08:35.120 --> 08:37.120
Settings thing.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.120
Because my AT2020 is fine.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.120
I see only pokes fun at you.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.120
I haven't heard a poke phone at the others yet.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.120
It's because I, you said I have nice reactions.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.120
And they are the only ones that I will allow that tease me, my girls,

08:51.120 --> 08:53.120
because nobody else can tease me.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.120
Or you will get caught.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.120
I will come to your house and something will go up your butt.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.120
It's not going to be nice.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.120
It's probably going to go out of your mouth and then you'll pass away.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.120
Haha, no, it's fine though.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.120
I think your levels had steam percent to be fine for the mother should be cool.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.120
Nice promise.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.120
Yes.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.120
Pinky swear promise.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.120
Don't shame others of using other mics on the processing.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.120
I could, you know, I could just be like,

09:23.120 --> 09:27.120
for the first like month of being in calls with strongy,

09:27.120 --> 09:29.120
she just had this gamer microphone.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.120
She sounded like fucking Tyler one.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.120
And I was funny as hell.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.120
It was so good.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.120
Yeah, keep you in line.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.120
I don't know where my crop is.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.120
It's behind me.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.120
I feel like reaching for it.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.120
Because I'm raining on my arms.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.120
Oh, hey, fancy meeting you again so soon.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.120
Oh, hello.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.120
Scots is from Tyler one.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.120
I'm funny.

09:54.120 --> 09:59.120
Yeah, I've had my I've had a lie detector C920 for a webcam

09:59.120 --> 10:02.120
that I use for like the cat cam and hand cams and stuff.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.120
And then I've had my 80 2020 for such a long time.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.120
Those are the only things that have not broken on me.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.120
Everything else broken.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.120
Like my I had like my favorite.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.120
I forget what the mouse is called.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.120
Let me see if I can pick it up with my feet because it's just on the floor.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.120
Still plugged in.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.120
It's a I love this mouse.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.120
It's a large attack.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.120
I can't see it.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.120
Does it have the number on it?

10:35.120 --> 10:36.120
I don't know.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.120
It's the one that shroud uses.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.120
I had just the regular one before that and the prices shot up on them

10:41.120 --> 10:45.120
because shroud whatever was using it or someone else.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.120
Yeah, it's audio technica.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.120
Yeah, it's audio technica.

10:49.120 --> 10:53.120
And I asked him starting talking to Xbox controller microphone.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
Feet mouse.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.120
Yeah, I don't know if you guys heard that lovely ASMR if my microphone picked it up.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.120
I was so mad at like all the ones I got of that Logitech mouse

11:06.120 --> 11:12.120
just that one of the keys gets sticky like my right click gets sticky.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.120
And I was I took it apart to clean it and there's nothing wrong with it.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.120
And this is like just gets fucked up.

11:18.120 --> 11:22.120
And I asked the person, oh, is it like ghost clicking or double clicking

11:22.120 --> 11:23.120
because it would do that too.

11:23.120 --> 11:26.120
And they're like, no, when I bought off eBay and I'm like, fuck you guys.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.120
I'm an AT 2035.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.120
I love and I do it.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.120
Logitech G502.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.120
I might I might be.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.120
Yeah.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.120
Sticky.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.120
No, like the not like sticky like something's in it.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.120
Like sticky like it is sticks.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.120
I can't I don't know how else to explain it to you.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.120
That's a switch probably.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.120
Yeah.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.120
Yeah, I know.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.120
Like it's it's notorious for that.

11:50.120 --> 11:57.120
And so because I was doing research on it and I'm like, I'm not going to try to even bother with this.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.120
Okay, let me just read out in the Dario's because I don't know if the text speaks works.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.120
Let me see.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.120
Actually, can I?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.120
Nadario tipped $5.

12:12.120 --> 12:17.120
Apologies for underestimating your knowledge in IC's stream earlier, madam.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.120
Please forgive me.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
Hey.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
Buying deeply.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.120
Guys.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.120
Here is my donation virginity.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.120
I think it's working.

12:24.120 --> 12:30.120
Thank you for giving me your donation virginity.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.120
It is an honor.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
Switch to the G.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.120
Oh, are you okay?

12:39.120 --> 12:40.120
Just needs anything?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
I just switched to the G.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
305 for seven years.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.120
What a valuable part.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.120
Yeah.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.120
Let's go text to speech.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.120
Hell yeah.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.120
Okay, cool.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
Just don't say anything bad.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.120
I'll fight you.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.120
Relatively.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.120
Please.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.120
Like guys, they won't want a decision.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.120
But yeah, I set that all up.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.120
So it's cool.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.120
I remember the first time someone ever donated to me.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.120
I cried so hard.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.120
I would ever get how old I was.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.120
And I think I was like 18.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.120
Streaming on Twitch.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.120
And I was streaming to like seven people.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.120
Like Counter Strike.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.120
And my setup was worse than it was now.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.120
And they sent me like five bucks and they're like keep it up.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.120
I think literally that like that one person donating

13:36.120 --> 13:39.120
motivated me because I was just so honored

13:39.120 --> 13:44.120
that someone took their cash that they worked really hard for.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.120
They had a day job.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.120
Or like hell if it was their parents money.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.120
And they decided to give it to me out of everybody else.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.120
And so I literally cried on stream for 10 minutes.

13:57.120 --> 14:01.120
Like for yeah, Rose investment is paying off 100%.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.120
Yeah, shout out to that first person who ever donated to me.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.120
No idea who you are, but thanks.

14:08.120 --> 14:12.120
Don't know and subscribers milestones.

14:12.120 --> 14:16.120
And here we are a niche internet celebrity.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.120
They don't know I'm a VTuber.

14:18.120 --> 14:22.120
Every time I leave my apartment, that's what I think about.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.120
They don't know I'm a VTuber.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.120
I think it's a patine.

14:32.120 --> 14:35.120
Wondering if I can pick up Rena's purrs.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.120
Purr to like.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.120
Good mums.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.120
Miss mums.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.120
Okay.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.120
Yeah, she's she's my lovely girl.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.120
Cat docks.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.120
Rena just like to hang out with me.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.120
And even if I'm not touching her if she's just there next to me,

15:17.120 --> 15:18.120
she just she's purrs.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.120
She just loves hanging out with me and I love hanging out with her.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.120
I've had her since I was very, very young.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
She's very old now.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.120
But she's still got it.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.120
She's still kicking.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.120
She's my.

15:32.120 --> 15:36.120
She like is one of those pets that knows if you're like super stressed out.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
And she'll so anytime I'm super stressed out,

15:39.120 --> 15:41.120
she'll just come and she'll purr on me.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.120
Or her sister,

15:43.120 --> 15:45.120
she had a sister named Solay,

15:45.120 --> 15:47.120
Rena and Solay and they were very sweet.

15:48.120 --> 15:52.120
And her sister would come if I was having a really bad day.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.120
She would lick my tears off my face.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.120
Solay and then Rena would just purr on me.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.120
And it was very cute.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
My cat there.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.120
I love them to death.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.120
I love Siamese cats.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.120
They're so sweet.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.120
So sweet.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.120
And they're also really dog-like because they like will play fetch with you.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.120
And they're very vocal and I like that because Rena will just yell at me.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.120
My cat, me and his me house farts and leaves all.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.120
I've got a 17 year old cat myself.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.120
Old pet suppressors.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.120
Yes, exactly.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.120
With this one audio,

16:20.120 --> 16:22.120
I can determine the size and shape of your cat.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.120
And then I can use algorithms to narrow down whereabouts to.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.120
That'd be impressive.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.120
I'd be like, okay, you know what?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.120
You earned it.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.120
I have cat hair in my mouth.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
Oh my God.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.120
Rena.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.120
But enjoy a tipped $5.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.120
Oh, she be my madam.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.120
How I love to hear you don't really hear the words.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.120
I just think of your.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
What?

16:56.120 --> 16:59.120
You think of my what?

17:03.120 --> 17:05.120
I'm happy you guys are enjoying the Texas beach.

17:13.120 --> 17:16.120
Honestly, when TTS kind of like messes up stuff,

17:16.120 --> 17:18.120
it's like even funnier.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.120
Cause it's like, huh?

17:23.120 --> 17:24.120
Oh my God.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.120
I still have cat hair in my mouth.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.120
Rena.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.120
But oh my God.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.120
There's cat hair over my mic.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.120
Rena sheds a lot.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.120
For some, for a Siamese cat.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.120
I don't know why.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.120
She's a pure bread Siamese.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.120
I don't know why she sheds so much.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
Okay.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.120
Let's I want to see if this.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.120
Well, I'm going to give it another try.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.120
Thank you, sweetheart.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.120
Bon enjoy a tipped $5.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.120
Oh, she be my madam.

17:50.120 --> 17:53.120
How I love to hear you don't really hear the words.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.120
I just think of your strap.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
It's funny because it's just a comment.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.120
It says how I love to hear you.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.120
Yeah.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.120
I don't really hear the words.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
I just think of your shit.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.120
I don't know why it skips over how I love to hear you.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.120
Yeah.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.120
And so I'm going to give it another try.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.120
Thank you, sweetheart.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.120
I love to hear you.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.120
Yeah.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.120
It's so funny to me.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.120
Quick.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.120
Someone put this track script.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.120
Yeah.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.120
If you do that, I can just end it.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.120
It's poetic.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.120
You know, yeah.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.120
It's very poetic.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.120
Cat hair gets everywhere.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
Very true.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
Shedding is healthy though, right?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
Well, she's older.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.120
So I feel like she's can't groom herself that well.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.120
So I usually brush her once a day.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.120
But she's a, she's a sheddy motherfucker.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.120
I don't mean no.

18:46.120 --> 18:49.120
She likes, she likes to be held in my arms like a little baby.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.120
And she looks up at me as I give her forehead kisses.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.120
Even though she's, she's 14 years old.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.120
She's still, she's still kitten in my eyes.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.120
She also still acts like a kitten.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.120
Because she'll chase Boomi around if he's pissed her off enough.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.120
And it's the funniest thing to see.

19:04.120 --> 19:08.120
And then she'll like launch herself that a cat tree and jump there and then start yelling.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.120
And I'm like, ma'am, you're going to bust a hip.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
Yeah, so the best for me.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
Yeah, I could talk with my cats for hours.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.120
I mean, they put on my headphones.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.120
I'm just going to hear some scope.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
Sorry, is yawning?

19:27.120 --> 19:29.120
Cleverly disguised Samoyed Dog.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.120
Oh my gosh.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.120
One of my teachers had a Samoyed Dog and she brought,

19:33.120 --> 19:35.120
in his name was Sammy.

19:35.120 --> 19:38.120
You know, they always call him Sammy, like Samoyed Sammy's.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.120
So I don't know why she named the dog Sammy.

19:41.120 --> 19:45.120
But he was the fluffiest dog and I loved him.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.120
He was so fluffy.

19:47.120 --> 19:52.120
He was also giant because I was like seven when she brought him into class one time.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.120
I don't even know how she was allowed to do that.

19:54.120 --> 19:58.120
I think she was on vacation and she had a sub and she just came in anyways to show her dog.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.120
I don't even know.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.120
Yeah, they do shed a lot.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.120
Have you seen the acolyte? Is that out?

20:05.120 --> 20:10.120
I was pretty psyched by the trailer.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.120
I didn't even watch...

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
I was at Dagobah.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.120
No, I didn't watch.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.120
Oh my God, I haven't kept up.

20:19.120 --> 20:23.120
I haven't even watched the third season of the Mandalorian.

20:30.120 --> 20:34.120
Yeah, I never watched Andor because I watched like the first two episodes and I was like, I'm bored.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.120
Obi-Wan Kenobi was fucking bomb.

20:38.120 --> 20:46.120
I got those like lights, like those LED lights that match what's on the screen of your TV.

20:46.120 --> 20:55.120
And watching the fight between him and Vader with that just like with all the lights turned off was literally incredible.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.120
I didn't watch Ahsoka either.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.120
Although I should because I like that actress.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.120
I should watch the Bad Batch as well.

21:05.120 --> 21:10.120
I should have kept her in my throat.

21:11.120 --> 21:15.120
Also congrats on the order of magnitude Twitter growth.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
Thank you. Thank you.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.120
It's probably mostly just sex bots.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.120
So I'm not too concerned.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.120
Some ways are so hyper in my experience.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.120
Whenever I say hi to my dog or they want to do his play.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.120
Oh, that's cute.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.120
I like behind the TV.

21:27.120 --> 21:31.120
Yeah, Boba Fett went downhill.

21:32.120 --> 21:45.120
I liked the first part of Boba Fett, but then they brought up the fucking street gang Power Rangers that were like Victorian British people, cyberpunk, steampunk dudes.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.120
And I'm like, I'm done.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.120
I'm good.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.120
Who are these guys?

21:49.120 --> 21:57.120
I like the first half when he was with the the I'm blanking on everything man because I haven't watched the show since it came out.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.120
And again, I just woke up.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.120
So I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.120
Boba Fett.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.120
Boba Fett.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.120
You know, the sand peoples.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.120
Right.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.120
I remember.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
Yeah, and then it becomes.

22:14.120 --> 22:23.120
Yeah, then Mando shows up and I'm like, it's just a cleverly disguised like filler season of Mandalorian.

22:23.120 --> 22:30.120
Although I fucking love Pablo Pascal, Pedro Pascal.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.120
I never watched anything in your Star Wars or the Mandalorian was one of the good stories.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.120
Yeah, I highly recommend watching Mandalorian.

22:41.120 --> 22:49.120
Boba Fett got his loon Skywalker, but the newer Star Wars movies, I like like the first one was really good.

22:50.120 --> 22:58.120
But the last one and the one before it like I was, I was, I know me and my dad were disappointed.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.120
My mom was like also like what the hell is this?

23:01.120 --> 23:02.120
But like it.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.120
Yeah, I'm just too disappointed with the end of the second season to continue.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
Yeah, second season was a bummer.

23:11.120 --> 23:17.120
Wait, yeah, I just wrote all Rogue One is one of my favorite movies, Star Wars movies.

23:17.120 --> 23:24.120
Like I think it's like I have a soft spot in my heart for the prequels just because of how camp they are.

23:24.120 --> 23:31.120
But like for like newer movies, the Rogue One, I've seen so many times in the prequel.

23:31.120 --> 23:35.120
I'm not watching any Star Wars in the original movies and prequel movies.

23:35.120 --> 23:44.120
Yeah, like the first one, like what I wish they did is I wish they focused on Finn more because I feel like he should have been the main character instead of what's her fucking face.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.120
They gave him like it seemed like he had super pivotal role.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.120
They just joined it away from him.

23:50.120 --> 23:55.120
And I know like that actor was also really pissed off about that because just how the movies were flowing.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.120
It seemed like he was going to be whatever.

23:58.120 --> 24:04.120
And like how he like used the force and like lightsaber then he just fucking doesn't do it anymore.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.120
I'm like, all right.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.120
Actor something bodega whatever his name is.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
It's pretty pretty good actor too.

24:15.120 --> 24:24.120
And I like I like Daisy Ridley, but yeah, and I also just hate like the random love shit thrown in like spoiler alert.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.120
Well, I'm not going to say it in case you want to just like watch it after this.

24:28.120 --> 24:38.120
But at the in the last movie with the like love stuff or like the random like it just ended so poorly like the last movie and I'm like this is fucking stupid.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.120
This is so dumb.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
I was so mad.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.120
And I'm like, who's this random chick?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.120
Like who's that person?

24:44.120 --> 24:48.120
These are this is a whole side plot that I did not give a shit about.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.120
The tiger got me.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.120
I peed it because I was were abling the phone.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.120
You're trying to help me out, right?

24:59.120 --> 25:00.120
And I should have spread it.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.120
Yeah, exactly.

25:01.120 --> 25:07.120
I wish it kind of would have been like because like it's such a cool story what Finn had.

25:07.120 --> 25:19.120
Being a former trooper and then deciding to like like branch off from that and like go his own way and then meeting up with like I thought that was so cool.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.120
John Boyega.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.120
Yeah, I'm not Bodega.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.120
But like I was I was so.

25:30.120 --> 25:34.120
I was like, oh my God, like I want a cosplay as female Finn and now I'm like, no.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.120
No thanks.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.120
You play the follow series.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.120
I actually did not.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.120
I never play follow.

25:40.120 --> 25:47.120
I know I liked the TV show, although I know people were like crying because they people thought they retcon something.

25:47.120 --> 25:54.120
I did a lot of research on it because I'm a type of person just reads like every everything up on this series.

25:54.120 --> 26:01.120
If it's if I watch the show and don't do the original and I haven't consumed the original media of it.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.120
Yeah, exactly.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.120
It was such a bait switch.

26:03.120 --> 26:08.120
But however, I look when he fights that like shock trooper is probably one of my favorite scenes.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.120
The follow series was pretty good.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.120
I liked it.

26:15.120 --> 26:25.120
I hated Maximus's character with a passion because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for me.

26:25.120 --> 26:41.120
Because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for a knight in a squire to like deal with stuff or if he ended up doing what he did, just not being such a little bitch.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.120
Like, oh, his character was so annoying to me.

26:47.120 --> 26:54.120
Like the main girl, I really like the main girl because I watched this show recently before Fallout came out called Yellow Jackets.

26:55.120 --> 26:59.120
Seriously, highly fucking fucking recommend you watch Yellow Jackets.

26:59.120 --> 27:08.120
It is one of the best survival horror TV shows I've ever watched and so fucking good.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.120
I binged it in the first two seasons.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.120
Oh, no, don't worry.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.120
I'm not going to spoil it.

27:14.120 --> 27:18.120
But but she is one of the main characters in Yellow Jackets.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.120
And so I was already kind of biased.

27:19.120 --> 27:24.120
But then watching her in this, I just really, really fucking like the show.

27:24.120 --> 27:31.120
That the female volleyball team, it was actually a soccer team and they get lost in the wilderness and they have to do fucked up shit to survive.

27:31.120 --> 27:45.120
It was literally like, it reminded me a lot of the ritual and it reminded me a lot of what's it called, the game, Sons of the Forest.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.120
Yeah.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.120
So that was it was a really good show.

27:50.120 --> 27:57.120
And then I ended up watching Euphoria after that, not the one that you're thinking of the one about the angsty teenagers that do a lot of drugs.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.120
Because my friend was like, oh, you remind me of this character and I watched it.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.120
I'm like, why the fuck do I remind you of this character?

28:04.120 --> 28:06.120
I am nothing like this character.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.120
It's only because we look alike because I look like Zendaya.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.120
I don't I don't look like Zendaya.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.120
No, I'm taking that back.

28:12.120 --> 28:17.120
That woman is gorgeous beyond my beyond my dreams that I could ever be.

28:18.120 --> 28:25.120
But in terms of like the hair, the fit, sometimes the attitude, not the drugs.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.120
The only drugs I've only taken is my antidepressants.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
Before.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.120
Okie-tokie.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.120
Lucy and the ghoul felt like nails on the truck.

28:42.120 --> 28:46.120
But yeah, yeah, I also yeah, the ghoul story is really cool.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.120
Yeah, everybody everybody else.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.120
I was just like, I don't care about you.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.120
Yours and Dan.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.120
No, I'm not Zendaya.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.120
I'll go out together.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.120
You'll have to ask my boyfriend, Spiderman.

29:01.120 --> 29:06.120
But it was just it was just funny, but I really like that show.

29:06.120 --> 29:11.120
It's a shame that one of the one of the producers died and then one of the actors actually died.

29:11.120 --> 29:14.120
So from that show, so that's why it's been put off.

29:15.120 --> 29:20.120
But it was it was really like it was kind of depressing because I've known people that have grown up in similar situations.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.120
How is Timothy Shamalama Dingdong?

29:26.120 --> 29:28.120
I feel like he would be very whiny.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.120
It's the day of my favorite actress is VTuber.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
It's really cool.

29:32.120 --> 29:35.120
One of my friends was actually in a movie with her because she's an actress and she said she's super sweet.

29:35.120 --> 29:39.120
If I ever got okay VTuber ghoul meets Zendaya.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.120
I'm putting it up there.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
Never seen Zendaya.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.120
She'd be in the same room.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.120
What about the other Zendaya again?

29:50.120 --> 29:51.120
She gets it too.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.120
I'm not throwing shade at the series.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.120
Just pointed out in terms of the lower retcons.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.120
But there wasn't even lower retcons.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.120
There wasn't even lower retcons though.

30:00.120 --> 30:06.120
Like I will argue with that that for you because everybody's worried about shady sands.

30:06.120 --> 30:12.120
But just because they didn't specify the time that this thing went off that people are getting frustrated with it.

30:14.120 --> 30:18.120
Because I don't feel like they retcons fall out.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.120
What was it? 74?

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
I can't remember.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.120
I just want to say a quick hello before going to work.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.120
Enjoy work.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.120
I just remember that Tom Holland and Zendaya got engaged.

30:30.120 --> 30:35.120
Honestly, would 100% ship it because they're wholesome.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.120
76, New Vegas.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.120
I don't fucking know.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.120
We're all New Vegas.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
Again, I haven't played them.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.120
I literally own all of them because I buy stuff when it's on sale.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.120
I haven't played some.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.120
I was debating whether or not to play fall out New Vegas.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.120
Because I bought it and everything.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.120
When I was going to like the first thing that I play when I debut.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.120
But I think Shibi, Shibi.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.120
Strony is streaming it.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.120
Me and Strony like the same exact fucking games.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.120
Because I was like, I was going to do Assassin's Creed.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
I was going to do Skyrim.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.120
I was going to do fall out.

31:14.120 --> 31:17.120
You would watch her for like actual skill and endurance streams.

31:17.120 --> 31:22.120
And then you'd watch me for my absolute shit show that it would be.

31:22.120 --> 31:27.120
Maybe I'll get to those eventually, but I'll probably do them like months down the line.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.120
You went off after New Vegas.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.120
Yeah, exactly.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.120
Like he said, it's like in people.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.120
People think that it went off before.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.120
So.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.120
Sharon Brainsall.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.120
Strony 2.0.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.120
Hey, she calls me her 2.0.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.120
I'm her twin.

31:47.120 --> 31:51.120
I'm just the round American version.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.120
It's always fun watching the first time I play New Vegas.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.120
I've heard, I've heard.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.120
I remember reading places.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.120
They're like, oh, this person is playing New Vegas because the show like a bunch of people will play New Vegas.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.120
And they're like.

32:10.120 --> 32:14.120
I only watch like the first two hours because most of the time they only play the first two hours.

32:15.120 --> 32:19.120
But it's still a fun unique experience because everyone experiences is differently.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
What you drinking?

32:20.120 --> 32:25.120
I'm drinking some iced lemon and a tea.

32:26.120 --> 32:31.120
I, uh, was it called Vokeby is like a Korean brand.

32:31.120 --> 32:34.120
They have this really delicious ginger lemon tea that I adore.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.120
Skyrim together and co-op.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.120
Oh, is that a thing?

32:38.120 --> 32:39.120
That'd be sick.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.120
I know people are like, oh, you can play Elden Ring.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
And I'm like, maybe.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.120
You guys see me play.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.120
Crab souls.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.120
I don't know if you want to watch me play Elden Ring.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.120
And someone's like, oh, you can call up with Strony.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.120
I'm like, oh, shit, true.

32:59.120 --> 33:08.120
But then I would have to buy the game again because I played, I played and finished the game on my PlayStation, but I didn't finish it or have it in general on my.

33:10.120 --> 33:13.120
Oh, my nose on my PC.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.120
Hold on.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.120
My manager fixed my overlay, so I should be able to use it properly now.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.120
And then we'll get started.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.120
Let me do that.

33:39.120 --> 33:42.120
My own background music is stuck in my head a good chunk of the time.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.120
You're not going to see anything for a second.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.120
It's going to fix this real quick, like.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.120
Oh, shit.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
Oh, shit.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.120
Oh, I found my.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.120
Skyrim co-op kind of jank though.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.120
Yeah, but that's what makes it fun.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.120
Hey, look at you guys down there near my boobs.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.120
Um.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.120
Hey, what a guan.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.120
What a guan, what a guan.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.120
Hold on.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.120
You ride at dawn.

34:52.120 --> 34:55.120
Well, shit, there's, you guys are too tall.

35:00.120 --> 35:03.120
See now it's just on a circle that just is there.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.120
Is there.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.120
It was fun while it lasted.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.120
What do you mean?

35:08.120 --> 35:09.120
The app?

35:11.120 --> 35:13.120
I'm still going to yap a bunch during Stanley Parable.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.120
It's like a perfect yapping game.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.120
Music stuck in your head.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.120
Oh.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.120
I can't die.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.120
Okay, there we go.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.120
Yeah, there's a child screaming running down the hallway.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.120
I'll hear them in a moment.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.120
I think it's finally filtering them out.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.120
Oh, I can't.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.120
Oh, I know why.

36:00.120 --> 36:03.120
I was like, why can't I edit the properties of this

36:03.120 --> 36:05.120
and change the transformation?

36:05.120 --> 36:08.120
Because anytime I lock something, you can't do that.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.120
We're up all night to get lucky.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.120
If we are too tall, you could step on us.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.120
Yeah, put your lucky down for size.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.120
What just happened?

36:30.120 --> 36:32.120
You guys just flew away.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.120
What's up?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
Why is it working?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.120
Oh.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.120
I've got to lock a whole thing.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.120
All right, there you go.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.120
Are you happy now?

37:01.120 --> 37:02.120
Is that good?

37:08.120 --> 37:09.120
We did it.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.120
Yeah, I didn't see him out.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.120
We did it.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.120
She finally fixed her overlay and whatever.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.120
She did it.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.120
She did it.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.120
She did it.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.120
She did it.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.120
Okay, fuck my BGM for a second.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.120
Hey, what's up?

37:26.120 --> 37:28.120
Oh my God, what the fuck just happened?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:37.120 --> 37:40.120
Stanley Parable is fucking with my overlord.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.120
Is fucking with my pages.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
Oh my God.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.120
That is wild.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.120
Okay, let's try again.

37:54.120 --> 37:57.120
Oh my God, I need to take it off a full screen.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.120
My head in the way.

38:05.120 --> 38:08.120
Actually, I kind of might stick it over there like that

38:09.120 --> 38:10.120
and then move myself.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.120
Phoebe, you should have done this before a stream.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.120
I don't care.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.120
It's funnier when things are scoppy.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.120
Yeah, because it's cutting off the bottom of the screen.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.120
I might have to do a window.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.120
Yeah.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.120
Yeah.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.120
Yeah.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.120
Yeah.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.120
Give it to me now.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.120
Give it to me now.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.120
My dad is asking me why he hasn't heard from me.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
What's up, redacted?

38:33.120 --> 38:34.120
What are you doing?

38:34.120 --> 38:35.120
Where are you?

38:35.120 --> 38:36.120
Where are you?

38:37.120 --> 38:38.120
What's up, redacted?

38:38.120 --> 38:39.120
What are you doing?

38:39.120 --> 38:40.120
Where are you?

38:40.120 --> 38:42.120
Sometimes my parents will just text me

38:42.120 --> 38:44.120
and they'll be like, are you alive?

38:45.120 --> 38:46.120
I'm like, yes, I'm alive.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.120
They're like, okay, why haven't you called?

38:48.120 --> 38:50.120
I'm like, because I don't know.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.120
I was like, what is this?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.120
What is this?

39:06.120 --> 39:08.120
Yeah, I don't know why it's the demo.

39:08.120 --> 39:10.120
Yes, because it's only 30 minutes.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.120
I'm not paying for a full game that I know

39:13.120 --> 39:15.120
I'm not going to finish, guys.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.120
Sorry to break it to you.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.120
I'm playing the 30 minute free demo

39:23.120 --> 39:25.120
because I can stretch that shit to five hours

39:25.120 --> 39:26.120
if I really want.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
Demo.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.120
I'm alive.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.120
It's the same.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.120
Wait for it to notice.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.120
What do you mean?

39:41.120 --> 39:42.120
Oh, wait, I forgot.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.120
The chats delayed.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.120
I should put the newest stuff first, actually.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.120
No, the demo is actually just like

39:58.120 --> 40:00.120
literally just the first 30 minutes of it.

40:01.120 --> 40:06.120
Oh, my, the game is $24.

40:06.120 --> 40:12.120
I'm, I am a broke bunny.

40:13.120 --> 40:17.120
So I am selling my voice to a weird cuttlefish

40:17.120 --> 40:18.120
I met on the street.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.120
Yeah, but, you know, we just started up.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.120
Don't ignore me.

40:33.120 --> 40:36.120
Just like sweating and being mad.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.120
Aren't you happy I streamed twice today?

40:53.120 --> 40:55.120
You get double the scope.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.120
Listen, I've only been here for a week.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.120
You got to cut me some slack.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.120
Adam's already upset.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
No, I'm not upset.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.120
I'm just tired.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.120
I'm just tired.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.120
I just woke up.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.120
It's like my first week here.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.120
I'm just tired.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.120
I'm just tired.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.120
I'm just tired.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.120
I'm just tired.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.120
I'm just tired.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.120
I just woke up.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
I think I've done it.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
I think I've done it.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.120
I think I've done it.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.120
I think I've done it.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.120
I think I've done it.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.120
I think I've done it.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.120
I think that's good.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.120
Wait, what?

41:34.120 --> 41:36.120
Where did the, huh?

41:39.120 --> 41:41.120
Your names aren't coming up from a little ticker.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.120
But, oh.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.120
Why does stuff break?

41:46.120 --> 41:48.120
Why does it break?

41:48.120 --> 41:50.120
Why do it break?

41:50.120 --> 41:52.120
Why do it break?

41:52.120 --> 41:54.120
Why do it break?

41:54.120 --> 41:56.120
Oh, I know why.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.120
Oh, I know why.

41:58.120 --> 42:00.120
No, I don't know why.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.120
Why is it?

42:02.120 --> 42:04.120
Is it showing y'all?

42:04.120 --> 42:06.120
It's just not.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.120
Please.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.120
Please.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.120
Please, it's all right.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.120
Please, it's all right.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.120
It's all right.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.120
Please, it's all right.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.120
Please, it's all right.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.120
Please, it's all right.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.120
Please, it's all right.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.120
Please, it's all right.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.120
Please, it's all right.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.120
No, I didn't want that in there,

42:30.120 --> 42:32.120
or whatever.

42:32.120 --> 42:34.120
I'm just going to cry quietly

42:34.120 --> 42:36.120
as I do,

42:36.120 --> 42:38.120
as one does, you know.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.120
Oh, crap.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.120
No, wait.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.120
No, wait

45:15.400 --> 45:17.400
It doesn't even matter.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.400
I'm just gonna run in a window anyways.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.400
Okay!

45:24.400 --> 45:26.400
Hey-yo!

45:26.400 --> 45:28.400
Where'd my OBS go?

45:28.400 --> 45:30.400
Oh, there she is.

45:30.400 --> 45:50.400
Oh my god, this still is not the way I want, so I'm just gonna tuck it like that.

45:50.400 --> 45:56.400
How good is this gonna get, ladies and gentlemen?

45:56.400 --> 45:58.400
I also don't know what the master class is.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.400
Age is 16? 9?

46:04.400 --> 46:08.400
An alt becomes a main? No! My alt's not gonna be my main.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.400
I don't know.

46:10.400 --> 46:14.400
I was thinking about it, because I'm like, should I make my alt that my main?

46:14.400 --> 46:18.400
And then I'm like, no, because I get a lot.

46:18.400 --> 46:22.400
It's easier for me to talk to you guys on my actual main than my parent.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.400
I don't know.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.400
I don't know.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.400
I don't know.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.400
I don't know.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.400
I don't know.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.400
I don't know.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.400
I don't know.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.400
My actual main and my parent.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.400
In my opinion.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.400
Oh!

46:46.400 --> 46:48.400
What the f-

46:48.400 --> 46:50.400
I was like waiting for it to change.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.400
That's quite loud.

46:58.400 --> 47:02.400
It's quite loud. Hold on a moment.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.400
Is this the demo?

47:58.400 --> 48:00.400
What?

48:00.400 --> 48:02.400
Did I go in a circle?

48:03.400 --> 48:05.400
My number is 27.

48:05.400 --> 48:06.400
Oh.

48:07.400 --> 48:08.400
Hi.

48:13.400 --> 48:14.400
Okay.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.400
Waiting room.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.400
Why does that coffee look like blood?

48:23.400 --> 48:25.400
Can I pick stuff up?

48:26.400 --> 48:29.400
What does it say? Stanley Parable demo.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.400
Should I?

48:36.400 --> 48:38.400
Alright, looks like I got to wait.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.400
Sorry guys. I can't sit down, so I'll just...

48:44.400 --> 48:46.400
Okay, I'll sit down over here.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.400
Almost my turn.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.400
Wait, I can't see the chat. What happened to the chat?

48:55.400 --> 48:57.400
Yeah.

49:10.400 --> 49:12.400
Yes, my stuff is clicky.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.400
I made it.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.400
Gorgeous.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.400
Famous demos.

49:20.400 --> 49:22.400
We got...

49:22.400 --> 49:25.400
We got Snake there. We got...

49:26.400 --> 49:28.400
I thought it was Game & Watch for a second.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.400
What is that?

49:35.400 --> 49:37.400
I don't know what these games are.

49:42.400 --> 49:48.400
We were playing the demo. Yes, I'm not spending money on the real game when I'm not going to finish it.

49:52.400 --> 49:55.400
Oh, man.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.400
Wash over you.

50:39.400 --> 50:45.400
I wonder if I get a cool ending if I literally just walked away from my computer and didn't touch anything.

50:47.400 --> 50:50.400
Because I know that shit happens in this game.

50:52.400 --> 50:57.400
That explains clearly and concisely exactly what the Stanley Parable is.

50:57.400 --> 50:58.400
How it plays...

50:58.400 --> 51:00.400
I feel like I'm in office in Counter Strike.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.400
It's probably the same assets.

51:06.400 --> 51:09.400
Oh my god, it is the same assets. I'm nostalgic.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.400
I only just realized that now that they use the same assets.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.400
Let's go with the demo counter.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.400
Here is one such technology.

51:21.400 --> 51:27.400
These buttons are meant to convey the meaning of choice and the impact of the decisions you make.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.400
Can I press a button?

51:29.400 --> 51:32.400
Please. Please let me press the button.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.400
Please.

51:39.400 --> 51:43.400
What is this? Oh, I want to do this one.

51:48.400 --> 51:53.400
All people who select that particular button are sexual predators.

51:53.400 --> 51:59.400
You see, our choices really do illuminate the very intangible nature of our minds and souls.

51:59.400 --> 52:01.400
What the hell is this?

52:29.400 --> 52:32.400
I'm the 6% that's not a sexual predator.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.400
I'm just a sexual deviant.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.400
The buffalo.

52:40.400 --> 52:44.400
Well, technology, oh my god.

52:49.400 --> 52:50.400
No way.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.400
Oh, what the fuck?

52:55.400 --> 52:59.400
Oh, I wanted to walk through the wall like a badass.

53:05.400 --> 53:11.400
I'm actually like pretty out of work. How do I get up there?

53:11.400 --> 53:14.400
I can't get up there, can I? I can't parkour.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.400
Down here.

53:19.400 --> 53:23.400
Just a isolation chamber. They put me in one of those.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
Put me in a room, a rubber room.

53:27.400 --> 53:28.400
Rubber room filler ads.

53:35.400 --> 53:39.400
I'm like too low to the ground. I can't reach my keyboard properly.

53:41.400 --> 53:42.400
Raise my chair.

53:46.400 --> 53:47.400
Okay, there we go.

53:48.400 --> 53:51.400
Discovery or despair? Let's go with despair.

53:54.400 --> 53:59.400
These crags that we stood upon, they shielded us from our own ignorance.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.400
I'm not short.

54:03.400 --> 54:05.400
We're probably taller than the majority of you.

54:14.400 --> 54:16.400
Can I see the other ones?

54:18.400 --> 54:19.400
Is there like...

54:21.400 --> 54:22.400
Okay, fine.

54:24.400 --> 54:28.400
Ooh, you went in both boos? Oh, how vulnerable of you.

54:28.400 --> 54:34.400
If at any point during the demo you need to cry, just let me know and we can take a minute.

54:35.400 --> 54:38.400
Demo status, demo compliments.

54:41.400 --> 54:46.400
One of the most important parts of administering any demonstration is pumping out your ego.

54:46.400 --> 54:47.400
Yeah!

54:47.400 --> 54:49.400
...in securities about your sense of self-worth.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
I'm ready!

54:50.400 --> 54:55.400
That's why we use this room to develop cheap compliments to share on the production of the demo.

54:55.400 --> 55:01.400
Go ahead and press that button to see some of the superficial flattery we've been cooking up.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
I'm excited, okay.

55:03.400 --> 55:09.400
My heavens, I've never met someone who can consume as much uranium in a single sitting as you can.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.400
Just look at you go.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.400
Can I get another compliment?

55:14.400 --> 55:18.400
Of all the people I know who are playing this exact demo at this exact moment

55:18.400 --> 55:24.400
and standing in this exact room, your performance is easily in the top 5,000.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.400
Oh my god.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.400
Oh!

55:27.400 --> 55:29.400
I won't go as far as 4,600.

55:29.400 --> 55:30.400
Oh.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.400
Yeah.

55:39.400 --> 55:43.400
This device tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.

55:43.400 --> 55:44.400
I think I am.

55:44.400 --> 55:51.400
There's also a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.400
This game is so meta.

56:04.400 --> 56:05.400
Ooh!

56:05.400 --> 56:06.400
Wait, what?

56:06.400 --> 56:07.400
Wait.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.400
I get turned around a lot.

56:08.400 --> 56:12.400
Ah, now this room is perhaps the most important Joel encounter in the demo.

56:12.400 --> 56:16.400
This is where we determine whether or not the demo has been effective.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.400
No!

56:17.400 --> 56:18.400
What are you doing?

56:18.400 --> 56:19.400
You can't make that decision.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.400
Yeah, you haven't played the demo.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.400
We've put so much work into it.

56:22.400 --> 56:23.400
Is this not the demo?

56:24.400 --> 56:26.400
I was so ready to press no.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.400
Do you want me to turn up the game?

56:34.400 --> 56:35.400
Is it too quiet?

56:39.400 --> 56:41.400
And there you have it.

56:41.400 --> 56:45.400
Everything you need to know about how video game demos are made.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.400
Let them cook.

56:47.400 --> 56:48.400
It's a little quiet.

56:48.400 --> 56:49.400
Okay.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.400
I thought it was too loud.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.400
Meow.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.400
You don't want to simmer or want to broil?

56:56.400 --> 56:57.400
Mmm.

56:59.400 --> 57:02.400
Makes you want to broil you like a little crab and eat you up.

57:03.400 --> 57:06.400
You suck on your little leggies for your sweet, sweet flesh.

57:07.400 --> 57:10.400
However, it's still important that we address safety concerns.

57:10.400 --> 57:11.400
I'm going to jump us up.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.400
Emotion sickness.

57:17.400 --> 57:20.400
Another reason I didn't get this is I think I was going to get really motion sick.

57:23.400 --> 57:24.400
I see you right there.

57:25.400 --> 57:30.400
Please do not press the large red glowing disagree button at this time.

57:31.400 --> 57:32.400
Nothing.

57:32.400 --> 57:33.400
No objections.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.400
You're quite sure about that.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.400
There's no disagree button.

57:36.400 --> 57:37.400
Well, all right then.

57:37.400 --> 57:41.400
In the event that you do experience one or all of the previously listed symptoms.

57:41.400 --> 57:43.400
I'm going to bleed for my anus from playing this game.

57:43.400 --> 57:46.400
You need to convey to me that you wish the demonstration.

57:46.400 --> 57:47.400
Oh, a reflex.

57:47.400 --> 57:48.400
I probably case a calamari.

57:48.400 --> 57:49.400
Ooh, I love calamari.

57:49.400 --> 57:50.400
Don't tell Strani.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.400
What the?

57:52.400 --> 57:53.400
Dance perimeter.

57:53.400 --> 57:54.400
Please perform a dance.

57:56.400 --> 57:57.400
Oh, fuck.

58:00.400 --> 58:07.400
Your dance has been recorded in the event that you feel confused or disoriented by anything you see inside the demo.

58:07.400 --> 58:11.400
Perform that dance and I will terminate the demo immediately.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.400
Okay.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.400
Right.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.400
All preparations have been made.

58:14.400 --> 58:17.400
It is time at the fast.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.400
Are you prepared for a dance perimeter?

58:21.400 --> 58:22.400
Whoa.

58:30.400 --> 58:31.400
It's kind of terrifying.

58:35.400 --> 58:36.400
What?

58:38.400 --> 58:39.400
It kill me?

58:47.400 --> 58:48.400
What's that?

58:50.400 --> 58:51.400
Forget waiting.

59:03.400 --> 59:04.400
Dance perimeter.

59:12.400 --> 59:13.400
I'm so excited.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.400
Oh my God.

59:16.400 --> 59:17.400
Oh well.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.400
I'm making myself dizzy.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.400
Oh wait.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
What's this?

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
Huh?

59:26.400 --> 59:27.400
Can I leave?

59:29.400 --> 59:30.400
Okay.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.400
It's a giant eight.

59:31.400 --> 59:32.400
Eight.

59:38.400 --> 59:39.400
Damn girl.

59:39.400 --> 59:40.400
You really.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.400
Eight.

59:41.400 --> 59:42.400
The outfit up.

59:47.400 --> 59:48.400
Hey man.

59:48.400 --> 59:49.400
Do you eat?

59:49.400 --> 59:50.400
Do you?

59:50.400 --> 59:51.400
Fuck.

59:53.400 --> 59:54.400
I really.

59:55.400 --> 59:57.400
Her pussy the other day.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.400
I really.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.400
His ass.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.400
Running out of the game.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.400
It's like the equivalent of 42.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.400
Should I check who's guy?

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400
I like this game.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.400
Why six or three to seven because 79.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
Oh, okay.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400
I can go backwards.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400
All right.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.400
I would have been very happy.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400
I didn't pay for the full game.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400
No, I like.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.400
I like the Stanley parable.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400
Stanley parable is a great game.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.400
I've watched people play it.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.400
But again, I don't.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400
Because it's a long ish game.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
I just didn't think I would be able to get through it.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.400
Okay.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.400
Now let's take a minute to get something straight here.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400
Can I get a soda?

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.400
You are assuming an amount of responsibility for its outcome.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.400
Is there anything?

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400
We had us eight in Runderland.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.400
Eight.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400
I wish I could jump.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.400
This time, please take a minute to think about all of the mistakes you've made in playing this demonstration.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.400
As well as your lack of respect for demo taking in general.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.400
Opening the game.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.400
I shouldn't have gotten the game.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400
I'm kind of happy.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.400
I didn't make the mistake of buying the full game.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.400
But I kind of like walked and I got turned around a bunch.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.400
Okay.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.400
Why am I so small in the corner?

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400
Hold on.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400
I just realized I looked over.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400
I noticed how small I was.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400
Oh.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.400
I went back.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400
Well, hello there.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400
All right.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.400
What is this black void?

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.400
I didn't know your asshole was a feature of the game.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.400
Okay.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400
I can't see shit.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400
Oh.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400
Wow.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.400
Did she not detach yet?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.400
I'm sure of it.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.400
We have to get out of here.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.400
We have to find something for you to do anything.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.400
The demo cannot.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.400
It is a good song by Marilyn Martinez.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400
This way.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400
Okay.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.400
I love the narrator's voice though.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.400
Surely there must be a game somewhere in here.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400
Got a giant TV.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400
Vine boom noise.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400
Pick it up.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400
Whoa.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400
What the fuck?

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400
I can't.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.400
Now put it in the bin.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.400
What if I just wait?

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
I can't.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400
What the hell?

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.400
Did I just stand on it?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.400
I'm standing on it.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.400
What the fuck?

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.400
Can I just fucking break it?

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400
Break stuff.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.400
Disrespect your surroundings.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.400
Oh, I missed.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.400
Okay, I got it.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.400
Disrespect your surroundings.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
You did it.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400
You won.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400
You know what you get for winning?

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.400
An achievement.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400
Four ton narrator.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.400
I won?

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.400
Oh my god.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.400
Can't even see it in there.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400
I can't see that.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.400
I didn't even see what that said.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400
She threw it on the ground.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400
What?

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400
Let me out.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.400
Help me, I'm on fire.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.400
Can I throw myself in the trash?

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.400
Don't be on that now, aren't we?

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400
Come along, let's get to the end and the final choice.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400
I just hope they paid this man so well

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400
because he did such a good job narrating this game.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.400
Ending, ending, where are you?

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.400
Where are you?

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.400
Oh.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.400
This is where the red disagree button went.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.400
What?

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400
Is this a horror game?

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400
Yes, the end.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.400
Now this is where we want the demo to be.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.400
I think it's time for you to log your final decision

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.400
as to whether or not the Stanley Parable is any good.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.400
Oh, sweet.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.400
Please consider very carefully before answering.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.400
Much is at stake.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.400
Is it?

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400
Is it working?

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.400
Are you sure?

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.400
Are you sure you pressed the button?

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.400
Oh, jeez, fuck.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.400
We finished the demo.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400
Did it start again?

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400
Hello?

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.400
Is anyone there?

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.400
They already finished.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.400
They said they liked it.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.400
I need someone to stop the demo.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400
Hello?

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400
Hello?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400
We need to get out of here.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400
Let's blow this popsicle stand.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400
I can't run.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.400
I can crouch.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.400
What the frick?

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.400
Let me just go.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400
No?

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.400
All right.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.400
Time to go to the fun room.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.400
What's going on?

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400
Where is everyone?

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400
Okay.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400
Over to the left.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.400
Down this way.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.400
Ow, my ears.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.400
Quick in the isolation chamber.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.400
Oh, nice and quiet.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Finally.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.400
I suppose we can both agree that I failed.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400
My job was to be a teacher.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400
You remember the isolation chamber?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.400
Yeah, I was.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.400
I saw it.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.400
Exactly what the Stanley Parable is supposed to be.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400
But somehow I couldn't.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.400
Well, at any rate, I don't know if I care for the Stanley Parable anymore.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.400
Scammed.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.400
Do you think any of this is actually in the main game?

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400
Honestly, I don't think so.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.400
Ever ball out of time, chamber?

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.400
That even looked like.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.400
No.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.400
I think I've had enough of it.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400
No more doors.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400
No more demonstrations.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.400
No more endings.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.400
I wonder if this guy has voice acted like anything else,

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.400
or like, because I just feel like he should be an actor in a movie.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.400
It's so lovely.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.400
I kind of want to eat the leaves on this plant.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.400
They're edible, right?

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400
Excuse me.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400
Can I eat this chair?

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400
Can I pick anything up?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400
Yeah.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.400
Yeah, I do.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.400
What the fuck?

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400
How the hell did I get here?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.400
God?

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400
Jesus, please.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.400
Holy ghost.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400
Make it stop.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.400
Thank you, the cup.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.400
What?

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.400
We never did that until now.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.400
What?

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400
Huh?

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.400
What?

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.400
Ah!

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.400
What?

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.400
This is such a creative thing to do for a demo, though.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.400
Ah!

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.400
What the fuck?

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.400
He's just teleporting me.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.400
Let's eat everything.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.400
I just like to chew on stuff, to be honest with you.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.400
Where is it?

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400
Where is it?

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.400
I'm in an elevator, please.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400
I'm getting so much motion sickness from the...

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.400
Yeah, that's another reason why I didn't think I could play it.

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.400
I'm also whipping around.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.400
It's easier, like, it's easier on me right now

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.400
because I'm controlling it and I know what I'm going to do.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400
But for you guys, I'm just like,

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.400
Sorry.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.400
Release me.

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.400
The madam cannot be caged.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.400
Oh, this looks like their original game.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.400
Taking sippies.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.400
Hell yeah, guys, it's out now.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.400
Okay, maybe I should have gotten the game.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.400
Because I thought the demo was like the first 30 minutes of the game.

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400
But I was wrong.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400
I was incorrect.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400
Out now? No way.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.400
It's always the next time.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400
It really depends.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400
Like, I don't know if you guys want me to play it.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.400
Oh, for real, damn.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.400
They should bring Stanley Paramore to our attention.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400
Don't buy it.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400
Commit to the bit.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.400
Yeah, you know, I'm not going to, you know,

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.400
purchase a game from a company

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.400
that's, you know, romanticizing,

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.400
working,

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.400
working for the man, you know?

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.400
You never do the demo.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.400
How do you need content as a new one?

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.400
Did you, if I did buy the game for the bit?

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.400
Yeah, for the bit.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400
Hmm.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.400
Hmm.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.400
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.400
Should I get it?

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400
Do you know for the bit?

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.400
We've been troll requests for a second.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400
Yeah.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.400
What's the difference between the ultra deluxe

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400
and the,

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400
and the normal one?

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.400
You could go back to Class of 09.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.400
Maybe.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.400
We could, we could.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400
Yeah, I get it.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.400
Has a bucket ending.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400
Play games usually.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400
Yeah, I know.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400
I just,

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.400
I'm sorry.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.400
I feel like this is not one of my better streams

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400
since I'm like half asleep.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.400
I shouldn't have fallen asleep

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.400
to, um,

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.400
to, to icy stuff.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400
Hmm.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.400
Oh, don't give me a second.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.400
I'll do better for you.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400
Oh, what the fuck?

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400
Where did I go?

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400
What's happening?

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400
Guys?

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.400
Are you there?

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400
Are you there?

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.400
Hello?

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400
Guys?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.400
With that, she's gone.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.400
I'm just a disembodied voice

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.400
with some background music now.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400
I just got Thanos snapped.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.400
Oh, man.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400
Guys.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400
I can't.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400
I can't.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.400
Wait, I woke up.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.400
She's gone.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.400
We're free.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.400
Guys, I don't know what happened.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400
I guess.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400
I guess I was just a figment

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.400
of your imagination the entire time.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.400
I'm so sorry.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.400
My whole body flew away.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.400
I'm in the walls.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.400
I'm just talking to you

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.400
within the walls.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.400
I'm in your walls.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.400
I'm in your walls.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.400
I'm in your walls.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400
Next evolution of VTubing.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.400
No one there.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.400
What happened?

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.400
That's crazy.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.400
Hold on.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.400
I had the ropes and whips.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.400
This is truly the meaning

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.400
of the Stanley Parable.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400
Bad ending.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.400
We took the meds.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.400
So I played Needy Schumer Overdose.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.400
Overloaded Overdose.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.400
I forget.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.400
You have to play Uno.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.400
I'm wide awake.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.400
Yeah, I was in the dark.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400
Hello?

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400
Oh, no.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.400
I broke myself.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.400
Could you believe me

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.400
if I told you this was all intentional?

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.400
Because it actually is.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.400
It's all...

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400
It's all a figment

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.400
of your imagination.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400
Whoa.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.400
Wait, but why am I not moving?

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400
Please.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400
What the hell just happened?

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.400
Why am I moving in slow mo...

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.400
Guys, I'm not even...

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400
That was so creepy.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400
What is happening?

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.400
Guys, I had closed...

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.400
I closed the app

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.400
and it was still moving and talking.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.400
What's going on?

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400
Why do I look so creepy?

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.400
My models are slowly moving back and forth.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400
Okay, okay.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.400
What's going on?

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.400
I don't know.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.400
What happened there?

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.400
Oh, we're broke broke.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400
We always been broke broke.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400
I'm stalling.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400
I'm just stalling.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400
Don't worry about it.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400
I'm stalling

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400
for time.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400
We're reaching levels of scoff.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400
That shouldn't be possible.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400
You know what my temptation is right now?

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400
Is

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.400
is

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.400
is just going to play in RuneScape

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.400
and stream sniping her.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.400
That sounds fun.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.400
Text...

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.400
I've never played RuneScape before.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.400
Excuse me.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.400
I remember growing up

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.400
in that aforementioned

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.400
after school program.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.400
We had like a computer room and stuff.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.400
And um,

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.400
I don't know why my model is like freaking out,

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.400
but I'll just let her do her thing.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.400
And this kid was playing RuneScape

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.400
on one of the computers.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.400
And I'm like, oh, that looks really fun and cool.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400
Can I play?

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400
And he's like, nah,

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400
this is only for boys.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400
And I'm like,

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.400
oh, and I like genuinely believed him

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.400
that only boys could play for some reason.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400
So I never played RuneScape.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.400
Secret cheapy horse stream.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400
But I just stare awkwardly at you.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.400
And my body jerks around.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.400
Mastered the power of scuff and nightmares.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.400
If only I had like multiple models

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400
to run right now.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.400
Maybe I can like cut off my head.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.400
That would take too long though.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400
As I cut off my head.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400
Damn it.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400
Damn it.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.400
So um,

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400
how was your day?

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400
My stall,

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400
I'm losing,

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400
I'm losing my stalling ability.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400
Finishing levels.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400
Yeah,

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400
I just beat the entire game.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.400
That's crazy.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400
Pass bad at your per...

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400
Yeah, I know.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.400
I'm like...

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.400
For the funny.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.400
RuneScape is 90% male player base

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.400
even today.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.400
Most MMOs at 50-50.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400
Oh, interesting.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.400
Although,

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.400
I would probably just like make,

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.400
see if I can um,

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.400
see if I can like trick

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.400
strongy

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.400
into falling in love with me online.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.400
You think I can groom my gen mate

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.400
in RuneScape

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.400
without her knowing?

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.400
Streep's not the color fish.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400
Got to like kick out.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.400
Be like,

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.400
hey, I'm Kyle.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.400
I'm Kyler.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400
I'm a huge fan.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400
I'm also from

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.400
insert where strongy is from

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.400
here.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400
Headless sheebie return?

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.400
Show sports and such huh?

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400
Talk,

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.400
taking sheebie to the

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.400
willdy?

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.400
Alright,

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.400
I forgot we had the prehensile

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.400
hair.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.400
That was a real horror stream.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400
Yeah, I'm trying to think of

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.400
something funny to do

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.400
for 6K on Twitter

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.400
with the

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.400
3D thing.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.400
I'm like trying to get

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.400
manager to make something for me,

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.400
but I have to think of a song

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400
in a dance.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.400
Uh huh.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.400
I've had Karba stuck in my head

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400
for a long time.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.400
Don't worry about my models.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.400
She,

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400
we're fine.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400
She's good.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400
I'm good.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.400
It's good.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.400
Don't worry about it.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.400
Oh no.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.400
My stream just

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.400
disappeared.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.400
Oh no.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.400
Oh god.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400
Hahaha.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.400
Karba's a bitch.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.400
I should have known better

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.400
if I was a bitch.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.400
Oh wow.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.400
Whoa.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.400
Holy crap.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.400
Hold on.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.400
Something's happening.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.400
I don't know what,

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.400
but something's going on.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400
Going on.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400
Like Donkey Kong.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.400
Oh my god.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.400
Where did I?

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.400
What is happening?

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.400
Whoa.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.400
Wowee, Zowie.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.400
My stream for a little bit longer today.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.400
Just to make up for all the scuff

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.400
and me just talking about nothing.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.400
I just look,

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.400
why do I look high as fuck?

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.400
Whoa, what is this?

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.400
That's crazy.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.400
Where did this come from?

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.400
Whoa.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.400
This is not what I was stalling for

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.400
or anything.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400
I'm having absolute fuck all.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400
Oh wow.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.400
What a cool game.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400
Nice zoo.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.400
Yeah.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.400
I'm starting over

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.400
because I beat the game.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.400
So you know,

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.400
I'm just going to start over.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.400
Let me just,

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.400
that's fun.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.400
Is she beyond the saw?

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400
No.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.400
Well, I'm tired,

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400
so I bet some people will be like,

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.400
I'm pretty sure she was high as fuck.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.400
No, I'm just tired.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400
Especially because it was up at 6 a.m.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.400
Come as a bitch,

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.400
I should know better.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.400
I wonder why she lagged.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400
I know, right?

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400
I don't.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.400
Really crazy how that's,

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.400
you know,

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400
V-Soup Studio just has its moments.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400
Crazy.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.400
Wow, that's crazy.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.400
You'll never know,

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.400
Somnis Vivarum.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.400
You'll never know.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.400
Your name sounds like a spell from Elden Ring.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.400
How weird, huh?

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400
Of a girl named Sheebie.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.400
Sheebie worked for a big company.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.400
This is clearly source.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.400
The source is funny anyway.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.400
The source is funny anyway.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.400
I'm playing the normal one.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.400
Stanley was happy.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.400
And then one day something peculiar happened.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.400
This is the arrow.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400
This is me right now.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.400
Something that would forever change Stanley.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400
Something he would never quite forget.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.400
He had been at his desk for nearly an hour

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.400
when he realized that not one

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.400
single order

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:09.400
had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.400
No one had sure not to do this.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.400
Yeah, yeah, you have no regrets.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.400
You know mods destroy him.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.400

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:32.140
My stream died for me.

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:34.140
And I lost like half of everybody.

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.140
Oh my god.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:42.140
He really got teleported to Kiara's stream.

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:44.140
Oh no.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:46.140
Everybody literally is gone.

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.140
Do I give up?

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.140
Do I just...

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.140
Do I just end it here?

01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:00.140
I got the funniest ending just by sitting in the thing as I died.

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.140
I didn't even fucking notice.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.140
What the fuck?

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.140
Why can't I leave?

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:16.140
No mourners, no funerals.

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:20.140
Come on.

01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:22.140
Please.

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.140
Forever.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.140
I will be happy.

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.140
Stanley waited.

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.140
Hours passed.

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.140
Then days.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:33.140
Had years gone by.

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:35.140
He no longer had the ability to tell.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.140
But the one thing we knew for sure...

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.140
Give me the fuck out of here.

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:41.140
Was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:42.140
Oh my god.

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:44.140
I'm literally gonna go crazy.

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.140
Soon.

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:47.140
Very soon now.

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:48.140
This will end.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.140
He will be spoken to.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.140
He will be told what to do.

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:54.140
Please, please, please, please, please.

01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:55.140
I'm just getting claustrophobic.

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.140
The walls are closing in.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.140
Stream is having serious issues.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.140
What the fuck?

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.140
Okay, okay, okay.

01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.140
Okay.

01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:19.140
I think because the stream is just being so fucky for some reason, I might...

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:23.140
I'm also having really bad lagging issues looking back at my own stream.

01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.140
Oh my god.

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.140
What the fuck?

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:47.140
Jesus.

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:50.140
I just know it's gonna die on me again because when this happens a bunch...

01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.140
When this happens a bunch, I know my stream is gonna hold on,

01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:57.140
but I'm like super tempted to do something before that.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.140
I like really want to go on RuneScape and bother Shawnee.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.140
Let me turn off Stanley Parable.

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.140
I'm sorry guys.

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.140
How do I... Do I have to make an account?

01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.140
Okay.

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:23.140
Old school RuneScape.

01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.140
I'm just gonna casually stream.

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.140
Don't tell her.

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.140
Don't fucking tell her.

01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:34.140
Don't tell her.

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.140
You little bitches.

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.140
I know you fucking want to.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.140
You little bitches.

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.140
It's free to make the account.

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:45.140
All right.

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.140
I've never played RuneScape in my life.

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.140
My internet lasts long enough.

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.140
Hold on.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.140
We'll find out.

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:03.140
I just think my computer just can't handle the Stanley Parable for some reason.

01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.140
That's kidding.

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:06.140
No, it's just my...

01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.140
Oh, what the fuck?

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:09.140
I'm so done with the asking for cookies.

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.140
What's my birthday?

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.140
September 28th.

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.140
September 28th.

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.140
Oh, I have to check a verification code.

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.140
Fuck me.

01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.140
Please choose an account name.

01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:53.140
Hold on.

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.140
I need a cool name.

01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.140
Guys, help me pick a name.

01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.140
Can you guys help me think of a name?

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.140
Stanley Parable is running through Portal 2.

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.140
Oh, is it?

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:07.140
Why do I look so demonic?

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.140
Why are my eyes just like...

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:15.140
The child in yellow, whatever that game is called.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.140
Help me think of a cool name.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:22.140
I need a cool badass name for RuneScape.

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.140
Oh, wait.

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.140
Does it matter if I have a username?

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.140
And then I just make a character name.

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:33.140
Is the username different from the character name?

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:36.140
Not Sheebie.

01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:38.140
The Sheedmeister.

01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:41.140
Mr. Siappet.

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.140
Darkened McOrphan Pain.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.140
Sheebie Detroit.

01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.140
No, Ben.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.140
Get destroyed.

01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.140
Remove yourself from the premises.

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.140
Terrible.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.140
Shubby.

01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:10.140
The Sheebie Parable.

01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:14.140
Baroness, cotton bum.

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.140
Hold on.

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.140
Let's do this for my account name.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.140
Why is that not allowed?

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.140
Serious?

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.140
Why is this name not allowed?

01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:52.140
Oh my god.

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:10.140
Wait, I forgot how to spell Mistress.

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.140
What?

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:19.140
That's what works.

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:20.140
Are you serious?

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:24.140
It wouldn't let me do Sheebie Cotton Bum

01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.140
or Sheebie Cotton.

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:33.140
It wouldn't let me do Cotton or Sheebie.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.140
I don't...

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:46.140
Wait, I have to download the game?

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.140
I just want to play Old School RuneScape.

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.140
I thought that was a game you just play in the window.

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.140
I'm literally gonna cry.

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.140
Can you...

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:19.140
I'm gonna strangle their webpage

01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:21.140
because this is not loading.

01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:24.140
Okay, Cotton.

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.140
Yeah, but like...

01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.140
Oh.

01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.140
There's almost 200 people on this.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:42.140
On this game.

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:45.140
Come on, I just want to play RuneScape.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:47.140
I'm gonna strangle too.

01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:54.140
Holy crap.

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.140
You created a new character for me.

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:02.140
Lovely.

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.140
Create.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.140
Manage.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:15.140
Why is this so confusing?

01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.140
What is...

01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.140
Am I dumb?

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.140
Wait, I have to get to...

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:22.140
Okay, I'm done. Never mind then.

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:24.140
If I have to do the tutorials and everything

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.140
and I just can't go and just like try to kill Strawny as a joke

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.140
or like try to flirt with her or something

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.140
and be a cringe

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.140
then I'm not dumb enough.

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.140
I'll do that later then.

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.140
Tutorial, I could speedrun through it?

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.140
No.

01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:45.140
It was all fine.

01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.140
We're just gonna raid...

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:51.140
Just gonna raid mom.

01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:54.140
We're just gonna raid mom.

01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.140
I don't know why I'm so tired.

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.140
Maybe because I didn't go to sleep till 1am again.

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:03.140
Then I woke up at 6am.

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.140
I'm not the best bunny.

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:10.140
I'm a bad bunny.

01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:12.140
Are you seeing bad bunny?

01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.140
Wait.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.140
Hold on, let me see who's streaming.

01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:26.140
I see the...

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.140
Hold on.

01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:29.140
Hold on.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140
Hold on.

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.140
God!

01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.140
Too many windows open!

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.140
Strawny it is.

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.140
Alright.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:03.140
Later nerds.

01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:04.140
I'm gonna go in a...

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:06.140
Emen Hera somewhere.

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.140
Somewhere else.

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.140
So I apologize for the scuff.

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.140
But um...

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.140
I think you know.

01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:18.140
It's just you know...

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.140
It's a part of me.

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:21.140
I was born with it.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.140
I was molded by the scuff.

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:25.140
And my internet keeps changing.

01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.140
I love you.

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.140
Bye!

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.140
No I don't.

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:29.140
I don't fucking love you.

01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:31.140
Don't get the fucking head.

01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:32.140
Fuck you.
