Um, but hello, how's it going?

27
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,920
I've had a stressful day, but it is what it is. I have fia next to me actually she's sitting on my desk

28
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Well, she's not sitting she's kind of just you know chilling

29
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
um

30
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She is

31
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Doing okay

32
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,880
She was uh the doctor said she was worse than the last time this happened

33
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Lady, what are you doing?

34
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Where are you looking? Do you want water? Are you done with that?

35
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Are you done? Are you done with this?

36
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
No, you're not. Yeah, why did you look away? Did you forget you had food there?

37
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm feeding her on my desk right now. She's sitting in her bed and I have um

38
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,520
Her food propped up in front of her

39
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,400
Elevated and she's just munching on it because she hasn't eaten at all today. So I know she's hungy

40
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Mortice

41
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,560
Yeah, pull for your baby indeed. Hi miwa. Hello. Yeah, she's she's gonna be okay

42
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,920
Um, if you're new here, uh, my cat has a very rare and unique, uh, audiomean disease and neuropathy

43
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Neurological neuropathy

44
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,520
Uh disease that uh makes it so she's paralyzed from the neck down

45
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,360
Uh, this happens and it flares up sometimes. Uh, she seems to have had a flare up

46
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,960
Um, and it happened really fast. I don't know what caused it

47
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,440
Uh, but she's okay. We're on her. She's gonna be on steroids. I'm actually gonna give her her meds in just a second

48
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Um, but she's a tough kitty

49
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
She's my she's my baby girl

50
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
She's my sweet woman

51
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,900
And uh, she is wonderful and she is a tough kid you might hear here you want some cat ASMR

52
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,920
I don't know if you can hear her. She might be too far away

53
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Boomi can you mind your business? Boomi's like, oh, let me take your food. No, go away, bro

54
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
I'm cute

55
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
There we go

56
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
All right, I'm back

57
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,040
I don't know why it's funny because I just added it and re-added it and then I went back to brow

58
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
I don't know why that happened

59
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
It is I

60
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
You're a priestess. You're none

61
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,440
I was trying to find like a normal priest outfit, but I could only get this none outfit

62
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,960
So this is what you get

63
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Here you go miss ma'am. You're not done yet. Finish your food. Finish. Finish your food

64
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Um

65
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,240
This is somewhat reminiscent of a previous life

66
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
So odd so interesting

67
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Very interesting

68
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,000
Um, I do be jiggling

69
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,120
They will smack me in the face. Uh, I can also just be like gone

70
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,040
Completely utterly removed can I have them back? Okay, there they are

71
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Um

72
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
So we're gonna play faith, uh

73
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,800
I kind of already know about this. I won't lie to you. I have seen gameplay of this before

74
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
It's a great game. It terrifies me

75
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,120
Uh, I have never played it myself though. It's different from watching a little bit of gameplay versus, um

76
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,720
Oh, are you okay? You need to be burped. You good Fia? Good girl. Good burp. Good burp

77
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Sorry, I'm burping my cat

78
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Good burp

79
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,360
Yeah, lady. Oh, yeah. Okay. Hey, boomie. You can come finish us off. She's done with it. Oh, you're burping right here

80
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
That's all yours, bro

81
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:59,760
And what the shivity, uh, okay. Here's some water Fia. Here you go. I bet you're parched. Have a little bit of sippy sip

82
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,640
You got your girl

83
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,760
Perfect. There's sippy sip. Uh, this is a scary game

84
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,600
Um, it's a pixel horror game, which is pretty cool. It's very analog

85
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
Um, cat's burp. Yeah cat's burp

86
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,320
Um, cat burp. Yeah, it's a horror game with strong religious themes and you guys know

87
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I like to play into my religious trauma

88
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,800
So I'm gonna dress up as a nun and we're just gonna, you know, play the faithy one holy trinity. Um, I have a shock collar

89
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Uh, actually, I need to put it on right now

90
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Hold on a moment

91
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,480
Um, the heart rate monitor is kind of being annoying. So I don't know if it's gonna work

92
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,280
So I might do like if you donate, um

93
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
I'll shock myself. I mean, I'll have a buzzing good time

94
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,560
Uh

95
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,160
Do nuns burp nuns don't burp. I'm a woman of the cloth. Why would you even presume to think

96
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,200
That I would

97
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Do that. Oh wait. No, I didn't want

98
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,280
I need to tis tight

99
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,040
This is so annoying to put on with no one here. Well, me. Can you not sniff her ass when she's trying to drink water? That's really

100
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
inappropriate

101
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
Mister

102
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I literally just gave you

103
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,000
He slipped my hand. I just gave you food

104
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,520
I literally just gave you feel you didn't even eat it

105
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,760
Stop trying to sniff her butt. I know she smells weird because she came back from the vet

106
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,000
But I think she would like her personal space, sir

107
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,640
That's how boomy be sometimes. Um

108
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,400
The shock is very like surprising. It like really does take you by surprise. I have the same one that emmy has I believe

109
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Um, I think it's different from the one that, um

110
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Strelny has

111
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
But I have that set up

112
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
um

113
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,080
Actually, you know what I should have done. I should have set this up to my ipad not my phone because I need my phone for tracking

114
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,360
It's fine. I just might go ventriloquist sometimes

115
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
um

116
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,520
The heart rate monitor is being really annoying. I have two heart rate monitors right now

117
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,320
I have the one that I purchased and I have the one

118
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,040
For my phone. I mean for my apple watch and it's not working

119
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,240
And it's kind of annoying I even updated it and all this stuff

120
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
Let me turn it off and turn it back on again because you know

121
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,800
That's what they always say to do. Um

122
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,440
So what I'm doing, where did the thing go?

123
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,240
I was using this thing called strawmow where you can connect in your, um

124
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,400
Heart rate to your apple watch and it should go but mine's just not connecting for some reason

125
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,040
And then the one for my chest like I have like an actual one of you. It's like

126
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
under my

127
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
holy

128
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
Embrace right now. Um, it's really tucked up in there

129
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,160
and

130
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,000
It's also just not being picked up by my phone and it's annoying. Sorry. I'm going to be ventriloquist for a second

131
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,560
Wait, is my

132
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,960
Where's my my mouth normal? I can't tell

133
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm just smiling creepily at you

134
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,840
Yeah, I've been trying to connect it and it just doesn't want to do it. Wait, where's the manual where the manual go?

135
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Here it is

136
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,120
Just got home after work. It's time for today's church service rested mortis mortis

137
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,920
Uh, dear sister. Yeah, I can't wait to play this. Nope. This is for my headphones. This is not for that

138
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Fia, are you done with the water?

139
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Are you done lady?

140
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Are you done, ma'am?

141
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,520
I was gonna put the cat cam on but I also don't want you guys to feel bad

142
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,280
And be like wow, she's showing her like sickly cat. Wow. Um

143
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
And also, uh

144
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,920
Fia, are you oh, you need to be burped ma'am. I'm burping my cat again. Sorry

145
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,840
There you go

146
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,000
Good burp. Good burp. 10 out of 10 burp Fia. Did you still want more water?

147
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
No, okay, you're done. Cool. Um

148
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,120
Because it's also just kind of sad to look at her

149
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,360
I'm a lie to you

150
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,840
Like she's fine. It's just like depressing to see a cat that can't move. So I'm not gonna put you through that

151
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Um

152
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,760
She's just chilling she's she she's big chilling. Um, I'm gonna move her and she might squeak

153
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I want you to be comfy

154
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,680
Yeah, I know there. See now you're comfy and you can rest your head. Oh, perfect. Oh, perfect

155
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,880
You wouldn't mind seeing Fia's cute face. Yeah, I might show her for a second. Let me see

156
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I need to hide myself though

157
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm not wearing pants and let me put on better clothing

158
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Uno momento

159
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Let me take this off

160
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Oh my god

161
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Need better pants

162
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,240
I almost clicked stop streaming. Um, let me see

163
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Is this even plugged in?

164
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
No, it's not

165
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,720
Where can I even plug this into? Let's look it in here

166
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,280
Ow

167
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,240
Will this work? I don't know. Sometimes I don't like plugging things in the front

168
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
I

169
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800

Did I like

283
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,520
Because you need a coin to open it up. I put the battery in the battery is the right side

284
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,680
And it's just not recognizing the um

285
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,520
What should it called here? Let me take this off

286
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,440
It's not recognizing and hold on. I'm gonna take off the camera because I don't want to

287
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,080
Do something on accident. Um, is my door closed? Okay

288
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,120
We a little nice guy if you help groom her. Yeah, no, he'll just bite her he starts grooming her and then he bites her

289
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Because he sucks

290
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Okay, I'll just take this off

291
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,960
Um, where is the court boomie? Did you take my money?

292
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,880
Boomi took my money. I had a quarter on my desk and it's gone

293
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,480
Boomi took my quarter boomie. Where did you put my money? boomie

294
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,280
Boomi told my boomie you owe me. Oh my god

295
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,040
I had I literally had a coin here before I left

296
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:20,560
Boomi's a thief boomi's a menace. We all know this already. Boomi has committed war crimes. What are you doing dude?

297
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,640
He's sitting in the cat carrier that I brought home via in

298
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,600
And he's just staring at me. All right, let me get on the recorder

299
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Gotta go to the change job, you know

300
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,560
So I can go to coin stop and get myself some mauve ropes

301
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,880
I was kidding. I don't smell. Let you guys get the joke. Okay

302
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Do-do-do-do-do-do

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,400
Wait, she be a florida woman? No

If I was a florida woman things would be very bad. So I have so this is the thing. Hi fia fia's gonna be my vana white

305
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
um

306
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,400
And let me see maybe I like put the coin in wrong and that's why it's not popping up because it's supposed to be showing up

307
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
as like a certain name

308
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
when you go to um

309
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
It's not opening now

310
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh when you go to

311
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,600
Oh my god, boomi. Hi. I don't need you here right now

312
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
I needs to be pressed in

313
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,920
Stay I feel like it's not going in all the way

314
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
But I get like a bum thing

315
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
Boomi has to sniff everything

316
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,440
I'm gonna burp in your face, dude. How about that? Oh

317
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,960
Boomi I blame you. I accidentally just dropped the coin battery

318
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,120
Boomi you menace. He's standing right next to me. You guys can't see

319
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,280
Thank you. How are you doing? Sweet Marcy

320
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,040
Everybody say hi to mercy if you haven't already. I'm sorry

321
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,040
I'm not looking too much at chat because I'm just stressing myself out by trying to fix

322
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,760
I was dealing with this before I like when stuff

323
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Works before stream and then when I start stream it doesn't work. Don't you love that if you're a streamer

324
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Or if you watch like a streamer

325
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
I

326
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,320
Scuff life truly, okay

327
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,720
Let me see if I can clip this back in without taking it off completely because I have the strap on me already

328
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,600
That sounds funny. You know, I stay strapped

329
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Boomi can I help you?

330
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,480
He's like, let me help you mom. No, do not need your assistance nor do I desire it

331
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,840
You insolent and petulant child

332
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,800
That you have a strap on it

333
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,320
Oh mercy, oh mercy mercy mercy

334
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,600
Boomi has the funds. Okay, hold on you to lift up my shirt again

335
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,720
If this doesn't work, we will have an interesting time

336
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,640

700
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,800
Um, I don't know how long that will take. I don't think it takes that long, uh

701
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,040

I feel like you'll forget and I'm pretty sure they've been forgetting so it's not just me

721
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:37,760
It's not my fault. Uh, it's the universe's fault. They just don't want me to announce that I'm streaming on time

722
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
So

723
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,560

It has taken longer than expected registering the markers on your property as a historical cemetery

836
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:18,020
Our officers had difficulty identifying who was buried there the inscriptions on the gravestones are written in a language

837
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:23,700
That we cannot identify. I've sent the gravestone rubbings to that some of my peers the university of Connecticut

838
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:25,940
Connecticut

Excuse me. Can I, can I escape?

842
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:43,060
How do I get out of here? It's not letting me out

843
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,100
Oh

844
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,100
I didn't scroll all the way down apparently

845
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,300
Wait, I'm a little big. Let me just

846
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:57,220
Oh, no, I moved my mole. Don't worry about that. It's not fake. I swear

847
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,340
Making my way downtown

848
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,860
Walking fast

849
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,940
Faces past and I'm a nun now

850
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,820
What is then

851
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,740
No

852
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,740
Nothing for that

853
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:24,980
Oh sir, sir, I need to talk to you about our lord and savior jesus christ sir, please

854
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:27,620
Split please, please. Hello

855
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,660
Please take these pamphlets

856
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:36,980
Hold on. I want to go talk to that deer. Hey, excuse me. Oh dear

857
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,420
Hello

858
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,820
Oh

859
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:57,140
The Motton's house, oh, I'll just read this in my normal voice

860
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:03,860
The Martin's house lies about 100 yards off of snake meadow hill road. There's almost no driveway trees jut out and I need to sneeze

861
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,020
Okay

862
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,700
Trees jut out in the middle of a gravel path that is mostly covered in grass

863
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:17,460
It was difficult to find the house, especially since it was already dark when we arrived

864
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,260
father

865
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:25,380
Alred seemed to know where he was going. He simply drove straight ahead until we arrived at the house

866
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,820
I'm heading

867
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:32,180
Sorry in the headlights. This is the hardest font to read. I saw an old shed off the right of the path

868
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:35,860
Father already explained that he would rather perform the exorcism away from the house

869
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,740
But the martins had insisted that Amy remain inside

870
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:46,180
He complained that having the family present makes it difficult to proceed with the elements of the right that may seem harsh to the lay person

871
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:51,220
Cool, uh, I don't trust that shed

872
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,860
Thank you. Sorry. I'm walking into a tree because you just distracted me

873
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,540
Oh

874
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:01,860
Oh, I've got a bone to pick with you

875
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,940
this looks like the

876
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,700
remnants of that uh

877
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,700
Spidery thingy that was like

878
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,100
Hello, dear

879
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,100
Hello, how are you?

880
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,340
Oh, I'm gonna follow you then

881
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,780
Oh the children

882
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:24,740
The children and the deer can I run? No, can I run? I can't run. Can I can I can I

883
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:30,340
Can I crit book? No, can you freaking kids stop running around?

884
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,780
Are you just leading me back to the shed?

885
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,020
I should trust the shed. All right. I'll trust the shed. It seems like the kids are leading me to the shed

886
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,460
Hello

887
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,460
I don't like that the music stopped

888
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,020
Holala, oh

889
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:07,220
Mortis

890
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,580
Mortis, I love that

891
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,740
All right, well, I have to get that key

892
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,500
No, I don't need to read that. Can I, can I like...

893
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,700
Can I like walk a little bit fat? Like I love my gait. I'm just like...

894
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:37,780
That wasn't that I have a foal. What's up with that then?

895
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,780
Hmm? Hmm?

896
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:44,740
My heart really sounds spinning when you die.

897
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,580
Oh, that was rude of you to say. I was gonna come check on you.

898
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:05,060
Get cleansed by the power of Christ! Get cleansed. Get cleansed, bro. Get cleansed so hard. Oh, hello.

899
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,660
Oh, I gotta go. Sorry.

900
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:15,860
Oh, does it like randomize? Or did I just keep going straight the first time?

901
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:22,820
Oh, come on, dude. I was busy that day. Come on, bro.

902
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:28,820
This might take a while. It's a fox. Oh!

903
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:34,660
Oh, chaos reigns. I reign?

904
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:44,340
Stop! You shut your little goofy-looking rake mouth.

905
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:50,500
I like how you guys just all say mortis. Oh, hello again.

906
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,420
This rocks around you this time. Hello.

907
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,860
Chaos reigns. I love the voice acting.

908
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,020
Chaos reigns. Well, obviously it's not voice acting, but

909
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:09,540
I'm waiting for that. I was about to say that really random, like the worst way.

910
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:14,420
I'm like, I'm waiting for that white dude to pop out and start chasing me.

911
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:17,940
Oh.

912
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:23,780
Come on. Why is he so... Can I run?

913
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:31,940
Well, how do I run? Oh, wait. Do I need to press the space bar?

914
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:38,900
Oh, do I need to... Do I need to like compel him? Do I need to the pyre of Christ?

915
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:45,620
I know it's not voice acting. It's just... Okay. That makes a lot more sense, guys.

916
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,740
That makes a lot more sense.

917
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:53,220
I'm ready for you, white man. Come at me, white man.

918
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:57,700
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:03,140
Yeah, power of Christ compels this fat ass. That's all I'm saying.

920
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:10,100
Thank you. Yeah, this is what they taught me in non-school, guys.

921
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:16,100
They defeat him by having faith. Faith in my...

922
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,100
Bang and bod.

923
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:22,820
Crick off. Oh, you're going after the deer. That's too bad.

924
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:28,340
Sorry, deer. Okay, I already came over here. Do I need to redo stuff again? I highly doubt it.

925
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:33,060
But I'm in the shed. Will it make him go away?

926
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:35,620
No, you suffer.

927
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:41,620
You little gangly rake dude.

928
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,820
Gangly rake dude.

929
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,620
The voice is made using the software automatic mouth.

930
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,620
I took you three tries to figure that out. Listen.

931
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:09,540
Listen, okay. As they say in Smash Mouth, all stars. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.

932
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,740
I'm not the brightest crown in the box. All right.

933
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,740
I'm a little slow. Where the frick is the shed, bro?

934
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,380
Fia fun jump scare. No.

935
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:29,460
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Must be shocked. No, no, no, no.

936
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,780
I was shocking.

937
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,940
I was shocking as I died.

938
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:48,100
Oh, no. Boomi, get out of the trap.

939
01:30:52,180 --> 01:31:00,580
You dingle. I think I drive a Corolla. I definitely drive a Toyota Corolla with a sick spoiler.

940
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:08,260
Come here, little boys. Tell me, what is, have you spoken about the Lord?

941
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:13,540
Can you say praise Jesus? I don't understand.

942
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:18,660
It's okay to make you more good.

943
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:20,980
Can he?

944
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,900
I like this game a lot so far.

945
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:29,860
Suffer.

946
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:35,460
What?

947
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:37,860
What did you say?

948
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:45,460
What did he just say to me? He sounded, he said he's something and I'll do her.

949
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:49,460
His back seating allowed if I ask for help.

950
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,620
I caught some people walking through the woods around the house last week,

951
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:56,580
not kids, just regular adults. They told me they got lost while hiking.

952
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:59,620
I pointed them back toward the road. The whole thing just didn't feel right.

953
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:02,340
I think I should go dig up Bob's rifle out of the storage.

954
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:05,300
Others, I thought they were going to say I should go dig up Bob's grave.

955
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:15,940
He said corruption, that about my father. Oh, I thought you said I'm going to fuck your mother.

956
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:29,940
Boomi, back off, dude. He keeps trying to jump up on my desk and chew on things.

957
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:35,060
I literally, he's probably like, you haven't spilled time with me all day. All right.

958
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,500
I'm prepared.

959
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:44,420
What?

960
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:55,780
What a beautiful day in the forest. Such a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

961
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,260
Justice for...

962
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,500
Rawr, rawr, rawr, XD.

963
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:14,340
Oh, worship me.

964
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:22,820
Dude, I'm just trying to explore this beautiful. Oh my God, stop. You're doing too much.

965
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:26,420
I'm not interested in you. You got to back off.

966
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:37,380
Like, he looks so goofy when he walks. Nice.

967
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:45,220
Whoa. Bob, the kids and I miss you more every day. The twins and Amy have started their next

968
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:49,220
school year here at home. Amy keeps asking when she's going to be allowed to go to the

969
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,940
real school. I think she's getting cabin fever.

970
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,700
Oh, dang. They're getting homeschooled. That sucks.

971
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,260
The twins are having no problems occupying their time.

972
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,660
Yesterday, they came in with their hands covered in blood.

973
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:07,860
Okay. I like how she's like, says it so casually.

974
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,060
Sorry, I had to mute my burp.

975
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,620
I guess they found a dead deer and thought it would be a good idea to touch it.

976
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:19,540
I think we might have a coyote problem because when I went out with them to look at the dead

977
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:26,340
deer, it was a pretty gruesome sight. I guess they found. You should just say they did find

978
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:29,620
because they found it. You saw a boomy get off my desk. Oh my God, boomy.

979
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:33,700
Boomy please. Look at this man. Look at this man.

980
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:44,900
All this just a day after the twins' birthday party.

981
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:48,420
Can't wait till you come home. Are they dead? They're dead, aren't they?

982
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:51,220
These kids are dead. They're deader than dead.

983
01:34:51,620 --> 01:35:01,620
How did I? I've been going to the right this entire time. How did I circle back around? Okay, well,

984
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:10,500
you know, where are you? Where are you, white boy?

985
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:16,980
Show yourself, white boy. I found you, white man.

986
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:29,780
Lost in the woods. I thought I could find a way out any day now. I take a left. I take a right.

987
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:32,420
I take a step. I see the light.

988
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:46,580
I'm going to bang my head against the desk. I can't even get past this. This is like the tutorial.

989
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:54,740
Oh, nifty.

990
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,820
Oh, I didn't mean to go back in there.

991
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,180
Mortis.

992
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:11,380
He said something about inverted cross, power of inverted cross. I don't know, Spanish. You mean

993
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:21,540
Latin? When you got bars? It's actually from like a like a Zelda thing.

994
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:32,980
Oh, sorry. I'm in a tree.

995
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:42,740
Do you say I have the body of a pig? Who's being hung in this house? Come on now.

996
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:48,340
Enter the house once again. Is this a flashback?

997
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:57,780
Why is there only Amy in this, the family in the picture? Mr. and Mrs. Martin greeted us at

998
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:01,860
the front porch. Mr. Martin led us downstairs to the basement, explaining that Amy was down

999
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:07,060
there in restraints. I felt for him. There was guilt and shame in his voice. Amy was in the very

1000
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:13,300
back of the attic in a chair downstairs to the basement. Amy was in the back of the attic in a

1001
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:22,260
chair. Okay, are we in the attic or the basement? I'm confused. I'm sorry. I'm stuck on that perfectly

1002
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:27,300
calm staring at us. It is hard to describe the look on her face. It was not the kind of look a child

1003
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:37,060
gives you. Should be confused. I should be. That's the question. Interesting. Oh.

1004
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,140
I'm lost spirits in this house. Oh, what a beautiful family.

1005
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:52,020
Anything in the clock? The power of cars compels you. Is there a dude? Oh, that's probably someone's

1006
01:37:52,020 --> 01:38:00,420
jacket. I'm gonna go straight. La la la. Where are the twins? Are they just dead? That sucks.

1007
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:07,380
Is this food or a pumpkin? Hello? La la la la la la. La. Oh.

1008
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:13,300
I don't like how quiet it is.

1009
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:24,660
Nate or hate. Well, it looks like one of the boys drew a beautiful priest

1010
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:31,060
with some sort of entity in the sun. That's really beautiful. Truly beautiful.

1011
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:39,620
I'm gonna, that pot looks suspicious, you know, you never, you never can trust plants

1012
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:43,460
or television. Don't watch television. It's bad for you.

1013
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,460
Oh, that's what makes in the mirror. Despite, oh.

1014
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:57,700
Hello? Despite everything, it's still you.

1015
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:05,380
Um, what the sigma? Can you, can you back up off me a little bit then? Excuse me.

1016
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:12,260
No. What? What? No. Okay. They don't do nothing for you. That's fine.

1017
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:17,220
Boomie. Stop.

1018
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:22,020
Undertail reference. It's death. Follows me. It's death.

1019
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:30,260
Remember the lady in the mirror. Okay. Uh, let's go to the basement first,

1020
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:33,860
because they said basement. So I'm gonna focus on the basement. There's blood.

1021
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:40,900
Love to see it. Uh, I'm gonna, you're a mannequin. You must be demonic. No? Okay. That's fine.

1022
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:47,940
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1023
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,940
Why is there a random piece of fence down here?

1024
01:39:53,460 --> 01:40:00,340
That doesn't, oh, is it like a cradle? Dear Amy, thanks for writing. It really brightened

1025
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:04,740
my day hearing from you. In your letter, you ask what's the weirdest thing I've seen on,

1026
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:13,460
I read that so wrong. Welcome to my crib. I've seen,

1027
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:18,740
that was gonna say seen in missionary, not as a missionary.

1028
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:29,380
The area, I was like, probably not a lot besides the person in front of you. The area

1029
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:36,020
where you're working in has a lot of folks who practice kimbamba, kimbamba. It's might,

1030
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:40,660
might we call it pagan religion? It's kind of a mix of Catholic and African religions, AO.

1031
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:46,500
One of the saints they worship is San La Muerte or Saint Death. That's

1032
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:56,260
Santa La Muerte, Spanish. Yesterday we talked to a boy about 15 when we asked him if he ever

1033
01:40:56,260 --> 01:41:03,940
prayed. He said, no, but I have prayed to San La Muerte. He told us about a time he stayed over

1034
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:10,820
his cousin's house and according to him, they prayed to some figures of San La Muerte and the

1035
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:15,380
figures made things in the house move around. He got real quiet and scared looking after that.

1036
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:19,460
We told him he could pray to God and that God wouldn't make him feel scared like that.

1037
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:24,660
We invited him to church, but he hasn't come yet. I need to wrap this letter up and get back to work.

1038
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:27,380
See you later in four months, Layton.

1039
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:34,100
These letters based on our experience development have crazy. What happened if I prayed to Shibi?

1040
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,980
You just get crazy sex dreams.

1041
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:50,340
One time, I forget what happened actually because I was super young, but I like swore. I saw like

1042
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:56,340
a malicious entity in my childhood bedroom and I remember I prayed really hard to God because

1043
01:41:56,340 --> 01:42:01,940
this is when I was in the church still. I prayed real hard and then I felt better.

1044
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:13,380
No, I think they seem very caught up in something. I'm going to go look at this washing machine.

1045
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:23,700
Jumping up and down, jumping up and down. This is a cobweb. I'm going to exercise it.

1046
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:32,660
Maybe a night terror? Probably. I've already told you guys I've had crazy sleep paralysis,

1047
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,860
but now that I'm a little bit more educated on spiritual things,

1048
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:45,860
I'm not really scared of spirits malicious or otherwise because I know how to deal with them.

1049
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:50,900
And anyways, they're usually just irritated that you're there and you can just be like,

1050
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:58,420
I'm just chilling, bro, and they're like, fine, whatever. Hello? Hello? Or any of you demonic?

1051
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:10,660
I'm going to kiss you. Kiss. Kiss you. All right. Well, I'm assuming when I leave this room,

1052
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:18,260
something's going to come attack me. Oh, cool. Nice.

1053
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:26,660
Chibi's house is haunted. No, no, no, no. Well, my house, like my family home was built in,

1054
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:34,660
like, I think the 1950s. And then a family friend, like my parents rented the house from

1055
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:41,620
and their grandfather died. And I think he's like, he went back to the house and like chills,

1056
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:46,580
but like he's cool with me because he knew me since I was little. So we're cool like that.

1057
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:52,500
So he never bothered us or anything. Sorry, left my ritual circle there. I'll be honest with you,

1058
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:57,540
some of the stuff in this won't scare me because like I am could be like, I do have a very open

1059
01:43:57,540 --> 01:44:05,620
mind and like, and I know a lot about paganism and stuff. And I love horror movies like this.

1060
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:14,900
So they're mannequins, not demons. It should have been me, not them.

1061
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:20,100
Yeah, you know, I just sexually sleep terrors. That's the only thing you can do. It really turns

1062
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:28,100
the spirits up. They're like, why are you sexualizing me? Could not endure witnessing the

1063
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:32,740
proceedings and honestly, the best thing to do if you think there's something there is you ignore it

1064
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:37,380
and then they won't bother you because they usually get a rise out of you.

1065
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:46,260
When they get a rise out of you, they feel more justified, you know, inside Amy's parents could

1066
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:53,940
not endure witnessing that. Sorry, Boomi had to insert something there. What are you doing?

1067
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:00,420
Oh, he's playing with Reina and Reina's not having it. The proceedings of the right for long.

1068
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:07,540
Mrs. Martin was, I hate how quiet it is, though, hysterical and the thing that was inside Amy was

1069
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:12,980
feeding off of the fear. Father Alred asked me to take Martin's upstairs. I was physically worn out,

1070
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:17,700
but managed to get them back up. Why was I physically worn out? All we did was go down the stairs

1071
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:21,540
or the attic. I don't know. Back to the stairs to the kitchen. Amy was screaming,

1072
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:25,780
mother, mother, the whole time. Finally, I got them to sit down with me at the kitchen table.

1073
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:29,540
After a few minutes, we couldn't hear much of anything down in the basement. So I went

1074
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:34,180
down to check on things. I found Father Alred lying on his back unconscious with his arms spread

1075
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:40,820
out wide. Amy was not in the chair. She went to the attic. Didn't she? Hello. I'm going to walk

1076
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:49,780
around this. I'm not going to walk in it. I can't. I don't really, I think those are like pieces of

1077
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:56,980
demonic runes because there are specific demonic names. And I think I forget the book of like,

1078
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:02,580
it was a book. There's a, there's a lot of books that were not included in the Bible that were written.

1079
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:07,780
And there's one that includes all the names of angels and demons. And I feel like this is one

1080
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:11,380
of the symbols that was in that. If you didn't know that, I can't remember. I think it's,

1081
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:16,820
this is the book of Elijah that doesn't, or something with the E. Somebody looked that up.

1082
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:23,940
I forget. Raina's on my desk now. Raina, please. Raina, what are you doing? No, not Solomon.

1083
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:32,100
Song of Solomon, actually. Book of Enoch. Yes, there's the book of Enoch. Yeah. Yeah, I think there

1084
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:41,700
are stuff that some things are, like there is an account of King Solomon, but I think a lot

1085
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:51,220
of it was removed, especially because God was unappreciative of Solomon after a while,

1086
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:58,660
because he took on so many wives and began to take on their pagan customs. So he lost his favor.

1087
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:06,660
Can I scooch around now? Hello? Okay. Raina, I can't have you do this right now. She's like,

1088
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:16,100
oh my God. You can't sit there. Oh my God, you're so heavy.

1089
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:22,660
I'm sorry. You just got like plopped on the floor. I apologize.

1090
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:28,980
It's because she's thickums. She's got something in my eye doing that.

1091
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:39,380
Yeah. Yeah, there was the Christian Bible also took a lot. Yeah, they took out a lot of stuff,

1092
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:43,060
because they just wanted to, you know,

1093
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:48,500
keeping stuff that was relevant and that could be applicable.

1094
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:53,940
The Bible has changed a lot. There's so many different translations of the Bible.

1095
01:47:54,740 --> 01:48:04,740
Oh, my dead. Hello.

1096
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,540
Oh, hey there, Amy.

1097
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:16,420
How the heck did I?

1098
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:26,020
Oh, here she comes. She's a man. Sorry, I just got a, I got a thing saying, whoa, here she comes.

1099
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:35,780
Oh, I love the art in this. You can see my heart. It did go up a bit.

1100
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:40,660
I guess I was the only one who thought to check in the attic when I got up there. It was freezing

1101
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:45,060
cold. I found Amy standing in the back looking straight at me like when I first met her downstairs.

1102
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:49,460
We spoke briefly, although it was frustrating to talk to her or it.

1103
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:53,140
I experienced a bit of deception from the demon. During a conversation,

1104
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:56,980
she uttered my mother's first name and in other instances spoke perfect Latin.

1105
01:48:56,980 --> 01:49:01,380
I called for help from the others, but nobody came. So I raised my crucifix and began the ride again.

1106
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:10,580
Can I take that? Give me the doll.

1107
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:18,820
Bob must be stationed somewhere in the Middle East. Okay, so Bob must be

1108
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:25,700
the husband, the father sent over this weird doll for Amy's birthday. I'll ask

1109
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:29,940
Anish about it next time we have book club. She looks like she could be from over there.

1110
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:34,660
Her name's Anish. She's probably from the Middle East.

1111
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:39,460
Amy didn't seem excited to see the doll. I think she would rather have a phone instead,

1112
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:43,220
or maybe seeing a baby doll makes her feel so conscious about working at the clinic.

1113
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:48,100
I'm working at the clinic. What clinic is this 15 year old girl working at?

1114
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:53,220
It's interesting because a lot of things, entities can attach themselves to items.

1115
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:59,780
Everything's missing ahead. Excuse you.

1116
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:07,460
So I wouldn't be surprised if something in the house either attached itself.

1117
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:10,660
Oh, Robert Duckie. You're low on Robert.

1118
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:17,780
Oh, what am I supposed to do there?

1119
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:25,300
Amy's just like, don't go in the bathroom, motherfucker. Don't go in the bathroom.

1120
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:32,740
I'll book a self-spire so his face, you don't come power, it could fix this.

1121
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:46,180
Oh, it's so well animated. I would love, I don't know if you guys have watched Molly Moon before,

1122
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:49,460
but I would love a collaboration of this guy and Molly Moon, although they did.

1123
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:54,420
I know Molly Moon did work on a game with someone, but it fell through, but Molly Moon is so unsettling.

1124
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:56,820
No, I looked at this.

1125
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:06,020
It's all, yeah, it's rotoscope. Yeah, it's just like, it's so coolly rotoscoped though.

1126
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:11,540
I'm assuming when I walk a certain, oh, I'm gonna run, I'm gonna run.

1127
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:15,620
I'm assuming I have to leave a room fast.

1128
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:23,300
No, okay. I guess I can't linger in rooms. She just won't let me linger in rooms.

1129
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:26,020
I wanted to chat with the rubber ducky. I'm not allowed.

1130
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:41,860
Yeah, I can't, can I not? All right, I'm going downstairs.

1131
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:48,100
She's chasing me. She's a manny to go away, Amy.

1132
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:53,780
Amy, I'm going back to the basement. I'm being chased back to the basement.

1133
01:51:54,580 --> 01:52:01,620
This is bad. Let me go back upstairs. Yeah, okay. Oh, stuck on the stairs. I'm stuck on the stairs.

1134
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:04,980
It's fine. It's fine. She's walking slowly.

1135
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:15,860
Okay, she comes from the table. Yeah. Okay, how do I...

1136
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:21,940
I can't open the door. Is that where I'm supposed to go?

1137
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:30,660
Yeah, I'm only willing to walk to the side. Compellent? Jesus Christ, compelent!

1138
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:32,020
Compellent!

1139
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,020
Not no.

1140
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:50,100
Yeah, but where's the key? Where the key at?

1141
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:59,220
I'm forgetting something. Okay. I always found the ideas of spirits interesting.

1142
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:04,660
I've never been able to believe in them since recently. I was raised so that like ghosts don't

1143
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:08,660
exist, but that demons do, but then I realized that there's definitely both.

1144
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,060
Maybe I need to play Simon Says.

1145
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:19,940
No, is that not the key? The key is not Simon Says or an Etch-a-Sketch.

1146
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:22,740
Or one of those little pushy thingies.

1147
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:27,860
Do I need to maybe do each room?

1148
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:36,980
Congrats on the 10k. Thank y'all. I'm going back to my roots with my habit.

1149
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:47,860
Erm.

1150
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:59,220
I'm just chasing Amy until the door opens. Okay.

1151
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:03,620
I picked one. I picked the real one. Was I supposed to flash it again?

1152
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,260
Yeah, I know she's fucking here.

1153
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:17,860
Pick the right. I looked up to the right because I was like that.

1154
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:20,900
Do I have to do it again?

1155
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:31,700
Oh, okay. I see now. I get it now.

1156
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,500
Come here. Come here, you.

1157
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:40,740
I don't know what you said, but sure.

1158
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:52,820
Yeah, whatever you say, girly pop.

1159
01:54:56,420 --> 01:55:01,460
Oh, here she comes. I feel like I can hear Boomi eating something.

1160
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:05,220
Oh, come back here. Come back here. Get over here.

1161
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:17,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you. I know your type. It's dead.

1162
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:21,780
All right, I'm going to try to go to every room and do this.

1163
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:26,500
Oh my gosh, she almost got me that time because I walked so close to the sigil.

1164
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:30,740
Hello?

1165
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:39,060
Finally.

1166
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:45,060
Jumping up and down, jumping up and down.

1167
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,260
Rubber ducky is awful suspicious. Nah.

1168
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:58,420
I know your type. It's down. Down for what? Down to clown?

1169
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:06,420
Uh, someone threw pasta sauce everywhere.

1170
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:10,580
Molly, speak. Speak of the devil.

1171
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:15,540
The church might contact you in a few days to tell you their version of what happened to me.

1172
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:20,020
I want you to hear it from me first. Find you want me to voice act?

1173
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:25,940
Molly. Sorry, I just had like a gurgle in my throat.

1174
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:29,540
Oh, no, I dropped them my spaghetti.

1175
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:41,460
Molly, the church might contact you in a few days to tell you their version of what happened to me.

1176
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:48,340
I want you to hear it from me first. A year ago, I was involved in the exorcism of Amy Martin.

1177
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:50,980
What they say in the papers about what happened isn't true.

1178
01:56:51,220 --> 01:57:00,980
She, father, my superior, with when I confronted her, she managed to cut the power to the house and

1179
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:07,540
her own parents with her own. I have to go back to the house. The nightmares. I'm having no real.

1180
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:13,940
She's still there waiting for me. I can still help her if I don't come back.

1181
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:17,220
Know that I love you and I'm sorry.

1182
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:25,140
Finally free for my social obligations. Welcome back, Jackson. Thank you for the super.

1183
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:30,100
My ex-wife still misses me, but the church covered up this route.

1184
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:36,980
Father Nick Cage. I know I realized I was doing a Nick Cage voice.

1185
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:45,860
Oh, aren't you a fun little guy with a little smiley face who put pasta on the

1186
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:49,860
table? I can do that too.

1187
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:57,940
Hey, bitch. Oh.

1188
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:06,500
Yeah, you look really good.

1189
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:10,340
Ah, debatable.

1190
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:19,460
Your face is just a white fucking sheet. I don't understand.

1191
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:31,060
Who are you? You dancing? Die. Am I supposed to move? I don't. What are you doing, bro?

1192
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:39,060
Uh.

1193
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:44,900
What am I supposed to do?

1194
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,220
Run, you fool.

1195
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:57,700
Keep flashing her. I was flashing her. Yeah, I don't care. Can I skip this?

1196
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:02,100
Do you think my face is pretty?

1197
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,300
I have to finish what I started.

1198
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,860
Be scared by this crucifix.

1199
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:19,540
All right. Do I run away from him?

1200
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:40,420
Oh, my God. This is hard.

1201
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:52,020
Oh, you're so close to me.

1202
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:58,180
You feel so close to you right now. It's a force field. What the fuck? There's two of you?

1203
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:05,220
Now I'm being attacked by gray men. Ah. Okay. I need to like line you guys up so you

1204
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:09,700
guys just like kind of walk with each other. I don't know. You guys are staggered.

1205
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:13,780
Oh, I kind of want to make them go on top of each other. Not like in a sexual life.

1206
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:21,780
Can you guys like stop? Like so close to me. Here. Come all the way over here, please.

1207
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:27,700
Thank you. All right. Cool. That's not working. Oh, God.

1208
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:31,940
Hey. Oh, I'm going. I'm pointing the wrong way. It's fine.

1209
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:39,380
Here. Come over here. Just. Yeah. Just do that.

1210
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:44,180
Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. It's a salad. Oh.

1211
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:50,180
Hey, queen. Oh, you don't have a face.

1212
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:53,140
Oh.

1213
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:08,020
Well, I didn't know I had to hold it.

1214
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:16,980
Mordis. Oh, at least I don't have to do that again.

1215
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:20,580
Oh, you're so pretty.

1216
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:33,940
Die. Die. Die. Am I supposed to run out the way? I'm assuming I'm supposed to. No, not the zap.

1217
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,580
Okay. Okay.

1218
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:35,480
Here.

1219
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:43,060
It's not doing it.

1220
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:51,380
Where is she? What is happening now?

1221
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:05,300
Oh.

1222
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:15,620
You. Eenie, meanie, miney. You.

1223
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:21,380
Die. Die. Die. Die. What?

1224
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:29,460
Which one? Which one? You. Freak.

1225
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:34,260
Sorry, I was distracted because I could hear Reina growling at boomie.

1226
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:42,580
Bro, if you keep back-seeding, I'm gonna eat your fucking booty hole. Shut the fuck up.

1227
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:46,020
I'm bad at games. You're supposed to be enjoying that.

1228
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:58,580
Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. You. You. What? Oh.

1229
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:01,860
Mordis.

1230
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:05,620
Right. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left.

1231
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,500
Backseat's harder.

1232
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:21,940
Okay, I'll chat. Haram, if you don't behave yourself, I'm gonna sound you.

1233
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:35,300
Which one? Oh, frick, I couldn't tell.

1234
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:41,860
Yeah, yeah, you're getting sounded. You're getting sounded. You're getting so fucking sounded.

1235
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:44,980
You're getting sounded with something spiky.

1236
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:53,940
You know what? I'm gonna, I'm gonna turn real small. I'm gonna turn real small,

1237
02:03:53,940 --> 02:04:01,060
and I'm gonna climb in, and then we know what I'm gonna do.

1238
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:07,380
I'm gonna grow up big again, and then I'm gonna kill you and explode you,

1239
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:12,260
just like how they did in fucking, you know.

1240
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:36,820
Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. Whoop. Oh, I just dodged that one.

1241
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:39,380
Can you die already?

1242
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:48,180
Yee. Yee. Yee. Yee. Yee.

1243
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:58,740
Yeeah. By the power of Christ. Yeeah. Yeeah.

1244
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:01,380
Whoop. Yeeah. Yeeah.

1245
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:03,380
Wait, am I done yet?

1246
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:13,060
Yeeah. Yeeah. Please. Can I be over?

1247
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:19,220
Whoop. Oh, you slippery devil, ain't ya? My headphone is falling out.

1248
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:28,820
Yay. Oh, oh no. Oh, what's happening here?

1249
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:32,660
Morties.

1250
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:36,340
Babe, this is only phase two.

1251
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:46,660
Phase three. No shit, it's phase three.

1252
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:54,180
I'm assuming I just don't walk along a pentagram.

1253
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:00,100
What the hell?

1254
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:03,460
Oh, no, no, not the time.

1255
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:12,020
No. I can't do this. I need a shock.

1256
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:22,020
Oh, I must piss myself. Make it stop. I don't know how to do this.

1257
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:26,820
She caught me.

1258
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:35,860
Because it's a trinity. Oh my god, no way.

1259
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:45,860
Oh, I thought I was doing a souls game boss. Can I just? Can you? Can you? Bitch. Can you?

1260
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:50,820
Fucking die already then.

1261
02:06:51,620 --> 02:07:00,580
Okay, you kind of got it. Oh, sorry, I walked into you. I totally didn't mean to bump you.

1262
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:08,980
Animation doing revivals on this boss, but I know, right? I really like the rotoscoping.

1263
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:17,700
Why do you got a hand? Oh, I didn't mean to step there. I'm really sorry. Hold on,

1264
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:21,780
maybe it's a little bit bigger. Oh, that's discord. It's not what I wanted.

1265
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:38,820
I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I have a nagging fear. Someone else is pulling on the strings.

1266
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:47,460
Something terrible is coming down through the entire town, wreaking anarchy and all it brings.

1267
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:56,420
I can't sit highly. No, I can't move at all. I curse the name the one behind it.

1268
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:07,060
Amy, I'm Helen at the moon and sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon.

1269
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:11,620
Oh my god, fucking. Can you? I wasn't even near you.

1270
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:23,700
It's actually my favorite living tombstone song. Get away from me. Get away from me, you whore.

1271
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:30,260
Get away. I don't want horse. I'm a holy nun. I'm a holy fucking nun. I'm a holy, oh my god.

1272
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:38,820
Holy guacamole. I'm a nun. Nope. Nope. I'm a nun. You can't fuck with nuns. I'm a nun.

1273
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:41,540
Nope. I'm a nun. Fuck.

1274
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:53,380
Mortice, maybe don't sit. You know what? I don't have any mods anymore. I'm taking things into my own hands.

1275
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:58,020
Bye. You too. You too.

1276
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:04,980
You're gone. Get out of here. You're both gone.

1277
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:14,580
Suck my clit, bro. I'm not that mad. I'm actually not mad. I just want to, you guys are annoying.

1278
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:19,380
Oh my god. Fuck.

1279
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:31,220
No, you guys, if you want to be a mod, you can apply to be a mod in the discord like everybody else.

1280
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:36,500
My mods just don't exist anymore. I buy myself. So, uh, yeah.

1281
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:45,620
I'm gonna get you. I was, I'm far away from her. I don't understand.

1282
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:51,940
Yeah, actually it's too much work. Honestly, my chat's pretty cool. I don't really have to do much

1283
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:58,820
to be honest with you. Uh, and my mods don't have to do much. So, it's funny. No.

1284
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:07,700
I literally just had a vision. It came to me in a dream where I picked up my keyboard and I smashed it against the wall.

1285
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:16,820
I mean, she's kind of fast. You're right. You're right. All right. Focus up. Focus up queens.

1286
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:24,100
Okay. So, she goes to this side and then she does it to that side. Oh, then she goes down

1287
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:30,980
and then, oh, frick. I meant to get out of the way because, and she bounces and crosses and goes to

1288
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:35,860
that corner and then that corner and then that corner. I'm pointing. You guys can't see. Oh, it's

1289
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:45,860
really dark. I feel you. I don't have any of my lights on for extra spooky. This is the hardest

1290
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:52,260
fight in the game. I hope not. Oh, all right. Queen.

1291
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:04,820
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, my sweet girl. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1292
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:16,020
Oh, you're free. Oh, you're free. Sometimes when I'm like super regi, I'll like, she'll be on my desk

1293
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:22,180
when I'm playing games. Oh, thank you. And I'll just pet her. Oh, you're going to give me a lick.

1294
02:11:22,180 --> 02:11:29,700
Oh, thank you for the calming licks. The calming licks. That's what I need. Thank you, queen.

1295
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:41,300
Thank you for licking my hand. Oh, I'm being healed. Being healed by this princess.

1296
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:49,780
Don't chew on my nail. Okay, thank you. Okay. Can you stop? You can stop licking me now.

1297
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:54,900
Oh, you're sweet girl. Sweet girl. Thank you. Go back to sleep.

1298
02:11:54,900 --> 02:12:03,700
GG. So save me. You're a whore. Damn.

1299
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:17,060
All righty. Hello. Oh, frick. Nope.

1300
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:27,140
Oh.

1301
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:40,420
It's honestly comical, the way that I don't, my hand is on the mouse and it doesn't need to be.

1302
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:46,900
I don't know when my hand is on the mouse. I'm not using my mouse. Where's my, I don't have my arm

1303
02:12:46,900 --> 02:12:52,660
pressed. Let me turn on the light.

1304
02:12:56,420 --> 02:13:03,860
Hello. I usually stream in the dark, but I realize that's not good. Oh, I need to charge my,

1305
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:13,300
frick. It's my, okay. We'll see if my phone dies. Oh, no, this isn't a good one. No, just kill me,

1306
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:16,580
just kill me, just kill me, just kill me, just kill me, just kill me. Thank you. I need to get my

1307
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:18,900
charger because my phone is dying.

1308
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:26,980
You're a sweet girl. I need a snack.

1309
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:34,180
Thank you. You want to sneak to charge you? Only going to charge you. Well,

1310
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:52,340
I'm out of uncrustables. I'm out of almonds. I'm hungry. I'm dying. Boomi's on my desk.

1311
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:59,060
You know what this calls for? A waffle. Yeah, right now. This calls for a waffle.

1312
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:24,900
I'm making waffles in the morning. I'm making waffles.

1313
02:14:24,980 --> 02:14:35,620
I'm making an egg old waffle with butter and syrup, thick and fluffy butter milk,

1314
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:45,620
just like your mom. But they call it in high school. So I'm saying I knew her well. I knew her very well.

1315
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:56,900
I feel, sorry for acting like a brat. Yeah, brats get caught.

1316
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:09,060
Yeah, I can tan talk. Oh, you guys want to see? You guys want to see? I'm tan. I'm tan. Oh, wait.

1317
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:11,060
I'm tan.

1318
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:27,300
Boomi, get the f**k out the way. F**k out the way. Boom. Say hi. Say hi.

1319
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:43,620
Kiss. Kiss you, Boomi. Kiss you. He's like, please put me down. Yeah, that's your punishment, getting

1320
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:48,180
kissed. How'd you become a Gyaru? I'm black.

1321
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:57,300
I've been told I only have two jokes and it's that I'm black and that I'm white.

1322
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:06,500
And you'd be correct. That is the only humor I have is talking about how brown I am.

1323
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:20,420
What color are you today, Madam? You know, I'm feeling brown. I almost actually was,

1324
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:25,620
I almost was white today because the model, it doesn't, like you can kind of,

1325
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:32,500
you can kind of see, like, I can't, if I made this, it would make, these aren't separated,

1326
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:36,900
layers, and you can see my wrist is white and my arms are right, but they're all connected.

1327
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:40,580
You could see, like, I had to, in order to make this brown, I had to, I don't know,

1328
02:16:40,580 --> 02:16:45,460
my boobs are breathing. Don't worry about that. I had to make that part brown, so.

1329
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:58,820
Where are you looking, you harlot? I don't know why I'm, oh, I just realized that my entire outfit

1330
02:16:58,820 --> 02:17:08,340
is on for some reason. Don't worry about that. Has that there been there the entire time? Bumi's

1331
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:20,260
lawyer! Zap? Bumi's lawyer?

1332
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:31,700
Photo shoot chance of you in this outfit? Photo shoot chance? Oh, like, you want me to be cute?

1333
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:57,140
I don't know, my ears disappear when that happens, but don't worry about it.

1334
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:14,900
I'm just making funny faces.

1335
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:28,420
Did you guys, like, yeah, I got, did you guys get your photos

1336
02:18:29,060 --> 02:18:31,780
so you can study your Bibles later?

1337
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:51,620
It's not yes. Good job. Ignore my white arms.

1338
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:01,620
Okay.

1339
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:16,180
You did what in the name of the Lord?

1340
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:23,620
I can't believe you would do such a thing. Wait, wait, wait.

1341
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:31,940
Don't ask why my face is white.

1342
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:51,620
No, I didn't mean to press that. No, Rick, no! Make it stop.

1343
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:06,580
Wait, go back to the blackest one. What do you mean the blackest one?

1344
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:15,860
Sorry, can you be, like, a newbie in princess for me for just a second?

1345
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:21,460
I accept your apology.

1346
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:33,060
So I will randomly change color when I switch between the toggles. I don't know why it does that.

1347
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:43,380
Like when I change. Wait, what am I pressing? So this is, like, what they first gave me

1348
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:48,900
that I adjusted and I'm like, they say that this is hell bunny where I'm just really red

1349
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:53,220
and look like I'm sunburnt. It's cute. I think I might use this for, like, a succubus outfit.

1350
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:59,300
Oh, shit. That's not what I want to press. Oh, shit. That's not what I want to press.

1351
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:08,580
No, I don't want to turn on that sort of browsing, whatever that is.

1352
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:13,300
Oh, Lord have mercy. I'm about to bust.

1353
02:21:15,540 --> 02:21:20,740
Well, is this what you were talking about? That randomly makes me give myself black face?

1354
02:21:20,740 --> 02:21:21,620
Is that what you meant?

1355
02:21:27,300 --> 02:21:28,340
Yeah, that's what he meant.

1356
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:37,140
Oh, my moderators are here! The charcoal one! Oh, that was loud.

1357
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:42,740
Oh, you already have a photo? Yeah, I know you guys already have a photo.

1358
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:46,100
That shading is kind of normal.

1359
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:54,740
Can you hold on? Can you please toggle it so you look like you're being really inappropriate?

1360
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,300
Thank you.

1361
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:01,780
Oh, hold on. My whole outfit is on again. There we go.

1362
02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:07,140
Honestly, like the white version of it, but the black one is up.

1363
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:13,620
The black one's all right, I guess.

1364
02:22:19,780 --> 02:22:22,100
Brother. Does Bro know?

1365
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:27,620
Does Bro know? Hold on. My waffles need to be toasted again.

1366
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:40,980
So, the reason why I make that my only freaking joke,

1367
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:45,940
one, I like self-deprecating humor, two, people don't know I'm brown.

1368
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:49,940
I look white.

1369
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:56,100
I'm gonna punch you. Punch the mic. Punch the mic. Punch the mic.

1370
02:22:58,180 --> 02:23:01,940
Peep, peep, peep, peep. I just look, yeah, I don't.

1371
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:08,260
You can tell that I'm brown, though, because my knuckles aren't pink. You can see, like,

1372
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:14,980
if I was, if I was a white woman, it would be different.

1373
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:19,460
Toasted waffles, just like my Gucci.

1374
02:23:22,180 --> 02:23:25,140
Mixed or just light-skinned? Oh, I am mixed and light-skinned.

1375
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:30,980
I'm mixed, mixed, mixed and light-skinned.

1376
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:35,380
Oh, Boomi, come over here. Stop bothering me.

1377
02:23:38,020 --> 02:23:42,260
Oh, I still have stew to eat. Oh my God, I got to make stew. Fuck.

1378
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:47,220
What? What do you want, Boomi? Why are you freaking out?

1379
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:51,940
Treat? No treat. Treat? No treat. Treat?

1380
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:56,500
Oh, you just wanted to give me a headbutt. Oh, you just wanted to give me a headbutt?

1381
02:23:56,500 --> 02:24:01,500
What are you doing?

1382
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:05,500
Oh, you give me lots of head butts like you want something.

1383
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:08,500
Are you trying to seduce me to give you a treat?

1384
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,500
It's not gonna work.

1385
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,500
You get fed in 30 minutes.

1386
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:15,500
It's not gonna work, big man. Nice try though.

1387
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:18,500
You got a good effort. Can you give me a physical?

1388
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:20,500
Oh, good physical.

1389
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:24,500
Hope you just got scared by the toaster because you're a little bitch.

1390
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:27,500
You're lightly burnt. It's fine.

1391
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:31,500
Smells good. Delicious.

1392
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:33,500
Mama, mama, mama.

1393
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:37,500
I wanna hold him like I do in Texas, please.

1394
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:40,500
Hold my hand, make me come with a hand.

1395
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,500
He loves me. I love it.

1396
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:45,500
I don't even know which child he has.

1397
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:47,500
No, you're not who he meant.

1398
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:49,500
Who's with the woman for the boy.

1399
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:51,500
Uh oh. Uh oh.

1400
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:54,500
Boomi, you can't have a waffle.

1401
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:57,500
Boomi.

1402
02:24:57,500 --> 02:25:00,500
I almost dropped my waffle.

1403
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:02,500
Boomi, Boomi.

1404
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:04,500
Boomi, you dropped your pocket.

1405
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:08,500
Boomi, you dropped your pocket. Pick up your pocket, Boomi.

1406
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:13,500
Ha ha, got you. You made you look, Boomi.

1407
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:15,500
Got him.

1408
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:20,500
Yeah, got him.

1409
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:23,500
They take all my trash. Excuse me.

1410
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:26,500
So many boxes.

1411
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:33,500
All the little gifty poos that my harem loves to spoil me with. Thank you.

1412
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:39,500
I think, yeah, the stuff came in in terms of like the shade.

1413
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:42,500
So I'll try to put those up tomorrow.

1414
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:45,500
Boomi, came home and brought us.

1415
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:47,500
Boomi, came home and brought us.

1416
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:53,500
I'm not sure if this is true to him. This will not stand. We will see you in court.

1417
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:58,500
Hi, Raina. Hi, Fii.

1418
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:06,500
Yeah, boy. Waffle time.

1419
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:08,500
Again, of his lawyer, Justice for Boomi.

1420
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:10,500
Shut up. Boomi doesn't need justice.

1421
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:13,500
Boomi needs to be arraigned and put in jail.

1422
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:18,500
That's what needs to happen to Boomi.

1423
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:22,500
Denying my client waffles. No!

1424
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:25,500
I'm being rude to this little stand. We'll see you in court.

1425
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:28,500
Money for the Boomi lawyer form. I have to do this three times.

1426
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:30,500
Okay.

1427
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:35,500
Boomi, please leave. He's going to take my waffles. Fii, hold this.

1428
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:37,500
Thank you.

1429
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:41,500
She's so cute. Okay, let me take that off of you.

1430
02:26:41,500 --> 02:26:45,500
Boomi, don't chew on my headphones.

1431
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:48,500
Here, I have a brush. I'm brushing you. I'm brushing you.

1432
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:52,500
Ha ha. Ha ha. Get brushed. Get brushed. Ha ha.

1433
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:58,500
You'll flee because you don't like being brushed.

1434
02:26:58,500 --> 02:27:03,500
She's just standing there, menacingly.

1435
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:06,500
Okay, fat boy.

1436
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:08,500
I'm putting you over here. Okay.

1437
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:12,500
Okay, I need to shock myself three times.

1438
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:15,500
Uh!

1439
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:18,500
Uh! Wait. I don't think it's on.

1440
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:25,500
Properly. Okay.

1441
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:29,500
Wait, what the heck?

1442
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:32,500
Ah! Okay.

1443
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:35,500
I did it like five times.

1444
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:38,500
Brushing Saturday nights.

1445
02:27:38,500 --> 02:27:41,500
Give me the other cat. Fii is not going to eat them.

1446
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:44,500
You want some waffles, Fii?

1447
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:46,500
She's just like, I'm good.

1448
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:49,500
Actually, she likes the smell of the butter.

1449
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:52,500
I don't know.

1450
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:02,500
Priced a bump to shock setting.

1451
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:06,500
I don't know what should be the price be to bump the shock setting.

1452
02:28:06,500 --> 02:28:09,500
I didn't do this in advance.

1453
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:13,500
I didn't plan this.

1454
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:22,500
Well, I planned it a week ago, but I didn't really plan out the scum antics.

1455
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:25,500
Guys, I just...

1456
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:28,500
Should I make it that my heart, when my heart rate is 90?

1457
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:30,500
I get shocked? I don't know.

1458
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:35,500
Because I like, again, I have a naturally resting heart rate.

1459
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:42,500
On death? I agree. I think on death will be better.

1460
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:49,500
Okay, when I die, I'll shock myself.

1461
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:52,500
You want some butter, honey and jam?

1462
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:05,500
Chug, chug my lean.

1463
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:08,500
Come, come, my lady, come, come, my lady.

1464
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:11,500
Here, my butterfly. Sugar, baby.

1465
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:13,500
Oh, we need some belly.

1466
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:17,500
Oh, the belly. The belly.

1467
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:21,500
Sorry to mess up your food.

1468
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:32,500
Shocking on good death will be built in good beginning.

1469
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:35,500
Death shock for 15 increase.

1470
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:40,500
Well, I already have it on a high setting, guys.

1471
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:43,500
I can't really go super. I have it maxed out.

1472
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:46,500
And then there's one setting above that.

1473
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:51,500
Are you good for you?

1474
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:05,500
Um, Game of Slaps ships pretty fast, because my order came in, like, three days.

1475
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:11,500
But I'm American, so...

1476
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:16,500
Well, I'm just so funny that nobody laughed.

1477
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:19,500
But I'm American, so, loser.

1478
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:27,500
I already ate the Incredibles, guys.

1479
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:29,500
I was really depressed.

1480
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:33,500
Okay, I eat my feelings when I'm depressed.

1481
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:39,500
Which is often. It's a miracle I'm not a whale.

1482
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:44,500
Thank you, my jeans.

1483
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:49,500
Grocery fun for Shibi. I just went grocery shopping.

1484
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:51,500
Although it's funny, because, like, I put everything away,

1485
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:54,500
and it looked like I didn't get anything, and it was $250.

1486
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:02,500
Hey, yes, whales have feelings, too.

1487
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:05,500
Aw, I love the whales.

1488
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:11,500
Trust me, I really don't care about body tape on other people.

1489
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:15,500
It's funny, because, like, people always, like, freak out about body types.

1490
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:18,500
Like, you just know it's, like, projecting.

1491
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:24,500
And that took me a while to realize that, um, the people just project,

1492
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:27,500
because I realized I was projecting, and then I worked on myself,

1493
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:29,500
and now I don't project.

1494
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:33,500
Now, I love myself and my body, minus my boobs, because they're giant,

1495
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:35,500
but, you know, it is what it is.

1496
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:38,500
You take some, you lose some, you win some.

1497
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:44,500
So, like, I'll be honest with you, like, I used to be big at one point,

1498
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:47,500
and then I was like, fuck it, we're getting,

1499
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:49,500
this is during COVID, like everybody else.

1500
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:52,500
I'm like, fuck it, we're getting our life together, sis.

1501
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:55,500
So, I dropped, like, 50 pounds.

1502
02:31:55,500 --> 02:32:01,500
Um, and I used to be, like, a 34D, just, like, a regular D,

1503
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:05,500
and then when I gained the weight, I was, like, a 34F,

1504
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:09,500
and I dropped the weight, and I'm back to, like, where I was,

1505
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:12,500
and my boobs did not shrink.

1506
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:17,500
It was bad.

1507
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:21,500
Yeah, I did, like, a very rigorous, um, like, calorie counting.

1508
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:26,500
Uh, my dad, like, um, I avoided sugar.

1509
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:29,500
I only had gluten, especially because my family is mostly gluten-free

1510
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:35,500
and sugar-free, because my mom, uh, is something similar to celiac,

1511
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:38,500
but she doesn't have celiac, and then my dad is diabetic,

1512
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:41,500
so my family eats pretty healthy in general.

1513
02:32:41,500 --> 02:32:46,500
Uh, but yeah, it just, like, and so, like, now I'm, like,

1514
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:51,500
skinny with huge boobs, and it sucks because, like,

1515
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:55,500
I sound so fucking pretentious right now, I'm sorry,

1516
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:59,500
um, because, again, my breasts don't fit my frame,

1517
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:02,500
so I look way bigger than I am.

1518
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:04,500
I will show you right now, I don't care.

1519
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:06,500
Uh, hold on.

1520
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:10,500
So, Jesus Christ.

1521
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:14,500
So, you see here, I look, you know, pretty big,

1522
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:17,500
because my boobs start there, this is my stomach,

1523
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:20,500
and then it's up there.

1524
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:25,500
But if I sit up and I pull back, you can see,

1525
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:30,500
or if I lift up, because my waist is up here,

1526
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:39,500
I'm, uh, I'm a lot skinnier.

1527
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:45,500
Um, so it's just, it looks like a cute, it is a cute baggy

1528
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:48,500
sweatshirt that I got water on.

1529
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:57,500
Nice argument, however it's slapped.

1530
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:59,500
Uh, don't ask me to go.

1531
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:01,500
But yeah, why am I pointing it at myself?

1532
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:03,500
I didn't mean to.

1533
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:05,500
Let's go back to Cat Cam.

1534
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:07,500
Yeah.

1535
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:11,500
Cute baby, she's doing better, I just give her her steroids

1536
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:12,500
because she's going to void it out.

1537
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:14,500
Oh, can I do a big stretch?

1538
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:17,500
Pia, can we do a big stretch for everybody?

1539
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:18,500
Ready?

1540
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:22,500
Big stretch, oh, you guys can even see it.

1541
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,500
She's going to stretch a little bit.

1542
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:27,500
Oh, my sweet girl, oh, my sweet girl.

1543
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:30,500
Here, let me give you the, let me give you a little treat.

1544
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:39,500
Pia, where are your treats?

1545
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:40,500
Did I take them out?

1546
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:42,500
Oh, I did.

1547
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:44,500
I need to buy more treats.

1548
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:47,500
I need to go to the cat food store.

1549
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:53,500
I like giving them little minnows, like I give them these.

1550
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:55,500
I'll show you.

1551
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:58,500
My pants are falling down, thanks.

1552
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:03,500
Um, she's chilling.

1553
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:07,500
I like to give them these, they're like little fishies.

1554
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:09,500
You want a fishy?

1555
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:13,500
Let me get you a whole one.

1556
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:15,500
There's not many left in here.

1557
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:18,500
Here you go, damn it.

1558
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:21,500
A fishy?

1559
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,500
Oh, you missed.

1560
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:26,500
She's very tired right now, I can tell.

1561
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:28,500
She hasn't been taken, boomie.

1562
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:31,500
Do you mind, bro?

1563
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:35,500
It's, it's hard for her to chew, because like it takes a lot of strength,

1564
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:41,500
so I've been giving her wet food, or softened food.

1565
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:43,500
Good girl, Pia.

1566
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:46,500
Oh, you munchin'.

1567
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:49,500
She almost has to like suck on it like a lollipop,

1568
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:51,500
so it like softens up for her.

1569
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:53,500
Ooh, big rip.

1570
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:56,500
You trying to crunch that, huh, little girl?

1571
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:58,500
Mm, tasty.

1572
02:35:58,500 --> 02:36:01,500
Mm, tasty.

1573
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:03,500
She munchin'.

1574
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:06,500
But you can see that she can't really hold her head up.

1575
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:08,500
She's very tired.

1576
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:10,500
It's like a car when it runs out of gas,

1577
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:13,500
so she just doesn't have the strength.

1578
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:16,500
You lickin'?

1579
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:19,500
You want it? Are you done?

1580
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:31,500
Okay, I'll give you like one more piece you can rip off.

1581
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:34,500
You just dropped some, man.

1582
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:37,500
Here, have that little piece.

1583
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:40,500
Have that little piece, eat that.

1584
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:43,500
That's soft enough for you. Here, take it.

1585
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:47,500
Pia, you know how to eat from my hand. Take that.

1586
02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:49,500
Come on.

1587
02:36:49,500 --> 02:36:51,500
You know, are you done? Okay.

1588
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:52,500
Here, boomie, you can have it.

1589
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:54,500
Boomie, what are you doing?

1590
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:56,500
Take, take it.

1591
02:36:56,500 --> 02:37:01,500
No, you don't want it? You don't want this?

1592
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:03,500
Ew, there's like fish guts on my hands.

1593
02:37:03,500 --> 02:37:06,500
Here, go eat that. Thank you, sir.

1594
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:11,500
Eat the squeeze of those treats, because, yeah,

1595
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:14,500
I have some chudu, but I'm like the chudu thingy,

1596
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:17,500
so I'm almost out.

1597
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:24,500
If you're new here,

1598
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:29,500
Pia is my little Siamese kitty mix.

1599
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:31,500
She is a lilac point.

1600
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:33,500
She's the sweetest little girl.

1601
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:36,500
She got really nice pinto beans.

1602
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:43,500
She has a rare disease where she is paralyzed from the neck down.

1603
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:47,500
It goes away, though. It's really weird.

1604
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:51,500
If she's on medication for a while, it goes away.

1605
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:56,500
And then she can run and jump and go and do cat stuff,

1606
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:59,500
but she has, I just came back from a trip

1607
02:37:59,500 --> 02:38:01,500
and I don't know if me being gone triggered

1608
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:06,500
or stressed her out that she can't move again,

1609
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:09,500
but don't worry, I got her on medication.

1610
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:12,500
I was with her at the vet today all day

1611
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:15,500
because the medication they gave was incorrect yesterday,

1612
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:17,500
so I got rid of that.

1613
02:38:17,500 --> 02:38:19,500
I have to wean her off of it, though.

1614
02:38:19,500 --> 02:38:20,500
Can't just end it.

1615
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:22,500
But she is a tough girl.

1616
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:25,500
She's very tough. This happened before in March

1617
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:28,500
and she knows her drill, but she's a tough girl.

1618
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:32,500
She's really tough, but she's giving me kisses.

1619
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:33,500
She knows.

1620
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:34,500
I take care of her.

1621
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:36,500
I'm so proud of my O.S.H.I.

1622
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:38,500
Excuse me.

1623
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:41,500
Yeah, why don't you give yourself a little room?

1624
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:42,500
What?

1625
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:43,500
Did I miss something?

1626
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:44,500
My headphones are off.

1627
02:38:44,500 --> 02:38:47,500
Whoa!

1628
02:38:47,500 --> 02:38:49,500
I'm really happy we're still able to stream

1629
02:38:49,500 --> 02:38:51,500
despite everything that's going on.

1630
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:55,500
Hopefully we can return even a fraction of the joy you bring us.

1631
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:56,500
I'm so proud of my O.S.H.I.

1632
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:58,500
and all of her hard work.

1633
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:03,500
Oh, exude Doki!

1634
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:05,500
What the hell, bro?

1635
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:08,500
You literally dropped like 200 last stream, too.

1636
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:09,500
Thank you.

1637
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:11,500
You don't know how much that helps

1638
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:17,500
because I just spent a pretty penny on her at the vet office.

1639
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:19,500
It was expensive.

1640
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:21,500
It was literally...

1641
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:25,500
I always know that I'll be taking care of

1642
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:28,500
because literally the cost of the appointment was $300.

1643
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:30,500
I'm not even joking.

1644
02:39:30,500 --> 02:39:32,500
And you just gave that to me.

1645
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:34,500
So I appreciate you so much.

1646
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:37,500
You literally have no idea.

1647
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:39,500
Thank you so much.

1648
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:41,500
And everybody else who's donated this stream,

1649
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:42,500
I appreciate it.

1650
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:47,500
It really helps me pay Fia's bills and my own bills.

1651
02:39:47,500 --> 02:39:49,500
You guys know I do this as a full-time job.

1652
02:39:49,500 --> 02:39:50,500
So everything counts.

1653
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:53,500
I appreciate every time you guys decide to support me,

1654
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:57,500
whether it be through Patreon or through donations.

1655
02:39:57,500 --> 02:39:59,500
I always try to make it worth your while.

1656
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:02,500
So that's why I'm doing this today.

1657
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:04,500
And it's also just fun.

1658
02:40:04,500 --> 02:40:07,500
It's just fun.

1659
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:10,500
So I appreciate you guys.

1660
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:11,500
Thank you.

1661
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:13,500
Thank you so much.

1662
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:15,500
Doki was the vet confirmed.

1663
02:40:15,500 --> 02:40:18,500
And it was even sweet because the people at the vet,

1664
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:20,500
they know they've known Finia for a while.

1665
02:40:20,500 --> 02:40:22,500
And it was going to be more than that.

1666
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:24,500
It was going to be $600.

1667
02:40:24,500 --> 02:40:27,500
And they cut the price of it because they're just like,

1668
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:30,500
because one, they still don't know what's wrong with her.

1669
02:40:30,500 --> 02:40:33,500
Although they did, like I almost laughed in their face.

1670
02:40:33,500 --> 02:40:36,500
And they're like, yeah, we would need $3,000 for a muscle biopsy.

1671
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:39,500
It goes off to this fancy, like we have to put her anesthesia.

1672
02:40:39,500 --> 02:40:42,500
They have to like remove a part of her muscle.

1673
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:46,500
It has to be done when she's like this and she has to go under

1674
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:48,500
and it does a medical procedure.

1675
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:50,500
And then they send it out to a lab in California.

1676
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:52,500
So that's why it's so expensive.

1677
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:54,500
And then I get results in like two weeks.

1678
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:56,500
But I'm like, I don't know what the results are going to tell me.

1679
02:40:56,500 --> 02:40:58,500
They're probably going to tell me something I already know,

1680
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:01,500
which is that she has misthenia gravis.

1681
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:04,500
Like we know, I know it's like the doctor is so sure it's neuropathy.

1682
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:07,500
I'm just like, I don't, I might do that in the future.

1683
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:10,500
If it just becomes like a lethal thing.

1684
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:12,500
But thank you guys.

1685
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:14,500
Yeah, it was $3,000.

1686
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:16,500
It's like, bro, what?

1687
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:18,500
It could be.

1688
02:41:18,500 --> 02:41:20,500
Yeah, it's had the vet charger so much.

1689
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:22,500
Yeah.

1690
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:24,500
And then like sometimes insurance isn't really worth it too.

1691
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:28,500
Cause it's like, I've had Pat insurance before it costs like,

1692
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:32,500
it like ended up like being even when I paid the cost of the insurance.

1693
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:36,500
And then when I paid the stuff out of pocket.

1694
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:38,500
Oh hi, Elias.

1695
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:42,500
Oh my gosh. Hi.

1696
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:44,500
Elias, Elias.

1697
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:46,500
I can't read bro.

1698
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:48,500
Hi.

1699
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:52,500
Let me chuck a hot girl wrench your way.

1700
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,500
Oh my goodness.

1701
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:02,500
Hi.

1702
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:04,500
You want me to, you want me to hold on.

1703
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:08,500
I'm going to embarrass you real quick for a moment.

1704
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:14,500
I was a major creep in Elias's debut.

1705
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:20,500
Yeah, because I really liked that she did multiple voices like myself.

1706
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:24,500
We have a lot of common and we love doing ASMR role plays together.

1707
02:42:24,500 --> 02:42:32,500
And when I saw that she had like two little characters.

1708
02:42:32,500 --> 02:42:34,500
She had two little characters she did really sick voices for.

1709
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:37,500
I was like, she's my girl right there.

1710
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:41,500
She's my girl. I like her. She's the one.

1711
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:47,500
That's like creepy. That's nice.

1712
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:49,500
She's, yeah, she's a great voice actress.

1713
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:51,500
She's seriously great.

1714
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:53,500
Thank you. Thank you.

1715
02:42:53,500 --> 02:42:55,500
No, no, you're sweet.

1716
02:42:55,500 --> 02:43:03,500
And she just had a really cool event for her 50 K which was really fun to watch with her and Serena.

1717
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:05,500
Serena and her were hilarious.

1718
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:07,500
I was dying laughing.

1719
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:11,500
They were doing this whole bit where Elias,

1720
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,500
Elias, I can't fucking say it.

1721
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:21,500
Elias put Serena in a jar with the suspicious liquid and I'm like,

1722
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:25,500
I thought this was a say so company.

1723
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:27,500
I was wrong.

1724
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:31,500
Oh, my ASMRs are comfy and amazing.

1725
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:33,500
Thank you. Thank you, Elias.

1726
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:35,500
Yeah, no, I love role playing too.

1727
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:37,500
So I noticed that mean her a lot in common.

1728
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:39,500
So it's really cool.

1729
02:43:39,500 --> 02:43:41,500
Honestly, the entirety, I put her in a champagne.

1730
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:43,500
Yeah, it was champagne folks.

1731
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:47,500
It was champagne.

1732
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:55,500
But a lot of the girls that V for Mariah are so freaking talented and I'm happy.

1733
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:59,500
They get a lot of the support that they do.

1734
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:05,500
I'm so excited for the 3D debuts coming up for them.

1735
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:17,500
So make sure you guys check out Elias' channel and also check out the other V for Mariah girls because they are absolutely lovely and cool and nice.

1736
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:27,500
I followed them since their inception and I'm bummed that Abby Cadabra graduated but she went on to better things and I'm so proud of her.

1737
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:35,500
She brought something totally new to the VTubing sphere in my opinion and also really cool Brazilian representation so it was nice.

1738
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:37,500
You're so adorable. Thank you so much for your kind of support.

1739
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:41,500
You're so beautiful and amazing.

1740
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:45,500
Wait, I remember Elias says a thing.

1741
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:49,500
She has like a mannerism.

1742
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:51,500
I forget what it is.

1743
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:53,500
You know, I think it's that.

1744
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:55,500
Maybe I'll try to figure out if I can do Imitate.

1745
02:44:55,500 --> 02:45:05,500
I try to do impersonation so maybe I can do Elias' voice if I listen to her.

1746
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:07,500
She's my entry. Yeah.

1747
02:45:07,500 --> 02:45:11,500
They have really good girls there.

1748
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:15,500
Wait, I just realized I'm missing something on my head.

1749
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:17,500
Hold on.

1750
02:45:17,500 --> 02:45:19,500
Hold, sorry. Hold on. Hold on.

1751
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:21,500
Pardon.

1752
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:25,500
Pardon. Hello. Hello.

1753
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:27,500
Oh, there it is.

1754
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:29,500
Oh, there it is.

1755
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:31,500
Oh, there it is.

1756
02:45:31,500 --> 02:45:33,500
I didn't realize that.

1757
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:39,500
These are bound to like W, E and R and I've been using those to move.

1758
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:47,500
I don't have my catchphrase is don't get it twisted.

1759
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:49,500
Okay.

1760
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:55,500
You click them. Yeah, I realized that.

1761
02:45:55,500 --> 02:45:57,500
I want a cool verbal thing.

1762
02:45:57,500 --> 02:46:01,500
I can't say Dio though.

1763
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:05,500
Usually just say bro a lot.

1764
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:09,500
I'm a bro she.

1765
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:11,500
Okay.

1766
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:13,500
So I think we're good.

1767
02:46:13,500 --> 02:46:15,500
We got Fia big chilling.

1768
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:17,500
She even she even beeping.

1769
02:46:17,500 --> 02:46:21,500
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I make you itchy?

1770
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:23,500
Did I make you itchy?

1771
02:46:23,500 --> 02:46:25,500
Oh, let me scratch your ear for you.

1772
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:27,500
I got it. I got it.

1773
02:46:27,500 --> 02:46:29,500
Oh, good scratch.

1774
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:31,500
Oh, good scratch.

1775
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:33,500
She's like, I must lick my chest.

1776
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:35,500
Boomie.

1777
02:46:35,500 --> 02:46:37,500
Boomie did what?

1778
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:39,500
Boomie did what?

1779
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:41,500
Boomie did what?

1780
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:45,500
Boomie did what?

1781
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:49,500
Boomie?

1782
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:51,500
What did boomie do?

1783
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:53,500
I don't have my headphones on anymore.

1784
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:55,500
I'm putting them back on.

1785
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:57,500
So does the three hundred mean thirty zaps?

1786
02:46:57,500 --> 02:47:01,500
Do you want me to die?

1787
02:47:01,500 --> 02:47:03,500
Do you want me to be paralyzed?

1788
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:05,500
That's the question.

1789
02:47:05,500 --> 02:47:07,500
Small amount because I'm just a broke harlot,

1790
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:09,500
but hope it helps.

1791
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:11,500
Oh, sweetie. Oh, anonymous.

1792
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:13,500
Don't feel like pressured because of my situation

1793
02:47:13,500 --> 02:47:18,100
that you feel like you need to help. I appreciate it though that you are taking

1794
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:23,100
your harder and money and giving it to me. That is very, very sweet of you. I

1795
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:30,220
appreciate you a lot. Let me quote the Bible for you real quick. Jesus told of

1796
02:47:30,220 --> 02:47:38,940
a parable of a widow with two small coins and he was explaining to his

1797
02:47:38,940 --> 02:47:46,620
disciples that there's this rich man boasting and telling how much he

1798
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:52,420
gave to, you know, the congregation and then there's this little old lady that

1799
02:47:52,420 --> 02:47:58,540
came along and gave two small coins and Jesus always, Jesus asks, so disciples,

1800
02:47:58,540 --> 02:48:02,740
which do you think was of more value? The rich man giving away his riches or the

1801
02:48:02,740 --> 02:48:07,460
woman who gave her last two small coins and it was that woman. So I appreciate

1802
02:48:07,460 --> 02:48:14,900
you. You guys think I don't, that I'm lying about having been raised religious.

1803
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:28,060
Sick parable girl. You do that one like, I do. Do I do that? What are my

1804
02:48:28,060 --> 02:48:35,300
verbal tics guys? Hey those are some good stories. Just the church is, well, you know.

1805
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:42,060
What about the Stanley parable? You know, Jesus once told of this story about this

1806
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:46,860
man who lived a very mundane life into the same tasks over and over and over

1807
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:52,660
again and it wasn't until he broke out of his box and discovered that he could

1808
02:48:52,660 --> 02:48:59,500
control the world on his terms did he realize who he truly was and that's how,

1809
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:09,020
and that's an example we should all follow. Amen. Shibi Kambam chapter 10

1810
02:49:09,020 --> 02:49:14,340
verses 31 through 42. Thank you. Well, you tend to do various voiceovers.

1811
02:49:14,340 --> 02:49:20,700
Your choir is no thoughtful. Yeah, this one's one of my favorites. My favorite

1812
02:49:20,700 --> 02:49:24,860
parables when Jesus breaks the bread. Yeah, I remember that always, I would

1813
02:49:24,860 --> 02:49:28,980
always like badger my mom about that when like the loaves and fishes. I'm like,

1814
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:33,540
but how did he feed all those people? And my mom's like, through the power of

1815
02:49:33,540 --> 02:49:37,980
spirit, I'm like, but there's only like two loaves and three fish. How did he

1816
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:42,660
feed a multitude of people? With the Holy Spirit, mother fucker.

1817
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:44,980
Pretty Shibi is you.

1818
02:49:53,180 --> 02:49:55,860
Oh, what? I'm just into Findo.

1819
02:49:55,860 --> 02:49:59,860
I'm just into Findo. Oh, I just got like a cramp.

1820
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:07,380
Crack my back. All right. Let me shock myself.

1821
02:50:17,780 --> 02:50:21,220
Okay, I feel like that was a lot stronger than before.

1822
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:28,500
What the hell? That was so weird. It was never that strong. And I didn't change the

1823
02:50:29,940 --> 02:50:35,220
change the setting. I almost pissed myself. Jesus. I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

1824
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:39,460
So Doki, you donated 300. What would you like me to do?

1825
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:55,220
Pissing by yourself, madam.

1826
02:50:59,380 --> 02:51:00,980
Whip him. I do have my whip.

1827
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:05,220
We're waiting.

1828
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:11,540
Doki dropped a three hundo, but I don't think I can shock myself 30 times because

1829
02:51:11,540 --> 02:51:17,460
that's just not safe. Show hands. Are you Doki? No.

1830
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:21,940
Imagine Doki was Doki bird this entire time. That'd be sick.

1831
02:51:24,820 --> 02:51:26,100
I think you die. Probably.

1832
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,260
That's not safe for work.

1833
02:51:36,580 --> 02:51:42,020
I can wait. The bell dismisses you. I mean, I dismiss you, not the bell.

1834
02:51:43,620 --> 02:51:45,220
The bell doesn't dismiss you. I do.

1835
02:51:47,780 --> 02:51:52,420
Just a little shock. Just a little shock. You just want a little shock and 30.

1836
02:51:52,420 --> 02:51:59,220
You guys can't add on to what they said. You're like, oh, so you need to do a shock

1837
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:04,740
and then 30 jumping jacks. And then I also need you to do 30 push ups.

1838
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:10,820
Oh, thank you. Wait, I thought your name was Mr. Pizza, but it's R&R Pizza.

1839
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:13,940
I bet you tried to make it look like it was Mr. Pizza, which is very smart of you.

1840
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:20,100
Thank you for the 10 super. Oh, Fia giving you a little little wiggle and excitement.

1841
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:26,740
What's up, ma'am? Do you need a piss, girl? Do you need a piss? Do you need a piss, girl?

1842
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:29,540
Do you need a piss? Do you need a piss, girl?

1843
02:52:33,060 --> 02:52:38,100
Fia, why do you look so cute? Oh, you're a little trench scratchy. Oh, they were a little trench

1844
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:45,700
scratchy. Okay, let me shock myself. Okay, that one wasn't that bad. Let me do it again.

1845
02:52:47,060 --> 02:52:47,940
It was a little tickle.

1846
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:55,860
It's like, it's weird. It's like inconsistent. Like it'll be like one super strong, one super

1847
02:52:55,860 --> 02:53:00,740
light for no reason. And then one that one did barely did anything with the hail.

1848
02:53:09,300 --> 02:53:09,780
I'm okay.

1849
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:22,340
And then what was the other thing? Can you spit on you? Okay. Yeah, sure.

1850
02:53:22,580 --> 02:53:29,700
Low charge? No, it actually went up in charge. It was at 42%. Now it's at 48%.

1851
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:34,100
What? What?

1852
02:53:36,900 --> 02:53:38,260
Hi, everybody. Hello.

1853
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:43,780
Let the bodies hit the floor. Okay, so I need to spit. Let me get some.

1854
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:53,140
Okay.

1855
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:17,780
Oh, yeah.

1856
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:42,100
Oh, Fia, I'm so sorry. I must be so noisy to you. She, like, looks at me like, please.

1857
02:54:42,580 --> 02:54:45,940
This is one weird jerk, servants. Okay.

1858
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:57,940
Make me sweat, make me harder, make me lose my breath, make me harder.

1859
02:54:57,940 --> 02:55:13,300
I'mma be, I can't see, not more dis. Oh, let me put my headphones back in. Are you ready?

1860
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:16,420
Are you guys ready? Oh, I let me move myself out the way so you guys can see the game.

1861
02:55:17,060 --> 02:55:29,300
No, I didn't mean to switch to ASMR.

1862
02:55:31,940 --> 02:55:38,500
Well, I'm not doing ASMR, but I'm here now. Please hold.

1863
02:55:46,660 --> 02:55:47,220
All right.

1864
02:55:57,700 --> 02:56:01,380
Thanks for the hallelujah and spit. Oh, time to shock.

1865
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:08,500
Wait, did that work? I realize I think there's like another part of it that shocks you,

1866
02:56:08,500 --> 02:56:10,580
and if that doesn't touch my neck, it doesn't work.

1867
02:56:17,380 --> 02:56:17,860
Oh.

1868
02:56:32,420 --> 02:56:36,180
Are you guys crying? What the fuck is going on?

1869
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:45,300
It says, yeah, I noticed it's the rivets that shock, not the actual front of the collar.

1870
02:56:46,980 --> 02:56:53,780
I see it's not tight enough. He says as he plunges into her back door. Sorry.

1871
02:56:59,700 --> 02:57:03,060
Oh, oh, so I was thinking, by the way, random thought.

1872
02:57:05,380 --> 02:57:10,740
So I was going to redo the, sorry, I'm looking down because I'm trying to untangle my headphones.

1873
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:17,700
Hi, Pia. What's up? I can hear you trying to purr. When she's like this, she can't purr,

1874
02:57:17,700 --> 02:57:19,380
which sucks, so she just breathes funny.

1875
02:57:27,460 --> 02:57:32,500
But I was thinking, we have a cat cam. Yeah, you do, bro.

1876
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:42,100
So you guys know we're getting like Halloween outfits. I think I'm going to change my scripts

1877
02:57:42,100 --> 02:57:51,940
for October to match my Halloween outfit. You guys don't know what it is. Black and yellow,

1878
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:58,420
black and yellow. Anyone worried about Madam, the collar? She has specific pink flesh shocks

1879
02:57:58,420 --> 02:58:02,900
are well within this name. Oh, yeah. See, thank you, Maureen. So you guys don't have to worry,

1880
02:58:02,900 --> 02:58:13,460
I'm not dying. Glamis chase away every time I chase. You know, it's really nice to see. I've seen

1881
02:58:13,460 --> 02:58:21,540
a lot of pen pals and snowberries and bleeding hearts and snippets and reeflings in my chat.

1882
02:58:21,780 --> 02:58:30,660
Sorry, that was my ice maker. If you guys heard that. This person's like, don't tell me. No,

1883
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:33,620
you guys are fine. You know, we don't care, right? You're like, we actually don't care.

1884
02:58:35,700 --> 02:58:40,980
But I appreciate and dislike people who are from other companies who have Oshie marks. I thank you

1885
02:58:41,860 --> 02:58:47,860
for watching me. I appreciate you. Thank you for giving. I know sometimes

1886
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:55,140
people kind of like stick to one person. So thank you for occasionally watching me too. I think

1887
02:58:55,140 --> 02:59:00,180
that's pretty neat of you. I'm happy that I can appeal to you when your Oshie isn't around.

1888
02:59:02,580 --> 02:59:08,740
I'm your side Oshie. Oink. That was not a wink. I just blinked with two eyes. Don't worry about it.

1889
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:17,700
Morty's. I'm a tried and chewed degenerate as you should be. Okay, let me not touch this.

1890
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:28,820
Veal our unity. Veal our love. Okay, remember, shock on death. Oh, my cat's food is going off.

1891
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:33,700
My cat's food is going off, ladies and gentlemen. It's fine. We're killing this bitch.

1892
02:59:34,980 --> 02:59:40,580
Fuck. I'm shocked myself. Okay, I need to turn that down.

1893
02:59:42,260 --> 02:59:46,340
We're turning it down. We're turning it down. I just had a really weird deja vu.

1894
02:59:47,060 --> 02:59:51,220
Okay, hold on. Let me feed Veal. I like how I started, died, and I have to feed my cat.

1895
02:59:53,700 --> 02:59:57,620
Hi. Oh, you ready for some lunchies? You ready for some lunchies?

1896
02:59:57,620 --> 03:00:03,940
Oh, yeah, I know you just ate, but I'm going to try to see if you'll eat again.

1897
03:00:06,740 --> 03:00:07,940
It's ordering water.

1898
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:38,260
Let me just... Hi, little girl. She's a very cute girl. I'm using my Tamagotchi box as a stand for her to eat on.

1899
03:00:41,780 --> 03:00:48,260
Ma'am, do you need to sit up? She might squeak again. She's not in pain.

1900
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:55,220
She just is vocal when I move her. Okay, guys? Yeah, I know. I know.

1901
03:00:57,940 --> 03:00:59,940
Yeah. Here you go.

1902
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:10,100
What do you feel? I want to eat. I want to eat. I want to eat. I want to eat.

1903
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:20,420
My Tamagotchi... No, somebody just got me a Tamagotchi.

1904
03:01:28,420 --> 03:01:32,260
I can't floss. I forgot how to do it.

1905
03:01:43,940 --> 03:01:49,700
I'm booming in the background. Shitty. Shibby hit the gritty. I don't know how to do the gritty.

1906
03:01:49,700 --> 03:01:52,260
Boomi, it's water. You don't need to be a part of it.

1907
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:59,780
She died eight times. It's possible that sometimes a little game.

1908
03:02:01,460 --> 03:02:04,980
Siamese cats. I already know for being vocal. Sorry, she's speaking.

1909
03:02:04,980 --> 03:02:11,140
Actually, Fia doesn't really talk a lot. That's why I'm just like, I like warm people.

1910
03:02:11,140 --> 03:02:15,700
Boomi is the most vocal. Actually, well, Rain was pretty vocal, but Rain is a pure Siamese cat.

1911
03:02:15,700 --> 03:02:21,940
Boomi and Fia are part Siamese cat. Boomi is a Lynx point, and so is Fia, which is a Lynx lilac point.

1912
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:29,380
So, her mom must have been like a lilac point Siamese, and then her dad was probably a Tabby cat or something.

1913
03:02:31,700 --> 03:02:39,620
Shibby, why the way hit the gritty when you're gritty? Gritty, we hit the gritty. We hit the gritty.

1914
03:02:44,740 --> 03:02:50,020
It's special water, Boomi. She's lying to you. He just has to like drink it, and then usually

1915
03:02:50,020 --> 03:02:53,780
when she's done, she'll tuck her head to the side, and she'll stick her face to the side.

1916
03:02:54,500 --> 03:02:59,700
So, I think she's telling me that she's done with it. Are you done? Are you done, ma'am?

1917
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:12,340
Are you done? Are you done? Hi, Boomi. Okay, let me take that from you. Good Sippys. Good Sippys.

1918
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:21,220
Now, my ankle. And you get more wet food. I'm gonna do that tomorrow, put you this time on my last hand.

1919
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:30,980
And honestly, I should have just saved it all for Fia, but Boomi can be very aggressive. Not aggressive like me, but like you just, I mean like the ball, he'll just go after the food.

1920
03:03:30,980 --> 03:03:35,540
He's very food driven, like a freaking dog. Where do I put the food bowl? I just had it.

1921
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:40,900
Boomi, did you take the food bowl? Boomi, I don't trust you.

1922
03:03:42,980 --> 03:03:45,940
Boomi, what did you? You stole something again. Didn't you?

1923
03:03:47,460 --> 03:03:55,940
Bitch. Yeah, excuse me. Excuse me, handsome boy. I'm trying to find what happened to the bowl,

1924
03:03:56,980 --> 03:04:00,740
that I used for Fia's food. Oh yeah, that's right. I put it over here.

1925
03:04:00,740 --> 03:04:06,420
Okay, I'm gonna soften the slope.

1926
03:04:10,820 --> 03:04:19,700
With a little bit of water and a little bit of chew. So in types of caspias, usually like like food that's been like wedded for her.

1927
03:04:31,700 --> 03:04:36,340
Oh, my song's back in my head.

1928
03:04:52,340 --> 03:04:56,740
I need to go to the pet stole. I'll take you to the pet shop.

1929
03:04:57,460 --> 03:05:04,420
Beep, beep, beep. My pants keep falling down. Beep, beep, beep. Excuse me. Hi.

1930
03:05:10,340 --> 03:05:14,820
Boomi. Oh, because you just accidentally made me flop you in the face.

1931
03:05:18,420 --> 03:05:22,740
Get a little tighter to eat some. Here, you want this? Here, Boomi.

1932
03:05:26,980 --> 03:05:31,620
Boomi is requiring. No, wait, hold on. I want to see if I can

1933
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:35,780
come down here so people can see.

1934
03:05:38,740 --> 03:05:39,940
I'm pouring on my cats.

1935
03:05:48,740 --> 03:05:53,540
I'll show you where to a two-party, a t-shirt. Boomi, don't chew on it. Just let me,

1936
03:05:54,180 --> 03:05:59,940
you don't even deserve treats right now. I don't know why I'm giving this to you. I should have just given it all to Fia.

1937
03:06:07,220 --> 03:06:12,420
Leave it. Don't you dare go for it, Boomi. Here, come here.

1938
03:06:15,620 --> 03:06:22,340
Come here. Boomi, hey. Bro, get your booty cheeks over here.

1939
03:06:23,700 --> 03:06:24,340
That's what I thought.

1940
03:06:28,420 --> 03:06:29,540
Wait, we'll just pick you up.

1941
03:06:40,420 --> 03:06:41,780
Hey, you can have some of these drops.

1942
03:06:44,740 --> 03:06:45,460
Hi, Nino.

1943
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:48,340
My flashlight and the camera and my pants are falling down.

1944
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:59,460
Did anybody see? No. Hey, ma'am, are you going to eat? Come on, you can do it.

1945
03:07:04,100 --> 03:07:04,660
Change, ma'am.

1946
03:07:10,820 --> 03:07:14,660
Why? She's like, I only wanted the chew-droom.

1947
03:07:19,300 --> 03:07:28,340
You and the cat is also a mom here. Leave, Boomi alone. Are you guys to fend?

1948
03:07:29,220 --> 03:07:38,260
He's stealing his sick, paralyzed sister's food and you guys are saying stop being mean to Boomi?

1949
03:07:39,780 --> 03:07:44,820
Have you seen this beautiful girl and he's taking her food?

1950
03:07:45,140 --> 03:07:48,100
He has done nothing wrong.

1951
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:54,180
Watch. Okay, watch him. I'm going to be right back. Can you guys watch my cats? I'll be right back.

1952
03:08:06,340 --> 03:08:09,700
Oh, now you want to come over because you're wondering what I'm doing with Reina?

1953
03:08:09,700 --> 03:08:11,620
Because you always have to be a part of things, Boomi.

1954
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:17,620
Boomi actually follows me around the house. It's quite adorable.

1955
03:08:17,620 --> 03:08:20,740
Even if he's, like, dead of sleep and he hears me get up, he will get up and move.

1956
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:25,300
Okay, Sofia, it looks like you're done with this. I'll give this to you later.

1957
03:08:25,300 --> 03:08:28,820
Fine, Boomi. Do you want this? You want this? It seems like you want this.

1958
03:08:28,820 --> 03:08:30,740
Although, there's food right there. What's your new goal?

1959
03:08:32,580 --> 03:08:33,060
Dinkus.

1960
03:08:40,260 --> 03:08:41,060
Look at that lady.

1961
03:08:41,620 --> 03:08:49,060
Ah, girl, look at that body. So, by the way, I will be doing this in a stream soon.

1962
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:51,620
I can't remember if I did it for a member stream or a...

1963
03:08:52,660 --> 03:08:53,620
I think I did it for a member.

1964
03:08:55,060 --> 03:08:57,860
I can't remember. I can't remember if it's a member.

1965
03:08:58,820 --> 03:09:00,020
Member. Member?

1966
03:09:01,700 --> 03:09:05,460
He wants her food. She might be the leader of the pack.

1967
03:09:05,780 --> 03:09:11,060
Wait, what? How high did my heart rate go?

1968
03:09:12,580 --> 03:09:14,740
For what? It's because I'm talking and running around.

1969
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:19,620
Apologize to Boomi. I'm gonna ban your ass.

1970
03:09:22,740 --> 03:09:27,220
Sounds like you're the villain here, Sheebie. What rules of nature?

1971
03:09:27,220 --> 03:09:39,700
Oh, my God. You guys are enabling my son who is steals.

1972
03:09:41,460 --> 03:09:47,460
He's a thief. He'll attack her when she's like this, mind you.

1973
03:09:48,660 --> 03:09:52,980
He'll attack her. Actually, Thea, I'm gonna flip you so you're more comfortable.

1974
03:09:57,700 --> 03:10:00,020
Here you go. Fine. Did you want to be like that?

1975
03:10:03,540 --> 03:10:08,500
She's like, I want to lean. Lean with it, Rock with it. Lean with it, Rock with it.

1976
03:10:11,940 --> 03:10:14,100
She looks so angry on the camera.

1977
03:10:15,540 --> 03:10:18,820
Demonic. Oh, yeah. This was the slime, by the way.

1978
03:10:18,820 --> 03:10:21,540
I want to do like a slime fun so I can get more slime.

1979
03:10:21,540 --> 03:10:23,540
This was slime that I did for your ears.

1980
03:10:30,820 --> 03:10:36,020
Yeah. Raina has been, yeah, she's actually been chilling. She's been walking around.

1981
03:10:36,020 --> 03:10:42,180
She's actually been on my couch right next to me because my couch is right next to my desk.

1982
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:46,100
And so she's just chilling there. She also followed me into the bathroom when I was like,

1983
03:10:46,100 --> 03:10:48,980
Raina, come with me. We're gonna go talk shit about Boomi.

1984
03:10:52,500 --> 03:10:56,500
Goopiest ears known, does she have goopy ears? Yeah, do you have goopy ears?

1985
03:10:57,860 --> 03:10:59,300
Yeah, goopy ears. What are you talking about?

1986
03:11:01,140 --> 03:11:07,380
Boomi makes sure her ears are clean. Sorry. Okay, someone, okay, let me do 10.

1987
03:11:07,380 --> 03:11:23,940
Ah, okay. This is a cloud slime. Here, I'll show you.

1988
03:11:23,940 --> 03:11:34,500
Eat the cloud slime. Sorry, I fuck up your ear for you.

1989
03:11:36,020 --> 03:11:40,020
She's like, I can't scratch it. Eat the cloud slime.

1990
03:11:44,740 --> 03:11:50,340
Your ear okay? Let me scratch your ear for you. Let me wipe my hand off of it. It smells like,

1991
03:11:50,580 --> 03:11:54,420
um, straw, it smells like strawberry milk.

1992
03:11:58,100 --> 03:12:02,100
Look, it's a fucking beauty tutorial. Is your ear good?

1993
03:12:02,820 --> 03:12:22,500
Hi, Boomi. Is this the menace you guys ordered? His paws is coming. I'm scared he's gonna knock

1994
03:12:22,500 --> 03:12:26,980
over the camera. I'm covering my face in anticipation. He's sniffing her ears.

1995
03:12:27,300 --> 03:12:34,500
Funs for Boomi's lawyer for all the slander. Oh my god, you guys are terrible.

1996
03:12:36,740 --> 03:12:41,780
Boomi, can you get off my desk? Boomi, please. Boomi, please, don't sit on my keyboard. Boomi.

1997
03:12:42,740 --> 03:12:51,060
Boomi, please. Boomi. You smell like fish. You smell stinky. Can you leave?

1998
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:57,540
Big man. Big man, can you move? Lily's sitting on my keyboard.

1999
03:12:59,700 --> 03:13:04,980
Hi, Yemi. It's Jimmy. All right.

2000
03:13:15,220 --> 03:13:17,940
Oh my god. My favorite little sister is here.

2001
03:13:18,500 --> 03:13:26,260
Am I gonna keep streaming? Uh, yes. Oh my god. What time is it? Oh my god,

2002
03:13:26,260 --> 03:13:30,340
don't even three hours? Jesus Christ. I don't know if you guys heard Raina just

2003
03:13:30,340 --> 03:13:35,860
hiss at Boomi. Raina knows what's up. Raina knows what's up. She knows. She knows how we do.

2004
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:58,340
Oh yeah, by the way, thank you for the woofer. I said I wanted a stuffy of a woofer and a

2005
03:13:58,340 --> 03:14:02,740
Pokemon smasher pass and then literally got a surprise gift from Throne and somebody bought

2006
03:14:02,740 --> 03:14:10,740
me a woofer and he's just a little guy. He's just a little guy. Right, Fia? He's just a little guy.

2007
03:14:12,900 --> 03:14:13,860
So he's on my desk.

2008
03:14:18,340 --> 03:14:21,620
Didn't hear it. Circumstantial evidence. Boomi's still innocent.

2009
03:14:23,380 --> 03:14:28,580
Yeah, the woofer's cute. He's on my desk next to the bunny. Oh, let me show you. Hold on.

2010
03:14:29,140 --> 03:14:34,980
Somebody also, wait, I can try to find... I don't know what I did with the... Hi, Raina.

2011
03:14:40,980 --> 03:14:44,900
Squeak ladder for everyone to use. Oh, Boomi, where the hell did you come from?

2012
03:14:45,460 --> 03:14:48,580
I accidentally just bonked him in the head because I left my cabinet open.

2013
03:14:53,380 --> 03:14:58,260
Where is it? Where is it? Did you take it, Mr? I feel like you took it.

2014
03:14:58,900 --> 03:15:07,140
Um, what was that? What was that? What are you cooing about? Oh, here it is.

2015
03:15:09,620 --> 03:15:16,100
Hold on, I got you. So somebody got... So somebody got...

2016
03:15:16,100 --> 03:15:26,900
Um, pieces to make a hero member.

2017
03:15:34,340 --> 03:15:41,460
So I don't know if you guys can really see, but it's fine. So they got a bunny. He looks a little

2018
03:15:41,460 --> 03:15:52,180
scary, but it's fine. He's a little bunny. And Amy Raid. Hi. Hi, Momosa. And so I got him a little...

2019
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:59,220
Somebody got him a little bow tie. I'm dressing up hair. I'm right now. Hi.

2020
03:16:00,820 --> 03:16:04,340
And so now he has a bow tie. I also put it on Boomi at one point.

2021
03:16:04,820 --> 03:16:14,820
And they also... His... Oh, his ears are stuck. This is actually hard to put on him.

2022
03:16:20,820 --> 03:16:28,420
The hero backpack indeed. So, uh, except you can't use the, like, straps because of the bow tie.

2023
03:16:29,140 --> 03:16:35,780
Um, so yeah, he has a little bow tie. It's quite cute. Very nice. Very dapper.

2024
03:16:36,580 --> 03:16:39,140
Um, and then they also got him a fedora.

2025
03:16:41,220 --> 03:16:48,500
So, and he's just been chilling on my couch. So, um, yeah.

2026
03:16:51,540 --> 03:16:54,340
So he sits next to me on the couch and I watch TV.

2027
03:16:55,300 --> 03:17:00,740
I can just question between my thighs. Get down there here. Okay. Um,

2028
03:17:02,740 --> 03:17:07,620
not the mullady. Oh, but Phi is doing okay. I just gave her... She's like, what the fuck?

2029
03:17:08,660 --> 03:17:14,420
She's like a, like, uh, what's it called? Um, office. Look at the camera moment there.

2030
03:17:15,140 --> 03:17:23,700
Uh, she is doing okay. I just gave her her food and her water. Um, she's still, uh,

2031
03:17:24,900 --> 03:17:28,580
it's gonna take her a while to go back to normal. It'll probably take her like two weeks,

2032
03:17:28,580 --> 03:17:31,380
maybe three weeks. So we'll see.

2033
03:17:34,820 --> 03:17:38,340
What if Phi was evil and fucked up? Phi is the sweetest cat.

2034
03:17:39,460 --> 03:17:42,900
You guys don't even know. Phi is literally the sweetest cat.

2035
03:17:42,900 --> 03:17:47,780
She loves to kiss you. She loves to make air biscuits. She loves to give you,

2036
03:17:47,780 --> 03:17:52,740
like, she loves her belly pet. She's the sweet... I've had many cats and I've grown up with around

2037
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:59,860
many cats from my family, friends. She is one of the sweetest cats I've ever met in my life.

2038
03:17:59,860 --> 03:18:05,860
And that's why she doesn't deserve any of this. Not that any animal deserves it, but you know,

2039
03:18:05,860 --> 03:18:11,300
you know what I mean. You gave him a bombastic side eye.

2040
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:21,780
So what's wrong with my fellow heart? Because Boomi keeps taking Phi's food

2041
03:18:21,780 --> 03:18:25,780
and I've been yelling and scolding Boomi and people are like, Duff and Boomi, Boomi.

2042
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:31,860
Justice for Boomi. Boomi's a menace. She keeps hearing me say his name and he's like walking

2043
03:18:31,860 --> 03:18:38,260
over like, what? Sorry, Phi has pills on my desk. So you adopt her? Yeah, I rescued

2044
03:18:38,980 --> 03:18:44,900
Phiia from... You're really using the bathroom right now, bro. Boomi's really just pissing behind me.

2045
03:18:47,540 --> 03:18:51,540
I rescued Boomi and Phiia within a month of each other. They're not from the same litter,

2046
03:18:51,540 --> 03:18:58,980
actually. Boomi's a month older than Phiia, but they're the same type of cat. So both Siamese

2047
03:18:58,980 --> 03:19:07,060
mixes. And Reina, my mom got her from a breeder. And Reina is 14 years old. She's an old lady.

2048
03:19:07,780 --> 03:19:14,260
She's the purebred Siamese and she's a blue point. But yeah, is your Boomi creature named after

2049
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:20,820
Earthbender? Yes. Boomi King of Umashu. You have Phiia, the deathbed companion. Yes, I know her

2050
03:19:20,820 --> 03:19:27,860
name is ironic given that she is paralyzed, the majority. She's fine though. She's good. And then

2051
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:34,900
Reina is just Reina. Boomi probably has broken the Geneva... Oh, Boomi has broken the Geneva

2052
03:19:34,900 --> 03:19:42,340
convention. Honestly, like I'm the type of person who makes jokes just so I don't ball my eyes out.

2053
03:19:42,340 --> 03:19:50,660
So I like sometimes I'll just sing to her and I'll just be like, when your legs don't work like

2054
03:19:50,660 --> 03:20:00,340
they used to before. She doesn't know. You guys know I try my hardest with her too. I'll just

2055
03:20:00,340 --> 03:20:07,780
lift that up a bit. Yeah, but I'll laugh and cry. Am I right? You got the wooper in the background.

2056
03:20:08,180 --> 03:20:21,700
And so yeah, Phiia is a good girl. Phiia deserves a world, but she's going to get better. She has

2057
03:20:21,700 --> 03:20:28,500
a weird disease where like her body decides just not to work anymore. It's like the doctor says

2058
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:35,380
she like runs out of gas a lot faster than humans. But it just seemed like it was worse.

2059
03:20:36,180 --> 03:20:43,140
Worse is not a word. More worse this time. So I'm wondering why that is. So I hope that it's

2060
03:20:43,140 --> 03:20:49,300
something that doesn't take longer for her to heal and that if this happens again, I don't want it

2061
03:20:49,300 --> 03:20:54,580
to be worse again. We have to wait and see because she was a rescue. I don't know anything about her

2062
03:20:54,580 --> 03:21:01,300
genetic history. So it's really weird. I don't know if you guys just started being... Can you guys stop

2063
03:21:01,300 --> 03:21:07,540
fighting? I'm gonna burp back to you in anger. Stop. Bumi, leave her alone.

2064
03:21:10,660 --> 03:21:14,420
Bumi, she's literally growling at you. She does not want to spend time with you right now.

2065
03:21:17,460 --> 03:21:18,020
Oh my god.

2066
03:21:24,340 --> 03:21:25,380
Burp of authority.

2067
03:21:25,700 --> 03:21:32,740
Fia doing the stinky leg? Oh my god.

2068
03:21:37,380 --> 03:21:42,340
Hi, Rina. What's up? Where have you been? Where you been, Loka?

2069
03:21:44,100 --> 03:21:47,460
Have you been sleeping under the bed? They like to sleep under the bed.

2070
03:21:48,180 --> 03:21:51,460
Rina, why do you have to come from this side to hop up on my lap? Because I know that's where

2071
03:21:51,460 --> 03:21:55,380
you're going right now. Hold on, let me put my blanket down so you don't scratch up my legs

2072
03:21:55,380 --> 03:22:03,380
because I'm wearing shorts. Okay, I'm ready for you big mama. Hey mama. Are you gonna come jump

2073
03:22:03,380 --> 03:22:12,340
up here or are you just gonna walk around me? Hi, I'm Carl. Okay, she's just gonna stare at me,

2074
03:22:12,340 --> 03:22:20,100
so I'm gonna continue playing. I appreciate the random Spanish anytime. Anytime.

2075
03:22:22,340 --> 03:22:27,940
Fia needs a bodyguard. Yeah, her bodyguard is Rina. When Rina was really sick,

2076
03:22:29,060 --> 03:22:33,620
like a couple of weeks ago, Fia was by her side and I was like, Fia, you better not be

2077
03:22:33,620 --> 03:22:36,660
her death bed companion or I'll be very pissed off. But you know how it is. Oh,

2078
03:22:37,540 --> 03:22:41,780
now as I put my headphones on, you want to go on my lap, Rina? Nice. We have been joined.

2079
03:22:42,420 --> 03:22:53,780
By Rina. Oh my god. Stay. Stay. Stay. Can you please?

2080
03:22:58,580 --> 03:23:06,100
The man, the woman, the myth, the legend, Rina. Wait, hold on.

2081
03:23:06,660 --> 03:23:16,660
The man, the myth, the legend, Rina. And she's climbing onto my head, ma'am. I can't.

2082
03:23:17,860 --> 03:23:26,340
I can't hold you like this. Rina. Rina, I can't hold you like this. You're on my headphone wire.

2083
03:23:28,580 --> 03:23:30,340
So you guys see what I have to deal with?

2084
03:23:30,340 --> 03:23:37,860
I have to deal with three unruly children and one of them is out paralyzed. She just like

2085
03:23:37,860 --> 03:23:45,700
pushed off. Scratch my leg. I'm sorry, Rina, but she was like, she sits on my headphone wire.

2086
03:23:45,700 --> 03:23:53,460
Like, oh my god. Back to Fia. Hurting cats, literally.

2087
03:23:53,620 --> 03:24:00,340
Rina, please. Rina, why? Rina, why have you betrayed? No, she'll be back in like five minutes.

2088
03:24:00,340 --> 03:24:02,580
She's behind me right now. She's just staring down, Bumi.

2089
03:24:13,940 --> 03:24:16,580
Wait, there should be a way that I can actually like sample something.

2090
03:24:23,780 --> 03:24:24,580
Do. Do.

2091
03:24:27,380 --> 03:24:27,940
Is it gonna work?

2092
03:24:32,500 --> 03:24:35,540
I don't know how it works. I don't know how to sample something and play it.

2093
03:24:36,740 --> 03:24:40,340
She told me her name was Benji when she crossed the scene.

2094
03:24:44,980 --> 03:24:46,980
Gonna be relentless while we're moving her neck.

2095
03:24:47,300 --> 03:24:53,220
They're going to grow up into great cats. Oh yeah.

2096
03:25:03,780 --> 03:25:05,060
I don't remember the lyrics, to be honest.

2097
03:25:05,780 --> 03:25:14,420
Whoa. What the hell?

2098
03:25:15,380 --> 03:25:21,940
Jason Derulo. Jason Derulo.

2099
03:25:22,900 --> 03:25:26,340
T-Pain. Get money.

2100
03:25:30,180 --> 03:25:37,220
If you want to be no other, you gotta get with my friends.

2101
03:25:37,220 --> 03:25:44,500
Make them last forever. That's up to the end.

2102
03:25:46,740 --> 03:25:54,500
She said I am a one, but the kid is not my son.

2103
03:26:02,500 --> 03:26:04,900
So tell me what you want. What do you really, really want?

2104
03:26:07,540 --> 03:26:10,900
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to.

2105
03:26:13,460 --> 03:26:17,620
If you want to be my lover, you gotta get with my friends.

2106
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:28,740
She's just a girl who says that I am the one, but the kid is not my son.

2107
03:26:29,620 --> 03:26:33,700
And I suspected the game stream trying to do you. I'm sorry.

2108
03:26:34,100 --> 03:26:38,100
Oh wait, hold on, hold on, I got you, I got you.

2109
03:26:40,420 --> 03:26:42,580
Because I'm a nun, so I naturally have to sing this.

2110
03:26:42,580 --> 03:26:51,460
The hills are alive with the sound of music.

2111
03:27:12,900 --> 03:27:21,540
How do y'all get the emotes? You freaking pay for them, bro. What do you think?

2112
03:27:21,540 --> 03:27:25,780
They upgraded to the emotes here. Are you new here or something?

2113
03:27:25,780 --> 03:27:31,940
What's up, new friend? Come on, sign up for my subscription and be my, um,

2114
03:27:33,700 --> 03:27:38,260
hair member in my heartlet. I'll take good care of you. I'll give you a kiss.

2115
03:27:39,220 --> 03:27:44,740
So subscribe to, well, member today. Ready? Are you, if you do it, I'll kiss you.

2116
03:27:46,340 --> 03:27:52,340
You sound like a 2011 anime VI? VI? I'm a 2011 American...

2117
03:27:59,380 --> 03:28:02,420
No wonder I feel like so tired. Fuck you.

2118
03:28:03,140 --> 03:28:12,580
You won't regret it. Thank you, boy, for the one gifted. Imagine it went to that person.

2119
03:28:20,660 --> 03:28:24,260
I'm trying to like, I'm trying to hold a note but then think of a song to lean into,

2120
03:28:24,260 --> 03:28:25,460
but then I can't think of a song.

2121
03:28:25,460 --> 03:28:37,860
What was I listening to today? I was listening to, I was listening to Baby No Money,

2122
03:28:38,580 --> 03:28:43,780
the song It Boy. I was like, this actually slaps. Holy crap. And then right after that,

2123
03:28:43,780 --> 03:28:49,620
I listened to her by Megan Thee Stallion. I'm like, this used to be a remix.

2124
03:28:49,620 --> 03:28:56,260
I need to mash up the song. Whoa. Whoa. Why did the, why did the pitch go up? You get a kiss.

2125
03:29:02,340 --> 03:29:10,420
Thank you, next. Thank you, next. I'm so fucking grateful for my harem.

2126
03:29:19,940 --> 03:29:29,780
How do you feel about the Gen Z Eminem? I always, I thought that was a good line in the thing.

2127
03:29:30,740 --> 03:29:35,300
I actually don't really listen to Baby No Money, but it was, that song popped up on my

2128
03:29:37,140 --> 03:29:38,980
like recommended, so I was like, clicky.

2129
03:29:41,940 --> 03:29:48,660
Oh, thank you for the gifted Benji. Benji Bailey. Bailey. That's your kiss right there.

2130
03:29:48,740 --> 03:29:56,180
That's for you. Only you and you only, only you. It's funny because in my, oh, you want a kiss?

2131
03:29:56,180 --> 03:30:02,900
You want a kiss? Hold on, let me get, I'm going to give you a kiss. Are you ready for the kiss?

2132
03:30:03,540 --> 03:30:05,940
Are you ready for the kiss? Are you ready for the kiss?

2133
03:30:09,940 --> 03:30:16,500
There you go. I said in British, you know, you guys know I go British all the time, NFT perp.

2134
03:30:18,340 --> 03:30:24,260
I used to, in my PL, I used to dedicate every time I burped to somebody and there was a redeem

2135
03:30:24,260 --> 03:30:27,780
because I used to have Twitch. I would, they would redeem to be get the burp dedication.

2136
03:30:27,780 --> 03:30:33,700
And when I happened to burp, I'd be like, insert name here. That was for you. Stay beautiful.

2137
03:30:35,380 --> 03:30:40,260
I guess it was kind of wet. I like your mom's pussy.

2138
03:30:45,780 --> 03:30:49,460
You know what else is wet? My mom. Sorry.

2139
03:30:49,700 --> 03:31:01,140
Jb going British to do a best Andrew Tate impression. What? Andrew Tate's not British.

2140
03:31:03,940 --> 03:31:13,300
Water? Water? I imagine use that voice to the key and funny voice for those reduce specifically.

2141
03:31:13,700 --> 03:31:21,220
Um, no, I've used, I've used my PL voice a lot actually. Outing your mom like that.

2142
03:31:22,660 --> 03:31:23,140
Peeler.

2143
03:31:28,180 --> 03:31:32,980
Anyways, games, right? I've just been, I'm actually just stalling for time. Nobody called me out.

2144
03:31:32,980 --> 03:31:45,220
Oh, wait. Hold on. I fucked this up already. Hold on. I fucked this up already.

2145
03:31:51,380 --> 03:31:54,660
Damn it. Fuck. Okay. Hold on. Shocking time.

2146
03:31:55,220 --> 03:31:59,140
None. Shibby peek. Aw, thanks, namesword.

2147
03:32:02,740 --> 03:32:05,700
That wasn't that bad. Hold on. I don't think it's touching properly.

2148
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:15,300
Yeah. Okay. That was it. Morty's. Morty's. Guys, I will beat this.

2149
03:32:25,380 --> 03:32:27,380
That's when I start throwing shit at the wall.

2150
03:32:34,020 --> 03:32:36,900
This is not working. Oh God.

2151
03:32:40,340 --> 03:32:47,460
Ha, bitch. Oh, I was in your circle of death. I didn't mean to get so close to you. I got a shock again.

2152
03:32:47,460 --> 03:32:55,780
I feel so close to you right now. It's a force field.

2153
03:32:57,140 --> 03:32:57,860
Morty's.

2154
03:33:07,300 --> 03:33:08,820
Welcome, Mr. Pizza.

2155
03:33:11,700 --> 03:33:15,860
Mr. Pizza, let me ask you. Do you know the muffin man who lives under Rulee Lane?

2156
03:33:17,780 --> 03:33:36,100
No, I walked into her. I can't believe I've done that. I can't believe it.

2157
03:33:38,100 --> 03:33:41,780
Rainer, why are you hissing at Boomi? Boomi, what are you doing?

2158
03:33:42,740 --> 03:33:47,780
Seriously? What are you doing, mate? Come here.

2159
03:33:50,340 --> 03:33:54,100
Boomi, you made such a mess. You kicked shit out of the litter box. Why would you do that?

2160
03:33:54,100 --> 03:33:55,300
Boomi, leave her alone.

2161
03:33:57,860 --> 03:34:01,540
He full on just jumped on Rainer. I've never seen him do that before.

2162
03:34:01,540 --> 03:34:07,380
Dude, you're getting real ballsy with her. Respect your elder. I think he's realizing

2163
03:34:07,380 --> 03:34:10,740
now that he's bigger than her and he's not a kitten anymore, so he doesn't have to take her

2164
03:34:10,740 --> 03:34:19,700
shit. Boomi, come here. Mr. Yeah, get over here. Don't try to seduce me.

2165
03:34:21,060 --> 03:34:25,860
What are you doing? Stop trying to attack or not attack. You're just trying to play with her,

2166
03:34:25,860 --> 03:34:29,780
but she doesn't want to play with you. Can you not? Can you stop assaulting old women?

2167
03:34:30,820 --> 03:34:34,340
Sir? Sir, do you have a moment to talk about how you assault old women?

2168
03:34:35,060 --> 03:34:39,060
Hmm?

2169
03:34:39,940 --> 03:34:42,100
Rainer's looking at me like, why did you buy him?

2170
03:34:44,660 --> 03:34:46,580
Did I shock myself already? I don't remember.

2171
03:34:49,540 --> 03:34:52,180
Phoebe's heart rate was higher than the intermittent because I don't know. I just

2172
03:34:52,180 --> 03:34:58,100
lock in during a stream. Falsely convicted.

2173
03:34:58,820 --> 03:35:04,260
I gave myself a little shock. It didn't make me yelp, though.

2174
03:35:07,780 --> 03:35:14,660
Okay, we're here. We're there. We're everywhere. We're in. We're so inmates.

2175
03:35:15,780 --> 03:35:17,540
Oh, I try to run out of the way in time.

2176
03:35:18,100 --> 03:35:27,140
Oh, let me shock myself. That's kind of stung a little, but in a good way.

2177
03:35:32,180 --> 03:35:35,940
Okay, then she's going to bounce up and then go down and I'll be like boom, boom,

2178
03:35:35,940 --> 03:35:38,900
ba. I got that boom, boom, pow, and then I'm going to run away.

2179
03:35:39,620 --> 03:35:42,980
Then she's going to go in the corner and then I'm going to get her in the corner

2180
03:35:43,940 --> 03:35:50,980
and I'm going to go down and I'm going to be in her fucking way. All right.

2181
03:36:00,100 --> 03:36:08,820
Danger, danger. High voltage. When we touch, when we kiss, danger, danger.

2182
03:36:09,780 --> 03:36:15,140
High voltage. When we touch, when we kiss, when we touch, lover.

2183
03:36:19,540 --> 03:36:21,140
No, no. Ah.

2184
03:36:27,140 --> 03:36:30,820
Fire on the disco. Fire in the Taco Bell. Sorry, I've shocked myself.

2185
03:36:31,220 --> 03:36:39,540
Guys, I think it was a bad idea to change it to death. That's not fair.

2186
03:36:41,540 --> 03:36:45,300
I don't think that's fair at all, but that's just my opinion.

2187
03:36:48,500 --> 03:36:50,180
And Boomi is chasing her again.

2188
03:36:50,580 --> 03:36:59,460
Oh, fuck, I went the wrong way.

2189
03:37:08,740 --> 03:37:16,660
How could this happen to me? I made my mistakes. Like I get the rules now.

2190
03:37:17,620 --> 03:37:19,860
I just can't fulfill them. No.

2191
03:37:24,580 --> 03:37:26,420
How's that? This is, this is bad mood.

2192
03:37:36,900 --> 03:37:43,140
Oh, I keep getting in the wrong way. What's wrong with me? Oh, I got to shock myself.

2193
03:37:47,380 --> 03:37:52,420
All right. Well, I was standing there while I was shocking myself. So I'll shock myself again.

2194
03:37:54,580 --> 03:37:57,860
Hello? Are you there? God, it's me, Margaret.

2195
03:38:01,540 --> 03:38:07,940
What's happening? Boomi, I hear you making noises behind me. Just chill out in the bed.

2196
03:38:07,940 --> 03:38:12,180
I don't want to, I put the bed there for you. Just, just chill. Just chill, just chill, bro.

2197
03:38:12,180 --> 03:38:15,940
Just go to sleep. Just go to sleep. Just go to sleep.

2198
03:38:15,940 --> 03:38:39,700
I'm not fucking close enough.

2199
03:38:45,940 --> 03:39:00,580
I'm killing myself in Minecraft.

2200
03:39:06,180 --> 03:39:08,260
I'm killing myself twice.

2201
03:39:08,980 --> 03:39:13,220
It's shocking, shocking.

2202
03:39:18,500 --> 03:39:20,500
Guys, I love this game.

2203
03:39:23,380 --> 03:39:25,940
Why is this harder than Dark Souls? I mean, harder than Elden Ring.

2204
03:39:28,100 --> 03:39:31,540
Although I know the pattern and everything. I'm just silly goose.

2205
03:39:38,660 --> 03:39:38,980
No.

2206
03:39:44,020 --> 03:39:49,380
You know what it is? You have to run to each side, like the star. Like you also make the star yourself.

2207
03:39:51,540 --> 03:39:52,180
It's funny.

2208
03:39:55,460 --> 03:39:56,100
No, oh my god.

2209
03:39:58,500 --> 03:40:00,500
I'm going to like give myself, paralyze myself

2210
03:40:00,660 --> 03:40:08,180
in Minecraft. I just scared Boomi with my, with my yell.

2211
03:40:09,860 --> 03:40:12,100
He just Tokyo drifted around the corner.

2212
03:40:18,340 --> 03:40:21,940
Oh, how could this happen to me?

2213
03:40:23,140 --> 03:40:24,580
Morgan, you fucked me up.

2214
03:40:30,820 --> 03:40:35,140
I just shocked myself twice.

2215
03:40:41,060 --> 03:40:45,140
Those are accurate. Sorry, I just sneezed. Those are accurate.

2216
03:40:48,340 --> 03:40:52,580
Is there, is there just going to be a role play of people going back and forth in the text

2217
03:40:52,580 --> 03:40:56,980
of speech about like your honor, my client, Boomi is innocent and then someone else can

2218
03:40:56,980 --> 03:41:01,700
be the defense and then someone could be the prosecutor and be like, uh, judge, uh, your

2219
03:41:01,700 --> 03:41:06,420
honor, you will see that Boomi has committed all these felonies and he still is evading the law.

2220
03:41:09,860 --> 03:41:13,140
Mori can is. Thank you, Morgan.

2221
03:41:16,420 --> 03:41:20,500
That'd be funny. Wait, where'd my game go? The hell?

2222
03:41:20,900 --> 03:41:24,740
Oh, right. Now you're back in your spot.

2223
03:41:26,020 --> 03:41:28,660
No, no, I'm not asking you to leave. That's fine. You can stay there.

2224
03:41:29,940 --> 03:41:33,300
Because sometimes when I talk to Reina, she'll just like, I may be like, oh,

2225
03:41:33,300 --> 03:41:36,020
you want me to come over and I'm like, no, no, no, you're fine.

2226
03:41:50,500 --> 03:42:12,420
I want to scream so bad, but I have neighbors. That was a week. Hold on, let me fix this.

2227
03:42:16,020 --> 03:42:18,740
Hi, sheebie. Sorry the priest guy has the agility of a rock,

2228
03:42:18,740 --> 03:42:23,620
missing all the best for your baby. Sheebie love. Oh, thank you, boy. Thank you so much.

2229
03:42:25,540 --> 03:42:25,940
Ow.

2230
03:42:31,620 --> 03:42:34,340
Okay, I've done what I must.

2231
03:42:37,620 --> 03:42:40,740
If I have to look at this girl, how an arm come out of her head,

2232
03:42:42,820 --> 03:42:45,300
more times I'm going to make freaking lose it.

2233
03:42:49,380 --> 03:43:00,660
I'm not close enough.

2234
03:43:10,260 --> 03:43:13,540
What was I inside her circle?

2235
03:43:13,540 --> 03:43:21,860
I don't even know. Okay. Anytime you hear me go, that's when I shot myself.

2236
03:43:25,540 --> 03:43:31,460
John and his broken leg are not helping this run. I know. Look at this little fucking gate. It's so funny.

2237
03:43:43,780 --> 03:44:00,900
Die. Are you serious? You're not dead yet?

2238
03:44:04,020 --> 03:44:09,860
Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going?

2239
03:44:14,020 --> 03:44:14,980
Wait, I need a shock.

2240
03:44:22,500 --> 03:44:25,700
That didn't work. Just kill me. No, don't kill me. Oh, just kill me.

2241
03:44:28,260 --> 03:44:33,140
Why is it firing Japanese at you? Good question.

2242
03:44:33,460 --> 03:44:42,740
You want to walk revelation so hard? You think I would peg it? Oh, no, I would peg a priest.

2243
03:44:44,500 --> 03:44:48,420
You guys want to dress up as my priest and I'm a nun and I peg you? Oh, that sounds good.

2244
03:44:48,420 --> 03:44:50,740
That sounds like good stuff.

2245
03:44:51,300 --> 03:45:06,900
Oh, my God. I almost fucking got caught. Die. Die. Fuck.

2246
03:45:08,740 --> 03:45:11,940
I'm like, I'm so silly. He sticks out his head. He's like, ah.

2247
03:45:12,020 --> 03:45:24,180
Ow. That one hurt. The fuck? I was like stinging. More kids. I have to fart.

2248
03:45:28,740 --> 03:45:29,540
Sorry, I had to fart.

2249
03:45:42,900 --> 03:45:45,300
I'm coming for you, bitch.

2250
03:45:51,300 --> 03:45:54,660
I got you right where I want you. Frick, I was in your circle.

2251
03:45:59,300 --> 03:46:02,020
I'll shock myself after I'm walking in, guys.

2252
03:46:02,820 --> 03:46:04,820
Yeah.

2253
03:46:20,820 --> 03:46:22,020
Hold on. Let me get over there.

2254
03:46:27,140 --> 03:46:31,220
Okay. Okay. Can you be my altar toy?

2255
03:46:32,020 --> 03:46:39,220
I like that, yes. I'm walking in. No talking. I'm in here. I'm good.

2256
03:47:02,020 --> 03:47:15,220
I'm so sorry for you.

2257
03:47:15,380 --> 03:47:18,420
I'm so sorry for you.

2258
03:47:28,420 --> 03:47:30,420
I'm so sorry for you.

2259
03:47:36,420 --> 03:47:38,420
I'm so sorry.

2260
03:47:46,180 --> 03:47:56,420
Scared the call. Oh, man. I'm so sorry.

2261
03:47:56,660 --> 03:47:59,620
Oh.

2262
03:48:10,180 --> 03:48:15,620
I think your name is DJ Mortis. Okay.

2263
03:48:15,860 --> 03:48:26,260
I'm gonna let Fia eat. I'm gonna be good and let Fia eat.

2264
03:48:31,140 --> 03:48:36,580
I'm about to make a DJ remix with all these people. Oh, what the fuck am I doing?

2265
03:48:36,580 --> 03:48:38,740
They accidentally closed the game. Okay, no, I didn't.

2266
03:48:38,900 --> 03:48:47,860
Locking in. We are locked. We're locking. We're ready for lift off.

2267
03:48:49,860 --> 03:48:52,980
Die. I was in her circle. It doesn't matter. It's fine.

2268
03:48:55,140 --> 03:48:58,020
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

2269
03:48:58,020 --> 03:49:01,860
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

2270
03:49:01,860 --> 03:49:05,460
You think I would have memorized where she goes already? No, I'm not that fucking smart. You serious?

2271
03:49:06,340 --> 03:49:09,300
I remember there's a timing. That's fine.

2272
03:49:18,500 --> 03:49:22,660
Frick. Boomi is wanted in six states for money laundering and tax evasion.

2273
03:49:23,620 --> 03:49:24,660
Locking in, part two.

2274
03:49:27,380 --> 03:49:31,060
Boomi. Boomi, you're in the way. Boomi, please. Boomi, I can't see past you.

2275
03:49:31,780 --> 03:49:35,060
I blame Boomi.

2276
03:49:37,140 --> 03:49:40,020
Are you going to go snuggle with her? Because if you want to lay in the bed with her,

2277
03:49:40,020 --> 03:49:43,700
that's fine, Boomi. Like, you know, you can snuggle with your sister.

2278
03:49:45,060 --> 03:49:49,060
He just sat on my hand. He is sitting on my hand.

2279
03:49:50,500 --> 03:49:56,500
He is pulling on the move, my gamer subs. He is sitting on my hand. You see that?

2280
03:49:57,460 --> 03:49:59,220
He is sitting on my hand.

2281
03:50:03,540 --> 03:50:04,660
He is sitting on my hand.

2282
03:50:12,820 --> 03:50:19,540
Boomi. Boomi. Boomi. I'm going to keep pinching your little booty cheeks.

2283
03:50:20,100 --> 03:50:23,060
Boomi. Can you move? Can you move?

2284
03:50:24,020 --> 03:50:28,420
Why are you wagging your tail? You're the one sitting on my hand.

2285
03:50:30,340 --> 03:50:32,580
Can you just want a head pat? I'll give you a head pat.

2286
03:50:35,460 --> 03:50:39,380
If I give you love, will you be okay?

2287
03:50:42,420 --> 03:50:47,300
Oh, my good boy. Oh, good boy. Wait, what's up with your shoulders? What's that?

2288
03:50:47,300 --> 03:50:48,820
Oh, you just felt your fur was messed up.

2289
03:50:49,540 --> 03:50:53,380
Oh, are you going to come snuggle with me, Boomi?

2290
03:50:55,620 --> 03:51:03,540
Boomi, come snuggle with me. Let me hold you. Oh, my big man. Oh, yeah. I'm holding him.

2291
03:51:07,780 --> 03:51:15,140
Oh, big man. Give you the kisses as I hold you. Oh, my little baby boy.

2292
03:51:16,020 --> 03:51:24,500
My little baby boy. My little baby. The babyest boy I've ever baby boyd before. He's the baby.

2293
03:51:27,860 --> 03:51:31,620
Oh, my client, Boomi, was one of the little ones. Yeah, now he's totally settled in my arms.

2294
03:51:32,180 --> 03:51:33,940
Ah, I'm getting like the worst fucking crabs.

2295
03:51:34,260 --> 03:51:47,700
The baby boy. But I also want to play the game and he's in my arms. Oh, what's the matter? Did you

2296
03:51:47,700 --> 03:51:54,820
see something? Whoa, what's the matter, Boomi? He started wagging his tail like really irritated.

2297
03:51:54,820 --> 03:52:01,460
Did you see something? What's the matter? I'm just holding you. I'll put you down.

2298
03:52:02,420 --> 03:52:05,860
I need to piss off because Fee is in the bed. I don't understand.

2299
03:52:07,620 --> 03:52:12,740
Are you jealous? Are you jealous that she's in the bed? Oh, he did a mighty big plop on the

2300
03:52:12,740 --> 03:52:17,060
floor, so he's fine. I think he is sleepy. I think he also is maybe harassing me to go to bed,

2301
03:52:17,060 --> 03:52:21,060
although it's only 10, so he's Amy.

2302
03:52:21,060 --> 03:52:31,700
All the boys and all the girls are pebbing to F if you seek Amy. Great song, Britney.

2303
03:52:33,620 --> 03:52:34,740
It's Britney, bitch.

2304
03:52:41,620 --> 03:52:43,540
It's Will I Am in Britney, bitch.

2305
03:52:51,780 --> 03:53:14,660
No, I wasn't. I wasn't in your circle. I wasn't in your circle. Is there something I'm supposed

2306
03:53:14,660 --> 03:53:30,580
to do after she goes to every side? I wasn't in it that time. That doesn't make any sense.

2307
03:53:45,380 --> 03:53:53,780
Oh, I got stuck. I'm surprised she didn't hit me.

2308
03:53:56,420 --> 03:53:56,660
What?

2309
03:54:02,660 --> 03:54:02,980
What?

2310
03:54:03,300 --> 03:54:04,100
What?

2311
03:54:10,820 --> 03:54:16,420
I clipped my toe, clearly. Yeah, I know her movement is a pentagram the same time,

2312
03:54:16,420 --> 03:54:18,820
but sometimes I don't get close to her and she's still...

2313
03:54:20,260 --> 03:54:24,100
Like, what is that? I didn't even press start.

2314
03:54:29,540 --> 03:54:30,100
Let me just...

2315
03:54:33,940 --> 03:54:45,780
Wow, I suck at this game. Anyways, am I stuck? What was that? I was perpetually, you know,

2316
03:54:45,780 --> 03:54:58,580
healing her the power of Christ.

2317
03:54:59,140 --> 03:55:13,780
I'm backing up. I'm backing up while I do this.

2318
03:55:17,300 --> 03:55:22,580
I was gonna... Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing?

2319
03:55:29,380 --> 03:55:37,380
Why are you...

2320
03:55:38,260 --> 03:55:50,180
What the fuck is happening?

2321
03:55:57,380 --> 03:56:05,140
Fucking trust you. What the... This bitch went out the window. Oh my god. Oh my god. First

2322
03:56:06,100 --> 03:56:15,620
I had a celebratory shock. Celebratory shock. Celebratory shock. Oh, nice.

2323
03:56:20,740 --> 03:56:26,100
Wait, I feel like someone doughnosed. Oh, I think you missed your pizza for that.

2324
03:56:26,100 --> 03:56:39,220
Oh my god. If you're a big chilling, she's hanging out with a whooper.

2325
03:56:40,660 --> 03:56:45,460
Okay, okay, okay, what time is it? It's 10.

2326
03:56:48,660 --> 03:56:51,620
What day is it? What's today?

2327
03:56:51,940 --> 03:57:04,500
Today is Tuesday. It's Tuesday, innit? I got you good. I got you fucking good,

2328
03:57:04,500 --> 03:57:12,420
mate. You're a fucking sly, then. Absolutely fucking mental users. It's Tuesday.

2329
03:57:13,300 --> 03:57:22,420
Okay, yeah, tomorrow I have a member stream. If you're a member, I'm gonna bake for you guys.

2330
03:57:24,340 --> 03:57:28,260
I don't know what I'm gonna... I wanted to do the easy bake-off-in thing,

2331
03:57:28,980 --> 03:57:33,220
but that's not gonna come in time. Maybe there's one nearby that I can...

2332
03:57:33,220 --> 03:57:38,740
But actually, I don't have any fucking money. So I'll probably just actually bake you a cake.

2333
03:57:40,420 --> 03:57:48,900
Just like a little box cake and I'll decorate it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

2334
03:57:50,980 --> 03:57:55,380
yeah. I'm almost done with this chapter. Thank you, my little back cedar.

2335
03:57:57,540 --> 03:58:02,500
He's like, play the fucking game. Shut up. They're here for me, a cute girl. Relax.

2336
03:58:04,180 --> 03:58:18,580
Yippee. Yippee. Yoppa. Yodda. Oh, do I need to go downstairs? I feel like I need to go downstairs.

2337
03:58:21,380 --> 03:58:28,180
It's quite quiet. Hi. Hi, Saber. I'm really here for boomy. Sorry. Kill her.

2338
03:58:28,580 --> 03:58:38,420
I don't think so. That says re-lilk. So maybe I need to go get some milk.

2339
03:58:40,500 --> 03:58:47,620
I'm shooting myself. How do I shoot myself? Do I go in the mirror and I shoot myself?

2340
03:58:48,660 --> 03:58:52,820
Let me go shoot myself. Yeah. Let me just...

2341
03:58:58,740 --> 03:59:00,740
Uh...

2342
03:59:12,900 --> 03:59:15,460
Do I need to find more bullets? I don't have any...

2343
03:59:19,140 --> 03:59:21,620
Hey, y'all got any bullets around here?

2344
03:59:21,780 --> 03:59:27,380
Go back to the room, like, gun response?

2345
03:59:37,780 --> 03:59:39,700
All right, time to go kill myself again.

2346
03:59:43,460 --> 03:59:48,660
Despite everything, it's still me killing myself. All right.

2347
03:59:49,620 --> 03:59:55,780
If it's a gun with one bullet, is it just magically respond? I don't know.

2348
03:59:55,780 --> 03:59:57,620
I'm... Shut up.

2349
04:00:03,060 --> 04:00:06,660
I'm getting a horror looker. Hold on.

2350
04:00:10,020 --> 04:00:14,660
I hate being a woman.

2351
04:00:14,900 --> 04:00:22,660
Can you guys, like, hold me? See my heart rate expect a little...

2352
04:00:27,460 --> 04:00:28,660
I'm in a lot of pain.

2353
04:00:31,860 --> 04:00:37,860
Are you okay? No, I'm a woman. I'm having period cramps. They hurt like a bitch.

2354
04:00:38,580 --> 04:00:39,940
Oh, this was really sharp.

2355
04:00:42,100 --> 04:00:42,600
Oh.

2356
04:00:44,980 --> 04:00:45,480
Uh...

2357
04:00:48,420 --> 04:00:50,580
Oh, I'm assuming I'm supposed to move. Die.

2358
04:00:53,220 --> 04:01:00,420
Die, bitch. Why do you look like what's his face from the TLC? Oh, what's his name?

2359
04:01:02,820 --> 04:01:05,300
Misma? I don't know. Okay, I think there's a man.

2360
04:01:06,420 --> 04:01:10,180
Midra? Midriff? Crop top?

2361
04:01:11,140 --> 04:01:18,660
Crop top? Drop top? Can you, like...

2362
04:01:19,860 --> 04:01:21,460
Oh, I don't know. No.

2363
04:01:23,460 --> 04:01:25,700
Oh, why do you look like a giant sunflower coming for me?

2364
04:01:26,900 --> 04:01:29,940
Come for me, sunflower. Come for me. Come for me, sunflower.

2365
04:01:31,140 --> 04:01:36,260
Yeah, you want this. You want this. You want this little sunflower ass. Oh, god, you're faster.

2366
04:01:36,260 --> 04:01:38,500
Uh... That's fine.

2367
04:01:41,300 --> 04:01:43,940
There's a monster in the closet. Oh, a note.

2368
04:01:45,220 --> 04:01:49,300
Find and defeat the secret boss of chapter... What? There's a secret boss?

2369
04:01:51,860 --> 04:01:54,580
October 23rd, 1986.

2370
04:01:55,780 --> 04:01:58,260
Dear Dr. M-

2371
04:01:59,380 --> 04:02:04,180
It has been 30 days since the beginning of my treatment here at Yale Psychiatric Institute.

2372
04:02:04,900 --> 04:02:09,700
Dr. Spinnell has been so patient with me, has helped me understand my afflictions,

2373
04:02:09,700 --> 04:02:14,500
has helped me find a way to move forward and accept the truth. With Dr. Spinnell's help,

2374
04:02:14,500 --> 04:02:18,500
I have come to accept what really happened in September at the Morton family residence.

2375
04:02:19,060 --> 04:02:23,380
I accept that what happened was not the result of any supernatural phenomenon,

2376
04:02:23,380 --> 04:02:28,180
but rather the desperate actions of a young girl driven by violence by her dogmatic parents

2377
04:02:28,180 --> 04:02:31,140
in old church rituals that are thought to drive out evil.

2378
04:02:32,100 --> 04:02:33,620
Oh, so it was all in my head.

2379
04:02:34,740 --> 04:02:44,580
It's in your head. In your head. Zahambe. Zahambe. Zahambe.

2380
04:02:46,580 --> 04:02:54,580
Oh, oh. Anyways, I'm happy to report that since accepting the truth. Wait, why am I British?

2381
04:02:54,580 --> 04:02:59,860
I'm supposed to be in a cage. My nightmares have ceased to know. I enjoy peace of mind that

2382
04:02:59,940 --> 04:03:05,140
I've not felt since the incident. Given my progress since first coming here,

2383
04:03:05,140 --> 04:03:11,060
I respectfully request, I respectfully request, I respect fully request. I respectfully request

2384
04:03:11,060 --> 04:03:15,620
my release from Yale Psychiatric Institute contingent upon follow-up appointments with Dr.

2385
04:03:15,620 --> 04:03:24,420
Spinnell in the future. Sincerely, Nick Cage. Singing emo. I need to get one with like a microphone.

2386
04:03:25,140 --> 04:03:36,900
Oh, it looks like he's dancing. No, we knew it.

2387
04:03:36,900 --> 04:03:39,460
Nicky cotton cake. Oh, so I still need to kill her.

2388
04:03:44,020 --> 04:03:53,060
Okay. Oh, I didn't mean to press that. I accidentally pressed space. Hold on.

2389
04:03:54,740 --> 04:04:05,140
Wait, what? Sunflower man just like in the thing. I have choices. Okay, so she's either in the

2390
04:04:05,140 --> 04:04:14,180
basement or in the attic. What's the difference though? Because they say she's in the basement,

2391
04:04:14,180 --> 04:04:21,860
then we say she's in the attic. She already left. Oh,

2392
04:04:24,820 --> 04:04:28,340
you're right. She didn't leave. She jumped out the window. Maybe she went back in. I don't know.

2393
04:04:30,340 --> 04:04:31,860
I don't feel like going back to the basement.

2394
04:04:44,580 --> 04:04:49,380
What if I just go home with my really large cigarette?

2395
04:04:49,940 --> 04:04:52,420
Like I'm holding a big ass cigarette.

2396
04:04:55,700 --> 04:05:03,620
Going, going, going. Just to smoke my giant ass cigarette. Giant ass cigarette.

2397
04:05:04,900 --> 04:05:11,300
Giant ass cigarette. She's in the well, but I can't use it. I can't shoot the well.

2398
04:05:14,660 --> 04:05:23,540
I'm going back to my Toyota Corolla with the sick spoiler. Man, this is really big forest.

2399
04:05:25,940 --> 04:05:30,820
But I'll just, okay, cool. Die.

2400
04:05:31,780 --> 04:05:35,780
Oh.

2401
04:05:39,460 --> 04:05:40,980
Erm, what the shibbity?

2402
04:06:00,820 --> 04:06:08,180
Because I have made the Lord my refuge. Because I have set my love upon him.

2403
04:06:08,180 --> 04:06:14,420
Therefore will he deliver me. I shall call upon him and he will answer me.

2404
04:06:15,300 --> 04:06:17,300
He will be with me in truck.

2405
04:06:17,300 --> 04:06:26,100
Truck, my beloved. Hello. You've been hit by, you've been struck by a fucking 18-wheeler.

2406
04:06:31,140 --> 04:06:36,740
Wait, so the white thing was her? She was the, she was the white boy all along?

2407
04:06:41,220 --> 04:06:44,100
Oh. There's multiple endings.

2408
04:06:46,660 --> 04:06:48,420
What the fuck? Is this the true ending?

2409
04:06:50,980 --> 04:06:57,060
No, that was the boy. She was not the white boy. Interesting. Because it said kill her.

2410
04:07:01,140 --> 04:07:09,140
I'd say this is the sequel. And then you don't know what happened to her brothers.

2411
04:07:13,940 --> 04:07:15,700
I'm assuming you go upwards.

2412
04:07:19,860 --> 04:07:21,460
IDK. At least you're honest, bro.

2413
04:07:24,660 --> 04:07:28,980
It's the best ending of chapter one, yes. Okay. I'm assuming you, can't you, I'm assuming you

2414
04:07:28,980 --> 04:07:30,420
can go and find her and kill her.

2415
04:07:33,060 --> 04:07:39,780
And because it says kill her. So I'm assuming maybe I go up towards the forest and I can go kill her.

2416
04:07:40,580 --> 04:07:45,940
Have you gotten the other ending? Bro, I, it's been four hours and I only just finished the game.

2417
04:07:47,700 --> 04:07:56,260
Because I am a yapper. I get distracted. I'm tempted to go make myself a PB and J right now.

2418
04:07:56,980 --> 04:08:02,500
Because we did what did I eat? I just ate. I had a waffle. I had two waffles actually.

2419
04:08:05,300 --> 04:08:06,580
I just finished the first chapter.

2420
04:08:08,260 --> 04:08:14,500
One hour half. Yeah, that's how I do. That's how I do. We do one and a half hours of gaming.

2421
04:08:14,500 --> 04:08:17,860
Oh fuck. Am I just like closed out everything?

2422
04:08:20,900 --> 04:08:24,260
Don't you feel blessed? Oh, Fia, why are you so wiggly? Are you okay?

2423
04:08:25,220 --> 04:08:27,380
Are you trying to get comfy? Hold on, let me help you.

2424
04:08:29,940 --> 04:08:30,420
There you go.

2425
04:08:33,620 --> 04:08:38,020
I know. I'm just taking forever with the shock collar. Which reminds me, I have to shock myself

2426
04:08:38,020 --> 04:08:38,820
like five times.

2427
04:08:39,780 --> 04:08:50,580
Okay.

2428
04:08:55,860 --> 04:08:58,740
The lore. The lore is good.

2429
04:08:58,740 --> 04:09:09,780
I know. I mostly look around the internet and truly kind heart is the real thing.

2430
04:09:11,060 --> 04:09:12,580
Are you saying I'm kind hearted?

2431
04:09:15,380 --> 04:09:24,340
So, thank you. Got to sleep. Good night. Oh, thank you.

2432
04:09:25,060 --> 04:09:29,940
Finally, you beat it. Here you go. Do I have to shock myself five times?

2433
04:09:31,860 --> 04:09:41,460
One, two, three, four, five.

2434
04:09:48,660 --> 04:09:49,940
Thank you. Thank you.

2435
04:09:55,060 --> 04:09:57,540
Oh, it's itchy.

2436
04:10:05,300 --> 04:10:08,580
Sorry. I'm checking because it didn't show up on my stream elements.

2437
04:10:14,100 --> 04:10:16,020
Stream elements is just being weird right now.

2438
04:10:16,980 --> 04:10:24,580
Oh, thank you so much. It could binge Faith Ward. What?

2439
04:10:25,540 --> 04:10:27,540
She read up on the lore, hid you in bible.

2440
04:10:31,300 --> 04:10:37,300
So, I watched a YouTuber play this entire game, but I don't remember any of it.

2441
04:10:38,500 --> 04:10:40,420
That was like years ago. Ow, my nose.

2442
04:10:40,980 --> 04:10:45,140
Oh, yeah. What's it? It's just good. Well, you guys.

2443
04:10:46,020 --> 04:10:50,500
Nunchibi, what? Was like the prayer? Was like the thank you? Like a prayer? Nunchibi?

2444
04:10:51,780 --> 04:10:53,300
I want to be a nun so bad.

2445
04:10:55,620 --> 04:10:56,340
But I can't.

2446
04:11:01,780 --> 04:11:05,140
One degree is the best video. This is very low. Oh, okay.

2447
04:11:06,100 --> 04:11:11,460
Because I totally would like watch like a five hour lore video because you guys know I love lore of

2448
04:11:11,460 --> 04:11:15,940
shit. Sister Shibidi, I have sinned multiple times.

2449
04:11:17,060 --> 04:11:22,180
Joke. Why did you have to do a tone indicator? Oh, they're so funny to me.

2450
04:11:27,940 --> 04:11:32,100
It's a five hour lore video. Wait, is it? Oh, perfect. I'll watch that.

2451
04:11:32,900 --> 04:11:38,100
Oh, love it. Oh, I love it. Let me take this shot color off.

2452
04:11:42,100 --> 04:11:44,900
Whoa, we should have a Shibidi react to Wendigo video.

2453
04:11:46,900 --> 04:11:51,780
How I slowly realized she can't trust her government at any level and also horror game rate.

2454
04:11:51,780 --> 04:11:56,660
I don't trust my government at any level, but I don't care at this point because they

2455
04:11:56,660 --> 04:12:03,060
have all the information on me. There's nothing I can do. I am just a sheep among the people.

2456
04:12:03,060 --> 04:12:11,060
I am a sheeple. I am nothing but fodder to the larger system that is capitalism. Anyways.

2457
04:12:14,740 --> 04:12:16,420
So how long until the confession stream?

2458
04:12:16,980 --> 04:12:29,780
Oh, that's very interesting. He's a youth pastor. Interesting.

2459
04:12:32,260 --> 04:12:35,060
I need to blow my nose, but the tissue box is so far away.

2460
04:12:35,860 --> 04:12:45,860
But blow my nose, Fia. Fia's like, what? I don't know, my sweet girl. I don't know, my sweet

2461
04:12:45,860 --> 04:12:51,780
girl. Yeah, my sweet girl. I'm going to give you your medicine when we wake up. Oh, you're giving

2462
04:12:51,780 --> 04:12:58,660
me smiles. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

2463
04:12:59,620 --> 04:13:05,300
I'm supposed to stream by living on outfit. Fia cam. Yeah, we got Fia under cam. We got the

2464
04:13:05,300 --> 04:13:12,340
Wooper. Fia doesn't like that idea. I've never watched that person. I've never heard of them,

2465
04:13:13,220 --> 04:13:19,140
but I love lore videos. I'm just sad that like I can't watch game theory because it's not MatPat

2466
04:13:19,140 --> 04:13:23,780
anymore. It's not the same. It's not this British dude that does his voice and I'm like,

2467
04:13:23,860 --> 04:13:30,340
he's cool, I guess, but it's not the same. So I'll watch. Maybe I have heard of Wendigoon. I don't

2468
04:13:30,340 --> 04:13:34,340
know. What part of the Bible are we studying today?

2469
04:13:39,780 --> 04:13:51,380
Sorry, it's long. You're going to study this part and hold on. I wish I had a ignore that my freaking

2470
04:13:51,380 --> 04:13:57,220
thing. Am I fixed that right now, actually? I'll fix it later. Looks like kind of cool,

2471
04:13:57,220 --> 04:14:02,820
actually. Looks like I'm glowing, floating. You're going to study that and then you can

2472
04:14:03,940 --> 04:14:16,340
picture. This is your little head and I'm crushing it. I'm crushing it.

2473
04:14:17,300 --> 04:14:27,620
It's getting crushed. Crushing. No feet. It's over. I am annealing. I'm literally annealing.

2474
04:14:30,900 --> 04:14:36,260
I am prostrated and supplication to the Lord.

2475
04:14:38,980 --> 04:14:40,820
No, not prostated. Everybody relax.

2476
04:14:41,620 --> 04:14:45,460
Wait, I want to see if I already got limited. YouTube hates me, Lily.

2477
04:14:54,100 --> 04:15:01,620
Oh, it leases streaming in literally 15 minutes. I'm going to gap for 15 minutes and I'll raid her.

2478
04:15:03,300 --> 04:15:07,620
Oh, wait. Yeah, I might as well because Mercy is not going to be on till 11 if she's, I don't

2479
04:15:07,620 --> 04:15:13,380
know if she's streaming today. I haven't looked at any of the schedules. Erm, what the shivity?

2480
04:15:13,380 --> 04:15:16,260
What am I doing? I totally already forgot. Oh, yeah, that's right.

2481
04:15:19,780 --> 04:15:22,100
When we go big time.

2482
04:15:28,500 --> 04:15:32,180
All right, still says it's on. That's going to change.

2483
04:15:32,980 --> 04:15:42,500
Let me see. Yeah, I take Fia to bed. What the shabaththy?

2484
04:15:47,060 --> 04:15:51,940
Oh, that's Shabaththy. Oh, wait, I didn't mean to do that. Hold on. Actually, let me just scoop.

2485
04:15:53,060 --> 04:15:55,620
Why isn't my mouth tracking working when I turn to the side?

2486
04:15:56,340 --> 04:16:03,380
There we go. Oh, look, it's me. Why is my body darker? That doesn't make any sense. It's fine.

2487
04:16:13,060 --> 04:16:22,660
Looks like I'm flying with my ears. Mortis. Mortis. Can someone just like edit, like, oh, shit.

2488
04:16:25,780 --> 04:16:31,220
33 cents. Thank you for today's sermon. Sister, she be blessings be upon you.

2489
04:16:31,220 --> 04:16:34,980
Blessings. Blessings be upon you too, my child. I'm not currently

2490
04:16:35,620 --> 04:16:41,060
robed, but it's fine. Don't worry about it. I am going to get dressed expeditiously.

2491
04:16:48,100 --> 04:16:54,020
Hold on. Please hold. Oh, I lost my mole. It's fine. What is this? Hello? Get rid of that. Where's

2492
04:16:54,020 --> 04:17:04,980
my head? All right. I like this. Hey.

2493
04:17:08,980 --> 04:17:16,180
This is a little bit bigger. There we go. What up? What up, bro? My head's so big. Don't

2494
04:17:16,180 --> 04:17:24,500
worry about it. I think my head's actually too big. Let me just. No, let me on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2495
04:17:26,100 --> 04:17:37,940
Let me. Let me do this. No. No. I am a bobblehead. I have, I have non consenting proportions,

2496
04:17:38,020 --> 04:17:39,220
as they say in the internet.

2497
04:17:43,140 --> 04:17:47,540
Yeah. Oh, fuck. I didn't take my body. Frick. I didn't take my body with me.

2498
04:17:49,140 --> 04:17:52,020
Can I have that back? Can I have my body?

2499
04:17:53,620 --> 04:17:59,700
Watch out for my body rolls. Watch out for my body rolls. Hi kicks. Hi kicks. This is how we do it.

2500
04:18:02,100 --> 04:18:04,500
All right. Now I'm fashionable.

2501
04:18:08,100 --> 04:18:11,620
Bobblehead, she be. No, I'm a door hon.

2502
04:18:15,300 --> 04:18:21,860
She was like a Lego to stick. Oh, big. Oh, big yarn, Fia. Hello. What are you doing?

2503
04:18:24,420 --> 04:18:31,860
And a baby. Oh, pat the nose for the baby. You know. Can I have a kiss?

2504
04:18:32,820 --> 04:18:37,780
She's like, no, no kisses. Fia usually wakes me up with a, with a licky on my nose,

2505
04:18:37,780 --> 04:18:39,300
but she hasn't been able to do that.

2506
04:18:41,300 --> 04:18:42,660
Why are you looking around so much?

2507
04:18:45,940 --> 04:18:49,300
You got places to be. You got places to be, momma.

2508
04:18:52,180 --> 04:18:55,300
A boop just knew it. I have boopa just knew it. Boop.

2509
04:18:55,700 --> 04:19:05,140
He's just like headbutting me. He's so cute. He's so cute, miss ma'am. Where's Boomi?

2510
04:19:06,900 --> 04:19:11,780
Oh, he's, he now, he's in the bed, guys. He's in the bed that I put on the ground like an hour

2511
04:19:11,780 --> 04:19:17,380
ago, waiting for him to settle down into. And he's asleep in the bed.

2512
04:19:17,540 --> 04:19:26,820
Toss this cheese slice on her face. You want me to throw a slice of cheese on my paralyzed cat?

2513
04:19:26,820 --> 04:19:32,100
No. My head still looks really big. It's fine. Don't worry about it.

2514
04:19:34,420 --> 04:19:38,260
Boomi's, Boomi's literally right by my feet right now. I don't even want to say his name

2515
04:19:38,900 --> 04:19:42,820
because then I'll wake up. If I leave the room, he won't leave the room with me.

2516
04:19:42,980 --> 04:19:46,100
Boomi as I could, he has his moments.

2517
04:19:49,460 --> 04:19:53,540
I just looked down. He's like freaking, he's knocked. Could you see me when I,

2518
04:19:57,860 --> 04:20:02,820
Theo, who are you looking at? What do you, I think she just realized that there's like a shelf

2519
04:20:02,820 --> 04:20:04,420
above her? She's like, oh, what the heck?

2520
04:20:04,980 --> 04:20:10,260
Theo's looking up at Boomi and she's like, can I get some attention too?

2521
04:20:11,780 --> 04:20:16,740
Hey, let's go over here. Why don't we?

2522
04:20:21,940 --> 04:20:30,100
Hey, how you doing? Ignore the stuff that's scrolling.

2523
04:20:30,340 --> 04:20:36,020
Just pay attention to me and you.

2524
04:20:38,980 --> 04:20:45,700
Yeah, you turned on the music. How's it going?

2525
04:20:48,180 --> 04:20:50,820
Are you city east? Yeah.

2526
04:20:51,060 --> 04:21:03,620
I'm so epi. I have not been sleeping well because I've been up. I'll wake up a lot just to check

2527
04:21:03,620 --> 04:21:15,860
on for you. I'm very epi right now, but I'm going to wait until Elias is on. But hey, how are you guys doing?

2528
04:21:16,740 --> 04:21:21,780
I know it will get you guys happy.

2529
04:21:29,140 --> 04:21:39,060
I mean, I really wish I had a popsicle right now. That would be crazy. That would, that would be great.

2530
04:21:39,060 --> 04:21:44,180
I can't wait for the blue website.

2531
04:21:46,980 --> 04:21:49,620
My ears have appeared. I don't know what you're talking about.

2532
04:21:53,140 --> 04:22:02,260
Oh, don't worry about that.

2533
04:22:09,300 --> 04:22:16,260
I forget how to turn into a white woman again.

2534
04:22:16,260 --> 04:22:20,260
Oh, hi.

2535
04:22:24,260 --> 04:22:37,380
Whoa, isn't it crazy when I take off my Tantoggle? How pale I actually ended up looking.

2536
04:22:39,700 --> 04:22:41,860
That's quite funny.

2537
04:22:47,220 --> 04:22:50,580
I know my body is tan, but it's fine. It just looks dark.

2538
04:22:55,220 --> 04:22:57,780
Yeah, it's got better hanging out with you guys.

2539
04:22:58,500 --> 04:23:06,100
I unplugged my camera. Pay my bills. What do you mean?

2540
04:23:08,020 --> 04:23:14,980
With one click you can be a white woman. That is, that is something funny.

2541
04:23:21,780 --> 04:23:23,460
I'm starting to get used to the blue eyes.

2542
04:23:23,540 --> 04:23:36,660
Well, then I look devious with the red eyes.

2543
04:23:37,620 --> 04:23:58,260
The blue eyes, I know it looks like, I don't know, again, because the layering is messed up on both,

2544
04:23:58,260 --> 04:24:01,460
but you can't really notice it as much on the blue one as on the red one.

2545
04:24:01,860 --> 04:24:08,740
She can now summon blue eyes, white woman, in attack mode.

2546
04:24:11,300 --> 04:24:21,940
Oh my god, blue eyes, white woman. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Hold on. Oh, hi for you.

2547
04:24:22,660 --> 04:24:24,180
Where?

2548
04:24:27,620 --> 04:24:32,020
What's up, lady? What's up, lady? Whoa.

2549
04:24:35,300 --> 04:24:39,300
I'm just pulling up another outfit. Oh, sick. I didn't know I could do that.

2550
04:24:43,540 --> 04:24:45,140
So if I get rid of this,

2551
04:24:46,020 --> 04:24:52,660
hold on. Sorry. I like sometimes I'll toggle stuff and I don't know where I put the toggle.

2552
04:24:52,660 --> 04:24:55,140
Oh, but ignore that red ring.

2553
04:24:57,300 --> 04:25:08,980
Aha. And then, and then, and then, I don't remember where I put any of my toggles.

2554
04:25:12,660 --> 04:25:13,300
What the hell?

2555
04:25:15,780 --> 04:25:22,260
Bro, sometimes my toggles just get messed up because I have a toggle to make my ears darker

2556
04:25:22,260 --> 04:25:30,820
and they're not working. I hate it here. Well, I'm just gonna beat you then.

2557
04:25:35,620 --> 04:25:41,060
No, take me back to Paradise City where the grass is green and the girls are brown.

2558
04:25:41,060 --> 04:25:50,100
Sorry. Okay, I just, I just won't have ears then in my, I look very gyaru with my blush.

2559
04:25:50,820 --> 04:25:58,580
Please, please, please, please, please. Where is it? Where is it? Oh, I found it.

2560
04:26:02,260 --> 04:26:07,060
Meow. Yippee.

2561
04:26:11,060 --> 04:26:12,180
Imagine if I was this short.

2562
04:26:14,900 --> 04:26:18,180
What the heck did I do? Something like, I don't know why, but

2563
04:26:20,180 --> 04:26:26,580
this went like full screen. Go, stop. OBS went full screen and I can't get out of it.

2564
04:26:28,580 --> 04:26:30,740
I don't know how. I'm not strong enough.

2565
04:26:31,460 --> 04:26:41,620
Oh, police, animal experts investigate Chupacabra remains near Sterling.

2566
04:26:42,740 --> 04:26:46,740
Sterling PD is the, sorry, I'm reading the things, Chupacabra.

2567
04:26:48,340 --> 04:26:49,780
Okay, so they just talk it up to it.

2568
04:26:51,940 --> 04:26:55,780
Whoa, new background. I'm getting stuff unlocked.

2569
04:27:01,140 --> 04:27:10,020
What the hell? No, I don't want to play again, please. Well, I do. I will play this again.

2570
04:27:10,020 --> 04:27:11,060
Can I quit? Thank you.

2571
04:27:18,100 --> 04:27:21,620
All right, because I can't see the chat. I just want to see the chat.

2572
04:27:22,340 --> 04:27:28,260
Oh, my God, my back pocket size. I got a pocket, I got a pocket for us.

2573
04:27:30,900 --> 04:27:34,500
Here he gets a Bethany size.

2574
04:27:36,580 --> 04:27:43,460
I would agree with that. Oh, showing a little leg.

2575
04:27:43,460 --> 04:27:57,460
I like a casual outfit. Thighs. Oh, ignore me that I'm just thighs.

2576
04:28:01,780 --> 04:28:06,900
I don't know if I can change anything about this outfit, can I? I don't think this outfit has any toggles.

2577
04:28:13,460 --> 04:28:18,180
I don't think it does, no.

2578
04:28:22,340 --> 04:28:25,940
Yeah, it's just simple. It's a simple, cute outfit and I like it.

2579
04:28:27,700 --> 04:28:35,940
I think I'll probably use this outfit a lot when I'm not, like, I don't know.

2580
04:28:38,260 --> 04:28:42,340
I just like the outfit. I wish you could see the belly button more, though. Can't really see the belly.

2581
04:28:43,700 --> 04:28:45,940
But yeah, this is just a booth outfit. It's very cute.

2582
04:28:47,700 --> 04:28:52,420
You find your lack of feet disturbing? Well, sorry about that.

2583
04:28:54,980 --> 04:29:01,140
I'm sorry, Amigo. Oh, wait, hold on. Let me, while I'm waiting, I'm going to fix that.

2584
04:29:14,100 --> 04:29:16,740
Sometimes there are shadows that you can't really see.

2585
04:29:25,140 --> 04:29:26,740
I can't tell if that's the right one.

2586
04:29:30,740 --> 04:29:35,700
Sorry, I'm looking at my legs and I'm trying to get the lace off.

2587
04:29:37,780 --> 04:29:38,260
There we go.

2588
04:29:44,260 --> 04:29:55,700
Oh, it's a sour hole model for a second. Just like jump scare you. Kind of terrifying, but it's fine.

2589
04:30:01,300 --> 04:30:04,900
Now I'm looking for something so I can save that.

2590
04:30:05,700 --> 04:30:23,220
Okay, I fixed it, so now that shouldn't do that anymore. I think I fixed the, I hope I fixed the

2591
04:30:23,220 --> 04:30:32,660
ring being there. Wait, you do have legs. Well, I have like that much leg.

2592
04:30:38,980 --> 04:30:44,660
No feet. Guys, it's just an outfit. They usually don't make the entire model. They

2593
04:30:44,660 --> 04:30:50,020
usually just do it because most people, you don't see the bottom of models. That's why the bottoms

2594
04:30:50,020 --> 04:31:02,500
of models are so usually like not super detailed or like super designed because people, you barely

2595
04:31:02,500 --> 04:31:12,820
see them. So sometimes it just like, you can really, it honestly makes way more sense for

2596
04:31:12,820 --> 04:31:17,380
everybody to have half body models rather than full body because you never see the freaking full

2597
04:31:17,380 --> 04:31:24,180
body. Like it's usually like, I'm up here like this. Hey, guys, welcome to my stream. That's

2598
04:31:24,180 --> 04:31:30,820
why it's always important when you're with vtuber designs is that all the attractive things are

2599
04:31:30,820 --> 04:31:36,980
on the top and then maybe some interesting things are at the bottom. What if she was cool and I am

2600
04:31:36,980 --> 04:31:44,580
cool and casual? What do you mean? I'm always cool and casual. I'm always keeping it cool,

2601
04:31:44,580 --> 04:31:53,380
kid. Always keeping it cool. Okay, let me redirect. Thank you for spending time with me today, by the

2602
04:31:53,380 --> 04:31:59,940
way. You guys took a lot of the stress off and it was nice to have Fia be next to me so I can keep

2603
04:31:59,940 --> 04:32:06,420
an eye on her and you guys could also just like keep an eye on her for me. Hey, I gotta go. Can

2604
04:32:06,420 --> 04:32:16,180
you guys watch my cat? Yeah, I appreciate you guys' support so much. It helps a lot with the bills

2605
04:32:16,180 --> 04:32:19,540
and stuff. So I appreciate you big time.

2606
04:32:32,900 --> 04:32:37,140
Uh, I think, oh my goodness.

2607
04:32:38,100 --> 04:32:47,060
Aw, thank you, Miru. Thank you so much. Yeah, I'm gonna get some rest. I'm gonna

2608
04:32:47,060 --> 04:32:51,540
try to have her use the litter box before I go to bed because it can be a little bit harder for

2609
04:32:51,540 --> 04:32:56,900
her when she's like this. So I really have to hold her up and just hope that stuff comes out and she

2610
04:32:56,900 --> 04:33:04,340
doesn't get messy. But you know, I'll do anything for her. I love her so very much. I would move

2611
04:33:04,340 --> 04:33:11,940
heaven and earth for my baby Fia to be okay. So thank you so much for the $50 tip. A lot of the,

2612
04:33:11,940 --> 04:33:16,740
like again, I said it earlier, but like I do stream full time. All of your tips,

2613
04:33:19,300 --> 04:33:27,780
some people think that it's 80% goes to be a lure and 20% us. I get 80% of my earnings

2614
04:33:28,340 --> 04:33:36,100
and 20% goes to be a lure. And then 80%, I stream full time. So it literally, it goes back to me

2615
04:33:36,100 --> 04:33:39,540
and it goes back into my projects, like I have a project I'm working on and I commissioned.

2616
04:33:40,260 --> 04:33:46,420
But I hope you guys enjoy at some point. And like the art I get, and also just like paying

2617
04:33:46,420 --> 04:33:50,260
my bills and taking care of my cats and feeding me. So thank you for allowing me to live.

2618
04:33:50,980 --> 04:33:54,340
I appreciate you for allowing me to live.

2619
04:33:56,500 --> 04:33:59,700
All the tips go directly to Shibi's rant, taking care of Fia.

2620
04:34:00,340 --> 04:34:04,740
Yeah, I love you for being honest, but yeah, like we're pretty transparent and honest.

2621
04:34:06,180 --> 04:34:09,700
But if you slay management with a big, must be played again, 100%.

2622
04:34:10,500 --> 04:34:14,580
Now I love my management team. They're great. They're cool peoples. They really are. They're

2623
04:34:14,580 --> 04:34:21,460
very helpful. They literally just let me do whatever I want. And then when I need help, they're

2624
04:34:21,460 --> 04:34:26,740
just like, do you need help with this? And I'm like, yes, please. Do you need me to make this

2625
04:34:26,740 --> 04:34:31,460
thumbnail? Yes, please. Do you need me to put up your waiting room for you because you're with

2626
04:34:31,460 --> 04:34:42,260
your cat? Yes, please. Stream elements, yeah, stream elements. This takes away a lot less than

2627
04:34:42,260 --> 04:34:49,620
YouTube. And then the fans, Lee, I'll be getting 100% of when I start. I mean, the blue website.

2628
04:34:51,780 --> 04:34:57,540
But I'll be, honestly, I think people are going to think I'm going to do like crazy stuff. I'm

2629
04:34:57,540 --> 04:35:02,580
probably just going to, you guys saw, if you go there, you'll see what I'm going to be doing.

2630
04:35:02,580 --> 04:35:08,500
I'm tired and I'm rambling right now. I'm trying to see, I don't think she started yet.

2631
04:35:10,100 --> 04:35:14,660
I wanted to throw some sweet, sweet stuff at her.

2632
04:35:16,100 --> 04:35:20,660
Come on, let's wait. Let me double check because I'm like, was that sometimes my stuff doesn't

2633
04:35:21,620 --> 04:35:24,660
load properly? Oh.

2634
04:35:27,300 --> 04:35:30,180
Ooh, she's doing a vampire made ASMR?

2635
04:35:34,180 --> 04:35:34,740
Oh my.

2636
04:35:41,780 --> 04:35:48,340
Wait, but it's a member. Oh, that's why I can't read into it. Was I gifted a membership?

2637
04:35:48,740 --> 04:35:54,100
Why am I able to watch this? Okay, well, I have to read somebody else then.

2638
04:35:56,340 --> 04:36:00,180
I might have must have been hit with a membership because I'm like, wait, why can I see this,

2639
04:36:00,180 --> 04:36:07,620
but let me read into it. Oh, I'm going to read Pippa. I've never read a Pippa before. I'm

2640
04:36:07,620 --> 04:36:12,260
terrified to read Pippa, but I'm ready Pippa. Everybody say hi to Pippa. Just do, just scream

2641
04:36:12,340 --> 04:36:16,420
mortis. Just be like, mortis, mortis, mortis. Just do that. Thank you.

2642
04:36:19,780 --> 04:36:21,940
I'm sorry. Oh my God.

2643
04:36:27,140 --> 04:36:33,780
Thank you, Dr. Adon. Thank you. Thank you so much. Me too. I hope she recovers soon. It will take

2644
04:36:33,780 --> 04:36:38,820
some time, but she's tough. She's been through it before. She's a tough kitty. She's the toughest

2645
04:36:38,820 --> 04:36:43,780
kitty I know. Her and Reina are very tough. Reina especially. She's like a bag of old bones.

2646
04:36:43,780 --> 04:36:48,260
She just like flies around my house. But thank you guys so much. Oh, speaking of the devil,

2647
04:36:48,260 --> 04:36:57,540
she just hopped on my lap. So yeah, read her and say mortis. Okay. Bye. Bye. Later.

2648
04:36:57,540 --> 04:37:04,260
And you guys around stinky.
