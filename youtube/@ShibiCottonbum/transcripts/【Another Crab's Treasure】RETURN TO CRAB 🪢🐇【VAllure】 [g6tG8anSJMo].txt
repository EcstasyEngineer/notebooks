Kind of just blocks me out, so I took off the the noise suppression one
Bit cringe in you, bro. Oh

Let's see if I can find it
Somebody give me a song to sing while I look for this

We're getting done
YMCA young man
There's no need to be down. I said young man
Don't know the lyric afterwards young man
Something something something
It's fun to say the YMCA
Oh, I need to type it's I can't type and take it the same time
mascot
Why am CAA? Oh?
Can I download this?
Cool, it's fucking good, mate
Holy guacamole you guys are huge
All right, harem oh
Crap
No, I looked at the viewer count
as I opened the tab
We were count jump scare
So that's you you look so again as
People may not know I didn't hot I did not design the mascot. I did not design she be I was hired on to play
Myself although I am who I am I was meant to be I was meant to be she be my entire life
You know then week before I or
Yeah, like the week before I
Streamed like I did debut I saw rabbits every day outside my apartment never before I'm like the universe is telling me
I'm meant to be a bunny girl, or I meant to be a playboy bunny which one um
But I the moment I saw this I was like this looks like like tuxedo mask or a persona character
And I like it a lot. I think it's cute
Use of the harem and you know what I was like I'm like, oh
You can change your hat
You can change the type of ropes you're wearing if you don't want to have a scarf on because I also like I
Know I do have female viewers you can feminize this you can do like a more feminine mask or like a
More feminine hat, so I just I want you to be able to you know
Mix and match, but that's that's you got you guys look a little mafia bosses. It's a rabbit Junkler for
I
Can't think about persona five. I've actually never played persona five don't come at me
so
But I was trying to think of like some sort of goofy little thing
She'd be representing the 3% female audience so out of curiosity
I was looking to like edit like a description one of the videos because I had like done a typo and
What I
Accidentally ended up doing was seeing the demographic for
Um
Who watches my content and it was 99% men and
1% women so shout out to those ladies out there
This is for the girlies
This is for the girlies
Hair Sona, ooh hair my Sona my hair Sona
One percent is one percent shout out to the five girls in chat. You just know you're loved
You women
Don't say that

Like I'm sorry. I thought you the bros it all be on like reddit or
lively
Lady kumar, but I'm not full kumar all the time am I kumar right now?
No, we're talking. We're having a good time. Yes

Think is dead. I don't know. I haven't been on that site
Live leak would be someone's live tag. Oh, it's as a leak is
Is Azura's NSFW
Hashtag you can't see I'm doing a hashtag with my fingers hashtag
So basically we need second she be outfit to learn more female viewers I
think
strongy and management is like worried about
Applying for monetization because like we definitely have it already
for me and Azura because we get we like ran ads on our shorts just to like to test stuff out and
YouTube took a cent from us, but didn't run the ads
Because of the boobs in the thumbnail bitch because of boobs in the thumbnail bitch
And she be up. Oh, oh
That'd be funny
That would actually be kind of funny like a tomboy outfit. I think I'd like to I'm pretty sure that I
Am I the most tomboyish besides straw knee out of everything? I don't know my kid my my demeanor
But more of the bros, you know
Wow, she'd be such a pick me
There is a smudge on my screen. It's making me look like I have a mole on my face and I look kind of hot with it
So I'm like, hmm
More on my face
Tom-dom ha ha
Bealer shirts aren't everything. I don't cut like so. Yeah, I might have like a thing where my shirts closed
And I'm
It's like I just don't know for the life of them. I just I can't do it right now. I haven't heard her today
I just can't for the life of me
Fathom why they wouldn't run ads and they took a cent and I'm like mom
Momay, they I have a ball gag the only time I can be advertiser friendly if it's if I'm like this
Oh shit, I'm close. Oh, hey, that's finally work. You took me three hours to set up the stupid thing yesterday
Let's see, I'm gonna look over right there
So it looks like I'm saying your names above my head
I'm not that see I'm not I was in chorus when I was younger and we had to
Sing what's it called? Um, we did a lot of Disney songs. So I know a lot of Disney songs
And we did under the sea in kiss to go

She don't got a lot to say but there's something about
Oh, I can hear myself what the hell gross oh
Jesus Christ jumpscare
Under the sheebie, okay, where did my I have to plug in my DualSense controller
Oh my god, this is my favorite Titanic song. Oh, are you ready kids?

Just so you know
Just so you know I'm gonna cut out
What why are you laughing
Did it did it get like crunchy in the end? Yes, it suppressed as you said
Can you try whispering
You can't hear me scream the cutout screams. I don't think this is a horror game
How about whimpering
Did it pick out up this first cutout oh look
Suppression level all right suppression level. What is that?
How about this how about this?
Wow, how would you be streamed today? Oh, but it was great
We just sat for 30 minutes and she talked about nothing and we distilled didn't help her fix her microphone
Okay, but if I
Did it cut me off though did it cut me off
You can still hear me. Are you sure are you positive? No, you hear it. No
What the screams are fine. No. Yes. No, you guys are not helpful
No, no cutting off. Oh no cutting off
Okay, whatever the fuck. It's cool. We ball
The mic peaked. Okay, cool

Holy crap. What's wrong with your eyes? I haven't been sleeping or oh god get the way for me
I'm not gonna fight you. Oh, there's so fucking many of them
Oh
Climb climb ha ha you bitches can't climb can you you?
Oh wait, you kind of can uh, no, you're just big
All right, I hope I don't miss anything back there if I did
She's a rager. It's funny. I used to not be rager until I started playing souls like games
But I like the rage from a souls like game. Although, you know, I would rage when I played like cotton stuff
Or like counter strike. Oh, I was so toxic when I played counter strike
I was bad
I was one of those bitches in the lobby that would try to talk like a little boy
So people wouldn't be like is that a girl? Huh going to kitchen
Ooh
Is this my weapon?
I guess I couldn't hurt to have a way to defend myself
This thing's here. I can't talk
If anyone else attacks me, I guess I'll poke him with the pokey bit
Might as well give this bad boy a few practice swings
Found a rusty fork
That suspiciously sounds like the call of the lamb
Thing when you
Like upgrade something attack charge attack
Oh, okay
And this is block. I wonder if I can parry
Please rage on us if you insist. I stopped playing multi games because I raged so much I wasn't able to sleep
Black ops 6 looks actually good. Yeah me and strawnee and a zero are like do we cop? Do we cop and we play?
Because like come on imagine me and azura and strawnee playing
That that'd be funny as fuck
How do I
Can I
Uh, I don't maybe I loop around
R3 to focus on enemies
All right
No, I'm pressing the wrong thing. Oh
Uh now how do I heal? Okay
Sounds like content
Going for fours of six and ever I play like a little bit of fours of an xbox grown up
I
Boy at hands if you play this kind of games or all the same level of skill in your line for a lot of fun. I
Used to I remember I got like
one of my
I play a lot of uh the
Battle royale, whatever the Frick version. Um
Of like the latest caught or like
Whatever and
I got like a golden
Gale like two days because there's no life to fuck out of it
I keep pressing trigger instead of r1
She may congratulate debut
Hold on
Hello sweet rain
Hope you're doing well
You may plus love
Warzone yes, thank you. Uh, yeah, I know life's warzone
I used to play fortnight, but I was just shit at building like my my my baby cousins. They're like, um
14 and 10 now they
smoke me in fortnight
And it's hilarious
Like like this like little 10 year old boy
Like I'm like, is there I'm telling my aunt. I'm like, can you put these kids like one of those like esport colleges?
Like this is ridiculous
I remember when I first started streaming in general. I used to be a fleshy. Um, I wanted to go pro and
Counter strike real bad
Because I was like, oh, I'd be sick to be like a female pro counter strike player
But I was not good enough
That's for sure. What is this? Can I hit it? Why is this pretty sick looking?
All right, no explanation for that. That's cool. Nice
Yeah, I know like they're like I'm doing 90s. Um, blah, blah, blah
I liked I played a lot of fortnight when it first came out and people didn't get the meta yet
About how building is super freaking helpful and they would just build
Pathetically, no, it's great. I miss those days
Whoa, what is that thing?
The current starts getting warm close to this platform. It's kind of comfy. I like I'm skipping every other word
Maybe I caress my feet here. He isn't
So you have feet
for a little while
Where are oh he has like
feet and then he has
Excuse me
He has a little feet that I guess he just doesn't use and then he has
Like one of them is like more raised. What's what's up with that?
Is that one like higher than this one? And then I have my little booty tail that
Hermit crabs used to like hold onto their shell. How many
Legs do crabs have? I don't know. I eat them, but I don't know
Oh
Oh moonshow
Nice out of 10 don't summon the feet bros
Cave of respite, I like the damn this game is so beautifully like it's just so aesthetically pleasing to me
Poppers and moonshows and my classic
Okay
Alrighty
Give me that. Well, do I have enough? Oh, I need okay. Oh
MSG hands, this is the damage of umami based attacks. Oh
Oh, yeah, so I don't have stuff yet. Okay. I thought I could just confirm to exit as well, but that's not the case
Is anybody am I gonna get like a explanation for like the lore of the moonshell?
No, all right
I don't know where I came from. You'll also learn that what the fuck is that?
Oh, it's him. I don't know why it looked like a bird to me. Um
And I'm I have a terrible sense of direction. I get turned around a lot
Too many legs six spiders in the sea
I
There's a dark souls mode and the options
I don't know that
You're lying. You gotta be lying
shibuti
As mommy based attacks
Go clean your room. I can't believe you got a b on your homework instead of an a
Mommy face attacks are perfect for Zara
Uh, I want to watch a Zara game. She's a great gamer. She kicked everybody's asses in uh among us
although
I kicked ass
in
Quiplash like one time I forget who won the most was a mercy that one more or was there Zara again
Who's the funniest?
Come on, man, there's gotta be something I can do
Yeah, now that you mentioned it, I can think of something drop your pants. Just kidding. You're not weighing any pants
You can lick my freaking ventral fins and stop bothering me
Lay the kid you can suck my two-headed cock
Well, this guy
sir's cracked
I was like so I watched everybody's two point os
And I just love listening to his airs voice and I was falling asleep listening to mercy because mercy also suits me
The fuck is this music
Ayo, is that my mouth? Oh, it's my heart inside my chest
Huh, it's very interesting that that's there. That's the asset
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't say your type leaving the type pool too often
Yeah, well, I didn't have a choice. Can you tell me what's going on here?
I heard like there's a duchess in charge now
Yep, sure is real piece of work takes all my hard-earned micro plastics every tie just for existing around here
What do I see for it? Nothing just keeps building up her castle and hiring more soldiers to defend it
Oh, that's cool. Where can I find her? I think she has something in mind
So that's when I thought you're getting brand new models the day after debut
Why?
Why would you think that?
That's not gonna happen
Mommy put so much time and offered her money into these models. Oh my god. You guys don't even know the half of it
Kind of freeloader area, but you think you skirt your taxes while the rest of us keeps the side together, do you?
You just said
You hermit crabs are all the same wearing the shells the rest of us worked so hard to create with our own mantles
That's a good point. You gotta stayed in your tide pool small fry
Yeah, well how's about something I do something to you
Oh, oh shit, what the
Oh
Oh, I just fucking killed that guy, holy
Siegel breeze season
Okay
Killed him forked him fork you

Oh, no, fuck you. I don't want to talk to you right now. Can you come up here? Oh, you can't
Okay, um
Wait, is that like a lure can I like there's plenty of plastics here. There's plenty of trash. Can I grab this?
I'll make my own micro plastics. Oh, this is really sad though
It was probably what the ocean. Oh looks like
I know I should be focusing on them, but I don't really care what that
Oh sick
Off to see the wizard
I'm wondering if there's anything off to the side. What's that?
Is that a shell?
Oh
No, it's just some weird party popper shit
Damn, this isn't big. Can I like go off the beaten track because I'm guessing that little
Little road the little micro plastic brick road is a um
It's like the main quest, but
I gotta what is this called
a
Bicolas sort of a big lighter
Have a fun so far. Uh, I just started

Oh
Anyways
This game is cooler than I expected
I've seen like a little bit of gameplay from this
No, like spoiler. Oh, can I stick my mouth on that?
They're shiny so it means I can interact with them, right?
Just like uh from my spongebob. Oh, what's up there?
Oh
I should be able to platform up there. I just don't know how
If I
Maybe if I we're running start
Nope because I'm like, okay. What if I get up there
And then jump over there, but I don't think so. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother

Of dark souls that I learned the hard way is that you don't have to fight everyone again
I would go through and I would just try to fight people
And I'm like, oh wait
I can just run past you and come back to this later if I really need to talk to you or do this
thingy
What did you say?
We

Okay, I don't need uh, okay fine come on come on

Oh, how did you brother excuse me
Don't don't don't
Check out laughs. Have you beat dark souls one play about that? No
The only game I've beaten is Elden Ring
I remember I played Sekiro and I'm like wow. Sekiro was the first um
Souls like I played I didn't even know it was a souls like I just was like, oh this game is getting a lot of hype
Let me get it and I
I
Was severely mistaken

Oh, there's two in nature. Let's get that's my emmy impression
Just kidding. No, I actually I think if I'd really tried I want to do a stream where I try to do impressions of the girls
I
Think I could do icy's voice. I think I could do emmy's voice
I can't do strongy's voice because I can't get her accent down. I can kind of do Azura's voice
But
Mercy mercy is actually also kind of hard to do I really think about it
I realize if a girl's voice is like higher pitched. I can usually do it easier
I'm just going crazy and
Just talking to myself back ruffians back. I say
You there. I don't suppose you lend a claw to a fellow in need
I dare say I'd die for sure if you don't
Doesn't respond

Who's is don't fucking run away one of you guys come at me
Please

It's kind of like the thing like you know you got to pick and choose your battles. It's okay
I don't
Like I definitely could beat him, but like I just hate running all the way back to get my shit and it's just annoying
I
Would just take a couple of tries
Folded me like a steel chair. I
Admit that is true. Well, there's one of those things up top there
Then I can level up anyways
Hello Krabos
All right, oh fuck you saw me
Okay, he didn't see me
But oh, I hate the crabs
It'll wait on later exactly run
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I'm guessing those are sea urchins and they would hurt me so
It's not fuck with those things
Do you want to like farm a little bit?

Yo, yo, yo
Halt trespasser
By order of the duchess all suspicious characters are to be bored from slack tight
Suspicious
I forgot the voice of them
Suspicious, I thought I looked pretty harmless downright adorable. Huggable even
Perhaps you speak of truth vagrants, but I shalt ne'er grant you entry twix these mighty gates
Whilst thy loins remained unguarded
Ex shucking excuse me
Dude take a hint she says you're naked
Oh, yeah, I guess I hadn't thought about that. Is that important these days?
I feel like society has really moved on without me while I've been practicing self-care
Sure seems like it
The duchess would have our heads if we let you in wearing nothing but a rag
Fret not little crustacean
nearby to the east layeth a repository laden with complimentary commentary
Face the gate you turn right you'll find a cherry center where you get something to wear
Captain is stationed right there now. I think great guy. He'll get you sorted
Sounds cool. Let me in
Assuming nothing sketchy comes up in your background checks. Sure. Just how the fuck are you gonna run a background check on me?
Okay, so I must be past the berserker crap then my hands just went
I have to get drip

Oh, no, I forgot to check on the last popsicle sticks that I saw back near the moon shell
Did you hear about the crab that went to the gym?
He pulled a muscle

I generally can't tell if they're dead or they're just tied to poles
I thought that was the shark dude for a second, but it's just a broom
And that is a gas thing. That's nice
And there's fishies
Uh
Excuse me. Why do you have a ravioli head and the other one had a ramen head?
Oh sick nasty brother
Do-do-do-do

Okay, can I like skip it? Um, although he's an amazing voice actor, but
Wait, where is he coming from? Oh, uh, I usually like to see what their move set is
But I kind of he just swings his thing and then also side dashes and he probably does a charge too. I'm guessing
Yeah, that's a charge

It's a bussy hitting right just right
Fia my beloved
Yeah, Fia Fia's Fia's been through a lot
Um at one point
She had uh recently back in like march
She had some um weird thing going on where
Her legs didn't work at all. She couldn't move
Uh, they still don't know what caused it. They gave her they didn't know if she had some sort of
That she snapped her Achilles tendons. They didn't know if she had some spinal issues. We ran so many tests
They're like, oh, she has like the wobble syndrome and they're like
Then she didn't end up having the wobble syndrome or where you can't like cats can't move properly neurologically
um
and
Then another random like and like so many vets so many doctors were like
What but like they were they had never seen a case like this because like they ran so many tests on her
and my credit card is
Still crying
Because of that, but I will do anything for her. Um, why is the chat so weird? There we go
and um
And then they some random doctor was like, maybe it's toxoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis is like it's a
It's a bacteria or a virus you can get from like usually like pregnant women get it when they like scoop a cat's litter box
Which doesn't make sense to me. Um
But she
Or if you like eat raw meat, it's like the cat equivalent for like salmonella and um
My cat had that when she had an infection on the bone's intertail. Oh snap. Wow. I hope your cat's okay now
um
And so they're like to give her some antibiotics and so they did
And it worked
And she can walk and it's great
It's freaking amazing now she can she's still working on jumping because she's building up her confidence again
Because she couldn't move for like a month and a half
I carried her around in her little cat bed and I had to like hold her up to use a bathroom and stuff
It was very sad, but she's a good she's she's zooming everywhere now. She's my baby
She's like you might hear her screaming at some point because she likes to play with a little spring toy
And she gets really excited and she be house with it
But yeah, she's good. She's good. Don't worry about it. Um, she's I usually I have a cat bed on my desk
And her boomy and rena will sometimes lay in the cat bed
And so I usually I like to have a cat cam up so you guys can see the cats and then I can also like
flip you off um
in the
On camera, um, so yeah
At least she has you as a caretaker. Yeah, I'm very devoted to my animals
I growing up I almost became a veterinarian
but um
I was a slacker
I slacked
Wait, did did management finally tweet out that we have merch?
Hold on
Hold on, but yeah, don't worry about the donation thing so you can always support through patreon
um, patreon is also in the description below if uh, you can just throw five bucks my way and
Again, you don't have to consume what's on the patreon if you're not into that
But if you're like I want to help out or you know like comment subscribe
Wait or is it did they tweet I will retweet
I just I know I'm weird and I prefer Twitter on mobile
Oh
Why can't you mean no okay, they did oh crap
But um, yeah anything you guys donate uh, or like if support honestly just you just being here is support enough for me to be honest
um
But that goes towards my dream of buying my own house and having an animal sanctuary and also paying all my debt

That party last night was awfully crazy
I miss your day, but don't feel pressured to buy like I don't want you to be like wow
You know Dami mommy she be was said I had to buy her merch

Do not give me your money
And also make sure you support the other girls as well
Guilty us now or no no no no buy buy my merch. I'll be homeless. No, I'm fine again. Remember guys. I have a job

Not a fan of that
That's why I'm like only get what you can don't feel pressured
If you can't give it all just like comment retweet spread word of my
Terribleness to other people. I somebody's tell me that
In my maros that they're like, oh, yeah, I showed my my stream your stream to a friend and I'm like

No, and then that person left a mirror. I was like, thank you. No, no the same person
somebody showed the stream to them and they were like
They left me a really nice message about how I reminded them of someone that they used to be close to in the past and it was nice
And I was just like, oh, I'm happy I could touch that person in a different way than I would normally touch people
What that sounds?
predatory
We went from we want fdom not fdom in this one
Just a little sus. Don't worry about it. She loves us. I don't love you
debatable
Yeah, I have to tell myself that or I'll get parasocial
base take actually
You can't get a pair of social guys
She hates us. I totally hate you. I hate you so much
You know what
Oh, okay. I think I'll stream it for a little bit longer
But if you I know like I think stronti is still streaming
But if you also want to watch
Amy when she starts streaming
Feel free to again. No pressure support all the girls all the girls deserve them the most
Law breaker. Oh
I don't know why I sound like prince. Am I blind?
Oh
I am blind
I pressed the right thing I will tell you that much
Bro, I'm
I don't
It might be me
But I don't like the timing of because I'll press I think the animation of me hopping in the shell
Like I have to do it before
No, I don't ma I'm not winning. I'm doing terrible
I tended to leave stuff because I'm about to say something parasocial
Bro, I get it. I totally I remember
When so I worked from home for a little while. I'll tell
Trigger it after I tell my story
And I like was very agoraphobic didn't leave my house for six months. Well, I um, I was like real neat
Hickey morey neat girl. Um
And so I just watched this one vtuber
Well, I watched multiple vtubers, but I was like, oh my god
I want to be her friend. She makes me so happy
My god, she's my oh she so like I get it. I totally get it
Like everybody wants that sort of
connection
He has never known defeat
Yeah, timing I'm still getting used to the timing
I think if I put him up against like the

Oh
And he also does the fucking back kick too though
Oh, is my game lagging no, well, I'm already fucked
I'm already fucked
Can I just give me a moment
Give me a moment, please for the love of god
I like bugged out for me to wear the shell
Oh, yeah, no, like
I'm trying. Let's go parasocial. Yeah parasocialism has its pros and cons because obviously it gives you something
but it takes stuff away because um
Yeah, you then you remember. Oh just a person on the internet
Playing a really cute anime buddy that makes you
Um
But
Like but it's totally natural to want to develop a relationship with someone that you have similar interests with and
But it just like
Understanding like oh, you know, I might I will never probably meet them
I never
Can have that sort of thing. Yeah, it's hard
I I I'm pressing circle. I'm pressing circle for the love of god. I'm pressing circle
I hate
Oh, don't back kick me, please
I hate that straw, dude. Why am I getting ganked by a straw?
Should be his tongue fellow
That's on my side. Why are you talking on that?
Why is he still talking?
Do you have tongue physics? I I can stick out my tongue. That's it
But I think it's funny because
artists never rendered the tongue
So I guess how about pink tongue?
You know what I should fucking do I should uh, I really should level up but
Yeah, I'm uh, I'm someone who falls so hard like
Like tomah said
Like when I care about someone I care deeply like the girls I'm like, I love you
You're my best friends now and they're like girl. We just met now. I'm kidding. They're just like me us too
We're all just fucking parasocial towards each other
My game is lagging a little bit. I just have to get them running in a circle and then
And then when he does that, okay
Some attacks are unblockable agro attacks
Signaled by the agro symbol that appears above krill. Can you see it? Be sure to dodge run or jump out of the way
Okay
If it's parasocial we're all doing it to each other
Can't escape para especially not in this industry you can knowledge. Yeah. Yeah
Girls of great chemistry. We do I know like, um
Some companies probably may not have that because some people like see
That as like, uh, fuck hitting it. I mean with enough tech smack out the balance. We never know. We capsize now starts to flash
Okay, so it's like a
Okay
Oh, please
I
Fucking up
Oh, I like I don't know why the fuck
That happened but it did
Huh, I like the artwork. Okay. It's fine
Now we know what to do. I think I was starting off while the freaking
Dialogue boxes that just shy to show up
Yeah, yeah, I got I got the strut I got the strut struts there struts all there
All right, bitch
Oh my god
Oh, you want to come get this crap busty so bad. Oh my god, you want this crap busty?
What the fuck was that?

Holy shit that flings me back. Okay
Oh, no

Oh, this is not a good show
Oh fuck
Oh

Dude's giving you hella bot backshots. Yeah, not even the good good good way. This is a backshot roulette
It's fun to be a little parasocial but as a viewer, I don't want to come off like I don't understand boundaries
It's funny because tomorrow I have a drunk asmr stream and spoiler
It's where I go take you on a date and I'm just really drunk
So, uh, enjoy
Because I'm a lonely
wine hag
In the role play I usually don't drink but I'm gonna go out and grab some stuff to make um some mixed drinks

The fuck am I supposed to get up there?
Oh, not platforming. Oh not platforming my worst enemy
Oh, what the fuck, you know a game I used to really love and this is reminding me of it a little bit
Like bare minimum just because it's I'm like wall
Running although wall crabbing
Uh titanfall I fucking loved titanfall
Play this shit out of titanfall. I wish I'm sorry, but fuck like I hate apex legends like I hate apex legends
Apex legends took another titanfall away from me. Um, I like
titanfall 1 and 2 I've played both I recently titanfall 2
um
And I really I like the plot of titanfall 1 though
Timefall 2 had amazing. Yeah timefall 2 had amazing multiplayer and then I like destiny because destiny reminded me of titanfall
And then destiny's gone to shit
And like I put so many hours into destiny like I just played um
I was playing recently like a little bit last year
The not the recent like not the final shape
But not the one before that one either
Because I went in the game and I was just doing like the normal like I was replaying old plot and I'm like
What the fuck happened to this game?
You want me to pay 60 dollars to be able to use
A dumb ass power like I was so irritated
Not no, I will not bungee will never get my money
I'm so tired like I I used to love overwatch. I loved overwatch
But then
Like this the loop box shit and the micro transactions and I'm like and then games are just being so
Expensive for no you can't I wish you guys I need a 3d model because I'm very animated with my hands
And you guys can't see how much I'm moving my hands
um
uh, but
it's
I just get so far I'm like, why do you want me to pay this much money to play a game that's already out?
It's just a dlc and it's 60 bucks
The only excuse I'd give that to is elden ring. I don't know how I don't know how much elden ring
Erie tree one is gonna be though
No fans, but they said destiny 2 would get its root back last three. Yeah, no that that game is
Shit shite fellow hand talker, of course
Oh what the fuck look at this little animation
That's so adorable
What the hell um
Oh
Wait, can I can I have that?
I'm a balder skate
Like it's weird because
I
love fantasy
And I thought I would really like balder's gate
I've never played balder's gate. I had never played diablo and I like diablo
I'm usually not good at like or like
Not like not good, but I don't like turn-based games. I realize
um
In like party management and like I like the story like if I could just run around like a skyrim and just like
Gang people that'd be cool. But I think because it wasn't what I like. I literally have balder's gate three sitting on my ps5
Because I bought it and I played like three hours and I got nowhere
And I'm like, when do I get to fuck a starion? Like I just want to fuck a starion
the vampire dude
Who apparently is the also the voice of hyzenberg?
From a resident evil village. Hello
What I'm playing on easy difficulty
Uh, sorry about 20 20 77
Yeah, sorry about 27 7 redeemed itself. Good great game. Great game pan am
hell yeah
Did can I have that? Oh fuck, you know what? Give me that
I don't know where the fuck that came from
But like
I won't lie to you
I love fps's, but I haven't played any like I haven't played cod or black ops and I haven't played um
Valorant and I haven't played like because everything's just so different and I just
I just can't
Stand them anymore and I'm like because I played like I played counter strike. Um
Oh, come on. I played the newest counter strike and I'm like, no this doesn't feel the same like I don't
I don't like it
It just felt whatever
And everything I'd like it was like games used to be so much more simple
But now with like skin like like oh like the counter strike definitely introduced like the concept of like
skins and like it was literally its own little
system
Little stock market. I know that for a fact because I spent thousands of dollars on stuff, but yeah
Staring as the hardest romance
Difficulty just track through one
But I pretty sure I had it on easy mode because I like usually I'll play a game on easy mode
I'm not afraid. I'll say it. I'm a little bitch
Um when it comes to games that I don't know so I'll usually play stuff on that
That
It caused generational trauma to my imaginary fit. What?
My friend group more like half-life pvp enjoyers to gorgeous. Yeah, I never I played a lot of gary's mod
I never played team fortress. I'll be honest with you

Am I wrong am I wrong or does that thing get stopped by the wall and then it just didn't do it that time
I don't know why people would want to subscribe after that but go off this
It is a souls game bugs are features and so it's like that is so
That's funny as fuck
I can't even get mad because it's funny like if I was watching that and you just like I'm like oh, I just get
Oh, this is funny
It's funny
I
Because it stops like right there
Oh
Ha ha bitch oh
It wasn't supposed to stop right there
It was supposed I wasn't supposed to try to spider-man my wake. Okay. See I'm not bad at games
That was not supposed to be the mechanic to get up there
It was supposed to go by so I could walk up
Oh my god
This game's killing me, but in a good way. I like it
Oh shell, are you okay? I can't believe I dropped it. I'm so stupid
I one job and it was oh, it's your fucking fault
Yeah, he he we had a date and he fucking stood me up your captain we were supposed to battle and you just left
Skip the boss we get slowed down on the stairs, but then it just oh my god, I can
I
Was so like I was so ready to fight that boss too. I'm so mad
But I'm like happy, but I'm mad. Was that a marshmallow?
Do I get a little hat?
You're telling me I could put this on my booty cheek, but
Am I got that cut pussy?
But um, but I couldn't wear that snail shell
Barnacle
Oh, that's cool
Damn you get on a lot of stowaways right off the bat. I wonder if that's normal
Oh, okay
It's for attack vitality. Oh, I see how that works and then you can get more and promote. I'm oh, I didn't mean to do that
Ooh
Oh, okay, so it's either one or two in this and that
defense
I'll do that. Yeah
Doesn't uh
I need to go to a moon shell. What the fuck
What is this?
Drop I don't want to drop. Where am I dropping?
Did you say something to me hand-pressed and then make it a bit as interesting as I were
Can you be favorite?
Yeah, sure thing chicken wing
What's that do
Now we're gaming
Gotta go. Oh, of course. Bye
If you guys you leave you to watch how cute Emmy is totally understand
She might be like looking some of your ears right now or something. I think she's ASMR today
Oh
So that's the re oh
Okay, so if I fall I climb up
So if I didn't drop that I

presume
All right, all right
We're here we're vibing
I feel like if I touch that it's bad. So I'm not gonna
I
Must be like oil wait, what's that there's cool stuff up there
I mean down there. I'm sorry
Excuse you
Give me your micro plastics
Oh, I wonder if I can just like jump down
I probably can
I'm tempted but then I have to do all this shit again, but I don't really care too much
What that
I don't know what the shell means
Oh, it's pretty cool
Oh
Can I like
Oh, I thought I could like
The fuck I wasn't locked on
Can I have that?
Ew, I don't know what that does
I'm more into drunken bunny ASMR
You're just gonna see how much of a babbling idiot I get
Is there
Is that where the cave is supposed to be I thought or is that someone else
An effort to recover his home the plucky hermit crab ventures to a mysterious cave
But he quickly discovers that return journey will be significantly more challenging
Hello, who's talking he approaches the ghostly figure in front of him
I like that
I'll be different from now me good. Hey, let me just
And then getting banned
Oh shit
Well, I have the nail so I already have a tack up. Okay. I'm good for now. Yeah
Or I can put because I got a small but the can can get hit so
Yeah, that's fine. Oh, you're so cute
Who's talking
Hi, um, my name's krill. Do you know anything shiny in this cave?
Something that might like impress a huge beautiful crab lady
Yeah
Confused and desperate the hermit crab begins begging help from strangers
Hey, I'm not desperate
yet
Thus far he is preserved persevered by taking refuge in artifacts from beyond the waves
But to survive here from here on out. He must awaken the currents inside of him
He must access the power of
a mommy
A mommy
Mommy, sorry
You know the voice acting crazy in this game
I mean drunk funny content and some of the best
I'm looking at a bite. I'm looking at a bite
Wiggles eyebrows
You mommy I'll stop
Food wars rough should get out of here food wars is so weird. I'm like I
I really like food related enemies and I was watching it and like I'll fall asleep to that
But sometimes I'll like wake up and people will have their clothes off and I'm like
Why am I
Why
Never I'm not gonna finish that joke
What
What the shell was that I feel tingly
The hermit crab crab dawns a metal shell and feels a new ability awaken
I do
Yes, he does
While wearing a shell press book to consume umami charges an evaporating new shell spell. Oh, that's cool
Oh
Shell shock or fizzle that's so cool
Can I talk to you again?
So what's this umami stuff exactly the hermit crab continues into the cavern excited to make the use of its new ability
Uh
This is like I'm not gonna fucking talk to you
I
Creature blocks the hermit crabs path immune to his physical attacks. It may only be dispatched by his newfound umami powers
Well, isn't that convenient?
The noble moons now denies any involvement in manufacturing the scenario
How do I is it really seemed to me
Oh when it touches me
It just
Oh, that kind of sucks actually it has it has to hit me to be affected
The one's innocent hermit crabs ability to slaughter his enemies has increased dramatically
Did you have to put it that way
Your voice is so nice for how dorky you are
You wanted a dummy mommy you got a fucking nerd
Are you supposed to like charge the shell and then block? Oh
My model's lagging, but you're probably right. It's probably probably blocking
When I have my controller plugged in I have to have run my model off of my wi-fi and so
I'm gonna move in slow motion for a bit
He senses that the reward he seeks lies further within this cavern
As well as the opportunity to meet his newfound idol the mysterious and attractive moons now in the flesh
Guess I have no choice
I kind of wish I gave the moonsail a dorkier voice than like a hot
Lady voice pop off interesting
Keeping the shelf for now because of the defense, but I do want to oh look at the sea anemone anemone
um
He can just to play around the stuff. Ooh
Don't fall into the abyss
Can I okay
Sometimes I keep pressing l1 sort of I don't like that it does that that it sometimes it gets stuck and doesn't climb up
And I have to wiggle around
Whoa
Why am I getting beat up by this stupid thing
Eep
Oh, it's on the games. I like it. I like it
Uh, you guys can let me know if you'd like me to continue this. Otherwise, I'll probably just like play by myself
If you guys like watching this
Me trying to dumbly figure out a game
What the hell
Hmm
Do I want to try to get over there
Because I'm just gonna get caught. Yeah, I'm just gonna get caught in a stupid net weird net bug
All right
I'm coming for you
I'm pressing the wrong. Oh god. Oh god
Abraced r2 again instead of r1
I
Whoopsies
What's that
Oh the charges my umami question mark
Wait
Can I guess I can
I
Don't need to fight you
Oh, I see there's like little parts where I actually can't climb up. What the hell
That was a weird ass noise that crab man
The animation for the grappling is pretty pretty sick
Okay, that makes a lot more sense now because I'm like, why can't I wait, but I just did it right now
I'm confused
Oh
What the fuck just happened
I'm so confused
I just fell into nothing twice
I thought it was gonna drop me
Back at the moon
That was so weird and then the can fell that I had I wanted to have two cans up there just in case
Oh my god, I don't
And I have to use a stupid shell shock one. All right. Come on, bitch
Oh
Look at me. Look at me. I am de-captain now. I am de-captain now
Get absolutely fucked
What is that is that a button

I don't want to log into tiktok
No, where's the where's the thirst cam?

So you can scream my name as loud as you need to sugar. I think that would be good just like a
Southern mommy dom's you
You can ride me and scream my name, you know, I think that'd be pretty nice
Do that for a patreon audio I have a an ASMR script I have like lying around that's just um
Wait, can I
Oh
Sick if I fall I don't have to go all the way back. Okay, that that makes a little bit more sense. Okay
Wait, uh-huh

I don't know what I was saying, but uh, yeah, no, I have a uh
Southern bell ASMR that I wrote um where the
I play naturally the love interest. Um, wait if I let him will he just spawn them for me if I just go idle

So
Honestly, yeah, actually I haven't asked like what do you guys have for like feedback for me by the way like, you know
It's only my third day out here
If you want to be honest if you want to be like, hey, she be
You could improve on this or your gameplay sucks. I already know that though or
If you have any recommendations, you can always send me recommendations for games in my murals
Fiat isn't a good conversationalist all my cats are Siamese. They don't shut up so
Yeah
Good burps keep them coming burp better. All right, uh two sides of that coin right there
I'm pretty proud of myself. I got through not far in the game
You're less dummy mommy than I would have liked I get that a lot
um
I don't know how I can
Be more dummy mommy
on
the internet
Like besides like obviously in like my patreon. I could be like get on your knees and take the strap but like
If I'm playing a game
like another crab stretcher
I want to be like
Slams you against a wall
grabs you by the throat
You're my little discord kitten. Aren't you aren't you the
Peasiest stupidest little bitch. I hate you because like all I could do is like insult you
That's the extent of what I can like I could be like
Get on your knees
Although I actually do have a crop
my crop go
I have
I have a riding crop that looks like denticle to the one that I'm holding
So if you misbehave
But this will be for membership streams
God for bitches and tommon it will play your crab souls like
I got this and she be
He's
You guys are fucking with me um
And what else do I have I have this
I also have a cat paw one
I also have a ball gag that I got keep the little heart one from throne
Thank you guys so the people who've given me throne gifts because what I want to do is like
Eventually when donations work
like you could be able to like
pay
To have me do stuff
like oh
for 10
Five dollars I can gag she be for five minutes and she has to put the bell gag on or um
Uh
I know that's like subby
But I think it's funny because then I can try to talk with it on and then try to keep streaming
Um, and then for the crop I could just I don't know saw my ass with it
I don't know if I'd be allowed to do that on youtube
I meant slap my hand because that's what I'm doing right now
Slapping my hand play blood born
I want to play blood born, but I don't have a capture card. I mean, I totally have a capture card. What are you talking about?
um
Like twitcher deems. Yeah, like because what I miss about twi- like I really liked redeems. I hope at some point that youtube
does
Something similar because that'd be fun
Um, honestly, you're doing great. It feels like you've already become comfortable in your new skin dealing with us. Yeah streaming
I I could easily like streaming is so fun. I love streaming. It's not hard for me to stream
It's not hard for me to yap and talk at you. I'm not like I could be a shy person on my hand is red from
slapping this um
But uh, that's usually like outside of streaming and in streaming I can be
I feel like I'm more myself when I'm streaming
um, so I like I I take the opportunity during streams to beat myself
And I hope youtube gives this gumbo currency
Streams of jjk chapter leaks. I don't know what that is
You're very active while playing games. It's hard youtube is engine the way to be a streamer folks
Yeah, which is nice and they're doing like I don't like tick-tock related shit with like the forts and stuff
um, I haven't put it on any more shorts because again, we want to be able to put ads
I'm not ads, but like run
put money into them
but they keep getting nuked because of my
My uh, yeah, so I don't know if I'll be able to get monetization or my first few streams might be demonetized because of my
bitties
I don't know I could be totally wrong
I
Like that a leash has physics
Are you a good puppy or are you a bad puppy because if you're a bad puppy
I don't know if you'll like it when you know, you're a bad puppy. I'm not hitting you with this. It's going up your ass
I
Not me waiting for a ribbed sweater. Yeah, that'd be cute like a cute little like I would love that for like a fall outfit. Um

Ball sculpting rope
What does that mean ball ball sculpting
What do you mean by ball sculpting
Oh
Yeah, well those will be like patreon
Stuff, you know, uh, it's interesting in it. I feel kind of bad because so like
I've recorded three months of scripts. We were all given I think like
Um
A couple months worth of scripts
And I recorded like three months worth and so people are like, oh my god
I can't wait for this audio and I can't wait for this audio and I'm like
Some of them yes have already been made but some of them
Have not been made but I know strani is taking a lot of suggestions into account. Um
Someone's like, oh
Like I need this audio and I'm like, oh, that's not that's not coming out till next month and I feel bad
Triple back lay out. No, I I recorded a lot in advance
So I would have more time to focus on like us some safer work asmr's too
um and just like some skits
Because I like like I said, I like asmr skits and just like I like dramatic reading and stuff
um
I want to like I've mentioned in my last stream. I want to
Maybe do a podcast as my friend or we just talk about smutty books
That would be really funny
I'm maybe like pre yeah, we're pre-recorded talk about smutty books. I don't know if that'd be allowed
But just fun. Um
She beyond that grinds it. Yeah, again, like I want this to be my full-time job. Um
So I know strong it'd be like, oh, can you do this and I got like I'm I finish it immediately
um
I still I was telling you record
September's audios. I haven't did I record? No, I didn't maybe I'll do that
tomorrow
Perhaps especially because yeah, like I'm streaming every day this week and probably next week
I'm beating you with a frying pan ASMR. I will eat that a meme asmr is coming
It was supposed to be out when we got monetization spoiler
um, but because
Starny is worried about us getting demonetized mean is there right off the bat. We haven't haven't posted it yet
um
But yeah, like those really silly
Uh
Mimi ASMR is I definitely want to do some of those
I just have a thought that considering she loves women fan pictures in her mirror once people start getting merges in me
Yeah, um, I know some people have speculated about my orientation. I'm pan. I don't care what you are
Give it to me. No
Give it to you
um
I just uh
I grew up drawing a lot and learning a lot about art history
And I just love the human form. And so I've just admired all parts of the human form
so I think it's
Uh, women are beautiful. Men are beautiful and handsome women are handsome. They're just nice
Oh, yeah, isn't that cool?
Um, happy crash. You be happy bad
It's I don't really I
I actually don't tell people that you guys you guys are in the know
I don't tell people that I usually keep it by myself because some some people tend to make it a whole
character trait
That doesn't need to be one clavicle. Oh, I love me a good some good collar bones
We got a chance boys
As long as you get enough rest and don't burn yourself out like that
See what you're cooking up for us. Yeah, of course like I
I'm not working right now. I'm currently on leave because of some medical stuff. She's mad. Hannah. She's mentally ill. Yes, uh, whatever. Um
I also just have like chronic pain and all that stuff. So I'm like, let me take a break
I was missing a lot of work and so oh my god, I seem to go on leave because I'm already missing work
I don't want to leave me. Yeah, um
So I don't go back to work
Officially until June 17th, which is my first starting day back
so
I'll probably be streaming every day because like in them like I stream at 4 p.m. Eastern time
So like I got plenty of time to like do stuff in the morning and like relax and again
um
aren't we all uh
I'm a fairy like I just live with my three cats. I like
I'm lonely
So like
I can be a little
a little fairy
And I can miss you guys
because that's why
I'm on here
past my normal time
because I like
to spend time with you
Sorry, the the bun speak um came out
I
Love the crazy cat lady. Woo crazy cat lady asmr would be good. I like that
British kids you just like a like a chop like
Just like a london herb heavily bronze
Just shakes you
That's so funny. Oh, yeah, I was I was like I was talking to my parents
I like oh, how you doing? I'm like, I'm good. Now. I'm like thinking about getting another cat
And my parents are like why and I'm like, I don't know. I'm feeling more lonely and they're like you already have three
What's it gonna be? I'm like, I don't know. So like I got
Boomi so reina could have a friend and then reina hated boomi. So then I got
Fia so boomi could have a friend
But Fia also hates boomi because he's a menace to society. Well, she doesn't hate them. They actually love each other very much
Um, he just likes to chase her around and sniff her ass too much. That's kind of annoying for um, and I'm like, maybe
Fia needs a friend, you know, like everybody needs friends. Everybody needs friends
Don't say a poor boomi boomi like what do you do the other day? He
Fucking attacked my feet. I was like I got out of the shower and he
Has this weird thing where he likes to be held right after I shower. I don't know why he does that
I'm like, oh, maybe he wants me to smell like him or something and he gets really snuggly and purry
So I'll hold him a bit and then I put him down. He got mad and he started attacking my ankles
Everyone needs a friend
Yeah, and you won't be sleeping, chilling, eating. I'm surprised they're not like running a muck right now
Boomi, boomi isn't a crate. I I had to put Fia in a crate for a long time because um
Boomi would try to pounce on her and play with her when she couldn't walk
And so um, I had to for her safety just put her in a crate
But now boomi and reina and fia just like sleeping in it
I didn't know I could crate train a cat, but I crate trained a cat. They're actually all crate trains. So
Cats are really pretty cool. But I like dogs too. I always want like when I get my own house eventually
um save up and all that stuff
off my debts
Um my house I want to get dogs. I really like great piranhas
They're so big and I want to get some like because great piranhas are livestock guardian dogs
and I would like to um
Get some like chickens and goats for the dog to protect and my friend told like taught not told
Taught me but she tells me how she makes like candles from goat's milk
And her candles smell fucking amazing because she does like those like farmers markets and stuff
And I'm like yo what doggie brings you like I like big dogs
Small dogs are yappy. I used to be obsessed with huskies
Cats are cats territorial. Oh, yeah, not really like it really depends. Go smell because they're mentioned
um
I like
I remember I really like feral hounds. I also really like coon hounds like hound dogs. Um
One of my close friends recently had a hound dog that passed and I loved him so much his name was copper
He would be like
He was a sweetheart. Um, I usually I usually don't like um
hound dogs, but
He won me over with his floppy ears and his like he would like almost like purr like a cat when you pet him
He would just be like, um
He just pet him. He's like
It was funny
Yeah, he was he was a nice old man that old boy
um
sweet sweet boy, uh
and
I also want to get a dog because again, like I said, I'm a woman who lives alone
So I would like scary dog privilege for when I go on walks and stuff because I I don't usually I hate
I also have really bad anxiety going outside. Uh, like I said, I was a gore phobic at one point and I feel like if I had a dog
It would be I would have a lot more
confidence
A dog named copper as well. He's rich back. Oh, yeah rich back religion rich bags. Uh, I have the weird talent of being able to
Look at a dog and almost guess it's breed exactly
Because I used to my grandfather got me a dog book a book of dog breeds when I was younger. So I'm very good at um
Identifying rough area. Uh, where I used I like I moved down to my parents house. Um, that was a rougher area
Somebody got decapitated like a block away
That was crazy and a kid got stabbed in the butt in my high school. Um, but
Uh
Where I am now it's a little bit better, but people are rowdy
And excuse me. Yeah
It's crazy out here. He's crazy
Um, yeah, some kid that was like gang violence got stabbed in the ass. Um
And that's good
But I think yeah, I remember I was looking into like dobermans for a long time
Because I was like and then I was like, oh, how much would like an actual
guard dog be
They're like $40,000 and I'm like
What?
Uh, I used to work at a dog kennel
for um protected protective dogs
I hate I only lasted a week because the the way they treated the dogs was terrible. I reported them to um authorities to like, um
Animal control and all that stuff because they were a hundred percent
of using the dogs with uh shot callers and other
Methods to prop to improperly train them for for guard guard dogs a guard gone is only 530
Yeah, I want to get my um my license as well for that
I think it'd be cool imagine the IRL stream where I was taking to a gun range and I'm a good shot too
You know when I was in camp I got a Davey Crockett award because I'm really good with airsoft rifle
Um, but yeah, they had I love Belgian Malinois, um bellmells are so awesome. They're so smart
You know like I I also want to be able to get a dog that I can work like I don't want to take a dog to get bite training
um
Take a yeah, take uh get a dog that can
Like do agility courses and stuff. Um
And they also had like a rottweiler. I think his name was huxley. He was such a sweet boy
He was like, you're such a doofy little guy. I'm like, how are you gonna protect anybody? You're too sweet. Um
And they also had a lot of german shepherds
uh
one of my
co-workers
Could I be your cart top? Sure. You guys are all my little my little dogs
Put you on leashes and put those little puppy masks on you
um
One of my co-workers at that place another big reason why I left one they only lived in like five by six
Kennels like it was so small kennels and that's where they were 24 seven
Unless they were taken out to train and it was bad and they didn't get like walks. They didn't like I wasn't allowed to pet them
couldn't pet the dogs
um
couldn't have any sort of
interaction with them
um
I remember I was almost bit by this really beautiful black long-haired german shepherd calls called her miney when I was giving her her food
She was like and I I know it's because they're trained to do that. They're trained to be
Aggressive, but like it was just not the right way to go about it. Um
I'm pretty hard to be horrified
um
But my we were taken one of the dogs slipped out of their kennel and
Like I said, they're very aggressive
I didn't say I left me. I was like correctly and he
decided like a freaking asshole
to um
Hold on. I'm taking my cat mouth off because I'm
frowning this guy was a piece of shit and I hope he's
fucked up somewhere. Um
he was egging the dog on and
she
Launched at him and tore up his sweatshirt, but his arm would have been gone
uh
Because he was just like trying that I was it was messed up
I was so pissed off and then I reported the company reported that employee
and I dipped um
And you know how I said they lived in only like five by six things
Uh, that's where they peed and they pooped and they ate and so my job was to go in and just clean their pee and their poop
And so I always came home smelling like shit. My mom hated it
I had to get special boots and I had like shock back all her piss and then pick up their dog. It was bad
It was so bad. I hated it there. They're gone now. I'm so happy. They're gone
I'm very passionate about animals
I remember when I was younger I also wanted to be a wolf um conservationist and biologist
and um
run a wolf sanctuary
and so, uh
It's just like when like animals don't have the same
Comprehension as humans and they deserve to be protected. Do they pay good? They did not I think I got paid like 12 dollars an hour
Or less than that like nine dollars an hour
um
But yeah, I was
I've had a lot of interesting jobs in my life. I know I was telling strani about one particular job
That she's like, oh you have to tell
You have to tell your stream about that
And yeah, because I used to I used to be an intern for drama alert
That's all I'll say though. That's all I'll say on it for now. Um
um
Let's get right into the news
and
That's crazy. Oh, yeah, you guys you guys don't know you guys don't know
Um, if you weren't a bunny, what would you be instead?
Does he know
does he know
Where you were hanging I wasn't hanging out with him. I was in a group chat with him on twitter
My job as an intern really all right, uh go out scour the internet
And tell him give me some stories
And it was funny because I was also working with celestia vega at the time
If you don't know who celeste vega is she was one of the zoeberger girls e-girls um
And
We would just I remember just chatting with her and we would just be like, uh, what about this news thing and she was just like
I don't know. I'm gonna be like this news things doing what drama alert is good
He don't need to know
Um, oh my gosh, but oh, yeah, yeah, no, and he was uh very well connected to the commentary community
very interesting place, uh
It's when I first became a vtuber. I almost became
a drama tuber
But I
I wanted and I probably actually might still do this
Not be like report on news, but just um
Do you like synopsis of
creators
Kind of like a like a I know I've been watching
Uh, who was I watching recently? I like was recommended like a rima evan star even star video about like bow the whale
um
And what happened with that and I I just I was really I was like, oh, yeah
Like that's exactly and that's the type of content that used to make was that sort of stuff
If you don't know cook stars to stay that way gossiping stream, I wouldn't be so bad
but like that's like I wouldn't I would only
comment in like
document
Things that happened. I wouldn't
Want to gossip because one I don't like gossip and it's kind of catty
And I'm not one of those types of girls
And I wouldn't want to
Step on people's toes by being like, oh my god, there's person in eezy song you did
And then like all that shit like that's just
I'll leave that to false
In the press new soggy whatever his name is
Yeah, documentary documentary deep dive stuff. Yeah, like and you know like I
You know, it's really funny the people who used to watch my commentary videos
Um, we were like you should do ASMR
Because I talked in a really wispy voice because I wasn't super confident
So I'd be like this time in this community. I would just uh and some people are like, please I'm falling asleep
But I'm also entertained
Please do ASMR
Surprise
I'm doing ASMR
I'm gonna be real hella respectful for that. Yeah, like
I'm not like I'll like I won't lie to you. I watch those
channels
Can I be honest with you right now? Can I be can I be real with you? Let me get real close to
I've only been a vtuber for
Maybe
Six or seven months now
So I had to do a lot of research about the state of the community
So I watched a lot of shitty
Stuff I watched a lot of like drama
Drama alert. I watched a lot of like drama tubers
Um, I had to go back and figure out who the hell marushia was
And why was everybody hating on her because she was dating so-and-so
Like I I did a lot of research
about
The vtuber community prior to being a vtuber
I always I watched vtubers like I would watch clips like I watched shy like I watched like the mainstream people like shy lily iron mouse
Um, I watched them from time to time, but really just clips. I wouldn't sit and watch streams
and um
but
So I did like a lot of freaking research. I don't know like strani was in my interview
She was wary about hiring me for a second because she was confused because she's like you've only been a vtuber for five months
How do you but why do you know so much?
and I'm like
Because I was a streamer for five years before that
And I do a lot of research because I know how to do research and so I know a lot of stuff
So I only have a couple months on strani for vtubing experience, but I love it. It's great
I remember I tried vtubing back when it first popped off in 2019, but um
I uh
I yeah, I had like a v-royd model and I remember editing it. It was really fun
I didn't even have like a character. I she just had a red hair
And like maroon hair and like a purple outfit. I can't remember like tan skin or whatever
um
I dived into the matrix during oh, yeah. No, I do my research. I like to be educated like when something happens
I'm immediately researching it. So like for example, that's a reman even star even star. I don't know perhaps her name um video
I was like
I didn't I haven't watched it yet. I saw the thumbnail and I'm like, oh looks like I have to go back in time and research
on what this was. So I watched like several different videos and looked at different um tweets and was like, huh interesting
I'm a secure. I'm just someone who just loves absorbing information and um
Vtubing is definitely one of my special interests. So I will hyper fixie and try to learn everything there is about it. Um
Yes, I was before this
Yeah, I had so in order to apply to be a lurid you had to have um some sort of experience of streaming under your belt
um
and
The scrawny preferred a long lengthier amount of time and in my interview that's when I was like, oh, I actually
I've streamed five years before that. I've been in content creation for longer
But yeah, but I I went down that rabbit hole
um
But yeah, I like I love deep diving on the internet. Um
Another thing I'm just I they don't they don't know this. I'm just like mercy. I am a
Allude ASMR virgin
Um, I never made
audio content like that before. Um, I
did like I teased a little bit
on stream
for my uh, my past life
And like tried to read like skirting the edge ns of w on twitch
and um
That I was like, but I'm like, you can't corrupt me. I'm already messed up
And the she forgets that the minimum that she said you could apply with was just drawing stuff
And I drew a lot of smut of my character and I commissioned a lot of smut art. I'm like, so um
And in my in my audition, I didn't even do anything
Uh, lewd. I was just like, hi, I'm redacted and this is my redacted for vealer
Can you give us a sample of your ASMR? Well, you'll get that tomorrow
You can wait until tomorrow
Or you can I don't know go to my alt account or whatever
I hoping the alert is a male gen. I'm sorry that will never happen
And strani said it in her exposing vealer. We will not have a male gen
I'm sorry if you want to honestly
There is such
Like I think what will be cool about vealer is that people will be like, oh, yeah, that's right sex house and um
I won't be surprised if like like, uh
Not like needy, but like somebody out there with like a lot of money is like, you know what I want to make a male
um equivalent of vealer, um
But yeah, because people will be like, I know like people probably like, oh male gen because you want to make the content too, but like
um
people some viewers will anticipate like
Interacting like with um
talents from other gents and like
What's unique about vealer is that although we do the content that we do which is ASMR lewd roleplay content
We are also kind of
In the vein of japanese idol stuff because we don't
Talk to guys
And like they're fine and all um
But also like
Like strani said in her exposing me a lure video
uh
She's not a dude
I don't like we can't
We can't the management company
Then strani can't they're not dudes like can't
How are they gonna advise dudes like if they're not dudes, you know, no femme boys
I'll be the the emmy could be your femme boy
Gender bent no
There's death. There's so many lewd tubers out there. So many lewd tubers
There's male lewd tubers that you can find that make that sort of content
So you're not gonna die if you don't get femme boys at vealer
Well, we're on the topic of the old stuff. Do you saw the cursed ass monkey and
I need everyone that yeah, I do
Wait, no, it's long this it's not on this though. Wait, can I
Hold up
I don't know if it's I don't know if it's on this computer
I have a very funny picture of Ed Sheeran
Let's see if I can find it
This might take me a minute, please. Oh, oh shit. What the fuck?
Nope, nope, that's not it
Oh
Guys, don't worry. It's worth it. It's just gonna take me a moment to find
Um, but as for like past life stuff, I'm I'm probably not going to talk about it. I know like, um
I know that
I know that, um, Amy did but
That's
That that's another I'm moving on to a different chapter in my life
So I'm not really gonna brush on it. If you know, you know, if you don't then sucks because my past life was awesome
All right
Yeah, this is a great great image
What is that creature
I
It's Ed Sheeran
Okay, little monkey
All right, let me get rid of that. Um, yeah, we whatever you feel like doing is he coming or is he returning?
Is he returning an iPhone?
This is me every a psycho eyes. Yeah, you know, I don't like I want to know what picture
They took that from like obviously like they just like put his face on this person in an apple store wearing a monkey outfit
But I'm like where's it's like so well deep faked
Um
You do you mind diving into my past life? I'm not really any different to how I am now like my void like I was
I was um cute and funny in my past life
That's really the only difference, but like I did the same things
I'm still the same person. I'm just a little bit more
Dummy
Um
But all my content scrub, you don't you might be able to find a clip somewhere, but I doubt it
um
Capacity of sheebie dunk of
basketball, no
too short
All I think I know about your past level you're supposed to be a brown cat girl, which is like 50% of youtubers. Yeah, literally
Cat girl, that's all you need to know
Can you do some green screens? It's mostly being oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be that'd be actually pretty smart to do
Um, I was thinking about that the other day because I was going through
Like the pictures I post I just take them on my phone
Um and vtube studio on my phone because I've exported my model
And I'm like, oh, I should use the green screen so people can like use them and put them in be like
Put them in silly memes
Same just a dump. Yeah, essentially and then I just make
naughty content
Check out my patreon
Um, can we get black hair sheebie probably do you get past life flashbacks?
Not really like I was a very small creator like I wasn't like emmy or anything. I was very unknown
Um, so that's why I'm even more thankful that I'm here
Like I'm very thankful that
scrawny picked me and nobody to be part of this
Because she saw something in me. She said she saw a 2.0 version of herself and that made me cry when she told me that in the interview
um
But uh, but yeah
Yeah, but
You don't okay, just because you don't have to talk about it
So that's that's the end of it. That's the end of the past life talk
She's she's gone
She's she's been let go
Because I'm determined to
move forward with she be and make vealer
a um
An amazing place. I want like people are like, ah
vealer is gonna explode in a year
Like how are these girls are going to be gone? You do not know how determined we are to make this like when you have a
person like
scrawny um
Heading things like you and like some of the reeflings know like you want to ride or die like
Uh, we're all so motivated to make vealer
amazing, um
Um
And we're like, oh, they're gonna have woman moments. Oh, they're gonna. Yeah. Oh like but we all got good heads on our shoulders
Um, I'm really proud of the other girls how like mature and talented they are
vealer is not here
For a short time. We are here for a long time and a good time
And uh, yeah
You can freaking clip this
And really you could you'd be like, oh, let me clip this so that
We see if his age is terribly it won't
It won't we have so much stuff planned
Can't wait. I'm so excited. I'm so happy to be here. You guys have no idea
Um yapping is literally what we want. Yeah, I'm here to get
All the ladies seem absolutely fantastically. This would be not an exception. Thank you. I appreciate that
Um and even like
Like again, like I said, I was small. I was a small vtuber people
I had like maybe like max 20 people watching me
I already feel like I've succeeded. It was my goal to be in a in a corpo. It was my goal to join an agency
and I didn't
I didn't expect to have 11k views on my baby like that
Boggled my mind like I never thought people would actually want to watch me and that people thought I'd be entertaining, you know
But I'm I'm just happy. I make you happy and I'm happy that you find me entertaining and the other girls are entertaining
Like I like watching the girls like again, like I said, I don't usually watch a lot of vtubers
But I will sit and watch strawny for hours. I was watching her a little bit. I was watching icy
Is there like they're all such wonderful entertainers to
She really picked good ones
Um
So I didn't read his character till I should be yeah, I remember. Yeah, uh, somebody like asked if I um
I'll I'll give you some all exposed to be alert some more
I'll tell you who we all went for
um
In terms of models and how it ended up being so much better that we didn't get who we wanted
Um
so
Again, like as I mentioned, I was I was cute and funny in my past life. So I went for
Pins I went for well, I didn't go for like anybody in particular
But I was hoping for like I said, please give me anybody but I was hoping for pins aka emi
um
And it's funny because emi
I think was going for mercy and mercy was going for icy and icy was going for emi and azura was just azura
Because she's just perfect for azura and then strani strani, but it was just funny
And then we're all here and we're all looking at each other and we're all like
I wouldn't want it any other way. Like I feel
Really good being she be and everybody else is so good
being
their respective
People and we're still like learning about ourselves and like getting into the characters and like
Getting the kayfabe and like we're still like so thank you for your patience with us
And yeah, like I think it worked out in the end. I hundred percent worked out in the end. Um
You cute and funny what you don't
You don't think I can be going funny. I don't be really going funny. I don't know what you're talking about
My mom
Yeah, it's gonna take something like I can't wait. We're gonna learn we're gonna grow and we'll make mistakes
And we'll learn from those mistakes
And we'll take the feedback. We'll take the critique
We'll take the trolling with a grain of salt, but like
I just I can't wait to see where we'll be a year from now because in a year gen two
gen two
Maybe after that gen three
I just want to help strani build like just
realize
her dream and then
This is a dream of mine to be part of something bigger
You know
I think I always stop pretending. It was a crab game shooting in the goth
And then one year two fast no actually like what I've noticed recently is a lot of
Companies have been putting out generations like six months after and I'm like I thought that was too fast
um
And I think a year for v2 like the first generation to get it established is pretty good
um
So no, she's an investor detail is an investor
She's an investor
Sean is our creative director. We have management. We got editors like we have this whole team behind us
Um, I feel like six months. It's hard to get established
as a
especially like a first gen um
So I'm happy we have a year
And like another thing
But then you can argue like okay, if you've been streaming longer before that in your past life
Which most have been like because let's be honest a lot of the
people in
corpos and agencies right now are already formal corpo and agency girls like
Ex Sundaria members x this x that
Um, so they already have that stuff under their belt. So it kind of makes sense when they go into another company and they're like
Okay, you're good. And then they send another like sick because there hasn't been like I think
Villalur and even like you may plus have been
uh
in recent
Years like the only companies to hire brand new girls if that makes sense because like
None of us like none of the girls in Villalur are former corpo like we've all been indies before that
So then we all really worked really hard to be
in Villalur, so
Yeah, Jenny it doesn't seem so
Yeah, um
it you know
It really depends I think it really depends on the company
I know some people like beg for second gents because to be honest they probably get bored of um
The other gen or they're just like okay. This gen isn't my cup of tea
Can I please get another one? And so I think that's another reason why companies put out
Agencies so fast because they just want to appeal to the masses which is not what you should
Which is well, of course is like you should appeal to them, but you can't just accelerate in your company
Just try to find try to hit like one person correctly
that everybody likes
You know ball gen one. I know I want to get a bald toggle. It's like
And this is my ears
Very embryo glad hearing voices. Yeah, I like was
Really worried I wasn't gonna get into Villalur because I wasn't a former agency girl and like I'll say this
So like I mentioned in my 2.0. I applied for like 10 different auditions several different companies
um
And honestly it was kind of stupid of me to apply those companies because at that point I didn't have any
V2 being experience only normal streaming experience. So I um
This is kind of they're like why is this flesh person applying?
Um, and then I applied as appeal to a couple of them and it's funny because then I like I look at like
like I applied to vnu
And I look and I'm like
You know, I'm kind of happy I didn't get in because they fit their characters so well, you know
And um same for like idle and stuff. I applied to idle. Um
and I was like
I don't see myself like they're everybody like fits their people so well, you know
It's hard to see them as anybody else or see myself as one like oh, I could have been a better version
like I don't I don't ever really say that because
yeah
Most industries are passing around the same people especially entertainment though. Yeah, there's always a thing of like nepotism
um
I know
Yeah, like a lot of companies
Usually like we'll have their talents vouch for other like indies or a talents from like
Former talents from companies and stuff. So it's like, yeah, it's pretty common in the um in the entertainment industry
Clapping with no handlebars one, excuse me
She be as Kai
um
This is a very long invitation to show business. Yeah, like what I like what really attracted me
to
Vila and honestly just like straw knees ideas in general was that she isn't
Uh
She's kind of breaking the mold to my voice is cracking
Of some btuber standards like for example, she doesn't care if we talk about our past lives
So that's why and we talked about hers and you probably already know the other girls past lives and I know some of you know mine, but um
Uh because it's like taboo normally to do that. Um
Or just like having a collab ban for the first week like I could collab with an indy tomorrow
But I'm settling in a she be first. So that's why I haven't done that indy or another kropa girl tomorrow. Um, also like in terms of
The transparency with how much they pay us like all that stuff
Do you know I know your past lives? Yes. I do know who you were
I'll do I'll do like a past life regression stream where I just
Pretend to spiritually know who you were in a past life
How can you get a job experience though getting hard? Yeah
That's not yeah, it's like that thing where companies are like
Oh, you must have eight years of this and the company's only been open
Like or the industry's only been around for like two years
So like it kind of does make sense that there is a lot of nepotism in the industry
You know because they're like, oh this person
Wants to join a corporation their former agency kind of you know, shit the bed
Let's give them another chance. We've seen their content. They know how to do this this and that
So like it makes it it is like business wise
It makes a lot more sense
To do that instead of like a bunch of nobodies like
Like me
I could have been completely crazy
I still am crazy
Was I a frog? Uh, no, you were a salamander. Sorry
Entry lover job five years experience
Ask catch them as who employers want a 10 year old 25 years experience letter
This girl isn't skit so hard
Um another insider information
Everybody in the vtuber community is mentally ill
Everybody's got a touch of tism or something
So when you're like, oh sick girl corpo. Yeah a lot of people you may in this day and age
Everybody has something
Everybody's got something. I'm telling you that right now
Like I'm uh, I got fibro. I got dysthymia OCD. Um, what else do I get?
If I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD, but I probably have it
um
generalized anxiety like
Everybody's got something
Especially with like how we communicate nowadays
It's like social media
Hello, I'm an anime girl right now
Um
and
I wish someone would touch my tism
um
and like honestly
A lot of like we know a lot more about mental health now anyways like
Like my dad, for example, like he a hundred percent probably is adult ADHD because I am my carbon copy of my dad
I'm just woman form
We are exactly like I have something called adjustment disorder
As well and he definitely probably has it
And I'm like if I get tested for ADHD and I have it
And I know my dad has it because I didn't really know about that stuff back then, you know
um
I used to work in human services and all the people I used to support were
Institutionalized for the longest time because he didn't understand these poor amazing people and how they just work differently
Will they form
Every day I see something that makes me want to get tested for autism
Yeah, and then on the other hand, there's a lot of people that like self-diagnose when they are like kind of put on
stuff so that they can feel
quirky with the label, but you know, that's another conversation
um
Daddy Davey when
I don't know probably I'll probably I think like strawnee said she'll
She'll have her dad or in record a video with him about like guessing vtuber names
And I might I might yoink that idea and do that as well after her
I took a google quiz and it said so and I took that like I don't know what's called. Is it like rad's test to test you for autism?
because my chat
In my past life was convinced. I had autism. I don't have autism
Um, I just really like slime. Okay? Um, and I get distracted easily
um
And I did that test and I scored like 104 which is like high and they're like medium indications of autism
I was like I literally was like
I was like non-verbal for like two minutes because I'm like wait do I have autism
Then I'm like no no no it's like these silly things on the internet the like you're like
Everyone loves slime slime is awesome. I have I have like a bunch of slime. Where did my slime go?
It's on my it's on my bookshelf
Um, definitely like slime stream slime ASMR stream. Um, I'm just chat is so cool
Uh, yeah, I I do have a zoomer energy. I do have a zoomer interests. I um
despite being a high
We stay sliming we sliming up in here. That's why I'm begging for a slime girl for gen 2
because strani's already conceptualizing stuff and
I've seen some of the concepts and you guys are not ready
And I'm just like but um, can we please go slime girl?
No, what hell you don't need today. No, I don't know, you know, I could just be quirky. I could just be weird
I could just be odd
Sometimes you're just
you're just
A little bit different than
Society's expectations and but that doesn't also mean you have something, you know
hag love
um
I also want like a vor chuba. I mean what?
There's a lot of like, uh
Tags and kinks. I think that would be funny
for that sort of stuff
We love older women hag love
hag love
hag love
Some people are just not like the other girls. I know, right? Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline. Eat me mommy
My face went funny there
She was on that deviant art, you know, I was on that deviant art, bro
Although I was on deviant art because I was making really cool photo manipulations of dogs and wolves because
that was weird
and I was an avid wolf role player for
10 years
I'm saying make myself sound older than I am
No, it wasn't 10 years. It's more like
We love a drop of yado vtuber and my life is yours
Wolf of rabbit's clothing. Yeah furry affectionate. Uh, I probably was a furry, but I don't think I want
I just really liked post-by-post role play like I'd be on like role players guild and stuff because I like to write a lot
I love my creative writing class in school. And so I just um
I
I was on this website called like wet paint, which is like
Site hosting place and a lot of people did like role play like whether it be like warrior cats
Or like human role plays gifted role plays. Um, all that stuff
And I was in a lot of like wolf, uh role plays
and dude
I thought those were my golden years. I was no life and I think pewter for like eight hours or day
Just being a wolf, but it was just cool because I know I was I like I'm not only child. Um, so I had
No one to talk to you. I still just hung out on the internet all the time
and just did uh role play stuff
Howling at the moon. Oh
On all levels except physical. I am a wolf
Um, but I remember one of my favorite things about wolf role playing was, um
Oh dude
First of all wolf quest
Wolf quest learning that side note learning that doki bird played wolf quest
Made my life because I thought I was like the only one that played wolf quest. It was funny on my pl
I had played wolf quest like, um
Like a couple months before she did and I was just like
Because I used to do role playing on wolf quest. That was a gay. Oh, well, we're gonna play wolf quest
I have wolf quest we're playing it. Um
And now you tell other people to bark for you exactly. I still told people to bark for me back then
Wolf quest the real origin one went. I know right. Um, but uh
I know it was a g
But um
I used to do this it was called it's gonna make it sound like I did a drug
But we there was a type of role playing called speed
So speed role playing was one sentence post by post role playing
But you had you would get hits
On the other character because it was it was like fighting you get hits on the other character by how fast you type
So if I managed to um
Type faster than you did a sentence of me doing an act and you took damage then I then I beat you
Um, and then there's like a certain amount of hits you would do and different like you had a cross distance
um, and you had to I show speed and you had to um
Uh, like get certain holds like I remember it was like eight
Hits to break a spine
or like six hits to
Get the throw and you could like throw people off. It was really fun
Um, so I had like a hundred plus word per minute
Yeah, it was really it was actually
In Minecraft. Yes, of course in Minecraft. It was really fun
I think that was like I I prided myself on being such a fast fucking typer
um
I can't do it now though. I think my words per minute is probably only like 60 or less than that
Punchy. Yeah, I was running around punching people in the spine
Um, I think what I liked about role playing as well
It was like I could take out aggression because we would raid other packs and go on their website and raid their chats
and just start fucking marking people
out I
I killed children. I killed pregnant children pregnant children
I killed pregnant wolves and I killed children. I took lives blood in my ma
um
But uh, what do you think of your chat? Um, I get
I I'm also like mercy and I get can get motion sick. So I can't do VR
So VR chat like I've done it without VR headset, but it still makes me a little bit dizzy
Not the young links
Um, but yeah, I was I remember the crafting really cool stories. I think I have like
I think oh, maybe I could like log into my super fucking old email and try it because I remember I saved some posts
Of um some role plays that I did with my friend. Um, because we had like our ocs in your role play with each other
and then
We had like a almost like a john carter esque like princess of mars
role play. It was really funny. Um, and then
Like I think I had one of like a really dramatic
Posts of like my wolf character dying
Um, but I yeah, no, I I I really miss that because I love creative writing
I would I remember my dad um said that and my mom were like, oh, she's gonna grow up to be an author and that did not happen
but um
Yeah, writing's fun reading's fun for me. I haven't done any of that stuff in a bit though. I've been
It just sucks when you get like older and like real stuff gets in the way, you know
Like life adulting. I'm like, oh, I have to have a job
Oh, I have to pay bills
Oh, I have to take care of my health and well-being
I can't just rot away. I'm like what I'd give to be like 10 again. Just do fuck all, you know
If you dig john carter read jane carver of war interesting
Does she we have a bunny? Yeah, I have a bunny tail. You can't see it on my model
But I do have a bunny tail
Oh
Yeah, adulting does suck. I hate adulting like I was um, I was talking about my alt this morning
I had to like go to the bank because I lost my bank card
I'm like, I need I'm late on my rent and the banks were closed over the weekend
And I couldn't pay my rent and then it still wouldn't work
So then I had to write a check and then I had to remember how to write a check and I'm like, uh
Being an adult
Shibi when you were a fnaf kid. Oh, I love fnaf, but um
Like I watched the fuck out of uh markiplier playing it, but I never
Was like super into it
um
Like
I think like in me super into it
It's so hard after 25
Oh, I gotta be dom life so hard
Good bunny tail
It's hard after 40. Oh, don't say that
Well, I'm far away from that. I got quite a ways to go, but my parents um
Oh goodbye model
She she's she's asleep. Um, my parents just like
Had their like 30th
No, they're about no, how long have they been married? I don't know. They've been married for a really long fucking time
My parents just like started entering into their 50s. Um
Ha that still doesn't give away how old I am
You don't know how old my parents were when they had me so fuck you. Um
But uh
Just like what they've been dealing with I'm like, uh
I don't want
Like when I was younger, I think I lived past 18
So like it sucks to be
No, no, no, I'm in minecraft in minecraft
Minecraft
Um, um, yeah, I was I was in the baby the belly
Yeah, no, it's really yeah, because you
Why am I really depressed is because I was diagnosed depression. I was like 14. Um
Like you
I didn't
We're getting real real we're getting real deep right now and it's only my third time streaming, but I don't get for shit
um
I like being honest with you guys, but um
When you're always down, you kind of don't see a future so you don't work on your future. So like I didn't
Really focus on
Like going to college a lot and focus on this and I focused on that. I didn't like pick up certain skills
um
But
In hindsight and like and obviously like hindsight's always 2020 like I wish I wish I could like give my little younger self a hug
And be like you're fine. I know you have severe social anxiety and you can't talk to people
Um, but you're gonna be okay and now you're talking to hundreds of people on the internet
And they like to watch you and talk about stuff. Um
But but you know things change and I'm I hope the same for you guys like if you're um
Younger or like um
Going up to I know like I think a large part my viewer base is like in their 20s and their 30s
but like you know hang on there man like
There is
I don't know why I'm being motivational, but there's light at the end of the tunnel
You just have to find something that you want to
Work and live for for me. It's my cats
and uh
Realizing my dream which was to be a content creator and entertainer. So you guys are helping me
With my dream and I'm a little happy and then you know getting like mental health stuff and like um
And uh, what's it called?
Like getting the right support
Everybody has different situations ain't no cure for these brain worms. Yeah, there's never a cure
But you can always make the most of it, you know
um
It's all like fake. It's only make it or just like find other
uh
support systems
Chats average ages through 76 stage
I brought a new 77c tv that's almost like a family exactly retail therapy is so great
Um
And I mean I'm such a dummy and I'm giving you life advice. Oh my god
Workout playlist is gonna create. I know I need to start working out again
Um, I like put off working out for streaming and stuff, but now that I'll be part-time at my job
I'm like, yeah, now I can go work out
And then again, I want a dog so I can go for runs and not feel like I'm gonna get like abducted or something
dominating you emotionally. Yeah
RFA streams. I don't know what that means. Uh, someone also asked, um
If I like rode horses and stuff, uh
I used to do a lot of different things because my mom was so like
Bless my mother's
dearest heart because she tried so hard
To like have me find an interest that wasn't being on the computer and doing games
So like I did horseback riding
I did ice skating. I did gymnastics. I did ballet. Um, I did a lot of
Stuff I almost did track
Uh, yeah, I did a lot of different like act active hobbies
um
It wasn't even bougie like
I didn't do them for long
Because like growing up I was really fucking poor. Um, my mom broke her fucking back
um
to
put me into the thing like
She would rather me be happy
And doing an activity to keep me engaged being an only child and everything then like
Get something for herself
to be honest
um
Honestly, yeah, again shout out to my mom my mom
Side note my mom just fucking lost her job today. So fuck her
Her company's went under fucking sucks. So like I hope that I can support like I want to be able to support
Like I know strontis is like, yeah, I paid off my parents house. I'm like, oh if I could fucking do that
Like it's the time it's my it's my time to
To give back
To my parents, you know
They were like, why are you a whore and you have such a good relationship to your parents? I don't know
It's always the christian girls, is it?
When you're hyper repressed
This is what happens
Boney
Hey, stop fucking fighting for you. Hold on my cats have all just woken up and they're just fighting each other now
Raina, I need to put you up to
Stop what are you doing to her?
Don't get dick. She's trying to sleep
Going
Wait, where's the score bottle because I know who he's already acting up. He's gonna start
I
Don't like
She is just like screams. He probably heard her like
Like making funny noises in the background going
Because he's like was biting her throat. I'm like, dude, you're killing her
He could he just plays too rough because he's he's my he's my first male cat
I've ever had I've only grown up with like female cats and I'm like, oh god
Maybe I should get another male cat. So he has someone to like
wrestle with because rain is like 14 years old she
But she she's the she runs this shit. I'll tell you that much
Fia's the baby
Boomi just turned a year old and fia just turned a year old. Um, but fia's
Much smaller. I think because of the issue she had with her like not being able to move and walk her
Her like muscles astrophied and she was she's really really small
Like she's literally the same size when she was a kitten. So Boomi just fucking beats the shit out of her
So I have to there's like a clip out there somewhere of like Boomi like
slamming her on the ground. Um, well, I had a cat cam on it was so sad. It was like
Far cats is like, oh, I'm getting myself bigger when I'm trying to scroll up. Uh, whatever
You be issues don't include Bonnie issues
No, I got you, you know, I got I got my mommy and daddy issues. I'm not telling you any of that stuff though
Religious trauma
Cat Jen when I hope we get a cat girl for next time. That'd be cool. Like a pet play girl
Ooh, a pet play girl would be so good
Because I'll be honest with you
I didn't when I first saw
um
My model I had the same idea as you I didn't know
If I was gonna be a dummy mommy because I'm like, oh, she's wearing shabari. Maybe she's like a rope bunny
Submissive so like I totally get it
I'm like, oh like well, I have a pet play angle and then she'd be like she'd be strong. He's like no
But I'm like, oh, okay
She's like you're dumb. I'm like got you on it. Fuck you
Why do I see a waifu
And beginning of she I don't know what that means you see official cat throw down
Yeah, our dog a dog. Oh like a dog pet play girl. It'd be sick. She'd be your top down. Okay. I can work with that
But um, yeah, I think one of the biggest things that sticks to me, um with uh my interview
With strongy is she was like you were always going to be my sheepsters and I was like
Crop wait cries profusely
Um wolf girl for wolf quest
Uh, I don't someone also asked my mirror I was like boomie leave her alone
Oh
Stop
You hear that?
That's boomie
He doesn't meow. He just
Coo's weird chicken girl that actually be pretty funny. Um
Sounds like babe, this is your sheepster academia
Oh
Yes, Johnny is Johnny's base. Love that woman
How to pat cattle you just pat
But someone that asked like oh if you could be another thing
What would you be like a like animal and I don't honestly want to pick something
Boomi can you chill the fuck out dude? Um
I want to pick so I would pick something that like nobody
Really ever like I like strong is because she's like a cuttlefish. She's not like an octopus
Um, I would probably do some sort of like reptile because it's not a reptile girls
There's like some snakes and there's some dino girls, but I'd like I think there was like one
Crocodile girl. I think that was like a Japanese
Talent and I was like yo, that's so cool
Boomi
I'm gonna create you if you don't behave. You can hear her run by go
Because I shake the water bottle at him. Well, there's a billion axolotls. What are you talking about?
Like coming out as a cook. Yeah, like like uh like when Madara was a cockroach. I was like
Yo, I love bug girls bug girls out. So I'd either be a reptile or a bug girl 100 percent 100 percent
Like I thought that was so cool that she was a cockroach
Um Aunt Eater girl
What type of bug um, I was thinking of like a praying mantis
Like an orchid mantis then I saw that somebody actually had done that. Um
What is that's broken hey
Hey
You galloped by um
I've seen a centipede girl. I'm actually I love bugs
Centipedes are the only bugs that freak me out and not even like
It's like the silver like the house centipedes. I don't like house centipedes
Google it if you don't know how centipedes
Hydra be cool. I've seen there's like a Cerberus one
Um, but I was kind of disappointed that she like didn't have multiple heads
Or something. I would have liked to see that incorporated
Slime girl. I've seen like a couple slime girls. There's there's definitely a couple spider girls
Um
My friend Nori, uh, I think she's just rebranded to an isopod which I'm like hell yeah isopods. There's so many cute isopods
You might have to do like a bug stream where I just talk about isopods or just bugs
Um, I used to have a little bug book and I would go around in my um, boomi. Are you behaving?
Fia is playing with like some toy in the in a blanket and boomi's like mad
Like boomi doesn't like it when the cats play independently like if rain is playing by herself or fias bang by himself
He like has to insert himself and be a part of it. Um
But this is a vtubing industry is you yeah, I don't know why everybody's like
What's it called a ca-ma-ma me me me me me. I can ever pronounce it. But
Yeah, everybody's like an animal person
Um, what I would like to see more of is food based vtubers. I have seen a couple food based vtubers
Um, I think that's funny
Yes
Yeah
It's either like or like a unique mystical creature like I wanted um
But when I was first conceptualizing
my VTuber model, not Shibi, like prior to Shibi.
This was made by Shani herself.
I was birthed from the loins of Shone of Momhe.
But I was thinking about like doing
like Cthulhu Outer Worlds type character,
like Outer Realms, and this would be like
have a Hydra sort of like multiple tentacles, tails,
like really like spooky, freaky,
like I was tempted to do that.
Yeah, like I should go off, see Waffles.
Yeah.
Rest in peace, Waffle and the Toaster, they miss her.
She was a, she was a girl, she was a friend.
Via Girl Girl.
Yeah, like Mecha Girl, that'd be cool.
I don't see, and that's another thing.
A lot of artists don't, and the VTuber stuff,
don't do Mecha unless it's like cybernetic
and it's usually for guys for some reason.
Like I don't see, or like there's some cybernetic girls
or like androids and stuff,
but like I want like a full ass transformer.
Like give me a Voltron.
Give me a pterodactyl.
Honda Accord, Chan.
I offer you an Accord.
Just a Honda Accord.
Chick stick, giant robots, you got that, right?
That's why I like Robotech.
Somebody who's mad, they're like,
you don't like just Macross.
Robotech was like the first super old anime
my dad introduced me to.
It was like Studio Ghibli stuff and then Robotech
and then yeah, just like a bunch of other shit.
Like I watched a lot of anime.
I don't know why, I like blank on all the anime I've watched.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Do you just want attention?
Hi handsome.
Mail on stream, it's my cat, relax everybody.
He doesn't even have any balls.
What are you doing big man?
Are you trying to seduce me?
Are you trying to get treats and pets?
He's just dragging a toy across the floor.
Have a good night, if you need to go.
I know I've been streaming like for four hours
so like if you guys need to leave, that's totally fine.
I'm also a yapper and talker like strongy.
I don't think I could, I can endurance yap.
I can't endurance game like she does.
Like if she's still playing, hold on, now I want to check.
Is she still playing something?
I bet she is.
Forever be online.
I generally, when I first met her,
I'm like how do you get any work done?
Cause you just play games.
Like how do you have time to record stuff?
She recorded like months and months and months
of stuff in advance.
Oh my gosh, she still is streaming.
She's still streaming as I said,
I love Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
That was the first one I played.
Was there a streaming too?
Cool.
I was hoping for Ace Combat or Armored Core
but it was just Assassin's Creed.
I officially play Armored Core.
What time are you in Merca's right now?
It's 8 20 p.m. into Merca's Eastern Time.
East Code, represent it.
You just don't want to leave us as a good, yeah, I don't.
Like after, I have to, I'll probably end stream soon
cause I need to go eat dinner.
And I'm going to be sad because I have no one to talk to.
I have been like, I don't know what to do.
I like, I have friends.
I just don't feel like hanging out with them.
I don't feel like, I have to go and get ready
and get dressed and blah, like I have to do that tomorrow.
Like tomorrow, just reminded me, I have to get up
and go to like the store and go buy some alcohol
cause I normally don't even drink
but I just know it'd be funny to do a drunk stream.
Where's my fellow Europeans starting to pass midnight?
Go to bed, go to bed.
I used to stream around like very European friendly times
like 12 a.m. and sometimes 10 a.m.
And the boomy, what are you doing?
He's literally just staring at my window
and just like tweaking out
cause there's probably a bug on it.
Hi handsome, what are you doing?
He has like a cat tree that he sits on
but he sticks his arm over the side.
Like he's a truck driver and it's really funny to see.
I'll probably post a picture of it.
Hit him with a kitty, no he doesn't.
Little, my cats don't answer to, they answer to
my little mousy call.
We dare not see the things only cats can see.
Your longer streams go into the night a bit here
but it's not too bad.
I stream from like 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. before.
Like I don't mind doing super long streams
if I have the time for it.
And then again, I can talk about anything for hours.
As you can see, I've only played two hours of game
and then there's two hours of yapping.
My black cat sits in her cat stand
with her back legs just dangling off.
I love that.
I love it.
Like Fia likes to stick out her legs a lot.
Like she's the most stretchy, floppy-est cat.
When cats like just lay on their back
and like stick their little feeties out and just kick them.
It's great.
69, 420 hours stream went.
Ooh, it is my goal.
I'm gonna say this right now.
I would love to do an actual 24-hour stream.
Like I will sleep on,
I don't know if this YouTube allows sleeping on stream
but like just like have a day.
Like I don't know, like you cook, play games
and maybe I'll do that for my birthday.
And like, but actually do like a 24-hour don't-a-thon.
And then like I'm sleeping
and then I just have like my 3DO.
So you guys can hear me like fart in my sleep and just, yeah.
And I think that would be pretty, pretty fun.
Just to like, or like I sleep with my 3DO
pressed to my chest.
So you guys can hear my heartbeat.
Do I sleep talk?
I don't know.
I know that I snore from like what my parents have told me.
I snore sometimes.
My mom one time said that she freaked out
because I stopped breathing in my sleep.
She was like still awake at night,
like watching her shows and I was sleeping.
And then she heard me snore, my breath get caught
and then just like, I choked but I didn't wake up.
And so she was like, wake up, you're so exciting.
And I was like, what the fuck?
And she's like, I, you were not breathing.
And I'm like, oh.
Time to get a CPAP machine.
Yeah, my dad is sleeping.
I mean, I probably have a doom.
Fucking.
No, it's weird.
It's really weird.
I hate that.
I would not want to sleep like a Darth Vader mask on me.
It's mostly cause like, I just like,
I think it's cause I sleep with my mouth open.
All the little spiders can crawl inside.
Have you already tested if the boob bug
in the way of heartbeat ASMR?
I just push my titties to each side of my body accordingly.
And put it like, I have to like push my titties to like,
I can't tell when I'm touching myself right now.
And I just push my titties to the side
and then I have to like mush my, the 3DO against my chest.
She'd become cyborg.
If I could just cut off my tits, that'd be great.
I hate having tits, man.
I'd rather have a fatter ass.
But yeah, cause it's a boiler alert.
There might be a heartbeat ASMR coming out soon.
So I had to record a lot of heartbeat stuff.
So I am already experienced with that.
I have to like adjust myself,
like a manager manages his, his ball sack.
Now adjust my titty sack.
Chibi, you can only stream 12 hours
and Vaude has gone on YouTube.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I know that.
I know that.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Does it like,
does it like automatically end
if you stream 12 hours?
Does it just end?
Like it doesn't just like be like,
you're done and just cut you off or.
I got a piss.
I got a pee.
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
Hold on.
Let's see.
I think I might,
might end here cause I do need to eat something.
I'm streaming for four hours.
It looks like Amy is still streaming.
It's funny cause it looks like
because I just started streaming.
Strawny is still streaming.
We are the overlap corporal
cause we all stream for very, very long amount,
amounts of time.
The Vaude doesn't get saved.
That's so weird.
It stops recording the vlog.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
I'll probably go get something to eat.
Let me send you guys to Azura
cause I see that like she's just streaming.
She just started.
What the fuck?
Oh, I just have major deja vu video details.
Reader X are so weird.
Like why can't I just raid?
Jesus Christ, let me raid.
A place forbidden.
I don't know what that's about.
But yeah, I hope you guys had a good time.
Thank you for letting me out.
I tend to overshare.
So I'm slightly embarrassed right now.
Yeah, have a good night.
I'm trying to think of something insulting to say
cause you know, to be the Dom on YouTube.
I don't know.
Oh my God, did you guys hear?
My cat just hiss at each other.
All right, later.
Give a, give Azura my love.
Bye bye.
