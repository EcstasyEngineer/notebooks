90000	120000	I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
120000	150000	bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
150000	180000	of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
180000	210000	a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
210000	210280	little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little tail of a little big
221280	223280	screws
226640	228640	after the sign
235140	237140	I just woke up
237140	239540	so you get the sleepy
240000	250800	I was like, it was like 4.58, um, like, gets up, crawls to desk, turns on stream.
250800	261740	I might need to- I think I need to have an idle meeting when I'm not sure yet.
261740	263740	But how are you guys doing?
263740	264740	I'm doing fine.
264740	266240	I hope you're doing fine.
267040	271840	I could have slept a little longer, but it's kind of better I don't, because, oh my god,
271840	278400	I'm so big at the hell I'm trying to scroll, so that, um, I'm echoing, I hate it when I do that.
278400	284000	Um, so that, oh, it's my turn to putt.
289360	292160	That should have been a warning sign.
292160	299520	Oh yeah, so I have to wear this on me because YouTube doesn't like my bosom, so I'm hiding it.
299520	303920	Out of shame, I'm so shameful.
303920	308320	I'm so terrible for YouTube.
308320	315600	Um, I am getting a cover-up, uh, eventually, so.
315600	318560	And it'll probably just be my shirt button, which is nice.
318640	320640	I might have got my nose itches.
323120	325440	YouTube does pick and choose, yes.
325440	330320	Um, let me see.
330320	333200	Literally one of my favorite games of all time, plus she be streaming it.
333200	334720	I'm being good today.
334720	336560	Um, I love Inscription.
336560	342640	Inscription is one of my favorite games of all time, so I know some of you guys have that in common.
343360	351440	It is, if you don't know what Inscription is, Inscription is a, um, it's a card, turn-based card
351440	354480	game, and cards have unique properties.
355520	361520	You do all very interesting characters that have very cool little perks that they got.
362640	367360	The ambiance is amazing, the plot is amazing, it's very meta.
368320	374080	I highly recommend, if you've never played Inscription after, um, watching me today,
374080	374800	please play it.
374800	376320	It's such a good game.
376320	378160	I've played through the game multiple times.
379280	388560	Some of you who might be from, um, my PL have seen me play it before, and my Inscription streams
388560	394080	where I know some of people's favorites, because I gave everybody very funny voices.
397920	401760	But yeah, it's a very, very good, uh, good game.
401760	408880	We're going to be doing Casey's Mod, so a Casey's Mod is that it extends the first portion of the
408880	412000	game, because there's several sections of the game.
412000	418800	There's different phases, um, and because, of course, it's the one you first start off with,
418800	425840	the first phase of the game, or the first half, or whatever portion, um, is a fan favorite of
425840	429920	everybody's, um, for the graphics, the characters, what have you.
429920	434320	So Casey's Mod expands that, so it lasts a little bit longer.
434960	442800	We have Crowd Control, I'm going to, I don't, I don't know how it will work with Inscription,
442800	443760	but we'll see.
443760	444800	I'm very excited.
444800	450240	I've never played it with the Crowd Control with Inscription before, so that'll be fun.
450960	460880	Um, somebody also asked, uh, if I'm replacing Strani and the, uh, Uno collab tomorrow, uh,
460880	465600	or, sorry, the day after, or Sunday, I can't remember, I just woke up, let me alone.
465600	471040	Um, yes, I am, because I was supposed to be in it in the first place.
471040	476320	Uh, she only subbed in for me, because I couldn't join because of work.
476320	481360	But now, since I quit my job, I can be back in it.
481360	485920	So I apologize if that disappoints you, I completely understand if it does.
486720	492800	Um, but, yeah, I still hope you think we'll have fun, because I know we will.
494400	497760	Um, yeah, it's no work now, yay.
497760	498640	Saturday, yes.
499360	505920	Um, yeah, it's stupid, Uno only has four players, like it's so dumb,
505920	512640	it should be like six or eight, like at max in my opinion, but you know, it is what it is,
512640	515360	you know, it's owned by Ubisoft, so what the fuck, whatever.
515840	518400	Um, hold on, Uno reverse card.
519120	524000	Uh, the graphic, the thumbnail artist, I was like, I realized after they're like,
524000	528560	oh, what do you want me to put on your thumbnail?
528560	532080	And I'm like, so, and they show me examples of like,
532160	539280	Shawnee's, and it was like, um, stop saying you're inking yourself for five minutes or draw 25.
539280	545520	So, uh, I did stop doing wacky voices for five minutes, but what I should have done
545520	551440	was stop getting demonetized for five minutes or draw 25.
551440	553280	And I thought would have been funner.
553280	556160	Um, but it is what it is.
556160	558080	It's still, it's still silly.
559040	564160	Although like, it was funny that the Azura, the collab I have with Azura,
564160	567520	it did get limited ads, which I thought was really funny.
567520	571680	I don't, I seem to have fallen asleep in excitement.
572480	575440	Well, I'll just talk like this, I guess.
575440	579440	Um, it might be my wifi.
579440	581520	It's, it's been like really hot today.
581520	587360	I wouldn't be surprised if like, I don't know, freaking fire happens or lose power or what have you.
587360	589600	It's just, it's, it's the hottest it's been.
589600	590960	It's been a long time in my area.
591600	598160	Um, but, uh, I did get limited ads, but I appealed it and they accepted it.
599280	600080	It's fine.
602560	603600	So it's good.
603600	604560	It's fine.
604560	605680	Oh, I've woken up.
607680	614320	Um, I, I literally was so tired after, hold on.
614960	617360	Where did my BGM go for just chatting?
617360	617840	Hello?
618800	619680	That's so weird.
619680	625840	I should have it here instead of me just like talking incessantly.
625840	628480	I'll have you have some music with it.
630800	633760	Um, there we go.
633760	634240	That's fine.
636400	637120	Cool beans.
637120	641200	Um, what was I going to say?
642080	644240	Oh, uh, so I went into the grocery store.
644240	648880	I haven't been in the grocery store and ground grocery shopping and like maybe a month or two.
652720	654720	I usually, like, I don't really eat a lot.
654720	661040	I like, you guys, like I'll usually just like door dash a meal and that's my thing for the day,
661040	663440	which I'm like, that's probably not healthy.
664080	665600	Just eating one meal a day.
666240	669040	Hey, but I have like apple juice and water.
671360	673360	So I got some snacks.
673360	678880	I was really pissed though, because I, I'm like, I said, I mentioned like power going out and stuff
678880	688480	on just because in the, um, the frozen food section of my supermarket, the power was out.
688480	690480	So all, I feel bad for the supermarket.
690480	692720	So they're like, you can't open the doors.
692720	700160	I'm like, then why even have this place open if we can't open any of the fast, not the fast food,
700160	701760	the frozen food section.
701760	706640	And like, I was going to get a pizza and or like some like
708240	711440	salmon because I love salmon and I couldn't even do that.
711440	713760	So I literally just got like snacks.
713760	718640	I have, I have, um, Emmy, Mammy, want beef, uh, beef jerky.
718640	720640	So I got beef jerky next to me.
720640	728000	I've already eaten half of a bueno and I have an airhead next to me and I'm like,
728000	729840	I literally went food shopping.
729840	731440	Like I'm a fucking teenager.
733600	739920	But, um, yeah, I have to like actually, I'll probably go to another supermarket tomorrow
740640	748400	and like get like, um, usually I'll get like steak or like some sort of unlike some poultry.
749200	756000	Um, I do, I do, I did see my little, it's funny because people are like, oh,
756320	762960	oh, should you be, you put, you added hello fresh on your alt account.
763600	765680	Oh, did you know you were doing?
765680	766640	Yes, I did.
766640	767600	That was the point.
767600	770320	It was, it was funny because I knew I would get interaction.
773040	774080	You guys have been tricked.
775440	781760	And also, um, I tweeted from that account because I thought it would get more attention
781760	783840	because it has more followers than my main.
784400	788320	But then I was just like, wait, I don't want them to think I'm just a whore
789280	790240	because I'm more than that.
790240	791840	I'm more than just a whore, okay.
792480	796960	Um, so I, that's when I added, I was like, uh, oh shit, add this.
796960	801200	But yeah, you guys can believe the other thing that I did it on accident.
802400	803120	That's okay.
803120	803680	Don't be mad.
803680	804400	You got baited.
804400	805520	I sound like I'm drunk.
805520	809760	I sound like a girl at a party that's like, hey, do you want to come home with me?
810480	812560	Like my ride kind of ditched me.
812560	814160	So like, can you take me home?
815120	817920	No, I've only had like a couple shots.
817920	818960	It's not a big deal.
819920	821600	I'm not going to puke in your car.
821600	822800	Just take me home.
822800	823280	All right.
823920	824480	All right.
824480	824960	Thank you.
825920	828480	Um, I'm such a kidder.
828480	828720	Yeah.
830480	830960	Fresh.
830960	832080	She'd be banned.
832800	837520	Um, I wonder if one fourth of your grocery bills is actual hood.
837520	839600	Like, yeah, I got like some Cheerios.
839600	840240	I got milk.
840240	843280	I got like way too much juice, I will say.
843280	846560	I'm like, I got like two, two different types of seltzer.
846560	848960	I got some ginger ale because my tummy has been upset.
850560	851840	I don't drink soda often.
851840	855840	I'm like, you know, I'll make up, I'll make an exception with ginger ale.
855840	856400	That's better.
856400	856640	Right.
857120	858640	Um, it's not.
859920	863840	And then I got some, I realized they got two types of apple juice.
863840	866640	I got apple juice in a pouch.
866640	873120	And then I got apple juice in the, like in the giant container of apple juice,
873120	874240	like a jug of apple juice.
874240	878880	And I was like, well, I thought I grabbed the peach tea, but I grabbed the apple juice.
878880	880800	So I guess I have one apple juice.
882400	884720	And then I got lemonade.
884720	885600	Did I grab lemonade?
885600	886000	I don't know.
886800	889200	And I realized I got milk when I already had milk.
889200	891040	And I'm like, you know, you can never get too much milk.
891040	895200	I don't drink milk because like just like a zero, I'm lactose intolerant.
895200	898880	And I really shouldn't be having milk or gluten for that matter because, uh,
898880	904320	fiber actually, um, dairy and gluten cause inflammation if you didn't know that.
904320	907440	So if you're having inflammation problems, don't eat that stuff.
907440	913280	But, um, I don't live in California where everybody and their mom is like vegetarian
913280	916160	and gluten free or whatever have you.
916160	920480	So I will eat it anyways at the expense of my physical health.
921440	922800	And also because it tastes good.
923440	924400	No one can stop me.
926160	927200	Uh, lactose free.
927200	931840	There was like, honestly, when things say that they're lactose free,
931840	934880	I don't really believe it cause like I'll drink lactate.
935440	937280	I'll still have tummy issues.
937280	938320	I don't know what it is.
939520	941040	There's this other drink.
941040	943840	There's this other type of milk I got that's lactose free.
943840	945120	I still get tummy issues.
945120	948000	So maybe it's another thing within the milk that makes me sick.
948000	948480	I don't know.
949200	950560	It really just makes me fart a lot.
950560	951600	So not a big deal.
951680	960240	Um, like, uh, like I mentioned, like saying that, um, I was watching the boys yesterday
961040	963840	and saying that like in the homelander was like drinking a milkshake.
963840	965680	And I was like, oh, I'd love to drink a milkshake.
965680	968560	And then I got a milkshake this morning.
969360	970160	Surprise.
970160	974160	I treated myself and, um, I was just farting up a storm.
974160	976000	So sorry.
976000	976640	Almond milk.
977360	981360	I don't, my, I don't know.
981360	981920	What it is.
981920	987120	I don't like the texture of most like the only type of milk I can drink.
987120	988480	That's not actual milk.
988480	990320	Milk is probably oat milk.
990320	992240	Almond milk tastes like spit to me.
992800	994880	Um, I also don't like eggnog for that reason.
994880	998400	It feels like spit in my mouth and not like the fun kind.
999120	1001920	It's just like someone hacked a loogie and that's,
1002960	1006960	it's only fun when I do it to you and when it's in a naughty sense,
1006960	1008880	not when I'm like trying to have cereal.
1008880	1012160	I don't want to have a spit bowl of spit milk cereal.
1012160	1013680	I'm good with that, but thank you.
1014480	1016560	I'm sounding like such a valley girl right now.
1016560	1017920	What the fuck is going on?
1020560	1021920	Um, but yeah.
1023840	1025360	I'm wearing overalls.
1025360	1028720	I'm going to take them off because they're starting to write up my cooch.
1028720	1029520	Well, I'm sitting.
1031840	1034320	I have a song stuck in my head.
1035280	1039840	K-Tranota and Pink Pantherous did a song together,
1039840	1044960	which blessed my beautiful bunny ears called Snap My Fingers.
1045520	1049680	And I have her vocal stuck in my head and I'm like, oh my God.
1050240	1051360	I love Pink Pantherous.
1051360	1053200	Oh my God, just stepped in a shit ton of litter.
1053920	1058400	Um, thank you, uh, by the way, for whomever purchased.
1058400	1064160	Um, or just like you guys been heavily, heavily, heavily supporting me on Throne.
1064320	1067440	And I appreciate that a lot because I, as you see, I don't put like
1068480	1071200	a lot of like weeb shit or clothes or cute shit.
1071200	1072960	I'm like, I need stuff for my house.
1072960	1076640	And I appreciate it so much when you guys help me with that.
1076640	1078560	I'm like, I need a vacuum.
1078560	1081440	I need, can I have, can I have a bed frame?
1081440	1085040	I like, oh my God, my bed frame was so heavy and I dropped it on my foot
1085040	1086720	and I have a giant bruise on my foot now.
1087440	1089680	Um, that actually doesn't look that bad.
1089680	1091200	It looks bad when I first happened.
1091200	1091920	But thank you.
1091920	1093280	I appreciate you guys so much.
1093360	1097440	Um, I don't want to sleep on a mattress on the floor anymore.
1098240	1102000	I don't know how I'm going to, like in my bed is, my bed is big.
1102800	1108720	I have, um, despite being like just me, I have a king size bed.
1109280	1115040	Um, because I have three cats and they take up one side of the bed.
1115040	1120080	And then I was just like, oh, if I get a dog, because when I move,
1120080	1122800	like probably get my own house, I'm probably gonna get a dog.
1122800	1125040	I'm like, where's the dog going to sleep?
1125040	1126560	He's got to sleep in bed with me.
1127600	1127920	Okay.
1127920	1130160	Cause you know, I need like have a little puppy.
1130160	1131680	Um, you know, chilling.
1131680	1132080	Don't worry.
1132080	1133680	If I got a dog, I would create, train it.
1133680	1134560	I'm, I'm very good.
1135200	1138240	Um, my family friends are dog trainers.
1138240	1140080	So probably seek their wisdom.
1140080	1142240	But like, I, I, I also move around.
1143760	1147040	I'm weird and I also move around a lot in bed.
1147680	1152800	So my mom always made fun of me cause as a baby, um, or like younger,
1152800	1155200	I would always sleep in like a crescent shape.
1155200	1157040	Like, I don't know what, not like my arms out,
1157040	1160080	but I would just like curl to the ball, like the side of the ball.
1160720	1164320	And lately when I wake up in bed, I realized if, I don't know if I'm having
1164320	1168320	restless sleep, but I realized I'm waking up completely sideways.
1170000	1175840	Like I just, I'm literally horizontal, not vertical on my bed.
1175840	1177840	And I'm like, good thing I have a giant bed.
1177840	1182240	So big bed for real little girls to sleep at the foot of the bed.
1182240	1183040	Exactly.
1183040	1183760	Hi, Mercy.
1185280	1187040	I have a little spot for mercy.
1187920	1192880	It, I like, and then, and it's like, if one of the girls slept over,
1192880	1197360	which I would love to host the girls at my apartment, if that ever happened,
1197360	1198320	it would be so funny.
1198800	1200800	Um, cause I have enough room.
1200800	1202960	I could probably get like a blowout mattress.
1202960	1204480	My walking closet is huge.
1204480	1206960	I could literally fit like a twin in there.
1206960	1212080	Um, and then someone could take the couch and my couch turns into a bed
1212080	1213440	cause you girls smart.
1214720	1220320	And, uh, I have space on my floor and then one of the girls,
1220320	1222560	I probably could fit two of the girls in bed with me.
1223440	1233440	So, you know, although like, yeah, I think I'm the tallest out of all the girls.
1233440	1237680	So I probably, I probably give the girls my bed cause I'm nice like that.
1237680	1238960	And I'll be like, I'll sleep on the floor.
1239840	1240400	Uh, yeah.
1240400	1246800	The couch, honestly, so it's like, um, like, sorry, I just looked over at Boomi
1246800	1253360	and he, you know that one picture of that cat in that, um, eating food in that one
1253360	1258240	like feeder food thing and he's, it's like the recording them and stuff.
1258240	1261760	And then they have names, you know, the one with like the sassy side eye.
1261760	1267040	I just looked over and he was looking at me like that and it took me by surprise how
1267040	1269600	much he looks like the cat looking up after eating food going.
1272400	1274720	Um, you fight for the chance to sleep.
1274720	1284080	She be, um, but my couch, um, and this is because like I, I have family outside, um,
1284960	1291200	of my state and sometimes like my parents house is too small to probably like to have
1291200	1292800	people like stay there.
1292800	1298480	So I got, um, for my grandparents and my aunts and uncles when they come up from Florida,
1298480	1301520	um, like, wait, it just stalks my family.
1301520	1302400	I don't really care though.
1304000	1305200	I forget it.
1305920	1310000	I have a, oh my God, Reina is singing the song of her people.
1312320	1313200	Can you guys hear that?
1315440	1317760	She has her fuzzy ball and she likes to yell with it.
1318560	1321840	Um, the couch is like an L shaped couch.
1321840	1325360	It's kind of small, but like there's this little thing you can pull out and it makes
1325360	1329680	it turn into a bed and you can put like a little bed pad on it and then just like have
1329680	1333280	some blankets and I have a lot of blankets and I have so many blankets.
1334080	1334800	I got you.
1334800	1338800	So you're not going to be given like a cardboard box to cover yourself in when you sleep over.
1339440	1344800	Um, if any of the girls watching right now have concern that if you shared the bed with
1344800	1348560	any of them, you might accidentally straight, just wrangle across like toss and turn to you.
1348560	1351600	I probably would just smack one of them in the face on accident.
1352560	1357280	Um, I probably, yeah, I would probably just like flip.
1357280	1360480	That's why I'm like, I'll sleep on the floor like in my closet.
1361520	1365680	You could have probably two girls on the couch, three girls in my bed.
1365680	1366960	So that, yeah, it works out.
1368560	1368880	Yeah.
1368880	1370880	The harem can get the cardboard.
1370880	1374160	You guys can, you guys can sleep next to me on the floor and I'll just, you know,
1374160	1376800	pull a little piece of cardboard on you for, for warmth.
1376800	1379360	You can sleep on some cardboard and then you get a cardboard blanket.
1380320	1383680	I would say thank you if you smacked me in the face.
1385360	1390160	Um, no, I would never intentionally hit one of the girls unless they're like
1391600	1394160	subconsciously they tell me to do that while I'm sleeping.
1394160	1396480	If they're like whispering into me and they're like, hit me, hit me, hit me.
1396480	1401280	I'm not going to, I also, um, tend to snore.
1401280	1409440	So I was like thinking about doing for my doughnut on this like sleeping on stream.
1410320	1417200	I stream and I'm like, I'm definitely going to snore, but that's fine.
1417200	1418000	I think it's funny.
1419280	1420320	You can bully me for that.
1420320	1424080	I don't mind boxing off collab would go kind of hard.
1424080	1428960	I've always wanted to do kickboxing, um, but my body is nice and frail now
1429600	1435840	after having COVID and that's what set off the, the, the physical bomb within my body
1435840	1436880	that gave me fibro.
1438480	1439600	Do you talk in your sleep?
1439600	1444000	I don't, I don't sleeping with madam.
1445520	1447760	I think sleeping streams are allowed on YouTube.
1447760	1448560	I'm not quite sure.
1449440	1452560	Uh, I thought with your jujitsu back room and you excel in kickboxing.
1452560	1453200	Yes.
1453200	1458640	Like I, but like keep in mind, I haven't, I haven't done jujitsu in quite a
1458640	1459920	bit because of one.
1459920	1461120	I injured my shoulder really bad.
1461120	1462400	Someone tackled me really good.
1462400	1466960	I don't know if it popped it out of place, but I have like eternal bursitis in that
1466960	1467360	shoulder.
1468320	1469520	Oh, hi, bro.
1469520	1470560	Thank you for the soup.
1471520	1474480	One of the girls tickling your nose with the feather while the other presents herself.
1474480	1475280	She's in the way of your hand.
1475280	1477760	We try to swat away the thing tickling.
1477760	1479360	I need that as an art piece.
1479360	1480720	I, I need that drawn.
1482000	1483120	Thank you for the time.
1485040	1485280	Yeah.
1485840	1487680	And COVID stopped us from getting you in the UFC.
1488240	1489520	Dude, you have no idea.
1489520	1493200	Cause I was, I was going to start competing at that point.
1493200	1495760	Um, then COVID happened, which sucked.
1496560	1502880	But my, my teacher was just like, it's, I think it's time that you start competing.
1502880	1507520	And I had been there for, um, I forget how long, but I was just like, I was so hyped.
1507520	1508320	I was so ready.
1509440	1512720	Then, you know, everybody gets like, it's funny.
1512720	1517040	People like, oh, you do jujitsu and then it's either they respond with yes or they're
1517040	1520480	like, nah, I got injured and I'm the latter.
1520480	1522000	I'm not, I got injured.
1522000	1525040	I'm no chef, but boy are these titties sweaty today.
1528160	1528720	I'm sorry.
1528720	1530080	I was reading something on Twitter.
1530080	1532160	Um, but it actually fits a lot.
1532160	1536640	I'm going to retweet that because I was literally taking off my bra at the same time
1536640	1538560	as I was reading that because my titties are sweaty.
1539360	1542640	Um, but yeah, and I also bruise really easily.
1542880	1548000	Uh, I have arthritis at the young age of 56.
1548000	1552880	So in my neck, I remember I used to, I had to get injections in my neck and I know I
1552880	1556560	need another one because my shoulder is acting up again because it's all nerve pain and shit.
1557120	1562160	And that's why my fingers go numb and turn really, really white when I'm cold.
1562160	1563440	I don't really care though.
1563440	1566720	And then my customer is like, you could definitely have renoite syndrome.
1566720	1575520	Um, but, um, uh, I remember I was getting injections in my neck and it was cool because
1575520	1580000	the way that I was angled, I can kind of see the doctor like putting the needles in because
1580000	1584960	you had to, he had to put like the ports in first and near my spine.
1585680	1590640	Um, cause it's like on the lower part of my neck and then, then he had to inject it into
1590640	1596240	the ports and I could see the ports going into my neck and I was like, holy, this is cool.
1596800	1598240	I also had a valium that day.
1598240	1599840	So I probably thought anything was cool.
1599840	1604000	I never had valium before, but I felt like I was in amnesia, the dark descent.
1604000	1605440	So I was having a great time.
1606080	1609600	Um, I had really bad anxiety for that.
1609600	1617360	So my mom drove me to and from, uh, and so the doctor afterwards, and I'm like on valium,
1617360	1622400	mind you, and he's just like, so like, do you do a lot of like contact sports?
1622400	1625760	And I'm like, no, I haven't done a jiu-jitsu for like a year.
1625760	1627840	And he's just like, yeah, this wouldn't do that.
1627840	1629760	He's like, do you do any horseback riding?
1629760	1633520	I'm like, I did when I was like, like years ago.
1633520	1637520	And they're just like, oh, it looks like you've been doing it recently because your
1637520	1640800	like neck, it looks like it's been like bobbing a lot.
1640800	1645120	And I'm like, like it's been jostled and like shaken around and just like,
1645120	1647920	rut like, like my bones have grinded against each other.
1648560	1651600	And I'm just like, no, I'm not.
1651600	1653200	And they're like, do you stand on your head?
1653200	1654240	Like, do you do yoga?
1654240	1654960	I'm like, no.
1656240	1662240	So my bone, like after like, I got hit when I got COVID the first time I was fine.
1662240	1667280	The second time I was like, I like my body was a mess.
1667280	1671040	And I like set off like all this fucking inflammation to my body because I was perfectly
1671040	1676400	fine before I ever had COVID, never had an issue, never had like the worst thing was
1676400	1677760	that I wore fucking glasses.
1679360	1680240	So much for that.
1681440	1683200	Do you stand on your head on a regular basis?
1684080	1687520	Have you been spending time in a giant novelty washing machine lately?
1687520	1689840	And, um, yeah.
1689840	1695120	And so like, I have it in both sides of my neck and in my ankles, like pretty much on my joints.
1695840	1704720	And they're just, and like, I'm in my 50s, very young for my age.
1704720	1707040	Okay. So they were very confused by that.
1707040	1711360	And a lot of doctors wouldn't believe me when I said like, I was feeling this
1712000	1716720	symptom or that symptom because they're like, oh, that sounds like this rheumatoid or like
1716720	1718320	fibro or this or that.
1718320	1719280	And my mom is fibro.
1719280	1720560	So I was just like, yeah.
1721360	1725440	So it was just, oh, so fucking annoying dealing with doctors.
1726160	1731280	Um, even recently, like go to my, I'll go to any doctor and they look at me.
1731280	1733600	They see like, like I'm a healthy looking woman.
1734560	1737040	I'm young at 56.
1737040	1742960	And they're just like, wait, so you have this problem, this problem and this problem.
1742960	1743760	No, you can't.
1743760	1744880	You're too young.
1746480	1749040	And you guys see, have seen how big my titties are.
1749840	1750720	I'll be honest with you.
1750720	1755840	I want a reduction because I'm having a lot of horrible back and neck and shoulder pain.
1756480	1761600	That's, trust me, I love, I love my tick old bitties, but when they cause me pain,
1761600	1762960	I can't deal with them.
1762960	1767360	And my, one of the doctors that I went to said, you should just use a different bra.
1768000	1771600	And I was like, gamer word, excuse me.
1772480	1772720	No.
1774880	1776240	Like, brother.
1776240	1777280	No, no, no, no.
1777280	1783680	What do you, maybe because it was a fucking man that told me that, but I was, I was pissed the
1783680	1784480	fuck off.
1784480	1786560	I was like, excuse me.
1787120	1789040	You did not just fucking say that.
1789840	1793360	Um, the anti-grab, yeah, they're like, just wear more sports bras.
1793360	1795920	I'm like, what?
1795920	1797680	That doesn't even make any fucking sense.
1798720	1804880	Um, but this would, I'm like, that's on the back burner though.
1804880	1805760	That's on the back burner.
1805760	1807120	I don't even know what I'm talking about this.
1808000	1812160	Um, I guess, yeah, it's because I've been in a lot of pain lately.
1813120	1816160	Some were, I think that's another reason I had to like sleep because I've been in a
1816160	1817120	lot of pain.
1817120	1818640	My shoulder has been fucking killing me.
1818640	1821360	So I just want to be honest with you, honest with you, tell you how I'm doing.
1821920	1830000	Um, I am, you know, we are the Sick Girl Corpo, you know, point, fifth edition because
1830000	1831920	every Corpo is a Sick Girl Corpo.
1832640	1837360	Um, learning more, learning more about how Sheeby's body is falling apart.
1840720	1844960	Um, Pac-Britters is a good name for heavy hand.
1844960	1847120	That's a good, yeah, actually that's pretty good.
1847920	1851360	Um, but yeah, please don't get reduction.
1851360	1853200	Both men and women would kill to have those.
1855760	1856960	How would I kill you?
1859600	1860400	How about that?
1860400	1861360	No, I'm kidding.
1861360	1862640	In Minecraft, of course.
1863440	1872800	Um, but you know, like imagine, I'm trying to think I'm an equivalent for men.
1872800	1877920	It was funny because like Salem didn't quite understand why I wanted one either.
1877920	1879120	And she's just like, come on.
1879120	1880320	And I'm like, hold them.
1880320	1880960	She's like, what?
1880960	1881760	I'm like, hold them.
1882400	1883440	So she took them and hold them.
1883440	1886080	She's like, holy crap, this is like 10 pounds each.
1886080	1888080	And I'm like, exactly, exactly this.
1888800	1894080	Um, imagine, yeah, imagine your balls in the, no, like, I can't.
1894880	1905520	Like take two things of flower, put them in a, like strap them, put a strap on each one of them,
1905520	1908240	put that strap around your neck and hang yourself.
1908240	1908960	No, I'm kidding.
1908960	1912800	And, and hang them around your neck and you're in front of your chest.
1912800	1915760	Like, or like balloons, not even, no, balloons are too light.
1915760	1920880	Just like something heavy, take them, um, and do that.
1921600	1926080	And then feel how bad, and then, and then wear a bra with it, like an underwire bra.
1927360	1930240	Have that bra dig into you and not fit properly.
1931920	1932800	Gallons of milk.
1932800	1934080	Sure, whatever you want.
1934080	1934560	A bowling.
1934560	1935440	They're not that heavy.
1935440	1936080	Jesus Christ.
1936720	1940080	Um, but there you go.
1941600	1942400	It's not fun.
1942400	1947200	It cuts like I have permanent bruising in my shoulders and like, don't get me wrong.
1947760	1949360	I don't want to do this.
1951680	1955440	I would, if I didn't have to, but it just hurts.
1955440	1957280	You know, it just hurts.
1957840	1959040	It just hurts.
1959760	1961120	It is what it is.
1961120	1967360	And I was like, it also, they're not, they make me look a lot bigger than I am.
1968240	1976000	And I don't know if you noticed in the pictures that I posted on, um, my alt Twitter of like my cosplay,
1976000	1984400	but you could see like my tits start very high up and towards the like middle of my torso
1985120	1988000	because they take up a lot of space on my body.
1990000	1992080	Like, uh, I wish I could hold on.
1992080	1996640	Let me see if I can find an, uh, oh, this will work.
2000480	2000980	Oops.
2001140	2012340	So imagine me having the body type that I do, which is very similar to she be here.
2012340	2015220	I do have a bit of a tummy, but you know, I have a womb to protect.
2015220	2017300	So I get a little, a little fat pouch there.
2017300	2018500	I don't really care about that though.
2018980	2023300	Um, so imagine my boob and it, it's like fucking this.
2023300	2026020	Like when you wear a bra and then it makes me look like
2026020	2030980	that, mind you, this is like anime girl.
2030980	2033220	So the proportions are going to be a little bit different.
2033220	2036180	My torso is shorter than my models.
2041220	2044500	It, it would make me look freaking huge, right?
2045380	2046980	Like it would make me look fat.
2049780	2055460	And I've even noticed that because it hides my, um, my curves because I have an hourglass figure
2055460	2056660	and that's what it does to them.
2057620	2058420	It hides them.
2060820	2061940	Obviously they're not that big.
2061940	2067460	Again, the, my torso is different than my model, but like that's what it does.
2067460	2068820	And so it makes it look like
2071940	2075540	that I'm either fat or have huge fucking saggy titties.
2075540	2080020	And I'm like, brother, give me some cute like B cups.
2080020	2084980	So I can wear like, I can wear a shirt with no bra, you know, I want to have,
2084980	2086580	I want to be that powerful, you know?
2088260	2091620	Um, clown nose bitties, squeeze them honk.
2092580	2093700	Clown girl for Jen too.
2093700	2094340	Mom, please.
2094340	2095380	Mom, please.
2095380	2096500	Mother, please.
2096500	2097220	I've been persuade.
2097220	2098100	I've been suede.
2098100	2100340	Slug girl, clown girl.
2100340	2101300	Who else do I want?
2101860	2104180	Um, I want a Lamia now.
2104180	2105060	I want a bug girl.
2108100	2109860	I also really want a pet play girl.
2112100	2112420	Yeah.
2113060	2117780	Although I already know, like several of the concepts for Jen too, but I just,
2117780	2122900	a girl likes to dream, you know, there won't be a slime girl.
2122900	2124340	Moths are overdone.
2124340	2125540	There's like 50 moths.
2127540	2129780	Um, a girl, that's a gun that we say.
2129780	2135940	Honestly, there's not a lot of like, there's like Android V tubers, but like,
2135940	2140580	there's not object V tubers because you'll have like food V tubers and animal V tubers,
2141140	2142260	and animal V tubers.
2142260	2148260	But like, honestly, like, um, like chainsaw man type, like a gun chuba.
2149140	2149940	I'd be pretty sick.
2151620	2152740	I wouldn't be averse to that.
2155620	2156980	This game is super based.
2157860	2158660	Are guns to it?
2158660	2160020	Well, what do you mean?
2160020	2161700	There's so many gun channels on YouTube.
2161700	2166020	I watched this one guy whose name I has evaded me, but he just like,
2166900	2167380	I don't know.
2167380	2171700	I don't know if it's fucked up of me that I like to watch like the different types of
2171700	2177300	bullets they use in different types of, I also like to see how guns work in real life versus
2177300	2181220	the games that I use them with, like play them in, play them with.
2182260	2184020	And oh my God, what the fuck is his name?
2184020	2189540	I have to look it up and he uses like those gel bodies and he's like in the middle of
2189540	2192900	like a desert and I don't know, like, I can't remember where he is at.
2192900	2196420	He's like the middle, not of a desert, but it's like, it looks like Cali, but I don't
2196420	2197220	think it's Cali.
2197780	2200180	Um, and he just shoots it with his friends and they just
2201140	2203620	are pretty, they're just, they just fuck about and it's funny.
2203620	2204180	Garen Thump.
2204180	2204660	Yes.
2205460	2205940	Thank you.
2207300	2207780	Thank you.
2207780	2207940	Yeah.
2207940	2208420	Garen Thump.
2208420	2208660	Yep.
2208660	2209540	That's him.
2209540	2209780	Yeah.
2210500	2210820	Yeah.
2210820	2211700	That's, that's the guy.
2213380	2216580	I want to get my, my, my, my license to carry.
2216580	2217460	I'm not going to lie to you.
2219380	2221220	Um, I've always wanted to learn how to shoot.
2221220	2224820	My grandfather tried to teach me how to learn how to shoot, but then my mom said no.
2225700	2226500	And I was sad.
2227220	2233620	And it's funny though, because my mom has literally worked as part of her job before.
2233620	2243860	She worked with a, uh, a, a team of SEALs and for some like team bonding exercise,
2243860	2245940	she learned how to clear rooms and shoot.
2245940	2247780	And she was like the best shooter.
2247780	2251620	And one of the, my mom was telling me that one of the soldiers is like flirting with her.
2252420	2253860	And saying how good of a shot she was.
2253940	2255460	And she's like, he, he, he, he, he, he.
2257460	2264100	And my mom's like very like, sort of scared of like, does it like violence?
2264100	2267060	And I'm like, mom, be fucking for real.
2267060	2273780	Like in my life, my mom probably would have been in the military or running a 14, 500 company.
2273780	2274740	Cause she's that badass.
2275940	2278020	Um, Spec Ops mom.
2278020	2278340	Yeah.
2278340	2279940	No, she's a, she's a good shot.
2279940	2280420	She is.
2281780	2282660	My mom's badass.
2282660	2286340	I don't think my, I don't think my dad's ever shot like at a range or anything.
2286340	2287220	I have to ask him.
2288180	2290420	Um, I don't know if he even wears that.
2290420	2292580	She V's father is some random SEAL, dude.
2294500	2296020	No, this, I was around.
2297060	2298740	This is not before I was born.
2301540	2306820	Well, yeah, I'm, I'm also, I'm pretty good with the airsoft rifle and I'm very good at archery
2307700	2308340	from camp.
2308340	2310820	Um, so not to my own horn.
2311780	2315060	Uh, but I do like, I do like shooting.
2315060	2319940	I think it's really good way to release like pent up stress.
2320580	2322980	Um, especially you're doing it in a safe environment.
2323540	2324820	I would love to get lessons.
2325700	2329220	Um, I do have some friends who are military.
2329220	2332500	So like harem's airsoft one, that'd be fun.
2332500	2336820	Oh, like a paintball off collab would be sick.
2337620	2340340	Um, previous girl scout credentials.
2341700	2342660	Are there any SEAL tubers?
2342660	2343300	Yeah, there's a few.
2344340	2347140	Oh, like I thought you meant like SEALs, like the animal.
2347140	2354260	Um, no, this, I don't, there's the only military related person I can think of as the horse.
2354900	2357380	Uh, is it Tomoe or Tomo?
2358020	2359060	She's like a horse girl.
2359940	2363620	Um, and there's definitely, there's not a lot of military oriented.
2364260	2369380	Like they'll have like old school, general artwork of them, but they're not like actually
2369460	2370820	like military base.
2370820	2372420	You know, there's a, there's a niche there.
2373140	2376740	There's a niche there at some airsoft stuff to throw.
2376740	2378100	No, where am I going to use it?
2378100	2379700	I don't, there's no ranges near me.
2379700	2380420	Umari Tomo.
2380420	2380660	Yes.
2380660	2381380	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
2381380	2381860	Yes, sir.
2381860	2382340	She's cool.
2382980	2385540	Um, I love her, her character's design.
2386580	2389620	Um, close enough.
2389620	2392020	Well, I can't pretty guys know, I can't pronounce Japanese names.
2393220	2394500	Uh, a few tactical VTubers.
2394500	2398340	And then I don't know where VSPO EN is.
2398340	2399700	I always call them vispo.
2399700	2402020	Um, like where are they?
2402020	2402740	Where are they?
2403300	2404260	Where's their gen?
2404260	2405460	Where's the EN gen?
2407380	2409540	I applied for that a year ago.
2410500	2416100	They gave me a few views, but of course you sell.
2416100	2417540	I didn't get a call back.
2417540	2419460	I'm happy I didn't be alert.
2420020	2424420	Um, because again, I told you guys I used to do a lot of, uh, FPS games.
2424500	2426020	So I thought I could make it in.
2426020	2428900	And this is even before I became a VTuber,
2428900	2430580	like before I even was Rena.
2430580	2434740	So I just applied as myself, just normal me.
2436100	2438100	Um, what gun did I shoot before?
2438100	2438820	I don't know.
2440180	2441540	I remember I shot a rifle.
2443140	2446340	Uh, it was like a type of rifle.
2446340	2446740	I don't know.
2446740	2447700	I can't remember that shit.
2448660	2452580	Just because I watch gun stuff doesn't mean I know what everything's about.
2455460	2458740	The SPO has the highest standards in industry because you have to be good at it.
2458740	2462340	But they're like, but then again, like think about who owns the SPO.
2462980	2464580	Or I was calling VISPO because it's fun.
2465460	2466580	Owns VESPA.
2466580	2467220	VISPO.
2467220	2468340	Um, Brave Group.
2468900	2473620	And Brave Group has already seen how successful that, um,
2475140	2480420	before Mariah and Globi are in their normal gens.
2480420	2482100	And I think I'm missing one, but I forget.
2482660	2486500	Um, there are a lot of FPS girls, girlies.
2487060	2487620	I don't know.
2487620	2488980	I'm like, maybe they're being trained.
2488980	2492180	Maybe they're, maybe they scrapped the project and focused on V for Mariah.
2492180	2492660	I don't know.
2492660	2493220	I don't know.
2497220	2502420	But, and I know like they want to do competitive gaming as well.
2502420	2505700	So, oh, thank you, boy, for the 10 gifted.
2505700	2507620	Oh, thank you very much.
2507620	2508340	Appreciate it.
2509460	2510260	You rise up.
2510580	2512420	But, um, yeah, sometimes.
2512420	2517140	And then actually, can we, can we just like talk about like VTubing stuff for a second?
2517780	2524900	Like, I'm not a, I'm someone who's very interested in the comings and goings of the
2524900	2528900	VTubing industry and community stuff.
2530100	2539220	And I tweeted yesterday as a joke, um, that I'm like, I'm going to hijack TVS.
2539620	2540100	Okay.
2540100	2544340	Things that VTubers say run by a false ID, uh, because he hasn't been covering small
2544340	2551620	Corpo stuff and only like needy shit and someone called like someone fucking tagged
2551620	2557540	him in it like he liked the tweet and I was like, lol, I was kidding.
2557540	2558980	Cause I'm going to make my own.
2560020	2562580	I like, I definitely want to make some of you.
2562580	2565220	I used to be a commentator, YouTuber.
2565220	2573140	Um, and I would like to do an unbiased, uh, what's it called, just like segment, not like
2573140	2579780	too long, just talking about smaller agency news, cause that's been sorely lacking for
2579780	2581300	the last little bit.
2581300	2584180	Um, so I feel like that would be fun.
2585380	2586580	Damn, you done it all.
2586580	2587220	Yeah.
2587220	2590340	Again, you guys, I said it before, I used to work for VTubing.
2590340	2593140	Um, I, this wouldn't be drama based.
2593140	2598660	I wouldn't, I would probably, uh, and I would also like look to you guys as like a resource.
2598660	2603140	I'm smacking my headphones, um, to like be like, oh, what do you think I should talk
2603140	2603700	about?
2603700	2608260	Or like maybe make him into shorts, um, just but like only focus on agency VTubers.
2608260	2609540	Cause I think that would be fun.
2609540	2611780	Um, and Shawnee was like, hell yeah.
2611780	2613060	And I was like, yeah.
2613060	2615460	And then Shawnee's been supporting a lot of my ideas lately.
2615460	2620260	And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like,
2620740	2623700	so I want to like think of a name and stuff and get that ball rolling.
2623700	2628260	I've been thinking about it before like back when I was Renna that I would do something
2628260	2634500	like that, um, but I would cover like all news, but as an indie, but now being agency,
2634500	2638180	I would rather just want to cover other like my agency and other agencies.
2638660	2641220	Um, I know that might be a conflict of interest.
2641220	2642260	I get that.
2642260	2647140	Um, but I would probably only like objectively just say like, hey, this is what's going on.
2647140	2649860	I'm not injecting feeling into it.
2649860	2653460	Um, so be sucky VTuber news.
2653460	2655220	Uh, should be news.
2655220	2656340	Yeah, if you count me in.
2656340	2657940	I'm going to have this TV, yeah.
2657940	2662020	Um, actually, I was very thankful he didn't cover us because I think we've got,
2662020	2662980	we've gotten more hate.
2662980	2672340	Um, I've said before that when him and other VTubers first covered us debuting or being
2672340	2676980	created in any mention of it, uh, they focused more in the negative comments
2677540	2680420	or assumptions of the company.
2680900	2686100	Um, and I feel like they might do the same if they covered us again, although because
2686100	2687620	he liked my tweet, I'm kind of worried.
2687620	2689780	I'm just like, oh, fuck, is he going to cover us for the next one?
2689780	2690500	So who knows?
2691060	2696500	Um, but whatever the fucking hat, no, it is what it is rabbit hole news.
2697940	2698500	Are you funny?
2700020	2701060	Um, but yeah.
2701060	2706580	And then I'm like, I can like, I can't do, I have to make drama to get on, but that's not
2706660	2707220	my goal.
2707220	2710580	I don't want to, I don't like drama.
2710580	2717380	I don't, um, I would, you could ask anybody that I'm friends with, uh, in the girls.
2717380	2723940	Like I'm someone who if I hear anything like whispers of unrest, I'm like, let's get to
2723940	2724500	the bottom of it.
2724500	2725700	Let's talk, let's do this.
2725700	2726260	What's going on?
2726260	2729300	Not that that hasn't even happened, but they just know I'm that type of person.
2729860	2732980	Um, there's not such a thing as bad publicity.
2737540	2749060	I think there is for our case, just because of the content we do, uh, I don't know.
2749060	2755860	Like I just feel like for us would be more of a detriment to our brand, but, and then
2755860	2758100	just show how unprofessional we are.
2758100	2764180	If I like, if we got into any sort of that stuff, um, sure drama alert girl.
2764980	2766900	Um, haters gonna hate.
2767620	2767940	Yeah.
2767940	2771300	And it's like, and it's bad if it messes with your mental health.
2771300	2771700	Yes.
2771700	2776260	I wouldn't want to, I'm like, I'm here to talk about what's happened.
2776260	2780900	I don't want to talk about how these two girls are bitching at each other because this,
2780900	2781860	this and that happened.
2782500	2785700	I'm going to say, yeah, I'm not, I don't care about that stuff.
2788980	2791780	It is disappointing when there's really never any updates on something that does
2791780	2792500	is negative.
2792500	2793380	Yeah, it is.
2793380	2801060	It's kind of a let down, uh, cause like I'm always someone who I'm like, celebrate the
2801060	2801940	little victories.
2802260	2809140	Um, and lately, anytime I look at something VTuber news related or VTuber related, um,
2809140	2813220	or like coverage of it, it's usually something negative and it makes me sad because there's
2813220	2817860	a bunch of like good things happening in the community every day.
2818500	2826260	Um, but then again, like that's not, the news doesn't report like the regular news doesn't
2826260	2829220	report unhappy things anymore either.
2829220	2833860	I don't even watch news, like actual like human news anymore because they don't report
2833860	2834740	on anything.
2834740	2839380	Like it's usually like tragedy or like something bad or the weather.
2841380	2847540	Um, so, and then I totally get why he would do that because Nidhi was up his ass.
2847540	2848900	He's like, let me go up his ass.
2848900	2849780	Let me go up their ass.
2849780	2850740	And I'm like, you know what?
2850740	2851220	I got it.
2851780	2857620	Um, but I liked to watch it when I was an indie so I could see what like kind of what
2857620	2859700	the tone was for agencies.
2860340	2866180	Um, and also like what indies were doing in the, in the VTuber community because I just,
2866180	2870260	I want to know everybody was up to, um, now I just don't watch any of it at all.
2872100	2873060	I just listened.
2873060	2876820	I like to listen to like video essays now about like things that have happened in the
2876820	2877220	past.
2877780	2882580	Um, I think that's interesting because I like to educate myself on VTuber history because
2882580	2884820	again, I've only been a VTuber for six months.
2884820	2891620	I've known and been part of the community and a consumer of VTubers since they, um,
2892580	2898660	since they've been around, um, since they started back like before in like 2019 or even
2898660	2899700	further than that.
2899700	2904900	But I never was like in it in it, you know, VTuber weather segment.
2904900	2906100	It'd be really funny.
2906100	2907380	I'm out in a weather segment.
2907380	2917060	I would just make makeup like random fake places and be like, it's currently sunny in
2917060	2917940	Topeka.
2917940	2918500	What is it?
2918500	2919940	It's raining in Topeka.
2919940	2921860	It was something like foster's home for measuring friends.
2922740	2926740	Um, hop, happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m.
2928100	2930180	Happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m.
2930180	2931700	With your hottie host, Sheebie.
2932340	2938020	I'd have to work on my transatlantic accent because I can't, um, it's, it would be hard to
2939220	2941140	because I need to do like the news voice.
2944260	2946980	And tonight we're expecting a light drizzle in Wonderland.
2950180	2951700	Later tonight at 6 p.m.
2952820	2954820	What is strongy shoving up her ass?
2962660	2963460	Oh my God.
2965220	2966020	Where are my mods?
2967540	2968100	They're gone.
2968100	2969220	They're like, she's late an hour.
2969220	2969860	I can't do it.
2972580	2973860	I'll do it myself.
2975060	2976580	I'll do it myself.
2981780	2984580	Tomorrow, it's going to be raining urine.
2984580	2987300	So make sure you have your umbrellas or open your mouth.
2988340	2990820	Um, sometimes I sound like I'm from a commercial and I do that.
2990900	2992340	Strongy catching strings.
2995780	3001220	Hey guys, can we not, can we stop talking about my investor in the chat?
3001220	3001860	Thank you.
3001860	3002420	Kisses.
3003700	3008660	Unnecessary speculation going on about where people are from, which is,
3009460	3011780	you don't need to know because it doesn't matter.
3011780	3012820	Just enjoy their content.
3013700	3017060	Um, that's a meme if I ever heard it.
3017780	3023620	The rabbit's foot segment goes, and it's just me stepping like just like heel clacking noises.
3025220	3025940	That'd be funny.
3028020	3032420	There is an Aurora Borealis localized entirely in Icy's kitchen.
3032420	3033620	How is she doing it?
3036580	3041860	Tonight at BunnyBun capacity, what's going into she being and how much?
3047060	3050500	That was good.
3050500	3051460	That was, that was good.
3051460	3052580	I'll give you that.
3052580	3053380	I'll give you that.
3057860	3058340	Okay.
3058340	3059220	Need a quick look back.
3060500	3068820	Oh, but, but, and then like also like, um, I would just, I just like to talk about VTubers.
3068820	3069780	Like it was cool.
3069780	3075060	I'm very excited to see the debuts for the new EN girls from Hall of Live.
3075060	3079780	I didn't anticipate for them, for there to be a new gen so soon.
3079780	3081620	I thought it was going to be a couple more months.
3082660	3087060	Um, although everybody had kind of already surmised who was going to be who, but you know,
3087060	3088260	like training and all that.
3088260	3093220	And I'm wondering if they were hired on or scouted previously because models don't
3093220	3097220	take a very long time to make unless they cranked them out because I know they have in-house people.
3098020	3100980	And they have obviously being Hall of Live have pulled in the industry.
3100980	3105860	But, um, uh, Raora Panthera, I can't pronounce anybody's names.
3105860	3106660	Please don't hurt me.
3106660	3108500	Raora Panthera, I love her design.
3109540	3112180	I love her concept is so true to her.
3112180	3115300	If you know who she is, uh, being an amazing artist and everything.
3116020	3118100	I really like the short stack.
3118980	3121460	Um, I feel like she'll be really silly.
3122500	3128660	And then I feel like Blood Flame, Elizabeth Rose Blood Flame is just
3129220	3131220	Narissa Red.
3133300	3134420	Narissa in red.
3134980	3138980	Um, so, but I like, I, everybody's, and then I was
3138980	3142340	chuckling at the automaton's last name, Immigrate.
3144260	3147540	And then I'm like, she kind of looks like mint, but they look amazing.
3147540	3148100	They look amazing.
3148100	3151540	Like, and she probably does plays violin or does some sort of music.
3151540	3156900	And so I can't wait to see the type of talents they'll possess and everything.
3156900	3158500	And just like, how fun they'll be.
3159060	3163140	I usually, I usually don't watch, um, Hollow Live or Niji just because
3163780	3165140	I don't want to fall in love again.
3166020	3166820	She worry.
3166820	3173300	Um, but, uh, it's, and it's also hard because you don't get the intimacy of a smaller
3173300	3174260	streamer in chat.
3174260	3175860	That's why I like smaller agencies.
3175860	3178100	And that's why my Oshi is in the smaller agency.
3178660	3181460	Um, so it's, yeah.
3182020	3182520	Yeah.
3184020	3186180	Trony does give us this Scorches style.
3187140	3188820	Yeah, my favorite is Rod Bunny is live.
3188820	3189220	How's it going?
3189220	3190180	We're going, we're doing all that.
3190180	3190680	Okay.
3191780	3192660	I'm agreeing.
3192660	3193700	Sounds like an intro.
3196420	3197220	Irma Gurd.
3198580	3200500	Everybody sounds like Irma Gurd names.
3200500	3201540	Yeah, that's true.
3201540	3202180	That's funny.
3202900	3207700	Um, yeah, just, it's, it's, it just stay, and you can usually only
3207700	3210500	communicate through like, text-to-speech donations.
3211060	3213860	Um, which is funny because it makes for amazing clips and everything.
3213860	3217460	And people write some really funny shit, but like, I like this.
3217460	3218180	I can read chat.
3218740	3222420	I honestly probably know all of you.
3222420	3226340	It's like, right now I don't really see a lot of unfamiliar faces.
3226340	3227700	So I have my regulars.
3227700	3231700	And so it's very nice to have a closer intimate fan base.
3231700	3232740	Who is my Oshi?
3232740	3233620	You don't need to know.
3234180	3236740	That's for me to know and you to never to find out.
3236740	3237460	She's mine.
3237460	3238740	I'm gatekeeping her.
3238740	3239460	Okay.
3239460	3239940	Thank you.
3240820	3244420	Um, model actually is a violin, plays a bassoon, calling it now.
3244420	3245620	I bet she's multi-talented.
3245620	3247300	I bet she can like, play piano and stuff.
3247860	3249060	Um, name a salt.
3249060	3251060	Well, I'm not going to read your names right now.
3251060	3252820	Oh wait, I see a new name.
3252820	3254020	You must be a lurker.
3256500	3257460	But thank you guys.
3257460	3262340	If you're new and you remembered, um, I am, I do recognize a lot of you,
3262340	3264260	but so don't think I don't know who you are.
3264260	3265780	I appreciate all of you.
3266340	3267620	Especially my lurkers.
3267620	3269940	Because even though you don't talk, you're still watching.
3269940	3271380	You still got me in the background.
3271380	3272900	And I care about you for that.
3272900	3273780	Thank you.
3273780	3276340	Um, she remembers.
3284020	3285380	Um, I do be lurking though.
3285380	3286340	Yeah, that's fine.
3286340	3286820	I lurk.
3286820	3288580	I, I don't talk.
3289780	3290980	Wind streams.
3290980	3293700	Um, because like, I have like a whole alt account.
3294260	3296820	Like, not, not even like Rena.
3297220	3302260	Um, like I have like my own personal account that I like, I watch VTubers on.
3302260	3302900	And I just lurk.
3302900	3303700	I don't say anything.
3304180	3308340	Um, and like, yeah, I'm trying to think.
3308340	3312180	I think I only, the only time I ever talked was when Strawny,
3312180	3313780	Strawny was someplace else.
3315220	3318500	And that's, and like, that's how you like, I don't talk in streams.
3318500	3320660	And then she got me to want to talk in streams.
3320660	3321700	That's how amazing she is.
3322660	3327140	Yeah, and I usually have streams in the background too for background noise.
3327140	3329860	I know a lot of you guys do that or like, and because I know sometimes I stream
3329860	3330660	when people are working.
3331940	3335780	Um, so yeah, speaking of streaming, I haven't started the game yet,
3335780	3338420	but I kind of feel like yapping because this is going to be a long stream.
3338420	3345700	Um, I'm, maybe this will be an endurance stream, uh, just because, um, I love this game.
3346980	3348500	And I love spending time with you guys.
3348500	3350820	Um, I'm just ashamed of my green name status.
3350820	3352580	That's why I lurk.
3356580	3358420	Oh, yeah, hide yourself.
3358420	3359380	I don't show your face.
3359380	3361940	Gray name, terrible.
3361940	3362980	No, I'm kidding.
3362980	3377540	Um, but, uh, even if you're not green and your name is gray, don't think I don't appreciate you.
3377780	3380180	Um, I just appreciate you less now.
3382660	3384900	Ow, hurt my rib laughing like that.
3385700	3390020	Um, also, um, Immi, I think is going live right now.
3390020	3392820	So if you wanted to go see Immi, uh, I forget what she's playing,
3392820	3394100	but you can go check her out.
3394740	3398260	Um, her, her info is in my description as well.
3398900	3401540	Um, what build do you tend to go for?
3401540	3403140	I kind of just wing it every run.
3404100	3406260	I used to abuse the Orborus.
3406260	3408660	Oh, thank you for the 10 gifted authority.
3408660	3409060	Thank you.
3409860	3410580	Appreciate it.
3410580	3412900	Speaking of which, I don't know if anybody, I don't have my headphones on,
3412900	3414740	so I can't hear if somebody like don't know.
3415300	3415860	Let me look.
3417860	3420020	I need, I'm, I might get IEMs.
3420740	3425620	Um, what do I mean?
3425620	3429300	I remember what they're called, but like the essentially earbuds,
3429300	3433300	just because headphones with my glasses on hurt my ears.
3433940	3436420	They're the ones that these are in ear monitors.
3436420	3436660	Yeah.
3439220	3440260	Um,
3440260	3443460	You just get more spit from Georgia Tech U.
3445460	3450020	Um, but no, like if you show up, that's all that matters to me.
3450580	3457540	Um, I also decided because I'm starting to think it's causing
3457540	3460260	somewhere divide between everybody's fan bases.
3460820	3463860	I don't mind if you have somebody else's Oshimarks in your name.
3465300	3470340	I was doing it for Kayfabe, um, but I'm realizing I don't like,
3471300	3475780	like I'm pretending to be mad because you like somebody else.
3475780	3481700	It's you can like multiple streamers, especially ones in our gen.
3482420	3486500	Um, and yeah, I just
3487860	3488340	I don't know.
3490980	3493620	I've been here since be a lure first form on Twitter.
3493620	3495220	I feel like an old woman.
3495220	3498180	Can't wait to see you all grow and have the privilege of looking back on these streams.
3498180	3499860	Oh, yeah.
3499860	3501940	It's, I've been there since the beginning too.
3501940	3503140	So I'm right there with you, sis.
3505860	3507140	I can't see a new she beat.
3507140	3508260	It's for me, not you.
3508820	3509860	Keep it in the family.
3509860	3510260	Yeah.
3510260	3511300	Keep it in the family.
3511300	3512100	That's how what I'll say.
3512100	3513380	You can keep it in the family.
3514340	3516260	Although like, but it's funny because I'll like,
3516260	3517700	I'll see other people's Oh, she marks.
3517700	3521060	Like I think I saw like a Maya whispers and like she's a, oh my God,
3522100	3527060	a giant fucking June bug just landed on my window and scared the shit out of me.
3527060	3527540	Holy crap.
3527540	3528180	The thing is huge.
3528660	3531140	Um, staring at me.
3531780	3533140	But like, I like a Maya whisper.
3533140	3535620	She's a good, you know, as martyrs and stuff.
3535620	3536740	So I'm like, I don't really care.
3538180	3544340	Um, I just like, I just, I'm a type of person and I think that's why me and
3544340	3546660	strongy are so much alike that I'm like, just support everybody.
3547300	3549300	If you can do what you can.
3549860	3553460	If you want, cause you know, everybody's so talented.
3556020	3556740	Everybody's so cool.
3556740	3558900	Cause like, I love a lot of the other agency girls.
3558900	3560020	Again, I used to be indie.
3560020	3568100	I followed and looked up to a lot of the people that are, yeah, but so I'm like, I can't be like,
3568100	3570100	Oh my God, don't hate me.
3570660	3572020	Don't, don't, don't stop.
3572580	3573380	Can't love.
3573380	3574340	You have to love me more.
3575380	3579140	I just want you to love me more or less.
3581060	3588740	Um, and I think, yeah, I think, I think it's a healthier mentality for me.
3588740	3590340	Cause I do, I, I'll be honest with you.
3590340	3596660	I do get jealous and I realize feeding into that mindset for me for kayfabe is,
3596660	3598020	is actually not good for me.
3598660	3607060	Um, cause I remember back when I was Rina, I would feel immense jealousy when something happens.
3607060	3611460	And now I'm just like, no, I've kind of grown from that.
3612980	3618740	Um, cause I'm just like, why am I upset that somebody else is supporting a streamer that I also enjoy?
3620820	3621780	I'm like, fuck that.
3621780	3623460	No, like that's, no.
3624420	3630180	But, um, again, and another thing, cause I was asking Mercy to explain it to me.
3630820	3635140	Um, because I know she, she, uh, she gets bothered by stuff.
3635140	3640340	Um, so she was explaining to, I smacked my mic, explaining to me like, oh, she culture,
3640340	3643620	like, and what, how, what oh, she's mean and commie.
3643620	3648340	Not that I didn't know already, but just like on a deeper level, like really picking it apart
3648340	3650500	and like telling me, so I really appreciated her to do that.
3650500	3651380	Cause then I understand.
3651380	3653940	I'm like, oh, I got it.
3653940	3654660	I understand.
3654660	3655140	I get it.
3655140	3656340	Like not this.
3656340	3657460	Thank you for explaining it to me.
3658020	3660820	Um, don't want to put sugar in chat.
3660820	3667380	I do, again, I, again, I do, if you, I do want you to be collared to me, but I can't force you to do that.
3667940	3672900	Um, there's just she be only she be, and I've also kind of just decided and then like,
3672900	3676500	cause I was talking to a straw knee and one of the managers about it too.
3676500	3691620	Um, I think I put too much effort in stock into a kayfabe, um, which is my kayfabe is,
3691620	3693780	you know, dummy mommy mistress.
3693780	3695140	Oh, I'm going to step on you.
3695860	3705300	When the reason I was hired was because of my voice and my personality.
3706260	3712420	I wasn't, it's not like I'm acting and cast to play an actual character.
3712420	3713700	That's not what V tubing is.
3715060	3718900	Uh, it's like who's line is it anyway?
3718900	3720100	Where the points don't matter.
3720180	3723780	The kayfabe barely fucking matters only for like assets.
3723780	3726820	A little bit of backstory for your appearance, vice versa.
3727460	3732260	Um, kayfabe, if you don't know is a wrestling term, which is like your lore, your backstory,
3732260	3734660	your history of their character that you play.
3735220	3741380	Um, and I was just, and this might filter some people and that's fine.
3741380	3747460	And I was talking to strongy and one of the managers about it and I was just like, I had,
3747460	3752740	I said to her, I'm like, I realized the other day because I was having so much imposter syndrome
3752740	3756820	because I was like getting so worked up that I wasn't good enough to be she be.
3757860	3760580	And then strong is like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, shut up.
3760580	3763940	Like you were always meant to be she be you were my she be.
3763940	3768260	I didn't pick you because you could be a dummy mommy because I wasn't.
3768260	3775540	If you guys don't know who I was, I was Rina who was a fucking lolly sub bitch brown cat.
3775540	3777700	Like I'm total opposite of me.
3777700	3778900	She's like, I picked you for you.
3779540	3780820	And I'm like, you know what?
3780820	3781700	And that goes for the other girls.
3781700	3784900	She picked us for us, not the characters we play.
3788420	3791140	But like I enjoy playing into the dummy mommy.
3792260	3794180	Like don't don't get me wrong.
3794180	3795380	I do like doing that.
3796340	3800180	Um, because I do like, you know, getting you guys little riles up.
3800180	3807220	Oh, um, and I was just like, you know what?
3807220	3807780	You're fucking right.
3807780	3814020	I'm not going to have imposter syndrome anymore because she picked me out of hundreds of other
3814020	3816660	people just because I'm a goofy motherfucker.
3816660	3816980	Okay.
3816980	3819220	She watched, she sat down and watched my streams.
3820180	3825300	The team that she hired also like she selected me and then she went to the team was like,
3825300	3826100	what do you guys think?
3826100	3827380	And they're like, oh yeah, 100%.
3827380	3828260	She's our first choice.
3829220	3833540	So at the end of the day, I'm just going to be me.
3834660	3835380	You'll get dumb.
3835380	3836260	You'll get girl fail.
3836260	3836740	You'll get this.
3836740	3837220	You get that.
3837860	3840420	Um, and that's made me feel so much more better.
3841300	3841780	Just real.
3841780	3847540	I'm like, and it's funny because nobody fucking cares about kayfabe in the VTuber community,
3847540	3848660	except lately for us.
3849460	3852180	I'm like, nobody usually cares about fucking lore.
3852900	3854740	But suddenly everybody cares about us.
3854740	3856260	Stick it to our fucking lore.
3857060	3857540	You can't see.
3857540	3859780	I'm shaking my hands, leaning back.
3861380	3868340	Um, and yeah, I'm like, I'm just, and I'm not saying this because like I'm angry or anything.
3868340	3870900	I'm just saying this because like I've come to the realization.
3871860	3877700	Like I, I'm becoming more comfortable being she be like, I feel like she's me now
3878420	3880260	because I'm acting as myself.
3880260	3883220	I'm not pretending to be someone I'm not because then you just get burnt out and you
3883220	3884260	just get unhappy.
3884260	3888500	And that's where a lot of VTubers crash and burn is because they think they have to
3888500	3891940	play an actual character when in fact they were just hired for their voice
3892660	3897380	and for who they were in their content prior to being cast.
3898180	3903780	Um, but yeah, uh, also new.
3903780	3904900	Yeah, I'm new.
3904900	3908020	Like, don't forget that I haven't finished VTuber for long.
3908660	3918420	Um, for ABVTubers, it's not kfave, it's anti-tax, which are on my Patreon.
3918420	3920740	Like you still get that stuff on my Patreon.
3921460	3930340	Um, yeah, I think everybody shouldn't care that much about stuff because like, look at
3930340	3932020	Icy, she's supposed to be a brat.
3932020	3933380	She's so cute and sweet.
3933380	3934100	That's fine.
3934740	3937860	And then look at Amy, she was supposed to be the sweet and cute one and she's a brat.
3938180	3938900	And that's great.
3941140	3947700	And then Azura is, you know, she's like quirky, funny, um, giggly little goat.
3947700	3951220	And she's not like, oh, my sweet little boy all the time.
3951220	3951860	That's fine.
3952420	3954980	And then like, you know, strongy is strongy.
3954980	3956420	And then Mercy's Mercy.
3956420	3960340	And like you guys fall in love with us because of us, not because of the,
3961940	3964900	because of our pat, like our fake kfave, you know?
3965700	3968340	And yeah, it's great.
3968340	3974100	Like it's not even Gap Moe, like, because it doesn't matter that much because we were
3974100	3975060	meant to be these people.
3975780	3976980	Azura is also a brat.
3976980	3978180	Ooh, I didn't know that.
3978900	3980980	Like, oh yeah, we're, we're a wacky little gang.
3982020	3983460	I'm just a funky little rabbit.
3985460	3987540	Um, yeah.
3987540	3989380	And the chemistry is authentic.
3990020	3992100	Um, bad of anatomy.
3992180	3994740	I added to my schedule next week a drawing stream.
3994740	3996740	So I hope you guys will enjoy that.
3997620	4000580	Um, yes.
4000580	4007700	And it's like, I don't have to be that.
4007700	4012500	That's, that's in the other content that's in the Patreon.
4013620	4019540	And I don't want you guys to put so much pressure on yourselves or the girls to be
4019540	4023220	like, oh, like, I know a lot of people don't watch me because they're like, oh,
4023220	4024740	I'm not into hard fandom.
4025940	4029940	But I'm like, I'm not doming the chat 24 seven.
4029940	4036660	Like that's not like, give everybody a chance because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
4036660	4041540	Like you probably are watching me right now saying, oh, I don't think I'd like one of the
4041540	4044020	smaller girls because I like big jugs.
4044980	4049060	Um, yeah, but like, Amy's funny as fuck.
4049060	4050020	So go watch her.
4051220	4053780	She's just as base as I am, if not more.
4053780	4055220	I know she's definitely more than me.
4057540	4059940	But, uh, yeah, just here to be entertained.
4059940	4061300	Oops, all brass.
4063060	4068900	Uh, but it's, it's like, is it?
4068900	4070900	Yeah, you're supposed to be dominant, but you show up.
4070900	4073140	No, no, no, I'm not supposed to be anything.
4074180	4076100	I'm just supposed to be myself.
4076900	4078020	And that's the mindset.
4078020	4085380	I want to teach you guys is that all the girls are not supposed to be this, this, or that
4086900	4091540	because of a kayfabe and like a character design.
4092580	4093620	We're just us.
4095460	4098900	I'm just she be and you're just can.
4098900	4110500	Um, she's telling us by teaching us, but like, naturally, I'll still pull out like,
4110500	4113220	you know, don't get it twisted.
4114580	4120660	I still will beat you when you're naughty because I like that part of my kayfube.
4120660	4121700	I like leaning into that.
4121700	4125540	And the girls do like, do like leaning into different parts of theirs.
4126100	4131380	Um, but I just wanted to make that distinction for everyone that we were hired to be us.
4132100	4137300	And I don't want you to get so wrapped up, you, the viewer, you, the fan to get so wrapped up
4137300	4145380	and want somebody, um, should be like due to their lore that you don't enjoy their, their,
4146340	4148180	their content because you can enjoy.
4148180	4152020	So like, I'm not gonna, let me, I'm trying to think of somebody.
4152900	4157780	Uh, I'm not a huge fan of mystery novels.
4158900	4161620	Does that mean I'm going to hate Amelia Watson?
4162900	4169380	No, she's funny because she's, she'll play into stuff sometimes, but she's not constantly
4169380	4170980	searching for mysteries.
4172740	4174740	Um, who am I?
4174740	4175380	I'm she be.
4176100	4178260	I'm she be just me.
4178260	4181060	You can find out who I am by watching me stream.
4182020	4182740	You aren't enough.
4183620	4185940	Atmospheric people make your mom jokes and such.
4185940	4186660	That's what I like.
4187860	4189300	I'm not big into Dom in general.
4189300	4191140	And it's like how she be expresses herself.
4191140	4192980	Yeah, exactly.
4192980	4194340	I want you to watch me for me.
4195460	4203300	Not because of the tags that are associated with my ASMR content on Patreon.
4203300	4206420	You know, um, what do you mean she's not detective?
4212980	4216100	The real mystery was the friend she made along the way.
4216740	4217700	Oh, hi.
4218340	4222580	Feeling like I can hire Amelia to find my dad.
4222580	4223380	Oh my God.
4224660	4225300	Oh, really?
4225300	4226580	I can find your mom in these.
4227220	4227940	Your mom.
4228980	4230740	I like listening to your voices soothing.
4230740	4231940	Yeah, I'm a yapper.
4232660	4234980	I'm a yappiest yabbit in all the West.
4236260	4237620	I mean, you don't own a brothel.
4237620	4238260	No, I do.
4238260	4240500	Don't, that's actually real.
4241300	4241700	Sorry.
4242980	4246420	But please, in short, give all the girls a chance.
4247300	4253380	Just because you don't like a certain tag doesn't mean you won't enjoy their content.
4253380	4256580	Because we're all just cute girls doing cute things.
4256580	4260740	And I would hate for you to miss out on cute girls being cute.
4263220	4263540	You know?
4264020	4271060	If you have another Oshimark besides Madams,
4271060	4271940	nook if you book.
4272740	4273860	Nook if you book.
4273860	4274340	Right.
4274340	4275300	No, if you book.
4275940	4276900	Instantly plays.
4276900	4277780	Get ready.
4281860	4283300	Thank you for the tip, Anonymous.
4286740	4289540	I think when I see somebody else's Oshimark, I just know that
4289540	4294660	you are really passionate about other creators.
4295620	4297460	And I know you still like me.
4300260	4306900	And I've learned not to take personally that you like us in different ways.
4306900	4312180	And there's only so many characters you can do to put in somebody's name.
4313300	4316660	I see people with a bazillion Oshimarks in their name.
4316660	4317540	It looks fucking cluttered.
4317540	4318980	So I get it if you just want one.
4320340	4323780	Because then I recognize the majority of them.
4323780	4325540	Like there's one that's Azura's.
4328580	4332420	And I'm like, yeah, I love Azura.
4332420	4333220	Or if it was somebody else.
4333220	4334260	Oh, yeah, I see Stroneys.
4334260	4335140	Yeah, I love Stroneys.
4335140	4336980	Or if it was like some girl from Pixelink.
4336980	4339380	Oh, yeah, I love Kana.
4339380	4339780	You know?
4341220	4343540	It's yeah, so nice knowing people support my friends.
4343540	4344660	That's all I care about.
4344660	4348660	I am the type of person as a streamer that if I ever got like
4349620	4353540	blew the fuck up, I would be doing everything in my power.
4353540	4354100	Literally.
4354100	4356260	This is why I want to join a vealer because
4356260	4358260	Stroneys doing exactly what I wanted to do.
4360020	4363460	I'm like, I just want to raise up smaller creators to a bigger platform
4363460	4366500	and support them and give them stuff so they can do whatever they want.
4366500	4369300	And have a great time and chase their creative dreams.
4369300	4370500	That's what I would fucking want too.
4372980	4374180	What if you don't like Lawley?
4378340	4379220	I don't know what to tell you.
4380420	4380900	Uh.
4384020	4384660	Start liking them.
4384660	4387620	I don't know if you don't like the body type.
4388740	4392020	It's like, yeah, people don't like, I won't watch some streamers
4392020	4393540	because I don't like the art style of their model.
4394100	4394980	So I totally get that.
4395940	4397780	I'm like, I'm not into super Western eyes.
4397780	4401380	Like mine's a little bit Western, but not too much art styles.
4403460	4404500	So like, that's fine.
4404500	4405860	I'm not going to fuck them.
4405940	4410900	Yeah, but like, I used to also not like that type of body type model
4410900	4411540	than I watched.
4412260	4413380	Uh, who was it?
4414740	4415540	I forget who it was.
4418180	4419060	What the fuck was it?
4422820	4424180	Are they graduate?
4424180	4425780	I think they graduated and that's my camera.
4425780	4427700	They're on the top of my head because I haven't watched them in a while.
4427700	4429700	But then I was like, oh my God, wait, this bitch is funny.
4433380	4434740	Oh, she's a really good voice actress.
4434740	4437300	And I like wondered how like people sometimes, you know,
4437300	4438820	girls put on voices and some don't.
4438820	4442340	I'm like, wow, um, all that stuff.
4444980	4447780	I don't watch almost all male vTubers because of the same reason
4447780	4449300	I can still watch some of their funny and nice.
4449300	4449460	Yeah.
4449460	4454980	I usually don't watch male vTubers, uh, because I just can't really,
4457140	4460900	I just can't really, um, what's it called?
4460900	4468740	Relate to them because I like, some of them have like really bro streams.
4469540	4471700	Um, so I'm just like, this is for them.
4471700	4473140	This is for the, this is for the bros.
4473140	4474180	You're like, this isn't for me.
4474820	4481620	Um, and then some of them are also very BFE, which makes me cringe out of my fucking mind.
4482260	4486180	But like, I've watched like one or two clips, but it just isn't for me.
4486180	4487380	But everybody has their preferences.
4487380	4489140	You're allowed, you're allowed preferences.
4491060	4493140	Um, skill issue.
4493140	4494340	If you don't like that.
4497620	4498180	That's funny.
4499140	4502260	There's this difference between a vTuber with a small frame and lolly little for me.
4502260	4502500	Yeah.
4502500	4503380	There's also that.
4504420	4504980	I agree.
4504980	4511540	Cause like, I look at like, uh, Amy Asami and she's not, she's like small, but she's not lolly.
4511540	4516020	You know, like, I was like looking at pretty lady.
4516020	4517700	I know I prefer to look at pretty ladies.
4517700	4520740	And also, I'll be honest with you, another reason I don't watch male vTubers
4520980	4527140	is because, um, they are so limited in their outfits and they're rigging.
4527860	4534420	Like I'm sorry, but I've seen so much better rigging for female vTubers.
4534420	4539540	And because like just the movement of female vTubers, I don't know what it is.
4539540	4544100	It's just, it's just different and men are like the male vTubers usually very stiff.
4544900	4549220	Um, I've seen a couple with really good rigs because like I'm someone who I look at when I
4549220	4554580	watch a streamer, I appreciate the art, uh, behind it all, like in terms of the actual art
4554580	4555220	and the rigging.
4555940	4563380	Um, and a lot of male vTubers just fucking don't have good fucking rigging or they also
4563380	4565220	have like really boring ass toggles.
4566740	4568980	So I'm sorry.
4570340	4573140	Male vTubers don't, don't, don't cover my neck please.
4574500	4575300	Bald physics.
4575300	4578580	So when, yeah, when we get the best designs, I'm like,
4578580	4579620	I'm tired.
4579620	4583940	I'm seeing the same fucking, fucking Ikemen, Ikemen.
4583940	4585060	I can't pronounce it.
4585060	4585860	You can make fun of me.
4585860	4586260	It's fine.
4587060	4587940	Style.
4587940	4590740	Like you all dress the same in different fonts.
4592180	4592660	I'm done.
4593460	4593860	Thank you.
4594980	4596980	Enjoy the, enjoy those emotes, girly pop.
4598020	4603220	Um, can't really watch you vTubers.
4603220	4604820	vTubers is not my cup of tea.
4605460	4606580	Brother, what are you doing here?
4606580	4607540	What are you, what are you doing?
4607540	4608980	This, this agency.
4609700	4610740	Brother, I think you're lost.
4612580	4616820	Um, it's just like in video games, female characters always look better.
4616820	4617620	Yeah, literally.
4617620	4619940	No, that's why so many dudes just play female characters.
4619940	4622340	My dad will play female characters when he plays games.
4622340	4624580	And I remember, I remember like, I'll just like be ragging on them for it.
4624580	4627140	I'm like, dad, why are you this chick with big titties?
4627140	4628820	He's like, because she got big titties.
4628820	4631620	And I'm like, look at her and she's dressed way better.
4631620	4634020	Look at all the dudes skins versus the girl skins.
4634020	4636340	And I'm like, you know what, you're fucking right, dad.
4638340	4642500	Um, Facebook shop blocks go hard.
4644500	4646580	We were hot men in games.
4651940	4653300	It'd be that simple.
4653300	4654500	It'd be that simple.
4655860	4656740	If I can create a kid.
4656740	4658980	Yeah, women have like so much funner's things.
4658980	4661620	Like I remember when I played Baldur's Gate for the first time,
4661620	4663380	I was like, okay, I'll make a girl and a boy.
4664260	4665060	Baldur's Gate 3.
4665060	4665780	So I made a girl.
4666900	4672820	She was just really cute, like, elven, for like dark, for like,
4672820	4674340	I can't fucking remember what I made her.
4674340	4678740	But she was like tan skin, bright red hair, freckles,
4678740	4683620	really cool, like tattoos, all this other shit, like makeup, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4683620	4685620	And then I went to the do the dude and I'm like,
4685620	4688420	okay, I can do beard one, two, three, four, five.
4689140	4690180	I can change the eye color.
4690180	4691140	I can give him a scar.
4691460	4694820	Women pretty.
4696580	4699860	Dress up is, I love dressing up like in like games,
4699860	4702980	like I'll usually take like, I take forever.
4702980	4704660	The majority of me playing Elden Ring,
4704660	4707620	probably like 50 of those hours is me just like trying to look pretty.
4709780	4711620	Men get toothpick or burly.
4711620	4713060	Literally, literally though.
4714820	4717220	I'm picking guys too, but the options be limited.
4717940	4720100	Whenever it comes to RPG stuff, I always make a male, female,
4720180	4722340	self-insert, but I often play the female character more often,
4722340	4723060	even though I'm a guy.
4723060	4724580	Yeah, it's just more appealing to look at.
4726260	4730260	And like, I'll like growing up, I usually played a lot of male characters,
4730820	4735140	just because I didn't like being pointed out,
4735140	4738100	being female and just kind of like griefed in, in games and stuff.
4738820	4742980	And I'll be honest with you, I probably made the same character over and over and over again,
4742980	4745060	just some emo looking dude.
4745060	4748420	Some emo like looking twink was my character throughout the years.
4748420	4754420	I'm just like black hair, eyes, some gothy looking outfit in your golden.
4755140	4755940	And that's what I did.
4756500	4759300	And then I did it because I didn't want to play a female and be all like,
4759300	4760660	and be the center of attention.
4764100	4765380	Oh gee, can you date me?
4765380	4769460	Literally though, literally, I would just get like, oh, I just, I couldn't.
4770100	4774180	And that's why I like, I didn't, I didn't, I wouldn't talk in like, game lobbies.
4774900	4775780	The same reason too.
4776340	4777700	We need she be to play Stila Blade.
4777700	4780900	You just want me to drool in like, the entire time.
4781460	4784100	Ah, so Shibani is, she'd be his ideal man.
4786260	4786900	Are you a girl?
4793540	4795380	Or just like people be like, hey, let's be friends.
4795380	4796500	And then they try to like, just like,
4797780	4798820	E-sexing you up.
4801380	4804260	Oh, we'll have some straights this mail.
4804580	4808100	Um, just be so cool.
4809140	4815380	I remember people used to say, uh, call like, say grill, like G-R-I-L-L.
4815380	4820500	Cause I think, or like, man, like I would play Wolf Quest.
4821140	4823060	And which I'm going to be playing next week as well.
4823060	4824660	We're playing fucking Wolf Quest.
4824660	4826820	And we're going to go find a mate and have puppies.
4827380	4833540	And, um, and, uh, people would say grail, grill.
4833540	4836980	As in like cook, as like mail, as in like M-A-I-L.
4836980	4839300	Cause people kept asking about it.
4839300	4842740	And they would just do, to fucking so much E-sex and Wolf Quest.
4845540	4847380	I used to say I was a boy in every game straight out.
4847380	4849780	Cause I was like, yes, literally, four gets it.
4851380	4852340	A hundred percent.
4852980	4854020	I would literally just do that.
4855380	4859060	I remember I went by like a mail version of my IRL name.
4860100	4863300	And I remember I had the girlies still fucking falling for me though.
4864500	4868660	You know, nobody can, I need a, I need a lip bite toggle.
4868660	4870180	And we have to ask mom for that.
4871460	4873380	Mom, can I, can I get a lip bite toggle?
4873380	4882340	So I could be like, wait, can I, no, I can't do anything similar.
4884740	4885460	Shaboris.
4885460	4887060	Yeah, I was Shaboris all the time.
4888020	4889620	Insane aura.
4891700	4893700	And uh, yeah, it was just, it was just easier.
4894500	4895860	And then I would have to tell the girlies.
4895860	4897860	They'll be like, why don't you get a voice call with me?
4898500	4901940	And I'm like, types out, sorry babe.
4902820	4904580	Uh, I'm too shy.
4907460	4910260	Yeah, I remember I was like, I'm guy on the line as a dude for a bit.
4910260	4911060	And I was a girl.
4913460	4914500	How many female moms?
4915300	4917300	Mike doesn't work.
4917300	4918660	Sorry, my mic's broken.
4918660	4919300	Baby case.
4921460	4928420	Oh, if I was a dude or if I was a lesbian, I would be a fucking menace to society.
4929140	4930500	I would be a womanizer.
4933060	4935860	I just feel like I would be the shittiest fucking dude.
4935860	4939860	I would just be the opposite because like me, I'm a very sweet, very caring,
4939860	4942740	I'm a very affectionate, lovable person if I really like you.
4944820	4947540	I am very protective over people that I care about,
4947540	4950100	but I just feel like if I was a dude, I'd just be a piece of shit.
4952580	4953860	I would definitely be an F boy.
4954500	4955860	I think I would be a fuck boy.
4960020	4961620	Hey, you wanna be my discord kid?
4964100	4968660	I would love to see my hands as a necklace around your neck, baby girl.
4968660	4974740	Some pictures of your asshole.
4978580	4979780	Can you mail for me, kitten?
4990900	4992420	Dad actually, no, I'm above that.
4995940	4998100	Tom boy, she be when I'm already a tomboy.
4999620	5002660	I think, I think I am in my tomboy.
5003780	5004180	I don't know.
5005300	5009060	I was like very, again, growing up, I was always taller than all the boys
5009060	5011220	and I've always been very, very fucking strong.
5011220	5018740	I remember one time I was playing basketball with these kids and I don't know why I did this,
5018740	5025540	but I picked one of the guys up off the ground and I threw him back down
5025540	5030980	to get the basketball from him and he started crying and I called him a little bitch.
5032660	5034340	And I'm like, why are you crying?
5034340	5039620	And then he's just like, and I was like, we were like 14.
5039620	5040980	It's not like we were like seven.
5040980	5042260	It's like we were like 14.
5046100	5047540	And I like chucked him.
5047540	5052100	And then I also used to play a lot of football at my after school program
5052100	5054020	because we had a lot of sports there.
5054820	5058020	So it was very like my after school program was very athletic.
5058580	5060660	And so we would play football.
5060660	5064740	I would be fucking mowing down the boys in my grade.
5065700	5066500	American football.
5066500	5066740	Yes.
5067460	5068500	And soccer too.
5068500	5070420	And you know, European football.
5072180	5073860	I would be mowing down motherfuckers.
5074900	5076260	I wasn't a bully.
5076260	5076980	I wasn't a bully.
5076980	5078580	I was just bigger and stronger than people.
5078580	5079860	I can't help it.
5079860	5081300	I would fucking everybody.
5081300	5084100	I was like five, six at age 14.
5084100	5084980	What do you want me to do?
5085620	5086180	I'm sorry.
5086180	5088740	All you bros were fucking five feet tall.
5089860	5090740	What do you expect me to do?
5090740	5092820	I'm going to fucking roundhouse kick you to the face.
5097380	5098100	I'm five, six.
5098100	5098980	I'm taller than you.
5100180	5101220	Bro, I'm five, eight.
5102740	5103620	I'm so sorry.
5106340	5107140	Have you stiff arm?
5107140	5107860	I don't know what that means.
5109140	5110900	Like, I don't know what that means actually.
5112180	5116020	They're five feet and 14 at their time.
5117300	5118500	Flexing female puberty.
5118500	5119620	It's true though.
5119620	5120180	It's true.
5121140	5123700	I remember I was like, how old was I?
5123700	5126900	Because you start, you go through puberty
5126900	5127540	when you get your period.
5127540	5128260	I think I was like 12.
5130900	5131220	One.
5132980	5136100	I had fucking C cups at 14.
5139220	5140500	My parents were concerned.
5141700	5144340	Again, I was also five, six at that age.
5144340	5145940	My family was very concerned.
5146740	5149460	So they took me to the doctor and they were like, oh,
5150180	5153620	she needs to stop drinking milk because I was drinking,
5153620	5156980	like the milk I was drinking, I think it still happens to kids,
5156980	5160500	but they have so many hormones in them that I grew up way too fast.
5160500	5164020	They, if I didn't stop drinking milk, they said the hormones in the milk,
5164020	5167220	I would have been, they said I would have been like six feet tall.
5167460	5171540	I was, I was growing too fast.
5171540	5175140	I was, I was in so much pain because I was growing too fast.
5178180	5179700	Five, 11 at 14, six foot two.
5179700	5181220	See, okay, you're like, that's fine.
5183540	5187860	They said, oh, she's going to be either from five, nine to six, four
5188580	5190900	when they're like estimating my height.
5191540	5195460	My mom is five, five and my dad is six, four.
5196180	5197700	And then my mom was just like, oh God.
5198660	5200980	And then my dad's like, I can teach her to ball
5200980	5203220	because my dad was a basketball coach.
5203220	5204020	I can't do basketball.
5204020	5205380	I fucking suck at basketball.
5206260	5212100	I preferred, I preferred like football or soccer for sports.
5213460	5215620	And everybody would always ask like, oh, you play ball.
5215620	5216580	Oh, you must play ball.
5216580	5218100	You so to, oh, you're only 14.
5218100	5218820	You must play ball.
5218820	5221540	I'm like, no, no, brother.
5221540	5225140	I don't, I fucking suck.
5225140	5226180	I can run fast.
5228020	5230980	And like my dad was, I swear my dad was sort of supportive
5230980	5233460	because I couldn't play basketball because again,
5233460	5238100	my dad was like, what was it?
5238100	5240180	Like a heist, I have to look it up.
5241620	5244740	Like an amateur league basketball coach.
5244740	5245940	My dad was good at it too.
5246900	5248100	Have you juked anyone out in football?
5248100	5248980	A hundred percent.
5249540	5250500	A hundred percent.
5250500	5253620	I had the tightest fucking turns, bro.
5254260	5254740	Tight.
5256100	5257380	Whippin' that shit, bro.
5260820	5262740	How rich I school interaction.
5262740	5265940	But it's funny because like, I was like, I was,
5265940	5267620	I had like a sleeper built.
5268420	5269620	I had a sleeper built.
5270900	5271780	I was tall.
5271780	5272980	I was skinny as fuck.
5273700	5275220	You're like, oh, she can't be strong.
5275220	5275460	No.
5277060	5278420	I'm chucking you across the room.
5278420	5280020	I'm chucking you across the field.
5280020	5281460	I'm sending you home crying to your mom
5282100	5284180	because apparently I'm playing too rough with the kids
5284180	5285700	because I don't know my own strength.
5285700	5286100	Listen.
5291220	5293460	And like, also I was super fucking shy.
5294740	5296820	But then like, I got this like animalistic
5297780	5300980	for feralness about me when I would play sports.
5303540	5306500	And then, and same thing, same thing with fucking jujitsu.
5306500	5310980	Dudes would be like, because it was a co-ed school.
5311780	5312580	I couldn't roll.
5312580	5315620	I didn't roll with a lot of the girls because uh,
5317620	5319620	well, some of the girls didn't want to roll with me
5319620	5322740	because I was just, I was just stronger.
5324100	5327620	Um, but like not, not that you can't submit somebody,
5327620	5329620	but when you're learning, it's not fair.
5330820	5333620	Cause then at that point, you don't have the skill
5333620	5335140	to beat someone stronger than you.
5335140	5336580	So I would have to roll with the guys
5336580	5337700	or people have a higher belt.
5337860	5339460	Just because I would just hold you there.
5339460	5342980	Like I, I was strong enough, especially my fucking legs.
5342980	5346180	I would just hold you there and just let you squirm,
5346980	5348580	squeeze you between my legs.
5348580	5351940	You try to get out, but I'm going to comeore you
5351940	5352980	or a more economy you.
5352980	5354740	I'm, I'm sorry.
5356900	5358660	You know, you're in my guard.
5358660	5360420	I could still do that if you're in my guard.
5363460	5364580	For free?
5364580	5365460	For free?
5366340	5366980	For free?
5368740	5370660	I sound like I'm really fucking humble bragging though.
5372820	5374500	I'm scared the pegging might be real.
5374500	5377780	Um, maybe when we get fans late, I'll be loud.
5378340	5380180	Cause people keep asking me, when are you gonna get a strap?
5382180	5384100	And we just, do you want me to sit there
5384100	5386180	like a fucking, how some dudes do it?
5386180	5388180	How some dudes send, take pics and just be like,
5388180	5389620	you like what you see.
5389620	5391220	Do you like this angle?
5391220	5392180	Do you like this?
5392180	5394340	And I'm like, you want me to take pictures like that?
5394340	5395060	What do you want me to do?
5396420	5397620	Please test these moves on us.
5397620	5398340	I beg of you.
5403300	5403860	I'm sorry.
5405220	5408260	Not that I don't like tributes, but
5412900	5414500	or I should call them something else.
5414500	5416740	Stroni said I needed to say code words for things.
5416740	5417860	I should work on that.
5417860	5421060	Um, not saying I don't like treats.
5421940	5422820	The fuck is on my,
5422820	5425780	the fuck is on my titty?
5430420	5431780	I'm a fucking zit.
5431780	5432100	Okay.
5432100	5432660	Don't touch it.
5433220	5438820	Um, not that, uh, I don't like like,
5438820	5441140	like little treats that I get sent, but
5444180	5448100	I'm like, I compare like the girlies on Twitter
5448100	5449620	that be posting their pictures
5449620	5452660	and then the dudes on Twitter
5452660	5453620	that be posting their pictures.
5453620	5454100	I'm sorry.
5454100	5454740	Girls win.
5455700	5457540	They're a lot more creative with their poses.
5460340	5461220	Dudes just stand.
5461220	5462420	I wish I could demonstrate.
5469460	5470900	I also want to, um, I saw that
5470900	5473060	Cottontail VA to the thing where, um,
5473700	5476740	she like crushed a milk jug between your thighs.
5476740	5478980	I definitely want to do that for like a milestone.
5479860	5482580	Maybe when we hit 10 K, it's funny.
5482580	5485300	Like, I just want to say like,
5486900	5489620	literally my goal, one of the goals I put in my debut
5489620	5493300	was hit 10 K subscribers and we're already at six K
5493300	5494500	and I'm just like, what the fuck?
5496020	5498580	I'm like, I expected to be at like 800 by now.
5501540	5502820	She's a watermelon too.
5502820	5503460	Oh shit.
5503460	5504180	Okay.
5504180	5505300	Man, I need to work out again.
5505300	5509700	I've been, I've been, since I've been laid up at home,
5510820	5511540	being depressed.
5513140	5514500	I haven't, I haven't worked out.
5515300	5517220	I need to, I need to do stretches.
5517220	5517940	I need to get ready.
5519860	5521860	I don't look at pics of dude on Twitter.
5522420	5526100	Uh, neither do I, but the Twitter algorithm just fucking happens
5526100	5527380	and shit just shows up.
5527380	5527620	So
5532500	5534340	he's hit 10 K right now.
5534340	5540100	But yeah, I just, I'm just very thankful for the amount of growth
5540100	5541460	that we've had as a company.
5542340	5544820	It just boggles my mind to be honest.
5544820	5548020	I didn't, not that I didn't believe that we could do it.
5548020	5553140	I just didn't think just because of like negativity and coverage
5553140	5553940	and all that stuff.
5553940	5557780	I just didn't think people would enjoy us as much as they do
5557780	5558740	and I'm so happy.
5561380	5563540	How would you describe your peak build?
5563540	5565140	Like Elden Ring?
5565140	5569380	No, like on a partner or on myself?
5570260	5573060	Because for me, I don't really care what you look like.
5574020	5578100	I'm like, I would just want you to be healthy and be really funny.
5580100	5589060	And then for myself, I would like B cup titties.
5589460	5593620	And I would like to shrink my tummy a bit.
5593620	5594180	That is it.
5596100	5598420	Although if I could, I would look like lean beef patty,
5598980	5600420	but my body type just won't allow that.
5602500	5607220	Because like genetically, because like guys are like, oh, flat stomachs.
5607220	5612020	Oh, like I'm like, I'm, I'm skinny, average size.
5612020	5616580	But because of my genetics and being a woman, uh, people are like,
5617140	5622740	you're fat because I have a little protective pouch of fat around my uterus.
5622740	5630340	If I were to have a child, um, even my mom, who at my age was like 99 pounds,
5630340	5633380	if not less than little, no, she was definitely like a hundred pounds
5633380	5637220	and like five, five, she was sure as fuck and skinny as a fucking rail.
5637220	5641220	She also didn't have a flat stomach because just genetically, she just had a little bump.
5642420	5643220	Child makes it better.
5643220	5644900	That's my, I agree with you.
5645620	5646260	I agree.
5646260	5647140	Squish is good.
5647860	5650340	A little bit more hold on to, you know what I'm saying?
5650340	5652500	Not that I don't enjoy like a skinnier build though.
5653540	5656100	Like I, I honestly, I love the human form so much.
5656100	5657860	Becoming so many shapes and sizes.
5657860	5658740	It's gorgeous.
5658740	5659300	I love it.
5661620	5663940	Men and women appreciation in this house.
5663940	5664420	Okay.
5664420	5664980	You're cute.
5664980	5665540	You're gorgeous.
5665540	5666020	You're beautiful.
5667300	5669540	Let me kiss you.
5669540	5671300	I was going to say something else, but I can't say that.
5672260	5674740	It doesn't even look bad based on your photos.
5674740	5675220	Looks pretty.
5676980	5681620	I can't, I know that you're like trying to compliment me, but that sounds weird.
5684580	5686420	Yours don't even look that bad.
5697300	5699780	I don't care how people think about my body type either way.
5699780	5702580	One, because I'm a Vtuber, you're barely going to see it.
5702580	5704660	That was just for the monetization milestone.
5704660	5706580	I'm not cosplaying myself constantly.
5706580	5708900	I'm sorry if you thought that you're going to see me
5710180	5712900	blasting my, my kuchi-hu-ha on fans.
5712900	5714100	Lee, that's not going to happen.
5715540	5717140	No, it's only to use straight homeboy.
5719140	5721300	I'm, you're going to, you're going to get the model.
5721300	5721940	Oh hi, Rena.
5725140	5726580	I mean, it's all right.
5726580	5728500	Like it could be better.
5730660	5732260	Like, I'm sorry.
5732260	5734740	You're not going to see any real life content from me.
5734740	5736500	I don't know about the other girls, but not from me.
5737700	5738980	I'm here to make ASMR.
5738980	5740020	I'm here to voice act.
5740820	5746260	I'm here to be, you know, your girly pop or something.
5746260	5747460	Don't only get to your head.
5747460	5748980	I'm here to be your mistress.
5748980	5750180	You don't make demands of madam.
5751060	5752500	You get little treats now and then.
5754660	5755780	I think anyone's complaining.
5755780	5756340	Yeah.
5756340	5758420	Because some people are like, oh, they're going to be like,
5759140	5760180	the Emma G girls.
5760180	5762900	No, we're, no, at least I'm not fucking doing that.
5763460	5766020	It's hot though, but I'm sorry.
5766020	5768340	And I'm not fucking my gen mates in an off collab.
5770340	5773060	How does this weird business practice?
5773700	5774740	I'm not a porn star.
5776500	5777700	But what girls, there are other,
5777700	5782580	there are Japanese AVTuber agencies that do that sort of content.
5782580	5783860	And I don't knock them for it.
5783860	5786100	I think it's fucking amazing that you get essentially
5786100	5787140	as a porn star VTuber.
5787140	5788020	Like that's fucking sick.
5789380	5793380	But yeah, ruined.
5793380	5794740	I'm going to have, guys,
5794740	5796820	should I have a watermelon blueberry
5796820	5798660	or the mystery color airhead?
5798660	5800020	I also need to get a drink.
5800020	5800740	Quite thirsty.
5801940	5804260	Have you finished the main story for inscription yet?
5804260	5806100	Bro, I didn't even start playing the game yet.
5806740	5807540	We're just talking.
5808420	5810660	I've been in inscription like three times.
5813220	5815300	I just haven't done them on stream mystery.
5815940	5816260	Mystery.
5816260	5817300	Okay, we sing mystery.
5818420	5821220	I'll do mystery, then I'll do watermelon
5821220	5822420	because people are saying watermelon.
5828660	5830580	Johnny's asking how long I'm streaming.
5832740	5833620	Probably too late.
5834420	5835380	Why does she message me?
5835380	5836340	Hold on, okay, discord.
5845060	5847540	Oh my God, a giant fucking.
5847620	5849060	What is that?
5849060	5850660	What is that fucking bug?
5850660	5851300	I need to take a picture.
5851300	5851700	Holy shit.
5851700	5852260	What is this?
5853860	5855060	Mind you, I know my bugs.
5855060	5856260	I've never seen this before in my life.
5866420	5867300	What are you?
5867300	5867780	Hello?
5873780	5875620	Okay, it looks like it has the body of a wasp.
5876420	5877780	It was the head of an ant.
5877780	5878980	It's very thin and narrow.
5879620	5881620	I thought it was like a locus or something,
5881620	5883060	but it's not a cricket.
5883060	5884020	The legs are too small.
5884020	5884580	What the fuck?
5886340	5887060	I need to piss.
5894580	5896740	I just choked on this fucking thing.
5905780	5906340	I'm sorry.
5917860	5919300	Okay, I'll respond to the letter.
5920740	5923860	Um, the girl leaves for my collab tomorrow,
5923860	5925300	like, hey, thumbnail.
5925300	5927540	So I'll post something more later.
5929140	5929700	Hi, Sheeby.
5929700	5930900	Mom, I'd like to redirect here.
5930900	5931780	You think you'd be...
5931780	5933540	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5933540	5934500	100%.
5934500	5936020	I'm gonna be up for a couple hours.
5936900	5937860	I gotta piss.
5938900	5940420	Sorry, I'm gonna keep saying that until I go.
5944260	5944580	Hmm.
5945940	5946820	The watermelon's good.
5952820	5954180	It might be a persic, wa.
5954180	5955780	I don't know, it's so huge.
5955780	5956260	It's probably...
5960340	5961620	I'm trying to think of a comparison.
5964260	5965220	Using my pill bottle.
5975060	5978820	It's like, I have a 15 pro phone.
5979700	5980740	It's like half the size...
5980740	5983780	It's like, lengthwise, it's half the size of my phone.
5987300	5989940	But it's super...
5989940	5991140	I've never seen this butt before.
5991140	5992180	It's staring at me.
5993780	5995060	It's literally looking at me.
5995060	5996100	I know it's looking at me.
5996740	5998100	What the fuck are you, bro?
5998100	5999140	I need to identify you.
6005700	6006660	I can't see his waist.
6007780	6008660	What are you doing, bitch?
6008660	6009700	Stop staring at me.
6010500	6011940	Staring at me because I'm not wearing pants.
6014740	6016900	Remember, Plee comes from the club door.
6018740	6019540	Let him inside?
6019540	6020100	Okay, yeah.
6021060	6027620	It has six legs, two long antennae, long narrow body, reddish,
6029220	6031380	reddish-orange, ants moving like head,
6031380	6035700	but doesn't have the jaws of an ant.
6037700	6038180	It's like that.
6038180	6039220	The head shape of the eyes.
6040180	6042660	It looks like it's divided in three sections.
6042660	6046340	You have the head, the middle section, and the body.
6046340	6049620	But it's very little distinction between the main body
6050180	6051700	and the latter part of the body.
6051700	6053700	It literally just turned its head to look at me.
6053700	6054900	It's literally looking at me.
6054900	6056740	Why do you have so much self-awareness, bro?
6057380	6057780	Stop.
6063060	6065540	By the way, should we do a play on the weekends?
6065540	6065940	Quick ball.
6067380	6069380	I'm doing the UNO club.
6069380	6071220	I might do a gorilla debating.
6071220	6073860	I do realize I need to probably take breaks, though,
6073860	6074660	like have a dig off.
6075380	6080740	Do you need me to cover her cleavage?
6080740	6081140	Oh, yes.
6081700	6082980	Wait, did mommy read?
6085140	6087700	Or is she just asking for like 20 minutes or not?
6088580	6089140	But yeah.
6093220	6094740	I need to do the corals, please.
6096580	6104020	Orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange.
6104020	6104900	Say what I really want.
6104900	6108900	I'm sorry.
6116900	6117380	Boats.
6119060	6119380	Back.
6120660	6122900	Like a wasp.
6134740	6145060	This literally looks like none of them.
6145060	6146580	It looks like a wasp, but it isn't.
6155300	6156100	This again, I'm sorry.
6156100	6157220	I'm a very curious person.
6157220	6158660	This is going to bother me if I don't figure out
6158660	6159700	what the fuck this bug is.
6160420	6161220	I like bugs.
6162100	6163700	This one's giving me weird vibes.
6164020	6165620	He just shat on my window.
6165620	6166420	Maybe he's a shit.
6168900	6169620	Maybe in room.
6171540	6172500	Don't want to tell me who he is.
6172500	6173620	Oh, he just flew away.
6173620	6174020	Fuck.
6174580	6176180	No, I need to study you.
6176180	6178020	Maybe we're new form of insects.
6180820	6182020	What the hell?
6182020	6182420	Okay.
6186660	6187300	Elden ring.
6189060	6190020	Oh, that's right.
6190020	6190660	It released today.
6191300	6193060	I have to mute Elden Ring then on my
6194340	6196900	excuse me, on my stream.
6196900	6199060	I mean, on my Twitter.
6199060	6199940	Don't want any spoilers.
6200980	6202260	Let me take a photo and ask AI.
6202260	6203060	I took a photo.
6206740	6207940	I was going to show it to you guys,
6207940	6210020	but it would expose where I actually know.
6210020	6222660	So, I zoom in, hit top, crop that, and crop, crop, crop it, crop these.
6223300	6224100	Fucking load.
6226260	6226980	69.
6231220	6231540	Nice.
6234020	6235220	I'll post it later.
6235220	6235860	Wait, can I?
6238260	6239140	Look up bug.
6240100	6242740	Up here.
6248740	6249460	That one just like that.
6249460	6250820	Again this one.
6254180	6254820	Born-tales.
6255140	6265380	Yes.
6267220	6268420	A little bit lighter in this whole here.
6268420	6272420	lighter in the color. It's in body shape.
6272420	6280420	I like knowing things.
6298420	6324420	If you don't f**king like that I talk, then go home.
6324420	6330420	You don't have to watch. You can click off to show off your computer and walk away bro.
6330420	6344420	I feel like yapping. I feel like I haven't yapped. I don't know why it feels like I haven't streamed when I streamed recently.
6344420	6352420	I'm eating my last airhead.
6352420	6368420	They're mini airheads.
6368420	6376420	I'm yapping some voices in my head.
6376420	6380420	Yapping my heart's potential.
6380420	6386420	I've been craving airheads lately so I got some.
6386420	6396420	Usually I'm a gummy worm kind of gal, but they didn't have any of them.
6396420	6404420	I don't know what you're talking about.
6404420	6418420	I'm going on vacation. I'm going to leave you with this sh**.
6418420	6422420	Thank you for becoming a member brother.
6422420	6430420	I remember watching a video of somebody freeze drying those giant snake ones.
6430420	6434420	I got some beef jerky. I also have some bueno.
6434420	6438420	Oh wait, I guess I ate the bueno and I didn't remember. So that's a lie.
6438420	6444420	I just have beef jerky next to me.
6444420	6448420	You don't have a Twitter account?
6448420	6452420	We give you so many f**king freebies on there.
6452420	6456420	Because that's like us actually doing stuff.
6456420	6460420	Whereas in the ASMR, well I don't know. Some of us might be actually doing stuff.
6460420	6464420	But mostly the ASMR is just us recording the script.
6464420	6472420	That's pure unfiltered real amateur audio on Twitter.
6472420	6476420	It's not as she be streaming until she's an hour plus and so is the start of the game.
6476420	6480420	Stop it! Stop!
6480420	6486420	Stop complaining! Stop pointing it out!
6486420	6490420	How do you learn how to growl?
6490420	6494420	Whatever you do, don't eat the famous gamer gummy control.
6494420	6498420	What is that? Almost said two hours. Now I'm going to yap for two hours.
6498420	6502420	Well, I'm going to pee first.

7284540	7289860	It's like she definitely has one. I'm also cracking the fuck up. Wait. No, I can't say that I
7291300	7293500	Don't want to spoil for anybody
7294780	7301060	There's a character who talks when they're not supposed to and that character cracks me up
7301860	7303860	Because I'm wondering who they are
7304700	7306700	I
7312740	7318020	Leave attachment humanity. Yeah, so something like she's like she's bored and wants to do something

9339660	9346540	I think it's a scaredy cat so I have I just want to make sure you just let me get some water
9350140	9352140	That was intense
9352300	9358300	That was that was crazy what the fuck oh man
9360940	9366460	So it's something in your vicinity on fire now because oh no no no just because lightning strikes doesn't mean something's gonna be on fire
9368940	9370940	It just it just flashed
9370940	9372940	I
9379020	9381020	The best
9389260	9394700	Last time I streamed inscription it went perfectly fine, so I don't know why the fuck this is doing this
9395660	9397660	Stepping on litter
9397660	9399660	My favorite thing to do
9401900	9406380	She me must now I'm wondering if I should actually like
9407420	9409420	Wow those clouds are
9409820	9411820	moving so fast
9412060	9416940	Um, it's supposed to like thunder. I think tonight. I thought actually I thought it was supposed to be tomorrow
9417500	9422860	I'm wondering if it's safe for me to stream at all like streaming during a storm because I don't want to like if there's a power surge or some
9422860	9423900	shit
9423900	9425900	A guy in my village got struck by
9426780	9428780	your village
9428940	9434700	Anyways got struck by lightning while stood outside his house because he was holding a kitchen knife. You're the window. That's terrifying
9435980	9437980	No
9449420	9451420	Wait, what if I do this?
9456540	9458380	Oh
9458380	9460380	Okay
9465420	9467580	I might cut the vod
9469180	9471180	No, I'm kidding
9476540	9478540	I'm only gonna play the first phase
9479820	9482460	The first I'm only playing the first act. I'm not playing the whole game
9488380	9490380	I
9504540	9506540	Another challenger
9509660	9514300	Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm overriding. I'm overriding the mandem voice. We're gonna do the lolly voice
9519260	9522380	Another challenger. It's been ages
9525020	9527660	Perhaps you have forgotten how this game is played
9528940	9530940	Allow me to remind you
9535260	9538380	Freaky uh car game play the squirrel card
9541660	9543660	Now play your stote
9544620	9546620	Oh
9547180	9549180	I didn't catch that
9549980	9558060	Wolves require two sacrifices. You don't have enough bring the bell to end your turn in commence combat
9562300	9569020	Your stote stands on the post the number on the bottom left is attack power one
9573660	9577180	Your stote don't mean one damage. I added it to the scale
9577740	9580140	It's getting really fucking dark outside
9580780	9584620	If you win you win if you tip my side all the way down
9588540	9590540	Like this
9591420	9593420	My turn
9594300	9596300	Yes, we just started playing
9597260	9600380	Okay, a little pookie bear is a Greek
9600620	9602620	Coach
9602940	9604940	Stoats annoying as fuck
9605420	9607920	Your stote stands in the way of my coyote
9609580	9612060	My coyote dealt two damage to your stote
9613100	9615260	That means your stote's health is now too less
9616140	9619260	If a creature's health reaches zero it dies
9621020	9623020	It's your turn again
9623580	9626860	You may draw from your deck or you may draw a squirrel
9627580	9629580	Oh
9629820	9631820	How dull
9633100	9635100	Well
9637260	9639260	Wolves demand two sacrifices
9641980	9645980	I thought I turned off crowd control
9649820	9651820	I guess I didn't
9654140	9656140	How did that even happen?
9656380	9660220	I closed the fuck I literally closed hold on
9664940	9669500	Oh, it literally says are you sure I didn't click yes
9671580	9673660	No, we'll keep it open. We'll keep it open
9675420	9677420	What is how oh my god
9679100	9683980	Fear not the beat is to sacrifice but not removed from your deck
9684940	9691100	Don't break the tutorial guys. It's suffering was real, but you'll see it again
9697100	9699100	Uh
9702460	9706940	That was a good game four damage dealt four weights on the scale
9709580	9711580	You've won this match
9712300	9714300	They won't all be so easy
9717660	9719660	Let me recall your story
9721660	9723660	Oh, yes
9725260	9730060	You were lost deep in the forest a single path revealed itself
9736300	9739660	I was making dinner. Why did she turn it off? Uh, I didn't turn it off
9740140	9746300	I'll repost actually, you know, I don't know if some of you guys still have crowd control open, but I'll repost the link
9750780	9755420	You guys break the tutorial then you break the tutorial I guess there's nothing I could fucking do about it
9758620	9760620	Enjoy you fucking hooligans
9761580	9763580	Oh
9775740	9781020	Give me the fucking cat give you the cat another creature joins your caravan
9785260	9788380	Some of the creatures of the forest seemed willing to follow you
9791020	9796860	You came across an abandoned sack a ball sack if you will
9798540	9803740	You found a squirrel in a bottle break in case of emergency and have a second
9805580	9809260	Another useful implement I'll allow you to tip the scales
9811420	9814380	Three is as much as you can carry all that lightning
9814940	9816940	You
9819820	9821820	Guys if I die will you remember me?
9834540	9836540	Can you hear the thunder
9836940	9841500	Thunder he the thunder whoa
9842460	9844460	It's so funny because only like one
9845180	9847980	Like the storm the cloud is passing in front of my house
9848700	9850700	my apartment and only
9853820	9855820	Only one
9856300	9861740	It's like half I could see the rain, but it's not on my half. It's like a wall
9862700	9867420	Of water is and I just saw lightning clear as fuck that was cool
9868540	9872380	I've seen have you ever I've seen green in red lightning before
9876140	9878140	That was interesting I love thunder
9880620	9885180	Your narration always has to be doing double tape and it's actually happening. That's a thing. Yeah
9887740	9890380	You're ambushed while crossing some rough terrain
9891180	9895180	By a boulder, but it's not a boulder. It's a rock
9898060	9904380	I get it. Maybe you'll help me take your turn play along for now
9906380	9908380	You may now see my moves ahead of time
9909820	9912460	All right, I will sacrifice your care
9914060	9916060	Or let me just put this show down
9917580	9919580	Here we go
9920540	9922540	All right, I can't really fucking do anything else

9948940	9958140	Did you guys give give power to my boulder? I should get turn the game volume down. Okay
9964700	9971500	That boulder just crushed that little dog that's sad the airborne bat flies over creatures to attack directly
9972060	9974060	No
9975100	9979100	My bat flew right over your stote. It is really fucking dark outside
9979500	9984540	Even darker than how I am in the darkness right now with my spinny little fucking eyes
9987020	9992940	I don't think I'm gonna squirrel show mine if I fuck you with your fucking mantis
9995260	9997260	I say what you did

10049900	10051500	She'd be based
10051500	10053500	Whoa, she'd be based
10053900	10058780	The young wolf cub it grows into a wolf after a single turn. Okay. I don't really need to narrate for that

10846460	10847580	Oh

10862380	10864380	Wouldn't have any way to protect myself
10865180	10868940	Priests shrunk them from starvation. They huddled around the campfire
10869820	10872380	They looked upon the group of creatures and beckoned
10874620	10878220	Come warm winning your creatures by the fire once said
10879820	10884380	Warming by the fire that will enhance its power said another
10885100	10891260	You know just one of the survivors who I've been drool from their mouth. Where was it something else?
10892780	10894780	Like come

10951020	10953020	My mother gnashed its teeth
10953900	10955900	tugging on my skirt
10956540	10958540	Without a word I pulled it away
10959420	10961420	and left

10964940	10969500	Listen to your beautiful. Uhu story. It's like I'm focused just to join
10979820	10984300	The trees seem to close in around you as a chill mist ascended
10986380	10991100	In the distance you could hear the clinking of metal and stone
10992380	10994380	As I change you up
10994460	10996460	and bound you
10996860	10998860	Stuffing my panties in your mouth
11000060	11002060	Gagging you

11081980	11086380	Did I neglect to mention overkill damage?
11089100	11092460	That's when you're tied up so tightly
11094140	11096140	Bound back
11097820	11101420	Brisk burning from the friction of the metal
11104380	11107660	You start to lie. You can't escape
11108540	11112540	I don't waste any damage
11115740	11117740	You create in your neck
11118860	11125260	And I press my little tiny heel to your throat
11127660	11129660	Try to breathe now
11137660	11139660	I

11285980	11290460	Which is what you're experiencing right now as I'm stepping on your throat
11300860	11304220	The cat's supposed to return from my hand so I don't know what happened with that

11443740	11448300	The rink smell of rot and mold permeated the human air
11449820	11454380	Every step forward was answered by some nearby slippers
11456780	11458780	You tread cautiously into

11853200	11856880	However, in my game such feats are rewarded
11858480	11860480	I like pain
11861200	11866000	To be precise a tooth to keep for each extra damage dealt

11989120	11993440	Delicious smore there is room for a creature on the fire
11996160	11998160	The warmth will enhance its powers

12344960	12349680	A hulking man sat by a brackish pond with his feet submerged in the dark water

12883520	12890720	Yeah, my leshy voice is too powerful. If I had a model that matched the leshy voice, it would be over for everybody
12891600	12895920	And um, you want BGM? Yeah, that's a good idea. Um
12901040	12903040	And it would be the true Cunny Corpo
12907040	12909040	I don't know if all of us were just
12913680	12917520	It's still lightning and thundering outside. It's quite nice
12926640	12930480	She just wanted you to just add extreme have inscription in the background
12932000	12936080	Yeah, I I didn't rage quit. It was the game's just not
12937040	12940720	Capturing and I don't know why I don't want to capture my display
12941680	12943680	So, you know
12943680	12947200	Model swap for April Fool's will be too powerful. What are you talking about?
12948080	12949840	um
12949840	12953120	Oh, you think we should swap models for April Fool's that'd be actually be funny
12954080	12955600	um
12955600	12959040	I think cats are running around. Um
12961120	12963120	Trying to think of who I would swap with
12966240	12968960	If I if me and Azura
12969200	12970320	What
12970320	12974320	We're to swap with the smaller body type girls in our gen
12974880	12979600	Who do you think would play who I feel like Azura would be icy and I would be in uh, emmy
12983120	12985920	Swap of scrawny you think I would swap with icy
12990400	12992880	Actually, you know what I think I would like to see
12993120	12999120	Mercy swap with emmy. I think that would be so funny
13001680	13007120	Um, and then icy swapping with me would be hilarious
13008960	13010960	And then
13011120	13013120	Emmy being a
13017360	13019920	And then straw knee could um
13020800	13022800	Take uh
13024400	13026160	Take mercies
13026160	13030000	Yeah, I think everybody if everyone if we all just like swap models. I think anyone
13031440	13035280	The dolly doll me lolly fits in me. She's she's a switch
13037680	13039360	Um
13039360	13045040	I think I think it would just be funny if anybody got swapped with anyone right now. What are you doing?
13046000	13050720	Hi, are you trying to hide from boomy? Please don't step on my fucking keyboard
13052480	13054480	You can oh my god
13055360	13057360	Lady, what are you doing?
13058480	13062720	Okay, all right. Oh, you're stepping on my fucking nipple. Thanks
13065840	13069680	They're all funny as it is. I know I'm saying it would be like funnier as like a joke
13070400	13071520	not like
13071520	13073520	for a long term thing
13073840	13081200	Scottish yandere I would actually that's a good point straw knee playing a yandere character would be very interesting
13088640	13091120	But whoever takes straw knee needs to do the accent
13092800	13099280	I think I'm the only one who could do the accent. I'm sorry. You can't see my mouth move because my cat is in front of me
13100880	13102880	All right, there we go. She moved she swapped shoulders
13103520	13109920	Um, reina, can you please sit down? Oh, she's rubbing against the microphone. Um, ma'am
13111360	13113200	Ma'am
13113200	13116960	Ma'am, please. This is the wendy ma'am. Don't headbutt the mic ma'am
13120000	13122640	Reina so snuggly as per usual
13123680	13124640	Um
13124640	13131120	The cat actually engages with you. Yeah, reina is my fucking I call her my soul cat because she is my she's my baby
13131200	13133200	I've had her since I was little
13134480	13136000	Wow
13136000	13140320	I mean reina is 14. She's an old lady and I love her
13141920	13143920	She is my my big mama
13145520	13150480	And um, it'll be funnier for someone to do her accent badly. That's a good point. That would be funnier
13151040	13152880	uh
13152880	13157840	I like I think I would only be the one be able to do the bad accent or like an okay accent
13157840	13162320	I don't know if the other girls can even like attempt a scottish accent or do any accents
13163120	13166800	Um, I think maybe emmy could because she has a good voice range
13168560	13173920	Uh, yeah, my cat's interactive me. Uh, I think the only one who's not super snuggly is boomy
13174560	13176800	We're just but he was like so snuggly as a kitten
13177440	13181520	And then uh, he's in his like teenage phase where he doesn't eat his mom aka me
13181680	13185120	So he only he's only really snuggly in the mornings and at night
13185360	13189600	I don't understand why and when I get out of the shower. He just like wants to be picked up
13190080	13194000	I don't I think he thinks because I like he thinks I'm dying in the shower and he's like mother
13195120	13197120	Please hold me
13197600	13201760	This little climb up on my shoulder. He's so cute. He's just he's a he's a menace
13201760	13206640	But he's also pussy. It makes no sense. Like he's the biggest dick, but he's scared of everything
13210160	13214400	Uh, yeah, I have three cats and pray for your furniture. They don't scratch my furniture. They're good
13215120	13219200	I give them lots of toys to play with um and cat scratchers
13220000	13221120	um
13221120	13223120	And yeah, a lot of scratchers
13223840	13225840	And I I clipped their claws. So they're fine
13226400	13229520	I I I trimmed their claws. Actually, I need to trim their claws again
13232640	13235040	Because I I trimmed them like a week ago and
13236560	13239120	Um, put me almost fucking clawed my leg this morning
13241680	13245520	You doing the Zeraz model it'll be funny since you have to be actually nice for once
13250560	13253840	You know, I will say people think I don't do like any k-fabe
13254800	13256480	Um, but I do
13256480	13260800	I'm very I'm usually a very very nice person. I'm not I don't bully my chat
13261680	13263120	Um
13263120	13265520	If you knew me as Rina, I was usually the one bullied
13267600	13268880	Um
13268880	13273680	But I realize I do enjoy bullying my chat and bullying you guys and being mean
13274640	13276640	Hey
13278320	13280320	Um
13281120	13283120	It's bully right. Yeah, I am kind
13283760	13286320	Listen to my last audio. I'm the most kind person
13287200	13289760	Letting you even come near me, you know
13291760	13293760	Yeah, I like I like it
13295040	13296240	Being
13296240	13298240	Emmy bullies more
13299200	13301200	Okay
13301600	13303600	What is that supposed to mean?
13308320	13310320	I I have noticed that people like
13312720	13320480	Compare the girls to each other for some reason in terms of like what their kinks are because like we all
13321600	13323600	um
13324400	13329760	Like yeah, we all have like our tags that we we we do that like influence our
13330560	13332560	Our audios
13332640	13336880	But like doesn't mean we can't dip into other tags like me right now
13337520	13339840	Pretending to be you know, cute and funny
13340720	13344080	And then like amy being yandere because that's what she used to do
13344880	13346880	or straw knee being like
13346960	13348960	subbie or whatever the fuck
13349440	13351440	um, but yeah
13352400	13357200	It's just we're gonna have we're just we're just gonna have fun and do whatever, you know do whatever
13357920	13359920	Don't don't pigeonhole us in a box
13361120	13365600	Uh in the hole pigeonhole, whatever the fuck that means. I don't know. I'm tired
13366640	13368640	Variety is good for the soul indeed
13370560	13373440	Straw knee is still so you know, yeah, that's actually true that she is
13374400	13376160	but like
13376160	13378720	I have to be honest. I'm kind of frustrated
13380480	13382480	because um
13383840	13385520	I like
13385520	13387120	I feel like
13387440	13389440	A lot of the girls like some like
13390320	13392800	some of the girls get to be themselves and
13393920	13398160	Their fan bases are cool with that like straw knees because I my dream is like to make
13399040	13400480	to cultivate
13400480	13403760	A group like straw knees and like really you know dedicated
13404400	13409680	Reflings and I love like that their relationship and they're like cool with how she is no matter what
13410960	13412960	but like
13413280	13418560	Then like when I try to branch out and do something else or one of the other girls do everybody's just like
13421040	13426640	And I'm like come on man does let me have fun and I'm gonna do it anyways. You can't tell me what the fuck to do
13430720	13436160	I think it adds a lot more depth to each of you almost like a real person because we are real people. What do you mean almost?
13437360	13439360	We are real people
13443040	13445040	Oh
13445280	13447280	I'm new here. I don't really know
13449120	13451120	You know, like that's how we are
13453360	13455680	What do you mean? I don't like I like I like how my harem is
13456640	13458080	well
13458080	13462720	I think you guys are very similar to reeflings. I know some of you are reeflings. So like
13463760	13465760	Yeah
13467280	13469280	YouTubers or robots confirmed
13470480	13472480	I think they meant the characters you play
13472960	13474160	Uh
13474160	13476160	And I said this earlier
13476240	13478240	We're not playing characters
13478480	13480240	straw knee hired us
13480240	13481680	to be
13481680	13482880	us
13482880	13487840	And I think viewers took too much stock into the lore and the characters, which is not
13488960	13493760	It's a thing in v2 being but it's not a huge part of it. It's just almost like a guideline
13494400	13496000	for direction
13496000	13498320	She hired us for our voices and to be ourselves
13499280	13501600	Feelers AI generated. Yes
13504720	13506720	But like you don't have to give me reassurance
13507680	13509680	I appreciate it
13509760	13514880	Um, I don't want this to seem like a hug boxy thing. Like I say something you guys are like, oh, but you're amazing
13514880	13516560	Oh, but you're this
13516560	13521040	Uh, I'm just telling you like I'm just telling you how I feel. That's it. But I still appreciate nonetheless
13521840	13523680	um
13523680	13525680	Yeah, reeflings are nice fellas. They're cool guys
13526000	13531760	Exactly kayfabe is nice, but not if it diminishes the overall experience. Exactly. Ow. I'm just like
13532240	13534240	hoping myself in the face
13536400	13538400	It's okay to be you she be
13538800	13541280	The lore was the catch but you guys keep us. Exactly
13542240	13544240	Exactly
13544400	13550720	It's a habit vtuber fans won't you but usually they don't like and all the small vtuber communities. I've been in which is a lot
13552080	13553680	usually people just
13553680	13559840	Complain about kayfabe and like why do we even have this nobody cares about lore get rid of the lore
13560320	13563760	Nobody cares about this animated lore video people worked on uh
13564400	13570960	And then like I just noticed for our company. It's not like people just really want us to stick to our lore and I'm like
13572320	13574320	We don't have to
13576800	13581840	You like me for me and if you don't like me for me, you know, you're entitled to that opinion
13582320	13587280	You entitled that to to that opinion, uh, baby cakes. You're good. I respect you
13589280	13591280	You know
13593680	13596960	Lore's like the costume you wear at a party yourself. That's a good analogy
13600960	13602560	Yeah, like
13602560	13608480	Astrony was telling us the other day like she's like all I wanted you guys to do was to like say a funny
13609120	13614640	Funny line pertaining to your kayfabe every now and then you guys don't have to like actually play someone and I'm like
13617120	13622960	Okay, and then that's when I was like, okay, I'm not gonna like lean into the kayfabe of like
13625120	13628160	Being the super huge
13629760	13631440	jealous
13631440	13635280	Demanding madam because I'm like I'm pretty okay. I'm okay. I'm fine
13636000	13640160	Like I'm still growing and learning. I'm still like playing parts of the kayfabe
13640160	13643200	But I'm just gonna do what I want because I'm just having fun
13643280	13647520	And I I came here to be a content creator and make cool asmr content
13648080	13651040	Um naughty and otherwise and yeah, I didn't and I know
13652080	13654720	I'm tired now. Actually. I'm just got really easy
13655920	13658560	Excuse me. Congrats on 6k. Thank you
13660880	13662880	Um
13663840	13668640	But anyways, I don't want to like perpetuate that conversation. I think I got it
13669600	13672880	I think you guys get it. What I'm trying to say. Um

14789040	14794400	I don't know if you remember the other portion of that meme as uh with norman osborne as a different color
14794400	14796400	Um
14801280	14803200	Uh
14803200	14805200	Sheeby speaks that gabagoo
14805520	14807520	100% french here from like two villages
14808240	14811280	Shout out to the colonizer then sheeby. Thanks mom. Whoo
14814640	14820880	My dad it's okay. My dad's my dad's country where the was the first country to become independent from slavery. Let's go. Whoo
14821920	14823920	um
14824480	14825760	but
14825760	14828640	No, like i'm a very it's it's so funny because on the internet
14828880	14830880	I feel like i've been so corrupted
14831040	14832640	Because i'm very
14832640	14838960	Like and I don't care if you fucking hate me for saying this. Um, I'm very lgbtq friendly. I'm very progressive
14839680	14841680	I'm very much a liberal friend
14844080	14847440	Uh, and I just I don't know why I'm like this online
14849360	14852640	I'm just an absolute fucking prick online, but you know
14853440	14855440	I like I like having a little bit flavor
14857120	14860880	It's like everybody nobody say like I'm not and I'm like I'm generally like
14862080	14864080	I don't really give a fuck about
14864960	14866800	uh
14866800	14868800	Like if somebody says
14869040	14871040	something
14871040	14874320	Offensive or ignorant to me. I will put them in their place for their ignorance
14874880	14879200	But I know I know the context of what's a joke and what's not a joke exactly jokes
14879600	14881600	And I I enjoy dark humor. Yes
14882160	14884160	I don't take personal offense
14884480	14891120	Like sometimes people do just like say things in poor taste like when I was when I was younger. Um
14892320	14895680	So my hair is curly you can see my beautiful curly hair
14896240	14900000	I lost tracking because it's dark. Hold on. Let me turn on the light. Um
14903360	14906320	Okay, turn on the light I have beautiful curly hair
14907280	14909280	Um, so I usually uh
14910720	14913440	With my type of curls, I'll put it up in like a
14914720	14919120	Like a like I'll put in a silk bonnet so that my curls stay nice when I sleep
14920400	14923520	And um, did I imagine I could love my she be more? Um
14924320	14926320	And so my friend who's white
14926960	14928960	Was just like making fun of me
14929040	14931920	And I'm just sitting there with my with my bonnet on
14932480	14935680	Um letting my hair dry after showering at her house because we're sleeping over
14936320	14938320	She's like making fun of me and
14938800	14940960	I'm like what why why you making fun of my bonnet?
14940960	14945520	She's like because you look like you should belong on my family's plantation picking my cotton
14945520	14947520	And I just kind of just stayed at her and I'm like
14949280	14951280	Like I'm like I could make
14952480	14954480	A way funnier joke than that
14954960	14956560	That was just bad
14956560	14958480	I'm like that was just dumb
14958480	14964880	Like that's when your white friend gets too fucking comfortable with you and just thinks they could say anything and she apologized afterwards
14965600	14967600	And I'm just like
14967840	14971360	Brother it's to me. It's only funny when it's self deprecating humor
14973200	14974800	Like um
14974800	14976800	No shot someone is that oh
14977120	14979120	Are you kidding me bro?
14980160	14982160	Oh, please
14982880	14985840	Oh, please there's uh when you're um
14987280	14989280	When you're a mixed kid, uh
14989520	14992400	Again, you're too white for the black kids. You're too black for the white kids
14992480	14993600	And so
14993600	14999280	When you're too black for the white kids, they'll make they'll think it's okay to make jokes like that
14999280	15003600	And I just I don't really give a shit because it's one. I just just don't give a reaction
15003600	15009360	And I don't care. Um, and then when it's black kids making fun of you for being like too white
15009760	15011920	Um, they'll do the same thing and so
15012880	15014880	They'll just say like, uh
15014880	15018800	What did that fucking say? I think they like I remember these black kids said something about my mom
15019760	15021760	Being like a snow bunny
15023360	15025360	And I just looked at them like
15026400	15029760	I cool anyways moving on
15033120	15034480	Um
15034480	15036080	And then like it's funny
15036080	15041600	It's only funny to me when like you make fun of yourself or you make fun of your own race
15043040	15045360	And that's why like I'll watch comedians who do that
15046480	15047520	um
15047520	15051040	Then it's funny to me, but like when it's someone who's just like, haha
15051760	15054640	Your gamer word and I'm just like, okay
15055680	15060320	Was that was supposed to be like come on. You could have said that in a better way like, you know
15061840	15064880	Your racism from all sides and no, it's not racism. It's just ignorance
15065680	15066880	like there's
15066880	15073520	I haven't experienced like real racism in like a very long time. I'll be honest with you. Um
15074480	15078960	It's usually people just like trolling and like just wanting to get a rise out of me
15078960	15083680	Which I don't really think they're necessarily racist. They're just like just kind of be a stupid, you know
15084160	15085120	um
15085120	15089200	Yeah, the last time I had someone like be legit racist was when the story I told before
15089600	15093520	Or someone called me the gamer word when I wouldn't give them their
15094320	15098880	Their pickup order because it was or it was canceled for some reason. Um
15099760	15103840	And then before that I had this European woman
15104960	15106160	um
15106160	15110880	Definitely talked to me like, you know how sometimes like older
15111920	15113120	folks
15113120	15115120	speak to like
15115280	15118640	Darker skinned folks a certain way. They'll be like, hey boy get over here
15120000	15122560	So she spoke to me like that. I was like, I don't
15123520	15129040	Okay, she called me she called me girl. She's like girl and she had like a very thick accent
15129760	15131760	um condescending
15132080	15134880	Kind of like talk slow like I didn't know how to speak English
15135760	15138560	And I'm like, I'm from fucking america. I was born here
15139680	15146000	I was literally fucking born here. You don't have to talk to me like that, dude. I can understand. I can't speak any other language, dude
15147120	15149120	um
15149280	15153360	Girl come here. Grab me mine. Give me your finest ways
15156000	15162480	Um, but again, I don't take it personally because people are just gonna be fucking ignorant and you know, they'll just die off someday
15162480	15164000	So I don't really give a shit
15164000	15164800	um
15164800	15169840	It's just I just think of it in like in hindsight and I just like laugh like when I was super young I was like
15170720	15177360	Really sensitive like super fucking sensitive and then I started playing csgo and I grew out of that real quick
15179120	15181120	um
15181120	15186720	My once got asked if I had a green card and trigger me to kick him out of the store. That's fucked. That's fucked
15187520	15190400	Pulling over butter. Yeah, I'm like I'm like token
15192240	15197440	Just kidding though. Uh, yeah the boomers will die off. So, you know, they'll die. We'll be fine
15198000	15201600	Although I'm getting up an age being 56. It's it's kind of scary
15201600	15210960	Sorry, drink some water. How you doing right now? Your eye is watering
15212080	15214080	I don't have a knack at near me or a wipe your little eye
15222160	15224160	Oh my god
15225280	15227280	We're already way better than like 30 years ago. Yeah
15228240	15232560	I'm gonna hit 60s in that ropes break off. Yeah
15233840	15236400	Means like the finest wine we're getting cougars
15237920	15244480	Yeah, I'm 56 you guys if you guys don't know I'm 56. I am the oldest vtuber in the vtubing community
15246080	15248080	Uh for real
15248080	15252800	56, although I think mom key d follows close behind because she's 40. So, you know
15253200	15258320	I am 56. I'm just in really good shape. Uh, I work on my figure
15264560	15266720	Some grand tubers who are the other grand tubers?
15268320	15270320	You know black don't crack
15270800	15273920	And also the black of the berry the sweet of the juice just look at Azura
15276640	15278640	I can't wait for my fucking brown toggle bro
15279360	15281600	Saying this is a white vtuber is hilarious
15282080	15287280	Because no, it's actually really funny because if my shit that I say gets clipped out of context and like put somewhere
15287600	15289600	It'll be so funny because then
15290160	15295760	I could bait the community so fucking hard and be like and just say like the most out of pocket shit
15297200	15303360	And then somebody who put me on blasts and be like, I can't believe people in this community are talking like this
15303680	15307840	Like look at this agency vtuber. He's using these words and then I'm like
15312160	15318640	Um, imagine the clout pass mode activate you you've activated my race card
15318640	15320640	Oh
15330960	15333520	God I am fucking funny as hell
15338160	15339760	Uh
15339760	15342720	Although it's funny. I like I definitely need to go outside
15343280	15348240	Because I'm about to revoke my own card with how light skin I am right now. I'm so pale
15348960	15350960	It's bad. Um
15351600	15355600	If I was thinking after the storms pass, I think it's gonna be storming for a little bit
15356080	15361040	But I'm gonna try to go to the beach. Um, I wanted my days off since I work from home
15362560	15367760	I I somebody I asked twitter. Oh, what should I tell people I do for my job and somebody said a government agent
15367760	15372160	So I think I might stick with that. She's funny in a racist. No, I'm not racist
15373760	15376080	I love all everybody from all walks of life
15376720	15383040	Trust me, uh, one of my best friend's dad is a very fucking racist person
15384400	15386400	Uh
15386480	15393120	It's so I'm not like them at all. So I'm like, that's my when I know if I start talking like him. I know I fucked up
15395040	15400400	I'm only pretend my 1949 moment. Oh, I told my parents about that scene
15401040	15407840	In fucking class of 09 my dad was laughing his ass off and my mom looked mortified. It was so fucking funny. Um
15409680	15413520	But it was it was yeah, I'm not racist. This is something gonna raise
15417200	15422800	No, I'm just I'm just silly. I'm just I'm a goof. I'm just a dark humor girl. I'm just uh, yeah
15423920	15429440	It's not racist. If you hit everyone equally. Yeah, I do. I prefer animals. That sounds weird. Um
15430720	15433600	I prefer, uh, my company of my cats
15434400	15435760	um
15435760	15440880	Doing anything fancy for pride month. No, I remember the last time I like actually did something for pride month
15440960	15446160	I did a really cool, uh, because I used to be a makeup youtuber as well not a makeup youtuber
15446240	15448560	I tried to do makeup
15449200	15454640	Videos on youtube and on instagram. I did a really cute like pan flag
15455200	15458480	Um, eye shadow. It came really nice came really nice
15459280	15460240	um
15460400	15462400	Why are we calling her racist?
15462640	15468400	Because they're silly. Well, me you're in the way. Oh, baby. Come here. Come here. Hi, baby
15472400	15474400	Why do you smell like my lotion?
15476480	15481520	You smell like you got into my fucking lotion. What are you? Are you good?
15483040	15485280	He was like that was high expression on his face
15486240	15493520	Influencer she be must have been a time. Yeah, you know, I wore many hats when I was
15494880	15501280	Going into content creation as a southern backman. I can tell you I'm not racist, but has preceded some of those wild shit
15502080	15503280	um
15503280	15505600	That reminds me of like that fucking vine
15506160	15510960	Of that one girl who's like, I'm not racist, but 80 people
15511920	15516080	But she's fucking loses it why lotion this is a cat
15516960	15523120	People there's lube and lotion lotion like my body lotion. He probably knocked it over. It's probably fucking exploded all right
15523760	15525760	My what should I call it? Um
15527120	15529120	Uh bathroom
15531440	15536560	He's someone's open hookups and then like he says something that I'm not racist. I will like any color hole
15537360	15542320	I think my favorite thing people say is this like I have I'm not racist. I have a black friend
15544320	15546960	I remember I remember somebody
15548080	15549600	like one of
15549600	15551520	My uh friends
15551520	15555440	Like we were in a group. I think we're going to like the movies or something. I don't remember what the fuck we were seeing
15555840	15560720	But one of them said that they're like I have a black friend and they pointed at me and I'm like, no man
15560800	15562800	I don't count. I'm only half a black person
15563760	15566320	Like you need you need to find another one to count as a full
15570480	15572480	I'm like, no
15576000	15578000	Need at least two. Mm-hmm
15578720	15580720	You know two halves must make a hole
15581360	15583360	and like it's funny because like
15584160	15586160	I'm like the most americanized
15588080	15591680	Like I'm not I didn't come from another country like my dad immigrated from Haiti
15592320	15594320	um
15594560	15599760	And but like not when he was older like when he was like five. So my dad is very americanized too
15600720	15602400	and so
15602400	15604560	people like think I'm like very
15605200	15606320	like
15606320	15608320	cultural this or that
15608320	15613200	And like I can't like I've done my research because I you know, I owe it to myself to learn my culture
15613440	15615520	But then like I have my white girl moments
15618000	15620000	For sure for sure
15620960	15625760	I honestly heard the term racism thrown around the media consumes so much it kind of losses. Yeah, and like I like
15629200	15634080	I don't feel like like there's a lot of like races, but it's mostly like people that are fucking hateful
15634880	15638720	And it doesn't it's like different. I don't know. I can't really explain it
15640160	15642160	I got a half black friend
15642800	15648560	Bro, I had a friend who's indian trade have asked me since I'm africa. Can I see the
15651120	15653120	Bro
15653360	15659360	My civilization he has to recognize you forgot how to speak curl. Yeah, my my my dad is my dad speaks curl, but like
15660800	15664240	My grandmother says he has like an american accent when he speaks it
15668400	15670400	Pass is not conferrable
15672960	15674960	I
15675120	15679680	Yeah, I honestly I'm telling you class of 09 educated me with the
15680400	15682160	um
15682160	15686160	Like white nationalism versus white supremacists and I was like, oh
15687920	15692400	Okay, they both suck. What cool good to know the difference
15694560	15698080	Um, but yeah, it was just this is interesting
15699040	15704080	Why am I talking about this shit bro? Sometimes I'm like I
15706000	15708000	I can't wait to get
15708240	15715040	The lia fans because like then I can just be like no holds fucking bar because youtube is so
15716720	15720960	I hate having to keep cut down my vods when I I'm just talking to you guys
15721360	15723920	But I probably have to cut this vod down too
15724640	15727120	Because I just I can't be say so
15727600	15732640	But it's funny. I swear. I was more fucking say so when I was in india on twitch than I am now
15732720	15735760	I don't even and I'm in an agency. What the fuck is wrong with me?
15739600	15741600	Never the cause of it. I have much of an impact
15744720	15748560	Never asked a woman her age never asked a man so I never asked she'd be to not edit a
15749760	15751760	That's good
15752320	15754480	When I get the upload notice I can't go
15756080	15759040	I think I think you guys are a bad influence. It all started
15760160	15763920	When I started going on the interwebs when I was first becoming a vtuber
15765840	15767840	This is some not so savory sites
15770080	15776800	Fuck you guys corrupt me different fans bring up topics maybe. Oh, yeah, actually. Yeah, that's a that's a pretty good point
15777520	15780800	Uh, we have a different fan base. I have a different fan base than I did before
15781680	15783680	Um, that's true
15783680	15785520	like I know I
15785520	15788400	I have seen like one or two of my past
15789200	15795360	Like of rena's fans around but because of the constant I do now a lot of my fans don't watch me
15795440	15800640	Which is totally fine. I accept it. It sucks, you know, it's sad, but you know, I totally get it. Um
15802000	15807040	So I think yeah, it's it is a hundred percent a different fan base different questions different
15807680	15808880	um
15808960	15810960	Yeah
15811760	15815600	Fans reflect the streamer that that makes me sound really bad
15817280	15820480	Maybe we're just too submissive to stop holding from saying controversial stuff
15820880	15826480	But like is it I'm thinking I'm like, do I really say controversial stuff? I don't
15827840	15833520	Think like I feel like I don't know. I feel like I'm just real. I don't really think I'm controversial
15835600	15838480	I find it weird that you're so open about your past life. Um
15839600	15841600	Yeah, see not really. Um
15842960	15846560	We're allowed to be open about our past life. It's fine. Um
15847360	15850640	If I there's nothing against us to talk about it
15851200	15856320	Strani said that when we debuted we can even just we can we can tell our fans that um
15858000	15861840	Uh that we are in v alert all I did was post a meme on my
15862960	15865520	My rena account when I was rena no way. Um
15865520	15866640	Um
15866640	15870560	But I didn't really feel the need to I had a small community
15871440	15873440	I knew they would find me if they wanted to
15874000	15876000	um, so yeah
15876080	15878880	Don't have to pretend you didn't exist until the other yeah
15879600	15881600	Not controversial but edgy
15882240	15884000	I don't really think I'm edgy
15884000	15887680	I don't even think I'm based look at fucking emmy emmy's way more base than I am you kidding me
15888480	15890480	Oh my god, you exist before two weeks ago
15891120	15897600	She entered one time. I think she changed grew up on it molded by the perversion there whole life. Yeah
15898240	15900240	I never been I I literally
15902240	15904240	Yes, like literally six months ago
15906000	15912160	Actually, no not six months. It'll be a year because I was uh, I was a refling. I was an og refling. So that's a lie. Um
15914080	15917840	Been on the grind for 56 years things getting too sensitive
15918800	15922720	So you didn't tell your old community I posted it so like you know the lore
15923520	15925440	um picture
15925440	15927440	of like me
15927440	15930960	Holding queen's hand as she's dying in a hospital bed
15932000	15934960	Somebody who had figured out who I was
15935680	15941200	When we uh did our voice reveals edited rena as queen in the bed
15942160	15949280	Dying of sickness and me as she be holding her hand and it sent me so I just posted that
15950400	15954080	And like like she's like passing the torch, but like it made perfect sense
15954080	15956320	It was like rena's passing the torch to she be
15957040	15958560	You know, I thought it was great
15958560	15964320	So I'm like so I just posted that and everybody responded with lmao and like they thought I was hilarious
15964400	15966640	And I shout out to that person who made that fucking meme
15971200	15975520	I'm dying. Stop be boxing caption. That would have been funny. Um
15976720	15983120	And yeah, like we're we're allowed to talk about this stuff. I'm very thankful for the fan base I had back then
15983840	15985360	um
15985360	15989520	And they knew how much I wanted to be an agency and they believed in me more than than I did
15990320	15993760	And I thank them for that because I would not be here if it weren't for them
15993840	15997680	I would have no audience. I had no one to stream to and but they gave me a chance
15998640	16004480	Um, but yeah, where can I see that meme? Uh, you can't see it because I I nuked
16005120	16006320	uh
16006320	16011280	All of my past life stuff. So like you may notice that I
16012480	16014480	um
16014480	16017200	Went on an indefinite hiatus as rena
16017840	16024240	Uh, I'll be honest with you. She's essentially graduated. I just did a definite hiatus because
16024960	16025920	um
16026000	16029920	Rina means a lot to me as she represents rena who is my cat
16030480	16034880	Um, so I and rena is a seimees cat. So I wanted to
16035520	16043120	I made a character after her because rena is my baby. Um, so that when rena passes on which she is older
16043200	16049360	She's 14. It will happen eventually. I'm mentally prepared for that. Um, that she lives on
16050560	16053360	With rena. I actually might just change rena's name to rena
16054160	16058880	To be honest with you, but I will not be going back to rena. Um
16060240	16064320	I will be she be I am she be she be is me. I am her
16065440	16067920	We are each other. Um, some people
16068640	16073840	Uh, presumed because I made her an indefinite hiatus that like they thought I was gonna go back
16074320	16079600	And somebody mentioned that um, I had commissioned a lot of stuff like for a whole new fucking
16080320	16085280	Like asset package and debut thing and model and everything for rena
16086640	16088800	But then I was hired to be a lure so I can't use it
16088800	16093360	And so as people saw posts of like my assets being in showcases and they're like, wow
16093760	16098960	She's just planning on going back bro. I commissioned those back in fucking february chill out
16100400	16102400	I'm not gonna be rena

16146560	16148720	Um, that's why I cry like a bitch half the time
16150240	16153840	Because I just get so emotional because I feel so deeply and I love so deeply
16154560	16159200	Um, vtuber's teaching ideas is like a crazy personality disorder. I'll be honest with you like
16160000	16165440	That's what I love about being a vtuber is that you have so many possibilities
16166000	16172880	Um, like I if I wanted to for my 2.0. I could just be like, I'm no longer a rabbit. I'm a slug girl
16173520	16178400	I'm a slime girl. Um, I'm the slime girl. I wanted gen two
16178960	16187280	Uh, like when you have the money to do so the support the right artists the assets like you can be who you want
16187280	16194640	And that's what I love about vtubing. I was so put in a box as a flash streamer. Um, when I was one and as a

16242400	16244720	Like that was really fun and I'm doing that next week too
16245680	16248080	Invest in your oh she so she doesn't have to go anywhere
16249760	16252160	This is why we need a crying harlot emo. Oh
16252880	16255840	Damn, I should have I should have come because I just put in a request
16257520	16259520	For more emotes so
16261040	16264480	Um, although I don't know if you did know me as rina you
16265040	16271200	Know that I one of my famous emotes that was used very often by multiple people was my crying emo
16271520	16274240	So I am I did commission that as she be
16275680	16277680	My what the fuck is going on emo
16279680	16282560	Because that that that that's that's always been a funny meme
16283680	16289520	It's better to invest in oh she rather than crypto. Yeah, that's true. You know what you you know what you're getting you know your returns
16294400	16298400	Said it before she because she put the shrug model in still watch that'd be fucking funny
16299680	16301680	Know if any spicy arts still exist
16301840	16304000	of
16304080	16306080	Cheebie
16307280	16308560	Yeah
16308560	16312240	Yeah, um or rina. I know there is spicy art of rina
16312560	16317040	Um, I even I commissioned spicy art of rina for one of my previous donathan
16317760	16319760	That I did for fias medical bills
16320400	16326640	Um when I was rina and I it's still I again I commissioned that in fucking march and it's not there
16326720	16328720	So I feel really fucking bad about that
16329360	16331360	Uh, I wondering if my
16332080	16334640	The skeb artist goes to me for that which sucks
16335680	16338560	I'm gonna buy nfts. No bad for the environment
16339120	16340400	Um
16340400	16342800	And they're also fucking waste of money. You can't do shit with them
16343680	16345760	I'm just gonna copy paste your fucking nft
16346400	16348400	invest in a she be coin
16348960	16351120	Blind bunny. Yeah, slight money would actually be pretty cool
16351600	16356720	No, because I'm a element now anatomy kind of as you took me back a little. Yeah, some people like as I've I've I've
16357200	16358960	Did that with rina too
16358960	16362480	They're limited to emotes is that a limit only and not your best in the art for it. Um
16363600	16367360	I think there is like a limit for emotes like on youtube
16367920	16371280	I again, I'm not I'm not far super familiar with youtube's
16371920	16373520	YouTube's
16373520	16377200	With youtube and their policy on how many emotes you can have I
16378160	16382240	Like so I have like I already have more than the four that you're using
16383040	16384800	um
16384800	16388080	Like I I have a crying one. I have some other ones
16388880	16391920	Uh, and then I got 10 more that
16392720	16394240	I'm that um
16394240	16396000	I commissioned
16396000	16398160	and so
16398160	16400560	I don't so I'm assuming I can have around like
16401280	16406000	15 maybe 20. I don't know. Yeah, there's no 17. Yeah
16407600	16409600	Um
16409680	16411680	I want to say like 50 ish. Yeah. Oh, okay
16412480	16419280	Well, where are they? I don't know like I commissioned. Well, oh the ones we I we just commissioned our emotes like more emotes
16419760	16424080	Um, the other ones. I don't know why they're all not added there. Again. I don't know how youtube works
16424160	16428640	I don't meant manager set up account. So I don't know. I don't know if I can know
16429360	16430800	um
16430800	16432960	You can put bttv on youtube. Oh, okay
16434400	16440320	Are there any plans for management yourself? I'm making a discord server for you vealer as a whole now that you mentioned emotes and stuff
16441040	16443280	You can't there's a notification server
16443840	16445840	Um, just for our
16445840	16450480	And everybody's safety. We're not gonna have a personal server that we frequent. Um,
16451040	16454000	I know there's like fan servers and stuff and that's cool and all
16454400	16460240	Which also the people who run the fan server if you're watching can you please change it to not look like our official
16460880	16466320	Fucking twitter. I will get notifications if you like my stuff and I think it's our official twitter, but it's not
16466800	16469920	Um, make it make your own fucking logo. Um
16471280	16473520	Yeah, just because like we don't need groomer cords
16473600	16477760	We don't need people getting like feeling like they're being favored or the fuck like Jesus
16478320	16481520	I don't feel like dealing with that shit. It's so much. You don't need that
16481840	16484480	Um, I know you guys want to hang out with us, but you can hang out with me right now
16484960	16486960	I'm talking to you face to face
16487840	16491360	Anime girl to titties to viewer, you know
16492880	16499920	I think it's I think it's better this way for everyone. We don't we don't need that. Um, you know, trust me
16500000	16501840	I would love to be
16501840	16507200	In a discord with everybody, but and I know I would behave. It's just how some people act
16507840	16510720	Uh in a discord when there is a
16511600	16513600	talent in there, um
16514640	16516640	Sometimes they uh
16517200	16519920	Because they're in closer proximity to the the talent they
16520800	16522800	They feel like they're owed something and could like
16523520	16527920	Spam them harass them blah blah blah blah and like I don't feel like fucking dealing with that
16528000	16530160	Management doesn't feel like fucking dealing with that. Um
16531360	16534480	Vibes can really fucking weird. Yeah, like I've seen I've been in
16535040	16536880	discords where those talents are there
16537520	16540080	And it's kind of a fucking shit show. So
16540960	16542960	I think it's better like
16543280	16545280	Yeah
16545440	16547440	Yeah
16547680	16552320	She doesn't want to talk to us. She hates this. No, no, god, like I would talk to you all the time
16552640	16555520	Like I literally fucking quit my job so I could be with you more
16555520	16557520	Like
16558560	16564320	Come on be for real. Um, I'm tempted to I'm thinking about making um
16565360	16569520	I've seen other streamers do this where they add their, uh
16571360	16574240	Actually, maybe that's not the best idea. I'd have to ask management about it
16574240	16580480	But I've seen people add their schedule as a video and they'll like give updates in that pre chat from time to time
16581040	16584880	Um, but yeah, because you know, there's there's a there's a line you can't
16585120	16588880	Like you have to be careful and like have a line you can't cross
16589440	16592560	Just so people don't get hurt. Like I don't want people to be hurt
16593200	16598160	Um, like I know I see you was very upset. Um, because somebody hurt her feelings
16598240	16601760	And I don't want anybody else to feel that way viewer or talent. So
16602720	16606240	It's sometimes we got to do stuff that protects our mental health
16606960	16611280	Um, but yeah, like, you know, you see me pop into like preach out a couple times
16612160	16617520	Um, but yeah, I was thinking about a free chat. I'd have to ask management though. Um, but yeah
16620000	16622000	The other girls are free to
16622000	16627440	Reach out like that. Yeah, does she do it like in the video of that day or does she have like an actual thing?
16629920	16633040	Someone made the girls cry and pop in the trunk
16634160	16636160	No, yes. No someone. Yeah
16636720	16638720	I
16639360	16645440	Keep yeah, well like I'll I'll keep you close like again, like you guys said chart reflect streamer. Um
16646480	16650720	I know my boundaries. I would tell you guys if you ever I ever thought you guys crossed them
16651440	16652720	Um
16652720	16657040	But you guys are very well behaved. I don't feel any sort of way for that
16657600	16660000	Oh, I mean as a schedule free chat. Oh, okay
16662000	16663840	Wait, huh
16663840	16665440	Why didn't
16665440	16667440	Was I supposed to do that?
16668560	16670560	Why am I so fucking dumb?
16673520	16675520	Oh gurra's streaming
16676720	16680960	Her 3d bird I'm oh guys I'm overlapping gurra. I might have to end stream
16682720	16684720	Jesus fuck
16687680	16688720	Wait
16688720	16692240	Why the oh, I'm like, why did Amy just mention me as I'm talking to her?
16692240	16694960	She just tagged me because she she blew up on the tweeters
16697840	16700080	Damn, what the fuck she did blow up on the tweeters
16700960	16704080	Hey, she caught up to me. Yay. Let's fucking go
16705920	16707920	I was hoping the girls would fucking catch up to me in the
16709040	16712480	So awkward having so many people in my fucking old. Um
16713920	16715920	She'll probably pass me soon enough

16719360	16720560	I can't
16720560	16723520	Because then I want to see how she set it up so I can replicate it
16732640	16736320	Just creeping on your account. Amy just creeping on your account
16737520	16740160	Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Amy

16745840	16749840	Where is it? Where is it? I don't see that

16795920	16797920	But yeah, I'll do something like that
16800160	16802960	Who's girl how the fuck do you not know who girl is?

16810320	16814000	Oh, she be do you think you could take her on a fight if you had to be her ass
16815200	16818800	Excuse me. I would not harm that shark. Are you kidding me?
16819600	16824160	I would treat that shark as a princess mostly because I'm scared of hollow fans
16827280	16832160	I'll give you an activity streaming tomorrow in the collab. Is it tomorrow? Yes
16832880	16836880	I am in the collab. It's not on my schedule, but I'm there
16838240	16840240	What if you had to no?
16840800	16846720	I got the majority of the vtuber rabbit hole last year via indy so I learned to follow away after I'm like it I
16847280	16850080	It's very interesting to me where people find like
16850800	16856560	Agencies or indies before they do the big names. It's but I've noticed that happening a lot more often
16857440	16859440	um
16859840	16861840	But yeah
16863040	16865040	I'm valid
16867760	16871040	Hard girl the sush shark kid. She's not sush. She's a shark
16872080	16876880	It's the 20th teams. I don't again. I don't remember where I am half the time
16879680	16884240	Girl is the first vtuber I watched. Um, yeah, the first vtuber I watched was kazuna ai
16885200	16889840	And then I watched co-amigo, but I never really considered her a vtuber. Um
16893040	16895040	Let's see. Who else did I watch?
16895760	16901920	And I watched a little bit of hollow. I would watch polymyth naturally. Um, I watched kiara
16903760	16905760	And then
16905760	16907760	I had to stop myself from falling in love with shiwari
16910560	16914000	Um, listen, I love messy manhara
16914720	16916080	looking types
16916080	16918880	If we had a goth chick like that and gen 2
16919440	16921440	I would die. Um
16923840	16929520	Let's see. Yeah, and then I and then I just watched a lot of agency vtubers like smaller agencies. So like idol
16930720	16932720	um
16933120	16936000	Pixel link and projects like I watch
16937520	16938640	Yeah
16938640	16944640	Watched a little bit of vrevery like rana. She was cool. Just sucks because I really fucking graduated
16944880	16946880	I
16948000	16950000	Miss isn't that mercy?
16950400	16952720	No, she's not goth
16954000	16958640	I don't think mercy doesn't look goth to me. She says I'm thinking. Yeah, no
16960080	16963600	See me a while just chatting started chatting with you there though. Yeah, I feel that
16964640	16967040	Which one is your oh sheet? I don't have to tell you
16968800	16971680	I don't have to tell you any of my oh sheets are for me to know
16972400	16974400	And I hold them close to my heart
16975040	16977040	Or not for anybody else
16977440	16978560	Corony
16978560	16980560	What can I click?
16980800	16987520	Dory, gen 2, mercy would be mad. Oh, I thought you said mercy would be mad if that happened. Uh, no, uh, yeah
16987600	16990960	No, that would be that would oh the power those two would have
16993760	16999440	Literally my name was my name was originally graveyard for them. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you have fucking runatics. Oh
17000080	17001520	That's uh
17001520	17007040	The thorn lines. Yeah, but it's it's nice that you can find those people other places now like they're they're doing okay
17007360	17008480	so
17008480	17010720	He's trying to gatekeep. I am gatekeeping. Oh, she
17012320	17014560	Like why do you guys need to know who my oh she is?
17017120	17019120	They're not like me at all that's for sure
17019760	17022320	They're very talented very talented. Um
17024000	17028080	I would watch we cheaper highlights from time to time and never got into them until you guys debut
17028320	17031280	Yeah, yeah, I like I love watching me two bird debuts
17034480	17036480	Quick
17036960	17042000	But you got like they're not it's not like they're not a popular person like they're very well known
17044160	17046160	Nova's still fun of you ever again
17047680	17050640	Feel bad for the you every girls
17052400	17054400	Hope they bounce back
17054800	17058800	Can I tell you my oh, yeah, you guys can tell me your oh, she's oh wait, are you gonna say fucking me?
17060320	17063120	And I'll honestly be a lair is the first group to pull me off a hollow plant
17064560	17069040	I see some words seems like I missed out on some good time staying there for so long
17069520	17074160	You know, but it's like it's cool to prevent venture out because like again, I feel like
17075280	17077280	It's it's a lot more intimate being
17077920	17083520	In a smaller um agency like chat like you can see you can interact with each other
17084080	17089280	You probably recognize each other's names. Uh, I can talk to you. I recognize a lot of you
17089680	17092080	It's a nice small little chat and we're hanging out
17093600	17100320	She used my kamiyoshi. God damn that just weird like it just doesn't make any sense to me that people like me that much
17100480	17102480	to call me their kamiyoshi and
17104000	17108640	I yeah, I don't even know what to say besides thank you because I just never thought
17109600	17113760	Like being like when I was indian never thought anybody would ever tell me that
17116160	17120400	Make more 200 rather than 2000. Yeah, I like having small chat
17125040	17130880	I only remember you because you keep saying you lost your job and then you went to the other girl's chat and said you lost your job
17132480	17134480	And I was like, why are you telling everybody?
17135440	17142320	And remember this there's a saying move in silence bro make money moves move in silence
17145040	17147920	She don't yeah, and I notice you on other girls chats too. Don't you forget
17150080	17154640	More of a casual vtuber fan and watch the content like and the first thing I enjoy don't really have an oshi
17154720	17157280	Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like I'm the same way
17158000	17161520	Except like there's someone just like I watch the most and that's who I call my oshi
17162480	17167680	He lost a new job each time move in silence like lasagna
17168960	17170960	Like the gene lasagna
17171680	17173680	Like the end of lasagna
17175040	17177360	Yeah, identifying you in maros. Oh
17178640	17180080	100%
17180080	17184160	they'll become a loved and respected figure in the industry. That's very sweet and
17184960	17186960	Honestly, that's the goal. I want
17188160	17190160	I want to be
17191040	17192640	I want to have the same
17192640	17195680	I don't it sounds really fucking pretentious when I say this but like
17196480	17198480	I really want
17198480	17200480	that
17200480	17202480	Pull that like the big
17202960	17204960	some of the big twitch indies do
17205680	17206960	or like
17206960	17210320	Like I just I want to be the person that like everybody
17211440	17216880	Knows is like cool and chill and you could talk to me and hang out and we can always collab and
17217840	17219280	um
17219280	17223840	And just like just have a bunch of fucking friends. Like that's all I want. I just want a bunch of fucking friends
17224720	17226400	um
17226400	17230560	In the industry it would be cool just to like kind of have that sort of
17231040	17235440	Like I don't want to be as famous as iron mouse, but like have a sort of like air about me, you know
17237120	17238880	Like tomah. Yeah
17238880	17244880	Tomah's cool. I love tomah. She sends me tiktoks all the time. I can't keep up with all the tiktok. She sends me
17245840	17247840	I
17248240	17251840	Knew at a place here. I saw a robot taking the debut. Uh, yeah, I need to rewatch
17251920	17256000	I was thinking that because I was cleaning and I was like I found my robotech discs
17256240	17258640	And my dad let me and I'm like oh, I need I should rewatch these
17259120	17261520	Um, I haven't watched robotech in a very long time
17263120	17265360	I already found your cool. So I think you're getting there. Thanks
17266480	17273120	Uh, tomah is a tiger. Oh, no, that's uh, toto. Tomah is um a monkey little monkey. Yeah
17274080	17280080	Oh, yeah, she'd be a knower. Yeah, that's what I want. And yeah, like I've said this before you're watching the hollow justice debut tomorrow
17280480	17282480	Probably I usually wait for them to debut
17283200	17285200	Ayo
17286320	17289360	Oh, thanks. What the fuck dude?
17291120	17293120	You didn't have to do that
17293200	17294880	Thank you
17294880	17299200	Can we get some can we get some chads in the chat for doki? How they am?
17299200	17301200	Oh
17301440	17308400	Very nice. Thank you so much. I appreciate that so much. I hope so. I want to make you guys proud. I want to be
17309680	17313280	I want to be the best for you for you guys and I want to be the best for the community
17314000	17316000	You know, I want to I want to make a difference
17317680	17321280	And I know on the way there I'll make mistakes. I'll learn I'll grow and all that stuff
17321440	17325120	Fia, what are you doing? She's scratching my chair. But yeah, you know, I want to do that
17325920	17327920	um
17328160	17334240	Again, my only fear is that people won't want to spend time with the girls and vealer and myself because of the content we do
17334720	17336720	We're already feeling it. Um
17337520	17339200	for some things
17339200	17340160	like
17340160	17342160	I really want to be friend
17342240	17344240	people and other agencies, but I
17346240	17348240	I know that
17348480	17349760	because of
17349760	17352240	who we are who strani was that
17354000	17357280	You know, we might not be afforded some friendships, but yeah
17357920	17359920	It is what it is
17360160	17362720	uh, it's water under the bridge for all of us, but
17365680	17367680	This sucks
17369280	17372640	You know, I'm that type of person who I want to be friends with everybody
17374000	17376000	Because I have a desire to be liked
17377840	17381760	Yeah, yeah, it's just the nature of business. This is the nature of agencies
17382640	17384640	um, it's the nature of you know
17385120	17390080	Some people seeing us like it was a competition, although I don't really see it that way like they were like, oh
17390800	17392800	My melody better my melody
17393040	17398160	Uh project melody better watch out for realer. No girl. I just want to learn from her. Are you kidding me?
17399440	17402800	This is like I ain't competition to fucking project melody. No
17403920	17408080	I don't do half the shit she does. I like to learn how she does her stuff though
17408160	17412480	That'd be fucking cool and with con tail VA and all the girls from twitch
17412800	17414320	playing
17414320	17416320	um
17416480	17419360	He's a wild take a while to get on the fucking level, you know
17420160	17425920	The only thing that we're doing differently is that we just have naughty ASMR and we say the the quiet shit out loud
17426000	17428080	Most of the girl like yeah, that's yeah
17429040	17431920	And I'm happy because I thought there was some
17432800	17436480	That wouldn't like us, but they they started interacting with us now. So I'm hopeful
17436880	17438880	I
17440640	17443040	Thank you friends. Did you make you'll be loyal? I hope so
17443920	17446880	I don't I'm not again. I said I'm the type of person like if something's wrong
17446960	17453120	Like I'll I'll confront somebody so because I hate drama. I just I just want people to be happy
17454240	17456720	I just want everybody to be okay and be happy and be friends
17458400	17464720	And that's why like I I asked like my gen mates a lot of questions annoyingly like how they're feeling how they're doing
17465520	17468640	um, because I just want to make sure we're all on the same page because
17469760	17472880	uh, I just want to make sure that they're okay and
17474480	17479120	Like everybody's doing all right because I care about them. I care about how they're feeling how their mental health is
17480160	17485920	Um, you had your fill of trauma there. Yeah, exactly. Yeah being a commentator was
17487440	17489440	very stressful it was
17490640	17494240	I can't even explain to you how stressful it was just like the hate
17495680	17497680	um
17497920	17501040	The shit that I went through dealing with people
17502080	17507200	And it's funny because now I get to see them get karma now that are in the con that were in the commentary community
17507280	17509280	And it's it's very nice to see it
17511360	17514080	People who treated me like shit, um
17515120	17518080	Just for being a girl trying to do shit
17519120	17520400	uh
17520400	17525280	Should be doing wellness checks I do though like I'm like I did that at my job too before I left
17525360	17527680	Like I would check in with everybody and be like, hey, how are you doing?
17528400	17532320	Or if somebody seemed down I'm like tell me what's up and they're just like I'm fine. I'm like don't fucking lie to me
17534080	17537520	When you get bigger friends aren't just friends business relationship from what I've heard
17538080	17540080	But like I don't want that
17540480	17542480	if like I don't
17542800	17546000	I don't see collabs as like a business transaction
17546240	17550560	Unless they explicitly say this is a business transaction
17551520	17554720	um, I will probably only collab with people that
17555360	17561280	I like I am acquaintances with or I am on friendly terms or I do consider my friends or my best friends
17562080	17563200	um
17563200	17567440	Because like I want to hang out with you. I don't want anything from you
17568320	17570320	You know like I don't
17571440	17573440	I'm not doing this
17573680	17577520	For like monetary gain or popularity
17578160	17579360	like if
17579360	17582720	If a big ass vtuber was like, hey, you want to hang out
17583600	17586800	I'd mostly be fucking sides because this person wants to hang out with me
17586880	17590880	I don't care about their audience size like and same thing for me
17591040	17599360	Like I don't care if you have only five people watching you if I know you're cool. I watch your streams. I've you know like
17599920	17604560	I'll hang out with you. Like, you know, like I'm not gonna let that stand in the way
17604640	17606720	It isn't a business transaction to me
17606720	17613920	But again, I respect the people who do believe that like I'm not gonna be like oh my god. You're just a bitch. No, that's stupid
17614320	17617360	Everybody's entitled to like how they go about things. Um
17618080	17623360	If I were to to collab with like some girls from other agency and they're like
17623920	17628720	We're doing this because management told us to I'd be like ow, but okay
17630320	17634560	Let's then I'll try to have the best fun that I can. I don't that's not hasn't happened
17634640	17639200	So I don't think that's happened. It has not happened, but like it's just this is the hypothetical. Um
17640800	17642800	It's time to start streaming so
17644640	17646640	Um, am I fine? Um
17648160	17650000	I'm okay
17650000	17654320	Like again, I'm very honest with you guys. So like I've been in a little bit of pain for my fibro
17655040	17657040	I've had a couple headaches
17657040	17658400	um
17658400	17660400	It's been tough
17661520	17664240	Leaving my job. I don't really think it's settled in yet
17665440	17669680	because I've been there for almost six years that job meant so much to me and
17670720	17674240	Saying goodbye to people was hard. I'm surprised I didn't cry. Um
17676080	17678080	It I'm not good with change
17679200	17681440	and what worries me the most is
17682560	17684560	I tend to get really isolated
17685520	17687520	And so I was only going back to work
17687920	17693280	So that I wouldn't isolate myself and self isolate because I tend to do that when I'm I'm feeling down
17694080	17695360	um
17695360	17696560	but
17696560	17700480	I realized I was just feeling more tortured being there like I was
17701280	17703680	Really starting to resent the work I was doing
17705680	17708080	Um, but otherwise I'm fine like
17708800	17715040	Yeah, like I miss hanging out my parents. I need to go see them. I did hang out with them a couple days ago
17715120	17720720	But yeah, I need to hang out with my friends. I was supposed to hang out with Salem, but I didn't feel good. Um
17721760	17723520	I needed to sleep
17723520	17725520	I didn't go over her house
17726720	17730720	And then like so yeah, my goals are really just to leave my house
17731280	17736000	Because I tend I like I have been agoraphobic in the past where I didn't leave my house for six months
17736480	17740800	And that wasn't good for me. It really wasn't it's not good for anybody humans humans are
17743040	17748400	Humans are pack creatures. We need to talk to we're very we need to hang out with other people
17748480	17749920	And that's I like I
17749920	17753040	V-Jubing does give me energy because I can talk to you guys
17753120	17755920	But sometimes it's good to be face-to-face with people, you know
17758000	17760000	Um
17760000	17762000	I
17763600	17767680	Left my old job the first week was just a haze. It's up the best that we're had in previous eight years
17768080	17770480	Uh for me, I've haven't I've been sleeping like fucking shit
17771280	17773280	I've only been sleeping a couple hours
17773520	17774720	Uh
17774720	17777440	I can't stay asleep. I have really fucking weird dreams
17778480	17782480	Um, and I'm a very lucid dreamer so I remember every fucking dream I have. Um
17783760	17787920	Yeah, it's just I'm in a weird state. I'm just I just feel I just feel off
17788880	17793840	You know mercury's and Gatorade. No, I have no idea fucking retreat mercury's and retrograde. Um
17794960	17799120	It's weird dreams. No, not the not the fun dreams. I have had a couple though
17803280	17805440	Sorry, I'm stretching. Um
17807760	17809520	Let me make a day and just go outside
17809520	17815760	Yeah, and like that's why like it took so much energy from me just to fucking go to the grocery store today
17815760	17821840	That's why I know that like I need to be outside more. Um, also it was just really hard carrying everything up
17823920	17826800	I've it I it's hard to carry groceries
17827920	17829920	several flights
17829920	17831600	um
17831600	17839520	And then I had to drag my bed frame upstairs and that shit is probably like fucking 50 pounds and
17840480	17845760	And I swear every time I picked up picked it up. I was getting abs and really buff
17847680	17851200	And then yeah, yeah, and even in terms of like streaming stuff. Um
17853040	17860240	It's it's a new thing to have so many eyes on me. I'm used to having like a concurrent viewership of
17862480	17864480	Like 30 people
17864560	17866560	like max
17866560	17868560	50
17868560	17872240	I remember on my debut when I debuted as Rena with my little chibi model
17872320	17878480	I got rated with 200 people and I will chat myself and now I have a concurrent viewership of that. So it's very
17879200	17882400	It's very weird adjusting to it the amount of attention
17883120	17884480	that I get
17884480	17886480	um
17886560	17890560	I'm used to kind of passing under the radar and kind of being the support
17891200	17893200	in the shadows type
17893840	17898080	Like I I'm always there to like lend a helping hand but to be on the forefront
17898720	17903440	It's very interesting. It's a very new experience to me. I think I'm handling it. Okay
17904080	17908480	The first week was a little bit rocky. Um, you know, I said some stupid shit
17909520	17913200	Uh, oh my god, Rena. What the fuck Rena? Can you go lay in your bed? Please?
17913760	17917440	Okay. Well, never mind. Ow. We just stepped on my tit. Thanks. I love that
17918240	17920240	Thank you for stomping on my nipple
17921760	17925920	Um mirror about me here and I'm happy. Oh, that's nice. Mara is such a sweetheart
17926480	17932560	Me and my plus girls are such sweethearts. We have a collab with them next week spoiler. Um, can't wait
17933440	17935440	uh
17935520	17938400	But yeah, now you're the protagonist it's like
17939840	17941840	Literally though, it's like I'm like, oh
17942160	17947520	Joining the alert would never happen to me because that's like a dream come true and like that would be a fairy tale and
17947920	17952720	A lot of my problems would be solved if this happened and then it happened and doesn't feel real
17953280	17955280	still like it feels
17955280	17957280	Like I'm gonna dream and I'm gonna wake up and
17957920	17960560	Be disappointed that I'm still stuck at my fucking job
17962560	17965760	But then I pinch myself and I have to remember that I'm here
17966640	17969760	As we discover you may plus they're pretty cool. Yeah, they're so sweet
17970240	17972000	They deserve a lot more
17972000	17976240	Viewership than they do like they they do. They're so talented. They're so funny
17976880	17978880	Most is a fucking right
17978960	17981040	Um, should have been me not him
17982000	17986080	I love you. Oh fucking where'd you come from bitch? She's just coming out of nowhere
17987840	17989840	She's just like me you my plus mention
17991760	17994480	Um, I don't know you too and
17995360	18000000	I've been here. Oh, yeah, I we talked like 20 minutes ago. You just lurking. She's lurking
18000640	18005920	Um, yeah, the most uh, the most of sliding in my dm. She's like, hey, you want to be friends and I'm like, yeah, bitch
18006960	18008960	I love that shit. That's my favorite
18009280	18010640	um
18010640	18012160	She's cool as hell
18012160	18014160	Please don't wake up. We'll stop existing
18016240	18018960	Hey, most of her bad mouth. Thank you. Um
18020000	18022880	Yeah, bad mouth thing about how much of a bad bitch you are
18023600	18026640	Uh, we all the girls are sweet. Um
18030240	18035120	Yeah, it's just it's and then also like dealing with hate has been interesting
18035920	18037920	um as a vtuber
18038480	18046960	It is a lot more manageable because as a commentator, I was like hit every day with that shit. So it was pretty desensitized
18048400	18050400	um, and I think
18051040	18053040	I've learned over time
18053920	18055920	to handle hate better
18056080	18057600	um
18057600	18063680	But then sometimes I'm like, I do get baited and I respond to trolls like I'll admit that I can be stupid like that sometimes
18064560	18071520	Um, mostly because I'm trying to be out of the goodness of my heart answer like an on what I think is an honest question when it isn't
18072320	18073360	um
18073360	18074560	or
18074560	18076560	or a
18076560	18078560	Yeah, or um
18078560	18081040	respond to something that I think is genuine, but
18082320	18086240	A genuine critique, but then I'm like, oh wait, no, it's not my back is cheap
18088000	18090000	um
18091040	18093040	Yeah, I just
18094400	18096000	Hmm
18096000	18099680	Like I'm learning not like when I don't like something I don't need to acknowledge it
18101120	18106400	When something bothers me don't want to just block and move on. That's it's really interesting
18113600	18115840	We're stroding your chat. That's pretty good
18116720	18123280	Yeah, don't feed the trolls. Yeah, and it's like because I'm like I'm a little fucking brat and bitch sometimes sometimes I'll bait the trolls
18123280	18125280	I've done that before and I'm like
18125600	18129840	Um, what I did that before is Rina and I'm like, oh fuck should have done that
18131360	18136640	But you live you learn and you live whatever the fuck you make mistakes that you fucking learned from them
18137280	18139120	um
18139120	18141120	and that's what
18141680	18143680	I think like
18144480	18149760	What we do as a company it's like we'll make like a small mistake and then we'll adjust accordingly
18150240	18152240	um
18153120	18155120	And we haven't made a lot of those
18156880	18158480	But
18158480	18161600	I can't wait to see how we'll grow. I think we have a
18162880	18169520	We'll be learning a lot at least as a company because I've never worked in a group as a company before like an agency
18170000	18171120	um
18171120	18178640	And of course I've worked in many groups like and I've managed teams when I was in the training when I was in my job
18179120	18180320	um
18180320	18182320	So it's it's interesting to kind of
18183440	18186640	I really like just being able to support scrawny in her dream
18187440	18187920	um
18187920	18194480	And also be able to make my own content and like just like her giving me the green light on things and projects that I want
18194480	18198400	To do has been really cool. Um, I don't know if any of the girls have anything planned
18198960	18203600	But like I would support them if they did something and they asked me to be a part of it or they just wanted support
18204480	18207840	So it's it's it's nice. It's it is really nice
18209600	18213680	I'm learning to let things go. Yeah, like I don't hold on to things
18214800	18217920	I realize uh, I think that's a skill I have
18219040	18221040	I I don't hold grudges
18221040	18223040	um
18223360	18226800	Yeah, pretty optimistic about people there. Yeah, me too
18227680	18229680	scrawny stream is my dream exactly
18230720	18232720	exactly
18232800	18235520	I really think viewers gonna be big one day. Yeah
18236400	18238400	I can't wait till we like
18239520	18242960	Like I want to be the V show joe for whores. Like I want to be like
18245200	18247200	I want to just be able to like nepo
18247760	18251440	Scout fucking huge lude tubers and be like come be a whore with us
18254000	18256000	Be fucking hilarious
18256800	18262160	Um, but yeah, like I know scrawny has a lot planned for us deals sponsorships
18262160	18266320	She's she literally wants the best for us and I couldn't ask for a better mom
18267280	18269280	A better vtuber mom
18269440	18270640	uh
18270640	18274400	The pop-up and pop cherries. Oh god, but um
18275440	18277040	Yeah, it's just
18277040	18279440	It's really cool. I'm very thankful
18280240	18282240	It's really nice hanging out with you guys
18282880	18285840	Too small be a lure be the whole live of vtuber lude tubers
18286480	18290320	I don't want that though. Like I don't want to be whole live of lude tubers
18292240	18294240	Um
18294320	18296320	Yeah
18296560	18299760	I'm trying to throw cops caught until vk. That'd be cool
18302000	18304640	Be like it was her she was queen in my lure
18306240	18308000	Um
18308000	18311600	I don't want to be that big because I was thinking about it because I was just like, okay
18313040	18315040	Like what if
18315680	18317680	um
18319680	18323840	And don't take this the wrong way this hypothetical that I thought of it was only because
18324320	18326080	the girl the
18326080	18327280	the
18327280	18332320	Debuts popped up that I thought of this and not in a negative way. Just like how would I handle it?
18332560	18334560	I'm like, okay. Let's say
18334560	18336560	in like four years
18337680	18339680	For three years velar
18339760	18341760	um
18342000	18344000	Ended operations
18344000	18345440	I'm like
18345440	18347440	Would I try to get in the hall alive? No
18348880	18350880	One because the content I make
18351360	18353360	two because of all the eyes on me
18354080	18355120	uh
18355120	18356640	three
18356640	18359280	I don't think I'm entertaining enough and like I don't
18360560	18366400	I don't know. I just like being small. I just like I that's why I hope velar lasts forever because I just want it
18368320	18371920	I don't know how to explain it, but I hope you guys like understand what I'm saying. It wasn't it's not
18378720	18380720	I don't care about the money
18381360	18385200	Either that's not a motivation. It's nice. It's an added perk
18386000	18387760	like
18387760	18389280	but
18389280	18390880	I
18390880	18392160	For me
18392160	18397360	Being a streamer was my passion into what makes brings me joy and makes me happy if I and then I was
18398160	18401200	So fucking miserable when I wasn't streaming for the last few years
18401840	18406880	It was so fucking shitty. I realized how much I missed it when I when I was rena
18407200	18407920	um
18407920	18409360	when I became
18409360	18414880	When I did my first stream as rena, I realized how much I missed it and then when I had to be
18415840	18418320	Quiet and be underground for a couple of months
18419040	18422000	Uh while I was transforming into my ultimate form shiwi
18422320	18428640	I was literally dying inside because I missed talking to my community. I missed talking to people. I missed making stuff
18429280	18434720	Because uh, like I had so many plans and I'm like, oh my god. Like I just wanted to get shit done. Um
18435600	18441600	It was a core profile. No, no, no. I was never in an agency before this. Uh, I was indy. I was a twitch indy
18442400	18444400	Very small twitch indy
18444720	18446720	um
18447120	18451120	I do and I already said this stream I caught until VA collab would go hard. Yes, it would
18451120	18453360	I don't know if she would want to talk to me though
18454800	18456800	Again, I'm so small
18456800	18460240	Oh, I'm gonna tell you when you're for five hours. Has it been five hours or shit?
18461200	18464000	I get it. We could be more comfy this way and it gives you flexibility. Yeah
18464640	18468080	The dichotomy between wanting success and wanting a nice small community. Yeah
18468800	18470800	Like I could always get a job
18470800	18472480	like
18472480	18478400	Worst comes to worst. I could get a job if like I wasn't making enough streaming and like that's fine
18478480	18481440	I'm up as long as I get to stream. That's all I care about
18482000	18486480	She loves us. I do. I'll say it. I love you guys. I love streaming
18487600	18488880	Fuck you
18488880	18490160	Bitch
18490160	18492160	Don't let it get to your head
18493360	18497520	Contale would simp for you on god. I highly doubt that I'd be simping for her
18499920	18507440	Overgrowth with the selfish part of me hopes. Oh you guys fucking talk her so fast. Um, it's the most like this intimate vibes are immaculate
18507440	18508240	Yeah
18508240	18511680	And like yeah, that's why like I've seen a lot of people have that same sentiment
18512080	18518160	Like they want us to be successful, but they want you want to get keep us a little and so I totally understand that
18519840	18522320	Um, but then
18523360	18529760	Then you think and I know you guys think this like why would I want to stop somebody else from experiencing what I'm experiencing right now?
18530320	18533360	What if she helps somebody or what if
18534080	18535280	like
18535280	18540480	She brings a smile to somebody having a bad day. That's what I want you to remember when you you think like that
18541120	18542480	um
18542480	18546560	Like what if we bring so much change to the vtuber community then another
18547520	18551120	Agency pops up that does similar content to ours and you find you're
18551920	18559360	The fucking love of your life in comey in comeyoshi and that one or like what if like because so many so many things can happen
18559440	18561280	like you can branch and
18561280	18562800	you know
18562800	18563920	all that
18563920	18565920	Still keeping my ego in check. Don't worry
18566400	18568880	Uh intimate chats of the soul. So yeah
18569680	18575600	I like about vtuber is the chat interaction, which is why I like indie so much. Yeah, I loved I liked I like streaming
18576320	18583840	Because I love doing chat interaction. That's why I'm frustrated with youtube because it's it's hard to do a lot of chat interaction
18583840	18585840	That's my like channel points on twitch
18586560	18587840	um
18587840	18589840	Have a plan make it easy
18590400	18592400	on her to destroy a thing
18592400	18593440	yeah
18593440	18595440	I did like um
18595440	18597440	I want to be part of honey kins
18598000	18603840	Like murder mystery thing that she has going she needs like 15 vtubers for it. So I was like, please please
18604720	18606720	um
18607440	18613520	Yeah, I like I'm afraid to ask people to hang out because I don't want to seem like I'm clout chasing because I just
18614720	18618480	It's just that now that I'm an agency vtuber with a brand
18618960	18622160	People are more likely to say yes because if I was a fucking indie
18622160	18623840	No one would say yes to hanging out with me
18623840	18627760	I don't want to hang out because I want popularity. I just want to hang out because I think your content's cool
18628560	18636320	So I'm like, oh if I slide into a k like so and so's dms. Are they gonna think I'm a clout chasing leechy bitch?
18636400	18638080	I'm like, I hope not
18638080	18640560	I just want to hang out with you because I think you you and your content is cool
18642160	18644160	Felt yeah
18644560	18646400	um
18646400	18648400	I don't yeah, I just don't want
18649280	18654000	I want to make connections, but it's it's it's it that's what holds me back
18654800	18660880	Um, and then when I feel a little bit stupid when like someone doesn't respond and I know they've seen it
18661600	18664640	But I'm like, hey, it's it is what it is. Like I can't
18665680	18671600	Change how they feel if like they're like, oh, I don't like her. She's kind of like and she's fucking
18672960	18678800	Because I know like another thing people are like, um, some people are put off about I've heard somebody say that
18679040	18679840	um
18679920	18682400	My model makes them uncomfortable, which makes me kind of sad
18682800	18687600	But I understand because like if you're not into bdsm and I have a fucking ball gag as a choker and
18688160	18691280	Uh shabari ropes and my boobs are a fucking huge, you know
18691840	18693600	um
18693600	18699600	And some people don't like a very sexualized. Why am I so small because I'm because I'm fucking
18704480	18706480	Because I'm leaning back
18710320	18712960	Here I'll lean I'll lean nice and close to you. I'm so short
18714240	18717920	I'm like trying to do this and lean but also like move myself up
18719520	18723040	So I can like yeah, okay, that's a little bit better. Um
18725360	18727360	Oh, this is scared of the drills
18727760	18733840	Reach out just bring a plant. Yeah here with the um big bobs scare you. Oh, well stay away from big bobs
18734560	18736560	so short
18737040	18741920	Yeah, I think my model is amazing too. Like when I saw it the first time I was like my mouth fucking dropped
18742320	18747520	I wish I was on a video call with strawnee because then she would have been laughing at me. Um,
18748080	18750080	What do you mean that is inside?
18752800	18756880	I'm scared you were personalities. I don't know maybe that's why that's why I'm like
18757360	18760880	I debate so often if I should really reel myself in
18761680	18763680	Because I don't want to put people off
18764400	18766000	Um
18766000	18771200	These people just want to hang out through the ones to be valid. Yeah, that's why I fucking love that you may plus girls so much
18771200	18773200	Because they gave us a chance, you know
18773600	18775200	They're like, yeah
18775200	18781760	Um, and I know like sponsored watch alongs don't uh mean anything when it comes to like lasting relationships in the v2
18781760	18786400	Bing community, but we were turned down by a lot of agencies. Um for that
18786880	18791360	And I can say that strawnee's already fucking talked about it. Um, but you may plus was like yeah
18791840	18794000	And like it was really fucking cool of them to accept
18794720	18797840	Because we're nobody's yeah, we have a little bit of pull because
18798720	18801200	of just like the content we make but
18802400	18805920	We're still a brand risk being not safe for work. That's why
18811760	18818640	Feel silly when there's so many skimpy jiggly models of the gags curious people. Yeah, yeah, you know, I think
18819360	18820400	I
18820400	18822400	Yeah, I I feel like
18822800	18824800	I I think
18824960	18829440	In like a couple months will be a little bit more settled in. We love you girls. We love you too
18830160	18832480	Um before mariah coming in college too
18833200	18839920	Honestly, yeah, like I was chatting in rem's chat. Um, I've been like making funny jokes with uh,
18840720	18842720	nova
18843200	18850560	So like I'm like they're the v4 mariah girls are so fucking cool to me to be honest, uh, their debuts
18851360	18856720	Honestly blew me out of the fucking water like all like all their debuts so far and before mariah
18857360	18859360	Um have blew me out of the water
18859360	18863040	Um, I remember watching serena's the first time when they actually made the company
18863520	18866320	Her singing voice was amazing. I
18866320	18867440	I
18867440	18874320	Was so amazed by it and then just the newer girls their debuts are so creative
18874800	18877760	They're such a creative group. Um, they're such a such a nice
18878640	18879920	bunch of people
18879920	18880880	um
18880880	18886800	And the mythos girls are also you have fucking facade and rated me the other day and I was like, oh shit, okay
18887680	18888960	That's cool
18888960	18890080	and that
18890080	18896160	And that like and I always see like as a raid a raid as like a little olive branch like hey, please like
18896480	18898480	I like you. I want to send my
18899280	18902000	My viewers to you and I always appreciate that
18902640	18905600	Um, I miss abby kiddo. Oh, yeah same she
18907040	18910720	It's a real bummer, but I'm proud of her. Um, because she
18911280	18917920	Got an opportunity, but she was honestly doing things that a lot of people did not do in the community in terms of skits
18918640	18922480	Um, and just her format and I thought that was very unique about her
18923040	18925760	Uh, and then yeah her and biscotti
18926240	18927680	um
18927680	18931200	Very talented people, but you know when life affords you
18932160	18937280	Amazing opportunities. You gotta you gotta get them and it's amazing that brave group allows them to do so
18937760	18939520	so
18939520	18944720	The scientist debut was insanely. You're not to the yes. Like I was like, what the fuck is this? This is crazy
18945280	18949440	Um, yeah, raids raids are nice. The the redirects are cool
18950720	18953680	I'm sorry with costume for the lore moment. Remind me of the moment from the
18955120	18963200	Um, yeah, I was laughing at uh, alias is v2 apology thing. I was dying at that actually that was really funny. Um
18965440	18968640	Came in from that raid. Oh, okay. That's funny. That's cool
18969600	18975840	Sounds like she found a little path into comedy. Yeah, I mean, I I generally I'm wondering what she got into like it
18976640	18979120	It for her to leave, but you know
18979760	18981280	It's very interesting
18981280	18988240	I mean it was and also like she was so great to her portuguese fan base her brazilian fan base. I really think
18989040	18991840	um, she really paved the way for um
18994000	18996000	Brazilian vtubers
18996560	18998560	Oh
19001440	19005680	Yeah, I hope I hope yeah, I hope the girls are okay. Um in her leaving
19006640	19013120	And I just yeah, I just wonder what will be next for a lot of the smaller agencies in the community
19013920	19015680	um
19015680	19017040	like
19017040	19019440	Yeah, pixeling just debuted around the same time as us
19020400	19022400	um
19023120	19029520	What was it isn't like idle doing another gen or um, or was that or did I see that in a dream?
19030080	19032080	I can't remember. Um
19033120	19037200	I know they did like uh idle. Yes, which was really fucking cool
19039680	19043200	I'm brazilian. That was so cool. Yeah, like she she always
19043840	19048720	I always appreciated that she always did her her tweets in english and in portuguese
19049440	19051440	I'll on core. Yeah
19051760	19057040	Yeah, no not on core. Uh, the gen three. Yes the gen three. Okay. I'm not I'm not going insane
19057760	19059920	Uh, so I I look forward to their debuts, too
19061280	19063280	I'll be a little shiblit
19064000	19066240	Shiblit. I like that. I should have called you my shiblits
19067520	19069520	Sounds like shitlits
19069680	19072640	Sounds like cheek lays cheeklets cheek lays
19073840	19077760	You may know one day she has a recognizable voice. Oh, you know, she definitely does
19078960	19080480	um
19080480	19081760	She fucking
19081760	19084160	Imagine she shows up in fucking holo. Holy
19086400	19090240	That's like the chaser. I would lose my fucking mind. Um
19091840	19093840	Same brain so yeah
19093840	19096560	Me and mercy say to share the same brain cells so often
19097120	19100320	Like I think it's like so many times we've like gone to
19100960	19105120	Like message each other and we're like, oh shit wait and because like I was about to talk to you
19105360	19108400	And then like we'll talk about like the same thing at the same time
19108960	19111760	In the our journal part of the discord and we're just like
19116480	19121360	People with theorizing about holo and it happens. It'll be so reactive like live tweeting. Yeah
19123680	19130880	Yeah, um, I kind of feel like with one of them being a really former high profile
19131920	19133040	um
19133120	19135120	Artist in indie I feel like
19136800	19138800	That this
19139200	19144880	Honestly, this has started happening a couple months ago though. Everybody's kind of been talking about pls
19145520	19146880	um
19146880	19150640	I feel like going forward people be able to talk more freely about them
19151280	19154080	Because those connections just don't go away, you know
19155840	19159760	Uh, if when you're like very well known people recognize your voice
19160480	19163360	You have a lot of friends. It's yeah, it's hard to be like
19164480	19169200	Of course like n da's it gives this and you can only you can share so much
19169360	19172800	Oh, you can only share so much and that's fine, but I feel like
19174960	19176320	That
19176320	19180560	That will change and I don't think that's because of us. That's it's already been the in the
19181360	19184720	In the works and the v2 being community that taboo kind of
19185440	19190880	Not being a thing anymore, but I think like we're one of the first groups to normalize it
19191680	19193180	Which is cool
19193180	19196880	PLs often have the same save some corporates. Yeah, exactly. Like I know
19197680	19201760	Usually like people in the new idol wave are probably gonna be bill
19201760	19204960	I already know that we have recently graduated vice versa
19205840	19208960	Because you know v2 being community tends to recycle their
19209600	19212880	Fucking talents. Um, I think v for morai
19213760	19218320	Is one of the more recent ones where there are people that I don't know. I didn't know about before
19220480	19226400	Or some but and I'm very thankful for strongy giving us a chance because I know I was a nobody
19227200	19229200	Zura was very small
19229520	19231520	I see was very small
19232320	19233840	uh, so
19233920	19241040	And mercy was like a little like medium-sized and um, I mean was larger, but uh, like she
19242560	19248880	Gave us a chance and when she did see big names applying. So I appreciated that a bunch
19249760	19254000	Um, because I I never thought I was going to break into the industry because
19254720	19256720	People were kind of just going through the same
19257520	19263120	You know jump and jive of getting the same talents over and over if someone graduates just moves to another company
19264320	19266320	And I'm like am I ever
19266400	19269600	What is what is going to set me apart?
19270400	19275120	And let get me in especially if there's nepotism people just hire their friends. So
19275840	19277840	It was it was very I
19277840	19282720	After if I didn't get into velar, I probably wasn't gonna apply to any more companies anymore
19283680	19287440	Um, I was probably just gonna focus on being indie. So I'm very happy that I'm here
19288160	19292960	Mm-hmm cynical. Yeah, but
19296400	19299600	Be a bit cynical, but it's like when you see a pattern
19301360	19304880	And it's it becomes a habit like what else can you think, you know
19305680	19308560	Not that I like fault the people in the industry for that
19308960	19316880	It's better to you like you know what you're investing in and you know how somebody acts and they already have a good track record in history
19317120	19321200	Why would in experience? Why would you not hire them? Like that's it's to be a stupid
19321680	19326160	Businesses and not to why would I take a risk on some random nobody from twitch?
19327040	19328000	um
19328000	19330800	That doesn't have a lot of content creation under the belt
19331280	19331920	um
19331920	19335520	Where someone who's an agency for two years recently left like I
19336080	19339040	It's an it's a no-brainer. So I don't I don't blame it at all
19339440	19344080	But then there's people like strani who want to you know develop talent
19345040	19351040	And take chance and she had faith in us and I appreciate her immensely for that immensely
19352480	19355920	Did Amy give a lot of I don't know you'd have to ask her that
19359120	19361520	Yeah, you'd have to ask her that I I don't know and I
19364000	19365760	um
19365760	19370400	Yeah, I'll be honest with you. I don't know a lot of the other girls motivations for applying
19371360	19372720	um
19372720	19375040	My motivation again was I wanted
19377040	19379920	It wasn't really for me. I just wanted to support
19380880	19385280	Strani and I know I can be a good entertainer and yapper, you know, um
19386320	19387600	And
19387600	19389520	Yeah, I just I just wanted to support her
19389520	19395200	I wanted to make change in the community and I saw her as a force for change and I wanted to support support that
19395760	19400400	Um as for the other girl. Yeah, I have no idea what their motivations were for joining
19401120	19407440	Maybe they wanted to do more adult content. Maybe they wanted to grow their audience. Maybe they wanted a brand
19408160	19414160	Um, maybe they wanted more support. I think yeah, I feel like for some of them. It's probably like support
19414720	19416880	um for projects and stuff so
19420960	19425680	Glad you're here since detail kind of directed me to be alert. Yeah, it's like a yes detail has been really sweet
19425680	19429040	She's given us a bunch of shout outs that collab with her was really cool
19429920	19431920	um
19433760	19438160	I think I want to be a part of a group that too. Um, I feel I think
19439920	19440800	I'm
19440800	19445360	I forget somebody one of the girls did mention that like I just wanted to be a part of a group
19446160	19450560	And I can't remember who it was, but I know that was definitely a part of somebody's motivation
19451440	19453440	um
19453920	19455520	Amy, yeah
19455520	19462000	She is but like let's not talk about her stuff. Um, just because it's not my place to speak on it
19462720	19468640	Um, I'll talk about mine, but I won't talk about the other girls because it's not my place. It's not it's
19469040	19471040	I don't have any right to talk about it
19471520	19474800	Uh, scrawny knows how to pick them. It seems she does so she has an eye
19475520	19477520	for for talent
19477760	19479440	Um, yeah
19479440	19483440	She beats literally sorrow. I think more important than the size of the proof
19483440	19487600	There's a work ethic showing that you the library consistent work is reassuring that it lasts
19488160	19494320	Yeah, that's why scrawny was a little bit confused because she's like, how do you know so much and do so much?
19494480	19497920	But you've only been around for six months and then I explained to her in my interview
19498400	19504480	That I technically was around longer than that and I had more content creation on my belt. I just applied with this
19505200	19507200	version of myself, um
19508160	19511040	Although again the version before
19511760	19518480	My past life was just me and the flesh. So there's no point doesn't make sense to apply as my flesh version
19519120	19520320	um
19520320	19525920	And I was very deter I in my audition video. I just kind of expressed how
19526720	19531760	Determined I was to help in just how much I would be a hard worker. I didn't do some people
19532640	19538400	People asked like did you how did you like what sexual thing did you do to get in? I didn't do anything
19539120	19541840	remotely naughty besides be like
19542800	19544000	like make a
19544000	19546000	silly like joke
19547040	19549040	I just read I
19549440	19550880	um
19550880	19553200	I just introduced myself played some clips
19553920	19559040	Uh, I read all the characters voice lines and different voices that I do and then
19559840	19562400	Because I I I didn't really have a set person
19562960	19569200	That I wanted to be in the company. So I trusted strongy to cast me for the right role and I think she did
19569920	19571920	um
19571920	19577280	It's funny. I kind of knew I would be ropes like I looking at the silhouette
19577360	19579360	I was immediately attracted to it
19579760	19584960	I thought I was going to be cast as like I see to be honest with you because of my past life, but um
19585760	19588720	But I I just fucking knew deep down. It's really weird
19590160	19595440	Like for the long stream, she'd be yeah, of course. I mean I said that not sure if she's the only one
19599200	19603840	Context I don't know it. Um, yeah talk to him if you want to know 100%
19604400	19606400	I don't even really hate cold
19606880	19609200	She be jorked it. Yeah, I jorked it
19609200	19614720	She has a lollip because I used to be a lolly
19615840	19617840	Does he know?
19618240	19624560	People think your auditions was poor. Yeah, which makes me laugh because literally I'll tell you what I did in my audition
19625040	19626880	I introduced myself
19626880	19628560	I played one clip
19628560	19632240	I continued to introduce myself. I played another funny clip
19633200	19636320	I continued to introduce myself. I played an asmr clip
19637280	19639280	Um, that's what they do
19641120	19643120	I talked
19643360	19645360	I did some voice acting
19646240	19650400	And then I told my commitment to be a lure and that was literally it
19652880	19654880	That was literally the audition
19656560	19662160	No, no, yeah, I didn't do any Mongolian throat singing. I was made I made sure to keep that away. I didn't do any yodeling
19663120	19666720	Don't make jokes aside. I think you fit her perfectly. Yeah
19668320	19676000	What sassy thing did you do bro joining a corpo even spice seems exactly I was very professional um in my
19677040	19684080	Uh audition video and I also was very professional for my interview because I didn't know if I was interviewing

19690000	19691840	um
19691840	19695760	Because I didn't think it would be strong. I thought it would be just the management management team
19696080	19702320	But it was actually just her telling me. Oh, yeah, you were our first choice. You saw you. Here's your model. You made it in
19703040	19705040	Sign this nda

19719520	19724160	I don't know if I'm allowed to say that but I just did so I think I think that's fine
19726160	19731120	Um, how hard did you would fit it? I would do that was so hard. Um

19737600	19742080	Uh, they're always reviewed contracts. Yeah, exactly. Um
19744480	19746480	Yeah, it was just one interview
19746880	19749680	She was really nice. I had prepared like a whole thing
19751040	19753680	Like questions to ask how to respond
19754800	19755840	um
19755840	19757600	Very professional
19757600	19762880	I even like dressed up did my makeup in case she wanted to do like a video call and then
19763600	19766320	I realized yeah, it was just a normal way to go. Um
19767680	19769680	But yeah
19770400	19772400	How was the couch
19772400	19777680	Always a good sign when your player encourages you to fully examine your contract. Oh, yeah, she was very like, please look at it

19790960	19796000	I'm not allowed to say that I've read I had time to read my I don't know. I don't know if this shit works
19798320	19800320	You know hard it is for me to keep secrets
19801040	19805840	That's why I'm like, if any of you guys have any surprises, don't fucking tell me because we'll tell everyone
19805840	19811040	You know how hard it was just not say that I was she be it was so hard for me
19811440	19816320	I was dying. I changed the password on my account to my twitter
19818880	19821600	I had my friend change it and not tell me
19822800	19827760	So I couldn't get back in so I could so I wouldn't fucking accidentally sub tweet something
19828400	19830400	Or like something
19833280	19836960	Because I was so happy and when you're so happy you want to share it with people that you love
19837040	19841200	And so I wanted to share it with my community because I love my community and I knew they would be happy for me
19842720	19844720	Oh, yeah

19866800	19869840	Honestly though, that's that's that's me. That's why I
19870960	19875920	Like I already know a bit about gen 2 and it's very hard not to talk about it
19878400	19882400	But um before I go to bed, did you guys have any more questions for me?
19883040	19885200	I don't mind answering any questions you guys have
19885760	19888560	You guys know I'm a very open book and I love to yeah
19889200	19893600	And barely play games. I am a just chatting streamer. I have to fart
19895600	19898480	I don't know if you heard that whisper of a fart. I really hope you didn't
19900720	19902720	No spoilers for gen 2
19904400	19908160	You mean how strong he hasn't even said that gen 2 is in the works
19909920	19911920	Yes, she has
19912880	19915520	She definitely said the gen 2 is in the works
19919920	19921920	Huh, can you pronounce?
19931680	19936480	Yeah, I'm starting to can't stop talking about gen 2. She's so excited. Yeah, she's talking about fucking gen 3
19936480	19941600	It's talking about gen 3
19944080	19946080	Um
19946080	19948080	I had to be like can you stop
19948160	19954160	I'm like strani. You're making me feel bad. I'm like you're already conceptualizing gen 2 and 3. What about me?
19954320	19958320	She's like, no, no, no, no, I don't want you to feel bad. And I'm like, no, I'm kidding. I'm excited
19958640	19964160	Can I please help? And she's like, yes, I'm like, thank you slam girl. I was shot down, but it's fine
19967440	19970240	Okay, wait, how do you pronounce it then?
19972080	19974080	How do you pronounce it?
19977520	19984000	Yeah, I think me and strani are so like it's kind of weird. She's just in a Scottish font
19985920	19990480	She says she is gen 2 and gen 3 in games names for them. Yeah, exactly
19991360	19995120	I'm I'm gonna try to talk her down from some of the names. That's all I'm gonna say
19995120	19997120	I can't read
19997760	19999760	I can't read
20000080	20002480	Leave me alone. I don't speak French that well
20004400	20006400	I mean squarel
20006880	20010800	I can't read I can't I can't I can't
20012240	20014400	Should give you some towns
20016640	20018640	In my area to pronounce
20018640	20025680	Talks about Jennifer with slides will be destroyed
20027440	20031040	Pretty sure she has rescued herself from naming future gents. Yeah
20033040	20036720	The reason it's a slime girl is because she's thinking of the name of a slimy slime hole
20041760	20043760	One of them accidentally docks you wait what?
20045840	20047840	Oh like that. No, um
20049200	20051200	So like
20052560	20054560	I'm not
20054640	20058080	Afraid to say like I live in America on the east coast
20058880	20061680	There's a lot of how hard to pronounce
20063360	20065360	Like towns and cities
20065920	20068240	Like all around along the east coast
20069440	20072160	So like especially in fucking New England
20072240	20074240	I
20074720	20079280	Guys don't fuck with fondle of bosom. I actually really want to bring back fondle of bosom
20080080	20082480	And she could be like a really touchy feely person
20084080	20086640	Games is a video game. She got the concept for oh, okay
20088480	20092160	In death a member of project wheeler has a name her name is fondle
20093840	20095840	Of the liberty city. Yeah
20103120	20108240	You look nice when you're just laying in bed instead of walking and stomping all over my booze
20109520	20114400	East coast represent somebody said they knew I was east coast because I talk so bluntly
20115440	20118080	And that I have an accent and I never fucking noticed that
20119200	20121200	Come on beat that. Please come back
20121520	20123520	You can just say come on beat it
20124080	20126080	beat
20126800	20132080	They're like she's I just like I've never been clocked on where I like where I'm from
20132240	20133360	before
20133360	20135360	And I didn't know that being blunt
20136640	20140000	Was a thing like they knew where I was from and I was like
20141040	20143040	Damn
20143280	20145280	I did not think that I also
20146320	20151200	I well, yeah, I use eastern. Yeah, that's fine. Um, and I also I talk fast
20152240	20157200	Because I know people from the south talk slower. Remember when I visited my grandparents in florida
20157600	20159360	um
20159360	20163680	They would like people I would talk to you that were that was like can you speed the fuck up?
20164800	20166800	Because you're talking
20167280	20170560	Like this. Oh my god was so fucking annoying
20172480	20176480	When you said you visited Montreal, that's more evident around the east coast. That's a good point
20177280	20182160	East coast is kind but not nice. Oh, yeah. No east coasts. We're fucking dicks
20183680	20186720	Especially massachusetts. That's why they call them mass holes
20187760	20189760	I always thought that was funny. They call them that
20191440	20196720	Yeah, new england people are cold, especially a lot of people are chill. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of people are chill
20198160	20200160	medicaid people are fucking uppity
20201040	20202640	try thing
20202640	20204640	North Carolina, georgia
20205440	20207440	They're kind of nice
20207440	20209440	carolinas are nice
20210800	20215520	Strings them and how much information is conveyed per second by different languages and accents, right? Yeah
20215760	20218260	Because you can literally like especially if you're in like the uk
20219520	20221520	You can clock someone's accent
20222400	20224400	Because they're all accents are by region
20226400	20228400	Like i'm sure you could probably look at a british
20228800	20234400	Vtuber and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of british vtubers change their accents so that they don't
20235760	20237760	You don't know where they're from
20238960	20240960	The latel fiends are in our own special
20245600	20248400	We have to be chillin florida or else we'd melt
20249200	20250800	true
20250800	20255280	Got the opposite. It's not yin and yin only other field filipino side was british or something
20255840	20257840	No, i'm pretty sure i have american accent
20258400	20260400	yeah, i've got
20261760	20265520	Like i do have like i'll have an accent sometimes that slips out
20266400	20270240	And i don't know if a lot of people have like heard it slip out
20271120	20273120	Like obviously i'm from america
20273440	20276480	And east coast but i like sometimes when i get super excited
20277280	20279280	um
20279520	20284000	My or like frustrated or i just like really tired and my words slur together
20284480	20286320	um, i start to have
20286320	20288320	My accent comes out
20288560	20290000	but uh
20290000	20292000	Miss origan tipped 50 dollars
20292400	20298080	You're the first vtuber i've ever watched and you quickly become probably my favorite content creator period
20298880	20301200	Also could as three percent get get some donnie
20310400	20313840	Such good girls, thank you
20315760	20317760	Best girl
20319200	20324480	And they say hello, so yeah, no i'm that type of person like i'll like i'm also really bad with eye contact
20324720	20328560	um, i've always been bad with eye contact even in working in sales and
20329040	20334080	Being a lot more confident than it used to be. I just don't like looking at people. I don't know what the fucking tell you
20334480	20336480	i'm squirt
20338080	20340080	No, i'm kidding. Um, no, where am i?
20343760	20347600	And so i'll usually just like look down and smile
20348240	20352480	Um, but lately i've been trying to say hello to people
20354960	20356960	um
20358640	20360640	Um
20361520	20366320	Although like i remember going to the south and people are like too nice and i'm like stop talking to me
20366320	20369280	Like why are you striking up a conversation with me? I was at a wawa
20369600	20374240	I'm like and this guy like is like i'm getting coffee and i'm one of like the little station
20374320	20377360	And then this guy comes and starts talking to me and i'm like, uh
20378640	20380640	Why are you talking to me like you don't
20381440	20385120	You don't have to talk to me right now. Like can you please go away?
20396560	20399920	But like i've also adapted a skill that i've seen my dad do
20400640	20404640	Um, my dad has a special skill where he can be friends with about anyone
20406800	20410400	Uh, he finds common ground. He makes a joke
20411600	20415280	And then miraculously he just becomes friends with this person and then
20416000	20419120	He i might say becomes friends with everybody. I'm not even fucking joking
20419440	20423440	He'll talk he'll like catch a snippet of a conversation that someone's having on the street
20423680	20426720	Make a joke and then make the person laugh and then they're just friends
20427360	20434320	He like i forget what the fuck he did. So my dad really likes to drink bourbon. Um, he likes uh, he's a collector
20434880	20435920	um
20435920	20441360	And like if you go to my parents house, they look they're a bunch of fucking alcoholics because they just have a shit ton of bourbon
20441680	20444560	In this one side of the room, but it's it's it's not even like that
20444560	20448880	My dad just likes to collect and like have it not even drink it. Um
20450320	20452800	And so he goes to like this place
20453360	20456560	Strikes up a conversation just being really friendly and getting to know
20457040	20459040	They're like cracking jokes with the cashier
20459680	20460720	and then
20460720	20462720	Over the course of a couple weeks
20462960	20467760	He becomes like boys with the cashier and then the cashier hooks him up with like
20468080	20471120	Really like and like calls him ahead when they get in like good stuff
20471440	20476880	And i'm like what the fuck and i'm like, oh wait, it just pays to be nice to people because then they're nice back
20478640	20480480	So um
20480480	20486720	And then like i'm like, you know, so i'm trying to be more like my dad in that way and just be nice to people
20490800	20492800	Just fucking
20493200	20495200	It's cat hair in my mouth

20685120	20687120	It was like
20688160	20690160	What the fuck did I miss something?
20696000	20701200	If you think you look at that, oh, no, if you guys saw me be like, who is this little stinky rat girl
20702320	20704320	I looked like I was going to rob someone
20706000	20710640	Wawa you narrowed that down a bit. Well, it was a wawa because there's no wawa's in our area
20711920	20713920	Right from they don't we don't have wawa
20716000	20718000	So
20725680	20730000	It's like the little the little innocence of kids like they don't need like they're not rude
20730080	20733280	There's no malice behind what they say like they're just generally
20734400	20737760	Just talking to you like and it's just it's refreshing
20738480	20740480	But
20743680	20747280	Yeah, it's just like I want to be more like that like just be like hey
20748640	20752640	And that's why like that's what I'm gonna try to do in the v2 breed thing like community and shit
20752880	20754880	That's why like I'm trying to
20755280	20759840	Like be like hey, I'll do this thing with you or I'll do this collab or I'll do that
20768080	20771680	And it adopted me. Yeah, maybe I guess so
20772480	20774640	um
20774640	20778960	Oh, yeah, that's not what morgan said reminds me. Uh, I remember I went to like
20779920	20781120	uh
20781120	20783120	An event where I dressed up
20784320	20786320	Yeah, as in like a cosplay
20786880	20787920	um
20787920	20792800	And this little girl asked to take a picture with me and I literally wanted to cry and like other people wanted to take pictures with me
20792800	20794400	And I was just like, oh my god
20794480	20798000	Like they think I'm gonna I look cool enough to ask for a picture
20799040	20801040	And I was like, okay
20802240	20804240	It was it was it's nice
20808160	20814720	I know rena rena's looking at me like why aren't you in bed yet? She'd be piqued. Yeah, it's only downhill for me or guys
20816720	20819120	She'd be cool. I try to be cool
20819120	20821120	I
20822000	20824000	See me I try to be cool
20824000	20826880	I think I'm a cool cat cool rabbit, you know
20828080	20830720	I'm cool. Yeah, I can be cool. I can be hip with the kids, you know
20831680	20835760	I know about fortnight and um fortnight dances and v-wux and all that
20842400	20844560	Cool rabbit sheep. Yeah, exactly
20845040	20850160	Kids don't have souls. Oh, yeah, no, there's definitely some like kids that are like really fucking shitty out there
20850800	20854000	Like I don't want kids, for example. I like I don't want kids
20855200	20861760	One because I don't know if I didn't have kids because I don't know if I have falls less than over a century or not, but um
20863120	20867600	I also just like it's a lot to raise a whole ass child. Like I don't want to
20868240	20870720	Traumatize them and make them hate me
20871680	20876720	I know what I put my parents through so I don't want to put my child through that with me
20878640	20881120	Um, you know fucking children are expensive
20882240	20885840	That means like I'm 56. Where am I gonna find a dude?
20886960	20888960	Who wants to have kids with me?
20889760	20894240	I'm like, I don't I just don't fucking care. I just like having cats
20894960	20896160	I
20896160	20901600	Was at a con for some reason. There's a couple of people that cosplay that didn't want their photo taken. Oh, yeah
20902480	20906720	Sometimes you just go just to dress up and have fun. I got it. They just want to take pictures with their friends
20907600	20908880	right here
20908880	20910880	To be too boy, no show would be dope
20912720	20915200	I find you have a sort of effless cool with how Jenny when you are
20916240	20917920	you know, uh
20917920	20921920	I feel like that's actually not the first time someone said that to me not to toot my own horn
20922720	20927760	Um, people have always said I'm just really easy to talk to and that's why people tend to like
20928400	20930400	Accidentally overshare with me
20931600	20935280	Uh, uh, I'll just be like, hey, how are you feeling? They'd be like, um, you know
20935680	20940000	Try to make small talk and then I'm not the type of person who I just like walk away and be like, okay
20940240	20945280	Thanks for checking in. Um, I'll like like elaborate with my question. Raina. What the fuck are you doing?
20946080	20948960	She's rubbing against my monitor lady. Can you?
20949840	20950960	No
20950960	20952400	ma'am
20952400	20953920	I can't stop you
20953920	20955920	I'm too tired to reach over
20956400	20958720	It's your little twitchy, but what are you doing?
20960000	20962000	Hi, Raina
20964800	20970240	Raina's like lost weight and she looks so goofy. I mean she used to be super fucking overweight. She was like 17
20970880	20972880	Almost 20 pounds. Um
20973760	20975760	But she lost a lot of weight
20976640	20982480	Sadly because she went through a little depressing episode when her sister passed away, which I don't blame her and when I moved into my apartment
20982480	20984480	I took her with me. Um
20985520	20987680	Yeah, Raina, she's a little meow
20988480	20989840	um
20989840	20993680	So she's she's got a healthy weight now, but I miss her her chunky size
20994960	20996960	Oh you purring big mamas
20997920	21001920	Oh, yeah, she was she was a chonker because Siamese cats tend to overeat
21002720	21006480	She's my life stories, ma'am
21009120	21012560	Do you think your openness is a good thing or has it caused you unwanted problems?
21013280	21014560	um
21014560	21017920	I think some people probably wish that I was a little bit more
21018720	21021920	left things to the imagination or like didn't share
21023280	21026880	Like I know sometimes things I'll share something like I bet
21027520	21029520	someone has like
21029840	21032960	Like I said like I want a reduction and they're like, oh, why the
21033520	21039120	Ruin filtered. Why did she have to say that? Oh, no, but like I'm just telling you
21040560	21042560	You know just because I want to tell you
21043920	21045920	And like that's fine. That's okay
21046960	21048480	um
21048480	21052160	It is what it is or like I might say something like oh, I'm not gonna do this content
21053200	21056480	Like oh, why would you say that? Oh because I'm gonna be honest
21056480	21059440	Do you want to just be strung along and let on? No, like
21060240	21064720	If you want me to lead you on I'll lead you on I suppose sorry rena's are being against my microphone
21065440	21067440	um
21067760	21069760	I'm like this. I'm just how I am
21072000	21076000	Buenos dias shippies me fun time freddy. So what did I miss?
21077360	21079360	Buenos dias freddy
21080800	21084080	Well, buenas noche. It's night time for me freddy
21085040	21087040	It's night time for me
21090800	21092080	um
21092080	21094080	but I think people also
21095040	21102960	Are refreshed by my openness as a vtuber because vtubers usually constantly play as something or pretend to be someone or not or
21104400	21108640	And I think I I like how real I am. So I I think I'm refreshing in that
21109440	21113920	You know it if you don't like it, I can't stop you from not watching
21114480	21116480	I'm gonna fucking glue your eyes to the screen
21119040	21121440	You want to be led in a leash not in false sense
21125760	21128640	She won't make submissive crying a some more it's over
21128960	21130960	I
21134000	21140960	Realness of this whole company is refreshing. Yes, I agree with that because I feel like we're all very real
21141360	21143360	Like we're all very open
21143760	21148240	Which you don't get and I know that actually can put a lot of people off because you know
21148800	21151840	First some it might ruin the fantasy
21152640	21155520	And I understand that I can't disagree with you
21156240	21158000	um
21158000	21160320	But for some it kind of like makes it better. I don't know
21161680	21166240	Most of us appreciate it. It might be small, little minority who complain. Yeah
21167040	21169040	Yeah
21169760	21171760	um
21171840	21176160	And I do you want to say like who who complain their opinions are still valid. Um
21177520	21181200	I don't want you to ever think just because like we might disagree on something that
21182240	21184960	I fucking hate you. It's really hard for me to hate people
21185920	21187920	uh
21188080	21190080	Definitely open on the else
21191200	21198160	Open this asshole. Um rena. Can I please move you? She's like just sitting on me and I'm like uncomfortable
21198640	21202720	She's just you're not in a good position to sit on me lady
21204320	21207360	Thank you. I appreciate it. She's moved to the bed
21209200	21211200	um
21212000	21214000	I miss her and I thought you said Europeans
21214720	21216720	are still valid
21217280	21219280	your opinions
21220000	21222000	Europeans are still valid
21224640	21226640	um, but
21234000	21238960	They're not valid. Oh, no, okay. Um, like you're
21239920	21243280	You're still allowed to dislike me
21244320	21249840	I'll like the content or do how I talk or what I might do in the future or what the other girls do
21250480	21253440	um, but you just don't have to make it a habit to
21254400	21256400	Try to drag us, you know
21256560	21258560	You can just leave
21258800	21261280	Just shut your eyes and walk away from the computer, bro
21263040	21265520	Or just like look up that one Tyler the creator tweet
21269760	21274800	Hey, European people in chat. You're valid. I think they're all asleep right now. It's very late for them
21277440	21281120	Maybe I don't know what time is it for the our European friends
21283200	21286720	I'm probably gonna as mercy streaming today. I'll probably read into her
21287520	21290560	If you want fantasy, you probably have to find specific vtubers that do that
21290560	21294720	Some people just use models because they want to be secretive or have to set up stuff. That's true
21295520	21297280	I think
21297280	21298880	you know
21299840	21301840	I
21303760	21306000	I was totally prepared to like
21306720	21308720	play a character
21309120	21311120	Being in v alert an agency
21311680	21317520	But I think to be honest because of my audience and because of management and astronomy
21318480	21323520	I feel comfortable being myself. I think if I got into like a different company
21323680	21326080	I could be like say so I could be
21326960	21328960	You know play the character
21329440	21333280	Um, I did definitely kind of play a character when I was ran up
21333680	21335440	But I really do
21335440	21337520	Feel and I'm kind of just realizing this now that
21338400	21340400	I'm very much myself
21340800	21342080	As she be
21342080	21344080	It's very interesting
21344720	21346720	Is there is life? Oh, okay
21346880	21349120	Or maybe I can just like raid someone random
21350080	21353520	Make, you know, I've got to make those friendships those connections raid someone from
21354240	21356240	A different different company
21357600	21360560	In characters with the patreon audios are for yeah, exactly
21361040	21365360	Um, and then sometimes, you know, there's different roles that I play in the patreon audios
21365680	21366560	but
21366560	21369200	I hope you guys liked it by the way. Um, again, that was
21369680	21374640	This month is the first month that I recorded back in april and I've definitely learned a lot since then
21374960	21375840	so
21375840	21382160	I feel I feel like because I've recorded three months of audios in advance. Uh, I recorded june july and august
21382720	21387760	Uh, I I was gonna start september. I haven't done that yet. I'll probably do it soon. Um,
21388400	21392080	But the september audios will probably be a lot
21393040	21396880	Different than like because just because like the feedback I've gotten
21397600	21399840	Um, the advice I've gotten
21400800	21406000	So I feel like there'll be improvements like at least september on
21406720	21408400	uh, and then
21408400	21413440	You guys have also given feedback to like strani and stuff about like the scripts you want us to fill
21414000	21418000	Come and that's why like strani wants like, oh, we need to make a whole month of you
21418000	21421920	Just like straight dom like hardcore and I'm like facts. Please. Let's do it
21422320	21425680	That's what we give the people what they want. Give them the dom that they ask for
21426480	21428480	um, but yeah
21428640	21431520	Okay, oh, yeah, no, it's I've paced myself for that
21432240	21434240	um
21434240	21435440	I also
21435440	21441920	I have a lot of free time. Um, when I was out of work on leave and now since I'm just I've quit entirely
21442560	21444240	um
21444240	21448240	I so I just cranked them out. The other girls had a lot of other obligations
21448240	21451440	They had to do so like I finished a lot of my shit in the first month
21452800	21455600	Like I and then I was like, please strani throw most rough at me
21455600	21460080	So should you just get thrown scripts at me? Um and shorts at me to do
21460720	21463040	But yeah, don't worry about me. I don't
21463920	21465920	Me and strani
21466880	21472320	Like I attain to be as hard working as strani is she is the hard-working working autism
21472400	21474800	I don't have autism that I fucking know of
21475120	21480000	Um, but I am definitely inspired by her work ethic to work as much as I do
21481840	21484160	M's and the switches are eating good on them of facts
21484720	21489920	Yeah, like listening to them patriot, but I still need to listen to the second one more to finalize my feedback. Okay
21490720	21495440	I feel like I don't know why I just got the equivalent of like someone sipping wine be like
21497440	21500160	I need to finalize my feedback for this flavor
21503840	21508320	But yeah, I hope if you're going to sleep good night, um, I'm gonna raid someone
21508720	21514720	Let's see. Maybe we'll yeah, maybe we'll raid someone new. I don't know if anybody's streaming us late
21520880	21522880	Let's see
21524320	21526320	Yeah, me
21527920	21533440	I think I'm gonna raid Maeve. Yeah, she just hit 100k. I'm just playing Elden Ring

21572080	21574080	not streaming the game as much
21574640	21579920	Um, but it was giving me a lot of issues. I was just on top of you guys. I'm sorry if that bothers you
