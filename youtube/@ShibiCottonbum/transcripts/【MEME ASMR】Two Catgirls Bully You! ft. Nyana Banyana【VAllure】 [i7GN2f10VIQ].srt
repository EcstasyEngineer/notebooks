00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You

You

38
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You

39
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Hello. Hello. We're live. We're live. Oh my god, they stole my pudding. I can't believe they did this. We have to teach them a lesson.

40
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, what lesson should we teach them, like math? No, I think we should teach them a lesson that involves pain, Neanna, for what they did to you.

41
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, let's teach them pain. Let's do it. We're going to get some pain tools. What should we get?

42
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think I have a bat laying around. Let me hold on. Here we go. I got it. What do you got? I have a gun. Should I use that?

43
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't think you should use the gun just yet, but if they don't give the pudding over, then maybe we can switch to gun.

44
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Oh, okay, okay. Then I have a frying pan. Yeah. Okay, frying pan works.

45
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm going to get all Latina on them. I'm going to show them what real Latina rage is like.

46
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yep, they're lucky you're only taking out the pan and not the chunk, you know, like. Yeah, they won't know it.

47
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They're themselves lucky. Yeah. Should we slap them?

48
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think we should slap them. I think we should start beating the crap out of them.

49
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah. No, it's your turn.

50
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm bonking. I'm bonking them. You're blocking them. You got to tell them stuff too.

51
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't know. What do I say? I don't speak Spanish. You got to spit on them.

52
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I got to spit on them? All right. Hold on. Let me call them up. What's a pendejo?

53
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It means pendejo.

54
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay, okay. You pendejo.

55
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Pendejo.

56
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Pendejo.

57
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Pendejo.

58
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Come on.

59
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's what you got for stealing my pudding.

60
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I can't believe it. You piece of shit.

61
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Chad's saying, why does the Dom need Dom lessons?

62
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They don't know what they're talking about.

63
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Get it. Dom, get it out.

64
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Dom, stupid, idiot stealing stuff.

65
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Get these cats from the Brady cat.

66
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Look at the tears, bro. They're crying for real.

67
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I see the tears coming out of their eyes. It's very, it's very satisfying.

68
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

69
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I like it when they cry.

70
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's always the best when they cry.

71
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah. Now do we kill them?

72
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm kind of tempted. It's like, oh, this is a school.

73
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't know how he snuck in guns to school.

74
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I got my ways.

75
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm kind of impressed.

76
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Honestly, I know you were something of a gang banger, Niana, but I didn't know you were like that.

77
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah. I'm all of the gang banger.

78
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I have all of the gang banger inside of me.

79
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's what I did. You know what?

80
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We should play GTA.

81
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We should do that.

82
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And then we should, I should go and show you what it's like to be a real gang banger.

83
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah. And I can join your gang. Are you part of it?

84
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah. I'm part of my gang.

85
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What's your gang name?

86
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's called Las Pendejas.

87
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Las Pendejas?

88
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah.

89
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We're the real Pendejas.

90
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah. You can be a Pendeja too.

91
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay. I'm down.

92
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah. Let's do it.

93
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay. Now give me your lunch money.

94
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You know what? I think we should just shake them down and steal their stuff.

95
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah. Okay.

96
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Give us your money.

97
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Give us the money.

98
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You stole her pudding, so we have to buy her more.

99
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So hand it over.

100
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Hand it over.

101
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Hand over that pudding.

102
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Put in these nuts in your mouth.

103
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
No. Okay.

104
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, we can, I don't have, we can take off their nuts and we can stick them in their mouth.

105
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, that's a lot of stuff. You can do that.

106
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay.

107
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Like when he's dead, we can possibly do that. I don't know.

108
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah. I don't know why you would do that when he's dead.

109
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Because it's just ultimate disrespect.

110
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's what they deserve.

111
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Like teabag him?

112
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Like when you teabag someone after they die?

113
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah. Except I'll be cutting off his balls and sticking them in his mouth.

114
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So.

115
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Okay.

116
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Everything in 4K.

117
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm going to be the one on the camera.

118
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Are you going to sell this on the dark web?

119
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah. I'm going to put it on the dark web.

120
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
With all of the beheaded videos.

121
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh, perfect.

122
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We're going to make so much freaking money after what they did to you.

123
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They don't deserve anything.

124
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You know?

125
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We're going to be rich.

126
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You only have 78 cents in a cat sticker?

127
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Are you poor?

128
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Come on.

129
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I know we don't go to the best school, but what's happening?

130
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

131
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We're going to shake him up.

132
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
There has to be more stuff in there.

133
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah. What else do you got?

134
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah. What else do you have chat?

135
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What do you have chat?

136
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Tell us what you got.

137
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You're absolutely. You're just broke.

138
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You're just poor. You're useless.

139
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I just.

140
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That pudding was so good.

141
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Thank you.

142
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Get him.

143
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Get him.

144
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Thank you.

145
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You fucking banejo.

146
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

147
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
How do you say...

148
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
How do you say your mother is a whore?

149
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Your mother is a whore.

150
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Your mother is a whore.

151
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah.

152
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah.

153
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is the learning Spanish street.

154
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah. This isn't it.

155
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This is me learning Spanish.

156
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes.

157
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The kidneys, especially the kidneys.

158
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Get the kidneys.

159
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah.

160
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
How did you even...

161
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I think we got to interrogate them a little bit.

162
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah.

163
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
How did you even know she had that pudding?

164
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
She was in the park. How did you haunt her down?

165
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah. How did you haunt me down in the park, bro?

166
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What is a mamabicho?

167
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Is that like...

168
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Mamabicho, that means friendship and magic and homie love.

169
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's kind of like kiss a homie but less gay.

170
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, okay. That's pretty nice.

171
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I guess. Does that make me a mamabicho?

172
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah. You can be a homie.

173
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah. We're homies.

174
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
She's a mamabicho.

175
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah.

176
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Your gang...

177
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Who in the gang sold you out, Niana?

178
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Someone said you were sold out.

179
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Who the fuck did it?

180
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I want some names, okay?

181
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah. We need some names.

182
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Give us some names.

183
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000

capital is what are you talking about yeah okay and then what else can I show you but they had

316
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,400
four girls but I doubt there's girls in this chat

317
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,440
I'm blessed unless anyone to prove me wrong any ladies in the place with style and grace

318
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,600
put your hands in the air if you would you're player too if I usually have two percent female

319
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:27,080
watchers yeah to present but I think it's not real it's fake yeah it's probably really fake

320
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,280
they probably it's just like when they when they go to make a character in a video game and they

321
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,320
always just pick a female character they just selected that for youtube see youtube they use

322
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,400
their girls because they always play the girl the female player dingy character yeah I think

323
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,560
I think honestly the two percent is just the two like the people that the girls that I've

324
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:57,320
collabed with before yeah that like cuz I know like I have I have I model the vtubers that I come

325
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:03,560
through so I guess they're otherwise there's nobody in a I think they're hiding if they're here
