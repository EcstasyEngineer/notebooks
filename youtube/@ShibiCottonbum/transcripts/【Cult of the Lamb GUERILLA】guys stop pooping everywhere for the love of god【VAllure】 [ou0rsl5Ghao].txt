Fuck you. Why did you hurt me?
At least they're like shooting in one direction
At least I have the breakable ones like a lot of stone this way
Hey, I need to go by I need to sell stuff. I need to get more tarot cards
One of my pet peeves is what people call tarot cards tarot cards
Although I get it
Oh, he gave me divine blast back or something else. I don't know what that was
What is the relic I need to
I never completed that last time I played
I looked that up one of you guys can look that up for me. What the relic kudai is asking about
Okay, okay, do you know tarot is not a game
Just so you know don't recommend treating tarot as a game
Because you can do accidentally do some fucked up shit if you do that
There's someone who is knowledgeable about reading tarot cards
Watch 100% get rid of any more relics. I'm gonna go this way. Maybe the relic is over here
Oh
Why did you just I didn't even press anything you just stopped talking
All right
Fuck oh I need more money
God damn it
God damn it
It's a follower meet because I want to be able to do the thing where we can eat each other
All right, let me just look that up real quick. Yeah, don't treat weija weija
Ouija boards
Weija Ouija
Ouija you're Ouija. Um, it's a cavey that guy because you'll just invite some fucked up shit into your home
What is kudai
Not kudai
Why is a pee
Uh cult
Oh
Okay interesting
Uh, yes, I actually I can read tarot. Um, I liked doing tarot card readings
When I was a priestess in another life, I did a lot of occult stuff. I did a lot of occult research for people. I um
Uh
Like I did like the pagan
Uh
Pagan roots of like holidays every time there was a holiday. I did a video on it. They'll just I mean stream on it
It's really fun
I'll probably only do that though
When I do it with emmy because I just feel like I wouldn't fit my content if I did it
I'm also like that's any content. There's a lot of reasons why people thought I was gonna be emmy because she was the occult one
I'll give me some rocks
Yeah, tarot's before yes, uh, come on. No, Sarah as well. Yeah, one day. Maybe a collab with emmy
I remember tarot in a while
The last time I remember tarot for myself was before I got accepted into Bueller
I
I will always die to these things no matter what
There was a way to be like spawning that type of monster you would guys would just fuck me the entire time
Um how to fate super no, I don't know. I kind of like my
My area of attack one when I go back to the other one
Tarot like most of these were occult stuff in the west
French tarot, uh, I feel like
I've never heard of french tarot to be honest with you unless it's just like in french culture to use tarot like the
because the writer, writer waits tarot
To use that for
Just like every day because some people just like do stuff in their day to day just to um
It's like predictions like or just for advice. So I wouldn't be surprised if like the fucking french do that
It sounds like a french thing to do
Yeah, I know where your fucking relic is nobody just you wait
Yeah
Tarot is you know, it's linked to it is mostly used for the occult and I think in western cultures. Oh fuck me
um
Uh, but also in like
I feel like a lot of like native cultures
Tarot is used as a divination tool
Um, I when I would do streaming with tarot
I would usually just recommend if you didn't believe in it or you feel comfortable with it
You can use it as a reflection or introspection tool
That would be the little oh those cards. Yeah, I've not used those cards before
Because I'm always like you can do you don't have to believe in what it is. We can just have fun
See what it has to say and then 99 percent of the time
If not a hundred
Um
I was oh fuck me
Right about whatever they were going through
All right, oh you're gonna you're gonna be a bitch to fight aren't you?
Oh my god, oh, I wish I had the dagger
Oh my god

Because I don't know if I can do that

Remember I get plenty of food to imagine maybe i'll go and i'll
I didn't I didn't go and see my dad. So like maybe I should go and see my dad
Although he's out of the hospital, but no

I'm all right
I'm just like I just don't like talking to people

Like maybe like an outdoors one
Or like a more active one because like it was really cool doing jujitsu, but after
I got like could like having fibro and stuff and they're on fire this in my neck. Although I'm like
fucking young at age 56. Um
I just I couldn't do it anymore because it was just painful
It was such a good full body workout
And it's usually what happens to people like I got injured and I can't train
It was cool though, I went to my old school and I watched people get um promoted to belts
I'm like wow, they'll never be me
It is like I hadn't been so passionate about something
So sucks when the source things happens
Uh, I was Brazilian jujitsu
I
There's this one dude, um, you remember how I told you that I accidentally put one of my um
Like spar sparring partners to sleep so
Mind you he didn't tap like if it was if he tapped
Then
I wouldn't have I would have let up, you know
He never tapped he just like went to sleep and it's not like he didn't couldn't tap
He could have easily tapped
But um, so his friend
His friend, um
Bumi what are you saying?
Put me in a
Uh
To lock and just fucking cranked my ankle
And he was like and then I had to tap during our our spar and it fucking hurt so bad
My ankle was swollen
He's like that was putting putting that kid to sleep
And I'm like you're a fucking piece of shit. You're lucky that you're better than me or I put you in the ground
Um because he was a blue belt
And I also fucking hated him because every time I rolled with him you just smelled like fucking cum
I'm like who sweats and they smell like this. It's like so gross
And at that time I was the only girl in my class because the the girls they used to I used to train with stopped going and I was like, come on
Like I can put you I can probably put like an unexperienced person in a holds
um
like I remember um
Salem one of my best friends, um, she
I was like showing her some moves and so I put her in a rear naked chokehold in the middle of our store
In a retail store that we worked at and she just let out the like the most like
The most cute and funny scream because she's a high-pitched voice. She was like
Like she sounded like fucking r2d2
It was so funny
And um
Come here squirrel
So like for her it was it was easy. Oh sweet. I think it would um, let's see
I don't know
This way because I think we have what a second time
This is french perfume, but like I had never
Experienced that because like being in gym class with people from school
um
Like or the other guys that I would roll with I'm just like why the fuck do you smell like
Nutt
Like that's so fucking gross
Like
Like like you know how like people have like pheromones
And stuff and like sometimes when you sweat you smell good
Like
I've had people certain people tell me like I um
When I sweat I smell good. I remember like reading that right now. What are you doing?
She's like on my lap that if you like have something that's like someone's like sweating and they smell good to you
you're like
You know, you're like genetically pre-disposed to want to like be with them or something
Uh, it was a mix of gi and no gi
Um, we were doing that when I was rolling with them, then we were we were doing um
I don't know if it was up
We were doing a gi and we were trying a collar
Collar submissions
My favorite was
Doing a bow and arrow choke
You start the last time
I got the money for it. We're not
You
Don't think you feel like dislikes anyone sweat smell. Well, that means that you know, I guess you're genetically pre-disposed like those people
Someone if you means like I think it's like I remember reading that like if someone smells good to you that
You would have you would have it's because they're like genetically
healthy
To your mind and you want to
appropriate with them
Some creates strong babies very like
Basic instincts come here bird
Yeah, something to do the microbiome immune system. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Like it's like, oh, I if you smell bad
You like must be sickly or like you're just disgusting
Forgive me. She forgive me. She be chat. I accidentally spoiled the story. That was very not cool
I said too much. I'm sorry. Don't want to spoil it again. No more spoilers. No, it's all right, freddy
We forgive you freddy. Don't worry about it. I'm as happy you're here freddy
Oh, it explains a lot my teacher demonstrated it bow and bow and arrow on me and this is so it's so fun to do
I just drive my fucking knees into the person's back
To create a large brood
Yes, a large brood
Oh, it's not really I need like one more flower thing
I
Am I here rain and plowing because she's right next to the mic. Oh, hello
Will
So I started blasting. I think I'm fine. I think I'm good
Oh
Yeah
Yeah, I think for me smell is like a
Very big thing to me because of big your breath smells. I don't want you anywhere near me
You got the helitosis stay the walk away from me bud
Like I remember having customers and like such like I had one guy that I could smell his breath
from like
Five feet away. It was bad out
I think didn't go off
Like helped you get into dumb of nature it really did though because like
It was a really good like if
I always recommend if you like have anger issues or something
Going to the gym or like doing a contact sport
Is so
satisfying
because I would like
I would just be like so
angry and pent up and like fucking depressed and then
I would just go and beat up dudes like it was so great. It was so awesome
I
Was just super satisfied and it also was just like super
Empowering in a way because like I knew I like if course came just
Fucking rain. I just stepped on my nipple. Holy shit. Oh my god claw just
Essentially just pierced my nipple
Oh
Oh, not you guys
Oh, not you guys
Especially mixed with the fucking bats
What's why did you have to spawn more?
Uh, I was not paying attention. Oh, fuck me
Thanks guys accidents do happen a lot. I'm just gonna let the story narrate itself. See you guys later. Bye freddy
Stay fun time
Yeah, it's just like you're just like a good type of tired
after
Um doing jiu-jitsu
Because one I like I like jiu-jitsu because it was I was almost like fucking
Being in the military because he got into practice like discipline and respect
Um with restraint
Oh, let's see how they are doing. I kind of want to get a grand shelter
I'm gonna get this fucking propaganda speakers. I'm gonna get a grand shelter. Oh, wait, no, I want to do the one that
I
Although like I remember like my dad was trying to teach me how to deadlifts because my dad deadlifts um
And that was pretty cool, too. Like it was super satisfying. I only did it like once though because it wasn't
As satisfying as like laying a sport was
Yeah, you are best get real close and comfortable
Also, I don't know if it's the same in the u.s. But my gym was such an inclusive sport
Yeah, like 100 it really was because I
It because I could tell like some of the guys would hold back when they um sparred with me
I'm gonna buy you now. Yes, fucking. Thank you. Oh my god. Thank you so much go to sleep
Go to sleep
Um
I
Um, but yeah, oh as I was saying, um, oh my god, I'm gonna talk that up
I would say like how am I gonna learn if you you know
Don't give the same like how am I? Oh my god. How am I gonna defend might be able to like
Grow as a
um
As a participant if you don't
Help me out a little bit
And so then they were like, you know what? Okay. And then I would learn like what my limits are and how to hold my own
and it was
It was like it just leveled the playing field. The only thing that was annoying is that my tits got in the way a lot
I remember I had a guy like accidentally like go for
a
For some grips and he like grabbed me in the boob
And he was like, oh fuck. Sorry. And I'm like, huh get rekt and then I like I like did an inversion and then I just fucked him up
I'm like, I don't give a shit. This isn't
like
It's not like it's a different situation. Like we're sparring. We're just we're just doing whatever
Put his ass inside control real quick
Have person to be like come at me um growing up in school. Nobody wanted to fight me
Because I was one taller than everybody
um
And I it was weird like I have this weird thing where if someone
Like comes at me and starts to like try to argue with me or something. I just laugh at them
And it's probably like a nervous tick of mine, but
It it seems like intimidates people is what I've been told
Because I remember this girl came up to me. She's like, um at work and she's like
One I am not like a gossipy person. I'm not. Um, I don't have the energy. I'm too fucking old for that shit
It's not high school anymore
And she's like, have you been talking shit about me? And I literally started
Hysterically laughing at her. I'm like, who the fuck told you that?
If I had something to say I'd say to your fucking face
And I was pissed because she's my friend and I'm like, why do you think it was because this one dude who um
Had a crush on her was like trying to separate her from us from our friend group
He was a shitty dude
Um
And so and then she said afterwards like she's like it kind of freaked me out
Then I'm like, sorry. Well, like
You didn't have to
The way you approached it. The way you spoke to me was disrespectful. So I'm gonna disrespect you back, you know
If you came out to be like, hey somebody told me that you said something negative about me
Then I'm gonna be like, what? I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. I'm the type of person that like if I hear
Someone
saying something negative
About me or some other. Oh, look at you cleaning in me. Um, me or another person
I like immediately go to nip it in the butt because I'm like we're adults
Fuck it out. Like we're not fucking doing this. It's fucking stupid
We'll be reversal. Yeah, it's part of how wrestling isn't gay. Yeah
Uh, I need gold for that. All right, I'm gonna make another
Another oh, I don't have money
I
What will give me a lot of my gold? Oh, yeah, but
Should go fishing this fishing would get me stuff
It's also cotton because I don't need cotton either
Nope didn't even mean to catch him
I'm desperate need of that wood
Game is like for a moment
Look at me
Oh hi, what's up?
Uh, sure
Yeah, I'll always I'm sorry my cat's food is going off. I
I'll always stand my ground and
If I don't agree with something I will speak my mind
I'm not gonna really bother with these. Oh, they're a cop profiliac like some of you guys
They gain faith when they fall ill while they're about to fall ill. So I'm supposed to be sickly apparently
Then I can literally just
Tell them
Pass out on the ground that's so funny
Yeah, I think like I was
When I was younger I was very much a push over
And I my mom always said that I was a follower and I wasn't a leader
um
Because I would have really bad friends that would like
Take my money and I'd be like, yeah, it's fine or just like I just wouldn't be able to stand it for myself and then
Growing up. I just eventually learned to do so really like working at um
The retail store was a
Very big dose of reality for me because after growing up so sheltered
Um and like
Experiencing the real world with people and like
The drama and all that other shit and I'm like wait a second like I don't even
I don't have to I don't have to have this reaction. I don't have to act this way
I don't have to do this. I don't have to do that. I don't have and I did it was like
Just releasing all that shit and just being like, oh
Wow, and this like the stress off my shoulders
It was very nice. Um, I should probably refine some stuff
Good night. Good night
I have bushes and machines to see. Yeah, of course. Good night. Yeah, that's nine
Probably gonna go see if I can kill the cat and I'll probably go to bed myself
See, can I upgrade? No, I need to wait for that. Oh, you mean the fucking scarecrow
How am I supposed to how am I supposed to fit these motherfuckers?
How much space does he take up? He takes up one
Um
Then I could
Actually
I'm gonna kind of fuck myself but just
Get rid of that
Uh
What we guys are stinking up the place
Perfect
And
Ten of that
That's my cat's food. Take forever. I don't want to go off
Only do the first one
Can I take you a while brother?
Don't know their stone place. I really like I don't usually like like, um
Um
Like management stuff, but I really like
I didn't miss game for some reason. I need money
I still don't have money
I
Need a burp to drop the lurkers. Yeah, no, I know I was gonna be like pretty chill today. So I'm not
Don't worry about that stuff
Just chill kind of just want to like
Hang out, you don't have to talk
Zero I'm sending you out there. You're gonna get some meat. Don't die, please
It's pretty cool. Yeah, we was we were just vibing. We're just hanging out. We're chatting. We're having a good time
No need to rush. No need to be like
Oh
Nobody's talking. I'm content. Just spending time and hanging out with you guys to be honest with you
Like that's I think that's um
That's something
I've
realized I enjoy a lot about like some friendships that I've had is like being able to
Um kind of just hang out with someone and not have to say a word
Like when you just can be comfortable in the silence
Um in a friendship it's a very
Little thing, you know
Oh now we're all right, we're doing pretty well
Friendly fire
Yeah, you just have me in the background as I talk about nothing
Okay, do I have an I'm not gonna actually worry too much about the beds
Um
I'm really just trying I'm just waiting on those stones
I
Hurry up
Hurry up
Do I have enough yet because I want to make the uh
Farmer plot where they collect it so I don't have to worry about it

And then we're gonna
Milt
Oh
Fuck uh, I forgot that you have to upgrade
Okay, let me move that back never mind
Uh, we're just gonna move it back to where it was
And then we're gonna upgrade it
Companionable silence is a very far that's just a pretty way to say it. Companionable silence
Having a silence with this court call is always fun
I'm gonna fall asleep in a discord call
Can't imagine it's like to be two with an audience. I don't want to touch for this stick
Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't I don't really get that like why do you do what you do if you don't like your audience
It's always confused me. You're like, oh, I hate my fan base
And like when people say like chat reflects streamer, it's really true you
if you
cultivate
A certain fan bait like if you cultivate or have this sort of certain personality
You're gonna why are you guys fighting? Um
It's gonna reflect on chat and chat's gonna act a certain way
so it only makes sense to
you know
Be the type of person you want to
track
your streams
Or is there a way to like upgrade it so like I don't have to go in collection all the time
Oh so much
I need cauliflower seasoning
I
Say where as cool as you I'm not saying none of that don't get it twisted
I like I want to that's my catchphrase as a
sheebie
Don't get it twisted because I'm wearing shabari ropes
That's why I say it so much because I want it to be my thing. It's every every vtuber has like a phrase
I want that to be my phrase my soon my soon dere
Girlfail dom phrase

Yeah, it said it was
Copyright free royalty free music and it linked to where they got it from that. I was like, I'm like, what the fuck you lied to me
Doesn't matter
I'm not really like super hyper focused on monetization. Although I'm it's mostly just like it's a
As someone who's been a v another vtuber, are you just a content creator on youtube in general?
I've never been able to get monetized
Like or just like be able to be part of the partner product like so that's like it's the title
That's important to me. It's not like the actual like being monetized
But because I'll be like it's just it's a milestone for me because I've never
I've gotten that before
Like the fact that I think
Like I'm like I'm 10k away from 100k views on my channel
Like that just like it literally makes me want to cry because I'm just like holy shit
I never ever thought I would
get
That sort of attention in any way shape or form
Ooh
So it's just really cool to see the fruits of my labor
No, yeah, I appreciate it. Yeah, it's like I also just want the fucking emotes like
Sucks that they don't have anime emotes though

There's like
There's one emo. I like
I know I fucking like me on this channel
And if you ever followed me, I feel I had a really popular emo that was just like me crying
And I used to always be like what the fuck is going on and so I want to get a what the fuck is going on
I also just might get like different stylized emotes
Uh, let's get this wood two times coins
I can just go straight. I might just go straight. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm willing right now

Girlfail dom harp
That you guys look want to watch me and shit. It's really cool
Um, thank you for supporting the girls. Oh, perfect more food. I'm so excited
Ah
Oh, I think you need a different job
Um, but
This feels surreal to be here
And I just can't wait for what
Like
Well, what would be like in like a month?
I'm actually like really nervous about like collabs with other companies because again, I used to like watch them and now
I get to just like hang out with them
Um, and I'm also nervous that like people won't want to hang out with us because
For content
But like I'm happy that like we have like the new girls and I have
some indie friends
Mercy died of old age. No, okay, we're gonna resurrect mercy. Oh wait. No, fuck. I don't have the resurrect thing
Um, we went with the funeral. We'll have a nice funeral for mercy
Unless she gets resurrected
Uh, I kind of like what I have so much of that
Mercy was a hag
Well, you won't see a collab with any superstitious little company for sure
Well, yeah, because that'll be on them. It's up to them like like I can't
Like you probably why don't there's so many stuff here with him. I've seen him like five times
Sorry, I need meat from your followers. Thank you. Also, you should stop bagging up your people. It's kind of fucking weird
um
It's like I can be say so if I want to like
The only thing that's difficult for me
Is like maybe not swearing
But like oh hell I literally that is like glitched. Um
I
Like I can do that
It wouldn't be difficult and then I would just like probably get a fucking different outfit
But like I also don't want to change
Who I am. Oh, I was looking at chat. Um
For somebody just to like me
And like it's mostly as I run into that it's mostly for the um other girls
Like I just I just want us to be successful and I want to go to be happy
My measure success by happiness
Damn, this is actually a kind of cracked thing
Oh, what the fuck I'm like, please don't tell me if I'm glitched
I
Don't be okay. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly
