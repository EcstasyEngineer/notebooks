00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:56,120
You know, you know what I forgot to do? I forgot to actually copy and paste the Fuji Tech model in

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was like, okay, but you will see amazing this and just a moment and just mere moments you will witness the majesty that

8
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,680
Tape it to my boobs, that's a good idea actually

9
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,480
There you go, I'll put one on each tit

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,040
But look hold on let me just throw this off to the side real quick look at the amazingness

11
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
That Toma did today look

12
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,160
We were just in call hanging out in Chattin

13
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,480
And I'm like I'm like oh my come my my

My model is really lagging while trying to run the game. She's like I got you

And I was like I'm about to draw myself as a like a little like stick figure puppet thing

16
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,000
She's like bet and then she's like no I got you and then I

17
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,760
watched an amazement as she quickly whipped me up into a

18
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,640

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:14,080

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,280
She loves watching cartoons. She loves playing games

24
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,520
With her audience. She is one of the most wholesome comfy streamers

25
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,560
I have ever met and I'm so thankful to call her my friend

26
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,000
Because she envisioned me in the most beautiful way my true form

27
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,680
Rise tarnish, so I'm gonna be over here

28
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,440
Let me make myself a little bit smaller so you can see my wonderful little hand holding me up

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,440
And a little eyebrows, I'm gonna put this put this helmet on my my booba

Thank you, I feel I feel I just feel so alive

36
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Are we I just feel

37
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,800
Like I'm my true self in this this form

38
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,520
Uh

39
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
I I showed off

40
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,960
my Muppet form in the discord and my

41
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,320
Management just responded with just five nights at Friday's music

42
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm protected where it counts, you know, I have the highest level of armor, you know, okay, I need to

43
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,600
Set things up a little bit more properly. Hold on. This is gonna be loud for you guys. Let me turn that down

44
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Okay

45
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:42,840
Oh my glorious day, I am so happy to be alive. I'm so glad to be here

46
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,640
I'm a fucking Muppet ladies and gentlemen

47
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,880
Um, but yes, I am a Muppet because this outlandering really taxes my pc

48
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,440
So I thought it would be a good idea. I was gonna whip up

49
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Um, a PNG batoma came in clutch

50
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,440
Um, we're going I don't know if I'm going to try to speed run

51
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,520
To get to the dlc. I'll be honest with you. I highly doubt that I can do that

52
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,280
So what I'm thinking and this has been a goal of mine

53
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Elden ring is near and dear to my heart

54
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,600
I think I should make Elden ring a running series and this will be the game the the souls like I beat on stream

55
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Maybe I don't know

56
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Honestly, I'm quite embarrassed to

57
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,360
Play this game because I'm not good at souls likes. I enjoy them a lot. I'm not good at them though

58
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
um

59
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
but

60
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,280
I love this game a lot like that's why I named one of my fucking cats after one of the characters

61
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
I was when I was

62
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,160
In such a dark place when this game came out and this game brought me back to the light

63
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,080
I I rose as tarnished. I became the Elden Lord

64
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,960
Actually, I became Lord of the frenzy flame in my ending that I you know beat the game in but it's whatever

65
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
um

66
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,800
I've seen the cart bot animations of elderly. I have not helped look that up

67
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:28,280
I remember pouring over the lore pouring over the builds because I'd never like played a game of scaling before like a all that stuff

68
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
And I realized how much I enjoyed it

69
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
um

70
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,280
I always like to the guidance of grace. Yes. I always used to like sing to myself

71
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,880
While playing elderly ring reach out and touch grace

72
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,000
Um, yes, I'm a muppet

73
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
But

74
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,120
Yeah, we'll try I want to try it would be cool to beat this again. I play

75
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm not like scrawny. I don't beat games in like a short amount of time

76
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,640
I take a very long time like she just like a hundred percented assassins created like two days. I I can't

77
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,880
I think when I played and beat the game I had like 200 out. No

78
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Was it 200 hours? I don't know

79
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,440
Because I like to explore

80
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,600
I know there's even so much more that I haven't even found yet and I've been all over the place

81
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,960
I'm debating whether or not to do some like cheesing in terms of like, um

82
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Getting extra runes and shit

83
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,720
Uh, or just like really going for it

84
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,160
Getting all the bells took you 200 out. Oh, you got all the bell. I did not bother with that

85
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,480
What is the shiba model? What do you mean? This is I don't look any different. I'm the same

86
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,640
Sorry, I need this so it's fine if you want to as well. I yeah, because normally, you know, I'd like go to caled

87
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,640
Kill that dragon that's already kind of half dead get the runes level up

88
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,680
Um, but I kind of just want to go on a little trip with you guys, you know

89
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,880
Just want to go on a little trip. I think I want to go on this adventure together

90
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,120
Wait, where did obs go? It just disappeared as I was talking

91
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,080
I'm wondering if I should eat something before I start

92
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,600
Episode of Muppets is this it's the banned one

93
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
It's

94
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Fun to pull the cradle

95
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,040
It's on pc. Yes. I have beat uh, so I've never played elden ring on pc. I've only played it on my playstation

96
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
um

97
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,680
Maybe wise if you're gonna go for a while, you know, yeah

98
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,760

You're such a speedy gal

105
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
uh

108
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,160
Understanding they'd be canceling and stuff like on us to be honest with you. I hate canceling and postponing things

109
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
um

110
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,880
Because like I'm someone who like I have to see things through

111
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Uh, but I was really sick yesterday

112
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,560
Was a bar. I'm still kind of nauseous today. I don't know if I have food poisoning or uh

113
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,600
My medication is like doing something to me or whatever

114
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,640
But I'm okay

115
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
In fact, I'm re-drinking some water repeatedly

116
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Do do do do

117
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,200
I'll first always yeah, I was like toma a messenger and I'm like girl

118
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,400
Uh, I might be only able to stream for like an hour because I don't feel good and she's just like no no get no

119
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
We could do this another time stop

120
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm like, okay. She's so good. She looks out for me

121
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,400
Um, and then I'm kind of happy she told me to just like get some rest and stuff because I literally after

122
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,440
I finished like messaging her. I literally just puked and then I passed out

123
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,320
No, I don't I don't know. I don't know if I got food poisoning again. Um

124
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
I'll make some peanut butter toast

125
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,160
It really sucked because I was really looking forward to the stream

126
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,200
And I think uh, some of you guys are like, it's probably stressed. You're probably right. It could be stressed too

127
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,560
Stress can definitely cause an upset stomach. Um, I always worry about rena. She is older

128
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,640
I'm like you every five but the kitties have been good

Was taking everybody's advice when I asked on my and it's my alt account about

Beef and not chicken. No, I did have chicken soup, but somebody had recommended. Um

143
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Oh my god

144
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Uh, Calda there is

145
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,600
Which is very tasty. I've had it before and I like how hearty it is

146
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,040
I like honestly really want to go to grocery shopping so I can make myself a nice

147
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,440

148
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
What is this sonic? Oh, oh

149
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,520
Oh my god

150
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,800
This could definitely be interpreted as a sonic. Oh, see. Holy crap

151
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,440
I was your build during the three fingers run. Uh, I was a faith build

152
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,360
um

153
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
I scaled with faith and

154
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,880
uh

155
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,640
I was I just really had the halo site the entire time like I farmed

156
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:02,200
Um that whole part of calid to get all the armor and the halo site in the sphere

157
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
um

158
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,880
And then I literally just spammed the fucking

159
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Halo

160
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Uh magic thing

161
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Why do they have to put rabbits in sonic? Why not? Why is twanish?

162
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Hardest boss in your opinion

163
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Uh, the tree sentinel done

164
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,520
I would say tree sentinel just because of like he's the first guy to run into you

165
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,440
But I'm trying to think of who the hardest person I thought was I think

166
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I remember

167
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,360
I was like losing my mind after redawn like I probably spent like so many hours. I think I spent like six hours

168
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,680
fighting redawn

169
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,800
But it was so satisfying when I finally fucking killed him

170
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,880
um

171
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,400
And this is again, it was my allen ring was kind of my true first

172
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,680
Soulslike from soft game that I ever played like I didn't I have I played sakuro. I played dark souls

173
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Uh, I can't remember if it was two or three

174
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,960
I was it two or I can't remember

175
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,760
But like I never played through the game because I didn't know how the game worked in terms of like, yes

176
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,160
It's hard. You're not supposed to just be able to beat things

177
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,800
um like in sakuro and in whatever dark soul games I played

178
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,440
I like was getting so upset because I thought I had to beat the first boss to continue like the first thing you run into

179
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Which is not the case

180
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,000
So I'd say like redawn was hardest because I I had never played the type of game before so it was mentally taxing

181
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
um

182
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,920
but

183
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
actually

184
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
The god skin

185
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Twins were pretty fucking annoying

186
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
They were actually really fucking annoying to deal with

187
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
I think of it

188
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
God I sold her in the beginning as hardest. Yeah

189
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I forgot to tweet. Why don't you tweet for me?

190
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,360
I bought the dlc. Yes, I did

191
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,480
You guys bought me the game and I said if you bought me the game I'd buy the dlc. So I bought it

192
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
It's my toaster

193
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
I think also

194
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,920
What I haven't been helping myself out is I've been eating a lot of spicy food, which I can't handle that well

195
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
But I eat it anyways

196
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,080
And I think my body has just been rejecting me because I haven't been doing that

197
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,760
Everybody's like stop your white jeans cannot handle this much spice

198
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Let's stop to it immediately

199
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Our life will be forfeit

200
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I

201
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm buttering my toe. Wait, this has mold on it

202
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,480
Wait, but I ate toast the other day. I just bought this toast

203
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:17,240
Oh, no, is that why I've been sick because I've been eating fucking moldy bread. Are you fucking kidding me right now?

204
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,600
Well, so much for I literally just bought this bread. Are you fucking kidding me?

205
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,680
How did this get fucking moldy? Holy shit, that's bad

206
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Okay, well

207
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Never mind

208
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
So much for that

209
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Uh

210
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Well

211
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Yeah, toast bread is it? No, it's like it was my normal bread like it's normal bread

212
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,120
I just bought it like a couple days ago and I ate some the other night and I'm wondering why

213
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,520
If that's what's made me sick if you guys I made some in the dark with my glasses off

214
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
So I definitely didn't see it

215
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Okay

216
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,560
That's why am I such a failure

217
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,280
Yo favorite girl failure miss she be caught in the bomb

218
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,440
Time to order that pizza. I know I'm like

219
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I'm debating

220
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,280
I'm debating whether I have to order something now

221
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,440
I need to go I just need to go grocery shopping. I that's what I need to do on my day off. I need to go grocery shopping

222
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,120
Boomi, what are you doing? I'm trying to steal stuff. Don't look at me like that

223
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Yeah, why are you purring?

224
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:10,600
Okay, it doesn't matter. I have rice cakes

225
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Holy rice cakes

226
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
I can't believe they were so moldy

227
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,560
I feel sorry for that. I'm so I'm so mad

228
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
I put some rice cakes

229
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
some peanut butter over rice cakes

230
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
And then we'll lunch and have a chat

231
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,120
I'm sorry. I can't see chat because I'm like across my kitchen in the other room. What are you doing?

232
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
I mean, what's up?

233
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Hello, can you move mister?

234
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Who?

235
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,320
Boomi just likes to be underfoot as cats often are

236
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
He is sitting crittily to the side

237
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,480
And then I don't know where we're going. She probably went to the team

238
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,880
But I hope you guys are having a good day today

239
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm very excited to play Ellen ring. I love Ellen ring so much

240
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Oh, so so much. I can't because I know that the game is so big. I know there's so much

241
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,280
I don't even know about even though I felt like several hours and hundred hours into it

242
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,520
And I can't wait for you guys to show me things

243
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Um

244
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
You so for one thing I will say

245
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
You guys don't have the backseat

246
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,800
I played the game if I need help I'll ask for help

247
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Um

248
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,080
But yeah, like and yeah, also when you guys in since you guys like some of you want to play

249
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
I don't know how that will work

250
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,520
Like don't we have I don't know if we have to be like friends on steam and stuff and I can't do that

251
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
Um

252
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Okay, I got that

253
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
I also have some corn bread

254
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Let me get some corn bread

255
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,440
I think I also have like one little chicken noodle soup can so I could have that for dinner

256
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
This veal or just of course bread perhaps

257
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,400
That's why I don't buy bread from this or they don't throw at the bread that's used

258
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,360
Maybe I think that's why because I'm like I just bought this decision. I have not gone bad so soon

259
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Madam you have to press new game

260
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Yeah, no duh. Why are you?

261
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Oh, you're being fucking cheeky. I see you

262
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,040
Uses a password system in game. Oh, okay

263
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,120
There's the same pattern. Oh, okay, that's good to know

264
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,400
Wait is my stream like super laggy again like before

265
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Let me see

266
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,720
Why is it that when I did my other stream it automatically

267
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Put it as

268
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,960
High latency and not low latency, but now it's fine make that make sense

269
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Yeah, yeah, it's it's very it's very fun. It's fast. It's good. I'm gonna

270
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Do this that looks fine

271
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
barely visible

272
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,360
It's still visible even if I put it at zero so I'll just

273
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Keep it to what it was before

274
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
super high

275
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,240
So I can see everything. I'm just about at five to be honest with you because I am fucking blind

276
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,800
Yeah, I literally only got it like three days ago the bread

277
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
I

278
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Should be fine

279
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,000
Oh, okay interesting. So last time I was a confessor

280
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
So I'm usually someone who does like

281
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,600
One sword and then other hands

282
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Magic

283
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,160
I did I did do kind of a faith arcane bill last time because I used a lot of dragon stuff

284
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,280
And I'm debating whether or not

285
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
To

286
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,560
I just think this is funny because it's like the male and the female and the male and the female look exactly the same in the prisoner one

287
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,640
Spell bleed. Yeah, like I usually so I had like the halo scythe

288
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And then I also

289
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Would just use like arcane magic

290
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,720
um

291
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,240
And then I would also because I also had the black knife and I would abuse the fuck out of the black knife

292
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I never even had to use like

293
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,360
I would literally just mimic tear and the mimic tear would distract and I would just spam the black knife

294
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Uh special thing

295
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Summarize the easiest one to start I might do that

296
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Liza p has been t- yeah, yeah

297
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,160
I agree with you. Liza p was really fun. I have to I ended up beating that off stream. So that was good

298
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,480
Mimic is a true lord. Imagine there was a plot twist

299
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,680
And like the mimic goes evil. That'd be a cool DLC crunch. I'm eating my rice cake

300
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,800
I kind of want to scale with magic a little bit better

301
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Right

302
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:42,760
I might do the profit

303
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,760
Remember for one build I did like dual wielding daggers and that was the stupidest thing ever did

304
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,660
Because I just didn't have good daggers. I can't remember the ones I used

305
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Oh

306
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Thank you, Anonymous for new bread

307
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Come get this bread

308
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm like debating whether or not retch

309
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
It's so funny

310
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Yeah, I can't even more moldy bread

311
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,000
What up what bill did strani go for

312
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,000
Wanting if I should do the no prisoners more intelligence

313
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,560
again, I

314
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,960
like the confessor because I do feel like it's

315
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,720
Easy and well-rounded, but I kind of want to do something else this run

316
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
I might go profit I'm wondering if

317
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,920
I'm like should I do something different because I know faith in the arcade and then profit would be good for that

318
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,600
Because I remember when I first played I just picked anyone. I'm like this looks good

319
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,120
Like I didn't do like a mad like I didn't do an intelligence build. I know I've never done an intelligence build

320
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,560
Although I know you can be absolutely cracked with an intelligent intelligence build

321
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,240
Yeah, you know what I might I might go with a stroller drew them because they still

322
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Like they still are pretty good

323
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
A prisoner maybe

324
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Prisoner face okay

325
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I

326
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,960
Honestly, I think I prefer the prisoner

327
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,600
Because they have high intelligence. They have good faith in arcane, but they also are level nine and have yeah

328
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go a prisoner

329
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,840
Yeah, magic glimb blade is a good spell. I think I'll do that

330
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Uh B

331
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
My titties are out

332
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,480
I'm telling the space fun to go spellcasting. I know I've never done full spellcasting

333
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,000
I've only usually done like with the weapons, but I also but I like smashing things like I like stabbing things

00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,800
She's not that bad. I'm looking pretty target here

507
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,760

508
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,720

509
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,520
Weird the nose is I don't like I don't know why I can't give her like that like I don't know why this is here

510
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760

Oh

514
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,200
The braids make more more sense because they're although pony tails

515
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
I'll do braids

516
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,080
Give myself the Rachel doles out look

517
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:28,280
I didn't are these new hairstyles. I don't remember this many hairstyles before I'll do braids

518
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,200
I'm not gonna smash which is the sound

519
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,720
All right, you gotta give me so myself the blonde hair my hair is

520
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,480
Kind of orangey almost I'm not a ginger like emmy though. That would be terrible

521
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,640
Actually, I should do the hair color

522
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
This

523
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,920
In my wait, no that won't work

524
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,880
Uh, we don't have any white hairs in this house

525
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,800
Fuck I just have to make myself blonde

526
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,800
Temporary colors

527
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,960
Give myself beautiful white hair

528
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,880
I love me and tomahawk are talking about how we love like the white hair with dark skin

529
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,560
Trope, it's so good. Um, that looks like fucking raggedy in here

530
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,560
Yeah, I'll do a little bit of that am I looking at my mup itself

531
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,920

533
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Kind of liking it, but we won't we won't

534
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,040
It's her it's she it's me this looks so fucking ugly. I'm kind of happy

535
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,000
I won't ever be able to see her face. Jesus Christ

536
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Jesus Christ. She is ugly

537
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,360
Oh

538
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Is there

539
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,040
Why can I only be a dude

540
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
I should have done the young face

541
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,680
That made myself just older eyebrows we're not going to match hair

542
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,720
We'll make them darker

543
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:34,600
How does it really matter brow let's change the brow

544
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
No brows

545
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,960
Like me a little bit of you know, she plucks she plucks her eyebrows

546
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,200
She just makes her look really sad

547
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,120
My eyebrows are normally really thin as you can see in my model

548
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
So I might do a little thin brow

549
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:04,120
Facial hair, uh, I think I should give myself. Oh god

550
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,080
Never mind. I can't even stand to look at that eyelashes

551
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,040
I can't

552
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,720
I have eyelashes. Am I wearing makeup too? I feel like I am wearing makeup

553
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,040
Eyelashes three. Oh no, we want to lift it we want them lifted

554
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Eyes

555
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,040
My eyes are orange red

556
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,320
Can I do

557
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,160

558
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,160
red

559
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,160
I don't know what that means

560
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,240
I should make this darker

561
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,960
That looks about yeah, that looks perfect actually

562
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,640
I don't know what that means. I'll just keep it like that. Um eye position. I can change my eye position

563
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:03,480
Skin features pores. Why do I have so many pores? No, no, my skin isn't that bad

564
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,760
Skin luster

565
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Oh

566
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,120

567
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,440

568
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,480

Eyeliner color eye shadow. Why am I wearing eye shadow?

575
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,320

578
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,520

There's a vibrant. Oh, I'm looking at my lips

580
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,000
I was supposed to have lipstick, but I don't

581
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,680
In my model they just yeeted out the window and gave it to a zura instead

582
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:29,240
Let's do a little bit lighter. Yeah, that's better. I'm so I'm looking so cute

583
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,600
Just don't look from any other angle besides straight on because holy shit

00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,560

585
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
And not the good kind

00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,160
Yeah, zura has like a little like bottom lip lipstick

587
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,480

It looks kind of sick

592
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:28,520
I was like I always get confused when I see the script in elven ring and then the script and lord of the rings because they look so similar to elvish

593
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,480
Just on like glancing

594
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
This makes my face like dirty looks like I have a unibrow I just wanted freckles

595
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,680
Just give myself a knot. Why do I need a bendy that doesn't make any sense?

596
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,480
Oh

597
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,480

598
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,120

599
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,520
Oh, that kind of looks kind of sick. I'm not gonna lie to you

600
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,520
I got like fucking clawed across the face when I was a wee rabbit

601
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,480

00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,440
Whichever looks the best from the side give it to me

606
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
That looks better

607
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,440

00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,200
So my mom would just joke and she's like, oh, yeah, it's playing your dress up game

I remember staring at this image of right card for like the longest fucking time and being really confused

657
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,640
A war from which no lord arose

658
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,160

01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,960
Nope, it's it still wants to do that. Okay. Well, we'll figure it out. That's not it. That's not it

Oh yippie

702
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:58,120
What I missed when I was playing lies of pee is that I can fucking jump

703
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,720
Couldn't jump before you can't jump in lies of pee. It's a fucking travesty

704
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,720
Am I supposed I'm not gonna read these I don't really care right now

705

Um

707
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,960
Kind of wish there was a blood stain there because I remember the first time I played I walked off

708
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,280
Uh, I feel so good to be playing this game again. I'm not gonna lie to you

709
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,520
How do I run? There you go again. I have to remember how to fucking play

710
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:54,280
Okay, yeah, this doesn't have as much this has minuscule input lag compared to um

711
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,800

714
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,560

01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,400

There was another grace near here somewhere. I know

1203
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,520
Dragons over there

1204
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,120

The box on the desk so booby can have his pets

1265
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:08,380
You know booby isn't really like a snugly cat. He'll like hang out with you for only like the littlest bit of time

1266
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:13,980
He likes headpats and chin scratches other if he gets um

1267
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:20,300
It's almost like he's like fucking like ocd or something because if you pet his body he like licks it immediately afterwards

1268
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:30,460
Now fia is coming to take a peek she's sniffing booby in the box you guys are so cute

1309
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:35,500
Yeah, I tell you don't use your claws when trying to jump up on my lap and then you're here

1310
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:38,460
Up to my chair

1311
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:43,820
You're looking at boomi like help me, but he can't do anything. He has a half-hands or valued so he should let me help you

1312
02:07:46,220 --> 02:07:48,220
Oh

1313
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:53,740
No, her cat claw. It's her claw. She like so my chair

1314
02:07:54,460 --> 02:08:00,460
She like sometimes Fia's weird. She doesn't just like jump on my lap. She has to haul herself up

1315
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:03,340
to get to my lap

1316
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:06,140
And um

1317
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:09,500
She'll pull herself up and then she'll dig her claws into my cushiony chair

1318
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:13,340
And there's also like so she's stuck on it

1319
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:22,860
And she's trying to maneuver around right now and get out and I'm trying to help her but she's whining about it

1320
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:28,220
Okay, are you ready? This is a team effort

1321
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:34,140
You don't move your paw

1322
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:37,980
You did it. Yay. Good job Fia

1323
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:40,700
Can I have a hug?

1324
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:43,020
Yeah, it's huggie time

1325
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:47,900
My little girl. That's my little girl getting stuck on stone. Yeah

1326
02:08:57,740 --> 02:09:00,220
Fia's gonna keep meowing if you don't feed her

1327
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:03,740
She's fine

1328
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:06,140
Her food already went off today

1329
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:12,140
Yeah, went off three hours ago. She just ate and then it'll go off in another couple hours

1330
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:17,820
They are so spoiled they have an automatic feeder and they have a problem

1331
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:22,140
And they have so many toys and so many cat trees

1332
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:28,540
People come in my mom came over and she's like, yeah, this definitely looks like cats live here

1333
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:35,660
I'm like it's a little cat haven if I could I'd build them that thing where you kind of like

1334
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:39,340
Have them

1335
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:40,540
um

1336
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:44,060
Walk across your walls and stuff like little shelves

1337
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:53,260
I check it on me since she knew I was sick

1338
02:09:57,660 --> 02:09:59,660
It's the treats they get lots of treats

1339
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:13,500
Hmm

1340
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:19,260
Let me just focus on oh fuck

1341
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:27,820
Let me focus on just talking to Ronnie first before I try to go kill people for for rooms

1342
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:38,460
Wait

1343
02:10:40,540 --> 02:10:42,540
I

1344
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:52,540
So used to play as a pee where you have to go to the

1345
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:55,740
site in order to transfer

1346
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:01,900
Yeah, what's up with your little hot doll body

1347
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:07,820
Mother I mean mother. I mean mother. I am sorry

1348
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:10,780
I don't

1349
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:20,780
I like how she sounds Jamaican

1350
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:27,500
She's like a British Jamaican accent

1351
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:35,500
I heard about the tarnished that

1352
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:45,740
She sounds like I don't know why but Ronnie reminds me of

1353
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:55,500
Uh, Calypso from uh Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't know why she's Welsh. Oh

1354
02:11:57,260 --> 02:11:59,260
Oh

1355
02:12:00,060 --> 02:12:02,060
I

1356
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:07,180
No way

1357
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:14,300
Okay, the spirits will obey thine command but whatever you say, honey, um

1358
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:22,300
Let me just

1359
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:24,300

02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:31,820
That's cool. I'm just gonna try to I can't pick up your skirt. Do you have how many legs you got under there?

1361
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:35,580
You got oh, that's me

1362
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:42,460
Oh, wait, hold on. Hold on somebody put a thing in you. So that's kind of annoying and it wasn't my thing

1363
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:50,860
Don't worry about it. Hold on. I like your shoes. They're very they're a choice. Their hat's quite cute. Um

1364
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:54,700
Yeah

1365
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:59,180
Actually, we will you'll become my wife

1366
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:11,980
Do you ever use your hands to hold up your boobs as a bra? Oh, bye

1367
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:18,700
I'm staring at her hands. Fuck fucked it up. Fucked it up. Stupid stupid stupid

1368
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:20,940
Oh

1369
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:23,980
That's a vision of Trump

1370
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:29,900
I think they had the same idea as me trying to look up her skirt. All right

1371
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:34,860
Here's the plan

1372
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:38,060
I don't have one

1373
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:46,620
Uh first priority

1374
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:55,020
I don't feel like going all the way over there. Just yeah, maybe

1375
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:59,980
I'm not really worried about going over here because

1376
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:06,860
Unless I need something from there. I'm not gonna go over there the weeping peninsula. Um

1377
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:10,860
I believe the other map is over here

1378
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:17,740
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know

1379
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:22,700
And I could yeah, and then I gotta go up

1380
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:30,300
And then yes, I do need to don't I need to kill him to well, I could go the cheatzy doodle way

1381
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:34,700
To get to

1382
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:36,700
What's it called?

1383
02:14:36,700 --> 02:14:41,180
I don't have to fight him to go through there and I would honestly rather not

1384
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:44,700
I'd rather take the road around

1385
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,260
The hills

1386
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:49,260
To do that, but I forget how to do that

1387
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:53,740
I like that. I remember like important things and then I just don't remember how to enact them

1388
02:14:58,060 --> 02:15:00,060
Under psychic yeah, I need to do that

1389
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:03,260
Uh

1390
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:09,100
No, I'm not I'm not summoning anybody summoning anyone right yet just yet. Um

1391
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:12,860
We ride and period wife gone

1392
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:21,020
Yeah, weeping is good for far. I did farm a lot in the weeping peninsula. I recall

1393
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:24,300
Um

1394
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:32,940
Sorry, it's moving my obs window so I can see it better

1395
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:43,340
Okay, uh, I believe there's a map fuck. Why does it keep doing that?

1396
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:46,940
There's a map

1397
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:48,940
Somewhere in this direction

1398
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:55,500
So I will go over there. We ride at dawn except it's nighttime

1399
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:06,780
I love running simulator

1400
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:10,060
It's my favorite

1401
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:17,180
Riding horse riding simulator after a big jar lad quest you can't forget. Oh, fuck you're right. I gotta do a lot of shit. Ah

1402
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,300
There's important quests I need to do

1403
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:26,460
Because I need to get the wonder psychic it's physics physics psychic. I forget where that is

1404
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:34,940
We ride at night, um

1405
02:16:35,660 --> 02:16:36,860
Um

1406
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:41,980
Yeah, I need to talk to blive. I need to talk to in my home boy blive at some point

1407
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:45,740
Um

1408
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:51,900
Damn, there's so much to fucking do in this game. Why am I oh my I have bonus runes right now

1409
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:54,780
Um

1410
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:57,660
Gotta do a lot of stuff

1411
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:02,860
A lot of stuff. Let me just focus on maps. I think maps

1412
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:07,660
Yeah, the maps right over here. That's what it is. Let me do that. Fuck you

1413
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:11,980
I wish we needed to lead it. It would just switch to that

1414
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,540
To one instead of two

1415
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:17,740
All right, let's fucking do it focusing on the maps and then we'll know our way around

1416
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:23,660
Honestly, when I labeled it when I get all the maps, I'll be able to know where the fuck I'm going and have a bigger better plan

1417
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:30,780
Let me not jump off cliffs

1418
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:39,660
Um, I'm debating whether or not to just speedrun

1419
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:46,380
Because again, I've played the game before I've beaten the game before

1420
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:50,220
I'm I am very tempted just to focus on a build

1421
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:55,100
And worry about defeating uh, radon and moog

1422
02:17:57,020 --> 02:17:59,020
Damn why the maps are fucking far? Oh

1423
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:05,500
Shit, oh, oh shit. I have to go over the bridge. Let's see night rider

1424
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:17,900
I could have teleported but you know, I prefer the scenic rope, you know scenic ropes nice. Oh fuck me bro. No

1425
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:21,260
Get away. Get away. Get away

1426
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:27,420
I'm not really a speedrunner to be honest with you. I don't I don't speedrun anything

1427
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:36,220
Get off my butt. Oh shit. I got it. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh, we're fine

1428
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:46,780
I'm kind of wishing that I played a little bit before like on my ps5 before I started over here just so I can

1429
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:49,340
Have more of my bearings

1430
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:53,500
Hello mouse thing

1439
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:32,060
I'm so new to this

1440
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:35,020
This is when you become a muppet. I've always been a muppet. I don't know what you're talking about

1441
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:52,860

Especially because I have a window behind it. So it's like kind of fucking me up. Okay

1446
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:26,540
Perfect, perfect

1471
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:26,700
or purring

1472
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:28,700

1479
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:06,300

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to like attack you

1485
02:24:34,540 --> 02:24:38,380
How do you know that it'll be glad if you're I got grafted

1486
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:45,260
Yeah, I'll kill you

1487
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:49,740
What the fuck are you

1488
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:52,620
On this

1489
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:56,140
What are you talking about

1490
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:01,660
Oh, okay

1491
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:12,220
Honestly, some of the shit the dialogue in this game is so fucking dark

1492
02:25:14,620 --> 02:25:16,620
Yeah, I can do that for you

1493
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:22,940
Oh

1494
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:30,940
Me met it where she's like, oh, I get you tiny pellet golf out my face

1495
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:34,940
The jellyfish carried you in your first playthrough. That's adorable

1496
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:40,780
I was thinking about when she tried to smack her oh awkward

1497
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:48,540
I think I know it's kind of I saw that uh, they're considering doing a

1498
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:53,900
Uh unofficial anime adaptation of this and weirdly enough

1499
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:58,620
Weirdly enough

1500
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:02,540
I would prefer a live action adaptation

1501
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:06,620
I don't know why

1502
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:09,580
It would be a lot

1503
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:12,540
Of CGI

1504
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:17,580
And it would definitely probably be easy, but I don't know what I would prefer a live action

1505
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:19,740
I don't know if it's just me

1506
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:22,380
I think

1507
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:26,540
I don't know. Maybe I'm just hankering for a new fantasy thing to watch

1508
02:26:27,900 --> 02:26:29,900
Uh, where am I going?

1509
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:33,980
All right, I'm going to the cruel

1510
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:37,420
Torrent to me

1511
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:44,380
Guys, I think I'm gonna order pizza. What do you think?

1512
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:48,620
It's because you guys gave me the pizza stuff

1513
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:56,140
Oh, yeah, there's all the fucking bloody fingers. I got a fucking fight. Jesus Christ, bro

02:26:56,860 --> 02:26:58,860

Feel like she's the one who tells me where to go because you go along the edge to get to

1518
02:27:20,940 --> 02:27:22,940
Hey

02:27:36,380 --> 02:27:38,380
I'm gonna just take a cheese pizza

1522
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:43,580
Yeah, definitely a series wouldn't want it to be a movie

1523
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:52,300
Your fingers give me your fingers. I want to last my maidenhood with your two fingers

1524
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:54,940
Even tight

1525
02:27:55,500 --> 02:27:57,500
And reunites the half

1526
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:58,780
presents

1527
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:00,780
at the grand lift

1528
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:03,820
Pete's funds cleared pizza funds cleared ladies and gentlemen

1529
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:14,860
That's crazy, um

1530
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:17,500
Damn, that's crazy. Anyways

1531
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:20,460
I'm

1532
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:23,500
Somebody put something oh, they just put something there

1533
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:30,300
Hey

1534
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:35,820
Oh, you fucking died. Why did you die? Oh

1535
02:28:37,660 --> 02:28:40,700
They jumped off that side. Oh, it's funny

1536
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:42,700
I

1537
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:48,460
Rump ahead

1538
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:51,260
Oh hitting path

1539
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:56,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you get a hitting path and all that I'm gonna fall off or something because I can't see properly

1540
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:04,700
It's this isn't it

1541
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:12,380
Because I can totally circumvent

1542
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:22,140
How do I do it though? There's a way to get along the edge and I thought it was

1543
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:37,100
No

1544
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:41,980
I was turning around. Okay, well

1545
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:49,180
Let's go get our shit. Well, that's not the way

1546
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:57,840
At least I wasn't far. Oh, yes gravity the final boss

1547
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:00,480
I

1548
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:07,680
Have to remember

1549
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:14,240
Fuck not how to fuck. Um, I have to remember. Is it up around here?

1550
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:17,520
That's why I fucking know it

1551
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:21,600
Right, oh don't about it

1552
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:26,960
Oh don't about it. Oh don't about it. I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking

1553
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,840
I'm funkin

1554
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,200
Well, let's oh my god, I almost did it again

1555
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:41,920
Let's not go that way. Let's not let's not do it that way. Let me go get my rune since

1556
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:47,120
I usually normally wouldn't give a shit and I'll just leave them but because I'm such a low level every rune counts

1557
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:54,160
Gravity zone defeated. I'm gonna be like this one guy and just totally running a circle off

1558
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:00,080
Oh

1559
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:06,400
Wait, I kind of should kill you. Oh, I'm kind of

1560
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:12,580
Well, that's awkward anyways

1561
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:24,080
Dismount dismount. Yeah, no fucking shit, dude

1562
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:28,400
I'm a little slow in the head. Relax, bro

1563
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:41,440
And do we do we wait you can't get back up from here

1564
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:52,960
If you can't get back up from here that might mean something what did you do?

1565
02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:56,160
I didn't mean to pick that up, but it's fine

1566
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:08,480
Did you fall off? Oh right there. That's where you fell off

1567
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:14,880
Cliff ahead. Oh, I would have who would have thunk to be honest

1568
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:25,600
Where is oh found it found it found it found the hidden path ha ha ha ha found the hidden path

1569
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:29,360
My ear itches

1570
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:36,160
Beware wolves. Okay, hold on. Let me let me do something. Let me do something real quick

1571
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:48,400
I have played the game

1572
02:32:53,360 --> 02:33:06,400
Yes, I played the game before I am doing a faith intel build

1573
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:08,400
I

1574
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:17,120
Will ask for help when I need it cunt

1575
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:28,320
Wow, isn't that fabulous

1576
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:32,640
Put this like I just had this constantly scrolling

1577
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,600
It was center of my screen

1578
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:38,800
How about that?

1579
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:41,840
It's a smaller

1580
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:44,400
Accelerate it too big. What the fuck?

1581
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:48,080
Why did it flip? Oh, what happened?

1582
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:52,080
Oh, I didn't know I could do that

1583
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:05,040
Oh

1584
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:19,200
There you go

1585
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Perfect Wow

1586
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:33,520
Perfect golden upside down to establish dominance

1587
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:43,680
For the stupid fucking zit in my ear

1588
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,320

1589
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:48,320
Somebody come pop it with their mouth. How about that?

1590
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:51,280
Back to you just be gone. It's not even back seating

1591
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:56,960
It's just people like being like hey like they're trying to like warn me or like tell me like like hint at something

1592
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:59,840
Which is like what you should do if you're going to do anything

1593
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:04,960
Like if you're gonna like you can give a hint, you know, if the backseat which is which I appreciate

1594
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:09,440
But I'm like I already know I already know that wolves are gonna fucking fall from the sky and howl and be like

1595
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:11,920
And try to kill me

1596
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:13,920
I already know all this shit

1597
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:19,040
I just have a bad memory of when things happen

1598
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:26,480
Oh, this little guy's coming with me. Hi. Oh my god, you're so sweet. Don't fall off

1599
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:32,480
Hey puppies. Hi. Sorry. Hold on. Um, I'll see you in a bit

1600
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:36,240
Um, I'm trying to just do stuff

1601
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:39,680
Hugging the fucking wall

1602
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:42,560
Hi other puppies

1603
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:46,960
Same bro

02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:52,720
Throw me to the wolves and I'll come back leader of the pack and pregnant

1605
02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:03,120
Be dee dee dee. I kind of sworn there's a white wolf there though. Oh my god, where am I wait? What's that?

1606
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:06,080
Let me grab this shit. I was crystal but I don't really care

1607
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:14,960
How convenient liarnia, that's what it's called

1608
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:22,480
I found this path on accident, I believe

1609
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:26,080
Omg she be I love you. Please put your hand to me

1610
02:36:30,560 --> 02:36:35,760
Do wolves try to regularly try to ambush you they always they just they just smell my heat because I'm a rabbit

1611
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,760
I'm constantly in heat, you know

1612
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:41,120
It's funny saying this is a Muppet

1613
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:47,120
And they always they just try to they just try to get me they just try to come for me and you know, I have to tell them to

1614
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:48,720
Chill out, you know

1615
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:50,720
All right, where's the map for the

I'm the map. I'm the map. I'm the map

1617
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:04,240
All the way down there. Fuck me brother. I forget how to do shit. Okay

1618
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:09,520
Whoopsies I forgot how to get down

1619
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:16,800
I can jump right I can just jump off

1620
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:18,800
Stupid

1621
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:26,320
I wish torrent could fly

1622
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:31,360
I wish I could drop a water bucket like it's minecraft

1623
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:38,720
I could I had to go down that way. Don't I guess I do. Hello baddies. Excuse me baddies. Sorry. Sorry

1624
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:44,240
Uh, let me go into this chat because there's something that I need here

1625
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:49,120
I

1626
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:51,360
Just like gritty

1627
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:56,400
I'm not allowed to talk. Sorry. I can't talk to you while I'm half a lot of horse

1628
02:37:57,440 --> 02:38:02,000
I don't know what gave you the idea. I'm sorry. My titties are in your face

1629
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:06,480
Sure, here you go

1630
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:15,680
Yeah, don't I look like one hopes. I'm sorry. My sword is in your sleeve. I can teach you sorceries as promised. Nice

1631
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:20,320
None of them are particularly great. Then why the fuck are you telling me?

1632
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:26,720
Okay, perfect. I'll come to you go to for those later when I get more money

1633
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:31,360
Uh, I might I'm I am thinking about bouncing over to calid

1634
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:34,080
uh

1635
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:40,800
Doing trying I have to I have to farm a golden scarab bounce over to calid kill that little dragons with sleeping

1636
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:43,760
um

1637
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:49,520
So I can get some extra runes and then I'll level up a little bit

1638
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,640
And I literally just have to farm

1639
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:58,320
I'm literally just I'm trying to think of like

1640
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:02,960
The fastest and easiest way to go through things but then again

1641
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:06,640
Like people have said like you what are you starting over?

1642
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:10,080
Like I literally essentially almost have to play through the entire game again

1643
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:14,800
Like I don't but I do, you know, I don't know if that makes any fucking sense

1644
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:19,520
I do but I don't

1645
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:23,920
All right, torrent. Let's try our platforming skills. Where's the

1646
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:27,440
Where's the little thingies?

1647
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:30,320
Other right here, okay

1648
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
To me

1649
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Um

1650
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:44,240
What the sigma how do I there has to be one closer up isn't there

1651
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:49,600
These are too far down because I know yeah, I can already tell people tried to fucking

1652
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:54,960
Wait what I didn't really see what happened to him

1653
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,520
Oh, then you just jumped off. Okay, so you did make that

1654
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,880
Okay, that makes sense. All right. Um

1655
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:12,560
Hmm

1656
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:15,920
Try to think of the path I want to go because I could just be like who

1657
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:20,160
But then I need to go into the center of the fucking lake

1658
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:22,800
So yeah, I should keep going down

1659
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:30,000
We're going down down in an early around fuck. I can't platform for shit and torrent is really hard to control

1660
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:36,960
Oh

1661
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:41,760
We did it. Yeah, I see mo we did it

1662
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:45,200
Fuck

1663
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:48,320
Fuck me, I mean

Uh, I forgot is there another grace over here there is there definitely is I know there's another grace over here

1665
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:58,160
I just can't remember where it is

1666
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,880
I

02:41:02,480 --> 02:41:07,760
Excuse me. Have you guys seen a grace? Is there a grace around here? Oh fuck. Is there a great? I'm on fire

02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:13,040

1671
02:41:18,320 --> 02:41:20,320

02:41:56,320 --> 02:41:58,320
My nose itches

1679
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:07,920
I don't think brother wants to talk

1680
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:12,080
What the fuck is that

1681
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:16,480
Somebody's car. I was like what the hell what was the game? I'm like, I don't remember this part of the soundtrack

1682
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:22,800
Our call he had a chance to make a new school source. He was not gonna give him the chance

1683
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:25,200
He had the chance

1684
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:27,200
Was not giving the chance

1685
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:30,480
Hold on let me let me get my bearings real quick

1686
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:40,000
Maybe I should start using that mimic grace. Oh wait, there's a grace right there

1687
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:43,440
I'm like where's the grace

1688
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:45,840
The grace sparkles

1689
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:48,720
I got a two

1690
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:51,280
Let me see if I can muffle the two

1691
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:57,120
Ha ha you could not hear it. No, I didn't have to mute

1692
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:04,640
How the fuck did you get over here so fast?

1693
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:10,880
Testing my limits, huh?

1694
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:15,680
I can handle anything

1695
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,480
Look, I'm what I'm I have the medal. It's on my head

1696
02:43:20,480 --> 02:43:26,000
Yeah, it seems my worries were unfounded. You are not even a real maiden. So I don't even know where this came from

1697
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:28,880
Whereas I merely pretend

1698
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:33,360
There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance and what's that?

1699
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:37,760
I can take you to the round table. Is that true gathering place

1700
02:43:38,560 --> 02:43:40,560
of tarnished champions

1701
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:43,920
Guided by grace. That's crazy

1702
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:51,280
Let's go. Let my hand rest upon you for buttermilk resting in glasses. I'm wearing glasses

1703
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:01,520
Time to go to Walmart

1704
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:09,280
Wow

1705
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:11,280
Wowie Zowie

1706
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:13,040
Hey

1707
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:15,200
Wow, I really don't need to be here right now

1708
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:18,400
What's your name again?

1709
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:21,040
Dia Dia something. Ah, hello

1710
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:24,320
He must be new here. Yeah

1711
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:30,480
Well, just call me Dia Los. Dia Los. Hello Dia Los. I remember

1712
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:33,600
I was doing your

1713
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:40,000
Little quest off to the side and I really liked it and it was really sad. Take your eyes off for for but a moment

1714
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:42,720
Yep, like me. Bye

1715
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:46,080
Um, I could fight this dude

1716
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:54,720
I'll I don't feel like doing all the shit over again. I wish I could import my save from my playstation. That would literally be

1717
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:57,520
amazing

1718
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:00,960
Oh, hey, it's you. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to jump. I was jumping for joy

1719
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:04,640
Glad to see that you're why are you taller than me?

1720
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:09,040
I should have told you sooner. It's okay, Roderica

1721
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:11,680
I like your name Roderica

1722
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,120
Why do I look so fucked up?

1723
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:25,200
Uh, we all know how it's gonna end I become the elderboard the lordess if you will

1724
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:38,400
Yeah, well your purpose is to level up my spirit ashes. I'll spoil that for you. Uh, hello

1725
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:42,960
It's block shot. Okay. I'm just I'm just gonna see what I can open before I do anything

1726
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:53,840
Oh, yeah, it's you who just stares at me

1727
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:59,200
I always loved his fucking armor. I remember I I got it at some point

1728
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:02,800
I don't even know who the fuck this guy is like. I don't know anything about him

1729
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:05,280
I don't I don't think I followed anything that he does

1730
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:08,160
His door was block shot

1731
02:46:14,080 --> 02:46:21,600
I think I remember the last thing I would play it was playing was the dung eater. I was doing the dung eater quest

1732
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,400
Uh, I don't know I'm here yet

1733
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,120
All right, let's let's let's uh

1734
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:33,120
Uh

1735
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:35,440
I do need some runes

1736
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:45,680
I just wanna

1737
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:49,120
I just think of that picture of that one meme of all the guys pointing their swords at the table

1738
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:51,120
I just think of that every time I'm here

1739
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:53,200
Um

1740
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:55,600
I how much runes do I have?

1741
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:05,040
I have 400. Um, let me say

1742
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:10,800
Yeah, everyone should use it

1743
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:18,240
It's still not enough, uh, did I have any more?

1744
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:30,240
Is that enough to level up I think not

1745
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:35,120
Okay, no it is enough. Um

1746
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:43,920
I like I just broke the chair. I could have sat in oh it came back. It's fine

1747
02:47:43,920 --> 02:48:04,400
All right, um, again, I am really just going to work on raising my vigor right now, so I'm gonna do that

1748
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:06,400
Uh

1749
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:12,160
And you know, I bet you guys are hankering for a fight

1750
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,040
I'm up at sheepy is my kind of room

1751
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:17,520
Uh

1752
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:21,520
Oh man, imagine if I could sit in a chair. I'd be kind of cool for a hub role thing

1753
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:26,560
Sometimes when I go to hug fia and I get a degree a concert thigh and the bouncer's pull me off

1754
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:31,840
It's stop the runes out of me. God damn bro. I always get turned around in here though

1755
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:36,400
I

1756
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,720
What are you buying?

1757
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:40,800
What are you selling?

1758
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:43,200
That's me

1759
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:46,400
Lay out your arms

1760
02:48:48,880 --> 02:48:51,520
I don't really want to do that because I'd rather find a sword

1761
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:57,520
Open the door I can't open it yet

1762
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:02,960
Where's fia

1763
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:11,200
Uh, pretty sure these doors are all shut still. Yeah, because I have to beat the guy

1764
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:17,600
Yeah, okay, let's do a little fighty fight

1765
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:21,840
Let's fight this bloody finger

1766
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:28,800
Because I've been I've been skipping through stuff because I want to get out a good spot

1767
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:32,640
But I'm like, you know what you guys deserve it. You deserve a good fight, you know

1768
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:38,960
But he's locked in me taking him literally and putting my actual arms under the hammer

1769
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:44,320
Superhero landing, let's go

I love your little sword

1773
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:23,200
We're just gonna do this whole time

1774
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:30,560
It's a riveting fight

1775
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:38,400
Oh no, ah frostbite I shouldn't have walked through that

1776

I heard

1861
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:33,680
That was a peninsula that wipes around here. I forget what I did last time, but I somehow managed to end up on the other side of this

1862
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:40,480
Before like unlocking it and shit, and I don't know how I managed that

1863
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:47,920
Because there is a there's another way to get on the weeping peninsula. I just couldn't recall. Hey, uh, something about your dad

1864
02:58:49,440 --> 02:58:51,440
Oh, yeah, you're blind

1865

1875
02:59:50,320 --> 02:59:52,320

1876
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:03,520

1879
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:24,960
Question to raise here. How does gal even write in her note? That's a great question

1880
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:27,840
Maybe she had some braille

1881
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:33,440
Secreted from the parents. She basically was gonna do blind gal's quest. No, I'm not I'm probably not gonna do her quest

1882
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:38,080
Although I have to go to cast a mourn anyways, don't I for other shit? I don't know

03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:42,880
It's chicken foot. It's a cave

1897
03:01:45,280 --> 03:01:50,800
Oh, yes, you're right. It is the chicken foot. It's not the golden scarab. It's chicken foot the golden scarab is a amulet, isn't it?

1898
03:01:52,080 --> 03:01:54,080
All right

1899
03:01:56,640 --> 03:02:00,240
Why am I still locked in? Oh this matter. Hey, what's up, bro?

1900
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:03,200
I'm sorry. I can't talk to you. You're fighting something

03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:29,840
All right, and I need to go

1904
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:33,680
Up and around

1905
03:02:34,720 --> 03:02:38,800
It would be I need to go up this way and do gaelid

1906
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:41,120
Or

1907
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:45,680
I can go to the church america and get into that fucking shitty plane

1908
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:49,440
No, I'd rather not do that because I hate that place and I'm so low level. I die in like five seconds

1909
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:54,240
Um, so we're gonna teleport over here and we're gonna follow this road all the way down

1910
03:02:54,320 --> 03:02:56,320
We're gonna go around this fucking shit

1911
03:02:56,960 --> 03:03:00,800
And then we're gonna go and then we're gonna go over here and we're gonna talk to this lady probably

1912
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:03,040
I don't know

1913
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:07,360
And uh, yeah, that's it. It'll be a great time. It'll be a real great time

1914
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:13,120
Wait

1915
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:17,920
I need to go to church america because I need to get phone

1916
03:03:20,240 --> 03:03:22,240
Why is my phone almost dead?

1917
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:28,240
Wondrous physics, where is it?

1918
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:32,960
I

1919
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:46,240
Okay, I should actually go over to there first

1920
03:03:50,080 --> 03:03:52,080
Yeah, let's do that

1921
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:02,960

03:04:04,480 --> 03:04:06,480
Yep, yep, yep

Okay, it's a church america. Let me just

03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:18,480
Let's go

1925
03:04:20,480 --> 03:04:24,960
I'm sorry. I'm trying to set myself up for success before I like legit go for anything

1926
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:27,840
that's it's

1927
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:33,040
The first like the first few playthroughs of this might be a little bit grindies. I try to get my level up

1928
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:50,800
What's up big

1929
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:55,600
Who am I fighting who is oh is that the troll?

1930
03:04:58,800 --> 03:05:03,760
Are the experience no, I mean like um

1931
03:05:07,600 --> 03:05:12,480
Because I bet you're expecting me I know like every time I've watched a playthrough of this game

1932
03:05:13,200 --> 03:05:17,360
Or just watch somebody start it. They just fight the fucking tree sentinel for five hours

1933
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:23,760
All right sick nasty

1934
03:05:28,640 --> 03:05:31,040
Reach out and touch marker

1935
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:38,320
Um, because you know the temptation is there

1936
03:05:48,240 --> 03:05:50,240
It's a ride of passage

1937
03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:52,640
All right

1938
03:05:56,560 --> 03:06:03,200
And then we're gonna talk to this bitch. I'm a shithead. I brought you another chord. This one's better

1939
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:12,320
I don't want to hear them

1940
03:06:12,960 --> 03:06:14,960
Of course tell me

1941
03:06:15,360 --> 03:06:17,360
Yep, that's cool. Um

1942
03:06:18,320 --> 03:06:20,960
I got shit to do so can you could leave now?

1943
03:06:26,560 --> 03:06:28,960
I thought I had a golden seed, but I don't ever use it. That's right

1944
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:33,040
Come back

1945
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:35,360
I want to do horrible things to you

1946
03:06:36,960 --> 03:06:38,960
Bro, I need to look up some

1947
03:06:40,320 --> 03:06:41,920

03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:44,880
Melina Melina shit. Oh spicy

1949
03:06:45,760 --> 03:06:47,280
um

1950
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:49,520
Oh

1951
03:06:50,960 --> 03:06:52,960
Where was it?

1952
03:06:54,240 --> 03:06:56,240
There's a little

1953
03:06:57,440 --> 03:07:01,200
Little grotto. I believe it's on this side. Yes

1954
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:04,240
Jump through this

1955
03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:08,560
And then we can go in here. Yep. Yep. Yep

1956
03:07:08,880 --> 03:07:10,880
And

1957
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:18,640
Find a cheeky little pole. Oh wait. No, this portal goes somewhere else, doesn't it?

1958
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:23,280
This portal goes to where that giant thing is

1959
03:07:27,440 --> 03:07:32,800
Yeah, doesn't it take you all the way to fucking oh, perfect

1960
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:36,880
I swear to god, it did not bring you here before

1961
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:46,000
Anyways, um, honestly, these are some of my favorite minibosses are the little gargoyle guys

1962
03:07:50,480 --> 03:07:55,280
Another thing I skipped in the game when I beat it is I never actually went to um

1963
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:01,680
I don't even remember what it's called

1964
03:08:01,840 --> 03:08:03,840
Aramizula

1965
03:08:04,400 --> 03:08:15,200
Not those little fuckers. All right. Oh wait. No, I need to get the chicken feet before I do this. Let's find a grace first

1966
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:32,800
There's a grace nearby there's a grace nearby over the bridge after the dragon

1967
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:38,720
I think oh, it's right here. Perfect actually

1968
03:08:43,200 --> 03:08:45,200
Yeah

1969
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:55,520
I could remember if there was a chest in that little area or if there was

1970
03:08:56,160 --> 03:08:59,200
That takes you to the cilia crystal caves or if it took you

1971
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:06,640
To where the grand lift is but not on the right part of it. I mean the capital

1972
03:09:07,360 --> 03:09:09,360
Hi, Rina

1973

Rina has like the craziest fucking gash on her next to her booty hole

1975
03:09:17,440 --> 03:09:22,880
And I asked the doctor. I'm like, uh, do we got to do anything with that? And they're like, nah, it'll scab over

1976
03:09:22,960 --> 03:09:26,000
I'm like, you don't have to stitch that or nothing like

1977
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:30,160
Come on. They're like, no, she's good. I'm like, okay

1986
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:04,080
Hi, shebe. How's it good lord? What happened to you?

1987
03:10:06,400 --> 03:10:09,040
I've been mummified. How does that make you feel?

1988
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,640
Do you like it? Do you like my muppet body?

1989
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:15,600
Do you want to touch my muppet body?

1990
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:20,000
Do you want to stick your hand in my muppet body?

1991
03:10:23,280 --> 03:10:28,080
Yeah, this um, so ellen ring kind of taxes my pc on top of

And she made I was just going to draw myself as like a little floor sock puppet thing

1996

And then she's like, no, I got you. I'll do even better

1997
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:49,360
And then so she drew me as this

Are you bringing sesame straight to elton ring?

03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:21,200
Okay, uh, where is the nearest golden chicken foot?

Pizzeria

2186
03:30:05,920 --> 03:30:07,440
The hut I've

2187
03:30:07,440 --> 03:30:13,760
There was like one pizza hut in my area and it went out of business. So just like never showed up. I have they don't really have

2188
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:17,920
Papa geno's. I think there's a Papa geno's my local place

2189
03:30:20,160 --> 03:30:23,040
Local places are it's pretty good. They're all right

2190
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:26,160
Trying to think of like the best local place

2191
03:30:27,120 --> 03:30:29,120
I

2192
03:30:30,880 --> 03:30:32,880
Like a sweet sauce

2193
03:30:34,080 --> 03:30:35,520
Can't recall

2194
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:37,520
which out of

2195
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:41,440
the three Papa geno's Papa John's and

2196
03:30:42,400 --> 03:30:45,520
Papa Domino's has sweet sauce ever get

2197
03:30:51,600 --> 03:30:53,840
I'm not a huge fan of deep dish

2198
03:30:54,400 --> 03:30:58,240
I think it's too saucy. It's too much. It's too thick

2199
03:31:00,480 --> 03:31:03,840
You think Papa John's has a sweet sauce or Domino's? I don't know. I can't remember

2200
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:10,640
So like I don't know. Have you guys ever had like beach pizza?

2201
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:17,120
Is that or is that just an east coast thing?

2202
03:31:18,960 --> 03:31:20,960
Beach pizza

2203
03:31:20,960 --> 03:31:21,920
No

2204
03:31:21,920 --> 03:31:23,920
Oh, um, I don't

2205
03:31:24,880 --> 03:31:26,880
Really know how to explain it

2206
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:31,440
So beach pizza. It's really tasty. It's sound it's um

2207
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:40,160
It's really it's square cut pizza with really nice sweet sauce and

2208
03:31:41,440 --> 03:31:43,440
um

2209
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:49,120
They have they just throw like a slice of provolone on it. It's just so good and we call it beach pizza

2210
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:52,400
Because usually you can get it on at the beach

2211
03:31:55,840 --> 03:31:59,040
It's not there's not like the actual like that's not the like the company that makes it

2212
03:31:59,040 --> 03:32:01,360
It's just call it just colloquially

2213
03:32:02,080 --> 03:32:06,000
Call beach pizza and you can get like ham and shit and like extra provolone

2214
03:32:08,160 --> 03:32:10,160
It's pretty good

2215
03:32:10,960 --> 03:32:11,760
It's really tasty

2216
03:32:11,760 --> 03:32:16,960
It's like the sharpness of the little bit of sharpness from the provolone and then like the sweeter sauce is really tasty

2217
03:32:17,920 --> 03:32:22,240
You have marcos? No. It must be an American thing. I think it is

2218
03:32:24,720 --> 03:32:26,720
I'm gonna like

2219
03:32:27,360 --> 03:32:29,360
Cause I feel like

2220
03:32:29,680 --> 03:32:32,960
I'm gonna look off the name of the place I should get it from

2221
03:32:33,280 --> 03:32:36,320
But I'm checking to see if it's family owned

2222
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:39,680
Or if it's everywhere

2223
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:45,520
Oh, yeah

2224
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:49,120
Um

2225
03:33:06,960 --> 03:33:08,960
Okay, that's

2226
03:33:17,920 --> 03:33:24,080
That would be such a pain to like it would be so expensive for just a few slices

2227
03:33:37,440 --> 03:33:40,960
But it's not it's not that it's not it's different than that

2228
03:33:47,520 --> 03:33:54,000
It's similar but it's not it's like

2229
03:33:56,800 --> 03:33:59,840
But I'm gonna stop describing it because I feel like it will

2230
03:34:00,640 --> 03:34:03,440
You'll be able to find where I am. Um, okay

2231
03:34:09,360 --> 03:34:12,880
Enter ever jail I always wanted I used to call it ever goal

2232
03:34:17,920 --> 03:34:19,920
And whatever it is it looks great

2233
03:34:23,200 --> 03:34:26,640
Um, let me go on swords ash and let me get some pizza

2234
03:34:33,120 --> 03:34:39,520
Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Oh fuck. I might have accidentally just marked it something is bad

2235
03:34:44,640 --> 03:34:46,640
No, I didn't mean to do that

2236
03:34:47,680 --> 03:34:49,680
Oh

2237
03:34:53,440 --> 03:35:00,400
Accidentally was like rate your last food and I was like accidentally put three stars when I was cleaning three stuff

2238
03:35:07,920 --> 03:35:09,920
I could order some little Caesars

2239
03:35:17,840 --> 03:35:20,960
Oh my god, I can't order Pizza Hut. What the hell

2240
03:35:23,120 --> 03:35:29,360
What the hell there's so much they have so much shit. I think I'm Cinnabon mini rolls. What the fuck

2241
03:35:30,560 --> 03:35:33,760
I am getting diabetes just looking at their menu. Holy shit

2242
03:35:37,360 --> 03:35:40,800
I did not I've never had Pizza Hut before

2243
03:35:42,800 --> 03:35:45,440
I think I'm gonna order Pizza Hut just because I've never had it before

2244
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:49,680
I

2245
03:35:51,360 --> 03:35:57,520
Didn't find I was pronounced jail after watching British streamer because apparently it's more commonly known there. Yeah, I think I think that's how I found it out too

2246
03:35:59,520 --> 03:36:01,520
Big fan of the hut. Yeah

2247
03:36:04,160 --> 03:36:11,040
It's bottom to your Pete secret coming out of left field screaming it's bottom to your pizza

2248
03:36:11,280 --> 03:36:13,280
Pizza Hut

2249
03:36:16,080 --> 03:36:21,760
What what in hut pizza hut he is always giving me food points. Okay, I never mind

2250
03:36:24,240 --> 03:36:26,640
I don't need food poisoning for the 50th time in my life

2251
03:36:28,640 --> 03:36:30,640
Uh this week

2252
03:36:34,240 --> 03:36:36,240
Like a pizza

2253
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:48,480
Oh, if I order from here, oh, it's so expensive

2254
03:36:54,720 --> 03:36:58,400
I'm I know I need to eat but I'm actually getting nauseous looking at food right now

2255
03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:02,800
I think I might just have soup

2256
03:37:03,840 --> 03:37:07,440
Oh, no, but those soup plays they ordered from those really good as closed

2257
03:37:08,320 --> 03:37:10,320
I

2258
03:37:10,720 --> 03:37:12,720
Guess I'll starve

2259
03:37:19,520 --> 03:37:22,160
Actually like the crust on dominoes sandwich

2260
03:37:23,600 --> 03:37:25,600
sandwich

2261
03:37:25,680 --> 03:37:29,440
Say pizza for the collab with Toma making a pizza party. That's cute. Actually

2262
03:37:30,160 --> 03:37:34,960
I think I'll just make my soup self some soup later because I have some chicken noodle soup like some Campbell's

2263
03:37:35,040 --> 03:37:37,040
I think that'll be good for me

2264
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:40,160
When I have some um oyster crackers left over from

2265
03:37:41,680 --> 03:37:44,880
The last place I ordered from yes

2266
03:37:48,880 --> 03:37:52,720
Toma knows how sandwiches dominoes is really greasy. I usually have to pack the pizza

2267
03:37:54,320 --> 03:37:56,320
All right, I'm ready

2268
03:37:56,880 --> 03:37:58,880
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm so ready

2269
03:38:07,680 --> 03:38:09,680

2270
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:13,520
I'm already dead

2271
03:38:13,920 --> 03:38:17,280
Guys, I think I lost guys. I think I need to be a little bit stronger

2272
03:38:19,360 --> 03:38:21,360
Guys

2273
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:29,040

03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:43,200
Like bonking them and then they explode

2277
03:38:49,040 --> 03:38:52,080
Look at it. He's being silly

Um

2282
03:39:14,080 --> 03:39:19,840
That's really about it. No, I think about it. What the fuck? Oh, he's confused the fuck out of me for a second

2283
03:39:21,280 --> 03:39:23,280

03:39:57,520 --> 03:39:59,520
Five guys shield summon

03:40:11,840 --> 03:40:14,080
Yeah, let's just continue to how we were going

2291
03:40:17,520 --> 03:40:19,840
I'll come for that bloodhounds fang later

2292
03:40:22,240 --> 03:40:25,680
I'll just get the warning star first. I need something that it does bleed

2293
03:40:30,480 --> 03:40:32,480

03:40:32,880 --> 03:40:35,920
Pizza fun. Oh, thank you future pizza fun

2295
03:40:37,120 --> 03:40:40,240
I should just have something added to my throne and just be like pizza fun

2296
03:40:41,040 --> 03:40:43,920
Oh speaking of throne, uh, I was thinking

2297
03:40:45,840 --> 03:40:48,720
Uh, I'm kind of like I don't really need anything else anymore

2298
03:40:49,520 --> 03:40:51,840
So I just add stuff that I need for my house

2299
03:40:52,720 --> 03:40:54,720
um

2300
03:40:55,680 --> 03:40:59,920
And I'm wondering if I should start doing what Amy did and start saving for a 2.0

2301
03:41:03,040 --> 03:41:08,480
Because I kind of just want I kind of want a model that's like more me

2302
03:41:09,680 --> 03:41:12,640
I love this one, especially when I am in my Muppet form

2303
03:41:16,080 --> 03:41:20,480
That's on this side. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me

2304
03:41:24,800 --> 03:41:28,160
All right, now we can go to Kaleid. We have what we need

2305
03:41:50,480 --> 03:41:52,480
Actually it's up here

2306
03:41:53,440 --> 03:41:57,600
This is where I need to go too. I forget how big Kaleid is

2307
03:41:58,400 --> 03:42:01,520
I thought I thought this game was so huge like I thought

2308
03:42:02,320 --> 03:42:06,640
Um, just limb grief and weeping peninsula. We're gonna be the whole tarry game and I was so wrong

2309
03:42:10,240 --> 03:42:12,560
Yeah, I'm already getting a

2310
03:42:13,520 --> 03:42:17,200
tan model with um, that's what I mean if I'm in a couple weeks or so

2311
03:42:17,920 --> 03:42:22,160
So I hope it not good enough. I love the Muppet actually. I would just have a straight-up Muppet model

2312
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:26,320
So beyond me and Tom are talking. I'm like, I wish there were more cartoony models out there like

2313
03:42:27,120 --> 03:42:29,120
I'm someone I don't like

2314
03:42:29,920 --> 03:42:31,920
Westernized

2315
03:42:32,720 --> 03:42:37,840
Anime style models, but I do like cartoony models. There's a difference. There's a difference in that

2316
03:42:38,320 --> 03:42:40,320
Hello

2317
03:42:41,360 --> 03:42:43,360

Thank you. Thank you so much said

Dastoy

2322
03:42:58,320 --> 03:43:00,320
Sounds like dastardly

2323
03:43:02,400 --> 03:43:04,400
All right, um, I forget where you go after this

2324
03:43:05,840 --> 03:43:07,840
Pretty sure you go past

2325
03:43:08,480 --> 03:43:13,840
Really doing this all by memory. My memory's not good. Oh, you'll pass this tree

2326
03:43:18,160 --> 03:43:20,160
We'll pass the minor or a tree

2327
03:43:21,360 --> 03:43:23,360
With a little funky guy

2328
03:43:24,880 --> 03:43:26,880
Nevermind

2329
03:43:27,040 --> 03:43:29,040

Oh

2331
03:43:41,600 --> 03:43:47,600
And that's what this would be like a thing that would be later on like this would be like towards like the fall

2332
03:43:49,440 --> 03:43:51,440
Probably actually

2333
03:43:52,160 --> 03:43:55,200
Maybe for my birthday because my birthday's in um

2334
03:43:55,600 --> 03:44:04,480
In September it's September 28. I probably don't want maybe model before then as a little tree, you know

Um, then you go around do you go up if you go up again? I'm doing this all my fucking memory

03:46:24,640 --> 03:46:30,800
But I'm maybe even later. I don't even know because again, I know stronti put a lot of money into this model. So I don't want to like

2351
03:46:33,360 --> 03:46:37,200
Take it for granted or seem like I am because I like this model like I like

2352
03:46:37,840 --> 03:46:41,520
I'm not the model. That's a muppet. Um

2353
03:46:43,440 --> 03:46:45,440
I don't know just something more me

2354
03:46:50,160 --> 03:46:52,160
Oh

2355
03:47:10,800 --> 03:47:17,440
I can wield this with both hands. How do I double how do I double hand wield something I totally forget

2356
03:47:20,560 --> 03:47:22,560
I totally forget how to do that

2357
03:47:29,760 --> 03:47:31,760
Oh

2358
03:47:34,800 --> 03:47:36,800
What

2359
03:47:38,880 --> 03:47:42,720
Oh, yeah, okay. No, why is it doing this?

2360
03:47:42,720 --> 03:47:44,720
Oh

2361
03:47:51,680 --> 03:47:53,680
Can I put this on my

2362
03:47:59,920 --> 03:48:02,560
I don't I don't want to use this

2363
03:48:12,720 --> 03:48:14,720
There we go

2364
03:48:18,960 --> 03:48:20,960
Stop yelling I'm trying to kill you

2365
03:48:22,800 --> 03:48:24,800
It's my take a while

2366
03:48:28,160 --> 03:48:36,320
Where's the best spot I mean, this is a good spot. This is not a good spot. Um, hold on

2367
03:48:37,920 --> 03:48:39,920
Hold on. I'm thinking

2368
03:48:42,720 --> 03:48:44,720
You're like in the ground in the ground

2369
03:48:47,120 --> 03:48:49,120
I don't see what this guy says

2370
03:48:50,160 --> 03:48:52,160
Why does it always talk

2371
03:48:54,000 --> 03:48:56,000
You really attack her it's a girl

2372
03:49:00,640 --> 03:49:07,040
You're gonna you're gonna you want my muppet body you're gonna you're gonna do stuff to this muppet you're gonna leave me nice and crusty

2373
03:49:08,480 --> 03:49:10,480
Like your song

2374
03:49:13,440 --> 03:49:15,440
Oh

2375
03:49:15,760 --> 03:49:17,760
I don't want to attack by the tail

2376
03:49:22,800 --> 03:49:25,440
It's because I feel like all this magically aggro something somehow

2377
03:49:32,800 --> 03:49:34,800
Oh, what's the matter? What do you mean?

2378
03:49:36,880 --> 03:49:42,400
I feel like in lower wind tarnish is doing this the tarnish is burning their way into the dragon's body

2379
03:49:42,400 --> 03:49:44,400
Oh

2380
03:49:44,640 --> 03:49:48,560
I need to look up what her deal is though because I know there's like another thing you can do with this dragon

2381
03:49:49,760 --> 03:49:51,760
She's just here just for farming

2382
03:49:51,760 --> 03:49:53,760
Oh

2383
03:50:09,760 --> 03:50:12,400
Oh, she's grail the braille

2384
03:50:16,640 --> 03:50:20,080
Well, thankfully, um, are you talking in leech?

2385
03:50:20,720 --> 03:50:22,720
By the way, are you

2386
03:50:23,840 --> 03:50:29,600
Uh, secondly, uh, that's why you want to get a bleed because the bleed as you just saw

2387
03:50:30,320 --> 03:50:33,680
Uh, it does a little bit extra damage because you have that blood loss

2388
03:50:35,120 --> 03:50:36,480
buff

2389
03:50:36,480 --> 03:50:41,440
That's why a lot of people love doing the uchi katana or uchi ga

2390
03:50:41,680 --> 03:50:48,080
I can't pronounce it. Uh, what the name is and the rivers of blood because they're really good for bleed builds, but

2391
03:50:49,040 --> 03:50:51,040
I don't feel like doing reverse blood

2392
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:57,360
I do love a good blood build though. Like I did do blood faith arcane. That was nice

2393
03:51:04,000 --> 03:51:07,440
The way it's supposed to go is you kill the tiny dragons and it kills the big one

2394
03:51:08,240 --> 03:51:10,240
Oh

2395
03:51:11,440 --> 03:51:15,600
I'm not going to do the gold feet until I get uh closer because it has a time limit on it

2396
03:51:15,600 --> 03:51:17,600
I

2397
03:51:17,840 --> 03:51:22,480
Guys remember taps the sign I have played the game before

2398
03:51:28,560 --> 03:51:32,000
You like frost frost is I never actually I never did anything with frost

2399
03:51:35,200 --> 03:51:39,700
Maybe they'll be the magic that I work I I do for intelligence

2400
03:51:46,560 --> 03:51:48,560
Shut up stop yelling

2401
03:51:50,800 --> 03:51:57,200
She's the mother of dragons why she liked this where's Daenerys? Oh, she put her arm up

2402
03:52:00,960 --> 03:52:07,300
Wait, no, I don't want to do that. I feel like she'll cross me. That's really cool though. I've never I've actually never seen her move this much

2403
03:52:16,000 --> 03:52:18,500
Sorry, I have to hit you in the fucking leg

2404
03:52:28,000 --> 03:52:30,980
There we go now we pop this bad boy

2405
03:52:30,980 --> 03:52:32,980
Okay

2406
03:52:44,740 --> 03:52:50,020
She currently goes too large so she could no longer either fly her babies bring her food. That's so sad

2407
03:53:01,380 --> 03:53:03,380
I

2408
03:53:07,540 --> 03:53:10,040
Hurry up, let them run out

2409
03:53:10,040 --> 03:53:12,040
Oh

2410
03:53:30,520 --> 03:53:32,520
Okay, we're so close

2411
03:53:40,520 --> 03:53:46,120
Forever bopping this lady only she would die. Hello. Where is it?

2412
03:53:59,560 --> 03:54:01,560
Fuck hurry up

2413
03:54:01,960 --> 03:54:03,960
Oh

2414
03:54:09,400 --> 03:54:11,400
Okay, bye

2415
03:54:17,000 --> 03:54:19,000
Any group, whoa, wow cool

2416
03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:21,000
I

2417
03:54:35,160 --> 03:54:37,160
Was a battle it's my first kill

2418
03:54:37,640 --> 03:54:39,640
I can whack you

2419
03:54:47,800 --> 03:54:53,000
Sick now I have a lot of fucking runes. Let's go. Um, so now

2420
03:54:54,360 --> 03:54:57,880
Yippie, I don't want you to shit. Uh, let's go

2421
03:54:58,120 --> 03:55:00,120
Yeah

2422
03:55:02,920 --> 03:55:07,400
Because now the fun starts, you know now the fun really fucking starts

2423
03:55:10,600 --> 03:55:13,560
Okay, I I need a plan

2424
03:55:15,400 --> 03:55:21,900
I need to plan and you think of what do I want for my build? So we're gonna sit here

2425
03:55:27,880 --> 03:55:33,320
Now time to kill I'm trying but

2426
03:55:41,160 --> 03:55:47,800
I'm thinking because we got like a hundred k runes we could you know farm

2427
03:55:50,120 --> 03:55:52,120
No, I need to get the mimics here next

2428
03:55:53,560 --> 03:55:55,560
I need to get the mimics here

2429
03:55:56,200 --> 03:56:03,640
Uh, because that's the only ash that I really care about I didn't really use anything. Um, let me

2430
03:56:06,280 --> 03:56:08,280
I'm gonna look up some weapons

2431
03:56:09,560 --> 03:56:11,560
Yes

2432
03:56:13,320 --> 03:56:16,600
Faith intelligence builds

2433
03:56:25,560 --> 03:56:27,560
You

2434
03:56:48,920 --> 03:56:50,920
Could get the sword of night in flame

2435
03:56:51,720 --> 03:56:55,960
Isn't that oh where's the sword of night in flame I totally forget

2436
03:56:59,320 --> 03:57:05,800
There's not actually it's it's really there's not a lot of fucking options for scaling with faith intelligence

2437
03:57:08,440 --> 03:57:13,800
So I might do like something else there's not a lot of

2438
03:57:15,720 --> 03:57:18,840
You can't really there's not a lot of weapons for a faith intelligence build

2439
03:57:20,920 --> 03:57:22,920
So

2440
03:57:43,480 --> 03:57:45,480
Yeah, I know I got it look like we're done

2441
03:57:50,920 --> 03:57:52,920
Okay

2442
03:58:00,280 --> 03:58:03,640
Again, I'm speed running I'm going there you want me to go I don't want to go full caster

2443
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:06,920
I don't want to go full caster

2444
03:58:08,440 --> 03:58:10,520
I want to do more casting because I never

2445
03:58:11,320 --> 03:58:16,040
Like I'm I'm someone who I always just do like hack and slash the entire time like again

2446
03:58:16,040 --> 03:58:20,920
I told you I literally rolled with blood uh bloodhounds fang for the longest fucking time

2447
03:58:25,560 --> 03:58:29,880
Yeah, there's good options all around intelligence. Maybe I won't do faith

2448
03:58:40,520 --> 03:58:43,400
Like I'm debating because I now I'm tempted to do because I've done

2449
03:58:43,880 --> 03:58:49,080
A blood build now I'm tempted to do a frost intelligence build because frost seems cool

2450
03:58:49,480 --> 03:58:55,320
Although I remember I have had my put shit shit pushed in from an invader with the rock slingshit

2451
03:58:57,400 --> 03:59:00,920
So many options because I just want to know what I should put all these runes into you know

2452
03:59:00,920 --> 03:59:02,920
No

2453
03:59:10,360 --> 03:59:15,480
Not that I can't go farm runes I can always go farm runes. Hi reyna, welcome back

2454
03:59:19,640 --> 03:59:28,600
Oh reyna just hopped up on my desk and she pressed stuff. Oh reyna sweetheart. I okay. She's like I must snuggle with you mother now

2455
03:59:31,880 --> 03:59:33,880
Lend me a warmth

2456
03:59:34,680 --> 03:59:36,680
Hi reyna

2457
03:59:37,080 --> 03:59:41,400
Hi, I'm sorry. I didn't boop mean to boop you on the snoot. Oh, you want to give me a hug? Oh

2458
03:59:42,440 --> 03:59:46,280
I want to shit on my shoulder. Oh, you want to give me purrs

2459
03:59:50,520 --> 03:59:52,520
I've already done an arcane build

2460
03:59:55,640 --> 03:59:57,640
She wants to cave

2461
03:59:58,440 --> 04:00:00,440
Do

2462
04:00:00,520 --> 04:00:03,480
Furnace crest line since you're not an idiot like me that

2463
04:00:04,040 --> 04:00:07,800
Arches him on site first smack talking you. Yeah, I could do that

2464
04:00:08,520 --> 04:00:10,520
um

2465
04:00:11,800 --> 04:00:17,160
Oh, that sucks. I feel so bad for people who killed him right off the bat for that because that was a good place to farm

2466
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:20,280
um

2467
04:00:20,360 --> 04:00:22,360
Thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking

2468
04:00:28,360 --> 04:00:35,880
What are some other uh faith in it have really good weapons in dlc true and that is the end game. We're only doing

2469
04:00:36,840 --> 04:00:38,840
this

2470
04:00:42,600 --> 04:00:48,280
Yeah, I don't don't spoil but that's good to know that's that is still really good to know because we this is the ultimate thing is

2471
04:00:49,000 --> 04:00:53,240
We're just trying to get a good build to get into the like as we're going into the dlc

2472
04:00:54,680 --> 04:00:56,680
Because i'm literally leveling a shit out of my stuff

2473
04:00:57,960 --> 04:00:59,960
and then

2474
04:01:01,720 --> 04:01:05,720
We're going to go straight for redawn and mog although I have to kill redawn anyways

2475
04:01:06,840 --> 04:01:08,680
so

2476
04:01:08,680 --> 04:01:10,680
And then we're just going to go straight for mog

2477
04:01:11,640 --> 04:01:13,640
Mog mog

2478
04:01:14,600 --> 04:01:16,600
Hmm

2479
04:01:24,840 --> 04:01:27,960
Mog is very weak to bleed yeah, because now i've tempted i'm like, you know

2480
04:01:28,520 --> 04:01:33,880
Bleed is just like, you know try to true. I do love a good bleed like blood bleed build

2481
04:01:35,640 --> 04:01:38,360
And i'm like do I go to kaolin do I farm for the scythe again?

2482
04:01:39,880 --> 04:01:41,880
Anyway, I just get that

2483
04:01:41,960 --> 04:01:45,800
Oh, because that's what I did in the faith the faith that I just bled, you know

2484
04:01:50,280 --> 04:01:55,400
You're gonna want to level up your flask too. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know I I do have to grab that stuff. I have to grab that stuff

2485
04:01:55,400 --> 04:01:57,240
You're right

2486
04:01:57,240 --> 04:02:03,560
Bleed is the meta I know but I hate that like everybody has a fucking blood build because it's easy, you know

2487
04:02:05,240 --> 04:02:07,880
I'm like, you know, do I do it because it's easy because I need easy

2488
04:02:12,680 --> 04:02:15,880
Comet azure is pretty good. Okay, I got to know

2489
04:02:18,520 --> 04:02:21,880
It's so funny. It's I don't know why but it's very ironic to me that mog is

2490
04:02:22,920 --> 04:02:24,920
weak against blood blood

2491
04:02:25,000 --> 04:02:27,000
So frostbite. Yeah

2492
04:02:27,160 --> 04:02:29,160
Think about that

2493
04:02:29,320 --> 04:02:32,520
Yeah, I was thinking about getting the uchi katana in the dungeon

2494
04:02:37,320 --> 04:02:39,320
And fuse it with cold

2495
04:02:40,040 --> 04:02:42,040
Oh, okay

2496
04:02:43,880 --> 04:02:48,600
Okay, you're on to something uchi katana

2497
04:02:51,960 --> 04:02:53,960
Get some cold

2498
04:02:54,760 --> 04:02:56,760
All right

2499
04:02:57,320 --> 04:02:59,320
In the moonville katana. Yeah

2500
04:02:59,640 --> 04:03:01,640
Yeah

2501
04:03:01,800 --> 04:03:03,480
Uh

2502
04:03:03,480 --> 04:03:05,480
The moonville katana

2503
04:03:06,440 --> 04:03:09,960
Is in kaolin in a dungeon, isn't it?

2504
04:03:14,600 --> 04:03:18,920
I'm just like really happy right now by the way, I just want to let everybody know that I'm happy because I'm just like

2505
04:03:18,920 --> 04:03:21,400
You can have like elvin ring stuff. Okay

2506
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:27,800
Cool cool, uh, I'll just like search where that is on the map

2507
04:03:29,480 --> 04:03:31,480
I might copy your build so

2508
04:03:32,280 --> 04:03:34,280
Okay

2509
04:03:35,960 --> 04:03:40,520
If you progress ronnie's quest line is also the dark moon greatsword. That's true

2510
04:03:42,760 --> 04:03:44,760
I'm glad you're happy

2511
04:03:48,600 --> 04:03:50,600
I just love this game so much. I just love elvin ring

2512
04:03:52,920 --> 04:03:56,440
This their ability would never do I don't know really

2513
04:03:56,440 --> 04:04:02,200
Do you eat you have the elvin ring?

2514
04:04:03,960 --> 04:04:11,160
I told me after you yeah, uh, yes, I do it's I have it up on my phone. I read that is mega penis

2515
04:04:14,440 --> 04:04:16,440
I don't know why

2516
04:04:20,920 --> 04:04:22,920
The torch only builds

2517
04:04:23,480 --> 04:04:30,520
I'm not on android on iphone because it's easier for tracking for vtube vtubers

2518
04:04:31,320 --> 04:04:36,440
If honestly, I would consider searching to android if they did had some really good ar

2519
04:04:37,560 --> 04:04:38,920
stuff

2520
04:04:38,920 --> 04:04:41,720
Or whatever the light are whatever the fuck they use in iPhones

2521
04:04:44,120 --> 04:04:46,120
What is my least favorite build

2522
04:04:53,160 --> 04:04:55,160
Huh, what is my least favorite

2523
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:06,520
I saw like the fists like people like

2524
04:05:07,880 --> 04:05:10,280
Are like the fucking pots on your hands

2525
04:05:12,120 --> 04:05:15,400
Bo's actually yeah bo suck dual shield

2526
04:05:18,440 --> 04:05:20,440
I've I've

2527
04:05:20,920 --> 04:05:24,440
I have enjoyed watching someone do a bow build only

2528
04:05:26,440 --> 04:05:29,160
It was fun to watch but not fun

2529
04:05:31,400 --> 04:05:33,400
It would be fun to do

2530
04:05:34,200 --> 04:05:36,200
Boomi are you pissing?

2531
04:05:37,080 --> 04:05:41,160
You just me out and then gone the litter box and piss did you just announce to everyone you're pissing?

2532
04:05:44,120 --> 04:05:49,080
Good job boomi good piss good job you pee like a little girl you squat

2533
04:05:51,400 --> 04:05:55,320
I'm also arts and dlc is super fun. I've heard that

2534
04:05:55,960 --> 04:05:58,760
Bo builds actually have good weapon now as well interesting

2535
04:05:58,840 --> 04:06:03,880
I'm so excited to get to the dlc portion. You guys have no idea, but again, I really want to

2536
04:06:05,720 --> 04:06:07,320
Um

2537
04:06:07,320 --> 04:06:10,680
And I won't lie to you. I'll probably pay play a little bit of this off stream

2538
04:06:12,040 --> 04:06:14,040
Uh just to get

2539
04:06:14,760 --> 04:06:16,760
To a good spot

2540
04:06:17,240 --> 04:06:21,640
Um and grind a little bit so you guys don't have to just see me grinding and just like farming and shit

2541
04:06:23,000 --> 04:06:25,880
Mother please must you announce my bathroom habits to everyone?

2542
04:06:26,040 --> 04:06:28,840
I know he just literally just like zoomied around the room afterwards

2543
04:06:29,720 --> 04:06:33,640
Now he's watching birds outside while he fucking tweaks out in the cat tree

2544
04:06:34,600 --> 04:06:36,600
The hell dude

2545
04:06:36,760 --> 04:06:39,240
Well, there he goes zoom in

2546
04:06:41,000 --> 04:06:42,520
Um

2547
04:06:42,520 --> 04:06:44,520
It's also super hard

2548
04:06:44,840 --> 04:06:51,560
Okay, what is the ideal level for the dlc is my question

2549
04:06:53,400 --> 04:06:55,400
That's what that is what I would like to know

2550
04:06:57,800 --> 04:07:04,360
A little level 170. Okay 150 150 ish. Okay. I can do that

2551
04:07:06,600 --> 04:07:09,000
Good to know good to know. Okay. So yeah, I definitely

2552
04:07:09,160 --> 04:07:15,560
I'll say 60 I'll do I'll do a cool 60 69 even

2553
04:07:16,840 --> 04:07:19,960
So I'll probably again, I might like grind stuff off stream

2554
04:07:21,000 --> 04:07:23,000
um

2555
04:07:23,320 --> 04:07:25,720
Especially because then I could just focus and just lock in and just be like

2556
04:07:27,880 --> 04:07:31,560
Um, but we're gonna play I'm obviously gonna keep playing until I get tired

2557
04:07:32,200 --> 04:07:34,200
Which will probably be like 1 a.m. So

2558
04:07:35,080 --> 04:07:37,080
Help you're locked in bros

2559
04:07:38,040 --> 04:07:40,040
150 minimum good to know good to know

2560
04:07:41,800 --> 04:07:46,120
Uh, you did it at 125 and it was hard as hair of last week

2561
04:07:48,200 --> 04:07:53,880
Boomi, what are you doing? You don't need to be up here. You just peed. I don't really appreciate this man

2562
04:07:57,000 --> 04:07:59,000
I'm gonna play with your little pouch

2563
04:08:00,520 --> 04:08:03,240
Boomi titties boomi titties boomi titties

2564
04:08:03,720 --> 04:08:08,920
He's like trying to walk and I'm just like poking his pouch

2565
04:08:10,680 --> 04:08:12,680
He has like

2566
04:08:13,880 --> 04:08:15,880
He has such a pronounced pouch

2567
04:08:16,520 --> 04:08:22,680
He looks like he has boobies especially because his nipples hang out boomi. Can you not paw at my tentacle?

2568
04:08:23,560 --> 04:08:26,040
He just like backed it. He's backed my tentacle

2569
04:08:26,600 --> 04:08:30,760
He's my tentacle to hold up my headphones. I still haven't used it yet because I haven't been feeling good

2570
04:08:31,480 --> 04:08:33,480
Maybe I'll use my tentacle later

2571
04:08:34,520 --> 04:08:36,520
For something other than headphone use

2572
04:08:37,560 --> 04:08:39,560
Hi Yashom

2573
04:08:40,040 --> 04:08:44,520
You're making rena nervous. Can you please leave? Thank you. Okay rena

2574
04:08:46,120 --> 04:08:48,120
rena doesn't really want anyone around her

2575
04:08:48,840 --> 04:08:50,280
besides like

2576
04:08:50,280 --> 04:08:52,280
Me and fia so she just doesn't like boomi

2577
04:08:53,800 --> 04:08:56,840
Because like she's fine with fia around her because she's injured

2578
04:08:57,080 --> 04:09:03,800
But if boomi comes near her, she's like very guarded. Did you want to get down rena? I can put you down

2579
04:09:04,680 --> 04:09:07,720
Let me move my microphone up the way and then I'll put you on the floor

2580
04:09:10,200 --> 04:09:13,640
There you go, man. Why don't you go lay down and have some water or something? Yeah

2581
04:09:14,760 --> 04:09:16,760
I'll let you miss John

2582
04:09:17,400 --> 04:09:19,400
She has a follow-up appointment in a couple weeks

2583
04:09:20,760 --> 04:09:22,760
I'm messing with the kitty foopa. Yeah

2584
04:09:22,920 --> 04:09:26,440
Watch a guy for a white mouse far. Yeah, that's true. I need to

2585
04:09:27,560 --> 04:09:35,240
Uh kill some fucking shit for that. Uh, I hate that part because I need to do I need to do his for the the farming thing

2586
04:09:36,120 --> 04:09:38,120
So I can kill that fucking

2587
04:09:38,760 --> 04:09:40,760
Yeah, so I can kill the fucking

2588
04:09:41,960 --> 04:09:43,960
But I also need to get a bow

2589
04:09:44,760 --> 04:09:46,360
Shit

2590
04:09:46,360 --> 04:09:47,880
I could

2591
04:09:47,880 --> 04:09:49,880
go

2592
04:09:50,120 --> 04:09:52,760
Into is it the limb grave?

2593
04:09:53,720 --> 04:09:57,160
Grave or whatever the fuck the dungeon underground

2594
04:09:58,120 --> 04:10:00,120
that

2595
04:10:00,120 --> 04:10:02,120
You get a nice bow from

2596
04:10:03,720 --> 04:10:07,080
Isn't there an urtary thing I can kill get a bow from too

2597
04:10:11,000 --> 04:10:14,920
Remember strong you got power level by chat giving your stacks the stacks of lords rooms

2598
04:10:14,920 --> 04:10:18,040
I don't think there's a reason to mention a pain to find people due to a level

2599
04:10:18,840 --> 04:10:20,840
interesting

2600
04:10:23,000 --> 04:10:31,160
And and if I do it now, it's probably going to be people who are newer players

2601
04:10:37,560 --> 04:10:40,120
Let's go buy a bow. Yeah, but I want a good bow

2602
04:10:42,760 --> 04:10:48,840
Yeah, that's in the first area. Yeah, that's right. I remember getting that before I might go back and do that now that I have a stone sword key

2603
04:10:53,160 --> 04:10:57,800
Yeah, usually I would just get it and get out. I just would read it and it'd be like hey, and then I would just leave

2604
04:11:03,160 --> 04:11:07,400
Serpent go bow, but the serpent I'd have to get what I have to get right card for that

2605
04:11:07,960 --> 04:11:11,720
Where's the serpent bow? No, you can kill right card with the serpent bow

2606
04:11:15,240 --> 04:11:19,960
I want to I want a nice bow. Oh, yeah, that's true. I can get the I can get redawn's bow

2607
04:11:20,760 --> 04:11:22,760
Why don't we just I'll just do that

2608
04:11:27,480 --> 04:11:30,680
I have done the I think when I played I did the AI invasions

2609
04:11:32,120 --> 04:11:34,520
Serpent bow was in the starting era. Where is the serpent bow?

2610
04:11:36,360 --> 04:11:39,800
I remember I have it. I had a certain bow. I forget how I got it though

2611
04:11:40,600 --> 04:11:42,920
Crossbow in the round table. That's a good point

2612
04:11:43,720 --> 04:11:45,720
Caleb cave easy to get to

2613
04:11:46,360 --> 04:11:47,800
Okay

2614
04:11:47,800 --> 04:11:52,360
Okay, which bow do you guys think would be best in redawn's bow serpent bow

2615
04:11:53,320 --> 04:11:55,320
the crossbow

2616
04:11:57,000 --> 04:11:59,720
I might I might do redawn's bow because he's on the way

2617
04:12:04,200 --> 04:12:06,600
He's like he's he's something I have to do anyways

2618
04:12:10,520 --> 04:12:12,520
I think I was bow last time too

2619
04:12:13,320 --> 04:12:19,000
I might just do the AI fight thingy. We'll have better range for the bird farm. Yeah, you're right

2620
04:12:20,200 --> 04:12:23,400
Yeah, see that's why I didn't want to just buy a bow. I think we're gonna do that

2621
04:12:23,400 --> 04:12:25,400
I think we're just gonna get redawn's bow

2622
04:12:25,400 --> 04:12:27,400
Um, then I gotta kill redawn

2623
04:12:27,400 --> 04:12:29,400
Get his bow mimic tear

2624
04:12:31,080 --> 04:12:34,600
Duvar is quest

2625
04:12:37,960 --> 04:12:39,960
Uh, yeah

2626
04:12:42,520 --> 04:12:44,520
I

2627
04:12:45,560 --> 04:12:48,520
My muppet is seven, bro. I'm gonna out the fuck does that mean?

2628
04:12:53,320 --> 04:12:56,360
Yeah, so with the rolling thing that would be like a whole puzzle I have to get to

2629
04:12:56,360 --> 04:12:58,600
Well, it would just be kind of straightforward if I just kill redawn

2630
04:13:08,040 --> 04:13:10,040
I'm very much human serpent

2631
04:13:13,240 --> 04:13:19,160
No, my butt is serving bro. I'm about to act up. What wait, what's wait though? Wait till what wait till I do this, huh?

2632
04:13:20,040 --> 04:13:22,600
Wait till I do this. What if I take these bad puppies off?

2633
04:13:23,640 --> 04:13:25,160
or if I

2634
04:13:25,160 --> 04:13:27,160
Take these puppies away

2635
04:13:29,240 --> 04:13:31,240
Now

2636
04:13:32,040 --> 04:13:34,040
My full power is unleashed

2637
04:13:36,520 --> 04:13:39,240
Now you see me in all my glory

2638
04:13:39,960 --> 04:13:41,960
Yeah

2639
04:13:42,360 --> 04:13:44,360
How's that make you feel?

2640
04:13:45,080 --> 04:13:47,080
Knowing you want to have relations with a puppet

2641
04:13:48,200 --> 04:13:50,200
Dirty dirty boy

2677
04:16:18,920 --> 04:16:24,680
I remember I was like so thankful that like there's just like one person that I summoned in that just fucking wrecked him

2678
04:16:25,480 --> 04:16:27,480
with a comet

2679
04:16:27,480 --> 04:16:29,480
And I was like yo

2680
04:16:32,200 --> 04:16:35,480
Getting softcap so uh, but it's it's good for like

2681
04:16:36,840 --> 04:16:41,560
Just a basic thing though. I don't yeah, that's I think that's why they put him at the beginning of the game

2682
04:16:44,280 --> 04:16:46,920
Beware of any moke type enemies. What do you mean?

2683
04:16:49,960 --> 04:16:51,960
Excuse me

2684
04:16:52,120 --> 04:16:55,480
That's pretty solid. I get myself myself a seven out of ten for that. Maybe eight

2685
04:16:57,640 --> 04:16:59,640
If it was like oh, then I would have been better

2686
04:17:01,960 --> 04:17:06,840
Yeah, okay, that's all I agree. I agree with these I agree with these a little tisker

2687
04:17:08,280 --> 04:17:13,800
I love how me and strawnee both call it tisker because in my head I read it as tisker and she also calls it a tisker

2688
04:17:16,120 --> 04:17:18,840
We'll carry you until you get rid of dons. Yeah, precisely

2689
04:17:20,280 --> 04:17:23,480
Okay, I think I'm gonna level myself

2690
04:17:24,440 --> 04:17:26,440
intelligence

2691
04:17:27,880 --> 04:17:29,480
but like

2692
04:17:29,480 --> 04:17:33,240
What weapon do I get again? I've never done an intelligence build

2693
04:17:35,160 --> 04:17:37,720
I've done faith. I've done strength

2694
04:17:38,680 --> 04:17:41,320
I've done dexterity. I've done arcane

2695
04:17:42,280 --> 04:17:47,080
I've never really like messed with the magic aspect of Elden Ring minus like what's in faith

2696
04:17:48,840 --> 04:17:50,840
I never did any of the sorcery shit

2697
04:17:51,800 --> 04:17:53,800
I

2698
04:17:54,360 --> 04:17:57,480
Wish I did because it's like perfect for long range

2699
04:18:00,440 --> 04:18:02,440
Mommy, what are you doing?

2700
04:18:10,360 --> 04:18:16,680
Do you dexterity katana with frost or moonville? Okay. All right. Yeah, let's get let's get the let's get the moonville

2701
04:18:18,600 --> 04:18:20,600
Let's get the moonville

2702
04:18:21,640 --> 04:18:24,520
I 100 agree. Okay. Uh, where's the moonville?

2703
04:18:25,480 --> 04:18:28,520
It's in kaolin. It's in what you're gonna call it

2704
04:18:29,720 --> 04:18:31,960
I need to get the kaolin map

2705
04:18:32,600 --> 04:18:38,920
Uh, let's go over here and run to get the kaolin. Wait, there's a cliff, isn't there?

2706
04:18:39,960 --> 04:18:43,720
Oh, fuck me. I know there's like one here one there one there

2707
04:18:45,800 --> 04:18:47,800
I'm gonna start up here first actually

2708
04:18:51,560 --> 04:18:53,560
You

2709
04:18:53,880 --> 04:18:58,280
Tunnel for left that's right. I want to do frost because I think frost would be fun

2710
04:18:59,320 --> 04:19:02,920
And some of the gravity shit. Um, yeah, isn't it?

2711
04:19:05,000 --> 04:19:08,280
Is it right? Is this this isn't it right? This isn't where it is, right?

2712
04:19:09,640 --> 04:19:14,360
It's not here. It's like there's one like over here, right? I don't know am I tripping

2713
04:19:16,680 --> 04:19:18,680
It's this one

2714
04:19:20,920 --> 04:19:22,920
This is the one

2715
04:19:27,080 --> 04:19:29,080
Sometimes we need some rotten cotton

2716
04:19:33,560 --> 04:19:38,600
All the magic bug casters it's in the selly uh, it's in the selly the caves

2717
04:19:43,400 --> 04:19:47,720
Plates patiently for everybody to catch up and respond. I'm just gonna look

2718
04:19:51,720 --> 04:19:53,720
Oh

2719
04:20:05,960 --> 04:20:08,920
I'm debating whether or not to stay because I was gonna go over

2720
04:20:09,880 --> 04:20:13,240
Salem's house tomorrow to hang with her at her pool that she has at her house

2721
04:20:15,320 --> 04:20:18,040
For jill 4th of july, but I also want to keep an eye on arena

2722
04:20:18,920 --> 04:20:23,960
And I'll be stressed out if I go and if I do that, I'll probably just do a gorilla tomorrow of elden ring

2723
04:20:26,120 --> 04:20:28,120
And do some grocery shopping and shit

2724
04:20:28,840 --> 04:20:30,840
um

2725
04:20:32,200 --> 04:20:35,800
Sorry, I thought of that because she just texted me. She's like, you don't have to come over if you want to check on her

2726
04:20:36,280 --> 04:20:38,280
Okay

2727
04:20:39,160 --> 04:20:43,960
Well, me who are you talking to? I hear you making funny noises. I think rena just hissed at him

2728
04:20:48,040 --> 04:20:50,040
Uh

2729
04:20:56,440 --> 04:21:06,120
Okay, it is that tunnel. Okay, there is a grace right over here

2730
04:21:08,920 --> 04:21:15,160
This one here this one here. I really should just go up and around to be honest

2731
04:21:15,160 --> 04:21:17,160
I

2732
04:21:17,640 --> 04:21:22,520
Kind of need to find where all the maps are. I'll go get this map and I'll be I think I'll that'll do me a little bit better

2733
04:21:22,520 --> 04:21:24,360
Let's do that

2734
04:21:24,360 --> 04:21:26,920
Don't forget your milk and I know I need milk and eggs

2735
04:21:32,360 --> 04:21:34,360
I still have this in my hand

2736
04:21:37,400 --> 04:21:39,400
I didn't mean to do that

2737
04:21:39,720 --> 04:21:43,080
Um, okay, I have a lot of rooms so

2738
04:21:45,640 --> 04:21:52,520
What do you guys suggest that I should do because I can

2739
04:21:54,920 --> 04:21:56,920
Get to level 35

2740
04:22:00,680 --> 04:22:03,720
Which it's not as much as I thought it would be to be honest with you

2741
04:22:04,120 --> 04:22:06,120
I

2742
04:22:09,080 --> 04:22:11,080
Just all in vigor

2743
04:22:11,720 --> 04:22:13,720
All 37 a little bigger

2744
04:22:15,160 --> 04:22:19,880
Well, yeah, I know I'm supposed to do bigger, but what should I scale for everything else should I get everything at like 20?

2745
04:22:28,040 --> 04:22:30,840
I think I accidentally also put stuff like intelligence at 20

2746
04:22:34,280 --> 04:22:36,280
You

2747
04:22:40,520 --> 04:22:42,680
Next 30 needs to be 17 for the moon veil

2748
04:22:48,520 --> 04:22:50,520
Okay

2749
04:22:55,320 --> 04:22:57,320
Fine for more fp

2750
04:22:58,040 --> 04:23:00,040
I

2751
04:23:03,000 --> 04:23:05,000
Think I'm gonna do

2752
04:23:07,720 --> 04:23:09,720
20

2753
04:23:15,720 --> 04:23:20,600
Yeah, I'm not gonna worry about faith right now to be honest with you. I can always respect that later

2754
04:23:20,600 --> 04:23:22,600
I

2755
04:23:23,560 --> 04:23:26,840
Need 18 decks and 15 strength for a dawn bow

2756
04:23:28,760 --> 04:23:30,760
Really

2757
04:23:32,600 --> 04:23:34,600
Fuck

2758
04:23:35,080 --> 04:23:37,080
Ha

2759
04:23:38,200 --> 04:23:41,880
Will the serpents bow be better than what does the serpent bow scale with?

2760
04:23:42,440 --> 04:23:51,400
Because I was thinking about like because I think this looks good

2761
04:23:57,560 --> 04:23:59,560
I can do hand the bow. Okay, that's what I thought

2762
04:24:01,480 --> 04:24:03,640
Okay, but I'm not gonna worry about that then

2763
04:24:06,200 --> 04:24:08,200
Um

2764
04:24:08,440 --> 04:24:12,280
Sore seal a little farming

2765
04:24:14,440 --> 04:24:16,600
Okay, nice hand puppet

2766
04:24:18,760 --> 04:24:27,320
Hello, it's me your favorite puppet. It's me should be coming bum. I'm just glad to be here

2767
04:24:29,320 --> 04:24:32,440
In K-Lin what a lovely place

2768
04:24:33,560 --> 04:24:37,000
The rain's so nice. I love me a good thunderstorm

2769
04:24:39,160 --> 04:24:41,160
I think I was come on

2770
04:24:43,400 --> 04:24:46,280
Sore seal maybe not double damage sucks. Okay

2771
04:24:48,200 --> 04:24:53,960
She's lying. No one likes what I'm gonna build a family home in Kailin Kailin is the safest place on earth

2772
04:24:57,160 --> 04:24:59,640
I hope there's fan art of the puppet. I like being a puppet

2773
04:25:03,560 --> 04:25:06,440
Okay, I have one more level yet left. What should I put it into?

2774
04:25:08,200 --> 04:25:10,200
A mortar actually I might just put it into mind

2775
04:25:11,240 --> 04:25:15,640
Something for your mind mind mind mind

2776
04:25:17,240 --> 04:25:19,240
And I can get

2777
04:25:19,960 --> 04:25:21,960
Health

2778
04:25:22,040 --> 04:25:24,040
21

2779
04:25:25,160 --> 04:25:31,160
I think string is too man is too hand his bow actually strength checker bow is 15

2780
04:25:32,120 --> 04:25:34,120
Can

2781
04:25:36,200 --> 04:25:38,200
You also

2782
04:25:39,640 --> 04:25:44,040
Oh, I hope there's NSFW fan art puppet just like how I'm something someone said they're digging it. That'd be hilarious

2783
04:25:49,560 --> 04:25:51,560
Hmm

2784
04:25:51,880 --> 04:25:53,880
Where's the sore seal

2785
04:25:55,720 --> 04:25:57,720
I think I'm gonna I'm gonna settle with this for now

2786
04:26:02,040 --> 04:26:04,040
And I can always respect

2787
04:26:06,200 --> 04:26:10,040
I have 6,000 rooms though. I kind of want to make sure I can get one more level

2788
04:26:18,280 --> 04:26:23,000
Sore sales behind me what what do you mean?

2789
04:26:25,400 --> 04:26:28,520
It's just behind me behind me is it this no

2790
04:26:28,520 --> 04:26:33,400
I'm kidding because I never I never use the sore seal before

2791
04:26:38,920 --> 04:26:41,720
It's in the fort by the dragon what the fuck

2792
04:26:44,600 --> 04:26:46,600
In which direction

2793
04:26:52,360 --> 04:26:55,800
Bottom level it's below the dragon

2794
04:26:58,520 --> 04:27:00,520
So

2795
04:27:00,760 --> 04:27:02,760
Oh god

2796
04:27:04,520 --> 04:27:09,640
When you go up and then down so like co-across to the side then down there

2797
04:27:15,800 --> 04:27:18,520
Oh, it's in fort ferro, okay

2798
04:27:21,640 --> 04:27:26,520
The sore seal where you build you want us to howl agree. I don't feel like fighting millennia. No

2799
04:27:28,520 --> 04:27:31,720
Okay, then I'll go to the 50k dragon

2800
04:27:34,360 --> 04:27:36,360
I'll get that sore seal

2801
04:27:43,960 --> 04:27:45,960

I killed your mom you have a lot of cubes dude. Oh fuck

2803
04:27:58,840 --> 04:28:01,240
Again, I don't remember where names or things are

2804
04:28:20,440 --> 04:28:25,960
I'm saying a giant pumpkin distance. Oh, hey, my runes are still here

2805
04:28:26,920 --> 04:28:29,720
Hey, I got five runes. Let's go

2806
04:28:31,080 --> 04:28:34,360
Oh, hold on. Hold on. I should have gone this way instead

2807
04:28:37,400 --> 04:28:39,800
Every guy is supposed to go down rather than up

2808
04:28:43,880 --> 04:28:45,880
Oh torrents fly

2809
04:28:51,640 --> 04:28:53,640
I can't see

2810
04:28:54,600 --> 04:28:58,360
Raven it's your birthday. I can't swim

2811
04:29:13,960 --> 04:29:15,960
Okay

2812
04:29:23,640 --> 04:29:29,480

2813
04:29:32,360 --> 04:29:34,600
Oh this fucking oh fuck

2814
04:29:36,440 --> 04:29:42,760
Oh, I remember this, uh, where is this again in here? Is there a pumpkin head in here?

2815
04:29:46,200 --> 04:29:48,200
I kind of sworn there's

2816
04:29:49,800 --> 04:29:53,000
I'm thinking of the wrong forts because I could have sworn there was a golden

2817
04:29:53,800 --> 04:29:59,480
Thingamabob right over here. I guess I was wrong. I might be thinking of the wrong place

2818
04:30:10,440 --> 04:30:12,760
Oh, this is the one with the fucking harpies in it

2819
04:30:15,160 --> 04:30:17,160
Fuck me, um

You get a fucking lantern, that's why I need to fucking get

2827
04:31:24,520 --> 04:31:27,960
All right, you get up there good job

On the top where the gallows are that's right

Okay, you gotta watch the fucking rat jump across

2833
04:31:47,960 --> 04:31:50,600
Giant rat get down again

There it is dragon source, you know, all right

2836
04:32:04,680 --> 04:32:11,720
Um, it's kind of dark. Should I wait I'm gonna wait whole day. That's a good idea. Oh no shit

2837
04:32:14,680 --> 04:32:16,680
No torrent

2838
04:32:17,480 --> 04:32:19,480
I

2839
04:32:23,080 --> 04:32:24,920
See better because you guys don't fucking

2841
04:32:40,920 --> 04:32:42,920
I'm proud of myself

2842
04:32:46,760 --> 04:32:52,840
Kind of like don't want to hold this though. I just want to run. I feel like I'm lighter this way. All right, go

2843
04:33:03,240 --> 04:33:05,240
Fine

2844
04:33:13,240 --> 04:33:15,240
The fuck is below me

2845
04:33:17,160 --> 04:33:44,200
All right, all right, we're good. We're good. We go down, we go down, we don't down, we run, we run, we're running

2846
04:33:44,200 --> 04:33:54,200
We're jumping, we're going down, we're going down, we're going down, we're going down.

2847
04:33:54,200 --> 04:33:55,200
Oh.

2848
04:33:55,200 --> 04:33:56,200
Um.

2849
04:33:56,200 --> 04:34:01,200
Come on, I need to heal.

2850
04:34:01,200 --> 04:34:11,340
No, I gotta go back and get my runes.

2851
04:34:11,340 --> 04:34:18,340
I like, I spazzed out and I couldn't remember, I'm like, how do I heal?

2852
04:34:18,340 --> 04:34:22,340
I just got scared, I just got scared.

2853
04:34:22,340 --> 04:34:33,340
It's fine though, we're gonna go get it.

2854
04:34:33,340 --> 04:34:35,340
Also increases damage taken.

2855
04:34:36,340 --> 04:34:46,340
Why did I want this again?

2856
04:34:46,340 --> 04:34:49,340
I don't.

2857
04:34:49,340 --> 04:34:50,340
Uh.

2858
04:34:50,340 --> 04:35:02,340
How does this, this hasn't raised anything.

2859
04:35:02,340 --> 04:35:12,340
2.

2860
04:35:12,340 --> 04:35:13,340
Just don't get hit.

2861
04:35:13,340 --> 04:35:14,340
Oh, did I burp?

2862
04:35:14,340 --> 04:35:15,340
I didn't even notice.

2863
04:35:15,340 --> 04:35:16,340
Uh.

2864
04:35:16,340 --> 04:35:17,340
Alright.

2865
04:35:17,340 --> 04:35:28,340
Fuck it, we've all, I need my runes.

2866
04:35:28,340 --> 04:35:31,340
Can I get it from here?

2867
04:35:31,340 --> 04:35:34,340
I could just stand close to it and clip it through.

2868
04:35:34,340 --> 04:35:35,340
Um, alright.

2869
04:35:35,340 --> 04:35:37,340
Excuse me, excuse me ladies.

2870
04:35:37,340 --> 04:35:39,340
Fog down.

2871
04:35:43,340 --> 04:35:44,340
Nevermind.

2872
04:35:51,340 --> 04:35:52,340
What the fuck?

2873
04:35:52,340 --> 04:35:57,340
I could have sworn I heard somebody else talking in the chat and that threw me off.

2874
04:35:57,340 --> 04:36:01,340
I'm wondering if Azura came in and like, made a noise and ran away.

2875
04:36:01,340 --> 04:36:03,340
If so, I blame her for dying.

2876
04:36:06,340 --> 04:36:08,340
Did anybody else hear that?

2877
04:36:10,340 --> 04:36:12,340
Oh, hi Boomi.

2878
04:36:17,340 --> 04:36:19,340
How many did I lose on my runes?

2879
04:36:20,340 --> 04:36:23,340
How about I get like half of them back?

2880
04:36:23,340 --> 04:36:26,340
Cause I don't, I don't want to but I'm like one more level, you know?

2881
04:36:26,340 --> 04:36:28,340
That's why I kind of want them.

2882
04:36:28,340 --> 04:36:30,340
Oh yeah, they're gone, gone.

2883
04:36:30,340 --> 04:36:32,340
Okay, nevermind.

2884
04:36:32,340 --> 04:36:33,340
Boomi, I can't see past you.

2885
04:36:33,340 --> 04:36:34,340
I can't see past you.

2886
04:36:34,340 --> 04:36:36,340
I can't see past you, Boomi.

2887
04:36:36,340 --> 04:36:38,340
Boomi, please.

2888
04:36:38,340 --> 04:36:40,340
Can you fall me out?

2889
04:36:43,340 --> 04:36:45,340
Boomi, please.

2890
04:36:47,340 --> 04:36:48,340
Get off my desk.

2891
04:36:48,340 --> 04:36:49,340
Boomi, please.

2892
04:36:49,340 --> 04:36:51,340
Get off my desk.

2893
04:36:51,340 --> 04:36:53,340
What's going on here?

2894
04:36:53,340 --> 04:36:54,340
Oh, okay.

2895
04:36:54,340 --> 04:36:55,340
Miss Dart.

2896
04:36:55,340 --> 04:36:57,340
Oh, you're fucking huge ass.

2897
04:36:57,340 --> 04:36:59,340
Oh my god, it's so heavy.

2898
04:36:59,340 --> 04:37:03,340
I mean, now you're captured and you get kiss it.

2899
04:37:08,340 --> 04:37:10,340
Why are you so warm?

2900
04:37:11,340 --> 04:37:12,340
My thumbs.

2901
04:37:12,340 --> 04:37:14,340
Why are you so warm?

2902
04:37:15,340 --> 04:37:17,340
Cause we don't mind being held like this.

2903
04:37:17,340 --> 04:37:19,340
What's that?

2904
04:37:19,340 --> 04:37:21,340
Usually you do mind being held like this.

2905
04:37:21,340 --> 04:37:23,340
Can you make a tissue?

2906
04:37:23,340 --> 04:37:25,340
Why are you trying to touch me, Boomi?

2907
04:37:26,340 --> 04:37:28,340
Why are you trying to treat us?

2908
04:37:28,340 --> 04:37:30,340
What's up with you?

2909
04:37:30,340 --> 04:37:31,340
What's with you?

2910
04:37:31,340 --> 04:37:33,340
Why are you trying to treat us?

2911
04:37:34,340 --> 04:37:36,340
How much space do you need?

2912
04:37:40,340 --> 04:37:41,340
Bye-bye.

2913
04:37:43,340 --> 04:37:45,340
You're also protecting me.

2914
04:37:47,340 --> 04:37:48,340
All right.

2915
04:37:48,340 --> 04:37:49,340
It's fine.

2916
04:37:49,340 --> 04:37:50,340
Don't worry about it.

2917
04:37:50,340 --> 04:37:51,340
We're good.

2918
04:38:00,340 --> 04:38:01,340
Inventory.

2919
04:38:01,340 --> 04:38:03,340
We are switching to...

2920
04:38:06,340 --> 04:38:07,340
Free Spear.

2921
04:38:07,340 --> 04:38:08,340
Free Spear.

2922
04:38:16,340 --> 04:38:19,340
Okay, this is the only thing I can essentially fucking use right now.

2923
04:38:25,340 --> 04:38:26,340
Can I...

2924
04:38:28,340 --> 04:38:29,340
Really unclip?

2925
04:38:38,340 --> 04:38:39,340
Let's go.

2926
04:38:44,340 --> 04:38:46,340
Can you use this on top of a horse?

2927
04:38:48,340 --> 04:38:51,340
I don't understand why you can't use stuff from a top of a horse.

2928
04:38:51,340 --> 04:38:53,340
That's like the only thing that's stupid of me.

2929
04:38:56,340 --> 04:38:59,340
Okay, time to...

2930
04:39:00,340 --> 04:39:03,340
go to that...

2931
04:39:07,340 --> 04:39:10,340
something on the way.

2932
04:39:16,340 --> 04:39:18,340
That's a big ass tower.

2933
04:39:20,340 --> 04:39:21,340
Equipment.

2934
04:39:21,340 --> 04:39:22,340
Yeah, sorry.

2935
04:39:22,340 --> 04:39:23,340
I'm a little stupid.

2936
04:39:23,340 --> 04:39:24,340
I'm a little slow.

2937
04:39:25,340 --> 04:39:26,340
All right.

2938
04:39:31,340 --> 04:39:32,340
Great.

2939
04:39:32,340 --> 04:39:34,340
Now I have to get to this fucking dungeon, too, after this.

2940
04:39:34,340 --> 04:39:35,340
Oh, hi.

2941
04:39:35,340 --> 04:39:36,340
It's the dragon.

2942
04:39:36,340 --> 04:39:37,340
Why are you so alive?

2943
04:39:38,340 --> 04:39:40,340
Because you died with your family,

2944
04:39:40,340 --> 04:39:42,340
which I'm so comfortable with.

2945
04:39:45,340 --> 04:39:47,340
Oh, there's all going to be little tangle monsters in here.

2946
04:39:47,340 --> 04:39:49,340
These trees are just dancing.

2947
04:39:49,340 --> 04:39:51,340
Oh, I forgot how many dragons are around here.

2948
04:39:51,340 --> 04:39:53,340
I thought it was going to be a little tangle,

2949
04:39:53,340 --> 04:39:56,340
a muncher monster.

2950
04:39:59,340 --> 04:40:01,340
Please do not get aggroed.

2951
04:40:05,340 --> 04:40:06,340
Okay.

2952
04:40:14,340 --> 04:40:16,340
Wait, am I going the wrong way?

2953
04:40:16,340 --> 04:40:17,340
I kind of did.

2954
04:40:18,340 --> 04:40:20,340
I thought I should go back.

2955
04:40:21,340 --> 04:40:22,340
Oh, God.

2956
04:40:22,340 --> 04:40:24,340
Wow, it's such a beautiful day out.

2957
04:40:24,340 --> 04:40:25,340
Perpetual sunset.

2958
04:40:25,340 --> 04:40:26,340
Love it.

2959
04:40:27,340 --> 04:40:28,340
Pretty nice.

2960
04:40:30,340 --> 04:40:31,340
Hi, dragons.

2961
04:40:31,340 --> 04:40:33,340
Please don't kill me, dragons.

2962
04:40:36,340 --> 04:40:37,340
Please, dragons.

2963
04:40:37,340 --> 04:40:39,340
I'm only level 35, dragons.

2964
04:40:42,340 --> 04:40:43,340
Oh.

2965
04:40:47,340 --> 04:40:49,340
I wish I could pick up items.

2966
04:40:49,340 --> 04:40:51,340
Torrent, can you pick it up for me?

2967
04:40:54,340 --> 04:40:56,340
Why is it called dragon mode?

2968
04:41:02,340 --> 04:41:04,340
I need K-Lid map.

2969
04:41:06,340 --> 04:41:10,340
Let's just follow this path.

2970
04:41:10,340 --> 04:41:12,340
I could go...

2971
04:41:13,340 --> 04:41:15,340
Because there's like, there's graces around.

2972
04:41:15,340 --> 04:41:17,340
Like, there's one over here, one over there,

2973
04:41:17,340 --> 04:41:18,340
and one over there.

2974
04:41:18,340 --> 04:41:20,340
I don't have a lot of graces active right now.

2975
04:41:20,340 --> 04:41:22,340
I definitely need some.

2976
04:41:24,340 --> 04:41:26,340
But, let's...

2977
04:41:26,340 --> 04:41:28,340
I don't think I'll be able to cross over here.

2978
04:41:29,340 --> 04:41:30,340
Yeah.

2979
04:41:30,340 --> 04:41:31,340
Let me try.

2980
04:41:35,340 --> 04:41:36,340
Okay.

2981
04:41:42,340 --> 04:41:43,340
Okay, alright.

2982
04:41:46,340 --> 04:41:48,340
There's a doggy.

2983
04:41:48,340 --> 04:41:49,340
Do you see it?

2984
04:41:53,340 --> 04:41:54,340
It's here.

2985
04:41:57,340 --> 04:41:59,340
I love this so I can see where I'm going.

2986
04:42:00,340 --> 04:42:01,340
Oh, don't die.

2987
04:42:01,340 --> 04:42:02,340
Good job.

2988
04:42:02,340 --> 04:42:03,340
Let's go, sweetie.

2989
04:42:06,340 --> 04:42:09,340
What the fuck up dog?

2990
04:42:14,340 --> 04:42:15,340
Oh, not this guy.

2991
04:42:16,340 --> 04:42:17,340
Hello.

2992
04:42:24,340 --> 04:42:26,340
Why is everything on fire here?

2993
04:42:26,340 --> 04:42:27,340
You guys have better things to do.

2994
04:42:27,340 --> 04:42:28,340
It's so hot.

2995
04:42:35,340 --> 04:42:37,340
My nose is itchy.

2996
04:42:41,340 --> 04:42:43,340
Okay, there should be Diagro.

2997
04:42:43,340 --> 04:42:44,340
This is good.

2998
04:42:44,340 --> 04:42:46,340
There's a grace right over here.

2999
04:42:46,340 --> 04:42:47,340
Perfect.

3000
04:42:50,340 --> 04:42:52,340
California is so beautiful.

3001
04:42:54,340 --> 04:42:55,340
Yeah, I know.

3002
04:42:55,340 --> 04:42:56,340
I mean, like...

3003
04:42:59,340 --> 04:43:00,340
Yeah.

3004
04:43:00,340 --> 04:43:02,340
I don't know what I was going to say.

3005
04:43:02,340 --> 04:43:04,340
I was reading something and I lost my train of thought.

3006
04:43:06,340 --> 04:43:09,340
Can I put this in a bite?

3007
04:43:09,340 --> 04:43:11,340
Can I put this little fucking stick in my other hands?

3008
04:43:18,340 --> 04:43:20,340
There are graces everywhere if you know where they are.

3009
04:43:20,340 --> 04:43:25,340
Wow, that is the most profound thing I've ever heard in my life.

3010
04:43:25,340 --> 04:43:26,340
Holy shit.

3011
04:43:28,340 --> 04:43:32,340
If you just look around you, there are so many graces.

3012
04:43:33,340 --> 04:43:35,340
You just have to know where they are.

3013
04:43:35,340 --> 04:43:36,340
No shit, bro.

3014
04:43:37,340 --> 04:43:41,340
Why is it still saying that my stuff is over there when it disappeared?

3015
04:43:41,340 --> 04:43:42,340
I don't...

3016
04:43:42,340 --> 04:43:43,340
Go away.

3017
04:43:43,340 --> 04:43:44,340
Go away.

3018
04:43:44,340 --> 04:43:45,340
I don't need it.

3019
04:43:49,340 --> 04:43:51,340
Let's just die again so I don't have to...

3020
04:43:51,340 --> 04:43:53,340
I hate having the marker there because it's throwing me off.

3021
04:43:53,340 --> 04:43:54,340
What the fuck?

3022
04:43:54,340 --> 04:43:55,340
It's over here.

3023
04:44:00,340 --> 04:44:02,340
I'm actually getting bitched out by a Muppet.

3024
04:44:02,340 --> 04:44:03,340
That's funny.

3025
04:44:03,340 --> 04:44:04,340
Hi, lady.

3026
04:44:04,340 --> 04:44:05,340
Bye, lady.

3027
04:44:05,340 --> 04:44:07,340
I'm not showing you my fucking fingers.

3028
04:44:07,340 --> 04:44:08,340
You fucking freak.

3029
04:44:09,340 --> 04:44:11,340
I was just touching and smelling fingers.

3030
04:44:11,340 --> 04:44:12,340
You fucking freak.

3031
04:44:13,340 --> 04:44:14,340
You're all freaks.

3032
04:44:15,340 --> 04:44:16,340
You're all fucking stoked.

3033
04:44:17,340 --> 04:44:19,340
Fuck eat a puppy.

3034
04:44:19,340 --> 04:44:21,340
No, you don't want to do it.

3035
04:44:21,340 --> 04:44:23,340
I'm gonna go around the puppy.

3036
04:44:23,340 --> 04:44:24,340
Come on.

3037
04:44:24,340 --> 04:44:25,340
Torrent.

3038
04:44:25,340 --> 04:44:26,340
Oh, Torrent.

3039
04:44:26,340 --> 04:44:27,340
Oh, Torrent.

3040
04:44:27,340 --> 04:44:29,340
Oh, Torrent, please.

3041
04:44:32,340 --> 04:44:33,340
They said more health.

3042
04:44:38,340 --> 04:44:39,340
It's okay.

3043
04:44:39,340 --> 04:44:40,340
It's all right.

3044
04:44:40,340 --> 04:44:41,340
I want that.

3045
04:44:43,340 --> 04:44:44,340
Oh, nothing.

3046
04:44:44,340 --> 04:44:45,340
There's people on fire.

3047
04:44:47,340 --> 04:44:49,340
Everybody's just on fire.

3048
04:44:49,340 --> 04:44:50,340
I'm so sick of it.

3049
04:44:52,340 --> 04:44:54,340
Beautiful California whistle.

3050
04:44:55,340 --> 04:44:57,340
I like when things die and just give me rooms.

3051
04:44:59,340 --> 04:45:01,340
That's my favorite.

3052
04:45:04,340 --> 04:45:05,340
Okay.

3053
04:45:07,340 --> 04:45:08,340
Oh, fuck it.

3054
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:11,340
Can you please stop agroing?

3055
04:45:13,340 --> 04:45:15,340
I don't want to pick up these rooms.

3056
04:45:15,340 --> 04:45:17,340
Hello, little slug thing.

3057
04:45:22,340 --> 04:45:23,340
Oh, there's lava.

3058
04:45:39,340 --> 04:45:41,340
Everyone, did I miss?

3059
04:45:41,340 --> 04:45:42,340
Thank you, good.

3060
04:45:42,340 --> 04:45:43,340
Bye, little sluggies.

3061
04:45:46,340 --> 04:45:47,340
Okay.

3062
04:45:47,340 --> 04:45:49,340
It's right around here.

3063
04:45:50,340 --> 04:45:53,340
I fork or where the opening is.

3064
04:45:53,340 --> 04:45:55,340
And I can't, oh, I can't open the map.

3065
04:45:58,340 --> 04:46:00,340
It's like right here.

3066
04:46:03,340 --> 04:46:05,340
Tell me your wisdom.

3067
04:46:07,340 --> 04:46:08,340
That's not helpful.

3068
04:46:08,340 --> 04:46:09,340
Oh, fuck.

3069
04:46:09,340 --> 04:46:11,340
Oh, because I am.

3070
04:46:13,340 --> 04:46:16,340
I can show you the world.

3071
04:46:16,340 --> 04:46:17,340
There it is.

3072
04:46:17,340 --> 04:46:21,340
Shining, shimmering, kaolin.

3073
04:46:21,340 --> 04:46:25,340
Tell me, harem, did you ever thought

3074
04:46:25,340 --> 04:46:28,340
you could be on a magic carpet ride?

3075
04:46:28,340 --> 04:46:31,340
A whole new floor.

3076
04:46:31,340 --> 04:46:35,340
A dazzling brothel you never knew.

3077
04:46:35,340 --> 04:46:38,340
And when you're way up here,

3078
04:46:39,340 --> 04:46:41,340
you're super queer.

3079
04:46:43,340 --> 04:46:44,340
Sorry.

3080
04:46:45,340 --> 04:46:50,340
Now I'm in a heart with you.

3081
04:46:50,340 --> 04:46:53,340
Now I'm in a whole new heart.

3082
04:46:55,340 --> 04:46:59,340
Unbelievable tits.

3083
04:47:01,340 --> 04:47:02,340
I wonder where he's going.

3084
04:47:05,340 --> 04:47:07,340
Oh, I meant to do this.

3085
04:47:08,340 --> 04:47:09,340
Hey.

3086
04:47:09,340 --> 04:47:10,340
Hey.

3087
04:47:22,340 --> 04:47:25,340
I thought there was going to be like a platform below.

3088
04:47:29,340 --> 04:47:31,340
Well, how many deaths am I at?

3089
04:47:31,340 --> 04:47:32,340
Like five?

3090
04:47:32,340 --> 04:47:33,340
That's actually pretty good.

3091
04:47:34,340 --> 04:47:37,340
All right, let's let's try that again.

3092
04:47:38,340 --> 04:47:39,340
Oh, fuck.

3093
04:47:39,340 --> 04:47:41,340
I have to go all over there.

3094
04:47:43,340 --> 04:47:44,340
Hi, lady.

3095
04:47:44,340 --> 04:47:45,340
Bye, lady.

3096
04:47:45,340 --> 04:47:46,340
Fucking freak.

3097
04:47:46,340 --> 04:47:47,340
Okay.

3098
04:47:49,340 --> 04:47:53,340
Wait, I know there's a closer one.

3099
04:47:54,340 --> 04:47:56,340
Let me just make sure.

3100
04:48:01,340 --> 04:48:04,340
It's over here, I believe.

3101
04:48:04,340 --> 04:48:08,340
I might just run around the path and get to that one.

3102
04:48:08,340 --> 04:48:12,340
Just so it'll be easier for me to go across, I think.

3103
04:48:12,340 --> 04:48:14,340
I don't know, actually.

3104
04:48:14,340 --> 04:48:19,340
Well, actually, let me go back to where I was and then we'll try it.

3105
04:48:21,340 --> 04:48:23,340
Okay, don't fuck with the dog and the bird.

3106
04:48:23,340 --> 04:48:27,340
I didn't see the bird up there before for whatever fucking reason.

3107
04:48:29,340 --> 04:48:30,340
Hi puppies.

3108
04:48:30,340 --> 04:48:32,340
Oh, hello puppies.

3109
04:48:32,340 --> 04:48:33,340
Hi puppy.

3110
04:48:33,340 --> 04:48:35,340
I love puppy.

3111
04:48:35,340 --> 04:48:38,340
I love donkeys so much, puppy.

3112
04:48:41,340 --> 04:48:43,340
What are y'all doing over here?

3113
04:48:45,340 --> 04:48:48,340
Just forcing a poor crab to, oh, this is what's happening.

3114
04:48:48,340 --> 04:48:50,340
Oh yeah, give me all of the, no.

3115
04:48:50,340 --> 04:48:52,340
I just wanted to watch you guys fight.

3116
04:48:53,340 --> 04:48:54,340
What's my job, bro?

3117
04:48:54,340 --> 04:48:59,340
Why don't you focus on the fucking crab killing your ass in the dog?

3118
04:49:00,340 --> 04:49:02,340
Yeah, well, how about that?

3119
04:49:05,340 --> 04:49:08,340
Yeah, the dog's fucking bopping your asses.

3120
04:49:08,340 --> 04:49:10,340
Holy shit, they're killing him.

3121
04:49:10,340 --> 04:49:12,340
They just killed that crab together.

3122
04:49:12,340 --> 04:49:15,340
Oh god, oh, I'm next, aren't I?

3123
04:49:15,340 --> 04:49:16,340
I should probably leave.

3124
04:49:16,340 --> 04:49:18,340
I think that's a good idea.

3125
04:49:18,340 --> 04:49:20,340
I think leaving is a great idea.

3126
04:49:23,340 --> 04:49:25,340
Actually, I do have to go back around.

3127
04:49:26,340 --> 04:49:28,340
Yeah, they're distracted.

3128
04:49:28,340 --> 04:49:30,340
Fine, they're distracted.

3129
04:49:31,340 --> 04:49:33,340
Why don't you guys go fight the dog?

3130
04:49:33,340 --> 04:49:36,340
I kind of wish their dogs would come over here and just kill these dudes.

3131
04:49:38,340 --> 04:49:40,340
Surprise, it was I.

3132
04:49:40,340 --> 04:49:42,340
It was me.

3133
04:49:42,340 --> 04:49:44,340
Oh yeah, no, I wouldn't be able to do that.

3134
04:49:44,340 --> 04:49:50,340
There's no point because, yeah, that wouldn't work out.

3135
04:49:51,340 --> 04:49:53,340
So I guess it's like this.

3136
04:49:59,340 --> 04:50:01,340
Why is that?

3137
04:50:01,340 --> 04:50:03,340
Oh, it's so red.

3138
04:50:03,340 --> 04:50:05,340
I'm like, I thought there was like a gap there.

3139
04:50:06,340 --> 04:50:11,340
Hi, hello, let me just get down.

3140
04:50:11,340 --> 04:50:19,340
Oh, um, well, how am I supposed to get down from there?

3141
04:50:25,340 --> 04:50:27,340
He pushed me off.

3142
04:50:29,340 --> 04:50:31,340
I'm playing this game for the first time.

3143
04:50:31,340 --> 04:50:33,340
I'm mad at being silly.

3144
04:50:34,340 --> 04:50:35,340
It's okay, birds aren't even real.

3145
04:50:35,340 --> 04:50:36,340
You know what?

3146
04:50:36,340 --> 04:50:37,340
You're real for saying that.

3147
04:50:37,340 --> 04:50:39,340
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

3148
04:50:39,340 --> 04:50:41,340
Anyways, torrent, wait.

3149
04:50:42,340 --> 04:50:44,340
Okay, that's still there.

3150
04:50:48,340 --> 04:50:49,340
Fuck.

3151
04:50:49,340 --> 04:50:51,340
Oh my god, Boomi, what the fuck are you doing behind me?

3152
04:50:51,340 --> 04:50:53,340
You're freaking me out.

3153
04:50:53,340 --> 04:50:55,340
You're making weird noises and you're scaring me.

3154
04:50:55,340 --> 04:50:57,340
I thought it was somebody else.

3155
04:50:57,340 --> 04:50:59,340
My door locked.

3156
04:51:00,340 --> 04:51:02,340
You can't tell.

3157
04:51:05,340 --> 04:51:06,340
Door is locked.

3158
04:51:06,340 --> 04:51:07,340
Okay, we're good.

3159
04:51:08,340 --> 04:51:09,340
I'm scared.

3160
04:51:09,340 --> 04:51:14,340
I'm notorious and some of you guys know that I just leave my door locked.

3161
04:51:14,340 --> 04:51:17,340
I'm not sure I leave to go do something.

3162
04:51:19,340 --> 04:51:22,340
Puppies are gonna fall on me.

3163
04:51:22,340 --> 04:51:24,340
It's fine, it's all good.

3164
04:51:25,340 --> 04:51:27,340
I'm gonna lead them to the little crabby.

3165
04:51:27,340 --> 04:51:29,340
He's having a little spat.

3166
04:51:30,340 --> 04:51:32,340
Hi, hello, hey.

3167
04:51:33,340 --> 04:51:35,340
Ow, how the fuck did you get me?

3168
04:51:36,340 --> 04:51:39,340
Where the fuck did that dog come from?

3169
04:51:50,340 --> 04:51:52,340
How do I get down?

3170
04:51:53,340 --> 04:51:55,340
Hello?

3171
04:51:55,340 --> 04:51:56,340
Hi.

3172
04:51:57,340 --> 04:52:00,340
This kid is missing us, so turn me into Muppet.

3173
04:52:00,340 --> 04:52:02,340
I'm a fucking Muppet, bro.

3174
04:52:02,340 --> 04:52:04,340
Get Muppet.

3175
04:52:04,340 --> 04:52:06,340
Don't you want to Muppet me?

3176
04:52:06,340 --> 04:52:09,340
Don't you want to have your way with this little Muppet?

3177
04:52:09,340 --> 04:52:11,340
A little soft Muppet body?

3178
04:52:14,340 --> 04:52:19,340
I have just one giant hole just for you.

3179
04:52:19,340 --> 04:52:21,340
First time catching me live?

3180
04:52:21,340 --> 04:52:23,340
This is awkward.

3181
04:52:23,340 --> 04:52:25,340
Third time's the charm, surely.

3182
04:52:25,340 --> 04:52:26,340
How do I get down?

3183
04:52:26,340 --> 04:52:28,340
I don't see a ladder.

3184
04:52:28,340 --> 04:52:30,340
Do you guys have any wisdom?

3185
04:52:30,340 --> 04:52:31,340
Touch bloodstain.

3186
04:52:31,340 --> 04:52:33,340
What about you?

3187
04:52:33,340 --> 04:52:36,340
Okay, you just kind of backed him and then he killed you?

3188
04:52:36,340 --> 04:52:37,340
All right.

3189
04:52:39,340 --> 04:52:41,340
Get my sneak.

3190
04:52:45,340 --> 04:52:46,340
Okay, I can get him.

3191
04:52:46,340 --> 04:52:48,340
I don't know why I didn't get him.

3192
04:52:48,340 --> 04:52:50,340
Whoa, never mind.

3193
04:52:50,340 --> 04:52:51,340
Never mind.

3194
04:52:51,340 --> 04:52:52,340
Never mind.

3195
04:52:52,340 --> 04:52:55,340
Why the fuck are you so strong for no fucking reason?

3196
04:52:59,340 --> 04:53:01,340
Why are you guys looking at each other like that?

3197
04:53:01,340 --> 04:53:03,340
Were they going to kiss afterwards?

3198
04:53:03,340 --> 04:53:05,340
I think they were going to kiss afterwards.

3199
04:53:06,340 --> 04:53:07,340
It was only like 300.

3200
04:53:07,340 --> 04:53:08,340
It doesn't matter.

3201
04:53:08,340 --> 04:53:10,340
It was literally dropping the bucket.

3202
04:53:14,340 --> 04:53:15,340
Where am I going?

3203
04:53:15,340 --> 04:53:17,340
I'm a fucking idiot.

3204
04:53:19,340 --> 04:53:23,340
All this just to get into the freaking dungeon.

3205
04:53:23,340 --> 04:53:24,340
I've never been in this one.

3206
04:53:24,340 --> 04:53:26,340
I've never been in this cave before.

3207
04:53:26,340 --> 04:53:30,340
I never went for the Moonville Katana.

3208
04:53:33,340 --> 04:53:35,340
Boomi, why do you have the zoomies right now?

3209
04:53:39,340 --> 04:53:41,340
See, your food's going off.

3210
04:53:49,340 --> 04:53:50,340
Oh, it's a dog.

3211
04:53:50,340 --> 04:53:51,340
Not a crab.

3212
04:54:02,340 --> 04:54:03,340
Okay, hold on.

3213
04:54:03,340 --> 04:54:05,340
Let me just look for a moment.

3214
04:54:11,340 --> 04:54:12,340
Okay, let us...

3215
04:54:13,340 --> 04:54:19,340
Let me point to above my head.

3216
04:54:20,340 --> 04:54:22,340
Yes, I've played the game before.

3217
04:54:23,340 --> 04:54:25,340
I know Kailit is hard.

3218
04:54:26,340 --> 04:54:28,340
You don't have to tell me, sweetheart.

3219
04:54:36,340 --> 04:54:37,340
Katana.

3220
04:54:43,340 --> 04:54:45,340
If it's two minutes and less...

3221
04:54:45,340 --> 04:54:46,340
Oh, no, you talk.

3222
04:54:46,340 --> 04:54:47,340
I have to mute you now.

3223
04:54:48,340 --> 04:54:49,340
All right.

3224
04:54:50,340 --> 04:54:51,340
Cool, cool, cool.

3225
04:54:52,340 --> 04:54:53,340
Yes.

3226
04:54:53,340 --> 04:54:54,340
Yes.

3227
04:54:56,340 --> 04:54:57,340
What the fuck?

3228
04:54:57,340 --> 04:54:59,340
Oh, he went a different way than I did.

3229
04:54:59,340 --> 04:55:00,340
That's why.

3230
04:55:01,340 --> 04:55:02,340
You...

3231
04:55:02,340 --> 04:55:03,340
Wait, Heidi.

3232
04:55:03,340 --> 04:55:05,340
Okay, you get down there.

3233
04:55:13,340 --> 04:55:18,340
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

3234
04:55:18,340 --> 04:55:19,340
I got you, I got you.

3235
04:55:19,340 --> 04:55:21,340
All I care about is how to get past these guys

3236
04:55:21,340 --> 04:55:22,340
and know where to land.

3237
04:55:22,340 --> 04:55:24,340
I don't care about anything else.

3238
04:55:30,340 --> 04:55:31,340
Right here.

3239
04:55:31,340 --> 04:55:32,340
That's where the platform is.

3240
04:55:32,340 --> 04:55:33,340
Are you going to jump down?

3241
04:55:33,340 --> 04:55:34,340
Fucking bitches.

3242
04:55:38,340 --> 04:55:40,340
Oh, there's fire.

3243
04:55:42,340 --> 04:55:43,340
What?

3244
04:55:44,340 --> 04:55:46,340
Where did the fire come from?

3245
04:55:47,340 --> 04:55:48,340
Where's...

3246
04:55:48,340 --> 04:55:50,340
Where's the fire come from?

3247
04:55:51,340 --> 04:55:52,340
Where did that fire...

3248
04:55:52,340 --> 04:55:53,340
Oh, my God.

3249
04:55:53,340 --> 04:55:55,340
Where did the fire come from?

3250
04:55:57,340 --> 04:55:58,340
Oh, there's a grease down there.

3251
04:55:58,340 --> 04:55:59,340
Sick.

3252
04:56:01,340 --> 04:56:02,340
Sick.

3253
04:56:02,340 --> 04:56:03,340
Oh, no, I'm not going to make it.

3254
04:56:03,340 --> 04:56:04,340
Oh, I made it.

3255
04:56:04,340 --> 04:56:06,340
I don't know where the grease down here.

3256
04:56:06,340 --> 04:56:08,340
There's both clean pots up.

3257
04:56:12,340 --> 04:56:13,340
Let's take a...

3258
04:56:13,340 --> 04:56:14,340
Pop a squat.

3259
04:56:19,340 --> 04:56:20,340
We're so back.

3260
04:56:20,340 --> 04:56:21,340
We're so back.

3261
04:56:24,340 --> 04:56:26,340
Wait, I need to look up the guide again.

3262
04:56:28,340 --> 04:56:29,340
I'm going to go back.

3263
04:56:29,340 --> 04:56:30,340
I'm going to go back.

3264
04:56:30,340 --> 04:56:31,340
I'm going to go back.

3265
04:56:31,340 --> 04:56:32,340
I'm going to go back.

3266
04:56:32,340 --> 04:56:33,340
I'm going back.

3267
04:57:02,340 --> 04:57:03,340
Okay.

3268
04:57:12,340 --> 04:57:13,340
Okay.

3269
04:57:13,340 --> 04:57:14,340
Got it.

3270
04:57:18,340 --> 04:57:19,340
Let's go.

3271
04:57:33,340 --> 04:57:35,340
I'm kind of forget...

3272
04:57:53,340 --> 04:57:54,340
Open.

3273
04:57:55,340 --> 04:57:57,340
Oh, wow, it's this.

3274
04:57:58,340 --> 04:57:59,340
Oh.

3275
04:57:59,340 --> 04:58:00,340
What the hell?

3276
04:58:01,340 --> 04:58:02,340
What are you doing here?

3277
04:58:03,340 --> 04:58:04,340
Is that Alexander?

3278
04:58:07,340 --> 04:58:08,340
How are you?

3279
04:58:10,340 --> 04:58:11,340
How did he...

3280
04:58:11,340 --> 04:58:12,340
How the fuck?

3281
04:58:15,340 --> 04:58:16,340
How the fuck did he get there?

3282
04:58:17,340 --> 04:58:19,340
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

3283
04:58:23,340 --> 04:58:24,340
Well, that's convenient.

3284
04:58:27,340 --> 04:58:28,340
Yeah, yeah.

3285
04:58:29,340 --> 04:58:30,340
What are you doing here, bro?

3286
04:58:33,340 --> 04:58:34,340
That thing.

3287
04:58:49,340 --> 04:58:51,340
Why don't I ever remember meeting you here?

3288
04:58:51,340 --> 04:58:53,340
I never was in this dungeon.

3289
04:58:55,340 --> 04:58:56,340
Is this where you can meet him?

3290
04:58:59,340 --> 04:59:01,340
Where a festival is being held.

3291
04:59:01,340 --> 04:59:04,340
Until I was stumped by that dead end.

3292
04:59:04,340 --> 04:59:06,340
My love, I have returned from doing the dishes.

3293
04:59:06,340 --> 04:59:08,340
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

3294
04:59:10,340 --> 04:59:11,340
Alright, interesting.

3295
04:59:16,340 --> 04:59:18,340
I like how it's a festival just to kill somebody.

3296
04:59:20,340 --> 04:59:22,340
Yeah, it's a milling stone, boy.

3297
04:59:22,340 --> 04:59:23,340
I have to get so many fucking...

3298
04:59:24,340 --> 04:59:25,340
Oh, shit.

3299
04:59:25,340 --> 04:59:26,340
Alright.

3300
04:59:29,340 --> 04:59:31,340
This is just the exit.

3301
04:59:31,340 --> 04:59:32,340
So, let me go...

3302
04:59:33,340 --> 04:59:35,340
Fuck my life up with this boss.

3303
04:59:36,340 --> 04:59:38,340
I'm gonna fucking suck.

3304
04:59:39,340 --> 04:59:41,340
This is gonna take me so long.

3305
04:59:46,340 --> 04:59:48,340
He basically just came as a passage.

3306
04:59:50,340 --> 04:59:52,340
Oh, it's a magma worm.

3307
04:59:58,340 --> 05:00:00,340
This doesn't do the damage.

3308
05:00:08,340 --> 05:00:10,340
This is gonna take a while.

3309
05:00:12,340 --> 05:00:14,340
Why is it so narrow?

3310
05:00:14,340 --> 05:00:16,340
Oh, I didn't push that.

3311
05:00:16,340 --> 05:00:18,340
I didn't push this.

3312
05:00:29,340 --> 05:00:30,340
Oh, no.

3313
05:00:30,340 --> 05:00:31,340
I must stop.

3314
05:00:31,340 --> 05:00:32,340
Summon the ash.

3315
05:00:33,340 --> 05:00:34,340
Yeah, actually, yeah.

3316
05:00:34,340 --> 05:00:36,340
That would take the aggro off of me for a little...

3317
05:00:36,340 --> 05:00:38,340
I like how he just falls back asleep.

3318
05:00:41,340 --> 05:00:43,340
Yeah, maybe I should summon the ash.

3319
05:00:45,340 --> 05:00:46,340
You're still here, bro.

3320
05:00:46,340 --> 05:00:47,340
What's going on?

3321
05:00:48,340 --> 05:00:49,340
I don't know.

3322
05:00:49,340 --> 05:00:50,340
I don't know.

3323
05:00:50,340 --> 05:00:51,340
I don't know.

3324
05:00:51,340 --> 05:00:52,340
I don't know.

3325
05:00:52,340 --> 05:00:53,340
I don't know.

3326
05:00:53,340 --> 05:00:54,340
I don't know.

3327
05:00:54,340 --> 05:00:55,340
I don't know.

3328
05:00:55,340 --> 05:00:56,340
I don't know.

3329
05:00:56,340 --> 05:00:57,340
You're still here, bro.

3330
05:00:57,340 --> 05:00:58,340
What's going on?

3331
05:00:58,340 --> 05:01:00,340
Like you said, you were leaving.

3332
05:01:11,340 --> 05:01:13,340
What's the sigma?

3333
05:01:16,340 --> 05:01:18,340
I didn't even equip the fucking ashes.

3334
05:01:18,340 --> 05:01:20,340
It doesn't matter.

3335
05:01:26,340 --> 05:01:27,340
I don't know.

3336
05:01:40,340 --> 05:01:42,340
Yeah, I was thinking about the meteorite staff

3337
05:01:42,340 --> 05:01:43,340
and the rock sling as well.

3338
05:01:43,340 --> 05:01:44,340
I was thinking about that.

3339
05:01:47,340 --> 05:01:48,340
Okay.

3340
05:01:48,340 --> 05:01:50,340
My fucking butt hurts.

3341
05:01:52,340 --> 05:01:55,340
Raina, I'm sorry, but you can't be on my lap right now, sweetie.

3342
05:01:55,340 --> 05:01:57,340
Mommy's trying to beat a boss in Elden Ring.

3343
05:02:02,340 --> 05:02:04,340
She just flicked her tail in annoyance.

3344
05:02:14,340 --> 05:02:17,340
Should I do the wolves or the jellyfish?

3345
05:02:19,340 --> 05:02:20,340
Which is more effective.

3346
05:02:23,340 --> 05:02:24,340
Excuse me.

3347
05:02:26,340 --> 05:02:27,340
Jellyfish?

3348
05:02:27,340 --> 05:02:28,340
You think?

3349
05:02:32,340 --> 05:02:33,340
Raina, where are you?

3350
05:02:33,340 --> 05:02:34,340
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

3351
05:02:37,340 --> 05:02:38,340
I'm not pressing this button.

3352
05:02:38,340 --> 05:02:39,340
I'm not pressing this button.

3353
05:02:44,340 --> 05:02:46,340
All right, puppy dog.

3354
05:02:46,340 --> 05:02:48,340
Alexander, you want to fucking help me?

3355
05:02:48,340 --> 05:02:50,340
You're just going to stand around and be a jar.

3356
05:02:56,340 --> 05:02:57,340
All right.

3357
05:02:57,340 --> 05:02:58,340
Sick of him.

3358
05:03:00,340 --> 05:03:01,340
I'm going to poke his ass.

3359
05:03:02,340 --> 05:03:04,340
No, Raina, are you serious?

3360
05:03:04,340 --> 05:03:05,340
I can't.

3361
05:03:05,340 --> 05:03:06,340
Raina, please.

3362
05:03:25,340 --> 05:03:29,340
Raina,INA!

3363
05:03:39,340 --> 05:03:42,340
Raina, space, sleep.

3364
05:03:42,340 --> 05:03:55,540
All right, here I was locked on.

3365
05:03:55,540 --> 05:03:58,340
Okay, arena sweep.

3366
05:03:58,340 --> 05:04:02,680
Why could I lock on?

3367
05:04:02,680 --> 05:04:03,680
Hello?

3368
05:04:03,680 --> 05:04:04,680
Oh.

3369
05:04:04,680 --> 05:04:05,680
Whoo!

3370
05:04:05,680 --> 05:04:06,680
Oh.

3371
05:04:06,680 --> 05:04:07,480
Hello?

3372
05:04:07,480 --> 05:04:10,480
Oh.

3373
05:04:10,480 --> 05:04:11,480
Woo-hoo!

3374
05:04:11,480 --> 05:04:13,980
Ow.

3375
05:04:13,980 --> 05:04:16,480
Get him!

3376
05:04:16,480 --> 05:04:18,480
Get him!

3377
05:04:18,480 --> 05:04:21,480
Sick of him!

3378
05:04:21,480 --> 05:04:23,980
I'm going to die.

3379
05:04:23,980 --> 05:04:24,480
Get him!

3380
05:04:27,880 --> 05:04:29,280
Actually, you know what I should do?

3381
05:04:29,280 --> 05:04:33,680
I should actually be using a two-handed morning star.

3382
05:04:33,680 --> 05:04:36,680
Cuz...

3383
05:04:36,680 --> 05:04:38,180
I don't know, he's dead.

3384
05:04:38,180 --> 05:04:39,680
He's only going to do the bleed.

3385
05:04:39,680 --> 05:04:43,680
Nope, I didn't mean to do that.

3386
05:04:43,680 --> 05:04:45,680
Peace.

3387
05:04:55,180 --> 05:04:57,180
This is why bleed is good.

3388
05:04:58,180 --> 05:05:01,180
Ow.

3389
05:05:01,180 --> 05:05:02,180
That was very nice.

3390
05:05:02,180 --> 05:05:04,180
That was very cash money in here.

3391
05:05:07,180 --> 05:05:08,180
Ow, Jesus.

3392
05:05:08,180 --> 05:05:09,180
Fuck.

3393
05:05:14,180 --> 05:05:16,180
What was that?

3394
05:05:16,180 --> 05:05:20,180
I see a little boost on that thing.

3395
05:05:20,180 --> 05:05:21,180
I use a sword.

3396
05:05:21,180 --> 05:05:22,180
You're a lizard.

3397
05:05:22,180 --> 05:05:24,180
You don't deserve a sword.

3398
05:05:28,180 --> 05:05:30,180
Ow!

3399
05:05:35,180 --> 05:05:37,180
Yeah, not even like a third.

3400
05:05:37,180 --> 05:05:39,180
Done.

3401
05:05:47,180 --> 05:05:50,180
You're not even like near the lava, I don't know what you're saying.

3402
05:05:50,180 --> 05:05:52,180
Wait, huh?

3403
05:05:53,180 --> 05:05:58,180
Oh, he just a little stompy-stomp.

3404
05:06:03,180 --> 05:06:05,180
And I guess so many attempts this will take.

3405
05:06:05,180 --> 05:06:10,180
Jesus Christ, you guys think this will take 30 attempts for me?

3406
05:06:10,180 --> 05:06:12,180
Oh my God.

3407
05:06:12,180 --> 05:06:14,180
You're probably right.

3408
05:06:15,180 --> 05:06:17,180
Um...

3409
05:06:21,180 --> 05:06:23,180
Oh, I had to press this.

3410
05:06:23,180 --> 05:06:25,180
Get him.

3411
05:06:43,180 --> 05:06:46,180
No, Jellyfish, get out the way.

3412
05:06:49,180 --> 05:06:52,180
How did he already fucking kill him with one hit?

3413
05:06:52,180 --> 05:06:54,180
That's not nice.

3414
05:06:54,180 --> 05:06:56,180
That's not fair to him.

3415
05:06:56,180 --> 05:06:58,180
I don't know.

3416
05:07:10,180 --> 05:07:13,180
I'm just going in a circle.

3417
05:07:13,180 --> 05:07:15,180
There's a wall there, baby.

3418
05:07:17,180 --> 05:07:21,180
Oh, well, sometimes the camera law fucks me.

3419
05:07:26,180 --> 05:07:28,180
He's going to stop around in there, then?

3420
05:07:28,180 --> 05:07:30,180
Oh, bro.

3421
05:07:30,180 --> 05:07:32,180
They're just gathered, bro.

3422
05:07:33,180 --> 05:07:34,180
I'm going to die.

3423
05:07:34,180 --> 05:07:36,180
I'm stuck in lava.

3424
05:07:37,180 --> 05:07:38,180
Come on.

3425
05:07:38,180 --> 05:07:40,180
I can't tell what's happening.

3426
05:07:45,180 --> 05:07:47,180
Ranged Magic is king.

3427
05:07:47,180 --> 05:07:50,180
Amazing that my Glenstone did like fucking nothing.

3428
05:07:51,180 --> 05:07:53,180
Does...

3429
05:07:55,180 --> 05:07:57,180
Let me just...

3430
05:07:58,180 --> 05:08:00,180
I'll try it, but I don't...

3431
05:08:00,180 --> 05:08:02,180
I wasn't really doing anything to him.

3432
05:08:06,180 --> 05:08:08,180
I wanted to do the bleed,

3433
05:08:08,180 --> 05:08:12,180
because then I would get at least a little bit of bleed damage every so hits.

3434
05:08:20,180 --> 05:08:22,180
Okay.

3435
05:08:41,180 --> 05:08:43,180
Wow, this is doing so much damage.

3436
05:08:44,180 --> 05:08:46,180
I'm so talented.

3437
05:08:47,180 --> 05:08:48,180
I...

3438
05:08:48,180 --> 05:08:50,180
I don't even...

3439
05:08:54,180 --> 05:08:56,180
Lava boy over here.

3440
05:08:57,180 --> 05:08:58,180
Lava girl.

3441
05:08:58,180 --> 05:09:00,180
I'm only a lava boy.

3442
05:09:05,180 --> 05:09:07,180
I actually don't think I might lock on,

3443
05:09:07,180 --> 05:09:11,180
because I'm just getting stuck with the fucking camera.

3444
05:09:13,180 --> 05:09:14,180
Alright, you're cheeky.

3445
05:09:14,180 --> 05:09:15,180
Alright, you're fucking cheeky.

3446
05:09:15,180 --> 05:09:17,180
I need to heal.

3447
05:09:19,180 --> 05:09:20,180
Okay.

3448
05:09:27,180 --> 05:09:29,180
Give me your ass.

3449
05:09:34,180 --> 05:09:35,180
Oh, why?

3450
05:09:35,180 --> 05:09:37,180
Why, cats?

3451
05:09:37,180 --> 05:09:38,180
Why?

3452
05:09:38,180 --> 05:09:39,180
I'm going to...

3453
05:09:39,180 --> 05:09:40,180
Oh my fucking god, Vini.

3454
05:09:40,180 --> 05:09:41,180
I swear to fucking god.

3455
05:09:41,180 --> 05:09:43,180
Get out of the fucking way.

3456
05:09:45,180 --> 05:09:47,180
I was doing better.

3457
05:09:48,180 --> 05:09:49,180
Why?

3458
05:09:49,180 --> 05:09:50,180
Why did you do that?

3459
05:09:50,180 --> 05:09:51,180
Why are you so cute?

3460
05:09:51,180 --> 05:09:52,180
I love you.

3461
05:09:53,180 --> 05:09:54,180
You smell like food.

3462
05:09:54,180 --> 05:09:55,180
Did you just eat?

3463
05:09:58,180 --> 05:09:59,180
Cat debuff might be a factor.

3464
05:09:59,180 --> 05:10:03,180
Yes, because my cats like to hop up on my desk

3465
05:10:04,180 --> 05:10:06,180
and get in front of my display.

3466
05:10:06,180 --> 05:10:07,180
Zzz.

3467
05:10:08,180 --> 05:10:10,180
And now Boomi's about to take a shit.

3468
05:10:12,180 --> 05:10:13,180
They hate me.

3469
05:10:13,180 --> 05:10:14,180
My cats hate me.

3470
05:10:19,180 --> 05:10:20,180
Um, yeah, no.

3471
05:10:20,180 --> 05:10:22,180
Fuck the fucking glint stone.

3472
05:10:22,180 --> 05:10:24,180
No, that's not going to work out.

3473
05:10:24,180 --> 05:10:26,180
I don't know why I sat down, but it's fine.

3474
05:10:26,180 --> 05:10:27,180
Boomi, stop sending me my feet.

3475
05:10:27,180 --> 05:10:28,180
It's unnecessary.

3476
05:10:29,180 --> 05:10:30,180
Stop, bro.

3477
05:10:30,180 --> 05:10:31,180
Stop, stop.

3478
05:10:31,180 --> 05:10:33,180
Can you leave my feet alone?

3479
05:10:33,180 --> 05:10:34,180
Can you leave that alone?

3480
05:10:34,180 --> 05:10:35,180
Thank you.

3481
05:10:35,180 --> 05:10:36,180
My brother in Christ.

3482
05:10:36,180 --> 05:10:37,180
My brother in Christ.

3483
05:10:38,180 --> 05:10:39,180
Please.

3484
05:10:41,180 --> 05:10:42,180
Hi, Fiya.

3485
05:10:43,180 --> 05:10:44,180
Hi, little girl.

3486
05:10:45,180 --> 05:10:47,180
You look so cute over there.

3487
05:10:47,180 --> 05:10:50,180
I can't look out from you because you're behaving.

3488
05:10:51,180 --> 05:10:53,180
What are you going to go ahead for?

3489
05:10:54,180 --> 05:10:56,180
Are you going to stick yourself to my chair again?

3490
05:10:59,180 --> 05:11:00,180
Feetsies.

3491
05:11:00,180 --> 05:11:01,180
Fiya really likes feetsies.

3492
05:11:01,180 --> 05:11:02,180
Sometimes I call her Fida.

3493
05:11:02,180 --> 05:11:04,180
She likes fart.

3494
05:11:14,180 --> 05:11:16,180
I'm ready to fuck people up.

3495
05:11:16,180 --> 05:11:17,180
Ah.

3496
05:11:18,180 --> 05:11:20,180
Justice for Boomi.

3497
05:11:20,180 --> 05:11:22,180
I'm going the wrong way.

3498
05:11:29,180 --> 05:11:31,180
Okay, he doesn't seem to care.

3499
05:11:31,180 --> 05:11:32,180
Sorry.

3500
05:11:32,180 --> 05:11:48,180
I think the wolves will actually be a little bit easier because I feel like they can move

3501
05:11:48,180 --> 05:11:50,180
around a lot faster.

3502
05:11:50,180 --> 05:12:19,180
I don't know what I got in my eye yesterday, but I think I cut the inside of my eyelid.

3503
05:12:19,180 --> 05:12:21,180
And it is so painful.

3504
05:12:21,180 --> 05:12:23,180
Or I got bleach in my eye because I was cleaning stuff.

3505
05:12:23,180 --> 05:12:24,180
So who knows?

3506
05:12:24,180 --> 05:12:25,180
I don't know.

3507
05:12:26,180 --> 05:12:28,180
I don't know if bleach does that.

3508
05:12:29,180 --> 05:12:31,180
It really hurt when I tried to wash it out.

3509
05:12:36,180 --> 05:12:38,180
I'm going to kill my fillet just right off the rip, bro.

3510
05:12:42,180 --> 05:12:44,180
You're going to kill me right off the rip, bro.

3511
05:12:45,180 --> 05:12:46,180
I can't see.

3512
05:12:47,180 --> 05:12:48,180
I can't see.

3513
05:12:49,180 --> 05:12:50,180
I can't see.

3514
05:12:51,180 --> 05:12:52,180
I can't see.

3515
05:12:53,180 --> 05:12:54,180
I can't see.

3516
05:12:54,180 --> 05:12:56,180
The room is so small.

3517
05:12:57,180 --> 05:12:59,180
This might take more than 30 tries, boys.

3518
05:13:02,180 --> 05:13:03,180
My eye's fine.

3519
05:13:03,180 --> 05:13:04,180
I can see out of it.

3520
05:13:04,180 --> 05:13:05,180
It just hurts.

3521
05:13:05,180 --> 05:13:11,180
And then I flipped my eyelid inside out and it was super fucking red because it felt like

3522
05:13:11,180 --> 05:13:13,180
I had a cut in there.

3523
05:13:13,180 --> 05:13:17,180
I'm like, did a fucking eyelash slice me and got in my eye or whatever?

3524
05:13:17,180 --> 05:13:18,180
I don't...

3525
05:13:18,180 --> 05:13:21,180
Okay, I'm going to try it with the wolves instead.

3526
05:13:27,180 --> 05:13:31,180
Because I think with the wolves, they'll be able to run around and kind of...

3527
05:13:35,180 --> 05:13:36,180
Let's try it.

3528
05:13:44,180 --> 05:13:45,180
Open the room.

3529
05:13:52,180 --> 05:13:53,180
Dumbass dogs.

3530
05:13:53,180 --> 05:13:56,180
Why are you going in the fucking lava?

3531
05:14:14,180 --> 05:14:16,180
I don't think I was healing when that happened.

3532
05:14:19,180 --> 05:14:21,180
I don't think I was healing when that happened.

3533
05:14:24,180 --> 05:14:25,180
Haha!

3534
05:14:27,180 --> 05:14:28,180
On guard.

3535
05:14:28,180 --> 05:14:29,180
Chicken.

3536
05:14:31,180 --> 05:14:32,180
Go on.

3537
05:14:36,180 --> 05:14:37,180
Uh, guys...

3538
05:14:37,180 --> 05:14:39,180
I don't know if I'm going to get this.

3539
05:14:44,180 --> 05:14:49,180
It's hot in the fucking camera.

3540
05:14:54,180 --> 05:14:55,180
I don't know.

3541
05:15:02,180 --> 05:15:03,180
I know!

3542
05:15:03,180 --> 05:15:05,180
Alzeir just hears me dying in the next room.

3543
05:15:05,180 --> 05:15:07,180
He's like, I'll see you there!

3544
05:15:07,180 --> 05:15:09,180
I'll see you at the festival!

3545
05:15:09,180 --> 05:15:12,180
And then just fucking perish in the next room 50 times.

3546
05:15:12,180 --> 05:15:16,180
You'd also think like he'd be gone, like once you...

3547
05:15:16,180 --> 05:15:18,180
Like, I don't get that.

3548
05:15:21,180 --> 05:15:24,180
I don't know why this bleed isn't fucking working right now.

3549
05:15:24,180 --> 05:15:26,180
Is the worm resistant to bleed?

3550
05:15:35,180 --> 05:15:36,180
What the fuck?

3551
05:15:36,180 --> 05:15:38,180
I swear my hip-hop isn't that big.

3552
05:15:38,180 --> 05:15:40,180
It doesn't matter anymore.

3553
05:15:42,180 --> 05:15:43,180
I'm still alive?!

3554
05:15:44,180 --> 05:15:45,180
What?!

3555
05:15:47,180 --> 05:15:48,180
I thought I was dead!

3556
05:15:48,180 --> 05:15:50,180
I just, like, stopped moving!

3557
05:15:51,180 --> 05:15:52,180
Okay, fuck the camera.

3558
05:15:54,180 --> 05:15:55,180
Fuck the cameras.

3559
05:15:56,180 --> 05:15:57,180
Cut the cameras!

3560
05:15:59,180 --> 05:16:00,180
I can't even hit you.

3561
05:16:01,180 --> 05:16:02,180
I can't even hit you.

3562
05:16:08,180 --> 05:16:09,180
No!

3563
05:16:17,180 --> 05:16:20,180
Oh, I tried to roll out of the way, but I wasn't close enough.

3564
05:16:20,180 --> 05:16:22,180
I don't worry, Mr. Baby Dragon.

3565
05:16:26,180 --> 05:16:28,180
If you take too long, we'll break between the hits.

3566
05:16:28,180 --> 05:16:30,180
Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

3567
05:16:31,180 --> 05:16:32,180
You are right.

3568
05:16:33,180 --> 05:16:34,180
That would be correct.

3569
05:16:48,180 --> 05:16:49,180
How far did I get first play through?

3570
05:16:49,180 --> 05:16:50,180
I won!

3571
05:16:50,180 --> 05:16:52,180
I beat the game!

3572
05:16:52,180 --> 05:16:53,180
I got the frenzy flame ending!

3573
05:16:58,180 --> 05:16:59,180
I'm sorry.

3574
05:17:03,180 --> 05:17:04,180
But thank you for the tip.

3575
05:17:06,180 --> 05:17:07,180
I know, I got distracted.

3576
05:17:12,180 --> 05:17:13,180
Oh, no!

3577
05:17:14,180 --> 05:17:15,180
No, my butt!

3578
05:17:24,180 --> 05:17:25,180
It's got a headache from that.

3579
05:17:29,180 --> 05:17:32,180
You know, for the longest time,

3580
05:17:33,180 --> 05:17:36,180
I didn't know Blive had, like, an actual wolf head.

3581
05:17:41,180 --> 05:17:42,180
I thought...

3582
05:17:45,180 --> 05:17:48,180
I thought I was just wearing a mask the entire time.

3583
05:17:59,180 --> 05:18:00,180
I am...

3584
05:18:01,180 --> 05:18:03,180
getting out of the fucking way and it's not working.

3585
05:18:05,180 --> 05:18:07,180
I got all the damage I did with my Blive, Blive.

3586
05:18:08,180 --> 05:18:09,180
Like that.

3587
05:18:14,180 --> 05:18:15,180
Whee!

3588
05:18:15,180 --> 05:18:16,180
Oh, you like that?

3589
05:18:16,180 --> 05:18:18,180
Right in the fucking eye, suck it in it.

3590
05:18:23,180 --> 05:18:24,180
I'll leave you with a kiss.

3591
05:18:24,180 --> 05:18:25,180
Yeah, you get that.

3592
05:18:28,180 --> 05:18:29,180
I'll leave you with a kiss.

3593
05:18:34,180 --> 05:18:38,180
This sheebie Muppet needs to violently shake when speaking.

3594
05:18:40,180 --> 05:18:41,180
Wait, hold up.

3595
05:18:41,180 --> 05:18:42,180
I got you.

3596
05:18:45,180 --> 05:18:46,180
Hi, I'm Sheebie.

3597
05:18:46,180 --> 05:18:47,180
What's up?

3598
05:18:47,180 --> 05:18:48,180
I'm a Muppet.

3599
05:18:49,180 --> 05:18:50,180
Fuck your mom.

3600
05:18:59,180 --> 05:19:00,180
Um...

3601
05:19:01,180 --> 05:19:02,180
Tomo is...

3602
05:19:02,180 --> 05:19:04,180
We're gonna make me, like, my arms move, too.

3603
05:19:05,180 --> 05:19:06,180
Like, that I, like, shrug my arms.

3604
05:19:08,180 --> 05:19:09,180
What the fuck?

3605
05:19:09,180 --> 05:19:10,180
That noise.

3606
05:19:12,180 --> 05:19:13,180
Oh, it's just sleeping.

3607
05:19:13,180 --> 05:19:15,180
That's why it's making a lot of sleeping noise.

3608
05:19:15,180 --> 05:19:16,180
And it just wasn't working out.

3609
05:19:17,180 --> 05:19:18,180
And I thought it wasn't working out,

3610
05:19:18,180 --> 05:19:20,180
so she had already drawn on the layer,

3611
05:19:20,180 --> 05:19:21,180
and she was like, ah fuck,

3612
05:19:21,180 --> 05:19:22,180
and I was like, oh, it's fine.

3613
05:19:25,180 --> 05:19:27,180
Like, I just, like, ring a box.

3614
05:19:27,180 --> 05:19:29,180
Sick' cm, boys.

3615
05:19:29,180 --> 05:19:30,180
Sick' mm.

3616
05:19:30,180 --> 05:19:31,180
Get his ass!

3617
05:19:31,180 --> 05:19:32,180
Got his ass!

3618
05:19:32,180 --> 05:19:33,180
Get his ass!

3619
05:19:33,180 --> 05:19:34,180
Yeah!

3620
05:19:34,180 --> 05:19:35,180
Fuck' em up!

3621
05:19:38,180 --> 05:19:39,180
I hit his belly.

3622
05:19:39,180 --> 05:19:40,180
I hit his belly.

3623
05:19:42,180 --> 05:19:43,180
Fuck' em up, fuck' em up!

3624
05:19:43,180 --> 05:19:44,180
I'm staying solid...

3625
05:19:44,180 --> 05:19:45,180
I'm staying solid.

3626
05:19:45,180 --> 05:19:46,180
I'm solid.

3627
05:19:47,180 --> 05:19:48,180
Get out of the way...

3628
05:19:48,180 --> 05:19:49,180
Get out of the way.

3629
05:19:49,180 --> 05:19:50,180
Get out of the way...

3630
05:19:50,180 --> 05:19:51,180
Out of the way...

3631
05:19:52,180 --> 05:19:54,180
Out of the way, I'm dead.

3632
05:19:54,180 --> 05:19:55,180
It's fine.

3633
05:19:55,180 --> 05:19:56,180
It's fine.

3634
05:19:56,180 --> 05:19:57,080
We're good.

3635
05:19:57,080 --> 05:19:58,720
the fourth of the way there.

3636
05:19:58,720 --> 05:19:59,560
Maybe a fifth?

3637
05:20:01,080 --> 05:20:01,920
Maybe a fifth?

3638
05:20:01,920 --> 05:20:03,920
That was pretty cool.

3639
05:20:03,920 --> 05:20:04,760
You so cute and funny.

3640
05:20:04,760 --> 05:20:07,080
You think I'm cute and funny?

3641
05:20:07,080 --> 05:20:10,360
Yeah, that's so nice of you.

3642
05:20:10,360 --> 05:20:11,200
Oh my God.

3643
05:20:12,480 --> 05:20:14,480
He thinks I'm cute and funny.

3644
05:20:15,720 --> 05:20:17,960
I don't know why I have a valid girl accent

3645
05:20:17,960 --> 05:20:19,400
when I'm talking like this.

3646
05:20:19,400 --> 05:20:22,000
This isn't even my cute and funny voice, is it?

3647
05:20:22,000 --> 05:20:23,960
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3648
05:20:23,960 --> 05:20:24,800
Um.

3649
05:20:27,480 --> 05:20:28,320
Hmm.

3650
05:20:30,000 --> 05:20:30,840
Hmm.

3651
05:20:32,960 --> 05:20:34,440
Hmm.

3652
05:20:34,440 --> 05:20:35,280
Ha.

3653
05:20:37,080 --> 05:20:37,920
Hmm.

3654
05:20:40,560 --> 05:20:42,960
There must be a better way.

3655
05:20:42,960 --> 05:20:45,360
I know I can beat this demon.

3656
05:20:45,360 --> 05:20:47,400
I just have to believe in myself.

3657
05:20:50,680 --> 05:20:51,520
Oh, fuck it.

3658
05:20:52,520 --> 05:20:53,520
Fuck it.

3659
05:20:53,520 --> 05:20:54,520
Fuck it.

3660
05:20:54,520 --> 05:20:55,520
Fuck it.

3661
05:20:55,520 --> 05:20:56,520
Fuck it.

3662
05:20:56,520 --> 05:20:57,520
Fuck it.

3663
05:20:57,520 --> 05:20:58,520
Fuck it.

3664
05:20:58,520 --> 05:20:59,520
Fuck it.

3665
05:20:59,520 --> 05:21:00,520
Fuck it.

3666
05:21:00,520 --> 05:21:01,520
He sounded like God Earth.

3667
05:21:17,520 --> 05:21:18,520
Ow.

3668
05:21:21,520 --> 05:21:22,520
Ow.

3669
05:21:27,520 --> 05:21:29,520
Oh, fuck him out.

3670
05:21:33,520 --> 05:21:35,520
Don't roll into the fucking lava, Shibi.

3671
05:21:35,520 --> 05:21:37,520
Don't roll into the fucking lava.

3672
05:21:37,520 --> 05:21:39,520
Oh my God, please.

3673
05:21:39,520 --> 05:21:40,520
Oh my God, please.

3674
05:21:40,520 --> 05:21:41,520
Oh my God, no.

3675
05:21:41,520 --> 05:21:43,520
You have me in a fucking corner, bro.

3676
05:21:43,520 --> 05:21:44,520
Oh, fuck your mother.

3677
05:21:44,520 --> 05:21:45,520
Fuck your mother so hard.

3678
05:21:45,520 --> 05:21:46,520
I hate it here.

3679
05:21:46,520 --> 05:21:47,520
I hate it here.

3680
05:21:48,520 --> 05:21:49,520
I hate it here.

3681
05:21:52,520 --> 05:21:54,520
Darn stream for Magma Worm.

3682
05:21:59,520 --> 05:22:01,520
I think I need a snacky.

3683
05:22:01,520 --> 05:22:02,520
What is this?

3684
05:22:02,520 --> 05:22:03,520
I don't even know what this is.

3685
05:22:03,520 --> 05:22:05,520
Adorable cracker.

3686
05:22:05,520 --> 05:22:07,520
That's what it says.

3687
05:22:07,520 --> 05:22:10,520
That's what my mom called me when I was younger.

3688
05:22:10,520 --> 05:22:11,520
Okay.

3689
05:22:13,520 --> 05:22:14,520
He smells so bad.

3690
05:22:14,520 --> 05:22:15,520
I'm not eating this.

3691
05:22:15,520 --> 05:22:16,520
Nevermind.

3692
05:22:17,520 --> 05:22:19,520
That smells horrible.

3693
05:22:19,520 --> 05:22:20,520
What is this?

3694
05:22:20,520 --> 05:22:22,520
Another fucking butter cookie?

3695
05:22:22,520 --> 05:22:24,520
Oh, it's a rice cookie, I think.

3696
05:22:30,520 --> 05:22:31,520
Rice cracker.

3697
05:22:35,520 --> 05:22:36,520
Yup.

3698
05:22:39,520 --> 05:22:40,520
That's a rice cracker.

3699
05:22:49,520 --> 05:22:56,520
I don't think I like the taste of that.

3700
05:22:56,520 --> 05:23:05,520
They sound like God or some sort of neutron when they barf.

3701
05:23:05,520 --> 05:23:15,520
Get up puppies.

3702
05:23:15,520 --> 05:23:20,520
Get up puppies.

3703
05:23:20,520 --> 05:23:21,520
No.

3704
05:23:21,520 --> 05:23:22,520
No.

3705
05:23:22,520 --> 05:23:27,520
Guys, I don't think I want to be the...

3706
05:23:27,520 --> 05:23:33,520
Guys, I don't think I want to be the...

3707
05:23:33,520 --> 05:23:35,520
Guys, I don't think I want to read them.

3708
05:23:43,920 --> 05:23:45,920
I'm gonna be here a bit.

3709
05:23:47,240 --> 05:23:49,240
Move up.

3710
05:23:49,520 --> 05:23:51,520
I'm gonna help her.

3711
05:23:55,640 --> 05:23:57,640
I hate that you look like you're made of shit.

3712
05:24:04,400 --> 05:24:08,400
At least get to the 30 for the bet.

3713
05:24:22,000 --> 05:24:25,000
Bring the tummy, bring the tummy, bring the tummy, hold on.

3714
05:24:28,000 --> 05:24:30,000
Get him, don't get him.

3715
05:24:33,520 --> 05:24:35,520
Mmmmm!

3716
05:24:39,520 --> 05:24:41,520
Your beans wouldn't be so much better.

3717
05:24:41,520 --> 05:24:43,520
Why am I doing this?

3718
05:24:43,520 --> 05:24:45,520
Hello? I didn't mean to press that.

3719
05:24:45,520 --> 05:25:10,520
get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get

05:30:31,520 --> 05:30:41,520
get out,

3738
05:30:41,520 --> 05:30:51,520

I am a gamer, but I am not a good gamer.

3782
05:32:34,480 --> 05:33:00,480
You are my candy, and I'm stuck on the camera lock.

3783
05:33:00,480 --> 05:33:10,480
Get his leg, get his fucking leg, get his fucking leg, get his ass, get his ass, get his leg.

3784
05:33:10,480 --> 05:33:20,480
No, jellyfish, get out of the fucking way!

3785
05:33:20,480 --> 05:33:21,480
Jellyfish!

3786
05:33:21,480 --> 05:33:26,480
Jellyfish, no!

3787
05:33:26,480 --> 05:33:36,480
No!

3788
05:33:36,480 --> 05:33:40,480
I already knew that was a bad one.

3789
05:33:40,480 --> 05:33:46,480
The restaurant was good, the couple runs ago was good.

3790
05:33:46,480 --> 05:33:51,480
I know jellyfish did take that entire fucking hit, he's just like, I'll eat this.

3791
05:33:51,480 --> 05:33:55,480
I'll eat this and spit it back out of your face in the form of poison.

3792
05:33:55,480 --> 05:33:59,480
Black girl, his boy is not, maybe any like that battle music.

3793
05:33:59,480 --> 05:34:03,480
Maybe any like that black stripes, sorry white stripes.

3794
05:34:03,480 --> 05:34:07,480
The black stripes.

3795
05:34:07,480 --> 05:34:10,480
Yeah!

3796
05:34:10,480 --> 05:34:14,480
Stepping down, stepping down, kicking down, kicking down, kicking down.

3797
05:34:14,480 --> 05:34:20,480
Your fucking bootyhole, Imma poke your fucking bootyhole.

05:35:08,320 --> 05:35:10,320
That's a spacey meatball

3802
05:35:17,640 --> 05:35:19,640
Don't die jellyfish

3803
05:35:21,480 --> 05:35:25,000
I didn't know I could pass us across the session

3804
05:35:30,640 --> 05:35:32,640
Get his ass, get his ass, get his ass

3805
05:35:46,040 --> 05:35:48,040
You can't see me

3806
05:35:50,480 --> 05:35:52,480
Yeah

3807
05:36:20,480 --> 05:36:22,480

3808
05:36:23,200 --> 05:36:27,360
Was stuck I was stuck. I was stuck. I was stuck. I was stuck. I was stuck this is the run

3809
05:36:27,360 --> 05:36:28,800
This is the run. I was fucking stuck

3810
05:36:28,800 --> 05:36:35,760
I got stuck because the stupid fucking camera lock sometimes I hate locking on because the camera fucks me, bro

3811
05:36:35,760 --> 05:36:37,760
I swear to God

3812
05:36:38,120 --> 05:36:42,520
It's fine. It's fine. Now, you know, we know what we're doing now, you know, I hope I don't have neighbors

3813
05:36:43,080 --> 05:36:48,440
My neighbors don't hear me just screaming at the top of my fucking lungs. I don't think I don't think I have a neighbor below me anymore

3814
05:36:48,440 --> 05:36:50,440
I think they moved out

3815
05:36:50,840 --> 05:36:52,840
Or

3816
05:36:53,320 --> 05:36:55,520
They they still live there, but

3817
05:37:00,680 --> 05:37:03,840
This is what I mean, bro, what is this?

3818
05:37:09,160 --> 05:37:11,160
As you guys can see my face

3819
05:37:12,600 --> 05:37:15,800

05:37:20,720 --> 05:37:22,720

Oh, it's like hair. What's up with that? Why do you have hair on the edge of your sword?

3847
05:40:55,480 --> 05:40:58,920
Why does a giant lizard have a sword in the first place? How did you get the sword?

3848
05:40:59,160 --> 05:41:03,400
Who made you the sword? It looks like it was made of the tail of your brethren. I don't know if I like that

3849
05:41:03,680 --> 05:41:06,640
You know, I don't if I like that. That's kind of fucked up

3864
05:42:59,600 --> 05:43:03,800
Fuck you Alexander. Yeah, fuck you. You know, you know

3865
05:43:07,600 --> 05:43:12,280
Wondering if I should go back for the blood blood thing

3866
05:43:17,560 --> 05:43:19,560
I

3867
05:43:38,960 --> 05:43:40,960
Mean I was hoping you wouldn't notice me

3868
05:43:41,080 --> 05:43:43,080
I

3869
05:43:45,920 --> 05:43:51,560
Keep rolling rolling rolling walking rollin rollin rollin rollin come on

3870
05:44:03,800 --> 05:44:05,800
Get out of the way

3871
05:44:10,960 --> 05:44:12,960
I

3872
05:44:40,960 --> 05:44:42,960
I

3873
05:45:10,960 --> 05:45:12,960
I

3874
05:45:13,560 --> 05:45:15,560
I

3875
05:45:40,280 --> 05:45:42,280
Amazing actually I just but like

3876
05:45:42,960 --> 05:45:50,880
like 50 different bosses. I already beat the game twice. We're on New Game Plus 3 right now.

3877
05:45:52,080 --> 05:45:58,880
It's pretty sick. It's pretty awesome. Everybody's kind of amazed by my skills.

3878
05:45:58,880 --> 05:46:10,560
Oh, no. Jellyfish.

3879
05:46:10,560 --> 05:46:27,440
Oh, I'm killing my jellyfish too soon because when the jellyfish gets back into the corner,

3880
05:46:27,440 --> 05:46:39,440
I'm fucked. I'm dead. I don't know what number are we at. I don't know if I should even bother

3881
05:46:39,440 --> 05:46:47,920
with this anymore. Like I'm determined to, but I just don't think realistically I'm not high enough

3882
05:46:47,920 --> 05:46:55,120
level and I'm not enough skilled even if I was this level.

3883
05:47:39,440 --> 05:48:03,120
Oh, no. Why does he always attack when I summon him?

3884
05:48:10,000 --> 05:48:18,480
Because I need him to stack the lava. I don't want him to go back into the corner.

3885
05:48:19,760 --> 05:48:21,520
I mean, I'll stack the lava, stack the poison.

3886
05:48:24,720 --> 05:48:29,760
When can you fucking jump like that? I have not seen you do this fucking move, bitch.

3887
05:48:29,760 --> 05:48:41,440
You four? How dare you?

3888
05:48:41,440 --> 05:49:07,120
You don't get to whip around like that.

3889
05:49:12,320 --> 05:49:17,120
I can't use that pretty much either.

3890
05:49:27,120 --> 05:49:35,120
You done yet?

3891
05:49:35,600 --> 05:49:40,800
Come on, bro. You're not just killing me.

3892
05:49:40,800 --> 05:49:46,800
This is not a good run. I'm pressing the, like, oh.

3893
05:49:49,520 --> 05:49:54,800
Why don't you let me do a paneling for us?

3894
05:49:55,440 --> 05:50:00,960
Or do you be a dagger to help with the damage? Maybe.

3895
05:50:03,840 --> 05:50:04,960
I'm kind of determined.

3896
05:50:05,760 --> 05:50:13,760
Downloading the move set. Locking in.

3897
05:50:29,200 --> 05:50:31,840
It's all right. Back it up. Back it up.

3898
05:50:31,840 --> 05:50:37,040
Get up. Jump. Jump. Get out of here. Back up. Back up. Pull it back. It's fine.

3899
05:50:37,040 --> 05:50:39,280
We're good. Do a little ding-ling.

3900
05:50:47,120 --> 05:50:48,480
Yes. Yes.

3901
05:50:51,520 --> 05:50:51,920
It's all right.

3902
05:50:54,400 --> 05:50:56,560
Isn't there like supposed to be like a super thing I can do?

3903
05:50:58,080 --> 05:51:01,280
Like in his eye? I did try like that so many times.

3904
05:51:02,160 --> 05:51:05,680
I totally fucking jumped over that.

3905
05:51:09,520 --> 05:51:13,360
What? What? What, bitch? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do, bitch?

3906
05:51:14,240 --> 05:51:31,680
You're fucking the ass again. You're fucking the ass again.

3907
05:51:32,080 --> 05:51:43,680
Leave my jellyfish alone. He's just a little boy. My voice is cracking.

3908
05:51:43,680 --> 05:52:03,520
I'm in the eye. I gotta hit the glowy eye. I'm trying to hit the glowy eye.

3909
05:52:09,040 --> 05:52:11,520
I'm trying to. Oh no, you took him out.

3910
05:52:14,400 --> 05:52:25,520
No.

3911
05:52:30,560 --> 05:52:31,520
Oh, no.

3912
05:52:32,720 --> 05:52:41,520
All the wrong direction.

3913
05:52:43,680 --> 05:53:03,520
I'm trying to get him to charge.

3914
05:53:06,080 --> 05:53:11,520
What? He didn't even hit me with anything. He just walked up to me and I was supposed to hurt me.

3915
05:53:13,680 --> 05:53:25,520
Oh my god, I pressed the wrong button.

3916
05:53:25,520 --> 05:53:39,360
I don't remember what I just want to even have a quick blast.

3917
05:53:48,240 --> 05:53:52,560
No, no, no. I was hoping. Oh no, I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

3918
05:53:56,480 --> 05:54:04,720
Oh, the poison was doing work. The poison is doing work. It's but it's fine.

3919
05:54:05,760 --> 05:54:11,360
The more the closer and the closer I get to know I can do it just by brute forcing it.

3920
05:54:14,240 --> 05:54:17,920
Okay, but first, how the fuck do I poke him in the eye to get the extra damage?

3921
05:54:18,480 --> 05:54:27,040
I'm doing the charged heavy attack. It's not doing anything. I'm doing left trigger.

3922
05:54:28,160 --> 05:54:29,280
I have to light attack him.

3923
05:54:35,040 --> 05:54:38,720
Okay, I have to let R1 no charge.

3924
05:54:39,040 --> 05:54:49,520
Okay, okay, I'm okay. And I was screwed myself over by that because I didn't just not fucking paying attention.

3925
05:54:52,880 --> 05:54:54,720
I'm gonna do this right off the back early pop.

3926
05:54:55,680 --> 05:54:57,840
Oh, we got out of the way first.

3927
05:55:03,680 --> 05:55:05,840
Damn.

3928
05:55:05,840 --> 05:55:22,960
Did he already kill him? How the fuck?

3929
05:55:26,560 --> 05:55:28,960
I dodged that. Okay.

3930
05:55:36,640 --> 05:55:40,960
Yeah.

3931
05:55:45,600 --> 05:55:48,960
That doesn't even do a lot.

3932
05:55:54,480 --> 05:55:58,960
Oh, okay.

3933
05:55:58,960 --> 05:56:06,320
I have a little temper tantrum over here, bud.

3934
05:56:08,640 --> 05:56:14,000
Here, spin around. Oh, yeah, I saw that coming. I saw that spin coming.

3935
05:56:17,280 --> 05:56:24,160
I love a forgetful madam. That was better, though. If I can keep jellyfish alive to get that poison,

3936
05:56:24,880 --> 05:56:32,800
um, that I think I think I'm good. I think I'm good. I don't know how he died so fast.

3937
05:56:38,320 --> 05:56:45,200
If I get up real close to him, right off the river. No. No, be free.

3938
05:56:48,880 --> 05:56:49,840
I ate that for you.

3939
05:56:49,840 --> 05:56:55,600
Why are you throwing it at your time?

3940
05:56:59,680 --> 05:57:04,560
I can't really tell what's going on here. I don't know how to approach this situation.

3941
05:57:04,560 --> 05:57:09,760
I kind of, he's already fucking, he's doing this too fast.

3942
05:57:11,920 --> 05:57:17,280
Like, I'm kind of confused. He's like doing the magma thing a little bit too fast right off the rip.

3943
05:57:17,280 --> 05:57:19,280
And when he does that, it's a bad run.

3944
05:57:22,480 --> 05:57:26,960
You know? What the fuck am I kicking? Where did my fucking thing go?

3945
05:57:28,000 --> 05:57:33,120
I'm fucking kicking his ass. Fuckin' punch you. Fuckin' duff your ass. Fuckin' fuck you.

3946
05:57:35,200 --> 05:57:37,920
Yeah, why is he spamming lava? I don't know if that's fair to you yet.

3947
05:57:39,360 --> 05:57:40,640
Uh, well, no, I just started.

3948
05:57:41,600 --> 05:57:48,480
I'm getting warm. I'm like cold and warm at the same time.

3949
05:57:50,800 --> 05:57:56,720
Fuck you. Fuck you for that. Yeah, she could be helping me. Could be helping me, but no.

3950
05:58:02,320 --> 05:58:05,840
Okay, I'm gonna bait him. I'm gonna bait him. I'm gonna masturbate him. I'm gonna masturbate his ass.

3951
05:58:06,800 --> 05:58:13,120
No. No, you're supposed to attack me, you fuck. Get his ass. Get his ass.

3952
05:58:16,160 --> 05:58:19,520
Oh, no. I'm on fire. I'm on fire.

3953
05:58:26,080 --> 05:58:26,580
Okay.

3954
05:58:27,140 --> 05:58:27,640
Go.

3955
05:58:30,420 --> 05:58:32,340
I definitely dodge that, but go off this.

3956
05:58:36,100 --> 05:58:42,340
Stab his ass. Stab his ass. Stab his ass. Get stabbed. Die.

3957
05:58:42,340 --> 05:59:10,340
Alright, press a normal button.

3958
05:59:10,340 --> 05:59:11,340
There we go, there's that poison buildup.

3959
05:59:11,340 --> 05:59:34,340
He did well, he did well.

3960
05:59:34,340 --> 05:59:45,340
Fuck, I'm stuck, I'm rolling for all my life.

3961
05:59:46,340 --> 06:00:00,340
Stop, are you gonna stop?

3962
06:00:00,340 --> 06:00:11,340
I'm gonna raise up.

3963
06:00:11,340 --> 06:00:31,340
I can't let Jellyfish have that defeat.

3964
06:00:31,340 --> 06:00:53,340
Where am I?

3965
06:01:01,340 --> 06:01:27,340
Damn.

3966
06:01:32,340 --> 06:01:36,340
Damn, that sucked.

3967
06:01:36,340 --> 06:01:39,340
I thought that was a good run.

3968
06:01:39,340 --> 06:01:41,340
That was good, I like that, I'm proud of myself.

3969
06:01:41,340 --> 06:01:42,340
Thank you guys.

3970
06:01:42,340 --> 06:01:46,340
Kinda looks like a bearded dragon with a sword, that's what everybody else was saying.

3971
06:01:46,340 --> 06:02:13,340
How about you, I see my Jellyfish, he's really neat, he's just a little guy.

3972
06:02:13,340 --> 06:02:19,340
Oh he's almost gonna be dead already, this is a bad run, I'm gonna kill myself.

3973
06:02:19,340 --> 06:02:20,340
This is a bad run.

3974
06:02:20,340 --> 06:02:28,340
The moment I know that he is too low health because this dude magma runs him into the fucking ground, it's not a good run.

3975
06:02:28,340 --> 06:02:32,340
I need that poison to build and it's not building.

3976
06:02:32,340 --> 06:02:38,340
If the poison builds and I get the combos, then yeah.

3977
06:02:38,340 --> 06:02:43,340
It's gotta be 20, it probably is 20.

3978
06:02:43,340 --> 06:02:46,340
I'm not gonna get it in 30, I'm not gonna get it in 30.

3979
06:02:46,340 --> 06:02:54,340
I was pretty confident it was.

3980
06:02:54,340 --> 06:02:57,340
Yeah, eyes on me buddy, eyes on me.

3981
06:02:57,340 --> 06:03:00,340
Why do I have this equipped?

3982
06:03:00,340 --> 06:03:01,340
Why?

3983
06:03:01,340 --> 06:03:03,340
Give me the leg, that's what I wanted.

3984
06:03:03,340 --> 06:03:09,340
Oh no, that's fine, that's fine.

3985
06:03:09,340 --> 06:03:16,340
Jellyfish bro you gotta move, oh my god.

3986
06:03:16,340 --> 06:03:28,340
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

3987
06:03:28,340 --> 06:03:36,340
I legit almost just threw my controller there.

3988
06:03:36,340 --> 06:03:41,340
That's what, I literally almost spiked my fucking controller at that one.

3989
06:03:41,340 --> 06:03:48,340
Raina no.

3990
06:03:48,340 --> 06:03:54,340
Raina mama's getting angry, she probably senses my anger, she's like I will calm you down.

3991
06:03:54,340 --> 06:04:00,340
You're doing great sweetie, I'm determined.

3992
06:04:00,340 --> 06:04:04,340
Taking off my fucking clothes, sweating.

3993
06:04:04,340 --> 06:04:12,340
You're doing so well but I'm not, why are you guys lying to me?

3994
06:04:12,340 --> 06:04:37,340
What the fuck, I didn't know there was lava there.

3995
06:04:37,340 --> 06:04:57,340
You think cause it's floating that it wouldn't really be affected by this shit, but it does.

3996
06:04:57,340 --> 06:05:12,340
You think that because it's floating the lava wouldn't really touch it, but it does.

3997
06:05:13,340 --> 06:05:28,340
It killed me.

3998
06:05:28,340 --> 06:05:40,340
I'm tempted to try to get the, I think I'm gonna try to get, actually no I'll stop trying

3999
06:05:40,340 --> 06:05:42,340
then we can hit the third when we hit 30 else.

4000
06:05:42,340 --> 06:05:58,340
I'll go and try to see if I get the Bloodhounds Fang so I can fuck this dude up so I can get the Moon Veal.

4001
06:05:58,340 --> 06:06:03,340
See right off the rip I know it's a bad run when he does this immediately.

4002
06:06:03,340 --> 06:06:06,340
I think it's because of my proximity to him.

4003
06:06:06,340 --> 06:06:15,340
It triggers it.

4004
06:06:15,340 --> 06:06:17,340
Why?

4005
06:06:17,340 --> 06:06:18,340
Since when do you do that?

4006
06:06:18,340 --> 06:06:31,340
You've done that twice and it doesn't make any sense to me.

4007
06:06:31,340 --> 06:06:41,340
He's styling on me now.

4008
06:06:41,340 --> 06:06:48,340
I know he's stuck his little sword in his mouth and was like, you bet he dooduh.

4009
06:06:48,340 --> 06:06:50,340
Hello?

4010
06:06:50,340 --> 06:06:54,340
We're both gonna eat that actually.

4011
06:06:54,340 --> 06:06:55,340
I'm actually might gonna die.

4012
06:06:55,340 --> 06:06:56,340
It's fine.

4013
06:06:57,340 --> 06:06:59,340
It doesn't matter.

4014
06:06:59,340 --> 06:07:05,340
I would have died anyways if I got the right one or not.

4015
06:07:05,340 --> 06:07:09,340
Yeah, you get him Jellyfish.

4016
06:07:09,340 --> 06:07:11,340
Nine damage.

4017
06:07:11,340 --> 06:07:13,340
That's a lot of damage.

4018
06:07:13,340 --> 06:07:14,340
We're getting there.

4019
06:07:14,340 --> 06:07:16,340
I don't know about that.

4020
06:07:16,340 --> 06:07:23,340
Sorry, I'm tired.

4021
06:07:23,340 --> 06:07:29,340
I don't know, I had this fucking clip too.

4022
06:07:29,340 --> 06:07:31,340
Immediately when I summon that he...

4023
06:07:31,340 --> 06:07:32,340
Okay, good.

4024
06:07:32,340 --> 06:07:33,340
That's fine.

4025
06:07:33,340 --> 06:07:38,340
I would rather...

4026
06:07:38,340 --> 06:07:40,340
No, don't kill him.

4027
06:07:40,340 --> 06:07:41,340
Turn around.

4028
06:07:41,340 --> 06:07:42,340
Turn around to me.

4029
06:07:42,340 --> 06:07:44,340
Reina, this is not the time.

4030
06:07:44,340 --> 06:07:47,340
I love you, but stop.

4031
06:07:47,340 --> 06:07:50,340
Oh, there you go.

4032
06:07:50,340 --> 06:07:53,340
You're gonna kill me here, Reina.

4033
06:07:53,340 --> 06:07:59,340
I can't even see my stats.

4034
06:07:59,340 --> 06:08:04,340
She's just rubbing against my plant.

4035
06:08:04,340 --> 06:08:05,340
I don't know.

4036
06:08:05,340 --> 06:08:06,340
Reina.

4037
06:08:06,340 --> 06:08:09,340
Reina, please.

4038
06:08:09,340 --> 06:08:11,340
I love you so much.

4039
06:08:11,340 --> 06:08:13,340
No idea, but...

4040
06:08:13,340 --> 06:08:15,340
I'm doing stuff right now.

4041
06:08:15,340 --> 06:08:22,340
I snuggle with you all morning.

4042
06:08:22,340 --> 06:08:23,340
What's up?

4043
06:08:23,340 --> 06:08:27,340
You rumbling?

4044
06:08:27,340 --> 06:08:31,340
Are you trying to calm me down because I'm getting aggravated?

4045
06:08:31,340 --> 06:08:34,340
Are you trying to calm me, Reina?

4046
06:08:34,340 --> 06:08:36,340
You sense my...

4047
06:08:36,340 --> 06:08:41,340
You sense my stress.

4048
06:08:41,340 --> 06:08:50,340
Sometimes you just need a cat hug.

4049
06:08:50,340 --> 06:08:52,340
Reina actually is very much in tune to my emotions.

4050
06:08:52,340 --> 06:08:56,340
If I am very upset, she will immediately...

4051
06:08:56,340 --> 06:09:00,340
I think that's why she was kind of stuck to me this, like, yesterday.

4052
06:09:00,340 --> 06:09:03,340
It's because, like, since I was sick, she was...

4053
06:09:03,340 --> 06:09:10,340
I would, like, take a nap, and she was there, and I'd wake up, she was there.

4054
06:09:10,340 --> 06:09:13,340
If I was doing anything, she would just be there.

4055
06:09:13,340 --> 06:09:16,340
She's my baby girl.

4056
06:09:16,340 --> 06:09:24,340
Okay.

4057
06:09:24,340 --> 06:09:28,340
You wanna dance with the devil?

4058
06:09:28,340 --> 06:09:31,340
Let's dance.

4059
06:09:31,340 --> 06:09:39,340
What is this attack?

4060
06:09:39,340 --> 06:09:42,340
He already killed my jellyfish.

4061
06:09:42,340 --> 06:09:43,340
I should just leave.

4062
06:09:43,340 --> 06:09:45,340
Can I leave? Can I go?

4063
06:09:45,340 --> 06:09:49,340
We just...

4064
06:09:49,340 --> 06:09:52,340
It's no fair.

4065
06:09:52,340 --> 06:09:54,340
I don't like it here.

4066
06:09:54,340 --> 06:09:57,340
Let me go through the pee fog.

4067
06:09:57,340 --> 06:09:58,340
Reina, is your familiar?

4068
06:09:58,340 --> 06:10:01,340
Oh, yes, of course.

4069
06:10:01,340 --> 06:10:04,340
Actually, her sister was, like, my familiar.

4070
06:10:04,340 --> 06:10:05,340
She'd always sit with me.

4071
06:10:05,340 --> 06:10:09,340
Her sister, Solea, was sit with me when I would tear out cards.

4072
06:10:09,340 --> 06:10:15,340
Her sister died, uh, about, like, three years ago?

4073
06:10:15,340 --> 06:10:18,340
Yeah, four.

4074
06:10:18,340 --> 06:10:20,340
Sweet. She was a seal point same as Cat.

4075
06:10:20,340 --> 06:10:27,340
Her name was Solea. She was adorable.

4076
06:10:27,340 --> 06:10:29,340
I liked her, because she was, like, Reina's, like, clearly my cat,

4077
06:10:29,340 --> 06:10:34,340
but Solea was, like, everybody's cat in my family.

4078
06:10:34,340 --> 06:10:48,340
Why am I not dancing?

4079
06:10:48,340 --> 06:10:54,340
I'm, like, trying to get to its...

4080
06:10:54,340 --> 06:10:57,340
Oh, the fire got me.

4081
06:10:57,340 --> 06:11:02,340
It was actually going fine, because the jellyfish was doing okay.

4082
06:11:02,340 --> 06:11:07,340
Might have been a good run if I didn't get knocked into the fire.

4083
06:11:07,340 --> 06:11:09,340
There was a second Reina?

4084
06:11:09,340 --> 06:11:11,340
Yeah, her sister.

4085
06:11:11,340 --> 06:11:14,340
Her sister reminds me a lot of Fia and Boomi,

4086
06:11:14,340 --> 06:11:21,340
and I like to think that she lives on in them with very similar personalities.

4087
06:11:21,340 --> 06:11:24,340
It's quite funny.

4088
06:11:24,340 --> 06:11:29,340
Okay, if I do him over here, he doesn't seem to get...

4089
06:11:29,340 --> 06:11:40,340
I'm locked in.

4090
06:11:40,340 --> 06:11:44,340
I don't know what you're spitting at, girl.

4091
06:11:44,340 --> 06:11:46,340
Get out of the way, jellyfish.

4092
06:11:46,340 --> 06:11:50,340
I don't know why you're standing there.

4093
06:11:50,340 --> 06:11:52,340
Can you dodge, jellyfish?

4094
06:11:52,340 --> 06:11:55,340
Oh, I can't hit. That's for sure.

4095
06:11:55,340 --> 06:12:10,340
I rolled. I pressed roll, but I was locked in.

4096
06:12:10,340 --> 06:12:23,340
I'm stabbing you, the gluay guy, sort of dog.

4097
06:12:23,340 --> 06:12:36,340
That gives him a little bit of time to build that.

4098
06:12:36,340 --> 06:12:39,340
Poisoned build, so we're fine.

4099
06:12:39,340 --> 06:12:59,340
That's what I wanted. Maybe I should just pay back and let the poison build.

4100
06:13:00,340 --> 06:13:02,340
He done? Like, what is...?

4101
06:13:02,340 --> 06:13:04,340
Oh, my God.

4102
06:13:29,340 --> 06:13:34,340
Computer is struggling right now.

4103
06:13:34,340 --> 06:13:39,340
What is this? Why do you keep spamming the same fucking attack, dude?

4104
06:13:39,340 --> 06:13:44,340
Oh, my God, I'm stuck.

4105
06:13:44,340 --> 06:13:50,340
I don't understand that.

4106
06:13:50,340 --> 06:14:05,340
I'm going to spam attack, you can spam attack, I want that.

4107
06:14:05,340 --> 06:14:13,340
I'm going to attempt to just run in circles and let the fucking poison get him.

4108
06:14:13,340 --> 06:14:26,340
Kind of wishing I had the dragon's breath.

4109
06:14:26,340 --> 06:14:55,340
Sometimes it just locks onto his head and I'm kind of frustrated by that.

4110
06:14:55,340 --> 06:14:57,340
Oh, my God.

4111
06:15:25,340 --> 06:15:27,340
Locked in.

4112
06:15:55,340 --> 06:15:57,340
Oh, my God.

4113
06:16:25,340 --> 06:16:52,340
Oh, I thought I jumped out of the way.

4114
06:16:52,340 --> 06:16:55,340
That's the fucking karma, dude.

4115
06:16:55,340 --> 06:17:02,340
You see it messing up my attacks because I try to lock on, but it just...

4116
06:17:02,340 --> 06:17:07,340
Yeah.

4117
06:17:07,340 --> 06:17:10,340
I don't...

4118
06:17:10,340 --> 06:17:12,340
It's so weird.

4119
06:17:12,340 --> 06:17:14,340
I hate that I'm angled.

4120
06:17:14,340 --> 06:17:17,340
I don't like that the point just always attacks his head.

4121
06:17:17,340 --> 06:17:20,340
I'm trying to go for his leg and then it just pulls him.

4122
06:17:20,340 --> 06:17:25,340
It pulls it and it makes it go for his head.

4123
06:17:25,340 --> 06:17:31,340
Yeah, S-Talk has an issue.

4124
06:17:31,340 --> 06:17:36,340
I never really use a piercing weapon for that reason.

4125
06:17:36,340 --> 06:17:38,340
Come over here, come over here.

4126
06:17:38,340 --> 06:17:40,340
No, no, no, no, no.

4127
06:17:40,340 --> 06:17:42,340
You better come over fucking here, bro.

4128
06:17:42,340 --> 06:17:44,340
You better fucking come over here.

4129
06:18:13,340 --> 06:18:17,340
Great, how am I supposed to get to a fucking eye like this, huh?

4130
06:18:17,340 --> 06:18:20,340
Oh, wow, that's fucking great, isn't it?

4131
06:18:20,340 --> 06:18:22,340
I love that for me.

4132
06:18:22,340 --> 06:18:34,340
I love that so much for me.

4133
06:18:34,340 --> 06:18:37,340
Better do it again.

4134
06:18:37,340 --> 06:18:44,340
I better fucking do it again, I swear to God.

4135
06:18:44,340 --> 06:18:47,340
That's so dumb.

4136
06:18:47,340 --> 06:18:49,340
That's so dumb.

4137
06:18:49,340 --> 06:18:51,340
Did you see that?

4138
06:18:51,340 --> 06:18:55,340
How the fuck am I supposed to get to the spot if it's the fucking flames right in the way, dude?

4139
06:18:55,340 --> 06:18:58,340
Oh, my fucking god, bro.

4140
06:18:58,340 --> 06:19:06,340
Holy shit.

4141
06:19:06,340 --> 06:19:08,340
I'm enthusiastic, she viewers me.

4142
06:19:08,340 --> 06:19:18,340
She's going to pull the fucking flames immediately, immediately, immediately when I summon.

4143
06:19:18,340 --> 06:19:19,340
You hear this?

4144
06:19:19,340 --> 06:19:24,340
It's me gripping the fucking of my controller right now.

4145
06:19:24,340 --> 06:19:29,340
There's a muffin, it's really funny.

4146
06:19:29,340 --> 06:19:30,340
I'm going to kill him for you.

4147
06:19:30,340 --> 06:19:32,340
No, where's the fun in that?

4148
06:19:32,340 --> 06:19:33,340
Where's the fun in that?

4149
06:19:33,340 --> 06:19:36,340
I don't want anybody doing anything for me unless they ask.

4150
06:19:36,340 --> 06:19:42,340
I want to do this for myself because I'm going to feel so fucking good, so full of dopamine after I finish this.

4151
06:19:42,340 --> 06:19:44,340
Because I'm going to beat him.

4152
06:19:44,340 --> 06:19:48,340
I'm going to beat him.

4153
06:19:48,340 --> 06:19:53,340
It's not worth it, it's not worth it to you, it's worth it to me.

4154
06:19:53,340 --> 06:19:58,340
This is just, I'm sorry, I'm determined, this is how I game.

4155
06:19:58,340 --> 06:20:02,340
When I'm determined, I want to beat, I'll see something through.

4156
06:20:02,340 --> 06:20:06,340
And you know, I wanted to get to 30.

4157
06:20:06,340 --> 06:20:08,340
I think I'm at, I don't know if I'm at 30.

4158
06:20:08,340 --> 06:20:12,340
Let me know how many times have I died.

4159
06:20:12,340 --> 06:20:18,340
Because if I'm at 30, I'm going to go try to get the bloodhounds back because I want the moon veil.

4160
06:20:18,340 --> 06:20:21,340
I'm at 46, legit.

4161
06:20:21,340 --> 06:20:24,340
Okay, I'll do one more run.

4162
06:20:24,340 --> 06:20:27,340
And then I'm going to go, I'm going to do something else.

4163
06:20:27,340 --> 06:20:30,340
Uh, what am I doing?

4164
06:20:30,340 --> 06:20:32,340
Alright.

4165
06:20:42,340 --> 06:20:44,340
I love that.

4166
06:20:54,340 --> 06:20:59,340
Oh, oh, you're a little saucy boy, aren't you, with your little dive?

4167
06:20:59,340 --> 06:21:01,340
Aren't you cute.

4168
06:21:03,340 --> 06:21:05,340
I'm going to do it again.

4169
06:21:09,340 --> 06:21:12,340
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

4170
06:21:13,340 --> 06:21:15,340
Huh.

4171
06:21:21,340 --> 06:21:24,340
We're just opening over here.

4172
06:21:27,340 --> 06:21:31,340
There's always like a little opening left behind.

4173
06:21:31,340 --> 06:21:34,340
What is the worm weak against, by the way?

4174
06:21:34,340 --> 06:21:37,340
I should have, I should have fucking figured that out.

4175
06:21:43,340 --> 06:21:45,340
Right on cue.

4176
06:21:50,340 --> 06:21:52,340
It's fine.

4177
06:21:58,340 --> 06:22:00,340
I'm always in fire, I can't get him.

4178
06:22:00,340 --> 06:22:03,340
He's like that, oh, he's dog piling my fucking dude.

4179
06:22:05,340 --> 06:22:07,340
Yeah, like I can't.

4180
06:22:12,340 --> 06:22:14,340
Okay.

4181
06:22:24,340 --> 06:22:27,340
Can I stop aiming at his fucking head?

4182
06:22:29,340 --> 06:22:31,340
Oh, it's so dumb.

4183
06:22:34,340 --> 06:22:36,340
I love how differently you and strong you play this game.

4184
06:22:36,340 --> 06:22:38,340
What do you mean?

4185
06:22:43,340 --> 06:22:46,340
She really gets as many times as her age.

4186
06:22:49,340 --> 06:22:53,340
No, wait, I need to read what the fuck you guys are saying.

4187
06:23:00,340 --> 06:23:02,340
I'm in solar style.

4188
06:23:02,340 --> 06:23:04,340
This box is versus everything.

4189
06:23:04,340 --> 06:23:07,340
You're right, I think I remember, I think I remember that.

4190
06:23:07,340 --> 06:23:09,340
Excuse me.

4191
06:23:13,340 --> 06:23:16,340
I'm 56, guys.

4192
06:23:16,340 --> 06:23:19,340
I'm 56, you guys know this.

4193
06:23:19,340 --> 06:23:21,340
That was weak.

4194
06:23:23,340 --> 06:23:27,340
I keep sitting down like it's fucking Liza P and that I don't need that.

4195
06:23:27,340 --> 06:23:30,340
Oh, I'm in the fucking, no.

4196
06:23:31,340 --> 06:23:33,340
Oh, I have to be.

4197
06:23:33,340 --> 06:23:35,340
I can't teleport out.

4198
06:23:35,340 --> 06:23:37,340
I have to walk out.

4199
06:23:37,340 --> 06:23:39,340
Okay, that's fine.

4200
06:23:42,340 --> 06:23:44,340
Okay.

4201
06:23:49,340 --> 06:23:52,340
I wanted to play for longer, but I can feel myself getting a migraine.

4202
06:23:55,340 --> 06:23:58,340
I forget, where was that jail?

4203
06:24:00,340 --> 06:24:02,340
Oh my god, where was it?

4204
06:24:02,340 --> 06:24:04,340
I don't know.

4205
06:24:10,340 --> 06:24:12,340
I totally forgot it's over here.

4206
06:24:21,340 --> 06:24:23,340
Oh, you don't sound like you're 56.

4207
06:24:23,340 --> 06:24:25,340
Yeah, I'm 56, bro.

4208
06:24:25,340 --> 06:24:27,340
I'm pretty old.

4209
06:24:27,340 --> 06:24:29,340
You don't like your hag?

4210
06:24:29,340 --> 06:24:31,340
I'm like, yeah, I'm a fucking hag.

4211
06:24:33,340 --> 06:24:35,340
Uh...

4212
06:24:41,340 --> 06:24:44,340
Sorry to put Rena on the floor again because she's...

4213
06:24:50,340 --> 06:24:53,340
She's trying to jump up on me.

4214
06:24:57,340 --> 06:24:59,340
I wish I could see.

4215
06:25:03,340 --> 06:25:05,340
How many markers did I have?

4216
06:25:08,340 --> 06:25:10,340
Okay, just that one.

4217
06:25:15,340 --> 06:25:17,340
Have Blive help?

4218
06:25:17,340 --> 06:25:19,340
No, I don't need Blive help.

4219
06:25:21,340 --> 06:25:24,340
I will ask for help when I want it.

4220
06:25:25,340 --> 06:25:28,340
Ugh, I'm going to start ignoring people if they're like,

4221
06:25:28,340 --> 06:25:30,340
let me help or you should do this to do it.

4222
06:25:30,340 --> 06:25:33,340
I'm doing it by myself the way I want to do it.

4223
06:25:33,340 --> 06:25:36,340
If I need help, I will ask.

4224
06:25:36,340 --> 06:25:38,340
It's that simple.

4225
06:25:45,340 --> 06:25:47,340
I'm always in my prime, indeed.

4226
06:25:48,340 --> 06:25:50,340
Maybe I can use a jellyfish on this, dude.

4227
06:25:56,340 --> 06:25:58,340
Oh, I'm going to need to do that.

4228
06:26:06,340 --> 06:26:08,340
Alright.

4229
06:26:08,340 --> 06:26:10,340
Okay.

4230
06:26:10,340 --> 06:26:12,340
Okay.

4231
06:26:12,340 --> 06:26:14,340
Alright, I'm pressing breathe.

4232
06:26:15,340 --> 06:26:17,340
Come on, my nose is itchy.

4233
06:26:20,340 --> 06:26:22,340
My nose is itchy, please.

4234
06:26:34,340 --> 06:26:37,340
Let me carry you, Queen. No more.

4235
06:26:38,340 --> 06:26:40,340
I think that's what I said.

4236
06:26:45,340 --> 06:26:47,340
He got that dog in him.

4237
06:26:53,340 --> 06:26:55,340
What does it count?

4238
06:26:55,340 --> 06:26:57,340
It she does.

4239
06:26:57,340 --> 06:26:59,340
I don't get it sleeping.

4240
06:26:59,340 --> 06:27:01,340
So none of these count, Raina.

4241
06:27:01,340 --> 06:27:03,340
Please stop.

4242
06:27:03,340 --> 06:27:05,340
Why don't you go lay down, Raina?

4243
06:27:05,340 --> 06:27:07,340
I don't want to have to put you in the crate.

4244
06:27:07,340 --> 06:27:09,340
You're moving around too much.

4245
06:27:09,340 --> 06:27:12,340
I don't want you reopening your little thing in the water.

4246
06:27:13,340 --> 06:27:15,340
That's a spry lady at 14.

4247
06:27:21,340 --> 06:27:24,340
I felt like I was going to do something before this.

4248
06:27:28,340 --> 06:27:30,340
Are they trying to give me an intervention?

4249
06:27:30,340 --> 06:27:32,340
That's stupid.

4250
06:27:32,340 --> 06:27:34,340
I can't use a summoning thing for this.

4251
06:27:34,340 --> 06:27:36,340
That's stupid.

4252
06:27:36,340 --> 06:27:38,340
Can I? No.

4253
06:27:38,340 --> 06:27:40,340
Alright.

4254
06:27:40,340 --> 06:27:42,340
Me and you, Darwin.

4255
06:27:42,340 --> 06:27:44,340
Oh, shit.

4256
06:27:44,340 --> 06:27:46,340
Well, this is awkward.

4257
06:27:46,340 --> 06:27:48,340
I just wanted to be friends.

4258
06:27:48,340 --> 06:27:50,340
I heard you had that dog in you,

4259
06:27:50,340 --> 06:27:52,340
and I was just wondering if you

4260
06:27:52,340 --> 06:27:54,340
wanted to put that dog in me too.

4261
06:27:54,340 --> 06:27:56,340
What the fuck am I saying, bro?

4262
06:27:58,340 --> 06:28:00,340
I can't hit you. You're too fast.

4263
06:28:00,340 --> 06:28:02,340
I think I had blood loss.

4264
06:28:12,340 --> 06:28:14,340
Sheebie! Oh my god, it's Freddie!

4265
06:28:14,340 --> 06:28:16,340
Everybody!

4266
06:28:16,340 --> 06:28:18,340
Sheebie, Ola. It's me, Funtime Freddie,

4267
06:28:18,340 --> 06:28:20,340
and welcome to Elton...

4268
06:28:20,340 --> 06:28:22,340
Trat is going by too fast. I can't read it.

4269
06:28:22,340 --> 06:28:24,340
Hold on.

4270
06:28:24,340 --> 06:28:26,340
I have to start over.

4271
06:28:26,340 --> 06:28:28,340
Sheebie, Ola.

4272
06:28:28,340 --> 06:28:30,340
It's me, Funtime Freddie,

4273
06:28:30,340 --> 06:28:32,340
and welcome to Elton Ring Special Edition

4274
06:28:32,340 --> 06:28:34,340
and Diamond Edition.

4275
06:28:34,340 --> 06:28:36,340
Thank you, Freddie.

4276
06:28:36,340 --> 06:28:38,340
Somebody said no profile picture?

4277
06:28:38,340 --> 06:28:40,340
I want to see what the profile picture is.

4278
06:28:40,340 --> 06:28:42,340
Go to channel.

4279
06:28:46,340 --> 06:28:48,340
That's pretty sick.

4280
06:28:48,340 --> 06:28:50,340
That's pretty gnarly.

4281
06:28:50,340 --> 06:28:52,340
I like it.

4282
06:28:56,340 --> 06:28:58,340
I like it.

4283
06:29:02,340 --> 06:29:04,340
Sheebie, get up the furry allegations, please.

4284
06:29:04,340 --> 06:29:06,340
You know, Toma is trying to teach me

4285
06:29:06,340 --> 06:29:08,340
just to embrace being a furry.

4286
06:29:08,340 --> 06:29:10,340
I'm still resistant.

4287
06:29:10,340 --> 06:29:12,340
But, you know...

4288
06:29:12,340 --> 06:29:14,340
Maybe I'll get some,

4289
06:29:14,340 --> 06:29:16,340
you know, sweet furry lovers

4290
06:29:16,340 --> 06:29:18,340
in my audience.

4291
06:29:18,340 --> 06:29:20,340
You know how that can be.

4292
06:29:26,340 --> 06:29:28,340
Diamond Edition? Yes, Diamond Edition.

4293
06:29:28,340 --> 06:29:30,340
Don't doubt

4294
06:29:30,340 --> 06:29:32,340
what Freddie says, bro.

4295
06:29:32,340 --> 06:29:34,340
Okay?

4296
06:29:38,340 --> 06:29:40,340
Now it'll attack.

4297
06:29:40,340 --> 06:29:42,340
Attract.

4298
06:29:42,340 --> 06:29:44,340
What is that?

4299
06:29:44,340 --> 06:29:46,340
Explain. Just beat Mogue.

4300
06:29:46,340 --> 06:29:48,340
Nice job!

4301
06:29:48,340 --> 06:29:50,340
Good on you, bro.

4302
06:29:50,340 --> 06:29:52,340
Furry Oilers?

4303
06:29:52,340 --> 06:29:54,340
There are furry Oilers?

4304
06:29:54,340 --> 06:29:56,340
I'm sorry, that's a funny concept to me.

4305
06:29:56,340 --> 06:29:58,340
Furries do have a lot of money.

4306
06:30:02,340 --> 06:30:04,340
Because I got lots of good art.

4307
06:30:04,340 --> 06:30:06,340
My friend paid off her college tuition

4308
06:30:06,340 --> 06:30:08,340
with just making very sexy art.

4309
06:30:10,340 --> 06:30:12,340
Hola, chica.

4310
06:30:14,340 --> 06:30:16,340
Oh, you're weak against this.

4311
06:30:20,340 --> 06:30:22,340
You're very weak against this.

4312
06:30:24,340 --> 06:30:26,340
Ow.

4313
06:30:26,340 --> 06:30:28,340
I see to stay alive.

4314
06:30:30,340 --> 06:30:32,340
Oh, I see to stay alive!

4315
06:30:54,340 --> 06:30:56,340
Ow.

4316
06:31:02,340 --> 06:31:04,340
Oh, I'm so close.

4317
06:31:06,340 --> 06:31:08,340
No, no, no, no.

4318
06:31:16,340 --> 06:31:18,340
Okay, okay, this is easy.

4319
06:31:18,340 --> 06:31:20,340
This is easy, guys.

4320
06:31:20,340 --> 06:31:22,340
I can do this one. You guys see how well I dodge.

4321
06:31:22,340 --> 06:31:24,340
Aren't you impressed with my dodging ability?

4322
06:31:26,340 --> 06:31:28,340
I'm very good at dodger.

4323
06:31:32,340 --> 06:31:34,340
Never knew.

4324
06:31:34,340 --> 06:31:36,340
Wait, Muppets are considered furries?

4325
06:31:36,340 --> 06:31:38,340
All right, guys, I'm a furry.

4326
06:31:40,340 --> 06:31:42,340
You hear her first.

4327
06:31:42,340 --> 06:31:44,340
Shibi, furry.

4328
06:31:46,340 --> 06:31:48,340
Easy clap, easy clap, easy clap, easy clap, bro.

4329
06:31:48,340 --> 06:31:50,340
Easy peasy.

4330
06:31:50,340 --> 06:31:52,340
I really forgot he was weak to magic shit.

4331
06:31:58,340 --> 06:32:00,340
Does any furry want to be my sugar daddy?

4332
06:32:00,340 --> 06:32:02,340
I have cat medical bills to pay.

4333
06:32:12,340 --> 06:32:14,340
Oh, that would miss him.

4334
06:32:14,340 --> 06:32:16,340
I'm trying to keep him, like, here.

4335
06:32:16,340 --> 06:32:18,340
Oh, every time I heal,

4336
06:32:18,340 --> 06:32:20,340
I literally have to do it in, like, one run.

4337
06:32:28,340 --> 06:32:30,340
Why roll into that one?

4338
06:32:48,340 --> 06:32:50,340
Come out.

4339
06:32:50,340 --> 06:32:52,340
Oh, I just noticed that.

4340
06:33:12,340 --> 06:33:14,340
Come on.

4341
06:33:14,340 --> 06:33:16,340
Oh, fuck, I was getting too eager.

4342
06:33:16,340 --> 06:33:18,340
I thought I was going to kill him.

4343
06:33:24,340 --> 06:33:26,340
There we go.

4344
06:33:26,340 --> 06:33:28,340
Hand over your fucking sword.

4345
06:33:28,340 --> 06:33:30,340
Thank you.

4346
06:33:30,340 --> 06:33:32,340
I need that. Appreciate it.

4347
06:33:36,340 --> 06:33:38,340
Let's fucking go.

4348
06:33:38,340 --> 06:33:40,340
See, when I'm not fucking over-leveled,

4349
06:33:40,340 --> 06:33:42,340
I mean, under-leveled,

4350
06:33:42,340 --> 06:33:44,340
for like a dude, I can usually get them.

4351
06:33:46,340 --> 06:33:48,340
So proud of me. Thank you.

4352
06:33:48,340 --> 06:33:50,340
Thank you, guys. I killed something.

4353
06:33:52,340 --> 06:33:54,340
I did it.

4354
06:33:54,340 --> 06:33:56,340
That's why he wasn't trying to dodge.

4355
06:33:56,340 --> 06:33:58,340
Well, him, like, dodging is different.

4356
06:34:00,340 --> 06:34:02,340
I don't know if this

4357
06:34:04,340 --> 06:34:06,340
scales properly.

4358
06:34:06,340 --> 06:34:08,340
I need more strength.

4359
06:34:12,340 --> 06:34:14,340
I fucking love this shit.

4360
06:34:14,340 --> 06:34:16,340
Oh, it's so fucking sexy.

4361
06:34:20,340 --> 06:34:22,340
Oh, fuck it.

4362
06:34:22,340 --> 06:34:24,340
Oh, yes, daddy.

4363
06:34:24,340 --> 06:34:26,340
Sorry.

4364
06:34:26,340 --> 06:34:28,340
All right.

4365
06:34:30,340 --> 06:34:32,340
Cool.

4366
06:34:32,340 --> 06:34:34,340
Nice.

4367
06:34:34,340 --> 06:34:36,340
Noink. Wow.

4368
06:34:36,340 --> 06:34:38,340
A whole zero runes.

4369
06:34:44,340 --> 06:34:46,340
Thank you, Madika.

4370
06:34:46,340 --> 06:34:48,340
I'll be taking this sword.

4371
06:34:50,340 --> 06:34:52,340
And I'll be taking- I forget

4372
06:34:52,340 --> 06:34:54,340
I don't need to go to a grace to teleport.

4373
06:34:54,340 --> 06:34:56,340
I'm such a fucking-

4374
06:34:58,340 --> 06:35:00,340
All right, let's see.

4375
06:35:02,340 --> 06:35:04,340
If this helps.

4376
06:35:04,340 --> 06:35:06,340
Why do you look like a Muppet?

4377
06:35:06,340 --> 06:35:08,340
I don't know why the fuck do you look like a Muppet?

4378
06:35:08,340 --> 06:35:10,340
Fucking Julio Passos. Fuck you.

4379
06:35:10,340 --> 06:35:12,340
Get out of here.

4380
06:35:14,340 --> 06:35:16,340
I'm sorry.

4381
06:35:16,340 --> 06:35:18,340
I'm over-tired.

4382
06:35:22,340 --> 06:35:24,340
I'm raging at a game.

4383
06:35:24,340 --> 06:35:26,340
It's not the fucking time.

4384
06:35:26,340 --> 06:35:28,340
All right.

4385
06:35:28,340 --> 06:35:30,340
Yeah.

4386
06:35:30,340 --> 06:35:32,340
Doxic is effort.

4387
06:35:32,340 --> 06:35:34,340
Do you have enough strength to wield that even two-handed?

4388
06:35:34,340 --> 06:35:36,340
Yeah.

4389
06:35:36,340 --> 06:35:38,340
All right.

4390
06:35:44,340 --> 06:35:46,340
Because my strength is at like 12

4391
06:35:46,340 --> 06:35:48,340
and you need 15.

4392
06:35:48,340 --> 06:35:50,340
Oh fuck, it's at 11.

4393
06:35:50,340 --> 06:35:52,340
That's fine.

4394
06:35:52,340 --> 06:35:54,340
We'll find out.

4395
06:35:54,340 --> 06:35:56,340
We'll find out.

4396
06:35:56,340 --> 06:35:58,340
Let's go.

4397
06:36:02,340 --> 06:36:04,340
Can I get a Hoyah?

4398
06:36:06,340 --> 06:36:08,340
Yah.

4399
06:36:08,340 --> 06:36:10,340
Come on.

4400
06:36:10,340 --> 06:36:12,340
No.

4401
06:36:12,340 --> 06:36:14,340
Oh fuck, this is worse.

4402
06:36:18,340 --> 06:36:20,340
I like this one because you can

4403
06:36:20,340 --> 06:36:22,340
jump away.

4404
06:36:22,340 --> 06:36:24,340
Oh god, what is this?

4405
06:36:24,340 --> 06:36:26,340
I think I need more strength, guys.

4406
06:36:26,340 --> 06:36:28,340
I'm stuck.

4407
06:36:28,340 --> 06:36:30,340
Oh no.

4408
06:36:30,340 --> 06:36:32,340
He's gonna fucking kill me.

4409
06:36:34,340 --> 06:36:36,340
No, it needs 15.

4410
06:36:36,340 --> 06:36:38,340
Does it?

4411
06:36:38,340 --> 06:36:40,340
I don't know. Let's find out.

4412
06:36:42,340 --> 06:36:44,340
Well...

4413
06:36:52,340 --> 06:36:54,340
Shit.

4414
06:36:56,340 --> 06:36:58,340
All right, well...

4415
06:37:02,340 --> 06:37:04,340
Let's try this.

4416
06:37:06,340 --> 06:37:08,340
Because again, bleeding.

4417
06:37:08,340 --> 06:37:10,340
We'll try to get that blade damage.

4418
06:37:10,340 --> 06:37:12,340
I'm so determined to fucking

4419
06:37:12,340 --> 06:37:14,340
beat this guy.

4420
06:37:14,340 --> 06:37:16,340
If you do a heavy attack after a back dodge,

4421
06:37:16,340 --> 06:37:18,340
you do a follow-up.

4422
06:37:18,340 --> 06:37:20,340
Although it doesn't really matter at this point.

4423
06:37:22,340 --> 06:37:24,340
Since I don't have the stats.

4424
06:37:26,340 --> 06:37:28,340
We'll just see if we can keep it up with this.

4425
06:37:40,340 --> 06:37:42,340
What the fuck was that?

4426
06:37:50,340 --> 06:37:52,340
I don't know what happened.

4427
06:37:52,340 --> 06:37:54,340
I think you two handed the fang.

4428
06:37:54,340 --> 06:37:56,340
I just two handed it and it fucked me up.

4429
06:37:56,340 --> 06:37:58,340
I only did 14 damage.

4430
06:37:58,340 --> 06:38:00,340
I don't have enough strength, bro.

4431
06:38:00,340 --> 06:38:02,340
I don't have enough strength.

4432
06:38:02,340 --> 06:38:04,340
My little fucking muppet arms can't lift up

4433
06:38:04,340 --> 06:38:06,340
the fucking huge ass thing.

4434
06:38:06,340 --> 06:38:08,340
Sorry, I'm cursing a lot.

4435
06:38:08,340 --> 06:38:10,340
Okay.

4436
06:38:16,340 --> 06:38:18,340
Spits it out.

4437
06:38:24,340 --> 06:38:26,340
He's my fucking friend.

4438
06:38:30,340 --> 06:38:32,340
You can't dog pile

4439
06:38:32,340 --> 06:38:34,340
on the jellyfish. You're cheating.

4440
06:38:34,340 --> 06:38:36,340
Take off your hacks.

4441
06:38:38,340 --> 06:38:40,340
My neighbors are probably sick of me.

4442
06:38:40,340 --> 06:38:42,340
I'm gonna fucking beat your ass.

4443
06:38:42,340 --> 06:38:44,340
Beat your ass.

4444
06:38:44,340 --> 06:38:46,340
Beat your ass.

4445
06:38:46,340 --> 06:38:48,340
Beat your ass.

4446
06:38:48,340 --> 06:38:50,340
Beat your ass.

4447
06:38:50,340 --> 06:38:52,340
Beat your ass.

4448
06:38:52,340 --> 06:38:54,340
I don't care.

4449
06:38:54,340 --> 06:38:56,340
I don't care if I'm in lava. I'm beating your ass.

4450
06:38:56,340 --> 06:38:57,340
Anyone with one strike

4451
06:38:58,340 --> 06:39:00,340
can keep me in for it.

4452
06:39:06,340 --> 06:39:08,340
Must be hard playing with the controller using a muppet.

4453
06:39:08,340 --> 06:39:10,340
It is very difficult.

4454
06:39:10,340 --> 06:39:12,340
Um.

4455
06:39:12,340 --> 06:39:14,340
I realize that I just lost all my runes doing that.

4456
06:39:14,340 --> 06:39:16,340
Uh, I don't really know how many runes

4457
06:39:16,340 --> 06:39:18,340
I got from that though, so I don't really care.

4458
06:39:18,340 --> 06:39:20,340
Um.

4459
06:39:20,340 --> 06:39:24,340
I just, I need a good weapon, you know.

4460
06:39:26,340 --> 06:39:28,340
Oh

4461
06:39:35,620 --> 06:39:41,580
See immediately immediately I can only kick you

4462
06:39:46,060 --> 06:39:51,260
Can you like stop you stop dogfiling on the jellyfish, I don't know what is your deal, bro

4463
06:39:52,340 --> 06:39:56,160
I'm really gonna fucking kill myself. I'm gonna do it right now. I'm killing myself

4464
06:39:56,580 --> 06:39:58,580
And they'll do the force

4465
06:40:09,140 --> 06:40:13,340
Wait, do I have the ratting in source ill on

4466
06:40:26,540 --> 06:40:28,540
I

4467
06:40:29,140 --> 06:40:31,140
Take more damage

4468
06:40:49,420 --> 06:40:52,660
No, I fucking love that so much, okay

4469
06:40:57,000 --> 06:41:00,100
Let's try it, let's try it

4470
06:41:12,340 --> 06:41:18,980
Awkward I definitely take more damage guys. That's for sure. I can assure you that I

4471
06:41:20,820 --> 06:41:23,260
Am ripe for the damage

4472
06:41:26,380 --> 06:41:29,460
Let me talk. I'm like trying to do shit and you're like

4473
06:41:31,660 --> 06:41:34,620
Can't even get close to you because there's lava fucking everywhere

4474
06:41:36,780 --> 06:41:38,780
Can you

4475
06:41:39,140 --> 06:41:45,580
Can you like stop having a temper tantrum for like just a second so I can like poke you in the ass

4476
06:41:56,340 --> 06:41:58,340
How did you already kill him

4477
06:42:01,740 --> 06:42:03,740
What

4478
06:42:05,340 --> 06:42:07,340
I'm pressing heal

4479
06:42:07,340 --> 06:42:32,140
Okay, I'm doing a little bit more damage

4480
06:42:32,980 --> 06:42:34,980
I'm gonna search for her

4481
06:42:35,300 --> 06:42:38,340
So get shimmy lock in should be easy. Yeah

4482
06:42:40,300 --> 06:42:45,740
She's training us out for a big wizard. I'm getting epi, but I want to finish this

4483
06:42:48,540 --> 06:42:51,580
Just five hours of me trying to beat a fucking lizard

4484
06:43:02,140 --> 06:43:04,140
I

4485
06:43:04,140 --> 06:43:06,140
I

4486
06:43:06,140 --> 06:43:08,140
I

4487
06:43:30,340 --> 06:43:32,340
Just need to keep him alive

4488
06:43:36,340 --> 06:43:38,340
I might not make it

4489
06:43:43,820 --> 06:43:45,820
Keep sick in him

4490
06:43:48,220 --> 06:43:51,580
Now damn I am definitely taking it

4491
06:43:55,420 --> 06:43:57,860
Okay, okay, we run around run around

4492
06:44:00,300 --> 06:44:03,180
Yeah, I didn't make it fuck

4493
06:44:06,300 --> 06:44:08,300
It's not fun

4494
06:44:22,340 --> 06:44:24,340
It's fine, you got him poison that's all I wanted

4495
06:44:29,620 --> 06:44:34,980
Sound like fucking Elmo are you done? Oh my god, I'm running into the lava

4496
06:44:36,820 --> 06:44:38,820
Bro, what is

4497
06:44:40,740 --> 06:44:45,460
Only human should be allowed to spam attacks not AI this this is ridiculous. I can't even

4498
06:45:01,100 --> 06:45:03,100
Oh actually I was better being close up

4499
06:45:06,140 --> 06:45:10,220
Sorry, my pinky toe was in a flame of lava

4500
06:45:15,420 --> 06:45:17,420
Just couldn't win for hours. Oh man

4501
06:45:18,740 --> 06:45:23,900
Hey, I ruined my Elton string stream. Nice title. I'm definitely considering

4502
06:45:23,900 --> 06:45:29,460
I'm probably gonna take a nap for a little bit wake up send alarm beat this guy off stream

4503
06:45:30,380 --> 06:45:32,380
And then we'll play in the morning

4504
06:45:36,140 --> 06:45:38,140
Oh

4505
06:45:52,500 --> 06:45:56,620
Well, I'm just gonna stay here until that goes away

4506
06:45:57,420 --> 06:46:02,100
I'm kind of terrified. My son just died. I heard his screams of jellyfish terror

4507
06:46:03,020 --> 06:46:05,020
That's really too sad

4508
06:46:07,020 --> 06:46:09,300
I'm just gonna let him kill me

4509
06:46:16,780 --> 06:46:18,780
24 hour elder during stream

4510
06:46:19,860 --> 06:46:25,500
What you first tried off stream, I would hate that I was so pissed like nobody fucking saw this

4511
06:46:25,820 --> 06:46:31,060
Cuz that's that's literally what happened when I was finding a boss on lines of p. I fought it off stream

4512
06:46:31,060 --> 06:46:34,380
And then like it took me three more tries and I got it and I'm like very fucking serious

4513
06:46:34,380 --> 06:46:37,380
Fucking clown bitch

4514
06:47:05,380 --> 06:47:07,380
Oh

4515
06:47:17,100 --> 06:47:25,100
I'm stuck as you can see I'm in like fucking stop lock shit. You got this. Yeah sure

4516
06:47:26,140 --> 06:47:27,540
Sure

4517
06:47:27,540 --> 06:47:29,540
I'm so late. I'm so

4518
06:47:30,380 --> 06:47:31,700
I'm so like

4519
06:47:31,700 --> 06:47:36,260
Autismally focused on this now. I'm sorry like I'm just like I need to finish I need to get it done

4520
06:47:36,260 --> 06:47:38,740
I need to be to me. I need to be to me. I need it. I need it. I need it

4521
06:47:38,740 --> 06:47:42,340
I need it now. I need it now. I can't sleep until I do. I have to I have to I have to I have to be

4522
06:47:42,340 --> 06:47:44,340
I have to you

4523
06:47:49,180 --> 06:47:51,180
Okay, fly jellyfish fly

4524
06:47:59,540 --> 06:48:01,540
Out

4525
06:48:07,020 --> 06:48:09,020
Really

4526
06:48:11,500 --> 06:48:17,020
Why do I feel like it knocked back harder, it's not even like I get extra damage. I just feel like I get knocked back harder

4527
06:48:20,140 --> 06:48:22,140
Oh, we just turned around and killed him

4528
06:48:29,540 --> 06:48:31,540
I

4529
06:48:51,020 --> 06:48:53,660
Love it when I clip into the thing it's great

4530
06:48:54,020 --> 06:48:56,020
I

4531
06:48:57,580 --> 06:49:00,180
Such a strong co-wonka woman, I don't know about that. I

4532
06:49:01,260 --> 06:49:05,700
Am definitely doing more damage because he jellyfish to brody it lasts as long

4533
06:49:08,060 --> 06:49:10,060
Fuck you

4534
06:49:11,540 --> 06:49:13,540
Not doing shit again

4535
06:49:14,700 --> 06:49:20,540
Like I could be like making shit I could be doing a bunch of other stuff, but you know, we don't do that out here

4536
06:49:24,660 --> 06:49:30,460
Okay, you see he didn't get trapped in the fucking door this time

4537
06:49:31,580 --> 06:49:36,420
I was gonna take the heat off of him so he can continue to spam the poison

4538
06:49:40,060 --> 06:49:43,620
To get out of this fire to go away, that's fine perfect

4539
06:49:53,660 --> 06:49:55,660
I

4540
06:50:03,940 --> 06:50:09,820
There's lava here, I can't really do much I don't think you got poison

4541
06:50:10,060 --> 06:50:12,060
It's fine

4542
06:50:20,260 --> 06:50:27,820
It's literally all dependent on if he gets poisoned I can beat him which sucks

4543
06:50:31,660 --> 06:50:34,460
But it's just because I'm underleveled it's a fact

4544
06:50:40,820 --> 06:50:42,820
I

4545
06:50:45,100 --> 06:50:47,100
Know that worked out

4546
06:50:50,180 --> 06:50:52,180
Quickly blood loss, please

4547
06:51:09,820 --> 06:51:19,780
Oh fuck am I dead am I dead? No, I'm not dead

4548
06:51:22,460 --> 06:51:24,460
Holy shit, holy shit

4549
06:51:33,060 --> 06:51:35,060
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god

4550
06:51:39,820 --> 06:51:41,820
Oh

4551
06:52:09,820 --> 06:52:11,820
Oh

4552
06:52:21,660 --> 06:52:23,940
It's doing that weird thing where it locks on

4553
06:52:28,100 --> 06:52:32,660
And only his head instead of it's happening just what I want

4554
06:52:40,420 --> 06:52:42,420
Oh

4555
06:52:45,340 --> 06:52:47,340
No, not the brazier

4556
06:53:01,540 --> 06:53:03,540
No

4557
06:53:10,060 --> 06:53:12,060
I

4558
06:53:24,180 --> 06:53:26,580
No, no, no, no, no, please no, oh brother

4559
06:53:26,580 --> 06:53:28,580
I

4560
06:53:38,860 --> 06:53:44,060
Think I can do it out jelly. I'm wondering if I should wait till the towards like I get him half done

4561
06:53:50,420 --> 06:53:55,700
Feels less than half the damage, okay good to know I wasn't paying attention to my my FP to be honest with you

4562
06:53:56,820 --> 06:54:02,580
Okay, we'll try it without jelly and for a little bit

4563
06:54:14,980 --> 06:54:17,940
I can get him trapped in a corner when he does that he should be actually

4564
06:54:18,420 --> 06:54:21,340
Fine to manage because then he won't be doing so much lava everywhere

4565
06:54:26,780 --> 06:54:28,780
This

4566
06:54:42,180 --> 06:54:44,180
So you can get a head start

4567
06:54:45,820 --> 06:54:53,540
Maybe because in the lava run the heat the automatically the AI aggro's the thing what you've been doing a lava run

4568
06:54:53,540 --> 06:54:55,540
Oh

4569
06:54:55,860 --> 06:54:57,860
Sorry

4570
06:55:07,540 --> 06:55:11,180
Okay, right off the rip. We're just he did not want me touching his booty hole

4571
06:55:13,380 --> 06:55:15,380
Okay

4572
06:55:18,140 --> 06:55:20,380
Bro, I'm getting my shit kicked in right now

4573
06:55:24,540 --> 06:55:30,940
Let's see, let's see if he's okay over here. He doesn't wander into fucking lava like he's doing right now actually

4574
06:55:31,900 --> 06:55:34,540
Okay, yeah, uh jellyfish is gonna die

4575
06:55:35,940 --> 06:55:37,940
That was fucking waste

4576
06:55:40,900 --> 06:55:42,900
Oh brother

4577
06:55:44,220 --> 06:55:46,220
Yeah

4578
06:55:47,700 --> 06:55:50,100
I know that was a better rate for that one

4579
06:55:50,700 --> 06:55:52,100
I

4580
06:55:52,100 --> 06:55:55,780
Don't even want the moon veil. I just want to kill him. I just want to kill him

4581
06:55:58,140 --> 06:56:00,340
Time is it 11 fuck

4582
06:56:06,340 --> 06:56:08,340
Alexander only you would fucking help me

4583
06:56:10,980 --> 06:56:13,580
What if I spawn it right on him

4584
06:56:20,220 --> 06:56:22,220
I

4585
06:56:22,220 --> 06:56:51,220
I'm getting too eager, I'm sorry, I just want to kill him.

4586
06:56:51,220 --> 06:56:58,220
This will actually be a good run if I never run.

4587
06:56:58,220 --> 06:57:23,220
I should put on some fire-resistant shit, to be honest with you.

4588
06:57:23,220 --> 06:57:49,220
Why are you doing this multiple times?

4589
06:57:49,220 --> 06:57:57,220
I'm stuck.

4590
06:57:57,220 --> 06:58:03,220
I'm already down to the blasts, I just don't know why I'm bothering.

4591
06:58:03,220 --> 06:58:15,220
Actually, this is helpful because when I do this, I can immediately actually dodge out of the stuff, and I'm not using it.

4592
06:58:15,220 --> 06:58:25,220
This spawn on top of him seems good, it seems like that worked actually.

4593
06:58:25,220 --> 06:58:33,220
Okay, let me ask him nicely to die, I'll try that next.

4594
06:58:45,220 --> 06:58:56,220
I would appreciate it if you died nicely, calmly, died, that would be really nice.

4595
06:58:56,220 --> 06:59:07,220
If you could, that would really be so great, I would really appreciate that.

4596
06:59:07,220 --> 06:59:10,220
It would be cool if he didn't kill my friend.

4597
06:59:10,220 --> 06:59:15,220
Two, that would be super nice, but I don't know if you can be trusted with that.

4598
06:59:15,220 --> 06:59:24,220
I'm stuck, I'm in the swamp, I'm fine.

4599
06:59:24,220 --> 06:59:28,220
Ow, that wasn't nice.

4600
06:59:28,220 --> 06:59:30,220
Ow.

4601
06:59:30,220 --> 06:59:36,220
I don't think it worked.

4602
06:59:37,220 --> 06:59:44,220
I've heard a woman ask me to die, I probably won't.

4603
06:59:44,220 --> 06:59:55,220
Excuse me, could you please, K-Y-S, kiss your sister, and I just show them a picture of Amy, and then he just licks, I don't think.

4604
06:59:56,220 --> 07:00:06,220
I opened you, I'm jumping on you, I'm jumping, ow.

4605
07:00:06,220 --> 07:00:09,220
Ow.

4606
07:00:09,220 --> 07:00:15,220
That's fine, anyways, okay.

4607
07:00:15,220 --> 07:00:20,220
You get him, Jilly, I'm gonna be dead on the other side.

4608
07:00:21,220 --> 07:00:27,220
I don't think bosses run out of stamina, but thank you.

4609
07:00:27,220 --> 07:00:33,220
Inside of a dragon is kind of hollow, WTF.

4610
07:00:33,220 --> 07:00:37,220
Riddle me this, riddle me this, Batman.

4611
07:00:37,220 --> 07:00:49,220
If I went to dragon place and got the dragon head that does the blight, do you think that would be effective?

4612
07:00:50,220 --> 07:00:57,220
I would, would I need more arcane for that?

4613
07:00:57,220 --> 07:01:01,220
I'm not sure.

4614
07:01:01,220 --> 07:01:05,220
Kind of wish I had some coffee, because I want to keep playing.

4615
07:01:05,220 --> 07:01:08,220
We need arcane, yeah, no shit, rotten breath, yes.

4616
07:01:08,220 --> 07:01:14,220
We would need more arcane.

4617
07:01:14,220 --> 07:01:19,220
Face in arcane.

4618
07:01:44,220 --> 07:01:51,220
See, I'm going to use some jump to essentially move that out of a large way to those attacks.

4619
07:01:51,220 --> 07:01:59,220
Now while we're lying, it's going to be a throw-up, which while I do get sloppy, I do hit quite a few times, which I could have otherwise avoided.

4620
07:01:59,220 --> 07:02:01,220
It's so impressive.

4621
07:02:01,220 --> 07:02:13,220
As I said, the house starts with the jiggy-tarnas here, and my brand-new strategy is to move some relief to the place we can to be guessed at damage-race this boss to his hand.

4622
07:02:14,220 --> 07:02:25,220
If I take a massive hit there, the only thing that I'm not going to be using is spirit summons, and that's mainly because they make the boss unpredictable.

4623
07:02:25,220 --> 07:02:30,220
I know what the boss is going to do in the kind of room-space for this boss.

4624
07:02:30,220 --> 07:02:32,220
Oh, I knew it.

4625
07:02:32,220 --> 07:02:41,220
And if I have spirit summons, it's essentially going to pull it to make the boss do something to jump on a low attack.

4626
07:02:41,220 --> 07:02:49,220
So I'm not going to be using a low-bottom smash attack, which you can very well use that if I want to.

4627
07:02:49,220 --> 07:02:51,220
If I want to.

4628
07:02:51,220 --> 07:02:58,220
Just go for standing palestons attacks, standing on low attacks to just build.

4629
07:02:58,220 --> 07:03:04,220
And I can say, though, is that you're sure that you don't get yourself too close on a low blow.

4630
07:03:04,220 --> 07:03:07,220
This boss loves to do that, working in tight waves.

4631
07:03:07,220 --> 07:03:09,220
Use his mag at every map.

4632
07:03:09,220 --> 07:03:14,220
Make a move, and she's able to rep the direction.

4633
07:03:14,220 --> 07:03:18,220
To realize you're surrounding herself at night.

4634
07:03:18,220 --> 07:03:23,220
So this boss loves to do this attack, two, three times a move, and three times a move.

4635
07:03:23,220 --> 07:03:29,220
He does it twice, but I don't get kicked in this fight.

4636
07:03:29,220 --> 07:03:36,220
Sorry, I'm learning.

4637
07:03:36,220 --> 07:03:39,220
I didn't realize he does a lot of jumping.

4638
07:03:39,220 --> 07:03:44,220
Like he just jumps to avoid the ground pound.

4639
07:03:44,220 --> 07:03:54,220
Okay.

4640
07:03:54,220 --> 07:03:58,220
All right, let's try it.

4641
07:03:58,220 --> 07:04:04,220
Studying Sun Tzu in some of the Bible.

4642
07:04:04,220 --> 07:04:05,220
Studies.

4643
07:04:05,220 --> 07:04:06,220
Oh, yeah.

4644
07:04:06,220 --> 07:04:12,220
No, I love studying like move sets.

4645
07:04:12,220 --> 07:04:14,220
I think scale.

4646
07:04:14,220 --> 07:04:20,220
That's I think that's why I like this game a lot because I didn't know I like those things until I played this game.

4647
07:04:20,220 --> 07:04:21,220
Okay, we're not.

4648
07:04:21,220 --> 07:04:23,220
We're just gonna.

4649
07:04:23,220 --> 07:04:25,220
Yeah, whatever.

4650
07:04:25,220 --> 07:04:26,220
Fucking hell.

4651
07:04:26,220 --> 07:04:30,220
My eye is itchy.

4652
07:04:30,220 --> 07:04:31,220
My eyes itchy.

4653
07:04:31,220 --> 07:04:32,220
Hold on.

4654
07:04:32,220 --> 07:04:33,220
My eyes itchy.

4655
07:04:33,220 --> 07:04:38,220
My eyes itchy.

4656
07:04:38,220 --> 07:04:47,220
I realize if I stay in one place, he also stays in one place.

4657
07:04:47,220 --> 07:04:51,220
He's gonna do it a third time.

4658
07:04:51,220 --> 07:04:52,220
Oh, I timed that incorrectly.

4659
07:04:52,220 --> 07:04:57,220
It's fine.

4660
07:04:57,220 --> 07:04:58,220
Oh, I didn't do that.

4661
07:04:58,220 --> 07:05:04,220
So he does a jump when he ground pounds, but I don't know the timing for that yet.

4662
07:05:04,220 --> 07:05:07,220
Jesus, please let me get up.

4663
07:05:08,220 --> 07:05:09,220
Why am I?

4664
07:05:09,220 --> 07:05:10,220
My timing is all fucked up.

4665
07:05:10,220 --> 07:05:13,220
I think because I'm too tired.

4666
07:05:13,220 --> 07:05:16,220
Since when do you spam this attack?

4667
07:05:16,220 --> 07:05:20,220
Hello?

4668
07:05:20,220 --> 07:05:23,220
You know what?

4669
07:05:23,220 --> 07:05:31,220
I think I'm too tired.

4670
07:05:31,220 --> 07:05:33,220
Okay, we're playing tomorrow bright and early.

4671
07:05:33,220 --> 07:05:35,220
You better be ready, boys.

4672
07:05:35,220 --> 07:05:38,220
I'm gonna take a nap.

4673
07:05:38,220 --> 07:05:40,220
I'm gonna wake up.

4674
07:05:40,220 --> 07:05:43,220
I'm gonna play some more.

4675
07:05:43,220 --> 07:05:48,220
This boss will be dead in God for the time.

4676
07:05:48,220 --> 07:05:52,220
And then in the morning, I don't know.

4677
07:05:52,220 --> 07:05:55,220
I don't know what's going on.

4678
07:05:55,220 --> 07:05:57,220
Just stay in the lookout.

4679
07:05:57,220 --> 07:05:58,220
All right.

4680
07:05:58,220 --> 07:06:02,220
So I'm gonna say bright and early.

4681
07:06:02,220 --> 07:06:03,220
Hey, damn.

4682
07:06:03,220 --> 07:06:06,220
No kidding.

4683
07:06:06,220 --> 07:06:07,220
I don't know.

4684
07:06:07,220 --> 07:06:08,220
I'll be around.

4685
07:06:08,220 --> 07:06:15,220
If you guys don't have plans for 4th July or your U.K. or Euro or whatever you are,

4686
07:06:15,220 --> 07:06:20,220
we are hanging out or playing some melding ring.

4687
07:06:20,220 --> 07:06:22,220
My head hurts.

4688
07:06:22,220 --> 07:06:25,220
I need to sleep.

4689
07:06:25,220 --> 07:06:31,220
Um, yeah, yeah.

4690
07:06:31,220 --> 07:06:32,220
Today's your birthday.

4691
07:06:32,220 --> 07:06:33,220
Oh my God.

4692
07:06:33,220 --> 07:06:34,220
Happy birthday.

4693
07:06:34,220 --> 07:06:35,220
Good for you.

4694
07:06:35,220 --> 07:06:37,220
Aren't you happy you're still on this earth?

4695
07:06:37,220 --> 07:06:39,220
I'm happy you're still on this earth.

4696
07:06:39,220 --> 07:06:41,220
Your town is already celebrating that.

4697
07:06:41,220 --> 07:06:42,220
That's, yeah.

4698
07:06:42,220 --> 07:06:45,220
I think that's why I swear I thought I heard fireworks.

4699
07:06:45,220 --> 07:06:46,220
Oh, it's cool.

4700
07:06:46,220 --> 07:06:47,220
I'm going to see.

4701
07:06:47,220 --> 07:06:51,220
So they do the fireworks like in my town center and I can see that from my apartment

4702
07:06:51,220 --> 07:06:52,220
building.

4703
07:06:52,220 --> 07:06:53,220
So it'll be really cool.

4704
07:06:53,220 --> 07:06:56,220
I can just look outside and see them.

4705
07:06:56,220 --> 07:07:11,220
Yeah, I'm just like very determined when it comes to games.

4706
07:07:11,220 --> 07:07:13,220
Like I've had friends sit and watch me play.

4707
07:07:13,220 --> 07:07:19,220
Um, and they're just like, why don't you just do this or that or whatever and like

4708
07:07:19,220 --> 07:07:21,220
come back to it or whatever.

4709
07:07:21,220 --> 07:07:22,220
I'm like, no.

4710
07:07:22,220 --> 07:07:24,220
Like I won't lie.

4711
07:07:24,220 --> 07:07:30,900
I was definitely that person that determinedly powered through tree sentinel the first time

4712
07:07:30,900 --> 07:07:34,060
I played a hundred because I thought I had to beat him.

4713
07:07:34,060 --> 07:07:35,220
So I get it.

4714
07:07:35,220 --> 07:07:42,220
Um, I'm just, I just like to see things through, you know, gotta hit that brick wall till it

4715
07:07:42,220 --> 07:07:43,220
falls over a hundred percent.

4716
07:07:43,220 --> 07:07:45,220
I'm bashing my head through that shit.

4717
07:07:45,220 --> 07:07:46,220
You have no idea.

4718
07:07:46,220 --> 07:07:49,220
Uh, well, I hope you enjoyed.

4719
07:07:49,220 --> 07:07:51,220
Um, I know I did.

4720
07:07:51,220 --> 07:07:53,220
I love this game.

4721
07:07:53,220 --> 07:07:55,220
I kind of just want to stay up.

4722
07:07:55,220 --> 07:07:57,220
I don't have to fucking.

4723
07:07:57,220 --> 07:07:58,220
I hate.

4724
07:07:58,220 --> 07:08:00,220
Well, I love sleeping.

4725
07:08:00,220 --> 07:08:04,220
Like I took like a fucking like three hour, four hour nap today.

4726
07:08:04,220 --> 07:08:05,220
I don't know how I'm still tired.

4727
07:08:05,220 --> 07:08:08,220
My body's just like, stop.

4728
07:08:08,220 --> 07:08:13,220
Um, you love watching people play.

4729
07:08:13,220 --> 07:08:15,220
I'm gonna watch me do it.

4730
07:08:15,220 --> 07:08:16,220
I do.

4731
07:08:16,220 --> 07:08:20,220
I hope you guys enjoy my very colorful commentary.

4732
07:08:20,220 --> 07:08:25,220
I know for a fact this video will be fucking tomorrow.

4733
07:08:25,220 --> 07:08:27,220
Oh, what are you doing?

4734
07:08:27,220 --> 07:08:29,220
She's like walking around like she's up to something.

4735
07:08:29,220 --> 07:08:30,220
What are you doing, lady?

4736
07:08:30,220 --> 07:08:31,220
Sneaky.

4737
07:08:31,220 --> 07:08:43,220
Um, but I hope you, I hope you have a good night or a good day or a good evening or morning

4738
07:08:43,220 --> 07:08:51,220
or dusk or dawn or afternoon or early afternoon.

4739
07:08:51,220 --> 07:08:55,220
I'll be back tomorrow in Muppet form.

4740
07:08:55,220 --> 07:09:00,220
Please check out what is high on heart stream.

4741
07:09:00,220 --> 07:09:02,220
They are very entertaining.

4742
07:09:02,220 --> 07:09:04,220
I do like her.

4743
07:09:04,220 --> 07:09:08,220
Um, and please check out.

4744
07:09:09,220 --> 07:09:11,220
I love her.

4745
07:09:11,220 --> 07:09:14,220
She made me my Muppet self.

4746
07:09:14,220 --> 07:09:18,220
You got amazing Muppet madam today.

4747
07:09:18,220 --> 07:09:21,220
Look how nice my little Muppet boobies are.

4748
07:09:21,220 --> 07:09:23,220
Her stuff is pinned.

4749
07:09:23,220 --> 07:09:25,220
Please check out her Twitch.

4750
07:09:25,220 --> 07:09:26,220
She is so lovely.

4751
07:09:26,220 --> 07:09:27,220
She's so sweet.

4752
07:09:27,220 --> 07:09:31,220
One of the comfiest streamers I've ever watched and also a great friend of mine.

4753
07:09:31,220 --> 07:09:34,220
She's helped me a lot when I first heard of VTubing.

4754
07:09:34,220 --> 07:09:36,220
I look up to her.

4755
07:09:36,220 --> 07:09:37,220
She's awesome.

4756
07:09:37,220 --> 07:09:40,220
Please check her out.

4757
07:09:40,220 --> 07:09:43,220
All right.

4758
07:09:43,220 --> 07:09:48,220
I almost, I watched like Markiplier play like Slay the princess the other day and I literally

4759
07:09:48,220 --> 07:09:52,220
subconsciously almost went, until the next video.

4760
07:09:52,220 --> 07:09:53,220
Bye.

4761
07:09:53,220 --> 07:09:57,220
I'm so fucking tired, dude.

4762
07:09:57,220 --> 07:09:59,220
Slay the princess is a good game too.

4763
07:09:59,220 --> 07:10:01,220
I would love to play Slay the princess on stream.

4764
07:10:01,220 --> 07:10:06,220
Um, oh, I'm so tired.

4765
07:10:06,220 --> 07:10:07,220
Okay.

4766
07:10:07,220 --> 07:10:08,220
Please don't go.

4767
07:10:08,220 --> 07:10:09,220
I don't want to go.

4768
07:10:09,220 --> 07:10:10,220
You know I don't want to go.

4769
07:10:10,220 --> 07:10:12,220
No, I always want to hang out with you guys.

4770
07:10:12,220 --> 07:10:13,220
Sheepie Plier?

4771
07:10:13,220 --> 07:10:15,220
I'll be sick.

4772
07:10:15,220 --> 07:10:25,220
Um, again, uh, thank you so much and don't think I'm not like mad or anything.

4773
07:10:25,220 --> 07:10:27,220
If when you help, I appreciate it.

4774
07:10:27,220 --> 07:10:28,220
Trust me.

4775
07:10:28,220 --> 07:10:29,220
I'm not mad at anybody.

4776
07:10:29,220 --> 07:10:30,220
It's all jokes.

4777
07:10:30,220 --> 07:10:33,220
I just, I get a little toxic when I play Elden Ring.

4778
07:10:33,220 --> 07:10:34,220
It is what it is.

4779
07:10:34,220 --> 07:10:37,220
Guys should have seen me play fucking Counter-Strike.

4780
07:10:37,220 --> 07:10:39,220
Holy shit, bro.

4781
07:10:39,220 --> 07:10:41,220
Oh my God.

4782
07:10:41,220 --> 07:10:43,220
Um, start next stream.

4783
07:10:43,220 --> 07:10:45,220
My name is Sheepie Conplier.

4784
07:10:45,220 --> 07:10:49,220
Hello, my name is Sheepie Conplier.

4785
07:10:49,220 --> 07:10:54,220
You love the toxicity?

4786
07:10:54,220 --> 07:10:56,220
You like Amy Madame?

4787
07:10:56,220 --> 07:10:57,220
It's funny.

4788
07:10:57,220 --> 07:11:01,220
I don't think people would like to watch me rage, but people like to watch me rage.

4789
07:11:01,220 --> 07:11:06,220
I just, oh, it's so funny.

4790
07:11:06,220 --> 07:11:09,220
I need to eat something.

4791
07:11:09,220 --> 07:11:11,220
I need to eat something.

4792
07:11:11,220 --> 07:11:13,220
I need to eat something.

4793
07:11:13,220 --> 07:11:14,220
Actually, I'm not really hungry.

4794
07:11:14,220 --> 07:11:15,220
I'm still a little nauseous.

4795
07:11:15,220 --> 07:11:19,220
I think maybe they'll have some more crackers.

4796
07:11:19,220 --> 07:11:26,220
Ever since I, there's like, like the, these weird knockoff, um, cheese crackers, and I

4797
07:11:26,220 --> 07:11:28,220
smelled them and they made me nauseous again.

4798
07:11:28,220 --> 07:11:31,220
So I kind of don't want to eat.

4799
07:11:31,220 --> 07:11:34,220
Uh.

4800
07:11:34,220 --> 07:11:38,220
Well, there's the water.

4801
07:11:38,220 --> 07:11:39,220
Hello, everybody.

4802
07:11:39,220 --> 07:11:45,220
My name is Sheepie Conplier, and today we'll be playing Elden Ring.

4803
07:11:45,220 --> 07:11:49,220
Top of the order to you laddies!

4804
07:11:49,220 --> 07:11:52,220
I haven't watched Jacksepticeye in the longest time, but he is someone that I should watch

4805
07:11:52,220 --> 07:11:58,220
for this because I know he fucking loves FromSoft games.

4806
07:11:58,220 --> 07:12:00,220
Welcome back to some more Elden Ring.

4807
07:12:00,220 --> 07:12:06,220
I know I need to, I'll just start ripping off other VTubers and YouTubers intros and

4808
07:12:06,220 --> 07:12:16,220
outros and just assimilating them into my own.

4809
07:12:16,220 --> 07:12:18,220
Oh, hi, Whopper!

4810
07:12:18,220 --> 07:12:22,220
I don't know, I can't even do the laddies voice.

4811
07:12:22,220 --> 07:12:25,220
Uh, I'm a little tired, guys.

4812
07:12:25,220 --> 07:12:28,220
I'm a, I'm a fucking Muppet.

4813
07:12:28,220 --> 07:12:30,220
I'm gonna start calling people Muppets.

4814
07:12:30,220 --> 07:12:32,220
You're a fucking Muppet.

4815
07:12:32,220 --> 07:12:44,220
Fia, are you, what are you doing?

4816
07:12:45,220 --> 07:12:48,220
I'm turning EU?

4817
07:12:48,220 --> 07:12:50,220
What do you mean?

4818
07:12:50,220 --> 07:12:52,220
You fucking Muppet.

4819
07:12:52,220 --> 07:12:54,220
I don't say Muppet.

4820
07:12:54,220 --> 07:12:56,220
Muppet.

4821
07:12:56,220 --> 07:12:57,220
Muppet.

4822
07:12:57,220 --> 07:12:59,220
Maybe stalling to talk maybe.

4823
07:12:59,220 --> 07:13:02,220
Does any of you guys want to talk me in?

4824
07:13:02,220 --> 07:13:04,220
I'm like real tired.

4825
07:13:04,220 --> 07:13:06,220
I need to be carried to bed.

4826
07:13:06,220 --> 07:13:12,220
Um, I got this like new lingerie set, not like lingerie, it's more like just like

4827
07:13:12,220 --> 07:13:17,220
from, um, Savage X Fenty, which is like one of my favorite brands.

4828
07:13:17,220 --> 07:13:21,220
It's so comfy, like this is a bra, I feel like I could sleep in.

4829
07:13:21,220 --> 07:13:22,220
It's so comfy.

4830
07:13:22,220 --> 07:13:24,220
I'm squeezing my own boobies.

4831
07:13:24,220 --> 07:13:28,220
Um, and like the underwear is comfy too.

4832
07:13:28,220 --> 07:13:31,220
And then I'm wearing a robe.

4833
07:13:31,220 --> 07:13:33,220
And that's all I'm wearing.

4834
07:13:33,220 --> 07:13:36,220
And then you got my little Muppet body.

4835
07:13:36,220 --> 07:13:38,220
Imagine my little Muppet body in lingerie.

4836
07:13:38,220 --> 07:13:40,220
How does that make you feel?

4837
07:13:40,220 --> 07:13:42,220
I'm tempted to permanently become a Muppet.

4838
07:13:42,220 --> 07:13:46,220
I might just tell Strani, just Muppetize me captain, you know?

4839
07:13:46,220 --> 07:13:47,220
I'm super soft.

4840
07:13:47,220 --> 07:13:54,220
I have like velvety faux rabbit fur.

4841
07:13:54,220 --> 07:13:55,220
Nice you mentioned it.

4842
07:13:55,220 --> 07:14:00,220
It doesn't, to be honest, it still doesn't fit properly because like I just, I think

4843
07:14:00,220 --> 07:14:02,220
I'm just in denial about my cup size.

4844
07:14:02,220 --> 07:14:06,220
I've never been over a triple D, but I think I may be bigger than a triple D.

4845
07:14:06,220 --> 07:14:07,220
So it is what it is.

4846
07:14:07,220 --> 07:14:09,220
It's just really comfy though.

4847
07:14:09,220 --> 07:14:12,220
I think it's because it doesn't have a wire in it.

4848
07:14:12,220 --> 07:14:14,220
And I'm like, it is nice.

4849
07:14:14,220 --> 07:14:17,220
But it doesn't have like, I couldn't wear this with like outside.

4850
07:14:17,220 --> 07:14:19,220
It would just suck.

4851
07:14:19,220 --> 07:14:25,220
It would just like my boobies would be flopping everywhere.

4852
07:14:25,220 --> 07:14:28,220
Just Muppet me the fuck up, bro.

4853
07:14:28,220 --> 07:14:30,220
Muppet the fuck up, bro.

4854
07:14:30,220 --> 07:14:31,220
Muppet the fuck up.

4855
07:14:31,220 --> 07:14:34,220
I think everybody needs to Muppet up.

4856
07:14:34,220 --> 07:14:36,220
Is there anything that they know existed?

4857
07:14:36,220 --> 07:14:38,220
Again, I just have a giant hole.

4858
07:14:38,220 --> 07:14:42,220
So, uh, you with that as you mutt, you wish.

4859
07:14:42,220 --> 07:14:45,220
Well, not as you wish as I wish, if anything.

4860
07:14:45,220 --> 07:14:47,220
I'm in control here.

4861
07:14:47,220 --> 07:14:48,220
Confused, horny.

4862
07:14:48,220 --> 07:14:49,220
Feels strange.

4863
07:14:49,220 --> 07:14:50,220
Ah!

4864
07:14:50,220 --> 07:14:53,220
Are you horny here?

4865
07:14:53,220 --> 07:14:58,220
Or do you like some of my Muppety Muppet body here?

4866
07:14:58,220 --> 07:15:05,220
I have a big gaping Muppet hole just for you.

4867
07:15:05,220 --> 07:15:10,220
Wait, who truly is in control if you're out of Muppet?

4868
07:15:10,220 --> 07:15:12,220
Who the fuck is holding?

4869
07:15:12,220 --> 07:15:16,220
Do you not see my own hand holding up my Muppet body?

4870
07:15:16,220 --> 07:15:20,220
Like you're Jennifer Carly just a Muppet.

4871
07:15:20,220 --> 07:15:23,220
Jennifer Carly.

4872
07:15:23,220 --> 07:15:25,220
Are you scared?

4873
07:15:25,220 --> 07:15:27,220
No, pick your Bible back up.

4874
07:15:27,220 --> 07:15:30,220
I want you to stroke your Bible.

4875
07:15:30,220 --> 07:15:33,220
Really look at the cover.

4876
07:15:33,220 --> 07:15:35,220
Pour over the pages.

4877
07:15:35,220 --> 07:15:40,220
And, uh, I should have covered my Muppet body.

4878
07:15:40,220 --> 07:15:45,220
I have a big gaping Muppet.

4879
07:15:45,220 --> 07:15:51,220
I have a big gaping Muppet.

4880
07:15:51,220 --> 07:15:56,220
I have a big gaping Muppet.

4881
07:15:56,220 --> 07:15:58,220
The temptation of the Muppet.

4882
07:15:58,220 --> 07:16:04,220
Yes, what did you call it?

4883
07:16:04,220 --> 07:16:12,220
Imagine my smooth little Muppet's hands touching your face.

4884
07:16:12,220 --> 07:16:16,220
Imagine my smooth little Muppet's mouth.

4885
07:16:16,220 --> 07:16:18,220
Isn't it you?

4886
07:16:18,220 --> 07:16:21,220
And your lippies?

4887
07:16:21,220 --> 07:16:24,220
I guess now is a bad time to say I was working on something.

4888
07:16:24,220 --> 07:16:26,220
What are you working on?

4889
07:16:26,220 --> 07:16:30,220
You're working on a Muppet for yourself?

4890
07:16:30,220 --> 07:16:33,220
Muppet's gonna feel like a starch sock we're working on.

4891
07:16:33,220 --> 07:16:38,220
I did say earlier, use me like one of your socks.

4892
07:16:38,220 --> 07:16:41,220
Use me like one of your French socks.

4893
07:16:41,220 --> 07:16:42,220
Oh, you'll see.

4894
07:16:42,220 --> 07:16:44,220
Please make this an ASMR role play.

4895
07:16:44,220 --> 07:16:45,220
Are you sure?

4896
07:16:45,220 --> 07:16:47,220
You think this stream is getting demonetized?

4897
07:16:47,220 --> 07:16:49,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

4898
07:16:49,220 --> 07:16:51,220
Like my Muppet-y bobbies.

4899
07:16:51,220 --> 07:16:55,220
You like my beauty mark, my Muppet-y boobies.

4900
07:16:55,220 --> 07:16:59,220
It's pretty nice.

4901
07:16:59,220 --> 07:17:00,220
Oh, you'll see.

4902
07:17:00,220 --> 07:17:01,220
I'm scared.

4903
07:17:01,220 --> 07:17:03,220
What is she cooking up?

4904
07:17:03,220 --> 07:17:05,220
I'm tempted to draw a Muppet smut.

4905
07:17:05,220 --> 07:17:14,220
Smut it, if you would.

4906
07:17:14,220 --> 07:17:19,220
Somebody turn off my computer for me right now.

4907
07:17:19,220 --> 07:17:22,220
It's not the Muppet.

4908
07:17:22,220 --> 07:17:24,220
I mean, it is the Internet.

4909
07:17:24,220 --> 07:17:25,220
You're right.

4910
07:17:25,220 --> 07:17:28,220
Rule 34 exists.

4911
07:17:28,220 --> 07:17:29,220
Learn.

4912
07:17:29,220 --> 07:17:30,220
Learn?

4913
07:17:30,220 --> 07:17:31,220
Learn?

4914
07:17:31,220 --> 07:17:32,220
Lord have mercy.

4915
07:17:32,220 --> 07:17:36,220
Jamie, please tell me you heard of the term Muppet-necking.

4916
07:17:36,220 --> 07:17:38,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

4917
07:17:38,220 --> 07:17:40,220
What is Muppet-necking?

4918
07:17:40,220 --> 07:17:45,220
Is it when you like, nosle someone's neck and you're just like...

4919
07:17:45,220 --> 07:17:46,220
You know?

4920
07:17:46,220 --> 07:17:51,220
How do I save?

4921
07:17:51,220 --> 07:17:58,220
System.

4922
07:17:58,220 --> 07:17:59,220
Oh, look.

4923
07:17:59,220 --> 07:18:01,220
I'm going to quit.

4924
07:18:01,220 --> 07:18:02,220
Yes.

4925
07:18:02,220 --> 07:18:03,220
Six hours.

4926
07:18:03,220 --> 07:18:04,220
Exactly.

4927
07:18:04,220 --> 07:18:05,220
Let's go.

4928
07:18:05,220 --> 07:18:07,220
Six hours, one second.

4929
07:18:07,220 --> 07:18:10,220
Oh, my God.

4930
07:18:10,220 --> 07:18:15,220
From software.

4931
07:18:15,220 --> 07:18:18,220
I can't be controlling the Muppet, but it's the Muppet control me.

4932
07:18:18,220 --> 07:18:21,220
They're just my little puppets on strings.

4933
07:18:21,220 --> 07:18:26,220
They're all puppets in my hair room.

4934
07:18:26,220 --> 07:18:29,220
They're all Muppets in my hair room.

4935
07:18:29,220 --> 07:18:32,220
They're all going to feel like starch socks by morning.

4936
07:18:32,220 --> 07:18:37,220
That's all I'm going to say.

4937
07:18:37,220 --> 07:18:41,220
Muppet-she-be-muppet-get-me-wrung-burn-a-light.

4938
07:18:41,220 --> 07:18:47,220
I've never felt felt like this before, baby Jesus.

4939
07:18:47,220 --> 07:18:57,220
I have a hundred percent cashmere.

4940
07:18:57,220 --> 07:18:58,220
Yeah, I can step down by my...

4941
07:18:58,220 --> 07:19:08,220
I don't have any legs, but...

4942
07:19:08,220 --> 07:19:09,220
I have permission to put my hand up.

4943
07:19:09,220 --> 07:19:10,220
No, only Peepies.

4944
07:19:10,220 --> 07:19:11,220
Peepies on there.

4945
07:19:11,220 --> 07:19:16,220
I didn't know I needed that.

4946
07:19:16,220 --> 07:19:22,220
I hope you are vigorously stroking yourself right now to my Muppet self.

4947
07:19:22,220 --> 07:19:23,220
You better.

4948
07:19:23,220 --> 07:19:24,220
It is a challenge.

4949
07:19:24,220 --> 07:19:25,220
Can you?

4950
07:19:25,220 --> 07:19:26,220
Can you?

4951
07:19:26,220 --> 07:19:33,220
Can you read the Bible to this Muppet boy?

4952
07:19:33,220 --> 07:19:42,220
I want you to...

4953
07:19:42,220 --> 07:19:46,220
You beat your hand inside and you feel something pulling you in.

4954
07:19:46,220 --> 07:19:49,220
It's my Muppet.

4955
07:19:49,220 --> 07:19:51,220
Wait, that doesn't work.

4956
07:19:51,220 --> 07:19:53,220
Muppet-muppet-tussi?

4957
07:19:53,220 --> 07:20:05,220
How do you guys fucking clip in this shit?

4958
07:20:05,220 --> 07:20:07,220
Wait, no, don't do it.

4959
07:20:07,220 --> 07:20:09,220
My mussy?

4960
07:20:09,220 --> 07:20:11,220
My Muppet-tussi?

4961
07:20:11,220 --> 07:20:13,220
Yeah.

4962
07:20:14,220 --> 07:20:17,220
You're gonna read the Bible to Muppet-chibi?

4963
07:20:17,220 --> 07:20:18,220
Yes.

4964
07:20:18,220 --> 07:20:19,220
Yes.

4965
07:20:19,220 --> 07:20:25,220
You cannot read the Bible to anything else besides Muppet-chibi.

4966
07:20:25,220 --> 07:20:32,220
Muppet-chibi is for God.

4967
07:20:32,220 --> 07:20:33,220
Imagine.

4968
07:20:33,220 --> 07:20:38,220
He's getting way out of your hand.

4969
07:20:38,220 --> 07:20:40,220
Your hand, it's up my ass.

4970
07:20:40,220 --> 07:20:42,220
I'm a Muppet.

4971
07:20:42,220 --> 07:20:50,220
I'm a Muppet.

4972
07:20:50,220 --> 07:20:54,220
He has stretched my legies.

4973
07:20:54,220 --> 07:20:58,220
He has piggy hooves.

4974
07:20:58,220 --> 07:21:03,220
I see why adults call out Muppet-muppet day now.

4975
07:21:03,220 --> 07:21:07,220
Shibby please, Shibby please, what?

4976
07:21:07,220 --> 07:21:08,220
Yes.

4977
07:21:08,220 --> 07:21:10,220
Just place it.

4978
07:21:10,220 --> 07:21:12,220
What is your Bible?

4979
07:21:12,220 --> 07:21:15,220
It's in my Muppet-y mouth.

4980
07:21:15,220 --> 07:21:19,220
I promise you that Muppet-y slubby-tubby.

4981
07:21:19,220 --> 07:21:21,220
The Muppet-toppy.

4982
07:21:26,220 --> 07:21:27,220
I'm a Muppet.

4983
07:21:27,220 --> 07:21:28,220
I don't need fucking stuffing.

4984
07:21:28,220 --> 07:21:31,220
Muppets don't have stuff, actually, in my hand.

4985
07:21:31,220 --> 07:21:33,220
In my mouth, you can stuff them.

4986
07:21:33,220 --> 07:21:34,220
I don't know.

4987
07:21:34,220 --> 07:21:38,220
I suppose my Vavity Muppet mouth.

4988
07:21:39,220 --> 07:21:42,220
I can't do my Patreon voice.

4989
07:21:42,220 --> 07:21:45,220
It has to be a higher pitch in order for me to do that.

4990
07:21:45,220 --> 07:21:48,220
My Vavity Muppet mouth.

4991
07:21:48,220 --> 07:21:58,220
You want to make me a starch sock by learning?

4992
07:21:58,220 --> 07:22:05,220
I think I'll let you touch my Muppet-y buttons if you insist.

4993
07:22:05,220 --> 07:22:07,220
Go on.

4994
07:22:07,220 --> 07:22:09,220
Touch them.

4995
07:22:09,220 --> 07:22:12,220
Cut them in your little hand.

4996
07:22:12,220 --> 07:22:16,220
They are soft, are they not?

4997
07:22:16,220 --> 07:22:22,220
I'm made from the finest cotton, harem.

4998
07:22:22,220 --> 07:22:23,220
The Muppet chest is...

4999
07:22:23,220 --> 07:22:25,220
Yes, yes it is.

5000
07:22:25,220 --> 07:22:27,220
I am dead as cannon.

5001
07:22:27,220 --> 07:22:29,220
If you squeeze it, it makes a little...

5002
07:22:29,220 --> 07:22:31,220
Wait.

5003
07:22:33,220 --> 07:22:36,220
I was hoping I had a squeaky toy thing, but I don't.

5004
07:22:36,220 --> 07:22:38,220
That would have been really comical timing.

5005
07:22:38,220 --> 07:22:40,220
Fuck.

5006
07:22:44,220 --> 07:22:47,220
My tentacle is just staring me in the face.

5007
07:22:47,220 --> 07:22:52,220
I don't have anything within reach that can make a squeaky noise.

5008
07:22:52,220 --> 07:22:55,220
Man in a tentacle.

5009
07:22:55,220 --> 07:22:57,220
Coming into the...

5010
07:22:57,220 --> 07:23:00,220
I'm tired.

5011
07:23:06,220 --> 07:23:14,220
Hi, I'm Sheeby Cottonbum, and you're watching VLR Channel.

5012
07:23:14,220 --> 07:23:17,220
Bye-bye.

5013
07:23:20,220 --> 07:23:24,220
Brain shutting down.

5014
07:23:24,220 --> 07:23:27,220
A booba has a squeaker.

5015
07:23:27,220 --> 07:23:30,220
I'm gonna squeeze my own booba, actually.

5016
07:23:30,220 --> 07:23:33,220
Okay.

5017
07:23:33,220 --> 07:23:34,220
This is pay-picking.

5018
07:23:34,220 --> 07:23:37,220
What, excuse me?

5019
07:23:37,220 --> 07:23:39,220
Muppet furry PNGTuber.

5020
07:23:39,220 --> 07:23:42,220
We made a lot of products today.

5021
07:23:42,220 --> 07:23:47,220
Anyways, it's been fabulous, everyone.

5022
07:23:47,220 --> 07:23:50,220
I hope you enjoy today's Elden Ring Strip,

5023
07:23:50,220 --> 07:23:52,220
or I'll see you tomorrow.

5024
07:23:52,220 --> 07:23:53,220
At what time?

5025
07:23:53,220 --> 07:23:54,220
I don't know.

5026
07:23:54,220 --> 07:23:56,220
It'll be a gorilla.

5027
07:23:56,220 --> 07:23:59,220
Ooh, ah-ah-ah.

5028
07:23:59,220 --> 07:24:00,220
Good night.

5029
07:24:00,220 --> 07:24:02,220
And farewell.

5030
07:24:05,220 --> 07:24:08,220
I'm gonna muck-wuck-wuck on you.

5031
07:24:08,220 --> 07:24:10,220
Muppet fidget-tree?

5032
07:24:13,220 --> 07:24:17,220
Thank you, boy, for the T9.

5033
07:24:17,220 --> 07:24:19,220
Okay.

5034
07:24:21,220 --> 07:24:23,220
I guess I'll go now.

5035
07:24:23,220 --> 07:24:26,220
I guess this is where...

5036
07:24:26,220 --> 07:24:28,220
I wish I had one of those, like,

5037
07:24:28,220 --> 07:24:32,220
comical hooks to pull me slowly to the side.

5038
07:24:32,220 --> 07:24:35,220
Excuse you.

5039
07:24:35,220 --> 07:24:41,220
Why is it talking about fucking multiplayer anyways?

5040
07:24:44,220 --> 07:24:46,220
Exactly, Boomi.

5041
07:24:46,220 --> 07:24:47,220
Exactly.

5042
07:24:47,220 --> 07:24:49,220
Farewell.

5043
07:24:49,220 --> 07:24:51,220
Goodbye.

5044
07:24:52,220 --> 07:24:55,220
Now.

5045
07:24:55,220 --> 07:24:57,220
Now.

5046
07:25:18,220 --> 07:25:21,220
Yeah, you still smell pretty stinky.

5047
07:25:21,220 --> 07:25:23,220
Even with my muppet nose,

5048
07:25:23,220 --> 07:25:27,220
I can tell that you smell like a...

5049
07:25:27,220 --> 07:25:29,220
muppet-y...

5050
07:25:29,220 --> 07:25:31,220
mupp-puss.

5051
07:25:51,220 --> 07:25:54,220
Muppet.

5052
07:25:54,220 --> 07:25:57,220
Muppet.

5053
07:25:57,220 --> 07:26:00,220
Muppet.
