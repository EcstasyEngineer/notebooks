32
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Well, I didn't black out. No, it was not that bad not at all. It's more so like I got distracted. I

It's almost 2 a.m. Silly me. I should probably sleep

36
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,800
You didn't say you were like oh, I'm not that light and one and a half drinks does not put me black out

37
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,800
I'm not that that bad

38
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,120
It's good to see my neck is in one piece. It is indeed attached to my body

39
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Oh, no, I'm fine. Yeah, I uh

40
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,040

41
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,300
I'm sorry. I have to admit something I

42
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,720
Lied to you

43
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,300
It actually did I didn't notice until this morning, but it did cut my finger. I just never noticed I can

44
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
But it's fine

45
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
Just it's like it was a little little skin

46
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,720
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. I think I'm getting sick though. I

47
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,600
Think when I went grocery shopping yesterday morning at the store, there was like a bunch of sick people because now

48
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm feeling a wee bit ill. I got some tea

50
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Made it in my new teapot

51
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,040
Thank God because I was tired of microwaving my tea

52
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,440
And I know my British fans out there would be horrified to hear that I microwaved my tea

53
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,840
It's just easy to just throw it in there for like a minute 30 and I'm good

54
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
But now I have a nice tea kettle

55
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,260
So I've made myself some nice chamomile tea

56
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880

57
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,600

What uh, you don't you don't like microwave water microwave water is delicious

59
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,480
It's chamomile tea. I like I don't know why I'm drinking it

60
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,400
But it's like my favorite tea because it might make me sleepy

61
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,440
It's like a lavender chamomile like it's called sleepy time tea has a little cozy bear and he's you know

Very very interesting

97
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,000
And it's like just brings a whole new perspective to like how men head up

98
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Women can be

99
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,960

She be you've been streaming for five days and you've tased chat

167
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:06,700
You've talked about drinking breast milk. You don't many suspicious things on stream if anyone's getting like

168
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,100
Demonetized or their channel terminated first. It's probably gonna be me

169
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I

170
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,820
Sir impression is so good. Yeah, she has like a really

171
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,820
Sing song II dragged out

172
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
like voice

173
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,860
It's like she's thinking but then she also kind of has like a valet girl accent at the same

174
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,060
It's really like she'll be like, oh my no, she doesn't say oh my gosh at all. I don't know

175
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,060

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,700
Oh, I can one up that I can one up in all of that. Should I be wanting up in me?

178
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
So one time

179
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:05,500
In another era of she be I was streaming some lovely games with my with one of my friends

180
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,700
Toma you might know Toma keys and um, we were playing. I know we were doing

181
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,620
We were doing smash your pass on Pokemon

182
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,860
And um

183
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,260
So I I had eaten something. I think like I got like food poisoning. So I'm sitting there

184
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:32,460
I'm like, oh my god, like I really have to use the bathroom like if I fart like it's not gonna be good

185
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,980
Um

186
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:40,340
So I'm sitting and we're laughing and I'm about to be like, oh, let me I'm just gonna be or be real quick to run to

187
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,580
The bathroom and then we get a raid of like four hundred people

188
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
And I'm like, oh

189
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,300
Hi everyone, welcome to the stream

190
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,580
Oh, we're just we're just talking about Pokemon and I'm like trying so hard not to fart

191
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,300
And then I'm like, I'm sad as I said the guys guys you don't even I sat there for like 10 minutes

192
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,140
fighting for my life

193
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,420
Waiting for like I just wanted people to leave at that point like though

194
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,140
Because like I being a small stripper I was like, oh, I need to keep up the momentum

195
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,420
I need to I can't just like leave when they rate some is like, oh, you know what I

196
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,340
Will shit myself right now

197
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Maintain the numbers

198
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:39,420
Like oh, yes, let me continue to talk about how I would smash how I wouldn't smash any bird Pokemon because it's a fucking

199
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,820
But no, it was fine, I didn't you know, I can't one up in me because I didn't actually shit myself but afterwards I

200
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
Did like

201
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Low-pony can get it. Um, I

202
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
Did fight for my life on the bathroom

203
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,940
Sorry for the TMI, but you know as I mentioned I had a therapist point this appointment this morning

204
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,940
And I was like talking about you guys so

205
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,940
Like I said, I'm at all it's serious. So

206
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,220
You know

207
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,780
We had like you thought you were being parasol. No, I'm already talking to my therapist about you

208
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,380
It was like, oh my god

209
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:27,700
And it was great and like I had to send my therapist a bunch of stuff about vTubers just cuz she doesn't know what they are

210
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,780
It's moving too quickly. No, it's not moving fast enough

211
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,180
and

212
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,980
She's like, oh my gosh, I'm so proud of you because she knows I've been working towards being like a full-time streamer

213
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:46,060
No, you're not the abuse abuse of boyfriend. You're the sweetest you the sweetest little subby boyfriend a girl could ask for

214
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,020
Um

215
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:54,220
But so I told her so she she doesn't know like the full extent of like the content I make

216
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she was watching me right now

217
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Hi, Cheryl

218
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,500
But

219
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,940
She uh, I told her like

220
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:12,700
So I told her that my outfit is risque cuz she's like, oh, I told her that I got merch merch plug. Ooh market

221
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,860
And she's like, oh, I want to buy your merch and I'm like, I I don't think you should

222
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,260
Because I don't think I want and she's like this really sweet older woman. She's like

223
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,420
Middle-aged and she's she's like, let me support you

224
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,780
I don't like I feel like that's a breach of stuff, but I don't like she's been with me for years

225
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,860
so but I'm like

226
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
You should probably get a key chain

227
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,540
It not the shirt cuz she's like, I want a shirt. I'm like, I don't think you want a bondage bunny on a shirt

228
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,820
Yeah, I don't want some rude ain't wearing outside, you know what I don't even your support is all them like that's just

229
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,380
You don't have to wear it out. That's okay. If you rep me

230
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,820
honestly

231
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,260
Hell to the yeah, I don't even think I can wear my own merch outside because I just

232
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,020
Something deep down just tells me I'd be identified if I'm wearing my merch and then I like go to like

233
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,780
CVS or something and then I'm like, hey, I'd like to get like

234
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Some a pack of gum and they're just like

235
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,660
She be caught in by like I just feel like I would be

236
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,700
Noticed it's happened before I've had

237
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,300
When I was a flesh tuber someone I was working at my normal day job and someone's just like are you?

238
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,540
redacted and I'm like

239
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,380
No

240
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,180
They're just like wow you look exactly like her and I'm like wow, that's crazy

241
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,380
Anyways, did you want to buy anything else?

242
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
That's something that happened at the target

243
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,700
Yeah

244
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:59,140
And like even like I'm nervous to like say like oh I went to this place today because I'm like there is somebody out

245
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,060
There that will figure out exactly what store I'm at and be like triangulate my location

246
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,860
And then they'll see me be like oh my god, she's a rat and I'll be like

247
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
Yeah, I'm you I'm you oh she right

248
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,620
Redacted as my favorite streamer. Oh, yeah, I was a lot more based back then and politically incorrect

249
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,060
That's for sure being a former commentary youtuber

250
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:32,940
Immersion broken redacted is that honestly that would be a cool name for a streamer. Hey, what's up? I'm redacted. He just called her Daki. Oh

251
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:43,460
I got gen 2 a vtuber that's just covered in sensor bars and her name is redacted

252
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,660

259
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,340

That's in an agency. I've watched and even some indies. It's just fun

322
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,780
Like I like getting to know people. I just I just sit quietly in the chat though. I don't say anything cuz I'm too shy

323
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Yeah, I watched like um

324
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:48,020
Like before Mariah's debuts. Oh, those were so good. Like there's so many talented people in the community

325
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
So

326
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,860
Sorry

327
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,340
Mmm, yeah, like there's just like a lot of cool. Like I watched like mono and um

328
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
and alias and

329
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,740
Nova and stuff they're like the v4 mariah girls so creative and so where the in the pixel like girls

330
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,980
I always go for like comfy. Like I'm like, okay. Let me watch like, um

331
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,060
Like uh, chio or I'll watch, um

332
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,660
Me and uh, I can never pronounce anybody's names though. Um

333
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,420
Erlotte

334
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,060
But yeah talented talented yappers. Yes

335
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,900
Did you watch for the debuts for this new company called velar? Nah

336
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,620
Mean valier. Nah

337
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,660
No, yeah, I technically I watched our debuts like three times

338
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,940
Because we had to do we did some um test runs

339
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,540
Japanese

340
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,380
You're doing a summer art mind. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Thank you. I mean visaki. Yeah, then, you know, you mean visaki

341
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
You mean visaki

342
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,740
Okay, let's see

343
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
I think that's good

344
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,460
All the debuts stuff went so smoothly a test run. Oh, yeah. No, I really did it really did we prepared really hard

345
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,020
Um, it was really fun though. Just like the first time we did a test run

346
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,380
So we were like, okay, we'll meet for like three hours to be like to you know, the normal length of our debuts

347
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,380
We were probably together the entire day

348
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,980
I don't know if it was like

349
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:31,620
Five or six or seven hours because we were hysterically laughing at each other because we were just having so much fun

350
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,860
And then there'll be like technical issues

351
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:40,100
And so like we would all be in a discord call while we watch one of the girls like stream on a like a unlisted thing

352
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,980
And we just be like I remember

353
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,900
Like so azura's model has like really good eye tracking for some reason and so you can really see when she goes like

354
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,260
When she like shifts her eyes

355
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,340
So when she was looking at like um, like her talking points, she would just let be like

356
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,060
Anyways, and then like you thought so we were just die laughing every time she looked at her talking points

357
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:10,180
And like you could see it like um in our uh, our two point our no our debut collab where she's like kind of like shifty

358
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Eye looking at at icy

359
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,380
It was so funny

360
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,420
If you sucky debuts are okay except this weird bunny girl, I know right

361
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,140
You like the cotton mog girl. Nah, she was my least favorite. She's my least favorite

362
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,900
You know the eye tracking is good. We all have iPhones for eye tracking

363
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,020
Uh eye tracking with oh my god, there's kids running down the hallway behind me and that just scared me because they're like

364
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,060
iPhones are very good for their facial tracking. Um, I would

365
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,140
Like and also it's uh, it's also dependent on the rigor like a really good rigor

366
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,340
um can

367
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
Even if you like have a webcam

368
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,100
And it could almost make it seem like you're using vbridger because the tracking is just so good

369
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
So although I I don't have my

370
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,420
My model my phone plugged into my computer right now. So I'm going off at wi-fi. So I know my mouth tracking is like

371
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
You have samsung phone

372
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,700
How's how is it when you ruin group chats?

373
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,620
You love my hair drills. Yeah, I love my hair drills too because my hair is curly

374
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,860
I love curly hair

375
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,580
um, but

376
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,580
I can't draw my own hair though

377
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,220
It's hard to draw my own ringlets. It just looks like weird spaghetti

378
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,020
Hair arms for your next outfit. Yeah, I'll just be like one of the the arms characters

379
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,780
You love her side. I know is there a side eye is the best

380
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,940
As much as I just like apple their cameras are tracking are goaded, you know, it's not even like apples

381
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,660
cameras because samsung's cameras have a way higher

382
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,260
Like mega pixel amount. It's just like apple has this really good

383
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,500
Software for their cameras and I'm like if you married the two of like a samsung camera camera

384
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,260
And apple software or like android camera and apple software, then yeah, I am I am an apple fan

385
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,180
Um, just because just ease of their ecosystem, but like I do still like android

386
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,020
I just

387
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,220
For like modding everything, but they just have a terrible user interface

388
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,420
One of my friends is an android and I'll be on her phone and I'll be like she'll be like, oh, can you like

389
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,140
respond to this text for me? And I'm like, yeah, and I'm like

390
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Okay, so how do I go to the homepage?

391
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:34,020
How do I do this to broke for apple stuff on apple stuff is so freaking expensive. It's

392
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,140
ridiculous

393
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,940
I save I save a save like I because I didn't like they didn't I think they bought phones for the other girls

394
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,660
But I already had a phone. I saved for a very long time

395
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,300
to and I got

396
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
I got a 15 coming from a

397
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,540
11

398
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
something or other

399
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
xr

400
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Whatever

401
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,820
Although they also like

402
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
they just

403
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:08,020
I'm not I'm not gonna go rant about apple right now. I'm just like let's just talk about tech and glomerates

404
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Incorporations and greed

405
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,020
You mean how do I go that I know everything it's when you're used to something like maneuvering around

406
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,260
I'm just it's it's hard to like switch and go to the next one because like

407
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,420
I have a mac that I used for school and stuff and I do my my assignments on

408
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,660
And then but then I stream on a pc and like do everything games on a pc

409
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,580
so it's like

410
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,260
And so

411
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,100
It's annoying on a mac because it like everything scrolls in the opposite direction

412
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:44,500
So like I'll be on my pc and I would like have to like hop on my my mac book and then I'd be like, oh frick

413
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
How do I work this thing again?

414
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:54,340
Cancel the game we need to deconstruct capitalism. Well, you guys know the vibes I talk for like a yap for a bit

415
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,580
And then we get into the game

416
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,740
Apart from adding another camera every year we haven't I know

417
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,060
Yes, that's so true

418
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,340
Like it is it's frustrating for me because I was just like do I even I'm wondering what the 16 will look like like

419
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:14,500
I'm a huge tech head. I'm not gonna lie. Like I like to watch like the keynotes and wwdc and all that stuff

420
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,860
Um, just to see what's up and like how things are progressing like I like to see how um

421
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,180
Watch I'm gonna call it just like how apple will tackle

422
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,780
You know machine learning and AI and all that jazz just because like other like google's already on top of that

423
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,580
So it's just really fun. Like I like watching marcus brownlee and just his uh,

424
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,860
um breakdowns of stuff and also like other uh youtubers, uh

425
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,980
Tear downs I was like care downs. That's not it. They're not caring for the device that they're destroying

426
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,700
We yapp we game and yapp and the game and yapp the circle of yapp the circle

427
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,020
I know he I just like watching to um marcus brownlee. Why are you so cool? I'm not

428
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
I'm not cool

429
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,060
You just think I'm cool because we have similar interests stop it

430
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
Yeah

431
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,740
I'm a yabbit

432
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,580
Yes, I'm very much a yabbit

433
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,980
I worked for apple once they actually treated every employee very good in the work life balance pretty great as well

434
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,180
But overpriced his understanding. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, I had a friend who worked for apple as well

435
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:34,180
They said that it was good. Um, because they like what the heck they got like good benefits and stuff

436
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,180
And they like they paid well. So of course like and like retail is um, because they're like or whatever

437
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,900
The retail stores or whatever or their customer service calls

438
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,860
Like um could be pretty tough, but if like that if you have that and that's that's pretty good like

439
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,420
It's good that they treat their employees. Well, although I know like a lot of

440
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,420
um

441
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,780
tech companies right now are like laying off a lot of people because of everything during coveted

442
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,020
So I hope it doesn't seem like apple has been hit with that because I know google's had a lot of layoffs

443
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,780
Layoffs and it's because of like I for my what I went to school for although I I'll be honest with you

444
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,700
I didn't finish school

445
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,580
Because one I am a very indecisive person for my major

446
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,140
um, but I

447
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,940
So I was going to major in creative writing and then I changed it and then I was going to major in veterinary science

448
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,460
And then I changed it and then I was going to major in english because then I changed it

449
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,500
And then I was going to major in biology and then I changed it

450
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,260
And then I was going to major in um

451
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,260
Uh cyber security and then I changed it and then I was going to do it and then I changed it

452
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,660
And then I finally settled on

453
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,940
Software engineering and then I never finished

454
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
My parents are not happy with me

455
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,580
Oh, yeah, and I almost went to art school

456
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:04,900
How many years oh no, it was only like it was over the course of like three years no biggie

457
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,980
it's like

458
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,060
like I could go back and finish my software engineering degree, but

459
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
like I'm like

460
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,580
Like I was still in school when I start like a like a couple months ago, but

461
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,380
I'll be honest. I wanted to focus on streaming

462
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,940
And I know that's probably not the best thing to do, but I was

463
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:33,940
I was just super passionate about fulfilling because I've had dreams of being a content creator. Um since I was a

464
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
Since when I was

465
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
I don't know how old was I a wee child

466
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,020
In my parents like laughed at me and stuff

467
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,700
I remember when I was I used to uh, I was a nice flush tube and uh twitch

468
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
My mom's like you're gonna get abducted

469
00:39:52,820 --> 00:40:00,420
I saw someone say before it was it was yeeted by a mod you failed art school. No, I didn't fail art school

470
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,660
I never went to art school. I though I did want to major in illustration

471
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,140
Um, but I didn't end up going to art school

472
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,580
I want to be with my friends when I should have gone to like a vocational school

473
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,860
For because I almost went for like a vocational school for um veterinary medicine, but yeah, my mom was is very uh

474
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Not happy with me

475
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,060
But when I'm like mom look, I'm streaming. She's but like, you know, my parents

476
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:31,460
They're very supportive of me now because um, I they saw my determination

477
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,780
um

478
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,380
And my motivation and like, you know, like I still have a day job

479
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,380
Um, and I was still going to school while I was streaming but now

480
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,660
Since I have VLR. I was like, you know what? Let me put a pause on that

481
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,100
You have like I have so much time in the world to finish school, you know

482
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,660
Yeah, you can't you can always go back to school

483
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,020
You can't join a VTB agency every day a hundred percent. Um

484
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,580
and

485
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,660
Yeah, then I can save and pay off my school debt that I have accumulated

486
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,540
A day job for now. Yeah, like again, I've said it multiple times if I can stream full time that'd be cool

487
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,940
like uh, so

488
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,940
I do want to yeah, I've already said this before as well. Um the first two weeks

489
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,740
of

490
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:24,100
After debut, I am pretty much streaming every day, but it's going to change because I have to go back to my day job

491
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:31,300
Um, so it'll be I'll be honest with you. My stream times may change and be inconsistent. I'll still stream like

492
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,620
maybe

493
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,260
Like five. Yeah, at least five times a week in like two days off. Um

494
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,620
It do me

495
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,260
But uh, please don't mind me if school debt it hurts

496
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,700
Yeah, do it makes you happy. This brings me joy. This brings me happiness

497
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,380
Um

498
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,580
And obviously like you need to be realistic and stuff when it like comes to money and like getting a degree and everything

499
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:59,060
But honestly, it feels like a degree meant something 10 years ago. And now it doesn't anymore

500
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,020
See like I'm trying to like minimize my burps if you guys are gonna rate me so low. I'm going to go harder with my burps

501
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
Ever try to cover your burp with a fart

502
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
And I've tried to cover my fart with a burp

503
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,260
Yeah

504
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,740
Done in time and so I choose to draw my own type nice nice

505
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,420
Sometimes I felt like I feel like it never meant anything. Well, like school. Yeah to the degree

506
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,260
That's what I hear

507
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:33,060
Like my parents didn't go to school like my dad never finished college and neither did my mom and then they're but they're very

508
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Like my mom if she did go to school

509
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:42,020
She would be running like a fortune 500 company right now like 100. She's such a smart ambitious woman if you want like, you know like like

510
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,660
Uh minus like the dying of some unknown disease

511
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,580
My mom really reminds me of queen just like and not she didn't

512
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,980
Teach me to be a woman of the night

513
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,020
But like she's just like this entrepreneurial like really smart like

514
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,140
Bad-ass woman and she always wears

515
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:06,820
Work outfits just more appropriately appropriately clothed instead of myself

516
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,700
So because like I remember I showed her my model

517
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:16,020
And she's in the lore and everything and she's like, oh my gosh, this reminds me of me. I'm like mom

518
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:28,340
And I didn't show it to my dad. I just I just showed the neck up to my dad because my dad would be like you harlot

519
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:37,300
But mommy, sorry mom, uh woman of the night sounds like a Batman rip off

520
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,700
But um

521
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,740
No, yeah, like I just I just wanted to do stuff that makes me happy and yapping makes me happy

522
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,340
Um, yeah, I can always go back to school. Um

523
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,540
I could finish I probably have like two more years left of of school

524
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,260
but

525
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:02,740
Excuse your lateness. No terrible somebody flog him mods flog him. I have to fart now though

526
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,580
She's just like me for real for real. She'd be small. Yeah, just like it's more so like oh office woman

527
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,660
That kind of gets like gypped for a lot of things

528
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,740
Um, I didn't know I could have that sort of power thank god that's this that's too that's too funny actually

529
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,300
Oh, that's

530
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,060
You don't know what you've created

531
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,060
She

532
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,100
Maybe she had a chapter in her life, you don't know about I highly doubt that my mom is not like that at all

533
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,260
I'm in danger

534
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,100
Mother merciless

535
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,820
Tactical

536
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,460
Um

537
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:03,620
But yeah, I just can't wait to see where we'll go in the next like year or so year two or three or four or five or six

538
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,620
You're never getting rid of me

539
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,780
I'm never leaving you're stuck with me now. I hope you know that

540
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:19,060
Um, sorry that was a yondery moment. It was so weird sometimes it just happens

541
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,460
Okay

542
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
Good mercy impression

543
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,180
Shall we play a game?

544
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,580
Oh don't look at my desktop though

545
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,580
I

546
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,860
It's just my tits

547
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,900
So yeah, you see like you know how that was just right now

548
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,860
um, so when

549
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:02,420
Some of you guys know the story the other day. In fact, I'm gonna stick myself down here. Um, just so my boobies aren't

You know how I mentioned like those maintenance guys came in I had my headphones on they knocked on the door

00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,340
Um, I didn't hear them

554
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:23,380
So they just let themselves in thinking I wasn't home to do some like just change my filters and check my water and stuff

555
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,940
so I just have

556
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,980

712
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:59,380

He can hear my footsteps. I forgot that he can hear my footsteps as well

726
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,620

01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,460
Mother

821
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,460
Mama

822
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,420
Oh, there's another tape recorder

823
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:57,620
Jenna Ruby and I went to see Esther yesterday Ruby always loved seeing her grandmother. No, no, she calls her

824
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:02,100
She's not been doing so well in recent months. She went around the other weekend. I can't

825
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,220
Hear the tape over your fucking

826
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,340
dumb ass music. Um

827
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,340
We had to shake her to snap out of it and then she was just fine like nothing had happened

828
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:19,380
She has dementia god knows how long she's been doing that for we booked her for a doctor's appointment

829
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,020
I'm supposed to be recording ideas for new novel

830
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,540
Yeah, oh, why do I feel like there's a tape in the bedroom?

831
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,340
But I didn't see it there has to be a tape in here

832
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:44,260
It would not make sense if there was not a tape in here

833
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,820
I love sheepie cotton book

834
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:55,060
Hi, mercy

835
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,780
Why would there be a tape in the bedroom? Hey

01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,700
Wait, wait, hold on. Let me get let me get real close

837
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,180
Hey, I want to make a movie

838
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,420
I

839
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:15,620
Someone open the blinds like go open the curtains

840
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,460
You know what that sound is not as footsteps this is ass clapping

841
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,340
Uh, it's I'm going

842
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,980

Have his has his eyes gotten creepier

844
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:58,820
Mr. Hopps kind of thick damn

845
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,500
My ass cheeks are clapping so loud it's alerting the guards

846
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,620
Oh, well shit, let me just eat

847
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:14,580
I'm waiting for him to just like walk forward

848
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:24,900
Can I like go in these rooms? No, okay, anything in here? No

849
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:33,620
It's coming closer. It's RT to run it. It's not working. Oh

850
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,340
Oh

851
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,100
Our art right trigger is to quit

852
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,420
This doesn't work

853
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:50,740
I'm like holding that I'm doing I'm pressing every button trying to run on controller

854
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,340
Yeah

855
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,340
Yeah

856
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,700
Yeah

857
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,220
I just don't know why it doesn't want to work in controller

858
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,820
He's coming back

859
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:25,940
Press the quit button to run all time for my work. You're right. Let me try that. Give me a second after this though

860
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,700
Anything over here? No

861
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,740
Yep

862
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:49,380
Jenna and I stopped to see Esther again today. The place was so filthy. Wait, is this David? Is this the husband?

863
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,100
I'm not sure how it would have

864
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:58,100
Got her so bad so quickly Esther doesn't seem to be keeping herself clean either and it's almost like she didn't recognize us

865
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:03,940
Her appointment is tomorrow. Jenna is worried that she might have to go into care. I'll keep this documented

866
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,180
I hope ruby doesn't have to see her like this

867
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,700
Please

868
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,500
I'm stuck in this

869
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:17,140
Ah, yes

870
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,180
Ah, we love to see it

871
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,780
For the love of christ, please let me out of this

872
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,100
Ah

873
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,180
Guys i'm not having a good time

874
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,140
Oh my god

875
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,860
It's free on steam

876
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,740
I

877
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:01,620
Got please I want to play the game. I want to know what happens

878
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,580
But I also don't want to have to go through stuff again. Oh my god

879
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,460
I'm like, is it me? Am I just stupid like

880
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:20,100
Maybe I am holding the button. I've held it. I've held it

881
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:28,260
I'm holding it

882
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,380
What is happening

883
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,900
Okay, I game whatever

884
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,780
Let's go for the second tape

885
01:21:54,820 --> 01:22:00,260
Why is this game being so mean to you? I don't know it's already I don't know

886
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:07,060
Is he gone

887
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:13,300
No, that's because I tabbed out like a bitch this game hates bunnies this game is

888
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,700
You know, it's very discriminatory

889
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:23,060
Just because my estranged uncle just looks a little different doesn't mean

890
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:26,420
Oh

891
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,700
He isn't deserving of love and affection

892
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,700
Yep, oh fuck it

893
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:49,140
Ha ha bitch a two bitch

894
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,620
I

895
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,300
If I do this

896
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:00,100
I don't know. Well, it doesn't matter anymore. I was gonna like trigger the toy

897
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:12,180
Okay, there's nothing upstairs it doesn't really matter if I do that

898
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,860
It's laying on everything

899
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,260
Oh see now it's working now it's working

900
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,140
Why is he quiet

901
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,500
Is he in my room

902
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,140
What

903
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:54,260
Why does he sound like he's over here? Why is there no tape in my room?

904
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:58,820
I bet if I set the the bear off he would like come running in my room

905
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:04,900
Okay, let me just yep running start

906
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,340
I don't hear him on this floor

907
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,580
Yeah

908
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:21,140
Oh

909
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,500
If I stand from the hole will he get me

910
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,620
All right, I need to go

911
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,300
For all the tapes

912
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:59,940
There wasn't any over here, but again my game bugged out so who knows

913
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,180
I need a Christmas tree

914
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,260
Then a Honda lightning Mcsheebie

915
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,100
That's fine

916
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:31,380
I offer you an accord I offer you an accord I usually can do um her voice

917
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:39,700
Wait, you know what this calls for actually no I can't

918
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,980
Because

919
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,580
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do

920
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,900
Where the fuck are these tapes

921
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:03,060
I feel like they're just randomly around the house from places I've already been

922
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:14,580
I did not expect if he's supposed to change like that that was good. Thank you

923
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:20,820
Yeah, I offer you an accord it's just a Honda accord she be type R

924
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:29,460
I did it nothing happened now what?

925
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,420
I have to restart the game

926
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,820
I'm plug-and-replug. Oh honda type R. Oh

927
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,660
No, no cars, okay

928
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,940
Leave me alone

929
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:17,380
I

930
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,340
Sir one in here

931
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:32,120
Guys, I think the game's bugged

932
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,540
Oh

933
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,700
I set up for a split second

934
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,580
Caught me again

935
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,460
Oh, I almost landed in the car

936
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:24,420
Wondering how set three AM's simulator literally

937
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:42,180
Please

938
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,900
I

939
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:58,420
Why is it back here

940
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:08,100
As I'm recording this ashes in the hospital her neighbors called the police in the early hours of the morning because I'm stretching

941
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:10,420
Oh

942
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:15,460
Stretching her mother out because they could hear his screaming. She'll be there for a few days

943
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:20,500
We told ruby that she had a fall and she's okay. We're basing on diagnosis. She's crazy

944
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,740
Yeah, I'm trying to find the damn tapes

945
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:32,340
Walking back and forth around this house like a motherfucker

946
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,820
You

947
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,140
Touching what what?

948
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,220
Is there any tapes in here?

949
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:48,500
We took ruby to the hospital to see her nana her banana

950
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:57,940
It's not stupid ester made a soft toy for her could mr. Hope a small rabbit ester always knitted her clothes and toys

951
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:03,060
Ruby was thankful, but I must admit this toy does have a look to it

952
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,740
Something quite unsettling

953
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:12,500
That's why we really yeah, my uncle he's coming to you know

954
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:15,780
Take care of the house

955
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:18,340
Take care of everything

956
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:23,460
Banana oh

957
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,460
Yeah, see that's what I totally meant to say

958
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:32,900
I hate when my dead grandma haunts my toys you're wrong. No

959
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,180
I have to toot

960
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:49,460
Toot accomplished, you know what this calls for

961
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,020
An uncrossable

962
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:01,540
Like the ASMR you guys didn't even hear it. How can you?

963
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:17,620
Peanut butter and strawberry jam

964
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,060
No, I didn't pull an emmy

965
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,500
Um

966
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,700
If you don't know what uncrossable is it's essentially

967
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:43,540
Two slices of white bread. It's a PB and J

968
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:47,620
Just cut off the corners and seal them and it's a circle

969
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,260
Booby is eyeing my uncrossable

970
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,260
You can't have any

971
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:19,620
Just a wee snack

972
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,580
I

973
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:29,620
I've only had to waffle and uncrossable today. I should probably have something protein or veggie based

974
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:37,060
Are they better than just making one? Yes, the bread is so soft and

975
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,700
Definitely unhealthy for you

976
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,900
strawberry toaster's drool. I haven't had toaster's drool since I was

977
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,020
Unnugget

978
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,900
We already said this

979
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:57,700
Since I was a wee nugget stop it stop it

980
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:03,380
Bust it down Tatiana bust it down bust it down thought the other buses that

981
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,660
Looks like I like spilled milk everywhere

982
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,500
Looks like I superhero landed

983
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,500
Yeah

984
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:21,700
No, no, it's not that

985
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:27,140
That's fucked up. This is literally a fucking kid

986
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,540
Oh my god, his face is getting more fucked up

987
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:37,780
Can I leave now

988
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,740
Okay

989
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:46,020
His mouth is just open

990
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,020
Now he's coming closer I must ran for it

991
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,580
How does he teleport up the stairs so fast?

992
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:58,580
Oh

993
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:14,580
Booby I'm so sorry. I just scared you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh big man. I'm so sorry. I scared you

994
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:23,220
Give a timer before you die like Sonic

995
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:26,980
That got me again

996
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,700
Oh, I can go in through that way. Oh, that's so much easier

997
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,580
She would talk to us like that

998
01:34:54,180 --> 01:35:01,140
Hey, uh, welcome to your first day on the job. Uh, thanks for taking it, you know

999
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,860
There was a lot of people that didn't want to take this job

1000
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,300
Hello

1001
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,380
The fuck

1002
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:24,180
How do you know it was me that picked up

1003
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:33,300
All right for the 50th time, let's try my parents bedroom

1004
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,020
All right

1005
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:47,460
Sorry, uh-huh mark. Hello

1006
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:49,460
Hello

1007
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,060
Hello

1008
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,500
All right, this is

1009
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:01,860
I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Fuck. Fuck him. Fuck him. Fuck him. Fuck him

1010
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,980
Okay, there must be one up here now

1011
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:19,940
Yes, the little girl is Ruby

1012
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:23,620
Don't look in the drawers. Oh, I almost went for it

1013
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:27,460
This is literally walking simulator

1014
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:37,220
Back from the bar fitting named purgatory. That's funny bar called purgatory. Oh, thank god

1015
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,780
We just had a call as they're passed away in her sleep

1016
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:45,220
The doctors couldn't give us diagnosis and even said the sudden passing is bizarre

1017
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:53,300
You'll have to tell Ruby when she oh a demon did it a demon did it. Oh a demon did it

1018
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,580
Oh, sorry boomie

1019
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,700
I realized I didn't put my

1020
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:07,860
wrist rest back and I'm like, why is my wrist hurt because my on the edge of my

1021
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:11,860
Bad desk

1022
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,060
It was mr. Hopps

1023
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:17,220
He was hopping

1024
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,620
I don't like that noise that doll made

1025
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:32,020
Okay, is there one over here

1026
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:38,900
There has to be one in my room. Okay, it must be in my parents room then

1027
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:48,180
Yeah

1028
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,860
Yeah

1029
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:57,300
All right, don't forget I have no sense of direction

1030
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:05,940
What up she be how is everyone um poorly navigating a game

1031
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:09,780
And I have to sneeze again

1032
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,060
Boom boom

1033
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:18,340
The sound of my ass cheeks is alerting the guards so I can't do a snake voice though

1034
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:23,780
Oh, you see that oh fuck

1035
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:49,140
I sleep I was knocked out

1036
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:04,980
Fainted oh jump scare. Oh, whatever

1037
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:10,660
Hmm, let me check this one more time. Okay

1038
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,300
I

1039
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:23,620
September 22nd Ruby hasn't been on her best behavior since the news

1040
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:28,740
We got to take her slingshot away because she won't stop firing pellets at the toy rabbit

1041
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:31,460
She said it protects her from it. It's just a toy

1042
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:37,380
We've had to lock the slingshot away since ruby kept finding it jenna keeps the key under a houseplant in the hallway. I think

1043
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:44,900
Why is her father just record tapes?

1044
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:51,860
Like who does that in this day and age? Is that a house plate in the hallway?

1045
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:56,580
Is this a house plate in the hallway? There's a lot of houseplants in the hallway

1046
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,300
Hmm

1047
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,860
Yo, oh, I'm not gonna make it. I made it

1048
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,420
Wait

1049
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,460
Check

1050
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,220
Which hallway?

1051
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,740
Which houseplant be more specific? How are you ever gonna remember?

1052
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,180
Right in funny noises me

1053
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,460
Hello

1054
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:32,420
I'm literally pressing everything. Oh my god. I got it

1055
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:36,260
Okay, but then now where

1056
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,300
is

1057
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:44,820
Like where is it stored? He didn't say where it was stored. Yeah journal pages would make more sense

1058
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:52,900
Fuck fuck

1059
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:03,300
I'm assuming it's back in their bedroom

1060
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:11,620
Go go. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I ran out of shit

1061
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:22,660
Okay, but there's a fucking safe in here

1062
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:25,380
Huh

1063
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:36,900
Oh, April 18th

1064
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:48,180
Big brain what? Hello

1065
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:51,940
I press the wrong button

1066
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:58,740
Please oh wait, they're British. Maybe it might go in the opposite direction

1067
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:10,180
Okay, well

1068
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:12,580
Ah

1069
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:22,820
British time British is not the proper way

1070
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,900
That's dumb. Oh, can I shoot him?

1071
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:32,980
Wait, how do I shoot?

1072
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:36,740
I fucked up the controls. I had to use the other thing I had to use

1073
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,740
Oh

1074
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,900
Oh

1075
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,940
Okay, let's go

1076
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,260
Fuck you

1077
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:57,620
I got this this is where the game begins

1078
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:01,700
In the early version of the game it was a gun

1079
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,940
She just gets a fucking gun

1080
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:20,660
Oh, where is he where is he come here, bitch

1081
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:26,020
I'm ready for you. It's hard to these controls

1082
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,300
Oh

1083
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,100
This is very tense

1084
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:55,620
What I don't understand about this game is that

1085
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:59,220
I don't know how the how the

1086
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,740
Game mechanic works because you know like a 3d game like you know

1087
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:06,580
There can be rooms like stacked on each other that you go through and that's how you progress like um

1088
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:11,300
But like I'm wondering why can I hear the monster right here?

1089
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:13,460
Is there like technically another part of this?

1090
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:16,340
Where he's on the other side

1091
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:18,340
like I don't

1092
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,360
Is another room that just does it oh

1093
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:31,220
It's so fucking tense

1094
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:38,740
You

1095
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:50,500
Objective kill mr. Hopps she got the Glock. Yeah, I mean it's probably the basement

1096
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:01,540
I have a sneeze again

1097
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:07,780
Well now I know he does not gonna come so I don't really care

1098
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:21,460
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Oh, what I couldn't leave

1099
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:31,060
All right

1100
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,100
I

1101
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:41,060
Need a jump shot. Oh, maybe maybe I do need a jump shot. Yeah

1102
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:45,140
Yeah

1103
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,500
Go for his ankles

1104
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:58,340
I don't know I think I'm too short

1105
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,260
I think I'm too short

1106
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:10,740
Because I can't go back up

1107
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:18,180
Is my game bugging again

1108
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:21,140
Oh

1109
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,300
Am I hmm, maybe

1110
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,820
Okay, I'll I'll I'll test y'all's theory

1111
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:38,260
So you see the little red because there's a cool you can't see it past me because my head is fucking huge

1112
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,260
But there's a cool down

1113
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,740
Um meter

1114
01:46:48,180 --> 01:46:50,180
I

1115
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:52,740
Can't

1116
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,340
I didn't do anything different that time

1117
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,340
I didn't do anything different

1118
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:08,180
All I did was

1119
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:11,300
Do I have to like start up here and then I don't

1120
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,940
Might get make sense

1121
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:23,220
Can I call for help? Nope. Oh, what the fuck are the controls again?

1122
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:32,740
Oh

1123
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:35,860
Why is it saying that

1124
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:43,220
Weird I don't know why it's acting like I can do something. Can I leave now?

1125
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:47,940
No, I don't want to give my nana a big kiss

1126
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,780
It's time to kill nana

1127
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:56,740
Fuck you nana. Oh

1128
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:57,940
Fuck you

1129
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:59,940
Fuck you fuck

1130
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:05,300
Nope, I'm good

1131
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:12,260
Oh god

1132
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:14,260
Oh

1133
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:17,460
Okay

1134
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,520
What police stay where you are

1135
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:33,220
What the fuck

1136
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:35,220
I

1137
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,220
I

1138
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:58,980
It seems like you guys are just as confused as me how I escaped when they grabbed me

1139
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:07,140
That doesn't make any sense. Can I replay that?

1140
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:11,620
I'm replaying that

1141
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:28,180
I can't go any faster

1142
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,460
I

1143
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,860
Can't even like get out of this

1144
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,980
They don't even explain

1145
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:48,900
Why the police were there shoot the hand what if you fought instead of escaping okay, let's try it

1146
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:56,580
But it says to run though

1147
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:00,980
I

1148
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:06,980
Yeah, I don't I don't think that works

1149
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:10,740
Maybe your neighbor called them. Oh, that makes sense

1150
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,100
You shift to that's what I've been using shift to spread

1151
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:20,100
I read yours like chef that's right

1152
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,740
I

1153
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:32,340
Didn't notice that three times that I did that. Okay, let's try to outrun the thingy my barber

1154
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,740
I

1155
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:01,620
It's weird the first time

1156
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:05,860
That I got put in the situation the hand didn't spawn for a really long time

1157
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:09,140
And that was the only reason I was caught because I thought I could turn around and shoot at it

1158
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:11,140
And that's why I paused for a bit the first time

1159
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,860
So I don't know

1160
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:17,620
The game obviously is bucky, but it's like a you know, it's like just an indie game

1161
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,740
I'll try one more time. I'm gonna make it

1162
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,100
It's the same ending

1163
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:51,220
Was it my grandma? Was she possessed? I don't

1164
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,980
Okay

1165
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:06,340
All right

1166
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:10,020
Nice

1167
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:24,020
Anything past the door, I don't think so. Well, this game is what hold on. Let me see how old it is

1168
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,060
It came out in 2019

1169
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:34,900
This thing is very positive

1170
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:47,780
Achievements are broken somebody said oh someone else said you get capped like it is the same ending

1171
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:51,380
And then it makes zero sense

1172
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,780
Yes

1173
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:59,460
Thumbs up haha British funny. Okay, so it seems like it's supposed to be like that

1174
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:03,060
Thought there was an ending where you burned down the house

1175
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:06,420
What

1176
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:18,100
The other ending is a secret ending they made a prequel. Yeah, I know there's a second one

1177
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,900
I'm like I'm playing the free one though

1178
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:31,620
What's this there's an ending where I burned down the house, what do you well now I'm looking up a walk through

1179
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,540
Don't mind if I do

1180
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:42,740
I

1181
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:03,780
Plus collect the first tape then you go back to the kitchen and you get lighter fluid

1182
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:14,100
After you collected all the tapes find the slingshot then shoot

1183
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:19,380
Mr. Hop six times go left shoot a pot on the side table that is near you and you get a box of matches

1184
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:24,260
You see some pieces of paper once you're staying on the piece of paper press e or z to set them on fire

1185
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:34,820
That is so elaborate for no reason and I like spammed everything in the kitchen after I got the first tape

1186
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:38,500
I didn't see any of the lighter fluid

1187
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:42,980
I

1188
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:50,500
Yeah, people said that it also wouldn't let them light the paper. Okay. Well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna bother playing through all that

1189
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:58,660
Got the arson, but yeah ending those already. Yeah, it seems like you have to I'd have to like start

1190
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:01,620
I'm like, I don't feel like doing all that. I don't feel like doing all that

1191
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,100
Oh

1192
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:16,340
Hold on let me move over a bit and we can chat a bit

1193
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:19,060
That's a little wee cheeky chat in it

1194
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:24,180
It's juice. Oh, no, it's not Tuesday. Tuesday's yesterday and I didn't even say it's juicy in it

1195
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:25,860
dumb

1196
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:27,860

1197
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:34,580

There we go

1200
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:53,140
Oh man

1201
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:56,740
So

1202
01:55:56,740 --> 01:56:04,340
What do you think of my game skills? Okay, so I've been really uh validated the past few days playing uh

1203
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:09,460
Playing these games that have bugs in them because then I'm like, oh, is it me? Is it me?

1204
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:13,380
It's not me. Sometimes the game is bugged and that makes me feel a lot better

1205
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:17,060
I was positively glowing. She'd be flash bomb

1206
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,260

1209
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,700
