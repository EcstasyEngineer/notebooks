00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,400

Feel like I I'm extra my physics or extra-physicking right now for some reason

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,800
Yes, you unlocks of the gotcha where you can't spend real-life money what you have to gotcha for characters. Okay, I

44
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Don't know what the question mark is. Let me have a shop

49
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
corrected myself

50
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Hello

51
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm moon gravity in my own donkano

52
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
I

53
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm sorry

54
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,960
Guys, and I'm not gonna know everybody. I'm not I'm gonna tell you right now. I'm not gonna know everyone

55
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,720
Because I don't watch a lot of the Japanese holo because I don't really watch people that I don't know the language

56
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
I

57
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't watch a lot of holo. I watch like maybe like a couple of them and

58
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,080
That's okay. You can revoke my card. I'm sorry

59
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
It's all right, but I understand

60
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,160
So I can play as a meal it's merely have a freaking gun

61
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Girl

62
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Mid-range stab attack. Okay, maybe she'll be like Hades the pixels are pixel art so cute

63
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,240
Tentacle shoots out front. I do I love Ina. You know design is awesome Kiara

64
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,860
She has a little sword. Oh my god, it's like a Phoenix feather. I love it

65
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,880
Little chicken feather and then you got Mori

66
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm I'm wondering so let me see 90

67
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
She's lost speed

68
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
She's HP

69
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Amelia's the most balance

70
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,040
You know has no crit hits, which are you we think she would have a little bit of a higher crit hit

71
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Although Mori has a

72
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,840
Pretty good crit hit as well. She's hella. She's also as balanced as Gura. I might go a Mori

73
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Yeah, I think Mori is actually the most balance

74
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,760
We'll do Mori defeat the last botch but I need a

75
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
Forgot to you guys can't hear anything

76
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200

77
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Reaper rapper. Yeah, I saw you guys

79
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,600
guessing, but I'm like, I don't know. We'll see

80
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
I'm like, what did you bet?

81
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Take sound should be fine

82
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Oh

83
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay

84
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Okay

85
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,880
Left stick to toggle or right stick to aim. Oh I can aim. Okay. Oh

86
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, I like how they're oh, I like how they're um

87
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,680
Like cover things. Oh, this is pretty cool for each target to feed increase attack by two

88
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,000
This is yeah, like whatting witch or vampire survivor

89
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,160
Increase damage by 20% fire a fast piercing tail target a random target. Oh

90
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Give me that I'll do the first one

91
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,120
Nice I can just walk around them the too bad the fans have ended up like this

92
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,880
Hamburger as hell if I presume who is this little guy? It's skelly

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:16,160
All the skeletons help I'm so sorry Mori. I didn't think we'd all get circled

96
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Oh

97
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
What's the gold

98
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,040
Targets within a hundred pixels take 10% extra damage he started to feed increase attack by 3% for certain

99
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,480
Oh, I could literally just do that up. Okay, but orbiting boy. Oh books

100
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
That's so funny

101
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,400
Gain a shield that absorbs up to 15 damage every 56 shield refreshes. Okay

102
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,920
I'll just I'll just do that. Oh god

103
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
It's nice that I can aim

104
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,160
Although I think someone did mention to me in wedding which I don't have to I can't I don't have to auto aim

105
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,960
You get that something that could be turned off. I like this one because it's a sweeping arc

106
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I feel like I kill more

107
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,800
And it's I wonder if I can get the speed up for it. What is this? Oh

My god, can I run what is this? Okay, the hell that scared me I

Okay, yeah, see it like I know they're about someone said they're about to do like an update or something. Oh

Need another upgrade when we go down here. Maybe I'll grab some stuff

Not telling

567
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,280
Probably something you've played before probably something similar

568
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,360
It is based off of a very popular game

569
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,160
The genre is smug sheebie

577
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,880
It's a game. You've probably played before you're going to enjoy it. It's very nice very well made

578
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,760
Either some spicy stuff in it

579
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,720
You're gonna like it

580
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,880
It better be a smash cool. That would be pretty awesome. Actually, it's not but that would be sick

581
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,240
It's dnd. We just made we just made balder's gate made a whole balder's gate except it's us

So you can romance us in balder's gate. No kidding. Is it who need pop?

584
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,840
No

585

I'm not gonna tell you I'm not gonna tell you

586
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,520
Smashing

All right

588
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,280
I

589
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,600
Throw an onigiri in an arc

590
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,840
Okay, how do I use my super how do I use my alt?

591
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Feeler smash

592
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,200
I actually forget what the game is called. I know I have that

593
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,600
Oh, what is it?

594
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,960
Oh, I just remembered it

595
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,320
It's actually it's funny because it's a play on words because you know how you know how strong he is

596
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:02,560
Um, I'm gonna play uh, I kind of a play not as mume yet. I want to play

597
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,000
I think it's natural I play as

598
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
Gura

599
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,720
If she wasn't you don't think she knows something else I click when bar is full

600
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Okay

601
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:40,960
It's pretty good mid-range attack. It's pretty like it almost gets me to the end of the screen

602
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,960
What bar the bar that's I thought that's my level though

603
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:56,240
Okay, the song is kind of making me go a little crazy

604
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,480
Only the littlest bit

605
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,760
Short height grants if you just dodge an attack

606
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,600
Oh

607
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,280

608
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,640
I don't really understand this one gain 15 max hp for every six points of total max hp

609
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Okay, so I get more hp. Let me do that then

610
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,100
Oh, okay, I don't know what I pressed

611
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,920
Why am I on fire? I'm on fire. I don't know how to do Gura's voice

612
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,440
No, I don't know how to do Gura's voice. I'm not going to try I feel I have I haven't listened to her

613
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,160
Gura streaming a little bit

614
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,720
Oh

618
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
Oh, I see now I see the bar

Shork

622
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,240
I don't know what this means. I'm picking it because it sounds cool

623
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,680
I don't know what my cats are doing

624
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,160
I

625
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:33,600
This would be great for me to do this shark thing for some crowd control right now. Let me see if I can just skirt the edge

626
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,160
I'll do the food. I can't do it yet. Oh, no, I can

Power Atlantis

629
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,200
That was pretty neat

630
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,280
Press play

631
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:17,200
Sorry I wanted some crowd control stuff

632
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,640
The whirlpool is pretty nice

633
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,720
I try to play a little bit differently what?

634
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,680
I

635
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:50,480
Wait, what a bar. Oh, oh interesting

636
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320

Ah

642
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:48,960
There's so much of these on the ground. I wish I could pick more up. It's so weird that a plug tail comes out

643
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:04,400
Okay, I don't see any arrows on my screen sometimes the little shot that comes from her throws me off and I think it's an arrow

644
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,320
Oh

01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,560

Do that in a bit. I need to think I need to loop around them and do it

658
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,240

660
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:29,680

I never realized how much I like games like these and wedding which definitely showed me that

673
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,240
You should probably play vampire survivor at some point

674
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:25,360
The orange thing no the aren't the alligators. Yeah, those are the teammates. I meant the orange ones

Not the not the crocodiles

677
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,200
Shrimps, okay, I couldn't tell if they were shrimps. They look like dragons

678
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,120

01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,680
Oh, what is that?

693
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:45,040
How convenient, okay, uh, let's do that. Oh, did I grab credit card yet? I don't think I did upgrade the nurse horn

694
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,320
I

695
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,320
Loop around and do a little whoa, bam

696
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,480
Ow, I feel like the L just sped up and I just oh god

697
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,880
Not the laser

698
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,560
Ow

699
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
I miss ahead

700
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,120
Oh

701
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,840
This man is already to take the chateau

702
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,880
I

703
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,800
Think I did it when the thing was nearby I couldn't really tell

704
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,680
Sometimes when I'm not looking at the little little white and black dudes

705
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,960
I they look like question marks and I'm not looking at their faces

706
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,440
Ah

707
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,680
I like how these have pompadours little rat guys. I thought that was neat

708
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,720
Oh my god

709
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,800
You're still alive

710
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,600
See an arrow I'm going for it

711
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:03,920
God it's fine. Oh my god. They like latch on to you. Holy crap

712
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,000
I need to get my damage up

713
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Oh

714
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,080

715
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I am indeed

716
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,320
I am doing just fine

717
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,160
That magnet did pale

718
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,520
Okay

719
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,080
Oh

720
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,600
The dodge is pretty good

721
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,400
I need to loop around everybody

722
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,240
Ah

723
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,120
Die

724
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
Ouch

725
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,520
Oh

726
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah, the nurses horn is extremely helpful for like just even surviving the game in general

727
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,240
Bob and weave

728
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,760
Yeah, that's true. Oh, not the tree

729
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,440
Okay, there's more stuff. Oh, what is okay, hold on seeing some green

730
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,000
And we'll go back up for the other stuff. Oh my god, I keep getting stuck on things

731
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,440
What is this

732
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,760
I

733
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:04,080
Decrease damage of the main weapon but increased damage of all the other weapons. I don't want that

734
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,200
They don't really have a lot of weapons. I only have the

735
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,200
Uh

736
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,480
I can upgrade my stance with that stamp while I've already walked away

737
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
Okay

738
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,240
What are the shrimp wearing

739
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Haha

740
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,960
Taxis it's looks like a ball of yarn

741
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,320
Oh

742
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,480
What the hell is going on

743
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,480
I

744
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,040
Sorry, I am

745
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:53,440
Oh, I didn't know the boss was still alive. Boomi. I can't see past your bomb

746
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,480
I

747
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Gough the achievement

748
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,080
Uh

749
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,800
Can't upgrade the headphones anymore and get the max hp

750
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,920
Let's do that because I haven't upgraded that yet

751
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,720
So

752
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,320
What is so what does this do exactly

753
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,200
That just doesn't sound good

754
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,520
I wish I could get rid of it so I don't have to see it on my screen distracting me

755
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,320
Destroy the yaku statue

756
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,960
Yeah

757
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,280
Oh my god, I'm stuck on the tree

758
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:24,800
Can you sell or use it I can choose to sell it. How do I sell it?

759
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,280
Oh the boss is still alive

760
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,720
So

761
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,480
How do I sell it

762
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,760
Oh, I just click on it

763
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,440
I figured it out

764
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,680
I wish I could get the credit card, but it's just like not spawning that anymore

765
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,040
Arrow gone

766
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
But I wanted to sell it

767
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:37,440
That's what I wanted to do. I wanted to sell the stamp

768
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,960
I wonder why they chose stamps

769
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,480
I

770
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Saplings getting caught in this looks really funny

771
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,440
Nope

772
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
I guess I'm just chilling running around

773
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:37,200
Oh, there's stuff dropping up there. I'm like, what's what do I do now? I'm waiting for stuff to drop and it's all right here

774
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,120
Hand stamps from cons maybe must be like sticks again, they're just cute

775
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:08,640
Damn this plug is doing work. Oh, I'm gonna die. I didn't even freaking notice

776
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,320
Damn it, I'm kind of pissed

777
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,080
Because I could have definitely beaten it

778
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:25,840
I didn't realize how many people were on me. I didn't look. Why was my health so when did my health gets that low?

779
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,920

Well, I don't really I don't what do the recruits do? What do the workers do?

918
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,560

01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,880
All right. Oh my god, boomie. What are you doing? What do you do? Are you chasing arena?

927
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,400
Oh my god, he's galloping around the house

928
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,120
He was chasing arena. Hi, are you okay?

929
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,240
I already looked behind the house guys

930
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:08,640
When they get tired you feed them when you feed and then you feed them you level up or anymore

931
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,760
Like a lot of money once they're upgraded

932
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:19,760
Did you hear him did you hear

933
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,800
Did you hear

934
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,920
The sound of like a toilet people he is a little elephant

935
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,520
He just runs around the house doing elephant noises

936
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:52,000
I call my little trumpet or my little dove because he used to coup me. He was younger. I sounded more of a dove coup

937
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,360
I mean

938
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,720
He is growling at boomy

939
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,040
Oh

940
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,560
I'm so angry she sounds because boomy came close

941
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,720
Oh, it's okay. Rina. He's not gonna bother you

942
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,880
He's not gonna bother you

943
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,200
Yeah, hold on. You know that's something on your head. I got it. You know like piece of dry skin

944
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,200
I thought that was a stomach growl

945
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,240
Yeah, I know that was that was rena being irritated

946
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:51,360
That's funny and then she looks at me and she looks so innocent but then when she looks at boomy she looks demonic

947
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,800
She's like in her face expression changes

948
01:50:55,440 --> 01:51:01,840
Hi, do you see him? Why are you wagging your tail so hard? Oh, it's because he's on the counter. You can see him from here

949
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,440
Boomy you're laying in the water dish

950
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,480
Boomy your pouch is in the water dish

951
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,400
You're kneeling over the water dish and your pouch is in it

952
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,440
Sir, you're getting your pouch wet

953
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,560
Sir, I

954
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,920
I don't know what to do for you your pouch is

955
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,560
All right, well

956
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,960
He's trying to pouch juice

957
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,960
He's he's doing like the soy sauce thing with his pouch

958
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,320
Boomy

959
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:44,400
Please don't run off and knock the water over because you've done that before

960
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,320
Rina's completely plopped in front of my keyboard

961
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:55,600
Boomy swimming boomy doesn't like water

962
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,760
He thinks he's sushi

963
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:06,160
Fiya, how are you doing? Fiya's knocked out. She's on the couch sleeping. He thinks he's sushi

964
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,800
Rina don't chew on my headphones

965
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,880
Pouch the primordial pouch the cat pouch

966
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,000
A little little extra belly fat that they have for whatever reason

967
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,720
usually for

968
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:32,000
If they ran out of food, they had this primordial pouch to keep their fat storage in

969
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,760
They can burn that instead

970
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:40,240
Although boomy burns a lot of energy. So I don't know. Oh, he's drinking the water that he was sitting in

971
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,240
I guess he wanted some pouch flavored tea

972
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,080
The forbidden pouch

973
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,840
indeed

974
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:53,600
All right, I'm gonna end it here. This was really fun. The hollow hollow cure

975
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:58,000
Is it the punch, punch, pouch, punch, punch, pouch, punch

976
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:06,080
And it was very it was more enjoyable than I thought it was there's so much more in the game than I thought there was

977
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:09,200
So it's really cool

978
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:10,960
I like it a lot

979
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,400
I'm kind of mad I didn't win with Gura because I know I could have if I was paying attention

980
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,800
Are you playing again at some point? Yeah

981
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,360
Of course

982
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:26,160
Um, I might take a nap and then come back and play more Elden Ring. I'm not sure yet. Maybe maybe not

983
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,800
I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't actually know. I probably shouldn't

984
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,760
Um, I should probably I still haven't written the scripts for October. So I should probably do that

985
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:37,200
Um, so I'll probably work on that and then they have to

986
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,040
Yeah

987
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,040
Indeed

988
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,400
The wrinkles

989
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:51,840
Yeah, I still haven't written the scripts for October yet. So I might have to do that

990
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:59,600
Or you do it out we could have some Elden Ring script writing or we could use script writing stream

991
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,640
I should have put a script writing stream on the thing

992
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,800
Maybe

993
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,320
Yeah, I'll script write

994
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:13,600
I don't

995
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,160
I'm on that first because I'm still tired and I only slept for like

996
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,400
a millisecond because I really I forget that I can't fall asleep in like a

997
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,280
um five minutes

998
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:29,040
I didn't really sleep. I was kind of just there laying on my couch

999
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:37,200
Sometime next week. Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe next week. I'll uh do uh, I'll add that to the schedule

1000
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:41,680

1001
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:46,240
