00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
I fell asleep from ICStream, I did. I fell asleep to her ASMR.

13
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I woke up momentarily because her redirect was strawny.

14
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,120
So I heard strawny's voice for a couple seconds and I took off my headphones because she was like...

15
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
I need to wake up.

16
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
I need to wake up.

17
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
I need to wake up.

18
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,120
My cats also are eating in the background.

19
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

20
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Thank you.

21
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
You have with you to wake up.

22
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

23
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

24
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.

25
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Here is my donation of virginity.

26
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Oh, I can hear myself.

27
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Oh no, fuck.

28
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Gross, gross, gross, I hate that.

29
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
It's because I went and after the last stream,

30
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I tried fixing my microphone again.

31
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,120
But I guess it's still not good enough.

32
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Alas, I give up.

33
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
I like...

34
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Am I going to have to like get strawny in here or something?

35
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Are we going to bring double sheebie?

36
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
No, no double sheebie.

37
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Oh, Reina's here.

38
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Hello, Reina.

39
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
What's up?

40
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Oh, let me move my headphones so you can lay in your bed.

41
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
And Fia must be munching.

42
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Oh my gosh, please don't knock over my drink on my own keyboard.

43
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,120
I usually just throw my headphones above my mic arm.

44
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,120
I'm not hearing double sheebie ads because I shut myself up real quick.

45
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Because I was like, why is my desktop audio going crazy?

46
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,120
And I realized my thing was unmuted because I had been listening to myself,

47
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,120
fighting with my lovely AT2020 that I've had for over a decade.

48
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
You're the best microphone ever, baby girl.

49
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,120
But yeah, double sounds twice as good.

50
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I remember my ASMR stream, I was double for like half the stream

51
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,120
and everybody was like, yeah, it was actually sounded okay.

52
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
And I'm like, what the fuck?

53
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Reina, are you waking up?

54
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Reina, I was also almost late because Reina was coughing up her ball.

55
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
My poor old lady.

56
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Now she came out to snuggle with me.

57
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
So I was like watching her.

58
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
And then I'm like, oh fuck, I have to pee.

59
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
And I'm like, lady, are you okay?

60
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,120
And then I'm like, oh, oh.

61
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Imagine having an ass in an AT2020 mic as opposed to a shirt.

62
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Okay.

63
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
They cut, I thought it was fine.

64
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Although what, do you want me to throw a shirt on my, my throne?

65
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Do you want you guys want to drop $400?

66
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Sure, go for it.

67
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
I don't think that'll fix my audio.

68
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,120
It's definitely more of a, what's it called?

69
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Settings thing.

70
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Because my AT2020 is fine.

71
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
I see only pokes fun at you.

72
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
I haven't heard a poke phone at the others yet.

73
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,120
It's because I, you said I have nice reactions.

74
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,120
And they are the only ones that I will allow that tease me, my girls,

75
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
because nobody else can tease me.

76
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Or you will get caught.

77
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I will come to your house and something will go up your butt.

78
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
It's not going to be nice.

79
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,120
It's probably going to go out of your mouth and then you'll pass away.

80
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Haha, no, it's fine though.

81
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,120
I think your levels had steam percent to be fine for the mother should be cool.

82
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Nice promise.

83
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Yes.

84
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Pinky swear promise.

85
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Don't shame others of using other mics on the processing.

86
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I could, you know, I could just be like,

87
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
for the first like month of being in calls with strongy,

88
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
she just had this gamer microphone.

89
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
She sounded like fucking Tyler one.

90
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
And I was funny as hell.

91
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
It was so good.

92
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Yeah, keep you in line.

93
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
I don't know where my crop is.

94
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
It's behind me.

95
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
I feel like reaching for it.

96
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Because I'm raining on my arms.

97
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Oh, hey, fancy meeting you again so soon.

98
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Oh, hello.

99
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Scots is from Tyler one.

100
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm funny.

101
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Yeah, I've had my I've had a lie detector C920 for a webcam

102
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,120
that I use for like the cat cam and hand cams and stuff.

103
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,120
And then I've had my 80 2020 for such a long time.

104
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Those are the only things that have not broken on me.

105
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Everything else broken.

106
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Like my I had like my favorite.

107
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,120
I forget what the mouse is called.

108
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Let me see if I can pick it up with my feet because it's just on the floor.

109
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Still plugged in.

110
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,120
It's a I love this mouse.

111
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
It's a large attack.

112
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I can't see it.

113
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Does it have the number on it?

114
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I don't know.

115
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
It's the one that shroud uses.

116
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I had just the regular one before that and the prices shot up on them

117
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,120
because shroud whatever was using it or someone else.

118
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Yeah, it's audio technica.

119
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Yeah, it's audio technica.

120
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
And I asked him starting talking to Xbox controller microphone.

121
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Feet mouse.

122
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Yeah, I don't know if you guys heard that lovely ASMR if my microphone picked it up.

123
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,120
I was so mad at like all the ones I got of that Logitech mouse

124
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,120
just that one of the keys gets sticky like my right click gets sticky.

125
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,120
And I was I took it apart to clean it and there's nothing wrong with it.

126
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,120
And this is like just gets fucked up.

127
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,120
And I asked the person, oh, is it like ghost clicking or double clicking

128
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
because it would do that too.

129
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,120
And they're like, no, when I bought off eBay and I'm like, fuck you guys.

130
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm an AT 2035.

131
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I love and I do it.

132
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Logitech G502.

133
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
I might I might be.

134
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Yeah.

135
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Sticky.

136
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,120
No, like the not like sticky like something's in it.

137
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
Like sticky like it is sticks.

138
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
I can't I don't know how else to explain it to you.

139
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
That's a switch probably.

140
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Yeah.

141
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Yeah, I know.

142
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Like it's it's notorious for that.

143
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:57,120
And so because I was doing research on it and I'm like, I'm not going to try to even bother with this.

144
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Okay, let me just read out in the Dario's because I don't know if the text speaks works.

145
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Let me see.

146
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Actually, can I?

147
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Nadario tipped $5.

148
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Apologies for underestimating your knowledge in IC's stream earlier, madam.

149
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Please forgive me.

150
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Hey.

151
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Buying deeply.

152
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Guys.

153
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Here is my donation virginity.

154
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
I think it's working.

155
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Thank you for giving me your donation virginity.

156
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
It is an honor.

157
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Switch to the G.

158
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Oh, are you okay?

159
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Just needs anything?

160
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
I just switched to the G.

161
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
305 for seven years.

162
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
What a valuable part.

163
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Yeah.

164
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Let's go text to speech.

165
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Hell yeah.

166
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Okay, cool.

167
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Just don't say anything bad.

168
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
I'll fight you.

169
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Relatively.

170
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Please.

171
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
Like guys, they won't want a decision.

172
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
But yeah, I set that all up.

173
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
So it's cool.

174
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
I remember the first time someone ever donated to me.

175
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
I cried so hard.

176
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
I would ever get how old I was.

177
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
And I think I was like 18.

178
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Streaming on Twitch.

179
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
And I was streaming to like seven people.

180
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Like Counter Strike.

181
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,120
And my setup was worse than it was now.

182
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,120
And they sent me like five bucks and they're like keep it up.

183
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,120
I think literally that like that one person donating

184
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
motivated me because I was just so honored

185
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,120
that someone took their cash that they worked really hard for.

186
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
They had a day job.

187
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Or like hell if it was their parents money.

188
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,120
And they decided to give it to me out of everybody else.

189
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,120
And so I literally cried on stream for 10 minutes.

190
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Like for yeah, Rose investment is paying off 100%.

191
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Yeah, shout out to that first person who ever donated to me.

192
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,120
No idea who you are, but thanks.

193
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Don't know and subscribers milestones.

194
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,120
And here we are a niche internet celebrity.

195
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
They don't know I'm a VTuber.

196
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Every time I leave my apartment, that's what I think about.

197
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
They don't know I'm a VTuber.

198
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
I think it's a patine.

199
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Wondering if I can pick up Rena's purrs.

200
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Purr to like.

201
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Good mums.

202
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Miss mums.

203
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Okay.

204
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Yeah, she's she's my lovely girl.

205
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Cat docks.

206
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Rena just like to hang out with me.

207
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
And even if I'm not touching her if she's just there next to me,

208
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
she just she's purrs.

209
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,120
She just loves hanging out with me and I love hanging out with her.

210
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
I've had her since I was very, very young.

211
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
She's very old now.

212
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
But she's still got it.

213
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
She's still kicking.

214
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
She's my.

215
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,120
She like is one of those pets that knows if you're like super stressed out.

216
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
And she'll so anytime I'm super stressed out,

217
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
she'll just come and she'll purr on me.

218
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Or her sister,

219
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
she had a sister named Solay,

220
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Rena and Solay and they were very sweet.

221
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,120
And her sister would come if I was having a really bad day.

222
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
She would lick my tears off my face.

223
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,120
Solay and then Rena would just purr on me.

224
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
And it was very cute.

225
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
My cat there.

226
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I love them to death.

227
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
I love Siamese cats.

228
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
They're so sweet.

229
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
So sweet.

230
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,120
And they're also really dog-like because they like will play fetch with you.

231
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,120
And they're very vocal and I like that because Rena will just yell at me.

232
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
My cat, me and his me house farts and leaves all.

233
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
I've got a 17 year old cat myself.

234
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Old pet suppressors.

235
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Yes, exactly.

236
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
With this one audio,

237
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
I can determine the size and shape of your cat.

238
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,120
And then I can use algorithms to narrow down whereabouts to.

239
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
That'd be impressive.

240
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
I'd be like, okay, you know what?

241
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
You earned it.

242
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I have cat hair in my mouth.

243
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh my God.

244
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Rena.

245
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
But enjoy a tipped $5.

246
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Oh, she be my madam.

247
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,120
How I love to hear you don't really hear the words.

248
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
I just think of your.

249
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
What?

250
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,120
You think of my what?

251
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
I'm happy you guys are enjoying the Texas beach.

252
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Honestly, when TTS kind of like messes up stuff,

253
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
it's like even funnier.

254
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Cause it's like, huh?

255
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Oh my God.

256
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
I still have cat hair in my mouth.

257
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Rena.

258
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
But oh my God.

259
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
There's cat hair over my mic.

260
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Rena sheds a lot.

261
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
For some, for a Siamese cat.

262
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
I don't know why.

263
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
She's a pure bread Siamese.

264
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I don't know why she sheds so much.

265
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Okay.

266
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Let's I want to see if this.

267
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Well, I'm going to give it another try.

268
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Thank you, sweetheart.

269
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Bon enjoy a tipped $5.

270
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Oh, she be my madam.

271
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,120
How I love to hear you don't really hear the words.

272
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I just think of your strap.

273
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
It's funny because it's just a comment.

274
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
It says how I love to hear you.

275
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Yeah.

276
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I don't really hear the words.

277
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
I just think of your shit.

278
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't know why it skips over how I love to hear you.

279
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Yeah.

280
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
And so I'm going to give it another try.

281
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Thank you, sweetheart.

282
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
I love to hear you.

283
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Yeah.

284
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
It's so funny to me.

285
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Quick.

286
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Someone put this track script.

287
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Yeah.

288
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,120
If you do that, I can just end it.

289
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
It's poetic.

290
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
You know, yeah.

291
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
It's very poetic.

292
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Cat hair gets everywhere.

293
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Very true.

294
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Shedding is healthy though, right?

295
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Well, she's older.

296
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,120
So I feel like she's can't groom herself that well.

297
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
So I usually brush her once a day.

298
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,120
But she's a, she's a sheddy motherfucker.

299
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I don't mean no.

300
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,120
She likes, she likes to be held in my arms like a little baby.

301
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,120
And she looks up at me as I give her forehead kisses.

302
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Even though she's, she's 14 years old.

303
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
She's still, she's still kitten in my eyes.

304
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
She also still acts like a kitten.

305
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Because she'll chase Boomi around if he's pissed her off enough.

306
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,120
And it's the funniest thing to see.

307
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,120
And then she'll like launch herself that a cat tree and jump there and then start yelling.

308
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
And I'm like, ma'am, you're going to bust a hip.

309
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Yeah, so the best for me.

310
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Yeah, I could talk with my cats for hours.

311
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I mean, they put on my headphones.

312
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
I'm just going to hear some scope.

313
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Sorry, is yawning?

314
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Cleverly disguised Samoyed Dog.

315
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Oh my gosh.

316
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
One of my teachers had a Samoyed Dog and she brought,

317
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
in his name was Sammy.

318
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,120
You know, they always call him Sammy, like Samoyed Sammy's.

319
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
So I don't know why she named the dog Sammy.

320
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
But he was the fluffiest dog and I loved him.

321
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
He was so fluffy.

322
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,120
He was also giant because I was like seven when she brought him into class one time.

323
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
I don't even know how she was allowed to do that.

324
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,120
I think she was on vacation and she had a sub and she just came in anyways to show her dog.

325
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
I don't even know.

326
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Yeah, they do shed a lot.

327
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Have you seen the acolyte? Is that out?

328
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,120
I was pretty psyched by the trailer.

329
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I didn't even watch...

330
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I was at Dagobah.

331
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
No, I didn't watch.

332
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Oh my God, I haven't kept up.

333
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
I haven't even watched the third season of the Mandalorian.

334
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Yeah, I never watched Andor because I watched like the first two episodes and I was like, I'm bored.

335
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Obi-Wan Kenobi was fucking bomb.

336
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:46,120
I got those like lights, like those LED lights that match what's on the screen of your TV.

337
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:55,120
And watching the fight between him and Vader with that just like with all the lights turned off was literally incredible.

338
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I didn't watch Ahsoka either.

339
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Although I should because I like that actress.

340
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I should watch the Bad Batch as well.

341
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,120
I should have kept her in my throat.

342
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Also congrats on the order of magnitude Twitter growth.

343
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Thank you. Thank you.

344
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
It's probably mostly just sex bots.

345
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
So I'm not too concerned.

346
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Some ways are so hyper in my experience.

347
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Whenever I say hi to my dog or they want to do his play.

348
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Oh, that's cute.

349
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
I like behind the TV.

350
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Yeah, Boba Fett went downhill.

351
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:45,120
I liked the first part of Boba Fett, but then they brought up the fucking street gang Power Rangers that were like Victorian British people, cyberpunk, steampunk dudes.

352
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
And I'm like, I'm done.

353
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
I'm good.

354
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Who are these guys?

355
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:57,120
I like the first half when he was with the the I'm blanking on everything man because I haven't watched the show since it came out.

356
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And again, I just woke up.

357
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
So I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.

358
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Boba Fett.

359
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Boba Fett.

360
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
You know, the sand peoples.

361
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Right.

362
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I remember.

363
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Yeah, and then it becomes.

364
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Yeah, then Mando shows up and I'm like, it's just a cleverly disguised like filler season of Mandalorian.

365
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Although I fucking love Pablo Pascal, Pedro Pascal.

366
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,120
I never watched anything in your Star Wars or the Mandalorian was one of the good stories.

367
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Yeah, I highly recommend watching Mandalorian.

368
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Boba Fett got his loon Skywalker, but the newer Star Wars movies, I like like the first one was really good.

369
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:58,120
But the last one and the one before it like I was, I was, I know me and my dad were disappointed.

370
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,120
My mom was like also like what the hell is this?

371
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
But like it.

372
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Yeah, I'm just too disappointed with the end of the second season to continue.

373
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Yeah, second season was a bummer.

374
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Wait, yeah, I just wrote all Rogue One is one of my favorite movies, Star Wars movies.

375
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Like I think it's like I have a soft spot in my heart for the prequels just because of how camp they are.

376
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,120
But like for like newer movies, the Rogue One, I've seen so many times in the prequel.

377
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,120
I'm not watching any Star Wars in the original movies and prequel movies.

378
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Yeah, like the first one, like what I wish they did is I wish they focused on Finn more because I feel like he should have been the main character instead of what's her fucking face.

379
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
They gave him like it seemed like he had super pivotal role.

380
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
They just joined it away from him.

381
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,120
And I know like that actor was also really pissed off about that because just how the movies were flowing.

382
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,120
It seemed like he was going to be whatever.

383
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,120
And like how he like used the force and like lightsaber then he just fucking doesn't do it anymore.

384
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm like, all right.

385
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Actor something bodega whatever his name is.

386
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
It's pretty pretty good actor too.

387
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:24,120
And I like I like Daisy Ridley, but yeah, and I also just hate like the random love shit thrown in like spoiler alert.

388
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Well, I'm not going to say it in case you want to just like watch it after this.

389
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:38,120
But at the in the last movie with the like love stuff or like the random like it just ended so poorly like the last movie and I'm like this is fucking stupid.

390
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
This is so dumb.

391
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I was so mad.

392
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
And I'm like, who's this random chick?

393
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Like who's that person?

394
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,120
These are this is a whole side plot that I did not give a shit about.

395
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
The tiger got me.

396
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
I peed it because I was were abling the phone.

397
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
You're trying to help me out, right?

398
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
And I should have spread it.

399
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Yeah, exactly.

400
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,120
I wish it kind of would have been like because like it's such a cool story what Finn had.

401
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Being a former trooper and then deciding to like like branch off from that and like go his own way and then meeting up with like I thought that was so cool.

402
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
John Boyega.

403
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Yeah, I'm not Bodega.

404
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
But like I was I was so.

405
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,120
I was like, oh my God, like I want a cosplay as female Finn and now I'm like, no.

406
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
No thanks.

407
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
You play the follow series.

408
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
I actually did not.

409
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
I never play follow.

410
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I know I liked the TV show, although I know people were like crying because they people thought they retcon something.

411
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,120
I did a lot of research on it because I'm a type of person just reads like every everything up on this series.

412
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,120
If it's if I watch the show and don't do the original and I haven't consumed the original media of it.

413
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Yeah, exactly.

414
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
It was such a bait switch.

415
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,120
But however, I look when he fights that like shock trooper is probably one of my favorite scenes.

416
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,120
The follow series was pretty good.

417
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
I liked it.

418
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:25,120
I hated Maximus's character with a passion because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for me.

419
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for a knight in a squire to like deal with stuff or if he ended up doing what he did, just not being such a little bitch.

420
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Like, oh, his character was so annoying to me.

421
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Like the main girl, I really like the main girl because I watched this show recently before Fallout came out called Yellow Jackets.

422
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Seriously, highly fucking fucking recommend you watch Yellow Jackets.

423
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:08,120
It is one of the best survival horror TV shows I've ever watched and so fucking good.

424
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,120
I binged it in the first two seasons.

425
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Oh, no, don't worry.

426
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
I'm not going to spoil it.

427
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,120
But but she is one of the main characters in Yellow Jackets.

428
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
And so I was already kind of biased.

429
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
But then watching her in this, I just really, really fucking like the show.

430
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:31,120
That the female volleyball team, it was actually a soccer team and they get lost in the wilderness and they have to do fucked up shit to survive.

431
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:45,120
It was literally like, it reminded me a lot of the ritual and it reminded me a lot of what's it called, the game, Sons of the Forest.

432
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Yeah.

433
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
So that was it was a really good show.

434
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:57,120
And then I ended up watching Euphoria after that, not the one that you're thinking of the one about the angsty teenagers that do a lot of drugs.

435
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Because my friend was like, oh, you remind me of this character and I watched it.

436
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm like, why the fuck do I remind you of this character?

437
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
I am nothing like this character.

438
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,120
It's only because we look alike because I look like Zendaya.

439
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
I don't I don't look like Zendaya.

440
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
No, I'm taking that back.

441
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,120
That woman is gorgeous beyond my beyond my dreams that I could ever be.

442
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,120
But in terms of like the hair, the fit, sometimes the attitude, not the drugs.

443
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
The only drugs I've only taken is my antidepressants.

444
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Before.

445
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Okie-tokie.

446
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Lucy and the ghoul felt like nails on the truck.

447
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,120
But yeah, yeah, I also yeah, the ghoul story is really cool.

448
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Yeah, everybody everybody else.

449
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
I was just like, I don't care about you.

450
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Yours and Dan.

451
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
No, I'm not Zendaya.

452
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I'll go out together.

453
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
You'll have to ask my boyfriend, Spiderman.

454
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,120
But it was just it was just funny, but I really like that show.

455
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,120
It's a shame that one of the one of the producers died and then one of the actors actually died.

456
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,120
So from that show, so that's why it's been put off.

457
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,120
But it was it was really like it was kind of depressing because I've known people that have grown up in similar situations.

458
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
How is Timothy Shamalama Dingdong?

459
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
I feel like he would be very whiny.

460
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
It's the day of my favorite actress is VTuber.

461
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
It's really cool.

462
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,120
One of my friends was actually in a movie with her because she's an actress and she said she's super sweet.

463
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,120
If I ever got okay VTuber ghoul meets Zendaya.

464
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
I'm putting it up there.

465
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Never seen Zendaya.

466
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
She'd be in the same room.

467
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
What about the other Zendaya again?

468
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
She gets it too.

469
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
I'm not throwing shade at the series.

470
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Just pointed out in terms of the lower retcons.

471
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
But there wasn't even lower retcons.

472
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
There wasn't even lower retcons though.

473
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Like I will argue with that that for you because everybody's worried about shady sands.

474
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,120
But just because they didn't specify the time that this thing went off that people are getting frustrated with it.

475
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Because I don't feel like they retcons fall out.

476
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
What was it? 74?

477
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
I can't remember.

478
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I just want to say a quick hello before going to work.

479
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Enjoy work.

480
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,120
I just remember that Tom Holland and Zendaya got engaged.

481
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Honestly, would 100% ship it because they're wholesome.

482
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
76, New Vegas.

483
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I don't fucking know.

484
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
We're all New Vegas.

485
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Again, I haven't played them.

486
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I literally own all of them because I buy stuff when it's on sale.

487
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
I haven't played some.

488
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
I was debating whether or not to play fall out New Vegas.

489
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Because I bought it and everything.

490
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
When I was going to like the first thing that I play when I debut.

491
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
But I think Shibi, Shibi.

492
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Strony is streaming it.

493
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Me and Strony like the same exact fucking games.

494
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Because I was like, I was going to do Assassin's Creed.

495
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I was going to do Skyrim.

496
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,120
I was going to do fall out.

497
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
You would watch her for like actual skill and endurance streams.

498
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,120
And then you'd watch me for my absolute shit show that it would be.

499
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Maybe I'll get to those eventually, but I'll probably do them like months down the line.

500
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
You went off after New Vegas.

501
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Yeah, exactly.

502
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
Like he said, it's like in people.

503
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
People think that it went off before.

504
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
So.

505
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Sharon Brainsall.

506
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
Strony 2.0.

507
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Hey, she calls me her 2.0.

508
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I'm her twin.

509
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm just the round American version.

510
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,120
It's always fun watching the first time I play New Vegas.

511
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
I've heard, I've heard.

512
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I remember reading places.

513
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,120
They're like, oh, this person is playing New Vegas because the show like a bunch of people will play New Vegas.

514
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
And they're like.

515
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,120
I only watch like the first two hours because most of the time they only play the first two hours.

516
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,120
But it's still a fun unique experience because everyone experiences is differently.

517
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
What you drinking?

518
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I'm drinking some iced lemon and a tea.

519
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,120
I, uh, was it called Vokeby is like a Korean brand.

520
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,120
They have this really delicious ginger lemon tea that I adore.

521
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Skyrim together and co-op.

522
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Oh, is that a thing?

523
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
That'd be sick.

524
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
I know people are like, oh, you can play Elden Ring.

525
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
And I'm like, maybe.

526
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
You guys see me play.

527
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Crab souls.

528
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
I don't know if you want to watch me play Elden Ring.

529
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,120
And someone's like, oh, you can call up with Strony.

530
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
I'm like, oh, shit, true.

531
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:08,120
But then I would have to buy the game again because I played, I played and finished the game on my PlayStation, but I didn't finish it or have it in general on my.

532
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Oh, my nose on my PC.

533
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Hold on.

534
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,120
My manager fixed my overlay, so I should be able to use it properly now.

535
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
And then we'll get started.

536
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Let me do that.

537
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,120
My own background music is stuck in my head a good chunk of the time.

538
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
You're not going to see anything for a second.

539
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,120
It's going to fix this real quick, like.

540
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Oh, shit.

541
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Oh, shit.

542
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Oh, I found my.

543
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Skyrim co-op kind of jank though.

544
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Yeah, but that's what makes it fun.

545
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Hey, look at you guys down there near my boobs.

546
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Um.

547
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Hey, what a guan.

548
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
What a guan, what a guan.

549
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Hold on.

550
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
You ride at dawn.

551
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Well, shit, there's, you guys are too tall.

552
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,120
See now it's just on a circle that just is there.

553
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Is there.

554
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
It was fun while it lasted.

555
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
What do you mean?

556
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
The app?

557
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,120
I'm still going to yap a bunch during Stanley Parable.

558
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
It's like a perfect yapping game.

559
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Music stuck in your head.

560
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Oh.

561
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
I can't die.

562
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Okay, there we go.

563
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

564
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Yeah, there's a child screaming running down the hallway.

565
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
I'll hear them in a moment.

566
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,120
I think it's finally filtering them out.

567
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Oh, I can't.

568
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
Oh, I know why.

569
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,120
I was like, why can't I edit the properties of this

570
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
and change the transformation?

571
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Because anytime I lock something, you can't do that.

572
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
We're up all night to get lucky.

573
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,120
If we are too tall, you could step on us.

574
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Yeah, put your lucky down for size.

575
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
What just happened?

576
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
You guys just flew away.

577
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
What's up?

578
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Why is it working?

579
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Oh.

580
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,120
I've got to lock a whole thing.

581
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
All right, there you go.

582
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Are you happy now?

583
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Is that good?

584
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
We did it.

585
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Yeah, I didn't see him out.

586
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
We did it.

587
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,120
She finally fixed her overlay and whatever.

588
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
She did it.

589
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
She did it.

590
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
She did it.

591
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
She did it.

592
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
Okay, fuck my BGM for a second.

593
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,120
Hey, what's up?

594
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Oh my God, what the fuck just happened?

595
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

596
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Stanley Parable is fucking with my overlord.

597
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Is fucking with my pages.

598
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Oh my God.

599
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
That is wild.

600
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Okay, let's try again.

601
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Oh my God, I need to take it off a full screen.

602
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
My head in the way.

603
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Actually, I kind of might stick it over there like that

604
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
and then move myself.

605
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Phoebe, you should have done this before a stream.

606
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
I don't care.

607
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
It's funnier when things are scoppy.

608
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,120
Yeah, because it's cutting off the bottom of the screen.

609
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
I might have to do a window.

610
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah.

611
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Yeah.

612
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Yeah.

613
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Yeah.

614
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Give it to me now.

615
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
Give it to me now.

616
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
My dad is asking me why he hasn't heard from me.

617
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
What's up, redacted?

618
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
What are you doing?

619
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
Where are you?

620
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
Where are you?

621
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
What's up, redacted?

622
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
What are you doing?

623
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Where are you?

624
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Sometimes my parents will just text me

625
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
and they'll be like, are you alive?

626
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
I'm like, yes, I'm alive.

627
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
They're like, okay, why haven't you called?

628
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm like, because I don't know.

629
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,120
I was like, what is this?

630
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
What is this?

631
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Yeah, I don't know why it's the demo.

632
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Yes, because it's only 30 minutes.

633
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm not paying for a full game that I know

634
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,120
I'm not going to finish, guys.

635
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Sorry to break it to you.

636
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,120
I'm playing the 30 minute free demo

637
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,120
because I can stretch that shit to five hours

638
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
if I really want.

639
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Demo.

640
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
I'm alive.

641
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
It's the same.

642
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
Wait for it to notice.

643
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
What do you mean?

644
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Oh, wait, I forgot.

645
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
The chats delayed.

646
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
I should put the newest stuff first, actually.

647
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
No, the demo is actually just like

648
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
literally just the first 30 minutes of it.

649
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Oh, my, the game is $24.

650
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,120
I'm, I am a broke bunny.

651
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,120
So I am selling my voice to a weird cuttlefish

652
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
I met on the street.

653
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Yeah, but, you know, we just started up.

654
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Don't ignore me.

655
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,120
Just like sweating and being mad.

656
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,120
Aren't you happy I streamed twice today?

657
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,120
You get double the scope.

658
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Listen, I've only been here for a week.

659
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
You got to cut me some slack.

660
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Adam's already upset.

661
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
No, I'm not upset.

662
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
I'm just tired.

663
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
I'm just tired.

664
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
I just woke up.

665
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
It's like my first week here.

666
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
I'm just tired.

667
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
I'm just tired.

668
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
I'm just tired.

669
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
I'm just tired.

670
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
I'm just tired.

671
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
I just woke up.

672
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
I think I've done it.

673
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
I think I've done it.

674
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
I think I've done it.

675
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120
I think I've done it.

676
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
I think I've done it.

677
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
I think I've done it.

678
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
I think that's good.

679
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Wait, what?

680
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Where did the, huh?

681
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
Your names aren't coming up from a little ticker.

682
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,120
But, oh.

683
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
Why does stuff break?

684
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Why does it break?

685
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Why do it break?

686
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Why do it break?

687
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Why do it break?

688
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Oh, I know why.

689
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,120
Oh, I know why.

690
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,120
No, I don't know why.

691
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Why is it?

692
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Is it showing y'all?

693
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,120
It's just not.

694
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
Please.

695
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Please.

696
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Please, it's all right.

697
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Please, it's all right.

698
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,120
It's all right.

699
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Please, it's all right.

700
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Please, it's all right.

701
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,120
Please, it's all right.

702
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,120
Please, it's all right.

703
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,120
Please, it's all right.

704
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,120
Please, it's all right.

705
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,120
No, I didn't want that in there,

706
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,120
or whatever.

707
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
I'm just going to cry quietly

708
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
as I do,

709
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
as one does, you know.

710
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Oh, crap.

711
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
No, wait.

712
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
No, wait

713
00:42:44,120 --> 00:43:03,280

this is 720 x 480

wait i'm guessing i should... i don't fucking know

737
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,400
It doesn't even matter.

738
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm just gonna run in a window anyways.

739
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Okay!

740
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Hey-yo!

741
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
Where'd my OBS go?

742
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
Oh, there she is.

743
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Oh my god, this still is not the way I want, so I'm just gonna tuck it like that.

744
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,400
How good is this gonna get, ladies and gentlemen?

745
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
I also don't know what the master class is.

746
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Age is 16? 9?

747
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,400
An alt becomes a main? No! My alt's not gonna be my main.

748
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
I don't know.

749
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,400
I was thinking about it, because I'm like, should I make my alt that my main?

750
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,400
And then I'm like, no, because I get a lot.

751
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,400
It's easier for me to talk to you guys on my actual main than my parent.

752
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
I don't know.

753
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
I don't know.

754
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
I don't know.

755
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
I don't know.

756
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
I don't know.

757
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
I don't know.

758
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
I don't know.

759
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
My actual main and my parent.

760
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
In my opinion.

761
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Oh!

762
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
What the f-

763
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
I was like waiting for it to change.

764
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
That's quite loud.

765
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,400
It's quite loud. Hold on a moment.

What?

768
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
Is this the demo?

769
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
What?

770
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Did I go in a circle?

771
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
My number is 27.

772
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Oh.

773
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
Hi.

774
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,400
Okay.

775
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Waiting room.

776
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
Why does that coffee look like blood?

777
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
Can I pick stuff up?

778
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,400
What does it say? Stanley Parable demo.

779
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Should I?

780
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Alright, looks like I got to wait.

781
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,400
Sorry guys. I can't sit down, so I'll just...

782
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Okay, I'll sit down over here.

783
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
Almost my turn.

784
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Wait, I can't see the chat. What happened to the chat?

785
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Yeah.

786
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Yes, my stuff is clicky.

787
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
I made it.

788
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Gorgeous.

789
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
Famous demos.

790
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
We got...

791
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,400
We got Snake there. We got...

792
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
I thought it was Game & Watch for a second.

793
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
What is that?

794
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
I don't know what these games are.

795
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,400
We were playing the demo. Yes, I'm not spending money on the real game when I'm not going to finish it.

796
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Oh, man.

797
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
Wash over you.

798
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,400
I wonder if I get a cool ending if I literally just walked away from my computer and didn't touch anything.

799
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Because I know that shit happens in this game.

800
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,400
That explains clearly and concisely exactly what the Stanley Parable is.

801
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
How it plays...

802
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
I feel like I'm in office in Counter Strike.

803
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
It's probably the same assets.

804
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Oh my god, it is the same assets. I'm nostalgic.

805
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
I only just realized that now that they use the same assets.

806
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,400
Let's go with the demo counter.

807
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
Here is one such technology.

808
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,400
These buttons are meant to convey the meaning of choice and the impact of the decisions you make.

809
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,400
Can I press a button?

810
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,400
Please. Please let me press the button.

811
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Please.

812
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,400
What is this? Oh, I want to do this one.

813
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,400
All people who select that particular button are sexual predators.

814
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,400
You see, our choices really do illuminate the very intangible nature of our minds and souls.

815
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
What the hell is this?

816
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,400
I'm the 6% that's not a sexual predator.

817
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
I'm just a sexual deviant.

818
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,400
The buffalo.

819
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Well, technology, oh my god.

820
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,400
No way.

821
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Oh, what the fuck?

822
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,400
Oh, I wanted to walk through the wall like a badass.

823
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,400
I'm actually like pretty out of work. How do I get up there?

824
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
I can't get up there, can I? I can't parkour.

825
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Down here.

826
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Just a isolation chamber. They put me in one of those.

827
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
Put me in a room, a rubber room.

828
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,400
Rubber room filler ads.

829
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,400
I'm like too low to the ground. I can't reach my keyboard properly.

830
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Raise my chair.

831
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
Okay, there we go.

832
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Discovery or despair? Let's go with despair.

833
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,400
These crags that we stood upon, they shielded us from our own ignorance.

834
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
I'm not short.

835
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
We're probably taller than the majority of you.

836
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
Can I see the other ones?

837
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Is there like...

838
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
Okay, fine.

839
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Ooh, you went in both boos? Oh, how vulnerable of you.

840
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,400
If at any point during the demo you need to cry, just let me know and we can take a minute.

841
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,400
Demo status, demo compliments.

842
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,400
One of the most important parts of administering any demonstration is pumping out your ego.

843
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,400
Yeah!

844
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
...in securities about your sense of self-worth.

845
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
I'm ready!

846
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,400
That's why we use this room to develop cheap compliments to share on the production of the demo.

847
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Go ahead and press that button to see some of the superficial flattery we've been cooking up.

848
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
I'm excited, okay.

849
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,400
My heavens, I've never met someone who can consume as much uranium in a single sitting as you can.

850
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Just look at you go.

851
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Can I get another compliment?

852
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,400
Of all the people I know who are playing this exact demo at this exact moment

853
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,400
and standing in this exact room, your performance is easily in the top 5,000.

854
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Oh my god.

855
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
Oh!

856
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
I won't go as far as 4,600.

857
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
Oh.

858
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
Yeah.

859
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,400
This device tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.

860
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,400
I think I am.

861
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:51,400
There's also a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.

862
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
This game is so meta.

863
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
Ooh!

864
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,400
Wait, what?

865
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,400
Wait.

866
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,400
I get turned around a lot.

867
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Ah, now this room is perhaps the most important Joel encounter in the demo.

868
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,400
This is where we determine whether or not the demo has been effective.

869
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,400
No!

870
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,400
What are you doing?

871
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,400
You can't make that decision.

872
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,400
Yeah, you haven't played the demo.

873
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
We've put so much work into it.

874
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Is this not the demo?

875
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
I was so ready to press no.

876
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Do you want me to turn up the game?

877
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
Is it too quiet?

878
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,400
And there you have it.

879
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,400
Everything you need to know about how video game demos are made.

880
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,400
Let them cook.

881
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,400
It's a little quiet.

882
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Okay.

883
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
I thought it was too loud.

884
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Meow.

885
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
You don't want to simmer or want to broil?

886
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Mmm.

887
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,400
Makes you want to broil you like a little crab and eat you up.

888
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,400
You suck on your little leggies for your sweet, sweet flesh.

889
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,400
However, it's still important that we address safety concerns.

890
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
I'm going to jump us up.

891
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,400
Emotion sickness.

892
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Another reason I didn't get this is I think I was going to get really motion sick.

893
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,400
I see you right there.

894
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,400
Please do not press the large red glowing disagree button at this time.

895
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,400
Nothing.

896
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,400
No objections.

897
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,400
You're quite sure about that.

898
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
There's no disagree button.

899
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
Well, all right then.

900
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,400
In the event that you do experience one or all of the previously listed symptoms.

901
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
I'm going to bleed for my anus from playing this game.

902
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,400
You need to convey to me that you wish the demonstration.

903
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,400
Oh, a reflex.

904
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,400
I probably case a calamari.

905
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Ooh, I love calamari.

906
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
Don't tell Strani.

907
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,400
What the?

908
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Dance perimeter.

909
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Please perform a dance.

910
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
Oh, fuck.

911
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Your dance has been recorded in the event that you feel confused or disoriented by anything you see inside the demo.

912
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Perform that dance and I will terminate the demo immediately.

913
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,400
Okay.

914
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
Right.

915
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
All preparations have been made.

916
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,400
It is time at the fast.

917
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,400
Are you prepared for a dance perimeter?

918
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
Whoa.

919
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
It's kind of terrifying.

920
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,400
What?

921
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
It kill me?

922
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
What's that?

923
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,400
Forget waiting.

924
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Dance perimeter.

925
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
I'm so excited.

926
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Oh my God.

927
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
Oh well.

928
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,400
I'm making myself dizzy.

929
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
Oh wait.

930
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
What's this?

931
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Huh?

932
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
Can I leave?

933
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Okay.

934
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,400
It's a giant eight.

935
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,400
Eight.

936
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,400
Damn girl.

937
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,400
You really.

938
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,400
Eight.

939
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,400
The outfit up.

940
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Hey man.

941
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
Do you eat?

942
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
Do you?

943
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Fuck.

944
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
I really.

945
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Her pussy the other day.

946
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,400
I really.

947
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
His ass.

948
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,400
Running out of the game.

949
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
It's like the equivalent of 42.

950
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Should I check who's guy?

951
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
I like this game.

952
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Why six or three to seven because 79.

953
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Oh, okay.

954
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,400
I can go backwards.

955
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,400
All right.

956
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,400
I would have been very happy.

957
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,400
I didn't pay for the full game.

958
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,400
No, I like.

959
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
I like the Stanley parable.

960
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Stanley parable is a great game.

961
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,400
I've watched people play it.

962
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,400
But again, I don't.

963
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
Because it's a long ish game.

964
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,400
I just didn't think I would be able to get through it.

965
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,400
Okay.

966
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,400
Now let's take a minute to get something straight here.

967
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,400
Can I get a soda?

968
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,400
You are assuming an amount of responsibility for its outcome.

969
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,400
Is there anything?

970
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
We had us eight in Runderland.

971
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,400
Eight.

972
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,400
I wish I could jump.

973
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,400
This time, please take a minute to think about all of the mistakes you've made in playing this demonstration.

974
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,400
As well as your lack of respect for demo taking in general.

975
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Opening the game.

976
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,400
I shouldn't have gotten the game.

977
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,400
I'm kind of happy.

978
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,400
I didn't make the mistake of buying the full game.

979
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,400
But I kind of like walked and I got turned around a bunch.

980
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,400
Okay.

981
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,400
Why am I so small in the corner?

982
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,400
Hold on.

983
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,400
I just realized I looked over.

984
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,400
I noticed how small I was.

985
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,400
Oh.

986
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,400
I went back.

987
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
Well, hello there.

988
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,400
All right.

989
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
What is this black void?

990
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,400
I didn't know your asshole was a feature of the game.

991
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,400
Okay.

992
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
I can't see shit.

993
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Oh.

994
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,400
Wow.

995
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,400
Did she not detach yet?

996
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,400
I'm sure of it.

997
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

998
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,400
We have to get out of here.

999
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
We have to find something for you to do anything.

1000
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,400
The demo cannot.

1001
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
It is a good song by Marilyn Martinez.

1002
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,400
This way.

1003
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,400
Okay.

1004
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,400
I love the narrator's voice though.

1005
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,400
Surely there must be a game somewhere in here.

1006
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,400
Got a giant TV.

1007
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,400
Vine boom noise.

1008
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,400
Pick it up.

1009
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,400
Whoa.

1010
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,400
What the fuck?

1011
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,400
I can't.

1012
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,400
Now put it in the bin.

1013
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,400
What if I just wait?

1014
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
I can't.

1015
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
What the hell?

1016
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,400
Did I just stand on it?

1017
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,400
I'm standing on it.

1018
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,400
What the fuck?

1019
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,400
Can I just fucking break it?

1020
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,400
Break stuff.

1021
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
Disrespect your surroundings.

1022
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,400
Oh, I missed.

1023
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,400
Okay, I got it.

1024
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,400
Disrespect your surroundings.

1025
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
You did it.

1026
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,400
You won.

1027
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,400
You know what you get for winning?

1028
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,400
An achievement.

1029
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,400
Four ton narrator.

1030
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,400
I won?

1031
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Oh my god.

1032
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Can't even see it in there.

1033
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
I can't see that.

1034
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,400
I didn't even see what that said.

1035
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
She threw it on the ground.

1036
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,400
What?

1037
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Let me out.

1038
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,400
Help me, I'm on fire.

1039
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,400
Can I throw myself in the trash?

1040
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,400
Don't be on that now, aren't we?

1041
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,400
Come along, let's get to the end and the final choice.

1042
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,400
I just hope they paid this man so well

1043
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
because he did such a good job narrating this game.

1044
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,400
Ending, ending, where are you?

1045
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,400
Where are you?

1046
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,400
Oh.

1047
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,400
This is where the red disagree button went.

1048
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,400
What?

1049
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,400
Is this a horror game?

1050
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,400
Yes, the end.

1051
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,400
Now this is where we want the demo to be.

1052
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,400
I think it's time for you to log your final decision

1053
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,400
as to whether or not the Stanley Parable is any good.

1054
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,400
Oh, sweet.

1055
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Please consider very carefully before answering.

1056
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,400
Much is at stake.

1057
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,400
Is it?

1058
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,400
Is it working?

1059
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,400
Are you sure?

1060
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,400
Are you sure you pressed the button?

1061
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,400
Oh, jeez, fuck.

1062
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,400
We finished the demo.

1063
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,400
Did it start again?

1064
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Hello?

1065
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,400
Is anyone there?

1066
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
They already finished.

1067
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,400
They said they liked it.

1068
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
I need someone to stop the demo.

1069
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Hello?

1070
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,400
Hello?

1071
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,400
We need to get out of here.

1072
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
Let's blow this popsicle stand.

1073
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,400
I can't run.

1074
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,400
I can crouch.

1075
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,400
What the frick?

1076
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,400
Let me just go.

1077
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,400
No?

1078
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,400
All right.

1079
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,400
Time to go to the fun room.

1080
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,400
What's going on?

1081
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,400
Where is everyone?

1082
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,400
Okay.

1083
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,400
Over to the left.

1084
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,400
Down this way.

1085
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,400
Ow, my ears.

1086
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
Quick in the isolation chamber.

1087
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
Oh, nice and quiet.

1088
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Finally.

1089
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
I suppose we can both agree that I failed.

1090
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,400
My job was to be a teacher.

1091
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,400
You remember the isolation chamber?

1092
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,400
Yeah, I was.

1093
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,400
I saw it.

1094
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
Exactly what the Stanley Parable is supposed to be.

1095
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,400
But somehow I couldn't.

1096
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,400
Well, at any rate, I don't know if I care for the Stanley Parable anymore.

1097
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Scammed.

1098
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,400
Do you think any of this is actually in the main game?

1099
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
Honestly, I don't think so.

1100
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,400
Ever ball out of time, chamber?

1101
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,400
That even looked like.

1102
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,400
No.

1103
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,400
I think I've had enough of it.

1104
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,400
No more doors.

1105
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,400
No more demonstrations.

1106
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,400
No more endings.

1107
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,400
I wonder if this guy has voice acted like anything else,

1108
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,400
or like, because I just feel like he should be an actor in a movie.

1109
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,400
It's so lovely.

1110
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,400
I kind of want to eat the leaves on this plant.

1111
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,400
They're edible, right?

1112
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
Excuse me.

1113
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,400
Can I eat this chair?

1114
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Can I pick anything up?

1115
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,400
Yeah.

1116
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,400
Yeah, I do.

1117
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,400
What the fuck?

1118
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,400
How the hell did I get here?

1119
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,400
God?

1120
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
Jesus, please.

1121
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,400
Holy ghost.

1122
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,400
Make it stop.

1123
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,400
Thank you, the cup.

1124
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,400
What?

1125
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
We never did that until now.

1126
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
What?

1127
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,400
Huh?

1128
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,400
What?

1129
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,400
Ah!

1130
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,400
What?

1131
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,400
This is such a creative thing to do for a demo, though.

1132
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,400
Ah!

1133
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,400
What the fuck?

1134
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,400
He's just teleporting me.

1135
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,400
Let's eat everything.

1136
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,400
I just like to chew on stuff, to be honest with you.

1137
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,400
Where is it?

1138
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,400
Where is it?

1139
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,400
I'm in an elevator, please.

1140
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,400
I'm getting so much motion sickness from the...

1141
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,400
Yeah, that's another reason why I didn't think I could play it.

1142
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,400
I'm also whipping around.

1143
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,400
It's easier, like, it's easier on me right now

1144
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,400
because I'm controlling it and I know what I'm going to do.

1145
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
But for you guys, I'm just like,

1146
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,400
Sorry.

1147
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,400
Release me.

1148
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,400
The madam cannot be caged.

1149
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,400
Oh, this looks like their original game.

1150
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,400
Taking sippies.

1151
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,400
Hell yeah, guys, it's out now.

1152
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,400
Okay, maybe I should have gotten the game.

1153
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,400
Because I thought the demo was like the first 30 minutes of the game.

1154
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,400
But I was wrong.

1155
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,400
I was incorrect.

1156
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Out now? No way.

1157
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,400
It's always the next time.

1158
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,400
It really depends.

1159
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,400
Like, I don't know if you guys want me to play it.

1160
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,400
Oh, for real, damn.

1161
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,400
They should bring Stanley Paramore to our attention.

1162
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,400
Don't buy it.

1163
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Commit to the bit.

1164
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,400
Yeah, you know, I'm not going to, you know,

1165
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,400
purchase a game from a company

1166
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,400
that's, you know, romanticizing,

1167
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,400
working,

1168
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
working for the man, you know?

1169
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,400
You never do the demo.

1170
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,400
How do you need content as a new one?

1171
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,400
Did you, if I did buy the game for the bit?

1172
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,400
Yeah, for the bit.

1173
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,400
Hmm.

1174
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Hmm.

1175
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,400
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1176
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,400
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1177
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Should I get it?

1178
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,400
Do you know for the bit?

1179
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
We've been troll requests for a second.

1180
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
Yeah.

1181
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,400
What's the difference between the ultra deluxe

1182
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
and the,

1183
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,400
and the normal one?

1184
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,400
You could go back to Class of 09.

1185
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,400
Maybe.

1186
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,400
We could, we could.

1187
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Yeah, I get it.

1188
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,400
Has a bucket ending.

1189
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,400
Play games usually.

1190
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,400
Yeah, I know.

1191
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,400
I just,

1192
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,400
I'm sorry.

1193
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,400
I feel like this is not one of my better streams

1194
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
since I'm like half asleep.

1195
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,400
I shouldn't have fallen asleep

1196
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,400
to, um,

1197
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,400
to, to icy stuff.

1198
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,400
Hmm.

1199
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
Oh, don't give me a second.

1200
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,400
I'll do better for you.

1201
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,400
Oh, what the fuck?

1202
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,400
Where did I go?

1203
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,400
What's happening?

1204
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,400
Guys?

1205
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,400
Are you there?

1206
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,400
Are you there?

1207
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
Hello?

1208
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Guys?

1209
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,400
With that, she's gone.

1210
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,400
I'm just a disembodied voice

1211
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,400
with some background music now.

1212
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,400
I just got Thanos snapped.

1213
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
Oh, man.

1214
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Guys.

1215
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,400
I can't.

1216
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,400
I can't.

1217
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,400
Wait, I woke up.

1218
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,400
She's gone.

1219
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,400
We're free.

1220
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,400
Guys, I don't know what happened.

1221
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,400
I guess.

1222
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,400
I guess I was just a figment

1223
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,400
of your imagination the entire time.

1224
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,400
I'm so sorry.

1225
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,400
My whole body flew away.

1226
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,400
I'm in the walls.

1227
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,400
I'm just talking to you

1228
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,400
within the walls.

1229
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,400
I'm in your walls.

1230
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,400
I'm in your walls.

1231
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,400
I'm in your walls.

1232
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,400
Next evolution of VTubing.

1233
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
No one there.

1234
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,400
What happened?

1235
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
That's crazy.

1236
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,400
Hold on.

1237
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,400
I had the ropes and whips.

1238
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,400
This is truly the meaning

1239
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
of the Stanley Parable.

1240
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,400
Bad ending.

1241
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,400
We took the meds.

1242
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,400
So I played Needy Schumer Overdose.

1243
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Overloaded Overdose.

1244
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,400
I forget.

1245
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,400
You have to play Uno.

1246
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,400
I'm wide awake.

1247
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,400
Yeah, I was in the dark.

1248
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,400
Hello?

1249
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,400
Oh, no.

1250
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,400
I broke myself.

1251
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,400
Could you believe me

1252
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,400
if I told you this was all intentional?

1253
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,400
Because it actually is.

1254
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,400
It's all...

1255
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,400
It's all a figment

1256
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
of your imagination.

1257
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,400
Whoa.

1258
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
Wait, but why am I not moving?

1259
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,400
Please.

1260
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,400
What the hell just happened?

1261
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
Why am I moving in slow mo...

1262
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,400
Guys, I'm not even...

1263
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,400
That was so creepy.

1264
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,400
What is happening?

1265
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,400
Guys, I had closed...

1266
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,400
I closed the app

1267
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,400
and it was still moving and talking.

1268
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,400
What's going on?

1269
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Why do I look so creepy?

1270
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,400
My models are slowly moving back and forth.

1271
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,400
Okay, okay.

1272
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,400
What's going on?

1273
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,400
I don't know.

1274
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,400
What happened there?

1275
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,400
Oh, we're broke broke.

1276
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
We always been broke broke.

1277
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,400
I'm stalling.

1278
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,400
I'm just stalling.

1279
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,400
Don't worry about it.

1280
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,400
I'm stalling

1281
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
for time.

1282
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,400
We're reaching levels of scoff.

1283
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
That shouldn't be possible.

1284
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,400
You know what my temptation is right now?

1285
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,400
Is

1286
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,400
is

1287
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,400
is just going to play in RuneScape

1288
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,400
and stream sniping her.

1289
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,400
That sounds fun.

1290
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,400
Text...

1291
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,400
I've never played RuneScape before.

1292
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,400
Excuse me.

1293
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,400
I remember growing up

1294
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,400
in that aforementioned

1295
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,400
after school program.

1296
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,400
We had like a computer room and stuff.

1297
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,400
And um,

1298
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,400
I don't know why my model is like freaking out,

1299
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,400
but I'll just let her do her thing.

1300
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,400
And this kid was playing RuneScape

1301
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,400
on one of the computers.

1302
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,400
And I'm like, oh, that looks really fun and cool.

1303
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,400
Can I play?

1304
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,400
And he's like, nah,

1305
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,400
this is only for boys.

1306
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,400
And I'm like,

1307
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,400
oh, and I like genuinely believed him

1308
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,400
that only boys could play for some reason.

1309
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,400
So I never played RuneScape.

1310
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
Secret cheapy horse stream.

1311
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,400
But I just stare awkwardly at you.

1312
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,400
And my body jerks around.

1313
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,400
Mastered the power of scuff and nightmares.

1314
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,400
If only I had like multiple models

1315
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,400
to run right now.

1316
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,400
Maybe I can like cut off my head.

1317
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,400
That would take too long though.

1318
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,400
As I cut off my head.

1319
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
Damn it.

1320
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,400
Damn it.

1321
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,400
So um,

1322
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,400
how was your day?

1323
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,400
My stall,

1324
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,400
I'm losing,

1325
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,400
I'm losing my stalling ability.

1326
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
Finishing levels.

1327
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,400
Yeah,

1328
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
I just beat the entire game.

1329
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,400
That's crazy.

1330
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
Pass bad at your per...

1331
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Yeah, I know.

1332
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
I'm like...

1333
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,400
For the funny.

1334
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,400
RuneScape is 90% male player base

1335
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,400
even today.

1336
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Most MMOs at 50-50.

1337
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
Oh, interesting.

1338
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,400
Although,

1339
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,400
I would probably just like make,

1340
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,400
see if I can um,

1341
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,400
see if I can like trick

1342
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,400
strongy

1343
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,400
into falling in love with me online.

1344
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,400
You think I can groom my gen mate

1345
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,400
in RuneScape

1346
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,400
without her knowing?

1347
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,400
Streep's not the color fish.

1348
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,400
Got to like kick out.

1349
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,400
Be like,

1350
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,400
hey, I'm Kyle.

1351
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,400
I'm Kyler.

1352
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,400
I'm a huge fan.

1353
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,400
I'm also from

1354
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,400
insert where strongy is from

1355
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,400
here.

1356
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,400
Headless sheebie return?

1357
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,400
Show sports and such huh?

1358
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,400
Talk,

1359
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,400
taking sheebie to the

1360
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,400
willdy?

1361
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
Alright,

1362
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,400
I forgot we had the prehensile

1363
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,400
hair.

1364
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,400
That was a real horror stream.

1365
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,400
Yeah, I'm trying to think of

1366
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,400
something funny to do

1367
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,400
for 6K on Twitter

1368
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,400
with the

1369
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,400
3D thing.

1370
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,400
I'm like trying to get

1371
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,400
manager to make something for me,

1372
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,400
but I have to think of a song

1373
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,400
in a dance.

1374
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,400
Uh huh.

1375
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,400
I've had Karba stuck in my head

1376
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,400
for a long time.

1377
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,400
Don't worry about my models.

1378
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,400
She,

1379
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,400
we're fine.

1380
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,400
She's good.

1381
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
I'm good.

1382
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,400
It's good.

1383
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,400
Don't worry about it.

1384
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,400
Oh no.

1385
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,400
My stream just

1386
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,400
disappeared.

1387
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,400
Oh no.

1388
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,400
Oh god.

1389
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,400
Hahaha.

1390
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,400
Karba's a bitch.

1391
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,400
I should have known better

1392
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,400
if I was a bitch.

1393
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,400
Oh wow.

1394
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,400
Whoa.

1395
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,400
Holy crap.

1396
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,400
Hold on.

1397
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,400
Something's happening.

1398
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,400
I don't know what,

1399
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,400
but something's going on.

1400
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,400
Going on.

1401
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,400
Like Donkey Kong.

1402
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,400
Oh my god.

1403
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,400
Where did I?

1404
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,400
What is happening?

1405
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,400
Whoa.

1406
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,400
Wowee, Zowie.

1407
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,400
My stream for a little bit longer today.

1408
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,400
Just to make up for all the scuff

1409
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,400
and me just talking about nothing.

1410
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,400
I just look,

1411
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,400
why do I look high as fuck?

1412
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,400
Whoa, what is this?

1413
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,400
That's crazy.

1414
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,400
Where did this come from?

1415
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,400
Whoa.

1416
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,400
This is not what I was stalling for

1417
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,400
or anything.

1418
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,400
I'm having absolute fuck all.

1419
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,400
Oh wow.

1420
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,400
What a cool game.

1421
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,400
Nice zoo.

1422
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,400
Yeah.

1423
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,400
I'm starting over

1424
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,400
because I beat the game.

1425
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,400
So you know,

1426
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,400
I'm just going to start over.

1427
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,400
Let me just,

1428
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,400
that's fun.

1429
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,400
Is she beyond the saw?

1430
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,400
No.

1431
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,400
Well, I'm tired,

1432
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,400
so I bet some people will be like,

1433
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,400
I'm pretty sure she was high as fuck.

1434
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,400
No, I'm just tired.

1435
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,400
Especially because it was up at 6 a.m.

1436
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,400
Come as a bitch,

1437
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,400
I should know better.

1438
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
I wonder why she lagged.

1439
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,400
I know, right?

1440
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,400
I don't.

1441
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,400
Really crazy how that's,

1442
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,400
you know,

1443
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,400
V-Soup Studio just has its moments.

1444
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,400
Crazy.

1445
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,400
Wow, that's crazy.

1446
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,400
You'll never know,

1447
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,400
Somnis Vivarum.

1448
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,400
You'll never know.

1449
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,400
Your name sounds like a spell from Elden Ring.

1450
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,400
How weird, huh?

1451
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,400
Of a girl named Sheebie.

1452
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,400
Sheebie worked for a big company.

1453
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,400
This is clearly source.

1454
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1455
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,400
The source is funny anyway.

1456
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,400
The source is funny anyway.

1457
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1458
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1459
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1460
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1461
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1462
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1463
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1464
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1465
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1466
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1467
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1468
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1469
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1470
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1471
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1472
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1473
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1474
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1475
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1476
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1477
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1478
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1479
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,400
I'm playing the normal one.

1480
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,400
Stanley was happy.

1481
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,400
And then one day something peculiar happened.

1482
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,400
This is the arrow.

1483
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,400
This is me right now.

1484
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Something that would forever change Stanley.

1485
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,400
Something he would never quite forget.

1486
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,400
He had been at his desk for nearly an hour

1487
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,400
when he realized that not one

1488
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,400
single order

1489
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,400
had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.

1490
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,400
No one had sure not to do this.

1491
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,400
Yeah, yeah, you have no regrets.

1492
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,400
You know mods destroy him.

1493
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,400

whowall

1512
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,140
My stream died for me.

1513
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,140
And I lost like half of everybody.

1514
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,140
Oh my god.

1515
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,140
He really got teleported to Kiara's stream.

1516
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,140
Oh no.

1517
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,140
Everybody literally is gone.

1518
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,140
Do I give up?

1519
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,140
Do I just...

1520
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,140
Do I just end it here?

1521
01:26:55,140 --> 01:27:00,140
I got the funniest ending just by sitting in the thing as I died.

1522
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,140
I didn't even fucking notice.

1523
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,140
What the fuck?

1524
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,140
Why can't I leave?

1525
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:16,140
No mourners, no funerals.

1526
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:20,140
Come on.

1527
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,140
Please.

1528
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,140
Forever.

1529
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,140
I will be happy.

1530
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,140
Stanley waited.

1531
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,140
Hours passed.

1532
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,140
Then days.

1533
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:33,140
Had years gone by.

1534
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:35,140
He no longer had the ability to tell.

1535
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,140
But the one thing we knew for sure...

1536
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:38,140
Give me the fuck out of here.

1537
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:41,140
Was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.

1538
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,140
Oh my god.

1539
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,140
I'm literally gonna go crazy.

1540
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,140
Soon.

1541
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,140
Very soon now.

1542
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:48,140
This will end.

1543
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,140
He will be spoken to.

1544
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,140
He will be told what to do.

1545
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,140
Please, please, please, please, please.

1546
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,140
I'm just getting claustrophobic.

1547
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,140
The walls are closing in.

1548
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,140
Stream is having serious issues.

1549
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:09,140
What the fuck?

1550
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,140
Okay, okay, okay.

1551
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,140
Okay.

1552
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,140
I think because the stream is just being so fucky for some reason, I might...

1553
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:23,140
I'm also having really bad lagging issues looking back at my own stream.

1554
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:26,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1555
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,140
Oh my god.

1556
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,140
What the fuck?

1557
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:47,140
Jesus.

1558
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:50,140
I just know it's gonna die on me again because when this happens a bunch...

1559
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:55,140
When this happens a bunch, I know my stream is gonna hold on,

1560
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:57,140
but I'm like super tempted to do something before that.

1561
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:01,140
I like really want to go on RuneScape and bother Shawnee.

1562
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,140
Let me turn off Stanley Parable.

1563
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:08,140
I'm sorry guys.

1564
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,140
How do I... Do I have to make an account?

1565
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:18,140
Okay.

1566
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:23,140
Old school RuneScape.

1567
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:30,140
I'm just gonna casually stream.

1568
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,140
Don't tell her.

1569
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,140
Don't fucking tell her.

1570
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,140
Don't tell her.

1571
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,140
You little bitches.

1572
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,140
I know you fucking want to.

1573
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,140
You little bitches.

1574
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:44,140
It's free to make the account.

1575
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:45,140
All right.

1576
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,140
I've never played RuneScape in my life.

1577
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,140
My internet lasts long enough.

1578
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,140
Hold on.

1579
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,140
We'll find out.

1580
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:03,140
I just think my computer just can't handle the Stanley Parable for some reason.

1581
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:05,140
That's kidding.

1582
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:06,140
No, it's just my...

1583
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,140
Oh, what the fuck?

1584
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,140
I'm so done with the asking for cookies.

1585
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:13,140
What's my birthday?

1586
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,140
September 28th.

1587
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:18,140
September 28th.

1588
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:29,140
Oh, I have to check a verification code.

1589
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,140
Fuck me.

1590
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,140
Please choose an account name.

1591
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:53,140
Hold on.

1592
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,140
I need a cool name.

1593
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,140
Guys, help me pick a name.

1594
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,140
Can you guys help me think of a name?

1595
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,140
Stanley Parable is running through Portal 2.

1596
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,140
Oh, is it?

1597
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,140
Why do I look so demonic?

1598
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,140
Why are my eyes just like...

1599
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:15,140
The child in yellow, whatever that game is called.

1600
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,140
Help me think of a cool name.

1601
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,140
I need a cool badass name for RuneScape.

1602
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,140
Oh, wait.

1603
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,140
Does it matter if I have a username?

1604
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:32,140
And then I just make a character name.

1605
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:33,140
Is the username different from the character name?

1606
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,140
Not Sheebie.

1607
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,140
The Sheedmeister.

1608
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,140
Mr. Siappet.

1609
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,140
Darkened McOrphan Pain.

1610
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,140
Sheebie Detroit.

1611
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:51,140
No, Ben.

1612
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,140
Get destroyed.

1613
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,140
Remove yourself from the premises.

1614
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,140
Terrible.

1615
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,140
Shubby.

1616
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,140
The Sheebie Parable.

1617
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:14,140
Baroness, cotton bum.

1618
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,140
Hold on.

1619
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,140
Let's do this for my account name.

1620
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,140
Why is that not allowed?

1621
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,140
Serious?

1622
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:47,140
Why is this name not allowed?

1623
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:52,140
Oh my god.

1624
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,140
Wait, I forgot how to spell Mistress.

1625
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,140
What?

1626
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,140
That's what works.

1627
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,140
Are you serious?

1628
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,140
It wouldn't let me do Sheebie Cotton Bum

1629
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:26,140
or Sheebie Cotton.

1630
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,140
It wouldn't let me do Cotton or Sheebie.

1631
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,140
I don't...

1632
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,140
Wait, I have to download the game?

1633
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,140
I just want to play Old School RuneScape.

1634
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,140
I thought that was a game you just play in the window.

1635
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:10,140
I'm literally gonna cry.

1636
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,140
Can you...

1637
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:19,140
I'm gonna strangle their webpage

1638
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:21,140
because this is not loading.

1639
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:24,140
Okay, Cotton.

1640
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:25,140
Yeah, but like...

1641
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:30,140
Oh.

1642
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,140
There's almost 200 people on this.

1643
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:42,140
On this game.

1644
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:45,140
Come on, I just want to play RuneScape.

1645
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,140
I'm gonna strangle too.

1646
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:54,140
Holy crap.

1647
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:01,140
You created a new character for me.

1648
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,140
Lovely.

1649
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:04,140
Create.

1650
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,140
Manage.

1651
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:15,140
Why is this so confusing?

1652
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,140
What is...

1653
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:18,140
Am I dumb?

1654
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:21,140
Wait, I have to get to...

1655
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:22,140
Okay, I'm done. Never mind then.

1656
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:24,140
If I have to do the tutorials and everything

1657
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,140
and I just can't go and just like try to kill Strawny as a joke

1658
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,140
or like try to flirt with her or something

1659
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,140
and be a cringe

1660
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,140
then I'm not dumb enough.

1661
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,140
I'll do that later then.

1662
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,140
Tutorial, I could speedrun through it?

1663
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,140
No.

1664
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,140
It was all fine.

1665
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:49,140
We're just gonna raid...

1666
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:51,140
Just gonna raid mom.

1667
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:54,140
We're just gonna raid mom.

1668
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,140
I don't know why I'm so tired.

1669
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:01,140
Maybe because I didn't go to sleep till 1am again.

1670
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:03,140
Then I woke up at 6am.

1671
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,140
I'm not the best bunny.

1672
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,140
I'm a bad bunny.

1673
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,140
Are you seeing bad bunny?

1674
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,140
Wait.

1675
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:23,140
Hold on, let me see who's streaming.

1676
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,140
I see the...

1677
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,140
Hold on.

1678
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,140
Hold on.

1679
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,140
Hold on.

1680
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,140
God!

1681
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,140
Too many windows open!

1682
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,140
Strawny it is.

1683
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:00,140
Alright.

1684
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,140
Later nerds.

1685
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,140
I'm gonna go in a...

1686
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:06,140
Emen Hera somewhere.

1687
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,140
Somewhere else.

1688
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,140
So I apologize for the scuff.

1689
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:16,140
But um...

1690
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,140
I think you know.

1691
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,140
It's just you know...

1692
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,140
It's a part of me.

1693
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,140
I was born with it.

1694
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,140
I was molded by the scuff.

1695
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:25,140
And my internet keeps changing.

1696
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,140
I love you.

1697
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:27,140
Bye!

1698
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,140
No I don't.

1699
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:29,140
I don't fucking love you.

1700
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:31,140
Don't get the fucking head.

1701
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:32,140
Fuck you.
