You

15:09.000 --> 15:12.080
She's a scream of horror.

15:12.080 --> 15:12.920
It's fine.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.200
I'm going to get the carrot.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.240
I'm not going to get the carrot.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.720
Should we redo this level?

15:19.720 --> 15:20.800
Yeah, you want to get the carrot?

15:20.800 --> 15:21.760
I think it's past the portal.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.800
We're going to try to get like the carrot.

15:23.800 --> 15:24.720
All right, you're in front.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.920
Don't kick me in the face.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.000
OK, how do we get out of here without dropping?

15:34.840 --> 15:37.080
I think, hold on, let me position myself.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.040
I think I can kick you across.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.440
Oh, shit, OK.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.200
Just a moment.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.880
Hold on, I'm almost there.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.480
I'm so close.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.400
OK, that's not going to work.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
I need to flip.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.600
It's fine.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.280
It's fine.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.120
I'm getting into position.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.080
Yes, get into position.

16:05.080 --> 16:09.680
Oh, damn it, that didn't work.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.440
This is how I move around.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.600
Did you want to do it again?

16:13.600 --> 16:16.320
It's OK, we can try again.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.080
All right, what if we just launch ourselves?

16:19.080 --> 16:21.560
What if we just launch ourselves?

16:21.560 --> 16:22.840
I'm going to.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.040
What's happening?

16:24.040 --> 16:26.520
Why are you planking?

16:26.520 --> 16:28.320
I thought I was going to fall.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.560
All right, what if I just got a scooch?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.640
Nope, nope.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.360
No, sorry.

16:38.360 --> 16:42.360
I'm so sorry.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.760
Oh, I killed her.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.760
I killed her.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.760
I'm so sorry.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.760
I hate you too.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.760
Oh.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.800
I'm an acrobat.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.880
As you say, anything you say.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.720
Yandere, queen.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.400
Oh, wait, hold on.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.400
Let me just.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.880
It works.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.480
All right, I believe in you, Marcy.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.480
No, Marcy.

17:21.160 --> 17:21.960
It's fine, it's fine.

17:21.960 --> 17:22.960
Damn it.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
Next level.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.320
Sure.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.720
It's only going to get harder from here, girly pop.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.520
It's OK.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.040
Yeah.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.920
Yeah.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.720
All right, it's a little gap.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.640
All right, I think.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.040
Oh, don't kill yourself.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.880
OK, OK.

17:47.880 --> 17:48.960
Can you?

17:48.960 --> 17:49.400
All right.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.760
How do I kick again?

17:50.760 --> 17:52.000
Yeah.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.360
Damn it.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.360
You got to jump over that.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.920
Nice.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.080
You got this.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.280
You got this.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.040
You got this.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.840
Oh, so carefully.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.000
Do you remember how to grab?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.600
I left a button.

18:08.600 --> 18:08.920
Yes.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.080
You got it.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.960
Oh, yes, queen.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.200
Flip to victory.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.840
Oh, you did it.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.920
Nice job.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.560
Oh, my god.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.480
Why does it say we didn't get the carrot?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.480
It said I got the carrot.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.120
Oh, I just don't count.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.920
Yeah.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.400
Is it behind us?

18:29.400 --> 18:29.760
Sorry.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.200
Pardon me.

18:30.200 --> 18:30.680
Excuse me.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.720
Pardon me.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.760
It's not.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.800
All right, it's fine.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.960
Acrobatics, acrobatics, acrobatics.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.920
Why am I holding on to you?

18:39.920 --> 18:42.520
Because we need each other.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.280
Yeah.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.760
Imagine you could jump like this.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.760
Let's see.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.760
Mercy carry.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.520
I don't think so.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.560
No.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.960
All right, we can also help each other over the gaps.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.640
Hold on.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.720
I'll be there shortly.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.560
One moment.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.520
If I flip.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.320
There we go.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.640
See, now we're a little bit longer,

19:09.640 --> 19:11.560
so we can flip over the gap.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.360
Oh.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.840
Yeah, so you got to rotate.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.600
Perfect.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.000
We are speed.

19:18.000 --> 19:18.520
I got you.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.360
Don't worry.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.800
We are speed.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.480
We are.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.240
Wait, where's the carrot?

19:22.240 --> 19:23.080
Where's the carrot?

19:23.080 --> 19:23.800
It's back there.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.720
No, Mercy.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.600
Is it level?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.000
OK.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.800
Mercy's like, I'm not even going to bother going

19:35.800 --> 19:38.640
for the carrot.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.160
What's that place?

19:41.160 --> 19:41.560
I don't know.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.200
Why don't you find out?

19:44.200 --> 19:45.280
You got it?

19:45.280 --> 19:46.080
Oh, hello.

19:46.080 --> 19:46.440
Hold on.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.080
I need you.

19:47.080 --> 19:47.480
You need?

19:47.480 --> 19:48.600
Oh, fuck.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.680
She just took me.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.760
I just got kidnapped.

19:54.760 --> 20:00.080
Please do not throw me to my death, sister.

20:00.080 --> 20:00.680
Let's go.

20:05.160 --> 20:05.880
All right.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.440
I need to hold on to me because I

20:07.440 --> 20:09.520
want to be able to cross this gap.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.240
How do I do this?

20:11.240 --> 20:12.880
It's a great question.

20:12.880 --> 20:13.520
Perfect.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.880
All right.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.000
Wow.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.720
We are a wheel.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.720
We are the first wheel invented.

20:19.800 --> 20:25.920
Oh, no, stop.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.000
We were not going to make that.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.560
OK, we have to jump over.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.680
Mercy, you got to go first.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.960
You're in front.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.440
I got to be first.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.120
No, yeah, you got to go.

20:39.120 --> 20:39.640
Oh, god.

20:43.000 --> 20:43.640
You got this.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.640
Yes.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.640
Yes, queen.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.160
All right.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.640
I'll be there in a moment.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.600
Yeah.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.120
Let's go.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.920
Nice.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.920
We're such gods at this.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.880
Wow.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.200
Oh, shit.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.400
I'm actually I'm surprised at how well we're doing.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.120
Oh, oh, hold on.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.760
Oh, don't die.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.720
Oh, nice job.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.840
Impressive.

21:18.840 --> 21:19.360
All right.

21:19.360 --> 21:26.040
Oh, oh, you got this.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.160
Oh, nice, nice, straight leg.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.240
Save.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.760
Carrot.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.040
You want to get it this time here?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.240
I accidentally jumped backwards, so it's all used.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.120
I'll try my best.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.760
Oh, no, I had seltzer water and I need to burp.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.880
I'm stuck.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.360
I got you.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.120
Oh, yeah, you can take it.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.160
I'm sorry.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.960
I took the carrot, not you.

21:51.960 --> 21:52.760
It's OK.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.360
I just got to get it out.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.440
All right.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.440
Yeah.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.880
I'm going backwards.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.000
Oh, what's happening?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.960
Oh, OK, I'm fine.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.520
We're good.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.760
No, mercy, please.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.760
Acquired.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.440
Wait, you dropped the carrot.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.800
No, I didn't.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.680
Oh, never mind.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.320
Oh, yeah, sometimes for this game, it's like,

22:23.320 --> 22:25.680
Lilly, NC is really weird.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.160
Sometimes you'll fly off the screen and then come back.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.480
Oh, I'm being taken with.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.440
Oh, no longer.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.440
Ah!

22:37.440 --> 22:39.280
Oh, I'm fine.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.600
It's OK, I'm good.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.920
With the carrots up there, I think.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.160
I know.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.160
It's fine.

22:47.160 --> 22:47.660
Hwa.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.680
Yeah.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.440
Wait, where is the hole?

22:56.440 --> 22:57.360
Where is the hole?

22:59.680 --> 23:00.600
OK, it's OK.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.720
Just a flesh wound.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.400
Just a little flesh wound.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.120
It's fine.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.800
Why is your blood like that?

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
I don't know.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.240
Oh, you just, it's your good.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.000
This thing, I just got your little toesies.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.040
It's got a little toesies.

23:14.040 --> 23:14.960
I'm going to hold on to you.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.960
What?

23:15.960 --> 23:16.960
Oh, no!

23:16.960 --> 23:17.960
Oh, no!

23:21.960 --> 23:23.960
You left me for dead!

23:23.960 --> 23:25.960
I'm so sorry!

23:25.960 --> 23:27.960
You left me for dead!

23:27.960 --> 23:29.960
I killed her!

23:29.960 --> 23:31.960
I killed her!

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
I killed my daddy!

23:32.960 --> 23:34.960
I'm so sorry!

23:34.960 --> 23:36.960
I'm horrible!

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Give me!

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Give me a kiss in here!

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I'm so sorry!

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Wait, now what?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I'm just stuck!

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm impaled!

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Wait, move?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Are you not dead?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Why are you here?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Why are you fucking dead?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Wait, press the X button.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Because it should have, it should have,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
restocked it by now if you died.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
All right, go back to the medial to restart this one.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Let's pretend this never happened.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Number seven?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah, I think it was number seven.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
The senpais are raging.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I'm so sorry, senpais.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
They're okay.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Okay, I scared myself.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
All right, you got this, Mercy.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
You can jump across, I believe in you.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh, yeah, the tree gets in the way a little bit.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
You might have to lean forward.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
You might have to like tilt like this and then jump.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Oh, uh, I'm in a pickle.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Never mind.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Avenge me!

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
It's fine, I'm just gonna swing.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
No, Mercy, why?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Why?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
You're not gonna go!

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I wasn't about to let you die, Comrade.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Thank you.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
All right, okay, so it's fine, I'm just gonna...

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Just gonna rock with it.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Pro strats.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Nice.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I almost got it, she's making momentum.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
It doesn't matter, I'm probably gonna die on this, it's fine.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Let me just edge a little closer.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
Oh my god, I am a master.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Hold on, I'm gonna throw this carrot down to you.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Okay.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Where'd I fucking go?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Oh, we gotta go back.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Okay.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
You can grab it, if you can grab it.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I grabbed you!

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
I can't do this!

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm trying to push it towards you.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Okay, I got it.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
No, I grabbed the ground.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Okay, now I got it.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Oh gosh, my cat just jumped on my desk, hold on.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Boomie, please.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh gosh, I couldn't see.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
All right, lead the way.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Okay.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
She's doing sit-ups.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Don't...

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
She'll be the backup for you.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Maybe just a little bit.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
It's okay, you got this.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
You don't got this, it's fine, it's fine.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I can't even kill myself properly.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Oh, there we go.

26:55.000 --> 27:04.000
All you.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Oh shit.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm clapping.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
It's like it's hurting you every flip.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
All right, it's fine.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Oh wait, I'll backup.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Nice form, amazing.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I think I just started lightning outside my window.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Holy crap, that was bright.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Yes!

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
We didn't get the carrot.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
But we got each other.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
It wasn't about the destination, it was the journey.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
What the fuck is this?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, it's a little bouncy thing.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Can we bounce backwards?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
You might have to bounce backwards on top of each other.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Quick.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
That's hard.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't know if we can...

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Can I like, grab onto your legies?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Maybe.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
And then we have like, you know...

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Extra jump, go for it.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I'm being smacked in the face by this thing.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Oh, okay, well...

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Oh, I need your butt.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I'm trying so hard.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh wait, I got you.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Oh, hello.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
This is quite romantic, to be honest.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I think we're both too heavy for this thing.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
All right.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Man, that was romantic.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
That was, we just held each other and bounced around.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
We could have kissed.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
We really wanted.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
We could.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Kissed.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
What did I need to do?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
This bitch keeps on killing me.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Wait, I didn't tweet with that.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I was live.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Did you tweet with that you were live?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
No, I didn't.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Okay, let's tweet that we're live.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
There's thunder and lightning outside my house right now.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Are you gonna be okay?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
I hope so.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Okay, I can tweet that right now.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Oops, been live for like 30 minutes already.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
That's usually how it works for me.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I casually foregoer.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Live and hysterically laughing.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
I keep accidentally killing Mercy.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Whoops.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Get in here.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Hold on.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I'm just gonna quote, retweet yours.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Alrighty.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
There we go.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Where's my live button?

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
Perfect.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
She be a murderer.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Hello, is there a nothing to see here?

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
Sometimes my BDSM play gets a little bit too rough.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
Yeah, but you know, Mercy's not, you know,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
unfamiliar with a little pain.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
You got this, Mercy.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I'll back up.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
You got this.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
I believe in you.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I believe in you so hard.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Okay, it's fine.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Let me just...

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
Romeo and Juliet impaled through my ass.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
I got impaled with this bike up my IF.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Alright, we're doing good so far.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Yeah.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Oh, well, I'm fine.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
You're good.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I wonder if you could throw the carrot across.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Oh my God.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
I'm so scared.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
She's going to launch herself into the spikes.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Hi.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Mercy is durable indeed.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh my gosh.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
She is straddling that carrot.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Try to grab the carrot.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I'll die with you, my queen.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
When the gamer and the non-gamer play games.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Please.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Oh God.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm not a gamer.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
What do you mean?

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
Ask the harem.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
That's the one who played.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Alright.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
It's my time to shine.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
I will try my best.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Yes.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
When I try my best, I mean go backwards.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
I mean...

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Never mind.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
It's fine.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I was going to see if I could jump back over,

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
but it didn't really work out.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Well...

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Join me in the embrace of death.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Together our bodies and blood intertwined.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
69, baby.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Wee.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
You're just doing flips in the air on my screen

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
for no reason.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Because you're not touching me.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Oh, I got you.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
I got you.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Don't move.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
I got you.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Don't move.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I will grab you.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Hold on.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Let me just figure this out.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
I saw I had it.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I saw I had it.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
I got you.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Let go.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
I got you.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
I am letting go.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Oh.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Perfect.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Okay.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
I'll never let go.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
What?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I'm trying to avoid the thingy.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
If I need to.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
All right.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
All right.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
All right.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Why did you get bit down?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
I don't even...

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I don't even know what happened there.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I think we should f the carrot on this one.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Wee.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
If I randomly lose power,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
it's because the raging thunderstorm

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
outside my house randomly.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Oh, I'll join you.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
My legs spread.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Retty to accept death

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
in its purest form.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Like how did I badly mess up?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Fuck these trees.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
You got it.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
You got it.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
All right.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Careful.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Perfect.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Okay, we got it.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
All right.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Fuck that carrot.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Good.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Oh, I almost kicked you off.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Oh my God.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Oh my God.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
We're fine.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Okay.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
We have one issue.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
We do have an issue.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
It's okay.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
I'm going to grab you.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
I'm going to grab you.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
I got you.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Let go.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
You got me?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Yeah.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
I tried.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
In the end, it didn't even matter.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Oh my God.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Mercy.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Mercy.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Oh, God.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Actually do that.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Perfect.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I'm keeping you with me.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Maybe I shouldn't have kept you with me.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I like how we're only on like the first area.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Okay.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Will we ever pass the gap of spikes?

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
No, but we will 69 while we die.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Like how bad are we at this game?

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
I'm pretty fucking bad.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I won't admit.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I don't even know how you can be good at this game though.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Nice.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Impressive.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Okay.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Okay.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Oh, never mind.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
I tried.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
That was so close.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Oh, you want to hold on?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Well, I think we're stuck.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
I am.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
I am.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Let go.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Okay.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Perfect.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Okay.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Are you okay?

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Are you fucking dead?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
I'm dead.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Take my dead body with you.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Okay.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Wait, where were we supposed to go after that?

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
No, once one of us dies, we can't finish the level.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Oh.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
So the thing disappears.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
What the fuck is happening?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
I was holding on.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Okay.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Perfect.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
We're good.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
I let go.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Nice.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
All right.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Grab my ass.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Are you ready?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
I grabbed your ass.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Are you ready?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Okay.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
That was supposed to have the opposite effect.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
I was hoping it would propel us forward, but it didn't.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
I just saw a red flash of lightning outside my window.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
That was pretty cool.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Red?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Yep.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Okay, I'm good.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
Those back shots, I suppose.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
I was going to grab you.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Well, now I have to grab you.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Hold on.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Please.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Please.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Sorry, my fat ass killed you.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
I know I got dragon lightning outside of my house right now.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Dragon deez ball.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Sorry.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Anyways.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Oh, nice kick.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Nice kick.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
If only we could get over this fucking line.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
What was that?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
Wait, I'm going to hold on and then you can kick off.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Ready?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Go.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Go as hard as you can.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Why do we go backwards when this happens?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Maybe if we aim the other way.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Can we blast off?

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
All right.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Well, I'm just going to take you with me.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I'll let go.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Oh.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Oh.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Oh.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Hold on just a moment.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
What if I...

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Well, goodbye, carrot.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Do a cheeky...

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Well, bye, me.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
Yeah, there's a physics glitch where if you hold on to each other's feet, you can like

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
propel yourself across the game.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
So I was trying to do that.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
Will we ever get past this level?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
I don't know.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
We're going to try.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
But...

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
I believe in us.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
We'll do it.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Oh, sorry.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
I fucked up your jump.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Let me back up.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Don't worry.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Whoa.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Impressive landing.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Impressive death even more so.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Wait, it showed that you died for me.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
It didn't show that you died for me.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
I think people on my side can see that you're just glitching profusely.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Oh, what the hell?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Wait, you're still alive?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Oh.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Nice.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Oh my God, Mercy.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
You're so goaded.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Let's go.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Baby Chibi, you should take the carrot.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
You want me to take the carrot?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
All right.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Carrot acquired.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Mercy glitched the system.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Are you in front of me or behind me?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I'm in front of you.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Okay, I just want to make sure.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
Because again, sometimes the game will reflect something else.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Oh, Mercy.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
It's okay.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Oh my God, I got a carrot.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Okay.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
All you got to do is make it across.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
All you got to do is make it across.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Immediately dies.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
It's fine.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
It's fine.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
We got this.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
It's fine.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
It's fine.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
You're good.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
All according to plan.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
All according to plan.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
All according to plan.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
69 each time.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Every time in death, we just die in another sex position.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Very, very on character for us.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
All right.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Let's go.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
You got it.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Nice.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Amazing landing.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Can you back up?

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
I don't want to actually kick you and then make you fly across to your death.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
All right.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
You got to angle this.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Oh my fucking God.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
This game is called super buddy man.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Hello.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
I'm playing with Mercy.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Mercy, you can just die.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
I died, Mercy.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I have to like literally wiggle my way down.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
I know sometimes it gets increasingly hard to kill yourself in this game.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
All right.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
All right.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Oh my God.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Oh, okay.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Let me go back for you.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Hold on.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
It's okay.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Goodbye.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
No, I was coming back.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I literally could have grabbed her.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Size and pale self on spikes.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
I'm sorry.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I truly am.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
So sorry.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
We're all in this together.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
Watching you slowly sit up to grab the carrot is really funny.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Amazing execution.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Oh, no.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Oh, no.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Oh.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
What?

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
I love this game.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
It's just, you just have a bunch of laughs.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
It's just the funniest thing ever.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
It's like so gentle and then immediately hold on.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Can you back up?

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Okay.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
I'm good.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Oh.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Layed it on my face.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Oh, it's fine.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Amazing recovery.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Yes.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Yes.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
You get the carrot.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
You want me to get the carrot?

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
I'll try.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And when I say I'll try, I mean I'll almost.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Okay.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
All right.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Carrot acquired.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Carrot acquired.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
You're still your hateful one.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Yes.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
You recovered.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
What the heck?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Let's fucking go.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I got the carrot.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I love you.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Glitch that.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
I don't know.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Sometimes the game glitches.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
It looks like you die, but you don't.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
All right.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
All right.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
All we got to do, Mercy, is make it across.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Oh, Mercy.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Mercy.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Mercy, I need your help.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Mercy, I need you to grab me.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Mercy.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Mercy, please.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Mercy.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
I'm trying my best.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Just a little hard to get over this.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I'm slowly sliding down.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I'm slowly sliding to my death.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Please.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Mercy, please.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Give me a second.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
I got you.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Oh, thank God.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I thought I was a goner.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
All right.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
I'll give you some space.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Go on.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Give me a second.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Watch out for the red button.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Impressive.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Amazing.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
She is the moment.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
See what I mean by like that area is hard.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Yep.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
All right.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
See if you can jump over the button.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
The thing is just on the other side.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
You might want to lean the other way.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
I'm going to lean the other way.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Not that way.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Oh, my God.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
If I could just...

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Okay.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
All right.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Go to the portal.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Go to the portal.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Amazing.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
All right.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Don't die.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
God, I laughed so hard.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I nearly peached my shell.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm like, don't die.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
And I just immediately fucking die.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
All right.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I ruined that.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
It's all right.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Okay.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Hold on.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
I try.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Let me just kill myself.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Oh, hello.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Oh, perfect.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
That worked.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
All right.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I fucked that carrot.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
And me too, apparently.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
I hate that.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
This is going to become a rage game if you don't get past this level.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
You're standing on my body.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Can I stand on your body?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
What the hell?

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
Being a rabbit in the hoppy hills.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Playing games.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
And shit.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Doing...

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Yeah.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Shit.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Nice.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
All right.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
We're getting somewhere.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Oh, my God.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
This might be it, guys.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
This might be...

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Oh, hello.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
All right.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Actually, that might be helpful.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Perfect.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Oh, no.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Oh, nice job.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Wait, shit.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Okay.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Fuck the carrot.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
We launched into orbit.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
All right.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Sorry.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
I'm so sorry.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
Oh.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Oh, what the hell?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Oh, at least there's not spikes here.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
But there's spikes over there.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Am I dead?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I think you are.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
How did you die?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't know.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Weird.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
You, like, died off screen.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
I died off screen.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
I was like, where did I go?

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Maybe you hit the spike and we didn't see.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
I don't know.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Oh.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
His face flooded into my ass.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
It's okay.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Her ass smells nice.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I did take a shower today.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Amazing precision.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
All right.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
It's okay.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
It's okay.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
It's not okay.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
It's okay.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Almost first try.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
We almost did it.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
This is definitely an easier one.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
I feel like we can do, though.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I think I can get the carrot.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Yeah.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Easy peasy.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Carrot acquired.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
If I could, if I could just, can I, can I please just,

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
if I could, if I could just, please.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Oh, there we go.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
All right, Mercy.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I'm just going to go to the portal.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
If I can get over this thing.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
I'm trying my best.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
I'm sorry.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
I know it's hard.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
I was also like struggling.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
So I don't blame you at all.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
It's funny.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
You're doing the stuff in like slow motion on my screen.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Okay.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
There's something over here that should kill us.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
It's a gap.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Oh my God.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
You got it.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
I was so careful.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
I was so careful.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
I'm like, you got the, why is every, I'm never speaking.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I'm always just like, oh, we got this.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
And then we just immediately die.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
All right.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Oh, how did I get down here?

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
We got each other.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Just the two of us.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
All right.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
You probably can grab that carrot.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Can I grab a carrot?

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
I'm just going to be doing fucking flips on this thing.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Why am I just in the air?

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
What is happening?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Help, grab me.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
I got you.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Okay.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Oh wait, we actually should be able just to go over like this.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Yeah.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
All right.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
We should have done that.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Oh, let go.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Nice.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
All right.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
I got it.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I need to just scoop forward.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Nice.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Nice.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Nice.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
I see the perfect.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
All right.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
So there's a little gap and you just got to jump across it.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
I believe in you.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Maybe you should grab the carrot.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You want me to grab the carrot?

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
I'll grab the carrot.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Wait, maybe we should hold on to each other.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
I don't, I think we have to jump this.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
I don't think, if we try to flip, I think we'll just kill ourselves.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Oh, okay.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Unless you want, we can try.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
What if we both grab the carrot?

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
If I could just, if I could please.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
It's okay.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
You can jump.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I won't even let me get it.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Okay.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Here, I'll grab it.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
You may grab it.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
I got it.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I shouldn't have grabbed the carrot.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I shouldn't have grabbed it.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Give me a second.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I want to see if there's like a possibility of us,

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
of me shooting.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Shooting your shot.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Yeah.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Across the thing.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Go for it.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
No.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
You just have to like, you have to angle like this.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
So I'll show you.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
You just got to, you just got to be like this.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
You got to lean forward.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
You got to balance, but go forward and then jump like that across.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Like that.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Here, let me just grab you.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Oh.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
I let go.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
All right.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Or I could kick you across that gap.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Give me a second.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
There you go.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Well, welcome back.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Welcome back.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Give me a second.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
I'll give you a second.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Or maybe more than one second.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Yeah.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
I almost got it.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
I got the carrot.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Let's make it over now.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Oh.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
Okay.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Okay.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
It's fine.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
It's fine.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Grappy.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
You might be able to grab me.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Never mind.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Never mind.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
It's so ogre.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
It's so ogre.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Kick me in the face.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
I can kick you in the face.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
No.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Give me a second.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Give me a push me forward a little.

54:43.000 --> 55:03.000
That was just dead silence as I just flew away to my death.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Let's go.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
What is that?

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
That's the physics glitch.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Oh, hi kitty.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
You need to get out of the way kitty.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
I can't see kitty.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Oh my gosh.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
I can't see myself.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Did I fucking die?

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Oh, no.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
I can't see myself either.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Oh, there I am.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
Nice.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Let's go.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I don't know what happened.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I don't know how that happens.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That's all up to you now.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Take your time.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
It's so ogre for me.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Take your time, Mercy.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Think it through.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Yep.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Yep.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Scooch a little bit closer.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
And then when you're at a nice 45 degree angle,

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
you're going to want to tip in the forward direction.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
So lean forward.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Go for it.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
When you're at that like teetering point,

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
you're about to be on your hands and knees.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
Give me it.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Take your time.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
It's all right.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Just take your time.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
Think, be careful.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Think it through.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
You're fine.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
You're good.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
You're good.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
You got this.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
You're amazing, Mercy.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
So amazing.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
Just lean forward.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Just a tad.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Jump.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Yeah.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Mercy, let's go.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
My girl.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
That's my genome right there, everybody.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
All right.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
What's going on over here?

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
It's okay.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
I just got a little bit of my toesies.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
I'm good.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Be careful.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Nice.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
I got you.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
I got you.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Come back.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Don't worry.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
I got you.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Yeah.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
This is like a great team building exercise game.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
We should grab each other's legs or something.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
That's a good idea.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
There you go.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
It's okay.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
We're getting somewhere.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
This is working out perfectly.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
What if I lean up?

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Oh.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
This is impressive.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I have amazing upper body strength.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Wait, see if you can flip over on my body.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Let go of me.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Oh, no, that didn't work.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
No, that didn't work.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
Actually, you might be able to use your legs to propel yourself up.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Yeah.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Use me like a springboard.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
I'll hang out just like this.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
You just kick me in the ass.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
I'll try to grab your leggings.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Nice.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Oh, almost got it.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Sorry.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Sorry.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
I'm trying to angle myself better.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Nice.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
All right.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
I'll figure this out.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
How do we get you?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I am the bunny master.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Mercy, where'd you go?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I definitely got up here.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Where'd she go?

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
Down.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Down.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
To my town.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
We're going down, down in an early area.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Yeah, to my death.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
I'm so strong.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Um.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Whoops.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
I'm fine.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Just my hands.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Oh, sorry.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
My cat's food is going off.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Oh, you're ready?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Me?

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
I'm like a bunny.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I flipped through.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Okay.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Let me just.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Yep.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
Okay.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
All right.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
Yeah.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
You want to lean a little bit more forward.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Perfect.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Nice.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Oh, yes.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Incredible.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
All right.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Let me let's do what we did before.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Oh, you don't even need me.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
We did it.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Oh my God.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
We're pros.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Oh.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
I'm so sorry.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
What happened?

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
I accidentally, when I tried to jump over the gap,

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I kicked you back at the same time.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Hold on.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Let me go.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Your body is facing through the walls.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Oh, is it?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
On your end, I'm on just on top.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
Let me see if I can fix it by grabbing you.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
Okay.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
Hello.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
I was such a pro for a second.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Oh, okay.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Oh, you can keep rolling like this.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Go forward.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Yeah.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Nice.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Wow.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
We are so good at this.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Wait.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Oh, the carrots right there.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Is it a trap?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
No, it's not.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
We're good.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
All right.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I'll grab the carrot.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
If I could just.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
The carrot.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The trap up here.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I got it.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Oh, nice.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
All right.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'll let you go first.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
You got this.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Oh, definitely.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Oh.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Oh.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Yep.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Yep.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Yep.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Oh, God.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So nervous.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Oh, God.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Oh, God.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Oh, God.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Oh, God.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Oh, God.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Oh, God.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Oh, God.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Oh, God.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Oh, God.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Oh, God.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Oh, God.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
So nervous.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I'm so scared you're going to roll into the button.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Hold on.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Let me get back up there so you can see better.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Oh, nice job.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Nice job.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Okay.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
No.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Let me let me join you.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
All right.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Let me just.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:18.000
You have to jump over because we're going to fuck each other for over there.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Nice recovery.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Oh, God.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I love watching mercy work.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Work out what she's going to do next.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Nice.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Oh, my gosh, mercy.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You're incredible.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Okay.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Now I just can't fuck this up.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Okay.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I'm good.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's okay.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I stabbed my footsie a little bit, but it's fine.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Oh, all right.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
What?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I grabbed it.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Oh, okay.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Oh, at least on my end I did.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
But if it if it shows up for you, you can grab it.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
You're you're in perpetual.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I already got in.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So the game's just glitching.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Oh, mercy.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Oh, mercy.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Please.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I'm sorry.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You did it.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yay.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Wait, I did it.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
On my side.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You did.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It still says unlocked.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Really?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Oh, we need to get more.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
We needed to get more coins.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Okay.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Okay.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So let's go back to the menu and then we need one more coin.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So we should probably go get a carrot for one of them.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Number one looks like the easiest one.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Did we already grab that carrot?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
No, wait.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Did we not?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Yeah.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Hold on.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Oh, we can do the time thing really fast.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Yeah.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Oh, we weren't.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
We were already too slow.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
All right.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Yeah.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Let's try that again.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Try that again.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
The time one should be easier.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Go.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Fucking trees.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Never mind.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
We start.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Go.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Fuck.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Damn it.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I was too slow.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Is six minutes good enough?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
No, we gotta see how there's like a ghost.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
You have to do it in five seconds.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
What?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Yep.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Go.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Oh, I fucked up.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
So you can see the little ghost bunny.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It's like it's a ghost race from Mario.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Can I please get up?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I've never done a ghost race for Mario before.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Mario Kart?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm so sorry.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I'm so slow.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
No, no, no.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It's also it's like whoever's behind like the second person.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It's hard to get the momentum because you're already at a disadvantage.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Oh my gosh.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
It's older.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Killing myself.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Farewell.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Well, just keep going.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Oh, it's a cat.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I never noticed that before.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Okay.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Maybe we should do a carrot one.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Yeah.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
We didn't do four carrot.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Let's try that one.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Where's the carrot?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Was the carrot behind us or in front of us?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I never get.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Hold on.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
No.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It was in front of us.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Oh yeah.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
There's like, yeah, there's one that.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That was a trap.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I could just, if I could, perfect.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Butt to butt.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I got you.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Don't worry about it.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
We got it.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Where's a carrot for this one?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Oh, it's down there.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Oh, that's an easy one to grab.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Yeah.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Let me try to grab it.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Yeah, you got that.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I'm going to go in the portal.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
All you girly pop.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Nice use of feet.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Mercy's good with her feet, everybody.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Not so much your hands.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I think you're grabbing the floor.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Nice.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
You got it.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Yeah.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Yeah.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Good job.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
We did it.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Can I go menu now?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Yes.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Then you should be able to do that.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You should be able to go the next level.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Where is it?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
That's a great question.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Go.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Why isn't it?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
We have 15.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Why isn't it automatically unlocking it?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Do we have to do it again?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Do you want to try to do 10 again and hopefully it'll prompt it?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Maybe.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Yeah, let's try it.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I'm going to cry.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
We don't have to.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It said 15 on the lock.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Why isn't it letting me move?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Oh, there you go.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Kick you across.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Kick you across.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yes.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
How does somebody do this in a short amount of time?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Very smartly.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I'll back up.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Give you some space, queen.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Amazing.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Flawless.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Yes.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Shit.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:25.000
You know, sometimes you just get stuck in places like me getting stuck here right now.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Oh, grab my feet.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
If you don't need the carrot, we already grabbed it before.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Grab my toesies.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Oh, god damn it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I'm trying to grab your feet, queen.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Or grab any part of me.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
You might be able to jump and grab.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Oh, shit.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Yeah.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Yeah.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I can't move.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Okay.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, god.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I'm going back.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm going to wait my turn.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I'll be taking this and saving it for later.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Thank you very much.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Perfect.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Just amazing.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I'm stuck.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'm stuck.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Step pro, I'm stuck.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Oh, well.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
What?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
What?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Pro, pro.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Don't ever think it, mercy.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
You got this.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Nice.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
All right.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Time to get the fuck up here again.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I'm back up.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Nice.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Got it.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Me, not so much.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Got it.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I made room for you.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Oh.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Oh.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Oh.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Help.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I'm just going to sit here and watch and creep.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Oh, god.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Nice.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yep.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Nice scoot.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Amazing.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You did it.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Nice job.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Let me not fall to my death.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Please.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
There we go.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yeah.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Next level.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Next level.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Oh, we're in snowy place now.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Okay.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So there's ice.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Wee.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Oh.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
This is going to be a hard one.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Wait, I'm fine.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
All right.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Let me just.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Damn it.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Carrots going to be hard to get.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I'm so sorry.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Mercy, just go in here.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Yeah.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Kick off.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Nice.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Amazing.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
All right.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Ready?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Lock in.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
She's just on her back.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Watch out for the spikes right there.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Nice job.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:00.000
All right.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
You're good.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
You're somehow still alive.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I'm impressed.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Let me grab you.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Let me see if I can grab.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I can do it.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Never mind.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Oh, sweet.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Okay.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Oh gosh.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Teamwork makes the dream work.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Where's the carrot up here?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Is it up there?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I don't know.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I'll lean back and see and you can scope it out.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Oh, it's up there.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
How the fuck?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000

02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:20.080
Okay, can we flip it again? Let's see if we can

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.360
And

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.520
Okay, damn it. Let's do it that time

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:28.320
It's okay

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:30.800
Marcy

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:34.800
I got it

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:38.240
All right, and we can just flip together to this one

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:41.280
And you can hold on

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:44.080
And I'll just jockey style hold on as well

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.440
Oh god

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.680
Okay, are you serious?

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:52.480
That's fine. Are you serious?

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:54.640
Oh, it's not fine

02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:00.480
Okay, I guess we got to be balanced to like

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:05.440
Like not in the middle, but I think like we both have to be holding on

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:08.240
I can't be holding on to you or you can't be holding on to me

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.280
I feel so cheated me too

02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:23.440
It's fine. It's okay. It'll come back. It'll come back. Don't worry. It'll bounce back to us. No, it won't actually ever got

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:27.040
This is the one that does that. Um, hold on to me. Maybe it works

02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:35.840
No, I forgot it goes down so it won't come back up. Yeah, that was another one that did that

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:44.080
Taking a sip of my wawa

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:53.200
Nice

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.040
What the hell that was weird

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.680
My chat can tell you I was not even near you

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.360
Wait, I'm not dead. Okay now I am

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.920

No, I'm holding on. I'm holding on. Yes. Okay. We got it. Yes

02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:42.820
