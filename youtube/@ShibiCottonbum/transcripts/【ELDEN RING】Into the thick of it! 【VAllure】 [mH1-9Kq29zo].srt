I was debating whether or not to get a psychology degree so I could be a therapist specifically for youtubers

96
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,040
Because it's a it's definitely a niche that that needs to be filled

97
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,360
Uh, there if was a youtuber would be interesting

98
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400

101
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,960
um mentally because it's a big transition

102
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600

104
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
I haven't even had time to be anxious about

105
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,800
Not having like a normal job

106
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:45,160

114
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
and she laughed at that

115
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
And then she said

116
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,120
Wait, uh, but my therapist is cool. She doesn't really uh

117
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
He doesn't like press me to pay or anything

118
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,280
But she's like wait, you don't have insurance anymore. Do you and I'm like well technically

119
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,800
I won't have insurance for like after three so I figured out I like I have insurance for like three months after I leave

120
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,200
and she's like

121
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,840
Uh, so she's like you should have them pay for your therapy because of all the stuff

122

That they make you do for them

123
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,400

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,640
Streamers he was my dad was telling me he watched like bourbon streamers on twitch. It's so funny. My dad's cooler than me

170
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I already know that

171
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
I'll speak in which I need to schedule

172
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,800
I want to do a street not a stream uh record. Maybe I'll do that when I'm gone

173
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,960
Yes

174
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:51,160
So what I'm so some of you who don't know. Hello. Hi. Um, I'm going to be gone for a week from the 18th to the 23rd

175
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,240
I'm going to go see my grandparents, but I wanted to go

176
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,240
Um, I wanted to record something in my absence

177
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,400
So I'm doing an ASMR and I was thinking if I was going to do a gameplay video, but now I'm I think I'm going to

178
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,080
Um, yeah, so week. I'm sorry. Um

179
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,760
I'm gonna do the video with my parents

180
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,280
And I'm gonna have them name v-tubers based off of their designs. So I'll probably grab like, uh,

181
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,520
Like obviously the v alert girls. I'll grab like, um, the people I've collabed with like

182
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,840
Mythos and like you may plus and then I'll grab like some like really popular indies just like iron mouse

183
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,520
um

184
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,680
And stuff and then some like haul alive girls obviously like chiara and nervisa and like some of the newer gen

185
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,280
So I and then see how my parents named them

186
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think my dad will just be like

187
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,120
I think both of my parents will just be like they have giant boobs

188
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,920
And this be so hung up on their outfits that they won't even

189
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,480
And I'm kind of nervous because I have to tell my my mom can be like my mom's very into fashion and so is my dad

190
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,640
But mostly my mom and she will like my mom again is very conservative

191
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
So she'll be like wow, she has her whole entire

192
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,280
Tire boobies out in her, you know, but does he whoa? Okay. This is this is what you do redacted

193
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
This is what you do. She me with your spare time

194
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,640
So I think it would be I just don't want my parents to roast people because they might roast people and I'm nervous

195
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
I might have to do disclaimer

196
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Um, but yeah, maybe I'll do that

197
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,240
Or we'll set up a donkas. I think I'll do that

198
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,720
Um

199
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,400
Instead of because I was trying to think of like, okay, what's a gameplay video that I can do

200
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
I can't think of anything so

201
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're just gonna

202
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Yeah

203
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,640
Feel like your mom would y'all at mercy given her vtuber lore

204
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,600
I'm not gonna make them look at the lore videos. I'm just be like, what is this outfit? Tell me what you think of it

205
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,920
I think my mom will really like straw knees outfit though and like theme. I think she'll think she's cute

206
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,240
And I think she'll like I I think I see will be my mom's favorite. I think mercy will be my dad's favorite

207
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,800
Father she be bourbon donathan one

208
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
maybe maybe I'll add that to like

209
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,760
My my donathan goals get my dad this particular bourbon

210
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,520
She means mom with the other girls now. Listen here young lady

211
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,360
I don't think my parents would like cute funny characters

212
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,720
Uh, at least go in a bit my sissac blumser model was like what is she naked?

213
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
I

214
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,440
Know I look I have I have a lot going on with my model. So I figured out I can probably make a toggle that takes off my

215
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
um

216
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,720
gag and my

217
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,560
ropes, but I've never

218
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,320
tried it

219
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,800
I could probably just sit here and do that right now actually

220
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,800
So mom is an ojisan and dad confirmed for a fifth. I know my mom is definitely an ojisan. My dad is definitely a senpai

221
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,440

222
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,080

225
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,440
Can you make a toggle that covers your chest for youtube sama? Uh, I usually just put something over my chest

226
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,360
I know um, it's still being made my tan toggle and my cover-up toggle to close my shirt

227
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,800
Is being made so that'll happen

Who's the danger sign?

232
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,080
Yeah, because that's what I when I ask people like what should I tell people that I do for my job

233
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,800
When they ask me people just say oh, you're with you work with a startup that's under nda and I'm like

234
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,920
Actually, but I'm gonna tell people that so that's what I think. What did I do the other day?

235
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Who asked me?

I forget who I think maybe it was one of my former coworkers is like, oh, what are you doing now?

248
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,960
V tubing has a huge audience base, but I never ever run into other vtubing fans. I never do

249
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,040
Although I found out one of my co-workers was a vtuber

250
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
And that she was pretty popular and I was like

251
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,200
And uh, I can't remember if she came on my stream at one point

252
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,480
And then I also was just like you can't tell anybody

253
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:03,880
But then I I graduated my last persona so nobody knows who I am now because I didn't want because all my co-workers started finding out my last persona

254
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,280
Because one of my co-workers I was doing a um, what's it called?

256
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,320
Um, I don't know if I'd play that on stream though because I would prefer just kind of do that by myself

257
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:24,520
Um, because I sometimes I although I should just play I need to play a horror game. I need to just play a horror game. Um

277
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Does that make a difference?

278
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,000

How about now is this sound good? I'm kidding. I know that sounds bad

285
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:34,920

Yeah, I didn't

334
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,760
Sometimes I I stand up and I've I didn't want to accidentally like flash my therapist because I um a video call with her

335
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,760
So, um, I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt, but before I wasn't wearing pants

336
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,240
Sushi. Oh, I haven't had sushi in so long

337
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,520
Plot twist bro is a model of some sort hence why they're working but hey, you know, that would be interesting

338
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
What you got in the frids condiments

339
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,560
You hate sushi, but you love fish. How what is wrong with you?

340
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,960
Oh, she got in the fridge is 80. I still haven't gone grocery shopping

341
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,200
What's the point of me growing grocery shopping if I'm gonna leave soon?

342
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Mocky rolls be mad tasty. Yeah

343
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,320
I don't know if I should have sushi though because my as you guys know my tummy's been really upset lately

344
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,320
So it's been hard for me to have food

345
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,440
I think my meds are making me nauseous

346
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,080
She be it's been like, yeah, and I've been living off a door dash. What do you want from me?

347
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
What do you expect?

348
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
No, I don't have any disorder

349
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,760
You guys have seen my body I'm very healthy looking

350
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,400
Can you cook I don't have anything to cook get Chick-fil-A. I don't want Chick-fil-A

351
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Your meal pepper. Yeah, whatever

352
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Green tea and whenever eases the stomach

353
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
I'm happy

354
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,280
No, sometimes, um, I think ever since I start I could tell you what meds I'm on. I don't I don't really care

355
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,680
Um, so I started some for my skin because my skin has been breaking out real bad. I think because of the um

356
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,200
The heat and stuff and I don't know if I'm having I don't know if I'm having reaction to something

357
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,040
If I'm like allergic to something and it's making me break out. I don't know. Um, but so I'm on

358
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,040
Uh, it's an antibiotic to help with um that and it's doxicillin

359
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,240
But doxicillin makes you very have really gives you really bad. Um

360
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,480
What's it called acid reflux and then

361
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,760
Spiral lactone which is supposed to help with the hormone. I don't want to pronounce it with the hormonal aspect of acne

362
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:19,240
Can also make you really nauseous. So that's why eczema gain rise up. Um, I don't have eczema

363
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:27,080
Doxicillin doxicycline. I think I don't know doxicycline. Are you taking our food? Uh

364
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,520
I try to but it's been really hard to eat

365
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,800
Spiral love do people take that?

366
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
That are transitioning. I didn't know that

367
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
The med's gonna dox me

368
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,560
Um

369
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,600
But yeah, so I take that to like because sometimes because women's hormones are always like all over the place

370
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,800
Especially because our hormonal cycles are a month are a month long. So my doctors is like

371
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,040
Uh, yeah, it seems like you're and then like mercy

372
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,120
Um, was telling me that my symptoms sound like I have polycystic ovary syndrome like picos and I'm like, I don't

373
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I don't know if I do

374
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,440
And she's like, I don't know. I should probably get the checked out on my facts

375
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,160
She's like, because you shouldn't be breaking on like you, right?

376
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
I should probably go to the doctor

377
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,600
It's part of a church. Oh, I didn't know that guys. I promise you I am a

378
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
This is

379
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,640
People are just like looking up and they're like, oh my god. She's not every woman or whatever the fuck

380
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Uh

381
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,360
A lot of people take medications

382
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Um

383
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,160
Cheapy go but I don't know what to eat and they have to order food and that means I have to go downstairs

384
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,960
I have to put on a bra. I have to put on better pants because they haven't shaved my legs

385
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Because I'm too lazy to shave my legs

386
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,560
Got some people get prescriptive eye area for their heart. I didn't know that

387
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,360
I don't know what I'm craving. I'm too nauseous to crave anything

388
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I

389
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,280
Have some yogurt or something. I usually have that. I don't have any yogurt. I told you I have condiments

390
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
In my fridge and that is all I have

391
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,000
I don't have ginger ale. I do have chicken noodle soup and I do have some oyster crackers

392
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,240
Huh, yeah, I'll have some chicken noodle soup

393
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,920
I forgot I had a can of that. Hold on. Let me go

394
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,360
No oatmeal. I think I have oatmeal. I don't know. It probably has like weevils in it or something because I haven't touched it in a while

395
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Um, my stomach is very sensitive in general because I get I have gherd so

396
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,880
In the doxocycline just makes it worse

397
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,840
I hate having acne, but it's actually going away. It's really awesome. It's only been like two weeks and I'm like

398
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:19,720
Holy shit. Yay. I don't look like a freaking nugget of leprosy. Not that I did before but you know women leave mind

399
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
I just blow stuff out of proportion

400
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,120
I just feel like I got like one sit on my face and I think I'm dying. Um

00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Chicken noodle soup

403
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,640
I think I don't put a can in the microwave

404
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,240

Oh my god it's spilling everywhere. Is this good still? Does this go? It smells like cat food

417
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:04,120
I can't tell if it says it's good until November 2nd 2023 or

418
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,840
The bit could you not eat my soup will be can you stop?

420

He'll just suck his head in the pot because will be just like jumps on the freaking stove because he wants to burn his little

00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,040
Poppins off. Let me see what you guys say. What do you want? So are you following me?

422
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
You're stalker. Just following me

423
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:41,320
Um takes long for canned soup to go bad. Maybe it because it says 25. So I'm assuming it's 2025

424
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,520
Can the microwave on Thomas what is next season say it close on over the floor

425
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,440
My clothes your clothes look really good, but they look even better on my floor

426
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Ah

427
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,480
You let your cats on the countertop, um, so funny none of my cats before boomie and fia

428
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
were ever on the countertop

429
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,560
But boomie is a menace to society and even taught reina to get up on the counter

430
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
So now reina thinks you can get up on the counter

431
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,400
But boomie and fia go up in the counter and I tried I tried for so long. I did the tin foil

432
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,760
I did the spray them of water boomie did not give a fuck

I hear like some licking in the fucking background in this bitch is eating my chicken noodle soup. Don't lick your lips

440
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,360
Why did you do this?

441
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,480
I can't trust you with anything. Booby also steals my food a lot

442
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,120
Stop you can't just eat my soup

443
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,200

You know what you did

452
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Why are you such a dork?

453
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,480

Okay, he's he's he's distracted by grooming himself

461
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240

No, you guys aren't like boomy you guys actually

Provide for me and take care of me and are sweet and give me compliments. Well boomy just fucking eats my food

465
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,720
And also tries to kill himself so often by doing stupid stuff like hot jumping on a hot stove

466
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:34,520
He's really grooming himself. He's just sitting all cutely on the floor just like oh, that was a delicious meal

467
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Our cats are fricks. No

468
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,720
No, that's rude. Don't say that. I love my cats

469
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:53,000
Boomy is just a menace sometimes, but he is my son. He's going through his terrible twos except he's a year old

470
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,400
Did you get something in your eye your eye is very winky

471
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,920

472
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,200
I turn around this motherfucker is on my counter

473
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,640
Sticking his head in the pot of soup just eating it

474
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,960
Fia will do that too Fia has stolen a chicken nugget from me before boomy's stolen fries for me

475
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,520
They like they like fries a lot. I don't know boomy has stolen my chips

476
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,520
I'll be like eating. No, what was I I was eating like

477
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,160
Like, you know, there's like nacho fries from Taco Bell like a couple months ago

478
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,080
I was eating those and I'm like sitting on my living room floor just like watching tv

479
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,200
So I don't like spill anything anywhere and if I can if I do I can just like clean it up instead of on my couch

480
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:53,160
And I'm about to stick a fry in my mouth and boomy sticks his paw into on my hand and brings it towards him and then takes a bite

481
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,600
I'm just I'm literally just with my hand in the air frozen

482
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,840
So shocked that my son just took a bite of my fry

483
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,560
And grabbed my paw to deuce my paw used his paw to grab my hand to do so

484
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,560
Madam, can we have a streamer audio when you discipline a cat boy for behaving like boomy?

485
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,680
Maybe

486
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,760
It'll just be a bunch of just like

487
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,760
Get off the counter get down and me just shaking a water bottle

488
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
He's testing it for poison

489
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
No, see I throw hands on my cats and they did that

490
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,400
See, yeah, I'm throwing I'm about to throw paws boomy. Let's fight

491
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,800
Oh, I'm coming for you. You just head butted me

492
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,520
No, stop stop seducing me

493
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Here have a toy

494
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,080
I even gave you treats this morning. Do you think you can steal my food?

495
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,640
Where's your sister

496
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Oh

497
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:25,080
He ever really likes the cat tree that you guys got likes to lay in that factory often

498
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,680
Gotta cook off boomy spit you're disgusting

499
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,560
Oh

500
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,440
Yeah, he's very cute. He's very nice when he does it too. He doesn't like use his claws or anything. He like boomy boomy

501
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,640
Likes to stretch a whole line of turn around because I thought he hopped up on the fucking counter again

502
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,880
he likes to stretch up and like, um

503
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,720
Against your leg and reach up at you and be like hi

504
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,800
and

505
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,400
He knows the difference between like if my skin is exposed if I'm wearing like shorts or if I'm wearing pants

506
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,120
Because when he when I'm wearing pants he uses his claws because he thinks it won't hurt me

507
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:18,040
But then recently I've told him that it hurts and so now he stops using his claws when he asks for uppies. Yeah

508
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
Yeah, but we ask for uppies a lot

509
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,920
And then because then he'll he also just like soft paw

510
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,600
um

511
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,960
soft paw it

512
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,560
He never would do that when I was wearing shorts non-verbal boy

513
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,160
He's not a monster

514
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,560
But just a simple menace

515
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,600
I wish my cats would stop using their claws on my bed sheets. Yeah, um, fia likes to do that

516
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,600
My cat hates me just bites me. Oh, I'm sorry

517
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,600
I

518
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,800
Like make my cats don't don't bite me unless like

519
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,560
Uh, they miss when we're playing and they accidentally like

520
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,280
Although boomie used to like bite me a lot as a kitten, but that's because he's a kitten

521
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,680
boomie's still a kitten. Yeah, you know, I'm talking about you

522
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,640
He's like right behind me. Hi

523
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,240
What do you love to you think about ways to take my soup again?

524
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,880
Oh, you're just you're scratching my carpet. It's not a scratching board, but it's fun

525
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,160
I need to clip your claws

526
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,800
They're very sharp I haven't clicked on them in a month

527
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,560
Fia destroy a bad companion

528
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,400
Okay, this is for I don't hate cats but low key fear of them

529
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,000
So if a cat approaches me I'm likely to look at the owner like what is it doing? What is it?

530
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,920
It's their action mean. Uh, yeah cats body language is a lot

531
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Harder to read than a dogs

532
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,240
Um, really you can tell how a cat is feeling by looking at how their tail is

533
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,800
similar to a dog, um

534
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,320
But like if their tail is up like a little flag that means they're like happy to see you if it's like kind of like

535
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,120
A little like medium that's like they're content if it's a little bit lower. They're just like chilling

536
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,480
But if it's like tucked almost like a dog and they're like very frightened

537
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,960
Are you biting my carpet?

538
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:26,360
I gave you a spring. Did you knock it under the freaking couch bro? Oh my god, there's like 50 spring like toy springs under my couch

539
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,600
Um, yeah, I tell a lot of gonna cat means irritation

540
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,400
They hate being stared at

541
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,320
I don't know I stare at my cats they they just like just chirp at me when I do

542
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,480
Because they like to stare at me because cats like to stare at you

543
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,080
They're not like dogs where they're like scared of eye contact and stuff. They just like to watch you

544
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:54,600
Cats wink. Yeah, they give you a little I call it little kitty kisses. I'm like, oh, did you just give me a kiss when they like slowly blink at you?

545
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,720
um

546
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,760
Yeah, they don't like yeah, you don't want to pet a cat if it shows you your spelly because for a cat and they roll over

547
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,320
Onto there. Why am I peeking?

548
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,040
What the hell

549
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,520
Bro, I'm getting pissed

550
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,320
At my microphone right now

551
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,480
I

552
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,360
Because that means they have all their weapons on display

553
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,920
That's so weird, why is my microphone doing that? I'm sorry. I'm just watching the levels

554
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,600
Start staring without blinking is an aggression thing for cats blinking is fine, but for long eye contact is so you get yeah, it's like a

555
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,560
Like dogs where they're like challenging

556
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Boomi, what are you doing?

557
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,920
Now he's under my desk. Hi big man

558
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,440

00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,080
Hello, what are you up to please don't

560
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,200
He's like, I think there's like a wrapper under my desk that he wants

561
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,320
He's just being nosy now. Okay, let me check on my soup

562
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,640
Soup time. Oh, are you following me? You can't have any mister

563
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,800
Do not pop off here or I swear to god you're gonna accidentally hurt yourself. Oh my gosh

564
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:40,440
He's looking at my soup like I'm about to feed him some food. He's like, oh

565
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
I dropped my oyster crackers

566
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,360
Can't

567
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:04,840
You want a cracker? Yeah, see it's not interesting to you like why are you trying to like get all excited over that?

568
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,000
Okay, I don't have any ginger ale but I do have um seltzer water

569
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,320
I don't have to drink soda too much

570
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,560
One of my cats like belly touches the other does oh, yeah, feel loves her belly rubs. She loves it

571
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So does rena

00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,160
Oh, it's hot. Oh, it's burn my tongue

573
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,520
Now we

574
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
Need to move my taser

575
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,480
And my taser's just on my desk

576
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Put that over here

577
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Do I have a single cat mother?

578
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Why are you shouting?

579
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,960
Hot soup is hot. She discovers the worst. Shut up. It's got taste

580
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:28,120
Be like a hood rabbit catches you and tases you

581
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,800
Because she thinks you stole her something or whatever

582
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,120
She's just scared the fuck out of you during the collab

583
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,120
Is it taser or taser it's with an s but good question

584
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,880
I'm waiting for my soup to cool, but I'm sad. I put in my little oyster crackers because now they're gonna get soggy

585
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,080
No lasers with an s

586
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,480
ASMR you still should be soup, but you are not a cat

587
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,960
A hood rabbit chases you down and tases you because she thinks you're cute. There you go

588
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Because we um

589
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,320

590
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,440

If you're a fan of me and I see your snow bunny

648
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,360
Yeah, what can I?

649
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Balhash

650
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,520
No, not baklava

651
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,600
I hope you had a good stream. I saw that in me in me. I see was playing brats

652
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:56,280
This is what happens when you give everybody the first letter of the name and then the last letter of the name the exactly same

653
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:15,000
Sipping sipping on my my seltzer water my ginger lime a seltzer water

654
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,280
and um

655
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:25,080
Yeah, straw knee she be I see in me. Yeah, I know other people do that. Like I've been called straw knee before

656
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,360
um

657
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Yeah, guys you're playing brats

658
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,960
brats

659
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,560
I remember I used to have like a little mini disc of like the brats angels that came with one of my brats dolls when I had a

660
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,520
brats doll

661
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,520
I think I had chloe and um

662
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,760
There's brats angels or brats forever. I can't remember rock angels. Yeah

663
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,360
I'm her listening to the song. I have to burp. I need to mute

664
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,800
Hi bleep my so wait, no

665
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,400
It'll work. I don't know if it worked

666
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Oh my crap, did I like not bleep it?

667
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,840
Yeah, you get you get bleeped burps. Nobody deserves my burps

668
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:14,760
The bleep was bleeping she's such a criminal

669
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:24,040
When I was in the third grade they called me a criminal why because I killed somebody

670
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:34,840
Start rating bleeps I could do morse code not that I know morse code, but I could figure it out

671
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,240
I

672
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
Choked on a noodle

673
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:56,120
I can see that behind a fit area. What do you mean? Of course mercy. She's literally the Andre

674
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,720
Did I burp I don't remember burping if I did I'm sorry

675
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,840
I

676
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,680
Nice belts bro anytime bro, huh bro fist, but I just like to shove my fist up your butt

677
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,080
affectionately

678
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,480
Yeah, but the undead I already had three what

679
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,920
On an arena stream became a lunch ASMR. I've already told you guys I like to eat with you guys

680
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,440
One because you guys encourage me to eat and I don't like eating alone

681
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,040
See without you I wouldn't have remembered that I have chicken noodle soup Campbell's chicken noodle soup in my cabinet

682
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,240
And I would have probably just kept eating applesauce

683
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
Thanks for the fist bro anytime bro

684
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,240
That's literally called a mukbang that's true

685
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:05,560
Mukbang except I'm not like shoving like an absurd amount of cheese down my throat. I'm just eating Campbell's chicken noodle soup

686
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:15,560
Yeah, then you wouldn't have the lovely clip that someone probably took of boomi taking my soup

687
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,760
I don't know what the cheese is but well, there's a lot of like cheese pulls and stuff and mukbangs

688
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,400
I couldn't watch mukbangs because then I would want to eat what the people were eating

689
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
But like obviously on a smaller scale

690
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,160
So like anytime I watch like a sushi or like a fish related mukbang

691
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,240
I would have to get like sushi

692
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,640
And I'm like this is hurting my wallet

693
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,040
Campbell's sponsor stream

694
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:58,360
If I could get any sponsor, you know, I'm who my dream sponsor is guess who I want you to guess who my dream sponsor is right now

695
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:11,480
Let me switch to a gaming

696
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,480
Tampax

697
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:39,560
Why are people saying tampa why'd you say it twice you get that'd be pretty cool. Um, no

698
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,520
It's smuckers uncrustables

699
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,280
That is my dream

700
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Strawny is my dream sponsor that too

701
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,760
If I could get smuckers uncrustables

702
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,480
Then that would be incredible. I don't know why there's not game sound

703
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,040
Let me figure that out expeditiously and put my headphones in

704
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:10,760
I want to make a PB and J because it's the novelty bro. It's the novelty

705
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,720
Okay

706
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:22,120
Imagine me on an uncrustable and I'm just like just hanging out, you know, let me put my ooo mouth on

707
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,720
Why can I only hear

708
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,960
Everything besides the game

709
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
Da da da da da da

710
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,080
Um Elden ring where for oh

711
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,160
Is that it? Yeah

712
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,160
Yeah

713
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,080
Okay, I can hear it but now you guys can't

714
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,480
Unless you guys can hear it. I don't know if you can

715
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:11,880
Devoured okay, cool. Um properties

716
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,760
Is

717
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,800
Nope

718
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,440
It will probably randomly be under music because I don't know why but it puts

719
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,480
Game audio under music on my go xlr. I should probably fix that

720
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,480
Come on play again

721
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:42,760
Hold on hold on. Hold on. I've got this. I like how I do one thing in it. Why is my mic peaking?

722
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,160
What happened? What happened to my settings from my last collab?

723
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,040
Oh

724
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,920
You heard your first second

725
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:20,920
Oh, there it is. I might turn that motherfucker down. Holy crap. Sorry

726
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,920
Sorry that game audio is gone now for a second because I need to do something in

727
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,200
YouTube studio. So I'm not so bright

728
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,520
Um, what the shibbity? Where is it? Here it is

729
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,040
There it is

730
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,760
I should have taken a picture of my go xlr settings before they got yuffed up

731
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:07,000
Cause that's poopy. That's real poopy. That's what I'm gonna say

732
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,800
Is that better? Sure. Okay

733
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,120
Uh

734
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,080
Oh scared me

735
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,480
I'm a star

736
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:49,000
I guess we actually have to play a game. I'm still sipping. I'm still sipping my poop. Hello. Hi. We started early today

737
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,040
Oh, they don't like about camel chicken noodle soup is that it's so salty

738
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,320
It's too salty for me. How am I supposed to swallow this?

739
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,600
Mmm

740
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:26,760
You'll show me what? What do you mean? I didn't say anything bad

741
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,120
I

742
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,360
Water it down. Yeah, I think I've done that before

743
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,000
I see

744
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,360
Don't ice cube in there. Well, it's it's already gone. I actually finished it

745
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,360
Which I'm surprised because again, like I said, I've been like very nauseous because of my bed, so

746
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,640
Don't worry, you'll probably fall asleep and I'll be streaming eight hours from now. So

747
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,120
Don't worry about it. You won't miss anything

748
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Crack my back

749
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,720
Time to stretch

750
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,680
Oh

751
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,360
I'm so close to popping it and I can't

752
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Just works

753
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,160
She'll be having eight hours from now after playing the game for three hours

754
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,240
Shit, but my favorite underground indie artist

755
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,520
You best you bested mogul last night. He's the first boss to give you a hard time cool

756
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,720
So you're gonna help me defeat him, right?

757
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,080
Just kidding. I'll I'll fight him

758
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,360
What did you guys say you guys wanted me to fight morgot too and uh

759
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,200
God-free

760
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,200
Okay

761
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:10,680
Cozy I'm here. I'm ready to rumble. I got my pillow pet mr. Quackerton as my little armrest

762
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,440
Need to adjust I need to bleep

763
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,840
I

764
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,440
Forgot and I can just be you I don't have to bleep it

765
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,840
No burpees for you

766
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,920
Yeah, god-free another talisman pouch

767
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,160
Uh, I also probably should get some memory stones for spells

768
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,640
Because I was doing a lot of oh my god. I need to turn out the game for me

769
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,240
That didn't work at all

770
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:54,680
There we go turns it down for me and not for you that actually works out. Um

771
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:04,040
Are you changing our normal burps because I feel I feel like I've been giving you guys too much

772
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,440
And it's time for me to withhold things

773
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:15,640
You didn't you didn't do anything. I just want to torture you so no burps for you. Um

774
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,200
Um, what was I gonna say?

775
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,720
Oh, so I was doing some research on like best

776
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:31,320
Things to do. I really watched an hour video about the top 75 best sorceries

777
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:39,720
And I'm like, okay, do I run around and grab those and I'm like, I don't think I will. Um, but

778
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,080
Going in to I like to do research. Okay for Elden Ring. It's fun

779
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,240
I like to listen to Elden Ring stuff. Um

780
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,880
Going into a mug is going to be difficult

781
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,440
One because my build he's pretty resistant to

782
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,560
So

783
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,880
Yeah, that'll be something unless I get like, uh the comment

784
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,600
I could probably get that

785
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,400
um

786
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,800
Maybe mugged mowed

787
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,480
Uh could also maybe get some frost stuff

788
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,080
I wish I had the video up because it has like a lot of good information about

789
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,000
um

790
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
The scaling and stuff for

791
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,720
the sorceries

792
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,720
erm

793
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,720
Let me see

794
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,360
I have to get a different weapon besides the moon veil

795
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,520
to fight

796
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,320
Mogue with because he is resistant to magic

797
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,240
I think like a little bit, but he's I think I'm gonna get

798
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,280
the

799
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:55,880
Either the the no the either the uji katana or the naga kaiba nakiba naga kiba

800
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,760
I can't remember the name and then do get a poison ash of war for that

801
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,800
um

802
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:10,280
Because I don't feel like although, I don't know. Do I need higher dexterity for that? I probably do

803
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,360
Brick yeah, he is weak to bleed however

804
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,960
He is he is like 20 magic resisted. I watched a video leave me alone

805
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,800
um

806
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,080
He's like resistant to everything

807
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,640
Yes, he's heavily fit obviously like he is fire resistant, but for best

808
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,960
Build

809
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,960
Yeah, he's 80 percent fire percent

810
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:53,960
20% oh, okay. I thought it was 40 percent. I can't remember whatever. All right, then we should be fine then with the moon veil

811
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,040
So I don't have to do that

812
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,040
uh, we still have to

813
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
go

814
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000

Still have to watch the most recent boys episode. I just remembered

The ending of it was nice to fly as practice. What episode are we on?

998
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:51,480
There we go

999
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:01,160
Like how like torrent doesn't go mad or anything imagine if torrent could go mad

1000
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,440
Safe in here, right?

1001
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,580
I'm trying to walk on to this instead

1002
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,480
I

1003
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,920
Coolio

01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,320
Fuck this stupid thing I'm out and I thought I was climbing with him

1005
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:39,080
It was not I like how although I'm right under it. It doesn't affect me it always confused me

1006
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:51,240
What's your foolish ambitions to rest

1007
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,400
Stop it

1008
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Enough

1009
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:14,120
Oh, it's still there. Oh, I'm gonna die. Oh, I pressed the wrong button. I feel the wrong thing

1010
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,560
I

1011
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:28,280

1015
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Oh to be a wolf with your little pack

1016
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,200
I

1017
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,680
I saw them fall off and I was like, where are they going? No

1018
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,600
It's pretty not smart to have like a statue in the middle of a road

1019
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:22,520
His faith was stronger than your backstab literally

1020
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:33,080
Hey do be do be do is I mean like all of them are respawned because I didn't kill that one

1027
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,640
This shouldn't be taking me so long. I'm really pissed at myself right now

1028
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:48,120
Do I need to lock in do I need to know if I lock in I'm just gonna make a fool of myself

01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,240
Crawling in my skin

01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,880

1137
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,760
Can't run past bike because then the fucking thing will get me and I can't do it on when I'm not on torrent

01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,800
Literally right here

1145
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,600

I

1149
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:59,560
Ask one simple question you guys could describe it on the map

1150
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:04,280
You're just going saying go left and yes while the delay is minimal. There's still a delay

1151
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:09,240

1152
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:20,040
Yeah, go that way I'm like what way I'm pointing this way I was pointing this way

1177
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:15,480

01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,840
What

1182
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:58,200
Right before the gap in the rocks before this grace there is a spirit spring

1183
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,920
Do you mean like the little teleporter shit?

1184
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,560

How am I supposed to use that to get all the way over there though? Because that's still a lot

1191
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,520
Before I even get up here

1192
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:07,480
Get up here. You know it was easier when I came out from this angle to be honest with you

1193
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,600
When I was hanging out with my homeboy with a nice fit

1194
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,720

1195
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,560

1271
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:14,800
um, I'm just too underleveled, I'm only level like, what level am I, I think I'm level like 45,

1272
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:15,360

02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:20,240

hi lady, you don't look so good, whoa, why can't I see through this pillar, that's

1275
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:37,120
kind of weird, why is it doing that, what,

1276
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:44,320
I got to walk in,

1277
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:55,200
this is OP against NPCs, I know I keep forgetting to use my ash of war on this,

1278
02:07:57,280 --> 02:08:01,360
alright let's try it, vike, where you at,

1279
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:05,760
vike,

1280
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,280
vike,

1281
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:12,480
vike,

1282
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:27,920
walk in, he, he, he, fuck, can I roll out the way, he, fuck, can I back up,

1283
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:39,360
he, why isn't working, why did it go that way, I, I, I hate this here, I hate it here, no,

1284
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:52,160
why,

1285
02:08:54,720 --> 02:09:02,160
you're so, you're do so good, why are you lying to me, why are you lying to me, don't lie to me,

1286
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:13,680
stop,

1287
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:20,560
no I just want to, I already got the grace I needed, but you already got the grace,

1288
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:28,720
you're too, you're, you're late bro, you're late, I already got the grace, I just want to try to kill him,

1289
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:35,040
it's like my, my lock is just like not working,

1290
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:41,440
can you, enough,

1291
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:52,720
she blinded me with madness, she blinded me with madness, I'm too underleveled for that,

1292
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,400
he just walks away, he's like yeah, bye bitch,

1293
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,680
you just get cooked a little bit, we can get it back,

1294
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:08,720
okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, okay, so we got what we needed there,

1295
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:12,160
what was the other, I was looking for the secret,

1296
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:27,040
he made a secret and left, okay, the restaurant, there's a church of the plague in Kailu that has it,

1297
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:36,000
and there's someone the Altus Plateau, but I won't really do that yet, because Altus

1298
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:42,000
Plateau is not really my priority right now, where the fuck is this,

1299
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:52,560
it's like right in a crooked road, no I'm not fucking, hit, here,

1300
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,680
making my way downtown,

1301
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,360
like I'm looking at a puzzle piece, where is this, is it right over here,

1302
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:13,840
walking fast, faces passing homebound,

1303
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:20,000
that probably was not the best grace to go to, what are we working towards again,

1304
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,040
I'm getting all the sacred tears, not all of them, just like a good chunk,

1305
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:29,520
I should probably look for some golden seeds while I'm at it, I should probably do that too,

1306
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:36,800
I have so many fucking tags, let me back up, so that one's three,

1307
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:42,160
I wish there was a way to just clear all my beacons,

1308
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:48,320
is that a thing, is there a toggle to do that, I highly doubt it, get rid of you,

1309
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:54,080

1312
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,280

02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:17,040
there's a one, what is one,

1314
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:21,680
sorry I like have to fix that because it's gonna bother me, so I usually follow the track,

1315
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,080
till I find it,

1316
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:34,400
where the fuck is one,

1317
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:43,200
how do I remove all, I'm gonna keep yelling at you unless you tell me,

1318
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:49,760
oh there it is, I found it,

1319
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,360
I want some ice cream, I would love some ice cream actually, I have an ice cream in like a very long

1320
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:13,120
time, great, time to figure out how to get the fuck down up, you know what, are you serious,

1321
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:25,760
that's so fucking stupid in it,

1322
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:30,720
anyways,

1323
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:38,480
you're telling me that that hurts me, that is the dumbest shit I've ever seen,

1324
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:56,320
oh yeah, cry, cry, cry, I was about to say if I fucking die from this I'm gonna actually fight

1325
02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:05,760
um, Kaelin, wow, did not know I was here, um, oh fuck, oh I'm fine,

1326
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:09,200
anyways,

1327
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,120
what is rising behind me, skeleton boys,

1328
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:26,320
alright, let me just run over this and there's one in here, oh these motherfuckers, yeah no,

1329
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:41,280
we're not doing that today, oh hey, it's you, um, I'm sorry but I'm not interested into what you

1330
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:51,760
have to sell, oh come on bro, I don't, I don't have time for this, just leave me, you fucking house

1331
02:14:51,760 --> 02:15:08,720

1332
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:18,560
literally about to die, you get crushed like a bug, alright,

1333
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:28,960
yeah why don't you hug him with your little doofy ass hats, um, you don't look too good,

1334
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:33,840
she's probably fine right,

1335
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:45,040
handing out ice cream in the chat, you have to save her, she's hot, I don't feel like doing her quest,

1336
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:53,040
she's like breathing so heavily in my fucking ears,

1337
02:15:53,040 --> 02:16:01,360
um, alright, let's look for golden seeds,

1338
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:39,680
okay, uh, frick, damn, there's so many, oh,

1339
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:51,040

02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:51,120
oh I think I already grabbed that, yeah I did, okay,

1345
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,040
there's one in the cellio town of sorcery under a phantom tree in the northern section of town,

1346
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:09,120
okay, let's go talk to invisible people, we love to see you, yeah,

1347
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:17,840

1348
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:27,120
that ship, I don't know, I've never been able to, um, what is happening, what is, what is happening,

1349
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:33,040
what's happening, what is happening to my stick, why isn't it moving,

1350
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:40,960
the fuck, that was a weird ass glitch, anyways, um, I'm right next to the cellio town of sorcery,

1351
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:50,800
it's like right over here, it's like, like up here, here, all right, let's go talk to these bitches,

1352
02:18:57,440 --> 02:19:02,240
damn it, oh I see it, oh there's a way for me to get down, nice,

1353
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:11,440
nice, something behind me,

1354
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:22,640
oh

1355
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:26,640
comical typing,

1356
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:36,640
oh thank god there's a grace right here,

1357
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:53,760
I'm so close to death, no, I meant to sit down, Jesus Christ, don't you hate when just like balls

1358
02:19:53,760 --> 02:20:01,600
just like go to your face, just sucks, um, okay, this is the tree, it was like literally over there,

1359
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:04,800
oh

1360
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:13,440
are you shitting me right now, what do you have to say about this,

1361
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:16,800
oh it's because I went the back way,

1362
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:21,520
damn I have to go around,

1363
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:29,120
I hear people creepily making noises on the other side, oh it's that,

1364
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:36,000
oh, um, I'm fine,

1365
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:39,840
yeah I'm fine,

1366
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:46,320
nice, uh cool, I totally just,

1367
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:53,600
cool, yeah, nice, cool,

1368
02:20:54,560 --> 02:21:03,440
what a beautiful town, really, look how, how gorgeous it is, it's so empty,

1369
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:10,080
can't believe nobody lives in this gorgeous, beautiful town, I kind of want to drop down on this

1370
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:11,840
thing, yeah,

1371
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:18,800
yeah, uh, oh quick teleport,

1372
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:23,040
I don't want to accidentally aggro people when I can't get out,

1373
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,400
I got a bullet, I'm scared, I'm so sorry,

1374
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:36,160
you live there, I'm so sorry that you do, um, okay, cool, we got that,

1375
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:39,120
uh,

1376
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:50,560
one can be, did I get that one near red main,

1377
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,200
I mean I think I did, I think, did I,

1378
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:07,600
I'm sorry, I wanted to do these ones, um, oh yeah, no I definitely talked to him,

1379
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:14,160
um, so I definitely probably grabbed that one, question mark, let me just sit down,

1380
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:27,280
I need three golden seeds,

1381
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:35,440
uh, I think I already grabbed that one, am I winning, that's debatable,

1382
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:43,040
there's also the pewter tree spirit, but I don't feel like doing that, um,

1383
02:22:44,480 --> 02:23:00,960
okay, let's go to limb grave, because I haven't, I haven't gone to limb grave,

1384
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:04,000
I also haven't gone to fort height,

1385
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:13,600
yeah, there's fort height, there's the starfall center, uh,

1386
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:19,600
fort height is over here, it is,

1387
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:30,560
it was really interesting, my first playthrough,

1388
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:37,680
um, I had a weird glitch that live never spawned,

1389
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:43,760
and I didn't do anything, like it's like I literally was like playing the game

1390
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:50,720
as linearly as it can get, and you could hear Blythe like howl and shit or whatever the

1391
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:56,160
fuck noise he makes, but then I never saw him, he never, and he's like, you know he's like at

1392
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:02,400
the top of that thing or whatever, I had to restart my game so I could talk to him,

1393
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:06,960
I didn't, well I just made another game, I just, because I was just like, what the fuck, it was

1394
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:16,480
really weird, uh, yeah the whistle never worked, yeah because you have to get the whistle so he

1395
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:26,000
shows up, yeah it never worked, he just glitched and never showed, hi, I don't feel like talking to you,

1396
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,200
um, not that I have any money to buy shit,

1397
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:44,560
hey, how's it going,

1398
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:52,720
how's it going everyone, I don't mind if I grab that real quick, oh I gotta go,

1399
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:56,640
it's been cool, nice seeing you all, it's been a really long time,

1400
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:01,360
glad to see you guys are all in good spirits, love that for you,

1401
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:15,760
yeah, oh yeah there's just a thingy, um, I still, okay I'm not, uh, where is the other one,

1402
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,640
yeah I was really annoying,

1403
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:25,760
let me find the sleeping peninsula,

1404
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,440
fuck, did I get that one, I can't recall,

1405
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:40,240
I don't think I did, again I've literally just been bouncing around places so I probably haven't

1406
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:52,000
gone to places, oh, okay maybe I did, we'll just see,

1407
02:25:52,160 --> 02:26:10,000
so literally like right here, let's see if I

1408
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:15,760
got that one because I can't recall if I did,

1409
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,880
isn't there like a giant here,

1410
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:32,960
yeah, there it is, I don't think I grabbed it because of the giant,

1411
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,440
um, yeah there it is,

1412
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:45,360
I think I was more distracted by the giant, yep,

1413
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:50,560
let her go towards, good job, make it down, thank you,

1414
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:59,280
that's a close one, yikes, um, so aggro, I can't get out of here,

1415
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:07,920
yippee, let me just get rid of that marker, I can't get rid of the marker, let's just float,

1416
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:09,760
run at the marker,

1417
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:19,600
whoa, we're gonna kill this giant,

1418
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:36,880
get him, hurry before he shoots the ground,

1419
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:40,880
yeah,

1420
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:46,400
ow,

1421
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:56,160
yeah, what, I thought I jumped, I'm just not jumping, at least you're not doing that much

1422
02:27:56,160 --> 02:28:04,960
damage to me, that's cool, um, thanks, I'm sure you can have your bow, that'd be nice, arm,

1423
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:08,560
arm, what's up here again, how are we gonna,

1424
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:21,360
aw, thank you,

1425
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,040
your sheepee tax, that's cute, thank you, thank you for the tip,

1426
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:35,600
um, when you guys are useless, just start paying me money, that's sad,

1427
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:44,720
okay, I got that, wait, why don't I, I just forget to do things,

1428
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:57,440
tutorial island, that's a good way of putting it,

1429
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:08,160
cool, nice, okay, so we got the riot,

1430
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:11,600
um,

1431
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:22,400
if I kill Kenneth height, I can get one,

1432
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:31,120
I didn't know I could kill Kenneth height for a fucking thing,

1433
02:29:38,480 --> 02:29:40,640
so,

1434
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:06,080
if you kill him, he gives you a golden seed,

1435
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:13,920
Kenneth did nothing wrong, you can max it out without killing him, I never knew that,

1436
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:24,720
because I completed his quest before, and I know I could kill him, I just would have,

1437
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:29,600
learning of the gains,

1438
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:40,480
damn, there's one in the carry a manor, I do love carry a manor, it's one of my favorite levels

1439
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:53,360
to clear, there's one in oxtella, there's one in sofra, lindel, yeah, two can be found

1440
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:57,120
underneath the phantom tree inside the western gate, capillel skirts,

1441
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:15,680
he's gonna steal her to stormville castle when you steal her elven line,

1442
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:20,720
I think completing this quest along with the water, yeah, nepheli, whatever,

1443
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:28,640
you max upgrade, yeah, I did that before, okay, there's really nothing else I could grab

1444
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:35,760
without having to defeat bosses, because there's also a tree spirit in the pharynx roll

1445
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:42,240
heroes grave, and I do have the key to get into that, and there's also the putrid spirit boss

1446
02:31:42,240 --> 02:31:49,360
at the end of the war dead catacombs, so that would be two, but that's not really my goal right

1447
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:54,000
now, my goal is just because I would rather be leveled so I can just fuck everybody up

1448
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,760
and then get those later, so now

1449
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:06,800
I'm thinking we go get that mimic tear, I think, I think it's time

1450
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:13,840
the base talisman, what's the base talisman,

1451
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:21,520
I did clear the pharynx roll heroes grave, I just don't remember the name of shit,

1452
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:24,960
I just don't remember the name of shit,

1453
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:42,000
where's the lady with the fingers, where's the finger lady, I'm gonna finger her so fucking hard,

1454
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:50,880
what does the earth treats favor do, I forget, hey

1455
02:32:57,120 --> 02:32:59,760
you think I'm cute, you have some interesting toes

1456
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:11,360
I hate them so much, they're so fucking gross okay,

1457
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:19,760
just some random eldritch, they're not even like part of something,

1458
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:25,280
they're not like part of a big hand, or they are part of a big hand, and the hand talks to her,

1459
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:30,640
and it's because of the outer lords, where's your head, oh yeah I don't care,

1460
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:34,400

02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:13,200
the two fingers and three fingers make a hand, why, I don't know,

1493
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:19,840
yeah because Ronnie likes the three fingers, they like the two fingers and they together make a hand,

1496
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:37,760
and then those are the three fingers, they're so gross, I hate them so much, um Ronnie likes the three fingers,

1497

1631
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:25,120
you guys are telling me the names of things, magic, shrouding, underwear,

1632
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:32,960

1635
02:55:03,280 --> 02:55:08,720
probably this one for it, what was I saying, oh, um,

1636
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:16,640

1637
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:26,720
all right, I'll wait before I move forward, do I go to the left or do I go to the right,

1638
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:38,400
I was sure, I was sure I was dead, I just like, there's like a random like thing right there,

1639
02:55:38,400 --> 02:55:47,440
I wonder if that's what the thing says, left, okay, thank you, let me heal, that would be smart

1640
02:55:47,440 --> 02:55:55,600
of me, I do like this, the flask of the, of what I have in this because it gives me like a little

1642
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:14,480

1656
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:19,680
game is to choose your own collectathon, that's a way to put it, I suppose,

1657
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:31,040
uh, yeah, yeah, let me not fall off the cliff, we're falling off cliff, it's fine,

1659
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:55,360

1693
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:21,520
who's shooting me, oh,

1694
03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:29,120
it's his butterfly wound, his butt is scratched,

1695
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:38,960
it's fine, I can't really see that well,

1696
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:47,920
oh, one disappeared, can I, I don't know why it, it's all over to me over there,

1697
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:59,280
I'm just, it's there for something, literally, all right, let's go back to where we were,

1698
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:17,120
bro had some aim, he did, I have a big wedgie, hold on, my fucking shorts,

1699
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:25,840
where the arrow is big enough, I don't think they were, because they didn't kill me,

1700
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:40,240
hey, how you doing, here, I'm just gonna aggro only you, so I don't have to deal with your boys

1701
03:04:40,240 --> 03:04:50,480
again, can you come over here, perfect, you don't have a face,

1702
03:04:50,480 --> 03:04:57,920
what's up with that, why don't you have a face bro,

1703
03:05:08,960 --> 03:05:10,320
yeah, I totally timed that wrong,

1704
03:05:10,320 --> 03:05:16,000
no,

1705
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:31,920
I don't think this lock is annoying, I feel like my camera isn't doing well,

1706
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:38,560
yeah, yeah, oh you killed me, what the hell, I was not paying attention to my health,

1707
03:05:41,360 --> 03:05:45,040
where did Muppet Chibi go, oh did you, do you miss Muppet Chibi,

1708
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:52,080
I don't know why I'm losing at the fucking, I should have taken five seconds, I hate it when

1709
03:05:52,080 --> 03:05:56,480
I like, it's always my first attempt, I beat, like I'm so close to beating a boss,

1710
03:05:56,800 --> 03:06:03,040
but then I just choke the next 50 times, I don't know why that is, but it's a thing,

1711
03:06:03,680 --> 03:06:09,840
this happens to me, I think because I overthink it, it's the chibi syndrome,

1712
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:15,760
I don't like the name of that, it's the souls game, I prefer the souls game effect,

1713
03:06:16,720 --> 03:06:19,120
rather than the chibi syndrome,

1714
03:06:25,360 --> 03:06:30,240
I creep up, I think you saw me,

1715
03:06:33,120 --> 03:06:36,160
you think you saw, oh there's a fucking tower in the background, I didn't notice,

1716
03:06:46,080 --> 03:06:47,760
oh,

03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:00,880

1718
03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:10,960

1775
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:41,680
if someone says how much money to do anything, I'm going to just say the same amount, sorry,

1776
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:47,520

03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:53,040

1788
03:17:54,000 --> 03:18:02,880
stab, stab, stab, stab,

1789
03:18:02,880 --> 03:18:06,880

1790
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:16,880
I'm gonna fall off the fucking cliff again,

1791
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:26,720
no, it's fine,

1792
03:18:27,120 --> 03:18:36,560

1793
03:18:41,280 --> 03:18:48,560
you like get stunned or something, like what the fuck is wrong with you,

1794
03:18:48,880 --> 03:18:56,720
why do you keep doing this, I don't,

1795
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:02,400
I'm literally trying to fucking dodge,

1796
03:19:02,960 --> 03:19:06,240
can we not die,

1797
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:10,240

03:19:10,240 --> 03:19:14,240

1800
03:19:24,240 --> 03:19:28,240
thank you,

1801
03:19:32,880 --> 03:19:39,600
no, damn you, it gives you a lot of tears, um, anyways,

1802
03:19:42,720 --> 03:19:47,120
that took way too fucking long, first try everybody, first try, I should have been the

1803
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:50,240
first try, again, I almost always kill shit in the first try,

1804
03:19:50,640 --> 03:19:58,080
actually you know where I'm gonna go,

1805
03:19:58,080 --> 03:20:03,840
yeah, yeah, also when I play Elden Ring, I just get distracted and I need to get

1806
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:12,000
shit done, GV syndrome strong, zero deaths, I feel like watching a zero death Elden Ring run,

1807
03:20:12,480 --> 03:20:14,960
ah, EG,

1808
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:29,920
oh, I did it,

1809
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:34,160
now we're at five,

1810
03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:45,120
okay,

1811
03:20:52,080 --> 03:20:53,120
fuck,

1812
03:20:53,360 --> 03:21:00,080
because I like, oh, I don't,

1813
03:21:06,800 --> 03:21:11,440
wait, did I just do that, I just do that correctly, no, I don't,

1814
03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:18,640
lies of PTSD, lies of P wasn't even bad compared to Elden Ring, it's really not,

1815
03:21:18,960 --> 03:21:23,600
yeah, it's really not,

1816
03:21:27,440 --> 03:21:31,600
it's also, I liked lies of P because I think I liked how linear it was,

1817
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:33,440
now everything loops back around pretty easily,

1818
03:21:37,280 --> 03:21:44,640
I want sheepies to moonvail me, moonvail you anytime baby girl, my baby doll,

1819
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:47,920
that's where I missed all the time, you guys baby doll, all right,

1820
03:21:50,400 --> 03:21:56,240

03:22:05,840 --> 03:22:09,520
yeah, was it, is today the last day of the steam sale, steam sale,

1822
03:22:10,320 --> 03:22:11,120
you guys know what I mean,

1823
03:22:18,080 --> 03:22:21,040
probably didn't either, I'm probably going to see if I just ran straight, but I'm stupid,

1824
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:26,080
so you never know, alerted, alerted, oh, it's a fucking bear,

1825
03:22:32,080 --> 03:22:34,880
I just like to see stuff, I just like to grab stuff that close,

1826
03:22:40,400 --> 03:22:44,160

1829
03:22:56,160 --> 03:22:57,120
jangering it,

1830
03:23:00,480 --> 03:23:02,240
it ended five or four hours ago, okay,

1831
03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:10,080
yeah, we're going to jump off this cliff, let's fucking do it,

1832
03:23:13,120 --> 03:23:19,280
it's a message today, oh, something incredible, you guys ready,

1833
03:23:19,760 --> 03:23:34,880
I didn't want to jump off the cliff, it was impulsive, I knew I was going to die,

1834
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:35,920
I just really wanted to do it,

1835
03:23:36,480 --> 03:23:44,160
zero deaths, zero deaths, zero deaths,

1836
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:53,280
and call the void is strong, right, you just want to throw yourself into it,

1837
03:23:53,280 --> 03:24:04,480
am I going to grab my little, my little runes that I left behind,

1838
03:24:05,840 --> 03:24:08,880
I need to grab my little runes, where is it,

1839
03:24:11,440 --> 03:24:17,440
why can't I, why is discord telling me to DM people, you just added this person as a friend,

1840
03:24:17,440 --> 03:24:22,080
you should DM them, I don't, I was like, that should just be circumvented from when I actually

1841
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:30,160
have a call with them, every game we're just going to have to jump off a cliff,

1842
03:24:32,880 --> 03:24:39,280
a 4,000 wow, all right, I forgot how to get down here, let me just,

1843
03:24:40,160 --> 03:24:56,400
may call me itchy,

1844
03:24:56,400 --> 03:25:25,060
So pretty, wow, wow, oh, there it is, the stream chat froze.

1845
03:25:25,060 --> 03:25:28,380
What do you expect me to do about that?

1846
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:34,900
I don't know what to tell you, brother.

1847
03:25:34,900 --> 03:25:40,380
I don't know what to tell you, you guys broke my chat.

1848
03:25:40,380 --> 03:25:42,580
What am I supposed to do?

1849
03:25:42,580 --> 03:25:53,620
How could you do this?

1850
03:25:53,620 --> 03:26:04,260
Oh my god, it's gone, you destroyed it, I fixed it, it's fine.

1851
03:26:04,260 --> 03:26:12,740
I can't believe you've done this, you guys really wanted to read what you were saying.

1852
03:26:12,740 --> 03:26:18,420
Don't forget, everything when I play video games is your fault.

1853
03:26:18,420 --> 03:26:22,020
I'm just gonna, yeah, this is fine, isn't it?

1854
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:23,020
Don't die.

1855
03:26:23,020 --> 03:26:33,660
Cool, nice, cool, nice, cool, nice, cool, what the fuck are people falling off over

1856
03:26:33,660 --> 03:26:34,660
here before?

1857
03:26:34,660 --> 03:26:38,780
I don't want to see what this person did.

1858
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:46,340
Girl, why are you pissing so loud, Reina's just about, oh, they just, what do they think

1859
03:26:46,340 --> 03:26:49,340
they were gonna do?

1860
03:26:49,340 --> 03:26:59,340
Reina is pissing in that little box, alright, is this the only way to go?

1861
03:26:59,340 --> 03:27:12,180
Alright, chicken, no jumping ahead, underground required ahead, yeah, no shit, try jumping,

1862
03:27:12,180 --> 03:27:17,100
it says no jumping, try jumping.

1863
03:27:18,100 --> 03:27:31,700
Funny, like, how would anyone make that jump is so funny to me.

1864
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:45,420
That's Reina, she'd be pissing, there's so much fog, what does it say?

1865
03:27:46,420 --> 03:27:54,220
You're not wrong, oh shit, jumping off required ahead, down, we're going down, down, in an

1866
03:27:54,220 --> 03:28:04,940
early year round, why are you, do you bring me to the bathroom?

1867
03:28:04,940 --> 03:28:09,740
Are you just like standing or sitting right now, just like pissing with me and your hand

1868
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:10,740
on your phone?

1869
03:28:10,740 --> 03:28:15,260
That's crazy, can't believe you, which way do I go?

1870
03:28:15,700 --> 03:28:26,260
Not this way, that's for sure, I don't believe it's that way, definitely this way, oh, I

1871
03:28:26,260 --> 03:28:37,700
made it, I'm a platformer, bye Torrent, thank you for the lift, okay, alright, there's bitches

1872
03:28:37,700 --> 03:28:46,260
down there, I know there'll be bitches.

1873
03:28:46,260 --> 03:28:53,220
So, Sofra is my favorite area, and my least favorite area at the same time, it's my favorite

1874
03:28:53,220 --> 03:29:02,820
area because of how gorgeous it is that in Noskilla, whatever it's called, you know,

1875
03:29:02,820 --> 03:29:18,900
I should probably get a lantern, it's too late now, it's too late now, oh look, pick

03:29:18,900 --> 03:29:28,180
one up right here, can't I, I don't even have a torch, it's fine, should have gotten like

1877
03:29:28,180 --> 03:29:48,460

1878
03:29:48,460 --> 03:30:06,220

1886
03:31:16,700 --> 03:31:22,540

1887
03:31:22,540 --> 03:31:28,180
couldn't handle wolf quest, but it just, you know, it is what it is, what was my crouching

1888
03:31:28,180 --> 03:31:41,700
ahead, what, oh I get it, probably really shouldn't, oh heal until I need to, what are you doing

1893
03:32:32,140 --> 03:32:40,620
game, you're gonna have to give me a moment, give me a moment, give me just a moment, I know I

1894
03:32:40,620 --> 03:32:45,660
don't have to kill them because I'm just usually just speedrunning, but I just really wanted to,

1895
03:32:45,660 --> 03:32:50,180
you know, there's a guy behind me, I know that much, it's a nascent butterfly, get away,

1898
03:33:15,740 --> 03:33:18,860
I don't know why this is happening, I think it's just like loading on all the fucking asses,

1899
03:33:20,140 --> 03:33:31,180
oh, they're fucking superhero landed, alert, I will tarnish, you can pause it, but no, I don't

why is everybody mad that I killed a naked version of myself,

1957
03:42:08,140 --> 03:42:28,220
all right, I recall, if I, if I can recall correctly, the mimic tear is somewhere

1958
03:42:29,340 --> 03:42:35,660
in that castle place and it's guarded by two ladies, I'm probably totally wrong,

1959
03:42:38,300 --> 03:42:44,380
I'm gonna kill, why are there birds down here, to make that make sense, that's my question,

Rena, it's very hard to do this with you in my lap,

1964

I have a stone key, so that's fine, I don't know, guys, I don't remember,

1965
03:43:27,100 --> 03:43:31,340

1974
03:44:50,140 --> 03:44:52,140
okay, I need to like,

1975
03:45:00,860 --> 03:45:10,620
I'm giving you another chance, walk forward five paces, one, two, three, four, five,

1976
03:45:11,420 --> 03:45:13,340
that's kind of a, let's do that, oh what's this,

1977
03:45:24,620 --> 03:45:25,820
I jumped out here,

1978
03:45:34,460 --> 03:45:37,340
you guys don't even know where the fuck I'm going, oh my god, great,

1979
03:45:41,420 --> 03:45:47,180
walk away until you find, you guys are just terrible at describing things, that's what I've learned,

1980
03:45:51,020 --> 03:45:53,660
can I, I can't use torrent on here, can I, oh I can, sorry,

1981
03:45:54,940 --> 03:46:01,980
so get down off the bridge safely, and hug the left of the forest, okay, hello little deer,

1982
03:46:02,380 --> 03:46:09,180
hug the left of the forest, right now you're falling off,

1983
03:46:14,780 --> 03:46:22,140
left of the forest, left, oh shit, left of the forest, staying on the left of the forest,

1984
03:46:24,060 --> 03:46:31,500
the left of the, oh that worked, the left of the forest, oh yeah, there's a fucking dog around here,

1985
03:46:31,500 --> 03:46:42,700
I just remembered, is it over here, oh give me that, okay I'm at the grace,

1986
03:46:45,260 --> 03:46:52,540
there's people looking at me, I don't like how they're reaching out, explain that, now it's parkour,

1987
03:46:54,380 --> 03:46:57,820
from here you get to platform, all right,

1988
03:47:02,140 --> 03:47:09,980
looks like somebody died, not me though, I don't die,

1989
03:47:16,380 --> 03:47:21,820
hardcore parkour, can I just jump off onto that guy, that'd be nice,

1990
03:47:22,780 --> 03:47:29,100
all righty, all righty, all righty, I feel like I already fucked up, no I didn't, you,

1991
03:47:32,540 --> 03:47:38,300
maybe, I mean to be fair you did charge a horse off of a ledge onto your rooftop,

1992
03:47:39,180 --> 03:47:43,340
so find a path that deviates toward the left and parkour left with some nipple chimneys

1993
03:47:43,340 --> 03:47:48,140
onto a lower area, I like the description, some nipple chimneys, how do I fucking,

1994
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:57,740
go back, go right, oh you're right, yep, yep, yep, uh huh, yes, oh it's all coming back to me now,

1995
03:47:58,300 --> 03:48:02,380

2000
03:48:41,420 --> 03:48:44,620

2001
03:48:44,620 --> 03:48:53,740
dead dude, two human shaped mimics on this area, yep, yes this is the path forward or left and

2002
03:48:53,740 --> 03:49:01,420
below are the boob chimneys, go straight where the mimic is, okay that's what I thought, booby chimneys,

2003
03:49:02,380 --> 03:49:06,380

booby chimneys, straight, alrighty,

2009

03:55:57,180 --> 03:56:02,460
could just drop down to, that was funny,

yeah mandatory if you summon mimic you didn't beat the game, that's so stupid,

2067
03:57:24,460 --> 03:57:25,900
yeah I should probably get a lantern,

2068
03:57:26,700 --> 03:57:34,220
where are the lanterns, can I, I can buy it from uh, what's this face, can I,

2069
03:57:36,460 --> 03:57:37,580
oh that's not what I wanted,

2070
03:57:45,580 --> 03:57:46,460
what the fuck am I doing,

2071
03:57:55,900 --> 03:58:07,740
it's a merchant in South Eler Eurnia, it's not, I thought Ella had it,

2072
03:58:08,620 --> 03:58:10,940
I mean, what the fuck this dude's name is,

2073
03:58:15,420 --> 03:58:17,260
no, oh he has a torch, that's what he has,

2074
03:58:18,220 --> 03:58:21,020
I can use a telescope,

2075
03:58:29,420 --> 03:58:31,660
get a cool chain quaff,

2076
03:58:35,900 --> 03:58:36,380
for now,

2077
03:58:36,860 --> 03:58:48,220
uh, South Eurnia,

2078
03:58:56,860 --> 03:59:04,220
if you use any other weapon than dagger or use any armor you cheat,

2079
03:59:07,100 --> 03:59:10,300
it's the isolated merchant, I thought you said it was Eurnia,

2080
03:59:14,380 --> 03:59:21,900
because is it the dude over here, no, is it the dude over here, where,

2081
03:59:32,540 --> 03:59:33,500
where do I go,

2082
03:59:37,260 --> 03:59:41,980
bottom left island, over here,

2083
03:59:44,620 --> 03:59:46,220
in the, where the dragon shit is,

2084
03:59:48,860 --> 03:59:50,300
that left shirt, what,

2085
03:59:53,820 --> 03:59:55,420
left side, oh so over here,

2086
04:00:01,020 --> 04:00:04,860
you guys are giving me multiple things, you're giving me Eler Eurnia and you're giving me

2087
04:00:05,660 --> 04:00:06,540
even peninsula,

2088
04:00:14,780 --> 04:00:18,940
I'll have to start calling on you and be like you there, you tell me where to go,

2089
04:00:18,940 --> 04:00:22,140
because everybody else is, then I'll give it to somebody else another turn,

2090
04:00:29,980 --> 04:00:30,460
hello,

2091
04:00:35,660 --> 04:00:44,220
I remember trying to fight this like one dude forever on the beach,

2092
04:00:45,980 --> 04:00:46,940
I don't know who it was,

2093
04:00:54,940 --> 04:00:56,860
all the beach south, I'm going north,

2094
04:01:01,420 --> 04:01:03,660
other direction, I did it,

2095
04:01:05,420 --> 04:01:07,740
maybe I like to do things the hard way,

2096
04:01:08,940 --> 04:01:12,940
look at these guys, they're just, they're just hanging out,

2097
04:01:14,060 --> 04:01:17,820
they're just doing guy things, they're literally just like,

2098
04:01:17,820 --> 04:01:20,860
why are there so many of them by the beach, I always wondered that,

2099
04:01:20,860 --> 04:01:25,340
is this just so you could practice like giant crowd spells or attacks,

2100
04:01:26,620 --> 04:01:30,300
maybe, I don't know, it's a casual beach party,

2101
04:01:31,260 --> 04:01:32,780
let's go to the beach,

2102
04:01:32,780 --> 04:01:35,260
beach, Ninky Minjaj,

2103
04:01:39,020 --> 04:01:43,900
oh hey, isn't this what the shrimp guy is, the prawn guy, the shrimp prawn guy too,

2104
04:01:53,260 --> 04:01:55,580
bye, you have a nice outfit,

2105
04:01:55,580 --> 04:02:01,020
do you cover your face completely,

2106
04:02:03,820 --> 04:02:07,660
at the end of the day, I would like to buy one lantern,

2107
04:02:09,500 --> 04:02:12,860
one moment, just give me a second, I swear I have money,

2108
04:02:13,740 --> 04:02:15,580
I'm sorry my card's not working,

2109
04:02:17,820 --> 04:02:22,060
it's gonna work in just a second, I swear to god,

2110
04:02:25,820 --> 04:02:28,300
give me, give me a moment,

2111
04:02:31,580 --> 04:02:34,380
I should have done that one, I should have done that one,

2112
04:02:39,180 --> 04:02:44,300
2,500, how much was it,

2113
04:02:48,540 --> 04:02:52,620
what was it, I think it was 1,800, I already forgot,

2114
04:02:55,580 --> 04:03:09,020
we're gonna, we'll leave him a tip, you know, we'll leave him,

2115
04:03:09,020 --> 04:03:12,220
fuck, we'll leave him a tip, sorry, I'm trying to talk to you,

2116
04:03:13,660 --> 04:03:16,380
yeah, sorry I'm like making you look over your shoulder,

2117
04:03:16,380 --> 04:03:18,780
what,

2118
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:27,180
those ashes of, oh, the Zwei Handar, colossal sword,

2119
04:03:27,180 --> 04:03:31,900
sacrificial twig, what you guys are except it's sacrificial twink,

2120
04:03:46,380 --> 04:04:01,900
yeah, you know, you got your lantern, I should probably put that to someplace else,

2121
04:04:16,380 --> 04:04:30,700
2,000, magnificent weapon,

2122
04:04:34,620 --> 04:04:37,340
all right, so we got the Mimic Tear,

2123
04:04:37,580 --> 04:04:46,460
I don't have a lot of glove wart, I think I only have like,

2124
04:04:50,460 --> 04:04:55,580
why, I hate that sometimes I like to mark it, life is robots,

2125
04:04:59,500 --> 04:05:03,340
is Roderica doing shit now, no, she's just being weird, can you like,

2126
04:05:07,500 --> 04:05:12,860
oh, sorry, we have to talk to fucking Master Hugue, damn it, I'm going the wrong way,

2127
04:05:16,940 --> 04:05:21,980
Hugue, Hugue, balls, I'm going the wrong way, I told you guys, I just get lost,

2128
04:05:24,780 --> 04:05:30,300
Hugue, that's the two fingers, you spin me right around,

2129
04:05:31,260 --> 04:05:39,260
baby right around, Hugue, what's in here, oh it's Fia, Fia, hi Fia,

2130
04:05:47,820 --> 04:05:51,260
hi,

2131
04:06:01,180 --> 04:06:14,540
here's the homie, here's question line next for Nagakiba and the

2132
04:06:15,180 --> 04:06:23,260
anti-mogue bullshit crystal, yes, you're right, I want to hug Fia but she debuffs me,

2133
04:06:25,500 --> 04:06:28,460
I forget, how do you get, doesn't she give you something to get rid of the debuff,

2134
04:06:31,020 --> 04:06:36,940
I forget, the blessing, okay,

2135
04:06:42,620 --> 04:06:43,420
I sort of way,

2136
04:06:47,500 --> 04:06:53,260
Fia, oh, the lovely hug,

2137
04:06:54,140 --> 04:06:59,340
I'm in a cold suit of armor but thank you,

2138
04:07:04,620 --> 04:07:05,660
what is a bald again,

2139
04:07:06,620 --> 04:07:17,660
you take me in your pants,

2140
04:07:20,780 --> 04:07:25,660
no, I didn't want to go, why is everybody so weirdly fucking proportioned,

2141
04:07:30,380 --> 04:07:33,660
besides our own character, our heads are so small,

2142
04:07:35,660 --> 04:07:37,660
oh,

2143
04:07:51,420 --> 04:07:55,980
call me dear, yeah, yeah, yeah,

2144
04:07:56,860 --> 04:07:57,980
you're on the top,

2145
04:08:05,500 --> 04:08:09,100
my second never wants to repeat the fraction I was going over here,

2146
04:08:12,300 --> 04:08:14,780
oh, I'm not dead, Rodriguez,

2147
04:08:19,580 --> 04:08:24,300
I love their like friendship, like his fatherly affection for her, it's very sweet,

2148
04:08:25,980 --> 04:08:28,980
Why do you have chains on your legs?

2149
04:08:28,980 --> 04:08:30,980
It's like, why are you so ugly?

2150
04:08:30,980 --> 04:08:37,980
You know, just ask people why they have chains on their legs and why they're ugly.

2151
04:08:37,980 --> 04:08:40,980
I'm going to kill this guy, because I feel like it.

2152
04:08:40,980 --> 04:08:43,980
Oh, I got a new member.

2153
04:08:43,980 --> 04:08:46,980
Welcome. Welcome to the harem.

2154
04:08:46,980 --> 04:08:54,980
Are there any details to pay attention to the forces of our life at this time?

2155
04:08:55,980 --> 04:08:57,980
You guys are the real one.

2156
04:09:03,980 --> 04:09:05,980
Oh, nice.

2157
04:09:05,980 --> 04:09:07,980
I got one of those.

2158
04:09:07,980 --> 04:09:11,980
Isn't that like late game? I forget.

2159
04:09:11,980 --> 04:09:15,980
Ugh, weird.

2160
04:09:15,980 --> 04:09:18,980
I got that boom boom pow.

2161
04:09:19,980 --> 04:09:24,980
Oh, we're both going to kill each other?

2162
04:09:24,980 --> 04:09:26,980
Yeah.

2163
04:09:34,980 --> 04:09:36,980
Stop.

2164
04:09:36,980 --> 04:09:38,980
Don't heal again, you motherfucker.

2165
04:09:38,980 --> 04:09:40,980
I have frostbite.

2166
04:09:42,980 --> 04:09:43,980
Stop it.

2167
04:09:43,980 --> 04:09:45,980
No, you don't get to kill me.

2168
04:09:49,980 --> 04:09:54,980
No.

2169
04:09:54,980 --> 04:09:56,980
What?

2170
04:10:18,980 --> 04:10:33,980
I threw my controller across the room. I don't know if you guys hear it, heard it.

2171
04:10:33,980 --> 04:10:53,980
No, I think it kind of just like rolled over my couch to be honest with you, then plopped on the ground.

2172
04:10:53,980 --> 04:10:57,980
Looks like we have a new throne entry.

2173
04:10:57,980 --> 04:11:01,980
No, I need to add, what's it called?

2174
04:11:01,980 --> 04:11:06,980
Am I throne? I usually get new joy cons because I have six drifts.

2175
04:11:06,980 --> 04:11:11,980
I'm going to go grab my controller.

2176
04:11:28,980 --> 04:11:30,980
Thank you.

2177
04:11:33,980 --> 04:11:36,980
Oh, are you taking care of this one?

2178
04:11:43,980 --> 04:11:46,980
Okay, a little ruffle of your process.

2179
04:11:46,980 --> 04:11:48,980
Alright, where'd it go?

2180
04:11:48,980 --> 04:11:50,980
Oh, over here.

2181
04:11:50,980 --> 04:11:52,980
Hi, Raina.

2182
04:11:52,980 --> 04:11:56,980
Are you like, ended up in your general direction?

2183
04:12:00,980 --> 04:12:03,980
I'm going to get on the stretch.

2184
04:12:03,980 --> 04:12:05,980
Yeah.

2185
04:12:05,980 --> 04:12:08,980
You want to stretch me?

2186
04:12:08,980 --> 04:12:10,980
You want to stretch me?

2187
04:12:10,980 --> 04:12:14,980
Yeah, all of you.

2188
04:12:14,980 --> 04:12:18,980
You didn't do the stretching, did you?

2189
04:12:18,980 --> 04:12:20,980
Oh, you can see it.

2190
04:12:20,980 --> 04:12:22,980
Hi, Raina.

2191
04:12:22,980 --> 04:12:24,980
I know you're here. I just saw you, Raina.

2192
04:12:24,980 --> 04:12:26,980
I thought you were being fake.

2193
04:12:26,980 --> 04:12:30,980
Here, you're looking a little bit chunky.

2194
04:12:30,980 --> 04:12:32,980
What's that, Raina?

2195
04:12:32,980 --> 04:12:35,980
Why do you look so large?

2196
04:12:35,980 --> 04:12:38,980
Here, why do you look a little funny?

2197
04:12:38,980 --> 04:12:41,980
It's because we're done.

2198
04:12:41,980 --> 04:12:43,980
Come here.

2199
04:12:44,980 --> 04:12:47,980
You look like you're taking over this world.

2200
04:12:49,980 --> 04:12:52,980
It was raised alongside dogs,

2201
04:12:52,980 --> 04:12:54,980
but under a rescuer,

2202
04:12:54,980 --> 04:12:58,980
and sometimes she curls her tail over her back.

2203
04:12:58,980 --> 04:13:00,980
I mean...

2204
04:13:13,980 --> 04:13:16,980
Yeah, can you do a big stretch?

2205
04:13:27,980 --> 04:13:30,980
Yeah, a lot of big stretch.

2206
04:13:31,980 --> 04:13:33,980
Yeah?

2207
04:13:36,980 --> 04:13:39,980
Raina, stretch!

2208
04:13:39,980 --> 04:13:44,980
She did it.

2209
04:13:44,980 --> 04:13:49,980
She got up on her tippy toes and stretched her up real long.

2210
04:13:49,980 --> 04:13:52,980
You guys missed it.

2211
04:13:52,980 --> 04:13:54,980
Sorry.

2212
04:13:58,980 --> 04:14:01,980
Why do I have in my box of Korean food?

2213
04:14:02,980 --> 04:14:04,980
Fuck away from here.

2214
04:14:04,980 --> 04:14:07,980
No, is this a shiho right?

2215
04:14:07,980 --> 04:14:09,980
I'm fine.

2216
04:14:09,980 --> 04:14:11,980
What's in here?

2217
04:14:11,980 --> 04:14:13,980
I got...

2218
04:14:13,980 --> 04:14:16,980
They're all just like pastry things.

2219
04:14:16,980 --> 04:14:18,980
Victory pie.

2220
04:14:18,980 --> 04:14:20,980
Ooh, a victory pie.

2221
04:14:20,980 --> 04:14:22,980
I should eat a victory pie.

2222
04:14:22,980 --> 04:14:24,980
I'll eat this victory pie.

2223
04:14:24,980 --> 04:14:26,980
The vic pie.

2224
04:14:26,980 --> 04:14:28,980
That's a weird-looking thing on it.

2225
04:14:28,980 --> 04:14:30,980
After I beat the fucking mad tone,

2226
04:14:30,980 --> 04:14:32,980
al-bar-la-la-la-la.

2227
04:14:34,980 --> 04:14:36,980
I'm about to go mono-e-mono.

2228
04:14:36,980 --> 04:14:38,980
My headphones are off.

2229
04:14:38,980 --> 04:14:41,980
I need to plug in my controller again.

2230
04:14:44,980 --> 04:14:46,980
Oh, my God.

2231
04:14:46,980 --> 04:14:48,980
She said, call that dolphin kitty.

2232
04:14:48,980 --> 04:14:50,980
My cat used to do that. That's cute.

2233
04:14:54,980 --> 04:14:56,980
If you're confident, you can get replacement choices

2234
04:14:56,980 --> 04:14:58,980
whether they be cheap or expensive.

2235
04:14:58,980 --> 04:15:00,980
You don't know what you're doing.

2236
04:15:00,980 --> 04:15:02,980
What?

2237
04:15:02,980 --> 04:15:04,980
Placement joysticks?

2238
04:15:04,980 --> 04:15:06,980
You want me to take apart my controller?

2239
04:15:06,980 --> 04:15:08,980
You want me to take apart my Joy-Con?

2240
04:15:08,980 --> 04:15:10,980
I'm smart, but I'm not that smart.

2241
04:15:16,980 --> 04:15:18,980
See, it works fine.

2242
04:15:18,980 --> 04:15:21,980
My PlayStation controller works fine.

2243
04:15:26,980 --> 04:15:28,980
I'll break. I come to bargain.

2244
04:15:28,980 --> 04:15:30,980
I'll take this, though.

2245
04:15:42,980 --> 04:15:44,980
You don't get to stun-lock me, dude.

2246
04:15:44,980 --> 04:15:46,980
No.

2247
04:15:50,980 --> 04:15:52,980
What the fuck?

2248
04:15:52,980 --> 04:15:54,980
What the hell?

2249
04:15:56,980 --> 04:15:58,980
I want a scythe.

2250
04:15:58,980 --> 04:16:00,980
Where do I get this fucking scythe?

2251
04:16:04,980 --> 04:16:06,980
Oh, my God. He's going to kill me again.

2252
04:16:06,980 --> 04:16:08,980
I got frostbite.

2253
04:16:16,980 --> 04:16:18,980
Why don't you fucking heal?

2254
04:16:18,980 --> 04:16:20,980
Yeah.

2255
04:16:20,980 --> 04:16:22,980
Why don't you fucking heal?

2256
04:16:22,980 --> 04:16:24,980
Motherfucker.

2257
04:16:26,980 --> 04:16:28,980
Yeah, you don't have any more, bitch.

2258
04:16:28,980 --> 04:16:30,980
Oh, shit.

2259
04:16:30,980 --> 04:16:32,980
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

2260
04:16:32,980 --> 04:16:34,980
But I have more.

2261
04:16:34,980 --> 04:16:36,980
Because I'm that bitch.

2262
04:16:46,980 --> 04:16:48,980
Anyways.

2263
04:16:50,980 --> 04:16:52,980
Is that the meta in the PvP?

2264
04:16:52,980 --> 04:16:54,980
I never ever play PvP.

2265
04:16:56,980 --> 04:16:58,980
Is that the meta?

2266
04:16:58,980 --> 04:17:00,980
Did this be a door?

2267
04:17:00,980 --> 04:17:02,980
I don't know. You tell me.

2268
04:17:04,980 --> 04:17:06,980
Stole his tongue.

2269
04:17:06,980 --> 04:17:08,980
Mmm.

2270
04:17:08,980 --> 04:17:10,980
Time for this victory pie.

2271
04:17:10,980 --> 04:17:12,980
It looks really gross.

2272
04:17:12,980 --> 04:17:14,980
Ew.

2273
04:17:14,980 --> 04:17:16,980
It smells bad.

2274
04:17:16,980 --> 04:17:18,980
Is it supposed to be strawberry flavored?

2275
04:17:18,980 --> 04:17:20,980
It has a giant V on it.

2276
04:17:20,980 --> 04:17:22,980
For Veeler.

2277
04:17:22,980 --> 04:17:24,980
It's a calming bad tongue as well.

2278
04:17:28,980 --> 04:17:30,980
I found madness to break PvP,

2279
04:17:30,980 --> 04:17:32,980
at least when I'm getting invaded.

2280
04:17:32,980 --> 04:17:34,980
Oh, nice.

2281
04:17:38,980 --> 04:17:40,980
Mmm.

2282
04:17:40,980 --> 04:17:42,980
It doesn't taste good.

2283
04:17:42,980 --> 04:17:44,980
Oh, thanks.

2284
04:17:44,980 --> 04:17:46,980
I'm good. Oh, thank you.

2285
04:17:52,980 --> 04:17:54,980
Damn.

2286
04:17:54,980 --> 04:17:56,980
You write a whole fucking essay

2287
04:17:56,980 --> 04:17:58,980
on the four agreements, bro?

2288
04:17:58,980 --> 04:18:00,980
Jesus Christ.

2289
04:18:00,980 --> 04:18:02,980
I just had to read it.

2290
04:18:06,980 --> 04:18:08,980
That's okay. I don't need this.

2291
04:18:08,980 --> 04:18:10,980
I like Stormville.

2292
04:18:10,980 --> 04:18:12,980
I mean Stormville. I like Moonville.

2293
04:18:12,980 --> 04:18:14,980
Sexy.

2294
04:18:14,980 --> 04:18:16,980
I am sexy.

2295
04:18:16,980 --> 04:18:18,980
I am sexy.

2296
04:18:18,980 --> 04:18:20,980
What are you doing?

2297
04:18:22,980 --> 04:18:24,980
Okay, is there a better snack in here

2298
04:18:24,980 --> 04:18:26,980
that is actually tasty?

2299
04:18:30,980 --> 04:18:32,980
Is this coffee?

2300
04:18:32,980 --> 04:18:34,980
Or coffee flavored?

2301
04:18:34,980 --> 04:18:36,980
It's like a wafer.

2302
04:18:44,980 --> 04:18:46,980
I can't get it out.

2303
04:18:46,980 --> 04:18:48,980
Oh.

2304
04:18:54,980 --> 04:18:56,980
It is coffee flavored.

2305
04:18:56,980 --> 04:18:58,980
It's actually not bad.

2306
04:18:58,980 --> 04:19:00,980
Interesting.

2307
04:19:02,980 --> 04:19:04,980
Kind of tweaking my mind out,

2308
04:19:04,980 --> 04:19:06,980
because I feel like I'm drinking coffee,

2309
04:19:08,980 --> 04:19:10,980
but I'm eating a biscuit.

2310
04:19:16,980 --> 04:19:18,980
Brother writing a thesis.

2311
04:19:26,980 --> 04:19:28,980
I usually don't like coffee flavored things.

2312
04:19:28,980 --> 04:19:30,980
I just prefer to drink coffee.

2313
04:19:46,980 --> 04:19:48,980
Lever or lever? Why?

2314
04:20:00,980 --> 04:20:02,980
I haven't had tiramisu in a long time.

2315
04:20:02,980 --> 04:20:04,980
Espresso mixed into chocolate

2316
04:20:04,980 --> 04:20:06,980
goes pretty hard.

2317
04:20:06,980 --> 04:20:08,980
I thought it was a party hard.

2318
04:20:08,980 --> 04:20:10,980
Too bad the place I bought the front was down.

2319
04:20:10,980 --> 04:20:12,980
Oh, that's too bad.

2320
04:20:12,980 --> 04:20:14,980
Look at all these

2321
04:20:14,980 --> 04:20:16,980
overgrown swords.

2322
04:20:36,980 --> 04:20:38,980
Pickle?

2323
04:20:38,980 --> 04:20:40,980
Aren't the flower up there?

2324
04:20:40,980 --> 04:20:42,980
Read message.

2325
04:20:50,980 --> 04:20:52,980
I want to roll into the fire.

2326
04:20:52,980 --> 04:20:54,980
Let's me roll into the fire.

2327
04:21:00,980 --> 04:21:02,980
What am I doing next?

2328
04:21:06,980 --> 04:21:08,980
I'm sorry.

2329
04:21:08,980 --> 04:21:10,980
I immediately turned when I saw it.

2330
04:21:10,980 --> 04:21:12,980
It was kind of funny.

2331
04:21:12,980 --> 04:21:14,980
I'm getting

2332
04:21:14,980 --> 04:21:16,980
the

2333
04:21:16,980 --> 04:21:18,980
Mogue tier.

2334
04:21:18,980 --> 04:21:20,980
Where's the Mogue tier?

2335
04:21:28,980 --> 04:21:30,980
I'm going to go over here and I'm going to grab that.

2336
04:21:30,980 --> 04:21:32,980
I'm going to go to the Ertree Gazing Hill.

2337
04:21:32,980 --> 04:21:34,980
What is this?

2338
04:21:34,980 --> 04:21:36,980
I'm literally just taking a bite of things

2339
04:21:36,980 --> 04:21:38,980
and then throwing it away.

2340
04:21:38,980 --> 04:21:40,980
Why is everything like a fig Newton?

2341
04:21:48,980 --> 04:21:50,980
What is supposed to be in the middle of this?

2342
04:21:50,980 --> 04:21:52,980
Why is it spicy?

2343
04:21:52,980 --> 04:21:54,980
Am I allergic?

2344
04:22:02,980 --> 04:22:04,980
I don't think I like that.

2345
04:22:04,980 --> 04:22:06,980
I'm covered in crumbs.

2346
04:22:14,980 --> 04:22:16,980
No, I think I'll be good.

2347
04:22:16,980 --> 04:22:18,980
Oh, shit. Why did I not see this before?

2348
04:22:18,980 --> 04:22:20,980
Hello?

2349
04:22:22,980 --> 04:22:24,980
Why did I not grab that?

2350
04:22:26,980 --> 04:22:28,980
I think I have enough to level up.

2351
04:22:28,980 --> 04:22:30,980
No.

2352
04:22:30,980 --> 04:22:32,980
No, I don't.

2353
04:22:32,980 --> 04:22:34,980
No.

2354
04:22:34,980 --> 04:22:36,980
I know there's some in the center.

2355
04:22:36,980 --> 04:22:38,980
Exactly, Boomi.

2356
04:22:42,980 --> 04:22:44,980
Oh, am I allergic?

2357
04:22:46,980 --> 04:22:48,980
No.

2358
04:22:48,980 --> 04:22:50,980
Hi.

2359
04:22:50,980 --> 04:22:52,980
Are you headbutting the box?

2360
04:22:52,980 --> 04:22:54,980
What's up?

2361
04:22:54,980 --> 04:22:56,980
Did you want it?

2362
04:22:56,980 --> 04:22:58,980
I was going to headbutt me.

2363
04:22:58,980 --> 04:23:00,980
You chewed this box, by the way.

2364
04:23:00,980 --> 04:23:02,980
Oh, my main main.

2365
04:23:02,980 --> 04:23:04,980
Oh, such a big head.

2366
04:23:04,980 --> 04:23:06,980
Yeah.

2367
04:23:06,980 --> 04:23:08,980
What are you chewing on the box?

2368
04:23:08,980 --> 04:23:10,980
He's a dog.

2369
04:23:10,980 --> 04:23:12,980
Puppy?

2370
04:23:12,980 --> 04:23:14,980
You're a little puppy?

2371
04:23:14,980 --> 04:23:16,980
You're a little puppy dog?

2372
04:23:22,980 --> 04:23:24,980
Boomi, are you teasing?

2373
04:23:24,980 --> 04:23:26,980
Baby?

2374
04:23:30,980 --> 04:23:32,980
I actually still have Boomi's first baby tooth,

2375
04:23:32,980 --> 04:23:34,980
just like a mom.

2376
04:23:34,980 --> 04:23:36,980
I regret where I put it, though.

2377
04:23:38,980 --> 04:23:40,980
Is that it?

2378
04:23:40,980 --> 04:23:42,980
No.

2379
04:23:42,980 --> 04:23:44,980
Welcome.

2380
04:23:44,980 --> 04:23:46,980
Day two of stream watching.

2381
04:23:46,980 --> 04:23:48,980
Welcome, welcome.

2382
04:23:48,980 --> 04:23:50,980
So,

2383
04:23:50,980 --> 04:23:52,980
let me go grab this.

2384
04:23:52,980 --> 04:23:54,980
Here.

2385
04:23:54,980 --> 04:23:56,980
That's all the way over there.

2386
04:23:56,980 --> 04:23:58,980
At least I can see where the fuck I'm going.

2387
04:24:06,980 --> 04:24:08,980
I can also

2388
04:24:08,980 --> 04:24:10,980
kill some fire monks

2389
04:24:10,980 --> 04:24:12,980
so I can be

2390
04:24:12,980 --> 04:24:14,980
more resistant

2391
04:24:14,980 --> 04:24:16,980
to fire magic myself.

2392
04:24:16,980 --> 04:24:18,980
I might do that

2393
04:24:18,980 --> 04:24:20,980
when I find some of my farm some fire monks.

2394
04:24:20,980 --> 04:24:22,980
Monks? Monks?

2395
04:24:22,980 --> 04:24:24,980
Why am I saying monks?

2396
04:24:24,980 --> 04:24:26,980
What the fuck is wrong with me?

2397
04:24:26,980 --> 04:24:28,980
I don't have my headphones in,

2398
04:24:28,980 --> 04:24:30,980
so I can't tell if anything's attacking me or not.

2399
04:24:30,980 --> 04:24:32,980
I'm not sure if the music's just changed.

2400
04:24:32,980 --> 04:24:34,980
I should probably put my thumb in.

2401
04:24:38,980 --> 04:24:40,980
Missed the Furpy App hour because you were asleep?

2402
04:24:40,980 --> 04:24:42,980
No worries.

2403
04:24:42,980 --> 04:24:44,980
We still yapping, we still having a good time.

2404
04:24:44,980 --> 04:24:46,980
I was eating soup.

2405
04:24:46,980 --> 04:24:48,980
You missed the soup, bro.

2406
04:24:48,980 --> 04:24:50,980
Let's get rid of Radon's Rune or keep the Godric one.

2407
04:24:50,980 --> 04:24:52,980
I forget what Radon's Rune does.

2408
04:24:52,980 --> 04:24:54,980
I didn't even go to the tower for his Rune.

2409
04:24:56,980 --> 04:24:58,980
So,

2410
04:24:58,980 --> 04:25:00,980
let me see.

2411
04:25:08,980 --> 04:25:10,980
Yeah, see, I can't.

2412
04:25:10,980 --> 04:25:12,980
I haven't gotten it benedicted yet.

2413
04:25:12,980 --> 04:25:14,980
It's best for a late game.

2414
04:25:14,980 --> 04:25:16,980
Increases health, fp, and endurance by 10%.

2415
04:25:18,980 --> 04:25:20,980
I hate that.

2416
04:25:20,980 --> 04:25:22,980
It isn't just a standard status.

2417
04:25:22,980 --> 04:25:24,980
You have to pop it, the Rune, to use it.

2418
04:25:24,980 --> 04:25:26,980
I'll be honest with you,

2419
04:25:26,980 --> 04:25:28,980
when I beat the game, I never even used great runes.

2420
04:25:30,980 --> 04:25:32,980
I never factored those into my builds.

2421
04:25:32,980 --> 04:25:34,980
I'm going the wrong way.

2422
04:25:34,980 --> 04:25:36,980
Excuse me.

2423
04:25:36,980 --> 04:25:38,980

06:24:41,740 --> 06:24:59,740
Are you alive? Okay. Just check me. Just check me. Hi. Oh, did you hear that?

3328
06:25:00,740 --> 06:25:04,740
Go show me the work. I don't know.

3329
06:25:12,740 --> 06:25:13,740
Let's see.

3330
06:25:13,740 --> 06:25:35,740
I'll call a bit and I can change this.

3331
06:25:35,740 --> 06:25:44,740
Oh, wait. This isn't for you. Go away.

3332
06:26:05,740 --> 06:26:25,740
I'll call a bit and I can change this.

3333
06:26:25,740 --> 06:26:33,740
I'll call a bit and I can change this.

3334
06:26:33,740 --> 06:26:45,740
Stop. No. Don't be. Why are you trying to take me so much today?

3335
06:26:45,740 --> 06:26:53,740
Turn around and move easy. You might not be able to see me. Let's put it in the microwave.

3336
06:26:53,740 --> 06:26:56,740
Don't start jumping in the microwave.

3337
06:27:16,740 --> 06:27:21,740
Boomi is here.

3338
06:27:21,740 --> 06:27:26,740
Well, he wants to pull him out of Boomi. First, she be steals Boomi chicken noodles soup.

3339
06:27:26,740 --> 06:27:29,740
Now, his mac and cheese.

3340
06:27:29,740 --> 06:27:36,740
Oh, he does. He climbs in the cabinets. He climbs in the fridge. He climbs in my washing machine.

3341
06:27:36,740 --> 06:27:42,740
He tries to get into the dryer, but it's stacked on top of the washing machine so you can't get to it.

3342
06:27:42,740 --> 06:27:47,740
He tries to get into the microwave. I think he's talking to the microwave once.

3343
06:27:47,740 --> 06:27:52,740
He's got a dishwasher where I was loading it up and I walked away for a moment.

3344
06:27:52,740 --> 06:28:01,740
He literally has, I have to double check that he's not somewhere so I don't accidentally fucking kill him.

3345
06:28:12,740 --> 06:28:26,740
I'm just going to feed up. I have a little next-level thing that you can feed it up and it has essential oils and stuff.

3346
06:28:26,740 --> 06:28:32,740
So it's kind of like a relaxive... relaxive.

3347
06:28:42,740 --> 06:29:07,740
I'm going to put a little bit of barbecue sauce on my mac and cheese and a little barbecue sauce.

3348
06:29:07,740 --> 06:29:15,740
And you know, thankfully I have barbecue sauce because I only accommodate it to my home.

3349
06:29:15,740 --> 06:29:27,740
It's Chick-fil-A barbecue sauce.

3350
06:29:27,740 --> 06:29:45,740
I'm going to put a little balsamic on it, you know, a little bit of balsamic.

3351
06:29:46,740 --> 06:30:01,740
Oh, delicious.

3352
06:30:01,740 --> 06:30:13,740
He's talking me into buying groceries.

3353
06:30:13,740 --> 06:30:20,740
Mmm, girl dinner. It's just what? It's just mac and cheese and a little bit of barbecue sauce on my phone.

3354
06:30:20,740 --> 06:30:24,740
Very tasty.

3355
06:30:24,740 --> 06:30:33,740
He's trying to bake it in the bottom.

3356
06:30:33,740 --> 06:31:02,740
Oh, my God.

3357
06:31:02,740 --> 06:31:10,740
My diet is condiments? No.

3358
06:31:10,740 --> 06:31:27,740
It's very sacred to have girl dinner. Very sacred.

3359
06:31:27,740 --> 06:31:33,740
It's very good girl dinner.

3360
06:31:33,740 --> 06:31:40,740
You need real food that's not DoorDash? Yeah, so...

3361
06:31:40,740 --> 06:31:47,740
I'm not sure if it's a Bible study.

3362
06:31:47,740 --> 06:31:51,740
Girl dinner is essential.

3363
06:31:51,740 --> 06:31:56,740
Yeah, Toma gets it.

3364
06:31:56,740 --> 06:32:19,740
Toma has amazing girl dinners, so like she'll post her for girl dinners of the day for girl breakfast.

3365
06:32:19,740 --> 06:32:29,740
Precisely. I'll be able to get some home cooked meals.

3366
06:32:29,740 --> 06:32:40,740
It's funny because like I can cook, like I'm a good cook and all I just don't have any rest like materials to cook with.

3367
06:32:40,740 --> 06:32:46,740
Oopsies.

3368
06:32:46,740 --> 06:32:56,740
Oh, hey, my audio comes out today.

3369
06:32:56,740 --> 06:33:17,740
Where do I get Azur's comment?

3370
06:33:17,740 --> 06:33:25,740
My eye itches.

3371
06:33:25,740 --> 06:33:37,740
I'll have to do Selen's quest. Is it worth it?

3372
06:33:37,740 --> 06:33:45,740
Because I feel like, because that doesn't like stomach him. That'll be a while.

3373
06:33:45,740 --> 06:33:49,740
No? Okay.

3374
06:33:49,740 --> 06:34:02,740
What are your suggestions? Do you think I should really just like aim just to do bleed?

3375
06:34:02,740 --> 06:34:15,740
Because I remember last time I beat Mogue, I literally, I just summoned somebody and they literally just whipped out Azur's comment and just fucking mowed him down.

3376
06:34:15,740 --> 06:34:29,740
And I was like, oh, thanks, Rando. Because again, yeah, he's very slow.

3377
06:34:29,740 --> 06:34:34,740
Yeah, give me, give me some just because I still have one slot.

3378
06:34:34,740 --> 06:34:39,740
I have a slot, a memory slot. I'm cracking it back.

3379
06:34:39,740 --> 06:34:47,740
Ah, there it is. Ah, there it is again.

3380
06:34:47,740 --> 06:34:50,740
That's if you're overleveled from him.

3381
06:34:50,740 --> 06:34:56,740
No, I try to like be bosses by myself in the night. If I can't do it, then I'll summon you guys.

3382
06:34:56,740 --> 06:35:04,740
There's no suit with dead. I just teared and commented him too, but you need to be quite leveled. Okay.

3383
06:35:04,740 --> 06:35:14,740
Nice crack. I'll look at my butt. I'm kidding. I'm looking at my boobs. I'm kidding.

3384
06:35:14,740 --> 06:35:24,740
I'm getting a really bad pain in my lower back. I feel like I need to like stand up.

3385
06:35:24,740 --> 06:35:34,740
I'm going to put my pants down so I can lift this heat on my back. Oh, that feels so good.

3386
06:35:34,740 --> 06:35:36,740
Ah, my back hurts too.

3387
06:35:36,740 --> 06:35:40,740
Sorry, again, I'm a 52 year old woman. Sorry, 56 year old woman.

3388
06:35:40,740 --> 06:35:45,740
So it's very hard to live.

3389
06:35:45,740 --> 06:35:48,740
I'm getting dialysis on my ass.

3390
06:35:48,740 --> 06:35:51,740
Sorry.

3391
06:35:51,740 --> 06:35:56,740
And the breasts are out of strength on the screen. How's that?

3392
06:35:56,740 --> 06:36:03,740
Good. Torture y'all.

3393
06:36:03,740 --> 06:36:10,740
Tell me, did you just steal her spring? Are you bringing it to me? Do you want me to throw it? Okay, drop it.

3394
06:36:10,740 --> 06:36:12,740
Oh, thank you.

3395
06:36:12,740 --> 06:36:13,740
Ready?

3396
06:36:13,740 --> 06:36:18,740
We're getting it.

3397
06:36:18,740 --> 06:36:25,740
Brother, did you get it? Okay, bring it back. Bring it back.

3398
06:36:25,740 --> 06:36:30,740
Nope, bring it back. Boomie.

3399
06:36:30,740 --> 06:36:36,740
You dropped it too far. Don't look at me. I'm not grabbing it.

3400
06:36:36,740 --> 06:36:47,740
He's like looking at me like, why don't you come and pick it up and throw it again, please?

3401
06:36:47,740 --> 06:36:52,740
Yeah, don't knock it under the closet door.

3402
06:36:52,740 --> 06:36:59,740
This feels nice on my back.

3403
06:36:59,740 --> 06:37:02,740
This is only 26.

3404
06:37:02,740 --> 06:37:07,740
I know it requires a lot, but we're literally about to start farming.

3405
06:37:07,740 --> 06:37:17,740
I'm probably going to go get some arrows so I can farm that bird.

3406
06:37:17,740 --> 06:37:29,740
A question, though. Did they patch the farm where you're still where Mogwin's Castle is?

3407
06:37:29,740 --> 06:37:43,740
And you kind of like go through these rocks and you go through this cave and then you jump down and then you just swing and dagger back and forth and then you just farm?

3408
06:37:43,740 --> 06:37:48,740
Did they patch that? Did you just fall through the map?

3409
06:37:48,740 --> 06:37:52,740
Did the bird farm still work? Okay.

3410
06:37:52,740 --> 06:38:01,740
I remember doing that, you know, farm for a bit because you got more, I believe, in the bird farm.

3411
06:38:01,740 --> 06:38:06,740
All right.

3412
06:38:06,740 --> 06:38:14,740
Oh, Toma just went live.

3413
06:38:14,740 --> 06:38:26,740
What is it called? She goes off?

3414
06:38:26,740 --> 06:38:31,740
There it is, also, live because it's age.

3415
06:38:31,740 --> 06:38:34,740
Toma, I know where it is.

3416
06:38:34,740 --> 06:38:36,740
I need a heart.

3417
06:38:36,740 --> 06:38:43,740
You!

3418
06:38:43,740 --> 06:38:48,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3419
06:40:01,740 --> 06:40:04,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3420
06:40:31,740 --> 06:40:34,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3421
06:41:01,740 --> 06:41:04,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3422
06:41:31,740 --> 06:41:34,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3423
06:42:01,740 --> 06:42:04,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3424
06:42:31,740 --> 06:42:34,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3425
06:43:01,740 --> 06:43:04,740
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.

3426
06:43:31,740 --> 06:43:38,740
Okay, hi. Sorry.

3427
06:43:38,740 --> 06:43:42,740
I got distracted because I don't know what to do with you.

3428
06:43:42,740 --> 06:43:45,740
It's funny.

3429
06:43:45,740 --> 06:43:50,740
I don't know if you're okay with me bringing it back, but I'm just sitting here.

3430
06:43:50,740 --> 06:44:00,740
I really wish I had ice cream.

3431
06:44:00,740 --> 06:44:05,740
Did I already talk about ice cream today? Do I now want ice cream?

3432
06:44:05,740 --> 06:44:09,740
I'm not going to be my appetite screen back all the time.

3433
06:44:21,740 --> 06:44:24,740
How are you guys doing? Are you guys okay?

3434
06:44:24,740 --> 06:44:28,740
He's falling asleep from the dead silence and then he's like, hey guys.

3435
06:44:28,740 --> 06:44:30,740
You get an EP?

3436
06:44:30,740 --> 06:44:34,740
You could have gotten an ice cream when you buy groceries.

3437
06:44:34,740 --> 06:44:38,740
I'm a bit EP too.

3438
06:44:38,740 --> 06:44:44,740
I can't believe I've been streaming for almost eight hours.

3439
06:44:44,740 --> 06:44:46,740
Oh.

3440
06:44:46,740 --> 06:44:49,740
Look, there's also makeup.

3441
06:44:49,740 --> 06:44:53,740
Okay.

3442
06:44:53,740 --> 06:44:56,740
You don't need it.

3443
06:44:56,740 --> 06:44:58,740
Okay.

3444
06:44:58,740 --> 06:45:00,740
Okay, okay.

3445
06:45:06,740 --> 06:45:08,740
Hi.

3446
06:45:08,740 --> 06:45:10,740
Hi.

3447
06:45:15,740 --> 06:45:17,740
Hi.

3448
06:45:26,740 --> 06:45:29,740
Sorry, am I leaving?

3449
06:45:29,740 --> 06:45:34,740
I've been sitting down for a real long time.

3450
06:45:37,740 --> 06:45:39,740
Hello.

3451
06:45:44,740 --> 06:45:46,740
Being back.

3452
06:45:46,740 --> 06:45:48,740
Super EP.

3453
06:45:48,740 --> 06:45:50,740
12.15. Time for sleep.

3454
06:45:50,740 --> 06:45:55,740
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Good night everybody that's going to sleep.

3455
06:45:55,740 --> 06:45:57,740
Good night.

3456
06:45:57,740 --> 06:45:59,740
Sleep tight.

3457
06:45:59,740 --> 06:46:02,740
Don't let the madam bite.

3458
06:46:02,740 --> 06:46:07,740
Because I will and he'll be very, very hard.

3459
06:46:14,740 --> 06:46:19,740
I'm working while the stream is on.

3460
06:46:19,740 --> 06:46:22,740
I don't know why this is so scary.

3461
06:46:22,740 --> 06:46:24,740
Proof.

3462
06:46:24,740 --> 06:46:26,740
Proof.

3463
06:46:26,740 --> 06:46:28,740
Proof.

3464
06:46:28,740 --> 06:46:30,740
Proof.

3465
06:46:30,740 --> 06:46:32,740
Proof.

3466
06:46:32,740 --> 06:46:34,740
Proof.

3467
06:46:34,740 --> 06:46:36,740
Proof.

3468
06:46:36,740 --> 06:46:38,740
Proof.

3469
06:46:38,740 --> 06:46:44,740
Watch that voice. This is top scare.

3470
06:46:44,740 --> 06:46:49,740
Pro controversial madam.

3471
06:46:49,740 --> 06:46:51,740
Bye everybody. Have a good night.

3472
06:46:53,740 --> 06:46:56,740
Thank you for stopping by.

3473
06:46:56,740 --> 06:47:04,740
If you guys got stuff to do, make sure you go do it.

3474
06:47:04,740 --> 06:47:07,740
If you have chores to do, make sure you.

3475
06:47:07,740 --> 06:47:15,540
public. Did your, did your peepee jump? Did your bible jump up in joy? Sorry, that's

3476
06:47:15,540 --> 06:47:32,340
my, um, hair leaning back in it. Giving yourself the ol' hawk to look? My house? Nice, nice.

3477
06:47:32,340 --> 06:47:37,340
8-18 for me. Good for another 4-6 hours. Uh, no, I'm gonna just keep playing.

3478
06:47:37,340 --> 06:47:41,340
Talk to my brother like that. Man, like, leg needs to pop and I can't pop it.

3479
06:47:41,340 --> 06:47:45,340
Okay, pop it.

3480
06:47:48,340 --> 06:47:52,340
Selling your torch yesterday or should I be a mistake? Did I miss your left or dead club?

3481
06:47:52,340 --> 06:47:54,340
That was good. That was a really fun collab.

3482
06:47:56,340 --> 06:47:57,340
Make sure you watch the void.

3483
06:48:02,340 --> 06:48:07,340
I say my bible says so, do you say that? Hee hee hee. Hee hee hee, hoo hoo hoo.

3484
06:48:09,340 --> 06:48:12,340
Alright, where am I?

3485
06:48:15,340 --> 06:48:19,340
Look, I'm at my pillow, at my blinky.

3486
06:48:20,340 --> 06:48:26,340
Let me fix my model. I haven't looked at OBS this entire time, so I, I apologize if my

3487
06:48:26,340 --> 06:48:28,340
model's like, far the fuck away.

3488
06:48:28,340 --> 06:48:35,340
Okay, um, let me grab that. Let me do that.

3489
06:48:38,340 --> 06:48:40,340
Lean back.

3490
06:48:40,340 --> 06:48:42,340
Make myself a little bit bigger.

3491
06:48:46,340 --> 06:48:49,340
I'm close. By my clouds.

3492
06:48:59,340 --> 06:49:05,340
Should we talk for over 4 hours after? Yeah, I know, it's not the same.

3493
06:49:05,340 --> 06:49:10,340
Danielson says, I know, they fucking took out Azura, like, what the hell?

3494
06:49:12,340 --> 06:49:17,340
Yeah, I was, I was surprised I kept talking, because I literally was gonna end stream right after

3495
06:49:17,340 --> 06:49:23,340
the collab and like, go like, fuck about or whatever. And then, um, what was it?

3496
06:49:23,340 --> 06:49:26,340
Then Azura's like, oh, I think I might talk to my chat and like say bye and everything.

3497
06:49:26,340 --> 06:49:28,340
I'm like, oh, actually, I should do that too.

3498
06:49:28,340 --> 06:49:31,340
And talk to you guys about, like, that I'll be leaving for a little bit.

3499
06:49:31,340 --> 06:49:35,340
Um, and then I just talk for 4 hours.

3500
06:49:37,340 --> 06:49:39,340
Lipsies.

3501
06:49:39,340 --> 06:49:41,340
Oopsie-doopsies.

3502
06:49:42,340 --> 06:49:44,340
Aw, I hope you feel better.

3503
06:49:44,340 --> 06:49:46,340
I'm sorry I'm in pain too.

3504
06:49:50,340 --> 06:49:53,340
I almost paid, I know, you guys almost got me to talk another 30 minutes.

3505
06:49:54,340 --> 06:49:59,340
It's not happening again, I still want to watch a boys episode.

3506
06:50:06,340 --> 06:50:08,340
Oh la la la la la.

3507
06:50:09,340 --> 06:50:11,340
How long have I been streaming for?

3508
06:50:12,340 --> 06:50:14,340
Let's see.

3509
06:50:16,340 --> 06:50:21,340
I just feel like it's been more than 8 hours.

3510
06:50:23,340 --> 06:50:25,340
Um, goes by, would you have a phone?

3511
06:50:25,340 --> 06:50:27,340
Oh wait, now I can see the chat.

3512
06:50:29,340 --> 06:50:31,340
I do love the app streams.

3513
06:50:31,340 --> 06:50:33,340
I love the app in two guys.

3514
06:50:33,340 --> 06:50:35,340
Instructions.

3515
06:50:37,340 --> 06:50:39,340
You have that effect.

3516
06:50:41,340 --> 06:50:43,340
Ow, my knee.

3517
06:50:43,340 --> 06:50:45,340
Uh, I just hit my knee.

3518
06:50:45,340 --> 06:50:47,340
The app love.

3519
06:50:47,340 --> 06:50:49,340
Live, live the app love.

3520
06:50:49,340 --> 06:50:52,340
That was a beautiful shot you guys were able to see.

3521
06:50:52,340 --> 06:50:55,340
Just people just like hanging out, you know, just chilling.

3522
06:50:55,340 --> 06:51:02,340
I always love the compare, like the similarities between this and like Christ on the cross.

3523
06:51:02,340 --> 06:51:06,340
And then it's like Merica, because Merica is like Christ essentially and God.

3524
06:51:06,340 --> 06:51:12,340
It's very interesting to me, the parallels, the biblical stuff in this game.

3525
06:51:16,340 --> 06:51:18,340
What's my runes?

3526
06:51:18,340 --> 06:51:20,340
What the hell?

3527
06:51:28,340 --> 06:51:31,340
Can I pick them up please? Jesus Christ.

3528
06:51:40,340 --> 06:51:42,340
What am I doing now?

3529
06:51:43,340 --> 06:51:45,340
Cool.

3530
06:51:46,340 --> 06:51:52,340
Oh yeah, I'm going to West of Gaitown.

3531
06:52:04,340 --> 06:52:06,340
Over here, isn't it?

3532
06:52:07,340 --> 06:52:13,340
I don't know why I closed it out.

3533
06:52:21,340 --> 06:52:26,340
I kind of felt Christian fiction is a Jesus thing and not just a cruel way to kill people invented by the Romans.

3534
06:52:26,340 --> 06:52:31,340
Well it was, like if Jesus was the only one that was crucified, they would do that to just normal people.

3535
06:52:32,340 --> 06:52:38,340
It's really funny because it's like, I think they discovered they never put them on crosses,

3536
06:52:38,340 --> 06:52:43,340
but it was just like a giant stake in the ground where you're pinned up above your head and below your legs.

3537
06:52:46,340 --> 06:52:48,340
The south of the marker?

3538
06:52:50,340 --> 06:52:52,340
Below this?

3539
06:52:54,340 --> 06:52:56,340
I think you're right.

3540
06:53:01,340 --> 06:53:04,340
Yeah, the random dude who's just like, I'm hanging out.

3541
06:53:04,340 --> 06:53:09,340
He's just like, ah, you'll be with me in heaven in paradise.

3542
06:53:12,340 --> 06:53:16,340
Although, again, different translations.

3543
06:53:16,340 --> 06:53:18,340
Sorry, excuse me.

3544
06:53:20,340 --> 06:53:22,340
Oh yes, the temple fortah.

3545
06:53:28,340 --> 06:53:30,340
Yeah, that's a lot.

3546
06:53:31,340 --> 06:53:40,340
Oh, fuck that I got all over here.

3547
06:53:49,340 --> 06:53:51,340
I need to get a better vantage point.

3548
06:53:55,340 --> 06:53:56,340
Alright.

3549
06:54:01,340 --> 06:54:03,340
Let's go.

3550
06:54:11,340 --> 06:54:13,340
Damn, that horse can jump.

3551
06:54:14,340 --> 06:54:18,340
Yeah, I remember I grew up reading the King James version of the Bible.

3552
06:54:22,340 --> 06:54:25,340
You want to go to the next island to the south on the map?

3553
06:54:25,340 --> 06:54:27,340
Over there?

3554
06:54:28,340 --> 06:54:30,340
That one?

3555
06:54:32,340 --> 06:54:34,340
That's not the south, is it?

3556
06:54:35,340 --> 06:54:37,340
That's the west.

3557
06:54:38,340 --> 06:54:40,340
Over there?

3558
06:54:40,340 --> 06:54:42,340
I think that's it straight ahead.

3559
06:54:43,340 --> 06:54:45,340
Yeah.

3560
06:55:01,340 --> 06:55:03,340
Okay.

3561
06:55:08,340 --> 06:55:12,340
Let me go get my fucking...

3562
06:55:16,340 --> 06:55:18,340
That was weird, where are they?

3563
06:55:32,340 --> 06:55:34,340
Thank you.

3564
06:55:38,340 --> 06:55:40,340
That was odd.

3565
06:55:40,340 --> 06:55:42,340
Oh, no ice.

3566
06:55:42,340 --> 06:55:47,340
I died there, but you know, go off, sis, I suppose.

3567
06:55:47,340 --> 06:55:51,340
I guess I won't go down that particular way, because it just killed me.

3568
06:55:51,340 --> 06:55:57,340
So just step out right here and land properly.

3569
06:55:57,340 --> 06:56:00,340
Right here, and land properly.

3570
06:56:27,340 --> 06:56:36,340
Sorry if you can hear Fiamme yelling to herself in the background, she's playing.

3571
06:56:43,340 --> 06:56:45,340
Bari, where the fuck are you, bro?

3572
06:56:45,340 --> 06:56:47,340
There you are.

3573
06:56:47,340 --> 06:56:49,340
You are...

3574
06:56:49,340 --> 06:56:51,340
You look like a woman.

3575
06:56:51,340 --> 06:56:53,340
You look like a very comely woman.

3576
06:56:53,340 --> 06:56:55,340
What's up with that?

3577
06:56:58,340 --> 06:57:00,340
Thank you.

3578
06:57:00,340 --> 06:57:02,340
Did I sneeze again?

3579
06:57:02,340 --> 06:57:04,340
I don't remember.

3580
06:57:11,340 --> 06:57:13,340
They didn't seem right.

3581
06:57:15,340 --> 06:57:17,340
They look gross and sickly.

3582
06:57:19,340 --> 06:57:21,340
We come through the maid in himself.

3583
06:57:23,340 --> 06:57:25,340
Why are you covered in blood?

3584
06:57:25,340 --> 06:57:27,340
Why are you covered in blood?

3585
06:57:31,340 --> 06:57:33,340
Fari's the baddest.

3586
06:57:33,340 --> 06:57:35,340
Baddest of them all.

3587
06:57:35,340 --> 06:57:39,340
Ooh, you wanna dance, baby?

3588
06:57:39,340 --> 06:57:41,340
Oh.

3589
06:57:41,340 --> 06:57:44,340
It's had a really bad burp.

3590
06:57:44,340 --> 06:57:56,340
I wonder what happens if, like, you say, I think they're awesome.

3591
06:57:59,340 --> 06:58:01,340
Wow.

3592
06:58:15,340 --> 06:58:19,340
All right.

3593
06:58:34,340 --> 06:58:37,340
I don't really feel like I'm meeting a random person.

3594
06:58:38,340 --> 06:58:40,340
Um...

3595
06:58:43,340 --> 06:58:46,340
I forget how do you do this without...

3596
06:58:48,340 --> 06:58:53,340
I rather do the P-W-E. I'm online, so if I go...

3597
06:58:53,340 --> 06:58:55,340
Okay.

3598
06:58:55,340 --> 06:58:57,340
I don't know why I'm here.

3599
06:58:57,340 --> 06:58:59,340
Ah, I'm stuck.

3600
06:59:03,340 --> 06:59:05,340
I don't know why I clicked that.

3601
06:59:05,340 --> 06:59:07,340
I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it.

3602
06:59:07,340 --> 06:59:09,340
Um...

3603
06:59:11,340 --> 06:59:13,340
Okay.

3604
06:59:13,340 --> 06:59:15,340
I don't know why I clicked that.

3605
06:59:15,340 --> 06:59:17,340
I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it.

3606
06:59:17,340 --> 06:59:19,340
Um...

3607
06:59:20,340 --> 06:59:24,340
Yeah, don't you have to be in offline mode?

3608
06:59:24,340 --> 06:59:26,340
Uh, let's do it.

3609
06:59:26,340 --> 06:59:29,340
Oh, I didn't mean to fucking press that.

3610
06:59:29,340 --> 06:59:31,340
It's fine.

3611
06:59:38,340 --> 06:59:40,340
What?

3612
06:59:49,340 --> 06:59:51,340
What?

3613
06:59:59,340 --> 07:00:01,340
I'm offline.

3614
07:00:01,340 --> 07:00:03,340
What?

3615
07:00:16,340 --> 07:00:18,340
Is it working?

3616
07:00:26,340 --> 07:00:29,340
I forgot to inform you we're still alive.

3617
07:00:29,340 --> 07:00:31,340
Shit.

3618
07:00:44,340 --> 07:00:46,340
What do you mean?

3619
07:00:46,340 --> 07:00:48,340
First Mount Gelmer Bridge Grace?

3620
07:00:48,340 --> 07:00:50,340
What do you mean?

3621
07:00:50,340 --> 07:00:52,340
Press any button.

3622
07:00:52,340 --> 07:00:54,340
Continue.

3623
07:00:55,340 --> 07:00:58,340
You don't have to be offline, though.

3624
07:00:58,340 --> 07:01:00,340
I've beaten it offline.

3625
07:01:02,340 --> 07:01:05,340
Because you just fight the random NPCs.

3626
07:01:07,340 --> 07:01:09,340
The fuck off.

3627
07:01:09,340 --> 07:01:11,340
I was running in the wrong direction.

3628
07:01:11,340 --> 07:01:13,340
Hi!

3629
07:01:24,340 --> 07:01:26,340
What?

3630
07:01:30,340 --> 07:01:33,340
But I've done it without invading someone before.

3631
07:01:33,340 --> 07:01:35,340
Why isn't it letting me do it?

3632
07:01:39,340 --> 07:01:42,340
There's an NPC I could just kill in the white blood ruins.

3633
07:01:42,340 --> 07:01:44,340
That's an...

3634
07:01:44,340 --> 07:01:46,340
You said the Altus Watto?

3635
07:01:55,340 --> 07:01:57,340
Okay.

3636
07:01:57,340 --> 07:01:59,340
White blood ruins.

3637
07:01:59,340 --> 07:02:01,340
My eyes fucking twitching.

3638
07:02:04,340 --> 07:02:06,340
Quick! Google search!

3639
07:02:16,340 --> 07:02:18,340
It's writhed blood, by the way.

3640
07:02:18,340 --> 07:02:20,340
It's not white blood.

3641
07:02:25,340 --> 07:02:27,340
Why are they so small?

3642
07:02:44,340 --> 07:02:47,340
Better do it than she being Google.

3643
07:02:47,340 --> 07:02:49,340
Me and you.

3644
07:02:55,340 --> 07:02:57,340
Who made you do this?

3645
07:02:57,340 --> 07:02:59,340
You're spreading under the couch.

3646
07:02:59,340 --> 07:03:01,340
I think you just did.

3647
07:03:01,340 --> 07:03:03,340
I think you just did.

3648
07:03:22,340 --> 07:03:24,340
Ooh, what this blood grease?

3649
07:03:31,340 --> 07:03:33,340
Spring or cry?

3650
07:03:33,340 --> 07:03:35,340
I literally just got them four springs

3651
07:03:35,340 --> 07:03:37,340
from out from under my...

3652
07:03:37,340 --> 07:03:39,340
They? Fire monks?

3653
07:03:39,340 --> 07:03:41,340
No.

3654
07:03:41,340 --> 07:03:43,340
Out from under...

3655
07:03:43,340 --> 07:03:45,340
my fridge, so...

3656
07:03:46,340 --> 07:03:48,340
Alright.

3657
07:03:48,340 --> 07:03:50,340
Where are you at?

3658
07:03:56,340 --> 07:03:58,340
Fucking dogs.

3659
07:03:58,340 --> 07:04:00,340
Oh, what's this?

3660
07:04:00,340 --> 07:04:02,340
Oh, my God.

3661
07:04:02,340 --> 07:04:04,340
Oh, I'm s- I have them in the wrong thing.

3662
07:04:04,340 --> 07:04:06,340
Oh, no.

3663
07:04:06,340 --> 07:04:08,340
Hold on.

3664
07:04:09,340 --> 07:04:11,340
I forgot I had them in the wrong...

3665
07:04:25,340 --> 07:04:27,340
May what?

3666
07:04:28,340 --> 07:04:30,340
Oh, no. What the fuck?

3667
07:04:30,340 --> 07:04:32,340
I was confused.

3668
07:04:37,340 --> 07:04:39,340
Should be an invasion sign?

3669
07:04:39,340 --> 07:04:41,340
Oh, okay.

3670
07:04:47,340 --> 07:04:49,340
I thought I did this all before.

3671
07:04:49,340 --> 07:04:51,340
I just don't fucking remember shit.

3672
07:04:57,340 --> 07:04:59,340
Hmm.

3673
07:04:59,340 --> 07:05:01,340
What are you eating in that one?

3674
07:05:07,340 --> 07:05:09,340
Fucking dogs!

3675
07:05:11,340 --> 07:05:13,340
Oh, you fucking puppy!

3676
07:05:20,340 --> 07:05:22,340
Flashes.

3677
07:05:23,340 --> 07:05:25,340
Actually, I'm gonna kill these fucking dogs

3678
07:05:25,340 --> 07:05:27,340
before I do anything.

3679
07:05:37,340 --> 07:05:38,340
Oh, what the hell?

3680
07:05:38,340 --> 07:05:39,340
I'm gonna kill them all

3681
07:05:39,340 --> 07:05:42,340
because it did the little indication that I did.

3682
07:05:44,340 --> 07:05:46,340
Anyone else?

3683
07:05:46,340 --> 07:05:48,340
Anyone else?

3684
07:05:48,340 --> 07:05:50,340
Alright.

3685
07:05:56,340 --> 07:05:58,340
I should fold this guy.

3686
07:06:02,340 --> 07:06:04,340
He is running at me.

3687
07:06:04,340 --> 07:06:06,340
Jesus.

3688
07:06:07,340 --> 07:06:09,340
Yeah, I fucking understand.

3689
07:06:09,340 --> 07:06:11,340
Oh, God.

3690
07:06:11,340 --> 07:06:13,340
Jesus, stop using beast magic on me.

3691
07:06:25,340 --> 07:06:27,340
Oh, I didn't mean to hit that.

3692
07:06:30,340 --> 07:06:32,340
Oh, let's not die.

3693
07:06:33,340 --> 07:06:35,340
Oh, I forgot you only have limited shit.

3694
07:06:35,340 --> 07:06:37,340
I totally forgot about that.

3695
07:06:43,340 --> 07:06:45,340
I totally forgot about this thing.

3696
07:06:45,340 --> 07:06:47,340
I totally forgot about this thing.

3697
07:07:03,340 --> 07:07:05,340
Sorry, bro.

3698
07:07:12,340 --> 07:07:14,340
You can revert the eyes

3699
07:07:14,340 --> 07:07:16,340
in the mirror in the wrong table.

3700
07:07:16,340 --> 07:07:18,340
What?

3701
07:07:18,340 --> 07:07:20,340
The other, the bloody finger quest

3702
07:07:20,340 --> 07:07:22,340
gives you character weird eyes.

3703
07:07:24,340 --> 07:07:26,340
Oh!

3704
07:07:26,340 --> 07:07:29,340
You've ruined your fashion souls, Bill.

3705
07:07:29,340 --> 07:07:31,340
That's funny.

3706
07:07:31,340 --> 07:07:32,340
I forgot.

3707
07:07:32,340 --> 07:07:34,340
Yeah, they get like, I left them

3708
07:07:34,340 --> 07:07:36,340
because I thought they looked cool.

3709
07:07:36,340 --> 07:07:38,340
Shibu Pro Gamer?

3710
07:07:38,340 --> 07:07:40,340
I don't know about that.

3711
07:07:40,340 --> 07:07:42,340
Yeah, it makes your eyes fucking weird looking.

3712
07:07:42,340 --> 07:07:44,340
I liked it, though, because my character had

3713
07:07:44,340 --> 07:07:46,340
really pale gray skin and platinum white hair.

3714
07:07:46,340 --> 07:07:48,340
So it was cool.

3715
07:07:48,340 --> 07:07:50,340
Yeah, I'm happy I killed them

3716
07:07:50,340 --> 07:07:52,340
because then they can't just fucking attack me

3717
07:07:52,340 --> 07:07:54,340
when I'm standing here.

3718
07:07:54,340 --> 07:07:56,340
It makes you a star.

3719
07:07:58,340 --> 07:08:00,340
So, yeah, I like the frenzy frame.

3720
07:08:00,340 --> 07:08:02,340
It makes your eyes like crazy gold,

3721
07:08:02,340 --> 07:08:04,340
orangey shit, and I always like that.

3722
07:08:08,340 --> 07:08:10,340
Who was talking?

3723
07:08:12,340 --> 07:08:14,340
I don't know.

3724
07:08:16,340 --> 07:08:18,340
I hear someone like deeply breathing.

3725
07:08:18,340 --> 07:08:20,340
What the fuck is that?

3726
07:08:40,340 --> 07:08:42,340
What the fuck is that?

3727
07:08:48,340 --> 07:08:50,340
Become a witcher.

3728
07:08:52,340 --> 07:08:54,340
The ucky burn marks aren't a good point.

3729
07:08:56,340 --> 07:08:58,340
Sorry, I'll stop breathing.

3730
07:08:58,340 --> 07:09:00,340
What is your name?

3731
07:09:00,340 --> 07:09:02,340
Oh, you have a dog nearby?

3732
07:09:02,340 --> 07:09:04,340
I don't think that's what dogs sound like.

3733
07:09:14,340 --> 07:09:16,340
It sounds like there's a troll below me

3734
07:09:16,340 --> 07:09:18,340
laughing.

3735
07:09:18,340 --> 07:09:20,340
Oh, it is like dogs.

3736
07:09:20,340 --> 07:09:22,340
What the fuck are those?

3737
07:09:22,340 --> 07:09:24,340
Oh, it's like the Blight dogs.

3738
07:09:26,340 --> 07:09:28,340
That's terrifying.

3739
07:09:28,340 --> 07:09:30,340
I'm like, what the hell is that noise?

3740
07:09:30,340 --> 07:09:32,340
The worm face, bros.

3741
07:09:32,340 --> 07:09:34,340
Alright, where's the next one?

3742
07:09:34,340 --> 07:09:36,340
Point me in the right direction.

3743
07:09:36,340 --> 07:09:38,340
I'll fuck him up.

3744
07:09:38,340 --> 07:09:40,340
I'll fuck him up.

3745
07:09:40,340 --> 07:09:42,340
I'll fuck him up.

3746
07:09:42,340 --> 07:09:44,340
I'll blow him up.

3747
07:09:46,340 --> 07:09:48,340
Uh oh.

3748
07:09:50,340 --> 07:09:52,340
It's like that slog that goes

3749
07:09:54,340 --> 07:09:56,340
really like 10 miles an hour

3750
07:09:56,340 --> 07:09:58,340
or whatever the heck

3751
07:09:58,340 --> 07:10:00,340
towards your location.

3752
07:10:00,340 --> 07:10:02,340
But you never know when it's coming

3753
07:10:02,340 --> 07:10:04,340
and it's just one of those fucking things.

3754
07:10:08,340 --> 07:10:10,340
They might want the Patreon link.

3755
07:10:12,340 --> 07:10:14,340
Patreon link is in the description below, guys.

3756
07:10:14,340 --> 07:10:16,340
Oh, check out my new audio. It's coming out tonight.

3757
07:10:16,340 --> 07:10:18,340
I'll figure out which one it is.

3758
07:10:20,340 --> 07:10:22,340
Wait, hold on. I'll tell you right now.

3759
07:10:38,340 --> 07:10:40,340
The inevitable snail, precisely.

3760
07:10:40,340 --> 07:10:42,340
I don't know.

3761
07:10:42,340 --> 07:10:44,340
I don't know, because like it

3762
07:10:44,340 --> 07:10:46,340
management puts it up or like

3763
07:10:46,340 --> 07:10:48,340
strongly schedules it, so I don't

3764
07:10:48,340 --> 07:10:50,340
know exactly.

3765
07:10:50,340 --> 07:10:52,340
Put her down?

3766
07:10:52,340 --> 07:10:54,340
Okay, it's supposed to start loading right now.

3767
07:10:54,340 --> 07:10:56,340
I thought it was suspended for a second.

3768
07:10:56,340 --> 07:10:58,340
I was like, yay.

3769
07:11:04,340 --> 07:11:06,340
Oh.

3770
07:11:10,340 --> 07:11:12,340
Okay.

3771
07:11:16,340 --> 07:11:18,340
There is a schedule.

3772
07:11:22,340 --> 07:11:24,340
Okay.

3773
07:11:24,340 --> 07:11:26,340
What day is it?

3774
07:11:26,340 --> 07:11:28,340
What weekend is it?

3775
07:11:30,340 --> 07:11:32,340
GFTSU, their impressive milk collection.

3776
07:11:32,340 --> 07:11:34,340
GFTSU is actually into

3777
07:11:34,340 --> 07:11:36,340
awesome female superiors,

3778
07:11:36,340 --> 07:11:38,340
but it sounds like that makes me feel good.

3779
07:11:56,340 --> 07:11:58,340
I'm strawing the techie behind the girls.

3780
07:11:58,340 --> 07:12:00,340
Uh, yeah.

3781
07:12:00,340 --> 07:12:02,340
Sure.

3782
07:12:16,340 --> 07:12:18,340
Wait, guys.

3783
07:12:18,340 --> 07:12:20,340
Where's the next one?

3784
07:12:26,340 --> 07:12:28,340
I feel like I'm just replaying the game at a faster speed.

3785
07:12:28,340 --> 07:12:30,340
Except I'm not

3786
07:12:30,340 --> 07:12:32,340
faster.

3787
07:12:32,340 --> 07:12:34,340
Am I done?

3788
07:12:36,340 --> 07:12:38,340
I have to go top bar, right?

3789
07:12:38,340 --> 07:12:40,340
I thought I had to kill more than one.

3790
07:12:42,340 --> 07:12:44,340
I thought I had to kill three.

3791
07:12:46,340 --> 07:12:48,340
It gave me away those fucking worm things.

3792
07:12:50,340 --> 07:12:52,340
He just really wanted me to kill that one guy.

3793
07:12:52,340 --> 07:12:54,340
I thought I had to kill that one guy.

3794
07:12:56,340 --> 07:12:58,340
I thought I had to get some bloody maiden shit.

3795
07:13:00,340 --> 07:13:02,340
I have to go back to

3796
07:13:02,340 --> 07:13:04,340
that church

3797
07:13:04,340 --> 07:13:06,340
and then dip it in the maiden's blood, probably.

3798
07:13:08,340 --> 07:13:10,340
Where am I going?

3799
07:13:10,340 --> 07:13:12,340
Okay, wrong way.

3800
07:13:12,340 --> 07:13:14,340
That's where I'm going.

3801
07:13:14,340 --> 07:13:16,340
I don't have

3802
07:13:16,340 --> 07:13:18,340
any sense of

3803
07:13:18,340 --> 07:13:20,340
direction.

3804
07:13:20,340 --> 07:13:22,340
That's the next step? Okay.

3805
07:13:26,340 --> 07:13:28,340
Blood lady.

3806
07:13:30,340 --> 07:13:32,340
You're fun to watch. Good luck in the DLC.

3807
07:13:32,340 --> 07:13:34,340
Aw, thank you. Appreciate it.

3808
07:13:34,340 --> 07:13:36,340
I'm just a goofy little goobah.

3809
07:13:36,340 --> 07:13:38,340
Oh, it's your first super on a live stream.

3810
07:13:38,340 --> 07:13:40,340
I popped you a super cherry.

3811
07:13:44,340 --> 07:13:46,340
Thank you. Thank you.

3812
07:13:46,340 --> 07:13:48,340
Hey, Leos.

3813
07:13:48,340 --> 07:13:50,340
Hellos. Hellos.

3814
07:13:54,340 --> 07:13:56,340
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

3815
07:13:58,340 --> 07:14:00,340
Yeah.

3816
07:14:00,340 --> 07:14:02,340
Yeah.

3817
07:14:02,340 --> 07:14:04,340
Hello.

3818
07:14:04,340 --> 07:14:06,340
Vore.

3819
07:14:08,340 --> 07:14:10,340
Vore.

3820
07:14:10,340 --> 07:14:12,340
I have to speak with you. There's a weird guy.

3821
07:14:14,340 --> 07:14:16,340
Hi.

3822
07:14:16,340 --> 07:14:18,340
Is this the guy I gotta come get me?

3823
07:14:22,340 --> 07:14:24,340
It's so nice. Thank you.

3824
07:14:26,340 --> 07:14:28,340
I wonder what he looks like

3825
07:14:28,340 --> 07:14:30,340
without his mask on.

3826
07:14:30,340 --> 07:14:32,340
Why are you rubbing your hands together like that?

3827
07:14:34,340 --> 07:14:36,340
Aw, thank you.

3828
07:14:38,340 --> 07:14:40,340
Yeah, I'm totally not going to kill your god.

3829
07:14:40,340 --> 07:14:42,340
Dynasty.

3830
07:14:48,340 --> 07:14:50,340
Because he likes Micola.

3831
07:14:50,340 --> 07:14:52,340
He likes little...

3832
07:14:52,340 --> 07:14:54,340
Yeah.

3833
07:14:54,340 --> 07:14:56,340
Yeah.

3834
07:14:56,340 --> 07:14:58,340
Yeah.

3835
07:14:58,340 --> 07:15:00,340
Yeah.

3836
07:15:00,340 --> 07:15:02,340
Yeah.

3837
07:15:02,340 --> 07:15:04,340
Yeah.

3838
07:15:04,340 --> 07:15:06,340
Yeah.

3839
07:15:06,340 --> 07:15:08,340
Yeah.

3840
07:15:08,340 --> 07:15:10,340
Yeah.

3841
07:15:10,340 --> 07:15:12,340
Who would have a...

3842
07:15:12,340 --> 07:15:14,340
I mean, I can't say that.

3843
07:15:18,340 --> 07:15:20,340
I thought I'd get...

3844
07:15:20,340 --> 07:15:22,340
How'd I get the...

3845
07:15:22,340 --> 07:15:24,340
Okay.

3846
07:15:24,340 --> 07:15:26,340
Ermm.

3847
07:15:32,340 --> 07:15:34,340
Yeah, it broke a long time ago.

3848
07:15:34,340 --> 07:15:36,340
I don't know why he's breaking lately.

3849
07:15:38,340 --> 07:15:40,340
Oh, it broke.

3850
07:16:02,340 --> 07:16:04,340
Damn, it does not want to work.

3851
07:16:04,340 --> 07:16:06,340
Usually, I can just refresh the...

3852
07:16:06,340 --> 07:16:08,340
source.

3853
07:16:12,340 --> 07:16:14,340
Does my stream die?

3854
07:16:14,340 --> 07:16:16,340
I think I'm fine, aren't I?

3855
07:16:16,340 --> 07:16:18,340
Did my stream die?

3856
07:16:18,340 --> 07:16:20,340
I think I'm fine, aren't I?

3857
07:16:30,340 --> 07:16:32,340
Yeah, this is where I just want to work.

3858
07:16:32,340 --> 07:16:34,340
Oh, there we go.

3859
07:16:34,340 --> 07:16:36,340
Back here.

3860
07:16:46,340 --> 07:16:48,340
Yeah.

3861
07:17:12,340 --> 07:17:14,340
I'm trying to fix it.

3862
07:17:14,340 --> 07:17:16,340
Yeah, this looks gross.

3863
07:17:16,340 --> 07:17:18,340
I have to make it look like it was before.

3864
07:17:18,340 --> 07:17:20,340
Because I always have to generate a link.

3865
07:17:32,340 --> 07:17:34,340
I'll put it in Comic Sans.

3866
07:17:44,340 --> 07:17:46,340
Okay, looks a little bit wonky.

3867
07:18:04,340 --> 07:18:06,340
It's funny, because it works.

3868
07:18:06,340 --> 07:18:08,340
It sounds like I'm talking into a fan.

3869
07:18:14,340 --> 07:18:16,340
Why does it sound like I'm talking into a fan?

3870
07:18:16,340 --> 07:18:18,340
What the fuck?

3871
07:18:22,340 --> 07:18:24,340
It's still not working.

3872
07:18:44,340 --> 07:18:46,340
It does not want to work.

3873
07:19:14,340 --> 07:19:16,340
Okay.

3874
07:19:40,340 --> 07:19:42,340
It's like very delayed.

3875
07:19:44,340 --> 07:19:46,340
Okay.

3876
07:19:48,340 --> 07:19:50,340
That's so weird.

3877
07:19:50,340 --> 07:19:52,340
I wonder why it's doing that.

3878
07:20:04,340 --> 07:20:06,340
And even if there was a fan,

3879
07:20:06,340 --> 07:20:08,340
y'all spilling eyelash,

3880
07:20:08,340 --> 07:20:10,340
why is the microphone...

3881
07:20:10,340 --> 07:20:12,340
Did it actually bump my...

3882
07:20:12,340 --> 07:20:14,340
weird?

3883
07:20:14,340 --> 07:20:16,340
Oh, it was when I was really distant.

3884
07:20:16,340 --> 07:20:18,340
Oh, it was because I was

3885
07:20:18,340 --> 07:20:20,340
when I lay down here.

3886
07:20:20,340 --> 07:20:22,340
Yeah.

3887
07:20:30,340 --> 07:20:32,340
I sound fine.

3888
07:20:32,340 --> 07:20:34,340
Oh, that's nice.

3889
07:20:34,340 --> 07:20:36,340
Why did nobody tell me

3890
07:20:36,340 --> 07:20:38,340
that since I played the video

3891
07:20:38,340 --> 07:20:40,340
to find where something was

3892
07:20:40,340 --> 07:20:42,340
needed?

3893
07:20:42,340 --> 07:20:44,340
Why didn't anybody tell me

3894
07:20:44,340 --> 07:20:46,340
that I didn't turn my desktop audio

3895
07:20:46,340 --> 07:20:48,340
back on?

3896
07:20:50,340 --> 07:20:52,340
What's wrong with you?

3897
07:21:04,340 --> 07:21:06,340
Because I may be.

3898
07:21:06,340 --> 07:21:08,340
I was scared.

3899
07:21:10,340 --> 07:21:12,340
Oh.

3900
07:21:12,340 --> 07:21:14,340
Because my voice is cute.

3901
07:21:30,340 --> 07:21:32,340
You could hear Vari, though?

3902
07:21:32,340 --> 07:21:34,340
What?

3903
07:21:34,340 --> 07:21:36,340
What the fuck is going on in my game sound, then?

3904
07:21:36,340 --> 07:21:38,340
Because it was literally

3905
07:21:38,340 --> 07:21:40,340
I had like...

3906
07:21:42,340 --> 07:21:44,340
I had set it as off.

3907
07:21:46,340 --> 07:21:48,340
That's weird.

3908
07:21:48,340 --> 07:21:50,340
Why did I still have audio then?

3909
07:21:50,340 --> 07:21:52,340
Oh, maybe it was like...

3910
07:21:54,340 --> 07:21:56,340
I don't know. I give up.

3911
07:21:56,340 --> 07:21:58,340
I don't care that much.

3912
07:21:58,340 --> 07:22:00,340
It's a show that was muted for me

3913
07:22:00,340 --> 07:22:02,340
on OBS.

3914
07:22:02,340 --> 07:22:04,340
Okay.

3915
07:22:04,340 --> 07:22:06,340
I don't think I'm going to be able to make chat work.

3916
07:22:08,340 --> 07:22:10,340
Okay.

3917
07:22:14,340 --> 07:22:16,340
Oh.

3918
07:22:16,340 --> 07:22:18,340
Now it works.

3919
07:22:28,340 --> 07:22:30,340
I don't know why that works,

3920
07:22:30,340 --> 07:22:32,340
although I just kept refreshing it

3921
07:22:32,340 --> 07:22:34,340
over and over and over again.

3922
07:22:34,340 --> 07:22:36,340
My first jinx.

3923
07:22:36,340 --> 07:22:38,340
My toes are cold. Come suck on them.

3924
07:22:50,340 --> 07:22:52,340
He doesn't know that I have a maiden.

3925
07:22:58,340 --> 07:23:00,340
Alright, let's go to...

3926
07:23:00,340 --> 07:23:02,340
Where was it?

3927
07:23:02,340 --> 07:23:04,340
Er...

3928
07:23:07,340 --> 07:23:09,340
Backstreet's back.

3929
07:23:09,340 --> 07:23:11,340
Alright.

3930
07:23:11,340 --> 07:23:13,340
Can I just fucking...

3931
07:23:13,340 --> 07:23:15,340
Do you want to get from Missle?

3932
07:23:15,340 --> 07:23:17,340
Missle? Where was that?

3933
07:23:17,340 --> 07:23:19,340
It was in Caled, wasn't it?

3934
07:23:25,340 --> 07:23:27,340
That was near the Frenzy Village.

3935
07:23:33,340 --> 07:23:35,340
Wasn't that up here?

3936
07:23:35,340 --> 07:23:37,340
I'm like, where was it?

3937
07:23:42,340 --> 07:23:44,340
Was it the Second Church of America?

3938
07:23:47,340 --> 07:23:49,340
Was it the Ernie?

3939
07:23:49,340 --> 07:23:51,340
Oh yeah, you're right.

3940
07:23:51,340 --> 07:23:53,340
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

3941
07:23:55,340 --> 07:23:57,340
The Church of inhibition?

3942
07:24:05,340 --> 07:24:07,340
I kind of remember...

3943
07:24:07,340 --> 07:24:09,340
I always... I always...

3944
07:24:09,340 --> 07:24:11,340
I keep confusing the Church of inhibition

3945
07:24:11,340 --> 07:24:13,340
where the church is, where the turtle is at.

3946
07:24:13,340 --> 07:24:15,340
That's why.

3947
07:24:15,340 --> 07:24:17,340
I don't know why I keep thinking the turtle is here.

3948
07:24:21,340 --> 07:24:23,340
Thank you.

3949
07:24:25,340 --> 07:24:27,340
It is...

3950
07:24:29,340 --> 07:24:31,340
I wish my eye would stop twitching.

3951
07:24:35,340 --> 07:24:37,340
Thanks for watching.

3952
07:24:37,340 --> 07:24:39,340
I hope you enjoyed it.

3953
07:24:42,340 --> 07:24:44,340
Okay.

3954
07:24:47,340 --> 07:24:49,340
I'm going to...

3955
07:24:49,340 --> 07:24:51,340
I'm going to...

3956
07:24:51,340 --> 07:24:53,340
I'm going to...

3957
07:24:53,340 --> 07:24:55,340
I'm going to...

3958
07:24:55,340 --> 07:24:57,340
I'm going to...

3959
07:24:59,340 --> 07:25:01,340
I'm going to...

3960
07:25:01,340 --> 07:25:03,340
I'm going to...

3961
07:25:03,340 --> 07:25:11,420
I'm surprised I accidentally ran into the little pillar that has what's-her-face on it.

3962
07:25:11,420 --> 07:25:32,460
It was like, I'm secretly a salamander person thing area, which is another name I almost

3963
07:25:32,460 --> 07:25:36,980
called Fia, but I'm like, I don't... I didn't like her that much. What's happening here?

3964
07:25:36,980 --> 07:25:46,220
That guy doesn't have a head. Oh, what? What's happening? Oh, stop it. I don't like that I

3965
07:25:46,220 --> 07:26:11,300
can get aggroed right over here. That was just really funny. I just, I always wanted to see if there

3966
07:26:11,620 --> 07:26:40,980
was a pillow. I need another pillow. Put my arm on. I'm bothered. I didn't even know

3967
07:26:40,980 --> 07:26:54,020
there's a fucking stake America here. Uh, yoink. Okay, do I have enough to level up? I need 16.

3968
07:26:54,020 --> 07:27:17,860
Oh, I can get 16. I can get 16. I wish I selected two, but it's fine. Oh, damn it. I didn't mean to talk to you.

3969
07:27:17,860 --> 07:27:23,860
Luminary Moog!

3970
07:27:31,860 --> 07:27:35,220
Are you gonna cut off my finger when I do something for this?

3971
07:27:48,820 --> 07:27:51,220
Sorry, hold on a moment.

3972
07:27:51,220 --> 07:28:17,620
This looks so funny because he's not really doing anything.

3973
07:28:22,180 --> 07:28:34,020
Luminary Moog! Off her finger.

3974
07:28:39,220 --> 07:28:43,620
I thought he was gonna say cream. I always be like, yeah, you know, I got some sweet cream.

3975
07:28:43,620 --> 07:28:52,580
If you do, I do say so myself. Let me go to here for a second.

3976
07:28:56,340 --> 07:28:57,780
This is a little nasty.

3977
07:29:02,580 --> 07:29:03,060
All right.

3978
07:29:07,780 --> 07:29:10,900
What am I doing? Oh, it's my cat's food.

3979
07:29:14,340 --> 07:29:18,900
Are you kidding me? I need like 50 runes.

3980
07:29:25,540 --> 07:29:29,540
It's freedom time. I'm gonna turn the lights like a fuck suit.

3981
07:29:29,540 --> 07:29:42,900
All he has in question, when he's coming out from somewhere, he was like, oh, and then

3982
07:29:43,780 --> 07:29:47,460
Raina's still napping. Raina, go eat.

3983
07:29:47,620 --> 07:29:57,620
Do you accept cat food by any chance?

3984
07:30:06,100 --> 07:30:08,660
Did he not give me the badge yet? What do you mean the badge?

3985
07:30:09,460 --> 07:30:13,460
Yeah.

3986
07:30:23,540 --> 07:30:24,420
I mean the badge.

3987
07:30:30,100 --> 07:30:33,460
Oh, yeah, you're right.

3988
07:30:38,900 --> 07:30:41,780
Maybe I need to talk to him again. Maybe I didn't exhaust my...

3989
07:30:46,820 --> 07:30:55,460
That's right. It's the badge. I don't know why I thought it was the bloody finger.

3990
07:31:01,620 --> 07:31:04,420
I probably didn't exhaust the dialogue.

3991
07:31:08,900 --> 07:31:25,380
All right. I don't have a badge.

3992
07:31:29,380 --> 07:31:30,420
Wow.

3993
07:31:39,300 --> 07:31:54,020
Oh, that's so crazy. Wow. Wow. Wow.

3994
07:31:54,020 --> 07:32:10,020
He's in front of me. You must wait. I'm there. All right. Let's see if I can remember.

3995
07:32:24,100 --> 07:32:28,020
Let's see if I can remember how to get there.

3996
07:32:38,740 --> 07:32:41,620
It's because I had been sitting there for hours and hours.

3997
07:32:46,180 --> 07:32:53,220
Pardon me. You guys look like you're doing well. Really nice. So happy for you. Oh, thank you.

3998
07:32:54,980 --> 07:32:57,220
Sorry. Pardon me.

3999
07:33:08,340 --> 07:33:09,220
He has a slug.

4000
07:33:09,220 --> 07:33:22,900
I don't know what you guys are worshipping, but good for you.

4001
07:33:30,740 --> 07:33:31,860
That was a big boy.

4002
07:33:32,740 --> 07:33:37,060
Existing. You're just on the walking tip.

4003
07:33:42,340 --> 07:33:43,060
That's there.

4004
07:33:50,100 --> 07:33:56,260
I never get what's down here. Oh, yeah, that's right. More sanguine dudes.

4005
07:33:56,660 --> 07:34:04,820
Oh, hey. What are you doing up here? No.

4006
07:34:12,260 --> 07:34:13,460
Who will what this?

4007
07:34:27,220 --> 07:34:28,820
No.

4008
07:34:49,780 --> 07:34:51,780
Fucking hell. Oh, no.

4009
07:34:57,220 --> 07:34:58,260
Yeah, I got the mimic.

4010
07:35:02,740 --> 07:35:07,780
And like, it's not going to even teleport me at the grace. Yeah, okay, I gotta go back because

4011
07:35:10,180 --> 07:35:11,780
it's annoying.

4012
07:35:26,260 --> 07:35:35,780
Can you?

4013
07:35:36,180 --> 07:35:53,300
Like, oh, it didn't let me spawn at the church America.

4014
07:36:01,140 --> 07:36:02,900
So happy I got a lantern before this.

4015
07:36:06,740 --> 07:36:26,820
Why is he so fucking fast for no reason?

4016
07:36:27,780 --> 07:36:33,860
Oh, please.

4017
07:36:42,660 --> 07:36:47,860
I just want to be like, oh my god. What's this?

4018
07:36:56,820 --> 07:37:23,860
I need to be over here.

4019
07:37:26,820 --> 07:37:37,460
What the fuck is this guy?

4020
07:37:41,220 --> 07:37:41,860
What is this?

4021
07:37:45,780 --> 07:37:49,460
I'm in the wrong spot. Sorry.

4022
07:37:49,460 --> 07:37:56,900
Hold on. My ear is itchy.

4023
07:38:05,940 --> 07:38:10,660
Oh, I don't want to do mob. I'm trying to get to the fucking... ow.

4024
07:38:10,660 --> 07:38:18,100
I'm going to kill me with the time I get over there.

4025
07:38:20,820 --> 07:38:27,300
Oh, I went the wrong way. I'm like, this doesn't look familiar.

4026
07:38:40,660 --> 07:38:57,300
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to remember where it is.

4027
07:39:10,980 --> 07:39:27,300
You know, that's where I came from. Why is this guy still aggroing me?

4028
07:39:27,300 --> 07:39:51,940
You can't see me. I know, I need to go over here.

4029
07:39:57,380 --> 07:40:09,140
Oh, it's fucking this way. Oh, I forgot. I know where it is.

4030
07:40:13,620 --> 07:40:23,940
I forgot it's in the opposite direction.

4031
07:40:27,300 --> 07:40:41,220
Nope, I'm in the wrong spot again.

4032
07:40:44,820 --> 07:40:48,980
I'm in the wrong spot again. Yeah, because that's it.

4033
07:40:49,780 --> 07:40:53,620
Oh, yeah, because this is where you get invaded by the fucking white masks.

4034
07:40:54,980 --> 07:40:55,780
Oh, that's fucking...

4035
07:41:00,980 --> 07:41:04,900
That's right.

4036
07:41:04,900 --> 07:41:26,820
Oh, I can't use it until I... where am I going? I can drop it this way, it's fine.

4037
07:41:26,820 --> 07:41:35,780
I remember getting there.

4038
07:41:37,700 --> 07:41:39,780
Oh, I can't pick it up.

4039
07:41:41,140 --> 07:41:43,460
Because you avoid the little skeletors.

4040
07:41:44,420 --> 07:41:45,940
Yeah, go over here.

4041
07:41:49,940 --> 07:41:52,340
I remember seeing them and being like absolutely terrified.

4042
07:41:53,300 --> 07:41:59,780
I forget which way you go. It's not this way, because that's where you get raided.

4043
07:42:02,020 --> 07:42:07,940
Then you cut through over here.

4044
07:42:12,180 --> 07:42:12,900
Oh, that's a lie.

4045
07:42:13,140 --> 07:42:15,140
Yeah.

4046
07:42:20,580 --> 07:42:22,180
Over here, yeah, that's right.

4047
07:42:38,180 --> 07:42:42,260
Let's go! Where the fuck did the dudes all go?

4048
07:42:43,860 --> 07:42:54,500
Oh, they're on this down this way, I forgot.

4049
07:43:05,060 --> 07:43:08,980
I'm surprised I'm actually doing okay at level 50. I'm not going to lie to you.

4050
07:43:09,940 --> 07:43:16,260
Before I... I just wanted to grab this first, and I don't really care about my runes.

4051
07:43:17,380 --> 07:43:19,380
And then I want...

4052
07:43:24,340 --> 07:43:25,780
So, we heard that it's underground.

4053
07:43:29,140 --> 07:43:34,580
I want to go to the round table.

4054
07:43:39,220 --> 07:43:48,580
Oh, wrong way. I thought I almost had it.

4055
07:43:49,460 --> 07:43:52,100
D, you destroyed. Fuck. D, it's your fault.

4056
07:43:52,100 --> 07:43:57,700
I'm happy I didn't do that anyways. I don't have any fucking glove word.

4057
07:44:22,340 --> 07:44:27,460
I wish I could buy glove word.

4058
07:44:29,460 --> 07:44:31,620
You need to grind to level 140-ish? Yeah.

4059
07:44:39,540 --> 07:44:43,380
I can't believe you doubted me. How could you, me, of all people?

4060
07:44:44,180 --> 07:44:58,820
Well, I guess this is where we yapp together. This is the yapping portion of the stream where I grind stuff out.

4061
07:45:04,340 --> 07:45:09,940
I don't have an eighth. I mean a seventh. God damn it. I thought I had a seven. That doesn't matter.

4062
07:45:14,260 --> 07:45:16,260
I need to hurry. I need to hurry.

4063
07:45:22,260 --> 07:45:25,060
Yeah, I don't know why they allow the Dung Eater just to hang out.

4064
07:45:29,060 --> 07:45:31,060
Like he's like literally generally horrible.

4065
07:45:43,460 --> 07:45:48,100
How do I use the Mimic?

4066
07:45:51,780 --> 07:45:54,660
He isn't technically there. That's true, but still.

4067
07:45:56,900 --> 07:46:02,180
Yapping portion of the can at once. The love sum. Come, Eater.

4068
07:46:05,620 --> 07:46:07,060
Oh, did I roll into something over here?

4069
07:46:07,060 --> 07:46:15,620
I remember someone like bowed. I remember seeing someone just like gesture,

4070
07:46:16,500 --> 07:46:20,820
like email in front of the fucking armor. I think that was so funny. That was always funny to me.

4071
07:46:25,060 --> 07:46:28,820
I don't know how people email when they leave a message. I never figured that out.

4072
07:46:29,060 --> 07:46:37,620
Okay, if it's done, you don't have to worry about plumbing.

4073
07:46:42,580 --> 07:46:46,580
I should probably buy some arrows.

4074
07:46:46,580 --> 07:47:04,340
Oh, I have just like random shit.

4075
07:47:04,740 --> 07:47:18,100
I need strength.

4076
07:47:18,500 --> 07:47:32,820
That's so stupid.

4077
07:47:38,980 --> 07:47:43,860
Still have a heavy load.

4078
07:47:48,180 --> 07:47:52,340
Yeah, okay, I'm wearing PJs.

4079
07:47:55,540 --> 07:47:58,980
Sore seal in two hands. You're probably right. Yeah, that's a good idea.

4080
07:48:03,300 --> 07:48:09,860
I don't, I don't know if that'll do it though.

4081
07:48:10,420 --> 07:48:21,620
Does the sore seal give you five?

4082
07:48:27,460 --> 07:48:31,620
Yeah, it won't be enough.

4083
07:48:40,420 --> 07:48:45,060
Godric room. Yeah, I got that.

4084
07:48:47,300 --> 07:48:53,700
If I do that and I pop that, well, it's not like I don't need to use it appropriately.

4085
07:48:53,700 --> 07:49:01,620
I just need people to just shoot it.

4086
07:49:09,860 --> 07:49:21,620
Okay.

4087
07:49:26,420 --> 07:49:31,620
Why can I, can I not dual wield?

4088
07:49:31,620 --> 07:49:37,860
Yeah, let's do right that then.

4089
07:49:44,740 --> 07:49:46,660
Can't do it in, oh, that makes sense.

4090
07:49:51,860 --> 07:49:53,380
I'm like, where is it?

4091
07:50:01,620 --> 07:50:23,380
I'm just stupid. I'm just gonna do this to make my life easier.

4092
07:50:32,580 --> 07:50:47,380
What the fuck was that?

4093
07:50:50,980 --> 07:50:53,380
Left bumper aim. Oh, that's right.

4094
07:51:01,620 --> 07:51:13,780
Fuck, I miss.

4095
07:51:19,300 --> 07:51:23,380
Oh my god.

4096
07:51:23,380 --> 07:51:37,140
Yep, this will be fun. I should probably go buy arrows.

4097
07:51:37,140 --> 07:51:46,340
What a dummy.

4098
07:51:51,380 --> 07:51:55,700
You're the gold. Fuck, I don't want the gold scarab because I'm like, wait, usually you get more than

4099
07:51:55,700 --> 07:51:59,220
this. Oh, where's the gold scarab?

4100
07:52:05,780 --> 07:52:07,860
Where's the gold scarab?

4101
07:52:10,420 --> 07:52:11,620
How am I going to eat me?

4102
07:52:13,540 --> 07:52:22,180
In a dungeon in Caled. Oh, brother, it's, it's, it,

4103
07:52:22,180 --> 07:52:27,700
is it that one? It's that one, right?

4104
07:52:31,060 --> 07:52:31,940
Pretty sure it's this one.

4105
07:52:40,980 --> 07:52:43,780
Behind the dual, yeah, it's by the crystal bitches.

4106
07:52:44,260 --> 07:52:51,860
We're doing this first before I get the fourth talisman slot.

4107
07:53:03,940 --> 07:53:07,380
I'm gonna have to cut across to get on the other side here.

4108
07:53:13,860 --> 07:53:23,380
I may not fucking kill myself.

4109
07:53:35,220 --> 07:53:39,380
It's over there. It's on the other side.

4110
07:53:44,100 --> 07:53:51,060
I don't have the dragon barrow. Oh, this one. That's a smoldering wall.

4111
07:53:54,980 --> 07:53:57,620
What? Isn't the dragon barrow one? That's the great bridge.

4112
07:54:02,580 --> 07:54:05,380
I think I can make this jump.

4113
07:54:06,100 --> 07:54:18,980
Well, I definitely can't make the jump.

4114
07:54:23,860 --> 07:54:32,980
I wish I could just go over here and just like loop up and around. That just makes my life a lot easier.

4115
07:54:35,460 --> 07:54:50,980
Yeah, you can raise it just a lot closer.

4116
07:54:51,540 --> 07:55:00,580
Okay, let's do this first, just so I don't freaking kill myself for all.

4117
07:55:05,620 --> 07:55:12,580
Let's put this bad boy away. She's, she's a little bit big.

4118
07:55:13,220 --> 07:55:26,180
How's it hanging? That's going pretty good. I'm starting to go nonverbal because I'm EP.

4119
07:55:26,180 --> 07:55:39,940
No, not like this.

4120
07:55:39,940 --> 07:55:47,700
Let's not go live instead.

4121
07:55:47,700 --> 07:55:55,860
Ha ha.

4122
07:56:01,220 --> 07:56:03,460
He's staring at nonverbal, madam.

4123
07:56:03,460 --> 07:56:15,220
Ha ha.

4124
07:56:16,340 --> 07:56:17,220
Did I wake you up?

4125
07:56:21,060 --> 07:56:22,660
No, wait, I meant to go to the last

4126
07:56:23,540 --> 07:56:27,460
Christ visiting because it's just gonna teleport me down there. Sometimes I'd purposely throw

4127
07:56:27,460 --> 07:56:33,700
myself off a cliff to get to a like a steak America. Yeah, because now I'm fucking down here.

4128
07:56:42,100 --> 07:56:49,220
Wake me up. Wake me up. So save me.

4129
07:56:58,420 --> 07:57:03,220
Come on.

4130
07:57:15,460 --> 07:57:20,260
Madam, madam's thing is pretty. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, what's a fucking

4131
07:57:20,580 --> 07:57:26,900
bed doll? Oh, that's a fucking sleepy lady. Where am I going? Where did you come from?

4132
07:57:26,900 --> 07:57:30,100
Where did you go? Where did you come from? Oh my god. Where are you?

4133
07:57:36,660 --> 07:57:40,020
I just lost 11,000 runes, bro.

4134
07:57:50,660 --> 07:57:59,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

4135
07:58:02,420 --> 07:58:07,060
I remember distinctly this happening before too when I was going

4136
07:58:09,060 --> 07:58:09,860
to this part.

4137
07:58:12,740 --> 07:58:15,700
Hi, Boomi. How can I help you handsome boy?

4138
07:58:16,100 --> 07:58:20,980
Are they a bird up here? No.

4139
07:58:23,140 --> 07:58:27,460
How did I not aggro the thing before? I don't get that.

4140
07:58:33,540 --> 07:58:39,780
All right, let's just walk. How about that? Let's just walk. Oh my god, Boomi.

4141
07:58:40,580 --> 07:58:51,540
Oh, oh my kitty. No, please. Why do you walk on my boob? You're still standing on my boobs.

4142
07:58:52,180 --> 07:58:57,380
Oh my god. Stop. Go away.

4143
07:59:04,420 --> 07:59:09,140
Why have you done this to me? What are you doing? I'm going to hold you like a baby.

4144
07:59:10,740 --> 07:59:19,700
Now you're stuck with me like this in baby mode. No, don't leave me. You can't leave now.

4145
07:59:19,700 --> 07:59:22,900
You're in baby mode. You have to be held like a little baby.

4146
07:59:25,220 --> 07:59:33,860
And I can give you scratches. Why are you so heavy? You're like this feels like your way as much as a toddler.

4147
07:59:34,820 --> 07:59:40,100
Why are you so big? Why did you become like that? Why are you looking at me?

4148
07:59:41,780 --> 07:59:43,140
Why won't you make eye contact with me?

4149
07:59:47,700 --> 07:59:52,020
He's like leaning away like mother, please. There you go.

4150
07:59:55,700 --> 07:59:58,820
Let's look into the snack box and see what we got. Shall we, Boomi?

4151
07:59:59,140 --> 08:00:01,700
Oh, don't attack my headphones.

4152
08:00:03,940 --> 08:00:10,820
Where's this? Like a little biscuit. It is called Delos and it is cappuccino flavored.

4153
08:00:13,860 --> 08:00:17,780
Boomi in baby mode. Yeah, Boomi in baby mode is literally just like holding him like he's the

4154
08:00:17,780 --> 08:00:22,260
baby and it's like he's on his back as the leggies are sticking out.

4155
08:00:22,580 --> 08:00:26,660
Marina and Boomi are just sniffing each other.

4156
08:00:35,300 --> 08:00:37,220
Marina, you look like you're about to hop up here.

4157
08:00:38,180 --> 08:00:43,140
Yeah, cappuccino.

4158
08:00:51,780 --> 08:00:58,980
How can this happen to me and me? I'm rubbing my eyes.

4159
08:00:59,940 --> 08:01:07,540
I'm fading. No, Marina, you're in the way.

4160
08:01:16,740 --> 08:01:21,860
Shut up. I don't need your sass. I didn't mean to press that.

4161
08:01:22,500 --> 08:01:26,740
Marina, get out. All I see is cat butt and a tail. Oh my god.

4162
08:01:30,900 --> 08:01:32,340
Marina just kicked the microphone.

4163
08:01:35,060 --> 08:01:46,740
Why are you flicking your tail? She's mad because I put her on the ground.

4164
08:01:52,740 --> 08:01:58,740
She's like, what the fuck?

4165
08:02:01,860 --> 08:02:02,260
All right.

4166
08:02:07,380 --> 08:02:10,740
Berry carefully.

4167
08:02:11,060 --> 08:02:26,260
Berry carefully. Jump. You made it.

4168
08:02:31,860 --> 08:02:38,340
Oh, good luck. I'm sure you're, I don't have to wish you luck because I'm sure you'll pass.

4169
08:02:38,580 --> 08:02:41,860
You don't need any luck. You got this.

4170
08:02:44,100 --> 08:02:50,020
A different moment from switching rooms. How is she? I'm fine. I'm here. I'm in the abandoned cave.

4171
08:02:53,140 --> 08:02:54,180
Feeling abandoned.

4172
08:03:04,260 --> 08:03:07,300
Okay, I'm just going to run to the boss room. I think I remember where the boss room is.

4173
08:03:08,820 --> 08:03:19,300
I remember doing the whole farm thing. It was more of the more recent things I had done in the game.

4174
08:03:24,820 --> 08:03:35,620
All right. Nothing I need to do that. Oh, fuck. I need, I need, I forgot. I need bloodhound step.

4175
08:03:39,300 --> 08:03:47,300
Oh, that's not the right one. Damn it.

4176
08:03:55,300 --> 08:03:56,020
I forgot.

4177
08:03:59,220 --> 08:04:04,500
I forgot that usually I would use just bloodhound step with this.

4178
08:04:09,300 --> 08:04:12,180
Is it shub over? Just a little bit.

4179
08:04:16,660 --> 08:04:21,060
I thought the staunching bowl was this for the right ones. Oh, this is going to be annoying.

4180
08:04:22,420 --> 08:04:25,620
I'm not going to go all the way to do that.

4181
08:04:29,380 --> 08:04:31,060
To do that, get that ash of war.

4182
08:04:38,980 --> 08:04:44,260
Yeah, digrow the quick step. No. That's what I meant. I'm sorry.

4183
08:04:48,820 --> 08:04:54,500
I thought I had the right boluses. I forgot. I had actually prepared for this. I didn't just jump in.

4184
08:04:58,020 --> 08:05:01,620
Oh, no. We totally have the fungus armor. What are you talking about?

4185
08:05:04,580 --> 08:05:06,420
I also don't have any fucking boluses.

4186
08:05:08,340 --> 08:05:27,940
I don't have any fucking cookbooks.

4187
08:05:31,460 --> 08:05:34,020
I suppose we're going to do a quick store run

4188
08:05:34,980 --> 08:05:37,780
to Caled. Oh, I can't leave.

4189
08:05:42,900 --> 08:05:45,060
At least I got the grace to care about.

4190
08:05:47,780 --> 08:05:53,620
It's funny that you can teleport from like, whatchamacallit.

4191
08:06:04,500 --> 08:06:10,980
Sounded like something was leaking in my bathroom. Ever get what I was saying?

4192
08:06:14,500 --> 08:06:18,100
No, I haven't been buying cookbooks. I've just been, I haven't been doing anything.

4193
08:06:23,220 --> 08:06:23,620
Hi.

4194
08:06:30,020 --> 08:06:31,620
Okay, so I can get those from you.

4195
08:06:34,020 --> 08:06:51,940
Oh, it's like I have to do so much shit in order to prepare for the fucking DLC.

4196
08:06:51,940 --> 08:06:53,620
I should have just played through the game again.

4197
08:06:54,580 --> 08:06:57,700
I was kidding. It'd be like a hundred hours.

4198
08:07:06,820 --> 08:07:07,780
You want me to butterfly?

4199
08:07:14,900 --> 08:07:18,340
Why did I do that? I didn't mean to press that. I meant to press that way.

4200
08:07:24,580 --> 08:07:29,220
Where do you, I have Reduvia, so I do have a dagger.

4201
08:07:30,900 --> 08:07:32,580
Oh fuck, but I can't put it on that.

4202
08:07:35,540 --> 08:07:36,500
Jody Daggers.

4203
08:07:41,860 --> 08:07:43,380
You don't, you're useless to me.

4204
08:07:54,180 --> 08:08:00,420
It's a journey and that's okay. I just like, I just, that's why I was always, I didn't know

4205
08:08:00,420 --> 08:08:06,900
whether or not I wanted to replay Elden Ring just because I'd have to do all this shit.

4206
08:08:07,540 --> 08:08:11,060
But I'm glad. I'm actually having lots of fun spending time with you guys.

4207
08:08:11,060 --> 08:08:24,340
I went the wrong way.

4208
08:08:30,420 --> 08:08:31,540
I know I did it, I'm fine.

4209
08:08:31,940 --> 08:08:38,820
Okay, Lude.

4210
08:08:44,740 --> 08:08:48,660
This is more yapping time. Yeah, but I want to get play the DLC guys.

4211
08:08:54,900 --> 08:08:56,820
You also don't have a dagger.

4212
08:09:01,940 --> 08:09:13,940
I like how this negates fire, but this is, this is funny.

4213
08:09:17,860 --> 08:09:20,820
I could get this for my outfit.

4214
08:09:28,420 --> 08:09:28,820
Bye-bye.

4215
08:09:31,700 --> 08:09:33,860
Lady from Round Table Shirtle Dagger, you're right.

4216
08:09:36,740 --> 08:09:37,380
What am I doing?

4217
08:09:42,420 --> 08:09:45,620
I placed that little cookie thing down somewhere and I don't know where it went.

4218
08:09:46,820 --> 08:09:52,420
I like never ate it. I just placed it on the ground, or not on the ground. Did I put it back

4219
08:09:52,420 --> 08:09:57,220
in the box? I swear I took it out. I have no idea where it went. I like put it somewhere.

4220
08:09:57,220 --> 08:09:59,700
Oh, it was next to me. It's like right next to my butt.

4221
08:10:00,660 --> 08:10:07,780
I'm like, I wanted to try this cappuccino cookie. Oh, it smells so good.

4222
08:10:08,660 --> 08:10:14,100
I wish I had coffee to make to eat this with it. Wait, I do have coffee to make to eat this with it.

4223
08:10:16,100 --> 08:10:19,460
Should I? Should I?

4224
08:10:24,500 --> 08:10:25,940
Should I make some coffee?

4225
08:10:30,100 --> 08:10:34,100
Hmm.

4226
08:10:45,540 --> 08:10:48,980
Let me not do this. Let me not drink coffee

4227
08:10:51,620 --> 08:10:54,100
at 10 p.m. because then I won't be able to sleep.

4228
08:11:00,660 --> 08:11:01,700
Am I going the right way?

4229
08:11:10,980 --> 08:11:14,980
I don't have any fucking money. Wait, let me see. Do you have a fucking dagger? You do. Okay.

4230
08:11:20,500 --> 08:11:25,220
I didn't see how much it was. How much is it?

4231
08:11:25,780 --> 08:11:32,740
400. Okay. I was about to drop 2000 for no reason.

4232
08:11:45,220 --> 08:11:51,700
99. Sleep tight. Don't let the madam bite. Just kidding. Let me bite.

4233
08:11:52,580 --> 08:11:57,060
I always wondered, what was this about? I never used it.

4234
08:12:01,380 --> 08:12:04,740
This one, like I know when you raid someone, like turns you into the host,

4235
08:12:04,740 --> 08:12:09,780
but does it like get rid of stuff? I don't know. And then this one as well.

4236
08:12:11,940 --> 08:12:14,900
You can like just, why would you want to do that?

4237
08:12:15,700 --> 08:12:25,540
You still look like a normal human. It's a troll item. Oh, it does get rid of your red aura?

4238
08:12:25,540 --> 08:12:29,300
That's funny. Hi, boo-me. Hi, boo-me.

4239
08:12:33,220 --> 08:12:35,620
Yeah, get your exercise. Nice job.

4240
08:12:39,220 --> 08:12:42,500
So like, am I the only person that can see him because he's technically not here?

4241
08:12:43,220 --> 08:12:48,820
But there's like just a bunch of shit in the library anyways.

4242
08:12:51,140 --> 08:12:58,820
It's really just like, is anybody like concerned about the absolutely gore that's in this room?

4243
08:12:58,820 --> 08:13:03,940
I'm really confused. Does nobody smell that? Yeah, it's Dungy.

4244
08:13:04,340 --> 08:13:09,300
And this guy doesn't do anything.

4245
08:13:12,180 --> 08:13:16,500
He just follows you around and leans against the thing and gives you a thing.

4246
08:13:18,100 --> 08:13:23,860
Gives you a e-boat. Look at his little hand. His little hands like holding on to him.

4247
08:13:28,740 --> 08:13:30,260
I know Rodericka can sense him.

4248
08:13:34,740 --> 08:13:42,180
Really, only the ones I can't, nobody, do you smell that? Well, you are kind of a skeleton

4249
08:13:42,180 --> 08:13:47,460
yourself, so maybe you don't smell that. Like, how he has that weapon as his weapon is the skeleton.

4250
08:13:51,940 --> 08:13:55,140
Gideon doesn't know where he is. He lives right now. Yeah, I'm like, I don't,

4251
08:13:56,260 --> 08:13:58,900
any, this whole place would smell like absolute shit.

4252
08:13:59,460 --> 08:14:06,660
Like, I don't, it's phantom, does that look like phantom poop to you?

4253
08:14:08,740 --> 08:14:15,700
Because like, he looks like phantom. This looks like real shit that I'm sloshing through

4254
08:14:16,980 --> 08:14:19,460
with real flies.

4255
08:14:19,460 --> 08:14:29,620
It's, yeah, shit and bodies.

4256
08:14:31,860 --> 08:14:35,620
The helmet protects tarnished from smells instead of head injuries, impressive.

4257
08:14:36,260 --> 08:14:40,020
Hiya, Boomi, what's up? Why are you trying to go for my feet?

4258
08:14:40,980 --> 08:14:42,020
That's the chain.

4259
08:14:47,460 --> 08:14:49,620
What? What do you want, Mr?

4260
08:14:52,260 --> 08:14:54,100
I think my headache medications make me sick.

4261
08:14:55,860 --> 08:14:58,020
Watch me, I've accidentally taken a Tylenol PM

4262
08:14:59,300 --> 08:15:01,940
so that was a horrible Tylenol, because I've done that before.

4263
08:15:06,180 --> 08:15:07,540
At least my head doesn't turn anymore.

4264
08:15:10,580 --> 08:15:11,780
So we're going to go...

4265
08:15:17,700 --> 08:15:19,540
Wait, where do I get quick step from?

4266
08:15:22,260 --> 08:15:23,220
Did you take earlier?

4267
08:15:26,500 --> 08:15:32,580
I'm 99% sure it's just normal ibuprofen. I'm just tired because I've been streaming since 130.

4268
08:15:35,380 --> 08:15:36,900
Have you seen a single toilet this whole game?

4269
08:15:36,900 --> 08:15:41,060
I'm pretty sure there is like an outhouse sort of thing.

4270
08:15:42,660 --> 08:15:45,700
Boomi, what are you up to? Is there something under my computer that you want?

4271
08:15:47,140 --> 08:15:51,620
You have a toy right there. He's just acting up.

4272
08:15:57,300 --> 08:15:58,660
The war master shack, yeah.

4273
08:16:00,340 --> 08:16:02,500
The dagger I just bought has quick step automatically.

4274
08:16:05,780 --> 08:16:06,500
Am I stupid?

4275
08:16:06,900 --> 08:16:11,380
I think I am. Anyways,

4276
08:16:15,460 --> 08:16:22,820
back to the cave. I feel like I'm very tired and I just want to remember you also.

4277
08:16:30,020 --> 08:16:32,820
I thought I had to get quick step.

4278
08:16:36,900 --> 08:16:39,220
Oh, it doesn't exactly have it.

4279
08:17:07,460 --> 08:17:16,180
That's not where I wanted to go.

4280
08:17:19,060 --> 08:17:23,700
I forgot you should probably like dodge the shit. Oh, like so.

4281
08:17:27,460 --> 08:17:30,740
I'm just like going through stuff. I'm not waiting for stuff to stop.

4282
08:17:31,540 --> 08:17:39,220
The head pat emo. I know I should get a head pat emo.

4283
08:17:46,980 --> 08:17:48,180
Oh, I keep going the wrong way.

4284
08:17:48,180 --> 08:18:00,660
That's the area of fucking Scarlet Rock.

4285
08:18:18,980 --> 08:18:30,660
Oh, I forgot the serpent bow is in here.

4286
08:18:30,660 --> 08:18:43,140
Oh, sorry.

4287
08:18:43,140 --> 08:19:00,820
I'm getting fucking terrified every time I see a

4288
08:19:05,620 --> 08:19:08,580
maiden. It's going to go this way really quick.

4289
08:19:08,580 --> 08:19:14,500
I don't think I went the right way. Oh, fun.

4290
08:19:17,460 --> 08:19:19,060
Ever get? Is there a grace?

4291
08:19:19,060 --> 08:19:32,740
No.

4292
08:19:34,660 --> 08:19:41,140
Raina, let's not hop up on my desk right now. Okay. You don't have to chirp at me.

4293
08:19:41,140 --> 08:19:47,140
Hi, Raina.

4294
08:19:49,940 --> 08:19:51,140
You have eye crusties.

4295
08:19:59,780 --> 08:20:02,580
There's a statue of America? I don't know. Is there?

4296
08:20:02,580 --> 08:20:10,580
Oh, Raina, you are hurting me with her. No, you can't.

4297
08:20:12,580 --> 08:20:15,460
She's like gripping my shoulders. I can't take her.

4298
08:20:18,980 --> 08:20:23,780
You're purring so hard. Raina, I need to put you on the ground.

4299
08:20:23,780 --> 08:20:35,380
Oh, all right. Well, I have a cat on me now. She is a cleaning baby, but I love her for that.

4300
08:20:48,900 --> 08:20:50,340
Oh, why did I go this way?

4301
08:20:54,740 --> 08:20:58,100
All right, tell me something. Just tell me that Boomi's going crazy right now.

4302
08:21:04,740 --> 08:21:13,540
Time to complete it in one go? Um, sure. I didn't. It's fine. Well, I shouldn't have done that.

4303
08:21:15,780 --> 08:21:17,940
Can you go after my other thing first?

4304
08:21:17,940 --> 08:21:24,020
Because I did shit wrong.

4305
08:21:28,180 --> 08:21:30,340
I accidentally gave him to the tagger.

4306
08:21:34,500 --> 08:21:36,020
Oh, no.

4307
08:21:36,020 --> 08:21:46,100
No. It's fine. It's fine.

4308
08:22:06,980 --> 08:22:21,620
Damn it. I feel like I could have gone that in one go.

4309
08:22:24,740 --> 08:22:30,100
I know I forgot to. I like walked in and I saw the dagger in my hand. I'm like, no.

4310
08:22:30,260 --> 08:22:34,900
I'm tired. That's my excuse. I'm tired.

4311
08:22:38,260 --> 08:22:42,740
Then I gotta do this shit. This will probably take me like one more.

4312
08:22:45,860 --> 08:22:47,860
I kind of sworn there was like a thing down here.

4313
08:22:50,420 --> 08:22:57,860
Come on. Come on. Come. No. Don't die. Don't die. No, don't.

4314
08:23:00,900 --> 08:23:11,860
Oh my god.

4315
08:23:16,660 --> 08:23:19,460
I think I need to go to bed after this.

4316
08:23:24,180 --> 08:23:27,380
That's the wrong way. Anyways, what am I doing? What am I stuck on?

4317
08:23:31,060 --> 08:23:35,860
Yeah.

4318
08:23:46,740 --> 08:23:50,580
Oh, wrong way. Oh, no.

4319
08:23:53,780 --> 08:23:56,340
Why don't you just go down? I'm gonna get poisoned.

4320
08:23:57,300 --> 08:24:04,500
Get out of the fucking way, bro. I have cat hair in my eye and Rena on my lap.

4321
08:24:10,660 --> 08:24:11,300
There's a rat.

4322
08:24:18,260 --> 08:24:24,100
I don't always got bit by a rat.

4323
08:24:27,220 --> 08:24:31,460
I don't know. I'm not just jumping over things.

4324
08:24:33,700 --> 08:24:50,100
No. Stop. No. Stop. Can you stop, please? I don't have any boluses for that. I'm just gonna die slowly.

4325
08:24:50,100 --> 08:24:53,860
Oh, this is great.

4326
08:25:10,660 --> 08:25:12,340
I just think I'd win if I walked in there.

4327
08:25:15,620 --> 08:25:17,860
I got poisoned grease.

4328
08:25:20,100 --> 08:25:37,860
I can wait.

4329
08:25:43,860 --> 08:25:45,860
Try to two hand the moon veil.

4330
08:25:50,820 --> 08:25:58,020
I'm literally gonna wait until this is done. Why is poison lasting forever?

4331
08:26:01,220 --> 08:26:11,860
I'm wondering if I should heal. Okay, then I might just heal and just go in and kill them.

4332
08:26:12,820 --> 08:26:21,620
Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna...

4333
08:26:21,620 --> 08:26:41,380
I call this one just like rises out of fucking nothing. You guys come over here.

4334
08:26:51,940 --> 08:26:54,020
Yeah, this is the same damage I'm doing.

4335
08:26:57,140 --> 08:26:59,220
Oh, I don't even think I needed him.

4336
08:27:02,260 --> 08:27:03,700
Use your fucking sword, bro.

4337
08:27:07,620 --> 08:27:09,140
I don't have any more. It's fine.

4338
08:27:13,860 --> 08:27:17,380
Yeah, I didn't even need the fucking mimic. I just grabbed the mimic just in case.

4339
08:27:22,020 --> 08:27:23,380
Oh my god, my eye hurts now.

4340
08:27:34,500 --> 08:27:37,460
I did not need the fucking mimic to heal for that.

4341
08:27:40,180 --> 08:27:45,140
Okay, I think it's time I go to bed. I'm still fucking poisoned.

4342
08:27:45,300 --> 08:27:53,460
Let me... So I got the golden scarab. I'm just gonna sit myself here.

4343
08:27:55,460 --> 08:27:57,380
I don't know why I need to get by fucking arrows.

4344
08:28:01,060 --> 08:28:06,180
I just want to set myself up for success. I think there was arrows. He had arrows.

4345
08:28:07,060 --> 08:28:15,620
I know it's almost over. No, it's not gonna be the perfect time. I'm not gonna be able to do this

4346
08:28:15,620 --> 08:28:17,940
fast enough. I'm already like freaking out.

4347
08:28:20,580 --> 08:28:25,220
Where's the dude? Oh no, where's the dude? He's over there.

4348
08:28:27,460 --> 08:28:30,020
No, I'm so tired. I also didn't sleep last night.

4349
08:28:36,820 --> 08:28:40,660
Hello. Hello.

4350
08:28:45,940 --> 08:28:49,380
Yeah, I didn't fall. Well, it's not like I don't stay up. I just don't fall asleep.

4351
08:28:52,900 --> 08:28:56,500
Those are bolts. I need arrows. It's like they know.

4352
08:28:56,740 --> 08:29:09,540
Well, I will take all of these. Thank you kindly. I think they know that we're gonna go see Moglin.

4353
08:29:12,740 --> 08:29:16,260
Moglin, Moglin. I don't need arrows for leveling.

4354
08:29:21,540 --> 08:29:23,060
Do I literally have just enough?

4355
08:29:26,980 --> 08:29:27,380
I do.

4356
08:29:33,860 --> 08:29:34,500
That's funny.

4357
08:29:40,740 --> 08:29:42,100
I need arrows for farming.

4358
08:29:42,820 --> 08:29:50,820
For a hug.

4359
08:29:57,460 --> 08:29:59,780
What? I'm so tired.

4360
08:30:06,420 --> 08:30:07,940
Yeah, I have a serpent bow.

4361
08:30:13,060 --> 08:30:24,180
Yeah, that's a great bow. This is normal bow. I know that the seeds are cane, but we really

4362
08:30:24,180 --> 08:30:30,340
don't need that for that. Is that anything on? Oh my god.

4363
08:30:36,820 --> 08:30:38,980
Fuck. I didn't equip arrows.

4364
08:30:39,940 --> 08:30:41,220
There. Whoopsies.

4365
08:30:44,180 --> 08:30:45,220
Nope. That's not what I want.

4366
08:30:48,020 --> 08:30:50,180
Is it? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Hold on.

4367
08:30:52,100 --> 08:30:52,580
Nope.

4368
08:30:58,820 --> 08:31:04,900
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I bought normal arrows. What are you talking about?

4369
08:31:09,460 --> 08:31:10,020
Why is it?

4370
08:31:21,060 --> 08:31:21,780
Why wasn't it?

4371
08:31:25,940 --> 08:31:26,580
That was weird.

4372
08:31:31,780 --> 08:31:33,220
I forgot how to use a bow for a second.

4373
08:31:39,140 --> 08:31:41,060
Hey, come on. Yeet.

4374
08:31:45,140 --> 08:31:45,860
Yes, it's me.

4375
08:31:56,580 --> 08:31:57,940
This is going to take a while.

4376
08:32:00,420 --> 08:32:04,980
This is going to take a while. Farming for levels.

4377
08:32:08,980 --> 08:32:18,980
I might do this actually before I go to bed.

4378
08:32:32,180 --> 08:32:34,180
I haven't caught an icy stream yet.

4379
08:32:35,140 --> 08:32:39,060
Is it really that down bad? I don't. What?

4380
08:32:40,740 --> 08:32:44,820
What is the context of that question? Back to you being past the practice of the end.

4381
08:32:44,820 --> 08:32:46,980
Thank you. Oh, good. I'm so proud.

4382
08:32:48,980 --> 08:33:00,180
You did great, which was a mob that I don't know. I'm scream. That would be funny.

4383
08:33:04,900 --> 08:33:10,740
No. Oh, my guts are a little bit longer.

4384
08:33:15,460 --> 08:33:20,740
Mow dies tomorrow. The tree has a weird hitbox. I usually just, I do it when they're in between

4385
08:33:20,740 --> 08:33:22,180
the tree. Oh.

4386
08:33:28,420 --> 08:33:31,380
That's, this is how you know how fucking tired I am, bro.

4387
08:33:35,140 --> 08:33:44,420
Okay, let me grab my runes. And let's look at my cute little, my cute little outfit, my cute little bow.

4388
08:33:57,060 --> 08:34:01,700
Greenies in my arms and my eyes are itchy because I think I got like a piece of cat hair

4389
08:34:01,700 --> 08:34:05,780
and I blame Reina. I'm going to go knock out.

4390
08:34:08,660 --> 08:34:09,380
Hawaii.

4391
08:34:12,500 --> 08:34:18,500
I'm asleep. I know my sleep schedule has been so bad lately, guys. I don't even mean it to be,

4392
08:34:19,380 --> 08:34:23,860
even Boomi's coming over right now. He's like, come on. And then Reina just huffed at him.

4393
08:34:24,980 --> 08:34:28,180
She goes, and that's this morning.

4394
08:34:28,900 --> 08:34:44,420
We'll be right at the cause. Oh, perhaps, maybe just a little bit because I need to, I just

4395
08:34:44,420 --> 08:34:48,820
like staying up and spending time with you. Oh, me. Save.

4396
08:34:58,580 --> 08:35:14,340
I don't know why you don't want you to meet me. Oh, I'm like off to the side. Do I have any orders

4397
08:35:14,340 --> 08:35:21,860
for you tonight? Sleep well. I want you to, why are you asking me to tell you to do stuff when I'm

4398
08:35:22,180 --> 08:35:30,100
half asleep right now? I'm like, I'm falling asleep in my chair. Reina, I'm not open.

4399
08:35:41,940 --> 08:35:46,900
I want you to get yourself a cat boy outfit and dress up as a little cat. No, I'm kidding. Please

4400
08:35:46,900 --> 08:36:09,940
don't do that. Remember when I'm sleepy and my voice gets high?

4401
08:36:16,900 --> 08:36:22,180
Boomi,

4402
08:36:26,980 --> 08:36:30,340
you're planning a buying cat boy outfit. Anyway, it is for one reason.

4403
08:36:31,220 --> 08:36:33,140
Um, I don't know. I just hope you guys sleep well.

4404
08:36:38,740 --> 08:36:45,140
Over six hours. That's, I'm impressed with your attention span because I wouldn't be able to

4405
08:36:45,140 --> 08:36:50,980
watch myself for six hours. Jesus Christ. Oh, but thank you guys for hanging out with me all day.

4406
08:36:50,980 --> 08:36:56,740
Like, oh my gosh, or stopping by if you could. Um,

4407
08:36:59,780 --> 08:37:02,340
Reina, stop being so cute with your big eyes.

4408
08:37:02,340 --> 08:37:10,100
I wish I didn't have to work. Oh,

4409
08:37:12,500 --> 08:37:14,740
get some rest. I will.

4410
08:37:19,380 --> 08:37:22,820
Boomi, do you just kick glitter onto my computer?

4411
08:37:25,700 --> 08:37:28,260
Boomi, you're gonna mess up. I'm trying to time this properly.

4412
08:37:29,220 --> 08:37:34,980
It would be at 10, 10. She'd be marathon streamer. I don't mean to. I just like it.

4413
08:37:38,820 --> 08:37:44,100
Errah. What's fun popping in for a bit of beginning in meow. Yeah, thank you guys for stopping by,

4414
08:37:44,100 --> 08:37:50,740
stopping in, saying hi. And then we're stopping in, stopping by, saying hi.

4415
08:37:50,980 --> 08:37:58,420
Oh, maybe I'll, that'll be my outro for streams. Um, can we get, can we get a pet the madam emote?

4416
08:38:00,980 --> 08:38:06,420
No, you don't get to make demands of me. Excuse you. More Elden Ring tomorrow. Yes,

4417
08:38:06,420 --> 08:38:12,980
I'll probably stream early again. Actually, I do have to record a special ASMR.

4418
08:38:15,540 --> 08:38:20,180
And Boomi never, although he's finally actually laid in the bed. Like as I'm getting off,

4419
08:38:20,180 --> 08:38:24,900
now he wants to be comfy and cute in the bed. If he did it sooner, I would have put the cat cam on.

4420
08:38:25,620 --> 08:38:27,460
Because I like cat cam for long streams.

4421
08:38:35,700 --> 08:38:37,860
Um, but,

4422
08:38:44,100 --> 08:38:48,660
because I already ordered emotes, so I can't like just add another emote to it.

4423
08:38:48,660 --> 08:38:54,020
So that'll take a while if I do that. Um, because I didn't, did I add a pat emote?

4424
08:38:55,300 --> 08:39:02,260
I can't remember, because I had 10 emotes that I got that I could order. Um, Strani was telling me, so.

4425
08:39:06,420 --> 08:39:09,940
I missed, I see barrier stream didn't work, so it was good to still like, yeah, yeah.

4426
08:39:10,980 --> 08:39:13,060
Um, I'm sorry you missed your stream.

4427
08:39:13,220 --> 08:39:21,140
Of the recording, did you forget if I have to make a cover? Yeah, covers are hard to make. I'm happy that

4428
08:39:21,860 --> 08:39:26,500
like, Strani was pretty concise in what she wanted from us and being like, okay, do it like this.

4429
08:39:26,500 --> 08:39:31,620
I'm like, okay. And it worked out and it sounded at least a little bit of okay.

4430
08:39:36,340 --> 08:39:40,180
I think my bathroom fan is broken because it sounds like it's rattling.

4431
08:39:40,180 --> 08:39:45,780
Okay. I was getting distracted by things when I'm like falling asleep in my chair.

4432
08:39:46,420 --> 08:39:52,740
What do you have to pay to do covers? Um, like, well, we don't get like any copyright because

4433
08:39:52,740 --> 08:40:00,740
we didn't claim copyright or like, you just, if you're okay with not getting the money, then you

4434
08:40:00,740 --> 08:40:09,220
just like, you can go through the artist and ask for permission only if you want to monetize it.

4435
08:40:09,220 --> 08:40:12,100
We didn't monetize any of our music videos so they can't get claimed.

4436
08:40:15,620 --> 08:40:19,540
Yeah, no, I did not pay Ray William Johnson to sing his song.

4437
08:40:21,540 --> 08:40:27,060
That would be very cool though, but I'm not making any money off of singing his song. So

4438
08:40:28,020 --> 08:40:29,620
favorite line from your cover.

4439
08:40:29,620 --> 08:40:36,100
Butter ass was looking good up in the mom jeans.

4440
08:40:38,020 --> 08:40:42,900
Or the, or the, I approached her in the checkout line and said, oh, yeah. Oh, baby, what's up?

4441
08:40:43,460 --> 08:40:45,300
Yo, baby, what's up? That was pretty good.

4442
08:40:48,180 --> 08:40:53,620
Maybe the girls out. Stop. Don't look at them. Stop. Stop staring. Why are you pointing it out?

4443
08:40:55,140 --> 08:40:57,300
Why are you pointing it out, bro? You're making it weird.

4444
08:41:00,020 --> 08:41:02,660
Frick, it's 1012. Oh, you guys tricked me.

4445
08:41:07,620 --> 08:41:09,780
I'm easily distracted when I'm tired.

4446
08:41:14,260 --> 08:41:15,540
I love how my eyes glow.

4447
08:41:22,820 --> 08:41:26,020
Don't you have to go through the music labels to get permission to monetize the music?

4448
08:41:26,500 --> 08:41:31,700
I just said that. You have to go through the artists. If you want to monetize it,

4449
08:41:31,700 --> 08:41:33,300
none of our stuff is monetized.

4450
08:41:35,540 --> 08:41:38,420
Man, I will stay longer the more we talk. Shut up.

4451
08:41:41,300 --> 08:41:43,220
Yep. 1015.

4452
08:41:46,580 --> 08:41:50,340
Even. What's everyone doing?

4453
08:41:50,740 --> 08:41:56,820
No, you don't have to. No, I did not. No, not like that.

4454
08:42:00,580 --> 08:42:05,460
Tell us about the boy. No, I still have to watch the episode after this and I'm not going to make

4455
08:42:05,460 --> 08:42:12,100
it. So I'll probably watch it tomorrow morning. I have to go grocery shopping. Maybe I will go

4456
08:42:12,100 --> 08:42:16,340
grocery shopping just for a couple of days so I can have a couple of days worth of food instead

4457
08:42:16,340 --> 08:42:24,900
of ordering DoorDash. I'll get some uncrossibles. Is my favorite person in the boys? None of them.

4458
08:42:26,900 --> 08:42:30,900
I think every character has a hateable trait. Besides Kimiko.

4459
08:42:32,180 --> 08:42:38,340
So I guess Kimiko is my least hated character. I literally just looked at the talk of the time

4460
08:42:38,420 --> 08:42:41,940
because I'm like, it's a 17. Okay.

4461
08:42:44,900 --> 08:42:54,100
Girl, please stop. I hate everyone except you, I guess. Yeah, friend Jesus is annoying sometimes.

4462
08:42:55,540 --> 08:43:01,460
He just was like, I'm like, why do you, why do you do this? Why do you do stupid stuff? Even MMM?

4463
08:43:01,460 --> 08:43:07,060
Uh, MMM, everybody makes stupid decisions because I hate all of them because they're very human.

4464
08:43:08,740 --> 08:43:17,140
Excuse me. Oh no, I didn't mute. I'm being taken advantage of on my eepiness.

4465
08:43:20,580 --> 08:43:23,220
I'm leaving. Goodnight.

4466
08:43:28,660 --> 08:43:36,660
Why are you lying about my burp? Wait, where's my BGM? Where's my BGM? My BGM? I'm getting bigger.

4467
08:43:36,660 --> 08:43:38,740
No, I don't mean to be changing my model.

4468
08:43:41,860 --> 08:43:47,860
Okay, there's my BGM. BGM good. BGM's good. I'm over tired.

4469
08:43:48,660 --> 08:43:53,060
I'm gonna mute the desktop audio and close up other things. And then...

4470
08:43:55,060 --> 08:44:02,900
Hi. Bye. Oh, it's 10.15. Bye. Bye. I gotta go. I gotta end it. I gotta stop streaming.
