05:42.560 --> 05:48.480
Didn't sleep last night, I guess well, it feels like I like closed my eyes and I blinked and I was awake and

06:12.600 --> 06:20.040
It's that it's the same brand as my pots and pans that I use and the same color so it matches

06:21.800 --> 06:28.960
Well, I didn't black out. No, it was not that bad not at all. It's more so like I got distracted. I

06:29.840 --> 06:35.720

It's almost 2 a.m. Silly me. I should probably sleep

06:50.040 --> 06:57.800
You didn't say you were like oh, I'm not that light and one and a half drinks does not put me black out

06:58.320 --> 07:00.800
I'm not that that bad

07:01.400 --> 07:07.120
It's good to see my neck is in one piece. It is indeed attached to my body

07:09.160 --> 07:11.160
Oh, no, I'm fine. Yeah, I uh

07:12.200 --> 07:14.040

07:17.960 --> 07:19.720
Lied to you

07:19.720 --> 07:25.300
It actually did I didn't notice until this morning, but it did cut my finger. I just never noticed I can

07:26.600 --> 07:28.600
But it's fine

07:28.720 --> 07:31.440
Just it's like it was a little little skin

07:32.920 --> 07:36.720
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. I think I'm getting sick though. I

07:37.720 --> 07:42.600
Think when I went grocery shopping yesterday morning at the store, there was like a bunch of sick people because now

07:43.200 --> 07:45.200
I'm feeling a bit ill

07:45.640 --> 07:48.200
I'm feeling a wee bit ill. I got some tea

07:50.080 --> 07:52.080
Made it in my new teapot

07:52.120 --> 07:55.040
Thank God because I was tired of microwaving my tea

07:56.040 --> 08:01.440
And I know my British fans out there would be horrified to hear that I microwaved my tea

08:01.440 --> 08:04.840
It's just easy to just throw it in there for like a minute 30 and I'm good

08:05.040 --> 08:07.040
But now I have a nice tea kettle

08:07.880 --> 08:11.260
So I've made myself some nice chamomile tea

08:14.880 --> 08:16.880
I didn't hear you just say that

08:17.840 --> 08:19.600

What uh, you don't you don't like microwave water microwave water is delicious

08:26.000 --> 08:29.480
It's chamomile tea. I like I don't know why I'm drinking it

08:29.480 --> 08:31.400
But it's like my favorite tea because it might make me sleepy

08:31.520 --> 08:37.440
It's like a lavender chamomile like it's called sleepy time tea has a little cozy bear and he's you know

08:38.120 --> 08:41.160
He's hanging out you buy the fire getting all epee

08:41.640 --> 08:45.200

Just how you can manipulate like an online talent as her like manager

11:46.920 --> 11:48.920
Very very interesting

11:49.360 --> 11:54.000
And it's like just brings a whole new perspective to like how men head up

11:55.160 --> 11:57.160

Um overdosing did oh doki-doki literature club is literally one of my favorite games of all time

12:05.720 --> 12:09.040

13:48.640 --> 13:54.520
although an AI an AI whore, I mean woman of the night

It's just because

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
Oh

14:38.680 --> 14:46.120
But just it's so fun having like gen mates that like have the same taste as you and even if they don't have the same taste

14:46.120 --> 14:53.320
You're just like oh, okay. I see where you're coming from. That's that's a pretty good idea. Okay, very cultured

14:53.320 --> 14:58.680

15:24.360 --> 15:26.360
Did you know that like

15:27.360 --> 15:29.360
I'm like that

15:30.880 --> 15:35.440
Should I be saying this that breast milk tastes very sweet

15:42.440 --> 15:44.440
One of my

15:44.440 --> 15:46.440
friends had a baby

15:46.880 --> 15:51.200
Recently and she's like she be and I'm like, yeah, she's like

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
You keep looking at the baby's bottle

15:56.360 --> 16:01.840
Do you want a taste and I'm like straight from the source and she's like we were just we were joking

16:01.840 --> 16:06.580
We were joking. She's like here and she's just like put some out like in a little like shot glass for me

16:06.920 --> 16:08.920
so I did

16:09.560 --> 16:11.860
My friends breast milk and I'm just like

16:16.480 --> 16:18.480
Wow that is surprisingly good

16:21.040 --> 16:25.880
Well then like it makes sense because it has all this like nourishment and all this like whatever stuff

16:26.400 --> 16:33.160
And I'm like that's some that's some good stuff right there. So if Azura ever made like a

Like a milk based

16:37.160 --> 16:42.160
Like merch item like she starts selling her own like blue milk like and it's

Azura do lay

16:44.760 --> 16:46.760
This is like I

16:48.200 --> 16:50.700
Wouldn't be a verse to try again 100%

16:51.540 --> 16:53.540
Um

16:53.900 --> 16:58.900
She be you've been streaming for five days and you've tased chat

16:59.260 --> 17:06.700
You've talked about drinking breast milk. You don't many suspicious things on stream if anyone's getting like

17:08.300 --> 17:12.100
Demonetized or their channel terminated first. It's probably gonna be me

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
I

17:14.980 --> 17:19.820
Sir impression is so good. Yeah, she has like a really

17:21.380 --> 17:23.820
Sing song II dragged out

17:24.900 --> 17:26.900
like voice

17:26.940 --> 17:33.860
It's like she's thinking but then she also kind of has like a valet girl accent at the same

17:33.860 --> 17:38.060
It's really like she'll be like, oh my no, she doesn't say oh my gosh at all. I don't know

17:38.060 --> 17:40.060
I

17:40.340 --> 17:43.980

17:48.980 --> 17:53.700
Oh, I can one up that I can one up in all of that. Should I be wanting up in me?

17:56.060 --> 17:58.060

18:18.100 --> 18:19.860
And um

18:19.860 --> 18:26.260
So I I had eaten something. I think like I got like food poisoning. So I'm sitting there

18:26.260 --> 18:32.460
I'm like, oh my god, like I really have to use the bathroom like if I fart like it's not gonna be good

18:32.820 --> 18:33.980

So I'm sitting and we're laughing and I'm about to be like, oh, let me I'm just gonna be or be real quick to run to

18:40.340 --> 18:44.580
The bathroom and then we get a raid of like four hundred people

18:48.100 --> 18:50.100
And I'm like, oh

18:50.140 --> 18:53.300
Hi everyone, welcome to the stream

19:06.140 --> 19:08.140

19:08.180 --> 19:12.420
Waiting for like I just wanted people to leave at that point like though

19:15.020 --> 19:19.140

19:19.140 --> 19:23.420
I need to I can't just like leave when they rate some is like, oh, you know what I

19:24.340 --> 19:26.340

19:27.340 --> 19:29.340
Maintain the numbers

19:31.260 --> 19:39.420
Like oh, yes, let me continue to talk about how I would smash how I wouldn't smash any bird Pokemon because it's a fucking

19:42.180 --> 19:48.820
But no, it was fine, I didn't you know, I can't one up in me because I didn't actually shit myself but afterwards I

19:50.340 --> 19:52.340
Did like

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
Low-pony can get it. Um, I

19:55.340 --> 19:57.340

20:28.380 --> 20:30.780
It's moving too quickly. No, it's not moving fast enough

20:31.620 --> 20:33.180
and

20:33.180 --> 20:37.980
She's like, oh my gosh, I'm so proud of you because she knows I've been working towards being like a full-time streamer

20:39.660 --> 20:46.060
No, you're not the abuse abuse of boyfriend. You're the sweetest you the sweetest little subby boyfriend a girl could ask for

20:46.820 --> 20:48.020
Um

20:48.020 --> 20:54.220
But so I told her so she she doesn't know like the full extent of like the content I make

20:55.260 --> 20:57.260
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she was watching me right now

20:58.140 --> 21:00.140
Hi, Cheryl

21:00.780 --> 21:02.500
But

21:02.500 --> 21:04.940
She uh, I told her like

21:05.980 --> 21:12.700
So I told her that my outfit is risque cuz she's like, oh, I told her that I got merch merch plug. Ooh market

21:13.500 --> 21:19.860
And she's like, oh, I want to buy your merch and I'm like, I I don't think you should

21:20.500 --> 21:25.260
Because I don't think I want and she's like this really sweet older woman. She's like

21:26.260 --> 21:29.420
Middle-aged and she's she's like, let me support you

21:29.420 --> 21:33.780
I don't like I feel like that's a breach of stuff, but I don't like she's been with me for years

21:33.980 --> 21:35.860
so but I'm like

21:35.860 --> 21:37.860
You should probably get a key chain

21:38.300 --> 21:43.540
It not the shirt cuz she's like, I want a shirt. I'm like, I don't think you want a bondage bunny on a shirt

21:47.260 --> 21:52.820
Yeah, I don't want some rude ain't wearing outside, you know what I don't even your support is all them like that's just

21:53.660 --> 21:56.380
You don't have to wear it out. That's okay. If you rep me

21:57.300 --> 21:58.820
honestly

21:58.820 --> 22:04.260
Hell to the yeah, I don't even think I can wear my own merch outside because I just

22:05.020 --> 22:11.020
Something deep down just tells me I'd be identified if I'm wearing my merch and then I like go to like

22:11.940 --> 22:15.780
CVS or something and then I'm like, hey, I'd like to get like

22:16.500 --> 22:18.500
Some a pack of gum and they're just like

22:18.940 --> 22:21.660
She be caught in by like I just feel like I would be

22:22.660 --> 22:25.700
Noticed it's happened before I've had

22:27.540 --> 22:33.300
When I was a flesh tuber someone I was working at my normal day job and someone's just like are you?

22:33.940 --> 22:35.540
redacted and I'm like

22:35.540 --> 22:37.380
No

22:37.380 --> 22:41.180
They're just like wow you look exactly like her and I'm like wow, that's crazy

22:42.220 --> 22:44.380
Anyways, did you want to buy anything else?

22:47.220 --> 22:49.220
That's something that happened at the target

22:50.100 --> 22:51.700
Yeah

22:51.700 --> 22:59.140
And like even like I'm nervous to like say like oh I went to this place today because I'm like there is somebody out

22:59.140 --> 23:04.060
There that will figure out exactly what store I'm at and be like triangulate my location

23:06.060 --> 23:08.860
And then they'll see me be like oh my god, she's a rat and I'll be like

23:10.340 --> 23:12.340
Yeah, I'm you I'm you oh she right

23:14.860 --> 23:20.620
Redacted as my favorite streamer. Oh, yeah, I was a lot more based back then and politically incorrect

23:20.620 --> 23:24.060
That's for sure being a former commentary youtuber

23:24.940 --> 23:32.940
Immersion broken redacted is that honestly that would be a cool name for a streamer. Hey, what's up? I'm redacted. He just called her Daki. Oh

23:36.060 --> 23:43.460
I got gen 2 a vtuber that's just covered in sensor bars and her name is redacted

23:45.340 --> 23:47.660
Her outfit is made out of sensor bars

23:49.020 --> 23:51.660
You had flesh. No never flesh

23:52.660 --> 23:54.660
You know Daki Daki

23:55.700 --> 24:00.220
Right, that's not a bad idea. She's like she's like a what's it called?

24:00.900 --> 24:02.900
one of those exhibitionists

24:04.020 --> 24:10.420
Yo, I'm cooking I'm cooking feeler gen 2 redacted although we were making jokes that

24:11.100 --> 24:17.260
V2 could be feeler gen 2 could be like V sucky. No, that'd be so are like suck you

24:18.340 --> 24:20.340

26:17.220 --> 26:20.620
Why do they burp in your streams? It's so un-lady like I'm not a lady

26:21.740 --> 26:24.540

27:20.940 --> 27:22.940
Oh, it's so confusing

27:24.060 --> 27:26.060

27:45.460 --> 27:53.420
420 like $4.26 like the things that are on my machine elements. So and then there's also a secret one

27:54.420 --> 27:56.420
I

27:57.460 --> 27:59.780
Do do do let me turn these all up though

28:00.820 --> 28:04.540
My poor babies can't hear my beautiful mommy voice

28:08.260 --> 28:13.340
But yeah, cuz my manager was explained like in straw knee we're like cuz I was like straw knee

28:13.340 --> 28:16.780
How did you do all your alerts so my manager was helping me yesterday set up

28:17.780 --> 28:23.980
The alerts and then I was recording stuff this morning because I thought it would just be funny cuz straw knee was like

28:23.980 --> 28:26.580
Oh, yeah, you can do like variations and I was like, what?

28:27.460 --> 28:32.580
Okay, you couldn't do that on stream labs. So I'm like word. Let's do it. Okay. Oh

28:34.300 --> 28:36.300
I wonder if you guys can hear me AC

28:40.420 --> 28:42.420

28:43.140 --> 28:47.820
A giant ass be just flew into the window that just scared me

28:50.340 --> 28:54.620

Be for gen 2. I think I don't Yen's getting a bee. I'm excited for their next gen

29:11.300 --> 29:17.620
Um, I am someone who I just love I love watching debuts. I love watching debuts

29:18.420 --> 29:19.700
um

29:19.700 --> 29:22.620
I watched all the pixel ink girls. They were really sweet

29:23.540 --> 29:27.860
You may plus girls. Oh, well, yeah, like anybody that's like debuted recently

29:28.020 --> 29:31.900
That's in an agency. I've watched and even some indies. It's just fun

29:31.900 --> 29:37.780
Like I like getting to know people. I just I just sit quietly in the chat though. I don't say anything cuz I'm too shy

29:38.740 --> 29:40.740
Yeah, I watched like um

29:40.900 --> 29:48.020
Like before Mariah's debuts. Oh, those were so good. Like there's so many talented people in the community

29:49.860 --> 29:51.860
So

29:51.860 --> 29:53.860
Sorry

29:57.060 --> 30:02.340
Mmm, yeah, like there's just like a lot of cool. Like I watched like mono and um

30:03.220 --> 30:05.220
and alias and

30:05.540 --> 30:10.740
Nova and stuff they're like the v4 mariah girls so creative and so where the in the pixel like girls

30:10.740 --> 30:14.980
I always go for like comfy. Like I'm like, okay. Let me watch like, um

30:16.260 --> 30:19.060
Like uh, chio or I'll watch, um

30:20.260 --> 30:22.660
Me and uh, I can never pronounce anybody's names though. Um

30:24.420 --> 30:26.420
Erlotte

30:26.500 --> 30:29.060
But yeah talented talented yappers. Yes

30:29.700 --> 30:32.900
Did you watch for the debuts for this new company called velar? Nah

30:33.620 --> 30:35.620
Mean valier. Nah

30:37.620 --> 30:40.660
No, yeah, I technically I watched our debuts like three times

30:41.300 --> 30:43.940
Because we had to do we did some um test runs

30:45.540 --> 30:47.540
Japanese

30:47.780 --> 30:53.380
You're doing a summer art mind. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Thank you. I mean visaki. Yeah, then, you know, you mean visaki

30:54.100 --> 30:56.100
You mean visaki

30:58.740 --> 31:00.740
Okay, let's see

31:00.980 --> 31:02.980
I think that's good

31:03.940 --> 31:09.460
All the debuts stuff went so smoothly a test run. Oh, yeah. No, I really did it really did we prepared really hard

31:10.100 --> 31:14.020
Um, it was really fun though. Just like the first time we did a test run

31:14.420 --> 31:19.380
So we were like, okay, we'll meet for like three hours to be like to you know, the normal length of our debuts

31:20.500 --> 31:23.380
We were probably together the entire day

31:23.460 --> 31:24.980
I don't know if it was like

31:24.980 --> 31:31.620
Five or six or seven hours because we were hysterically laughing at each other because we were just having so much fun

31:32.100 --> 31:33.860
And then there'll be like technical issues

31:33.940 --> 31:40.100
And so like we would all be in a discord call while we watch one of the girls like stream on a like a unlisted thing

31:40.980 --> 31:42.980
And we just be like I remember

31:43.700 --> 31:48.900
Like so azura's model has like really good eye tracking for some reason and so you can really see when she goes like

31:50.740 --> 31:52.260
When she like shifts her eyes

31:52.260 --> 31:56.340
So when she was looking at like um, like her talking points, she would just let be like

31:57.940 --> 32:03.060
Anyways, and then like you thought so we were just die laughing every time she looked at her talking points

32:03.460 --> 32:10.180
And like you could see it like um in our uh, our two point our no our debut collab where she's like kind of like shifty

32:10.180 --> 32:12.180
Eye looking at at icy

32:14.020 --> 32:15.380
It was so funny

32:15.380 --> 32:18.420
If you sucky debuts are okay except this weird bunny girl, I know right

32:19.380 --> 32:23.140
You like the cotton mog girl. Nah, she was my least favorite. She's my least favorite

32:23.700 --> 32:26.900
You know the eye tracking is good. We all have iPhones for eye tracking

32:28.100 --> 32:32.020
Uh eye tracking with oh my god, there's kids running down the hallway behind me and that just scared me because they're like

32:35.140 --> 32:39.060
iPhones are very good for their facial tracking. Um, I would

32:39.940 --> 32:43.140
Like and also it's uh, it's also dependent on the rigor like a really good rigor

32:44.340 --> 32:46.340
um can

32:46.580 --> 32:48.580
Even if you like have a webcam

32:48.660 --> 32:52.100
And it could almost make it seem like you're using vbridger because the tracking is just so good

32:52.500 --> 32:54.500
So although I I don't have my

32:55.300 --> 33:00.420
My model my phone plugged into my computer right now. So I'm going off at wi-fi. So I know my mouth tracking is like

33:02.740 --> 33:04.740
You have samsung phone

33:05.460 --> 33:07.700
How's how is it when you ruin group chats?

33:09.140 --> 33:13.620
You love my hair drills. Yeah, I love my hair drills too because my hair is curly

33:13.860 --> 33:15.860
I love curly hair

33:16.660 --> 33:18.580
um, but

33:18.580 --> 33:20.580
I can't draw my own hair though

33:21.300 --> 33:25.220
It's hard to draw my own ringlets. It just looks like weird spaghetti

33:28.420 --> 33:32.020
Hair arms for your next outfit. Yeah, I'll just be like one of the the arms characters

33:33.380 --> 33:35.780
You love her side. I know is there a side eye is the best

33:37.140 --> 33:41.940
As much as I just like apple their cameras are tracking are goaded, you know, it's not even like apples

33:42.580 --> 33:46.660
cameras because samsung's cameras have a way higher

33:48.420 --> 33:52.260
Like mega pixel amount. It's just like apple has this really good

33:53.460 --> 33:58.500
Software for their cameras and I'm like if you married the two of like a samsung camera camera

33:58.900 --> 34:04.260
And apple software or like android camera and apple software, then yeah, I am I am an apple fan

34:05.540 --> 34:10.180
Um, just because just ease of their ecosystem, but like I do still like android

34:10.820 --> 34:12.020
I just

34:12.020 --> 34:15.220
For like modding everything, but they just have a terrible user interface

34:16.180 --> 34:20.420
One of my friends is an android and I'll be on her phone and I'll be like she'll be like, oh, can you like

34:20.580 --> 34:23.140
respond to this text for me? And I'm like, yeah, and I'm like

34:24.100 --> 34:26.100
Okay, so how do I go to the homepage?

34:28.340 --> 34:34.020
How do I do this to broke for apple stuff on apple stuff is so freaking expensive. It's

34:35.140 --> 34:37.140
ridiculous

34:37.140 --> 34:41.940
I save I save a save like I because I didn't like they didn't I think they bought phones for the other girls

34:42.020 --> 34:44.660
But I already had a phone. I saved for a very long time

34:45.780 --> 34:47.300
to and I got

34:47.300 --> 34:49.300
I got a 15 coming from a

34:50.100 --> 34:51.540
11

34:51.540 --> 34:53.540
something or other

34:53.540 --> 34:55.540
xr

34:56.100 --> 34:58.100
Whatever

34:58.820 --> 35:00.820
Although they also like

35:01.620 --> 35:03.620
they just

35:03.620 --> 35:08.020
I'm not I'm not gonna go rant about apple right now. I'm just like let's just talk about tech and glomerates

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
Incorporations and greed

35:13.380 --> 35:18.020
You mean how do I go that I know everything it's when you're used to something like maneuvering around

35:18.660 --> 35:22.260
I'm just it's it's hard to like switch and go to the next one because like

35:22.580 --> 35:26.420
I have a mac that I used for school and stuff and I do my my assignments on

35:27.460 --> 35:30.660
And then but then I stream on a pc and like do everything games on a pc

35:31.220 --> 35:32.580
so it's like

35:33.140 --> 35:34.260
And so

35:34.260 --> 35:38.100
It's annoying on a mac because it like everything scrolls in the opposite direction

35:38.180 --> 35:44.500
So like I'll be on my pc and I would like have to like hop on my my mac book and then I'd be like, oh frick

35:44.660 --> 35:46.660
How do I work this thing again?

35:48.100 --> 35:54.340
Cancel the game we need to deconstruct capitalism. Well, you guys know the vibes I talk for like a yap for a bit

35:54.580 --> 35:56.580
And then we get into the game

35:57.460 --> 36:00.740
Apart from adding another camera every year we haven't I know

36:01.380 --> 36:03.060
Yes, that's so true

36:03.060 --> 36:08.340
Like it is it's frustrating for me because I was just like do I even I'm wondering what the 16 will look like like

36:08.340 --> 36:14.500
I'm a huge tech head. I'm not gonna lie. Like I like to watch like the keynotes and wwdc and all that stuff

36:15.140 --> 36:19.860
Um, just to see what's up and like how things are progressing like I like to see how um

36:20.820 --> 36:24.180
Watch I'm gonna call it just like how apple will tackle

36:24.820 --> 36:29.780
You know machine learning and AI and all that jazz just because like other like google's already on top of that

36:30.980 --> 36:34.580
So it's just really fun. Like I like watching marcus brownlee and just his uh,

36:35.540 --> 36:39.860
um breakdowns of stuff and also like other uh youtubers, uh

36:41.780 --> 36:46.980
Tear downs I was like care downs. That's not it. They're not caring for the device that they're destroying

36:47.700 --> 36:53.700
We yapp we game and yapp and the game and yapp the circle of yapp the circle

36:58.500 --> 37:04.020
I know he I just like watching to um marcus brownlee. Why are you so cool? I'm not

37:05.620 --> 37:07.620
I'm not cool

37:07.860 --> 37:11.060
You just think I'm cool because we have similar interests stop it

37:11.060 --> 37:13.060
Yeah

37:14.580 --> 37:16.740
I'm a yabbit

37:16.740 --> 37:18.580
Yes, I'm very much a yabbit

37:18.580 --> 37:22.980
I worked for apple once they actually treated every employee very good in the work life balance pretty great as well

37:22.980 --> 37:28.180
But overpriced his understanding. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, I had a friend who worked for apple as well

37:28.340 --> 37:34.180
They said that it was good. Um, because they like what the heck they got like good benefits and stuff

37:34.660 --> 37:40.180
And they like they paid well. So of course like and like retail is um, because they're like or whatever

37:40.180 --> 37:42.900
The retail stores or whatever or their customer service calls

37:43.540 --> 37:47.860
Like um could be pretty tough, but if like that if you have that and that's that's pretty good like

37:48.900 --> 37:52.420
It's good that they treat their employees. Well, although I know like a lot of

37:53.300 --> 37:54.420
um

37:54.420 --> 37:59.780
tech companies right now are like laying off a lot of people because of everything during coveted

37:59.780 --> 38:04.020
So I hope it doesn't seem like apple has been hit with that because I know google's had a lot of layoffs

38:04.500 --> 38:09.780
Layoffs and it's because of like I for my what I went to school for although I I'll be honest with you

38:09.780 --> 38:11.700
I didn't finish school

38:11.700 --> 38:14.580
Because one I am a very indecisive person for my major

38:15.300 --> 38:17.140
um, but I

38:17.140 --> 38:21.940
So I was going to major in creative writing and then I changed it and then I was going to major in veterinary science

38:22.020 --> 38:25.460
And then I changed it and then I was going to major in english because then I changed it

38:25.860 --> 38:28.500
And then I was going to major in biology and then I changed it

38:29.940 --> 38:32.260
And then I was going to major in um

38:33.220 --> 38:38.260
Uh cyber security and then I changed it and then I was going to do it and then I changed it

38:38.660 --> 38:40.660
And then I finally settled on

38:41.300 --> 38:43.940
Software engineering and then I never finished

38:52.020 --> 38:54.020
My parents are not happy with me

38:56.580 --> 38:58.580
Oh, yeah, and I almost went to art school

38:58.740 --> 39:04.900
How many years oh no, it was only like it was over the course of like three years no biggie

39:05.700 --> 39:06.980
it's like

39:06.980 --> 39:11.060
like I could go back and finish my software engineering degree, but

39:12.260 --> 39:14.260
like I'm like

39:14.660 --> 39:18.580
Like I was still in school when I start like a like a couple months ago, but

39:19.140 --> 39:21.380
I'll be honest. I wanted to focus on streaming

39:21.860 --> 39:25.940
And I know that's probably not the best thing to do, but I was

39:26.740 --> 39:33.940
I was just super passionate about fulfilling because I've had dreams of being a content creator. Um since I was a

39:36.660 --> 39:38.660
Since when I was

39:39.140 --> 39:41.140
I don't know how old was I a wee child

39:42.180 --> 39:44.020
In my parents like laughed at me and stuff

39:45.380 --> 39:49.700
I remember when I was I used to uh, I was a nice flush tube and uh twitch

39:50.500 --> 39:52.500
My mom's like you're gonna get abducted

39:52.820 --> 40:00.420
I saw someone say before it was it was yeeted by a mod you failed art school. No, I didn't fail art school

40:00.580 --> 40:04.660
I never went to art school. I though I did want to major in illustration

40:05.060 --> 40:07.140
Um, but I didn't end up going to art school

40:07.220 --> 40:10.580
I want to be with my friends when I should have gone to like a vocational school

40:11.460 --> 40:17.860
For because I almost went for like a vocational school for um veterinary medicine, but yeah, my mom was is very uh

40:20.420 --> 40:22.420
Not happy with me

40:23.140 --> 40:27.060
But when I'm like mom look, I'm streaming. She's but like, you know, my parents

40:27.060 --> 40:31.460
They're very supportive of me now because um, I they saw my determination

40:32.900 --> 40:33.780
um

40:33.780 --> 40:37.380
And my motivation and like, you know, like I still have a day job

40:38.020 --> 40:41.380
Um, and I was still going to school while I was streaming but now

40:41.940 --> 40:44.660
Since I have VLR. I was like, you know what? Let me put a pause on that

40:44.900 --> 40:48.100
You have like I have so much time in the world to finish school, you know

40:48.980 --> 40:50.660
Yeah, you can't you can always go back to school

40:50.660 --> 40:54.020
You can't join a VTB agency every day a hundred percent. Um

40:55.060 --> 40:56.580
and

40:56.580 --> 41:00.660
Yeah, then I can save and pay off my school debt that I have accumulated

41:03.300 --> 41:07.540
A day job for now. Yeah, like again, I've said it multiple times if I can stream full time that'd be cool

41:08.100 --> 41:09.940
like uh, so

41:09.940 --> 41:13.940
I do want to yeah, I've already said this before as well. Um the first two weeks

41:15.220 --> 41:16.740
of

41:16.740 --> 41:24.100
After debut, I am pretty much streaming every day, but it's going to change because I have to go back to my day job

41:24.740 --> 41:31.300
Um, so it'll be I'll be honest with you. My stream times may change and be inconsistent. I'll still stream like

41:32.100 --> 41:33.620
maybe

41:33.620 --> 41:38.260
Like five. Yeah, at least five times a week in like two days off. Um

41:39.780 --> 41:41.620
It do me

41:41.620 --> 41:44.260
But uh, please don't mind me if school debt it hurts

41:45.060 --> 41:47.700
Yeah, do it makes you happy. This brings me joy. This brings me happiness

41:48.420 --> 41:49.380
Um

41:49.380 --> 41:54.580
And obviously like you need to be realistic and stuff when it like comes to money and like getting a degree and everything

41:54.580 --> 41:59.060
But honestly, it feels like a degree meant something 10 years ago. And now it doesn't anymore

42:00.580 --> 42:06.020
See like I'm trying to like minimize my burps if you guys are gonna rate me so low. I'm going to go harder with my burps

42:07.940 --> 42:09.940
Ever try to cover your burp with a fart

42:10.820 --> 42:12.820
And I've tried to cover my fart with a burp

42:15.060 --> 42:16.260
Yeah

42:16.260 --> 42:18.740
Done in time and so I choose to draw my own type nice nice

42:19.300 --> 42:24.420
Sometimes I felt like I feel like it never meant anything. Well, like school. Yeah to the degree

42:24.900 --> 42:26.260
That's what I hear

42:26.260 --> 42:33.060
Like my parents didn't go to school like my dad never finished college and neither did my mom and then they're but they're very

42:33.300 --> 42:35.300
Like my mom if she did go to school

42:35.300 --> 42:42.020
She would be running like a fortune 500 company right now like 100. She's such a smart ambitious woman if you want like, you know like like

42:42.980 --> 42:46.660
Uh minus like the dying of some unknown disease

42:46.820 --> 42:50.580
My mom really reminds me of queen just like and not she didn't

42:51.060 --> 42:52.980
Teach me to be a woman of the night

42:52.980 --> 42:58.020
But like she's just like this entrepreneurial like really smart like

42:58.580 --> 43:01.140
Bad-ass woman and she always wears

43:01.620 --> 43:06.820
Work outfits just more appropriately appropriately clothed instead of myself

43:07.540 --> 43:09.700
So because like I remember I showed her my model

43:10.660 --> 43:16.020
And she's in the lore and everything and she's like, oh my gosh, this reminds me of me. I'm like mom

43:22.660 --> 43:28.340
And I didn't show it to my dad. I just I just showed the neck up to my dad because my dad would be like you harlot

43:31.860 --> 43:37.300
But mommy, sorry mom, uh woman of the night sounds like a Batman rip off

43:37.700 --> 43:39.700
But um

43:40.660 --> 43:44.740
No, yeah, like I just I just wanted to do stuff that makes me happy and yapping makes me happy

43:45.460 --> 43:48.340
Um, yeah, I can always go back to school. Um

43:49.460 --> 43:53.540
I could finish I probably have like two more years left of of school

43:54.980 --> 43:56.260
but

43:56.260 --> 44:02.740
Excuse your lateness. No terrible somebody flog him mods flog him. I have to fart now though

44:02.980 --> 44:08.580
She's just like me for real for real. She'd be small. Yeah, just like it's more so like oh office woman

44:08.660 --> 44:10.660
That kind of gets like gypped for a lot of things

44:15.860 --> 44:20.740
Um, I didn't know I could have that sort of power thank god that's this that's too that's too funny actually

44:21.300 --> 44:23.300
Oh, that's

44:27.060 --> 44:29.060
You don't know what you've created

44:29.060 --> 44:31.060
She

44:38.500 --> 44:44.100
Maybe she had a chapter in her life, you don't know about I highly doubt that my mom is not like that at all

44:46.260 --> 44:48.260
I'm in danger

44:50.100 --> 44:52.100
Mother merciless

44:52.820 --> 44:54.820
Tactical

44:56.260 --> 44:57.460
Um

44:57.460 --> 45:03.620
But yeah, I just can't wait to see where we'll go in the next like year or so year two or three or four or five or six

45:03.620 --> 45:05.620
You're never getting rid of me

45:06.500 --> 45:09.780
I'm never leaving you're stuck with me now. I hope you know that

45:12.420 --> 45:19.060
Um, sorry that was a yondery moment. It was so weird sometimes it just happens

45:19.460 --> 45:21.460
Okay

45:25.540 --> 45:27.540
Good mercy impression

45:29.620 --> 45:32.180
Shall we play a game?

45:36.580 --> 45:38.580
Oh don't look at my desktop though

45:38.580 --> 45:40.580
I

45:48.020 --> 45:49.860
It's just my tits

45:49.860 --> 45:52.900
So yeah, you see like you know how that was just right now

45:53.860 --> 45:55.860
um, so when

45:56.420 --> 46:02.420
Some of you guys know the story the other day. In fact, I'm gonna stick myself down here. Um, just so my boobies aren't

46:03.700 --> 46:05.700
You're gonna get big headed

46:06.660 --> 46:08.660
She be so

46:10.500 --> 46:16.100
You know how I mentioned like those maintenance guys came in I had my headphones on they knocked on the door

46:17.060 --> 46:18.340
Um, I didn't hear them

46:18.340 --> 46:23.380
So they just let themselves in thinking I wasn't home to do some like just change my filters and check my water and stuff

46:23.940 --> 46:25.940
so I just have

46:26.980 --> 46:28.980
That

46:29.380 --> 46:34.420
In the background just like I have me just around and then I have like that

46:35.700 --> 46:37.700
I

46:39.220 --> 46:41.220
Don't miss like oh, yeah

46:41.540 --> 46:43.540
And then just like toys everywhere

46:44.580 --> 46:49.060
My crop is on my desk. It was great. It was really you know, we bonded that day

46:50.420 --> 46:54.260
I have uh display capture on um, oops

46:55.460 --> 46:59.140
I have display capture on because um, what's it called?

47:00.180 --> 47:02.180

Hops mr. House hops play house my uncle's house. Um, doesn't my creepy a strange uncle's house doesn't

47:09.060 --> 47:12.340
Won't work with the game capture for some reason or window capture

So let me set that up

47:19.860 --> 47:22.420
Do we do we do I like how there's just two of me

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:08.180
Hey, I want to make a movie

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.420

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:15.620
Someone open the blinds like go open the curtains

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.460
You know what that sound is not as footsteps this is ass clapping

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.340
Uh, it's I'm going

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.980

Have his has his eyes gotten creepier

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.820
Mr. Hopps kind of thick damn

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:04.500
My ass cheeks are clapping so loud it's alerting the guards

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.620
Oh, well shit, let me just eat

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.580
I'm waiting for him to just like walk forward

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:24.900
Can I like go in these rooms? No, okay, anything in here? No

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:33.620
It's coming closer. It's RT to run it. It's not working. Oh

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.340
Oh

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:40.100
Our art right trigger is to quit

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.420
This doesn't work

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:50.740
I'm like holding that I'm doing I'm pressing every button trying to run on controller

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.340
Yeah

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.340
Yeah

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.700
Yeah

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:07.220
I just don't know why it doesn't want to work in controller

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.820
He's coming back

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:25.940
Press the quit button to run all time for my work. You're right. Let me try that. Give me a second after this though

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.700
Anything over here? No

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.740
Yep

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:49.380
Jenna and I stopped to see Esther again today. The place was so filthy. Wait, is this David? Is this the husband?

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.100
I'm not sure how it would have

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:58.100
Got her so bad so quickly Esther doesn't seem to be keeping herself clean either and it's almost like she didn't recognize us

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:03.940
Her appointment is tomorrow. Jenna is worried that she might have to go into care. I'll keep this documented

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.180
I hope ruby doesn't have to see her like this

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.700
Please

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.500
I'm stuck in this

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.140
Ah, yes

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.180
Ah, we love to see it

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.780
For the love of christ, please let me out of this

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.100
Ah

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:36.180
Guys i'm not having a good time

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.140
Oh my god

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.860
It's free on steam

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.740
I

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:01.620
Got please I want to play the game. I want to know what happens

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:08.580
But I also don't want to have to go through stuff again. Oh my god

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.460
I'm like, is it me? Am I just stupid like

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.100
Maybe I am holding the button. I've held it. I've held it

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.260
I'm holding it

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.380
What is happening

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.900
Okay, I game whatever

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:53.780
Let's go for the second tape

01:21:54.820 --> 01:22:00.260
Why is this game being so mean to you? I don't know it's already I don't know

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.060
Is he gone

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:13.300
No, that's because I tabbed out like a bitch this game hates bunnies this game is

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.700
You know, it's very discriminatory

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:23.060
Just because my estranged uncle just looks a little different doesn't mean

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.420
Oh

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:31.700
He isn't deserving of love and affection

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:41.700
Yep, oh fuck it

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:49.140
Ha ha bitch a two bitch

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.620
I

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.300
If I do this

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:00.100
I don't know. Well, it doesn't matter anymore. I was gonna like trigger the toy

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:12.180
Okay, there's nothing upstairs it doesn't really matter if I do that

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:17.860
It's laying on everything

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:22.260
Oh see now it's working now it's working

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.140
Why is he quiet

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.500
Is he in my room

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.140
What

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:54.260
Why does he sound like he's over here? Why is there no tape in my room?

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:58.820
I bet if I set the the bear off he would like come running in my room

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:04.900
Okay, let me just yep running start

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.340
I don't hear him on this floor

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.580
Yeah

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:21.140
Oh

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500
If I stand from the hole will he get me

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.620
All right, I need to go

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.300
For all the tapes

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:59.940
There wasn't any over here, but again my game bugged out so who knows

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.180
I need a Christmas tree

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.260
Then a Honda lightning Mcsheebie

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:22.100
That's fine

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:31.380
I offer you an accord I offer you an accord I usually can do um her voice

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:39.700
Wait, you know what this calls for actually no I can't

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:44.980
Because

01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:52.580
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.900
Where the fuck are these tapes

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:03.060
I feel like they're just randomly around the house from places I've already been

01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:14.580
I did not expect if he's supposed to change like that that was good. Thank you

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:20.820
Yeah, I offer you an accord it's just a Honda accord she be type R

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.460
I did it nothing happened now what?

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.420
I have to restart the game

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.820
I'm plug-and-replug. Oh honda type R. Oh

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:02.660
No, no cars, okay

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.940
Leave me alone

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.380
I

01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:22.340
Sir one in here

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:32.120
Guys, I think the game's bugged

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.540
Oh

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.700
I set up for a split second

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:58.580
Caught me again

01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:17.460
Oh, I almost landed in the car

01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.420
Wondering how set three AM's simulator literally

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:42.180
Please

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.900
I

01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:58.420
Why is it back here

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:08.100
As I'm recording this ashes in the hospital her neighbors called the police in the early hours of the morning because I'm stretching

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.420
Oh

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:15.460
Stretching her mother out because they could hear his screaming. She'll be there for a few days

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:20.500
We told ruby that she had a fall and she's okay. We're basing on diagnosis. She's crazy

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:26.740
Yeah, I'm trying to find the damn tapes

01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.340
Walking back and forth around this house like a motherfucker

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.820
You

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.140
Touching what what?

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.220
Is there any tapes in here?

01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:48.500
We took ruby to the hospital to see her nana her banana

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:57.940
It's not stupid ester made a soft toy for her could mr. Hope a small rabbit ester always knitted her clothes and toys

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:03.060
Ruby was thankful, but I must admit this toy does have a look to it

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.740
Something quite unsettling

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.500
That's why we really yeah, my uncle he's coming to you know

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:15.780
Take care of the house

01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:18.340
Take care of everything

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:23.460
Banana oh

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.460
Yeah, see that's what I totally meant to say

01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:32.900
I hate when my dead grandma haunts my toys you're wrong. No

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.180
I have to toot

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.460
Toot accomplished, you know what this calls for

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.020
An uncrossable

01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:01.540
Like the ASMR you guys didn't even hear it. How can you?

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.620
Peanut butter and strawberry jam

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.060
No, I didn't pull an emmy

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.500
Um

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.700
If you don't know what uncrossable is it's essentially

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.540
Two slices of white bread. It's a PB and J

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:47.620
Just cut off the corners and seal them and it's a circle

01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.260
Booby is eyeing my uncrossable

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.260
You can't have any

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.620
Just a wee snack

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:22.580
I

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:29.620
I've only had to waffle and uncrossable today. I should probably have something protein or veggie based

01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:37.060
Are they better than just making one? Yes, the bread is so soft and

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.700
Definitely unhealthy for you

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:42.900
strawberry toaster's drool. I haven't had toaster's drool since I was

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.020
Unnugget

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.900
We already said this

01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:57.700
Since I was a wee nugget stop it stop it

01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:03.380
Bust it down Tatiana bust it down bust it down thought the other buses that

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:06.660
Looks like I like spilled milk everywhere

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.500
Looks like I superhero landed

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.500
Yeah

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:21.700
No, no, it's not that

01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:27.140
That's fucked up. This is literally a fucking kid

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.540
Oh my god, his face is getting more fucked up

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:37.780
Can I leave now

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.740
Okay

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:46.020
His mouth is just open

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.020
Now he's coming closer I must ran for it

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.580
How does he teleport up the stairs so fast?

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.580
Oh

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:14.580
Booby I'm so sorry. I just scared you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh big man. I'm so sorry. I scared you

01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:23.220
Give a timer before you die like Sonic

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:26.980
That got me again

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:35.700
Oh, I can go in through that way. Oh, that's so much easier

01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:44.580
She would talk to us like that

01:34:54.180 --> 01:35:01.140
Hey, uh, welcome to your first day on the job. Uh, thanks for taking it, you know

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.860
There was a lot of people that didn't want to take this job

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.300
Hello

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.380
The fuck

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:24.180
How do you know it was me that picked up

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.300
All right for the 50th time, let's try my parents bedroom

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.020
All right

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:47.460
Sorry, uh-huh mark. Hello

Hello

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.060
Hello

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.500
All right, this is

01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:01.860
I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Fuck. Fuck him. Fuck him. Fuck him. Fuck him

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:12.980
Okay, there must be one up here now

01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:19.940
Yes, the little girl is Ruby

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.620
Don't look in the drawers. Oh, I almost went for it

01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.460
This is literally walking simulator

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:37.220
Back from the bar fitting named purgatory. That's funny bar called purgatory. Oh, thank god

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:41.780
We just had a call as they're passed away in her sleep

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.220
The doctors couldn't give us diagnosis and even said the sudden passing is bizarre

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:53.300
You'll have to tell Ruby when she oh a demon did it a demon did it. Oh a demon did it

01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.580
Oh, sorry boomie

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.700
I realized I didn't put my

01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:07.860
wrist rest back and I'm like, why is my wrist hurt because my on the edge of my

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.860
Bad desk

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.060
It was mr. Hopps

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:17.220
He was hopping

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.620
I don't like that noise that doll made

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:32.020
Okay, is there one over here

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.900
There has to be one in my room. Okay, it must be in my parents room then

01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:48.180
Yeah

01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.860
Yeah

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:57.300
All right, don't forget I have no sense of direction

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:05.940
What up she be how is everyone um poorly navigating a game

01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:09.780
And I have to sneeze again

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.060
Boom boom

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:18.340
The sound of my ass cheeks is alerting the guards so I can't do a snake voice though

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:23.780
Oh, you see that oh fuck

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:49.140

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:04.980
Fainted oh jump scare. Oh, whatever

01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:10.660
Hmm, let me check this one more time. Okay

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.300
I

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:23.620
September 22nd Ruby hasn't been on her best behavior since the news

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.740
We got to take her slingshot away because she won't stop firing pellets at the toy rabbit

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:31.460
She said it protects her from it. It's just a toy

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:37.380
We've had to lock the slingshot away since ruby kept finding it jenna keeps the key under a houseplant in the hallway. I think

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:44.900
Why is her father just record tapes?

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:51.860
Like who does that in this day and age? Is that a house plate in the hallway?

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:56.580
Is this a house plate in the hallway? There's a lot of houseplants in the hallway

01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.300
Hmm

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:03.860
Yo, oh, I'm not gonna make it. I made it

01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:06.420
Wait

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.460
Check

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.220
Which hallway?

01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.740
Which houseplant be more specific? How are you ever gonna remember?

01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.180
Right in funny noises me

01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:23.460
Hello

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:32.420
I'm literally pressing everything. Oh my god. I got it

01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:36.260
Okay, but then now where

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.300
is

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.820
Like where is it stored? He didn't say where it was stored. Yeah journal pages would make more sense

01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.900
Fuck fuck

01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:03.300
I'm assuming it's back in their bedroom

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:11.620
Go go. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I ran out of shit

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:22.660
Okay, but there's a fucking safe in here

01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.380
Huh

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.900
Oh, April 18th

01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:48.180
Big brain what? Hello

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:51.940
I press the wrong button

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:58.740
Please oh wait, they're British. Maybe it might go in the opposite direction

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:10.180
Okay, well

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:12.580
Ah

01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:22.820
British time British is not the proper way

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.900
That's dumb. Oh, can I shoot him?

01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:32.980
Wait, how do I shoot?

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:36.740
I fucked up the controls. I had to use the other thing I had to use

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.740
Oh

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:42.900
Oh

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.940
Okay, let's go

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:50.260
Fuck you

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.620
I got this this is where the game begins

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:01.700
In the early version of the game it was a gun

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:09.940
She just gets a fucking gun

01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:20.660
Oh, where is he where is he come here, bitch

01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:26.020
I'm ready for you. It's hard to these controls

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.300
Oh

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.100
This is very tense

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:55.620
What I don't understand about this game is that

01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:59.220
I don't know how the how the

01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:02.740
Game mechanic works because you know like a 3d game like you know

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:06.580
There can be rooms like stacked on each other that you go through and that's how you progress like um

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:11.300
But like I'm wondering why can I hear the monster right here?

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.460
Is there like technically another part of this?

01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:16.340
Where he's on the other side

01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:18.340
like I don't

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:22.360
Is another room that just does it oh

01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:31.220
It's so fucking tense

01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.740
You

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:50.500
Objective kill mr. Hopps she got the Glock. Yeah, I mean it's probably the basement

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.540
I have a sneeze again

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:07.780
Well now I know he does not gonna come so I don't really care

01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:21.460
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Oh, what I couldn't leave

01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:31.060
All right

01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.100
I

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:41.060
Need a jump shot. Oh, maybe maybe I do need a jump shot. Yeah

01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:45.140
Yeah

01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.500
Go for his ankles

01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.340
I don't know I think I'm too short

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.260
I think I'm too short

01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:10.740
Because I can't go back up

01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:18.180
Is my game bugging again

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:21.140
Oh

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:29.300
Am I hmm, maybe

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.820
Okay, I'll I'll I'll test y'all's theory

01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:38.260
So you see the little red because there's a cool you can't see it past me because my head is fucking huge

01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:40.260
But there's a cool down

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:42.740
Um meter

01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:50.180
I

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:52.740
Can't

01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.340
I didn't do anything different that time

01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:04.340
I didn't do anything different

01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.180
All I did was

01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.300
Do I have to like start up here and then I don't

01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:15.940
Might get make sense

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:23.220
Can I call for help? Nope. Oh, what the fuck are the controls again?

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:32.740
Oh

01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.860
Why is it saying that

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:43.220
Weird I don't know why it's acting like I can do something. Can I leave now?

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:47.940
No, I don't want to give my nana a big kiss

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.780
It's time to kill nana

01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:56.740
Fuck you nana. Oh

01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:57.940
Fuck you

01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.940
Fuck you fuck

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.300
Nope, I'm good

01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.260
Oh god

01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.260
Oh

01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:17.460
Okay

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.520
What police stay where you are

01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.220
What the fuck

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:35.220
I

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.220
I

01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:58.980
It seems like you guys are just as confused as me how I escaped when they grabbed me

01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:07.140
That doesn't make any sense. Can I replay that?

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:11.620
I'm replaying that

01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:28.180
I can't go any faster

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.460
I

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:33.860
Can't even like get out of this

01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:40.980
They don't even explain

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:48.900
Why the police were there shoot the hand what if you fought instead of escaping okay, let's try it

01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:56.580
But it says to run though

01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:00.980
I

01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:06.980
Yeah, I don't I don't think that works

01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:10.740
Maybe your neighbor called them. Oh, that makes sense

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.100
You shift to that's what I've been using shift to spread

01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:20.100
I read yours like chef that's right

01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:22.740
I

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:32.340
Didn't notice that three times that I did that. Okay, let's try to outrun the thingy my barber

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.740
I

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:01.620
It's weird the first time

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:05.860
That I got put in the situation the hand didn't spawn for a really long time

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:09.140
And that was the only reason I was caught because I thought I could turn around and shoot at it

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:11.140
And that's why I paused for a bit the first time

01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:13.860
So I don't know

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.620
The game obviously is bucky, but it's like a you know, it's like just an indie game

01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:20.740
I'll try one more time. I'm gonna make it

01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:44.100
It's the same ending

01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:51.220
Was it my grandma? Was she possessed? I don't

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.980
Okay

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:06.340
All right

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:10.020
Nice

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:24.020
Anything past the door, I don't think so. Well, this game is what hold on. Let me see how old it is

01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:29.060
It came out in 2019

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:34.900
This thing is very positive

01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:47.780
Achievements are broken somebody said oh someone else said you get capped like it is the same ending

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.380
And then it makes zero sense

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.780
Yes

01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:59.460
Thumbs up haha British funny. Okay, so it seems like it's supposed to be like that

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:03.060
Thought there was an ending where you burned down the house

01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:06.420
What

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:18.100
The other ending is a secret ending they made a prequel. Yeah, I know there's a second one

01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:22.900
I'm like I'm playing the free one though

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:31.620
What's this there's an ending where I burned down the house, what do you well now I'm looking up a walk through

01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:35.540
Don't mind if I do

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:42.740
I

01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:03.780
Plus collect the first tape then you go back to the kitchen and you get lighter fluid

01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:14.100
After you collected all the tapes find the slingshot then shoot

01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:19.380
Mr. Hop six times go left shoot a pot on the side table that is near you and you get a box of matches

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:24.260
You see some pieces of paper once you're staying on the piece of paper press e or z to set them on fire

01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:34.820
That is so elaborate for no reason and I like spammed everything in the kitchen after I got the first tape

01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:38.500
I didn't see any of the lighter fluid

01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.980
I

01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:50.500
Yeah, people said that it also wouldn't let them light the paper. Okay. Well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna bother playing through all that

01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:58.660
Got the arson, but yeah ending those already. Yeah, it seems like you have to I'd have to like start

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:01.620
I'm like, I don't feel like doing all that. I don't feel like doing all that

01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.100
Oh

01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:16.340
Hold on let me move over a bit and we can chat a bit

01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.060
That's a little wee cheeky chat in it

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:24.180
It's juice. Oh, no, it's not Tuesday. Tuesday's yesterday and I didn't even say it's juicy in it

01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.860
dumb

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:27.860
Let me close the game out

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.580
Oh white woman jump scare I've been flashbaked

01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:42.980
My eyes

01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:49.060
There we go

01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:53.140
Oh man

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:56.740
So

01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:04.340
What do you think of my game skills? Okay, so I've been really uh validated the past few days playing uh

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:09.460
Playing these games that have bugs in them because then I'm like, oh, is it me? Is it me?

01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:13.380
It's not me. Sometimes the game is bugged and that makes me feel a lot better

01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:17.060
I was positively glowing. She'd be flash bomb

01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:20.260
Oh god white woman flashbang again

01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:23.300
Oh

01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.460
It's not the flashbang I wanted

01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:33.700
Oh

01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:36.100

Uh

01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.300

Oh my god, you're on top of me. How did this happen? Oh, okay

01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:26.660
I feel like she is a character from class of oh nine

01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:31.220
Uh, we have one of my friends played it on stream. Um

01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:34.020

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.500
Get conked

The mods are slow in the draw

01:57:57.620 --> 01:57:59.620
My mods are failing me

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:04.260
All right

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:17.620
I feel like I feel like mod was just like this is like sipping a drink. It was like, oh, oh mistress. I'm so sorry

01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.580
I'm the alpha dome

01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:24.740
So

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:31.060
There can only be one um this this chat isn't big enough for two

01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:36.020
I've gone drunk with power

01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:42.100
That's my new laugh you guys like it even working on it

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.820
Yes
