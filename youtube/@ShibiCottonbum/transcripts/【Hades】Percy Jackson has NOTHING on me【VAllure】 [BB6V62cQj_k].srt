1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

8
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

9
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

10
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Let's see how this works. I don't know where the game went. Hey gone. Oh, there it is

11
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:33,800
They and Samara was good. How do I sound? I don't know. Does this $400 thing make a difference. I

12
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Bet I sound the same

13
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I

14
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,640
Was asleep watching strong even she rated it from here would have been perfect but an animal give all

15
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Tyler one Mike sounding great. You think it does make a difference. Does it sound worse?

16
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,300
It was a comfy, okay, I'm glad you guys like the ASMR

17
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,560
I sound clear, but I'm peeking. I I had a feeling that would happen

18
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Let's see if I can fix that

19
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,880
You look broken I can fix that sorry I

20
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,080
Guess I can I have a playback in my headphones and I do sound I just a bit

21
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Just a wee bit peeky

22
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Just a wee bit

23
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,360
And I don't know if that would be the gain perhaps I

24
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,080
Turn that down just a tad. I don't know. I don't know if that helped

25
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:08,800
When is the peaking it sounds really good, okay, I don't know why it like peaks am I like too close?

26
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
I don't even know how I would fix that to be honest with you

27
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
That's better

28
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
A lot better

29
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,520
Yeah, yeah, I'm glad

30
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,160
Wait, did I lock my door my doors unlocked hold on I

31
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Went downstairs

32
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,720
Packages and I forgot to lock the door as per usual nothing new there

33
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,480
What do you mean, what do you mean, please? What do you mean, please? I

34
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,680
Want to see what the delay is on this

35
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,400
It's been weird

36
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,080
I can't tell it's not showing me

37
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Oh

38
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,640
Why does it keep doing that? I'm like, come on come on

39
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,840
Huh, I don't know if it's like something in my settings like either or it will

40
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,520
Be like a little bit behind but it's fine. I'm mostly gonna be

41
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,680
Playing anyway, so we don't have to have like super live interaction. Oh

42
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,800
YouTube you silly silly silly Billy

43
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
All right

44
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
Sorry, I'm happy cuz and that's why my voice is getting higher. I

45
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
Know some people are like, why is she talking in an ooo voice? I'm sorry when I get happy

46
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,840
I talk in my ooo voice. I can't help it. I'm excited to play the game and spend time with you guys

47
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Hello

48
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,920
He is meowing to herself while she's playing with her toy. Okay, so yeah, I've never played this before

49
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,000
I've never watched anything about it. I know nothing about it besides Greek gods and I love Greek gods in Greek mythology

50
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,560
So I'm like so ready to get into this

51
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,960
And you guys know I love called the lamb and you guys said it's a roguelike and

52
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,400
I've seen the art before like I've seen the art of Aphrodite when that was going viral and I was like wow

53
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,840
I love his art style

54
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,240
so

55
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
I'm very happy

56
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,800
Rain is still running around all hyper she's napping right now, but I was so surprised I was like, oh, what the heck?

57
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
What are you doing?

58
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
She was

59
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,520
He's looking at me now actually she just like I think she heard her name

60
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,720
She's watching the other cats play with the toy, but yeah, she was playing with I was like crying

61
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Because I was so happy to see her playing

62
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,520
It's it was really funny. She like

63
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,760
Poop and then had the zoobies. I'm like, are you serious? Did you just really need to take a shit? Oh

64
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,960
Wait, this is look what I can do now. Holy

65
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Oh my god

66
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Oh

67
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,520
Is the game you did. Oh, yes, I think accidentally muted it

68
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,780
There you go, I don't know if you guys can hear it the little beep noises

69
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,640
So anytime I swear I can just be like, oh, I hate the I can't believe this

70
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,440
It's quiet. Okay, hold on. I'm turn that shit up. Oh

71
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,260
My is that

72
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
I

73
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,340
Realize you guys are like in my head like a bit smaller

74
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,180
But I think hold on let's can we just mess could we just hang out and mess around for just a moment

75
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,240
It's just just for a quick momento

76
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,780
What if you beep before you say the word and still say the word what the

77
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,220
Language lady I

78
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,100
Can also mute with this thing wait, hold on. I want to see I don't know if reverb works

79
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,580
I don't know if it works because I can't with the

80
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,340
My mic monitor doesn't tell me if anything's changing. So I don't know if I have reverb

81
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,900
So you guys can tell me my cat is attacking my freaking

82
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
What are they called slippers

83
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,380
Have we not always been the voices in your head all the things you said all the things she said right through my head

84
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
But he asked you guys

85
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,680
I

86
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Don't know if also like this works. I don't know if this works. I'm a is it giving me a robot voice you tell me

87
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Fia, can you please stop chewing on my foot? I beg you please let go of my slipper

88
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,900
Did it work, I don't know again chats delayed so I'm just sitting here like oh

89
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,300
Is it working and I'm just being goofy

90
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,260
I

91
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,580
Don't know why she's attacking my slippers. Boomi was doing it earlier, too. It doesn't work. Okay, that's weird

92
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
I have to figure that out then

93
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
What if

94
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,420
What if I do this no, this is gonna that'll mess everything up, but I have set up

95
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,460
Yeah, I think there's like something I have to do where I can route it through

96
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,140
The thing but it doesn't do that for some reason

97
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,620
Cuz like I'll press stuff and like pressing robot voice, but then I

98
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
Can't hear anything

99
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,500
And then I'm turning up the reverb on my computer instead of on my

100
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,100
XLR and so doesn't do anything. I

101
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:49,420
Don't know why it is what it is. What are your toes? No, I just took a shower. I don't know what you're talking about

102
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,740
I just took a shower. I just took a shower

103
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,740
Wait a second did I figure it out

104
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,980
I don't know if that does anything. Is it working?

105
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Je ne sais pas

106
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:33,980
My feet aren't stinky ever got what she was is this for YouTube because Twitter's ocean marks don't get displayed in the actual video. Oh

107
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,260
Okay, sorry, I just saw that harlot question. Which stream did the heal mark replace rope? Yeah, cuz the rope doesn't come up

108
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,220
It neither does the other bunny emo

109
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,580
So this is what you can use instead if you would like to use my oh she marks, which I appreciate

110
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
I

111
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
So weird

112
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
Oh, I'm gonna Google this

113
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,460
This is our pre chat. This is our pre pre game chat. Okay?

114
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,060
how to make

115
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,660
Go XLR effects work on

116
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
Oh, yes

117
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:57,340
People I can't read forums they just confuse me. I don't know anything about I

118
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,460
Don't know anything about audio. I'm not audio literate at all

119
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,380
40 minutes pre chat of me just messing around with my go XLR

120
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,900
Hey, at least it's not like five hours that it took with me and Azura

121
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,300
She was helping me with all of my audio and

122
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,260
Also my 3d audio and so was mercy at some point she popped in because I was doing an illicit stream to test it and

123
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
The girl said it sounded fine and

124
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,780
And as there is like if anyone complains it's them and I'm like bet

125
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,460
and people complained it's you guys whatever

126
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,180
and

127
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,020
But we still weren't able to figure out how to get the effects to work

128
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:49,300
Um on there, so I think I need to do more research. I asked my manager and my manager is like how the fuck am I

129
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,500
They were just like I don't have one. I'm like, okay. I thought you just knew everything. I'm so sorry

130
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,620
Excuse me

131
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,220
But I buy one off Craigslist and send it to them be like show me how to use this

132
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,780
How to use voice effects

133
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
With go XLR

134
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
Is this person gonna show me how

135
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:39,580
Why is he who makes a video and has themselves so far away from the camera so you can't see what people are doing

136
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,180
I don't understand did anybody comment with some

137
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,780
This is making my brain hurt

138
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,220
I'll do this after I wanted to show you guys but

139
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,980
Percy Jackson mentioned did you watch the live action one? I thought it was pretty good

140
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Let me just click on one of these what is a gender knob am I

141
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,340
Am I gonna turn into a man if I

142
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,020
Why is that an audio thing? I don't know what that means

143
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,500
Echo it's the type of echo that you understand. Oh now that one's a multi-tap and really

144
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,620
Sorry, it was the video I wish I had subtitles so I can read. Oh it does

145
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,540
Cool do I double tap it to make it work?

146
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
No, all right

147
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,780
FX

148
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,020
No, I'm just like putting reverb on my voice. Although it doesn't exist

149
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,620
At least the beep works. That's all I care about. What the f*** if you look at me with your dumb

150
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,900
Face I swear to God I'm going to

151
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Mom

152
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
Your mom

153
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,140
This is every time I'm plugging it plugging it back in I have

154
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,620
my

155
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,820
Insults are invigorating. I'm glad. Let's see if there's a software update devices up to date global settings

156
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,380
What does that say

157
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,660
Oh, I can connect to my stream deck that's cool. I

158
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,140
Don't really need to do that though

159
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,260
So that means I could probably add more effects to my stream deck that's pretty nifty

160
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
Yes, yes indeed

161
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,100
Actually, I am tempted to unplug it and plug it back in

162
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,300
Because it doesn't make sense why the effects wouldn't work at least the microphone part works. I

163
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:46,100
Don't get it presets big echo big verb

164
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
No

165
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
No

166
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,180
Herm interesting. Whoa, that's loud. Holy crap. I just made it louder

167
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,740

Yeah, we're playing already. Well, I just peeked the mic. I'm sorry

Yeah, you're right. Okay

186
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Wait, is that from the day before hold on stream allowance is weird. Sometimes stuff doesn't load properly

187
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,340
Let me just refresh this page. What if I log out along back in?

188
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:16,340
App store plays endless zone zero today. I saw that I might play it. I usually don't I haven't played any hoyo

189
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900

I'm sorry. So there's someone who subscribed to my channel and their name is just oh god

192
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
That's funny

193
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,540
All right, there's two super chats from charlie spur

194
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,260
Both two dollars. Thank you charlie. By the way, can we lay in your lap?

195
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,460
And oh, hey, she's not cursed this time

196
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,980
I wish I knew the river the context for those

197
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,220
But that was it

198
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,100
How much prep time have you given percy jackson access to water?

199
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,100
Can I beep her? Oh, yeah, I definitely could in a fight. That's a whole ass child. I could beat him up

200
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
I just kick him

201
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,100
Punch. I don't need water. I just find him in the desert

202
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:15,380
The eyes pop up beautifully under this black screen wow

203
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,580
Wow, wow

204
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,460
My eye color might change when I get the tan toggle. I'm thinking blue eyes

205
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
white dragon

206
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
But only for the toggle I think

207
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,300
Your muppet is the cursed part. Oh that makes sense

208
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,220
I'll kick him always. What pop what pop?

209
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,580
Okay, I got my controller

210
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,580
I'm so excited to see this. I love how watching different people play this game and someone said there was voice acting

211
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,260
Blue eyes sigmes cat I was thinking um future model

212
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,740
I'll actually be a himalayan rabbit because it's close to a sigmes cat because they have the same gene genetic thing

213
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,500
Where um their extremities are brown because of the change in temperature

214
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,500
Are you familiar with this game not at all?

215
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,620
Hit him with them

216
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
We get it you have blue eyes

217
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
It's fully voiced

218
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,340
ah sweet

219
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340
Okay, then I don't have to do anything

220
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Although I could I bet there's an option to

221
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,820
change that though

222
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
Yeah

223
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,620
I'm wondering if I should voice act. No, I don't have to I'll let the people talk and I'll just enjoy myself

224
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:55,300
Chrissy Jackson ends up in a no no no no no stop. I just accidentally smacked my mic smacked my mic

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
No

228
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
Hell mode

229
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
I have no idea what that means. Okay

230
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,500
Few tales are told of hades. Oh whose very name inspires fear and penitence

231
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,940
I don't know. I kind of like them because of laura limpus. Have you read laura limpus?

232
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,220

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,340

I feel like I walk too fast. Is there is there a walking button? Oh shit. Okay. I can dash

Whoops, um, okay, I don't know. I can't do that whatever that is

244
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Okay, that's just to move

269
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,540

272
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
There she is

273
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,460
Who is this got to be her zagroos? There's nothing

274
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
In the name of Hades

275
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,300
I accept this message

276
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Zagrus, what is he the god of?

277
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,140
He's a demi god. What is he? I really I recognize his name

278
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Uh, he's he is a son of Hades

279
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,580
Don't tell me

280
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
It's not like nightmares

281
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:50,100
He's pretty eyes. He's a one red one green eye. I love the color palette with the random dash of green. It's very interesting

282
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Hmm. All right, you can tell me what is he the god of?

283
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,100
I got a good one for my first son of the big fella. He's the god of talking smack

284
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Yeah

285
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Hades nuts

286
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,540
Hail noble cousin now, let's get you from that miserable place

287
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,540
I'll see that all of us upon Olympus to our part beginning here with me

288
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,860
Okay, she's goddess of wisdom, you know Athena

289
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
It says it there

290
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
He's got a blood

291
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:43,220
He's not Dionysus. Is he a Dionysus counterpart? I'm looking this up because I I like mythology. I'm looking this up

292
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,980
Zagrus is a god associated with rebirth hunting in the underworld

293
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,380
His name translates to great hunter in greek and in the epic Al Simeonus

294
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,580
He is called the highest of all gods Zagrus is also associated with the wine god dying. Oh, okay

295
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Uh, that wine god Dionysus in an orphic tradition. He's considered the first incarnation of Dionysus. Okay. I stand corrected

296
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
A son of Zeus and Persephone

297
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,780
What

298
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Oh well

299
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:34,900
Other stories identify him as a son of Hades or even as Hades himself. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of gods that kind of get like mixed up

300
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
Uh

301
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,940
Interesting because there's different forms of myths and

302
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,780
Because like

303
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,780
I

304
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,340
Little odyssey might depict something just as an example might depict a god as this but another

305
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
Writing depicts them as this

306
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,340
The name

307
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,220
Zagrus derives from Zagrit, which is properly a pit for catching animals

308
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,620
But also one used for depositing animal remains or offerings to a catholic deity

309
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,620
Making Zagrus literally the god of pitfalls

310
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,500
Hunter that catches living animals or

311
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,500
Direct translation would be catcher of game

312
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
I would like to know

313
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,020
Oh, yeah, epic Al Simeonus, Mistress Earth Gaia and Zagrus

314
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,340
Zagreus

315
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,580
I'm say Zagreus highest of all the gods perhaps mean the highest god in the underworld

316
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,780
Interesting interesting

317
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Hold on

318
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,460
Zagreus from the Euripides fragment and suggestive Dionysus

319
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
Interesting

320
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:17,620
This Dionysus Zagreus was a son of Zeus and Persephone he was as an infant attacked and dismembered by the titans

321
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,820
So later aboard as a son of Zeus and some now

322
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,540
assembly

323
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,940
Huh, huh. So I'm just reading the Wikipedia page because Wikipedia is very truthful

324
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,060
Dr. Luke Edgar von Kleist tipped one dollar and fifty cents just say again

325
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,340
Flying money loving the stream again

326
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,980
Again, thank you for the tip

327
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,420
Dr. Luke Edgar von Kleist

328
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Zagreus, yeah

329
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:05,460
Trust is what the games tell you authors contradict during each other is very common mythologies. Yes

330
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
Yes indeed

331
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,380
Oh

332
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Okay, uh

333
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
What should I pick?

334
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,420
Which is the best one

335
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
I'm gonna sip my drink while you tell me

336
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,580
This makes me want to play play wedding witch wedding which is a fun game

337
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,540
Well, aren't you just the sweetest?

338
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,420
Dr. Luke Edgar von Kleist tipped two dollars and twenty two cents easy

339
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,420

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,580
Can't heal myself, but I can fight

346
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,820
I like the voice acting

347
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,780
Oh do I just pick up my diamonds?

348
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
How do I dash?

349
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
Nope, that's not it. Um

00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,820

361
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,980

370
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,340
That's a proceed. Is there something I can pick up for health? Is there something like that? I only have four

I can't heal but I can fight you can dodge attacks if you dash the right moment madam. Okay for health in a dream

400
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
The risk is not to me

401
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,180
I expected the olympians would involve themselves in this eventually

402
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,020
Is it next the mother of no more than they already know?

403
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,740

They're all really beautiful

407
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:11,940
Like I have such an appreciation for character design and level design and I am like trying not to geek out right now

408
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Because I could just stand here and be like, wow

409
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,180
Look how they did this. Wow. Look at that. I can't get around these bones

Uh, I don't know who you would be. Maybe like fanatose or something to see your lad killies. What are the circumstances?

412
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:34,100
The hell remember your training. Oh killies also looks cool. Everybody has like some sort of red on their body, which is very interesting to me

413
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,140
That fear is for the weak take care of killies

414
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,460

Killies is a hero of the children war

428
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,700
Well, yes, I know that

429
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,060
I know my great gods guys. Well, he's not a god. He's just a dude

430
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,380
He's a guy that was dipped in the river

431
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,940
For protection, but she only held on by his little achilles heel

432
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,940
And that's where he died and that's why we call it an achilles heel

433
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Come here little guy. Yeah

434
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,940

What is that glowing thing

437
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:07,380
The house of hades that dark and lavishly appointed layer of the underworld's king

438
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,020
Is home not just to him

439
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,740
But to his will, you know, I can hear you old man

440
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,660
Who the heck is the narrating then?

441

Uh, what the hell?

442
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,500
I was hoping that I could like read about these

443
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,380
Perfects. I just want to pet the dog forever

444
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,260
Can I talk to

445
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:37,780
Infernal watchdog surplus regards the underworld prince with mixed emotions from purest joy to deepest melancholy

446
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,060
You watch over things for me, won't you boy? You know, I'd take you if I could

447
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,140
Oh, uh, hi dad stupid boy

448
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,060
I told you no that is such a badass design for hades

449
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,300
Who how was your wanton ransacking of my domain?

450
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,260

451
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,020
Greetings, father

452
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:08,500
My ransacking was a delight. Thank you for asking. It really like is the air that we're in a big hall. The echo is really good touch

453
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,860
Be on your way indeed

454
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,380
What do I care?

455
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,380
You shall never reach the surface

456
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,260
Go see for yourself

457
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,420
This is so cool

458
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,140
Because yeah, hades is also the god of like money

459
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
And that's a really good touch

460
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,340
That they have like him covered in jewels

461
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,300
Wow, I love it

462
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,020
What's this? Can I see you see these blueprints?

463
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,220
All right, um

464
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,220
Looks like I go this way probably

465
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,580
Hey room, I'm back room

466
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:52,740
Mirror mirror on the wall. Here's the handsomeest little boy in the mall night in darkness guide me

467
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,740
Okay

468
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,140
Oh, all right, um

469
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,300
Okay, I'm gonna do this one

470
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:20,180
The power of darkness a power of darkness compels you the bed chambers of prince zagreous lie in a perpetual

471
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,180
Look at my little bed

472
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,180
I have just a child teenage boy room

473
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:30,820
Repeatedly insisting that he pick everything up second game calls him homer. Oh that makes so much sense then

474
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,820
Then it's homer

475
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,340
That's a good savory snoring he's dragging a chair across the floor

476
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,780
But I know he had a good mustache. Will she be reached the surface?

477
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,780
Do I bet this game is long and I don't just reach the surface

478
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,420
Rest question mark need to sleep

479
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,740
I don't know. Why do you have a bed then you're a freaking god? I like you have a cyclops head

480
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,820
Pretty sick. You have a smaller one. You have a lot of smaller ones

481
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:07,380
Then you have a gorgon head which it doesn't really make sense that the gorgon head has

482
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,580
Like a skeleton hair but go off this

483
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,300
Excuse me, um

484
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,860
Cool, I like it. Look at my clothes. Do I like to write?

485
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:28,980
Nifty, so I probably die a lot and come back if I have to come back and reflect often

486
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:38,020
What is it? Oh, okay, so it looks like I can get hades his pitchfork

487
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:45,460
A little poker need to find a key and then I'm assuming that's something of

488
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,700
Aries again, I'm just guessing this based off of aesthetic

489
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,380
And then look like uh, Athena's bow. I mean not Athena's bow. What's her name?

490
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,180
Artemis's bow. I can escape through that pink window there

491
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,820
Why do I want to get out so bad? What happened? Why do I hate my dad?

492
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,060
I just want to walk over here first. Oh

493
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,980
I can do this

494
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,140
First get past the retrochates of Tartarus

495
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,540
Easier said than done and doubtless. I'll be running into Meg

496
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,540
I remember flame ought to be just beyond Meg from find a way up to Elysium Hercules

497
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,940
Magara, let's give it another shot

498
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,860
Are this chamber reached five? Okay, cool

499
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:40,420
What's that? No, keep sex yet. Oh fascinating. Okay

500
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,420
Cool, cool, cool. Hi Nori. I love you too, Nori

501
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,820
It's Achillesphere. Oh, okay ready

502
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,380
Oh music is good too

503
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,820
Thunder is that thunder thunder thunder cats

504
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,620
Zeus

505
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,980
Okay

506
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,020
In the name of Hades Olympus. I accept this message

507
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,740
Why do I have to say the name of Hades if I'm mad at my dad?

508
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,860
Hey, what's up? It's me

509
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:24,820
Look your father's always been rather difficult. I want to voice acting this game so bad. Just make me a nymph

510
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,460
Where you belong? You're on Olympus

511
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,340
And to help you on your journey have my blessing

512
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,180
Sick

513
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,260
I'm assuming I should pick the rare one

514
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,980
There there's a buy one get one sales on the surface and he needs to get some new shoes

515
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,740
All of the art

516
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,260
He has a little nymph

517
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:02,180
Technically could beat this game on your first run, but it's definitely not the intent of the developers. You were going to die a lot. Gotcha

518
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,860
Zagreus's name Zagreus name doesn't hold much sway in Olympus. I imagine

519
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,980
Isn't Hades also the name of the underworld?

520
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,060
No all up to me this one's rare

521
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,780
I kind of want the rare one

522
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,260
Okay

523
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:36,180
Lord uncle Zeus lending his support never thought I'd see the day or night whenever

524
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,820
Oh, no, it's ended too

525
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,820
Ah, oh

526
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,980
Oh, oh fuck. I wasn't paying attention

527
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,020
I don't where's my oh, there's my sword. I have to like summon it into the shit

528
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,140
Shoe

529
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,340
There's blood in the pit. No way to patch up. We've got to keep going

530
00:51:54,660 --> 00:52:00,420
Why does his voice sounds familiar his voice sounds like the narrator from just

531
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,380
Slay slay the princess. That's

532
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,140
I'm so sure that it's him

533
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,820
The underworld of lord Hades. Please somebody look that up

534
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:16,180
It is a guy who voices Zagreus the same guy that voices the narrator and slay the princess

535
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,660
Good thing i'm not dead

536
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,500
Uh

537
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Sure

538
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,780
What is it now what the fuck is that little skulls?

539
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,020
Is there a lock-on ability because I would like that

540
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,700
Right

541
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,460
Oh, I can blow the candles out and then they read that. Oh, man

542
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,220
I saw that coming from a mile away, but I stepped on it anyways. Ow

543
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,220
Ow

544
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,820
Okay

545
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,260
I'm not good at this game. That's for sure

546
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,860
I'm gonna die again

547
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,900
Will that be all?

548
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,780
I gotta keep something back home. Do I get some health?

549
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,700
Please

550
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,400
Nope, it's not. Oh, they they sound the same

551
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,260
Yeah, I got a dash more

552
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,340
He's only voices. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. I uh, I forgot something

553
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,940
I

554
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,140
Call my hair is like red for a second. Sorry. I forgot something

555
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,380
What's up?

556
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,940
Oh, one of those wretched louts just killed you dead that time those mean old slappy guys

557
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,980
Shut up

558
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,940
Uh, oh, what are you?

559
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,940
Some sort of special offer for me my good shade

560
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,660
Okay

561
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,460
I like how I'm just approving this and my dad doesn't care. I don't know what these mean

562
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,100
Oh, this game is a lot more intense than I thought it was

563
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,860
Okay

564
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,980
I can change the I can decorate

565
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,740
I like I was just like a little shade in the ring hard hats. That's so funny. Hi dad

566
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,060
I am the prince of uh

567
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,900
What's it called

568
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,940
Home decoration

569
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,420
One whose responsibility is to work on this house

570
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,900
The who shall pay for everything my subjects here demand. I do not know he voices with zag and hades

571
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,300
really

572
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,700
They don't sound the same. He's very good voice actor

573
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,860
A lot of depth

574
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,140
You can stun the red health enemies like that guys. I'm not gonna listen to any of you. I hope you know that right now

575
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,180
You think I'm gonna remember that I don't even remember how to play

576
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,260
I can't remember what the attacks are half the time

577
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:49,700
Some are just visual novel you have to read descriptions very difficult roguelikes with dark souls of a difficulty really

578
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,020
All right, you're trying to guilt to me into funding the exorbitant furnishings you desire

579
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,380
Perhaps once we are finished with repairs for all the carnage you have sown throughout my realm

580
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,780
Then we might finally have time for all the needed renovations that have piled up

581
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,340
Okay, nice

582
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,420
Cool. Hi dicks darkness guide you child

583
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:16,020
You have outgrown this house of that. I am now certain

584
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,820
I won't forget your next size

585
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,860
I like how we're talking like I'm not gonna be back in like five minutes

586
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,820
Do I need to I didn't catch anything so I don't really need to look in the mirror

587
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,380
I should go

588
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,380
Oh, so if I oh

589
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,380
Okay, there we go

590
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,780
Koran oct the heart seeker

591
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,100
Let's deal some depth

592
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,180
Over here. What the

593
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,660
Hold

594
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,740
Whoa

595
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,340
Dr. Luke Edgar von Kleis tipped one dollar and fifty cents I heard again

596
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,220
This is weird

597
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Oh

598
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,900
I almost felt that I like guys just hanging out

599
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,660
Carl Knox, that's a badass name

600
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,460
But I like the sword

601
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:37,540
It's skelly best character can I talk to him place? He got your boy. Oh name skelly has it going but enough with the smart talk already

602
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,500
I'm here to do a job. So let me have it. Give me everything you got

603
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,540
I don't remember having you on payroll mate. Who's your supervisor?

604
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,300
Wow, the boy's acting so good

605
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,260
Just try and beat it out of me

606
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,340
If you insist

607
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,620
um

608
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,420
Are you like a sucker for pain?

609
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,460
What was the other attacks I could do

610
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:20,580
That's a volley that's pretty cool. Whoops. Oh, is I not supposed to kill him?

611
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,060
I got you pretty good. Oh, you made me nervous dude. I thought I killed you

612
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:34,420
And you're just a sucker for pain, aren't you? It doesn't really matter though. You think somebody would patch this window up

613
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:42,100
The bow makes fights much easier dash around kite the enemy's lead is fine. Okay

614
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:53,540
Oh Logan Cunningham voices Hades with four voices ag and skelly. Yeah, I could tell he voices skelly. I could I could hear that

615
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,700
Can you feel pain if he's only bones? Well, he looks like he has some sort of like stuff on him

616
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,300
Again

617
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:09,620
By the power of who's next like a Daedalus hammer

618
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Is this gonna be

619
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,540
Let me guess

620
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,620
Let me guess

621
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,020
What's that one guy that married Aphrodite?

622
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,300
Enchantments for my weapon. Oh, no, it's just a Daedalus hammer. Okay

623
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:32,260
I thought it was gonna be called as Daedalus because I know like Daedalus Icarus blah blah blah

624
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,860
I'm talking about. I thought they're just calling whatever one of the what's the guy's name

625
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,940
Their attack fires two shots at my son

626
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,340
Oh, that sounds a sense

627
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,860
Like

628
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,340

00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Whoa

630
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,380
Oh my god

Ouchy, uh, I did it. Yeah, I see more. I did it

632
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,820

638
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,140

I'm an astrology girl. You can't hurt me

642
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,580
I'm already almost dead what I wouldn't give a say what do these mean?

643
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,940
I

644
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:05,860
This is hard. This is arrow. I don't know. I'm gonna go to the thing. I don't recognize

645
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,660
Alrighty, all right, don't step on those motherfucking things. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I missed

01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,980
No

648
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260

Oh god

653
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:46,020
Yeah, yeah, I'm attacking like I have the sword, but I don't

654
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,820
Oh

655
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,740
I'm not good at this

656
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:05,060
Hmm had to come back for something right quick

657
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:13,380
Don't talk to me

658
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,260
I probably have to talk to you

659
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,980
I'm embarrassed

660
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:25,460
What you're back already. Hey, my list says that you barely leave me alone. Hypnos

I didn't feel bad. I'm not good. I'm I'm learning

662

What this how goes the chains?

663
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:37,540
Oh, I like they're just chatting. They're chatting about how I died

664
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:47,380
Skelly what's up, honey showed up shut up

01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:00,660
Thank you. Hi Zeus. I didn't mean to press that

We need to get a young man yours isn't by a fair right

667
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,900
That's cool. Uh

668
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,460
Especially because of the lightning bolt

669
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,220
Oh, I like the electric shot

670
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,180
I haven't been dashing a lot. I'm gonna do this one. Is my hair sticking up?

671
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,900
So

672
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,340

Okay, I'm learning. Okay, don't step on these fucking things

677
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,460
Uh

678
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,220
Like I found a key cool a key to a weapon nifty

679
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:13,940
Okay, so I can either talk to Zeus or is there another one?

680
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,980
Like how my dashing is just echoes, okay

681
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,140
Okay, so if I win I get to talk to Zeus again

682
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,740
These ones I need to stay away from

683
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,180
What the hell

684
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,100
That worked

685
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,540
Okay, I kind of ought to lock on so that's fine

686
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,900
Okay, okay

687
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,540
Oh

688
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,940
Oh, that's probably we'll kill him. I probably need that

689
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:32,260
What's this do I get like ambrosia?

690
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,180
You either talk to Zeus or talk to Zeus

691
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,100
Easy snipe. I'm a sneak bear

692
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,980
Sneaky

693
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:52,740
Oh god, at least you died from that mostly

694
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,780
You stay away. Oh, yeah, you jump pretty far

695
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,660
Oh, but then yeah, if you hit me you get more damage

696
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,100
I'm just gonna back up

697
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:15,860
All right, let's see. I don't know how this dashing hit. I don't know

698
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,740
Oh, I can't shoot that. That's not an enemy. Ah, I'll turn to that. Oh, no, not you

699
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,340
Um, I have one health

700
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,980
Yeah

701
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,980
Yeah

702
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,060
I need to get out of this corner

703
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:42,900
Oh, I don't know why I did that. I'm so stupid. I didn't mean to step on that

704
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,860
No

705
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,700
It locks onto their hipbox. Okay, that's good to know

706
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,100
Oh blasted spank traps everywhere. Okay

707
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,620
I like how I just talk about how I died

708
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,900
Oh, what do you have to say? So you got steward via spike trap out there, huh?

709
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:08,100
Oh, okay. I hypnos. I don't think I'm ever gonna talk to you again. Welcome home boy

710
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,300
You're late. That's all right father

711
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,260
I'm asked repeatedly for the construction of a sundial, but every time

712
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,660
Why would you need a sundial if we're underground?

713
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,740
Why would you need a sundial if we're underground?

714
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,860
For all our sparring practice, there's no teacher like the real thing

715
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:34,660
What why you're giving me your codex I can't please I insist

716
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,940
I don't know what this means

717
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,100
Oh

718
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,780
Okay

719
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,420
Oh

720
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:10,340
I like the smug expression that hypnos has on his face

721
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:19,780
What this what once was a small lounging area within the house of Hades now was sealed off in utter

722
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,340
That's cool. So Chris destroyed the lounge again

723
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,820
Or the aesthetic

724
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,780
Hello

725
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,940
I will get whatever that means

726
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,300
there

727
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,940
My nice whatever animal this is this doesn't look like a bear. It looks like a lion

728
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,740
But it also looks like a lion bear

729
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,820
lion avatar

730
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:54,900
Hi skelly. What's up pretty quick in old boy. Oh just be sure to use that fancy dash of yours

731
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,540
Yeah, you're right mad instead of standing still

732
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,220
You're right. You should do that. Um

733
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,740
This needs more keys to open

734
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,340
Oh if I equip I get 20 percent more

735
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,620
Should I do that?

736
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,740
Should I do that? Is that a thing I should be doing?

737
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,940
I'll do it

738
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,300
Shut up I'll grab it

739
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,540
Because I get bonus

740
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:35,700
Okay, but for death's defiance, okay, I don't know what that is but sure

741
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:40,100
Let's see what I can do with this sword

742
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:45,140
Attack becomes a big chop. The deal is 90 base damage

743
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,420
I don't know what that

744
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:57,300
Uh, I don't have any obels so I am going to take this

745
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,780
All tuned up

746
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,500
You can cancel your attack animation with dashes good to know

747
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,700
So let's see what? Yeah. Yeah

748
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:18,740
Oh, yeah, this is really narrow. Um, I'm trying to think

749
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
At my side

750
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,180
Nifty nifty

751
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
Oh

752
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,340
I really killed that one over there

753
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,540
Right away

754
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,580
50 I can use this to unlock a weapon

755
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,420
So I can either what does this one mean?

756
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:07,220
Because this one I I'm assuming I talk to a guy. It's probably Artemis and then this one is what?

757
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,420
Isn't that my symbol? I don't know

758
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,260
Ah

759
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:24,100
I need a any dash to the dash has a little bit of a cool down

760
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,140
It's like

761
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:29,140
I got two second cool down

762
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,140
This means money

763
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,540
Money money money

764
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,860
Must be funny

765
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,260
Interest man. Well, do I go here then?

766
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,540
Is money is important should I get monies?

767
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,660
Did I do I need monies at this early stage?

768
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:52,180
Or would it be worth it to talk to whatever god?

769
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,260
I said because it's eagle

770
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:00,580
I'm assuming this will be for like cosmetics and stuff for the work whatever

771
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,140
For the contractors

772
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,380
Can't die they die first

773
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,580
You don't hold on to the money if you die

774
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:18,580
So then how do I get back to the hub if I can use it if I can't use it

775
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,380
I thought I only get back to the hub if I die

776
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:25,060
Booms are better talk to the god. Okay

777
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,420
I'll probably die

778
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,380
Money is run dependent good to know

779
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,380
Oh, I meant to run away

780
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:50,340
I'm trying to run but I'm not running pressing the wrong button to run

781
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,740
Ow, I don't like these guys

782
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,380
Yeah

783
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,820
Let's keep spamming that

784
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,140
Hello

785
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,100
Yeah, I was gonna say

786
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:32,340
I'm like does it all also shoot arrows because the sisters are

787
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,300
Oh, I love her design look at her little owl friends

788
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,460
Thanks Artemis

789
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,060
Oh

790
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:53,140
Dash strike

791
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,700
Maybe this will be helpful the hunter dash

792
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,340
Although because I already have

793
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,980
Hmm

794
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,940
Innovation money is different as a different currency. Oh, okay

795
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,580
It's the biabilities. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Good to know

796
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,940
She's the crit lady

797
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,900
Crit damage

798
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,900
Here

799
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,900
Hmm me me me me me

800
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:40,340
He me me me me me me. What are you guys's suggestions?

801
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:46,900
No bad abilities. All right. I'm gonna go with the dash because I feel like I'm gonna try to utilize dash more

802
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,700
The hunt sounds like good company to keep. Why do I have a giant book?

803
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:54,020
Oh, damn. I love all the fucking art in this game

804
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,940
Oh

805
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,940
Well, I would have done option one had I known

806
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,660
Okay, that actually cancels it out

807
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,580
Ow

808
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,260
Oh

809
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,780
I hate these things

810
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,940
Oh, I walk I keep thinking that's an enemy, but it's the thing

811
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,140
Okay

812
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,380
Yeah, I gotta learn how things stack on each other

813
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,420
One with my sword chop would have been good. Okay

814
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Ouch. All right

815
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,580
Again, there are no bad options. This is not the cash for this. What even lied to you

816
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,260
Oh, what's up?

817
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:11,460
Are you just gonna tell me how I die each time such a dignity for my own kin shut up dad. I'm it's not a face

818
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,860
Achilles, is it really true that Cerberus ripped the lounge up right after I left?

819
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,900
I only wish you could have seen it lad

820
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:23,060
The place looked like a vineyard after typhoon. Your lord father was livid

821
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:28,020
But he never gets so angry with the doll. No, I wonder what became Medusa

822
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,420
She's always worried father's going to fire her even without something like that. Is that Medusa?

823
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,100
Where's my dog

824
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:43,700
Cerberus must be asleep somewhere. Maybe this is my room. Well, that was quick

825
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,260
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

826
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:49,700
Lucky, I've got other family be careful whom you give your trust

827
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,580
My brother's frolic on Olympus

828
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,860
Oh

829
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,180
What the heck who is that

830
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:08,820
Is that Medusa's head

831
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:15,540
I uh just wanted to say don't bother picking up my room today

832
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:18,180
I'm headed out for a while. She's a cleaning lady

833
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,300
Oh my god, I love her voice

834
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,940
What

835
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500
She just flew up to nowhere

836
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,860
Hemnos is the biggest back seating little brother

837
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,820
I like Medusa. Dusa is fun to speak

838
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,780
I I um

839
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,780
I have to clean the rafters

840
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,660
Hello

841
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,580
Oh

842
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,620
Why do you look so upset

843
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:58,500
A commemorative board adorns one of the stoic walls within the lounging area

844
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,740
Celebrating it won't ever see my face up on that wall. I who is that?

845
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,020
I want to know who that is on the wall for employee of the month

846
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,860
And he adjusts my booty cheek is getting sore

847
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:15,940
What are these things on the ground are they supposed to be chairs

848
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:21,380
These are so weird. I just clipped through them greetings chef

849
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,620
Can I ask you for food?

850
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:32,500
Look at these little guys. I like how they disappear when I walk with them. Does the chef disappear? No, the chef is solid

851
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,500
What about you you disappear?

852
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,700

Oh it's Cerberus's hair. Oh

859
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:08,820
So I've already expected Cerberus to be in my room like sleeping on my bed or something. Um

860
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:15,860
I don't think I have anything. Yeah, I only have two death defines

You go pick them up. You understand

01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,540
I'm just saying generally from the midsection since

867
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,340
Okay, that makes sense

868
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,580
I'm gonna grab this again. I need my bow

869
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:51,780
All flashing the power shot

870
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,140

872
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,740
That's not really flashing

873
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,820
Release while flat what is while flashing mean

874
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,660

875
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,940

When zag flashes white

878
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,500
Oh, oh, it's a timing thing

879
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,100
Gotcha, okay. I'm not gonna ever time that properly

880
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,060
Again

881
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,180
Again

882
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,180
Again sound

883
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:09,620
Dionysus question mark. Is that a ball of wine? What the heck is this? I can't even tell what the symbol is

884
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,620
People having a good time. Well, sure then

885
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,780

You've been saving you a spot. Let me see what I can do. I love this design the purple

888
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,820
It's like I don't must remind me of like male Azura because of the purple

889
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:35,060
Oh, my character designs are so gorgeous

890
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,500
Wow, look at the grapes. Oh my god

891
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,780
He is like a little pine cone staff

892
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,900
That's so cool

893
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,860
I

894
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:53,460
Pack inflicts hangover what is a hangover

895
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:00,260
Is that like a stun like they get like

896
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,500
Like some keeps taking down. Oh, okay stacks. So it's almost like poison

897
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:14,580
This seems like it's a airy aoe

898
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:25,140
We call the pantheon for a reason she bx Dionysus fan fix it coming. No, no

899
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,260
It's a debuff. Yeah

900
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,980
Drunken strike I just turned into broccoli

901
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:37,060
I can't wait to see

902
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,580
More characters

903
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:46,420
I'm like very excited because everybody's gorgeous and just the art is so beautifully drawn

904
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:57,380
Yes, yeah, I was at the beginning of the stream I was reading that they're almost essentially the same person

905
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:02,900
They're like two sides at the same point. Um

906
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,460
I really honestly Zag's

907
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,580
design

908
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:11,700
Really interests me because I'm wondering what's going up with this heterochromia

909
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,220
I wonder if that's like a stylistic choice or has some purpose or meaning to it

910
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:22,500
I didn't see what color I don't think Dionysus like had a true eye color in this art

911
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,100
Because it would be cool if they gave like Dionysus like the same

912
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:30,020
Thing but swapped to just acknowledge that connection

913
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:35,380
I think you go for the three I was thinking about going for the three

914
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,900
But press

915
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,940
Yeah for the

916
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,940
Okay

917
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,420
I'll take this one leave it to the god of wine to lighten things up around here. I want to see it

918
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,980
What the heck

919
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,420
Oh

920
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,900

923
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:26,500
Smack the debuff in a special for AoE damage over time option

924
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:30,900
Aries boons or his damage doesn't get simpler. Yeah

That's better. Let's see if I can gather them up in a circle. Yeah, that works. They're all close

939
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:07,220
Yeah, oh, what the hell I'm not paying attention. I forgot that was gonna run out

940
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,660
Crashing waves a trident

01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:13,540
Uncle number two. It's got to be

942
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,500

01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:51,460
In Greek mythology Poseidon is the biggest man who are in a show. What are you talking about? That's Zeus

960
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:54,980
Zeus is a man whore

961
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:59,380
In my opinion

962
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:02,980
Zeus just great juice boxes people a lot actually

963
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,260
Yeah

964
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,980

pomegranates. I'm assuming that's Persephone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

973
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,860
Let's talk to our mom

974
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:21,380
He has the most children. I didn't know that goddess of ropes and rabbits

975
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,500
Oh be a bun goddess

976
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:37,860
I could be like one of Aphrodite's daughters because like, um, I think in like, uh,

977
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,420
What is it? What mythology mythology?

978
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,620
Ishtar

979
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,700
Is like

980
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:54,020
She's like I forget which version but she's she's not Aramaic. It's not Hebrew

981
01:29:54,980 --> 01:30:02,180
I forget but she her symbols. That's where uh, Easter comes from her symbols are the agon or rabbit

982
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,660
and they just mix the

983
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:08,980
Spring equinox and Easter so that the Christians would be happy

984
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:12,500
Maybe I could be like her

985
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:19,700
Because she has a fertility goddess as well and then me and Azur can be fertility goddesses together

986
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:23,620

01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:08,500
How do I shoot again? I keep doing the volley instead of anything else

997
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,580
What the hell

998
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,820
A palm of power

999
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,980

01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,620
Yes, that worked out

1028
01:33:57,620 --> 01:34:01,540
I need this one, I guess is the host one so that makes sense. Oh my god, I can't get out

1029
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,180
Now once you guys walk over here, how about that?

1030
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:10,660
Okay, um, let me get this back

1031
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:15,940
Oh god, oh, I feel that the wrong way. Okay, it doesn't matter

1032
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:28,020
There we go cool and then we press that

1033
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:35,060
Okay

1034
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:40,900
The power of Olympus, so yeah, now I can just do that one better blessing

1035
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:45,620
Let me grab. I wonder if I leave the room when I would just not have it still alive

1036
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:48,340
Not for long

1037
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:53,140
Who wins in a torque off your LeBron James LeBron James

1038
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:58,100
Uh, okay, I wish I could have a little bit more hail

1039
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,060
But it is what it is

1040
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,620
Why am I

1041
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:05,700
Glowing

1042
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:13,700
Oh, no, I knew that was gonna stack immediately

1043
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:19,940
They also they have such a long range that was good though. That was a good run

1044
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:25,460
The jam comes back to me father. Well

1045
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,620
All right, I like AoE stuff. That's my favorite

1046
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:33,860
I don't even want to talk to you. Can I talk to you? Oh, I can listen to you both

1047
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:40,500
I like how he has flowers come out from him. Are they poppies because that would be funny

1048
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,140
I like how they put the weirdest pitch on her

1049
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,100
Like what why did they

1050
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:59,300
Why did they make her voice like that? I like it. Don't get me wrong

1051
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:03,300
But the voice changer maybe the voice changer is supposed to be obvious

1052
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:14,420
Honestly, I feel like Dusa is voiced by hypnos the same person

1053
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:20,980
Get on it hypnos

1054
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,780
I don't

1055
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:29,380
Be quiet dad. I was wondering Achilles

1056
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:33,060
Any news of Orpheus of late? I've not that I believe he is

1057
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:37,140
Your father he was not too pleased with him last time I saw him here

1058
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:40,580
I hope so too or Orpheus if you do see him ten of my said hi

1059
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:45,060
When his lady friend and his lady love, um

1060
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:50,180
What's over here? What's that? It's locked

1061
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:53,540
Oh

1062
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,700
If I don't pet your other heads don't bite my arm off

1063
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:01,700
Oh

1064
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:11,300
I love you. How you holding up boy eating well lately

1065
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:20,180
Each terrifying more of the infernal watchdog service responds affirmatively one after the next

1066
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:28,100
It's always funny to me when animals and games like no english, but they can't speak it

1067
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,820
Hey, they're just like the language

1068
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:36,820
They're just like there's like bark

1069
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,460
Hi dad. I see you've decided to come home

1070
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,260
Changed your mind yet. I definitely

01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,340
We're looking for more pain and suffering

1072
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:46,740
Dusa is like a little

1073
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:51,540
I was going to say something but there's a right. Hi serenity. Hi raiders. Hello

Sooner or later this life that you have chosen for yourself shall teach you. I was right double bunny

1303
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:23,300

Hi, Charlie. Thank you for the super speaking of pre gods. Have you had I heard you have a collab coming up?

1314
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:15,140
Who told you that?

1315
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:18,020
I am collabing with mythos

1316
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:20,020

Remind if I do so I can't wait to hang out with them hanging out with Poseidon and Apollo

1320
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:37,220
It's really cool

1321
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:39,540
She's the goddess of starting your stuff

1322
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:43,620
Aphrodite and Hades related uh technically since

1323
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,300
Hades

1324
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:49,060
since it's

1325
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:51,540
I know Aphrodite was born from the sea

1326
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:55,860
But

1327
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:58,580
I forget I Poseidon not Poseidon. Um

1328
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:03,220
Zeus does have some all the gods related don't even think about it

1329
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:06,180
My special has more damage

1330
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:10,020
I could buy all of these

1331
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:14,260
Should come in useful

1332
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:18,180
Might as well since I have enough monies

1333
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:21,460
I

1334
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:23,860
Yeah, it is Hades would be her uncle

1335
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:30,100
I wonder if Sharon actually shows up

1336
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:36,260
I'll get one of these

1337
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:38,500
Oh

1338
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:49,460
Oh, shit, what the hell is happening? Oh my god

1339
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,660
That was hard

1340
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:03,540
I believe you're collabing with real greek gods. I know it's really cool

1341
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,500
Poseidon told me

1342
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:09,780
Oh, that's cool

1343
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:12,340
And reveal her. Oh, she oh, that's so cool

1344
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:21,700
Yeah, I can't wait. It's so funny. Um back when I was rena. I did a I was telling Poseidon this I did a watch along of

1345
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:26,020
Their reviews again, I was like a small indie so it's not like anybody

1346
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:28,020
It wasn't like a sponsored thing or anything

1347
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:31,540
And I really love Poseidon's design and I loved her

1348
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:34,420
Visual novel debut thing

1349
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:38,820
And I remember pretending to respond to like

1350
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,980
Her questions

1351
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:47,060
It was goofy. It was funny. So it's really cool full circle that actually gets to hang out with her. I'm very I feel very lucky

1352
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:49,460
um

1353
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:53,220
I'm very excited to like branch out and hang out with girls on their corpos

1354
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:57,620
And like I already hung out with you may plus and we're hanging out with them again, and I'm really happy

1355
02:01:57,700 --> 02:01:59,700
I'm happy. I'm making more friends

1356
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,500
Cheers

1357
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:07,780
Rude, where's my dog?

1358
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:24,340
Yes, that's how fast I read I just look at it and it's red

1359
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:27,620
Hey, what's up?

1360
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:37,060
Hell as you once did Achilles though doubtless many of the shades who stand against me first arrived in Tartarus because

1361
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:39,780
that's funny

1362
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:43,700
It's weird because Achilles looks like an old band from far away, but

1363
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:48,420
I can't really tell let's see this face. I feel like this is like a teleportation thing

1364
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:51,140
um

1365
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:53,620
Where's my dog?

1366
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:55,620
I

1367
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:03,140
Enhancement some part are artifact ever shifting on the road

1368
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:09,140
Okay, you ever shifting chambers of the underworld ought to be a little livelier with this

1369
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:14,260
You are distracting me. I'm not doing anything dad. Chill out

1370
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:20,500
Oh, I can get rid of the clumps of fur. That's funny

1371
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:25,780

02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:31,860
Was repair so there's repair and decor

1373
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:35,780
Okay

02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:45,380
Hello

02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:50,180
Hello this guide you child

1378
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:57,620
I like how her skulls on her chest look like really bashful and embarrassed

1379
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,580
Are you learning about the gospel truth? Yes, I am

1380
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:10,580
Emi plus cloud was wrong. That was so much fun. Oh my god. I haven't laughed that hard in such a long time

1381
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,540
It was so fun

1382
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:20,500
Voice actors work hard, I agree. They really do they do such a good job

1383
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:26,020
I want to be I seriously it's literally my dream to voice act in a game like this. That'd be so awesome

1384
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:30,340
Going from zero to hero in no time flat

1385
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:34,580
You want her to do dog things very busy stuff there

1386
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:38,420
Thank you next. How you doing Toma

1387
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:45,460
My hands are cold. My circulation's been bad. My shoulders been flaring up a lot

1388
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:48,820
And I

1389
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:51,620
Had to lift some boxes and so I strained it even more

1390
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:56,420
And it was really hard to lift and so but thankfully the thing that lets me

1391
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:59,220
drag stuff around the little

1392
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:03,700
Uh beach cart or buggy thing came in so I was able to bring my trash down

1393
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:06,020
But of course it was heavy and I had to bring it upstairs first

1394
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:09,060
That hurt

1395
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:12,260
Oh, let's do what's greater reflex. Oh

1396
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:18,420
Um

1397
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:24,020
Oh

1398
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:34,180
How's it going? Hi, if you don't know who I am I actually be cottonbump your favorite girl failure dumb extraordinaire

1399
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:36,980

02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:40,020
I'll spit on you hit to talk to her

1401
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:45,860
I hope you caught that in your mouth. Um, we're playing Hades. It's my first time playing. I really like it so far

1402
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:51,220
I didn't know how much I enjoy roguelikes ever since I played call the lamb. I love this one. I hope you guys had fun

1403
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:53,460
in tempestream

1404
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:57,380
You should talk to Poseidon's use some VA experience. She likes to give advice

1405
02:05:57,460 --> 02:06:02,340
I definitely will talk to her about that. I'm great. I'm sipping ice coffee and reaching about wish again

1406
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:04,660
I still have to watch that movie

1407
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:10,900
I really want to watch it. Oh temple. Let me let me let me give you a little

1408
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:13,860
The hot girl wrench as they call it

1409
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:21,140
Hot girl wrench people keep talking and I can't catch up to your name

1410
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:28,740
Whoa, where'd my game go?

1411
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:33,460
Where'd my OBS go? Everything's ruined. It's just kidding

1412
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:38,020
Ah, my arm hurts. It hurts to flux my reef my little

1413
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:40,500
Fingies

1414
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:44,180
I've played pegglin. I love roguelikes and she tried Hades soon. I

1415
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:47,380
I've never heard of that one. What's that one about?

1416
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:54,260
You can rage together. Yeah, we can do a watch along with that. I heard I I remember seeing some stuff that I just like doesn't make any

1417
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:56,260
sense whatsoever

1418
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:58,980
Because it's like it's like the villain actually is more

1419
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:04,180
Understandable than like the main character is what I've heard

1420
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:07,940
Hot girl wrench. Yeah, you get the hot girl wrench

1421
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:15,220
Teiglin is very cool. I'll have to look at that one. I didn't know how much I like roguelikes, but I do. I like them a lot

1422
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:19,940
Oh and five keys I can how many keys do I have?

1423
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:22,180
How many keys do I have?

1424
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:25,300
No, she would tell me

1425
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:29,620
Need more keys

1426
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:34,580
Need more keys all set cool. Okay

1427
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:46,340
It's like peggle, but a roguelike. Oh, that sounds good. I can't unlock this don't have enough keys. I want the pitchfork

1428
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:49,300
Yay

1429
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:51,380
All right

1430
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:53,700
I like I like

1431
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:59,540
That yes, I am shut up. Um, I wonder what else shows up here. I wonder if I eventually get more

1432
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,420
What's that?

1433
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:06,660
The courtyard of the house of Hades is it's not that orderly really

1434
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:10,580
It's not I like how like lackadaisical he sounds

1435
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:13,940
Let's look at this beautiful view

1436
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:16,420
This will all that the way to the surface

1437
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:24,420
Like how it's running rivers of blood how fast is this like how far away is the surface?

1438
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:28,500
Like a hundred chambers. I bet it's something ridiculous that I'm never gonna get to

1439
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:32,180
One more time. No

1440
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:37,620
Poseidon come on. Let's go. Oh

1441
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,060
Aries

1442
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:43,060
This one was bound to show up. I guess

1443
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:50,660
Those areas look like spirit in you there. I have to say that's such a cool most intriguing

1444
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:57,700
Then you have no surprise to be honest. I'm very surprised with the amount and tell me all about of poc

1445
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:03,060
That there is in this game

1446
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:04,500
It's very cool

1447
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:07,540
But it's also just like they're also like very uniquely colored

1448
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:13,620
It's very like there's different shades because like a theme is a little bit more grayish purple and he's like

1449
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,500
more of a

1450
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:20,260
Yeah, red undertone brown

1451
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:25,220
It's very that I really like the diversity in their designs and they all are very true

1452
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:28,340
to like their lore the

1453
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:30,900
The the artist really took

1454
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:33,860
lots of care

1455
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,100
and um

1456
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:38,020
In designing uh

1457
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:44,420
These characters. I really really really like it. Also, uh, the helmet thing it reminds me. Oh

1458
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:47,060
What is it?

1459
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:49,060
Slade from

1460
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,620
From teen titans because a little thing on their thing

1461
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:55,700
Or like when robin this mini slade or whatever the heck

1462
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:05,700
Your attack inflicts doom

1463
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:08,420
I

1464
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:14,580
This is so cool

1465
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:20,980
Oh my god, I love the art. I'm just sharing a tag holding up Ares little thing. I'm a bobber

1466
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:30,820
Oh my god, it's freddy that game of Hades is epic intense and interesting. It really is you're so right freddy

1467
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:34,340
Oh

1468
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:37,300
It takes the first damage

1469
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:45,540
Huh

1470
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,700
So if I run

1471
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:49,860
It'll leave something behind me

1472
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:54,660
This one is is rare though. I might go with the rare one

1473
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:00,180
Hmm

1474
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:02,740
Yeah, let's try it the war is on

1475
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:07,220
Oh

1476
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:12,100
Ow, I'm already getting hurt

1477
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:26,260
I feel like I should have got a different one

1478
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:36,340
So

1479
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:50,100
Music is so good

1480
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:56,440
Gemstones sick

1481
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:03,380
I can talk to Ares again. I kind of want to keep stacking Ares's stuff because that would be cool

1482
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:06,580
Ah

1483
02:12:13,380 --> 02:12:15,380
Nice, what is that?

1484
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:19,700
Oh, okay, it's like a little bomb thing

1485
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:24,340
Interesting interesting. I bet if I hit it

1486
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:29,140
Oh, I bet it would have damaged him if it was closer

1487
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:36,580
I

1488
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:46,580
Yeah, I do think I like being having a ranged weapon

1489
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,060
He did the music for the game

1490
02:12:54,660 --> 02:12:56,660
Damn, that's cool

1491
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:00,180
My cast ends up lay

1492
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:03,140
Oh, I can just have them all

1493
02:13:15,940 --> 02:13:18,740
Oh, this is a hard choice these are very good

1494
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:24,660
Ares is cracked. Yeah, that's why I was like, let me pick Ares again

1495
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:29,140
I feel like this would be good because this isn't

1496
02:13:30,180 --> 02:13:32,180
This will be an aoe

1497
02:13:32,660 --> 02:13:34,420
Not really

1498
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:36,420
Maybe I don't know

1499
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:41,780
Which one do you guys think I'm gonna take a sip of my drinky pool

1500
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:53,620
Too is pretty good for shred. Yeah

1501
02:13:53,620 --> 02:14:03,060
Blade rift is fun. Let's try it. I want to see what it looks like

1502
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:11,220
Is that all you got to say about that violence? Is there another room? Okay, it looks like it's just this one

1503
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:16,260
Violence

1504
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:19,220
Oh

1505
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:22,260
Nifty, okay

1506
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:27,700
It's very slow though. I have to cast it very close. All right

1507
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:34,340
Now I hate these guys

1508
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:46,020
Where the fuck did you come from? Oh bounces back and forth

1509
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:55,140
Oh

1510
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:01,140
I might die at this one

1511
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:04,340
Yeah, I died at this one

1512
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:13,220
I like that it comes back to me

1513
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:24,500
Hmm

1514
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:34,420
I can get moneys or I can get moneys. I was hoping I would get something other than moneys

1515
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:47,540
Oh, they jump so far

1516
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:54,260
Oh

1517
02:16:17,380 --> 02:16:20,980
The guards should fetch me something

1518
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:28,340
Does it fetch me something do is there a little oh usually would sit over here, but it's not there. Uh, okay

1519
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:35,560
If I fight fat men I might lose

1520
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:59,220
This is a good follow-up because then I can throw this and then I can just be like try to get that sweet spot and then

1521
02:16:59,220 --> 02:17:01,220
Just keep shooting

1522
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:06,100
Okay, they don't get that far I can't see what I'm shooting at

1523
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:09,540
out

1524
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,500
I'm stuck I'm stuck

1525
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:21,060
Yeah, me really cornered there because I couldn't get out of there

1526
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:27,620
All right, oh my kid can I drop that oopsies?

1527
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:32,420
Who is this is that's a person

1528
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:38,100
What does that mean? So this is Poseidon and he'll give me some really good boost. I can see

1529
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:42,900
That I'm also at 10. What does this mean?

1530
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:46,820
I don't know that means

1531
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:52,660
You have met Aries the god of war lightning strikes

1532
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:59,300
Very intense. Oh, this is that guitar

1533
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:04,180
Hmm

1534
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:09,940
That's a shot. Oh, okay, then I'm just gonna go here. I don't really care about the shop that much

1535
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:12,260
Oh

1536
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:18,100
What the hell are these? Oh my god

1537
02:18:22,660 --> 02:18:24,660
Oh, this is gonna be hard

1538
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:41,940
So

1539
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:04,740
Oh, does their stuff build back up

1540
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:12,900
Oh

1541
02:19:21,140 --> 02:19:23,640
Oh, it's stupid fucking pillars in the way

1542
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:42,660
Oh

1543
02:19:48,100 --> 02:19:50,100
Is he stuck

1544
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:56,100
All right

1545
02:19:56,180 --> 02:20:00,180
It's by understanding you've been blessed already by one of my other nephews Aries

1546
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:03,540
As you can see not all of us are cut for the same cloth

1547
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:06,180
And thank the fates for that

1548
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:08,180
Oh, yeah, okay

1549
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:11,220
I think the dash would be good

1550
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:14,660
But this is good

1551
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:21,380
No good

1552
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:24,980
I can only use that once though. I would prefer the title dash

1553
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:30,900
Who felt that? Oh, yeah, that's good

1554
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:37,220
She's cracked not even true

1555
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:58,740
Let's come at even

1556
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:13,060
Oh, baby, see I I'm so glad I got that dash

1557
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:17,620
Who should I give this to

1558
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:21,540
A me is there anybody else?

1559
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:24,020
Okay

1560
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:29,220
That's the farthest I've come the aoe madam is so humble

1561
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:33,780
All right

1562
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:40,100
Actually, maybe if I can get them

1563
02:21:48,420 --> 02:21:50,420
Aoe's just go to in this game

1564
02:21:51,540 --> 02:21:53,540
So

1565
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:30,020
This is good choke point. I'm gonna kill this guy first

1566
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:37,540
Oh, damn it

1567
02:22:46,820 --> 02:22:49,540
Oh, holy shit, okay, cool

1568
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:55,380
I love the dash the dash is so good

1569
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:02,900
Uh, should I get a key I'm gonna work on getting more of these

1570
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:15,620
Dad survive for 45 seconds

1571
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:23,540
Oh

1572
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:43,620
Oh, the dash is goaded. Oh, I couldn't even shoot in here. Oh

1573
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:50,740
Almost there

1574
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:54,500
I

1575
02:23:56,020 --> 02:24:02,180
Literally just gonna dash a shit ton no for the best enough there we go

1576
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:08,660
Okay, I got money it's fine

1577
02:24:10,340 --> 02:24:12,580
Sorry, I'm like so locked in I'm like this is fun

1578
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:16,900
Oh, I love this

1579
02:24:22,340 --> 02:24:24,980
These are cool because I can just dash through them and they die instantly

1580
02:24:31,060 --> 02:24:33,060
And then I can also

1581
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:38,100
Grab that back

1582
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:53,540
Oh

1583
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:09,380
I keep walking into those

1584
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:23,540
Hmm

1585
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:26,820
I'll get a key because last time

1586
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:32,340
This game is funny

1587
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:41,860
Oh god, oh, oh, I'm not gonna lose one

1588
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:44,580
So

1589
02:25:50,180 --> 02:25:52,980
Oh, yeah, this is very hard

1590
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:04,020
Oh look ahead

1591
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:13,860
Oh

1592
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:44,260
Oh

1593
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:51,300
Bro this I need to any time I get a dash I'm getting a dash

1594
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:55,460
There's no way I'm getting I'm not getting a dash

1595
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:59,780
Uh, that's the bank and then I rather oh, there's nothing

1596
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:06,500
Okay, what does this do

1597
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:11,940
I don't sleigh foes quickly

1598
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:27,780
I don't know what I'm doing

1599
02:27:37,220 --> 02:27:39,220
Oh

1600
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:58,100
This is fun, okay

1601
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:03,220
Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool

1602
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:09,620
Nifty nifty

1603
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:13,620
Oh your tack fire

1604
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:17,460
Three shots and spread pattern

1605
02:28:19,140 --> 02:28:22,820
Hades every day next week. No, we're gonna replay some Elden Ring

1606
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:28,900
I'm kind of wishing I waited to make my schedule because I would have thrown Haiti on the list

1607
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:30,500
Hades on the list

1608
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:33,220
Our time for our shoot by said three shots and spread pattern

1609
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:38,900
I

1610
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:42,580
Like the range

1611
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:52,580
This is pretty much my volley, but it's

1612
02:28:54,820 --> 02:28:56,820
A little bit stronger

1613
02:28:57,780 --> 02:28:59,780
This will chain it

1614
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:02,260
I would prefer the volley

1615
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:06,020
Because I don't know if I'll have three foes around me. So I don't know if there's

1616
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:09,460
A point

1617
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:18,580
Not to make it. No, but I don't think my manager appreciate me redoing my time schedule. What is that?

1618
02:29:22,900 --> 02:29:27,060
Beyond the present chamber lies the outermost perimeter of Tartarus

1619
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:32,180
Promising terrifying dangers far beyond the underworld princess reckoning

1620
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:39,640
Okay, so I think I'm reckoned quite a bit. I'm assuming I'm getting out of Tartarus if I try if I go this one

1621
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:43,460
Okay

1622
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:46,020
Get ready to schmoove. All right, I thought so

1623
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:51,780
Well, this is awkward

1624
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:56,900
Pulse agris not one step further. Oh, she is hot

1625
02:29:59,060 --> 02:30:01,060
Oh my god

1626
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:05,060
Mommy, sorry mommy and she has a whip

1627
02:30:13,220 --> 02:30:16,580
Sorry, I'm literally just like dumbfounded right now. I can't I don't have anything to say

1628
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:21,060
I don't have anything to say. I'm just I'm just staring at her majesty

1629
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:26,100
She's a cute little nose ring going on. She's amazingly painted pink nails

1630
02:30:28,980 --> 02:30:30,980
I just

1631
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:34,340
I may if she's a fury

1632
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,020
Oh my god

1633
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:39,540
I want her

1634
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:41,540
I want to furiously

1635
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:44,500
Eat her out

1636
02:30:44,660 --> 02:30:51,540
It's the employee of the mom come on make it. Haven't we had more than enough of each other by now besides don't you have some place else to be

1637
02:30:53,700 --> 02:30:57,540
Your father sent me all and all I'd rather be on your bad side than his

1638
02:30:58,100 --> 02:31:02,260
Now you can turn back like a good little oh, I love her voice. Oh my god

1639
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:04,820
What'll it be?

1640
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:06,820
She's like whisper talking

1641
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:08,820
How don't it be?

1642
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:12,580
Your father sent me all in all I'd rather be on your bad side than his

1643
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:16,180
Now you can turn back a little peek a little good. I can't talk but yeah, you get it

1644
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:18,580
I'll have to go with the painful way

1645
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:22,740
A man after my own heart a man after my own heart

1646
02:31:24,580 --> 02:31:26,580
Ma'am

1647
02:31:27,940 --> 02:31:29,940
I

1648
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:32,180
How

1649
02:31:33,380 --> 02:31:35,380
How did oh fuck I walked into that

1650
02:31:36,820 --> 02:31:40,180
Ah, I'm so stupid walking into these don't think it's wrong with me

1651
02:31:42,100 --> 02:31:44,100
Oh

1652
02:31:49,380 --> 02:31:51,380
Oh, she is really high health

1653
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:59,540
Oh

1654
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:25,220
Oh god, oh god. Oh shit. Oh god. Oh shit fuck

1655
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:29,620
Oh

1656
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:35,940
Hell half no fury a little woman scorned

1657
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:42,180
Oh, oh god, I can dash and kind of be impervious for a bit

1658
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:49,380
I wish I had a super

1659
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:52,580
Oh

1660
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:55,060
Oh

1661
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:58,580
I'm like scared to get near her

1662
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:08,520
I'm not even worried about the fucking smaller dudes

1663
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:24,900
Oh

1664
02:33:27,700 --> 02:33:29,700
Rutches of Tartarus come in

1665
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:56,260
Oh, I'm so stupid

1666
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:06,260
Where is she

1667
02:34:07,380 --> 02:34:09,380
Oh fuck

1668
02:34:09,380 --> 02:34:11,380
Oh

1669
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:24,420
Shit

1670
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:29,780
Damn

1671
02:34:32,660 --> 02:34:34,660
I got I got her what like halfway

1672
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:38,260
That was pretty good. That was pretty good

1673
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:40,500
I'm give that to a friend

1674
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:44,500
No, I'm not giving that to you. That's for sure

1675
02:34:45,460 --> 02:34:50,660
Um, hey, hi, can I give it to my dad? I give it to my dog

1676
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:54,820
I can give it to nicks

1677
02:34:55,220 --> 02:34:59,540
I can give it. Can I give it to oh my god, I can give it to her. Um

1678
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:03,060
Frick there's a lot of people I can give this to this is

1679
02:35:09,140 --> 02:35:13,540
Uh, I probably shouldn't give it to the dog, but although I really want to I'm gonna give it to nicks

1680
02:35:15,540 --> 02:35:17,540
Nicks is my favorite

1681
02:35:18,980 --> 02:35:26,580
Um nicks you've done so much for me, you know, your father does not like it when nectar is doled out on the premises giving her drugs

1682
02:35:27,460 --> 02:35:29,460
However

1683
02:35:31,300 --> 02:35:34,260
I'm very grateful next. What's a black shell?

1684
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:40,420
Oh cool

1685
02:35:44,580 --> 02:35:47,860
Oh interesting is this where the romance I just give them gifts

1686
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:51,940
Really good for the first try. Thank you. Thank you

1687
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:55,860
You have met most of your olympian relatives by now child

1688
02:35:57,060 --> 02:36:00,420
They all still think I'm headed to join them on olympus. That's why they're helping me

1689
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:04,980
Oh, but what am I doing instead? They are helping you because you are family

1690
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:08,180
Interesting it's getting complicated pretty fast

1691
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:10,340
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

1692
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:14,260
Do I have another one? Oh, I have two to give. I'm gonna talk to you first

1693
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:19,460
Turns out that I may be stopping back from time to time like this, but please don't bother picking up my room

1694
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:24,340
I love her so much

1695
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:29,940
Like how my room is just there like it's there's the snow leading to other people's rooms

1696
02:36:30,740 --> 02:36:32,740
Ah, what's up hypnos?

1697
02:36:39,220 --> 02:36:47,620
Beautiful um anyway, I hope the fates are nicer to you next time. Oh, do you have a crush? Do you have a crush hypnos?

1698
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:52,980
Achilles have you ever run across the shade of Daedalus in all your time?

1699
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:56,660
I found some of his legendary hammers out there, but no sign of him

1700
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:03,460
I've never met him no your father keeps him fully occupied with building out his underworld

1701
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:05,700
Indeed I have

1702
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:08,980
Hmm. I might give it to I think I'm gonna give it to Achilles

1703
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:15,860
Hey Achilles look this he's been helpful, but here

1704
02:37:17,380 --> 02:37:19,380
Equip them in the ruppins area. Okay

1705
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:22,180
This really is for me

1706
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:24,180
You beat me to it then. Oh

1707
02:37:25,060 --> 02:37:30,260
Okay Achilles, are we gonna have a bromance? I'm down. I'm down to have a bromance with you Achilles

1708
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:33,860
You know Achilles, thanks so much. They're kind of cute

1709
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:39,860
I know I call you sir, but you can call me sir in the bedroom if you ever want to

1710
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:44,900
Jesus shroud has run up and smile and run away

1711
02:37:47,940 --> 02:37:51,620
Through reminiscable characters wonder which will go through four first

1712
02:37:53,300 --> 02:37:57,860
It's kind of weird because I'm all related to them. So my cat's attacking my feet again. What's up, dad?

1713
02:37:57,860 --> 02:38:02,580
He's back already Cerberus. Hey, I almost beat Megara Megara

1714
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:05,620
Hi Fia, what are you doing?

1715
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:08,740
You're looking for pets? Oh

1716
02:38:14,740 --> 02:38:19,060
I'm sorry. He disturbed your rest again Cerberus. What are you talking about job?

1717
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:22,420
At the the dog loves me

1718
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:29,460
Not everybody knows exactly how to give you pets and live to tell them right boy. Can I pet the other heads?

1719
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:37,140
Is that a thing because they always just come up on the side. Can I pet the other heads?

1720
02:38:39,620 --> 02:38:43,140
Here boy, just as long as one of your three heads enjoys these pets. Okay

1721
02:38:48,340 --> 02:38:50,340
What I can't pet my dog

1722
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:57,220
I got that dog in me. I just want to pet my dog. All right, uh, let's go in here

1723
02:39:00,020 --> 02:39:02,020
And

1724
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:07,860
Where could I equip stuff?

1725
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:11,380
So I have 30

1726
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:17,140
Might as well do that. All right, I'm ready

1727
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:23,540
Because I saw that where was that my cat is scratching in the litter box

1728
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:28,900
It's over here

1729
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:31,540
No

1730
02:39:32,900 --> 02:39:35,140
This one had the others in bite yikes

1731
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:39,300
If you flirt with hypnos, do you technically flirt with Thanatos too?

1732
02:39:40,020 --> 02:39:42,020
Well, Thanatos is death

1733
02:39:42,580 --> 02:39:44,020
He's sleep

1734
02:39:44,020 --> 02:39:46,340
Are you flirting with sleep and death?

1735
02:39:48,100 --> 02:39:50,100
Who is he talking to?

1736
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:53,860
Oh, he's oh this was

1737
02:39:57,220 --> 02:40:00,420
Can you not get into the underworld this is interesting next

1738
02:40:02,260 --> 02:40:05,460
This is such a cute cool not cute, but it's a cool little thing

1739
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:14,580
In the weapons area after the bedroom. Oh, that's right. You're right

1740
02:40:15,140 --> 02:40:20,740
I want to kind of watch like how his beard is a symbol and the symbol also

1741
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:24,980
Is the pitchfork. What is he denying people doing like what is happening here?

1742
02:40:28,580 --> 02:40:30,580
This guy has a little poop on his head

1743
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:37,540
Oh, he's blushing. So what? Oh

1744
02:40:39,940 --> 02:40:41,940
What's the what's the story here

1745
02:40:44,820 --> 02:40:48,260
Oh, I want to see the poop guy go

1746
02:40:56,660 --> 02:41:00,820
What are they claiming? I don't know what's happening. I just want to watch it though. Oh, he's also shy

1747
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:04,660
Can I enter to Elysium?

1748
02:41:05,540 --> 02:41:07,540
Oh

1749
02:41:09,620 --> 02:41:14,660
Poop guy went in. Yay. Good for him. Oh, I can walk through all of them. That's so funny

1750
02:41:14,980 --> 02:41:17,780
Okay, anyways, so that one wasn't too happy about it

1751
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:20,580
Good for good for poop head

1752
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:27,140
He's to have office hours for petitions

1753
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:33,220
Oh, he's like, please talk to me

1754
02:41:34,180 --> 02:41:37,700
What was that? What was that tick-tock noise?

1755
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:45,220
You act as though this guard mode is some sort of lever

1756
02:41:45,220 --> 02:41:49,060
I can simply switch at will if ever I wish to unlock my latent strength there, mate

1757
02:41:50,020 --> 02:41:53,380
Damn zag is like really beautiful. His bone structure is

1758
02:41:54,820 --> 02:41:57,780
All like is the world. Um, okay, uh

1759
02:41:59,700 --> 02:42:01,700
Got something new to try

1760
02:42:01,780 --> 02:42:05,540
So I can but I take 10% from the back

1761
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:14,500
How many can I quit? Oh

1762
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:21,940
Cool. All right, so I should probably give stuff to the other characters as well

1763
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:25,380
Just so that I can

1764
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:28,900
Get more stuff

1765
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:31,460
Cool

1766
02:42:32,580 --> 02:42:35,380
Um, I'm gonna keep the bow. I'm not really worried about that right now

1767
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:38,100
Hi, rena. Wait, who are you?

1768
02:42:38,180 --> 02:42:42,100
Who are you? Who just hopped on my desk? Oh, you're boomy. What the heck? I can't see right now. It's dark

1769
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:45,940
You can sit in the bed. You can't go anywhere else

1770
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:49,940
Oh

1771
02:42:54,580 --> 02:42:56,580
Like this court system

1772
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:58,580
I

1773
02:42:58,980 --> 02:43:05,460
Skeleton sounds like chief Wimbly from Simpsons. Oh, yeah, you're right. Jimmy's taking 10 more percent damage from the back

1774
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:08,180
You pick one

1775
02:43:08,180 --> 02:43:11,220
I pick one. Okay, then I'm gonna pick the shawl then

1776
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:14,580
My keepsakes

1777
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:16,820
Oh

1778
02:43:44,580 --> 02:43:46,580
I

02:43:55,540 --> 02:44:03,300
Wish you guys could see the faces that please make takes when he's pet because he just looks drunk and high and his mouth opens

1780
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:08,580
Like his mouth is open right now

1781
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:11,300
And he's just putting put on the head and he's

1782
02:44:12,260 --> 02:44:19,540
This is funny. I don't know why he does that. He always opens his mouth just like a few days

1783
02:44:37,620 --> 02:44:40,180
Oh boom, we don't leave I want to take a picture for everybody

1784
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:46,740
Hold on. Okay, stay right there. Stay right there

1785
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:50,900
I'm gonna take a video

1786
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:54,740
Wait, boomy, lift up your face

1787
02:44:57,140 --> 02:44:59,140
Please look up here

1788
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:09,060
Oh my god, there's Fia. Oh, this isn't working. You guys are not good. What is happening? Stop hitting each other

1789
02:45:11,300 --> 02:45:13,300
I wanted to

1790
02:45:13,620 --> 02:45:15,620
Why are you clawing my chair?

1791
02:45:17,940 --> 02:45:19,620
Ma'am

1792
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:23,620
It was trying to oh, okay. You guys are just gonna fight. That's fine

1793
02:45:26,180 --> 02:45:28,180
He likes his rubies

1794
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:32,500
Like just imagine like, you know when you like mush a cat's face

1795
02:45:34,180 --> 02:45:36,980
That's what I do to boomy because boomy doesn't like his

1796
02:45:37,540 --> 02:45:42,340
Uh body pet. He doesn't like like back scratchies or tummy scratchies or anything

1797
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:46,180
He only likes his head and his chin scratched and sometimes his chin

1798
02:45:47,140 --> 02:45:51,460
And he may always makes I don't know where he got this from but he just makes a funny face

1799
02:45:52,180 --> 02:45:54,180
When he gets his head pat

1800
02:45:55,060 --> 02:45:57,700
Oh, you're doing it again now that I put my phone away

1801
02:46:07,860 --> 02:46:08,980
I

1802
02:46:08,980 --> 02:46:14,180
Suggested us take whichever weapon is 20% in the early game soon like all weapons quickly. Oh, okay

1803
02:46:15,380 --> 02:46:21,860
I realize I've just been ignoring keys. I need to track down mochathonic keys. Uh, I only have one

1804
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:29,060
I've been I need to get more keys. Um, I'll get this one. No, but I like the bow. I'm shaving bow

1805
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:32,020
Like how I want to play

1806
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:34,020
Because I'm better with bow

1807
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:36,820
I'm a bow user

1808
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:39,780
All right areas Poseidon

1809
02:46:41,140 --> 02:46:43,140
Hermes

1810
02:46:46,020 --> 02:46:48,740
A bat wing it looks more like a bird wing, but okay

1811
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:54,180
It's batman batman picked up

1812
02:46:57,940 --> 02:46:59,940
He's like the sunset

1813
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:06,020
Places to be

1814
02:47:06,580 --> 02:47:08,580
I'm surprised I didn't say like

1815
02:47:09,140 --> 02:47:11,700
Messenger of the gods. They just put god of swiftness

1816
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:17,540
Oh, and he has that little staff thing that I can't remember the name of that's such a

1817
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:22,180
I love his scarf. He literally looks like a sunset

1818
02:47:22,900 --> 02:47:25,140
Like a little phoenix like he's fiery

1819
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:28,980
His little bag. There's a frog in his bag

1820
02:47:29,700 --> 02:47:32,820
I love it

1821
02:47:35,380 --> 02:47:37,380
That's so cool

1822
02:47:41,700 --> 02:47:46,100
But probably not gonna be relevant blows around the fastest weapons to clear the game with specifically one of the blows

1823
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:51,620
Okay, is that a batman my friend? So you got that frog in him

1824
02:47:52,580 --> 02:47:59,220
So I can be faster I can dodge automatically after I'm sturdy

1825
02:48:03,940 --> 02:48:07,540
This would be cool if they could get that dash from Poseidon again

1826
02:48:10,580 --> 02:48:18,180
My attack is faster. I kind of want the hyper sprint appreciate the lift lord. Hermes. Oh, oh, yeah, that's cool

1827
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:21,140
I like that

1828
02:48:34,980 --> 02:48:38,580
He's a swifty I would be too

1829
02:48:41,220 --> 02:48:44,260
Oh, okay, is that a chimera?

1830
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:46,260
Okay

1831
02:49:02,340 --> 02:49:05,700
I got the timing for that right now I get the timing for it

1832
02:49:14,420 --> 02:49:16,420
Yeah, that's not that's not hard to do

1833
02:49:17,940 --> 02:49:25,620
Aw health is there another one? I want to get another boon. This might not be a good run at this rate. Oh, I love the little wee

1834
02:49:30,580 --> 02:49:33,860
So if you do 10 floors, that's when you hit the boss, right? Where am I?

1835
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:46,260
Ow

1836
02:49:46,580 --> 02:49:48,580
I hate these things

1837
02:49:50,340 --> 02:49:52,340
Ow

1838
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:56,420
See this would be great for an aoe right now

1839
02:50:00,260 --> 02:50:05,380
Looks like I just have to keep running around I have to kill these fucking uh

1840
02:50:07,060 --> 02:50:09,060
Ow

1841
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:12,980
Ow, what the hell

1842
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:18,180
I'm trying to attack and I can't

1843
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:22,260
Because I know they're not gonna stop unless I kill them

1844
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:27,560
This is not a good run now

1845
02:50:30,340 --> 02:50:33,780
Need to press on that ought to keep me going for a bit

1846
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:46,900
I

1847
02:50:51,140 --> 02:50:53,140
Know I'm sorry into that

1848
02:50:58,420 --> 02:51:01,540
Now oh I hate these things

1849
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:16,260
I

1850
02:51:35,060 --> 02:51:38,820
Nice all right, let's chat with Artemis

Was good because that defines always give half of HP some more HP. Oh, okay

1853
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:04,580
Kind of want them to come closer to me

1854
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:12,180
So I don't have to worry about them rushing me

1855
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:29,140
Oh god, yeah should have dashed. I don't know why I'm not dashing

1856
02:52:31,940 --> 02:52:34,580

You take good care of corn out for me. So I can try it too once you're up here. I stole it for my dad

1863
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:20,980
I don't like those creatures either. They're so annoying. Yeah, they just like bum rush you. Okay. Your attack is stronger

1864
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:30,020
I'm gonna do my attack is stronger because I've been having to use that more

1865
02:53:30,020 --> 02:53:32,020
I

1866
02:53:34,900 --> 02:53:40,500
Haven't been using the volley as much. I'll do that the dead better hide

1869
02:54:00,020 --> 02:54:02,020
I

1870
02:54:20,980 --> 02:54:23,620
Damn it. Oh, I forgot

1871
02:54:24,580 --> 02:54:31,620
Oh as I fucked that up for myself. I hate these guys are my least favorite enemy in this game

1872
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:44,340
I want to prefer to save my what I need to do with my strat is I need to save my deft defied until I get to Megara

1873
02:54:46,740 --> 02:54:51,060
At least I can talk to Zeus. Hopefully Zeus can give me something good because I would like an AOE

1874
02:54:54,180 --> 02:54:56,180
Just great

1875
02:54:57,060 --> 02:54:59,560
What the frick is this?

1876
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:09,460
Oh god, I'm stuck. I'm stuck. Oh god. Oh god. I don't like this at all

1877
02:55:10,900 --> 02:55:13,220
Oh, oh lord Jesus

1878
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:16,020
Jesus christ. I

1879
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:18,260
Oh

1880
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:20,260
Oh, I can run across stuff. Oh sick

1881
02:55:24,100 --> 02:55:26,100
Um

1882
02:55:26,260 --> 02:55:28,260
Anyways

1883
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:35,780
Uh, I love having only three fucking health left. Sorry two health left. That's great

1884
02:55:38,020 --> 02:55:40,020
Can I get a critical please?

1885
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:42,740
I should get a critical for one of the little guys

1886
02:55:43,540 --> 02:55:45,540
What is happening?

1887
02:55:48,340 --> 02:55:51,940
That run wasn't good because I didn't really get a lot of good boons to be honest with you

1888
02:55:54,340 --> 02:55:56,340
Oh

1889
02:55:57,060 --> 02:55:59,060
That blasted doomstone

1890
02:56:00,340 --> 02:56:02,340
Hi Raina

1891
02:56:06,020 --> 02:56:08,020
Are you gonna come snug

1892
02:56:09,780 --> 02:56:11,780
I want to try to get to Megara again

1893
02:56:13,700 --> 02:56:14,980
I'm stuck

1894
02:56:14,980 --> 02:56:18,500
Raina hold on. I'm trying to put my blanket on my lap so you don't accidentally scratch me

1895
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:20,660
There you go

1896
02:56:20,660 --> 02:56:28,820
Good lady. Yeah, I could pop a squat now. Hi sweetness. What do you want to hug? I can give you a hug. Oh hug time

1897
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:33,620
Hug to Raina

1898
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:39,460
Sorry, she's on my shoulder. She called it my lap and called it up my shoulder to give me a hug

1899
02:56:41,620 --> 02:56:45,620
You smell stinky. Are you in a litter box? Wait

1900
02:56:45,620 --> 02:56:47,620
Hmm

1901
02:56:49,220 --> 02:56:52,660
She looks all offended that I'm sniffing her. I think I'm gonna

1902
02:56:54,100 --> 02:56:56,100
Wipe you down because I think it's

1903
02:56:56,420 --> 02:57:00,900
I think it's the medicine. She just smells like medicine because I've been giving her medicine

1904
02:57:02,100 --> 02:57:04,100
Can you give me some medicine?

1905
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:08,020
Oh, my cat's food is about to go off

1906
02:57:08,660 --> 02:57:14,900
Doomstone more like boo stone

1907
02:57:16,900 --> 02:57:22,900
Little guys don't do damage. The big guy chains laser the small ones in fixed directions. Yeah, I think I figured that out

1908
02:57:26,020 --> 02:57:28,020
That's why I was targeting him

1909
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:31,620
But thank you

1910
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:40,020
Hmm

1911
02:57:43,060 --> 02:57:47,140
And boomi's not back on my desk boomi, can you lay down in the bed?

1912
02:57:48,980 --> 02:57:54,500
Can you not try to attack my wires? I'm covered in cats right now. I have cat hair in my face from right up

1913
02:57:57,780 --> 02:58:03,380
And she pulled my headphones out now I gotta stick my headphones back in

1914
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:10,020
Okay

1915
02:58:14,020 --> 02:58:16,020
This I can't hear anything

1916
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:22,340
These headphones are nice

1917
02:58:28,820 --> 02:58:32,500
The first time you give a book guys, you're telling me things that I've already figured out

1918
02:58:32,500 --> 02:58:34,500
Oh

1919
02:58:36,500 --> 02:58:39,940
Looks like you ran smack into the doomstone out in Tartarus think

1920
02:58:40,580 --> 02:58:44,340
I'm no I'm dumb and blonde, but I'm not that dumb and blonde. How goes it?

1921
02:58:45,380 --> 02:58:51,380
Why does this room feel weirder? I like the room got bigger. Your enemy is not the wretched dead and not your father

1922
02:58:52,980 --> 02:58:54,980
The underworld itself

1923
02:58:55,540 --> 02:58:58,500
Sorry, I'm reading was that there before?

1924
02:59:03,380 --> 02:59:07,860
Hi dad go to your room. Oh, okay

1925
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:13,380
Who is that?

1926
02:59:13,700 --> 02:59:16,900
Who is that? Oh cat's food is going off

1927
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:21,060
Let me help you get down this arena

1928
02:59:21,780 --> 02:59:23,780
There you go

1929
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:26,660
Cat food dispenser my beloved

1930
02:59:27,220 --> 02:59:36,820
Tip shields can block damage what? No, I can block damage with a shield

1931
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:42,980
No way bro. I had no idea you could rock damage with a shield

1932
02:59:44,020 --> 02:59:50,260
Not that that's the purpose of a shield or anything. I had no idea. Holy crap. Thank you guys. I appreciate it

1933
02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:55,380
Nix sometimes I get the impression the olympians look down on those of us born of the underworld

1934
02:59:59,700 --> 03:00:03,460
The gods of mount olympus tend to think themselves above us child

1935
03:00:04,580 --> 03:00:06,580
I can't imagine him otherwise

1936
03:00:10,020 --> 03:00:14,820
All right, let's reflect. How am I looking?

1937
03:00:15,540 --> 03:00:20,740
I'm going to save so I can have greater reflex

1938
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:34,180
Um, I still don't have enough keys. I haven't really ran into any keys

1939
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:42,340
Skelly I feel like you're up to something

1940
03:00:44,820 --> 03:00:47,860
Leave it at that now. Let's see it break some of these bones, huh?

1941
03:00:48,580 --> 03:00:54,100
It's kind of weird how much he wants you to hurt him like I know he gets paid for it, but like I'm good

1942
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:57,460
Is there anything? Uh, let me see

1943
03:00:58,820 --> 03:01:00,820
That one looks interesting

1944
03:01:03,220 --> 03:01:05,220
Oh

1945
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:07,300
Because then I can get really good crit stuff

1946
03:01:08,500 --> 03:01:10,500
Cool cool cool. Nice

1947
03:01:11,460 --> 03:01:18,660
It's actually a really cool boon. I will definitely try to find a nectar so I can give it to Poseidon because that would be probably really good

1948
03:01:20,420 --> 03:01:23,860
Tip the number at the bottom left should be hitting through there. Okay, got it. Thank you

1949
03:01:25,140 --> 03:01:28,340
That's gonna be I didn't know that before I thought that was just there for show

1950
03:01:29,460 --> 03:01:34,100
Normally it's for killing things, but in your case it makes it even easier for me to hunt you down

1951
03:01:35,140 --> 03:01:37,140
What are you gonna give me? What?

1952
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:41,780
It said it would give me rare stuff you fuck

1953
03:01:58,020 --> 03:02:00,020
You lie to me

1954
03:02:08,020 --> 03:02:16,020
Okay, at least I can get a key people time when they are killed. No, you're lying

1955
03:02:18,500 --> 03:02:23,940
You're lying to me what the fuck I could have sworn there was another dude like in this corner over here

1956
03:02:38,020 --> 03:02:40,020
I

1957
03:02:41,620 --> 03:02:46,100
Got okay. I got attacks. I got oh sweet Daedalus

1958
03:02:49,460 --> 03:02:51,460
I like this game

1959
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:54,740
Hi, how are you?

1960
03:02:56,980 --> 03:03:01,060
I would give you hot girl wrench, but I'm killing skulls

1961
03:03:04,180 --> 03:03:06,180
Give me a moment

1962
03:03:08,100 --> 03:03:10,100
I

1963
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:15,460
Okay, this is like the choke point from before

1964
03:03:18,740 --> 03:03:20,740
Ow

1965
03:03:22,340 --> 03:03:24,740
I don't care about them. I just care about oh

1966
03:03:27,220 --> 03:03:29,220
Come on. There we go

1967
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:40,660
Is bunny lady, that's me. I'm the bunny lady. How are you doing chill a dino has been spotted

1968
03:03:45,060 --> 03:03:48,980
You're unvulnerable with that block up from that direction even may lays get drunk what

1969
03:03:49,780 --> 03:03:53,700
Names are so you know their names. Just let you know since it's so well

1970
03:03:54,020 --> 03:03:56,020
It is

1971
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:02,020
Yeah, I names what's a name I have no idea

1972
03:04:04,900 --> 03:04:11,300
Monsters don't go to hell with their kills smack that bow with a hammer. What's the worst that could happen?

1973
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:15,780
The lady has been given a wrench

1974
03:04:18,100 --> 03:04:23,460
It's just the edge I need okay, um whole attack shoot rapidly but I can't power shot

1975
03:04:23,700 --> 03:04:25,700
No, I don't like that

1976
03:04:26,980 --> 03:04:28,980
Holds

1977
03:04:38,100 --> 03:04:40,100
I'm gonna charge folly

1978
03:04:41,620 --> 03:04:43,620
Oh brother

1979
03:04:46,820 --> 03:04:52,020
Okay, I want to get one of these because I want to give one to Poseidon because Poseidon I really like his dash

1980
03:04:53,940 --> 03:05:00,900
Can you touch my ears? Okay, only you only you can touch my ears. I'll give you I'll let you touch him because you're so cute

1981
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:09,300
It is a privilege only given to a select few

1982
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:15,060
I'm just gonna shoot at nothing

1983
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:17,540
Oh

1984
03:05:23,060 --> 03:05:25,060
Oh frick I got stuck on the table

1985
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:32,420
All right, at least that worked out perfect sweet sweet literally because it's nectar. Ha ha

1986
03:05:34,660 --> 03:05:36,580
No fair

1987
03:05:36,580 --> 03:05:41,060
Yeah, I'm lying about it everybody only Tio can touch my ears. You can't

1988
03:05:41,380 --> 03:05:44,260
Ha ha ha and the other girls from my my you know

1989
03:05:45,140 --> 03:05:49,140
The girls that I deem for the which is all of them. Just like you guys because you guys are trash

1990
03:05:58,340 --> 03:06:06,440
Oh great here we go. What is this? Oh my lord have mycy on me, please

1991
03:06:11,060 --> 03:06:13,940
What is this portal thing? It's locked. How will I ever know?

1992
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:21,780
Oh, what the frick am I doing? I didn't mean to dash. I meant to oh, I was a cute girl. I'm nervous

1993
03:06:21,860 --> 03:06:25,220
I don't know how to act. I'm I'm underperforming at performance anxiety

1994
03:06:41,060 --> 03:06:43,060
What's the portal for though

1995
03:06:44,180 --> 03:06:47,380
It looks so soft my ears are very soft. They're like velvet

1996
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:53,060
Even better than velvet. Why is the money locked? I have oh, I don't have enough points, probably

1997
03:06:58,340 --> 03:07:01,300
Zesty oh, can I please get up? What the heck?

1998
03:07:03,700 --> 03:07:05,700
What does that do?

1999
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:08,580
I bet that

2000
03:07:08,980 --> 03:07:11,620
I'm generally interested in what that actually does for me

2001
03:07:13,380 --> 03:07:17,380
Ever no one will notice I'm underperforming everybody's watching me. I'm gonna pee myself

2002
03:07:18,020 --> 03:07:20,020
I'd love to take the portal but I don't have enough

2003
03:07:20,980 --> 03:07:24,020
Would it just bring me to magura? I feel like it would make another key

2004
03:07:26,100 --> 03:07:28,600
Someone's there. Well, I'll never find out

2005
03:07:28,600 --> 03:07:30,600
I

2006
03:07:38,280 --> 03:07:41,800
Might die this run again, I'm getting shitty boons

2007
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:48,520
I actually have to play well

2008
03:07:58,760 --> 03:08:02,280
No freaking don't go behind the pillar. Oh freak. I didn't mean to do that

2009
03:08:09,240 --> 03:08:14,680
I can use this to unlock a weapon. Oh perfect Poseidon. Oh, yes, perfect. Oh freak. I only have 10 health though

2010
03:08:17,080 --> 03:08:22,440
It brings you to a special character. She literally cannot take the portal

2011
03:08:29,240 --> 03:08:32,200
She already learned to blame the boons. Oh, no

2012
03:08:33,400 --> 03:08:35,400
Oh, why?

2013
03:08:54,760 --> 03:08:56,760
I'm not gonna make it

2014
03:08:59,320 --> 03:09:01,320
Oh

2015
03:09:01,960 --> 03:09:03,960
Fuck I forgot

2016
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:10,600
I don't care about little dudes

2017
03:09:13,080 --> 03:09:15,080
Oh

2018
03:09:15,080 --> 03:09:17,080
I don't want to fuck this up

2019
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:21,800
I fucked it up

2020
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:26,280
Damn that thing is hard to deal with if I had the dash I would

2021
03:09:26,840 --> 03:09:31,560
I if I had a if I just had a better dash, I think I would do better or if I had a better um

2022
03:09:32,920 --> 03:09:34,920
Something or other it's fine

2023
03:09:38,360 --> 03:09:42,200
I want to give the boon to Poseidon because I feel like he had something good

2024
03:09:51,800 --> 03:09:53,800
They know as much as weird

2025
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:58,440
Uh, I don't want to talk to hip-nose because he's just fucking fucking shits on me each time

2026
03:09:58,920 --> 03:10:00,920
So how did it go?

2027
03:10:01,560 --> 03:10:03,560
In that case, I'll spare you the details

2028
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:05,240
Fine

2029
03:10:05,240 --> 03:10:07,240
Your failure is quite easily

2030
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:09,400
Sorry, I read fast

2031
03:10:09,400 --> 03:10:11,400
Even though I love the voice acting

2032
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:14,200
I happen to know whom I should thank for the weapons just outside my chambers

2033
03:10:14,440 --> 03:10:19,880
Short kinks. Maybe like bullet hells. Well, you're in hell and there's a lot of damaging hit boxes

2034
03:10:20,840 --> 03:10:22,840
Let's charge time in the bow would be nice. Yeah

2035
03:10:25,400 --> 03:10:27,720
No Poseidon dash and run go next

2036
03:10:30,440 --> 03:10:32,440
If you hit the pillars off times you break it

2037
03:10:34,760 --> 03:10:36,760
Had no idea

2038
03:10:42,680 --> 03:10:44,680
Oh

2039
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:47,400

2040
03:10:47,720 --> 03:10:52,520
Finally I'll fucking talk to you. Hey, you keep dying you happen to run into my brother anywhere out there by any chance

2041
03:10:53,160 --> 03:10:55,320
I haven't seen him in ages. What's with the long assignment?

2042
03:10:56,360 --> 03:10:57,960
Something about a war

2043
03:10:57,960 --> 03:11:01,560
Father sent Thanatos to take stock, but you're right. It's been a while now that you mentioned it

2044
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:04,760
Where are you?

2045
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:06,760
Let's see what else

2046
03:11:07,560 --> 03:11:09,560
Everything under control sure

2047
03:11:10,040 --> 03:11:11,560
I can

2048
03:11:11,560 --> 03:11:13,560
Drive money too pricey for me

2049
03:11:14,280 --> 03:11:16,280
Deep rising up a me

2050
03:11:17,320 --> 03:11:19,960
I've changed the color. I'd rather fix the lounge

2051
03:11:22,520 --> 03:11:25,000
I'd rather do like repair rather than

2052
03:11:26,120 --> 03:11:27,480

2053
03:11:27,480 --> 03:11:31,000

03:11:42,120 --> 03:11:44,440
Do you want to go on a date with me because I would go on a date with you

2057
03:11:44,920 --> 03:11:50,280
Oh, uh, drink sometimes sounds wonderful. Do so. Maybe tomorrow assuming I'm not getting out of here by then

2058
03:11:54,200 --> 03:12:00,120
It's no big deal. I mean forget I asked I'm flirting with a head. Can I use her as an onahole? I mean what?

2059
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:09,160

2077
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:56,440
No, no, no, I hold I'll hold myself back

2078
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:06,920
She's so hot look at her cheekbones among the gardens of Olympus here. I love her little rose headdress singing

2079

Yeah, give me that fucking passion dash. Oh, I don't know I did that

03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:13,400
Oh my god, I'm like a little sparkle fucking princess over here. What the hell? I love it

03:15:15,640 --> 03:15:21,000
This game is so pretty. Hi me. Well, hold on frick. I needed to do another hot girl wrench

2089
03:15:22,760 --> 03:15:24,760
How fast can I do it?

2090
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:28,760
Okay game paused I didn't know I could pause the game

2091
03:15:31,640 --> 03:15:34,680
All the cuties are out in full full force today. Oh my god

2092
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:41,260
I'm gonna I'm afraid I'm gonna underperform again because it's a cute girl watching

2093
03:15:52,280 --> 03:15:54,280
I like how the skulls are like, huh?

2094
03:15:56,440 --> 03:15:58,440
Oh

2095
03:15:59,800 --> 03:16:01,800
Get the freaking aoe

2096
03:16:07,160 --> 03:16:09,160
I was trying to dash out the way

2097
03:16:10,760 --> 03:16:12,760
Yeah

2098
03:16:13,640 --> 03:16:16,920
No, no, oh frick. I need to go to the choke point

2099
03:16:17,720 --> 03:16:19,720
Okay

2100
03:16:21,240 --> 03:16:23,240
Come on

2101
03:16:23,800 --> 03:16:29,960
Oh, I didn't mean to dash forward. There we go a centaur heart

2102
03:16:35,880 --> 03:16:41,800
Do I get drew let's get more of these I'm looking for hours. I just got shy I've been performing well. Oh

2103
03:16:42,360 --> 03:16:44,360
Oh

2104
03:16:44,360 --> 03:16:49,560
I'm blushing you can't tell because I can't reach my toggles right now, but I'm blushing so much

2105
03:16:54,440 --> 03:16:56,440
Actually, I'm gonna stay on the side

2106
03:16:58,920 --> 03:17:00,920
I always love my little lurkers

2107
03:17:03,640 --> 03:17:05,640
Especially if they're cute girls

2108
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
No, wait, let me just

2109
03:17:11,320 --> 03:17:14,200
Make it so you guys can't get over here and jump at me

2110
03:17:16,280 --> 03:17:18,280
Oh

2111
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:22,920
I really like this game. Uh, oh d. Los hammer. Let's freaking go

2112
03:17:26,440 --> 03:17:28,440
I'm gonna melt under the pressure

2113
03:17:28,440 --> 03:17:30,440
Oh

2114
03:17:40,200 --> 03:17:42,200
This is a bad area

2115
03:17:45,720 --> 03:17:47,720
I don't have anybody to shoot at

2116
03:17:50,440 --> 03:17:52,440
Now now

2117
03:17:55,240 --> 03:17:57,240
I got me in the freaking choke point

2118
03:17:59,240 --> 03:18:06,760
I don't know. I keep pressing the wrong button. Uh, let's see a special fire. I might

2119
03:18:08,280 --> 03:18:10,280
Do four plus shots

2120
03:18:14,520 --> 03:18:17,320
The triple shot was actually helpful because it locked onto multiple targets

2121
03:18:18,600 --> 03:18:20,600
Uh

2122
03:18:22,360 --> 03:18:24,360
I do like that

2123
03:18:24,360 --> 03:18:26,360
I

2124
03:18:26,600 --> 03:18:31,160
Where is the hundred I cleared that last map for you, baby girl

2125
03:18:32,200 --> 03:18:37,160
Uh, I don't really need to go to the shop. So I'd rather get a key so I can unlock that little pitchy fork

2126
03:18:45,160 --> 03:18:47,160
Oh frick

2127
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:53,240
I need to get them to walk on this I can shoot it

2128
03:18:54,360 --> 03:18:56,360
Come on

2129
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
Yeah, there we go

2130
03:18:59,640 --> 03:19:01,640
Perfect

2131
03:19:02,360 --> 03:19:04,360

2132
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:23,400
Come over here big guy come on sweet hot

2133
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:27,960
Oh just for you just for you

2134
03:19:30,040 --> 03:19:32,920
That hit me. Oh, I guess I did a key to a weapon

2135
03:19:34,440 --> 03:19:39,640
What does this mean? Which way this way because I don't know what it means and I'm curious

2136
03:19:41,880 --> 03:19:44,440
I mean the mods discord not nitro

2137
03:19:45,320 --> 03:19:47,160

2138
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:51,400
How much you miss all the time triple shot is a no brainer root you dick

2139
03:19:51,400 --> 03:19:53,400
I

2140
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:56,360
Don't even have discord nitro. Who are you?

2141
03:19:57,720 --> 03:19:59,720
Are you freaking sisyphus?

2142
03:20:01,320 --> 03:20:03,320
Oh, it is

2143
03:20:03,560 --> 03:20:05,800
Oh, I didn't get to read that on a little strollers all

2144
03:20:06,440 --> 03:20:11,560
Do me a favor though. You see the fury sisters. Let them know. I accidentally moved my knee and I bumped my

2145
03:20:12,440 --> 03:20:17,480
Hand to press the button. Oh, I'll let them know. We'll write. I hear you loud and clear your highness

2146
03:20:17,720 --> 03:20:20,440
Why is that rock have a smiley face on it? You take care

2147
03:20:21,400 --> 03:20:23,400
I

2148
03:20:24,280 --> 03:20:26,280
Got my guy

2149
03:20:27,160 --> 03:20:29,160
Oh

2150
03:20:35,080 --> 03:20:42,440
What your life total is 68 out of 75 lose it all for an express trip back to the house of hades. Why would I want that?

2151
03:20:44,360 --> 03:20:46,360
Used to permanently go stronger

2152
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:50,920
Why

2153
03:20:51,880 --> 03:20:53,880
It's boldy what

2154
03:20:59,320 --> 03:21:04,520
Wait, so I'm kind of confused. So if I talk to him, he just gives me something or is he gonna send me back to hades if I click

2155
03:21:04,520 --> 03:21:06,520
this one

2156
03:21:10,760 --> 03:21:12,760
Let's find out. Oh shit

2157
03:21:13,720 --> 03:21:15,160
Cheers mate

2158
03:21:15,160 --> 03:21:18,760
The underworld's power. Oh, actually that was good. Oh aphrodite

2159
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:22,600
Oh, god, is am I gonna talk to this thing again?

2160
03:21:25,160 --> 03:21:30,360
Okay, I won't kill you. Okay, cool. You can do it. Oh, thanks, Sisyphus

2161
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:34,760
Oh freaking hell

2162
03:21:48,760 --> 03:21:51,720
I kind of wish I had the Hermes around for this

2163
03:22:18,760 --> 03:22:21,720
Yeah

2164
03:22:48,760 --> 03:22:50,760
Oh

2165
03:22:57,480 --> 03:22:59,480
Why did I stand there?

2166
03:23:01,160 --> 03:23:03,160
Anyone else

2167
03:23:03,720 --> 03:23:09,000
Anyone else that was pretty badass people die when they're killed

2168
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:14,760
Oh special deals were

2169
03:23:19,480 --> 03:23:21,480
I

2170
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:28,680
Can max out my life do I get more life empty inside

2171
03:23:33,800 --> 03:23:36,280
I feel like I get more life, don't I permanently

2172
03:23:38,760 --> 03:23:41,400
I need an answer. I don't think the wrong thing on accident

2173
03:23:43,560 --> 03:23:45,560
Her weak effects have longer duration

2174
03:23:49,560 --> 03:23:51,560
I

2175
03:23:53,240 --> 03:23:55,560
Take a sippy while I wait for you guys to catch up in the ball

2176
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:01,000
Raina you're so cute

2177
03:24:02,840 --> 03:24:07,080
Oh, and they give you more you get more in the future. Okay, I thought it permanently raised my life

2178
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:12,760
I'm not gonna do that. Then I'm going to do the empty inside the longer duration because then

2179
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:17,000
Wait, I thought that would make this longer

2180
03:24:17,960 --> 03:24:20,120
I don't know whatever it is or really fucking matter

2181
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:38,040
This is helpful against them

2182
03:24:41,320 --> 03:24:43,320
Is there a bone thing no

2183
03:24:47,160 --> 03:24:49,160
Oh, what the hell? Oh

2184
03:24:54,440 --> 03:24:57,080
Oh, we shouldn't walk on this out

2185
03:25:06,280 --> 03:25:08,280
Sure

2186
03:25:17,720 --> 03:25:20,200
No, I thought that was gonna be I would like more boons

2187
03:25:23,720 --> 03:25:28,520
Why don't I just knock down? Frick Raina you're falling off of my lap

2188
03:25:30,680 --> 03:25:32,680
Okay, let's just hop down

2189
03:25:33,640 --> 03:25:35,640
Hold on. I need to get more comfy

2190
03:25:37,800 --> 03:25:40,760
Can't believe this game has a pause. I'm not used to games with pauses

2191
03:25:40,760 --> 03:25:42,760
I

2192
03:25:42,840 --> 03:25:45,960
Still haven't beaten those stupid twin things and

2193
03:25:46,760 --> 03:25:48,760
Elden ring because I haven't played since

2194
03:25:49,240 --> 03:25:51,560
My last stream, but I'm probably gonna do that

2195
03:25:52,920 --> 03:25:54,920
After these

2196
03:25:59,320 --> 03:26:02,440
No, not you fuckers. Oh, I swear to god. Oh, no

2197
03:26:07,240 --> 03:26:09,560
Oh frickin hate you guys

2198
03:26:10,920 --> 03:26:12,920
Oh

2199
03:26:22,360 --> 03:26:24,360
They have so much reach

2200
03:26:26,440 --> 03:26:28,440
Okay, I'm getting the timing right

2201
03:26:33,800 --> 03:26:37,000
Oh, why did I turn around? Oh, fuck this fucking

2202
03:26:37,960 --> 03:26:40,440
These have too much range in my opinion

2203
03:26:48,600 --> 03:26:50,600
I was hoping I could get to lane with spikes

2204
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:00,600
Come on

2205
03:27:01,560 --> 03:27:03,560
No, why'd you walk around it

2206
03:27:07,960 --> 03:27:09,960
I

2207
03:27:13,080 --> 03:27:15,080
All right, let's get the poem

2208
03:27:16,680 --> 03:27:18,680
Yeah, that's when virgins

2209
03:27:31,880 --> 03:27:34,120
I stand behind here I could probably

2210
03:27:37,160 --> 03:27:39,160
Walk

2211
03:27:41,880 --> 03:27:44,280
Yeah, I could walk him there right on cue

2212
03:27:53,800 --> 03:27:57,480
She's stuck in there. Oh, that was weird

2213
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,160
Oh, fuck me

2214
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000
Okay

2215
03:28:58,360 --> 03:29:00,360
Extra blessing

2216
03:29:01,240 --> 03:29:03,960
I woke up and madame is winning as she is

2217
03:29:04,840 --> 03:29:07,240
Oh shout with aries to buy something

2218
03:29:08,280 --> 03:29:10,280
Oh, that's not what I meant

2219
03:29:17,960 --> 03:29:19,960
I spy everything because I have the money

2220
03:29:23,960 --> 03:29:25,960
Where the fuck am I

2221
03:29:30,440 --> 03:29:32,440
Yeah

2222
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:38,600
Now

2223
03:29:40,680 --> 03:29:45,800
Yeah, I think I thought if I I can't really hit them that well with the arrow

2224
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:48,840
I think it's easier to deflect stuff with the fucking uh

2225
03:29:50,600 --> 03:29:53,160
With the dash or with the

2226
03:29:58,200 --> 03:30:00,200
Or with the sword in my opinion

2227
03:30:00,920 --> 03:30:05,800
Because I feel like and obviously what's with the fucking shield

2228
03:30:11,240 --> 03:30:14,120
Ow and realize that the moment I stepped on it

2229
03:30:24,680 --> 03:30:26,680
I might die for this one

2230
03:30:30,440 --> 03:30:32,440
I

2231
03:30:41,880 --> 03:30:43,880
Because it's hard to shoot those things out of here

2232
03:30:50,840 --> 03:30:54,040
Hey, what's up aries let's fucking go

2233
03:31:00,360 --> 03:31:05,000
And one shot back in the war. Oh fuck. Yeah, please do take care of it. I do

2234
03:31:06,280 --> 03:31:08,280
Athena dashes great deflect

2235
03:31:08,760 --> 03:31:13,000
She didn't invest in the dash. Yes. I did invest in the get dash. What are you talking about?

2236
03:31:17,400 --> 03:31:19,400
I can get this again

2237
03:31:25,400 --> 03:31:27,000
I kind of want this again

2238
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:30,840
Kill or be killed because I don't I haven't had anything for my special

2239
03:31:31,880 --> 03:31:33,880
Um, so I can get shmoney

2240
03:31:35,240 --> 03:31:37,240
Or I can get shmoney

2241
03:31:39,080 --> 03:31:41,080
Wait, did I accidentally click the other one?

2242
03:31:47,640 --> 03:31:49,640
Do you want to attack us here for bow? Well too bad I didn't

2243
03:31:53,320 --> 03:31:55,320
Oh, hey

2244
03:31:57,720 --> 03:31:59,720
Yeah

2245
03:31:59,720 --> 03:32:03,240
That's such a sick outfit though. He reminds me of the ghoul

2246
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:08,840
From fall out. Hey, what's that you got some sort of ways for sale? Hey, what's that?

2247
03:32:11,160 --> 03:32:13,160
I don't have any money

2248
03:32:15,800 --> 03:32:17,560
I'll take that

2249
03:32:17,560 --> 03:32:21,080
Frick I do not have enough money to beat megara

2250
03:32:22,680 --> 03:32:24,680
Shit

2252
03:32:34,600 --> 03:32:36,600

Bro

2254
03:32:42,760 --> 03:32:47,640
You are so hot your whip's not been all that persuasive in the past. Do we have a history?

2255
03:32:48,920 --> 03:32:52,520
Brother, excuse me. Maybe persistence will pay off for both of us

2256
03:32:53,240 --> 03:32:55,740
She don't mean it and she she definitely don't mean

2257
03:33:06,760 --> 03:33:08,760
Ow, how'd she hit me with that?

2258
03:33:22,520 --> 03:33:24,520
Oh

2259
03:33:27,320 --> 03:33:30,920
Wait, I forgot to have this. Oh fuck. Oh fuck

2260
03:33:35,480 --> 03:33:37,480
Oh, I just got anxious

2261
03:33:45,640 --> 03:33:47,640
Stop chasing me bitch

2262
03:33:52,760 --> 03:33:54,760
Oh my god

2263
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:03,480

2265
03:34:16,120 --> 03:34:18,120
Wow

03:34:19,880 --> 03:34:21,880
Are you gonna keep going

2267
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:28,840
Whips and change excite me come come come come on. Oh

2268
03:34:32,920 --> 03:34:34,920
Ow

2269
03:34:35,880 --> 03:34:42,840
Oh, I thought I could run out see I that's where I need the extra fucking dash. Uh, so that's why I'm gonna buy next

2270
03:34:45,320 --> 03:34:49,240
I'm actually I think I might she got me. I'm very determined to beat megara

2271
03:34:52,680 --> 03:34:56,120
I don't talk to you you again. Everybody's being such a dick

2272
03:34:59,960 --> 03:35:04,760
Why I can scarce believe my art is everybody just sarcastic

2273
03:35:06,920 --> 03:35:08,920
Anything you say to me you save

2274
03:35:11,880 --> 03:35:17,000
Everybody's just me the fury got you again. She is unstoppable, isn't she one time

2275
03:35:17,160 --> 03:35:20,680
I tried to stop her on the way to have a chat with your dad and she didn't even turn her head

2276
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:25,720
No, actually I'm happy I talked to you that time

2277
03:35:26,840 --> 03:35:28,600
Killies I

2278
03:35:28,600 --> 03:35:32,520
Sometimes I fear that father if he somebody is doing fireworks

2279
03:35:33,240 --> 03:35:36,840
Your father's still getting caught up with work that I created for him in my mortal days

2280
03:35:37,320 --> 03:35:42,200
Or it's the ops. I'm sorry. There's nothing he can take from me. We have a mutual arrangement. He and I

2281
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:45,640
Oh, yeah, we're we're gonna beat make the stream. I'm determined. You're right

2282
03:35:47,320 --> 03:35:49,320
I'm very determined

2283
03:35:49,560 --> 03:35:51,560
Oh wait, I want to talk to her

2284
03:35:52,680 --> 03:35:54,680
I

2285
03:35:56,200 --> 03:36:01,480
I just wanted to apologize because I think maybe I didn't act very appropriately last time you spoke to

2286
03:36:02,040 --> 03:36:04,040
Deucer, please. There's no need to apologize

2287
03:36:05,080 --> 03:36:07,080
I can't wait to use your head as an ono

2288
03:36:11,400 --> 03:36:13,400
You really needed

2289
03:36:13,480 --> 03:36:15,480
Thank you. Thanks so much

2290
03:36:19,160 --> 03:36:21,160
Tee hee hee she's so cute

2291
03:36:23,480 --> 03:36:25,480
Me me me me me

2292
03:36:30,200 --> 03:36:36,440
Hi pretty lady your hair is the night and I think that's like my favorite part is you have the night sky in your hair

2293
03:36:37,160 --> 03:36:41,800
That's so cool. I'll see you. I wish I could do that, but it wouldn't make sense because I'm a bunny

2294
03:36:42,040 --> 03:36:44,040
I don't think there'd be bunnies in my hair

2295
03:36:44,680 --> 03:36:47,960
Leave her alone. What do you mean? She's I love her

2296
03:36:49,240 --> 03:36:51,240
I love Deucer

2297
03:36:53,480 --> 03:36:56,840
Can't afford that. I didn't mean to click that. I'm going to click that. Um

2298
03:37:08,680 --> 03:37:12,120
I can I can boost this again feeling good. Okay

2299
03:37:14,360 --> 03:37:16,360
Go lie down

2300
03:37:17,160 --> 03:37:19,160
The hell

2301
03:37:19,240 --> 03:37:23,720
It is the dead of night or the approximation of my sleepwalking

2302
03:37:24,920 --> 03:37:31,400
Prince of the underworld Zagreus rises from a fitful slumber with much mischief on his mind

2303
03:37:33,240 --> 03:37:37,720
Mischief me I was just going to have a little look through father's stuff. Damn, okay

2304
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:41,000
All is quiet at this time

2305
03:37:41,400 --> 03:37:46,840
Ever dreaming hypnos put a spell upon the house as willful Zagreus had asked of him

2306
03:37:47,800 --> 03:37:54,360
All are fast asleep say for the prince. Excuse me, but why did I wake up exactly lower your voice old man?

2307
03:37:54,440 --> 03:37:56,440
I'm trying to be sneaky here

2308
03:38:00,200 --> 03:38:03,480
He ventures toward the stately throne of his lord father

2309
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:06,360
Half expecting to be caught

2310
03:38:06,760 --> 03:38:09,240
But he'll expecting what he is about to find

2311
03:38:11,480 --> 03:38:13,480
I said shut up old man

2312
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:19,960
Daddy's gone. He does not know exactly what he seeks

2313
03:38:20,840 --> 03:38:23,880
He only knows that something always has fell to off to him

2314
03:38:24,600 --> 03:38:26,600
But he does not belong

2315
03:38:26,600 --> 03:38:32,120
Oh, it's a flashback. Oh lord ades never would indulge such questions

2316
03:38:33,160 --> 03:38:36,440
So prince who are my parents? Who's my mom?

2317
03:38:39,080 --> 03:38:42,120
I'm not listening. Tell me about my mother

2318
03:38:42,520 --> 03:38:47,560
The rifles through his lord father's possessions. There is not much of any import there

2319
03:38:48,360 --> 03:38:50,600
ledgers and administrative department work

2320
03:38:52,760 --> 03:38:58,040
Okay, maybe not because I'm suddenly getting tired reference to his son. I will try

2321
03:39:00,920 --> 03:39:03,480
With core knocked by my side, I can do anything

2322
03:39:04,440 --> 03:39:06,120
but then

2323
03:39:06,120 --> 03:39:08,120
There is the note

2324
03:39:08,360 --> 03:39:13,880
Written finally in a hand and voice the likes of which my mom is a Persephone

2325
03:39:15,160 --> 03:39:16,600
Hades

2326
03:39:16,600 --> 03:39:19,000
I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place

2327
03:39:19,880 --> 03:39:22,040
So I'm leaving even if it kills me

2328
03:39:23,240 --> 03:39:25,240
I won't be returning to olympus

2329
03:39:25,640 --> 03:39:27,560
If there is a place where I belong in this world

2330
03:39:28,200 --> 03:39:30,600
It must be so my mom abandoned me great

2331
03:39:31,640 --> 03:39:33,640
Perhaps it's like I should love some meat

2332
03:39:35,240 --> 03:39:37,240
Take care of Cerberus

2333
03:39:37,240 --> 03:39:39,080
I shall miss him

2334
03:39:39,080 --> 03:39:41,080
Persephone

2335
03:39:41,560 --> 03:39:42,680
Mom

2336
03:39:42,680 --> 03:39:44,680
The prince of the underworld Zagreus

2337
03:39:45,160 --> 03:39:47,640
Absorbed the contents of this hidden letter

2338
03:39:48,360 --> 03:39:52,280
Written in his mother's hand. Hey, how does he know it was his mom?

2339
03:39:54,120 --> 03:39:56,120
My mother's hand. Wait what?

2340
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:59,080
You're saying this Persephone that she's my

2341
03:39:59,800 --> 03:40:01,800
The narrator spoiled it

2342
03:40:02,200 --> 03:40:04,200
But father always said that nix was

2343
03:40:05,160 --> 03:40:07,160
That liar

2344
03:40:07,320 --> 03:40:11,000
He lied to you wait. He lied instead that my grandmother was my mom

2345
03:40:11,720 --> 03:40:15,800
That was that's kind of weird. That means that Hades would have fucked his dad

2346
03:40:17,320 --> 03:40:18,760
I mean

2347
03:40:18,760 --> 03:40:20,200
His mom

2348
03:40:20,200 --> 03:40:23,240
Wait, no Hades is a son of yeah, nix and uh

2349
03:40:25,640 --> 03:40:27,640
That titan right? I don't know

2350
03:40:28,120 --> 03:40:30,120
Thos did the prince

2351
03:40:30,120 --> 03:40:37,880
Inevitably the world kept truth about his lineage entirely by chance. Nice job narrator slash Homer

2352
03:40:44,520 --> 03:40:50,920
I like how I'm like 3d, but not it's very interesting the one time queen of all the underworld

2353
03:40:51,560 --> 03:40:53,960
Where had she gone and why?

2354
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:58,040
Engulfed by newfound questions and this rage

2355
03:40:58,840 --> 03:41:00,840
Leave me alone

2356
03:41:05,800 --> 03:41:07,800
Well, I still

2357
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:10,840
I hope not. I hope he didn't

2358
03:41:15,800 --> 03:41:18,600
Nix you why

2359
03:41:20,680 --> 03:41:22,680
How could you you

2360
03:41:23,720 --> 03:41:26,360
You're nix you're not my mother

2361
03:41:27,240 --> 03:41:33,720
All this time you and my father you you lied to me. Ow is some elbow. Oh my dear child

2362
03:41:34,600 --> 03:41:37,560
Oh, so now you know new art. So now you know

2363
03:41:38,440 --> 03:41:42,120
But only half the truth. I can explain the rest so

2364
03:41:43,160 --> 03:41:45,160
please

2365
03:41:45,160 --> 03:41:47,160
I love the half moon

2366
03:41:47,400 --> 03:41:50,440
Love the starlight in her hair. She's literally my favorite design

2367
03:41:51,160 --> 03:41:53,160
Oh

2368
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:58,600
My arm mother I wonder do you hear that my arm fucking popping

2369
03:42:00,360 --> 03:42:07,240
Yeah, why is there no mention? She's look after the dog. Fuck my son. Don't fuck my son like that, but like fm

2370
03:42:10,040 --> 03:42:12,040
I don't know what I'm saying

2371
03:42:12,840 --> 03:42:14,840
Hey pal

2372
03:42:15,240 --> 03:42:17,240
Nothing is off limits for the greek

2373
03:42:17,800 --> 03:42:27,800
Oh, I can lock this though. Let's see. What's in here for alpha the eternal spear. Oh my pursuit. Oh shit

2374
03:42:31,080 --> 03:42:33,080
Holds then release

2375
03:42:36,680 --> 03:42:38,680
Yo

2376
03:42:39,320 --> 03:42:41,320
Yeah, that was nothing

2377
03:42:45,480 --> 03:42:48,200
Sorry, I'm very excited phrasing

2378
03:42:49,800 --> 03:42:54,680
They cook every day. I believe the minds of this came out me with this myth. Oh someone tell them the fuck

2379
03:43:03,320 --> 03:43:06,200
I never used desk dash attacks. I should probably do that

2380
03:43:06,760 --> 03:43:10,440
I said, I think it's the awkwardness of the bindings

2381
03:43:21,640 --> 03:43:25,640
Damn that is actually sick

2382
03:43:25,640 --> 03:43:27,640
You caught that a kid

2383
03:43:35,320 --> 03:43:37,320
Oh, there's a max cool

2384
03:43:39,160 --> 03:43:41,160
All right

2385
03:43:42,760 --> 03:43:45,560
Interesante by everyone

2386
03:43:48,680 --> 03:43:53,960
Family oh death is your only family death and I

2387
03:43:54,280 --> 03:43:55,480
I

2388
03:43:55,480 --> 03:43:57,480
Best to get accustomed to the both of us

2389
03:43:58,280 --> 03:44:03,000
Like how his laurels are on fire just like mine. I didn't notice that before not on your life

2390
03:44:05,320 --> 03:44:09,640
Poseidon I can give you a gift. I've been waiting for this my entire life

2391
03:44:10,360 --> 03:44:16,440
Uncle Poseidon, it's been excellent to know you sir. So please this is for you. I think this might be the run boys

2392
03:44:16,440 --> 03:44:18,440
Oh

2393
03:44:22,200 --> 03:44:24,440
Oh, I am positively moved

2394
03:44:27,800 --> 03:44:29,320
Oh my god, my I

2395
03:44:29,320 --> 03:44:32,920
Dispenser is going off and scared me sound like someone knocking on my door

2396
03:44:33,640 --> 03:44:36,680
I thank you, uncle. You got a conch shell

2397
03:44:41,000 --> 03:44:44,680
If you your cruel father Hades, he's my elder brother, you know that

2398
03:44:45,400 --> 03:44:47,400
Yeah, we talked about this last time

2399
03:44:48,760 --> 03:44:50,760
Tidal dash, baby

2400
03:44:51,800 --> 03:44:53,800
Tidal dash

2401
03:44:56,920 --> 03:44:58,920
Wait, what's flood shot though

2402
03:45:01,800 --> 03:45:06,600
You can't tell but I'm biting my lip and like the f-boy way

2403
03:45:11,480 --> 03:45:13,480
Uh, okay

2404
03:45:14,680 --> 03:45:18,360
Damn if I could get this in the flood shot, that'd be so good

2405
03:45:24,360 --> 03:45:26,360
Hmm

2406
03:45:36,520 --> 03:45:40,520
Choice, yeah, emoji is perfect. That's exactly what I was doing

2407
03:45:41,480 --> 03:45:44,680
Mmm, I need a lip bite toggle

2408
03:45:47,400 --> 03:45:49,400
I know

2409
03:45:53,640 --> 03:45:55,640
I don't even smile when I'm like

2410
03:45:58,360 --> 03:46:00,600
When I bite my lip, it's just my mouth is closed

2411
03:46:04,440 --> 03:46:06,440
Oh, it's kind of doing it now

2412
03:46:11,480 --> 03:46:14,760
I'm wiggling my eyebrows. I can't tell if you can tell

2413
03:46:25,240 --> 03:46:29,320
It's actually really hard you have to be like do you very exaggerated with your eyebrows

2414
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:33,240
All right. Well, we're gonna stick with the true and tried

2415
03:46:34,840 --> 03:46:39,960
Tidal dash, baby. Oh wait, I'm doing this like it's a fucking

2416
03:46:40,760 --> 03:46:47,400
Okay, this might not be the run because I don't have the bow, but it's fine

2417
03:46:50,920 --> 03:46:52,920
Because I already fucked it up

2418
03:46:56,120 --> 03:46:58,120
What the hell oh

2419
03:47:01,400 --> 03:47:03,400
Interesting uh

2420
03:47:04,200 --> 03:47:06,200
Uh

2421
03:47:07,800 --> 03:47:09,800
Dash dash dash

2422
03:47:19,160 --> 03:47:21,160
Oh

2423
03:47:22,360 --> 03:47:27,720
Poseidon again. Oh god, here we go. I was so hoping we get oh wait, there's a portal fuck

2424
03:47:29,560 --> 03:47:31,560
I'll never know

2425
03:47:32,360 --> 03:47:34,360
I'm used to the oh

2426
03:47:38,040 --> 03:47:40,040
If I can get my special to be

2427
03:47:45,960 --> 03:47:50,120
A little bit more powerful this might be helpful

2428
03:47:55,240 --> 03:47:57,640
Oh because I get like locked in the animation

2429
03:48:01,560 --> 03:48:03,560
So

2430
03:48:05,240 --> 03:48:08,200
Don't decide it from Olympus. I accept this message

2431
03:48:10,840 --> 03:48:14,680
Your boons do you have more damage and siphon?

2432
03:48:15,880 --> 03:48:21,480
Oh, that's literally what I asked for I asked for more damage for my special and I'm getting it

2433
03:48:32,440 --> 03:48:38,760
The dash strike for this weapon is the main draw bows kind of whack anyways, I like the bow shut up

2434
03:48:39,240 --> 03:48:43,640
Cast is a lot harder use consistently with you needing to run around pick them back up dash is more consistent

2435
03:48:43,640 --> 03:48:46,040
Yeah, I like it. That's a good point. Um

2436
03:48:49,160 --> 03:48:52,360
I just need to get used to the fucking spear

2437
03:48:56,280 --> 03:48:58,280
Can I charge it

2438
03:49:01,640 --> 03:49:03,640
Hello

2439
03:49:08,200 --> 03:49:10,200
Get dead

2440
03:49:15,480 --> 03:49:19,720
I like how I essentially have fucking Poseidon's tried it

2441
03:49:31,960 --> 03:49:33,960
Oh

2442
03:49:36,840 --> 03:49:44,600
This also goes through multiple enemies, so I like that a lot. It's gonna knock something back home. Oh, baby

2443
03:49:51,400 --> 03:49:55,000
Daedalus hammer. Hello. What the fuck I'm stuck on these spots

2444
03:49:55,640 --> 03:50:01,480
Oh, I need to do that. I will keep you at arm's length

2445
03:50:06,760 --> 03:50:08,760
Where oh

2446
03:50:12,760 --> 03:50:14,760
Oh, yeah, I like this

2447
03:50:25,880 --> 03:50:29,000
I can just dash around these bitches

2448
03:50:38,120 --> 03:50:40,120
I like it now to fix up this spear

2449
03:50:45,800 --> 03:50:47,800
I can get this triple jab

2450
03:50:48,520 --> 03:50:50,520
I

2451
03:50:53,000 --> 03:50:55,400
Have I don't really use dash a dash strike a lot

2452
03:51:05,480 --> 03:51:11,640
I like this I like the triple the spread because it helps me focus on more than one enemy at once

2453
03:51:18,120 --> 03:51:21,400
I don't want to jinx the run, but I'm feeling good

2454
03:51:40,040 --> 03:51:42,840
Oh fuck I didn't think he was gonna

2455
03:51:48,200 --> 03:51:54,120
How does he reach me? I didn't think you would have that much fucking. Oh my fucking god

2456
03:51:58,920 --> 03:52:01,160
I need to get money so I can buy health that's for sure

2457
03:52:05,800 --> 03:52:07,800
This hard place to dodge

2458
03:52:17,800 --> 03:52:19,800
I

2459
03:52:20,200 --> 03:52:24,440
Should be useful. Oh, thank god give me this fucking health. I swear to god

2460
03:52:28,920 --> 03:52:31,960
Mmm fucking up. I'm fucking up

2461
03:52:40,200 --> 03:52:42,200
Come on

2462
03:52:42,200 --> 03:52:44,200
Oh

2463
03:52:57,720 --> 03:52:59,720
My nose is a G

2464
03:53:12,200 --> 03:53:14,200
Oh

2465
03:53:18,840 --> 03:53:22,120
Aphrodite sweetheart, what do you have for me?

2466
03:53:32,280 --> 03:53:35,880
I need a special from her that's all I I just needed something I just need a special

2467
03:53:42,200 --> 03:53:44,200
I

2468
03:53:49,640 --> 03:53:51,640
Have a backstab that's good

2469
03:54:02,200 --> 03:54:04,280
I just like doing this the specials great

2470
03:54:09,080 --> 03:54:11,080
Oh fuck yeah

2471
03:54:12,760 --> 03:54:18,520
Yeah, you've had a brush with mega the fury haven't you? Oh, I know a thing or two about that one

2472
03:54:19,160 --> 03:54:22,120
Yeah, we Olympians no longer mean we Olympians

2473
03:54:23,160 --> 03:54:25,160
You're the only exception

2474
03:54:25,960 --> 03:54:30,360
She's a very interesting place. Um, so I can get a call

2475
03:54:37,240 --> 03:54:39,320
That would be helpful against mega

2476
03:54:42,360 --> 03:54:44,360
Oh

2477
03:54:48,440 --> 03:54:51,960
It's only five seconds, but it might be helpful

2478
03:55:05,560 --> 03:55:07,560
Oh, let's talk to her again. Hello

2479
03:55:07,560 --> 03:55:09,560

Oh

2483
03:56:24,920 --> 03:56:26,920
In the name of Hades

2484
03:56:37,560 --> 03:56:39,560
I

2485
03:56:47,080 --> 03:56:49,080
Think I just need some

2486
03:56:59,080 --> 03:57:01,080
I need some help

2487
03:57:08,280 --> 03:57:10,280
Great

2488
03:57:13,240 --> 03:57:15,240
All right time to dash for 45 seconds

2489
03:57:20,840 --> 03:57:22,840
Oh no

2490
03:57:25,720 --> 03:57:27,720
All right, I'm pulling all my headphones. Oh

2491
03:57:37,560 --> 03:57:39,560
Oh

2492
03:57:50,120 --> 03:57:52,120
My god

2493
03:58:03,640 --> 03:58:05,640
I can't believe I read into that

2494
03:58:07,960 --> 03:58:09,960
I

2495
03:58:19,720 --> 03:58:21,720
Have a one health

2496
03:58:30,440 --> 03:58:32,600
Raina don't you on my headphones. I swear to god

2497
03:58:34,120 --> 03:58:36,120
I don't trust you. I I I'm sorry

2498
03:58:36,360 --> 03:58:38,360
And I have to

2499
03:58:44,440 --> 03:58:46,440
She like hopped up on my desk

2500
03:58:48,200 --> 03:58:50,680
I wish there was gonna be health in the shop, but there wasn't

2501
03:58:53,960 --> 03:58:55,960
Oh, man

2502
03:58:55,960 --> 03:58:57,960
I

2503
03:59:06,760 --> 03:59:11,880
Yeah, I just oh fuck I forgot I had death to fight it

2504
03:59:14,280 --> 03:59:16,280
Oh, I hate these guys

2505
03:59:25,960 --> 03:59:27,960
Oh

2506
03:59:43,800 --> 03:59:46,840
I don't know why he's going over there, but go off son

2507
03:59:55,960 --> 03:59:57,960
Oh

2508
04:00:09,720 --> 04:00:11,720
Don't come back

2509
04:00:21,000 --> 04:00:23,000
Still not enough to beat Megara

2510
04:00:26,040 --> 04:00:28,040
What

2511
04:00:29,640 --> 04:00:31,640
No, I need the health I need the health

2512
04:00:40,840 --> 04:00:42,840
What the frick

2513
04:00:46,120 --> 04:00:49,720
What is this? Oh god

2514
04:00:49,720 --> 04:00:57,320
Why did that hurt me I was dashing

2515
04:01:13,800 --> 04:01:15,800
Can't even get to these fucking guys

2516
04:01:19,880 --> 04:01:21,880
Is he dead? Okay, yes

2517
04:01:31,160 --> 04:01:33,160
Oh, come on

2518
04:01:33,160 --> 04:01:35,160
Oh

2519
04:01:47,720 --> 04:01:49,720
That's a relief

2520
04:01:55,720 --> 04:02:01,160
I think his dash means have to I missed the health on the floor fuck me bro. I didn't know that

2521
04:02:02,120 --> 04:02:04,120
God's grant me strength

2522
04:02:13,880 --> 04:02:17,880
Okay, I'm shopping my senses. Okay. Um

2523
04:02:21,720 --> 04:02:23,720
It is what it is

2524
04:02:25,800 --> 04:02:27,800
Oh, hello

2525
04:02:28,680 --> 04:02:34,840
And there you are again, I love her voice so much let you run a muck in his domain like this

2526
04:02:37,320 --> 04:02:40,840
Uh, I wasn't paying attention. I was more focused on living

2527
04:02:58,280 --> 04:03:00,280
Oh

2528
04:03:10,200 --> 04:03:13,560
What the fuck why was it aiming the wrong way? Oh my god

2529
04:03:13,560 --> 04:03:15,560
Oh

2530
04:03:25,160 --> 04:03:27,160
I don't use my fucking

2531
04:03:43,560 --> 04:03:45,560
Oh

2532
04:04:13,560 --> 04:04:15,560
Oh

2533
04:04:33,240 --> 04:04:37,640
That hurts that hurts that hurts so bad

2534
04:04:38,520 --> 04:04:46,440
Those fucking spikes I get so caught up in what looking at where she is and I'm not looking where I'm going

2535
04:04:51,240 --> 04:04:55,640
The sealed weapons by your chambers your father won't observe their absence. I don't think

2536
04:04:56,520 --> 04:04:59,640
They remind him power that once sealed away the Titans

2537
04:05:02,760 --> 04:05:04,760
I do like the sphere a lot though

2538
04:05:05,720 --> 04:05:12,360
The heck is this you're late with your report hypnos again. Oh, I think that's look like that

2539
04:05:12,920 --> 04:05:18,040
The dead of course can wait. Oh, well, let's see. I woke up. I don't know what time it was and

2540
04:05:18,200 --> 04:05:23,640
He's like floating that every shade had been accounted for just like I always do except I couldn't find my list at first

2541
04:05:23,640 --> 04:05:28,520

04:05:30,760 --> 04:05:32,760
Third time's the charm. I hope

2544
04:05:33,720 --> 04:05:38,360

Conform combos and can be chained with dash

2551
04:06:12,280 --> 04:06:14,760
I knew that I knew I could do that

2552
04:06:15,640 --> 04:06:18,520
Because I've I noticed that I did it accidentally a few times

2553
04:06:19,160 --> 04:06:21,160
um

2554
04:06:21,720 --> 04:06:24,520

2707
04:24:28,920 --> 04:24:30,920
Don't need HP if you don't get hit

2708
04:24:33,320 --> 04:24:35,320

2709
04:24:42,200 --> 04:24:44,200

I

2714
04:25:19,320 --> 04:25:21,320
Didn't mean to press that

2715
04:25:25,320 --> 04:25:27,320
Up to seven foes

2716
04:25:33,000 --> 04:25:35,000

2717
04:25:35,480 --> 04:25:39,880
Up to seven foes. Are you kidding me? It just bounces between them

2718
04:25:42,040 --> 04:25:44,040

04:27:28,360 --> 04:27:30,360

2739
04:28:45,560 --> 04:28:50,440

If I had this and the thing that makes enemies drop health from the store I would have been unstoppable

2749
04:29:53,400 --> 04:29:56,120
The range of noises she reaches me

2750
04:30:00,040 --> 04:30:02,040

Oh, stop

2762
04:32:52,680 --> 04:32:54,680

04:33:04,600 --> 04:33:06,600
I love her darkness

2764
04:33:10,680 --> 04:33:12,680
No effect

2765
04:33:22,440 --> 04:33:24,440
Oh

2766
04:33:36,760 --> 04:33:38,760

2767
04:33:41,080 --> 04:33:43,080

2768
04:33:45,400 --> 04:33:47,400
Damn you Meg

2769
04:33:52,440 --> 04:33:54,440

I'm so close

2771
04:34:19,880 --> 04:34:21,880
I'm so sad

2772
04:34:22,440 --> 04:34:24,440
I

2773
04:34:26,120 --> 04:34:35,000
Need the moment that I saw her aoe attack and I got stuck in the corner that it was just not going to be a good time

2774
04:34:46,120 --> 04:34:48,120
No, I should have beaten her

2775
04:34:48,680 --> 04:34:55,960
You never learn I don't want to talk to anybody. I just I don't find giving shit

2776
04:34:58,200 --> 04:35:01,880
The fates are betting print. Oh no, not this determinism thing again

2777
04:35:01,880 --> 04:35:03,880
I

2778
04:35:15,720 --> 04:35:19,560
Mad I'm mad. Hey

2779
04:35:22,440 --> 04:35:25,400

2780
04:35:31,880 --> 04:35:33,880
I

2781
04:35:48,280 --> 04:35:50,280
I'm ready

2782
04:35:55,480 --> 04:35:57,480
Hello there Dionysus

2783
04:35:57,800 --> 04:35:59,800
Hmm

2784
04:36:10,920 --> 04:36:12,920
Thank you Dionysus mate

2785
04:36:17,880 --> 04:36:19,880
Sometimes I have to wonder

2786
04:36:20,200 --> 04:36:22,200
I

2787
04:36:26,360 --> 04:36:28,360
Time to feast

2788
04:36:41,880 --> 04:36:43,880
May I help you

2789
04:36:49,880 --> 04:36:51,880
I

2790
04:36:59,560 --> 04:37:01,560
Got it

2791
04:37:12,120 --> 04:37:14,120
What else

2792
04:37:20,120 --> 04:37:22,120
I

2793
04:37:33,000 --> 04:37:35,000
Fuck well miss a couple coins

2794
04:37:49,880 --> 04:37:51,880
I

2795
04:38:20,840 --> 04:38:22,840
I

2796
04:38:27,080 --> 04:38:32,520
So all I need to do is sacrifice some of my life essence to go in here. Sorry just associated for a second

2797
04:38:36,200 --> 04:38:38,200
Who or what is that?

2798
04:38:38,840 --> 04:38:42,760
Is this chronos? This is not someone I recognize

2799
04:38:43,560 --> 04:38:45,560
So in the name of Hades

2800
04:38:46,200 --> 04:38:48,200
Hello, may I ask who's calling?

2801
04:38:50,600 --> 04:38:52,600
You

2802
04:38:56,840 --> 04:39:00,440
That is the coolest fucking design I've ever seen in my life, holy shit

2803
04:39:04,920 --> 04:39:10,680
I the artist is such a great job, holy crap the weird ethereal

2804
04:39:11,560 --> 04:39:14,120
The faces the eyes very

2805
04:39:15,400 --> 04:39:17,400
Wow

2806
04:39:19,880 --> 04:39:21,880
Oh, it's chaos

2807
04:39:37,400 --> 04:39:39,900
Like how the world is in their hand

2808
04:39:50,040 --> 04:39:57,080
Each time I attack get hit for five

2809
04:39:59,560 --> 04:40:03,160
That doesn't really make so I just want to be able to use my attack

2810
04:40:10,920 --> 04:40:18,600
I'll have to withstand the whims of chaos to extract the benefit within the underworld's quietest mode and best take all the evidence I find

2811
04:40:20,760 --> 04:40:22,760
I just think

2812
04:40:36,680 --> 04:40:38,680
Who's next

2813
04:40:39,400 --> 04:40:41,400
I

2814
04:40:45,560 --> 04:40:50,840
Surprised I didn't stun lock them like before only stuns lock them when they don't have their armor

2815
04:41:03,960 --> 04:41:05,960
Oh

2816
04:41:08,680 --> 04:41:11,640
Oh

2817
04:41:39,000 --> 04:41:41,000
Oh

2818
04:41:41,320 --> 04:41:43,320
Oh

2819
04:41:43,320 --> 04:41:45,320
Oh

2820
04:42:07,800 --> 04:42:12,440
I dashed how would I I guess I'm not impervious

2821
04:42:14,200 --> 04:42:16,200
You found me out of us

2822
04:42:18,760 --> 04:42:20,920
Puri down and talk to us has been a real problem

2823
04:42:33,560 --> 04:42:35,560
Let's hunt some dead

2824
04:42:43,320 --> 04:42:45,640
Oh

2825
04:43:13,320 --> 04:43:15,640
Oh

2826
04:43:43,320 --> 04:43:45,320
Oh

2827
04:43:48,280 --> 04:43:50,280
That's something

2828
04:43:55,480 --> 04:43:57,880
I'd rather if it was hell I'd do it

2829
04:44:02,920 --> 04:44:09,320
I need better boons, but I don't feel like dealing with the frickin whatever's

2830
04:44:09,320 --> 04:44:11,320
I

2831
04:44:12,920 --> 04:44:14,920
Think I hear the river

2832
04:44:19,080 --> 04:44:21,080
Much better

2833
04:44:23,880 --> 04:44:28,200
Here on you've been such a reassuring sight I thought I'd offer you a token of my gratitude

2834
04:44:31,880 --> 04:44:33,880
Wait, you don't have to give me something in return

2835
04:44:33,880 --> 04:44:38,440
I don't know what to say mate

2836
04:44:43,400 --> 04:44:45,400
Find a to you as well there mate

2837
04:44:48,440 --> 04:44:54,120
The infernal wares of the stygian botan carrom lies that would be me

2838
04:45:03,880 --> 04:45:05,880
Oh

2839
04:45:33,880 --> 04:45:35,880
Oh

2840
04:46:01,560 --> 04:46:03,560
Can I please get some health

2841
04:46:04,040 --> 04:46:09,960
And I please get some health lost souls with nowhere left to turn congregate in deepest to tartarus

2842
04:46:10,520 --> 04:46:13,720
Where they fuse together with the earth itself into odious

2843
04:46:13,880 --> 04:46:15,880
Oh sharon is just like

2844
04:46:19,240 --> 04:46:21,240
They basically turn into big crystals

2845
04:46:33,880 --> 04:46:35,880
So

2846
04:46:49,160 --> 04:46:51,160
I had this with the seven

2847
04:46:56,600 --> 04:46:59,000
Now would be perfect my ears itchy

2848
04:47:01,160 --> 04:47:03,160
Oh my god itchy

2849
04:47:04,600 --> 04:47:06,600
Oh

2850
04:47:20,040 --> 04:47:22,040
How am I still alive

2851
04:47:34,840 --> 04:47:36,840
Oh

2852
04:47:51,480 --> 04:47:53,480
Okay, I get datalus

2853
04:47:56,040 --> 04:47:58,360
It's okay. That's all I want. I want that anyways

2854
04:47:59,480 --> 04:48:02,520
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see

2855
04:48:04,840 --> 04:48:06,840
Oh

2856
04:48:22,680 --> 04:48:24,680
More coming

2857
04:48:33,880 --> 04:48:35,880
Oh

2858
04:49:04,120 --> 04:49:06,120
I

2859
04:49:11,640 --> 04:49:17,000
Haven't been using my massive spin because it just walks me in an animation that slows me down

2860
04:49:22,120 --> 04:49:24,840
This will make me have three critical hits so this will be pretty good

2861
04:49:25,640 --> 04:49:27,640
I

2862
04:49:29,320 --> 04:49:36,200
I'm gonna see dianis again. I haven't been using my thing. I totally forgot that I had that

2863
04:49:38,920 --> 04:49:44,280
I'll be honest with you. What is the fucking music? I'll talk to dianis this again

2864
04:49:55,080 --> 04:49:57,080
I

2865
04:49:59,880 --> 04:50:04,600
I'm kind of fun. I need a dash. I'm gonna get the dash

2866
04:50:07,640 --> 04:50:10,760
Because I'm about to go fighter so it's just I need the dash

2867
04:50:16,920 --> 04:50:19,400
All right, hello, I'm sorry I'm gonna be locked in

2868
04:50:19,400 --> 04:50:21,400
Oh

04:52:41,160 --> 04:52:43,160
Nick's I have to ask you something

2887
04:52:43,960 --> 04:52:47,160
Your mother yet lives there can be no other explanation

2888
04:52:48,200 --> 04:52:50,520
For it. I think I turned out okay

2889
04:53:03,240 --> 04:53:05,240
Um, thanks

2890
04:53:05,960 --> 04:53:11,320
I don't blame the boons because I could have won with the boons I had

2891
04:53:15,720 --> 04:53:17,720
Show me something new

2892
04:53:26,520 --> 04:53:29,160
Nice felt that I think

2893
04:53:29,960 --> 04:53:37,480
It's like any one of the runs I could I should have beat her I should have beat her

2894
04:53:39,000 --> 04:53:41,640
What's this one do I'm keeping the lucky tooth. I think

2895
04:53:42,600 --> 04:53:44,840
It's just Dionysus and I just get boons

2896
04:53:45,640 --> 04:53:47,640
although I like

2897
04:53:47,800 --> 04:53:49,800
Sisyphus is good

2898
04:53:49,800 --> 04:53:54,200
To be honest when you get like when you feel like you're gonna have a shit run. That's what it's good for

2899
04:54:00,120 --> 04:54:03,080
I need to lean back. Oh my fucking legs

2900
04:54:05,880 --> 04:54:10,200
operations increased I don't really know what that means but sure go off

2901
04:54:13,800 --> 04:54:18,600
You're really good. No, I don't think I am though. Like I know I can be fucking better than that. It's pissing me off

2902
04:54:19,720 --> 04:54:24,680
I know I can be better. What the hell? I didn't mean to press that. I know I can be better. I'm gonna press those

2903
04:54:25,320 --> 04:54:27,320
I

2904
04:54:27,640 --> 04:54:32,280
What's up handsome, let me give you a piece of advice for you. You're gonna cross a guy like me out there

2905
04:54:32,280 --> 04:54:37,320
You just give him a good stab right in the back without a second the most interesting character

2906
04:54:37,320 --> 04:54:39,320
I

2907
04:54:54,040 --> 04:54:58,200
Just I wish I was one of those people that was just cracked at any game they touched. I know I know people like that

2908
04:55:05,240 --> 04:55:07,240
My weapons hidden talents

2909
04:55:08,120 --> 04:55:10,120
Oh

2910
04:55:13,080 --> 04:55:16,120
Oh, but that special is good

2911
04:55:19,960 --> 04:55:25,480
I'm gonna go with this though just change score again because it is just really nice to have

2912
04:55:25,640 --> 04:55:27,640
Oh

2913
04:55:35,720 --> 04:55:41,000
Each time the prince delves back into the underworld it's ever shifting chambers real up

2914
04:55:44,840 --> 04:55:47,480
Like I like the game a lot. I'm just mad that I'm shit at it

2915
04:55:56,440 --> 04:55:58,440
Oh

2916
04:56:00,040 --> 04:56:03,640
Why I'm sorry you're coming for me. I didn't lock on for some reason

2917
04:56:26,440 --> 04:56:28,440
Oh

2918
04:56:32,680 --> 04:56:36,040
It is simpler you have to really just like dumb it down in your head

2919
04:56:47,240 --> 04:56:49,240
I like how for airy sound it's like

2920
04:56:56,120 --> 04:56:58,120
I

2921
04:56:59,640 --> 04:57:03,800
Yeah, I'm in that doom. That'll be fucking perfect for that. All right

2922
04:57:06,680 --> 04:57:08,680
I don't know what doom means, but I like it

2923
04:57:10,520 --> 04:57:13,160
I've already like I've seen myself improve with the game. That's for sure

2924
04:57:17,720 --> 04:57:19,720
I don't think I need to go to

2925
04:57:26,200 --> 04:57:28,200
Oh

2926
04:57:31,080 --> 04:57:34,840
Oh my god, see that's what I mean. I hope I want to get a fetus thing

2927
04:57:39,560 --> 04:57:41,960
I didn't even get to this dude. Come here you fucking bitch

2928
04:57:45,720 --> 04:57:47,880
Why is it not properly locking on?

2929
04:57:52,200 --> 04:57:54,200
Come here you fucker

2930
04:57:55,480 --> 04:57:57,480
I

2931
04:58:06,360 --> 04:58:10,680
Don't know how you rank up a lucky tooth. I could see chaos, but I don't feel like it

2932
04:58:10,680 --> 04:58:13,960
I'm gonna see Poseidon. Hopefully he can get me the dash

2933
04:58:25,480 --> 04:58:27,480
I

2934
04:58:45,720 --> 04:58:50,120
My ex-girlfriend she just won't let me fucking leave bro. It's just fucking sucks dude

2935
04:58:55,480 --> 04:58:57,480
I

2936
04:59:00,200 --> 04:59:02,200
See God's might

2937
04:59:07,640 --> 04:59:09,640
Yeah, I got a good dash

2938
04:59:12,680 --> 04:59:17,400
Dash I'm coming in fast first place you're coming in fucking hell, bro

2939
04:59:17,800 --> 04:59:19,800
Oh

2940
04:59:22,600 --> 04:59:29,080
I do really like I'm happy I picked it. Oh, okay. We're gonna do another Poseidon. I mean areas

2941
04:59:40,920 --> 04:59:42,920
This I would have broken an armor

2942
04:59:48,360 --> 04:59:50,360
I had

2943
04:59:59,560 --> 05:00:02,200
Oh, why do I keep fucking running into those stupid bombs?

2944
05:00:17,720 --> 05:00:21,160
Um, every word I was saying

2945
05:00:29,480 --> 05:00:33,880
Every word I was gonna say I lost my train of thought doesn't matter

2946
05:00:38,040 --> 05:00:40,040
Oh no

2947
05:00:47,400 --> 05:00:49,400
Oh

2948
05:01:05,320 --> 05:01:09,400
Being a palm fuck it do the trial

2949
05:01:17,400 --> 05:01:19,400
Oh

2950
05:01:26,600 --> 05:01:31,000
That's enough there we are and my keep

2951
05:01:33,880 --> 05:01:35,880
Nope

2952
05:01:42,760 --> 05:01:44,760
I don't reach on that

2953
05:01:47,400 --> 05:01:49,400
I

2954
05:02:10,280 --> 05:02:12,280
Delicious

2955
05:02:18,280 --> 05:02:20,280
Stronger still

2956
05:02:27,240 --> 05:02:29,240
Are we leaving shortly

2957
05:02:47,960 --> 05:02:49,960
Oh

2958
05:03:09,480 --> 05:03:11,480
Where now

2959
05:03:17,640 --> 05:03:19,640
Karen's shop

2960
05:03:21,640 --> 05:03:24,280
I wish I had a little bit more money so I could

2961
05:03:26,280 --> 05:03:28,280
Get something from Aphrodite

2962
05:03:28,280 --> 05:03:30,280
I'm short of coin

2963
05:03:31,480 --> 05:03:36,840
Oh wait, but I got Sisyphus up there. It's fine. I had to ask I'll take this one

2964
05:03:37,240 --> 05:03:39,240
Oh

2965
05:03:43,400 --> 05:03:47,640
Hello your highness hey, is this of us you're actually perfect timing

2966
05:03:48,760 --> 05:03:50,840
Oh, that is quite an undertaking prince

2967
05:03:50,840 --> 05:03:52,840
So

2968
05:04:03,400 --> 05:04:05,880
Then here you go on my authority

2969
05:04:11,640 --> 05:04:13,640
Karen's shop

2970
05:04:14,200 --> 05:04:16,200
What am I supposed to do here?

2971
05:04:16,840 --> 05:04:24,440
Oh, I could have gotten obels and they could have bought shit. Damn. I didn't know who's gonna be next

2972
05:04:28,280 --> 05:04:30,280
Because it'll been great to get another palm

2973
05:04:35,480 --> 05:04:39,080
Buy this just to get the extra point of health

2974
05:04:39,080 --> 05:04:48,360
She's like this is like the fifth time you've been here

2975
05:05:09,320 --> 05:05:11,320
I'll make this quick

2976
05:05:20,600 --> 05:05:22,600
I'll kill you when you stand

2977
05:05:39,080 --> 05:05:41,080
Oh

2978
05:06:09,080 --> 05:06:11,080
Oh

2979
05:06:27,080 --> 05:06:29,080
I'll make you pay

2980
05:06:39,080 --> 05:06:42,040
Oh

2981
05:07:09,080 --> 05:07:11,080
Oh

2982
05:07:39,240 --> 05:07:41,240
Oh

2983
05:07:44,600 --> 05:07:46,600
Let's go

2984
05:07:52,200 --> 05:07:54,200
Killings might know what to do with this

2985
05:07:56,200 --> 05:07:58,200
I just killed somebody

2986
05:08:02,600 --> 05:08:07,720
I was getting pissed I was like dude if I don't beat her this time I'm losing it

2987
05:08:10,040 --> 05:08:12,040
Oh

2988
05:08:16,280 --> 05:08:20,520
Let's fucking go what how did you

2989
05:08:30,440 --> 05:08:32,440
Can wash away my bones

2990
05:08:39,080 --> 05:08:41,080
Okay

2991
05:08:58,360 --> 05:09:00,360
I want to keep playing

2992
05:09:09,720 --> 05:09:11,720
Does it auto save

2993
05:09:18,040 --> 05:09:22,360
Do I keep fighting if I quit

2994
05:09:26,280 --> 05:09:33,480
If I quit does it does it cancel everything I'm done I can save what can I save

2995
05:09:34,440 --> 05:09:36,440
I

2996
05:09:36,760 --> 05:09:38,760
Just don't save

2997
05:09:38,760 --> 05:09:44,360
This is projects progress saved a minute ago. I saved. Okay. I just kind of want to peek ahead though

2998
05:09:46,840 --> 05:09:48,840
No, I'll save it for next time. Okay

2999
05:09:50,040 --> 05:09:53,400
We beat her. I should have beat her sooner. I'm mad at myself for that

3000
05:09:54,680 --> 05:09:56,680
I really like this the sphere

3001
05:09:57,640 --> 05:09:59,640
Um, just a hit give up

3002
05:09:59,800 --> 05:10:01,480
Um

3003
05:10:01,560 --> 05:10:04,040
Is really good. I like the sphere

3004
05:10:06,200 --> 05:10:08,200
And

3005
05:10:10,120 --> 05:10:12,120
No, just

3006
05:10:12,680 --> 05:10:14,680
That's something I could interact with

3007
05:10:15,160 --> 05:10:23,880
None other than those in the trusted inner circle of lord hades are authorized to enter the intricate chambers connecting the vast regions of the underworld

3008
05:10:24,760 --> 05:10:27,480
But the prince decides to barge in anyway

3009
05:10:28,280 --> 05:10:30,280
Hmm

3010
05:10:30,680 --> 05:10:32,680
I barred where I please

3011
05:10:32,680 --> 05:10:34,680
I barred where I please

3012
05:10:36,840 --> 05:10:43,480
So if I died and like if I proceeded is this the continuance of

3013
05:10:51,720 --> 05:10:53,720
Like what I used to get sent all the way back

3014
05:10:53,720 --> 05:10:55,720
Oh

3015
05:10:57,720 --> 05:11:04,120
Please you don't have to placate me. I'm not a child. I wasn't doing good. I could have been better

3016
05:11:04,840 --> 05:11:06,840
um

3017
05:11:08,840 --> 05:11:10,840
Because I want to go forward but I also don't

3018
05:11:12,360 --> 05:11:14,360
Because I'm tired you go to bed

3019
05:11:14,520 --> 05:11:16,840
Uh, I'll leave you here. I'll let my

3020
05:11:17,640 --> 05:11:19,640
It goes to the next realm

3021
05:11:19,640 --> 05:11:21,640
If I die in that realm

3022
05:11:23,800 --> 05:11:26,680
Do I get sent to the hub or do I have to start level one?

3023
05:11:32,280 --> 05:11:35,880
Okay, so if I die in level two

3024
05:11:50,600 --> 05:11:52,600
If you die start back at one, uh

3025
05:11:54,520 --> 05:11:56,520
You

3026
05:12:00,760 --> 05:12:02,760
Then how do I get to the hub from here?

3027
05:12:12,760 --> 05:12:14,760
Does that mean I would have to beat meg again

3028
05:12:24,600 --> 05:12:25,720
I

3029
05:12:25,720 --> 05:12:32,440
Thought the game would be a little bit more forgiving and then let you go on to the next level, but I guess it seems that you

3030
05:12:39,960 --> 05:12:43,240
It's one try or bust so you literally have to almost make a run

3031
05:12:45,240 --> 05:12:47,240
And

3032
05:12:47,240 --> 05:12:55,240
And a single go damn, that's hard. Um

3033
05:13:00,040 --> 05:13:02,520
We're under 30 minutes, okay

3034
05:13:06,280 --> 05:13:08,280
Damn

3035
05:13:12,680 --> 05:13:14,680
Hmm

3036
05:13:17,400 --> 05:13:19,400
Okay

3037
05:13:24,280 --> 05:13:28,920
We also have increasing benefits as you do it true you can become absolutely tapped

3038
05:13:30,840 --> 05:13:32,440
All right

3039
05:13:32,440 --> 05:13:37,880
Good to know you don't go to the hub. That's what the constructions are for to explain the floors variety

3040
05:13:40,680 --> 05:13:42,680
What do you mean the floors variety

3041
05:13:43,400 --> 05:13:44,680
Oh

3042
05:13:44,680 --> 05:13:49,560
Wait, so like for like if you want more things to show up or like this to happen or that to happen. Okay

3043
05:13:50,520 --> 05:13:53,240
I think we're in the first sub 20 minutes is doable

3044
05:13:58,360 --> 05:14:01,320
So I have to do this three more times there's four levels

3045
05:14:04,280 --> 05:14:06,280
Interesting

3046
05:14:13,160 --> 05:14:17,000
So I ha I would have to go back and beat meg again if I die

3047
05:14:19,160 --> 05:14:21,160
That's annoying

3048
05:14:23,720 --> 05:14:26,840
Oh, it's like sisyphus. No, yeah

3049
05:14:34,280 --> 05:14:36,280
I'm constructing a horse ring that we did

3050
05:14:36,440 --> 05:14:38,440
Oh

3051
05:14:39,880 --> 05:14:45,480
Zach can get hella broken. Okay. That's annoying. I don't want to fight her again

3052
05:14:49,720 --> 05:14:52,440
And others okay, interesting

3053
05:14:53,960 --> 05:14:55,960
Funny you say that

3054
05:14:56,440 --> 05:14:59,480
All right, I'm gonna pause it here then so I don't fuck up or run

3055
05:15:02,120 --> 05:15:04,120
Damn that sucks

3056
05:15:06,360 --> 05:15:08,360
I

3057
05:15:16,520 --> 05:15:17,960
Sick

3058
05:15:17,960 --> 05:15:19,720
That was fun

3059
05:15:19,720 --> 05:15:23,560
I like the game a lot. I did not realize how much I enjoy roguelites

3060
05:15:25,000 --> 05:15:31,240
I know someone uh, I know straw knee was like I should play biting of Isaac since I like called the lamb and I was telling her

3061
05:15:31,240 --> 05:15:33,240
She should play called the lamb since she was biting of Isaac

3062
05:15:33,240 --> 05:15:35,240
Um

3063
05:15:36,760 --> 05:15:39,960
Cool all right, thank you for uh

3064
05:15:42,120 --> 05:15:50,680
You might find me enjoy your early spot. He was like, uh level four gross. Uh, not this place again

3065
05:15:53,400 --> 05:15:58,360
Yeah, this is a great game. I didn't I'm wishing that I played it sooner

3066
05:15:58,360 --> 05:16:05,560
It's really good. I really like the spear. I think the spear is my favorite

3067
05:16:05,560 --> 05:16:07,160
I thought the bow was gonna be my favorite

3068
05:16:07,160 --> 05:16:11,720
But uh, I just have to wait until I get those gloves because maybe who knows

3069
05:16:13,720 --> 05:16:17,640
But I hope you guys have a good night. Hope you enjoyed. I'm sorry. Sometimes I would go to this non verbal

3070
05:16:17,640 --> 05:16:21,000
I just like I sometimes I just need to focus and I can't

3071
05:16:21,720 --> 05:16:23,720
Like um talk

3072
05:16:23,800 --> 05:16:27,720
It's hard for me to like give commentary and I'm just like no I just I just need to

3073
05:16:28,760 --> 05:16:30,760
Lock in bro

3074
05:16:30,760 --> 05:16:32,760
um

3075
05:16:33,400 --> 05:16:35,400
That was definitely

3076
05:16:38,680 --> 05:16:43,960
That was definitely due to I'm learning how the boons work and what stacks well

3077
05:16:45,560 --> 05:16:47,560
And that's good

3078
05:16:50,280 --> 05:16:51,560
Let's wish I played it sooner

3079
05:16:51,560 --> 05:16:56,040
I know because this game has been out for a bit and I've always I've seen the art of the character

3080
05:16:56,440 --> 05:16:58,440
I didn't think I would like the

3081
05:16:59,160 --> 05:17:03,560
Game style because I usually don't like birds. I view games

3082
05:17:04,520 --> 05:17:07,240
And I I realize I just need to give games a chance

3083
05:17:07,480 --> 05:17:13,320
I really do because I might not like because like again like I played balder's gate for like three hours sometimes

3084
05:17:14,280 --> 05:17:15,720
um

3085
05:17:15,720 --> 05:17:20,760
And I didn't end up liking it, but I bet if I tried again, I would like it a lot. I might try to play balder's gate

3086
05:17:22,840 --> 05:17:24,840
I don't have a PC though. I have one from my playstation

3087
05:17:26,040 --> 05:17:27,720
Same with um

3088
05:17:27,720 --> 05:17:30,040
Call the lamb. I didn't think I'd like it. I ended up loving it

3089
05:17:30,920 --> 05:17:34,920
And same with diablo. I had never played a diablo game before but I really really

3090
05:17:35,800 --> 05:17:37,800
Like the concept of the latest diablo game

3091
05:17:39,000 --> 05:17:42,520
And I ended up loving it. I was like, oh, let's just skyrim from a different viewpoint

3092
05:17:44,600 --> 05:17:50,280
I hope you enjoyed the tutorial. Oh damn if that's a tutorial, I'm gonna get my ass handed to me

3093
05:17:51,160 --> 05:17:53,160
I'm gonna go right back to the start

3094
05:17:56,120 --> 05:18:01,640
Mm-hmm. The focus of the log kid makes it much easier. Okay. Sometimes I feel bad when I can't talk

3095
05:18:02,280 --> 05:18:06,200
Uh, sometimes I just want to focus, but I'm glad you guys enjoyed

3096
05:18:08,040 --> 05:18:10,040
One of my classes in the world loves ma'am

3097
05:18:10,760 --> 05:18:12,760
That's all that scratching is

3098
05:18:13,720 --> 05:18:17,640
Balder's gate was indulged my interest. I didn't know uh, you could play with like more than one person

3099
05:18:18,600 --> 05:18:20,920
I thought it was like two people or something at the most

3100
05:18:21,880 --> 05:18:25,640
But cool. All right, I'll see you guys. I'm gonna go to bed

3101
05:18:25,720 --> 05:18:30,360
I wasn't gonna try to play elden ring after this, but I'm like, I think I'm good

3102
05:18:32,200 --> 05:18:37,080
I was like, I don't think I'm ready to try to grind to kill those stupid virgin abdicators

3103
05:18:37,880 --> 05:18:39,880
Uh, I'll probably do that in the morning

3104
05:18:43,240 --> 05:18:45,240
But tomorrow's sunday

3105
05:18:46,120 --> 05:18:48,120
Yeah, and I don't stream tomorrow. I'll probably

3106
05:18:49,080 --> 05:18:56,680
I'll probably I might do a gorilla depends of elden ring. Um, I also need to clean my house

3107
05:18:58,200 --> 05:19:02,680
I picked up a little bit today and I did my laundry, but I need to fold it and put away and that stuff

3108
05:19:04,040 --> 05:19:09,960
Because I just I really want to get to the dlc. I'm like, I'm taking forever to get to the dlc. Um

3109
05:19:11,720 --> 05:19:16,120
I'm excited to see like your promising app rabbit. Where's the app now have fun with the games? I don't know

3110
05:19:17,080 --> 05:19:20,200
I don't know everybody watches streamers differently. So

3111
05:19:21,560 --> 05:19:23,560
Yeah, have a good night everybody

05:19:29,720 --> 05:19:31,800

3114
05:19:32,520 --> 05:19:36,840

3115
05:19:37,800 --> 05:19:39,080

3117

3118
05:19:43,160 --> 05:19:49,480

It smells like stinky stinky smell

3124
05:20:40,840 --> 05:20:42,840
The smelly smell

3125
05:20:44,520 --> 05:20:46,520
The smelly

3126
05:21:09,880 --> 05:21:11,880
