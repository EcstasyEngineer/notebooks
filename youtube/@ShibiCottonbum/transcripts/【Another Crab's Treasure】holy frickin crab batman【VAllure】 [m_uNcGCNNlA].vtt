02:00.000 --> 02:30.000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

02:30.000 --> 03:00.000
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

03:00.000 --> 03:24.920
Look who it is. If it isn't a couple of losers. Do you like my cover up? I think it's effective.

03:24.920 --> 03:33.960
harlots today. It's my little sensor bar and also if you don't know my name I

03:33.960 --> 03:39.840
think it's effective. Hello hello how's it going? It's going good! Having a good

03:39.840 --> 03:48.080
day today. Lounge in Maxon and Relaxon. We'll listen to a little bit of Kylie

03:48.080 --> 03:57.040
Minogue of some pre-stream prep. I would really like to dance a bunch and just

03:57.040 --> 04:02.160
get real hype before stream. Don't forget to tweet. You're correct. You're

04:02.160 --> 04:10.480
correct. Can't forget. I smell absolutely delicious because I just came out of the

04:10.480 --> 04:16.600
shower and I forgot, boomie with the home, and I forgot I had some of my

04:16.600 --> 04:27.160
favorite lotion left. I really like the smell of pansy from Lush. It's funny

04:27.160 --> 04:34.080
because on my friend it smelled like old lady flowers but on me I

04:34.080 --> 04:41.840
don't know. Maybe it's my pheromones. It just smells absolutely delicious. Oh we

04:41.840 --> 04:50.640
getting raided! Raflin ride! Holy crap! It's Momay! Have fun beating the crabs!

04:50.640 --> 04:58.560
Forever beating back the crabs. How was the monetization stream? Oh did you guys

04:58.560 --> 05:07.640
have a nice dose of Momay feet? Can I get a sniffer? This is me smelling

05:07.640 --> 05:16.120
Strony's feet. Oh god. Smells smells like salty sea brine. Fucking love it!

05:16.840 --> 05:24.960
Momay's monkey feet! I honestly I'm very impressed with her dexterity with her

05:24.960 --> 05:31.080
feet. Like I definitely I don't I could probably hold something but she was

05:31.080 --> 05:36.880
like doing the whole thing where she's like sticking like ASMR tools in your

05:36.880 --> 05:45.840
ear and I was just I was impressed. I just lurked because I was beating my

05:45.840 --> 05:57.480
I mean I mean I was trying to practice my own foot dexterity. So now do your

05:57.480 --> 06:01.920
foot ASMR stream. Yeah I'm waiting for my red high heels to come in. I need to get

06:01.920 --> 06:08.400
my so like I said that was like that picture I took was from like a month

06:08.400 --> 06:19.520
ago. So I need to get my toes done again. Great carpet clenches. Carpet clenches.

06:19.520 --> 06:28.040
Now that that's one. Carpet grippers. Yeah I got I got the watch of my

06:28.040 --> 06:35.240
collards. I got my tights. Now I just need the heels. I still haven't tried on the

06:35.280 --> 06:40.880
cosplay. I need to do that. And if it doesn't fit I might just wear the shirt

06:40.880 --> 06:44.600
unbuttoned and then this this just like I'll just find it try to find it with

06:44.600 --> 06:51.320
mini skirt. Heel dangle. Oh yeah. Love my giant name tag. Thank you. It's my my

06:51.320 --> 06:56.160
cover-up. I think it's doing a pretty good job. It's not transparent or

06:56.160 --> 07:06.160
anything. Carp. I don't know if I would call it like a carpet clencher. Like use

07:06.160 --> 07:12.480
feet for that on a the other type of carpet. That just sounds painful. Like

07:12.480 --> 07:18.800
did you ever like have that one person or friend that could like use their feet

07:18.800 --> 07:23.680
and like pinch you with them? One of my childhood friends would freak me out by

07:23.680 --> 07:27.080
doing that. Maybe that's not what that's why I'm not into feet is because I was

07:27.080 --> 07:32.720
traumatized by my friend pinching you with her monkey feet. So like imagine

07:32.720 --> 07:38.080
like oh my god ASMR roleplay where Shawnee pinches you with her feet as

07:38.080 --> 07:46.800
punishment. Yep yep. Brother can snap with his toes. What the hell? That's just

07:47.120 --> 07:54.480
Is he a mutant? Or is she a Scott? No. She was just blonde white girl.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.880
And she had the she had a valley girl accent.

08:03.520 --> 08:11.520
Very funny. Where is she pinching? Well in terms of Shawnee, I don't know that's up to her.

08:11.920 --> 08:18.240
Sorry. I'm adjusting myself a little bit here. I can use my feet to pick up the small objects

08:18.240 --> 08:22.400
on the other side of my desk. What the fuck? Thank you. Thank you. I have a great sensor.

08:23.600 --> 08:31.040
Ebony Darkness. Ebony. She she uh Shibbony. Shibbony Darkness took over my channel for a

08:31.040 --> 08:35.280
couple of streams yesterday. My cats have the zoomies right now. What are you doing?

08:35.920 --> 08:40.560
Can you chill out and stop chasing her? Oomie's like harassing a sister.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.280
I hope you guys enjoyed her. She was she was pretty cool. She's a little bit too edgy for my

08:47.280 --> 08:57.200
taste. But uh yeah she's nice. Just like um the other other lady that uh was running that one bar.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.960
She can also disconnect her head from her body. It's really impressive. I wish I had that skill

09:00.960 --> 09:05.120
you know. 10 hour stream today. I I think not.

09:07.920 --> 09:15.920
I think not. I think uh just because I don't think I have I'll probably end up rage quitting

09:15.920 --> 09:21.760
especially with the level the portion of the part that we're on for um uh another crabs

09:21.760 --> 09:29.440
event uh adventure. Another crabs treasure. Nine hour stream then. And a lot of fanfic reading

09:29.440 --> 09:36.080
happened. I went done no I went uphill. We were on a straight incline. We talked about you know how

09:38.560 --> 09:44.720
Hogwarts and a squid made beautiful consensual love. Um

09:48.800 --> 09:54.640
can you hear my cats zooming around my house right now? I turn off the filter so you can.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.240
You hear there's a little just like galloping and then they're they're tokyo drifting around

09:58.240 --> 10:05.040
the corners in my apartment. Just don't be bad at video game. Uh that's impossible for me.

10:06.880 --> 10:15.200
Don't run with your wands out. Yeah there was just like scrawny um squid inked everywhere in Hogwarts.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.680
I have some delicious tea. Heard it a little. No.

10:21.680 --> 10:29.040
It's because Fia likes to take refuge by my feet under my desk. I'm like I'm like you know how

10:29.040 --> 10:36.240
when you play tag as a kid or like just some sort of tag related game um you would have like a

10:36.240 --> 10:42.240
home base where you were safe especially if it was like freeze tag or something. That's what they

10:42.240 --> 10:45.920
use me as. I'm not even joking. If I'm in any part of the house and they're running around

10:46.480 --> 10:51.760
Boomi and Fia will use me as like a home base. Hello welcome in.

10:54.560 --> 11:02.480
What literary masterpiece did you miss yesterday? You missed uh 15 chapters of My Immortal and um

11:03.680 --> 11:10.880
the actual castle Hogwarts being uh tentacle banged by a giant squid. So if you ever check

11:10.880 --> 11:19.840
those out go check them out. You know I'm also working on um I'm gonna re uh public I don't

11:19.840 --> 11:25.120
know what the fuck I'm saying. I'm gonna make public that class of 09 VOD that everybody loved.

11:25.120 --> 11:31.200
I'm just waiting to get monetization before I do because I feel like they would go on that and

11:31.200 --> 11:35.200
they'd be like wow this is bad. We thought the other video was bad of class of what this is worse.

11:35.200 --> 11:40.720
That was my cat.

11:43.920 --> 11:50.960
They're zooming. Yeah yeah I gotta gotta sneak it one in. Yeah I don't they they were pretty like

11:50.960 --> 11:56.720
Boomi was chilling next to me and then they just started zooming. Happy Tuesday. It's Tuesday unit!

11:57.680 --> 12:02.880
Rob, Rob is fucking Tuesday. I can fucking say it. It's Tuesday.

12:04.800 --> 12:12.160
First get monetized then get canceled. Um you know my attempt at speedrunning getting canceled has

12:12.960 --> 12:22.480
not worked. I'm very surprised by that. It's Chokshik Tuesday. She'd be Tuesday. I'm really

12:22.480 --> 12:26.800
excited to hopefully be um do the monetization stream and do like member streams because I'm

12:26.800 --> 12:31.840
telling you I want to do that self-tying shabar stream. You can't see what I'm pointing at you

12:31.840 --> 12:36.400
and waggling my finger like a teacher who knows you're up to no good because you copied off of

12:36.400 --> 12:44.240
someone's homework. I'm very very excited for the power wash collab this week. That is going to be

12:44.240 --> 12:52.800
funny as hell. I'm debating whether or not to stream my viewpoint. What do you guys think?

12:52.800 --> 12:56.320
Like what do you want? Because it's going to be all of us streaming at the same time and I'm like

12:58.160 --> 13:02.560
what's the point? I'm like I don't know. If you want me to see do you want to see my viewpoint?

13:03.920 --> 13:09.760
I'm sorry I can't draw Rob Shibi. It's okay. A lot of the artists that will make commission for me

13:09.760 --> 13:18.720
they always drew my ropes as straps. Like even my header art and my twitter and my wallpaper

13:18.720 --> 13:23.760
that I also use it. It's just straps. It's just leather straps. It's not even rope or it looks

13:23.760 --> 13:33.920
like ribbon. Give the clippers work. Hey Shibi I bought all 50 parts of the paper. Thanks for the

13:34.080 --> 13:42.720
recommendation. Oh my god. That is such a just read like an excerpt from that book and you can

13:42.720 --> 13:54.560
thank me later. I managed to shake down Emmy for the book title of the interesting book she wants

13:54.560 --> 14:00.080
to read. I read the synopsis and I was like okay this is right up my alley all right. She's like

14:00.080 --> 14:06.640
what? And I'm like yeah I'm on that shit and she's like oh okay and then I sent another

14:07.840 --> 14:17.280
terrible fucked up smut book her way. I sent her den of vipers. I couldn't even get through that book

14:17.280 --> 14:24.400
it was so bad. But I'm like I'm trying to try to convince management to give me a podcast with

14:24.800 --> 14:35.680
um uh my IRL friend Salem because she also reads a lot of smutty books and and maybe Emmy and we

14:35.680 --> 14:40.720
can have a little book club together and the other girls because I you know you know mercy reads that

14:40.720 --> 14:48.880
shit you know she reads that shit you know and you would like you would like Salem she's cute and

14:48.880 --> 15:03.520
funny maybe I'll drop a PNG for her. Mercy is say so she be. She's she's she's got you guys good huh

15:04.240 --> 15:11.920
her sweet little yandere facade yeah yeah just wait just wait till she shows her true power

15:12.880 --> 15:19.920
none of you will be safe. My GF right smut ironically I used to write so much

15:20.640 --> 15:29.680
smut when I was younger. So Salem is what I call one of my um uh one of my best friends IRL. She is

15:30.640 --> 15:39.200
uh very cute and funny she is adorable um she is way more base than I am.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.960
You guys would like her a lot I might just I would probably be it wouldn't be like a live podcast

15:46.960 --> 15:53.040
which definitely is like a pre-recorded thing um she heavily supports me v-tubing and she was so proud

15:53.040 --> 15:59.360
of me um when I got accepted into VLR her and Olive which is one of my other IRL friends and Olive

15:59.360 --> 16:04.400
is an actress so she was just like yeah entertainment industry so we're all creative types out here

16:06.240 --> 16:09.920
uh bro mercy says she showers once a week and nothing sweet on that girl what do you mean

16:09.920 --> 16:15.280
you know it's like when something smells so so bad that it almost smells like sourly sickly sweet

16:17.120 --> 16:23.120
that's that's mercy there I say Salem for gen two no she got she got she does not have enough time

16:23.120 --> 16:29.120
to be a vtuber she does not have time to be a vtuber she got she got a big girl job

16:30.560 --> 16:36.720
envisioned the aroma I yeah I used to I used to write so much fucking smut when I was younger

16:36.720 --> 16:43.920
I was no like me and my other my uh one of my childhood best friends um like I mentioned before

16:43.920 --> 16:50.880
like we would do post by post role play a lot and then we realized oh my god we're we're good at writing

16:50.880 --> 16:57.040
what if we wrote bad stuff and so we would get requests from other students on our our grade

16:57.760 --> 17:06.400
mind you this was like fifth grade and we were known as like uh the the lemon girls

17:07.360 --> 17:08.400
if you know what a lemon is

17:10.960 --> 17:15.840
and some people would get us requests from their favorite characters and we would write like

17:16.640 --> 17:24.720
we take like commissions and we'd be like all right and I'd be like uh insert this classmate's

17:24.720 --> 17:37.520
name here with this character from this uh anime it was bad I remember one of the teachers um

17:38.080 --> 17:44.720
um found one of the stuff because like we had a we had a notebook dedicated for that shit

17:45.920 --> 17:51.360
I I think I threw it away when I was moving and I'm pissed at myself and my old sketchbook

17:51.360 --> 17:55.440
because I would have led to show you guys my old sketchbook with all my OCs that I had

17:55.440 --> 18:00.800
when I was like the ages of 12 to 18

18:01.520 --> 18:06.080
dude write me in a jar jar banks do

18:09.440 --> 18:15.040
did you do well in oh yeah no I I always had straight A's in my um my English classes my

18:15.040 --> 18:22.080
literature classes and um and creative writing I remember in my creative writing class I wrote

18:22.160 --> 18:32.160
I wrote so I had written this like really nicely done like introductory story almost

18:32.160 --> 18:38.160
like an isekai but it was like to a different planet like again I would I really liked the

18:38.160 --> 18:44.880
princess of mars like the john carter series so I was very heavily inspired by that and like the

18:44.880 --> 18:51.600
main character was this dude they got abducted it was made into a slave for the queen of the

18:51.600 --> 18:58.320
world and I like submitted that for the creative writing class and everybody was like wow this is

18:58.320 --> 19:02.080

20:21.600 --> 20:26.080
from I think I was like a junior or sophomore in high school

20:28.080 --> 20:32.080

be my my tagline your ex thought those movies were peak romance oh my god it's so bad that's toxic

23:12.640 --> 23:19.040
is hell the main kiss so okay so let me explain to you what the after series is it is a One Direction

23:19.040 --> 23:26.080
fan fiction where the main character is a self-insert of the author and she is in love with Harry

23:26.080 --> 23:32.320
Styles except imagine Harry Styles having an alcoholic dad having an alcoholic problem of his own

23:33.040 --> 23:45.440
being only like 18 or 17 uh beating people up doing drugs um imagine also having really bad anger

23:45.440 --> 23:55.600
issues imagine uh uh Lewis and Zane and all the other ones as like side characters that try to

23:55.600 --> 24:04.080
romance her but they're also toxic as hell exactly boomy um it was bad it was so bad like

24:04.080 --> 24:11.360
it's so toxic like they'll just like you know like when you watch a romance movie and like the main

24:11.360 --> 24:16.640
couple get like upset with each other but you know it easily could have been solved if they just like

24:17.280 --> 24:24.320
said what was on their mind instead of or like asking for clarification because that was the

24:24.400 --> 24:31.840
entire movie they just miscommunication between three movies hello hello welcome in

51:07.280 --> 51:18.400

momo is the best girl gamer that ever lived

53:05.520 --> 53:09.760

53:16.400 --> 53:17.440
what the hell are you doing

53:19.200 --> 53:25.120
cats making noises uh mama is the elden lord exactly i'm like

53:27.200 --> 53:30.480

53:37.120 --> 53:38.880
all right stop the bomb music again

53:42.560 --> 53:44.960
bro i fucking i need a trap remix of this

53:44.960 --> 53:48.960
it's not gonna

53:51.200 --> 53:52.960

53:52.960 --> 54:04.960
whoa

54:15.280 --> 54:24.960
i can't i am stuck okay

54:28.640 --> 54:28.960
oh

54:35.280 --> 54:40.800
well i'll fuck up even let's go she be believers

54:41.520 --> 54:46.320
uh i don't even know what what thing this is

54:51.920 --> 54:53.120
who is this my fourth attempt

54:57.280 --> 55:01.120
okay okay all right all right all right all right okay no ladies

55:02.720 --> 55:04.880
oh i fucked myself up there i didn't mean to press that button

55:11.040 --> 55:13.040
oh

55:17.120 --> 55:19.520
what the hell he has another hand he can use his other hand

55:24.880 --> 55:25.840
like i ninja run

55:25.840 --> 55:35.840
um

55:36.720 --> 55:45.840
he wasn't using his other arm before

55:56.320 --> 55:59.120
damn it i was hoping he was going to do the jump forward attack

55:59.120 --> 56:03.680
but i when he gets to halfway is when he does both hands

56:07.920 --> 56:12.080
using your other hand is a good skill to have it's annoying that there's no light

56:12.080 --> 56:15.600
shells in that area the dodge window with medium shells one bit brutal yeah

56:17.280 --> 56:23.600
you know bring up the strong hand i think of that like scary movie with the guy with

56:23.600 --> 56:27.600
those little hands

56:31.760 --> 56:47.600
why i didn't why isn't it working oh my god come closer please

56:53.600 --> 56:57.600
so

56:57.600 --> 57:26.720
I guess I rolled into that and I didn't run up close enough.

57:27.680 --> 57:34.480
There's a parry mechanic. I still haven't gotten the timing yet. It's like really weird.

57:36.320 --> 57:39.200
I can parry like a fucking god and Liza P but

57:42.160 --> 57:43.840
in this game I'm just not good.

57:43.840 --> 57:56.240
Okay it's important to do it only when it's close.

57:56.240 --> 58:13.200
Oh fuck I ran past one.

58:20.560 --> 58:22.480
There is a light shell it's right there.

58:23.040 --> 58:26.640
I might actually wait you can't reach me if I'm up here.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.960
Ah bitch come closer.

58:33.440 --> 58:37.440
Why don't you get around that little thing so I can do this.

58:46.640 --> 58:47.840
We're just gonna look at each other.

58:48.800 --> 58:52.800
He has some beautiful eyes. They have a certain glow to them. Did you know that?

59:01.360 --> 59:03.200
I can literally kind of cheese him like this.

59:03.920 --> 59:07.360
Just stay up here and every time I like land a hit on him

59:08.320 --> 59:14.400
I get more umami but that would just take forever though.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.480
You're so beautiful I can't stop looking at you.

59:21.840 --> 59:22.720
Hold on let me look at chat.

59:23.520 --> 59:26.480
I know the parry yet should be obvious in the game once you unlock it though.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.240
I thought the parry is the shell.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.720
Am I playing a mage? I'm a crap.

59:34.800 --> 59:40.160
Cheat strat. I can't run past them the place is blocked.

59:40.720 --> 59:42.240
How would I run past the boss?

59:44.480 --> 59:49.680
I wonder if this one will glitch like the other one did and just let me hit my little heart

59:49.680 --> 59:51.520
and let me um pass.

59:51.520 --> 01:00:11.920
Can I have this? Why are you stuck to me?

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.520
I'm gonna die. I need to run into a can.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.080
Oh that's the one that's broken.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.320
Where's the other can?

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:47.520
Oh god what does this one do? What's the pop-off do I forget?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.720
I rolled. Oh I hate it here.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.040
I don't even know what the fuck pop-off even does.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:09.120
Just fucking kill me. I don't even care at this point.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.880
This should only let you guard her first.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.080
Are you serious? Why don't they let me parry right away?

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.640
I'm starting to get angry because I suck. I need to get good.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.040
Okay so there's one right there, one right there.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.400
So I got one, two, three, four chances.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.120
I can also run up here.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.440
Like this is also a spot I can like run away from.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:58.720
I like wasted it though.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.400
Can I hit you?

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.240
Okay you can still hit me up here but not that well though.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:26.560
Is this a strat? Keep him in the corner.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.040
I think it's a strat.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.720
Yep it's a strat.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:54.000
I am in the map.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.720
It could be one of those bosses you're gonna come back later when you're powerful enough.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.920
No it's not. This is where I need to go to progress.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.120
I forgot I just like jumped down one time. Oh I fucked myself.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.240
I fucked myself my last run because oh I don't even fucking give a shit anymore.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.640
I think this is the cheese strat.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:42.560
Thrust is so hard to say through a wall. All right come here big boy.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.320
If he jumps you can make it up there.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:17.920
Come here. Come over here. Come here. Get over here please.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:27.200
Haha you fucking miss bitch. Suck my titties.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.200
Oh buddy.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.480
Oh.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:08.480
Then he'll usually go at me with that. Okay.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:22.480
You're a crab not a scorpion.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.120
Seems like the game wants you to get good at dodging heavy attacks.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:38.480
Well I'm not going to so this is how I play.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:52.480
Did I or did I not roll out of the fucking way for that? What the fuck is my hitbox dude?

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:06.480
See you just fucked myself again.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.480
Remember the fives of dodgeball? I watched that movie again recently.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.600
Fives of dodgeball be a pussy.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:44.800
Is there like lag to when I fucking dodge?

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.880
I am really pressing the fucking roll button.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:58.880
You actual fucking cocksucker. I swear to...

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:08.880
Get out of my face. Get out of my fucking face.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:26.880
Come closer.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.040
Sorry I'm a mad.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.200
I ran into that.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.440
I'm a little confused because

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:59.120
my shell doesn't take the brunt of the heavy attack.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.760
When he goes into a second phase he just kills me.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:09.360
When it's in his first phase and he does a heavy attack it just breaks my shell.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:16.720
I don't quite understand that.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.280
I need an audio or mad. I'm as mad as that or more.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:36.400
Like I usually don't like playing souls likes on stream because I get really angry

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:45.360
and I personally don't think it's the funnest gameplay to watch to just watch someone be angry

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:51.920
and not be good at a game. Like if you're like angry and then you like kill the boss in your

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.080
third try you'd be like all right that's pretty sick. But it's like when it's like 20 tries in

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:03.040
and you're like what the fuck like I remember I had a like that stupid clown boss from Lies of P

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:10.320
took me like three hours of trying in a stream ended up spiking my headphones and breaking

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.360
them and smashing them through my controller on the ground almost broke my monitor

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:24.320
and then in the next two runs I finally beat him but I did that all off stream

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.200
because I didn't want anybody to see

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:38.160
because it's you it's unfortunate training

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.920
I'm good as long you're having good time well like no like I'm enjoying myself playing like

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.120
because I like I don't mind Ragey games like this it's just that I personally can't watch somebody

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.960
play it with something because in my head I tend to backseat and I get frustrated I'm like just

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.480
fucking beat like you could have just done that there you couldn't like that's how I like watch

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.360
people who play these games so I get mad watching people play these games and they suck at them

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.200
like me because like I would go back and watch my vlogs and I'm like I'm such a fucking idiot where

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.600
the fuck did I do that all right

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:35.600
hmm

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.600
okay he clips through that so I don't want to

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.320
I like I literally will jump and it takes forever I'm like is it my controller

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.280
I have like a fucking Thunderbolt C so it's not like is it the cable I don't

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:02.800
why is there such a delay in my like I'm pressing stuff before it happens and then it happens a second later

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:13.280
so

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.720
at least you get stuck on that little embankment so I can chill for a second

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.160
huh uh I just choked on my spit

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.600
do you have dead zones on what's that

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.480
I didn't feel like there was a delay when I was playing so it could be an issue

01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.840
controller dead zones can delay you I don't know what that means

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:08.880
maybe we should hit the boss a little bit then back away hit him again thanks Sachiko aren't you

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:16.720
a fucking genius bro it's medium weight dodge roll is it is it really the dodge roll

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.080
yo how you been snowflake this is what the fuck I'm not icy

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.920
dead zones are like how far you move the stick until registers an input

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.400
maybe it's a ps5 controller

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.040
okay he's kind of stuck on that

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:49.200
how the how the fuck did he run after me so fast

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.520
okay he's on this

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.760
he's on the piercing part of his face

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:13.520
oh I thought I had some can you come over here instead you come over here

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.600
can you come over here can you come over this way this way good puppy come on

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.840
be a good dog and listen

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:50.480
to defeat blue poops a firefighter attack until it dies oh my god you wanna thank you oh my god

01:13:51.280 --> 01:14:01.200
have you tried dodging no oh my god I need to try dodging have you tried lowering its HP

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:09.040
oh my god you got why didn't I try this before holy crap I'm so dumb sometimes you know

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.720
I need it to go over that way

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.720
oh

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.720
I got a bog

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.720
have you tried shooting it hold on hold on hold on

01:14:50.800 --> 01:15:10.800
all right let's see if shooting it helps

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.360
I wish I had a toggle on this so that it would show like a muzzle flash

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.720
okay

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.640

oh wait holy crap I thought are you on are you this whole fucking mass Jesus fuck you're huge

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.840
the gun adds plus ton attack

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:52.880
as long last the hermit crab lays eye in the powerful eyes sorry when the powerful

01:20:52.880 --> 01:21:02.080
waterline sensual body of the snail hi uh thanks for leaving me here I think the duchess is

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:09.840
really gonna like this pearl but I still need a way to get out of this cave in order to progress

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.160
the hermit crab will need to further expand on its omami abilities

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.280
I don't think I can do the ash catching voice it's creating my my throat

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.200
cool how do I do that I'm getting to a dam

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:35.920
I mean um the hermit crab closes his eyes and allows himself to become one with the waves

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.680
he notices the effect on his body has on I can't read the currents around him

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.400
and lets himself be changed by them in turn okay

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:56.560
hey when I close my eyes I can start to see something I see a tree some sort of tree of skills

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.240
shell deportation oh

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.360
I have every single thing leaves currents in the wake in its wake why can't I read today

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.480
as it travels through his ocean this ocean I have dyslexia

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:22.320
be it a living person a beast a corpse but even a piece of garbage

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.280
gabbage the life force of the ocean the beating heart of this world

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:34.960
this phenomenon is known as umami invisible to most umami currents can be detected only

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:43.520
by chosen few excuse me even fewer still can make use of them oh the glowing purple stuff

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.040
I've seen that surrounding some big shells and crystals out there

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.440
surprising I guess I didn't you know zap you that I mean um

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.240
the hermit crab's training may progress faster than anticipated

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:03.440
he feels that perhaps if he enters a discarded moon snail shell a new use for it's might reveal itself

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:13.200
the dyslexia whose dyslexia must be a baddie

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.880
yeah that was that was the snail that wasn't me guys

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.760
you can read not really shell deporting

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:35.120
that's the same sound I swear that's used by

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:41.360
I call the lamb for something

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:51.040
uh much money I got

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.040
fuck your mother

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.280
what sort of build should I go for guys

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.680
shell collection oh shit

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:29.040
even if I get the shell it doesn't have a spell on it

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:43.280
fast tonight in uh I had I played only three hours of balder's gate three

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:49.040
and I got bored and I haven't played it since

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:58.800
gun build

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:07.760
but I feel like maybe if I because I think I went into the game expecting I guess Scott

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:14.320
because I've never played any game like I never played um uh well I did play like dragon age

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:21.760
inquisition I didn't like it either um I didn't I thought balder's gate would play more like

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:29.760
like skyrim does or like oblivion and it doesn't I'm not a huge fan of turn-based games the only

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.880
like turn-based game I'm a fan of is fire emblem three houses

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.360

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.200

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.840

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:46.500

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.440
harlots are sassy today

01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.600
she hates to be RPGs um should check out outer worlds I've been told to play outer worlds

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.360
I was getting out of scrolls I too polar opposite of RPG that's what I mean I realized I like elder scrolls

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:16.560
polar pull of RPGs so if they reload I've actually never played for any persona game

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.080
through I wish they had something more open world probably like follow new bangas yeah

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.160
a vowed coming what's a vowed bear what a collab with the girls playing oh yeah no I

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.440
would totally play with them might just be the games built in input lag maybe

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:45.600
yeah screw the storyline it's all that matters this game looks like Elden Ring I don't know

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.000
I don't know fucking Elden Ring you've been playing

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.480
um yeah I know strong he's gonna be playing Elden Ring every go a type of run she's doing

01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:05.440
I uh I will maybe all get Elden Ring since people keep asking why did I I meant to

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.080
teleport I get distracted maybe I'll play if enough people want me to after she plays

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:28.720
um can marry Ronnie or something because I got the frenzied flame ending last time I played

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:41.600

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.320
I like that character I like the moves now character

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:49.360
wait does Elden Ring Elden Ring looks like this game

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:07.520
okay am I tripping or before the song started did it go one two three four

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.360
because I heard a whisper of a voice and I'm scared I'm losing my mind

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.680
you got the Elden Ring deal yeah I got um shout-outs of the air tree a little bit

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:31.840

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:05.920
I've been standing watch my whole life for what got nothing in return stupid stupid

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:14.000
hey excuse me I gotta get back in and see the Duchess again keeps piling up all the trash all the

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.080

aw little guys stuck jeez what the fuck happened to you

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.880
do I want to even try to kill you

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:02.720
I could use the micro plastics I don't like

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.720
actually you seem like you have as much like a little bit less

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:18.720
health than the other dude actually no yeah I can kill you what

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:34.000
okay you're done did I parry I don't think I parried there but whatever

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.640
if you're beating Elden Ring how come you just suck so much of this game that's a great question

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:55.040
actually I didn't like beat Elden Ring in a short amount of time I did it in like 150 hours or more

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.200
it's like a long clam

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:07.280
oh uh can you not kill me oh

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.520

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:28.640
oh so if I do the run and lunging attack I want to run lunging attack okay cool

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.400

even know how I jumped on the sword

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.800
to be fair Elden Ring dodge is better than this game here you're supposed to block parry more

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:55.440
than dodge it seems like it Elden Ring isn't a cleverly disguised platformer now that's

01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:02.640
eyes of pee those lobsters were using straws isn't that enough straw sample player second power

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.880
oh I have to go around see this crab

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.640

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.720
zen gunman tipped four dollars thank you zen fun fact hermit crabs are not crabs but shrimp

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.720
what zero tents worst game my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:34.400
is that true

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:42.160
wait actually no I was going off the beaten path for a second

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.960
are they really actually you know what kind of makes sense

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.680
just because of the little bodies have you ever seen a hermit crab out of its shell they look

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.400
fucking gross

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.640

how's something that's fucking just stabbing my leg

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:41.760
justice show the hermit crabs of Pagore that are mostly closer to squat lobsters

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.000
porcelain crabs and they are true crabs

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.960

I forget I don't have a fucking shell

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:08.000
got to go fast I'm so happy there is no stamina in this game though maybe that's why

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:08.960
there's input lag

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.320
look at that imprint this

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:22.720

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.680
can't go that way

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:39.600
I can literally just stay on this and just jump not the deal with them

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:47.600
um

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:58.080
got this yes I probably have to like fight the queen or something or the duchess

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.600
doesn't make any sense because then I wouldn't need to pay my taxes anymore

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:13.440
where'd he go team rocket blasting off again am I going to the surface I'm so close to the

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.720
surface right now

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:34.720
oh yeah I'm definitely gonna have to do a boss battle in a moment

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:46.720
um

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:50.720
I'm letting go

I could have sworn I already collected three of those blood star things

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.720
yeah I thought it was said three I guess it's four

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.400
oh here where the options are haha perfect

01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.280
okay

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.760
assist what's assist mode what does assist mode

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:53.360
oh it's the

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.800
heart is a default okay

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:07.760

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:25.040
um I kind of want to see what the gun thing is

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:30.400
I can recover micro plastics

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:47.600
will that help

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:53.600
maybe

01:47:53.600 --> 01:48:04.400
okay

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.400
okay

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:39.600
Okay, I'm ready to play now.

01:48:39.600 --> 01:49:03.600
Alright, I just want to know how this works.

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:15.600
I can't go that way.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:21.600
Go fucking run!

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:43.600
You're gone for a sentence for you to run in.

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.600
You know what it locks? I don't even have to do anything.

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.600
Give me that.

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.600
What is this?

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.600
Oh, sick.

01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:58.600
Oh, cool.

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.600
Oh, because I probably got to go over.

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:04.600
What the fuck?

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:13.600
Why can't I?

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.600
I can't shoot him.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:21.600
It wouldn't let me lock on.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:28.600
Wait, wait, hold on. Can you come back?

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:32.600
It literally is a one hit kill.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.600
Alright, I'm ready to face the boss.

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:38.600
That's for sure.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.600
Oh, I can't fucking jump though.

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:48.600
Wait, let me...

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.600
I'm a battle crab.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.600
Let me swap real quick.

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.600
I'll grab the- I don't know how a gun works underwater.

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.600
Come on, I can't make that.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.600
Perfect.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:08.600
Oh, sick.

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:18.600
Where do I- is this a-

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.600
Oh, that's cool.

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:24.600
Kind of just kamikaze yourself.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:29.600
Alright, grab that gun.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:36.600
Nice. I don't know how I can pull the trigger.

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:39.600
Are you alive?

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:43.600
You fucking dead? Oh my god, he's fucking dead.

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.600
Alright, bitch.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:54.600
I'm fucking ready.

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.600
What is wrong with you?

01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:03.600
What the fuck?

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:08.600
Oh, shuck.

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:15.600
Did you see the gun in my ass in the cutscene?

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:20.600
Is oil making all the animals crazy?

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.600
The fish crazy?

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:35.600
The crustacean's crazy.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:43.600
Well, I have a fucking gun, so...

01:52:44.600 --> 01:53:00.600
All of our lives are a sand beneath the tide. You'll see.

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:04.600
I didn't think it would one-shot her.

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:06.600
I didn't think it would one-shot her.

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:09.600
I thought it would take a bunch of hits on her.

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:23.600
At least five or something.

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.600
Holy abalone!

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:31.600
That was a show of a fight, kid, was it?

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.600
You were watching the whole thing?

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.600
I guess it was too much to ask the soldiers caught you, jerk.

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.600
No such luck. I hit as soon as everyone started going crazy.

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.600
Who the fuck is controlling me?

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.600
That's the five I never picked a fight he doesn't have up to.

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:50.600
He could learn a thing or two from a guy like me.

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:53.600
Well, now the judges says, you know...

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.600
So give me my shot back. You have no reason to keep anymore, right?

01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:01.600
Huh, this whole thing, you know, I can barely remember how I got my fins on it anymore.

01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:04.600
Thinkin' I might just go pawn this off in the big city?

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.600
Make myself a few microplastics?

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:09.600
What? What? You can't do that!

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.600
I will shoot you into the motherfucking gun.

01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.600
You're using a human-sized gun and a crab.

01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.600
I think it's gonna one-shot her.

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:21.600
And that's how you afford a fake taxes.

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.600
It's the gun I described earlier, about 100% chance of incident.

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.600
Oh!

01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.600
Excuse me. Oh, so I can do anything he wants.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.600
He's gonna get away with, kid.

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.600
See me a new carcinia.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.600
Carcinia.

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.600
English. If you wanna buy this bad boy back from me.

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.600
If no one else buys it first, that is.

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.600
No!

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.600
When I get my hands on that guy, I swear, I don't have hands, I have claws.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:50.600
I swear I'm gonna shoot him.

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.600
You have wearing your first adaptation attack.

01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.600
Wearing from a powerful creature that can be used without even a shell equipped.

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.600
Okay, my cat is looking at my foot.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:07.600
Raina, what are you doing?

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.600
Okay.

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.600
Oh, that's not it.

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.600
The fuck? Where did this come from?

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.600
Oh.

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.600
Cool.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.600
Okay, but it needs to.

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:30.600
Alright.

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.600
She be in the hood.

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.600
Let me put the gun away.

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:45.600
I feel like I just cheated. I didn't think that was gonna happen.

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:48.600
It's fine. I probably would have cried for five hours anyways.

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.600
Gonna cheese the whole game with the gun.

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.600
I'm tempted to.

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.600
But I won't.

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.600
How does this stay on my ass?

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:06.600
Alright.

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:25.600
I'm just gonna turn that off.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.600
Can I go back? Okay.

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.600
I need a...

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.600
So, can you hear my controller click when I'm like...

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:50.600
That's like the timing is...

01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.600
Literally like a half a second off.

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:01.600
So, I'm seeing it putting up the settings.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:03.600
Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm like...

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:06.600
I'm like, guys, I swear to you, I'm not usually this bad.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:10.600
Like, I decently got through Lies of Pea

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:14.600
and Elden Ring. It's just such as a fucking delay.

01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.600
If I put it up to 200, it will happen.

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.600
I can't even tell if that's any better.

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.600
Maybe PC is better? Let me see.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:53.600
That is a little bit better.

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.600
How do I...

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:00.600
Yeah, it's actually a lot more responsive on PC.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:05.600
But Jesus fuck, it changes my mouse sensitivity to the fucking moon.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:25.600
Can I please fucking scroll down?

01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:27.600
Can I please scroll down?

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.600
Tap the... What the fuck are these tap...

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:35.600
These fucking bindings.

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:48.600
I can't even use... I can't even use the buttons on the side of my mouse.

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:51.600
Oh, Jesus fuck.

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.600
Turn the arm on, see it.

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.600
Okay.

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:20.600
I feel like it's a little bit better.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.600
No, it's not.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.600
The dodge is better but the attack isn't.

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:32.600
Okay.

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:40.600
No, literally when you turn on this game it says it's best with a controller.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:47.600
Have you considered simply getting good as the kids say?

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:50.600
You're only as good as your equipment.

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:51.600
That's what they say.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.600
Skins equals wins.

01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.600
Counter strike.

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:59.600
My need to assign it the mouse down column to the keyboard one.

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:05.600
Let me try that.

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:12.600
Because I'll play with keyboard if that works, if it's better then.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:24.600
Actually...

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.600
...

02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.600
Jesus fuck.

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:48.600
You always run faster with a knife.

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.600
Boobs counts as equip.

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:53.600
Holy moly.

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:56.600
Yes, you like my equipment?

02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:59.600
You like my equipment?

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:16.600
Actually, I would prefer...

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.600
...

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:23.600
... because I'm thinking about how I play...

02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:26.600
... FPS games.

02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:28.600
...

02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:46.600
The fuck was left control being used for?

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:50.600
Heal, that's fine.

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.600
F, that's fine.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.600
Shell spell.

02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:00.600
Okay, I was going to use Q for that, but Q's already there.

02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.600
Hammer.

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.600
Folk, oh, focus.

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:09.600
What the fuck, hammer?

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:16.600
What the fuck is C being used for?

02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.600
C's not being used for anything, am I blind?

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:28.600
...

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.600
God, why the fuck am I...

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.600
Why is my eye burning?

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:54.600
That's not what I fucking pressed!

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.600
No!

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:07.600
Actually...

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.600
Yeah, whatever.

02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:21.600
It doesn't have any, like, mouse sensitivity.

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.600
Oh, turn that off.

02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.600
Everything's off!

02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.600
What?

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.600
Oh, my fucking god.

02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.600
It took the mouse right thing as, like...

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:52.600
I can't move my fucking camera, even though I didn't press mouse right.

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:56.600
Shell spell on C?

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:00.600
I really want some crab legs now.

02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.600
Please, for the love of god, let me move down.

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:20.600
Oh.

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.600
What?

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.600
Just because I moved my mouse to the...

02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.600
Jesus.

02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:38.600
What is m-

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:41.600
What?

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.600
What?

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:50.600
Game is weird.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:57.600
Okay.

02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.600
Let me just...

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:10.600
I put...

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.600
I don't like using keyboard in a game like this,

02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:18.600
because I literally... it takes me forever to, like, get the...

02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.600
bindings I want.

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:24.600
Why is that?

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:26.600
It was using this as a sprint.

02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:38.600
Okay.

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.600
Okay, whatever.

02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:48.600
You guys, you guys hang in there?

02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:51.600
Do you have a controller plugged into a USB header,

02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:53.600
in the case of the motherboard?

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:55.600
It's on the motherboard,

02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:57.600
and it's USB-C it's plugged into,

02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:59.600
so that's why I'm like, what the fuck?

02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:04.600
Ooh, give me that.

02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:19.600
You know what I should have done? I should have leveled up.

02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:26.600
Can I go back to that moonshell?

02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:34.600
You guys are chilling? You're dead? I'm so sorry.

02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:36.600
No loss.

02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:38.600
No loss there.

02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:41.600
No one will miss you.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:47.600
Okay.

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:53.600
PC of Bluetooth.

02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:55.600
I don't think it does.

02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:59.600
I feel like even if it was Bluetooth, it wouldn't make a difference.

02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:17.600
If I...

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:24.600
If I...

02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:33.600
So I have to go to the lady to do my skill tree?

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.600
Yes, for sure.

02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.600
Hello.

02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:44.600
I don't think a spirit could type,

02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:47.600
but well, maybe if it's a talented spirit.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:54.600
You have steam input enabled?

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:57.600
I don't know.

02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:04.600
I don't know where that setting would be.

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:08.600
I usually... I've never had that enabled that I know of.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:10.600
I don't need to talk to you, I just need to...

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:13.600
Do I need to talk to you to upgrade stuff?

02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:16.600
Am I just going here to do that?

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:22.600
No?

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:25.600
Okay, I guess I have to talk to you.

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:29.600
I guess you're the Sophia in this game.

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:40.600
Oh!

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:44.600
Cool.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:50.600
That's pretty smart.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:57.600
Fashion night in?

02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:10.600
Hmm, these are all really good skills to use.

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:13.600
Yeah.

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:19.600
That's cool, actually.

02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:25.600
I think I might do the free...

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.600
Actually, I'll do that, yeah.

02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:34.600
I hate playing on keyboard, though.

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.600
Phew.

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:40.600
You have the same utility disabled it?

02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:42.600
Oh.

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.600
Pushing to Bluetooth, which I helped you.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.600
Where is this... where is steam input?

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:50.600
Where would that setting be?

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.600
Sorry, I'm stupid.

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:53.600
Sorry, I'm blonde.

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.600
Where would this be input setting be?

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.600
Hmm.

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.600
Oh, shit, I just realized what time it was.

02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.600
I am gonna end it here for now.

02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:34.600
I think Amy's on doing stuff.

02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:37.600
Let me save.

02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:46.600
I don't know if I'm gonna keep playing this game.

02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:52.600
The whole thing with the controls is kind of irritating.

02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.600
But if you guys really want me to continue...

02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:03.600
Oh, yeah, she's designing a 2.0 outfit or something.

02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.600
And then...

02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.600
Bye, big sis.

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:13.600
Yeah, I'm gonna send you to little sis.

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.600
I was just starting to enjoy this.

02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:24.600
Damn.

02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:26.600
If you guys really want me to continue it, I will.

02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:31.600
It's like clamoring for it.

02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:33.600
Maybe I will.

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:34.600
I don't know.

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:36.600
I probably won't play it next week, maybe the week after.

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:39.600
I like the game.

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.600
Again, I don't like being irritated and frustrated with the game's mechanics on stream.

02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:48.600
Maybe a gun run?

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.600
No, that'd be too fucking easy.

02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:54.600
I don't want to make it easy.

02:11:54.600 --> 02:12:01.600
I'm generally mad that I killed the Duchess in one shot.

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:07.600
I thought it would take at least two, three, or four or five shots.

02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:11.600
I feel like such a fucking dirty cheater.

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.600
I'm mad at myself.

02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:24.600
Just like when the weird bug that the first boss you fight just disappeared on me and didn't show back up.

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:27.600
And everybody treated it like I killed it.

02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.600
But I'm like, he just leapt.

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.600
He didn't want to talk to me anymore.

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:34.600
What the fuck is on my arm?

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:41.600
Yeah, the controls are rushing.

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:43.600
That's the most anticlimactic.

02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:44.600
What do you think that happened?

02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:45.600
I know.

02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:46.600
I'm like, okay.

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:48.600
I was like righty coming up with another strat.

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:52.600
I'm like, okay, I just got to like bring him in a circle, be able to jump in a can for a shell.

02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:54.600
And then he just never showed up.

02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.600
He never showed up for the fight.

02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:59.600
I fear you're a maiden list.

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.600
I don't have any sort of maiden list behavior.

02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.600
Downloading.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:07.600
I'm lost to my phone right now.

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:08.600
Also hi, hi.

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.600
Yeah, going on and off.

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:15.600
Like, yeah, I might play this a little bit on the side.

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:17.600
I have Sekiro.

02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:18.600
Heroes die twice.

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:19.600
So maybe I'll play that.

02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:22.600
I'm trying to think of some games to play for next week.

02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:26.600
I'm thinking about doing some collabs next week.

02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:27.600
It's frustrating.

02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:33.600
I have to miss out on a possible collab with the girls next week because I have to work at my normal job again.

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:36.600
Sekiro, yeah, I only got.

02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:40.600
So Sekiro was the first friend like Soulslight game I ever played.

02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:43.600
And I didn't know what Soulslikes were like.

02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:45.600
I didn't know it was a Soulslight.

02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:48.600
I didn't, I didn't, I never had played Dark Souls or anything.

02:13:49.600 --> 02:14:02.600
And I remember, like, I never got past the first boss, like the first duty fight, because I was, I was just getting so pissed and angry.

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:03.600
I'm like.

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:07.600
Thank you, Mama.

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:12.600
I'm glad you liked it. It was kind of funny.

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.600
I can't, I want a clip of that.

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.600
Just like of me getting the gun and being like, wait, let's see how this works.

02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:21.600
And just fucking one shot.

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:23.600
It's good.

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:26.600
Play Dark Souls too.

02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:27.600
Yeah.

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:29.600
Yeah, let me know what, like, I also have Liza P.

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.600
I wouldn't mind playing through Liza P again.

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:33.600
On stream.

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.600
That's a game I really enjoyed.

02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:41.600
Yeah.

02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.600
Curl becoming an American moment.

02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:50.600
I wish there was like dialogue, though, like when you added that, like when you got, when you got the gun.

02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:54.600
I wish you would like, say something.

02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:58.600
Like, really, really, like, really awkwardly political.

02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:05.600
Like, they may get my taxes, but they'll never take my gun right away.

02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:07.600
There's some shit like that.

02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:08.600
Play Doom.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.600
The new Doom game that's coming out looks good.

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:13.600
I, like, I, I was like, holy shit, that looks good.

02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.600
I haven't, I've never played Doom.

02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.600
I've never played Doom.

02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:18.600
I've never played Doom.

02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:19.600
I've never played Doom.

02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:21.600
I've never played Doom.

02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:23.600
I was like, holy shit, that looks good.

02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:24.600
I have, I've never played Doom.

02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:25.600
I'll be honest with you.

02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:26.600
I've never played a Doom game.

02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:28.600
I've always wanted to play a Doom game.

02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:31.600
My dad, I think, played the OG Doom game.

02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:38.600
I've watched people play Doom, and I do like, shoot him up.

02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:42.600
This should make us be gonna make sure we text an accent.

02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:43.600
Yeah.

02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.600
Peak America is Texas.

02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.600
Can't wait for that state to just secede from our country and become the country of Texas.

02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:52.600
Or something.

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:57.600
I don't care who the IRS is saying, I'm not paying my taxes.

02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:59.600
It's fucking WAPOW.

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:01.600
Shoot some.

02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:03.600
Hell yeah, brother.

02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.600
Okay, let me make sure my redirect's good, and I'll send you on over to Sweet Emmy.

02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:16.600
Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom.

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:17.600
Yay.

02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.600
Okay, that is cool.

02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:23.600
Designing group 2.0.

02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:29.600
I love how the thumbnail is Twilight Sparkle yelling at something.

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:40.600
I might be, I'm cooking something behind the scenes for my 2.0.

02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:44.600
Actually, it's not even a 2.0, it's more of a 1.5.

02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:51.600
But that won't be for until maybe next year.

02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:59.600
No, maybe it'll be a 2.5 if I get a 2.0 by like the end of the year.

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:01.600
I don't know.

02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:02.600
Who knows?

02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:04.600
I do like this model.

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:07.600
I mostly just want more toggles.

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:14.600
And I was telling Azura pointed out that we actually are missing a vowel when we talk.

02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:22.600
Which is, because you got A, E, I, O, U, but U doesn't work.

02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:26.600
So I do U, U, U, my mouth isn't open.

02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:29.600
So it's weird.

02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:34.600
Yeah, Nari did a great job rigging.

02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:38.600
Yeah.

02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:43.600
Gould did a great job designing.

02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:49.600
Well, thank you for the tips guys.

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:55.600
I hope you have a great rest of your day or night and hanging out with Emmy.

02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:03.600
I also hope you suck a dick because, you know, you're trash and all, so.

02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:06.600
It's all that trash is good for.

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:08.600
Sucking peepie.

02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:10.600
Lots of love.

02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:11.600
XOXO.

02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:13.600
Madam Sheeby.

02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:40.600
You guys still smell bad though.

02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:42.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:43.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:44.600

02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:45.600

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:46.600

02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:47.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:48.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:49.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:50.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:51.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:52.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:53.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:54.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:55.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:56.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:57.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:57.600 --> 02:18:58.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:58.600 --> 02:18:59.600
I'm sorry.

02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:00.600
I'm sorry.

02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:01.600
I'm sorry.

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:02.600
I'm sorry.

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:03.600
I'm sorry.

02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:04.600
I'm sorry.

02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:05.600
I'm sorry.

02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:06.600
I'm sorry.

02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:07.600
I'm sorry.
