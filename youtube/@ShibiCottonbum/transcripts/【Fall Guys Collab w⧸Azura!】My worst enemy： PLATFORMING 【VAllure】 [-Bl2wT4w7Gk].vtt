12:36.060 --> 12:37.560

12:48.840 --> 12:50.320
It's like a lot of fun.

12:50.320 --> 12:50.820
Ah!

12:54.520 --> 12:56.040
Sib is dead.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.040
No!

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
I'm dead?

12:59.040 --> 13:06.240
It was just the screaming you did, and then the boom.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.240
I just go quiet.

13:07.240 --> 13:07.740
Ah!

13:07.740 --> 13:18.240
Ah!

13:18.240 --> 13:24.420
OK, I'm going to say 25 people will try to get in.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.340
That's the goal.

13:26.340 --> 13:30.580
A lot of some people said they were downloading the game now

13:30.580 --> 13:31.420
in my chat.

13:31.420 --> 13:32.140
Oh, OK.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.860
Then, yeah, we'll do more than that then.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.540
Maybe pin the message for the code.

13:36.540 --> 13:44.380
I was thinking that, but once we start, yeah, it's going to get

13:44.380 --> 13:45.260
to work in.

13:45.260 --> 13:49.540
Like nobody's going to be able to get in for like a long.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.460
Can you even join when?

13:51.460 --> 13:54.740
Can you join while a game is already in motion?

13:54.740 --> 13:55.500
Let's try it.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.900
Is that possible?

13:56.900 --> 13:59.540
Maybe you can join and queue up in a lobby later.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.540
Download!

14:02.540 --> 14:03.860
Where did I even drop?

14:03.860 --> 14:16.060
Download for guys now and play with us.

14:16.060 --> 14:19.260
It's all in caps.

14:19.260 --> 14:28.020
Five and I can't see the.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.500
Just copy, paste it.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.500
Can you?

14:31.500 --> 14:33.500
I don't think you can.

14:33.500 --> 14:40.500
I just copied and pasted it from when you messaged me the code.

14:40.500 --> 14:44.500
Oh, my brain.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.500
Oh, my God.

14:47.500 --> 14:51.500
Is there a longer than me sometimes?

14:51.500 --> 14:58.500
I like that it compresses your screams and you just get real quiet.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.500
Well, I can help you fix that.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.500
I fixed mine.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.500
No, I meant in our call.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.500
Yeah, I can help you fix that.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
It's mine.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.500
It used to, and it was very annoying.

15:12.500 --> 15:17.500
Wait, I have all the settings trying that for that off.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.500
No, I think it's a different kind of setting that you could actually fix.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.500
I think I know which one you're talking about.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
What is it?

15:24.500 --> 15:26.500
It's, it's either your.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.500
Oh, my God.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.500
The words left me.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.500
Window settings.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.500
Window settings.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.500
Yes.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
Yeah.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.500
Oh.

15:39.500 --> 15:44.500
How do you pin messages?

15:44.500 --> 15:47.500
You press the three dots and click pin message.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
Just hover to the right of it.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
Okay.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
I'm in system settings.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.500
System window settings.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
Mother guide me.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.500
Oh God.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.500
I was unprepared.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.500
It's under sound.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.500
Yeah.

16:03.500 --> 16:07.500
Well, you got a, you know, the little gear thingy on this,

16:07.500 --> 16:11.500
on the bottom right of your, like on the, the task manager.

16:11.500 --> 16:15.500
And the thing that looks like a, like a volume, like the sound button

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
thingy.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.500
Oh, is it in the sound mixer?

16:18.500 --> 16:19.500
Yeah.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.500
Yeah.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.500
Yes.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
Not mixer.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
The other one.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
Oh, I think I know what you're talking about.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.500
Found it.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.500
It's like a whole thing though.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.500
So maybe you might have to.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.500
Yeah.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.500
You got to advance and then you have to make sure that everything is at 100.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.500
And then you have to go back to your focus.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
Right.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.500
Then you've got to turn yourself down.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.500
Turn it.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
Turn it.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.500
I'm not doing all that.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
That's too much work.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
Yeah.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.500
Like you should probably do it later.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.500
I know we're waiting for people, but like that, that's, that's too much work.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.500
And I didn't do it all day.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.500
It took me forever.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
It took me how many days?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
Like a couple of days to get it right.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.500
Yeah.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.500
It took a couple of days.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
I can't, I couldn't.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.500
Oh, okay.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
Yeah.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
Yeah.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.500
Yeah.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.500
Yeah.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
Yeah.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.500
Yeah.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.500
Yeah.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.500
Yeah.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.500
Yeah.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.500
Yeah.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.500
Yeah.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.500
Yeah.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
Yeah.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.500
Yeah.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.500
Yeah.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.500
Just like that.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.500
I just just, I can, I couldn't, uh-oh, uh-oh.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.500
What did you do?

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500
It's fine.

17:24.500 --> 17:28.500
How did you bring a microphone?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
What's happening?

17:30.500 --> 17:35.500
This deserve need to be turned up.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.500
Anybody a sound good on my end?

let me let me move this fan over here french made chibi oh that'd be a good asmr actually

26:11.580 --> 26:14.540
i'm i'm i'm stuck around the back of my head

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
i

26:27.660 --> 26:32.780
did you get hit with copyright because you sing yeah just just random songs

26:34.860 --> 26:39.020
they're not even of the like the people that actually do copyright the song that don't belong

26:39.100 --> 26:43.100
to those people it's fake i know that's so dumb

26:44.140 --> 26:49.820
jesus i i used to i would also sing a lot like when i streamed on twitch i don't know i said

26:49.820 --> 26:51.820
twitch like i'm

26:58.380 --> 27:04.860
yeah i sung like a lot on twitch my favorite thing to do and i would play music too oh my god i'm

27:04.860 --> 27:11.420
gonna do your mod job for them but the thing on twitch is that you could uh what is it what do

27:11.420 --> 27:18.380
you do uh you could separate the audio like the complete audio so that when you should go live

27:18.380 --> 27:26.380
on twitch they can't hear uh the music at all but they can hear the music when you're live

27:26.380 --> 27:33.020
but it doesn't stay in the vod so the vod doesn't get muted yeah yeah the whole freaking vod gets

27:33.020 --> 27:39.980
muted yeah so i can't do that on youtube are you allowed to join yes you're allowed to join you

27:39.980 --> 27:55.500
think we just have 42 friends with us so i'm not used to uh not singing

27:55.980 --> 28:05.740
um i gotta use for me i kept demonetized um because of because of my boobs so

28:07.260 --> 28:13.740
and lily i just smacked so much like stronti was showing me her um monetization versus mine

28:14.300 --> 28:18.940
and i was just like holy i was like ineligible ineligible ineligible copyright ineligible

28:20.060 --> 28:24.380
limited ads limited ads limited and i was like but then i changed thumbnails and stuff

28:25.100 --> 28:28.300
and i um i appealed a bunch and thankfully i was able to

28:30.060 --> 28:35.900
i wonder if i'll get i wonder if i'll get hit with that after probably yeah like you've been

28:35.900 --> 28:39.580
doing the right thing with the the bread you have to cover your whole boob crack

28:41.500 --> 28:47.740
i mean if i you i change it to the bobo tea you change it to bobo tea oh that's funny i have i

28:47.740 --> 28:55.820
just have the sign in front of my boobs and then you um yeah because it like it did make a difference

28:55.820 --> 29:01.580
if i didn't cover it all the way if the boob boob thing was still there but hey i think we'll be

29:01.580 --> 29:09.580
getting cover-ups anyways so very soon i cannot wait i know yay i can button my shirt and maybe i

29:09.580 --> 29:18.780
can pop a button that'd be cool cool toggle oh i thought you just love bread yeah she loves

29:18.780 --> 29:25.020
bread so much she's stuck it in between her boobs i love bread really man it's the best thing that's

29:25.020 --> 29:33.580
why i chose it i need uh my son to cut out a picture of the harem um so i could stick it on

29:33.660 --> 29:37.420
my boobs just have you guys just wedged in between as a cover-up

29:39.020 --> 29:46.380
it's just funny how much the algorithm has changed because like evident by azura's song covering

29:46.380 --> 29:53.900
pewdie pie uh boobs in the thumbnail that used to be such a main like thing like you everybody

29:53.900 --> 30:02.780
i struggled so hard singing that song really i had to do so many retakes because i could not

30:02.780 --> 30:09.420
stop laughing like i would say i would laugh i would sing it i would laugh and it ended with

30:09.420 --> 30:16.300
me having to sing monotone because if i didn't sing monotone i would laugh i know like people

30:16.300 --> 30:20.220
were like why do you sound like you're singing because you're trying not to wake up your parents

30:20.220 --> 30:25.260
i'm like because i yeah i also couldn't take it seriously and i'm not a good singer so

30:25.260 --> 30:37.100
so that's why i'm like and it's so hard to match up it's a hard to match a pitch of someone who

30:37.100 --> 30:44.540
also can't sing yeah that's the like yeah pretty can't sing right william johnson can't sing like i

30:44.540 --> 30:48.940
can cover i could probably like the next song i'm probably gonna cover is like stacey's mom

30:48.940 --> 30:57.660
which i'll be able to sing because there's actual flow and yeah in most of the lines that that were

30:57.660 --> 31:06.060
put in the song it's literally a few words mashed mashed together and i have a list so pewdie pie's

31:06.060 --> 31:13.660
accent and my list did not mesh well i thought it really was good though i thought yours yours and

31:13.660 --> 31:18.700
strongies were actually i like all of her things like i did a lot takes for mine and i was going

31:18.700 --> 31:26.700
insane listening to the song over and over and over again um and then yeah i was i didn't even

31:27.340 --> 31:31.180
like sent me the edited version i'm like yeah great because i was i'm like it's probably

31:31.180 --> 31:35.980
cringey as hell i'm not listening to this i don't want to hear myself

31:36.780 --> 31:44.540
um it was fun though a really fun experience yeah i like because of that i now i know what's

31:44.540 --> 31:51.420
involved i really want to try harder and do a better cover you want to do what with me

31:52.380 --> 32:00.300
what song i don't know that'd be cool though i don't know what i don't know what we could do

32:01.020 --> 32:05.580
can you have a bunch of songs already on list that i want to do for covers

32:05.580 --> 32:13.260
okay i have a big list yeah a little bit yeah a little bit i'm like i'm trying to think

32:14.940 --> 32:18.620
a little bit it can't be like hard rap like like extremely like

32:18.940 --> 32:25.180
i'm not i'm not i don't want to

32:31.820 --> 32:36.220
well what song would you think um you sounded like you didn't want to be there

32:37.820 --> 32:45.900
what's my song what song would you guys want us to cover little john we just do yeah

32:49.580 --> 32:51.420
a little john is on the venue

32:54.780 --> 32:57.580
in the club with my homies and then it's just

33:02.940 --> 33:03.420
shots

33:04.300 --> 33:04.700
yeah

33:13.260 --> 33:19.180
i think it would be cool if we um did like an english cover of like i was like

33:20.540 --> 33:26.300
like it's ears even singing i was like uh actually no i feel like i feel like k-pop

33:26.300 --> 33:32.540
girlies will come for us because i was gonna say a k-pop song um i think because just because

33:32.780 --> 33:38.300

33:39.420 --> 33:43.820

I got toast. I got some peanut butter and Nutella toast.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.840
Usually I put some banana on it, but I don't have any banana.

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:18.840
I kept hearing about how people see her as mommy and all, but one of the first strings.

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:21.840
I went a person involved or being concerned about our new toaster.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.840
Yes, Azur is cute as fuck.

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.840
All the girls have quite a bit of Gatbo.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.840
Moe, sorry.

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.840
Nutella? Yeah, it's like a hazelnut spread.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:55.840
Yeah, she's a cutesy, caring type, and then I'm the Sundari type.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:08.840
Sundari, but you actually hate us. I don't hate you guys.

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.840
Don't say that.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.840
Maybe. I don't know.

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.840
I just think about it.

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.840
Sundari, but you actually beat us to death.

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.840
Yes, let me beat the shit out of you.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.840
Azur has got Meow.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.840

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.840

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.840
Oh, that was good.

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.840
Hate us affectionately.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.840
Yeah, I gotta keep you guessing, guys.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:04.840
I'm gonna sacrifice myself so Azur gets to the final round.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.840
I don't know what she's getting as a snack.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.840
I feel like she's getting some sort of fruit or crackers.

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:34.840
Or toast. She just burns her toast.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.840
Eating animation under her mouth. It's actually just my mouth tracking.

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:58.840
I promise you, I don't chew with my mouth open, but like the model tracking picks it up as I'm just like being like.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.840
I'm making rice ball.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.840
You're making a rice ball?

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.840
Yeah.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.840
That's not a snack. That's a whole ass rice ball.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.840
How are you making it?

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.840
With salt?

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:45.840
No, but like rice balls are different in different places, but like what type of rice ball are you making?

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:52.840
I was like, for me, a rice ball, I think of Italian rice balls, but you're probably doing like a Japanese rice ball.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.840
Most likely Japanese, just how I do a rice ball.

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:01.840
Yeah, but I don't have anything to put in it.

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.840
So you're literally just eating a ball of rice.

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.840
Yeah.

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.840
I try to look for something to put in it and I like set it up to put something in it.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.840
And then I was like, I am, let me put something in it and then I don't have anything.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:21.840
I could have put tuna in it, but then I would have to go get it.

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:22.840
Yeah.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:29.840
I was going to say like, oh, do you have any tuna, like canned tuna and put some mayo in it or something.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.840
Rice ball filled with air.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.840
No, no cheese.

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:38.840
No meat.

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.840
My fridge is so empty.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.840
So does mine.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:50.840
I desperately need to go grocery shopping, but I'm just way too lazy.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.840
Same.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.840
Too much of an effort to get ready just to go to the grocery store.

01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:58.840
Oh my God.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.840
That's very relatable.

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.840
Let me go wash my hands.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.840
I did this without a glove.

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:07.840
Gasp.

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.840
She wouldn't wrong.

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.840
Oh.

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:25.840
Reminds me of this one Chinese mythology I learned.

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.840
Basically the lead girl was supposed to slay a dragon.

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:28.840
She set up rice balls.

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.840
So dragon would be like, dude, snacks.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.840
Rice is the best snack.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:36.840
All right.

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.840
I don't, I think, I think I have some like Jasmine rice.

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:49.840
I'm chewing.

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:00.840
No glove.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:01.840
Extra love.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.840
Yeah, I love biryani rice.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.840
Oh no.

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.840
I broke this.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:11.840
Oh no.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.840
That's not good.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:19.840
My salt, the opening of my salt, it can only open one way.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.840
It's completely broken.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:23.840
How does that happen?

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.840
I don't know.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:26.840
I think I stepped on it.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.840
How did you step on it?

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:30.840
I don't know.

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:32.840
I'm lazy and I never put things back on the top of my fridge

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:35.840
and they end up on the floor.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.840
Damn, bitch.

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:39.840
You live like this.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.840
I literally have my toaster on the floor.

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:46.840
Why is your toaster on the floor?

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:49.840
I have nowhere to put it.

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:51.840
I have nowhere to put it.

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.840
You don't have an outer.

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.840
We'll put it on.

01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:05.840
Do you need to clean off your counter?

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:14.840
If anyone can see how cluttered my room looks, you'd be appalled.

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.840
I can't even look at my TV.

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:18.840
There's like things in front of it blocking it.

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:21.840
Things hanging off of the TV.

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.840
It's a little bit better but the little bit of clutter that's at my house,

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:31.840
I mostly picked up yesterday.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.840
Squalor core, mama.

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.840
I literally just called you squalor core.

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:46.840
As there is a true knee, 100%.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.840
It's true.

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.840
Want to hear my bag of bottles?

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:53.840
Please.

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:54.840
Kikimori azu.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:56.840
Kikimori knee azu.

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:57.840
Can you hear that?

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:58.840
Can you hear this?

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:07.840
Do it again?

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.840
Do you just have a bag of piss bottles?

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:14.840
What? No!

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.840
Someone asked, do you have a piss drawer?

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:20.840
No.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.840
Pretty sure Emmy has a piss drawer.

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:33.840
I wouldn't be surprised.

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:36.840
Yeah, your chat is not used to me.

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.840
They're just like, what?

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.840
Yeah, I'm used to this.

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:41.840
Don't worry.

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.840
I'm unfazed.

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:49.840
I don't want to hear these allegations.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:50.840
Okay.

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.840
I told you guys, literally, there aren't debuts.

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:57.840
Did I not say that because the outrageous thing?

01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:58.840
I'm sorry.

01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.840
I'm just blunt.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.840
I said it in my debut.

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.840
You were warned.

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:11.840
You were warned.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.840
I became used to it.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.840
The girls have been desensitized.

01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:18.840
You should see our group chat.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.840
We have a memes channel.

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:25.840
Although, is there going to be sending some very interesting memes in our memes channel?

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:33.840
I'm just going to say that.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.840
Don't out me.

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.840
Don't expose me.

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.840
Don't expose me like that.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.840
Should we increase the shot quality?

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.840
Okay.

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.840
Hold on.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:51.840
I have to think of something inflammatory to say.

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.840
Bush did nine.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.840
No.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:59.840
This is a miss.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:00.840
See me.

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:01.840
See me.

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.840
See me.

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.840
What the fuck?

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.840
I don't know.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.840
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:11.840
Everything's fine.

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:23.840
If you don't know me, if you are unused to me, my content and how I roll, just watch

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:30.840
either my bunny garden play through or my class of 09 play through the first one.

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:40.840
Because those got demonetized for reasons, but they were so worth it.

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:50.840
I don't understand how you got monetized before me.

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:51.840
I don't either.

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.840
I don't either.

01:48:53.840 --> 01:49:01.840
I don't think YouTube likes brown people.

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:30.840
I mean, for those who don't know, I am brown.

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:31.840
I am brown.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:32.840
I am brown.

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:33.840
I am brown.

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:34.840

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:35.840
I am brown.

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:36.840
I am brown.

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840
I am brown.

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.840
I am brown.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.840
I am brown.

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.840
I am brown.

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.840
I am brown.

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:42.840
I am brown.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.840
I am brown.

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.840
I am brown.

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:45.840
I am brown.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:46.840
I am brown.

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.840
I am brown.

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.840
I am brown.

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:49.840
I am brown.

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:50.840
I am brown.

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:51.840
I am brown.

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:52.840
I am brown.

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:53.840
I am brown.

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:54.840
I am brown.

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:55.840
I am brown.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.840
I am brown.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:57.840
I am brown.

01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:58.840
I am brown.

01:49:58.840 --> 01:49:59.840
I am brown.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:00.840
I am brown.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.840
I am brown.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.840
I am brown.

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:03.840
I am brown.

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:04.840
I am brown.

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.840
I am brown.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.840
I am brown.

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:07.840
I am brown.

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:08.840
I am brown.

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:09.840
I am brown.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:10.840
I am brown.

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.840

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.840

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.840
I am brown.

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.840
My birthday.

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.840
My family.

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:51.840
My family is brown.

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:52.840

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:14.480

oh fuck yeah okay perfect sounds like so confused I would not suppose no

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:43.320

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:54.000
it up over a couple days true so shit yeah so I think but I think but I think

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.200
we're kind of known for like we do a lot of endurance stuff like between me

01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:03.280
actually everybody I think has done like at least one endurance stream I think I'm

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:10.840
not quite sure yeah I don't even know what I want to do for my donathon I have

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:16.120

01:57:52.760 --> 01:58:13.280
take a break before the next one yeah I'm sorry I totally misheard I was like

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:22.680
imagine like a Zura dressed as like a beautiful 1920s flapper with one of

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:28.040
those cool cigarette holders in her mouth and she's like hey doll you want to

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:32.560

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:35.600
something else entirely oh are you

01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:54.880
I'm like laughing behind you I was just like oh sultry cigarettes after

01:58:54.880 --> 01:59:16.720

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:35.240
struggling to breathe the dank grass oh why I got it I understand now I get it

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:34.400
the saw like pizza like I think a pizza like you want to grab a slice of

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:44.920
I can't tell if she's getting she's not so far away like she ran across the room to

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:54.280
cry she be here's blinker and think what's what the fuck is a blinker I'm

02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:02.320
thinking about cars what I don't they call it what is that like I've never heard

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:14.320
of that I've never heard that called that when you hit a bit for long enough in

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:20.440
the light starts playing oh because I like I have friends that smoke vapes and

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:33.080
stuff I didn't know that was a thing I'm wait till you know I'm very I'll expose

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:39.760
myself more right now I'm I'm a part of me was very thankful that nobody recalled

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:47.400
in my past life that I sat during a stream for about an hour debating male

02:01:47.400 --> 02:02:00.720
anatomy with my viewers because I thought I thought the little the little you

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:10.080
know beans in the sack were on like behind your legs and and that's why you

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:16.640
had to like man's and I remember just like complaining cuz I'm just like men's

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.960
anatomy is so weird cuz it's like why is it on the front like that and I thought it

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:26.480
was cuz I'm thinking about like in terms of like the distance of like a woman's

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:32.400
stuff and a man's stuff I'm like is it okay is the ball in between the leg like

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:39.560
and and so I remember I was drawing my example for people and they were just like

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:47.080
kind of doing what's happening now and I was and I don't know why I thought that

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:53.920
cuz it's not like I don't like I don't watch stuff so I'm just like you know I

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:55.920
was gonna stop talking

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.560
you need to look at the draw it again

02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:18.400
guys she tryking it

02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:20.400
I got to see this.

02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:22.400
Hold on, hold on, I got you.

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.400
I'll show you what I mean.

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:30.400
I mean, I need to see this.

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:38.400
Let's people forget I grew up in a very religious Christian hospital.

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:44.400
Oh, I'm sweating so bad.

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.400
How about sex ed when I was a lot younger?

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.400
I didn't really remember a lot, but I thought so.

02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:52.400
Wait, they actually taught you?

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:54.400
Like they actually taught you?

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:58.400
I thought like you were like in a religious household where like they like kept you away from it.

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:02.400
Because no, my mom, my parents were like, we don't want you getting molested.

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:06.400
So like here's some information.

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.400
And they're like, if somebody asks you to do this, don't do it.

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.400
I don't even remember my sex ed class in high school.

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:14.400
Like I'll be honest with you.

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:20.400
I think I might have like blanked that out for my own mental health and safety.

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.400
Yeah, pretty decent parents telling you that early age.

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:26.400
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:34.400
Being a girl and an only child, they didn't want me to get like diddle by someone in church or whatever.

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:38.400
Damn, every time she hits me with these like terms, it really shocks me.

02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:46.400
So this is the head of the dude and he's just hanging out.

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.400
And then I'm going to do this from the side.

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.400
So I'm going to, this is his leg.

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.400
Wait, we can't see it.

02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:56.400
We can't see it.

02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:58.400
What do you mean you can't see it?

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.400
We can't see it.

02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.400
Oh wait, I'm delayed in a month.

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.400
Don't worry about me.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:10.400
I kind of made his legs too thick, but don't worry about it.

02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:16.400
I thought like this is the butt and let me get this one.

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.400
How do I make this bigger?

02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:22.400
Damn, look at that cake.

02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:24.400
I know, he's kind of, he's caked up.

02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:26.400
He's caked up.

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:30.400
So I thought like a guy's stuff was over here.

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:32.400
Like that's where the peepee is.

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:36.400
And then this is where the balls are because they're like in between the legs.

02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:42.400
But then come to find out, they're actually like weirdly at the front.

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:48.400
And I just think that's stupid because as a woman, you know, you have like,

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:52.400
there's like too much space between the asshole and the balls.

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:54.400
I just think it's dumb.

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:58.400
Whereas as a woman, your stuff is just like down here all chilling and then you got your asshole.

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:02.400
You know, don't you want to pinch it?

02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:08.400
Like the space between a man's asshole and his balls?

02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.400
Yeah.

02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:12.400
Is there a what?

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:14.400
You want to pinch it?

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.400
I've heard it's called the Gooch.

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:18.400
Yes, the Gooch existence.

02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.400
I think it's stupid.

02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:22.400
I don't like that anatomy.

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:24.400
I feel like their stuff should be a little bit different.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:26.400
But yeah, the women's stuff is there.

02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:30.400
Like, I feel like I could just pop this off and just be like,

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:32.400
I'll make you a Kendall.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:34.400
And then your asshole is all the way over here.

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:36.400
Like, I don't understand it. It's stupid.

02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.400
Like, what? There's too much space.

02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.400
There's too much distance.

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:46.400
I think the reason why the tack is on the front like that,

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.400
because it's the root of where it grew.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.400
What?

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:58.400
I thought that prostate was like inside.

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:00.400
Yeah, isn't that inside?

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.400
Yeah, the prostate is inside.

02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.400
Yeah, that's like you got the booty hole and then it's like,

02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:06.400
well, like right above it.

02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:10.400
Because the man's spot is literally in the booty hole.

02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.400
Yeah. And then I know like,

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.400
I also get there with like sounding and stuff,

02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:18.400
which is terrifying, by the way.

02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.400
P is stored in the balls.

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.400
That's true.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:24.400
You know, I remember when I was younger, mind you, again,

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.400
I was like probably like five when my parents taught me

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:29.400
about like how to make sure that I'm not being taken advantage of.

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:32.400
So I don't remember a lot because they bought me like a whole ass anatomy book.

02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:34.400
And they also got me a little book.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:38.400
I think it's called The Caring Keeping of You,

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:42.400
which was really cool for like girls who were going through puberty.

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:46.400
But like I also, it took me a while to figure out where my P-hole was

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.400
because I thought I peed out of my clit for the longest time.

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.400
But I discovered that wasn't the case.

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.400
Are you serious?

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.400
Damn.

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.400
I have to have a mirror.

02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:00.400
Was I just that exploratory when I was younger?

02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:02.400
I knew all of this from the get.

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.400
What do you mean Vod's cooked? Vod's fine.

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.400
This is educational purposes.

02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:12.400
Educational purposes.

02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:14.400
Educational purposes.

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.400
Precisely.

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:20.400
I'm getting educated.

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.400
Well, I've been educated.

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:24.400
But like this was probably a couple months ago.

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:28.400
What just happened? Excuse me.

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.400
I think I was just very exploratory.

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.400
Just overall with anatomy as a whole.

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:39.400
So it was very, very, very young.

02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:41.400
But it's funny because like I would draw and stuff,

02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:43.400
but I didn't draw like that stuff.

02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:45.400
And then like I would read like,

02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.400
yeah.

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.400
And like watch stuff.

02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.400
Like a little Fuji.

02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:53.400
There's no way that you watch.

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:55.400
Yeah.

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.400
And didn't understand the anatomy of the boob.

02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.400
It was, I think it was like object permanence.

02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.400
I don't know.

02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.400
Like I just thought it like moves around more often,

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:09.400
but it's really just tacked to the front.

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:11.400
And I thought you could like tuck it.

02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:13.400
Like that's why I'm like, oh guys can tuck

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.400
and I don't want to like show how much they're packing.

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:17.400
You know?

02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:19.400
You know?

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:21.400
Am I just embarrassing myself?

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:23.400
Why am I in the horror corpo?

02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:25.400
I don't know if it was out of me.

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:31.400
I was curious since day one.

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:33.400
I really thought that when they showed you the,

02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:37.400
the, the, the, the, you know, the sake wacky.

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.400
Can I call it a sake wack?

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:41.400
The wacky to back.

02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.400
When they showed you it in the pictures,

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.400
I always thought it was like an egg.

02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:47.400
Yeah.

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:49.400
So I was very curious.

02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:51.400
And, and like, because of like,

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.400
because like there's stuff is on the inside.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:55.400
I thought it was like,

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.400
I didn't know that it was like holding stuff on the inside.

02:09:57.400 --> 02:09:59.400
I thought it was like the organ itself.

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.400
Like I didn't like the sack is holding the testes.

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:03.400
I just thought it was like,

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:05.400
it was the testes just covered in skin.

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.400
Don't crack it.

02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:09.400
Everybody is terrified of you cracking the nuts.

02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:11.400
Oh, he cracked the nuts.

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:13.400
Yeah.

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:15.400
Yeah.

02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.400
I always thought it was, I always thought you like,

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:19.400
it would actually crack.

02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:21.400
Like when I was younger, I was like,

02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:23.400
Oh, does it really hurt?

02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:25.400
I accidentally kicked someone like a long time ago.

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.400
It was an accident.

02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:29.400
Like for real.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.400
I didn't do it on purpose.

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.400
Thank you.

02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:35.400
Believe me.

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:37.400
Believe me.

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.400
Believe me.

02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:41.400
I remember when I was younger,

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:43.400
I was playing tag with friends and at recess,

02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.400
aka I don't know if any European friends don't eat recesses,

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.400
but just like a break time

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.400
from after lunch and stuff.

02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.400
And we were playing tag and this one kid

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.400
jumped off of a

02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.400
we had like these like benches

02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:57.400
and he jumped off of it and I went

02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.400
to go

02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:01.400
tag him and I ended up punching him in the nuts

02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:03.400
as he jumped off

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:05.400
and he just started crying

02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.400
and I being a girl

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.400
called him a little bitch

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:11.400
because I'm like, why the fuck do you crack?

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.400
I've taken

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:15.400
shots of the pussy, you know.

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.400
There's no way.

02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:19.400
There's no way because I remember

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.400
when I was younger, I fell.

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.400
You know those old wooden beds?

02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:25.400
Oh, yeah.

02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:27.400
I fell on one.

02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:29.400
I fell on the headboard.

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:31.400
I was fucking with it

02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:33.400
and I was like a badass child when I was little.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.400
I was like running around jumping

02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:37.400
on the bed and like on the board and like

02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.400
do a flips and shit and then I flipped.

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.400
I slipped and I felt

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.400
in between on the bed and right in between my legs.

02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.400
No, that shit hurt.

02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:47.400
Like I'm like, I thought

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:49.400
I broke bone. I thought I cracked bone.

02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:51.400
Does that mean my pussy can take more of a powder than yours?

02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:53.400
I don't know, bro.

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:55.400
There's no fucking way

02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:57.400
that you didn't feel shit.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:59.400
There's no way. The only time

02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:01.400
it hurt.

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:03.400
The only time it's hurt for me,

02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:05.400
nobody really does that a lot.

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.400
The only time it's hurt for me

02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:09.400
I draw.

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.400
This is educational.

02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:13.400
So like, you know,

02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.400
there's like the pubic bone like up here

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.400
or it's like your lippies

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.400
are right there.

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.400
It's like this bone. I had there was a girl

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.400
that like this looks like a bush.

02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:25.400
There was a girl

02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.400
to cut this out like right there.

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:29.400
There was a girl that

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.400
swung her music case

02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:33.400
that had like her clarinet or something and it hit me

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:35.400
right at the bone.

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:37.400
This is what it nuked.

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.400
And I'm just cutting this out. Don't worry about it.

02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.400
And it hurt so bad.

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.400
Like that was the only time it was like on the tip

02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:45.400
like the bone

02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:47.400
like right where your pussy lips start

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.400
to happen. That really, that really hurt.

02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.400
Yeah.

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.400
I've bruised that before like going too hard

02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:55.400
but otherwise

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.400
like

02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:59.400
you know like

02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:01.400
anyways

02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:03.400
I'm Bob Ross.

02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:05.400
These are educational drawings.

02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:07.400
The Vaude

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:09.400
is not 100% dead. We can cut it.

02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.400
We can edit the Vaude guys.

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.400
Archive bros, where are you at?

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:15.400
I'm tempted to leave it

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:17.400
in to be honest. I don't think YouTube will pick it up.

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:21.400
I tested it now.

02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:23.400
I'm gonna test it.

02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:25.400
I'm gonna fucking test it.

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.400
Because I didn't smash your pass with Tomo yesterday

02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:29.400
and we said some foul language.

02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.400
We just said some foul shit.

02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:33.400
Oh my god.

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.400
And we were fine.

02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.400
Oh my god.

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:39.400
I can't.

02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:41.400
Being in that

02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.400
you like I haven't used that

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:45.400
like

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.400
my vocal range changes depending on my mood

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.400
right.

02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:51.400
How I feel

02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:53.400
my vocal range changes.

02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:55.400
I haven't been in that vocal range in so long.

02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:57.400
My throat fucking hurts.

02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.400
I'm so sorry.

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.400
Oh my god.

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.400
I was laughing too hard in high pitch.

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:05.400
I haven't laughed that hard

02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:07.400
forever.

02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.400
My throat is fucking fucked.

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:11.400
Help.

02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:13.400
I'm so sorry.

02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:15.400
Did you need a break?

02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:17.400
Did you want to end stream?

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.400
No.

02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:21.400
It's fine.

02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:23.400
We can play one more.

02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.400
Thank you madam.

02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:27.400
Educational lecture.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:29.400
Body education.

02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:31.400
Thank you.

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:33.400
Oh thank you for the five gifted boy.

02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:35.400
I missed that one.

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.400
Yeah everyone gave me gifted.

02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:39.400
I wanted to go through them but you guys send them

02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:41.400
like back to back to back and Chibi was talking.

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:43.400
She just told me to shut up.

02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.400
No.

02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.400
Thank you guys after.

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.400
Thank you all the people that were gifted.

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:51.400
Yeah.

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:53.400
What did you want?

02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:55.400
What did you thank the people that gifted them?

02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:57.400
Because the people who were gifted.

02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:59.400
Oh I don't have gifts.

02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:01.400
I don't have gifts.

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:03.400
Remember I'm not monetized.

02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:05.400
I know but I mean like on my stream.

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:07.400
Wait. Oh I meant mine.

02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.400
Oh I get you okay.

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.400
Cause I'm like wait you're gonna go

02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:13.400
to my stream and read out the gifts.

02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:15.400
No.

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.400
No.

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.400
No.

02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:21.400
I'm happy you guys liked

02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:23.400
the educational portion of the stream.

02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:25.400
Um.

02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:27.400
I'll be good rid of this.

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:29.400
It was very educational.

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:31.400
Definitely.

02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.400
We should do a deep dive

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:35.400
into drawing anatomy.

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:37.400
Maybe I'll learn how to draw.

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:39.400
Cause I can't draw bodies like Azir can't.

02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:41.400
Uh.

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:43.400
I don't really try.

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:45.400
I don't know.

02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.400
She doesn't even try everybody.

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.400
Look.

02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:51.400
I'm not trying to.

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.400
I'm like literally don't try.

02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:55.400
Everything I draw is literally the night before.

02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:57.400
Like not even like an hour or two hours

02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.400
before I post it.

02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.400
I'm like this is a great idea.

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.400
I'll be honest.

02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:05.400
I think it looks bad.

02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:07.400
I don't know what you mean.

02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:09.400
What do you mean?

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:11.400
I do have a question.

02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:13.400
I did some art.

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:15.400
On your other account.

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:17.400
Yeah.

02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.400
It was quite creamy.

02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:21.400
What was laying?

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:23.400
Creamy.

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:25.400
Creamy.

02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:27.400
What was laying in the cream?

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.400
There was like a ball.

02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:31.400
My tail.

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:33.400
Wait.

02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.400
Your tail popped off and.

02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:37.400
It popped off.

02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:39.400
No.

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.400
My tail popped off.

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:43.400
Wait a second.

02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:45.400
Lay directly on your tail.

02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.400
So it would like hold on.

02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:49.400
I need to go hold on.

02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:51.400
I'm going to send you the picture of the one that I'm talking about.

02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:53.400
I know.

02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:55.400
I know.

02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:57.400
Yes.

02:16:57.400 --> 02:16:59.400
Wait.

02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:01.400
I'm confused.

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:03.400
You see the color.

02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:05.400
I know.

02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.400
I saw that.

02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:09.400
It was like my tail popped off.

02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:11.400
It was just like are you gay best?

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:13.400
It was just like are you gay best?

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:15.400
It was just like are you gay best?

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:17.400
It was just like are you gay best?

02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.400
It was just like are you gay best?

02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.400
Steve is going to kill me.

02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.400
I'm going to laugh too hard.

02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:25.400
I'm going to perish.

02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:27.400
please don't die.

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:29.400
Hold on.

02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:31.400
I'm going to your account right now.

02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:33.400
I'm going to stare at this.

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:35.400
First I see some gorgeous legs.

02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.400
Then we're gonna go to someplace else.

02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:45.400
Oh, that is your tail!

02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.400
It's my tail!

02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:53.400
I thought your tail would be higher up!

02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:59.400
That was it again! I was just shocked! We are so sorry for her!

02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:08.400
My tail is on my tailbone, so I thought it would be behind.

02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:10.400
Yeah, but it was mine!

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:12.400
How was your tail reaching all the way?

02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:18.400
You lay on your back and if you pull your legs up, your tailbone sticks out.

02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:22.400
Your tail would be out of your ass!

02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:29.400
I thought it was just a pile of cream and there was just a small bleeding.

02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:35.400
I'm like, oh, she gave birth!

02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:38.400
My tail is a little longer than yours.

02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:41.400
I'm not good with anatomy or perspective.

02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.400
Oh no!

02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:48.400
Now I'm just staring at this photo because it's very nice.

02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:51.400
Now that I know what it's supposed to look like.

02:18:51.400 --> 02:19:04.400
I'm so sorry!

02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:11.400
I'm not doing it on purpose! I thought it was a pregnancy kink thing!

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:15.400
Oh my God!

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:18.400
This is my gen mate, everybody. This is my gen mate.

02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:24.400
See, somebody eyes agreed with me in my chat, so...

02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:27.400
You both need to get your eyes checked!

02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:31.400
I'm wearing glasses!

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:41.400
Get new glasses! Even I don't have my glasses on!

02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.400
Okay, let's play one more.

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:51.400
We got two spots left, everybody wants to join.

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:55.400
Three spots now, three spots.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:56.400
Get your glasses.

02:19:56.400 --> 02:19:58.400
I have to make these people leave me!

02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.400
She's like, no thank you.

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:03.400
She doesn't even know where stuff is.

02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:07.400
I thought it was a rabbit spot!

02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:12.400
Oh my God.

02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:15.400
I'm sorry.

02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:23.400
Am I going to be bullied for this?

02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:25.400
I just don't remember things.

02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:28.400
I'm not good at remembering where things are and where they're supposed to go.

02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:34.400
That's literally one of my issues with my mental Illinois.

02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:36.400
The Dom has become a...

02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:38.400
No!

02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:40.400
Oh honey, don't get it twisted.

02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:44.400
Okay, I'll still put you in your fucking place, dude.

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:48.400
Now I know where to kick properly!

02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:52.400
I'm so sorry if she be was how allowed.

02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:54.400
I know I got real close to my mic.

02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:56.400
Yes!

02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:59.400
I had you turned up on the score.

02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:01.400
I had you like maxed out, like...

02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:04.400
Because I couldn't hear you earlier, but I forgot to turn you down.

02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:09.400
I'll still be dumbed, but man, that was unfortunate to hear.

02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:14.400
Shut the fuck up.

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:21.400
You know where to kick for now until I forget again.

02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:25.400
This is not the loot company, this is the...

02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:27.400
It's fine, she be yours.

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:30.400
It's okay.

02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:33.400
No.

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:38.400
I don't even know, I can't even defend myself.

02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:41.400
She be is over for you.

02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:43.400
I was right, I was right.

02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:48.400
I told you for day one when she be was saying all the things.

02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:53.400
I was like, no, this is the girl that's going to get everyone in trouble.

02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:57.400
She's gonna be in trouble with you, I can see it now.

02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:00.400
Trouble make her...

02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:05.400
She's gonna say like the craziest things.

02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:08.400
You're wrong.

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:14.400
You know, you're not wrong.

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:23.400
I was still even with me saying that, I was still surprised by this shit you'll be saying.

02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:25.400
I can't get up.

02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:27.400
What is she saying?

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.400
I can't get up.

02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.400
I'm falling and I can't get up.

02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.400
Oh shit.

02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:44.400
Oh, okay, there's water.

02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:47.400
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

02:22:47.400 --> 02:23:00.400
Oh shit.

02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:02.400
Oh no.

02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:07.400
Yeah, I'm not gonna make it.

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:13.400
Oh shit.

02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:19.400
Forget I can dive.

02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:21.400
Oh fuck.

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:23.400
Ow.

02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:26.400
Oh my god.

02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:29.400
I'm literally like last.

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.400
I made it.

02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:33.400
I'm amazing.

02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:39.400
I was like...

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:41.400
No.

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:43.400
She didn't make it.

02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:45.400
Rest in peace.

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:47.400
Rest in peace?

02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:51.400
I'm resting in peace right now.

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:54.400
Resting in peace?

02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:57.400
Resting in peace isn't in peace.

02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:02.400
In peace.

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.400
Totally fair.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:06.400
I deserve this.

02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:11.400
I'm responding to my feet.

02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:15.400
It's not my fault that men are built weird, okay?

02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:19.400
I'm gonna draw a sheebie.

02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:23.400
Discovering a dick for the first time.

02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:24.400
How did you know?

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:26.400
How did you know my plan?

02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:28.400
How did you know?

02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:30.400
That was my plan.

02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:33.400
What is this?

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.400
Weeeeee.

02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:44.400
Ow.

02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:50.400
For not having our animal men are freaks of nature.

02:24:50.400 --> 02:25:03.400
That's why they get dombed.

02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:11.400
Actually no, the male and the female form are quite beautiful.

02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:13.400
I just forget what they...

02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:15.400
Wait, is that the one way?

02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:17.400
What if we go this way?

02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.400
Don't get it twisted.

02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:21.400
I don't remember.

02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:23.400
I'm not gonna make it.

02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:28.400
It's because I fell.

02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.400
I'm happy nobody heard me say that.

02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.400
What'd you say?

02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:33.400
Don't worry about it.

02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:35.400
What'd she say?

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:36.400
What'd she say?

02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:38.400
What'd she say?

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:40.400
What'd she say?

02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:45.400
What'd you say?

02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:51.400
I forget what my own looks like.

02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:53.400
Like that ass?

02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:56.400
Yeah, I'm not looking at it all the time.

02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.400
That ass?

02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:00.400
What if you get something?

02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:02.400
What if there's a mole?

02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:08.400
Actually, somebody made me really look the other day.

02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:10.400
Because they're like, do you have any moles?

02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.400
And I was like, oh, I do.

02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:14.400
I have one.

02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:19.400
I realized I actually have three beauty marks there.

02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:21.400
I have one.

02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:25.400
Oh, let me pull up a diagram.

02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:27.400
Oh, you're gonna actually give them a diagram?

02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:29.400
I'm just gonna say where it is.

02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:30.400
I can't say.

02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.400
It's hard to describe where they are.

02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:36.400
Mine is on my lip.

02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.400
Your lip?

02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:39.400
I have...

02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:41.400
I might have to look again.

02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:43.400
On the inside of my lip.

02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:49.400
I have one on the outside, and then one on the inside.

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:52.400
This again.

02:26:52.400 --> 02:27:00.400
I have to look again, because I forget.

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:02.400
Capture?

02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:03.400
Perfect.

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.400
Okay, let me take a peek.

02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:08.400
Okay.

02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:11.400
I have one right there.

02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:14.400
One right there, and one right...

02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:16.400
Wait.

02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:18.400
Wait.

02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:21.400
Okay.

02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:23.400
All right.

02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:24.400
I'm ready.

02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:30.400
Okay, so how do I make this thicker?

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:36.400
Make the brush thicker.

02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:42.400
Yeah.

02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:45.400
Get distracted, get distracted, get distracted.

02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:46.400
Very much.

02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:49.400
Get distracted, get distracted, get distracted.

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:52.400
I have one on the inside of my lip.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:53.400
Eggplant.

02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:54.400
I need help.

02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.400
One right there.

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.400
One right there.

02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:00.400
Go bullet person.

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:16.400
It's a duck.

02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:29.400
What the fuck are you doing?

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.400
I'm not...

02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:33.400
It was very abstract.

02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:39.400
You guys couldn't tell what I was talking about.

02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:41.400
It's a duck.

02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:43.400
Yeah, she's just quacking.

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:48.400
I was drawing my interpretation of a duck.

02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:50.400
Azir is quacking.

02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.400
I'm drawing my...

02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:58.400
My beauty marks.

02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:01.400
That's everyone's phone.

02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.400
The phone will be fine.

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:05.400
It's fine.

02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:06.400
Relax.

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:07.400
Oh!

02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.400
Is that a chili dog?

02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:11.400
Oh, yeah.

02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:13.400
It's a chili dog.

02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:15.400
Look at that.

02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:17.400
Oh.

02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:19.400
There was two of them.

02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.400
Girl, are you good?

02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:23.400
It's a chili dog.

02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:24.400
Look at that.

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:27.400
Oh.

02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.400
There was two of them.

02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:30.400
There are two.

02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:32.400
They're just like hot dogs, though.

02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:34.400
It's really grilled.

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:36.400
Oh, which is really grilled.

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:38.400
That's not sauce on it.

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:40.400
They sauce in?

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.400
They lost in the sauce?

02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:44.400
I don't know why I said sauce.

02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:56.400
They time Azir is a different breed.

02:29:56.400 --> 02:30:02.400
Yeah, you guys get me at night when I have like no energy.

02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:07.400
This is like how she is in all of our collabs in our meetings.

02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:09.400
This is Azir.

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.400
It's a night she's chilling.

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:14.400
Azir really likes chili dogs.

02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:16.400
She definitely loves wieners.

02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:18.400
That's for sure.

02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:21.400
I want to touch the eggplant.

02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:24.400
Eggplants really taste the other good plants.

02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:25.400
Is it?

02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:26.400
Really?

02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:27.400
I don't know.

02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:29.400
I've never had an eggplant before.

02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:31.400
The texture isn't for everybody.

02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:32.400
I changed my mind.

02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:34.400
I don't want to eat it.

02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:36.400
Yeah, I don't know if you would like it.

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.400
At least like eggplant farm.

02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:40.400
I like eggplant farm.

02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:42.400
Maybe.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:45.400
I'm very picky with some things that I eat.

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:47.400
My throat is so fucked.

02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:49.400
I'm so sorry.

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:51.400
Because aren't you streaming after this?

02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:53.400
Yeah.

02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:00.400
Put some salt on it.

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:06.400
Don't worry, well I'm after this and you can rest.

02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:08.400
She needs some milk.

02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:10.400
She needs some milk.

02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:12.400
It's undercat.

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:14.400
Fucking thing.

02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:16.400
Or key man rather.

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:18.400
That's actually pretty cool.

02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:20.400
It is actually.

02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:22.400
It's kind of hardcore.

02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:24.400
Oh ghost cat, congratulations.

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:26.400
Congratulations.

02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:33.400
It was so fun playing with everybody.

02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:38.400
And I'm glad

02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:41.400
you got to learn a little more about me.

02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:48.400
It's so funny.

02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:50.400
It's so funny because

02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:52.400
you were making fun of me.

02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:54.400
You are making fun of me

02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:56.400
earlier.

02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:58.400
I'm going to tease Azura.

02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:00.400
I'm going to tease Azura.

02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:02.400
I'm going to tell everybody what happened.

02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:06.400
I said, do you want to call me

02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:08.400
50 minutes before?

02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:10.400
And she was like, sure we can do that.

02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:12.400
And I said, sweet.

02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:14.400
And she was like, how do you want to play using vtube studio?

02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:16.400
And I said, I'm going to do

02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:18.400
foodie tech because it's easier on my computer.

02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:20.400
And then Azura says, okay.

02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:22.400
And I said, is that okay with you?

02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:24.400
I can still pop open studio,

02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:26.400
like have her model in it.

02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:28.400
So we had a boyfriend model.

02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:30.400
If you think it would be better.

02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:32.400
Azura said, I don't mind either way.

02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.400
But are you not using studio during live?

02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.400
And I said, I'd use studio for my model.

02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:38.400
Yes. And she's like, oh, okay.

02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:40.400
I was confused. I thought everybody use a PNG.

02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:42.400
And I said, no, use foodie tech

02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:44.400
for you. And then she said, oh,

02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:46.400
LMFAO.

02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:48.400
And I said, ellipses, Azura, ellipses,

02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:50.400
ellipses, ellipses.

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.400
And then she said, oh, I'm sorry.

02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:54.400
And I said, I'm going to tease you for this. And she said, no.

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:56.400
And then she said, style up off saying, don't do it.

02:32:56.400 --> 02:32:58.400
And that's the story.

02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:00.400
I have to fart.

02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:02.400
But she didn't say that.

02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:04.400
I didn't say that.

02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:06.400
Listening.

02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:08.400
Listening.

02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:10.400
I spread my teeth so you guys couldn't hear it.

02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:12.400
Oh.

02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:14.400
Oh, what the?

02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:16.400
What the hell?

02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:18.400
Oh, hi.

02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:20.400
Hi, welcome raiders.

02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:22.400
Hi.

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:24.400
I don't know.

02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.400
I don't know.

02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:28.400
I don't know.

02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:30.400
I don't know.

02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:32.400
I don't know.

02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:34.400
Let me look.

02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:36.400
Sorry.

02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:38.400
I can't tell.

02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:40.400
Because I can't see it.

02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:42.400
You highlight it.

02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:44.400
Can you highlight it?

02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:46.400
I have a chat very much

02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:48.400
closed.

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:50.400
It is

02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:52.400
Shantarelle.

02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:54.400
Shantarelle.

02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:56.400
Shantarelle.

02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:58.400
Shantarelle.

02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:00.400
Shantarelle.

02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:02.400
Shantarelle.

02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:04.400
I like your name.

02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:06.400
Welcome, raiders.

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:08.400
Welcome, welcome.

02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:10.400
Thank you. You're doing great. Thank you.

02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:12.400
Yay.

02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:14.400
Yay.

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:16.400
Yay.

02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:18.400
Yay.

02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:20.400
Yay.

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.400
You won't get away with this, right?

02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:24.400
Whatever.

02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:26.400
Are you still streaming?

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:28.400
Are you going to keep streaming?

02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.400
I think.

02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:32.400
I don't know.

02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:34.400
Should I end it?

02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:36.400
I think I'm going to end it and then start again.

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:38.400
I'm going to just chat for a little bit at the end.

02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:40.400
With the tatters.

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.400
And stuff.

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.400
I'll chat with you guys too.

02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:46.400
Well, I mean like my chat.

02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:48.400
And I'll say bye.

02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:50.400
Thank you for playing with me.

02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:52.400
It was so fun.

02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:54.400
It was so fun.

02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:56.400
Bye bye, cute-bye.

02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:58.400
Bye bye.

02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:10.400
Do you guys hate me?

02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:16.400
Listen, everybody forgets

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.400
so that you used to be cute and funny

02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:20.400
in my past life.

02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:33.400
And I'm, I might be a little innocent and forgetful when it comes to male and female

02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:46.600
bodies but I'm still here madam and you can't forget that I am the one in

02:35:46.600 --> 02:36:00.760
control. I, I am close to graduating my DOM class. I am learning

02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:12.320
expeditiously. I am still in charge. Isn't it hotter though? Isn't it hotter that you

02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:29.880
have such a silly girl doing that to you? Doesn't it just tickle you a little bit?

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:43.040
It's a bit tantalizing is it not? Yeah, everybody has to learn somewhere.

02:36:43.040 --> 02:37:02.400
The gap is getting wider each day. So you can't raise that? Yes I can. Bend over, spread your

02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:19.560
cheeks. I'm going in with no lube. If you scream, we repeat the process tomorrow. If you stay

02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:44.640
quiet, I'll let you finish. The game and Minecraft of course. Just as the fall guys beat. Oh, don't

02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:56.880
you want to flick that bean though? I wanna be the very best that no one ever was. To

02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:07.640
catch them is my real quest. To train my bitches. My harem is my cause. I will travel across

02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:15.880
the land. Searching far and wide. Something, something, something, something. The dominatrix

02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:25.080
that's inside. Madame Chibi. Gonna tame a mong. It's so true. She's gonna put her strap

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:52.640
in you. She fucks me. And my balls are blue. Dom Chibi. Chibi Dom. The boss is not

02:38:52.640 --> 02:39:16.800
obsessed. It's him. I love it here. Gotta tame a mong. Chibi Dom. Take all that juice

02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:31.120
out of you. What do you mean? Chibi streams are one of the, why would the bod is fine?

02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:51.720
The bod is fine. This is the one I call my Oshi. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I'm your Oshi.

02:39:51.720 --> 02:40:02.960
My voice goes very high when I'm embarrassed and excited. Minas are a lot alike in that

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:15.400
way that our voices change. Actually, no, I don't want to do that. I'll tame it. Call

02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:29.360
me Oshi. No. I'm so sorry. You guys have bad taste in women. I have to work on that,

02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:38.400
I guess. I think, I think Strawnee would love that if I told her. I already pitched a couple

02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:45.840
ideas to her about some content that I want to do consistently. And I'm going to start

02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:51.520
planning for them. There's two segments I want to start doing because I think there's a niche

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:56.240
for them. I don't know if there'll be honestly a niche for one of them amongst men, but I

02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:03.200
think you guys would still enjoy it. I want to do like a book reading club podcast of

02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:09.520
Smuddy Books. I was thinking about it before, and that's why I like when Amy's like, oh,

02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:12.280
I want to read this book. I'm just like, oh my God, please tell me because I want to do

02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:20.480
it with her. And then my friend Salem and Strawnee said it was fine. And fanfix. Yes,

02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:24.360
fanfix would be a thing. I'm going to do more. Don't worry, I'm still continuing fanfix

02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:33.000
next week. Yeah, I'm turning Salem into a Vtuber. I hope you guys are happy. I'm trying.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:39.120
I was supposed to go over her house today to see, to figure out a set up for a podcast.

02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:46.080
Because, but like, it's this is something we've wanted to do since for a couple years

02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:52.360
now me and me and Salem, but I'm trying. I'm helping her design her character, but she's

02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:58.400
not in Villalur. She's literally only going to live on my channel. She's not going to

02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:02.240
be like social media or anything or be like her own entity. It's only going to be for

02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:08.600
a podcast. But I think it'll be super fun. What if Salem becomes a dominator? Oh, Salem's

02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:18.480
100% a sub. I'm sorry. No, she she is not Dom at all. She is 100%. She is the she is

02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:29.280
a bratty mess of Gaki type. 100%. She's short. I've choked her before as a joke in our store

02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:39.720
and she screamed and it was like R2D2 screaming. It was very funny. She's not my sub, no.

02:42:39.720 --> 02:43:09.680
She's more of a pocket than me. I don't forget I said she was way more base than I am. I

02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:22.880
have to reel her in. She isn't even on the interwebs like that. Bad Omen's equal sub.

02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:33.320
Got it. Very great man though. Um, I think it'll be a recorded thing just because for

02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:42.120
like safety. Strawdy set me to get stepped on. All right, hold on. Hold on just a moment.

02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:58.840
Prepare to be stepped. Thank you, Bob. Here are your stepies. Take a good with. My feet

02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:03.440
don't really like step from side to side like some models do, but I hope to get that at some

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:09.320
point. My legs are so nice. Can we just talk about how nice my legs are? Imagine if this

02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:17.480
was my skin tone. I wouldn't even be mad about that. Or is there a skin tone? Steppy,

02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:28.640
okay, I need you to stretch out your neck and I'm gonna step on your windpipe. Oh yeah,

02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:35.480
it's look at my thighs. You guys don't see my thighs that often. Okay, come come and back to

02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:44.320
her. Imagine if she'd be to step to their feet. Oh, I have heels so I could do that.

02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:59.520
How do you got the got thigh for the thighs? Everybody gets a treat. No, not my neck.

02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:14.520
But I hope you guys enjoyed. Sorry, I was looking at Azura's chat to see if she got off or not.

02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:24.920
I think you just did. Um, she's still talking. Um, because I wanted to see if I was going to read

02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:31.600
into her next one, but I don't know. I'm sorry for my behavior. If there's any bleeding hearts in

02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:47.000
the audience. Um, but sometimes I do misbehave and I do have no filter. Well, that's just how I am.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:58.600
Vaughn is not being edited. Vaughn is fine. Why not step on the ribs or solar plexus? I could

02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:04.880
break your ribs if you want. I can just like pile of drive my ass into it. Be like, watch out,

02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:18.680
watch out, and then just like fucking slam my ass down. Okay, I'm a little, a little embarrassed.

02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:27.640
I got my way is strong right now. I'm feeling like, I'm feeling like I see I'm in my little space.

02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:35.040
I feel very cute and funny right now.

02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:56.000
But um, uh, I hope you guys had a good time. I'm gonna play Azura, uh, and I hope you have a good

02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:06.920
night or day. And I'm gonna go hide away and I'm gonna go practice drawing. Because somebody got me a

02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:12.600
drawing tablet because I got a drawing tablet because I do want to practice drawing. So, uh,

02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:19.280
maybe I'll put up a drawing stream for next week. And you guys can all practice and what

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:30.280
drawn out of me and fucking, you guys can laugh at me. Okay, I'll see ya. Stay for the raid. Bye.
