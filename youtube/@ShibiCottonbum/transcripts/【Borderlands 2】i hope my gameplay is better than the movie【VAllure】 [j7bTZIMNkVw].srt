22
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:25,000
for now, I can't even change the resolution, not the resolution, the box size, sorry, you guys are going to be over here, cut off the heart,

23
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:38,000
high clip or is somebody going to clip, I'm going to cut off the whole top part, I don't hope it's nothing important there, don't put baby in the

24
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:53,000
corner, speaking of babies, I'm so pissed I miss my friends, because she's my best friend and I missed her child's birthday, because I was sick and it was cute because it was, it was like warped tour themed

25
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:09,000
because they're a bunch of men and kids, or alternative kids, I don't know, I also have my food with me, yeah it was, see what the plan was was I was going to stream and then after I streamed I was going to leave

26
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:30,000
because she lives over an hour away from me, yeah but still, it still bothers me, I just made sweet potato fries and chicken tenders, yeah the next time I see her I'm going to bring the present with me

27
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:59,000
um, last time I got baby a squishmallow, so this time I'll get her something cooler, yeah I'm just really, because they also haven't hung out with those people in a long time, so I just bummed, I was bummed, but they, she didn't mind at all, they were like oh if you're sick of course, like it's fine, it's just me, I just beat myself up over it, um, is this sound okay, is it too loud, get her a puppy,

28
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:26,000
she already has two cats, so I don't think her mom would like that, and I think they're allergic, I think, I think the dad is allergic to God, so I don't know, get her a very noisy toy, don't sick the child, yeah I also don't want to, she gets sick really easily the baby, so, I have a picture of her, I'm also, you know what else, I'm essentially like her godmother so like that's another thing,

29
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,080
Another thing that's why I'm just like I miss my godchild's birthday

30
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,800
Kind of quiet well, I think I'll leave it for now and we'll see

31
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,140
But yeah, I have to I have to bring the present to Goddard

32
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,520
I should get her a tomagotchi no kidding. I don't think I don't think she can use some I just give her my

33
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,520
Tom, and I'm kidding. Wait, let's check on my tomagotchi everybody

37
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,680

39
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,040
No, no, it's fine. It's ugly. It's okay

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,280
Throw another just throw the body onto the pile. I don't even know what it turned into it just died

00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,040
Hi hi, Pimpals. I hope you had a good time within me

43
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Hope you guys played the what was it? What was it? You guys are doing something iPhone related iPhone video games iPhone mobile game

44
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I don't remember

45
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,200
But I bet I bet it was silly because Amy always has silly streams

46
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,960
Blue blue we did purple last time. We'll do blue

47
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,400
The iPhone games. Oh my god. Did she play?

48
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,040
They played torque. He said did you guys I think somebody was telling me so I ended up looking it up. Did you guys play?

49
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,040
um

50
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
What's it called?

51
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
sorry the

52
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,920
Throwing off by vealer and joyer in my chat because I just love some of you guys make alt accounts just to talk to us

53
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
It's very easy to me. Um

54
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:40,840
Did you guys play like the steam games that are like that are the real versions of the games? Did you guys do that?

55
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,120
Maybe me if there's multiplayer, maybe I'll you played bit life. I've actually played bit life before

56
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I

57
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I've actually paid bit life. That's cool. Yeah, and me. Let's I'll see if I can find the games

58
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,920
I it's like I it's something like iPhone games, but they're blah blah blah blah. It was 99%

59
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,120
That's why I have Apple Arcade, baby

60
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,640
We didn't play bit life. Oh, I liked bit life. I played it a little bit

61
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,480
We're almost the one at first came out. I have no idea when that came out

62
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I just remember it was like years ago

63
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,400
And we got 38% pregnant and then he gave up because there's too many ads

64
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah, like I remember when I played there was gonna be like a few ads, but this is a long time ago. So

65
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
That's so funny

66
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,520
Honestly, some of the game like I'm so mad because some of those games look so fun

67
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,120
And then you're like, oh

68
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,760
Like I was watching one where you have to like save a king

69
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,600
and like

70
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,560
Get them out from from being crushed by rocks or like gold and I'm like, oh

71
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,360
But it's fake. It's all fake. It's all a sigh up. They all just want to take your

72
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
information and sell it

73
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,840
to countries

74
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
They're all clickbait

75
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
They also call it what

76
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,600
And what did you call her? Huh?

77
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Which form

78
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,720
This is why I saw me the game that yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about

79
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Literally, oh you called

80
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,080
That's so funny. He just really called her ace like

81
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
What the hell was that

82
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
That was weird, um

83
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,600
Yeah, you want those games right? So here you go. No, let's yes. Yes. I think that was it. I don't know

84
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:44,440
That was the game that's clap trap. Oh again, I've never I know who clap trap is what I've never played this

85
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,640
It was through it just threw me off because I'm like there it's spinning in the background

86
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,600
I need a shift display name. That's perfect name is already taken

87
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't want to play multiplayer

88
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,600
My first gun. Wow. Fabulous. This is making me dizzy. I hate when they do this. Stop spitting. Just just hang out, please

89
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
It makes me so fucking nauseous

90
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
um

91
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
She slammed dunked a baby. That's pretty cool

92
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, I'm gonna eat some of my chicken tendies because I have two left

93
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
I have some ranch and I have some honey mustard

94
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,920
I like honey mustard and then I dip it in the ranch or vice versa. I used to hate ranch

95
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,040
What makes you think I have the dlc characters?

96
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,120
What makes you think I have any of that stuff?

97
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
When I've never played this game

98
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,280
Because you probably bought this well, actually, yeah, maybe I did

99
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,600
Because I bought I bought it with the first game

100
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,960
And the um, it was bundled with the first game in the game of the year for the first game edition

101
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
I dropped 20 mustard on my shirt

102
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
I have everything

103
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Is this all stuff that I have

104
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is this stuff that I own

105
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I don't know

106
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,160
Yeah, what the hell how do I have all of this?

107
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Oh

108
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
What

109
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,800
Oh, okay, you guys can't see that. I just got really scared that I just like because my whole steam just threw up

110
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,640
Um, well, I don't really care about dlc stuff right now. I'll be honest with you

111
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,440
I never played borderlands. Hold on. You know what? Let's do something. What's that say?

112
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:36,840
Why isn't this showing up? Oh, it's because it's below the

113
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:48,520
I have never played any borderlands stop asking

114
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Okay

115
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,080
They'll put that right up there. So I don't have to keep repeating myself

116

Since I have like a bat and I feel like it fits the colors of borderlands. So I was like, yeah, let's do it. Um

Should I put it on my titties like will you guys be able to see?

122

Well, if I have any mods here if anybody asks you can just time them out

123
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280

Like a cute and funny model

154
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm debating whether or not to give myself a massive bunny tail. Like if you know like a giant cotton tail

155
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,720
And then then I would actually be cotton bomb. So I'm tempted to do something like this. Let me show you

156
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,800
Um, because like you don't see a freaking tail

157
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,640
And honestly, I've also been forever did it wrong. I've also been a little bit inspired

158
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
by me was designed

159
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,600
Because she has like little like puffs around her and I was like, oh, maybe

160
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,440
I can use some puffs. Uh, I was also thinking about just reusing and re-skinning my rena model that I got from swalcoy

161
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,440
I'll I can show it to you guys. I don't really care

162
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,640
I showed her on a member stream like a very long time ago, but I can show you guys, uh, let me do

163
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,960
And just re-skinning it because I again, I spent like three thousand dollars on a model

164
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,520
I never used so I would like to use it at some point

165
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,040
Where is it? Oh, there it is. So if I did like

166
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Like something like that

167
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Oh, that's my body. Sorry

168
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,600
Let me make this bigger

169
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,240
Like you can see that it's like I have a giant fucking tail

170
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,560
But just imagine me cute and funny with the giant fucking tail

171
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
You know

172
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,400
Yeah, here I'll I'll show it to you guys I never show I only showed the members not even my

173
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
I never showed it to

174
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Uh, anybody besides the members

175
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
I know it is hard to see but if I was

176
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Never mind, um

177
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,680
Dullahan problems for real. Maybe my 2.0. I should just full-on become a Dullahan

178
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,000
But I'll show you I had a casual outfit for Rina. I never got to use

179
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Let me see if I can find it. Thank you

180
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Here it is

181
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
So this was my Rina outfit

182
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,320
You can see the surprise guys. Hi. I'm gonna know. Um

183
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,680
But imagine if I just did bunny ears made myself blonde made everything red

184
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Um

185
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Yeah

186
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,280
And like I was and I was I was a Siamese cat

187
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
So I know I want to be a Himalayan bunny

188
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Uh, so I was

189
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
I was tempted

190
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, it was a really freaking cute design and I never got to use it

191
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,920
And I spent a lot of money

192
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,560
So I want to reuse this and I know swalkoi totally would swalkoi is a real one

193
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:29,000
There if you're if you're a vtuber watching this and you want a really quality model and someone that's just like generally a wonderful person to work with

194
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,000
Uh, they will they will do that

195
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,960
Uh, yeah the poof around like honestly like I literally look like I'm related to miwa like it's so adorable

196
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,160
I bet she would love this if she saw it. I never showed it to her. Um, but yeah

197
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,120
So I might rework that at some point

198
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Yeah, so that's a little spoiler

199
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,520
If I decide to reskin it, uh, we'll see we'll see we'll see

200
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,960
Yeah, the poof around the wrist was really bunny like I agree

201
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Um

202
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,080
Tim gun make it work. Hold on. Let me just I can't just my freaking phone

203
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,320
Oh, yeah, I know everybody would die of heart attacks. You'll be very funny. I'm already full

204
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I've only had a couple bites

205
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,760
Um, or again, I might just get the art that I got commissioned

206
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
So we'll see

207
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,320
Because you guys have seen the delinquent sheebie art

208
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Again, I could totally rework that

209
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
because

210
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:04,840
It has um, it has a nude base because um, I had multiple outfits for it. It was that was that outfit and another outfit

211
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,480
Boomi actually didn't come over to check it out. I don't know. Oh, he's sleeping

212
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,240
Okay, I'm out of water good thing I have

213
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,800
My lemonade that I brought out just in case

214
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,120
This is lemonade from a while ago that I ordered

215
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
For my ice from my cup and that

216
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,120
I think I should add fit. Yeah, I would so I would add like the harness and stuff

217
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,680
Um

218
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
And all that that jazz

219
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,960
Was boomi making noise because I was looking at like there was a comment under the space that said what that like boomi

220
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,960
Boomi that boomi was doing something. Is it the lemonade they give me tummy issues? Yes

221
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:13,480
Okay, it turned into tusk touchy and it was naughty and it died that was the name of the tomagotchi

222
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,120
By the way, tusk touchy. That is the weirdest name for tomagotchi

223
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Boomi was scratching

224
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,360
Oh, if that that was rena

225
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,400
That was rena that was rena, uh, probably scratching litter box. Was it like this? Hold on

226
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Was it like that?

227
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Uh

228
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
The acid hurt my tummy

229
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Sometimes then I have too much acid

230
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,720
Not that loud. Well, yeah, because I wasn't right and I like I'm at my desk now. But like I was at mom my couch before

231
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,680
um

232
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
But that that's that's rena

233
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,160
I fell asleep. I woke up a cheapy stream. Hi. Hi. Um

234
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Reina just

235
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,600
Doesn't have the concept that she's supposed to

236
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,120
Scratch the litter and not the actual box and bear to like use the bathroom

237
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
But um, yeah

238
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,600
Okay, so we have a baby now. I've select I've selected the blue egg

239
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,820
The blue egg will be rolling around

240
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
He made great wookie sounds

241
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,880
Was that fia or b because I heard myself snoring I was going

242
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,040
Like I was I started something in the chat say I was doing hunk

Uh hunk me me me it was like hunk sheebie boo, but then there was there was a different snore

245
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,280
That was fia because you were guys so I placed you on top of fia's bed

246
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Like you know how it's like a little like ring

247
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,680
And she's in the center. I put you on the outside of the ring. So it was her then you then me

248
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,200
and so hunk sheebie me me me

249
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,560
So the little the little like like hum noises, uh, that was fia fia snores

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,640
Uh boomy doesn't snore reina reina snore sometimes

251
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,680
But yeah, I snore I also snored because I had my mouth open because I can't breathe

252
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,120
But I'm happy you guys liked the fact that my farting

253
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
My farting uh

254
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,280
Snores were uh attractive to you

255
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
They did sound cute

256
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,280
um

257
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,960
It wasn't as like crazy as it could be because I know sometimes my

258
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,440
They can be super crazy

259
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,120
But it was funny

260
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,320
I was listening back and I like literally like snore and it sounds and then I sound like I'm fucking choking

261
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
It was so funny

262
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,560
You know those one hour silencer to both fia at random times

263
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,320
Oh really? Okay, maybe I'll make it into an ASMR

264
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,840
I'll maybe I'll like send it to straw and you'll be like, can you do anything with this?

265
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Can you download the sound?

266
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Was it great sleeping?

267
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,800
Yeah, I just I was just again

268
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,240
I just wanted to hang out with you guys and just like pretend like we were in bed

269
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,160
Just like with the cat with fia and just like chatting

270
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,920
Except we're just listening to me yap and mumble as I fall asleep

271
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,240
Was this all early in the stream? No, it was a twitter space. I felt it's on my alt account. I um

272
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,280
I was like nap with your sick gf and so I just fell asleep on in the um

273
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,240
In the twitter space for a couple hours and so I was just snoring

274
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,080
And uh

275
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,360
Yeah, I don't know why I'm looking at myself right now and I have never felt

276
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,120
More like myself than now. It is so weird. I just had this weird

277
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,000
Like I'm looking I'm like and I'm looking at my model and I'm like that looks like me

278
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,400
And it was really weird

279
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,120
I mean, maybe it's the outfit because it's something that I would totally wear

280
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,040
Um, that was really funny that was that is like really clicked for me that I really like this outfit

281
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Because this is 100 something that I'd wear

282
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,000
um

283
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,800
and

284
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Yeah

285
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Is it the sweet potato fries?

286
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,560
Uh, hold on my friend with the baby's texting me

287
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,480
Oh, yeah, she's like, oh, I hope you feel better

288
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,640
And freckles they're super cute. Yeah, because I have freckles too

289
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Um, I really like this outfit

290
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,200
It's just like it just really it just felt feels really me if I just had like a couple of moles on my body

291
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,640
It'd feel even better. That's so funny. It just fucking locked and I also have a barrette

292
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,560
I could beat you with if a baby texted me. I would simply not answer

293
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,480
Um, it'd be funny if the baby could text me. Uh, she is too young to do so

294
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,520
um

295
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,800
But yeah, this out like I don't know why that just like felt really

296
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Really, right? Um

297
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Now I can sing

298
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,680
Like I haven't started the game yet and it's already been 30 minutes

299
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
I can be like

300
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat

301
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,680
Peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat

302
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,480
Wee-yah, wee-yah, wee-yah, wee-yah

303
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,160
The disto, disto, disto, disto

304
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,520
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly

305
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,960
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly

306
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
Oh

307
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Wait, I can actually more accurately show you guys my moles. Oh, there's one right here. So I'll go on right here

308
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,920
Boop

309
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,280
And then I have some more on my face. I want on my nose, but that just looks weird when I try to put it on

310
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,320
The most noticeable one if I have a mole like right on my nose not like a mole

311
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,280
It's like it's a fucking beauty mark and it's funny because my dad has one in the same exact spot

312
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,200
You can't really see it of course because he's like super fucking dark skinned, but it's funny

313
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,320
He has the same exact moles, um, beauty mark in the same exact spot

314
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
um

315
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
And let me do another one

316
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,280
I need to put a toggle to put in crustables the fact I actually don't have an uncrustables png is ridiculous

317
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
All right

318
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,080
And then well

319
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,600
I have one on my armpit, but I can't put it there. Wait, let me look at my arm

320
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Because I have one on my arm

321
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,240
Yes, it's right there

322
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
So I have one right here

323
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
It's not gonna stay, but it's fine

324
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Uh

325
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,120
So, uh

326
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,000
Canonically I have one right here

327
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,320
But I or all I actually have one right here

328
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,720
So I'll put it right there

329
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,360
And it's not gonna stay but it's fine. We're just we're just getting a general idea

330
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
And then

331
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
I have

332
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,680
Well, I could it looks like weird if I put two there, so I'll just do one on my shoulder

333
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
I

334
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,000
Have one in the center of my chest as well. Um, I have one like

335
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,320
Right, where is it? Hold on you look at my stomach. I can't see this look dark in my room

336
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
I have it

337
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Where are you?

338
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
It's to the side

339
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
There it is

340
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,160
Cut around which side it was on it's on this side. It's a little bit smaller than the others

341
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Beauty mark show and tell

342
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Beauty mark show and tell

343
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:06,360
And then I have so I have one like right above my

344
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Uh

345
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,560
Bean

346
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,080
And then I have one on one lip and I have one on the one look down there, but other than I have one right here

347
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
And then

348
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
And then they have

349
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,200
One on the other side, but it's a little bit smaller and a little bit lower. It's like that

350
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:39,800
And then I have like a couple of like like a couple wait, hold on. What's the where's the one on my hip?

351
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Is it on this hip or the other hip?

352
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,360
It's a little I can't my ass too fat

353
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,840
And then I can't show my one on my feet because I have one on my foot

354
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
It's really right in it

355
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,400
Where's the one on my foot? It's literally right under

356
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,560
My index toe on my

357
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,360
Under my index toe on my left foot

358
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Oh

359
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Thank you, thank you

360
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:55,320
I put my headphones back in out sometimes I sneeze too hard and it hurts my neck and then it hurts my shoulder

361
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,040
Because I have neck and spine issues

362
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,360
Um

363
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,760
Do I I know I have more on my legs, but it was too lazy. I also have one really up high

364
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
It's like right

365
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Here

366
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,320
it's like

367
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Literally like right there

368
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
But yeah, I have a lot

369
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,960
I'll stick it there for now. That's actually pretty accurate. Well, uh

370
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
It looked like I just got a lot of bugs on me

371
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,680
I like to collect them all connect them all like a constellation. Yeah, I get cramps in my arms

372
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,800
It's like my ribs and spine took a screenshot for real

373
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
All right, we were playing a game right

374
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Oh

375
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
What the fuck was that

376
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,040
Was that clap trap again? Where is he like falling down the river?

377
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Is he like falling off of it

378
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Oh, there he is

379
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,640
I found him it's like playing eye spy or where's clap trap

380
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
So

381
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,400
You want to hear another story, huh? Yeah one where the very fate of pandora hangs in the balance pandora

382
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,840
Not too bad. I'm telling you anyway. Am I playing avatar?

383
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
An alien prison

384
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Cool to the warriors

385
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,280
The vault was just a container of tentacles and disappointment

386
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
They vanished into the wastelands

387
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,000
Sure that the vault held no treasure at all

388
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
They were wrong

389
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,760
The vault's opening triggered the growth of iridium a priceless alien element

390
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Okay, soon the rare invaluable mineral emerged all across pandora. Okay

391
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,360
It's attracted many including the hyperion corporation

392
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:21,000
What is hyperion came to pandora to mine iridium and bring order to the savage

393
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,080
This is like through their excavations hyperion uncovered evidence of an even greater

394
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,480
Vibranium

395
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,800
Kidding to use its power to civilize the borderlands once and for all

396
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,880
What's the lore the only one searching for the next vault's alien power?

397
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:49,560
What's the lore the call of danger and loot is not so easily like what what time period is this like how far into the future

398
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,760
I know the video is the lore but like

399
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,280
I want to play gen g

400
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,480
He doesn't really look that handsome to me in my opinion

401
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,880
Super future. I know it's sci-fi

402
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,440
But I like a time period like it's 33,000 bazillion years in the future

403
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,920
Okay, I haven't watched this part yet. I added with the headphones and at least

404
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,960
I can skip it right no, I can't um

405
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,440
It's another planet she be there is no, okay. I'm just asking

406
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Damn bitches god damn

407
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Space wild west

408
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Oh, no poor guy. That's not nice

409
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:08,920
Was this loosely based off of mad max, okay, what the fuck he looks like he's four feet tall

410
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Oh

411
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,960

449
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,360

Turn it to fucking zero

453
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,720
What I liked about my

454
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,520
My logitech

455
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,320
G 303, I think what it was

456
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
Um the one that shroud uses

457
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,880
I used it before him just saying uh is that I could click

458
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:39,080
The center of my mouse like right before this under the scroll wheel and I had three presets for mouse sensitivity

459
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:46,280
And it would do it automatically for me regardless of the game and I love that so much and yeah

460
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,840
Yeah

461
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,720
But logitech is such like odd double click, but yeah reason

462
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,680
Oh, does this one not have it? No, I'm using my razor. Um death adder chroma

463
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,560
Bro, did you get any sleep? It doesn't sound like it. Also bless you. Thanks. Jesus fucking christ. I'm sick

464
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,520
Yes, I slept for literally three hours with harem

465
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,080
um

466
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,400
But

467
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,040
Yeah, I like I like that because um

468
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,480
It was good for fps games

469
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,120
Why do you look hyper realistic

470
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
Your mouth isn't moving. Hey

471
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,760
You're so cute to be honest

472
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:45,640
Your old razor mouse has the buttons. Yeah, I've had this this death adder chroma for a really long time

473
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:51,560
I use it as a backup mouse because my logitech was double clicking, but that's because I spilled something on it

474
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
Actually, no

475
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,640
You are a sassy one you're just like me. Oh my god sarcastic sarcastic

476
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,160
Um, no, that was my one previous to this. Um to my other one

477
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,880
No, this one I bought

478
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,360
The other ge 303 I bought off ebay and I asked them

479
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,400
Does it double click and they said no it doesn't

480
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,880
And it did so it was a waste of of like 70 bucks

481
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,960
So I had this one, but this one's like a couple like quite a few years old

482
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:37,320
So that's I'm I know it's just due to age so it's double clicking this razor mouse. So that's why I put another one on my throne

483
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,040
Oh my god, I love you so much. That's literally me

484
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,280
Why are there just feet standing in there

485
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,240
for emergencies, but in here we should be pretty safe

486
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,560
I'm dead

487
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,600
Oh no claptrap

488
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,760

00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,720
The gun is a cabinet. Where's the cabinet? There's a dead dude here. Um

00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,800
It's not the cabinet. Oh there it is

510
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,920
And I don't want to overdose on like allergy pills or cold medicine

511
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,520
What is this?

512
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,840
I don't know what I'm picking up

513
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,080

550
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,880

583
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000

Fia keep the food in your mouth

599
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,600
She's like looking over to the side and accidentally throwing it on the floor. Thankfully boomie will just eat it

600
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,480
Crunch crunch crunch

601
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I

602
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:07,720
Don't know if you guys remember that like video of that cat that's like

603
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,720
Sticks its head into a giant thing of kibble

604
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:17,880
It just like has its mouth like unhinged and like tries to grab it all. That's literally Fia right now

605
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,880
Oh

606
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:30,360
Hi, if you're new here, my name is Shibi and my cat Fia she's disabled. So I have to um

607
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,680
Well, she's like

608
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,800
she's

609
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,240
She's a weird autoimmune disease where she gets paralyzed temporarily

610
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,120
Um, because her mind can't communicate to her body to move. So I have to like

611
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,760
Feed her myself

612
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,160
But she's doing a lot better. She takes medication for it. So she just had a little bit of a flare up

613
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,360
Um, she could kind of move the front half of her body right now

614
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,920
And I hope that her back legs follow suit. This is the longest it's taken for her to um

615
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,440
To recover from it

616
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,960
My cat eats sideways

617
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,760
She's getting better each day. Yeah, she's doing she's doing good

618
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,760
I give her her meds three times a day

619
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,640
um

620
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,440
She also gets a steroid to help with that

621
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,360
She is a good cat. She's a very good girl

622
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,840
Although it was really funny

623
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:31,400
I was laughing at her because and I really shouldn't have because I know she was just scared

624
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,120
so

625
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,360
Fia doesn't have like the best like grip strength with her like mouth like she can't really like bite

626
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,240
But like I was when I was giving her a bath because she had made a little bit of a mess of herself last time

627
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,000
She's the bathroom

628
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,520
um

629
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,520
She was just going ah like she was like

630
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,880
Like because she was so mad that I was like giving her a bath

631
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,080
And then when I was I picked her up to dry her off. She tried to like bite my hand, but it looked like

632
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,080
Do you know that?

633
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,520
Do you know that tick talk of that girl like holding up that cat and it kind of just like

634
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,360
Just like wiggles a lot and tries to bite her in her arms. She's just sitting standing sitting there

635
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,520
Just like are you done? And it's just like it's this black and white cat. I think

636
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,480
It's really fun because she's trying to do that, but she can't move

637
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,240
So she's like trying to move to bite me and I'm like ma'am

638
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,520
I know you're mad right now, but you smelled

639
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:32,840
And I have to wash you and I know you just want me to release you but you need a bath here you go

640
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,920
And it was like a very like it was it wasn't like a bite bite. It was just like let me go

641
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,840
Are you already done eating here and you want some water do you want to wash it down with some wawa?

642
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,240
Or you want to wash it down some ranch because they have some ranch next to me as well for you if you would like some ranch

643
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Here you go

644
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
I

645
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,120
Don't walk over an inch

646
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,960
Yes, I call water wawa

647
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:27,880
Chug chug chug chug she's doing a keg stand right now you guys can't see

01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:43,160
Hey done here looks like you're thinking about it. Okay. He makes like little sucking noises. It's funny

649
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,400
Damn girl you thirsty

650
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,320
I literally tried to give her water when I woke up if she wasn't interested now

651
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,320
She's suddenly interested in water

652
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,040
Yes, the appetite and like the interest in food is a great sign

653
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:20,120
Boomi boomi, please boomi stop eating her food boomi. I will blow on you

654
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:30,520
He doesn't like to be blown on I discovered this recently he doesn't like to have his face face blown on

655
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:38,360
That's the only because of my hands are full. I'm holding fia and the water so I can't like move him

656
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,680
So I have to blow on him

657
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,480
Fia you look so funny

658
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:52,520
Also, yeah fia has a really goofy looking face because her face when her face also gets paralyzed and uh, it's like someone someone has a stroke

659
01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:00,040
So like half of her face is paralyzed right now. So she's like one big eye and one small eye and she's like extra cross-eyed

660
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:07,160
But I love her. I love her little goofiness. You have food on your belly here. Let me get that for you

661
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,480
You want to eat it?

01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,480
Are you gonna eat for my hand?

663
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,160
You haven't eaten a lot

664
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,840
Do you not like this flavor?

665
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,520

Well, you did actually have a pretty big lunch. She like when I um

668
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,760
Before I fell asleep I fed her and she ate a lot

669
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,680
Are you done?

670
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,640
Do you need to use the bathroom?

671
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,480
Actually, you know what? I'll put you right next to me because I have the bed

672
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,240
And if you wiggle a lot or meow, I'll know you have to use the bathroom

673
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,560
You're gonna hear her squeak when I move her. Don't worry. She's not in pain

674
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,360
She's just letting me know that she doesn't like she's just doesn't like being picked up. Well, not she likes being picked up, but

675
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,120
How bad didn't you have no use of your body and someone just is moving you around constantly you're gonna go?

676
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,880
Are you mad at me

677
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,080
Can I have a kiss

678
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,920
You're not giving me a kiss. Okay, but you're giving let me give you a trim scratchies

679
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,280
Okay, and he gave me a little purr

681
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,960

682
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,880
Hi

683
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,040
Oh

684
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,600
My eye it's just

685
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,520
She's

686
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,520
She's just burying herself in the bed

687
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,560
Kiss denied

688
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,560
I know she didn't give me a kiss. Can you believe this?

689
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,280
She loves to give kisses

690
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,760
She doesn't want to give me a kiss

691
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,520
So I think she's still mad at me for giving her a bath girl. Are you trying to suffocate yourself?

692
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,200
She shoved her head inside of her bed and again, I'm like it looks like she's trying to

693
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,160
Stop trying to commit sweet say doll

694
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,640
I'm kidding. She's fine. Um, let me blow my nose

695
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,960
Because I napped for so long I might stream this for a bit

696
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:40,200
And because I my my sleep schedule is gonna be messed up

697
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,800
I need to put my chair for her

698
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,080
Okay, now I'm sitting up

699
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,720
Hi, oh you're licking your paw paws

700
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:01,240
Oh, I couldn't fall asleep for a little bit because like she was just licking the bed. I don't know if you guys are going

701
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,360
He's like constantly licking her bed

702
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,440
I'm like, why are you licking your bed? Like there's nothing

703
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
Boomi go away

704
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,880
You cannot have this

705
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,920
It is not your food. It is Fia's food

706
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,160
I'm hiding it

707
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,840
Are you trying to steal a french fry?

708
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,560
Well, you can have a french fry. That's actually fine

709
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,600
Here, do you want a french fry? Have a french fry mister. Stop trying to lick the ranch. I don't think you can eat ranch

710
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,840
Here you want this?

711
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,240
Go on

712
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,280
He licks it so gingerly. He's like

713
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,080
Like so soft

714
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,320
Here take the french fry

715
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,280
There you go. No, you dropped it. Go grab it. Take it with you

716
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,160
Take it to go

717
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,320
Go on

718
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,600
Take take your french fry to go here. I'll throw it on the floor for you because you don't like eating a pie. Go get it

719
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,120
There's no tenders to be had I can't give him a tender if there's none

720
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,960
Boomi would probably just throw it up because he'd eat it so fast

721
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,960
Oh

722
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,120
Fia, do you want french fry?

723
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,440
Here you go. Fia, would you like a fry?

724
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,480
Oh no

725
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,560
Oh, I like sneezed and now I have like a burp hiccup suck in my throat thing

726
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:50,520
She's eating her fry. Boomi you can't come back for another fry. You got a fry

727
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,880

729
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:04,680
One of my cats will know. Yeah, boomi likes vegetables. He likes to eat bean sprouts. He likes cabbage

730
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,560
Um, he he also likes arugula as well, which is very funny to me

731
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,280
Uh

732
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,320
Excuse me. That was for my sneeze and the burp that I was telling you about

733
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,480
I was stuck in my chest

734
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,520
Is there any food? I don't know. Boomi doesn't like um anything minty

735
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,280
He hates the smell of mint

736
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,040
Him and Fia hate the smell of mint because it's very strong to them

737
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
Is

738
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,800
Eating as much grass that would be boomi. He would just eat grass

739
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,000
Uh, boomi ate a beetle the other day and it was really grossed out

740
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:50,120
Uh, he ate a fly the other day and because like a fly got in after I opened the balcony door

741
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,840
And I'm like, can you not like get worms from some random fly eat?

742
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,840

Why is it wearing that

744
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,920
Why did it appear where it threw the car

745
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,520
It's very hard to dogs

746
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,720
Oh, what is it what the fuck is the gravity of this place?

747
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,440
This gun sucks

748
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,400
Is it stuck?

749
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,280
I think it's stuck

750
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,080
Well, that works out for me

751
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,920

01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,960

913
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:53,800
So, I don't think I thought that's the story. You know, I'll do this optional mission

914
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,160
Is it does that mean I have to teleport all the way over there?

915
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,080
Thank you

916
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,200

01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,920
It's sorted alphabetically

923
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,800
It's saying I'm already there

924
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,440
I have to walk back

925
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,320
Why it said I could fast travel

926
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:25,480

927
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:34,200

01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,360
Please hold

933
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:30,360

01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:37,640
How are you hitting me? Okay, let me just shock on it

1002
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:59,000
Oh, you're so short I just aim above you

1003
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,720
Oh

1004
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,680
Can I have like a little bit more health?

1005
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,080
Can I

1006
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,040
Okay

1007
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:33,400
Of course for melee the safe house power box stopped working I quit my new sorry hold on

1008
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,720
I'm I have to do something before I speak to you

1009
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,320
Well, there's this interesting skill tree. Um, actually let me what?

1010
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,880
Is this an ak?

1011
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,560
Holy crap, let's try it

1012
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,080
Can I

1013
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,560
I have a lot of fucking ammo for it

1014
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,320
This reminds me of a hand cannon

1015
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:08,280
Oh, I like the little animation I do when I put it away

1016
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,720
Leave guns here. It'd be funny if there was a gun inside

1017
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:19,320
Um, is there any health nearby help?

1018
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,720
Oh

1019
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:29,720
At least gravity is pretty forgiving here health

1020
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,040
I don't know what that is health if you please help

1021
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,240

01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:01,240
The health the syringe. How do I get up there?

1025
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,360
I can open it up

1026
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,760
Can I glitch it so I can open it?

1027
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,560
Did I pick it up?

1028
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,600
I just want to know how to get up there

1029
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,480
I

1030
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:21,160
Watch the barrels the barrels. What's about the barrels? What's about the barrels?

1031
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,240
You really I am

1032
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,680

1033
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,680
These barrels

1034
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:33,160
Oh, I have a grenade. You know how a grenade press G to throw grenade

1035
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,120
Uh, if I stand here

1036
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,840
Do I get health?

1037
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,400
No, this is not how this works

1038
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,120
Is there a dude?

1039
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
There is a dude

1040
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,280

01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,280
I'm assuming that is the elevator what I

1043
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:59,560
Hold on

1044
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,960
Are you kidding me? What is the health?

1045
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,840
Oh

1046
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,440

01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:16,760
Coot oh corrosive barrel interesting

1048
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:23,880
Can I open doors? No, I am too mentally enough to open a door. I am full

1049
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:33,240
Look at my current objective, okay, I'm up there

1050
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:41,000
Like I have to do something over there. Jeez the map looks a lot bigger than it actually is

1051
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,360
Why is there so many?

1052
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,080
What is up with that

01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,320
He's called me a cunt

1054
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,760
This is a cool gun

1055
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's like an auto

1056
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,920
It's like an auto acre which is very interesting

1057
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:25,160
I was hoping that was an explosive barrel, but it's not hold on my eyes at you. I feel like

1058
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,360
Hello

1059
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:35,400
Is it okay overheat? I don't seem like it

1060
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,920
At least the AI is bad

1061
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:51,960
At least there's no like recoil control. I was like am I gonna have to is that like what is that?

Um, am I gonna have to like crouch like it's fucking CS?

01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,360
Oh

01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,280
You're gonna choke and stroke my lifeless body

1065
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:28,360
Are you alive? Oh, okay. Oh give me the health. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You really died for my sins. Um, can I not pick this up?

1066
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,800

1067
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:38,680
Excuse me

Because I have no health again

1073
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:03,080
You're not ready for me

1074
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,960
I'm not ready for you

1075
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:17,560
Sorry, I'm looking at your messages in the chat everyone

1076
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:23,720
Yeah, the maps look so much bigger than they are and I think I'm just so used to freaking Elden Ring that I'm like

1077
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,360
Oh, this must be a long trek, but it's not

1078
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,360
I

1079
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:42,280
Well, oh ladder. Oh nice

1080
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,600
Are you good?

1081
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,520
Can I just

1082
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,520
Can't believe this

1083
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,560
Did he say that I can't believe this

1084
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:10,440
What the hell is it me tweeting about I get notice for all the girls on my phone and I just see her say

1085
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:15,080
I'm gonna stop walking by people's windows and looking in for something. What did she say?

1086
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:22,040
I gotta stop looking through those windows while walking by I used to be fun

1087
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,040
But I just made eye contact with

1088
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:32,440
Can you recommend your favorite restaurants and your favorite food from there?

1089
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:37,560
Hi, so I'm actually not a fan of vTubers. You're actually the first vTuber I've seen

1090
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:42,600
I get that chat that tweet in or not tweet um that message in my chat all the time

1091
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,200
Which is really funny to me

1092
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,560
What I'm just

1093
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,840

01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:05,080
See just she never usually tweets in such quick succession

1095
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,800
People actually do that I do that I'll walk by and look into someone's window

1096
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,880
Oh

1097

Anybody gonna match my freak anybody gonna match my me

Oh, I feel like I have to sneeze again. I can't

1101
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:42,920
I don't know what that is. I'm just picking everything up

1102
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,840
Okay, someone said there is health below

1103
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:54,920
There is a little plus sign that doesn't really make any sense to me

1104
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,800
What's up with that

1105
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I

1106
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,920
Hell oh

1107
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:28,440
Um

1108
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,480
Can I have that back?

1109
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:37,560
Cheese it looks like it's gonna fucking hit me. Oh cheese

1110
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:44,360
Yippie hey, I can open doors

Actually like look that I don't need the repeater or this one

Whole beans brother

1139
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:13,560
What else do I need to do

1140
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:16,840
Oh

1141
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:19,560
More money

1142
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,920
I don't really need that

1143
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,800
Heavy repeater

1144
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,760
I'll take that and I'll fucking sell it

1145
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:58,200
I'm barely holding on. Oh, what's up here?

1146
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,160
Huh

1147
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:16,200
All right sick brother

1148
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:23,240
This is wobbly wobbly wobble wobble wobble

1149
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,400
Bye marie. Have a good night

1150
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:30,840
Oh

1151
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:51,320
Running running running we are running in a rich man's what what the fuck

1152
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:56,440
That was weird

1153
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,400
Is something just moved on its own

1154
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:06,200
And me and boomi just got freaked out by it that was so weird. Why did it do that?

1155
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,160
It's ghosts

1156
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:15,480
Boomi it's okay handsome boy and I'd probably something just

1157
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:20,440
Tension built over time you've caused it to spring up

1158
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,160
Oh

1159
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,920
Oh, I get a sting like a bee

1160
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:46,920
Oh my they usually they literally use the word midget like

1161
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,680
That's funny

1162
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,760
Not politically correct anymore

1163
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:57,480
Uh borderlands

1164
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,520
Okay

1165
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,720
Or they're saying dwarves

1166
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:29,000
I did change it to the newer games. That's funny

1167
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:40,520
Um, let me track

1168
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:46,360
I'm not doing that. Oh wait, that's a story mission. This is an optional mission

1169
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:49,640
This seems like it gives me a new shotgun in a rifle

1170
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:54,040
So I'll do that

1171
02:00:55,720 --> 02:01:00,840
It's a hat of a gentleman and yet it's missing something some je ne sais quoi

1172
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I literally killed like 50 of them

1173
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,800
Why are you walking away while you're talking to me?

1174
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:19,640
All right, I gotta do it a couple times. I suppose

1175
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:22,120
it's uh

1176
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:24,360
Ammo dump. Okay. Well, I'm good on ammo

1177
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,760
Wait

1178
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,040
In a chronistic

1179
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:49,800
Last day with a melee, okay, then I'll use then I'll use the rifle. What the how do I get out of here?

1180
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,760
I'm stuck in here in this place

1181
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,680
Help

1182
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,680
Tell me I can't

1183
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:03,080
I can jump up here

1184
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:05,080
Come on

1185
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,680
Sorry, I missed a little dumb

1186
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:21,000
Last hit with a melee got it

1187
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:25,240
Why are they so far away? I'll go do these ones over here first

1188
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:32,600
Sick grenade jumps what do I like throw a grenade and

1189
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:44,360
Oh, doesn't do anything throwing grenade. That was very I don't know what the accent is there. He doesn't sound like ng. That's for sure

1190
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:51,640
Zenyatta tell him where he can stick his arrows in his quiver. No

1191
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:06,840
I'm trying to stab it

1192
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:12,840
I apologize if I wasn't clear enough. You see you need to kill the bully mong with a melee attack in order to harvest

1193
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:16,680
It's fair. Sorry. I'm kind of maybe I shouldn't use the incinerate

1194
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:22,200
Do I what am I supposed to do? Oh

1195
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:26,120
Sorry, I was not reading

1196
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:32,280
What the fuck am I in code leo go? What's this?

1197
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:40,280
I have to kill it any to get back up very interesting. All right, it's fine genji's back. Um

1198
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:46,600
Enjoy the new you that's cool

1199
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,760
Again, I love it when games like incorporate

1200
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:56,040
Normal gameplay stuff until like lore or make make it have a reason for it

1201
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,760
It's I think it's very clever

1202
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:02,280
Okay, I'm not gonna use this gun. I will be using

1203
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:05,880
Uh this one then to get the

1204
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:15,160
I need healing I require healing

1205
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:19,480
I need healing

1206
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:23,560
Be right back

1207
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:29,400
Oh, I like how there's still shit here. That's so interesting. Huh interesting. Uh

1208
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:35,320
Oh my god, you're so huge

1209
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:46,220
Sorry, I'm just trying to get them knocked down. Oh my god, hold on

1210
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,640
Uh

1211
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:06,360
Can I you're literally gonna kill me hold on let me just back up a little bit. Why are you so fast?

1212
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,280
Oh my god

1213
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,080
They're like right on my ass

1214
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:25,800
Oh

1215
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:33,000
Fucking ammo. Oh see it didn't wait. There you go

1216
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:45,160
I've just four times I don't know about that brother

1217
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:55,640
Oh my god, you're close to death

1218
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:15,160
Uh, I couldn't even grab the other one

1219
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:17,880
I

1220
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:24,120
Music's really good in this game

1221
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,800
Oh my god

1222
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:48,600
Stupid with it like make a mohawk out of it or something. That's cute

1223
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:04,680
Food's with their fur. I can't see I can't really use the weapon

1224
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:09,080
There you go. Is there any more

1225
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:17,160
No

1226
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:26,040
No

1227
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:31,320
Okay, I have to go to a different spot. I wish you guys would drop health. That'd be great

1228
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,320
Oh

1229
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:47,480
Got around the whole fucking way back over here, what is I don't understand. What is this plus sign?

1230
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:51,080
I feel like I should be able to do something with that

1231
02:07:55,800 --> 02:08:00,200
Health question mark no health question mark

1232
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:04,280
No, but I could use some ammo so that's still helpful

1233
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:14,120
This health vending machine is it up top is that what it oh, that's probably what it's saying

1234
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:16,840
No, fuck I missed

1235
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:24,520
I shot and then I missed I shot and then I missed

1236
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:28,600
I see

1237
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:42,520
Oh the lever's right there. I'm actually stupid at least I can use for an excuse that I'm just not feeling good

1238
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:03,320
How many can I pick up

1239
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:16,200
Can I fall down from there and get fall damage I'm kind of I'm kind of tempted to just what if I just

1240
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,040
Little

1241
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:23,800
Oh, are you serious fucking elevator then

1242
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:33,960
I

1243
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:40,120
What the fuck are these oh

1244
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:50,520
Oh, those are annoying can I go in water

1245
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:55,560
Water's cold

1246
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:58,280
Ah

1247
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,440
Can you all leave me alone? Thank you

1248
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:09,800
Water's spicy it was a bit spicy. Oh my god, my

1249
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:23,080
Those look like barnacles on the side of those things come on off. Oh, that's cool

1250
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:31,160
That muscle looks so neat back in 2012 it still does to be on like this game holds up graphically because it's so stylized

1251
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:40,520
If I have it if it's a monglet, can I do it? Oh perfect monglets are easier. That's for sure

1252
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:47,640
No, I didn't mean to you know what I'm just gonna kill you

1253
02:10:54,040 --> 02:11:00,600
I'll kill the monglet

1254
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:09,320
Monglets are easier to grab

1255
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:14,280
Yes, I want the sniper rifle

1256
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:20,600
Boots with the fur

1257
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:26,360
Sell shading at the immortal graphics

1258
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:33,000
Yeah, it does get so safe. Well, but then everybody

1259
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:40,280
Like once like the stylized look right now is the fortnite style because everything looks like fortnite style

1260
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,240
It's like that

1261
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,680
it's like

1262
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:46,520
It's almost

1263
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,520
I'm trying to think of what to compare it to

1264
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:50,680
It's like an update version

1265
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:54,360
No, it's not I was gonna say it's an updated version of like

1266
02:11:57,560 --> 02:12:04,360
Team fortress, but I don't quite think so team fortress is still the characters are uniquely stylized in my opinion

1267
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:10,920
Whereas all of the characters in fortnite look samey they all have same face syndrome

1268
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:25,560
Thanks vault hunter. You've helped a foolish old man look far more badass than he deserves

1269
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:28,680
I'm referring to myself

1270
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:38,680
You look pretty badass. I'm happy I gave it to you. I'm not gonna lie

1271
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:43,080

I completed that

1280
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:35,640
Oh, I'm good. I'm I don't think I want to do that one

1281
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:37,720
I

1282
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:45,560
Claptrap she's a mohawk fester game if you give it to him really oh

1283
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:49,160
I kind of wish I gave it to claptrap for that

1284
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:55,080
That's really funny, but I wanted the um, I wanted the sniper rifle since I already have a shotgun

1285
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:58,040
I

1286
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:06,520
Kind of want that hat can I get can I use some bully mong for to get my give myself a cool little like

Oh, hi rena

1293
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:33,880
I'm so sorry rena. I cannot pet you right now though, especially because I have my allergies and you'll just

1294
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:41,640
Use aspirate my allergies further. You're very cute though. You can sit on my lap. I just can't pet you as much

1295
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:46,280
What this guy's

1296
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:49,480
Oh rena you're falling down

1297
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:52,360

1299
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:04,520

Now does someone just have a fucking nade at me

1301
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:13,240
I

1302
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:22,360
Just get a little bit closer. Shall we where's the other guy?

1303
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:27,640
Oh

1304
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:32,440
Why does this do I feel like this isn't doing anything to you

1305
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:43,240
Yeah

1306
02:15:55,880 --> 02:16:02,040
Piss for brains, yeah, that's pretty hard. I'll give you some more thoughts. Yeah

1307
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:07,800
But stallion

1308
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:13,240
What

1309
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:22,440
What's the exclamation point is that cloud trap? Oh

1310
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:31,640
Whatever happened to lane up here. Oh, it's an optional mission

1311
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:37,240
I don't really care about a pistol right now. But thank you

1312
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:43,240
But stallion's the best source

1313
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:54,760
Clap trap is the same a voice actor

1314
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:01,720
Used for clap trap in the movie rena's licking my hand while I'm trying to play this is great

1315
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:06,520
No, you know what it should do whatever that is

1316
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:14,600
Are you just gonna die? Okay

1317
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:22,920
I like I like the uh using the environment

1318
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:34,440
Hold on I'm trying to open this don't know what I just grabbed in there

1319
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:43,880
I'm just wasting ammo because I thought it was an explosive arrow

1320
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:47,480
Can I

1321
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:51,000
Hello, can I not fucking climb am I mentally inept?

1322
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I

1323
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,480
The killer rotters just take these I guess I'm just shooting over his head

1324
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:26,920
Is a different voice actor they use jack black in the movie. What the hell?

1325
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:36,200
Is everybody dead well, I'm gonna fucking loot shit then because I need ammo

1326
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:48,680
I don't know what this is. What the fuck is that? What is this? Is this a site for this? What is

1327
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:52,920
What the hell why did I just

1328
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:59,480
Why did it switch the weapon? You know what I kind of like it. I'll keep it

1329
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:03,560
This is kind of weird, but you know

1330
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:07,560
Hold on hold on clap trap. I'm kind of

1331
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:09,560

1339
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:17,960
Shut up clock trap for a second. Okay. I'm definitely supposed to make this jump and I didn't because I thought there might be a ladder

1340
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:20,280
Okay, let me try it again. Oh

1341
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000

02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
It's I thought you said poo poo

1357
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:06,040
Boom and his brother boom

1358
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:08,040
Ready to blow

1359
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:14,040
Big bertha

1360
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:19,800
Incoming badass. Why do you you're literally just I need health or I'm gonna die

1361
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:23,640
I will not survive this

1362
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,040
Precisely

1363
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:34,440
Oh what the hell brother

1364
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:38,040
Oh

1365
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:53,480
There's nothing in here I can't kill anyone because I'm in a fucking boss battle

1366
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:55,480
I

1367
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:04,520
Crap I was almost an idiot

1368
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:09,240
Listen, I deserve to be serviced. There's nothing wrong with that

1369
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:22,440
Oh sick

1370
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,720
Oh

1371
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:35,960
Does it reset the mission? Oh, no, it doesn't very interesting

1372
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:37,960
I

1373
02:23:51,720 --> 02:24:00,680
Can't die this good night. I can't get up. Please hold. Please hold

1374
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:03,320
Oh

1375
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:13,240
My god, I literally fucking hate the vaulting in this game. They're called vaults things for a reason and I can't even fucking get up

1376
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:19,640
Hey

1377
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:25,960
Uh, this doesn't seem like a good idea

1378
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:33,560
Oh

1379
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:39,800
And I need you

1380
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,200
At least you turn around really slowly

1381
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:03,640
Oh, you're still alive

1382
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:15,160
High fire with fire

1383
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:19,880
Oh, but you can give a fucking jump pack like you're fucking over that

1384
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:33,320
Oh

1385
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:52,520
I'm not getting critical

1386
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:58,920
I wish I could slide I'm realizing how much I like sliding as a mechanic

1387
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:02,920
I

1388
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,320
Stop fucking jumping around Jesus Christ

1389
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:16,760
Let's see how this works

1390
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:20,120
I don't like having to scope

1391
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:23,880
Uh, actually please hold I need to

1392
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:28,120
A lot of guns

1393
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:39,960
And there's maybe I can get close to you at the shoddy. I'm not strong enough to do that

1394
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:49,400
Boom headshot

1395
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:51,400
Shot

1396
02:26:57,320 --> 02:27:02,280
I've earned a skill point am I winning I don't have to shoot him

1397
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:06,280
You're gonna shoot the whole cannon. Oh

1398
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:10,200
I'm just I'm just here having a good time to sit in here happily

1399
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:17,160
Sorry, hold on. I have to level my skills. Uh, you can just sit there and die one shot one kill

1400
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:19,880
Excuse me

1401
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:24,360
Half a graph. Oh, I can pull I can have mirage

1402
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:29,400
I can be a decepticon

1403
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:39,400
Press F to create a helmet and vanish for a few seconds as longer you're visible the more damage your next attack deals

1404
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:42,200
But ending a visibility sooner results in a shorter deception

1405
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:45,080
Okay, interesting

1406
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:51,320
Oh, what the four did you come from? What the fuck?

1407
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:01,080
I think I what am I throwing?

1408
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:17,080
Oh

1409
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:29,160
When it runs out

1410
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:44,200
That's so interesting to me the fact the fact I can't pick this up there's

1411
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:48,120
Interesting my inventory is now full

1412
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:06,440
Well, I can get a rid a lot of these, uh, I prefer to sell them

1413
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:19,880
I don't like this gun this target aim shot kind of sucks in my opinion

1414
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:34,840
I think the one with the largest thing I'm a lover

1415
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:37,160
Oh

1416
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:46,360
The gun my personal gun makes it to the okay, it's torque guns that do that

1417
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:55,720
Oh, I hate that I don't like it when you reload, but you actually like lose the bullets

1418
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:59,640
If you didn't like if you didn't like fully empty the clip, um

1419
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:02,840
Or the mag whatever

1420
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:07,080
Okay

1421
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:09,400
Badass token

1422
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:13,480
Oh, um

1423
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:17,240
We were mainly damaged to be honest

1424
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:21,640
I will also do what

1425
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:27,640
Okay

1426
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:30,280
Oh

1427
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:35,160
Let's do

1428
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:41,720
Yeah sure

1429
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:55,080
How do I change my uh

1430
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:57,160
How do I change my outfit color?

1431
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:00,760
How do I change me? Oh, that's cool

1432
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:05,240
And move it around. That's actually really cool. That's a very intuitive

1433
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:09,080
UI actually I very much like that

1434
02:31:10,360 --> 02:31:14,120
And if you'll look at it, I like that a lot actually

1435
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:20,360
I have to find a station. Okay. Oh

1436
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:24,120
Okay

1437
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:27,400
Cool

1438
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:29,560
Other guns that I should be

1439
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:32,920
Holding

1440
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:40,360
Should I hold this so I can sell it? Oh, yeah, this is 46. This one's 31

1441
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,920
Cool

1442
02:31:49,240 --> 02:31:51,240
Hmm

1443
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:55,880
What's up trap

1444
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:01,560
Do any of them say fuck

1445
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:07,960
This candle

1446
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:10,440
Now

1447
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:20,600
Can I shoot clap trap

1448
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:28,920
Yes

1449
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:31,640
When it's okay

1450
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:38,280
The fact I can't shoot again. Okay, I was gonna say

1451
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:40,280
Okay

1452
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:02,680
This is fun psycho midget. Yeah, that's a that's a freeze

1453
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:13,320
They're like because he did a good job in the boss battle now, we're just gonna give you a freebie

1454
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:17,800
Anymore

1455
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:22,600
It's pretty cute I like that

1456
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:27,080
What do you got for me?

1457
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:29,240
I

1458
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:39,480
Can gun

1459
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:50,200
I killed him wait, did I kill clap trap?

1460
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:54,600
Did I legit kill crop trap

1461
02:33:57,080 --> 02:33:59,080
Did

1462
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:07,080
No, did I

1463
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:11,240
Because I'll actually be upset if I kill the clap trap. I will restart my game

1464
02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:19,960
He's gone for fuck off. Why would you say that? Why would you lie to me? Why would you lie to your madam?

1465
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:22,280
Don't lie to me

1466
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:24,280
Soaring dragon

1467
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:26,440
Okay

1468
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:33,400
Oh, wait, he's still alive. Thank god. Um, let me

1469
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:39,720
Explose like a grenade when I load it. It's so funny

1470
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:46,680
I'm not really familiar with the damage

1471
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:48,840
rating

1472
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:52,520
23 times 2 is this 13 times 13. So I'm a little

1473
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:58,040
It's very interesting how these work. Let me just

1474
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:04,360
I do less damage

1475
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:11,960
I can't use this yet. Can I

1476
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:17,160
Oh, yes, I can

1477
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:27,400
Yeah, this is 13 pellets. Okay, interesting

1478
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:37,160
Oh, okay understood

1479
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:43,160
Yepy

1480
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:51,080
Where the fuck are you?

1481
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:54,920
Shut up, okay

1482
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:58,280
Is this the checkpoint

1483
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Where do they

1484
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:06,040
I'm gonna let that guy kill that

1485
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:12,920
Because those things are actually really fucking annoying. What the hell

1486
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:18,520
They sound like the dragons from game of thrones

1487
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:25,480
These are hard those are hard to lead you literally have to spam it

1488
02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:28,920
Oh

1489
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:31,160
Oh, that's cute

1490
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:36,120
Oh any more

1491
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:54,520
Give me your fucking why do you guys just have money hanging around?

1492
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:03,320
Oh trash

1493
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:09,560
You may look at guns that have slag I want to use them much for like high level endgame stuff

1494
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:17,400
Okay, I understand you got yeeted. I blew him to the top of that ship. What the fuck

1495
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:20,760
That's so funny

1496
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:35,080
Where is the shooting

1497
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:51,160
Oh

1498
02:37:55,240 --> 02:37:57,240
I can't really tell where

1499
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:00,680
Where that I see that a muzzle flash, but like where is he?

1500
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:04,200
Can you come over here?

1501
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
I don't think I can wall bang you

1502
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:10,760
Thank you. That's all I've always wanted

1503
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:17,800
Oh, thank you

1504
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:20,520
Are you still alive?

1505
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:33,560
Oh

1506
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:42,040
What that I don't know why my favorite part of games is just finding loot. I don't know why it's just very enjoyable for me

1507
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:46,920
Magic you could like find loot like this when you just walk around

1508
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:51,320
And actually let me back up

1509
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:02,760
Okay, interesting I didn't know they do I grow

1510
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:04,760
Oh

1511
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:25,960
I'm just standing in the middle everything sniping is my favorite pastime

1512
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:28,840
Oh

1513
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:35,320
Sorry, I'm trying to help you and put you out of your misery, but you keep moving

1514
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:40,280
There's another one, where are you?

1515
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:46,920
There's another one I just saw you where'd you go?

1516
02:39:56,920 --> 02:39:58,920
Oh, I missed

1517
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:04,600
I love sniping colors make your brain happy

1518
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:19,080
How do you say my glasses?

1519
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:21,080
Back

1520
02:40:24,280 --> 02:40:26,280
That's interesting

1521
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:30,920
I like the the fucking um

1522
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Dial oh

1523
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:39,800
I will take both of these. Thank you very much

1524
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,200
I

1525
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:58,520
Why am I let me just hit fire. Oh my god, it's hard to hit fire with this. Thank you

1526
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:06,520
What the fuck why are there so many little guys?

1527
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:10,920
It's also really weird

1528
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:25,080
The dialogue is honestly very amusing in this game. I am enjoying myself. Ooh, can I eat this?

1529
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:29,800
It's fish. I love fish. Oh, look how fucking goofy it looks

1530
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Let me um

1531
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:43,000
Let me see. I want to switch to one of the other guns. Oh already

1532
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:48,680
Oh, oh hold on

1533
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:59,480
Can I double shield what is oh these are other things? Um, well, I'm just gonna drop this

1534
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:01,800
Uh

1535
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:09,560
Can I that's 78 can I switch this one and then can I drop that?

1536
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:17,000
And then I can pick up this one and I'll save the other one

1537
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:25,480
Uh, these are the shield lead and shield

1538
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:31,000
I'm going to how much is this 33?

1539
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:39,640
This is very crazy, Texas long rider

1540
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:45,240
Fires as fast as you can pull the trigger interesting

1541
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:53,080
Yeah, I like the the concept of like the different gun makers like I'm actually really very much enjoying this

1542
02:42:55,960 --> 02:42:57,960
Oh

1543
02:42:58,280 --> 02:43:04,520
I'm not saying there's anything wrong. I'm just like I'm wondering I'm wondering what the the plot reason for so many little guys is

1544
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:07,160
um

1545
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:09,880
This seems to be a mark for that just to find this accuracy

1546
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:14,600
I'm going to call it the Texas long rider because that seems fucking crazy

1547
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:23,640
I like the weapons. They're very cool. I love the design. I'm I'm actually really liking borderlands

1548
02:43:26,040 --> 02:43:29,480
I think I like it. I'm sorry. I think I'm enjoying it more than follow

1549
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:38,440
Not although I like follow is it really fun, but because I just prefer skyrim. Um

1550
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:43,880
This is a very interesting gun

1551
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:49,160
This is insane

1552
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:53,720
Very interesting gun

1553
02:43:56,040 --> 02:44:02,760
It's over here. Oh nifty. Can I buy this?

1554
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:09,560
I can't buy right now

1555
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:14,040
Fine, what the fuck

1556
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:19,960
You know, I should back up because I actually I feel like I should be sniping these dudes

1557
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:28,440
There we go

1558
02:44:34,040 --> 02:44:36,040
Is he still alive?

1559
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:39,480
All right

1560
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:44,840
Sniper is pretty powerful. Um, let's see

1561
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:51,720
Can I pick this up? Oh my inventory is full

1562
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:57,320
Okay, now we're getting to the point where I am

1563
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:04,440
Getting more green weapons. So I'm starting not to care about anything. I do like the shotgun though. So I hold on to it

1564
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:18,840
Sometimes I'll click enter in it or maybe because I'm clicking E

1565
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:24,440
Damn it

1566
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:29,560
I'm sorry 74

1567
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:40,120
Yeah, if you die while sniping that's a good point

1568
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:44,600
I have a skill point. Oh

1569
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:46,840
I

1570
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Weapon swap speed

1571
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
You massively increased damage

1572
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:05,000
Oh, I like that although I don't really I'm more of a distant because I'm since I'm playing more of a sniper because he's an assassin

1573
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,480
I'm gonna be more distant. So I'm gonna do weapon swap

1574
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:10,600
um

1575
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:12,840
I

1576
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:16,360
And then I'll do

1577
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:19,880
I don't know increase the fire rate

1578
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:33,120
What what

1579
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:39,240
Oh, what the hell I didn't even see these

1580
02:46:41,320 --> 02:46:47,240
I literally just saw this and this one and I thought I had to unlock these before I go to these

1581
02:46:48,120 --> 02:46:51,000
Okay, and I didn't even see this behind the fucking thing

1582
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:54,200
Okay, have a good night. Bye

1583
02:46:55,240 --> 02:46:57,400
What time is it? Oh, that's almost all of it

1584
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:01,240
Well, no, I know that for next time

1585
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:05,240
Because then I would increase the critical hit damage

1586
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:15,080
Although I do like the aim city is

1587
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:23,160
Okay, yeah, I didn't see that behind there. I wasn't really looking over there

1588
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:31,560
I still think it's still intuitive, but I'm just not paying attention

1589
02:47:32,040 --> 02:47:34,040
I

1590
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:42,760
I kept thinking this guy was a fucking enemy, but he's just a poor guy poor soul

1591
02:47:43,720 --> 02:47:45,240
Got caught

1592
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:47,240
in the the crossfire

1593
02:47:47,480 --> 02:47:50,120
Sorry, I'm a little sleepy. So my voice is a lot deeper

1594
02:47:57,320 --> 02:47:59,320
I feel like I should hipfire with this

1595
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:04,520
Oh, you're already dead. I'm stuck

1596
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:09,640
Um, maybe not

1597
02:48:12,680 --> 02:48:14,680
Can I crouch I can't crouch in this game

1598
02:48:19,080 --> 02:48:23,480
Her they're shooting from above me like right above me

1599
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:26,440
I

1600
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:33,480
I just um, I'm a little epee. Oh, hi

1601
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:39,320
I'm gonna save my day

1602
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:44,120
Need more sniper ammo

1603
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:57,000
Oh, fuck me. Oh, what's this?

1604
02:48:59,480 --> 02:49:02,600
Hello, what the fuck are these?

1605
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:08,520
What

1606
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:11,240
Hold on I'm doing something

1607
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:19,400
Just like give me a moment. I'm looking at cool shit. This reminds me of apex

1608
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:28,840
That's nifty looking. Where's the other dude? What is he doing? I can't really hit him. He's in a weird spot

1609
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:32,920
All right, we got this

1610
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:43,400
This is a cool-looking pistol, which one's the best throw a nade? Oh, yeah

1611
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:49,080
Ow

1612
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:51,400
Okay, which one should you like?

1613
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:57,400
I know this is 10 years before that you don't have to be fucking condescending dumbass

1614
02:49:58,280 --> 02:50:03,480
Um, I'm just saying the way it opens up just reminds me of that. Uh, which one is the best one?

1615
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:09,080
Take them for value 43

1616
02:50:09,640 --> 02:50:11,480
43

1617
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:12,480
43

1618
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:12,980
43

1619
02:50:12,980 --> 02:50:13,480
43

1620
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:13,980
43

1621
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:14,480
43

1622
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:14,980
43

1623
02:50:14,980 --> 02:50:15,480
43

1624
02:50:15,480 --> 02:50:15,980
43

1625
02:50:15,980 --> 02:50:16,480
43

1626
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:16,980
43

1627
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:17,980
43

1628
02:50:17,980 --> 02:50:18,480
43

1629
02:50:18,480 --> 02:50:18,980
43

1630
02:50:19,220 --> 02:50:20,220
44

1631
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:21,220
55

1632
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:26,100
I'll just grab the one with the most value

1633
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:31,860
Where is

1634
02:50:36,020 --> 02:50:38,020
I hear this guy looks like he happened

1635
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:45,860
What is what are they doing?

1636
02:50:49,060 --> 02:50:53,540
We can talk this through right here. They're beating him up on the ship. Is that the noises?

1637
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:55,540
Oh

1638
02:51:15,380 --> 02:51:18,420
I know there's a way to probably go around but this is actually easier

1639
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:20,420
I

1640
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:28,580
He he he he

1641
02:51:28,580 --> 02:51:33,460
What the fuck is up with the vaulting in this game? I can't do it. Yeah

1642
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:42,260
Okay, maybe I just go around maybe it's not as easy because I was hoping I wouldn't have to like deal with them

1643
02:51:45,860 --> 02:51:47,860
All right, let me just

1644
02:51:48,980 --> 02:51:50,980
I

1645
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:53,300
Did you just get your health back? I don't

1646
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:02,500
Something like that

1647
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:11,780
Sell them at the medical oh good point. I forgot that I can sell them there. I keep thinking I have to sell them at um

1648
02:52:12,740 --> 02:52:14,740
Oh

1649
02:52:14,820 --> 02:52:19,140
At um her wait, where was it did I just run past it I did

1650
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:25,060
What the fuck to where was it guys I mentally ill help

1651
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:29,220
I could just

1652
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:33,700
Oh wait, I never checked these

1653
02:52:35,780 --> 02:52:37,780
Okay

1654
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:44,020
Oh

1655
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:48,740
What I never opened this

1656
02:52:52,980 --> 02:52:54,980
Uh

1657
02:52:56,740 --> 02:53:01,140
I can't take them anymore claptrap. Why are you yelling?

1658
02:53:04,900 --> 02:53:08,420
Yeah, I kept thinking I had to sell them at like ammo places

1659
02:53:08,420 --> 02:53:13,380
Why do you sound like you're right next to me when you're not um

1660
02:53:16,740 --> 02:53:18,740
Oh, I can buy stuff back

1661
02:53:21,220 --> 02:53:24,180
How do I sell oh, okay

1662
02:53:25,380 --> 02:53:31,380
Well, uh, okay. Goodbye. I will miss you shoddy. We were so

1663
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:35,380
Lovely to go there

1664
02:53:38,660 --> 02:53:40,660
I

1665
02:53:48,820 --> 02:53:50,820
Um, let me go grab those other ones

1666
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:55,220
And that sounded kind of creepy

1667
02:54:02,980 --> 02:54:06,020
Oh, I thought I could run up that I cannot

1668
02:54:09,140 --> 02:54:12,740
Wait, how did I get over there? Oh, yeah, that's right. We

1669
02:54:18,180 --> 02:54:22,260
Very smart idea gentlemen, just grab it and go back and buy it

1670
02:54:25,700 --> 02:54:27,700
I mean sell it

1671
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:30,740
The best damage one

1672
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:39,860
It's portable clinic what can I get for you? I don't like the target aim shot so I will sell it. That's fine

1673
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:50,580
I won't be defeated. What the fuck are you talking about dude?

1674
02:54:53,540 --> 02:54:57,860
Um, I kind of want to try out this gun so I won't sell it just yet

1675
02:55:01,700 --> 02:55:03,700
Gernade mods

1676
02:55:08,820 --> 02:55:12,820
Can you I'm gonna sell that and then there were

1677
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:23,300
Which one

1678
02:55:31,460 --> 02:55:34,100
Almost did I can fix that

1679
02:55:35,620 --> 02:55:40,100
Instead of you look lonely. I can fix that. It's almost dead. I can fix that

1680
02:55:40,980 --> 02:55:42,980
um, so

1681
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:45,780
So that one

1682
02:55:46,660 --> 02:55:48,660
So that one

1683
02:55:49,780 --> 02:55:53,700
See you real soon. I'm sure I'll equip that one

1684
02:55:53,700 --> 02:55:55,700
Um

1685
02:56:03,460 --> 02:56:05,460
That's a way to say that um

1686
02:56:18,500 --> 02:56:22,820
Oh, it shows me what I have equipped. Okay. I was worried already

1687
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:25,940
I

1688
02:56:26,260 --> 02:56:28,820
You can mark them. Oh, that's smart. He's a little chuny

1689
02:56:30,740 --> 02:56:34,580
You can't vault in this game only and be able to three you can. Oh, okay gotcha

1690
02:56:38,260 --> 02:56:41,700
You can consume that voice thing in your is under what?

1691
02:56:45,220 --> 02:56:47,720
What's personal I don't even know where the personal thing is

1692
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:56,420
You

1693
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:08,020
The radio thing

1694
02:57:09,060 --> 02:57:11,060
In my

1695
02:57:11,140 --> 02:57:14,100
I don't see anything that looks like a radio because I'm blind

1696
02:57:16,660 --> 02:57:19,140
Oh, if I star it that that makes sense

1697
02:57:21,220 --> 02:57:23,220
You were right over it what?

1698
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:26,260
What do you mean?

1699
02:57:29,460 --> 02:57:31,460
Radio

1700
02:57:32,100 --> 02:57:34,100
I'm so tired

1701
02:57:35,780 --> 02:57:37,780
Radio this

1702
02:57:41,460 --> 02:57:44,420
Madam in your backpack a last item this

1703
02:57:46,020 --> 02:57:48,020
Oh

1704
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:51,860
Wait, what did I just do

1705
02:57:52,820 --> 02:57:54,820
What did I just do I just clicked on it

1706
02:57:59,620 --> 02:58:02,500
Excuse me. I ate it. What is that too?

1707
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:08,020
And now it'll play when I unpause

1708
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:20,660
Oh

1709
02:58:22,820 --> 02:58:24,820
That sounded highly sexual

1710
02:58:29,780 --> 02:58:32,740
Extremely chuny poor schmuck

1711
02:58:39,300 --> 02:58:41,300
I like to play with my toys clearly

1712
02:58:47,620 --> 02:58:51,460
All right, he only speaks in haiku's

1713
02:58:52,580 --> 02:58:59,620
Damn, he's very dumb impressive. He's just like me for real for real. Cut trap. What the fuck is wrong?

1714
02:59:07,220 --> 02:59:09,220
Ah

1715
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:12,420
Where did you even go?

1716
02:59:15,620 --> 02:59:19,860
Oh, there you are. Hold on. Let me sleep. That's not it

1717
02:59:20,820 --> 02:59:24,740
Well, you please hold did he just say will you marry me?

1718
02:59:31,860 --> 02:59:35,940
Bring me a bucket and I'll show you a bucket

1719
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:45,780
This game is very forgiving what the fuck

1720
02:59:50,260 --> 02:59:52,260
Oh

1721
02:59:56,660 --> 03:00:01,060
My god should have reloaded before I did this

1722
03:00:04,580 --> 03:00:07,460
Me thinking I can double jump like I'm in fucking destiny

1723
03:00:12,580 --> 03:00:19,220
I just sound like I'm fucking something. Why do I why do I talk like that? I clap trap

1724
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:22,820
Is

1725
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:28,500
Yes, you can

1726
03:00:31,940 --> 03:00:35,300
Are you serious you can definitely roll up these fucking stairs

1727
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:47,300
Are you dancing? Oh my god, I love him. I truly do actually

1728
03:00:50,420 --> 03:00:52,420
Yeah

1729
03:00:55,300 --> 03:01:00,100
That's a toilet I was gonna try to snipe from the toilet

1730
03:01:02,980 --> 03:01:07,060
Nice don't know why somebody stuck that in there. Maybe they shout it out. You never know

1731
03:01:13,860 --> 03:01:17,540
Oh, yeah everybody just comes out

1732
03:01:19,860 --> 03:01:21,860
Oh, I missed that

1733
03:01:24,580 --> 03:01:26,580
Ow, what the fuck

1734
03:01:29,380 --> 03:01:32,980
Who's shooting me? Oh you you have like some sort of incendiary thing

1735
03:01:35,700 --> 03:01:37,700
Oh

1736
03:01:38,420 --> 03:01:40,420
Shot the barrel next to me I presume

1737
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:43,780
I heard a little guy

1738
03:01:45,220 --> 03:01:47,220
No

1739
03:01:48,020 --> 03:01:50,020
Um

1740
03:01:50,020 --> 03:01:54,180
Where are the controls? It's actually a little bit hard again. I'm to piss off

1741
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:57,940
It's hard for me to navigate things because again, I'm blind. So

1742
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:00,740
There's a goon cave up ahead

1743
03:02:02,020 --> 03:02:04,260
He is baby no stairs

1744
03:02:08,900 --> 03:02:10,900
What am I doing, uh, because I see

1745
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:13,620
Does that mean up?

1746
03:02:13,620 --> 03:02:16,820
I feel like that means up. What the fuck can I like?

1747
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:21,300
No, okay, just waste bullets

1748
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:32,260
This part is kind of yeah, because it says it need to ascend. Um, this is great because I don't know how to fucking get up there

1749
03:02:33,940 --> 03:02:35,940
How am I supposed to

1750
03:02:38,820 --> 03:02:40,820
Boys

1751
03:02:41,300 --> 03:02:43,300
Uh

1752
03:02:44,900 --> 03:02:46,900
Is an arrow on the wall

1753
03:02:47,460 --> 03:02:49,460
I see that arrow

1754
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:53,300
Is that what it wants me to do? Do I run off and then jump up here?

1755
03:02:54,180 --> 03:02:56,180
Perhaps me thinks

1756
03:02:56,500 --> 03:02:58,500
Let's try it

1757
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:01,700
Nope other wall

1758
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:05,220
This one. Oh, I want to be different

1759
03:03:07,940 --> 03:03:09,940
I want to live life on the edge

1760
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:13,620
Huh

1761
03:03:16,100 --> 03:03:18,100
Why did this actually work? Oh fuck

1762
03:03:31,140 --> 03:03:33,140
What

1763
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:35,300
What oh there you are

1764
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:39,620
Sorry, I need to line up my shots and take my time because I am just a small girl

1765
03:03:41,540 --> 03:03:43,540
I

1766
03:03:43,940 --> 03:03:48,020
Was pretty I want to try it again because I think I can go up that chain actually

1767
03:03:48,900 --> 03:03:50,980
Because it's definitely there for a reason

1768
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:59,300
I missed that time

1769
03:04:01,700 --> 03:04:03,700
There's a shot

1770
03:04:05,940 --> 03:04:07,940
Oh

1771
03:04:08,260 --> 03:04:10,260
Anymore, okay

1772
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:13,300
I just had a

1773
03:04:13,460 --> 03:04:17,460
I just had a dilulu moment when I swear. I thought I heard the whistle that you do

1774
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:20,180
um

1775
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:22,180
When you

1776
03:04:22,580 --> 03:04:24,580
Call torrent

1777
03:04:24,820 --> 03:04:26,820
Where is he? Oh again, I'm blind

1778
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:30,820
More

1779
03:04:30,980 --> 03:04:34,500
Anymore I'm trying I'm trying to do stuff over here, man

1780
03:04:36,820 --> 03:04:39,620
Trying to trying to no come on

1781
03:04:40,580 --> 03:04:43,220
I know you can do that. I know you can do that

1782
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:49,220
Okay

1783
03:04:53,620 --> 03:04:55,620
Yeah

1784
03:04:56,660 --> 03:05:01,300
Don't fall no damn it

1785
03:05:01,300 --> 03:05:03,300
I

1786
03:05:06,420 --> 03:05:11,300
Give up otherwise, I'll keep doing that for a long time. So I'm forcing myself not to

1787
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:17,700
Actually, there's a lot of stuff that I killed people over here and they dropped who is panting so loud

1788
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:33,300
Oh

1789
03:05:44,900 --> 03:05:50,180
Wait, can I do this and I sorry I'm trying to throw a knee. It's just not working

1790
03:05:53,380 --> 03:05:55,380
Can you do it again

1791
03:05:55,940 --> 03:06:01,220
I'm out of needs. Uh, are you in here? I don't know. I just picked up

1792
03:06:06,740 --> 03:06:08,740
All right, I guess I'll just

1793
03:06:12,180 --> 03:06:15,940
I should probably pay attention. Oh, what the hell user

1794
03:06:16,820 --> 03:06:18,820
Ah

1795
03:06:21,700 --> 03:06:23,700
Oh

1796
03:06:23,780 --> 03:06:25,780
I'm getting a bit cocky

1797
03:06:27,380 --> 03:06:31,060
Oh, I didn't know I my double click actually helped me there

1798
03:06:33,780 --> 03:06:36,900
I didn't know I could spam. Okay, what if I

1799
03:06:38,340 --> 03:06:40,340
Oh fascinating

1800
03:06:41,220 --> 03:06:43,220
Who's behind me? Where?

1801
03:06:43,460 --> 03:06:45,460
Oh

1802
03:06:49,620 --> 03:06:55,860
No, I gotta fight for my life to party. No, don't fucking walk away

1803
03:07:00,180 --> 03:07:02,180
Jesus

1804
03:07:08,660 --> 03:07:11,220
I don't particularly like that noise

1805
03:07:14,180 --> 03:07:16,180
I'm picking just a bunch of shit up

1806
03:07:20,980 --> 03:07:26,580
Oh, what am I doing? No, see I actually could have done that

1807
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:33,220
I was I 100% could have made that and just like it would have been a shortcut

1808
03:07:36,980 --> 03:07:38,980
All right, leave the white clap drop

1809
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:46,100
Oh sweet, I need a names

1810
03:07:58,100 --> 03:08:03,780
Thank y'all. Okay, that's what I have equipped. This is a pretty cool looking weapon

1811
03:08:05,380 --> 03:08:07,380
Damage

1812
03:08:08,340 --> 03:08:10,340
Oh

1813
03:08:11,380 --> 03:08:18,740
I always like the names of certain guns. I still wanted to try this weapon, but I don't think I'll have the time to

1814
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:33,940
What business this is I never tried the critical crowd sourcing yet

1815
03:08:34,980 --> 03:08:36,980
I'll hold on to it

1816
03:08:36,980 --> 03:08:42,980
Oh, wait, I have a lot of money. What can I buy? Can I have some sniper bullets?

1817
03:08:50,900 --> 03:08:52,900
Am I not

1818
03:08:56,180 --> 03:08:58,180
Thank you

1819
03:08:58,980 --> 03:09:00,980
Oh

1820
03:09:06,500 --> 03:09:10,980
Boss battle time. No, I'm not a fan of those

1821
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:21,780
I'm gonna start calling you guys my torture dolls captain flint bird baby bed

1822
03:09:22,100 --> 03:09:27,380
He looks like somebody from

1823
03:09:34,900 --> 03:09:36,900
What the fuck

1824
03:09:39,140 --> 03:09:46,580
I'm very much happy I got the sniper. Oh funny. You just set himself on fire

1825
03:09:47,460 --> 03:09:54,260
I'm a little confused why I'm only doing 20 damage. Oh fuck me

1826
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:03,780
Oh jeez

1827
03:10:05,300 --> 03:10:08,180
These guys look fucking scary. What the hell?

1828
03:10:11,300 --> 03:10:13,300
Can I please

1829
03:10:13,700 --> 03:10:15,700
Oh

1830
03:10:17,060 --> 03:10:19,060
I

1831
03:10:19,620 --> 03:10:21,620
Don't have any health

1832
03:10:24,660 --> 03:10:27,940
Can't fucking I don't have any cover

1833
03:10:31,780 --> 03:10:34,100
Nice I love that for me

1834
03:10:38,820 --> 03:10:40,820
I can't really see

1835
03:10:42,660 --> 03:10:45,780
I'm hoping that there's a dude here that I can kill

1836
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:50,580
I'm on fire. So like

1837
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:55,540
The fp. Oh, yeah

1838
03:10:57,940 --> 03:11:01,620
Hey, you know, it's crazy. Do you see something in the top left corner?

1839
03:11:05,940 --> 03:11:07,940
I forgot about that skill

1840
03:11:07,940 --> 03:11:09,940
And

1841
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:17,940
Um, okay, so it remembers I did all of that

1842
03:11:22,580 --> 03:11:29,380
Oh, I forgot that it still continues kind of where you left off, which is very forgiving this is explode

1843
03:11:29,860 --> 03:11:39,940
Okay, let me try other gun because I don't think this is cutting it anymore

1844
03:11:45,940 --> 03:11:47,940
It's how my god, she's yelling at me

1845
03:11:48,340 --> 03:11:50,340
What the fuck

1846
03:11:56,340 --> 03:12:03,620
I can't quite see it's actually better to do the fighting up here because then I'm safe with my little sniper rifle

1847
03:12:05,540 --> 03:12:08,420
This is actually it might be actually better to die

1848
03:12:09,540 --> 03:12:11,860
Although I don't know Flynn will come over here

1849
03:12:18,100 --> 03:12:20,100
Maybe

1850
03:12:34,740 --> 03:12:41,300
Boss won't spawn if I'm up there damn it. Well, are you sorry about that?

1851
03:12:43,780 --> 03:12:45,780
Are you sure about that

1852
03:12:48,100 --> 03:12:50,100
Oh

1853
03:12:55,540 --> 03:12:57,540
And I set fire

1854
03:13:02,180 --> 03:13:04,180
To the rain

1855
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:09,380
Watched it burn as I touched her

1856
03:13:15,460 --> 03:13:17,620
Damn you're he's a tanky guy

1857
03:13:18,900 --> 03:13:21,220
Oh my god, I can't even fucking hit him

1858
03:13:37,620 --> 03:13:39,620
I can't die

1859
03:13:41,860 --> 03:13:43,860

All right, now we just gotta get to my ship. All right

1874
03:15:54,900 --> 03:16:03,220
Which is the most expensive

1875

All these convenient money I have I am rolling in cash

1876
03:16:17,220 --> 03:16:19,780
