History. She's a gossip columnist. What the hell? One of my frickin lady whistle down from Bridgerton. Great show, by the way. Let's see. Oh, there's different dominatrix. All right, like, I gotta pick that. I had, like... What? Ex-gymnastripper? What? It's a doom seer. Oh, she, I just have severe anxiety. Also me. Subtly insane. Also me. Occult nut. Also me. I could be deaf? Wait, if I'm deaf in the game, will I just not hear any dialogue? Gymnastripper? I know, it's like very specific. I was, like, I did do gymnastics for a little bit. But, like, I don't, and it was never a stripper. Although I do want to learn how to do pole for, like, 3D stuff. That'd be super cool. Long and little foot. Wait, I would just have one foot longer than the other? Are you fucking, why the fuck would I ever pick that? Okay. But I like the crazy shit of a Malkavian. Completely bad shit. Okay. I'm probably, yeah, maybe Ventrue. We're gonna be... Oh. Why is it showing that? Why is it showing, I didn't show my old games before. She. Shibbit. You guys know my PL anyway, it doesn't fucking matter. Shit. Shibbet. Wait, no, Shabethany, duh. Hi, I'm Shabethany. Shabelle? Shabella, Shabron James, okay, okay. I'll make a pole for the name. Shabethany. Shabelle. What is it, Shabritney? Shabinaldo, nah. I'm not gonna be Shabron, well, you know. Shabron. I'm not putting Shibiti toilet. Shabbatha, no. Shibesi, what? Shibinachi, spiral? What was it? Yeah, I'm gonna put Shib, Shibusi. Shibidi-dibidi-doo. I love you, Shibusi. I'll spell it a different way, though. Shibbuse. Alright, go crazy. Shib-palpatine. Shibralter. Shibyonse. Icy demands it. Trickle down Shibon- I've placed Shibonix. Shib, Shib, Shibinomics. I can't even. Shab- Shabelle mentioned, no. What was that book about the vampire rabbit? I have no idea what you're talking about. Guys, is Shabuse really winning right now? Oh, but Nikula, yes, that's true, that's true. Shabonomics, this is Finland. Shabuya, Shabelle, Delfin, Nani. Okay. Shabonomics. It was Shibuse. We are Shibuse. I'm generally surprised that it showed my last save because when I was setting everything up before, I was double checking if I had any save files and it said I didn't. And then when I put in the name before, I was trying to speedrun to see if stuff worked and it was like put in a name and it didn't show any name. Spooky, okay. So I get automatic that. Where did the audio go? If there's like no audio in this part. I had an apostrophe to make it classy. But where? Shibuse. It just makes me sound so fucking ghetto. Let's see. This kind of doesn't matter to me because I might do some like cheatsy doodlin and like fucking add shit later. I think I'm gonna do firearms. Yeah. And intimidation naturally. Can I not? Yeah. And then, you know, I should do knowledge and finance. I'm making it based off of me. I'm not making it based off of anything else. Wait, what? Game is haunted by my past life. Rene. Rene. Rest in peace. Rest in peace. A little bit cheating for the bit. Oh, what do you mean? Like this? Hold on. I can't copy, paste. Oh, wait. Question mark. Ah, that looks a lot better. Thank you guys. You want to do the play you as well? What the fuck? Why does the question mark show up when it goes too far? I don't even know if this still sounds the same. What is that? My chat just fucking exploded for some reason. What are Shibi's best attributes? Yappage. Charisma. 100%. Charisma. 100%. I'm pretty strong. It makes my intimidation go up, which would be cool. My research range combat would be better. Again, none of this really fucking matters. Why can't I? I wish I could put it under physical. Investigation. Scholarship. My persuasion would go up for that. Haggle. The 10 hour stream stamina. I can't add anything to stamina though. Dominate. Put that up. Knowledge. It's more important than whatever the fuck that guy says. Knowledge. Persuasion. I might do that for persuasion. Computer hacking. Wait. Hold on. Fuck that. Put that there. Wait, what? Fuck. Can we do one? All right. Is that everything? It is. Computer kind of useless, but it fine. We are really persuasive. Christmas and Dominate. Yeah, I'm going to dummy mommy through the thing. Here in my garage. My brand new Lamborghini. Just remember the pass codes. My seduction is at three. What? Can we get a four? Yeah, I'm not really intimidating. Let's do that. You totally go cool for me. I'm going ghost. Very sweet. You guys are so sweet. So fucking sweet. What the hell? Where my mouse go? It's a phantom. It's my extensive Warhammer 40K painted figurines. Oh no, I got some paint on you. For a dominatrix. Why am I in such a shit place? Why am I in such a shit place? Why am I in such a shit place? I don't think it's ever coming out. I'm so sorry. I just feel it. The thing, the company went under, didn't they? What the? Step through the heart. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. He looks like ten times shorter next to his goon. They're making it. Then is there another company that's taking it on? I like it's like five people in the audience. Oh, honey. Ew. Fuck off with that. Check the watch. That's not on his wrist. Is it meant to be just subtitles? Fine, is it too quiet? Well, you're gonna have to wait. Fine. Was game about being a killer, Bella? 12 vampires. Did more people get up in the audience? He is rocking that shit. He is like a cup. He's looking like he's from a clockwork orange. He got the fucking cloud sword. Everybody's faces. It's gonna be me. Bro, he spawned. Why is everybody's eyes so shifty? This is bullshit. Nine's really pretty, though. I feel like how their eyes glance about is probably the most weirdest thing that's realistic in this game. Nobody's blinking. They blinked. They blinked. They blinked. They blinked. They blinked. They blinked. They blinked. They blinked. They blinked. Nobody's blinking. They blinked. Nine's is hot. Nine's is nice. Okay, now what? I was just here to dom people. I don't know what happened. There was handcuffs and I handcuffed him. Then he like showed me his more hammer figurines and then stabbed me with one of his really small paint brushes. I'm not a vampire. I'm human. I hate their posture in this game. I wish I could like, it's like being with my head cut off when I'm wearing the outfit on my model. Like, what the fuck is up with the posture? My neck is broken. I have scoliosis. But honestly, this game, I fucking love this game. Like the aesthetic of this game so much. It's cord mod posture. Maybe your character is sad. So just like real life for some of us. Yikes. It was ice if that's you bro. I'm sorry. I wish I could play this on controllers. I could lean back. You know what? Lay in my chairboard. Alright. Oh fuck. Oh god. Oh Jake. It's shake the dog. Ah, look you know. It's probably a lot for you to take in. So why don't you let me show you the ropes? What do you say? Show me the ropes. Show me the ropes. Did somebody say show the ropes? Okay anyways. What voice should I give her? I'm gonna put it to a vote. The game's gonna be paused for a second. Voice. Or Shibuse. My voice. Blue. Why is bro looking like that? Why is bro looking like that? Dummy mommy. AKA my patreon voice. British. Can I add a fifth one? Cause I was gonna do valley girl. Fuck my voice. We're gonna do valley girl. Oh, goodness gracious. Lord hammer. Let the games commence. I was, wow. I'm getting high praise for that. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Wow. You know, when I, when I joined this company, I didn't know. I didn't know. When I, when I joined this company, I didn't know. That's my boobs creep up. I didn't know that I would just be so in touch with my body and be able to burp on command. So I'd like to thank the academy. I'd like to thank Strani, my gen mates. Throw it in the montage. Good D volume on that one. Is it, is it Dummy mommy? Want the Dummy mommy voice? All right. From a landslide. Yes. Okay. The Patreon voice. Got again to character. Who are you? I'm Jack. Hmm. I don't have much time. Just give me the basics. You think I can do that voice? No. The wink killed me. Did I accidentally wink? Okay. The Vtuber company? I know all about them. Lemon squeezy. Are we going in sneaky-beaky like? Wrong text. Speech voice. Wasn't it enough? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Wrong text. Speech voice. Wasn't it an option? I'm so sorry, Heron. I'm listening. This will probably be a long stream too. I don't think I'll do another 10 hours for Vampire of the Masquerade, but I do really like this game, so I might go a little bit past time. I don't want to be a homicidal maniac. But I want to be a homicidal maniac. I was like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think so. That's funny. I'll sleep the day off and laugh later. See ya. Okay. Oh! Brap Friends? Brap Friends Doko?

Let me do that right now Schedules schedules actually I probably already have one. I just don't know where oh I did it's literally above it I'm actually stupid. Um, it's in the vein of like a heather feather one That I used to love that was like one of the first times I got tingles Can I I don't know which one to delete Which one's the newer one? Oh, this one's the newer one, okay I can't I delete it Fuck I deleted the wrong one. It's fine I'm already in character.

I'm just changing it out. Oh This is my schedule you heard it here folks Was that too stream reading submitted fan fictions ignore the bottom part I was like Um, I'm like, um Not a son you did you just put sub description or collab under Manpower the masquerade bloodlines part two, so I'm waiting for them to get back to me fixing that um POV or trash and then yeah, so this is that that's the schedule. I'm very excited for power simulator collab feet my genmeads You look lonely I can fix that Yeah, great art. Thank you. Um sly ukai or yuka one Great You wink And I hope we get monetization soon I I'm enjoying my old twitter I don't know what you're talking about what old twitter Where do people submit fanfics yes in my maros you can submit it in my maros Um, I want it to be in the vein of like my immortals so like super cringy really bad um Some people have sent me like really nice ones like really well written and I'm like no I said cringy Tarot me me ones or even ones like you don't have to write them yourselves like like If you were to write one you can make about me or my gen mates and you can make it like cringy you can self insert That's fine or you can do like a your name like y slash n Um, I want the cringe. I want to be like fangs because I'm gothic like my immortal type And if I don't like anything that's submitted I'm probably just gonna read my immortal Um, if if anyone's gonna convince youtube to want to test your channel, it's definitely you um, I'm also working on Um Making the first class of 9 Uh play through public again. I was editing it Um, so that's fine. I left some funny stuff in there though. Uh, I don't know if it's processing Can you submit a high sonic high school fail? I'll hunt. That's what I'm looking for. That is literally what I'm looking for So that would be perfect. Um So I don't I might wait till I get monetized to Make it public again My stream was historical. Yeah, I was rewatching it like parts of it and I was cackling at myself And at my ac in the background Um, but yeah, I'm gonna wait To get monetized before I publicize that again. It was very fun. Yes, I will definitely probably play class of 9 again But that'll be like later in the future or maybe I'll do it as a gorilla sometime Um, I definitely want to play a little bit of call of the lamb again You know, I'll probably do another endurance stream for that. Riley. I just got another boss I was like endurance stream and this like kill a boss each time Or or two um And then like you can also like recommend me games and my murals and stuff that you'd like me to play because again like I Grew up playing a lot of fps's. I'm not even good at them. Um, so I I want to widen my horizons in terms of games So if you have game suggestions cool Or I'm just gonna end up playing flavors of the month like bunny garden. I don't even know what it's about I think there's like hot girls in it Hopefully my character shows up for call of the lamb. Yeah, I actually really oh, I'm gonna play inscription with crowd control 100% I'm like actually like a little bit tempted to like yoink Bunny garden and do inscription with crowd control. I I really like crowd control games. Um, because I really like You guys interacting. I wouldn't Play through inscription. I would probably just play the first part um Just because the game is like I I've finished inscription before it's literally one of my favorite games of all time um Like the first part is like the best and then the second part's like a little bit confusing and was really frustrating for me to get through the part with Robot version is good and then the parts after that are like, okay, so, um I really like you guys nice to get free bro wrong But you don't you don't want to be my boyfriend girlfriend. You want to be my boyfriend girlfriend girlfriend boyfriend What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? Um Bolivian is going to bucket list. Uh, I'm pretty sure Strawny's playing skyrim next week So I probably wait a little bit like a couple months. I do before I play skyrim um I have a bolivian. I could probably play a bolivian Um, I only did a little bit of bolivian before has crowd control work. It's pretty cool because um You guys get like coins and like sometimes like you can purchase coins if you want you guys don't have to I'm trying to figure it out. So you guys don't like can you get more free coins to mess around with stuff? And uh You can control aspects of my stream And like my gameplay and I that's why I like I think like for example with the description because it's like It's almost like hearthstone or it's like it's a card game and stuff Um, you just like make my hand all bees or whatever instead of like me having like a more boris or something So I think that would be really fun. Um, that's why I only want to do like the first part because I know you guys like I Like I fucking love inscription. Um I want to play pony island 2 when it comes out because I play pony island Could you make everything just one coin or something? No, that'd be too easy. Are you kidding? So you want to do? Hold on, let me just Like weird weird angle since you want to do more of a variety of games I've thought about trying out rts or turn based strategy games Give me an example of that and I have Like done the beam out of four and it was pretty good One coin would be chaos Um, but I'll I'll probably like look through some of the crowd control games and like get a couple balder's gate I like fire emblem three houses He he he um Because I like The romancing in the story Oh, yeah, I definitely want to play hades because people have suggested hades. It's like yeah, I turned off martyr the lamb um balder's gate I'm not I'm kind of impatient when it comes to those games I don't I'm not a huge fan of turn based games, but fire emblem three houses, which was the first fire emblem game I played kind of Um, and then I played a little bit of like the one that Iksen that I can't remember the top of my head Um, and I do like it, but it just I'd have to because like I have but I literally have balder's gate on my playstation I only played like three hours of it though Yes, I play pathically a little bit of pathoradians um I'd play diablo like that would be cool. I'll like I'll play diablo. I actually like diablo um But maybe balder's gate and I also don't know if my pc would be able to handle balder's gate because it's like pretty Intensive I have slay the princess. I would I would totally play slay the princess uh, I used to play warframe a lot when um I needed a titanfall fix and like I don't think destiny was a thing yet I'm a awakening figure it on me like oh, I mean I don't need one of those I have a capture card and I have every game console. Let me talk about Warframe at the harem. I don't know if I would play warframe again though I haven't touched that game and like To 3d yet. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about 3ds style I can make it run on the 3ds and hook it up to my computer fashion frame uh, I remember I used to just focus in all the The outfits in that game. I was like full pearl pink or whatever um I haven't touched that game in like so fucking long subverse. I don't know what that is Three houses or nothing You got tired of war. Yeah warframe was super grindy like I don't mind grindy games Like I played the shit out of destiny 2 and destiny 1 those things, you know around And I know like like I'm notorious for starting games and not finishing them like games really have to capture my attention like That's why I like inscription and call the lamb If they're in the same vein as that I'll probably really like it Uh, it's an at plus game. Oh, yeah, I want to play hoony pop when we eventually get our fanslies That'd be so fun because I've been playing a lot of match three games I've yeah, I've been recommended hall and I before Um, I know that people are like bummed or whatever that there's not a like the another game hasn't come out I can't remember Um Having awful I still yeah, I I want I played the most recent diablo and I really I played it for like a pretty long time I don't even remember what level I am and then I guess got distracted by other stuff Dead cell no I haven't played dead cell all night he goes asleep Dark and dark girl there or the girl.

on a date and um i was like lingering nearby because i was like worried for her deeply and um because you know you can't trust these these places these sites and the guy walked out on her because she ordered food like she ordered like a normal amount of food like she ordered like entree appetizer a drink and then i like talked to her afterwards because i was like fucking off somewhere else with our other friends because it wasn't just me it was more than um did your food no i haven't yet i still haven't thought of anything um we were like eating someplace nearby me and our friends and we're like oh redacted what happened and she's just like he said i was like not like he didn't like directly call her a pig from what she was saying but like he kind of like insinuated she wasn't like ladylike because she got so much food and we're like me and the other girls are like we'll fuck him anyways margaritas so he got mad because she i don't like did like i'm like did you order something expensive and she's like no i just like got a burger and i'm like okay did he wink at her oh my god that's so fucked um but well it like it sucked because like he left and so she paid for both their meals and so like me and the other girls we like took her out and she didn't have to to spend any money because like that's so fucked yeah he did the the dip none of us fucking noticed either we're like really bad not sticking stuff out we're not reliable ah the napsel she'll have the salad literally i think that's what he expected her to get like a salad and like she's like a normal sized girl too like she's not like heavy she's not super skinny but she she's like literally the most normal looking girl you could ever see but he every day he could have been just like fuck like i don't know he could have been like pulling uh like a fast one on her like to get free food i don't fucking know you got your back see something shiny literally though because we were we were enjoying our own food down the street someplace else you just need an excuse to dip guys i don't want to get okay fuck it i'm gonna order for i'm kind of wanting something soupy the girl invited me on a date and it's a korean barbecue to the keeper there's like no korean barbecue places near me i've never had korean barbecue in my life i heard it's really good the way he thought he could have still free meal

not what's fish i've never had knock mom chili oil i have some chili oil in my fridge so i don't like it by chili oil or some wagyu beef i've had wagyu beef one time and it was very underwhelming i got at this really nice restaurant my parents were um celebrating a uh like a the fuck what was it what's the word i wasn't a raise a promotion i got and we ordered like this wagyu sushi and it didn't taste like anything but except like they added like a lot of like decorative flowers to it so it just tastes like burnt flowers like a sweet sour sauce meat sweats for these tartar no it wasn't like a tartar i don't know wagyu sushi yeah it was like topped with wagyu a minute order some spring rolls like others just turn into a fucking zatsu wagyu coming yeah it was like topped with like wagyu on and it was pretty good super inconsistent it was like you just got scammed maybe probably i'd show a picture but then you guys probably like hunt down the place because it looked amazing it did not taste good at all it was a waste of money and it was like 30 bucks no it was more than that it was like 50 bucks for the roll american japanese wagyu it was like a fusion restaurant and they had said it was japanese wagyu i know american is different but you know maybe one day i'll off-cloud with the girls when we're like go to japan and have like actual wagyu that'd be really cool i always wanted

I have a dual feeder, and then I have another feeder in the other room. And Phi is patiently waiting for the one in the other room. Okay. Streaming for another 10 hours stream. How long have I been streaming for? I'm also like, I'm streaming a lot because I know I won't be able to stream as much when I go back to work. So I'm just wanting to stream as much as possible. Did they put any noodles in here? Okay. There's not a lot of meat in here though. I'm kind of bummed. It said oxtail, there's no oxtail in here. It's only like steak and flank. Whatever. 5 hours? Oh, okay. Pineapple pizza that I make, I get some white alfredo sauce, salami, ham, pineapple, red onions. Ooh, some barbecue sauce. I recommend hot honey. I've had, I went to this, like, I can't remember what the brand of the place is called, but they put hot honey on it. 3 a.m. for you. Go to sleep. Have a good one. Oh, this is hot. I can't really. I just burned myself a little bit. There's like, blade's pizza. Maybe it was. I don't know. Blade's pizza's pretty good. Ooh, baby. May tacos? Ooh. My leash. I require sustenance. The food and bowl is already 5 minutes old. Honestly, that's how Reina is. Reina's a very picky eater. I don't blame her though. She's 14. She deserves to be picky at her age. She has kidney disease, so normally her thing is really low protein. Sometimes I give her a little treat and I give her, like, wet food. That's, like, mostly protein. She likes it a lot. Because honestly, at her age, I just want her to be happy. And, you know, eat. Have you worked at Blade's Pizza? Oh, that's cool. I've never worked in fast food. Gotta squeeze a little bit of lime in here. Be pampered. Yeah, I pamper her so much. My cousin came over in my apartment once. And, like, I love, like, so much cat shit everywhere. And, like, the cats have really nice water fountains and automatic feeders. And she's like, do they live in a fucking five-star hotel? And I'm like, oh, I guess so. Okay, I got that. They used to put the sauces in, like, little containers. And now they don't. And then you just have to, like... Like, how am I supposed to... I like to, like, take, um... Did they even eat chopsticks? Okay, they did. Chibi's cats are Wonderland VIPs. Oh, it'd be so cool if I could get them in, like, some art. And, like, in the background or, like, sitting on my desk. And I'm, like, very, like, evil-looking. And I'm just like, I've been expecting you. Harim. Harim. Took an app. You're still streaming? Is this endurance streaming? I just, like, streaming for a piece of time, because I don't have anything else to do. Although I could, like, play or, like, watch something. Shari, like, messes me. She's like, I'm so proud of you, my daughter. You're just, like, mommy. And I'm like, I don't even know if this is because of the endurance streaming. I'm not sure if it's because of the cat. Yeah. Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles? They're so tasty. Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles? They're so tasty. I didn't know that. Normally I stream for, like, at least three or four hours. Two if I'm not super tired. Like, streaming in general? I've been streaming for five hours now, apparently.

I heard some. Why are you crying? Can you hear me out in the laundry room? What's up? I think he's bored and he was looking for a toy to play. He's like, ah! Yeah, you knocked your spring under the couch. There's like 20 under there. You and your sister. Portable stove and a big pot. She has a lot of good stuff. I don't even know what she puts in her chicken or stew. All I know is that it's slaps. My mom's really good at stews and soups and baking. Really like comfort-y foods. I'm sorry, I'm speaking in bun-speak because I'm happy because I have food. So my voice is a little bit higher. Mm-hmm. Is that autism? I don't know. And those can't compare to squish and ghetto crocs. He's making a buzzer with cat crimes. You don't have to follow your true voice to find something to pick you. Oh my God, I almost tore from the sriracha again. Oh my God, I hear my neighbors again. The soundproofing in my building is really bad. Also when I'm happy, I talk fast. Aside from a shabari, unless it's just your persona, what other things do you have at your comfortable sharing? Do you do a tierless stream of that stuff? Every membership? I don't really think I can talk about that on a normal YouTube video. I think? I did a kink tierless before. I don't know if it's floating around. A lot of it I lied about anyways, because I thought I was weird if I liked that stuff. So I'm like, oh yeah, this goes on the bottom, but now I'm like, I don't like it with shit. And just so you guys know, just because we were cast as certain characters, does that mean we officially have those kinks? Like, I'm a dom, but I wear shabari ropes. But I've actually never been tied up in shabari. I feel like I would like it, and that's why I wanted to research on it. I don't want to do membership streams, where I tie myself up in shabari, but yeah. I'm kind of just learning. And you guys are helping me learn. And being corrupted. As to your bionicles. Lying on the internet, how could I? No way that you were involved. Yeah, that's true. Some of you guys are major degenerates. Like the guy in my Marrow said. Never mind, I'm gonna put him on blast. He got his own stuff to deal with. Yeah, I won't kink shame. Some of you do deserve to be shamed. I haven't looked at my Marrows today though. I think it was all like one or two. I'll probably end up answering Marrows tomorrow instead of today. Alabama guy. You're my cats and macros. Because of my reaction, he's like, I'm not gonna watch you. I was mostly just a meming reaction if anything. I might be slightly daffy when I'm Marrows. Yeah, Marshmallow. It's almost like Curious Cat. Or you could like ask anonymous questions. Yeah, IRL, that's so true though. Cause I'm like, oh, if it's like anime, hentai based, I'm like, yeah, but if it's IRL, I'm like, wait a second. Just woke up, hello. We hanging out. Cause like, for example, I like monsters. I'm not gonna fuck a monster in real life. Cause one, they don't exist and two, out. It's all in Japanese though. Link is in the description if you want to try it. Yeah, yeah, it says Japanese, but you could like, usually depending on, like I, to be honest with you guys, I just answer all Marrows on my phone. Cause my phone, I mean, honestly, a lot of web pages just auto translate, like, or there'd be Cromer Safari. Oh my God, children are running in the hallway. It's over for Venom cells. Oh my God, Venom in the tongue. I haven't even watched the most recent one. What are your hobbies? It's important to know things when you're dating somebody. Well, it seems like you weren't paying attention to the first date that we had, which was my 2.0. So I'm kind of offended that you're not a good listener. Cause I talked to you all about all my hobbies in my 2.0. And usually when people say like, oh, keep this to yourself. Cause no matter what, usually I can answer Marrows. And they are public, unless you're logged in and then you can send them privately and I can respond privately. And I can present you like something like a pretty picture or video. But what if you were a rubber bunny? Like a rubber ducky? Huh? What's your favorite monster? I don't know why I keep joking. Movie from a TV show? Oh, alien? The alien from alien? Do other people see the Marrow sent to you? It's private unless you respond. It's private unless they respond. And then sometimes you guys will say stuff and you're not logged in. So if I respond, it will be made public. Ow. But to remind you, it's anonymous no matter what. If you have a username, I can't see it. But if you are not logged in and you send me something that has a sense of stuff in it, I can't... I'm not going to respond because if I respond, it's going to show everybody else what you said. So I'm not going to do that to you. So sometimes it will be like, oh, she didn't respond to my Marrow or what I said to her. It's because you weren't logged in and it was really sensitive and I don't know if you want other people to see what you sent me. My hobbies? Do you like to play video games? Go for a long run across the beach? I like to play instruments. Okay. Okay. Marrow is so hot. Is the rock so hot? No, I just... I just choked. Now I have something stuck in my throat. Oh, the A.I. Yeah, the A.I. also filters stuff. Cat box link waxes to the public. I almost did that once. I think I sent you an Instagram link on Marrow. I've said this before in my Marows. I feel like I'm from... I'm Nick Cage from National Treasure trying to put these links together so I can understand what you guys are trying to send to me. And then you guys send me litter box ones and I can't... I can't... I can't see them the next day when I'm not responding immediately because it only has like two hours. Why are you role playing? I'm sorry, this is funny. Marrow is a pain for cat box lately. Well, cat box has been like not working properly because I know like Shawnee used to use cat box a lot. Yeah, nobody uses cat box anymore because it's just like not... like sometimes cat box will just break. Why do we have therapists here? I don't know. Do you want me to be your therapist for a moment? Let's become more parasocial. It's up to you. A little bite. I haven't seen the... Freddie Fazbear guy. I'm just a bummer because I like reading his comments in my Gregory voice. If you're gonna role play at least type correctly your grammar is atrocious and it's disappointing to me this date is over if you don't have proper grammar. I was kidding, I don't talk in proper grammar. At least put in some effort, man. I'm just kidding. Any case, if I can add a parasocial right up on top of everything. I don't know, we're just here to hang out. You don't have to be parasocial. Like for me a parasocial because I'm only like talking to you guys. Like I could have logged out hours ago and stopped streaming but I just like hanging out because I like people to talk to. It fucking got me, Jesus Christ. I did not read the full sentence. That's funny. I actually really like I would 100% fuck any of the animatronics from that iteration of Five Nights at Freddy's. What is it? Is it the glam rock? Like rock is kind of hot and so is Freddy. Especially Monty. I can't remember the other ones. Chica. Chica is kind of, you know, she kind of she's a little bit, she's a bit loka. So the question is are you, fuck, I can't read that. Are you dominating them? Are you the one getting dominated? I'm not answering that. You don't need to know. Gregory, if you want to escape you need to donate at least $30 to SheebieCarve. Please, Sheebie, look at my marrows. I put my tiny peepee in cat box so you can make fun of me, please. Chica eats garbage, just like me. He's just like me for real, for real. Where you probably got pneumatic dong? Let me be silly for a second. So a lot of my OCs were 100% like tulpas. When I was growing up and I would draw my OCs I would just like talk to them in my head because they were real. It would be just like a little schizophrenic and everything. I can't wait to cut this out of the vlog. His name was Zero and he was an android. I'm a pent-up religious Christian girl with OCs and I draw, so I would just draw smut of me and my OCs. I need to stop talking in my cute and funny voice. I'm sorry. My peepee. And he had a go-go gadget peepee. I wrote an OC name Zero. I probably could draw him again and I had another OC. His name was, he was my sole eater OC. So I had, it would be really funny if the girl that I used to role-play with with our OCs all together because she was like my best friend. She would totally like VTubers and if she comes across this, I will actually probably pass away from this earth if she recognizes who I am. But I had another character. He was my weapon. So my OC was Kiri. Kiri was, she was essentially me but she had pink hair. She's very cute, very pastel goff. And then James Sinner was her weapon. And he was a scythe. And he was kind of like almost like he got a scythe from Akatsuki from Naruto. And he had like three three blades. And he also had like three beauty marks on his face. And he had bright red hair. And his family were all representations of the seven license. He was pretty, he was pretty sick. Which out of the viewer girlies would pull up pastel goff? Look, I would say Icy. Just checking, you mentioned people setting a sense of contramarrow. I appreciate it. Every time I like tributes, I accept those. I don't mind. I may, I don't respond right away. I like kitty on Twitter, she's adorable. Yeah. I don't mind them, I like videos. Am I supposed, am I not supposed to be saying the quieter part out loud? Are my kitty's there? Okay. Oh, chilling. Oh, Mercy, she's not fit for the goff thing. Yeah, pastel goff is different though. She would be, if anyone's so like, I can like bright, so like excuse me, Emmy would be just emo goff, like a typical goff. Mercy would be a seeing goff. Icy would be pastel goff. Icy would be just normal goff, like Dami mommy alternative black girl goff. And then I would I don't know what type of goff I would be to be honest with you. I didn't think about that. What does not being per socialist or king around in the gathering of different what the fuck are you saying, dude? Are you wearing a fedora right now? Base goff. Yeah. I'll be one of those like industrial goffs. Like, you know those like goffs that like the dancing goffs and that one meme and them. I'll be shuffling. Superstar DJ. It was funny when we were me and Icy and manager and the other girls were talking about like her DJ set. We were talking about like shuffling and stuff and we and then managers post that song with the OG like Sydney shuffle, I think what it's called video and I'm like, oh my fucking god, then be and Icy were just fucking jamming. We're just like don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't I can't shuffle. I used to be able to shuffle. Vampires in the club scene. Oh, no, actually, I would be the true blood goff. Like I would be like fantasia. One Eric Northman is. I love him and his prod her knee. She was pretty hot too. I can't remember her name. The second I'm dancing vampire game. Yeah, that's my seed. Wow. Can you put it that way? Either way is fine. How long will he have? Can someone help him? It can someone. What bro? Bro, it's tweaking. Are you? Are you? I know English is probably just not their first language. I am wonder. I wonder what would happen if a werewolf and a vampire hook up? How would that work? I'm very curious for your answer. They would probably just hook up normally. I don't know. I think they would just hook up normally. I don't think the wolf is going into wolf form although maybe I don't fucking know. That's forbidden but that's true. You know, it's a little Romeo and Julie at moment. There's too much DMT. Wolf vampire hybrids? I am wonder. Not now again. Mr. Wolf I think it's time to sleep. Hold on. What's that? So SZA What is the party over? Get your ass to bed. You got school tomorrow. Let's take a talk. Hi Rena. You gonna come up here? Miss Rena Hey, could you not? You guys are bad. Well, when a werewolf and a vampire love each other very much, they give each other a special hug. Honestly, if I ever had a child I would probably explain it like that. I don't know why my model is lying. Usually around this time my internet just like fucking dies. Will I sleep? I think I'll sleep. I didn't sleep. I didn't sleep. Yesterday So I am not. Oh my god, not. I mean, the real question is Where will fuck the vampire human formable form? I think it's funny because I got one of those toys and people were like So should we must really like dogs? No, what the fuck is wrong with you? My marrow is like hey You like dogs? And I'm like I'm not Whitney Wisconsin dude I made the joke before, I'll say it again. Call her a leisure for you guys exactly. Bark Bark for me Sorry, you just know many times. Good puppies, good puppies. Do you need to go outside and do pee pee? Do you need to do pee pee puppy? A lot of you guys asked me to talk to you like I talk to my cats. Rina, Rina, what are you doing? Are you purring? Are you gonna purr for stream? Reapers? Rina Oh to be a cat She's a smugly. Based on the cult stream we Hi guys, we're just not finishing your sentences. Yeah, I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. Adorable. Rina is my soul kitty. She's my best friend. My mom And Me went to go pick up her and her sister. Her sister has passed away a couple years ago. She was 11. We went to the cat breeder. Sorry, I got you my nose. And they're like Oh yeah, these are the kittens that were reserved for you. We went to a cat breeder because we had to My mom has allergies so she wanted to make sure they were fine. Although Fia and Bumi don't even give me allergies. Rina does. So what was up with that? Yeah, it's always an awesome cat. She was a great cat. She was like a dog. It was funny. She was my fetch. She would like work at you. But I held Rina And I knew she was Gonna be my best friend. And And I just held her like a little baby And she was in my arm. She just looked at me And she just purred. And I'm like, yep. And she has been Back to me like glue ever since. I'm gonna be very sad when she passes. Cause she's getting up in age. And she has, like, I saw the kittens and stuff. So I just wanted to be happy And healthy. Yeah She was 11 She was a seal point Siamese So she was the typical Siamese that you see. They're Applehead Siamese They're not Oriental Siamese Which are those The ones from Lady and the Tramp Which are like the really Skinny looking ones. Oriental cats are so cute though. They're kind of like goofy looking with their muzzles. Almost have a future status. But then I like think and I think all the Sorry, my voice is broke for a second. All the Memories are just so worth it. And you give them like a good little life. Cause I rescued Fia and Bumi. They initially came from Mississippi In the south They're not actually related. They're a month apart. They're not from the same litter. I just refer to them as the twins, brother and sister. Cause they act like it. And yeah Fia's sister died When they were kittens And that's why I was very determined To make sure Fia was okay. And then Bumi Came from a litter of like six kittens And they were just like found on the street. Yeah, it's really It is really devastating losing a pet. Cause they're like People are like oh, but if you never had a pet You don't get it, but like they really are part of the family. I like cats because A lot of their stuff is instinctual And I don't have to train them to do anything Although it is very impressive that I managed to Create train Fia and Bumi I don't know how that works, but You can create train a cat Cats are pretty independent They clean themselves They groom themselves Use the bathroom And what you really gotta do is feed them And give them toys In a nice comfy bed Yeah, and they can be pretty independent Family have had seven cats To all the creature My friend has 20 cats He thought I was a cat lady She has 20 cats And she just got like Four more So like 20 are at her parents house And then she moved out and she got four cats of her own I'm like girl, you need to stop Yeah And they have like Her and her boyfriend They're building like a Like a cat patio Or a cat room for all the cats And I'm like, honestly, he's a real one for that I don't think anybody I meet Would help me make one of those I I mean He just looks at me up with me With her big blue eyes How do they take care of all of them? I think, uh I don't know, to be honest It's really just like, again, staying on top of the litter boxes And then feeding them So I'm making sure they have like clean water And toys And like brushing The ones that need to be brushed I brush Rena a lot more often now Although she's a short-haired cat She's been shedding a lot more Because it's around the summer And she tends to get hairballs And Rena also likes to fucking eat my hair when I sleep Two, four snakes and two leopard geckers That's really cool I always wanted a snake My parents said no I wanted a ball python And I also wanted tarantulas And my mom was like, nope What about isopods? And my mom was like, what the fuck is an isopod? I'm like, it's a really pulley She's like, you can keep it outside And I'm like, that doesn't make any sense She's like, exactly, why would you want one? Two ball pythons on morphs My friend had a Wild type Ball python in a Albino corn snake They're pretty cool She had to give them away to her Friend though, when she moved though Well, actually not her friend To her, her cousin Really pulley, they're called isopods Yeah, they're invertebrates There's actually a lot of different types of them My favorite is the ducky isopod They look like little ducks Do you do out yellow pythons? Like a Burmese python? They're kind of I think Burmese pythons Are very gorgeous But they're very invasive Especially in Florida People just release them So they've really kind of ruined their ecosystem down there All the snakes and cats don't get along Yeah, my friend also Had gotten cats too So that's another reason Actually, they would kind of just sit and watch the snake But then at some point They just knew it was better You don't want to stress out the snake You be such a big girl Thank you I'm a bug girl, yeah Hog noses are so cute I remember me and my dad Begging my mom to get a hog nose I can't remember what my dad wanted to name it Like Miss Piggy or something One's a pie ball, then that's a pastel champagne lesser Ooh, pretty I remember I wanted a pie ball so bad And keeping And keeping is cool Occasionally that like one What's that guy's name He like does a lot of He has this whole like bioactive enclosure And he releases like a lot of ants and bugs in it And it's so cool Like ants are very interesting I used to like ants It was weird My mom said that We had in our Like our little like don't be apartment But um We lived in We had like an ant problem And so my mom like hired an exterminator And like was getting a lot of traps and stuff And I was My mom said that I was um Trying to take the ants outside And I was saying Little ant turn away Go back to your family My mom is gonna kill you You gotta go And I was like trying to save the ants I watched one of my um Favorite channels They don't really upload as much anymore Was um Uh Something flower horn Something the flower horn That was a cool and it was like They always played like classical music And I would just like watch and they like Had a lot of beta fish But then like I was like No my mom Then my dad told me that I would take magnifying glasses And set ants on fire So I like was nice and then I would try to kill ants And you know like Out some part of the year Like a lot of ants will rise Come out of the ground Sometimes when after like it rains or something And there's like a just a giant Riving mass of them Food the flower horn Yes food the flower horn so good I love that channel I was allowing them to have full sense of security So because We didn't want ant problems Me and my dad are gonna sound like fucking psychopaths We would just dump Rubbing alcohol On the Giant ant mess And then we would set them on fire And it smelled like bacon Kind of fucked But I don't do that It's really just to fight the ant problem I need citizen gasoline So yeah I've seen that We have Because my mom has like a really She has a garden because that's her thing She loves gardening That's why she says she wants to hijack my channel So she can garden She's like there's a gardening niche In redacted Area that needs to be filled It's my time like mom no She being a cheep And So they had to I think they had to get rid of Boss that way Because they also we have like a Really old shed that like the bees just like to hang out in this There's some Yellow jackets that I Are under my balcony And I still haven't Figured out how my lower neighbors hasn't Seen their nest yet because every summer Like I used to let Rain out on my balcony Had not the other cats because I know They will just fucking kamikaze themselves off I also had like a border around So that they couldn't like put their head through the bars Just in case they did get out if I opened it And um Fucking excuse you neighbor Coughing super fucking wildly as they walk by And um I remember There was like a bunch of wasps that like Early yellow jackets or whatever That were like right near where I would sit I just crashed fucking coughing up a lung dude And um I like ran To bring Raina inside Because I didn't want her getting stung Although cats look kind of funny when they are stung by a bee Because they are like little doofy faces Because it sucks But it's funny at the same time I didn't want that to happen to her Normal fish have fairly high maintenance But betas are real chance Yeah betas like survive on fucking anything It's crazy Fish enthusiasts And one of them likes to raise shrimp Um Like aquascaping seemed really cool to me But I just I don't have the patience To maintain stuff Gardening Shibi's mommy somewhere No I've seen so many brutal ant Wasps nest instructions Bids, yeah Drop, yeah I've seen people I've actually seen the aluminum stuff before People pouring aluminum into the Into the nests And then thinking it out It's very interesting Well if I The model if I like cover my face I'll fall asleep I lose tracking So I usually before I know I'm gonna lose tracking I try to close my eyes So I look like I'm sleeping I see does it automatically but mine doesn't I have to like be like And then move myself to the side It's like sleeping face I know it is kind of weird To think about the aluminum ones I like to watch this channel called snake discovery I learned a lot from them I like during Covid and lockdown and stuff I just watched, I consumed a lot of Animal facts stuff So like I learned a lot about snakes I'm 100% sure If somebody handed me a clutch of bottle python eggs I could raise them no problem And like invertebrates and Reptiles And it was really cool Yeah snake discovery is awesome Really awesome Like if um If they ever do like If I ever become big and they do a charity event I will 100% like donate to them Cause that would just be cool And uh yeah I watched fool the flower horn Snake discovery Ants Canada Dark Den There was another one I used to watch But I don't think they posted it anymore I don't remember They also had like a lot of Ranchos Yeah I was just Catching up on Like I was watching an Ants Canada video Where he released like a huntsman And her baby is into an enclosure And I was like I was just fucking sick Cause I hadn't like consumed like bug media In a long time I really like bugs Bugs are cool And animals in general I like watching um animal

touching It looked like the beetle was Closed and then when she would spread Like um stretch out her leg And she would like Stretch out her leg It looked like the beetle was Extending its wings and it

period accurate why they're black people my mom was like no no it's not like it's like they kind of just like modernize it a little bit i'm like okay and i actually ended up really like in the show because i'm very someone like me and my mom are usually very much sticklers for wow out of context that sounds really bad guys in half black um i feel like i have to say that every time i say something i'm gonna it's gonna be funny when i get my when i get my um am i wrong though when i get my tan toggle anytime i say something problematic whatever this is being caught out anyways don't worry about it it's pretty serious there's indian well no no no like the the indian like the indian royal families were understandable like forget it like it doesn't even matter version's a great show once i got the premise because i thought they were trying to be true to the time period like tutors ask because i liked tutors um and like the white princess the white queen and the past can't wait to get my past toggle um three fours of the whole fun oh i thought that was like a three-fifths compromise meme okay it wasn't all right fuck me then uh anyways um why i'm sorry you guys are just getting okay what why are you what's wrong can't a girl crack a fucking joke jesus yeah i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't like her um i'm just too far gone hey you got you got me which makes those jokes you got emmy which says does gay jokes you got everybody else who is politically correct i don't know what to do i need vods to watch she be she be dumping problems see if i was in a normal agency i would not have survived uh she's black it's fuck is there so much easier when i had a tan model although i could actually i could probably just change my skin tone in my um in my uh meshes for the model i could probably do that actually i might wait it's probably not going up doing fucking blackface if i do this fuck it weeble see look at all these layers that are on my model these are all fucking layers rgb she be and like mommy you're getting very sleepy riveling won't you you want to worship she be like the dog you are where's my face it's hard to we're getting oh god no no abort abort how do i cancel oh my god you can see my neck oh abort stop it no keep going you know it's funny when i became a streamer my ultimate goal was to be a role model for other little black girls just like myself who liked video games and were female and i wanted to be a role model role model for women of color i am not that i failed myself i think i just sometimes you just don't you don't it's fun not to take yourself seriously you know this is really fun to do though i'm just moving my mouse around for this ah kings are glowing this is hypnotizing you keep up the dream yeah it's always been my goal especially because there's like what i loved about being in this company is that um not only do you have one black girl that has a black model you have two black girls and one has a white model um and usually there is no other there's no other company that has a tan or a racial ambiguous model or black model and i think that's pretty cool that we're kind of branching out because people are like oh people won't like a tan model look at fucking koinako or waifu baby like giaru or tan or whatever like it's still a popular niche yeah before serena rest in peace um avi cadavera she was a fucking amazing creator and it's really sad to see her go by the way uh amazing comedian and sketch artists she was very very unique and um vtuber sphere it's i'm congrats to her though for landing some sort of thing woomi what are you doing i'm gonna give you a hug come here big man kiss you how are you doing how are you doing mr titties um yeah sanas sanas.com sana sana i can never pronounce my name right but uh yeah i feel like azura and serena feel those niches and i feel like it just shows that there can be there's plenty in the indie sphere let's bring it more into the corporal sphere you know yeah abby's graduating serena staying this sucks because there's only two of them in their gen and now serena's alone so i kind of hope they do like for v4 mariah like in some sort of invader gen um just so like she doesn't have to feel like she's alone yeah i'm i'm eventually getting like i know emmy um can rig i know she said she just like like um she i can just hand over the model files to her and she'll just like slap toggle on so i might just do that although i think um i think um strani is talking to our um rig papa mama because she's a girl nori um about getting me a cover-up official cover-up for my biddies in a tan toggle not that i don't like like you know this model and i would just i'd be like i kind of i want to i would pull like an iron mouse and just switch between the two because it kind of makes sense because i am irish also yeah i wish like some people who had like um like swimsuit models like had like a tan toggle on them like that would be really cool depends on the audience so i wasn't forced to retire yeah that's true it's hard to get to colored models yeah yeah because like um for my model i had before in my past life i literally mostly use a little one uh my former artist mama uh swal koi fucking amazing because i was like i was a cute funny vtuber um they did such a fucking good job and sorry that model will never be seen the model i i was going to do a whole debut but then i got into a veal or that model will never be seen um but they did such a fucking good job on my model because um they nailed the skin tone how horny was it uh it wasn't actually uh because i was i was a cute and funny priestess so i kind of had almost like a gypsy look to me i don't really know how to explain it um there's there was tommy showing i don't know um and then i had my nun model that i used a lot and i just like edited the mesh like how you just saw me almost doing something terrible and i just did that and um i just made it tan but yeah there isn't it's mostly like i think yeah getting like the coloring right because sometimes it can be gray or like too orange or red it's it's those different tones in uh tan colors um that's why i provide i provided as many references as possible with the skin tone that i wanted all right she's a shark she's spanish yeah i feel like there's also like a lot of spanish and like it honestly kind of makes sense to me to have more tan models because you have a lot of spanish fans and you also have a lot of um uh agent fans that are more darker skins because like not every japanese korean filipino tai vietnamese lai ocean etc etc etc etc is snow white ending of purple yeah i actually at one point i was tempted to um brand into like when i first started v2 being just to be like a dark elf and just be like drow colored that's because i feel like people have it or more easily do that than something else i don't know why why do my eyes look like weird colors i feel like one's darker than the other with the whole i think i have the like the light in the center of my eyes and shade it properly modernizing the end of it yeah half heart yeah tricksy who the tricksy yeah i know what you're doing um jarby super tight yeah um trust fit on the nose yeah i don't want to um flashbang by turning on my turning off the overlay i have on this but like i don't know how to word that but yeah i just think it's cool and like i also think it's like i was almost like i just a like i wanted i drew this really cool picture of this um i made a slime based vtuber um made her an oc of mine can you what the fuck are you guys doing i can hear you fucking about what's up marina go check it out marina's walking towards the laundry room she's gonna go investigate um um what the fuck was i saying oh yeah i was gonna be a this was before like this was just me when i was going indy for the first time by the way because i didn't like again i didn't conceptualize or create myself as you see now um and no no no she wouldn't she wouldn't be a model like she be will be my only only one and only model although i'm i'm begging strony for a slime girl gen two please hello i will sell this oc so this comes to life so i had an oc her name was saliva and i called her live saliva saliva and she was a slime girl but she was made of spit she was like blue colored so she was like spit personified um um and i was like oh i was good so i was gonna be that so i'm like hey that would actually be a pretty cool idea for gen two oh it sounds kind of gross well fuck you um but then she could like you know make herself not spit like she could like change her form or whatever the fuck um imagine the smell the spit part not the slime girl the spit part um i thought it was just really on theme and uh yeah i want i want i want a monster girl i want a bug girl i want a slime girl i want like out of the box stuff bio hazard vtuber 100 percent i want i want a slime girl but she's like made out of blood like i like yeah just be sick is that a is that a what is that is that pig nose pig v2 i don't has is there a pig vtuber i don't think of it a girl made out of mud menstruations okay see i didn't go there robot girl oh yeah i want a robot girl i want an android girl snake girl yeah oh like a like a oh from monster misoom like uh like a lamia lamia lamia can i pronounce that what led you to joining vealer um i was a huge fan of strawnee for all her iterations um i watched her grow as a vtuber and when she had other things go on and she mentioned hey i want to do my own um company i was like oh that'd be sick so i worked really hard because i um i really only like i i'd streamed it as a flushtuber in the past and i do have content creation um history and experience but i was never a vtuber so i'm like if i work really hard i'm gonna stream i'm gonna get a model like just got one right off at etsy change the colors of it um gonna make content gonna do my own thing and i'm gonna if when she ever makes this company i want to apply and because mean i and she'll say the same thing about me because she's called me her 2.0 i saw a lot of shared values in her she was like we have a lot of similar tastes as you can see we like to stream for very long times and we just like to talk and yep and hang out with people and we like um as you said like a lot of the same things and uh it was it was just like what like it's i know like it was the type of relationship like watching a uh a content creator i hadn't felt in a long time where i'm like oh i'm gonna watch you and i feel like i'm just hanging out with a friend and i'm like i want to be that person so bad where you just come home and you're like oh my friend streaming i'm like we're gonna hang out we're gonna chat we're gonna talk simping paid off um and like just seeing her like roadmap and what she wanted to accomplish i was like i want to do everything in my power to try to be in this company um i i honestly don't know how i ended up here it literally i was bawling my eyes out when i got accepted it was it was it was crazy it was genuinely wild um but it's but like i'll be honest with you i did apply to other companies because i didn't think i would get in i also applied for the experience um because i didn't know what it was like applying to a vtuber agency um yeah i was i was a i was an og refling some of you already know that um i ended up here because you're awesome oh thank you um and then you blackmailed her yes and then i blackmailed her so i got her um um i think yeah she said she so she made notes on our interviews of like why she oh my internet's starting to go because it's getting late uh they're like shut up we're taking away your internet so she said i got to see some notes of what she wrote down about me during her interview and when she took when she was like doing research on the people that applied and she wrote down i'm way too knowledgeable about the industry for only being around for six months which is true although it's been um more than six months now that i've been a vtuber and uh i was very good at voice acting and at a range but i needed to work on my cute and funny voice is what she said because i mostly streamed it was like cute and funny but i had a lot of vocal fry when i did my cute and funny voice but now i don't not now it's um i've trained it since then and um and she saw again like a lot of herself in me and i think she said that i wonder if i can find it she said that you know i was what she should have been in another life and i was like and i i disagreed with her on that how long i've been so i've been a streamer for almost like for about five years i had to take a break because of school and work and then i got back into vtubers again and i um yes i was like when she told like when when i asked the manager for the notes because i'm like okay how can i improve and i saw that i literally broke down crying um so it was i was blown away by that fucking um statement and i it is my goal to live up to it now did you try any other kind of voice acting besides stream uh actually no i don't have any other voice acting under my belt i only did it for fun in my streams i was always good at doing wacky voices when i hung out with my friends i was that the funny one in the friend group the girl who managed to have a sense of humor um then you said the acceptance note it's april first yes and then two days later i think i i interviewed the strawney she was like you're in like excuse me she's like yeah uh here's the model slide shebe's first um model iteration because we did like had some adjustment since then like i had i used to have a lipstick then i pointed out that i'm like i had like the same lips as a zura so they yoinked my lipstick away um i can't wait to be picked up a cruncher although it would be it would literally it would be so crazy if i got to voice for an anime that is like oh my god that'd be so insane that'd be so amazing queen must my emergency oh queen uh so um some of you know like i wasn't uh technically supposed to be shebe it was supposed to be another um asa mark creator uh but life uh commitment's gone the way so she couldn't sign on so uh she goes dub stories dub that'd be so fucking funny i don't love you because you're a rabbit i don't love you because you're wow why am i i am so fucking bad today what the fuck dude um anime series voice acting i don't really particular series does anything fantasy related i'm never gonna be hired at this rate um i think i use that sort of humor as a coping mechanism or like a defense mechanism because younger me would just ball her eyes out if somebody said that to me and i think i've just adapted um yeah oh yeah so uh thank you for reminding me so yeah i wasn't supposed to be shebe um but but shebe wasn't shebe back then because the other asa martis and strani were conceptualizing the og shebe together and then other asa martis could not sign on because um and this is like way early in development like before buehler had a fucking like name um and so then you know strani was on the hunt for a different creator and i just happened to fit that and but it's she's always reassured me she's like you're always gonna be my sheepsters like you're always my shivers you're always gonna be my she my sheepsters um yeah when it was still a b sucky yeah um but yeah she i originally had like i was i was as thick as a zura and i was purple i was purple um and then yeah then they changed it and worked through the conceptualization and then i'm like i hired on and it's me and i'm a bunny yeah i was barney your voice seriously suits shebe to a i don't think my voice suits it at all i i'll be on it like when i first got my model and i was watching myself talk out of it it was very weird and it still is weird to me so you were out only yes oh my god out only such a fucking great game um yeah i never like i'm still getting used to hearing my honestly i think my normal speaking voice fits better but some i use like my patreon voice when i get really like like i don't like my like my voice in the trailer and in my um like one of my shorts i'm like my i like really deep in my voice and i really put my voice on and it's like they always say like you always put on a voice when you first stream and then you either get higher or you lower your voice like a lot of girls mostly pitch their voices up because they want to be cute and they want to talk like this and then they'll be like hey what's up like later like a couple months down the line um you went musky deep hefty hefty hefty uh i think you lost us on that one well i mean a large white guy for some of my voice talk of a giant bird yeah exactly like it's it's uh i've also was so used to seeing my voice come out of my pl that i think that was like if if i had not started v2 being they just gave me this model i think it would have been way so pl means past life um and i yeah i don't think i would have had the problem but because i was cute and funny in tan and then being this i was like huh um one of my favorite things about being trans is still having a deep voice i can slip into one of my uh one of my gorex is is trans and she always pulls that on me because and it throws me off each time because she'll come up to me behind me at work and she'll be like hey excuse me and i'll be like what the f**k if then it's her and i'm like f**k you and she's like hey sorry skat skadaddles away i'm like b**ch um yeah pl past life my mom nice to go yeah like oh when i saw the model when strawnee showed me the model i was like holy s**t i'm a hot as f**k like holy and you want me to be that also why is she wearing so many bonnage ropes i also um i might ask nari to get a toggle where i can take off the ropes they're starting to chafe none the good way but i can like i want to be able to toggle them in my uh gag just for like um content reasons because i feel like i honestly i i personally out of all the girls don't think i'll get monetization because of my model because i'm wearing a ballgag i don't know and then azura has really big boos who knows silk rope not have yeah what lore yeah i know um it's funny when i became a vtuber i was like you know what i want to do definitely i really want to stick to a character like i really just want to role play a character and i'm like then streaming yeah my cute my really cute necklace my cute choker it's very unique then streaming i realized i just somebody had said about me that they wish i would be myself and then when i started being myself i had the most fun and when i started being myself i made better content and i think that's why people have a hard time sticking to cave ape because they realize when they're you're already kind of hiding yourself behind you know an anime character on the internet like why can't you be yourself but also have aspects of that character you really enjoy like um for this i do like learning how about how to be a dom and you know i like pretending and role playing that like you're my either my clients or my staff at waterland hotel like that's just so fun to me like oh did you uh go make sure that mr withamall was taking care of him he needs his dick suck now and he also needs his his bed made in his his clothing pressed um and and i think you know people do complain sometimes like oh cave ape cave ape cave ape that's taking a cave ape but then you look at the most popular vtubers and you see that people fell in love with them because they were themselves you know like like gir for example she was always like you know really cute in childlike like she like that sort of silly um person like personality you know if she she's not gonna really lean into being a shark and being like i want to kill everybody or whatever like she like yeah cave ape is a wrestling term it means like um kind of like your role like with the act that you put on your your lore aka your story your backstory um because that's her exactly it's her she didn't have to put any like and that's why at first i was frustrated when applying to companies because i was like oh why are they like why am i not getting hired and then and then watching like places i applied for because like i applied to idol i applied to pixel link i applied to um like vnu and all that stuff and then i see the people who play and um are those vtubers and i'm like i don't i do not see myself as that bird like i would not want to have hired anyone else besides the person playing this um this character like not even because they they always say oh they're looking for people to fit the character they're looking for people to fit the role fit the voice and i totally get it now because after applying for so much and then getting um shot down i was like i just didn't fit them and i and i see myself not fitting them and i couldn't see myself growing into that character so it's really cool to kind of see what people get cast as and how like their true personalities come out like i'm getting i remember i watched a lot of vnu girls before i was um hired and i like um like mesmerizing i was i was um chatting with her the other day in her in her stream and i'm like i could not see myself playing it like you're also kind of like a mommy character but you're also like classy you know about drinks like she's very like like she's so like i don't know like it's just it's just like everybody fits so perfectly you know agencies are picky and also you know there's like nepotism and shit like i didn't think i was gonna get into veal or because i didn't know if strani was going to go the route of like hiring friends or hiring people that because you know it is it's more smarter to hire people that already have a history and experience of being in a corporate agency but she took a chance on me and i appreciate her for that dom the role i was born to play oh that's funny no i like i like um i like switching and putting you guys like i'll be like hey i'm a dark girl failure then i'm like open your mouth say ah okay hold it and i just rule into your fucking mouth now swallow good boy like i like it's fun just like pulling it out of nowhere he's a bishop principal is there reading material how to dom i mean i watch a lot of fucking porn to learn and uh you guys have already also given me suggestions of stuff to watch and i also learned i did i watch a lot of youtube videos about the culture of like um like bdsm culture um like i know somebody was kind of frustrated with me at first because i made a joke that i didn't believe in safe words yes i believe in like safe words are very important they're important with consent and all that stuff um sometimes i like to be a bit and sometimes people are into that sometimes people like so i will cater to different niches and fetishes and all that other stuff calm down i'm not gonna hurt anybody i'm not actually in the bdsm community promoting like abuse good for homework yeah and it's like uh it's funny because looking at the girls i don't like we would see people guessing about who was gonna play who like people thought i was gonna be icy or someone or whatever the fuck um just because i was cute and funny in another life another reincarnation reincarnation and i don't see like i don't see myself as like even loving playing a cute funny character i don't see myself like they everybody was casted so perfectly and people thought i was gonna be icy or emmy because i was cute funny and i i i was very um yandere masochistic type i've got a dmg manager yeah yeah i did it twice my manager was like what the fuck i'm like yeah what the hell yeah it's like yeah i'm like bro just walk away from the computer close your eyes turn off the computer and walk away like we're we're here to have fun we're gonna be silly i might say some stuff that's inflammatory but it's jokes i'm still cute yeah i do have my cute and funny moments yeah we're gonna get told me sorry i'm reading something that i didn't in the context of um but yeah no i i read a lot about so rgb rgb rgb rgb rgb i um i'm right up on a lot of stuff uh you guys also gave me some advice which is actually very helpful i did read it even if i didn't respond to you um i always read all the maros even if i don't respond um usually because i don't respond because i want to give the same energy back or i don't know what to say to be honest although i can yeah sometimes i don't know how to talk over text um real shibi better than pretend shibi um and i think i think people like it's been like because you i totally get it you have these expectations of a streamer because that's how they're marketed um and but then you have to realize that they're not going to be able to play the character all the time and if they can't impress it but yeah everybody everybody that was hired in my gen they all are it's just like so much like their characters in ways you know you all right no i like i always had respect like i'm i'm not someone who is like uh bsm oh like i always had respect for different niches and um different uh communities like that like um like sometimes i'll find something silly like pony play or like uh leather puppies or whatever the fuck like those are funny um and that's just not my thing i'm not gonna go and like outwardly just like go up to someone who i know is into that to be like you're fucking stupid like i don't i don't have the energy for that stuff you've been the best cap most surprised ever but then like i said the nice surprise you i turn it on i get real up close and personal and i tell you how it is sweetheart have you been behaving all so good you do me a favor any good on your knees i'll put madam stockings in your mouth okay i need you to be crying um fuckles is that a new emoji i've no thing i've seen a kneeling emoji before like for me first yeah the algorithm works in mysterious ways um i actually got on my knees help um um strani said to all of us she wanted us to be ourselves because ourselves were how she saw the characters and i couldn't agree with her more and if you disagree with that you're totally entitled to that opinion um but i feel like people have really started to appreciate our personalities over the last week and it makes me happy like it makes me very happy i'm happy that there's somebody for everybody in this company like sometimes you don't like every girl or you like one or two but it seems like the consensus is like you all like us for our different quirks and our different hobbies and our different skills and talents and it just makes me so happy and i feel bad because you know people are like oh feeler is going to be dead on arrival just because you know the type of content we do on the side and i just i'm so excited to see like the next year when we've proved them wrong and we show that we're a normal company we just do patreon 18 plus content that's it like that's the only difference i'm still a normal streamer swimming around about strani's pale she's always been supportive and encouraging as content creator yeah like this is the most self-sacrificing woman i've ever met like just like what she did for some girls one time she's like collab with me i'm gonna give you the the the money for it because you've been screwed because of your past cut like that just like why wouldn't i want to work for someone who's like that you know why wouldn't i want to work with the other girls who their previous content shows positive character their silliness their talents i like you guys because you guys are way more mellow than other creators i know delman yeah you know what's a bummer is you know as an agency vtuber you do have to be a little bit you know more corporate professional and i will i'll be like that sometimes i have my moments where i'm like that because i want i truly want this company be great i i said to myself have i managed to get into velar i will do everything in my power to make it great and succeed because i know if we do you will set different precedents for deep vtuber agencies showing that you can still treat your talents as human beings you can pay them well you can still make a profit you can invest in the right spots um and you can branch out to other platforms safely and you can allow 18 plus content in monitor and manage it safely and there's a way like there's a lot of things in place that our management team do so that we have peace of mind so that we are have good mental health um yeah i want i want it to be a positive for it because a lot of people say we're not going to be we're like uh i've seen like even this before i was joined this is before i applied um like watching like the drama channels or whatever or people talking about it people are like oh they're going to be dead on arrival oh they're sketchy it's a scam it's this that it is it just bums me out just because of what happened in strice past you're going to damn the people that are going to be in the company in the future um it's a bummer i know we're going to miss out on a lot of opportunities before that for because of that but i don't give a shit because i'm going to fucking show everybody we're going to be fucking amazing i've been waiting for false to make a video and you guys will be probably they're probably not going to and i actually don't mind it because we don't give a kind of attention we don't get haters so when we see 18 plus content you will never see my flesh in 18 plus content i will say that right now you will never see i'm not going to be fucking finger blasting myself my rtx form i will only be doing um patreon like and i'm sorry if you were expecting that i'm not going to be doing that i don't feel comfortable doing that um i will be doing uh loot audio and that is on my patreon in my description and i will probably be um doing like 3d stuff like project melody style or uh playing like iregames um i want to learn poll so i can do 3d dancing and stuff because that'd be really fucking cool i feel like that'd be good like work out yeah i'm already kind of broken i'm reading up i feel like a lot of people in this news especially if you drop the act because like more natural probably because of the company and people back into the fan yeah don't knock it till you try it i always say give something jujitsu on stream that'd be funny um haven't done jujitsu in a bit though so um i forgot what i was gonna say but yeah yeah i can't wait to do hoonipop we want to establish ourselves on other platforms first before we kind of branch out um starting to explain it into her like exposing vealer thing that she wants us yet to be established on the main platforms it's because you know you'll be more successful she knows the algorithm she's working the industry for a while and then you'll branch out to other ones once we've been you know solidified on youtube and patreon i mean like want to see what she has to say uh yeah that's on yeah like i feel like when when false first announced and even like kaiyo like that other guy um they were covering vealer it was mostly about the negative reaction and then like there's like a minute of positive because that's just how news and media works you get more clicks and more views when you cover the negative aspects of stuff so it makes sense that when you do a report on a company and you really mostly highlight the vocal minority because a lot of people were actually pretty positive about vealer when i was like to my own uh lurking people are all gonna assume that oh this is actually the majority so it just it really did you know it's it's what drives the clicks yeah exactly great turn on you feels a lot more personal compared to the best of two that makes us yeah like i i love like i didn't think i would love like i'm uh so people wonder about like my history with like because i didn't do any sfw stuff on my past life um except my sfw history it was i don't only fans for like a month and i was like nah i'm fine i was like i needed like some extra cash real quick and then i um drew uh sfw content and i i haven't ever used i hadn't ever used a 3d o before um i never recorded super loot content like i would make like jokes and stuff from like read silly um scripts from like a mars a smart script haven't like read it or whatever but like i realized i actually like making this content and i love voice acting in this way for you guys um see yeah it's it's a completely new world for me and i'm realizing i enjoy a lot and like don't think oh she was corrupted all this or that no i'm an adult woman no one's coercing me into fucking anything relax um con while i've heard of that i've never been there before and yeah and it's like i i realized i was good at it the first time i sent a script the like i filled something for strani she it was just like did you edit this and i'm like no she's like because i sent this to the editor and they were like all i had to do was to add the effects and i'm like really she's like fuck yeah that was fucking if she's like if you record like this it's everything's gonna be a breeze and she's like you've never done this before and i'm like no she's like what the fuck anyways here's some more scripts and so yeah and like i'm still learning like i'm still growing as i do voice acting for this stuff and i feel like you'll notice as i because she gave us scripts like for month like dune audios for this month july audios for this month august audios september audios blah blah blah i think you'll notice as i record different months um i do improve and stuff and we'll be able to donate super chats as always oh no that's okay that's okay that's a good question um we all just applied for monetization so hopefully soon um i know strani is worried about me and azura being monetized because of um because of our what we look like with our cake old bitties halloween's gonna be hectic yeah it'd be cool what should i be for halloween i don't even like it's but also like i also want you guys to know um when strani sent me a lot of strips a strips oh uh scripts a lot of the stuff was like office related because my lore is like i work to an office so a lot of it's like your boss does this and so she for for a couple of months you're not gonna get any like super i'm sorry like and if you can remove yourself from the patreon if you want that'll be honest with you you're still gonna enjoy what you hear trust me um i've heard some of the girls they for some of mine everybody's fucking good um the heart she wants to do a whole like month for like hard dom for me because it seems like that's what people want our boss does what your boss catches you doing something that's all i'm gonna say um yeah my next audio she she's staggering out the audio so you guys technically get an audio every day if you're subscribed to all of us which is pretty fucking awesome my opinion so you never like you just be mindless for a week um but yeah it knows i like i feel like i'm a there are some where i'm like heart like but it's always in the a lot of it is in the environment of an office that's what i mean it's not like there's not a lot in the environment of like a fucking sex engine that's like which is what people are expecting big brain scheduling again can't just be that yeah essentially pretty much um so yeah i feel like because but like there's also cool stuff like i don't i don't really think i'm it's a it's bad thing to spoil it and she never said we couldn't like talk about the scripts you felt but like i'm also like your roommate in one of them i'm also your um classmate i'm also like someone you just match with until like it's so it's a lot of cool different scenarios um i'm dom and generally the majority of them um literally of course the first one you guys vote to listen to was my literally my one sub audio i recorded out of like 27 well i don't think it was that much but it was just funny uh and first yeah i know and then i was just like and so it tied with uh with a different one that was me dom and i'm like strani please pick the one that's dom or they're gonna be like what the fuck is this this is not what we signed up for she's like oh i already uploaded the other one and i'm like god damn it any of them considers rich uh i don't really know you guys will have to tell me to be honest or like um tell strani cuz strani is the one who puts the tags in yeah i know i'd not like even when i before i read the script like i read the title i was like oh this is what's gonna happen i'm like that's not what happened like it was it's i love reading the scripts before i like um read them out you're like record them because then i just get like really surprised and i'm like oh man oh whoa oh gosh um but yeah so like this like we're all gonna be doing a variety of content and roles situation it's really fun um i also like i want to do cuz i really like asmr role plays like i like just reading scripts and doing like guided meditations and like sleep aids and stuff so i'm gonna have a lot of that on my channel um just like safer work stuff i think strani is having someone edit my um one of my safer work audios and we're waiting for monetization for her to and then she's gonna put it it's like a i'm so excited for it i worked really hard on it so i hope it comes out good um yeah like uh i think guided meditation would be really cool you read watershed down in fifth grade yes i did cuz i was weird and i like warrior cats and watershed down is actually very similar to warrior cats i'm entire playlist asmr so you know how i've been watching lately and this is they're one of my favorite um asmr this lately i don't know if you guys know who king hobbit is but she's the cutest uh girl i think she's from the uk and um and it's like she's just like so fucking goofy and she's all over the place and she has the cutest like accent uh i highly recommend you watching king hobbit she's so adorable i definitely wish i could make content like i want to learn how to make like um content or i can kind of like smack my head on over my rtx face and do like visual triggers you know like i'm like wave my hands in your face and shit because i feel like like the lag with a 3d model oh you know or maybe i could try with 3d model um i know there's some vtubers that do that but if i could like motion track my models head over my body i think that would be and do like visual triggers i think that'd be really fun yeah exactly like how onigiri does it with her cooking like i would love to do that with asmr and i've seen like there was one creator i saw that actually was doing it for like music related stuff i think he was like playing a ukulele he's like a really goofy looking um really cool stylized um almost looks like something from like cyberspace what was that gay what was that tv show cyber kids i don't know looks like something out of that and i was like oh that'd be sick to apply to asmr and there's also somebody who did that something similar before that um tv ties you have asmr reply there's actually something like that i don't like android no not cyberpunk cyberchase thank you cyberchase spy kids great oh yes spy kids game over i can love those movies yes cyberchase like he's he's like a cyberchase stylized um vtuber vtuber model and i think they rigged and drew it themselves but they yeah they uh they motion tracked their models head over their body but you could see like their hands and he would play guitar or ukulele i was like oh my gosh imagine this applied in like asmr sense and i feel like it would be easier for monetization because um you like like when a human if a human gets to review a video um they would see that no i'm not doing something inappropriate i'm just like doing a trigger and with like because a lot of times um like people do like ear oil stuff and they're like oh it's sucking pee pee yeah the only the three original movies 100% be locally accurate asmr yeah i can't wait to go i think i might go to like a craft store and um get some stuff for the like like a michael's or something or joined fabrics and get some stuff for the asmr stream that's me a human i know right and i'll like or at least like maybe with bots like they would be like oh there's a person in this but they have a cartoon head that's fine i don't know because like asmr is being really cracked down on lately on um youtube no matter what type of creator you are whether you're flash or vtuber so it's kind of a bummer like any like like recent um asmr content old stuff hasn't been flagged by bots but new stuff that's being uploaded gets um gets pretty shadow on which sucks can't wait for the learner to probably tie shabarovs i know i need to get like shabarovs so i can learn that time i don't i don't know what the f**k up so bad you guys are gonna laugh at me oh i think mercy is streaming now so if you guys um want to hang out with mercy i understand the rumors i'm just gapping we're just talking about industry stuff maybe alert stuff like some big yaptos of course yeah yeah of course magic ram harness to start i've seen what those look like i was thinking about um tying my legs because i was watching somebody tie their legs and i'm like oh that'd be cool because then i can just do like like i can just like angle my camera on my desk i think properly and just like tie my legs i don't know and both tracks yeah like that's what i love i like i i so what i have um one friend that's a former corporal vtuber and she was worried about me because she's like in my company i experienced a lot of like jealousy and competitiveness between the girls but what i love about my company personally me saying this i love the other girls and i just want them and like none of us are like jealous or catty or whatever like we generally just want each other to um succeed and we talk every day and then like so that's why we'll always be like hey this person is streaming oh however you like like we'll just like direct you to other everybody's everybody else's chats because we just we just want you to have fun you know not about us about you what you enjoy we want to make sure everybody shares the love damn i should be like way more bitchy so so much of dorm that i am i'm being too wholesome right now fuck me rena why are you staring at me like that god damn why you posted up you're trying to fight what you've been doing big mama hmm she's like staring me down from her cat tree her face is so funny she's like she's a little cross-eyed right now because she uses his focus her eyes and what are you doing are you gonna come over here you're looking at me like you want to hang out did you want to snuggle i'm down for a snuggle if you're down for a snuggle you can dominate me bet yeah i know dorms can't be wholesome yeah dorms come someone said in my mirrors and all shapes and sizes and i'm like you're right bro you're right i can still choke you and hang you from some shabari ropes from my ceiling and knocking around like a pinata and then you know give you a smooch afterwards untie you and you like a like a kinder egg and say how much of a good boy or girl you are yes again it makes it thank you i went up kinder egg in a while i discovered i really like those bueno bars i was like i like got i went to all these um because they have all these they like open in all these and i'm like oh yo i'm poor let me no not that poor people shop at all these it's just a lot more affordable that's all i'm saying because i'm broke and i'm like okay let me uh let me go to all these and they had buenoes at the checkout counter and i had one in my life changed forever yes they do slap because i really like nutella pinata roleplay oh that's actually maybe maybe i'll do that as a freebie i like adding my own sound effects to stuff like when i did like the one of my all of you being in a cage in like me having breakfast i literally i literally had placed my phone in my cat's crate opened the door took my phone out walked all the way to my closet and then recorded the rest that's funny yeah they do they really do i got like a nice like um uh like beef round beef no was it a beef no i made like a really good beef stew from this beef that i got and i also got like a giant ass salmon now i was like jiggles tits excitedly it'd be so much more colorful yeah what sucks is like i i genuinely don't know how i'm gonna do like i need to figure like ever corded me cooking and baking before but it was hard and i had to use another laptop i don't know if i'll have that laptop much much longer because it's a company laptop and if i leave this company they're gonna yoink it for me maybe i don't know um so who knows i was supposed to give it back a year ago but they haven't they haven't asked for it back yet so they're like you'll be you'll expect the the uh the boxes to return from when i worked from home the boxes to return died nice how am i gonna let me out i got a 5k display just chilling and a computer and i'm like please don't ask from the back because i can sell that display or i can use it yeah i definitely choked on a kinder egg when i was a kid did i or was it something else i don't know i put a lot of stuff in my mouth as a kid that sounded so fucked up i meant like toys i like to chew on things but xlossin should be not true no but the thing is like they um they remote manage it so well the the the display i could probably keep but the the laptop they remote manage i remember i swallowed a quarter when i was a kid and i had to poop it out or it might still be in my system i don't know i literally just remembered that right now holy shit that i swallowed a quarter my mom was so frustrated with me i have to ask my mom about that i was like oh yeah i didn't swallow it what the fuck i did swallow weird stuff what what the cookie put what the fuck is that i was i'm tempted to like jailbreak it i really am it's been seven hours holy shit bro hi well a bunch of us is gonna get chopped i'm probably gonna right now are you gonna jump there we go um i'm probably gonna cut from when i came back crying and shit um and what else and then probably rena is rubbing against my microphone lady um and i'll probably keep in when i got my food and when i got to the house we're not keeping that listen i was trying to make my model more accurate to my skin tone i was trying to find it and i should have done it off stream because it just looked bad against this mall yeah i'm gonna when i went on brb i'm gonna cut out when i came back but like i'll probably keep in like the stuff about like what i'm talking about now i realized it takes a long time for youtube to process stuff like so i'm i'm probably oh my god i'm here with my nose i might private this for um and then edit it tomorrow and then let it come back to life oh yeah no you'll definitely mistrani apologized to me like every every other day she's like i'm so sorry i washed you i'm like it's fucking fine relax it's not that big of a deal you know why are you looking at me like that i'm random you got like hair on my nose now my nose is a G i love you so much though you're being cold like legit being cold because i think i got cold earlier um i had i think i had like 4.5 i have 4.3 i don't know it's not exactly like what i'm confused i'm passive oh yeah if he is a fucking adorable she's so cute i was gonna upload a video for today with her little toe beans out am i still do that but then like i really like my hands were fucking gross because i was cleaning stuff and i'm like ew i'm not posting that because my nails look grimy as shit people be like what the fuck is this bitch doing cleaning dishes that's what i did not just sound exactly like her that was like not even remotely close i gave her like a British accent maybe you live like this sorry again i have a short-term memory loss and never get what i'm talking about half the time less and more don't clean it i live a dishwasher why am i cleaning my own dishes you're my dishwasher get over here get to cleaning yeah so yeah my mom calls it fibro fog because you just kind of like forget because my mom is fibro and i have fibro well my fibro is actually been finitely i haven't been stressed so i haven't been having flare-ups and my bodies feel okay my arm kind of hurts i've had like maybe like one migraine i'm actually doing okay i think because i'm happy that i'm streaming again it was hard being away from streaming for so long i was only like dying yeah and like i'm a little stressed because like my fucking you know my dad and now my my landlord and all that but you know i just i have faith that everything will be okay we're together we're good i got you guys i got my girls i got my management team i got my parents i got my therapist i got my friends i will be a okay and that's what i always have to remind myself sometimes i tend to be like kind of a doomer and just like really get really down and i've been trying to practice on not doing that then it only just makes me have a flare-up and i'm just like can't fucking move yeah yeah and my dad has um diabetes genetic though not like um health like diet related i forget is it like i was gonna type one and type two confused but it doesn't even matter because he actually technically has both he has like that weird rare one where it's like the he needs he can manage it with his diet but he like he still has an insulin pump um i will actually which really sucks i'll probably end up being diabetic too because genetically um all the women in my family have it so i'm more like so i try to eat right um i try to you know stay on top of my a1c i know there's like another a couple of other v2 births that have diabetes and like i'm my dad has educated me a lot on stuff and i'm not like scared of needles or anything if i had to do that so yeah i'm very like my my dad's like very hard on me because he doesn't want me to get it but it's very much a possibility all of my other members my dad's side have gotten it like literally before the age of 35 and i'm 56 so you never know oh my homies hate genetic predispositions i always like to tease my parents i'm like you guys just had to have a kid and sit off this genetic bomb of all these fucking issues that i get to do stupid genes like a rid of all mine i don't wear denim anymore fuck denim um but yeah i'm on top of it and i like i know like i've encouraged some of you guys to be healthy from what you guys have said in my marrows with like um with my asthma and stuff that i was like telling people to um you know tell tell like five good things about them and like try to eat better and work out that's actually motivated me back that like you guys are like yeah i'm trying to work on myself and i'm like you know what i'm working on myself too we're all here working on ourselves we're improving because you know my mom always told me that um what is it a relationship you always want to grow from a relationship you always want to grow into another person no matter what the relationship is you know are you feeling it no i didn't sleep last night i think i probably fucked up my sleep schedule because i'm actually okay right now i also had like a really big coffee in the middle of the day i'm girl feeling again now that you mentioned it actually i'm getting like a little eepy i just don't want to stop talking to you guys oh i feel so fucking cringe when i say that i hate it so much i'm sorry do you have like teardrops what do you mean it's highlighted on my model my eyes no i don't like i don't like you baka what are you talking about i don't like you i don't know what kind of like you you're stinky who could like someone like you not me that's for sure you're gonna call me a stinker fuck you mods take them out was i talking like her they actually like her i know i accidentally did like doki birds exact voice one time i didn't even mean to because she has like a she has like a little bit this is me analyzing her voice patterns not like insulting or anything she has like a little bit of like a nasal thing and when she laughs i can't i have to listen to her right now but again but i realized i could i could do her voice pretty well and like it does have the and she has like a little bit of a cry but it's very very subtle involve the doki laugh if i could actually i can listen to it and i can probably do it i can turn my headphone back on playing death mark but mark she's playing i don't know what that is but it looks cool uh doki bird laugh so she has a kudos laugh laugh \u0f45\u0ecc\u0ec2\u0f0betus\u0651ways \u0f45\u0ec0\ufffd circular \u1e1d sculptures legislative \u1e1d symbols

I just flipped my spoon and it was really cool. I don't know. I just don't feel like... I need to learn more. I just listen and I mimic. That's all I do. I'm not trained or whatever. My model looks so funny when I eat. I'm really having... I'm really having a bad time. I'm having a bad time. I'm having a bad time. I'm having a bad time. I'm having a really bad fucking cramps. I think it's my tummy though. I don't even know how I would train. How the fuck? It's cold. But it's okay. Do I have to fart real bad or something? What the fuck is wrong with me?
