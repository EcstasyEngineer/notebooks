6123780	6125620	Tell you
6125700	6130180	You're going great after watching the collab. Are you asking us or the cats? I'm asking you guys
6131780	6134900	Raina's by my feet in her bed when we swapping around
6138660	6141220	Where's the little girl she she hanging out
6155620	6162180	Weirdest places like I have all these cat beds as she sleeps on the back of the rug behind the door in my bathroom
6162180	6164180	I don't
6174180	6176180	Why
6186580	6188580	Oh
6199860	6201860	I don't mind the way the dip in sauce
6215620	6217620	I
6224660	6226660	Little bit of dinner
6237940	6239940	Ow, boomi
6239940	6245220	Sometimes he puts his paws up on my legs but has his claws out stretches in their parts
6270260	6272260	I
6275300	6280500	Love love love love does your bra foot well it might be it not on my bra spit well
6280500	6287460	It's hard for me to find bras
6297380	6301700	They usually don't carry my size in those places because when I take service on the home gun
6304820	6306820	Usually after that that's why I like the
6306900	6308660	um
6308660	6311460	Rihanna place because they have like like that long drink
6312180	6314180	It looks like that is
6315460	6317860	Not all places carry e-cups
6321780	6323780	And it honestly it varies from like
6325700	6327380	Um
6327380	6330500	brand to brand because like I'll wear like an airy bra
6331620	6332580	And
6332580	6336660	Their biggest will like sort of fit me and I'll wear a victoria's eager bra other bras
6336980	6341220	Don't fit me and then I'll wear savages 20 bra and those bras are fine
6345460	6347460	Yeah, that's such a pain
6350180	6353460	I got my soup it tastes delicious. I got my breadsticks
6362260	6364260	Looks like I'm ready to get boys
6366900	6368900	I
6377060	6379060	I thought you can see me fucking chewing
6388980	6393060	Do the background music for that this one tastes delicious
6397380	6400020	I didn't go all your booty. It's so funny how like
6402340	6405380	What people like how people's opinions change on body types
6406180	6408020	Because I remember like early 2000s
6408100	6410340	It was like awesome if you were like anorexically thin
6411060	6417620	And now it's like and then after that a little bit later 2000s like you need huge titties and now it's like you need a huge ass
6417780	6419780	It's like so funny to me
6427380	6429380	Or fish it in Japanese
6436100	6438100	Damn have to leave for work right as yeah
6444420	6446420	Sorry you might miss out on the appage
6448900	6450900	99 are you happy?
6456900	6463220	I want to accidentally put something on my keyboard so I can move this on the way
6469380	6473620	I don't even know what to yap about I don't have any idea what to yap about right now
6478180	6480180	I think all my energy
6481380	6485620	Was stolen from the collab and just laughing so hard
6486660	6488660	I
6495380	6497380	She be out of yab
6498420	6500420	It happens
6505780	6511940	Madam do you happen to work in tech my phone's flashing a green tint? I don't know what that means
6517220	6522500	Oh like your phone screen. Do you have a android or an apple device?
6528980	6531540	The club was oh the club was hilarious. Please watch the vod
6533860	6535860	Is an apple did you drop it?
6539540	6541940	If it's flashing a green tint you probably have to take it to the junior bar
6547540	6551300	Because it sounds like you might have loosened a cable
6553220	6555220	I hope you have apple care bro
6555700	6558820	It's apple care, you know screen replacement is
6560260	6565700	29 bucks, but um, I think depending on the model it's way more than that
6573220	6575700	I apple care on my phone because I drop that shit all the time
6576740	6578740	I
6580180	6582180	For the low price of your soul
6590180	6594500	I know Mike's you tweaking well, yeah, because we were tweaking so we were gonna peak like hell
6599220	6602260	Club was fire if you haven't seen it watch it now if you have watch it again
6602900	6609460	Yeah, we couldn't and we didn't end up doing a power wash simulator because nothing was working
6612660	6615860	So I was like, all right, we're gonna play this. Oh, we don't have that game. Okay, we're gonna play this
6615940	6617300	Okay, we don't have that game
6617300	6621220	All right, play this. Okay. We don't know if that would work properly because we don't have time to set it all up and make
6621220	6623940	Sure, it's fine. Although then we did guard dick phone. It was worked out worked out
6624100	6630020	The boys is back. Are you serious? What?
6631940	6636580	I fucking love that show the boys came back. Okay. I have to watch that then probably watch that tonight
6642740	6644740	It's the last season
6646020	6650340	I thought they were doing five seasons. I know they already got renewed for a fifth season even after this fourth one was released
6654900	6662020	I'm so excited. I I'm so fucking it's that's funny. So I have a guilty pleasure of watching like really cheesy romance shows like
6662580	6666420	Um, so I've been watching like exo kitty on netflix was about like this
6667220	6669220	half korean half white girl who goes to
6670020	6672020	Korea to be closer with her mom
6672420	6674500	And also see like her long-distance boyfriend or whatever
6674500	6678340	But then he figures she figures out that he's like cheating or whatever the fuck it's a long story
6679060	6683620	Um, but they use the same exact school as in gen v
6683940	6689060	And so they break into like the principal's office in one scene and i'm like wait a fucking second
6689060	6693060	This is the same principal office from gen v. I was like, huh?
6694180	6700500	Um, I was just really i'm really amused by that because the juxtaposition of those two shows is quite amusing. Um
6701940	6707620	And but i'm really bummed that actor died because I i really like that actor. He was really good at sabrina
6708260	6712740	Um, he was really good in gen v. I really want to see his character develop more and it really just sucks
6712820	6718100	He died in a um the actor that played the guy with magnetic powers
6719060	6722900	Uh, I can't remember off the top of my head. Uh, he died in a motorcycle accident
6728420	6730420	It's really sad
6731780	6734740	Reminds me of the guy from star trek who
6736420	6741220	Um, he was like had that thick accent, but he was also in a couple other things
6742180	6744180	Um, and he got
6744500	6747780	Crushed by his own vehicle. It like squeezed him between a gate
6748580	6750980	And he was squeezed between a gate in his car and died like that's
6752740	6757300	It's so sad like oh, what a way to go. So there's great talent gone
6758020	6760020	Especially they were both young
6764580	6767460	Yeah, like um like my uncle has a motorcycle
6767540	6776020	And I have like my cousin uh, he's he's really into dirt bikes and I always like worry for them, but it's like
6778100	6781860	It is what like it is a dangerous hobby as long as you can take all the right precautions
6782580	6787780	And it can still be not your fault or something can still happen and you know, that's the same with a car, you know
6793060	6795060	Yeah
6798420	6801460	Oh my god, the soup is so good. It's a little bit too salty though
6806580	6809860	But I'm so I have to watch that then I like
6812020	6816180	I like what was it did somebody make like a reference to like
6818100	6821700	Oh, that's right in that video that someone made a memes of our um
6822660	6829860	Of our debuts and 2.0's they like used a couple the boys memes with like, uh the deep
6831700	6837700	And like strutty and like um octopuses octopi whatever and stuff and I was like I was like wait
6837700	6839700	Why was I thinking of the deep the other day?
6841300	6843300	Every time I think about
6843860	6850180	That actor I just laugh because he plays the deep and then he also plays the main love interest in gossip girl and I just
6851860	6854820	Sends me every time I'm tense. I'm gone
6861860	6865300	Anton Yelkin. Yes. Yes, uh russian peas. He was young too
6865860	6870500	He was really good in star trek and he was also in like, um odd thomas. That was the movie
6873940	6879700	You want me to have you want me to have a alt alt account? Uh reaction to the boys
6882260	6886340	The deep and strong use a scary ass combination you're right
6891860	6893860	Sup sup sup
6897060	6900500	But I just look it was like making jokes about like the octopus and the deep
6904740	6907700	Strani is the octopus and the reeflings are the deep
6912580	6918340	And his original girlfriend the deeps girlfriend is um reeflings
6919940	6924020	Current girlfriends and they're leaving her for the octopus
6936340	6938340	Take a sip be
6938900	6941400	Homelanders and mk. What does that mean?
6945540	6947540	A mortal combat
6948580	6954900	No fucking way. That's actually a perfect character for more mortal combat. That's hilarious
6958180	6960180	Sorry took me a moment
6965460	6967460	Mario Kart
6968500	6970500	Oh
6972100	6978260	Omni-man peace maker. Oh my god, I would love to see a homelander versus um omni-man
6984740	6986740	That's so awesome
6991860	6993860	I personally suck at fighting games
6999300	7005540	I just to be honest I could totally see a crossover of the boys and invincible
7009860	7013700	Not like a cartoon one but like a um like a live action one
7023620	7028020	I was called him glenn. Um, I don't think they would be able to have the same guy as the actor for
7029140	7033460	The main character. I can't remember anybody's names from invincible. What?
7036500	7041060	Iron man invincible. Yeah, I know that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I didn't know about that
7043140	7045140	The boys getting washed facts
7048740	7054340	Yeah, uh, I don't um omni-man would destroy homelander. I will say it
7054340	7056340	I
7057780	7059300	Also
7059300	7061700	The last season of invincible. I'm sorry, but like
7062420	7064580	It was such a fucking letdown for me
7065220	7071300	I'm like it was just all over the place like the main villain disappears after an episode and then comes back at the very last
7073140	7076420	Episode and like does fuck all and I'm like, okay
7078900	7080900	Excuse me
7081380	7083380	Yeah, I was I was really disappointed
7084980	7091140	It's funny how you can technically put all I guess anyone he gets wiped true
7092260	7094740	He's just he's just psychologically like
7095860	7097300	one of
7097300	7100980	Homelander's traits is he just really knows how to manipulate people really well
7101700	7103540	um
7103540	7105540	Because he's a fucking psychopath
7106260	7107940	And so he knows like
7107940	7112180	It's it's funny because he's not a sociopath because he has empathy
7112660	7113780	um
7113860	7119940	And he but he uses his knowledge of empathy and how people react to things against them. It's very smart
7120900	7123860	Totally unhinged. I actually really like he's one of my
7124740	7126180	favorite
7126180	7129220	Villain characters because he's just so well developed
7130100	7131700	um
7131700	7136580	I think that's why I really liked like I just like you know, you think there's a character you just love to hate
7137220	7142740	And like that is homelander like he's such a like like ah, fuck. I hate him, but he's awesome
7142740	7145300	But fuck him like that's yeah, that's homelander
7150500	7154900	Yeah, the minute you crack his ego he's done for yeah, like he has like he's a super powerful
7155540	7157540	Whatever the fuck likes what do they call them?
7158580	7160580	What do they call people with powers I forget
7162980	7164740	V hero
7164820	7169860	Vagina hero virginity hero a soup. Yeah, he's really soupy
7170500	7172500	um
7173140	7177940	But I would even it's funny because not even a superhero. He's just he just has superhuman abilities
7179700	7185300	Hope they handle them well on the news. I bet they will super powerful man, baby. Yeah, because he's like under like mentally
7185300	7188260	He's just like has not had proper human interaction
7189060	7191860	Gaslight maxi. Yeah, I also really like um
7192260	7194260	Butcher because
7195060	7201780	He's such a like a good anti-hero like I would love to see like uh team up of butcher and the punisher
7201940	7203940	Like that would be a cool crossover
7204980	7206980	Homelander is an incel with a cape
7208260	7210260	But it's funny because he's like
7213380	7217140	At first I'm like, oh, he's like a what like, you know when he's with that
7217860	7219860	One chick who's a nazi which that made me
7220500	7222500	crack the fuck up
7223860	7227940	Like his relationship with her and how he just like would complain about stuff all the time
7227940	7230980	Like she's in that bed and she's just getting me in my handy and she's like half dead
7232500	7235940	Um, basically the dude from mega mine. Yeah, you know
7238260	7239620	But like
7239620	7241620	he's not
7241860	7247140	Like he was it's weird because he like respects people at the same time. He's like, no, no, no
7247140	7251860	We don't we don't we don't treat people like that, but then he'll just like kill people again
7252100	7257140	Like that. It's just so such a funny thing to me. He's like, no, that's where I draw the line
7257780	7259220	racism
7259220	7261220	No
7261220	7263220	I won't allow it
7265300	7270180	Uh, see when he works. Yeah, yeah, that was that was an intense scene
7270980	7272980	Like when he kind of just like switches it on
7273940	7275940	and just like fucking
7275940	7277940	He does have a way with words
7277940	7279940	A milk scene is a very iconic
7280180	7283060	all the best like terrible characters
7284020	7286020	Drink milk in such a weird way
7286500	7290980	It like I remember reading an article of like, you know, you got like jack knuckleson's character
7291140	7297620	I think from one flew over the cuckoo's nest then you have like, uh, the main character from like a clockwork orange
7298020	7300900	And then you have homelander in like what milk
7301540	7305620	Represents because it's usually something that children consume
7306660	7312180	And it's like these adult men consuming it and like twisting innocence. It was such a great article
7312180	7315060	I wish I could recall more of it. It was such an interesting
7316180	7317380	uh
7317380	7319140	deep dive into
7319140	7325860	What fucking milk symbolism was just like corruption like, uh, how they can do this corrupt others
7325940	7328580	But they're also extremely childlike at the same time
7329140	7333140	Homelander is definitely deserve a fan. He's a bleeding heart
7334500	7337300	That would be so funny if they had like a scene of him just like
7337540	7340980	Fapping to a vtuber or like he falls in love with like some online girl
7341940	7345780	Then he hunts her down and like freaks like like I feel like he would be a good yonder, eh?
7346980	7348980	His interaction to the storefront was like, yeah 100%
7351380	7353380	Um
7353380	7355380	Little man, no
7358980	7360980	But uh, yeah, I always love
7361300	7362820	character development
7362820	7368340	And uh tv shows that there's no character development or like the characters are just so infuriate
7368900	7373380	Furiatingly superficial or one-sided. I'm just like I can't consume this
7374500	7376180	Poor boy. Yeah
7376180	7381300	Yeah, that was I actually really liked uh black noir's character. Um
7382100	7384100	It's weird though because
7384100	7386100	It's very different from the comics
7386420	7388420	And I
7388740	7393060	I kind of wish they stuck to the comics because I think that would have been
7394340	7395860	very
7395860	7397860	Interesting to go
7398900	7402420	Down like that route. Yeah the original uh boys comics
7402580	7405700	It isn't as good like the people have said like this tv show
7405700	7410900	I've only read like a couple like a little like bits of uh the comics here and there. Um, but
7411780	7415060	Apparently like the show is actually better than the source material
7417060	7419060	Um
7419220	7421220	There's your comments about yeah
7422820	7424020	The
7424020	7428180	Creator from letter didn't say he's meant to be satirical. Oh, yeah, that's that's totally
7429460	7436100	So prevalent just satire of the american dream. There's a twisted version of the american dream. He is manifest destiny, you know
7436900	7438900	um, but
7440020	7443860	Yeah, it was I would have I would have liked to see how that would have gone down
7444420	7446420	I feel like it would have
7446420	7447540	Been interesting
7447540	7452260	But um, I feel like they'll approach that in another way like because I feel like they're
7453140	7456340	Already kind of approaching that with the sun and everything like what
7457060	7458500	would have happened
7458500	7464020	The comics just an edge of abortion on the justice league. Hey, man. That's what my fan fiction was when I wrote
7464500	7466500	When I wrote a fan fiction I was younger
7466980	7470820	I think this hates superheroes as parodies of them are very surface level. Yeah
7471220	7477540	Hero guys episode was tame compared to the comic. Oh, I did not it was funny. So like
7478420	7481060	My dad's recommended the boys to me. Um
7482180	7483940	and
7483940	7488420	I remember I was watching that season that here guys. I was in he's like, did you get to the episode?
7488500	7491300	I'm like, what he's like, did you get to the hero guys an episode?
7492180	7494180	And I'm like, no and he's like
7495860	7497860	Just walked away
7497940	7499060	Like
7499060	7504020	Okay, and then I like and then I like watching I'm like dad
7505300	7509060	Why did you recommend me the show because I think I started watching it when like the second season came out
7509060	7512020	Or whatever. It wasn't the third season that one was in. I don't remember. Um
7513860	7515860	And yeah, sometimes
7516420	7520740	Sometimes my dad recommends me shows and I'm like, why the fuck did you recommend this to me?
7522980	7524980	He's like, yeah, you'd like this
7525540	7527540	But he's right. I like it
7528500	7530500	It was it's a great show
7530980	7536980	I recommended the boys to my boss. I'm not sure who watched it was wife. Yeah, my mom could not watch that. My mom has very uh
7538100	7540100	My mom is weird because she hates
7540580	7547620	Violence, but she really likes military related tv shows because I think she was watching like seal team or whatever the fuck it's called
7548420	7552260	And I'm like, okay mom, you can't watch the boys, but you'll watch like war
7553220	7558820	Like this is just like out like silly goofy like, you know, it's fake
7559300	7561700	But like that's like based in reality
7562340	7563540	and like
7563540	7565540	war
7567460	7569460	And like like for example
7569940	7571940	My mom really likes outlander
7572500	7575380	Outlander is a great book really great premise if you don't know what it's about
7575460	7580260	It's about this woman who has this ability to go through these special stones back into
7580660	7585060	Ireland I think in like the 1400s and she falls in love with a guy there. Um
7585700	7590100	Again the 1400s was a wild place in scotland. There was a lot of
7591220	7593780	raping and pillaging and murdering and terrible stuff
7594100	7597460	And I'm watching the most fucked up scene from this tv show
7598020	7604340	So my mom's like, oh you'd like it. It has like fantasy and like historical stuff that you like. I'm like, okay
7605060	7607780	And I'm like, oh this dude is totally just
7608340	7612580	On going ham on this poor woman and okay
7613700	7615140	I'm like mom
7615140	7617140	Yeah, my mom likes like medieval shows
7617780	7619780	Um, but she couldn't watch game of thrones
7620500	7624420	Actually, no, did she finish I asked my mom. Did she finish game of thrones? I don't know
7625380	7627380	maybe
7627620	7630980	And it's weird for her she like has to watch something that's like realistic
7632500	7636580	Like it has to have some realism to it or she just can't get into it and like a lot of people are like that
7636900	7643540	So she likes historical fiction because it's like rooted like you can twist the truth just a little bit like it leaves enough for like, um
7644340	7646340	what's the expression
7646660	7648260	Suspensive
7648260	7651140	disbelief whereas fantasy you kind of throw that out the window
7651540	7656980	But like for me, I can understand like and most people can watch it and be like this is fantasy supposed to be like this
7656980	7660660	I don't have to believe in it. Um, she like Rambo probably. I don't know
7660660	7662660	I
7662900	7664900	Wasn't she married though? I think so
7667620	7669620	Thanks mom
7669620	7670740	um
7670740	7673140	Yeah, what I've just been watching a lot of dumb stuff lately
7673780	7677300	I've been in my my lonely woman era. Um
7678100	7683780	Sometimes I just like get into this funk when it becomes like spring summer where I'm like, oh, I'm a lonely person
7684340	7688660	And so I just watched like I or I binge watched this whole like chinese drama one time
7688740	7690740	And it was really good and I was like sad
7691380	7695140	And then I just watched binge watched euphoria and that was fucking depressing as hell
7696900	7700500	I literally cried at the and I don't cry at shows a show depressed me to fuck
7700820	7704420	And I'm like, I need to I need a palette cleanser. So then I watched bridgerton
7705220	7707220	It's fucking great. I love bridgerton
7707380	7709700	I love bridgerton so much. I can't wait for it to come back
7710260	7711940	in a couple days
7711940	7717140	I hate that shows split it up split stuff up into two fucking parts now. That is the stupidest shit ever
7717780	7719460	um
7719460	7722740	Yeah, I was watching that I literally binge watched that stupid tv show
7723780	7727940	It's watching watch the kissing booth on netflix the third one
7730740	7732740	Wasn't as good as the first though
7734340	7739380	Euphoria no euphoria with the people but the kid the angsty kids in high school
7739860	7742580	You guys have said the said this to me before
7743300	7745300	Not that euphoria
7746260	7748260	Not the visual novel
7751700	7756660	Yeah, exactly exactly exactly she'll watch that but she won't watch superheroes
7757300	7760260	Like she'll like watch like a marvel movie, but she like can't get it
7760260	7763220	So like me and my dad were like, oh, we're gonna go see furiosa
7763780	7769060	Um, I just in some of you know why I was watching mad max again. Um, my mom's like, yeah, that's for you guys
7770180	7772180	Okay
7773140	7775140	The one with spider man's girlfriend
7777060	7784020	Huh, I don't love I don't even I don't even read the visual novel. I don't know like I just know it's bad
7785780	7787780	I haven't read that
7788740	7790900	I've only ever read metamorphosis and that was
7794100	7801540	You're one of the 50 people who saw furiosa. I haven't seen it yet. I might just I don't think I'm gonna end up seeing it
7801780	7804340	Um in theaters because I wanted to see you in theaters
7805220	7809700	But it feels like it sucks because it's got really good ratings. It just got like shat on in the box office
7811380	7813380	But I heard it was good
7813700	7815700	I like the actress. Hello
7815780	7817460	Where does he happen?
7817460	7819460	We're just hanging out
7819940	7821940	I like, you know metamorphosizing
7823940	7830020	When I went to see furiosa, I was the only one there. I think it's because nobody fucking knew what it was about like mad max was
7830020	7832020	very hyped
7832900	7834900	Because people remember the old mad max
7835060	7837620	And then people now are just like, okay, but what's that about?
7838340	7840340	Yeah, it's got ania taylor joy or whatever her name is
7840900	7842420	but like
7842420	7844420	Charlie's there in as hot as fuck
7846500	7848500	But um
7848820	7850820	Oh, excuse me
7851060	7856660	Just fear your own flop. I don't I don't recall. It was okay. Like when I watched it again, I'm like, yeah, this is kind of what I remember
7857620	7862020	It was so weird because like listening to um
7864100	7866100	The actor for
7867460	7868580	max
7868580	7873940	talk, I realized that the the movie was like weirdly dubbed every time he spoke
7875220	7878900	Like I know he didn't speak often, but I was like, uh
7879780	7884740	It feels like somebody else's voice. Like I know he has an um, he usually has an english accent
7885620	7887620	Australian or something. I was like, huh?
7889700	7893140	I'm thinking about watching the uh original mad max stuff
7895540	7901700	Metamorphosis showed editing is only relenting watch barbie purely for Ryan gossip. Listen, I liked barbie
7903060	7907460	Maybe it's because I'm a woman. Maybe not. I enjoyed it a lot. I saw with my parents
7909300	7911300	My mom didn't like it
7912260	7919620	I think she was like it so it was okay. I really liked it. I like cried. I cried at that movie. I felt like it hit me
7921700	7926820	My dad was like it was cute. I think my dad liked him more than my mom then again, my dad's a Taylor Swift fan, so
7929860	7932980	Which way was turned black man Taylor Swift from the boys
7935780	7940020	Ryan Gosling is the goat if you watch drive. Yeah, I haven't actually seen drive. I just watched fall guy
7940660	7942660	with my parents
7942980	7944980	Your dad's a swift. Yes
7948100	7953300	I like he he was like, hey, you listen to Taylor's new album. I'm like dad. What the fuck he's like, you know
7954660	7960580	Comrade is a cat and he was like, so I'm sick of that. I'm like, what are you? I'm like dad, since when did you become a
7960580	7964420	Swiftie? He's like her new music bangs. I don't know what to tell you. I'm like, Jesus. Fuck dad
7966420	7968420	I'm not seeing drive. No
7969300	7972500	White women music is timeless. You're not wrong. You're not wrong
7974180	7976180	Again, my both of my parents have very
7976740	7979140	Range tastes and that's why I have very range tastes
7979300	7982500	But it's another reason why I don't like country because I never listened to country growing up
7982660	7984500	I listened to everything else besides country
7984500	7988740	I would go to bed listening to classical music because my mom would make sure I listened to classical music
7989060	7992420	And then I would go to school. My mom would play some 80s music
7993060	7998900	She would pick me up from home and she would play fucking breaking Benjamin in three days grace
7999860	8005860	Depending on the day that she had then my dad would play some like 80s or 90s rap and then
8006820	8008820	All like, yeah, I just I was very well
8009300	8013620	well around it and then I would listen to pop punk and just like alternative and metal
8015220	8017220	Um
8017300	8021780	My mom dated a guy who watched pitch perfect every week and played this soundtrack to him from work
8021860	8027380	Oh god, I would hate that although pitch perfect. Like it was a good movie. I did like pitch perfect the first one
8028420	8033780	Um, some country music is good. I know I have like one of my friends and it's funny because she's like very russian
8034980	8036980	Like very like think of icy
8037620	8039620	But like dialed up to a 10
8040340	8044660	And I see he's not even russian, but like they have the same accent though dialed up to a 10
8044900	8046900	and then
8047220	8049220	she
8049220	8055300	Really likes fucking country, but she's also she has like the bluntness that some like culturally russian people just have
8055380	8060260	They're just like very blunt and it can come across as like being a little abrasive
8060260	8062500	But she's a total sweetheart
8063220	8067140	And so she like listens to country and I'm just like this is so weird to me
8068020	8070020	I feel like you should be hating this
8070340	8073460	Basically ice with a vodka bottle in a cake
8074980	8076820	Yeah
8076820	8079060	George story they didn't last long. Thank thank god for her
8081380	8083460	Um, you have a live stream of just them
8086660	8089940	Yeah, I don't think I would do a live stream because they would probably just say
8091300	8094580	My name I did a collab once with some iRL friends
8095140	8100580	Um in my my uh past life and one of them called me by my first name, but nobody noticed
8102980	8104980	None of my audience notice
8106180	8107700	It was very funny
8107700	8111700	I was everybody went silent too because I had like asked them like okay. Don't use my name
8112340	8114340	Please look like the company
8115140	8117140	And uh
8117620	8123140	One of the one of the girls was just like hey, and I'm like doesn't respond
8124740	8126740	Um
8129540	8131620	Yeah, because sometimes this happens and I know like
8132740	8134740	I think my dad would be able to
8135140	8137860	It's call me by she be but I think my mom would
8138660	8140660	Find it hard
8141860	8145220	Because my dad gets it because he watched uh, he watches a lot of twitch streamers and stuff
8145540	8148660	I want to be surprised when my dad got into vTubers now. I have to ask him
8149460	8152180	I maybe I'll recommend him some vTubers. He's a very much
8152180	8155780	He only likes to watch like cod and stuff though and like sometimes fortnite
8158020	8161380	I don't know if there's any maybe I don't think yeah, no my dad doesn't like valent
8162980	8166260	Your dad watching ninja. No, he watched like nick mercs or something
8169140	8172580	I feel yeah, no, I know my dad would like probably really like vTubers if you watch them
8173780	8179940	Your dad the actually the best vTuber. I would see my dad getting a model like that one guy. That's like an orc
8183140	8185700	I have your dad sign up for the next holostars
8188820	8193220	That would actually be so sick though if my dad was at holostars
8194180	8196180	He would get in he was so get in
8197060	8199060	Is that a 14 year old boy?
8200100	8202100	Yes, no
8203380	8206740	That would be so funny. What's the male equivalent of a hag?
8206980	8211540	Because my mom is like definitely like peko mama
8214100	8216100	Um just like chill and shit
8217540	8219540	A gilf
8219940	8225860	She have a papa for holostars. I was like, oh, no, don't call my dad. Oh, do you say no? No, no, no, no
8226100	8228740	Stop it. Cut the cut the cut the cameras. No, thank you
8231060	8233060	I don't like that
8233060	8235060	Is the guysy
8235540	8237540	Adil
8238420	8240420	That's not the equivalent of a hag
8241540	8244660	Silver fox. I like that a zaddy
8247700	8250980	Can't wait to say daddy cotton mom 360 no scope a 12 year old
8251460	8252980	It's really funny because
8252980	8256100	Again, my dad has like a naturally very very very deep voice
8256180	8259380	But he when he's very excited just like me his voice pitches up
8260020	8262020	And I'd be like
8263540	8267780	Chackle hysterically and I'm just uh because like so he would game in the living room
8267780	8273540	And I would game in my bedroom and my mom would just be like chilling watching my dad play or like playing like some like
8273620	8276820	I don't know candy crush while she on her iPad all my dad plays games
8277460	8279060	um
8279060	8281300	And I would just hear him screaming in the next room
8282820	8284820	And my mom's like redacted
8285300	8287300	Be quiet. I'm trying to read
8288180	8290180	I'm trying to study the bible right now
8294180	8298660	My mom oh no, my mom my mom um, I don't know she she kind of like
8299220	8303060	I'm surprised she can sit there and kind of like do her own thing while my dad plays
8303460	8304420	um
8304420	8310820	Because once my dad knows he has an audience like if I'm sitting beside him like when I was like doing homework for school or something
8311140	8313140	That's he starts to narrate and commentate
8314820	8316820	As if he's a streamer
8317540	8320260	And it's it's very very amusing
8321300	8327620	So when he's serious, he's six five, but he's excited. He's five two. That's actually accurate. My dad is is that tall
8331300	8333860	Yeah, he's naturally a streamer. I guess that's where I inherited it from
8335460	8338500	So he would be natural in hollow stars. He'd be like, uh
8339380	8342260	Wait, no, is that Niji Sanji or is that hollow stars again? I don't watch
8343300	8346500	LVTubers. Um, what is his name like gold bullet?
8347460	8349460	Is he the brown who's the brown one?
8350580	8352580	Who are the tan
8354420	8356420	My dad's built different
8356980	8360100	I can see why you're crazy. Yeah, that's accurate
8361540	8363540	Gold bullet is hollow stars. Okay
8363940	8368020	There you go. Like he could be BFFs with gold bullet. That's the type of name my dad would pick for himself
8368260	8370260	Can we just talk about how stupid
8370260	8375940	Male names are like women's names are normal like she be cotton bum. Come on. That's an amazing name
8377460	8379460	Gold bullet
8380180	8382180	Vazelius bandage
8383300	8385460	Who is picking these fucking names?
8388180	8390180	Jesus
8391780	8394500	Gold bullet is an awesome name you take that back
8395940	8397940	Bandit, no it's not
8398340	8400340	Vantacro bringer
8400340	8405060	honestly, if they named him like something Vantacro that would have been cool like
8406020	8408500	Umohoshi Vantacro like that's fine
8409460	8413060	Hanabama is so normal. I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, I didn't get to pick my name either
8413700	8418180	Because they I'm pretty sure they get to pick their names and design their characters. Don't they or is hollow
8419460	8425220	Is hollow also cast for character? Do Niji and hollow allow the talent to make to make your own character?
8426820	8430660	Shibuya just me as uh, what's his name cyborg?
8435380	8439940	Vantacro bringer. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, Vantacro bringer perfect calm van
8442100	8444100	Vantacro bringer
8444500	8448900	You really got bum in your name. Yeah, because I got a fat ass. I'm gonna stick in your face and sit on it
8448900	8450900	Smother you shut the fuck up
8451380	8453380	No, only the second third offense. Oh, okay
8453700	8455700	Streamers pick the names
8456900	8458900	Um, you know, yeah mercy picked her name
8459380	8461380	She was able to pick her name because
8461380	8463380	Karam beat
8463380	8464660	Was just not
8464660	8466660	Not having a good time
8467860	8470100	Shibuya's gyat. No, my gyat is non-existent
8472340	8477860	Um, I remember like yeah, uh, Strani asked me if I wanted to like change anything like I
8479060	8481060	I could have changed like my logo
8481460	8485300	I could have changed I couldn't change like my character obviously, but she's like is
8486020	8488740	Is your name cool? And I'm like, yes, I thought it was hilarious
8489540	8494100	I was like, I kind of liked that. It was very close to being
8495620	8498900	Nijisanji holo stars level of out of pocket
8500340	8504980	Strani, so yeah, oh most of like like you guys know I'm getting a tan toggle
8507140	8509140	You guys know I'm getting a tan toggle
8510420	8512740	Um spoiler. I'm also changing my eye color
8512900	8514900	I
8515460	8520740	Know you might not like it, but I might only use I don't know if it's gonna be only with the tan toggle that my eye color changes
8521700	8522900	Um
8522900	8526980	I wanted to do I know nobody has blue eyes in our gen
8528500	8530740	Nobody has blue eyes, so I'm like give me blue eyes
8532100	8533060	because
8533060	8535060	Yeah, mercies are reddish
8535700	8537940	Strani's are like greenish yellow purple
8538900	8544500	Uh me and Azura have this and I see have the same colored eyes and um
8545220	8547220	Emmys are also purple
8549060	8554420	Yeah, so I'm gonna do instead of blue eyes white dragon. I'm tan she be blue eyes
8555140	8557140	blue eyes tan she be
8558580	8560580	Um
8560820	8563940	Getting glasses. I just like get an asset of glasses. I don't know
8564340	8569620	But I don't know I have to I don't know if it's gonna be a permanent thing that I have blue eyes
8570500	8571620	um
8571620	8573620	Yeah
8574420	8575620	No my gold eyes
8575620	8577460	You know, I love the gold eyes
8577460	8584180	It just it just looked really weird with the tan skin tone to be honest with you because like uh, I was telling her
8584180	8589140	I'm like, oh because our my the artists in the regular are working on it right now and um
8590100	8594580	I don't know when they're gonna be done. I might be like a month or so. So you will not have
8595540	8597540	tan she be quite yet
8598340	8602500	um, because they're also working on cover-ups for me and Azura I think but um
8604020	8607220	I was messing around like okay. Maybe if I had this sort of skin tone
8607860	8609860	I was trying to be close to my normal skin tone
8609940	8614180	But then I was like I was holding up my hands to the thing and I'm like, holy fuck. I'm so pale
8614340	8619780	So I kind of made myself just a little bit darker like when I'm in the like when I've gone to the beach
8621460	8624580	Rather than when I haven't left my home for like a year
8628020	8632900	Tan she be I don't I don't know if I will be tan by monetization. Who knows?
8633780	8638340	Um, but yeah, the the gold, you know what? Fuck it. I'll just show you. I'll just show you the screenshot
8638420	8640420	I sent to strongy and I don't really care
8645140	8647140	Do-do-do
8648100	8652020	Because I was I kind of made the undertone of my skin a little bit too red
8653300	8658980	Um, because I like I kind of so my tan skin kind of does clash with my color palette a bit
8659700	8662980	Um, like if my red was a little bit brighter it might stand out more
8665700	8669860	Because my mixture because like uh, I'm like a mixture of monochrome and
8670820	8671860	um
8671860	8677700	And my my main color is red and that I feel like that works extremely well with my hair
8678580	8680580	and my um
8683700	8689060	My like the yeah in my eyes, but when I'm tan it just doesn't
8690420	8692420	It just looks too red. I don't
8692980	8696420	I don't know how to explain it to you because like it's just like it's all color theory really
8696740	8698740	That's why you see a lot of more like tan
8698900	8700900	Um
8701060	8704660	She was with like if they have warmer colors in their palette
8705140	8707140	It's like an accent color
8707460	8712100	Rather than like a main color, but you know, I'm completely completely wrong or it's normally like cool colored tones
8712580	8716020	It's really depending on like what what type of black you are, you know
8718580	8720580	I mean, where's the screenshot?
8721540	8723540	I
8725300	8728340	Was like this makes like I look just like fucking burnt
8732500	8735300	I look sunburned a little bit
8737380	8741140	Um, and that's with the blue eyes. So it looks it looks pretty nice
8741700	8746260	I realize however the eye the layers on my uh, my right eye
8746980	8748980	We're not cut properly
8749220	8753300	They were not separated at the same as my left eye. So I couldn't get quite the
8753940	8755940	color that I wanted for the
8755940	8757940	for the eye tone
8760180	8763300	Yeah, they look grayish it's it's never meant to be a blue
8765140	8770740	Die my hair. I don't know but I like I like the blonde like blonde with tan skin looks so good
8771700	8774660	Like so I wish I could because I used to uh, I'll be honest with you
8774980	8781060	Um rtx she be I used to have icy blonde hair and it looked fucking gorgeous against my skin
8782260	8784260	Like a fine grilled wagyu
8785540	8789300	Yeah blonde and tan and like I feel like it fits better with the gyaru, you know
8790580	8792580	If it's way better with the gyaru
8793380	8795380	But you'll notice
8795620	8797620	Like you'll see like how my
8798580	8802100	Like my my on my color palette needs to kind of be brightened up
8802740	8807220	In terms of like my reds seem to be a bit more intense because they're like a lighter red
8807300	8809300	So they need to be a little bit brighter. I think
8810500	8812500	You know
8813140	8814420	Um
8814420	8816580	And let me show you the other screenshot I took
8817540	8819780	Yeah, I couldn't fucking get the eyes right
8822900	8824900	Because of the layering issue
8825380	8830260	Because it like just darkened the top my eyes look fucking pitch black
8836820	8838820	Yeah
8840500	8842500	Which way western man
8843940	8847220	Um, I actually like me with darker eyes to be honest with you
8848980	8853460	I look very nefarious. I feel like I look more bunny like especially when I have my little
8854900	8860180	I probably will have like my uwu mouth as a permanent thing because I feel like it shows off that I'm like
8860660	8863780	More bunny like because like it makes my teeth look a certain way
8865060	8869940	It's both an option. Well, it's gonna be a toggle again. I am going to be she be copper bum
8871620	8873620	This is she be copper bum right here
8874260	8877780	Does she be copper bum just like copper cat mouse
8878100	8886820	But yeah, I think like look at don't I look like such a fucking succubus in this picture like god damn
8889700	8893700	I was debating whether or not to like add another mole somewhere too. I think that could be really cute
8894100	8896100	Well, like I'll probably do that in the 2.0
8897860	8901380	It's copper bum single. Yeah, but she does not want to get with you
8904020	8906020	Um
8906740	8908740	Madam only
8908980	8913140	Uh, my tan lines would go. Yes, like I feel like tan lines would be really good with it too
8915860	8917860	Let me critical it
8919220	8921220	Out of tail I have a tail
8921460	8924580	You just can't see it. I have a bunny tail guys
8925860	8927620	But crazy thing
8927620	8930100	I can't turn around and show it to you
8930100	8932100	So
8932260	8936260	I don't know how you expect me to show a bunny tail when they're a little bit
8937140	8939140	They're like tucked in
8941220	8943460	Yes, I'm a fucking rabbit. Of course I have a tail
8946900	8948900	Yes, I was telling um
8949780	8954580	Strawny to tell the artist that I need to like I need I'll need to change my ear
8955140	8961540	Um color because I couldn't do it because the the ear the inner ear isn't separated from the the
8961940	8965060	Like the fur part of the ear. So I couldn't change the color of that
8966820	8970100	You can't believe you're coming. I was trans Rachel. Call me Rachel Dozel
8971620	8974660	Call me Rachel Dozel. I am trans Rachel
8979380	8981380	I'm sorry you got yeeted for that
8982020	8988020	Uh any alt costable I want to do ghiattu naturally. I would love to do ghiattu school girl. Um
8990260	8992260	I really don't probably like
8992500	8997700	Moff not like mafia boss look because I kind of already got that going on with the office wear my pops kala
8998260	9000260	um probably
9001220	9003220	some sort of like
9004660	9008420	More madame like like victorian madame brothel owner
9008820	9013780	Who is in Paris? We finally know the answer to this
9015540	9017540	Who is in Paris?
9017700	9021060	Yes, I really want to do a like
9022740	9025860	Tan bully like older nagatoro
9026820	9028420	sort of thing
9028420	9030420	Ojusama, yeah
9033460	9037140	And to be honest, I would honestly like a cute and funny toggle as well at some point
9038820	9043540	An old victorian child outfit. Yeah, I just want to wear victor like a dead victorian child
9043540	9046260	That's just eaten pop rocks for the first time and couldn't handle it

9982100	9984100	Hag love
9985060	9989220	Still 20 years younger than madam. That's what I mean. That's foul
9991540	9994340	I identify as 25. Yeah, I'm 56 guys
9996660	9999300	She meant she's in her threes. She's divisible by three
10000100	10002100	Okay, um
10007780	10009460	Okay, this one I can say outside
10009460	10013540	Hi, she be I've been head over heels for you since you spat in our collective mouths in your debut
10013860	10018980	Talk about a power move. I've only become more impressed in enamored as time gone on because of your chill dorky vibes
10018980	10020980	Your maculite memory and your rutless
10021540	10022900	I can't see that
10022900	10024260	What does that mean?
10024260	10026260	Say sexiness. I don't know probably
10026820	10030660	Um, it feels like such a rarity to see someone who doesn't just play a dom in role plays
10030660	10032820	But actually and is and loves being dominant
10032980	10036420	No shade to the people who are putting on an act is still wonderful content
10036500	10038900	But I think it hits different when you know that the words are heartfelt
10039460	10044100	Have you had much real life experience doming people? And if so, are there any particular events or scenes to stand out to?
10044100	10046100	You've been da-da-da-da
10046260	10049700	Uh stream audio is really good at both. It's funny because you're wrong
10049940	10051940	Um
10054420	10056420	Uh, I've been very transparent
10057140	10061140	That I'm normally a switch, but again, I am very knowledgeable
10062340	10064180	with um
10064180	10066180	That side of things
10066660	10070180	Uh, I have not had real life experience doing that
10070980	10072180	Um
10072180	10073540	Sorry
10073540	10075540	Sorry to break the kayfabe for you
10076660	10079460	Um, but I am realizing
10079700	10082580	As I am learning more and you guys are teaching me
10083220	10084820	that
10084820	10087220	I am really fucking enjoying it. I uh
10088100	10093220	Like what I did earlier in stream today where I kind of just bitched at you guys and bossed you around
10093860	10098260	Oh, that was nice. That made me feel very good. You have no idea. I'm telling strongy right now
10099620	10101620	But yeah, um
10101700	10103700	I don't yeah, no, I don't
10103780	10105780	I do
10106260	10108660	I do put on the act sometimes
10108740	10112820	But the majority of the time late like when I first like the first like two days
10112900	10116020	I was putting on an act then after that I was like, holy shit. I actually like this
10116580	10118580	Like I actually don't mind this
10120180	10122180	Um, and if that bothers you
10123780	10125780	I'm sorry
10126340	10128340	But I don't care
10128340	10130740	If it bothers you then I'm normally a switch
10131620	10134180	I don't care. I really don't
10135140	10138180	Cry I want you to cry. Can you record yourself crying to me?
10139060	10142500	So I can fucking laugh at your stupid little boy tears. Thank you
10145540	10147540	Yes
10149140	10151140	Um
10152020	10154020	Madam if I wait
10156180	10158180	I can't read that out loud um
10159860	10163380	Is there anything particular I want in videos and go follow your heart, dude
10164020	10166020	I get a lot of questions asking me to
10167380	10169380	Um, you're more of a bully
10169860	10172820	Yeah, because that's how how am I supposed to do?
10174660	10176660	More dom related things
10177780	10179940	When one this is not an actual
10180820	10182660	Dom sub relationship
10182660	10188260	We have not gone through like actual consent forms. I don't know what you like. I don't know what you're into
10188260	10193380	I can't inflict pain upon you. I can't do the acts you're asking me to it's all audio
10194100	10196100	I am so limited
10196660	10198820	In my character with what I can do
10201620	10203620	Whereas I see
10204020	10208340	She can do age play just fine. It's not hard for her to do that. It's easier to like
10209860	10214820	Regress to a child than it is to an act like one which was appealing to her fan base
10215540	10217540	than to
10218500	10221460	Have me pretend like do you want me to pretend to punch you like?
10223860	10225220	If you
10225220	10226980	can tell me
10226980	10228980	How to be better

10237140	10241060	I read it this morning and I took the advice someone said to me
10241940	10245380	You should use your crop intermittently and wave it in front of the mic
10245860	10252100	And make the user anticipate and not know when you're gonna hit it and I'm like that is perfect. Thank you
10253540	10255380	Thank you
10255380	10257380	That is constructive
10257380	10259380	advice

10270260	10272500	And so I try to do a little bit of that with this microphone
10272500	10276500	But I didn't really work that well because you can't really hear the movement in front of the mic
10277940	10279460	um
10279460	10283620	So yeah, see thank you. I can instruct you to do stuff
10284420	10286420	um

10411380	10413380	I didn't
10413460	10416980	If you're memeing, I don't care if you're not memeing that sucks
10422020	10427620	Thought I was terminally online dude. I'm a vtuber. I literally I live on the internet. What do you expect?
10428500	10430020	okay
10430020	10434500	Anyways, if I was to do if I was to do a video of me straw in my cuddles
10435220	10437220	Yeah, I kind of already answered that
10438340	10440340	Um here me
10443860	10445860	This is a perfect
10458180	10462180	If you want to send me a video of you wearing color and leash go ahead
10462500	10468500	Say how awesome I am go ahead do it
10471940	10473940	Do it you won't
10474580	10476980	Go buy the collar right now go on amazon
10477700	10482980	Buy yourself a I even when I first started streaming. I told people to get a collar
10484100	10487220	Because you are my dogs. You are my pets and none of you fucking did that
10487940	10491540	By the way, I think people thought I was just joking. I wasn't joking
10492340	10494340	because
10494900	10497300	I'm like, oh because like collaring is a very
10498260	10500260	intense like
10501140	10508340	But respectful deep connection with your dom when they you get collared
10510740	10517620	And none of you fucking got collared and when I so look up look up what collaring is in the btsm community
10517940	10521460	Because you're thinking of like wearing a dog collar. No you get yourself a necklace
10521460	10523460	It can be you know discreet
10524180	10526180	It can be something
10526900	10532420	Simple or you can wear like a bracelet or something just to show people that you are owned
10533300	10535140	by me
10535140	10537140	I am your owner
10539700	10544020	If I was a color what color would I be I don't know like red and it's only everywhere
10544020	10553300	First Gunpla build and you have to respond to me about how much time I'm wasting with childish activities. Oh, yeah, sure. Don't worry about that
10555780	10557540	I know I love but she's
10557540	10563700	If one is broke could a dark metallic. Yeah, that's fine. Like it doesn't have to be like it could be like if you
10564500	10568020	Have a necklace that you already own and it means a lot to you
10569940	10573140	You can use that as a representation you can put it on
10574980	10576980	And that can be your collar
10580740	10583700	It doesn't have to be like a fancy collar
10583780	10588020	It doesn't have to be like one of those like stainless steel crazy things with a lock
10588420	10592260	You can it could usually it's sometimes they've been a lot more discreet
10593940	10595940	When I was doing research on it
10596180	10598100	um
10598100	10603300	And I saw like one girl because I was just like on tick-tock because I was like btsm tips. Hello
10603780	10606900	and one girl literally her uh
10608500	10614020	Her I don't know if it was a freaking husband or boyfriend. Um her Dom just got her a normal necklace
10614100	10616580	And I had like a little heart with a lock on it. I'm like wow
10617460	10620260	It's that simple. Okay guys get yourself a fucking collar
10621460	10623620	That's literally what happens and then nobody did it
10624980	10630660	I never wanted to ruin accessories exactly. It's usually a significant thing. It's very important. It's our connection
10630900	10634500	You are owned. I own you. It can be a ring. It can be a necklace
10634740	10638420	It can be a fucking earring. It could be a fucking toe ring a bracelet
10638900	10642660	A cock ring whatever you fucking you just have to wear it all the time
10642740	10647700	You can't take it off because I own you I can only take it off. I can only tell you when to take it off
10648900	10650900	It would clash with my outfit too fucking bad
10652740	10656180	Hang the chibi key. Yeah the key chain the fucking key chain you bought
10656180	10664660	The key chain the link is in the description to my merch can be the collar to show that you are owned when you buy it
10667300	10669300	Sorry she bet that you're trolling
10669860	10674980	And it's hard because I I do joke a lot so people sometimes like I'll say something. They're like, oh, she's kidding. I'm no I'm fucking not
10676100	10678500	Maybe my the safe word should be when I'm not joking anymore
10679540	10682580	Like uh, I'll just say like stilettos and then you'll know that I'm not joking
10687060	10691060	I'm buying a ring and then gray with the sheebie if you want to be out if you want to do that go ahead
10691620	10694980	I own you now. Please wear something to reflect that
10696340	10702420	You know, you have like you have ic and emmy and mercy and they're all very possessive of their own ways
10703940	10705700	They're possessive
10705700	10709140	I am possessive as well. We are all possessive
10711380	10714900	Me uh, you can watch the other girls
10716580	10718900	You can support, you know, the girls and my gen
10720340	10723460	Um, you could have you know, they're oh she marks on your name
10725220	10727220	For the moment you get a fucking collar
10727540	10733700	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can you know be cute with them. You're fucking mine when you put on the collar though, sweetheart. Okay
10738340	10740340	I am possessive I do get jealous
10741060	10743060	I don't like sharing my toys
10743700	10745700	Um, I'll share them with the girls
10746500	10751220	I know sometimes they do don't you know mercy has a list, right? She has a list. I remember she was showing me
10751220	10752980	She's a list of your names
10752980	10755380	um of those of people who
10756180	10758180	seemed to be double dipping
10762900	10764900	It sounds like too much. Okay, I think I got the fuck out
10766020	10768020	Yeah, she has a list who's been naughty
10768820	10770740	and who's been uh
10770740	10775780	Like trying to be like an ojisan and a in a snippet and a this and a that
10778820	10780820	She was cast so well, wasn't she?
10792340	10794340	Yeah
10800740	10805140	So glad mercy yeah mercy streams during my bedtime too. Um, she watches you while you sleep though
10805220	10809300	She was telling me she shared you she just sent a picture of myself sleeping. It was pretty crazy
10810100	10812820	Um, is mercy willing to share between viola girls, you know
10813940	10815940	um
10817860	10822580	I hope you guys like understand like when we say like, oh, I want you all to myself
10823140	10825140	That really means like within viola
10825860	10830340	But it's like there's I know there's like super dedicated regulars in everybody's chat
10830980	10832980	um
10833540	10835220	And like
10835220	10838020	It's when like it it it bothers the girls
10839700	10842820	When you say that there you're oh she
10844420	10847780	But then you call another girl your kami oh she
10849380	10853300	Because that's just being a whore derogatory
10856100	10858100	Because we're whores affectionate, you know
10860740	10865940	But like I kind of know I was just responding to the marrow that I was saying out loud that was reading. Um
10869060	10872820	But like I will always support the girls
10873780	10875460	And I don't mind
10875460	10879940	If you watch the other girls, that's fine. I'm I'm someone who I share the love
10880500	10886980	I I want to make sure everybody succeeds everybody that comes into the vicinity of me. Cool. Um
10887620	10891540	The other girls may not be like that. Uh, I'm pretty they're like that within our gen
10892260	10893780	but
10893780	10897300	If they I know I have I've honestly in the past like when I was
10897940	10904020	A priestess I would see like my regulars and someone else's like my french chat. I would honestly
10905300	10907300	Get super upset
10908100	10909700	Because like
10909700	10914100	I don't know. I was it was like I was like, oh, I just caught you with another woman. Um
10914980	10916980	But I think I've grown since that
10917620	10919620	Since, you know, a couple months ago
10920340	10923300	Um to be fair, I probably use this term for idol culture called kami oh shi
10923380	10929060	But no, sorry. Sorry. It was like they go I misspoke. They would call someone kami oh shi and then the girl kami oh shi
10930340	10931220	That's what I meant
10931220	10933220	Not oh shi oh shi because I almost said oh shi
10933700	10939060	Oh shi, but then I was like no oh shi kami oh shi that I meant to say kami oh shi oh shi kami oh shi kami oh shi
10940100	10942100	Say that five times fucking fast
10944660	10948820	Yeah, exactly. So mercy knows who's done that because you some of you have done it
10949700	10951700	I know too now
10956100	10958100	Uh
10961460	10965140	This is a good question. This is a very good question. Okay, this is probably a weird question
10965220	10967940	This is what they started off with but I just don't want to cause trouble
10968020	10972820	I am not 100 into dom sub but I watch you for your taste in games base takes memes and jokes
10973140	10975140	Still, there is quite some role playing in chat
10975780	10980340	Should people like me rather be lurkers and not interact? I have the feeling I would destroy the hegemony in chat
10980980	10982980	um
10983060	10986340	You can respond to what you respond to so like if you were
10987300	10990900	Not into like what I did earlier like you don't have to respond to that
10990980	10995380	you're not obligated to participate if you're not consenting because um
10996020	10998020	That sort of plate is all about consent
10998340	11003380	Um, I do make the jokes about like I don't believe in a safe word, but you know in real life
11004740	11007940	Consent is important and I'm not going to force you
11009460	11011940	To talk in a chat that you're not comfortable in
11013300	11015300	You know like, um
11017060	11022420	So difficult as I like with hanging on my singular talent so it makes me feel horrible and torn. That's yeah, that's why I'm like I don't
11024420	11026820	I want you to enjoy who you enjoy
11028900	11030900	I don't want you to feel bad
11032500	11035860	But then I also have people on the other hand who wish I was more possessive
11035940	11037300	So I'm like
11037300	11038740	I am possessive of you guys
11038740	11044180	I do get a little hurt when I see you in somebody else's chat not the other but it's funny. It's not the other girls like I'm like
11045140	11047140	I don't know. It's like
11047140	11049140	It's like we're all sister wives
11051380	11053060	I think
11053060	11055060	Yeah, I don't know. I don't really know
11055700	11060980	You'd have to ask them you have you'd have to really ask them because I'm like, uh, you know, what is what it is
11062900	11065300	Where should we send the color proof right you send to my mirrors?
11067060	11069060	Take a picture put it in cat box
11069940	11071940	um
11072980	11075220	But yeah, you don't have to you can lurk
11076180	11078900	Um, you can only you can talk when you want to participate
11079540	11083540	Um, I don't if you like say like hi and I'm just like you're a fucking bitch
11083540	11085540	Like I don't think anybody's gonna freak out
11086820	11088820	And if they do who the fuck cares
11089140	11091140	If it bothers them so much they'll just ignore you
11092020	11096820	If it throws off the flow of chat, then I probably just might not respond but don't take it personally
11097540	11099540	um, you gotta learn
11100980	11102980	That like it's the internet
11103140	11105300	Why do you give a fuck about what people think about you?
11106100	11109940	In a vtuber bunny dominatrix group chat especially, you know
11111140	11113460	Everybody's saying hi. Hi. Hi. Hello
11114420	11119780	I'm still so dark. Should I I should um, I think we're good for call of the lamp for now. So I'll quit that
11123220	11125220	No, I should probably save
11127460	11129620	I'm red. Ah red whooping jump scare
11131300	11133300	Oh my god, I'm still red. Why hasn't it gone away?
11134500	11136500	I got a sunburn
11137380	11139380	There you go
11139700	11141700	And then I forget how pale I am
11143540	11145540	Oh me for real for real
11146740	11148740	It's just like she's Deadpool
11149380	11154180	So mad. Oh, no, that's my crying. Uh, uh, so mad
11156980	11158260	Ah
11158260	11161940	I have to make the most exaggerated faces to frown. Um, but yeah
11163140	11164420	so
11164420	11170020	Hope that answers your question. I'm gonna just reply like so I'll like I answer the question out loud
11170980	11177540	Thank you, Jay reads Jay reads tipped $13 and 37 cents. My safe word is give me my money back
11178260	11183380	I did not consent to this. Oh, no, my money's escaping from wallet right now
11184100	11186100	Oh, no, no
11186820	11188820	Oh
11198580	11205060	Sorry and my uh, there's a disclaimer for when you donate no free funds, baby cakes
11207620	11212420	Oh, but thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. He's getting taste
11213780	11215780	That works
11216660	11219940	I'm sorry. Your safe word must contain between eight to 25 letters
11220660	11224740	Unique letters and numbers and must have one capital and one unique character
11225460	11227460	In special character
11232260	11235780	I think there is a level of some people wanting an owner and others want silly blue goat. Yeah
11235860	11238900	It's like there's a balance that I have to maintain. Um
11239620	11244180	You're not the only person watching me. I know. Uh, I like to make you feel that way
11244660	11246820	Um, I like to make you feel special because you are
11247540	11253780	Okay, if you are a very special person, especially to me, I really appreciate you watching me now. Okay, if you back on, um
11255300	11257060	But
11257060	11260500	I can't tailor every fucking thing to you. I'm so sorry
11261780	11263300	like
11263300	11267060	There is half of you that want me to be this half of you want me to this and then some of you that want me to
11267060	11270420	Know that to be anything at all the shy guy tipped eight dollars
11270660	11276740	Thank you shy guy answering on stream btw less than three. Oh, of course no problem
11277860	11279860	BTW less than three
11280020	11284900	And it's like the angled thing. That's funny. I can't please everyone and neither can the other girls
11287460	11290980	Like people wish that azura was more like
11291700	11296900	Sexual or whatever mind you she her fucking voice is sex. So I don't know what the fuck you're on. Um
11297300	11299300	And that like
11300740	11303780	I see isn't as mesugaki as we you know
11304740	11306740	made her out to be and
11306740	11308660	emmy is you know
11308660	11312740	More crazy sister than little girl. We made out like I don't know like
11313620	11319780	In mercy is also a little dork and on top of being a yandere. She's not just crazy all the time. It's like guys are normal
11320900	11324580	Personalities are gonna shine through because that's what actually draws you in you
11325540	11329780	Spoiler alert you watch the streamers for their real personality that leaks through
11331060	11332740	not because
11332740	11338420	like imagine you watch the streamer that 24 7 was role playing that they were some
11339380	11341380	fucking fox spirit
11342580	11345140	Or whatever the hell it gets boring
11346500	11348100	Because it's not
11348100	11350100	It's a one-sided character
11350580	11356340	Like you can only like unless you like flesh out your entire lore in kayfabe like and and
11357300	11359860	You can't really get that deep into it. I'm sorry
11361460	11364180	And most people don't even bother with the lore like this dude like you just said
11365300	11367300	It's funny because I hear people
11367860	11369860	so often
11370020	11373220	Say like I wish they would just forget it with the lore because the lord makes no sense
11373300	11375460	There's no point in putting a lore in a debut
11376100	11378340	But then I guess for real lure everybody's just like
11379460	11384580	You have to stick to your lore in your kayfabe. I'm gonna fucking kill myself. That's what you sound like
11386660	11389780	Arrivals for your affection let me at them fight me chat
11390740	11394260	I'm really much a youtuber like I was the train all day. Yeah, see that's more interesting
11395860	11399460	But it's like you have the complexity of our personalities on top
11400820	11401940	of
11401940	11402900	You know
11402980	11405700	War characters are like I'm
11406820	11408260	naturally
11408260	11409460	normally
11409460	11411220	a very teasy
11411220	11413220	flirty bully person like I
11413780	11415780	crack a lot of jokes
11415780	11417780	I also rage at games
11418580	11420580	And I was picked
11420900	11422900	Because I was a good
11423620	11425060	creator
11425060	11426500	not because I
11426500	11428500	perfectly fit the character
11429460	11431780	The straw knee and squishy ghoul made up
11432660	11434340	it probably like
11434340	11436340	bumfuck 1am
11437540	11439540	And straw knees probably like drinking
11440180	11442260	Be like front of the bosom. No
11444980	11446980	And I love cats. Yes
11447620	11449620	I'm not a rabbit IRL. Yeah
11450020	11452020	No, I am a rabbit
11452260	11453380	um
11453380	11455380	Somebody made a joke. I was watching
11455620	11458740	This like podcast and review of our debuts and somebody made a joke
11459460	11463700	They're like, I love how she's allergic to rabbits. Does she just wake up and she's in constant pain?
11464580	11466580	She just wakes up. He goes, uh
11466740	11470900	Just sneezes all the time. I'm like, oh, fuck. I should make that a joke. Like I'm just like, oh guys. I
11471540	11473540	I chew
11475460	11477460	Um
11478420	11480420	Yes
11480740	11484020	Do do do do do other maybe liquors, um
11485220	11490020	Only respond to what you feel comfortable
11492180	11494820	Participating and of course
11497700	11500820	If that doesn't float to your boat
11506500	11509620	No problem and no pressure
11510740	11512740	To respond
11516580	11519780	Wake up paints a dumb pain every time I wake up
11521380	11525700	My body was that character from SpongeBob. He's like my body's made of paper and glass
11529300	11531300	I spelled doesn't wrong, but it's fine

11994180	11996980	Shit shit posted in your patreon voice
11997460	12001540	Your shit posted your patreon voice about taking madams juicy farts
12002020	12004020	You couldn't get it through
12004020	12007940	It because it's obscene, but ironically that stuff slaps for degenerates
12008180	12012500	It's just really depraved memory of doming, but we gaso goblins would give a limb
12012900	12017780	That if you wanted to add something to old toot pack that wasn't just blasting the mic with your cute toots
12019220	12021060	Do you

12093700	12097700	And I wondered how did you get that picture of that tanned gyaru bunny bully
12097860	12101060	That brings all kinds of nasty toys to torment with me at school
12101540	12104020	One day was a pair of handcuffs and she made me taste your socks
12104420	12109220	Another was a leash and she took me for a walk on the hallway last day. She gagged me flogged me and told me she
12109780	12111620	wanted to

12127700	12129700	I don't know how to respond to this
12133380	12137780	Huh, is this freddy? No, I don't think so. I don't think that's freddy

12192180	12196100	Nobody sends me like I I'm like I like responding to normal questions
12196900	12199060	But like, you know, that's too expected with maros
12202820	12206420	Um, is there any plans for doing rigging shabari caught in the future feature?
12206420	12210740	I always love seeing self ties and self suspension. So I'm ordering being the rope bun that you are if it'll be possible
12211220	12213220	Uh, I've never
12213620	12215620	Done shabari before
12218500	12221060	But I am aiming to do
12221700	12224900	self tying shabari streams
12226340	12227700	When
12227700	12229700	Memberships

12248660	12251700	Cool, I'm not using any proper grammar because just don't care right now
12260740	12262740	There's a plenty of civil war
12266420	12271860	There is a corner of the internet that acts as if a woman should somehow permanently stop being a top if she ever says
12271940	12275780	Please or if she displays any kind of a human emotion beyond contempt
12276260	12279380	Especially when she expresses regret let alone sadness or fear
12280020	12282660	To say I find it stupid and immature would be an understatement
12283140	12288420	Evidently these self-professed submissives don't want to be dominated by a woman. They want a robot or a corpse
12289780	12297300	They must must have much experience with the sm scene for madam to be the best domino she can be she has to undergo her own journey
12298340	12300340	That is fucking true
12302500	12308740	Hey, she be I must go to finish up dinner for these shrimp tacos, but wanted to rat out chat on a secret
12309540	12313460	Apparently they found photos of you being a bottom and are hiding it from you
12314180	12316900	Last I heard they hid it in the office somewhere

12460340	12463220	And I'm just like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about clearly. So

12747220	12749220	They're gonna not be happy with what you do
12749620	12751620	They're gonna do this. You're gonna do that
12753700	12755700	The majority like honestly
12755780	12759060	It doesn't eat me up at all that people are like, oh, you don't do this for me
12759140	12764420	Or like, oh, you don't do this or you don't do that. It's it's just you say it over and over and over again
12764420	12769700	I'm like, please shut the fuck up. I don't care. I've said I don't care. Stop telling me it
12771700	12773700	Did you ever meet? No, I've never met Keemstar
12776820	12778820	I've had them with like once in passing

12782420	12783540	um
12783540	12786820	I haven't seen a sent a mirror tweeted, but this reminds me of it. So I'll say it
12786820	12790260	I think you're already doing fine and kind of found it annoying when I was like, I need a Donmore
12790580	12796260	We're on to yeah, like what fans Lee might be another story late. Leah fans might be different
12798900	12800900	I thought drama alert was
12803620	12807940	Oh, I haven't watched that a very very long time. I've been out of that community for quite a bit quite a bit
12808660	12809700	um
12809700	12811460	after my
12811460	12814100	Former friends made the most stupidest fucking
12816660	12818660	Claim of all fucking time
12818900	12819860	um
12819860	12824820	Trying to bring someone down in the community. I hate I hate when people fucking lie
12825620	12827620	about stuff
12828020	12830740	Don't ever lie to me. Don't I'll figure it out
12832500	12833540	Uh
12833540	12835540	Keemstar just plays with people
12835620	12840260	I have a favorite song. My favorite song is um, Murakami by Maiden Heights
12841860	12843860	Oh
12847300	12852340	We'll need to get their panties on to this. You'll start it a week. Yeah, that's what people also need to like remember

12880740	12884180	You got like there's even the joke that vtubers change their voices
12885460	12892420	Like a month after debut because it's hard to keep the character on all the time unless you're like a professional professional voice actor
12892980	12894980	um or actress
12895540	12896420	uh
12896420	12901220	So like we're gonna grow a little bit more. We're gonna change. We're gonna be more comfortable with you

12950340	12954420	Yeah, I love bubbly by kobi. Oh good song
12956180	12958500	Enjoy the ride. Yeah, enjoy the ride
12960180	12965140	Like when I I used to watch this small agency start out
12967220	12969780	And it was like I hadn't been into vtubers in a while
12970260	12972580	I'd like would occasionally watch like a hollow girl
12973460	12975460	Or like a needy saunty girl or whatever
12976020	12978020	Um, I need a burp. I can't
12980340	12984900	Um, excuse me, uh, nothing came out. I don't know why I said excuse me
12986740	12992100	But then I was like they're like, oh take the corporal pill take the small corporal pill. So I'm like, okay, I did and I watched this
12992980	12994980	company
12995220	12996820	And I was like
12996820	12998580	holy crap
12998580	13002180	These girls are so talented and interesting and funny and cool
13002980	13004980	And they have really cool designs
13005860	13007860	And then this and they're that
13009860	13011380	so like
13011380	13014580	And I just I just enjoy I just sat and I enjoyed and I watched them
13014900	13018260	And then when I was like busy at a work or whatever and I couldn't catch them
13018340	13021380	I tuned in a month later. I'm like, oh my god. They're doing this now
13021780	13024340	Do you know another month later? Wow, they're doing this now
13024900	13026180	Holy crap
13026180	13029380	They're they're growing. They're being more successful. They're getting more opportunities
13030420	13033700	That's like the funnest part is watching people grow
13034660	13037540	And watching them become so passionate about something
13038500	13040500	I'm gonna get to zero out of 10
13042980	13047300	And that agency was Albert Einstein. No, I'll be fucking honest. It was it was a and project
13048900	13050900	It was a project
13051460	13053460	I really fucking liked a and project

13105860	13107860	Like we don't have any bad blood
13108420	13110420	um, because contents content
13110660	13114980	Companies different than their talents just how people see Nijisanji, you know
13115780	13117780	Not the best comparison, but you get what the fuck I'm saying

13583380	13585380	Mmm tea is good
13587300	13592420	Vealers uni will be iron but like we are very relaxed and kind of it's kind of
13593380	13596500	it's very refreshing being in vealer because
13597780	13602740	We don't have to hold back like strong always makes a dead joke like oh, we don't have a fucking hr department because like
13602980	13608900	And without that sort of like not like hr is actually good to have in normal cases, but like
13610980	13615620	We feel like we can truly be ourselves in vealer
13616660	13617940	um
13617940	13620820	I I'll even like I've said like my past life
13621460	13625460	Uh, I'll say her name because I'm just it's just easier to say like p. Oh, so when I was rena
13625860	13627860	Some of you might have known that I was rena
13627940	13629460	Oh rena. No
13629860	13637460	She was a cute little brown lolly cat and now I'm sheebie a big booby milfy bunny mubby. Um
13639860	13645220	I liked being rena, but I wasn't truly myself being rena
13646660	13649460	I actually feel more of myself as she be
13651380	13653380	Because I feel like I was
13654340	13660740	Sensoring myself so I could appeal to agencies. I want to join but then I ended up an agency where
13662020	13664020	I was just wanted to be me
13666820	13668020	Uh
13668020	13671060	And so I'm like, yeah fucking let loose like I feel like I
13671780	13674580	I've I've told my friends are like, oh, how do you like being a vealer?
13674580	13677700	I'm like, I feel like I'm an indie but I get all the fucking support of an agency
13678820	13680820	Like I can do what I want
13681780	13686900	And I'm I kid I am perfect like I can be professional. I'm not gonna fucking flash my titties but

14312980	14317620	Uh, thank you so much for the bunny garden stream. Your dub was absolutely hilarious
14317940	14319940	I really gotta pee
14321700	14325220	You've definitely become the top viewer girl. I want to heavily support monetarily
14326180	14328180	Seriously, she's done a great job
14328340	14331060	Uh, strontis seriously done a great job picking you all
14331700	14335780	Now I'm curious if you have any plans to dub future visual novels or h games like honey pop
14336260	14337540	Again, thanks for the wonderful stream
14337540	14341780	And I'll be hoping and praying that you land a va role in an anime or video game. Thank you

14345300	14346740	um
14347620	14349620	Def I will probably
14349700	14353620	Maybe do a dub of like doki doki literature club probably. I think that'd be fun
14354260	14357540	um, I don't know if I'll be able to get to the full game, but
14358260	14363380	Maybe I'm like again, I lose interest and stuff very easily and I've already played and beat the game before so
14364100	14365940	um
14365940	14369220	But like it is one of my favorite games. So I probably would enjoy replaying it
14369220	14374740	I haven't played it in a very long time. Um, I'm kind of pissed that the developer didn't make a second one
14374740	14376740	Like he's fucking said he was going to
14377460	14382660	Because he was like almost doing like an ARG for something that was related to like what Yuri was
14383220	14385620	Reading in her fantasy books and then he just never fucking did it
14386340	14388660	Or am I tripping and that did happen. I just didn't hear about it
14390580	14395380	Oh, who'd you voice act for doki doki doki? No, I like I I dub all the characters
14396500	14401700	my uh, uh, you need to go and watch my um, bunny garden, uh
14402340	14407620	Playthrough you can uh, just go into that skip ahead because I yap a little bit
14409540	14411540	Trauma dumping is extra
14412580	14414580	um
14415300	14420740	I appreciate that you want to support me monetarily above everybody else, but please spread that wealth to the other girls
14421220	14423220	um
14423620	14429060	Yeah, I don't know. That's all I can really say about that. Uh, I'm really glad a lot of you seem to really enjoy the
14429700	14435140	The bunny garden dub and it was actually so fun to do. I haven't had that fun much fun in the stream
14435700	14437380	Uh, in a very long time
14437380	14439380	It was very enjoyable
14441700	14443780	Uh, can't open that
14445460	14448260	Hello, she be you mentioned having your nippies pierced on stream
14448260	14452420	I was wondering do you have any piercings if so where also will be receiving to open
14453220	14455940	Open to receiving some jewelry for them on throne
14456660	14459700	Um, again, feel free not to answer. Let me met him. Uh
14460740	14462740	My ears. I don't know. Yeah, my ears
14464660	14470500	No, I would probably not put jewelry on my throne for that because I'm very particular
14471300	14474100	Well, what I put on and in my body technically
14475140	14477060	Um, because some of that stuff can be
14478980	14482420	Can cause like an allergic reaction or my body can reject the jewelry
14482820	14486100	Um, it is not fun when that happens. I have had
14486660	14490020	Uh, one of my, uh, nippy piercings reject jewelry
14490900	14495060	And I want it to fucking die. So no, thanks. Uh, I appreciate the thought though
14496180	14499860	Uh, yeah, I hurt like a motherfucker. Um
14500900	14503860	If you ever get a piercing let's go for any piercing by the way
14504180	14508740	Um, and you're starting to reject it swap the jewelry out immediately clean it
14509460	14511460	Uh, do surgical grade
14511940	14514900	Uh, I also because my, um
14516900	14518660	Maybe started to keloid
14518660	14521460	But like you have to be more susceptible to keloids and genetically
14522180	14525780	Being brown. I am more susceptible to keloids. I just put a little green tea not green tea
14526340	14530100	Tea tree oil on it went away real quick. So if you guys have are considering that
14531780	14534100	Please, uh, go to a piercer
14534980	14537300	Do not do what I fucking did and just go to a mall
14538740	14540740	I got my tits pierced at Claire's
14542420	14547540	Uh, your body like reject. Yes. Yeah, uh, just like a normal ear piercing some people
14548020	14556260	Uh, their body rejects the metal or they have a allergic reaction to it. Um, another thing with, uh, nippy piercings is that they never truly heal
14557940	14559940	The holes cannot close
14560180	14561620	close
14561620	14564100	They never actually truly heal. Um
14565460	14567460	I have had mine for
14568340	14570340	Four years now
14571700	14573620	um
14573620	14578660	They like there is a certain point where they feel they are like considered like healed and that's usually after a year
14579940	14584740	So it's like gauges. No my fucking nipped. It's a normal barbell. What the fuck?
14585780	14589380	I would not gauge that. Holy shit. Did you actually do it at Claire's? No
14590100	14595060	It was it was like some like body jewelry place. It was like a fucking it was like the equivalent of like spencer's
14595060	14597060	What they had like a piercer there
14598260	14604660	No, I don't have any gauges. I don't know. My mom would bully the fuck out of me if I had gauges
14605620	14611460	My little ear. I have cute little ear lobes. I have cute little lobes. My ears were pierced when I was a baby my ear my um
14612340	14613380	me
14613380	14618020	My and my holes have never closed because of that for some reason. So like I haven't worn earrings in a really long time
14618740	14620740	um

14624020	14626020	Walmart piercings

15239860	15242180	Uh, I still have a bush anyways moving on
15242740	15246900	Uh, just wondering how do you feel about AI gend images of sheebie?
15247220	15248660	I know it is an art, etc
15248660	15253460	And it wouldn't drop it in your tags probably just I don't know what that word is if anywhere
15253940	15257940	Uh, if you put some time into learning how to use it these days, you can output some nice looking stuff
15257940	15261620	This is the usual slop it require creating a trained model of your image though
15261620	15264020	Which I want to do without your thumbs up or just I don't care how well
15264580	15268180	Thanks for streams regardless. Uh, please do not make AI art of me
15269940	15272660	Using my model, please do not feed my model
15273860	15275060	uh
15275060	15278500	Into any sort of AI thing if you're like
15279140	15284500	Just like generating stuff and one just happens to look like me. That's fine. But please do not
15285620	15287620	Take my model
15288420	15290420	Do that like I
15291380	15294900	Am an artist. I also just I don't like it just doesn't look good
15296260	15299780	Like what is what is that? Uh, there was like a meme. I think it was like a flork meme like
15300580	15302580	uh these like
15303540	15310500	This the sex uh post don't mean anything nor anymore. There's no like life behind them. There's not enough horny or whatever the fuck
15311780	15315300	Um, yeah, they look weird the art style isn't consistent
15315780	15318500	Um, I'm not a huge fan as someone who's an artist
15319540	15322660	I'm not a good one, but I'll say I'm an artist. Uh, I would hate that
15323300	15326100	Uh, I'd rather you draw a shitty picture of me
15327220	15329860	Yourself, that's it. Um
15330820	15332820	Again, I can't
15332820	15335460	Really police that it's really just like a trust thing
15336260	15337540	Um
15337540	15339540	If you do it and I see it
15340020	15342020	I'm just probably not going to acknowledge it
15342660	15344660	Sorry
15345620	15347620	Yeah
15353780	15359780	I just busted a fat fucking note on the final image of your twitter game. What are you gonna do about it? Nothing
15361940	15363940	I don't care
15364260	15366260	Some of you have that you talk to me
15366900	15371940	Like you're trying to tease me. You're like, oh, what are you gonna do about it? No, I don't like brats
15372020	15381700	I'm not I don't like brats. Just behave be a good boy. Sit down bust them out and enjoy yourself. Jesus Christ
15386660	15389940	These white boys be tripping walk away
15393620	15397620	Is it considered criminal if it's taking three different art styles and blending them together to make a new style
15398180	15401220	Yeah, because it's still not original. That's not
15403780	15405380	It's not
15405380	15408980	that a whole I'm not gonna like go through a whole AI art debate
15410340	15412340	because
15413620	15415620	Like I just said like
15415780	15417780	I'm not a huge fan
15418260	15420260	in like when I first was um
15420980	15422980	My twitter using my twitter
15423300	15426740	I liked like a lot of AI art
15427300	15434180	Because I didn't know it was AI and then I go in and I'm like wow the person might have worked must have worked super fucking hard on this
15435220	15436260	Wow
15436260	15441060	And I looked in their point their fucking profile and they're like generated using blah blah blah and I'm like oh the fuck
15441060	15444660	And I went on an unlike shit and then my whole like I kept getting tricked
15445060	15447860	I still get tricked and I'm like dude. Just give me good artists
15448980	15451540	Just give me good artists and I'd like actual real artists, please
15452500	15456660	Oh, but I worked so hard already this prompt this prompt. That's how do you think about you?
15456660	15459860	I'm just burping while you're talking because I don't care. Um cool
15460820	15462820	Or whatever. I guess
15463220	15465220	Wow
15465220	15467220	gosh
15468020	15475300	Yeah, it's because a lot of the AI art has a distinctive style because there's like one person they mostly fed the algorithm on
15476260	15479060	um, I forget what the artist's name is I remember, um
15480020	15482340	Reading it the other day. He's like a famous comic artist
15485540	15488180	Remember an AI broke out ratioed by one piece to animator
15488980	15493060	I remember when like crony called out and a not even she didn't even call somebody out
15493060	15497780	She's just like, I don't like this. Can you put this someplace else and they're just like this is an AI and it's like freaked out
15502580	15504580	Um
15505380	15509300	They put why must you hurt me by shaving twice in one hour relax
15510500	15513860	Relax, I got it the first time you don't have to send it to me twice
15515540	15518420	Unless you think you made a mistake then I guess I can't really blame you for that
15520740	15524260	She just said you oh, yeah, that's what it was. Sorry. I don't really pay attention that much
15524740	15529540	Wait, you're half black. How can that dumpy not clap? Did your white half funnel it all to your chest?
15529940	15536580	What a travesty she we should have the back bedonk-a-donk that is her god's given right and then her back which suffer less too
15537060	15544660	That's not how it works. Also. She could have suffocated the entire harem under her bodacious cheeks such an injustice. Um
15546340	15548340	I still have a fat ass
15549620	15553780	Wait, I did I literally just tried to move my model as if I'm gonna turn around
15554180	15556660	But uh, you can just pretend by my hips
15557620	15559620	And how my thighs are
15559860	15565860	But yes, it's big. Oh by the way, um when I was messing around with trans making my stuff transparent
15567540	15569140	Uh
15569140	15571140	I got to see my butt fangs
15571700	15573700	I didn't know I had any
15575140	15577140	And I was like, oh
15577860	15579540	They were whoo
15579540	15581380	They were fangin
15581380	15583380	They were banging and fangin
15583620	15586420	Um, so yeah, you don't have to worry about that
15589140	15591140	My nose is itchy
15591700	15593460	um
15593460	15596740	It's funny because my dad's side all of big butts
15597780	15599780	And my mom has a big butt
15601460	15603940	But I just don't I guess
15605700	15607700	I've been told I have
15607700	15610980	A big butt, but I just don't believe people so I could be wrong, you know
15611860	15613860	I could be wrong
15614340	15616340	Because I just look at strawberries. I'm like, I don't have that
15618980	15621140	Me with my flat ass, yeah, but you're a man, so you're fine
15626340	15627620	Hello, madame
15627620	15630740	Would you be so kind as to bless us with your thigh peak once again?
15631220	15635300	I thought I had saved the day you blessed us, but apparently I'd not I checked your twitter
15635300	15639780	I'm not to rectify my grievous mistake, but sadly you had already deleted as much to my dismay
15641540	15643940	No, I'm not going to you can just wait for the thigh cam
15645060	15649140	I was tired of people being like damn you have the goosebumps and I'm like
15650340	15652340	Haven't shaved
15652340	15654340	I didn't shave my legs for like three days
15654660	15659860	Um, and by the way a lot of girls legs look like that even when they do shave
15661300	15663220	Uh, they just apply a lot of filters to their shit
15664740	15667620	I believe anything you see posted on the internet. Um
15668020	15674900	Anyways, you fast become my oshi. I love the energy you bring and I'm glad you let your true self try
15675700	15681620	True self shine through. I've been an enjoyer vtuber since COVID lockdown days. I never truly had an oshi
15682420	15687860	And I'm glad to call you my oshi. May you you and all the rest of you will be blessed with success and happiness
15691780	15693780	That was so nice
15695140	15697140	That was so nice
15698180	15700580	Wow, the fact that you think
15701860	15706820	I am your oshi and you haven't been able to find one and then you see me and I've only been here for like a week
15706980	15710260	And uh, that means a lot to me. You don't yeah that just
15711300	15713300	I just like it's hard for me to like
15715380	15717620	Like why the fuck maybe we like me like it's
15718260	15722340	That's just but that's that's everybody everybody has a little side of themselves are like, yeah, but why like how
15722340	15725380	Why could you like me like how could you because it's so hard
15726020	15733460	to like sometimes accept compliments and reflect on yourself and be like, oh, I do have good qualities and um
15734180	15736020	Like I definitely love myself
15736020	15740900	But I and like I practice self-love, but I just a lot of stuff. I feel like I don't deserve
15741460	15746180	Yes, imposter syndrome. Um, and that's what happens. Like I was very small when I was rena
15746980	15749860	Uh, I probably I at most had like a 50
15750740	15751700	Uh
15751700	15753700	ccb like current viewership
15753780	15754820	um
15754820	15757700	I only had like a couple regulars in my chat. I mostly had lurkers
15758420	15759620	um
15759620	15763380	So when I go from that to the sort of audience I have now
15763780	15768100	Lots of eyes on me lots of support lots of the it's just it's very overwhelming
15768580	15771540	That goes for all the girls. I know mercy is dealing with the same thing right now
15772180	15774180	It's like we all can't handle
15774180	15776420	being liked as much as we are because like
15777620	15779620	We expected so much more hate
15780580	15784340	We were fucking mentally prepared to get absolutely shit on by the community
15785140	15791540	But it didn't happen. We are okay. And that might be actually due to because we didn't get any sort of coverage from like the drama channels
15792260	15793860	um
15793860	15795860	because
15796420	15798020	like
15798020	15800020	like after we like I um
15800900	15802900	A lot of people admitted
15803700	15807140	That they're like, oh, I thought you were going to crash and burn
15807620	15810020	Or this was gonna happen or that was gonna happen
15810580	15812580	um, and then they watch us
15812580	15815780	And they're like I was actually wrong and I love you
15817140	15821780	And I'm like, please just like give people a chance. Yeah, you look at a small agency starting up
15822020	15826660	They can surprise you like you may plus surprise me. They have wonderful talented girls
15827700	15831540	Um when they first showed up, I remember I was gonna apply to them when they first
15831940	15836340	Opened auditions, but I it was too busy with my real job. So I didn't get around to it. Um
15837620	15839620	I could have ended up there, you know
15840420	15842420	It ended up in the other places I applied to
15843300	15845300	um
15845620	15850260	Just yeah, and that's okay. You can totally admit like I was one of those people. I was like a naysayer
15851540	15852580	because
15852580	15859700	You assume the it's not an unusual thing for people to assume the worst so they avoid being disappointed
15860980	15862980	But I'm happy
15863060	15866340	That we were able to surprise and delight everybody with how
15867380	15869140	Wonderful we all are
15869140	15872420	Collectively and we all have different niches and different styles and different
15873380	15875380	Ways about how we um go about things
15877380	15879380	Um
15881140	15883140	So, yeah
15883460	15890180	Thank god the worst case scenario didn't happen everybody's like, oh, I remember my favorite comment my favorite negative comment that I saw was
15891540	15893540	How long is it gonna take
15893540	15899860	For one of them for it to come out that one of them is a sexual predator and I'm like Jesus fucking christ
15901620	15903620	Are you serious?
15904740	15908820	There are so many loutubers in the vtuber community and you be you just assume
15910340	15912660	That we're gonna be sexual predator like what?
15915700	15922020	I was like that was just like out of malice or something like do you you just you don't want us to succeed and that's why you said that
15922980	15924980	like
15924980	15928180	That like blew me away generally and this is before I even gotten to be alert
15928180	15932740	like even just like being a normal viewer and being excited for the girls like I had like the
15933860	15935860	Auditions hadn't even opened yet type thing
15936980	15941380	They're like it's gonna be so funny when one of them gets out as a sexual predator or this i'm like
15942020	15944020	what the hell
15944180	15947220	There's so many different loutubers that are normal people like melody
15948100	15953380	Partic melody is a lovely person. She's so sweet her normal streams are adorable
15957140	15959620	And then you know you realize people just love to hate
15962740	15964740	What they don't know
15964740	15967540	We're on a stand yet because we are the first of our kind
15968180	15970180	being a lewd focused
15970420	15972420	YouTubeing agency
15972500	15974500	Normally that isn't the standard
15974500	15978340	So I can't blame some of you who are who are just like, uh, I don't really think this will work
15979380	15980260	um
15980260	15986660	But I will explain the people that are like they're probably horrible human beings like that was I just thought that was a totally
15988660	15991060	Terrible thing to say about people you didn't even know yet
15992020	15994900	And again, I wasn't even a talent yet. This was like way back when
15995460	15997460	dealer was announced
15998180	16000180	I was like damn I feel bad for those girls
16000740	16006740	When they get picked wow I'm here. Um, yeah reflects more on the speaker. I'm like, what are you saying? What have you done?
16007220	16009220	Hmm. Hmm
16009220	16011220	um
16011700	16014260	Melody collapse someday that'll be great. I hope so
16015540	16017540	I would love to learn from her
16018100	16020100	Um, I feel like she could teach us a lot
16021460	16026340	Her loves to hate and find any reason to do so. Have you seen any of the joked drama? I was like, I don't even know who that is
16027140	16029140	What's that? Who is that?
16030580	16033620	I think a lot of people just want to watch dramas again. That's true. People love drama
16034260	16035380	um
16035380	16038180	That sort of stuff pulls eyes gets views
16038820	16044900	um, I know that false only really covered us because there was a lot more vocal
16046180	16048180	angle to like
16049700	16052820	Actually, it was I feel like it was kind of even on both sides in terms of like
16053540	16055540	who was
16055540	16059540	Not for it and who was and even like, um kaiyo
16060260	16063380	And he's was more like a little bit unbiased when he covered the
16064020	16065140	um
16065140	16067220	The announcement of velour again. This was me
16067940	16071540	Observing this when I wasn't even a talent when they first announced auditions
16072180	16074180	Um, or not. They first announced the company
16075060	16077060	before they announced auditions, um
16078740	16082500	He was just like they both I noticed they both started off with the
16083620	16088740	A good amount of negative comments that were said about us and like responding to the tweet of them going
16089300	16090740	Going live
16090740	16092740	um, and then they followed up in the
16093780	16098660	There's their cover their cover story of like one or two or three nice things
16100020	16102020	And I was like
16102980	16108260	And then all the like the comments that were boosted were the more negative ones like yeah, I don't really see this working out
16108660	16111140	They're probably gonna burn out or they're probably not gonna want to do it
16111220	16113300	Or they're probably gonna do this and probably gonna do that
16113860	16115860	Or he just can wait and see what happens
16119220	16123780	Um, everyone's going through their own battle attack them now. They're fighting two battles. Boom. Yeah
16125140	16127380	Did you decide you I was the first person who applied?
16129220	16132100	Starny said I applied 20 minutes after stuff opened
16133140	16135780	Uh, I was the first person to apply
16137940	16139940	To be there
16140180	16145700	That is because I recorded my video three days in advance because I was so anxious. I'm getting it perfectly
16146020	16148020	I worked really hard on it
16149620	16151620	I
16152260	16154260	Yeah, that's the uh
16154900	16156900	I was ready. I wanted this for since
16158020	16160020	a certain rtx
16160100	16162100	strongy mentioned doing it again
16162980	16166660	Making her own company. I'm like, I'm in I want that. I didn't think I would get in
16168260	16170980	I was so ready to be disappointed. You have no idea
16172020	16173300	but
16173300	16175300	Yeah, I'm here
16175300	16176900	And I'm so happy I am

16221860	16223860	the bigger vtubers in the community

16227540	16228660	like
16228660	16230660	We're just starting out
16230660	16233860	A bunch of us were very small before we were in a v in velar
16234740	16236740	And didn't even dream of being in a corpo

16242100	16243620	and
16243620	16248100	But mind you I've still worked very hard to be here. Don't get it twisted. Um
16248980	16251940	If I can grind it out for a very long time
16254260	16258500	I heard a velar when I first announced I forgot about it. I only remembered that they have to be a lot of people were like that
16258500	16260500	Was funny, uh
16261060	16263060	Lost face to grow. Yeah

16285940	16290340	Of being completely on say so and doing crazier stuff than

16303940	16307540	We just say the we I always make the joke we just say the quiet part out loud
16308180	16309860	we're like
16309860	16314020	Because like a lot of a lot of fucking girls and agencies are like us. They just
16314740	16316740	They're just not allowed to do what we do
16317140	16319540	They would probably make the content if they um wanted to
16320100	16323780	Um, and if they were allowed to by their by their uh companies
16328180	16332740	Never heard of you learn till debut personally. Yeah, and that's fine. Like I'm it's glad you're here
16333460	16337060	Glad you're here. If you just just caught us on debut if you knew from the beginning
16337780	16340980	Um, if you followed strontae before she was strontae then
16341700	16343700	Yeah, just
16343700	16345700	You can't you were here for a reason
16346180	16348180	You're here for a reason
16348500	16353140	I almost said a reef link. You're here for a reason rafling. Um
16354660	16356660	But yeah
16356740	16360820	You can't say I've gone sph for mothers, but you'd be surprised
16360820	16367300	They're you'd be surprised because they again they dress it up as other things
16368180	16373620	They they tease you with uh, but they just use different words, but it's the intention
16374340	16376340	Is that
16377060	16381940	Um, but some people now you can just enjoy being you know, the bluntness of just being like, yeah
16382020	16387460	I want you to boop out of my beep and made it with a beep on boo with a boop like all that shit. Um
16388740	16390740	Yeah
16391780	16394340	I apologize for being too needy and chat madam
16395060	16397300	You scolding us and ording around honestly
16398660	16402580	Can't read that part. Uh, let me she be also you're not a whore you're a madam
16404980	16406980	That's funny. Um
16410580	16415540	These are just really so exciting at 10 times. Um, I don't really think you guys are needy
16416500	16420740	You want I think you got we like some of you complain a lot
16422020	16426900	But lately since I've like I said something the other day everybody's kind of shut up. I noticed
16427780	16429780	Which is finally nice
16433060	16435060	So I guess I will just be more
16436180	16442340	Straightforward because normally again, I'm a very nice person. I don't like being mean. Um
16442980	16444980	And so sometimes
16445940	16447940	I don't want people to think
16448100	16450100	That I like genuinely hate them
16450740	16452740	Because to be honest with you
16455220	16460020	I just don't have the energy to hate people on the internet that just say a mean thing about me
16460420	16462420	When I'm just being an anime girl. So like
16464900	16466900	Um, yeah
16469380	16471380	When I was
16472100	16474100	Also, you're not a whore you're a madam
16474740	16479220	Uh, while I was thinking of she be uh, your name warped in my thought to
16480900	16485780	Shibizi which is very rude. BZ is not a good word for women and I don't think we use BZ. What does that mean?
16486740	16488740	Should I not say that out loud?
16489620	16491620	Did I fucking just say something inappropriate?
16501620	16503620	It
16509220	16511460	Means bitch formally used for women
16512820	16518260	Oh, it means it's a slang term that means someone who is okay. It's like a bitch. Okay
16519300	16521300	Okay, cool
16521940	16526340	We're not getting cancelled. We're fine. It's just it was just used to be slang for like just essentially just like
16526900	16533220	A colloquial off word slang for a woman boomie. Hi, mr. Titties. Can you get your asshole out of my face?
16533300	16537540	You're gonna clean your ass boy. Oh, you are so heavy. Hello, handsome
16538420	16540420	What's up? You just want attention?
16541460	16543460	You just want attention?
16544660	16546660	Do you guys already all eat your all your food?
16548180	16550900	I need to refit refill your um feeders
16551940	16554660	You put you down. Oh my god. You're so heavy. I think he's like
16555140	16557140	15 pounds now. He's such a big cat
16558580	16560580	It's all fucking muscles
16572340	16574340	Like in my castle tree
16574340	16576340	What's this
16583140	16585140	Oh, what's this? You want chicken?
16585540	16587540	Oh, you want chicken?
16588180	16590180	Want chicken?
16594740	16596740	And you do the move
16599460	16601460	That's the fucking game wire
16604740	16606740	No
16629940	16633780	Are you guys, like it like a baby girl
16634340	16649340	Guys, I can't put it on your plate if your faces are in the film, I'm good.
16649340	16650340	Back up.
16650340	16651340	Back up.
16651340	16661340	Here, relax, relax.
16661340	16664340	Come on.
16664340	16671340	Right now! Right now! Right now! Right now, where'd you go? Right now!
16671340	16676340	Oh, right there. Right, here you go, Mom. Shhh! I don't need to.
16678340	16682340	Here, come up. Do you know how to get down? You'll get confused.
16682340	16686340	Like, I jumped up here, but I don't know where to go.
16688340	16689340	Fuck...
16695340	16702340	Okay, give him some wet food as a little treat.
16705340	16710340	No, I know you guys can hear me. It's not like... I don't care if you can hear me.
16710340	16714340	My informant's fucking small. I only mute for pee.
16716340	16719340	I cover all intensely. Let's make sure I talk to our cats.
16725340	16727340	What am I reading?
16735340	16737340	Bad mute? I didn't mute.
16741340	16745340	Distant she be my blood. A flavor of wet food, I give him chicken.
16745340	16751340	Oh, is it like those small shorts about little Jimmy who moved bricks for a year and only got an apartment for two square? What?
16752340	16756340	I love the stuck in the closet in your house, roughly.
16756340	16759340	Mute for pee, bad mute. Oh, I see.
16760340	16764340	And once they dried cat food as a kid, that explains a lot.
16766340	16771340	It's not like... My house is like pretty normal size, to be honest.
16771340	16775340	Like, it's actually bigger than my childhood home, but my childhood home was really small.
16775340	16780340	I just have an open concept in my apartment, so that's why it's echoey when you can like...
16781340	16784340	Yeah, when I walk away, because they're like, ah!
16784340	16787340	Sorry, I don't mean to blow out your fucking eardrums.
16787340	16794340	So like, I have my living room area on one half of the room, then I have my kitchen area on one half of the room,
16794340	16798340	and then I have my bedroom, and then I have a bathroom, and then I have a giant walking closet,
16798340	16802340	because it honestly doubles as a bedroom if I want it.
16802340	16805340	Like, I literally probably put it at like a little like sleeping bag down.
16805340	16807340	Guys can sleep over, we can have a little sleep over.
16807340	16809340	We are in the walls.
16812340	16818340	It screws apart from on, where the cage goes.
16818340	16823340	Yeah, the cage is um... Actually, the cage is in the living room right next to the TV,
16823340	16830340	so you can have some sun, um, because like, I have a balcony as well.
16830340	16832340	I need to get furniture for my balcony.
16832340	16836340	I've lived here for almost like two years, and I still don't have fucking balcony furniture,
16836340	16839340	and like, I go outside and I just stand there awkwardly.
16840340	16842340	Oh, I got a fart.
16845340	16847340	Nice.
16847340	16849340	Um, hammock for the butt.
16849340	16851340	No, it's not big enough for that.
16851340	16856340	I'd probably get like one of those cute little like, suspended egg chair things,
16856340	16860340	or like something I could put my feet up on, just curl up with a book and a blankie.
16862340	16866340	I told you, you only get one tooth for free on stream.
16866340	16868340	Can you find it? I don't know if you can.
16868340	16870340	It's been there.
16870340	16872340	Happened in another stream, not this video.
16874340	16881340	Uh, anyways, um, the rest of this message makes absolutely no sense.
16886340	16892340	Actually, it makes sense, but like, this person was rambling and it's kind of funny.
16892340	16897340	They're just like talking about like, the entomology of the word, BZ,
16899340	16902340	and like, references and pop culture of the word.
16905340	16906340	That's kind of funny.
16908340	16910340	This is sorry at the end.
16910340	16911340	Probably baked.
16911340	16912340	Honestly, sounds like it.
16913340	16918340	Shibi, you know what would be really silly?
16918340	16929340	You should put Ona on throne and pretend to tie us and use it on us while degrading us for ASMR or a joy for Patreon.
16929340	16931340	Would that be silly and funny?
16931340	16932340	And ha ha.
16932340	16934340	Anyway, love you, you goofy bitch.
16934340	16935340	Enduring.
16935340	16939340	Um, I don't.
16940340	16945340	You want me to buy an Ona and use it on what?
16947340	16948340	One of my doze?
16950340	16951340	One of my doze of dild?
16951340	16957340	Like, I don't, I'd be like, oh, like, I'm gonna look so weird.
16961340	16962340	Oh, damn you.
16962340	16963340	Damn you.
16964340	16970340	Um, the maintenance man is gonna come in for me.
16970340	16972340	I ran into him again, by the way.
16972340	16976340	I ran into one of the guys, the one of the maintenance men that came in.
16976340	16977340	One of them fucking hates me.
16977340	16979340	The other one was nice.
16980340	16986340	And he held the door opened for me when I was bringing in a giant with a giant ass packages.
16986340	16988340	You guys got me from throne.
16989340	16992340	I'm like, I'm carrying all my horror merchandise.
16996340	16998340	What do you think you do again?
16998340	17004340	No, for those of you who don't know, my maintenance men came to change my air filter.
17004340	17005340	And oh, hi, Raina.
17005340	17007340	Did you enjoy your chicken?
17007340	17008340	She just like flopped into my arms.
17008340	17009340	How cute.
17011340	17012340	Oh, are you going in the bed?
17012340	17013340	Okay, there you go.
17014340	17017340	Um, they knocked on the door.
17017340	17018340	I had my headphones on.
17018340	17019340	I didn't hear them.
17019340	17020340	So I didn't answer.
17020340	17021340	They let themselves in thinking it wasn't home.
17021340	17022340	They realized I was there.
17022340	17024340	They're like, oh, hey, we're just here to show the filter.
17024340	17028340	And I'm like, okay, weird that they didn't like set a notice ahead saying that they're
17028340	17030340	going to do that sort of stuff.
17030340	17038340	I realized after they left, I had left toys everywhere in a door hanger thing that says
17038340	17040340	do not disturb, but masturbate.
17043340	17048340	And then one of them told on me for having cats.
17050340	17051340	They have an extra cat.
17051340	17052340	I have a bonus cat.
17053340	17056340	I think it was a dude that always looks at me to discuss when he sees me.
17056340	17060340	The other guy just like looks at me sheepishly like he doesn't know what to do with himself.
17061340	17069340	Um, they're new because like we, I, I'm like, they go through maintenance men so much because
17069340	17074340	there was another guy that came in like a month ago to fix my, because I have a trash.
17074340	17075340	What is it called?
17075340	17077340	Uh, trash disposal.
17077340	17082340	And it wasn't working because it wasn't like there was like some, apparently I thought
17082340	17085340	something came on screwed, but there was apparently just like something in there that got stuck.
17085340	17088340	Um, and it was like this totally different guy.
17088340	17089340	And then there's other guys.
17089340	17090340	Okay.
17090340	17091340	I'm like, I've never seen you before.
17091340	17092340	Who are you?
17092340	17095340	And that's why I was like, I initially freaked out cause I'm like, I've never, these, you
17095340	17096340	are not the normal maintenance man.
17096340	17097340	The fuck?
17099340	17101340	There was somebody before that and I haven't seen them.
17102340	17104340	I'm like, they're killing the maintenance men.
17104340	17106340	They're just like, you didn't do a good job.
17106340	17107340	Death.
17108340	17113340	They're just replacing them like, like, uh, cast members and they're hoping that you don't
17113340	17114340	even notice.
17117340	17119340	Um, but yeah, what?
17122340	17126340	I thought like half just growling, but something was just like, there's like, sometimes a,
17126340	17130340	my bathroom fan like vibrates a certain way and it's freaked me out.
17130340	17134340	Um, man, I hate when rental staff don't give the heads up.
17134340	17136340	Oh, at least an apartment that way.
17136340	17137340	Yeah.
17137340	17139340	That's why I'm like, I feel like legally and where I'm from, they're not allowed to do
17139340	17140340	that.
17140340	17141340	They have to give 24 hour notice.
17141340	17147340	So I was going to bring that up when I went to the landlord and I was like, Hey, you guys
17147340	17150340	technically came in when you weren't supposed to get a heads up.
17150340	17151340	I was from the spot.
17151340	17154340	That's why I said you could come in and it ended up being like, I, but I didn't even
17154340	17156340	have to use that because the lady was chill anyways.
17156340	17159340	It was just the other bitch property manager that was being annoying.
17159340	17160340	I was like, Oh, you're, you're fine.
17160340	17161340	You're a good tenant.
17161340	17162340	And I'm like, thank you.
17162340	17163340	Thank you so much.
17167340	17168340	Yeah.
17168340	17169340	I got you for maintenance, man.
17175340	17178340	As a person who mainly came for the Fendham vibes, I was shocked that I got a female bro
17178340	17179340	along for the ride.
17179340	17181340	Oh, bro.
17182340	17186340	Looking forward to your future endeavors and hopefully you get more of those awesome
17186340	17187340	dubs of yours.
17187340	17193340	Yes, you are more dubs coming soon, coming right at you like right in your face, coming
17193340	17194340	in your face.
17194340	17196340	Don't you, don't you worry about it.
17197340	17202340	Um, yeah, you're my bros.
17202340	17205340	We're bros and sometimes make out.
17205340	17208340	Sometimes, you know, some of you, my boyfriend, girlfriend, if you're into that, you know,
17208340	17211340	boyfriend, girlfriend, Ryan Gosling voice, boyfriend, girlfriend.
17215340	17218340	Don't, you know, let me get to your head.
17219340	17220340	Okay.
17220340	17223340	Some of you are dogs and I'm your owner.
17223340	17226340	You can decide what you want us to be.
17226340	17228340	I will give you that one freedom.
17228340	17229340	Okay.
17229340	17233340	This got that GF bro.
17233340	17241340	Yeah, I can be your bro, Brogif, your bro GF Brogif, you know, but I'm glad that like
17241340	17247340	I, I'm happy that I pleasantly surprised people because people are like, oh, she's going to
17247340	17251340	be like this really reserved Dom and be like this and like that and just be like really
17251340	17253340	like, really like maybe like coup d'etre.
17253340	17261340	Um, I thought about being that and I'm like, you know, I'm going to be my authentic.
17261340	17264340	Nah, I'm going to do me.
17264340	17266340	Um, I want to be my authentic self.
17266340	17276340	I don't like lying and then it probably would fade away after a month or two anyways.
17278340	17279340	Authentic self, best self.
17279340	17280340	Yeah.
17280340	17283340	So even though the other girls struggle with that, be like, oh, should I act a certain
17283340	17284340	way?
17284340	17286340	And then in the end, like strong, he just really nailed.
17286340	17289340	She's like, I hired you for you.
17289340	17295340	I didn't hire you because like of this, this or that you could do this voice or do that
17295340	17296340	or do that.
17296340	17302340	Like I hired you for your personality and I was like, takes mom wipes away tears.
17302340	17305340	Um, you can be my ex.
17305340	17307340	I got everything in the divorce.
17307340	17308340	Sorry.
17308340	17309340	Shut it in a prenup.
17309340	17322340	Um, if you were to hypothetically allow us to send proof of us following instructions,
17322340	17325340	what would that be?
17325340	17328340	If the answer to above is I might be going too far.
17328340	17331340	Could we chat, get a bonk instead?
17332340	17339340	Uh, most of you have already done so.
17339340	17342340	So I'm like, I guess I'm fine with it.
17342340	17343340	I don't know.
17343340	17345340	Um, yeah, I don't.
17345340	17347340	I don't know.
17347340	17349340	I bonk chat anyways.
17349340	17351340	We're bonking right now.
17351340	17352340	Okay.
17352340	17353340	Sorry.
17353340	17356340	Let me refresh this.
17357340	17361340	Oh, now I have to go through and physically answer these.
17361340	17363340	Eventually, maybe I won't.
17363340	17365340	I might be a little bit too lazy for that.
17365340	17372340	Um, I need to scratch my booty.
17372340	17374340	My booty cheeky.
17374340	17379340	Um, outside of a stream chat and especially on other social media platforms, what would
17379340	17384340	you say their dues and don'ts when coming to talking comes to talking interacting with
17384340	17385340	you?
17385340	17389340	Uh, you guys have interacted me with me pretty normally.
17389340	17395340	I can't really think of anything that sticks out besides the people that have complained
17395340	17398340	about like the doming on like not being a dom enough.
17398340	17401340	But I've already addressed that, uh, going forward from the stream.
17401340	17402340	I'm not going to address it anymore.
17402340	17406340	You're just going to get blocked and ignored because, uh, madam shouldn't have to repeat
17406340	17410340	herself, especially to dumbasses who complain like that.
17410340	17414340	Um, into the other girls too, by the way, if you complain about them.
17415340	17416340	Oh, I see.
17416340	17417340	Isn't this enough?
17417340	17418340	Amy isn't this enough?
17418340	17419340	Mercy isn't this enough?
17419340	17420340	Azura isn't this enough?
17420340	17421340	Strawny isn't this enough?
17421340	17424340	I'm just literally going to ignore you.
17424340	17429980	Just like there's so many other girls, uh, in different agencies and Indies that will
17429980	17432340	probably be better up your alley then.
17432340	17435980	Um, I'm not a pushover.
17435980	17438340	I'm not going to bend to your will.
17438340	17440140	Uh, I am in control here.
17440140	17442340	Do not forget that.
17443340	17453340	Uh, I think I'm trying to think of, uh, probably maybe the people that like role play being
17454340	17463340	Dom with me, like that's kind of, it's not even like, oh, you're trying to like
17464340	17469340	Dom me because I'm a dom or like fighting for, you know, being the alpha or whatever
17469340	17470340	the fuck.
17470340	17473340	It just comes off so fucking cringy.
17473340	17479340	Like, like somebody sent me something like, oh, what if I were to come in and tie you
17479340	17483340	to the bed and use you the way that I want to, and then you don't have, you don't get
17483340	17486340	to say anything and I get to be used, use free use.
17486340	17490340	I'm like, I just didn't respond.
17490340	17492340	I just blocked him as the next person.
17492340	17498340	I'm like, I wouldn't do anything, uh, because that wouldn't happen.
17500340	17502340	I would call the police.
17505340	17510340	Uh, like, yeah, they're trying to find the switch button, but it's like, it's not, you're
17510340	17511340	not going to get that.
17511340	17518340	Like the, you're not like, I am a Dom first and foremost.
17518340	17523340	My audios might reflect differently because the scripts I have to fill on stream.
17523340	17525340	I'm your mother.
17525340	17528340	You do well to behave.
17528340	17529340	All right.
17529340	17531340	Uh, I'm your madam.
17531340	17532340	I'm your mother.
17532340	17534340	I'm your owner.
17534340	17536340	I wear the pants in the relationship.
17536340	17538340	You do not.
17538340	17541340	Uh, I might be sweet.
17541340	17548340	I might be nice to you because I'm a human being and Dom's aren't dicks all the time,
17548340	17549340	by the way.
17549340	17550340	I hope you knew that.
17550340	17553340	Uh, they're just not fucking beating the shit out of people 24 seven.
17553340	17554340	That's fucking stupid.
17554340	17557340	If you think that, um, I'm going to be nice to you when I want to be.
17557340	17564340	And I'm going to treat you terribly when I see there's an opportunity and you seem that
17564340	17566340	you want me to do that.
17566340	17568340	Um, could you be my father too?
17568340	17569340	Yeah.
17569340	17570340	I'm your daddy.
17570340	17571340	Call me daddy.
17571340	17572340	Call me daddy right now.
17572340	17573340	I'm waiting for it.
17573340	17583340	When did you call daddy and chat?
17583340	17584340	Perfect.
17584340	17587340	Oh, actually, I like being called daddy.
17587340	17588340	Hello.
17588340	17593340	It's kind of, it's kind of hot seeing like guys be like, yes, daddy.
17593340	17594340	It's kind of hot.
17594340	17595340	I don't know.
17595340	17597340	Did that just awaken something in me?
17597340	17598340	Damn.
17598340	17600340	Maybe it's like the corruption.
17600340	17605340	Um, noted.
17605340	17613340	Uh, I think that's definitely like a gender role thing, like reversal.
17614340	17617340	Like I am, I'm the man, this relationship or the woman.
17617340	17618340	Maybe that's, maybe that's it.
17618340	17619340	I don't know.
17619340	17621340	I have to dive into that.
17621340	17626340	She got unlocked again.
17626340	17631340	Dad, please put the belt down.
17631340	17632340	Not again.
17632340	17633340	Not the belt.
17633340	17634340	That shit hurts.
17634340	17641340	I've hit myself with a belt because my mom, my mom and my dad were like, oh, we were
17641340	17642340	going to use a belt.
17642340	17643340	You're lucky we don't use a belt on you.
17643340	17644340	And I'm like, yeah, this doesn't hurt.
17644340	17648340	And I was like, ah, on my arm.
17648340	17653340	Daddy, she be model one, like as in my dad, dad or like me as a dude, because I would
17653340	17655340	look, I would be the sexiest.
17655340	17656340	What is it?
17656340	17667340	Ikeman, Ikeman, Ikeman, Ikeman.
17667340	17669340	I was deaf spanked as a kid.
17669340	17670340	Okay.
17670340	17680340	I have to share that.
17680340	17690340	Oh, to be belted by daddy, she be.
17690340	17691340	That's me come to papa.
17691340	17696340	And you just like not on my leg or something because you're humping it or whatever.
17696340	17709340	Yeah, I think just people trying to be that because they're like, yeah, they're trying
17709340	17713340	to like, think I'll be submissive with them.
17713340	17719340	Um, no, no.
17719340	17727340	Even if you like, even if I was like, like if I was in like icy shoes and I was like
17727340	17734420	doing her character and her niche and she is like, definitely a switch because she's
17734420	17738340	like, you know, I keep, I keep smacking the mic with my hands because I throw them around.
17738340	17740340	Like she's a cute little girl.
17740340	17742340	You're her odyssin.
17742340	17745340	But then she's like a little feral polar bear.
17745340	17754340	Like, even if you talk to me like that when I was in like my cute space, um, I would literally
17754340	17756340	just like want to fucking punch you because that's cringy as fuck.
17756340	17758340	And that's not how you do that.
17758340	17765340	Like there is a right way to Dom and there's a right way to be a sub in the way that some
17765340	17771340	of you guys try to Dom is so fucking pathetic.
17772340	17774340	Father, may I have a piece?
17774340	17775340	Oh, come here.
17775340	17776340	It's funny.
17776340	17779340	One of my, um, emotes is me going up ease.
17779340	17782340	So you guys will be able to use that.
17782340	17784340	It just knows the rabbit mouth.
17784340	17785340	Yeah.
17785340	17786340	I like having this on.
17786340	17787340	I prefer it.
17787340	17789340	It prefer Dom and women.
17789340	17790340	Yeah.
17790340	17796340	I'm like, you have, I'm like, you definitely have never touched a woman before.
17796340	17797340	You won't.
17797340	17804340	It's like, this is like you talk like how you only watch porn, you know, it's no right
17804340	17805340	way to be Dom.
17805340	17808340	But looking at some of these messages, the chair is the wrong way.
17808340	17809340	Exactly.
17809340	17816340	Cause I have like, and it's funny because like I've seen like some of the stuff like you'll
17816340	17822340	send like Amy and I see or like kind of like the target demographic for being like, like
17822340	17824340	their subs.
17824340	17827340	Like, and nobody talks to them like that.
17827340	17831340	Like they, they, like they treat them with respect.
17831340	17836340	They're like, oh, I just want to take care of you, pan for you, do this, do that.
17836340	17841340	And then like sometimes they'll say something a little bit more charged, but it's never
17841340	17845340	like, I'm just going to like, what if I did this to you and did that?
17845340	17847340	Like, what are you going to do about it?
17847340	17850340	I'm like, nobody sends them that shit.
17850340	17852340	They send them normal shit.
17852340	17856340	I'm like, why are you sending me the shit?
17856340	17860340	I literally, I remember there's like one, somebody said something like that.
17860340	17863340	And I was like, I see, come get your OG son.
17863340	17868340	And she's like, I don't want him.
17868340	17869340	Yeah.
17869340	17874340	It's like people have this idea of like what it is to be this or that.
17874340	17881340	And it's, it's, and honestly, like porn has a, I keep smacking the microphone because
17881340	17885340	it's right near my hand.
17885340	17892340	It is because of porn perpetuates on like kind of like role stereotypes for things because
17892340	17896340	like you always see the fucking girl getting choked out, pounded.
17896340	17897340	Oh, yes, daddy.
17897340	17898340	Oh, yes, daddy.
17898340	17899340	Oh, yes, please.
17899340	17900340	Oh, yeah, you fucking shit.
17900340	17910340	Like, no, it's not real.
17911340	17913340	Their existence challenges their masculinity.
17913340	17915340	They don't know how to deal with that.
17915340	17925340	But like, but like, if I challenge your masculinity, you don't have to interact with me.
17925340	17933340	Like that's like you don't, like people feel like they have been like they need to like
17933340	17937340	they have to respond to something you don't have to.
17937340	17941340	Like if you don't like me, you don't have to watch me right now.
17941340	17946340	If I'm not your cup of tea, you can watch one of the other girls that you're totally fucking
17946340	17948340	entitled to that.
17948340	17951340	Like you don't have to try to prove yourself.
17951340	17954340	You're the alpha male.
17954340	17956340	Just be a regular dude.
17956340	17958340	Just be yourself.
17958340	17959340	Please.
17959340	17961340	Emotional damage.
17961340	17965340	It is real emotional damage.
17965340	17969340	Everybody's sending me really cheesy jokes now.
17969340	17972340	It's illegal to laugh out loud in Hawaii.
17972340	17974340	You have to keep it a low hot.
17974340	17975340	Fucking God.
17975340	17976340	I've heard that one before.
17976340	17979340	You guys fucking suck.
17979340	17980340	Oh, another one.
17980340	17982340	Why did Sherlock Holmes go to the Mexican restaurant?
17982340	17985340	He was looking for a good case of Dia.
17985340	17987340	Good case idea.
17987340	17989340	Good case of Dia.
17989340	17994340	Oh, you guys are so fucking funny.
17994340	17995340	Hi, CB.
17995340	17997340	I just want to say, congrats on your debut.
17997340	18001340	You've been working so hard and streaming daily more than once daily most days.
18001340	18003340	And I really appreciate your content.
18003340	18007340	Also enjoy how really you are with us, your chat and your crazy antics always make me smile.
18007340	18009340	Thanks very much for all your hard work.
18009340	18013340	You're truly another one of your followers.
18013340	18015340	Thank you so much.
18015340	18022340	I always thought it was a detriment to my content that I talk so much and that I overshared.
18022340	18027340	And then I realized people really appreciate that transparency.
18027340	18028340	And I'll be honest with you.
18028340	18036340	I'll watch other streamers and I don't think they talk as bluntly as I do.
18036340	18038340	I hear a weird noise.
18038340	18040340	Oh, it's boomie hysteric.
18040340	18052340	He's pushing a one of the cat bowls around full of the food because he's like pushing it as he's eating.
18052340	18055340	And I don't mean like I'm blunt in a negative way.
18055340	18058340	Sometimes it can be.
18058340	18067340	Sometimes I let myself kind of go too far and say things that I probably shouldn't.
18067340	18077340	But I feel like with most restrictions or like ideas of how someone should be in a community.
18077340	18083340	Like I really pride myself on these deep talks that we have.
18083340	18086340	I personally I don't get those a lot.
18086340	18093340	Especially like I can't really talk about like VTubing stuff with people except for you guys.
18093340	18097340	I don't have any people that like friends that watch VTubers.
18097340	18103340	So yeah, I love these talks.
18103340	18107340	Yeah, I'm a little crazy.
18107340	18108340	I'm a little cuckoo.
18108340	18110340	I'm a silly, silly Billy.
18110340	18117340	As for my streaming schedule, it's going to be a bummer because next week I'm not streaming as much.
18117340	18121340	I'm going to probably be streaming for the minimum two hours each time.
18122340	18125340	Just because I have to work.
18125340	18128340	I am actually working full shifts.
18128340	18133340	I don't start my part-time job for a couple of weeks, which fucking sucks.
18133340	18136340	I might...
18136340	18145340	I am debating on leaving my job completely and just kind of throwing it to the wind.
18145340	18152340	Yeah, I'm just debating to not even bother with a part-time job.
18152340	18155340	Just because it'll be...
18155340	18156340	I'll be honest with you.
18156340	18162340	I don't know if I'll have the same energy because if I'm working eight hour shifts interacting with people all day and talking all day,
18162340	18167340	I'm not going to want to talk as much.
18167340	18173340	But then I remember I did it back when I was an indie, so I'm like, I can do it again.
18173340	18179340	So I will try my best. Please be patient with me.
18179340	18182340	I have like a couple days off a week.
18182340	18189340	I will be taking more days off just so I can recharge because I've been streaming every day for multiple hours.
18189340	18192340	I've been pulling a strone.
18192340	18199340	And like this person said, I have been streaming twice a day like I'm doing today.
18199340	18206340	So I know you're probably used to my consistent time as well of being 4pm Eastern time.
18206340	18209340	That is probably going to change in the next few weeks.
18209340	18212340	But again, honest, if...
18212340	18222340	If I perform well enough and Patreon does well, everything does well,
18222340	18227340	again, I will probably fucking quit my job and just try to do this full time.
18227340	18233340	And maybe I'll do it anyways, even if I don't have the target amount that I want to make yet.
18233340	18235340	Oh, aren't you funny.
18235340	18236340	Dumbloser tipped $4.
18236340	18238340	Thanks Dumbloser.
18238340	18243340	Hello mom, I would like to beg for attention by donowing money to disrupt your stream with a funny joke.
18243340	18245340	Oh, lovely.
18245340	18249340	A woman walked into a bar. She said out.
18249340	18255340	That was so fucking stupid.
18256340	18259340	The name was pretty apt.
18259340	18261340	Name checks out.
18261340	18265340	Was it an owl?
18265340	18266340	She said a woman.
18266340	18268340	He said a woman walks into a bar.
18268340	18273340	She said out.
18273340	18278340	I've heard like the two men walking to the bar and they say out and honestly I find that funny.
18278340	18281340	Funny joke.
18282340	18284340	I didn't get the first part of the joke.
18284340	18287340	A woman?
18287340	18289340	Yeah, a bar, a metal bar.
18289340	18293340	Some people might have not gotten that if they maybe English is in their first language.
18293340	18295340	I prefer the pirate one.
18295340	18299340	A pirate walks into an hour.
18299340	18301340	How do you not get it?
18301340	18303340	Relax, don't be mean.
18303340	18306340	Some people don't get it. They're a little bit slower than others.
18307340	18311340	Leave the people who are ESL alone.
18311340	18314340	They're trying their best out here.
18317340	18319340	But yes.
18319340	18321340	Hi, Sheedy.
18321340	18324340	My name is Sheedy.
18324340	18327340	You watch gushing over magical girls.
18327340	18329340	If not, you should check it out.
18329340	18332340	Love you, you goofy bitch, endearing.
18332340	18335340	You goofy bitch.
18336340	18339340	I've never heard of gushing over magical girls.
18339340	18341340	Maybe I will check it out.
18341340	18343340	I'm Adam Sheeby.
18343340	18345340	Here's your joke for, wait a second.
18345340	18348340	One of you just exposed yourself.
18348340	18354340	Oh, interesting.
18354340	18357340	This is you, huh?
18357340	18359340	Okay.
18359340	18362340	Someone.
18362340	18365340	Oh, because I recognized a little fate.
18365340	18367340	Okay, interesting.
18367340	18370340	Because some of you guys write in a very unique style.
18370340	18374340	And I like to play a game if I can match the person messaging in my chat.
18374340	18378340	He's fucking exposed himself.
18378340	18381340	Hi, Madam Sheeby, here's a joke for you.
18381340	18383340	A pirate walks to a bar.
18383340	18385340	The bartender looks at him quizzically and asks,
18385340	18389340	Sir, are you aware that you have a steering wheel attached to your pants?
18389340	18391340	The pirate looks at him and responds,
18391340	18394340	Oh, and it'd be driving me nuts.
18405340	18407340	Everybody really likes that one.
18407340	18409340	I guess he nailed it.
18412340	18415340	Oh, yeah, you preferred it.
18415340	18417340	Sorry, bro.
18417340	18420340	Get exposed.
18420340	18422340	Madam, I'm thirsty.
18422340	18424340	I need fresh supplies to be made.
18424340	18426340	It needs to be direct from the source.
18426340	18428340	Will you allow me to hydrate myself?
18428340	18431340	Will my do my best at making you feel good as well?
18431340	18433340	Are you going to also get me a drink?
18433340	18435340	That'd be nice.
18435340	18437340	PS, I love you for being you.
18437340	18439340	You're my Kamiyoshi.
18439340	18441340	I'm your fucking co-
18441340	18443340	I'm your Kamiyoshi!
18443340	18445340	Stop.
18445340	18447340	Stop, I don't deserve that.
18447340	18449340	I don't even do anything.
18449340	18451340	Why do you fucking talk and do silly voices?
18451340	18453340	I'm not a singer.
18453340	18455340	I'm not doing crazy content.
18455340	18457340	I'm not this, I'm not that.
18457340	18459340	I don't know why.
18461340	18463340	Highlights and shambles now.
18472340	18475340	You'll be surprised at how far funny voices can take you.
18480340	18482340	Thank you for making every day bearable
18482340	18484340	from your tweets and streams alone.
18484340	18486340	Bless your heart.
18486340	18488340	Is it shiv over?
18488340	18491340	Probably we'll make some fresh Ibanez after this stream.
18491340	18494340	I'll try to make sure that
18494340	18497340	audio doesn't get corrupted when I do that.
18497340	18500340	When I sent the tip, I was messing with you.
18500340	18503340	I was an attempt to disrespect you and for that, I'm sorry.
18503340	18506340	No, this is an attempt to dodge the timeout.
18506340	18508340	I had that coming.
18509340	18511340	Ah, ah, ah.
18511340	18513340	Ah, ah, ah.
18513340	18516340	Ah, ah, ah. You picked the wrong time to mess with me, boy.
18516340	18519340	You picked the wrong time to mess with me.
18521340	18523340	You think when I'm putting you in your place,
18523340	18525340	that's the opportunity
18525340	18527340	to tip and say,
18527340	18529340	no, I'm not gonna do it.
18529340	18531340	Remember, I don't, I don't like brats.
18531340	18533340	If you're a brat, you're gone.
18533340	18535340	I don't want anything to do with you.
18536340	18538340	But you apologized.
18538340	18541340	You guys are, again, we're getting to know each other.
18541340	18543340	You didn't know this about me.
18543340	18545340	You didn't know when I switched it on.
18545340	18547340	I don't like to be interrupted, although I said in my debut,
18547340	18549340	I don't like to be interrupted during playtime.
18549340	18551340	Um, you'll be forgiven.
18551340	18553340	You're gonna be, you're gonna stay in your timeout.
18553340	18555340	And I'm gonna both think about what you've done.
18555340	18557340	Okay?
18557340	18559340	If you're still lurking,
18560340	18562340	your apology is accepted.
18564340	18566340	Didn't she say that?
18567340	18569340	Anuma's tip, $2.
18569340	18571340	Anuma's?
18573340	18575340	Oh, great.
18582340	18584340	Uh, thank you for the $2.
18584340	18586340	Uh, moving on.
18586340	18589340	Hi, Madam Sheeby, do you ever wear glasses at all?
18589340	18591340	Uh, I'm wearing glasses right now.
18591340	18593340	Because I'm fucking blind.
18593340	18595340	Or do you find glasses attractive?
18595340	18598340	Do you find those people who find glasses, uh, quite attractive?
18598340	18602340	I assume because of how the frame and magnify the eyes,
18602340	18604340	which I find quite pretty.
18606340	18609340	Everybody was just like, eh.
18609340	18611340	Uh, no, yeah, I wear glasses.
18611340	18614340	Um, most of the time I wear contacts when I'm out and about,
18614340	18616340	but I wear them at home.
18616340	18619340	Because I just don't feel like sitting here with my eyes drying out.
18619340	18622340	And then most of the time I accidentally fall asleep wearing them.
18622340	18626340	But with my glasses, I, um, you know, obviously take them off my face.
18629340	18631340	It's funny.
18631340	18635340	Because I used to complain about not being able to see
18635340	18638340	even sitting in the front row at like school.
18638340	18640340	My mom like just like never believed me.
18640340	18642340	And then they finally took me to the eye doctor and they're like,
18642340	18645340	oh yeah, her vision, not good.
18645340	18649340	And it's like, I don't even, like my parents have like 20, 20 vision.
18649340	18652340	Not a lot of people wear glasses in my family.
18652340	18654340	They're getting older now, so they have to wear readers,
18654340	18659340	but like, I think like only like my uncle and my dad's side has to wear glasses.
18659340	18661340	And I'm like, what the hell?
18661340	18664340	Mom? Is there something you need to tell me? No, I'm kidding.
18664340	18667340	If you saw me and my dad, you'd be like, oh, that's copy paste.
18667340	18669340	Uh, she just has titties.
18669340	18671340	Um, and is a woman and I'm cute.
18671340	18673340	I don't look like a man, I promise.
18674340	18677340	Um, how much grade do you use?
18677340	18679340	It's not that bad.
18679340	18684340	I'm like, hold on, I have to remember.
18684340	18687340	Fuck, what is my prescription?
18687340	18698340	I'm like negative 0.25 in one eye and then 0.2 in the other or 0.3 in one eye
18698340	18700340	and 0.3, 0.5 in the other.
18700340	18703340	So like, I'm not going to lie to you.
18703340	18706340	I used to have a really, like when I was younger,
18706340	18708340	I was born with fucking googly eyes.
18708340	18712340	My dad used to call me like, call me fucking googly eyes, essentially,
18712340	18714340	because I had a really bad lazy eye and moved to the side.
18714340	18716340	I don't wear patches, kid.
18716340	18718340	So I was a pirate.
18718340	18723340	Um, it was corrected, but I can control it now.
18723340	18728340	So I can make my eye go like really, uh, really fucking like lazy.
18728340	18731340	And be like, hey, and then I always do that to people.
18731340	18733340	Like I would do that to my coworkers in the middle of talking to them
18733340	18737340	and they'd like freak out because my eye just like slowly drips away.
18740340	18744340	Um, but my mom, my mom's, my mom's just like, oh yeah,
18744340	18748340	you fucking hated the iPad, you would take it off and stick to the TV.
18748340	18751340	And then you just keep watching TV.
18751340	18755340	But then she's like, it didn't make sense because then you couldn't see past the sticker
18755340	18758340	and you would complain you couldn't see with it all.
18758340	18760340	Oh my God.
18760340	18762340	I don't have to tell you, mom.
18762340	18764340	Lazy Susan type beat.
18764340	18768340	Um, just sort of wore a second eye patch under the first one.
18768340	18773340	Um, yeah, that was like when I was like, like five or six or seven though,
18773340	18774340	I can't remember.
18774340	18777340	I don't, I like, I generally don't even remember wearing one.
18777340	18779340	It was only like, I only know that I had one from like pictures
18779340	18780340	of when I was super young.
18780340	18782340	I'm like, I don't even remember that.
18783340	18787340	Um, no, but it wasn't even, it wasn't an eye patch.
18787340	18792340	It was like a little sticker you literally go over your eye with.
18792340	18795340	Like it's like a little, like it's just a giant fucking sticker for your face.
18795340	18797340	And you just smack it on.
18797340	18801340	It's not like, so there could have been a second mercy.
18801340	18804340	Um, I actually did do that thing.
18804340	18808340	I would actually cover my eye a lot so I could see in the dark.
18809340	18812340	I would, uh, I would do that.
18812340	18814340	I would a hundred percent do that.
18814340	18816340	I was such a fucking shooting kid.
18816340	18820340	You have no fucking idea doing Naruto hand signs running around like,
18820340	18821340	like a fucking ninja.
18821340	18825340	I was so, I'm surprised.
18825340	18828340	My parents didn't get me locked up with how delusional I was.
18828340	18829340	She be demon.
18829340	18831340	I, yeah, it was my, that was my demon.
18831340	18832340	I'm my lazy.
18832340	18833340	I was my demon.
18833340	18837340	I, I can't even, I can't even remember which one is like, was my lazy.
18837340	18843340	I think it's the one that was, that has a higher, um, or technically a lower,
18843340	18845340	like prescription or whatever.
18845340	18846340	Our prescription.
18849340	18850340	Believe it.
18851340	18854340	Can we get some of the Chuni back now?
18854340	18855340	You got mercy for that.
18855340	18856340	She's a Chuni.
18857340	18858340	I'm no longer a Chuni.
18858340	18859340	I'm such a fucking normie now.
18859340	18866340	Like, uh, I used to be the hugest weeb in Korea boo.
18866340	18869340	Um, I was a weeaboo and a Korea boo in the worst way.
18869340	18870340	I was singing in Japanese.
18870340	18872340	I mean, my friend would talk to each other in Japanese.
18872340	18874340	I actually knew a lot of Japanese.
18874340	18877340	Uh, my Japanese name was like Mitsuko word of the fuck.
18877340	18880340	Um, we refer to that.
18880340	18882340	We would pass notes in Japanese.
18882340	18888340	Um, we would pretend we were, uh, anime characters all the time.
18888340	18891340	Uh, we talk in those stupid ass voices.
18891340	18894340	Like, oh my God.
18895340	18898340	So you discovered my secret power.
18900340	18902340	She has no idea what's going to hit her.
18902340	18903340	Ah.
18909340	18911340	Should be got a real job.
18911340	18912340	I know.
18912340	18913340	Yeah.
18913340	18914340	I know.
18914340	18917340	I really, I actually, like my job, like actually spoke Japanese pretty well.
18917340	18925340	And, um, I can actually, I'm very good at picking up on like accent and how to say something.
18925340	18931340	Um, I have a lot of, uh, Chinese customers and they would teach me Mandarin.
18931340	18936340	Some of them would teach me Cantonese and they would like say a word and I would just repeat it to them.
18936340	18938340	And they're like, Hey, that was actually pretty good.
18938340	18940340	I'm like, yay.
18940340	18946340	Oh, you need to be, um, yeah.
18946340	18947340	Yeah.
18947340	18948340	Oh, she was great.
18948340	18949340	I missed her.
18949340	18950340	I haven't seen her in years.
18950340	18954340	Uh, I remember I tried reaching out to her, but it just like got no word back.
18954340	18957340	Like, you know, like people just go to college and they drift away.
18957340	18959340	Like that's, that's just kind of what happened.
18959340	18962340	Um, but I bet she's, I bet she's like prospering out there somewhere.
18962340	18965340	She was, she was a really talented artist.
18965340	18969340	I'll tell you that she was, she's probably like some fucking big animator right now.
18969340	18971340	I would not be surprised.
18971340	18974340	Um, super fucking talented.
18974340	18975340	Redacted.
18975340	18980340	If you're watching this, I miss you.
18980340	18984340	You know, you are.
18984340	18991340	Kiri and Muda forever.
18991340	18996340	She be Chunibom.
18996340	18999340	You know, there's me who goes through a friend every month for not really figuring out who
18999340	19000340	I vibe with.
19000340	19003340	Um, honestly, I would.
19004340	19007340	I imagine she's just, that'd be crazy.
19007340	19011340	Uh, no, they do not have the same art style because she has a very distinct art style.
19011340	19018340	Um, uh, that, I feel like that has to do more with you than it actually has to do with
19018340	19020340	the people that you're hanging out with.
19020340	19026340	Um, because you have to, you don't want to be friends with the saint.
19026340	19028340	Like, because my friends are totally different from me.
19028340	19030340	Totally different.
19030340	19032340	Um, hello.
19032340	19033340	Welcome back.
19033340	19037340	Um, she was a tough over.
19037340	19041340	Um, give people a chance.
19041340	19043340	Make sure you get to know them.
19043340	19046340	Uh, you don't make friendships in a month.
19046340	19050340	And sometimes you just have the personality traits of just like kind of just being an introvert
19050340	19051340	and that's okay.
19051340	19052340	You can have acquaintances.
19052340	19055340	You don't have to be friends with people, you know.
19055340	19056340	Yeah.
19056340	19057340	I could change your group.
19057340	19058340	Yeah.
19058340	19059340	Yeah.
19059340	19060340	No, thank you.
19060340	19064340	Um, different races, different backgrounds, different cultures, uh, different levels of
19064340	19065340	baseness.
19065340	19067340	You got me in the middle.
19067340	19071340	You got olive at the beginning and you got Salem way.
19071340	19075340	Fucking bass is fuck.
19075340	19081340	Um, and then like I have other friends who are like married.
19081340	19082340	I have friends who have like kids.
19082340	19086340	I have friends like, so it's like, it's so good to surround yourself with people that
19086340	19090340	are so much different from you because you will learn so much from them.
19090340	19098340	Yeah, you don't have to be like, I like, I would say olive and Salem, um, are my best
19098340	19102340	friends and I would die for them.
19102340	19107340	And then I have like friends from work where they're like, I'm not going to like go out
19107340	19108340	of my way to hang out with you.
19108340	19114340	I'm not going to like, if you can, if you have some fucking car trouble, come and pick you
19114340	19116340	up because that's like the good thing to do.
19116340	19124340	Um, but like, I don't really want to hear about how some dude broke up with you and you're
19124340	19128340	just like, because again, I'm so fucking nice and people just tell me their entire life
19128340	19133340	stories and I just have to like compartmentalize that and took it behind me and just be like,
19133340	19134340	yeah, okay.
19134340	19136340	And then I just moved on with my life.
19136340	19138340	It was a pony roll point.
19138340	19141340	What an RP group that lasted four years.
19141340	19144340	Hey, man, I was in a lot of RP groups.
19144340	19146340	I was in both RP groups.
19146340	19148340	So don't even get me started.
19148340	19151340	Oh, wiki foundry and wet paint forever.
19151340	19153340	Black bloods, black bloods.
19153340	19154340	Sorry.
19154340	19156340	Black bloods back.
19156340	19157340	That's back.
19157340	19165340	Um, Sasuke Itachi, itachi can't get heartbroken if you've never dated.
19165340	19167340	Oh, sweetheart.
19167340	19169340	Oh, sweetheart.
19169340	19171340	I'll be honest with you.
19171340	19173340	Girls are very fucking brutal.
19173340	19183340	Uh, and then confidence is a thing like you have to, you know, work on your own like self-love
19183340	19184340	and all that stuff.
19184340	19189340	Because sometimes you feel like you're unlovable because you don't love yourself yet, you know.
19189340	19194340	Uh, and yeah, you can get heartbroken even if you never dated.
19194340	19195340	You're right.
19195340	19198340	I've gotten heartbroken after fucking anime characters.
19198340	19206340	I've gotten heartbroken over, you know, having a like a whiplash for a Vtuber.
19206340	19207340	I watched.
19207340	19208340	I totally get that.
19208340	19209340	I get it.
19209340	19210340	I get it.
19210340	19212340	I've never been rejected.
19212340	19216340	Uh, I would go out of my way to get rejected.
19216340	19217340	I don't mean to like guys or whatever.
19217340	19219340	I mean, just like in general, like, hey, can I have this job?
19219340	19220340	Can I do this?
19220340	19226340	Because when you get rejected so often, you become used to it.
19226340	19231340	And, um, it doesn't scare you as much to me.
19231340	19235340	Like you realize you can survive after being rejected.
19235340	19244340	I also, again, I grew up a very religious conservative girl.
19244340	19251340	If I looked at a boy, I thought I was going to fucking go to hell.
19251340	19253340	I remember I got some heartbroken one time.
19253340	19254340	I was physically ill.
19254340	19256340	Oh, you sweet thing.
19256340	19257340	You're helping with confidence.
19257340	19258340	You know, she'd be, I'm glad.
19258340	19261340	I'm glad I can help you guys with confidence.
19261340	19265340	I like, again, I remember some of the messages you guys sent me.
19265340	19271340	You're like, oh, I really liked your aftercare and your ASMR role play.
19271340	19275340	It really actually, like I talk to myself and I say good things about myself in the mirror.
19275340	19277340	I'm trying to eat better and go to the gym.
19277340	19285340	Um, yeah, it all, first, um, it all starts with, uh, your mindset and, you know, kind
19285340	19286340	of learning with yourself.
19286340	19290340	So, okay, I'm going to be, I'm going to be really weird with you for a second.
19290340	19292340	You don't have to do this, by the way.
19292340	19298340	It's just like what I found was good for me in a good tool, uh, one therapy, but two.
19298340	19306340	Um, so there is something in like the witchy community and it's called, uh, your shadow
19306340	19307340	self.
19307340	19312340	And that's the self that you kind of push down and it's like, you know, hidden in the
19312340	19313340	shadows, so to speak.
19313340	19316340	And you don't really like to acknowledge it.
19316340	19324340	And how you do, like, you can look up like shadow journaling and it kind of gives you
19324340	19329340	a prompt where you have to kind of confront that shadowy aspect of yourself.
19329340	19335340	Um, because I remember I had like a really toxic friend and she was like a horrible
19335340	19341340	even being to me and I just did not have the power to tell her like I can't be friends
19341340	19344340	with you because I was such a pushover at the time.
19344340	19348340	So I sat down with myself and I'm like, what am I getting out of this relationship?
19348340	19354340	What am I, I'm not gaining anything from being friends with this person who just pushes me
19354340	19359340	around, uses me only for like when I have money and she wants me to buy or something.
19359340	19362340	Like what the.
19362340	19369340	And then just like blows me off for her other friends and then talk shit behind my back.
19369340	19373340	Like what are you going to know?
19373340	19379340	And then I was just, I came down to I'm like, I didn't like myself.
19379340	19386340	That's the shadow part was I didn't like who I was and I thought that I deserved that
19386340	19391340	sort of treatment, but you have to realize you don't.
19391340	19392340	Yeah, shadow work.
19392340	19393340	Yeah.
19393340	19394340	You guys know what shadow work?
19394340	19395340	Yeah, shadow.
19395340	19396340	I fought my demons.
19396340	19399340	I shadow box my demons.
19399340	19404340	I on it like and that's and you don't have to put it in that frame of like, oh, which
19404340	19409340	you should like honestly shadow work is very similar to like normal as someone who like
19409340	19415340	I actively go to therapy who just journaling in general, such a good outlet.
19415340	19420340	So I always say work on your mental and then find a hobby that is a good outlet for you.
19420340	19422340	That's going for the gym, go to the gym for me.
19422340	19423340	I was doing jiu-jitsu.
19423340	19426340	I'm currently not able to do that right now because of my injuries.
19426340	19430580	So it became video games for a little bit and then it became vTubing vTubing is such
19430580	19431580	a good outlet for me.
19431580	19432940	I can rage at video games.
19432940	19434260	I can talk to you guys.
19434260	19437780	I can do fun stuff on my own.
19437780	19440340	So it's it's good and I can make my friends.
19440340	19441340	It's a great outlet for me.
19441340	19442340	It's a great hobby.
19442340	19446700	Um, I also I'm currently working on trying to get a more active hobby now that it's nice
19446700	19448980	and sunny outside and all that shit.
19448980	19454980	So I'm going to try to go like hiking again and whatever, um, very Jungian concept.
19454980	19455980	Yeah.
19455980	19456980	That's kind of true actually.
19456980	19458980	Jordan Pierce in shorts.
19458980	19463740	Um, and yeah, it is cathartic.
19463740	19468780	It's literally like this is almost like therapy for me because like I talked to you guys how
19468780	19472820	I talk to my therapist sometimes just in the frame of like, Oh, this is how I'm feeling
19472820	19473820	this week.
19473820	19477020	Um, I've been stressed out.
19477020	19481100	Like I was telling my therapist, like all these eyes are on me.
19481100	19486100	I don't feel like I'm like we're currently we're working through my posture syndrome.
19486100	19490700	Um, but she's on a vacation for two weeks in Europe and I don't know what, but so you
19490700	19491780	guys are my therapist.
19491780	19492780	I'm sorry.
19492780	19493780	Sorry guys.
19493780	19496780	I'm going to cry to you instead.
19496780	19505740	Um, yeah, we can tell as I can't tell what the context of that was, um, don't take your
19505740	19506740	meds.
19506740	19510900	Dude, no, uh, if I didn't take my meds, I would never leave my house.
19510900	19512500	It's not fun being a gorophobic man.
19512500	19513500	It's really not.
19513500	19514980	I don't recommend it.
19514980	19519220	I only get bad advice.
19519220	19521220	Give us your tears.
19521220	19528980	Um, collective shoulders can hold a lot of tears teasing material for later.
19528980	19532940	She is a therapist and takes her meds like a good girl.
19532940	19538380	Um, no, it's cause I'm a fucking adult and I am not self-destructive.
19538380	19539380	That is teenager.
19539380	19540380	No, thank you.
19540380	19543380	Um, I'm a grown ass woman.
19543380	19550980	Uh, yeah, I have like, don't, don't get it twisted.
19550980	19560380	I have my Manhattan moments, um, but I almost do like act upon my more Manhattan moments
19560380	19564900	because I know I'm in a like safe space in the community where it's expected for that
19564900	19565900	to open up.
19565900	19566900	She's being a woman.
19566900	19567900	Uh, whatever.
19567900	19570740	But like, I haven't even really had that yet.
19570740	19576500	I'm like, because of, I've thought of like, I like had like a negative thought the other
19576500	19577500	day about streaming.
19577500	19580620	I don't even remember what it was, but I'm like, normally I would like vent about this
19580620	19581620	on my all.
19581620	19586100	And I'm like, I don't have to do that.
19586100	19587860	I don't have to do that.
19588780	19590380	Yes.

20468460	20471740	i am quite the endurance streamer aren't i um
20478700	20483260	i've never watched vtubers before but i clicked on one of your streams out of curiosity
20483260	20487500	and now i'm lurking in all your streams i'm quite shy so i don't chat much during live streams
20487500	20492780	but i wanted to say i really enjoy your content um i'll pause there there's a lot more thank you
20492780	20497660	if you lurk thank you you don't have to talk in my streams if you don't feel comfortable

20519980	20525740	and fun you'll soon discover uh i like how blunt and honest you are it makes you feel like more
20525740	20529820	of a person than most of the other vtubers i've heard of i've been going through a rough patch
20529820	20534780	lately and your streams have been helping i'm afraid i'm becoming parasocial oh i don't know
20534780	20539500	if this is a bad thing or not all i know is that's generally not advice do you have any advice how to
20539500	20545020	prevent this if not then that's fine thanks for being chill the chillimeters app off the charts um
20547660	20553180	i can't really stop you for being parasocial um
20554060	20554560	um
20556460	20557820	you have to understand
20560140	20567420	that i'm trying to say this nicely it's gonna i think most people are pretty understanding
20567420	20572940	that like i'm probably i'm never gonna meet you in person um we're never gonna hang out together
20574140	20582780	um and i'm sorry that's not a possibility but it's for everybody's safety um and mental
20582780	20590540	well-being so nobody gets hurt uh i totally understand i've also been parasocial with
20590540	20599740	streamers before flesh tubers and vtubers alike uh i used to have dreams that pewdiepie
20600460	20608860	actually knew me and gave me a shout out on his main channel and i'll have continuances of dreams
20608860	20617820	where i run into him again um and in my dream i'm just like he's like and i'm like an old friend of
20617820	20624700	his i've never fucking met the dude i've never talked to him i don't even know i had those dreams
20627340	20633260	i haven't watched pewdiepie in years but like sometimes one of those will just pop up and i'm
20633260	20636940	just like what the fuck because i really liked him as a creator i would watch him when i came home
20636940	20643100	from school at the time so i get it uh pewds got me through a lot of shit in markiplier,
20643100	20648300	jacksepticeye and like game grumps and fucking van os's crew and all that shit i watched a lot
20649180	20657500	of youtube growing up because i didn't have any fucking friends so i get it it's hard not to develop
20657500	20662940	friendship feelings or otherwise what the people you watch especially if you really enjoy their
20662940	20671100	personality um i always said my goal was to be a content creator that you felt like you could come
20671100	20679260	home to and sit down and watch and like just kind of unwind after a long day and like you're hanging
20679260	20683580	out with an old friend playing video games and chatting with them that was kind of my goal um
20686460	20690380	but like i know that's probably really a little bit problematic now given like
20690380	20695660	vtubers are kind of again a little bit more parasocial because you can't see me it's hard to
20695660	20699900	remember them a human being sometimes and you know i can't really blame you for that uh
20701100	20705420	at all actually like i totally get it like i sometimes will watch a streamer and i'm like
20705420	20713180	yes they are this type of cat girl yes totally like you get caught up on it i can't blame you
20713580	20716460	can you be parasocial with your cats that's fine
20719020	20723580	bro if i were able to sample any of richie b s*** for my rap music that'd be phenomenal
20724140	20728620	this talking spectacularly because how much it relates to that very similarity for other streamers
20728620	20738620	yeah honestly i give you permission for that um i has cupcake yeah ld shadow lady oh my god yeah
20739340	20745340	100% like i watched markiplier um the most right and actually no game grumps i watched the most
20745900	20752460	and i literally if i'm i'll have him in the background and i feel like i have like two of
20752460	20760220	my older brothers hanging out with me uh playing f***ing resident evil giggling over lady dibertresque
20760220	20765980	and i'm just giggling while i'm cleaning my room cleaning the house doing this putting on my makeup
20765980	20774140	and it's like i get it i totally get it um but then you at the end of the day you have to remember
20775820	20779100	watch real what's not but i feel like a lot of my viewers are pretty
20781660	20787980	uh like they kind of are self-aware and they're like oh my god i'm falling in love with her
20788940	20796140	that's fine well like i don't want to hurt you i'll hurt you physically like
20798540	20803420	you know like i don't want to oh my god i'm literally tearing up because like i don't want to
20803420	20809900	break anybody's heart i don't want to break anybody's f***ing heart man
20818700	20824860	because it sucks having your heart broken because you can't be with someone so i f***ing get it
20824860	20832540	like i'm not gonna discourage it but
20839900	20852700	i don't really yeah i don't know what else to say like i can't stop you i can't
20855180	20866300	yeah it's an inevitable if i discourage or not
20869500	20875820	but i almost don't want to like i can't i don't really discourage it because like
20875900	20877740	there is
20880300	20883820	i i kind of think that like being parasocial is a spectrum
20885260	20890620	you have people in one end that are like this is a cool streamer i watch and then you have other
20890620	20898380	people get it and they're like i am actually married to them um and i just want to be in the
20898380	20904620	middle where you're i'm a streamer you watch you like and you can enjoy me but you just understand
20906780	20907180	you know
20909420	20914620	like you just be realistic and it sucks because like i'm a major f***ing people pleaser
20915580	20919580	and i want to make you all happy i don't want to break people's heart
20923340	20929420	um but i can't tell you not to love me i can't tell you not to like want to be my friend because
20929420	20936460	i understand it i watch so many female vtubers and i'm like oh my god i wish i could be their friend
20937660	20942860	it sucks because i know when i'll ever be even being a streamer now like i'm like i'll never be
20942860	20950060	their friend you know even it sucks i love you too much for the middle
20953020	20955900	i'm not even in this for the hornet i just want to watch someone who isn't restricting what they
20955900	20960780	say or do that's fine too um
20963420	20970780	yeah that's me though i know like emi and isi are f***ing hella parasocial with you guys
20970780	20976140	oh my god they f***ing love you guys you'd have no idea and mercy too oh my god
20977580	20983260	is there a little bit she's like a little bit laid back about it though um isi's in love with
20983260	20989820	y'all if you're gonna f***ing hunt you down parasocial responsibility kids yeah exactly
20991020	20994220	i just don't want anybody to get like hurt over me you know
21000140	21009260	and i think that's kind of also what it's like being a dom because when you're a dominatrix
21009260	21014700	and you have clients and they come in and they ask for they have certain requests
21015580	21018780	and you fulfill those requests at the end of the day
21022540	21029260	it's a different type of relationship and that's the relationship i want to have with you i want
21029260	21034700	you to feel safe with me i want you to feel you know protected with me i want you to feel like
21034700	21040940	you can go fulfill fantasies with me and if some of those fantasies have to do with be with you loving
21040940	21053020	me that's like that's okay i don't mind being loved i don't mind being loved at all
21056380	21059180	it's called codependence yeah codependence
21059900	21065580	oh should i nuke this vod i'm getting too f***ing emotional right now
21068300	21074540	i'm so lonely he cries profusely um i'm also saying this for myself
21076460	21081740	because i don't want to get too caught up i'm a very um
21082140	21082640	um
21085660	21090700	what i love i love very deeply so i also don't want to get my heart broken

22031180	22034620	try to keep up with chat and read everything they say
22035100	22041420	read every sentence and you can't skip but you have to read it as fast as chat is moving

22056860	22066620	if you blow up to like 1k viewers it would be so it would be impossible
22068220	22072860	yeah it's actually sometimes it's hard to follow chat i kind of like i prefer having a small
22073820	22081340	ccv because i can keep up with chat when we first like had our second like the 2.0 stream
22081420	22086620	and we did have around like 900 people uh consecutively watching us and trying to keep up with
22086620	22093820	chat was a nightmare i was like actually like between that and then heading 17k on my twitter
22094380	22099580	i was kind of heartbroken because it was really hard to interact with you guys like because i
22099580	22104780	couldn't i liked liking a lot of your tweets to show you that i like liked it and you know read
22104780	22108700	them and stuff and now it's almost impossible for me to do that on twitter because i just get so
22108700	22111900	many fucking notifications from people liking all the porn that i retweet
22115420	22118300	mentioned the hauling girls yeah that's why i'm like i don't think it could be
22118300	22123100	one because of how i am uh in haul live just because like
22126780	22133500	i don't like the fact that some people because they're so large start to see their audience
22133500	22139980	as a number rather than individuals and i never want to feel that and i felt it when i hit 17k
22139980	22144940	on my haul and it sucked because i'm like i'm just looking at a number and i liked it when it was
22144940	22149980	way smaller because it's weird and i know it's mostly bots thank god like i think actually
22149980	22154620	knowing that it's mostly bots kind of make me felt better because i'm like okay there's still a
22154620	22159580	couple like humans i can interact with they're still individuals they're still like it's because
22159580	22166780	of me overwhelming yeah it's a lot of bots i wish i could purge them i really wish i could purge them
22168380	22171100	but i don't want to accidentally purge like people who are normal
22174940	22180540	uh oh i'm getting eepy i need to wash my face and i put on makeup today gross
22183740	22189260	i'm trying i went to a dermatologist because i just like have been breaking out really fucking
22189260	22196060	bad and even before like streaming and stuff um because it's not like stress related um and
22196060	22202620	they're just like oh you you have like a hormone imbalance and i'm like what the fuck
22204700	22215660	because like um so like i have a lot of like issues um so i have to be on birth control
22215660	22222460	um and birth control can fuck with your hormones and that's another reason like that's why i sometimes
22222460	22230460	have to take like mental uh medication and other medication but like it also regulates other parts
22231740	22237660	that would get fucked up otherwise if i didn't take it and so it's like the lesser of two evils
22237660	22242300	is that i get fucking acne or i go i go batshit crazy so i'd rather just get acne
22243100	22250620	oh just breed me instead that's pretty common yeah like a lot of and like because i get
22250620	22258060	really like tmi if you don't like to hear about like blood or periods please click off um i used
22258060	22268140	to get really horrible painful like feeling i'm stabbed in the fucking uterus um cramps i had
22268140	22275820	to go to urgent care before uh the way i was describing it my mom felt like i had like some
22275820	22281900	sort what is it called like we have it it's not like a cis like a non nodule there's like a
22283020	22289660	like one of like an over exploded or whatever the fuck but it was really it was just pain
22290540	22298300	it was just pain i've grown up a woman this is a Tuesday for me uh no i but i don't have endo
22298300	22304860	like i don't have endo um they do they do think i have polycystic ovary syndrome um
22306140	22309660	but they're still trying to figure it out that's why i've been going to the doctor's appointments
22310780	22317420	um i hate being a fucking woman uh there's so much fucking shit um
22318380	22323180	because like they didn't ultrasound on me and they didn't see anything physical but then my endocrinologist
22323180	22330460	was telling me that like it can like you can still have it and not have actual assists which i didn't
22330460	22339820	know that um but yeah it was like i would have like really fucking heavy periods just bleed
22339820	22344300	through super pads like i'm if you're a guy you probably don't know or maybe you have a sister
22344300	22348940	maybe you do know or a girlfriend or whatever um but like a super pad is like a different thickness
22348940	22355900	it's because like uh it's not it's not i'm going to the i'm going to the pharmacy uh you need tampons
22355900	22363180	but your pussy size no it's like it's not like large and like super isn't like a super huge pussy
22363180	22370540	it's it's like the flow and what it can hold um so when you have a really heavy flow usually you
22370540	22376700	have to get like supers um so i would do that and i would bleed through them real fast i'm so sorry
22376700	22387820	if this grosses you out i'm so sorry i'm so so so sorry um but uh yeah it just like really fucking
22387820	22395020	sucks um and then my yeah i'm like i was gonna describe some more symptoms i'm like never mind
22395020	22411580	but um supersize me um i remember like my mom uh telling my dad to go get tampons for the both
22411580	22418860	of us and my dad was like uh he's like you're my wife it's fine but like this is weird he's like
22418860	22424300	why can't we just have sons and i'm like hey i'm like hi my girl it's because like it's so
22424300	22430300	because it's like your kid is growing up you know he was just like i don't know it's i don't
22430300	22434060	know how to deal with this but like my dad has a younger sister too like i haven't on but like
22434060	22441260	they are so far apart in age that my dad's is like what i remember like really conservators
22441260	22447660	religious households so like sex education is not a huge thing but like i think i think my mom
22447660	22453660	educated my dad pretty well i'm gonna get a hormonal cycle so simple yeah i hate like
22454300	22460140	going through like pms like just like being upset maybe that maybe i'm pmsing although like
22460140	22464060	what you're really knowing about being on birth control is that i'm irregular so i don't really
22465340	22468540	like i don't know what the fuck i'm gonna get it just happens
22470780	22476540	um yeah men have a hormonal cycle i think it like takes place through a day but for women
22476620	22479820	it's it's a we have a month long hormonal cycle
22482060	22488780	yeah yeah men's is daily um and then for yeah for women it's like we have like
22490540	22494460	you know before we get it we have like ovulation
22496780	22502380	right before we get it period then like the time after that and then like maybe like a
22502380	22509660	fucking day or two of rest and then it's like ovulation and then
22513500	22518220	yeah it usually happens when you sleep that's why you wake up fucking shooting everywhere okay
22519340	22522460	why why are all the men surprised that they have a hormonal cycle
22523660	22526220	guys look you got yeah you guys have a hormonal cycle
22527180	22530380	how do you think your body regulates the t an estrogen in your body
22532940	22536780	you guys never knew that men have a horn that's wow
22540620	22547260	yeah you guys yeah you're just just a lot shorter but that's like yeah there's that's a sometimes um
22548860	22555100	that's why men can kind of freak out when their t levels are low or it's like there's a there's a
22555100	22558860	or you actually don't have enough estrogen in your body because remember men and women both make
22558860	22565900	estrogen um just yeah because then we just both have different levels of it so you have two less
22565900	22573820	you're like more likely to have certain behaviors vice versa and stuff it's just part of the fucking
22573820	22580220	it out process doesn't really change for us yeah it's like it's not drastic for you guys like it is
22580220	22587020	for women so then again we don't bleed from our privates each month yeah i feel like i've always
22587020	22593980	said and like all the girls joke about this like um if men had the same sort of hormonal cycles
22594700	22604380	as women did there would be like so much difference in like how those are treated because like if you
22605260	22607420	imagine you were like kicked in the nuts for like
22610140	22614220	at least like at maximum eight days like wouldn't you want a day off
22614460	22621020	but like you don't get a day off for that you don't get a day off for having like the first
22621020	22623340	day of your period is the fucking worst
22628460	22632780	well like one get well not not like in a good way like if it like surprises you not like when
22632780	22639420	you're expecting it in like a horny way can't go to work my peepee hurt that's true
22639820	22648540	i'm thinking like one no continuous kicks wait has any of you had like a kidney stone
22650220	22654300	have any like had a kidney stone or like a really like really bad constipation
22655500	22663900	i'm like trying to find an equivalent for you to understand no drink water the pain of a period it
22663900	22670780	is not like this is like women have like women have a higher pain tolerance than men
22671900	22676060	and you guys should totally testicular torsion um
22678380	22685020	like i know there is like those like simulators you can do where you can put them on on a guy
22685020	22691820	and it will like stimulate either like childbirth or a cramp i love watching those videos i remember
22691820	22695500	they did it for like i think it's i want to take talk of like a cop did it and they turned
22695500	22702460	it up to a 10 and he was like on the ground the cop and then they they put it on a woman and she
22702460	22705820	was just like oh yeah that's really fucking hurts but she was like just like standing and looking
22705820	22714380	around she was like fine how would a guy want that because it's just you don't have to want that
22714380	22720700	but it's like it's i think it would make men a lot more empathetic would you guys would you
22720700	22726140	take care of me if i was on my period and i wasn't feeling good pissing a stone was the most painful
22726140	22732300	thing i've experienced yeah my my dad my dad's diabetic so he's more apt to get to these stones
22732300	22740540	um and my dad's like is this what giving birth is like to my mom and mom's like no it's worse
22740540	22749260	imagine if you were torn from asshole to vagina you drink the blood you're gonna earn your red wings
22751660	22755980	now i don't want to be the simulator's i'm good i stick with empathy no sympathy needed
22758780	22765260	i'm into the store for your ultra pads but um no i don't like i might thankfully because like
22765260	22768940	again so this was before i was on birth control now that i'm on birth control i barely have a
22768940	22775580	period i live in life except now i fucking zits and like normally when you're my age you don't
22775580	22781020	have acne anymore so i usually maintain it with skincare um and i didn't because i'm stupid i
22781020	22785820	like finally went to the dermatologist because my doctor was just like whoa like you like what's
22785820	22792940	happened and like i don't have like bad acne um it's more like again i've said because i'm melanated
22792940	22798380	my skin will scar if i'm wearing makeup you can't even fucking tell but like if you were looking at
22798380	22803660	me with that makeup i have like a lot of like um like dark spots on my face like they almost look
22803660	22812060	like freckles and um but like or like the beauty marks on my face um and my doctor's like yeah no
22812060	22816380	that shouldn't be doing that and so i went to the dermatologist they're like oh yeah your hormones
22816380	22823820	are like really thrown off by your um your birth control so like we're gonna like put you on this
22823820	22830220	and it actually helps like regulate it i'm like this entire fucking time i've been on this for a
22830220	22835100	year and i could have why didn't you guys tell me this sooner they're like well you shouldn't have a
22835100	22842300	side effects i'm like fuck you do pimple patches help yes they do a lot actually yeah hyperpigmentation
22842300	22847500	i get hyperpigmentation and because i have dermatillomania it's fucking annoying or excorciation
22847500	22851100	disorder whatever it's called it's like it's almost like a form of ocd where you have like
22851900	22858220	i can't really explain it you can just google it um you think emi likes picket scabs you haven't
22858220	22869020	met me yet um i fuck gore to he moment doctor moment okay richie guy i can just get a grow
22869020	22873980	beer to hide him yeah like i always say beer just like the makeup for men but like again i look
22875500	22881100	um i just look like i have a lot of fucking freckles on my face um and usually they get
22881100	22886300	mistaken because i'll like i'll go out with no makeup i don't give a shit um and people just
22886300	22892620	like think i just have a lot of freckles or beauty marks um and then if i really want to
22892620	22901020	i'll just put like foundation on and it's gone i hate having to shave every other day
22903180	22909580	yeah i can't relate besides like i'll get like a couple of peach fuzzies actually like the other
22909580	22915820	day i got like one like chin hair and i was like oh my fucking god what the fuck is this
22916540	22922540	what's going on in my face my mom's like oh yeah they have to be around your age i'm like what am i
22922540	22928780	am i mutating but i just plucked it and i'm fine and i haven't seen it since
22933580	22938140	before without a beard before i lost weight it looked like a thumb oh like a thumb from like
22938140	22945020	spy kids or if i try to grow beard looks like pubes and i don't know those words oh i know like i
22945740	22950460	a lot of my co-workers who are younger than me um some of them are guys and they can't grow
22950460	22956140	beards and like again like men and women have like different like gripes with things like guys
22956140	22959580	worry about their fucking dick size or whatever and then growing beards and then women worry about
22959580	22968060	like literally every aspect of their fucking body yeah and so um uh like so i really
22968140	22973660	i try to empathize with men because i'm like oh i'm gonna have it easy but i'm like no you know
22973660	22982300	no they kind of don't because like i'm not a boy so i don't know kind of like i i recently figured
22982300	22987580	out how rudely men treat each other based on appearance or like how they carry themselves
22988220	22997100	and i thought it was a joke but i was like listening to um what was it no this wasn't
22997100	23002700	recently it was actually like months ago what the fuck i'm talking about before leave um one of my
23003580	23009820	co-workers because i i'm uh you know i'm a nosy bitch don't forget gemini moon um
23011260	23015820	and i was overhearing my uh male co-workers talk about a group chat and like they were
23015820	23021660	like roasting this kid in it and i was like holy fucking shit jesus fucking christ why do you have
23021660	23027500	him in there if you're just gonna shit on him um so like and they were like yeah they're making fun
23027500	23032060	of his appearance or that he spoke this and that and i'm like wow they're just as bad as girls
23033500	23040620	so like i i definitely uh it kind of like threw some sympathy at me there so like when i went
23040620	23047100	guys complain like oh i can't really grow a beard that well or i'm this or that i'm like you know
23047100	23051420	i get it we just have females have a different equivalent of that you know
23054860	23061980	no that's pretty random behavior with the g's yeah or just like um men having a sort of like
23064860	23068380	kind of like what is the word i want to use
23071100	23074300	it's like dick measuring contest like you have to like prove yourself
23075180	23081180	i don't know i've just observed that i feel like you guys are like kind of passive aggressive
23081180	23090460	sometimes in friend groups early yeah like men friendships are very interesting because i'm
23090460	23094620	like do you guys actually like each other because you're like making fun of each other you're calling
23094620	23102540	each other you're doing this you're doing that hegemonic masculinity but then i see the but then
23102540	23109100	like you're all like gay as fuck i'm like are you guys gonna make out or like are you touching
23109100	23113340	him on the ass like that and i'm like looking at my co-workers i'm like is he gay i'm like oh no he's
23113340	23118380	not gay he's just hanging out with his friends i guess i don't it's called the bromance oh that's
23118380	23124620	true bromance i love you in the most heterosexual way from like ryan hega
23125020	23132700	guys are very interesting like how they like i'm i'm sorry but i've been like studying you
23132700	23138860	like i'm a fucking weirdo i'm just like what the fuck like why are they like like it's so weird
23139740	23147820	so weird like before i went on my medical leave um because again i'm a i'm a mentor to a lot of
23147820	23156860	the people in my store um and it is a male dominated field so a lot of uh gentlemen are
23158060	23163420	not like i'm in their superior and so they'll come to me and talk to about stuff and be like oh
23163420	23167820	this girl or this guy and our friends and then this happened and then this happened and i'm like
23169180	23174300	why the why don't you guys just talk about your feelings and then just like oh we don't do that
23174300	23180380	we're guys and i'm like oh that's a good point you guys never really talk about your real feelings
23180380	23188940	it's kind of like it's kind of like superficial and i don't know why like i don't excuse me you should
23188940	23195900	excuse me um have feel like you can have a safe space to talk to your bros about how you feel
23196860	23203100	like i'm like i'm sitting and listening to this kid tell me about his parents divorce
23204620	23212300	and i'm like i don't know you that well one two you have like your boys are in the corner over
23212300	23219660	there you could go talk to them about it not that i like i'm not gonna like not listen to you but
23219660	23227500	i'm like why are you but then i realize that maybe it maybe it is a cultural thing maybe it is like
23227500	23232220	a make american cultural thing like you have to be tough and you have to have this air that like
23232220	23237500	you don't have feelings and stuff and it makes me really sad like i want you to be able to talk
23237500	23243020	about your feelings men should be able to talk about their fucking feelings especially your feelings
23243100	23246620	for me you can't see but i like did the cute like tuck my hair behind the ear
23249180	23253580	fending happens in brazil too yeah i feel like it's a cultural thing but you're not weak
23254700	23259740	feelings are a fucking normal thing honestly for me when a guy shows his feelings
23261580	23266940	it shows me a sense of maturity because you're in touch with yourself you touch yourself to me
23267180	23270220	um uh you're kind of
23272700	23281580	i don't know i feel like it makes you more open-minded um secret secret for you if you have a girlfriend
23281580	23285180	or if you want one talk about your feelings but don't be weird about it
23289980	23294380	being able to talk about your feelings and be vulnerable is a sign of strength in my opinion
23294380	23302860	exactly i got that cry and riz um yeah not from the get-go don't just like you know chill
23302860	23306220	like everybody else and then when you get closer and you're like wow i really like this person then
23306220	23313820	you can be like hey i wasn't feeling so good today because you said this to me and it kind of hurt
23313820	23319340	my feelings and if the girl immediately starts bitching at you that like oh i wouldn't ever
23320300	23322620	tell her to shut the fuck up and leave her
23326860	23330780	sorry i like playing therapist and being a big sis slash mom sometimes
23331820	23337580	i don't know i just i just like helping people out gotta wait till a few drinks get into no
23338620	23342780	no you don't fucking get drunk and share your feelings because then it just sounds like word
23342780	23349980	vomit and creepy took that advice to heart to almost be her girlfriend i think at the ick they're
23349980	23355100	not the right person precisely is it a therapist or she'd be spitting facts
23357740	23362060	we have to ask more details to start taking potshots of who i was subconsciously inspired by
23362060	23369500	yeah it's hard because i know for guys because women can be really bitchy like they can be catty
23369740	23379500	um not all women but women sometimes they will be passive aggressive and they will use things
23379500	23385260	you've said to them against you and if that happens leave because they do not care about
23385260	23391820	your feelings if they're taking really low blows and shots women know how to hit you or it hurts
23391820	23397260	sometimes and some men too some men i was watching this like tiktok of these women who it was like
23397260	23403260	pop a balloon if you want to if you don't want to date this guy and it was this like really uh arrogant
23403260	23410380	like dentist doctor and so they go to interview the first woman and they're like hey so
23410940	23414540	like why did you pop your balloon like why don't you want to date him and she's like you know he
23414540	23419020	came across this really arrogant i don't really think that's appropriate i feel like this this and
23419020	23424620	this and the first thing he said to her was just like who did your teeth because they don't look good
23424620	23429820	and like that's how he responded he didn't be like oh i'm sorry you feel that way but i'm going to
23429820	23436780	rebuttal with a valid point insert point here like he just responded the most dickish way and it's like
23437740	23443500	for every woman that popped their balloon and like let me tell you like they nicely explained
23443500	23452780	why they weren't attracted to him like one woman said um i feel like your arrogance because you
23452780	23455980	come up this is like there's a difference between confidence and arrogance and i feel like your
23455980	23461260	arrogance against would get in the way of you loving me she's like i would be able to love you
23461260	23467660	but i don't think you'd have enough room to love me and then and she and then she like made some sort
23467660	23476860	of um i think like illusion i can't remember the english term like she made like a like an
23476860	23482700	illustration of um not like a physical illustration but like you know what i'm trying to say um
23482940	23490620	turn to an a yeah like a metaphor of like giving pieces of like her love in a box and him not
23490620	23498220	being able to like have it and then he illusion was right okay and then he was immediately set
23498220	23504780	like essentially just started calling her crazy and gaslighting her it was just like um well
23506060	23512140	he said like i really hear and understand you know get where you're coming from but the way
23512140	23516940	you said that did not make any sense this and this and this and he was like trying to pick
23516940	23523100	apart argument instead of just being like no i think i would actually you know have be confident
23523100	23529820	and then be able to have love for somebody and i was like this dude fucking sucks uh my headphones
23529820	23536220	died so i can't hear 33 cents feeling better thank you mr tony is as based as ever either
23536300	23542060	head off for class it's been interesting good have a good time at class pay attention do good in
23542060	23550780	school get those grades up kiddo but yeah there are guys like oh like if i find the clip i will

23555100	23561580	because i was like wow and mind you these are like gorgeous women and he and he was a nice looking
23561580	23567740	guy but then like you realize like as he's talking like oh he's an ugly man on the inside though
23568380	23572540	but so like it's true like men can also be really passive aggressive and kind of pull out stuff
23573180	23577420	that you wouldn't expect those both sides human beings just suck that's why i have three cats
23579980	23587740	lonely i'm so lonely didn't you try to mainsplain yeah self-walk yes yes that's exactly what i'm
23587740	23591420	talking about um it's like these these black women these black this black dude

23640220	23649580	stuff puts you off i understand i know some people don't like me cries um because i tend to
23649580	23655100	overshare and yeah and i was like uh he's talking about a period with the fuck girl gross
23660380	23664140	i know i know you have you guys enjoy the yapping but i mean like sometimes the
23664140	23667180	the subject matter in which i talk about it people don't like
23670700	23675660	what i like about you chibi you just did a full workshop fat did i really
23677820	23680460	holy fuck dude
23683100	23684700	what the fuck is wrong with me sometime
23687180	23691660	gets you thinking i like people to be introspective i don't you know i like philosophy a lot
23693340	23695820	just kind of like think about human nature and all that shit
23696780	23703100	casual seven-hour yapathon i mean if it's controversial something like that
23703660	23707020	a tit trigger warning or content warning wouldn't hurt
23710060	23715820	but like i don't i think we're all adults here and if you hear something you don't
23715820	23720940	like you just leave i shouldn't have to be like trigger warning i'm talking about blood
23721900	23724300	i don't i'm sorry i'm not gonna
23726300	23729100	we're adults i'm not gonna hold your hand for that stuff
23733820	23737340	and then like oh if it's like really bad like when we were doing like the class of
23737340	23741500	09 stuff i knew was gonna be edgy so i'm like disclaimer there's gonna be edgy stuff
23741500	23745260	this probably isn't the stream for you but that's like immediately when i started stream but like
23746220	23750540	and i did say like guys tmi i'm about to talk about like periods and stuff so like
23751260	23755180	i didn't preface it and i do usually preface just like kind of subconsciously
23755900	23760380	say it out loud to you guys like oh i might talk about something you not like might not like in the next
23760380	23761020	five seconds
23764380	23768060	she be made for the sake of the future we should have a rule stating we're 18 plus stream
23769180	23770220	i think that's a given

24031420	24037100	no it wasn't astell was it the whiteboard no it wasn't astell it was like it was almost like
24037100	24046620	a horse that would jump around yeah the meteor beast actually really like the design of that
24051580	24054300	the fallen star beast was actually really beautiful
24057580	24060620	no i wasn't thinking the falling star beast i'm thinking i was thinking of the one that looks
24060620	24065100	like a deer for a second um but the falling star beast yes was my favorite um and then the
24065100	24070540	deer one was also really gorgeous is what i meant to say the ancestor spirit in terms of looks
24070540	24075820	hell yeah um astell yeah i was fine um
24078380	24082540	elton dragon monster the ender dragon was pretty cool as well
24084860	24088940	radigan damn fucking radigan i'm in love with radigan
24091020	24096860	radigan america who is pretty i just long-haired gingers
24100940	24108220	and also when they're falling apart and like leaking gold and shit it's pretty sick general adon
24111260	24119900	it took me forever to beat radon because i was so one it was like this is that was
24119900	24126940	elton ring was like the second from soft game i played um and so i didn't know how to approach
24126940	24135100	anything and then i can't like i didn't know any strats like to defeat radon
24137340	24142380	and i couldn't even like then i looked up like walkthroughs but like how to
24142380	24146940	fight him then i found like oh you can like cheese like boss i was like what the fuck is
24146940	24153500	teasing and i just figured out what it was um and then i couldn't even cheese radon properly i was
24153500	24159820	so fucking shit but then literally after i beat him i like honestly everything changed when i got
24159820	24165740	the black knife i can't lie i fucking abused the use of the black knife i'm not good at games
24165740	24170060	i just i don't play games skillfully i am just smart
24176460	24180060	figured you can use some of the weapons as terrain to eat oh yeah no yeah i knew that
24181020	24185420	wonk play style what build did you use an elton ring uh i used a
24188220	24191100	again i haven't played elton ring like a year so i can't remember a lot
24191100	24206140	but i didn't mean to do that um what is it called it was blood build
24206780	24216540	i actually i was like a blood and faith build
24219740	24222460	and i used a lot of arcane too i didn't use rivers of blood
24223260	24228700	i actually used the um the halo scythe a lot i used halo scythe the black knife
24228700	24233500	i started off as a confessor because i literally just picked one i didn't know what the fuck to
24233580	24239100	scale with i didn't know how things scaled i literally elton ring is the first game
24239100	24245020	i like actively did so much fucking research on all the fucking lore i watched about it all
24245020	24250860	about like the how the weapons scaled jesus christ i'm like i'm doing math
24254140	24257420	what am i doing oh yeah use the dragon incantations yeah
24258300	24262700	oh what the fuck did i just step on oh boomie what the hell what are you doing down there
24264460	24265260	oh we're just hanging out
24267260	24273340	yeah so it was like a faith blood build oh my god i got two please don't pee
24276380	24278060	i did not pee we're good
24278060	24284380	and he cools breath for the scarlet raw it was clutched so often yeah i did use that
24285500	24290940	drank this faith yeah fancy flame should be base clutching button
24292300	24297500	yeah uh i would probably i don't want to embarrass myself by playing other ring online
24298860	24305100	i mean like on stream i mean after strani does because strani is like such a fucking
24305180	24310540	good gamer she like hundred percent shit and i'm like looking at her watching her streams i'm like
24311100	24317500	jesus fuck why am i so shit at games and like i've played so many games for a while and i'll
24317500	24322540	actively try to be better at them but i just fucking suck man like
24322540	24336860	like like i played hundreds of hours of valorant in csgo and i still was a fucking silver okay
24339980	24345660	but then like again i but then i was like nasty a destiny in cod so i don't understand
24345900	24357500	i think valorant that's the issue listen i needed a fix i needed something else that wasn't csgo
24358300	24365100	and i liked the concept of heroes with like abilities on top of the csgo mechanics or just
24365100	24373260	counter strike mechanics in general um i probably won't i was not a valet girl um i probably won't
24373260	24377660	play fps is on stream because everybody fucking loses their marbles when streamers do i keep just
24377660	24386780	smack the mic again i'm sorry um like how you guys bullied azura into not boy tips three dollars and

25234940	25243900	um and then i had a waddle my little cold wet ass to the my closet to grab a towel and fia and
25243900	25250140	boomie are in between my legs and i'm like i'm gonna die i'm wet i'm cold i'm afraid i'm gonna
25250140	25257020	trip over a child and i was able to tell myself uh this is how my dog feels after a bad session
25257340	25264940	i remember i had to like bathe fia in the sink she's really tiny so i can just put her in the
25264940	25270620	sink boomie you'd have to put in the tub um but we put her in the sink and i always recommend if
25270620	25276940	you're gonna bathe a cat or even a dog make sure um you put like a towel actually under them and then
25276940	25280940	when you fill it up with water because they can't they freak out when they don't have grip because
25280940	25285180	when they have grip they'll actually just kind of stand there uh so if you lay something down
25285180	25291020	they'll feel a lot better um so i put uh the towel in the sink filled up with you know lukewarm water
25291020	25296860	and she just looked like such a little wet rat i wonder if i can find a i can't did i take a
25296860	25302540	picture of her i don't think i was able to because i was just in my hands are full and then um i have
25302540	25312540	a towel warmer that um i got for christmas and and it's like i was i threw a towel in it and
25312540	25317500	i took her out she was all bundled up in a little perrito and a towel and she was just like screaming
25317500	25325580	and stuff but it was cute and i dried her off um this is when she um her legs didn't work so i had
25325580	25331500	to bathe her because she couldn't like move maneuver her body to bathe herself and sometimes
25331500	25336060	she would have to go accidents but i'm a good mama i clean up after her
25336060	25342940	can we get a wet cat pick next time excuse me
