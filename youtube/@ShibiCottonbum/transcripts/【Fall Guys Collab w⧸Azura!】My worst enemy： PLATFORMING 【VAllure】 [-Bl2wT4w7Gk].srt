Imagine. Imagine. Imaginate me.

89
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,240
Imagine. Imagine. Imagine that

It's like a lot of fun.

96
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,820
Ah!

97
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,040
Sib is dead.

98
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
No!

99
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
I'm dead?

100
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:06,240
It was just the screaming you did, and then the boom.

101
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
I just go quiet.

102
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,740
Ah!

103
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:18,240
Ah!

104
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,420
OK, I'm going to say 25 people will try to get in.

105
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,340
That's the goal.

106
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,580
A lot of some people said they were downloading the game now

107
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,420
in my chat.

108
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,140
Oh, OK.

109
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,860
Then, yeah, we'll do more than that then.

110
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,540
Maybe pin the message for the code.

111
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:44,380
I was thinking that, but once we start, yeah, it's going to get

112
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,260
to work in.

113
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,540
Like nobody's going to be able to get in for like a long.

114
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,460
Can you even join when?

115
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,740
Can you join while a game is already in motion?

116
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,500
Let's try it.

117
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,900
Is that possible?

118
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,540
Maybe you can join and queue up in a lobby later.

119
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Download!

120
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,860
Where did I even drop?

121
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:16,060
Download for guys now and play with us.

122
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,260
It's all in caps.

123
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:28,020
Five and I can't see the.

124
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,500
Just copy, paste it.

125
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Can you?

126
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I don't think you can.

127
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,500
I just copied and pasted it from when you messaged me the code.

128
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh, my brain.

129
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Oh, my God.

130
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Is there a longer than me sometimes?

131
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I like that it compresses your screams and you just get real quiet.

132
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Well, I can help you fix that.

133
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I fixed mine.

134
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
No, I meant in our call.

135
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Yeah, I can help you fix that.

136
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
It's mine.

137
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
It used to, and it was very annoying.

138
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Wait, I have all the settings trying that for that off.

139
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,500
No, I think it's a different kind of setting that you could actually fix.

140
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
I think I know which one you're talking about.

141
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
What is it?

142
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It's, it's either your.

143
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Oh, my God.

144
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
The words left me.

145
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Window settings.

146
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Window settings.

147
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Yes.

148
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Yeah.

149
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Oh.

150
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,500
How do you pin messages?

151
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
You press the three dots and click pin message.

152
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Just hover to the right of it.

153
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Okay.

154
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I'm in system settings.

155
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
System window settings.

156
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Mother guide me.

157
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Oh God.

158
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I was unprepared.

159
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
It's under sound.

160
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Yeah.

161
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Well, you got a, you know, the little gear thingy on this,

162
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,500
on the bottom right of your, like on the, the task manager.

163
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,500
And the thing that looks like a, like a volume, like the sound button

164
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
thingy.

165
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh, is it in the sound mixer?

166
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Yeah.

167
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Yeah.

168
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Yes.

169
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Not mixer.

170
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
The other one.

171
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh, I think I know what you're talking about.

172
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Found it.

173
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
It's like a whole thing though.

174
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
So maybe you might have to.

175
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Yeah.

176
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
You got to advance and then you have to make sure that everything is at 100.

177
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
And then you have to go back to your focus.

178
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Right.

179
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Then you've got to turn yourself down.

180
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Turn it.

181
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Turn it.

182
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm not doing all that.

183
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
That's too much work.

184
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Yeah.

185
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Like you should probably do it later.

186
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I know we're waiting for people, but like that, that's, that's too much work.

187
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
And I didn't do it all day.

188
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
It took me forever.

189
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
It took me how many days?

190
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Like a couple of days to get it right.

191
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Yeah.

192
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
It took a couple of days.

193
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I can't, I couldn't.

194
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Oh, okay.

195
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Yeah.

196
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Yeah.

197
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500

i'm i'm i'm stuck around the back of my head

286
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
i

287
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,780
did you get hit with copyright because you sing yeah just just random songs

288
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,020
they're not even of the like the people that actually do copyright the song that don't belong

289
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,100
to those people it's fake i know that's so dumb

290
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,820
jesus i i used to i would also sing a lot like when i streamed on twitch i don't know i said

291
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,820
twitch like i'm

292
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,860
yeah i sung like a lot on twitch my favorite thing to do and i would play music too oh my god i'm

293
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:11,420
gonna do your mod job for them but the thing on twitch is that you could uh what is it what do

294
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:18,380
you do uh you could separate the audio like the complete audio so that when you should go live

295
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:26,380
on twitch they can't hear uh the music at all but they can hear the music when you're live

296
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:33,020
but it doesn't stay in the vod so the vod doesn't get muted yeah yeah the whole freaking vod gets

297
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,980
muted yeah so i can't do that on youtube are you allowed to join yes you're allowed to join you

298
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:55,500
think we just have 42 friends with us so i'm not used to uh not singing

299
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:05,740
um i gotta use for me i kept demonetized um because of because of my boobs so

300
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,740
and lily i just smacked so much like stronti was showing me her um monetization versus mine

301
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,940
and i was just like holy i was like ineligible ineligible ineligible copyright ineligible

302
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,380
limited ads limited ads limited and i was like but then i changed thumbnails and stuff

303
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,300
and i um i appealed a bunch and thankfully i was able to

304
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:35,900
i wonder if i'll get i wonder if i'll get hit with that after probably yeah like you've been

305
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,580
doing the right thing with the the bread you have to cover your whole boob crack

306
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,740
i mean if i you i change it to the bobo tea you change it to bobo tea oh that's funny i have i

307
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:55,820
just have the sign in front of my boobs and then you um yeah because it like it did make a difference

308
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,580
if i didn't cover it all the way if the boob boob thing was still there but hey i think we'll be

309
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:09,580
getting cover-ups anyways so very soon i cannot wait i know yay i can button my shirt and maybe i

310
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:18,780
can pop a button that'd be cool cool toggle oh i thought you just love bread yeah she loves

311
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:25,020
bread so much she's stuck it in between her boobs i love bread really man it's the best thing that's

312
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:33,580
why i chose it i need uh my son to cut out a picture of the harem um so i could stick it on

313
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,420
my boobs just have you guys just wedged in between as a cover-up

314
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:46,380
it's just funny how much the algorithm has changed because like evident by azura's song covering

315
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,900
pewdie pie uh boobs in the thumbnail that used to be such a main like thing like you everybody

316
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:02,780
i struggled so hard singing that song really i had to do so many retakes because i could not

317
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:09,420
stop laughing like i would say i would laugh i would sing it i would laugh and it ended with

318
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:16,300
me having to sing monotone because if i didn't sing monotone i would laugh i know like people

319
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,220
were like why do you sound like you're singing because you're trying not to wake up your parents

320
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,260
i'm like because i yeah i also couldn't take it seriously and i'm not a good singer so

321
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:37,100
so that's why i'm like and it's so hard to match up it's a hard to match a pitch of someone who

322
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:44,540
also can't sing yeah that's the like yeah pretty can't sing right william johnson can't sing like i

323
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,940
can cover i could probably like the next song i'm probably gonna cover is like stacey's mom

324
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:57,660
which i'll be able to sing because there's actual flow and yeah in most of the lines that that were

00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Oh, fuck.

420
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,260

00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:44,260
If Solo's is only 40, why would it let us do 60 people?

428

00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,260
We could restart the lobby, and they could all rejoin again.

433
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
And it's...

434
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,260

00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,260
We don't... We don't know who's gonna be in this one.

445
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,260
I usually gap for the longer.

446
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,260
That's the longest or the waiting period. Someone just said...

447

772
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,840
Usually I put some banana on it, but I don't have any banana.

773
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,840
I kept hearing about how people see her as mommy and all, but one of the first strings.

774
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,840
I went a person involved or being concerned about our new toaster.

775
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,840
Yes, Azur is cute as fuck.

776
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,840
All the girls have quite a bit of Gatbo.

777
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,840
Moe, sorry.

778
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,840
Nutella? Yeah, it's like a hazelnut spread.

779
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:55,840
Yeah, she's a cutesy, caring type, and then I'm the Sundari type.

780
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:08,840
Sundari, but you actually hate us. I don't hate you guys.

781
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,840
Don't say that.

782
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,840
Maybe. I don't know.

783
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,840
I just think about it.

784
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,840
Sundari, but you actually beat us to death.

785
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,840
Yes, let me beat the shit out of you.

786
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,840
Azur has got Meow.

787
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,840
I'll see myself out.

788
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,840
Meow way.

789
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,840
Oh, that was good.

790
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:46,840
Hate us affectionately.

791
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,840
Yeah, I gotta keep you guessing, guys.

792
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:04,840
I'm gonna sacrifice myself so Azur gets to the final round.

793
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,840
I don't know what she's getting as a snack.

794
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,840
I feel like she's getting some sort of fruit or crackers.

795
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:34,840
Or toast. She just burns her toast.

796
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:44,840
Eating animation under her mouth. It's actually just my mouth tracking.

797
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:58,840
I promise you, I don't chew with my mouth open, but like the model tracking picks it up as I'm just like being like.

798
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,840
I'm making rice ball.

799
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,840
You're making a rice ball?

800
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,840
Yeah.

801
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,840
That's not a snack. That's a whole ass rice ball.

802
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,840
How are you making it?

803
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,840
With salt?

804
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:45,840
No, but like rice balls are different in different places, but like what type of rice ball are you making?

805
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:52,840
I was like, for me, a rice ball, I think of Italian rice balls, but you're probably doing like a Japanese rice ball.

806
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:56,840
Most likely Japanese, just how I do a rice ball.

807
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,840
Yeah, but I don't have anything to put in it.

808
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,840
So you're literally just eating a ball of rice.

809
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:07,840
Yeah.

810
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,840
I try to look for something to put in it and I like set it up to put something in it.

811
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:17,840
And then I was like, I am, let me put something in it and then I don't have anything.

812
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,840
I could have put tuna in it, but then I would have to go get it.

813
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:22,840
Yeah.

814
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:29,840
I was going to say like, oh, do you have any tuna, like canned tuna and put some mayo in it or something.

815
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,840
Rice ball filled with air.

816
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,840
No, no cheese.

817
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:38,840
No meat.

818
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,840
My fridge is so empty.

819
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,840
So does mine.

820
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:50,840
I desperately need to go grocery shopping, but I'm just way too lazy.

821
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,840
Same.

822
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,840
Too much of an effort to get ready just to go to the grocery store.

823
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,840
Oh my God.

824
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,840
That's very relatable.

825
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:04,840
Let me go wash my hands.

826
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,840
I did this without a glove.

827
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:07,840
Gasp.

828
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,840
She wouldn't wrong.

829
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,840
Oh.

830
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,840
Reminds me of this one Chinese mythology I learned.

831
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,840
Basically the lead girl was supposed to slay a dragon.

832
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,840
She set up rice balls.

833
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,840
So dragon would be like, dude, snacks.

834
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,840
Rice is the best snack.

835
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,840
All right.

836
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,840
I don't, I think, I think I have some like Jasmine rice.

837
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:49,840
I'm chewing.

838
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,840
No glove.

839
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,840
Extra love.

840
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:07,840
Yeah, I love biryani rice.

841
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,840
Oh no.

842
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:10,840
I broke this.

843
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:11,840
Oh no.

844
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,840
That's not good.

845
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:19,840
My salt, the opening of my salt, it can only open one way.

846
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,840
It's completely broken.

847
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,840
How does that happen?

848
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:24,840
I don't know.

849
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,840
I think I stepped on it.

850
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,840
How did you step on it?

851
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:30,840
I don't know.

852
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,840
I'm lazy and I never put things back on the top of my fridge

853
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,840
and they end up on the floor.

854
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,840
Damn, bitch.

855
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,840
You live like this.

856
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,840
I literally have my toaster on the floor.

857
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,840
Why is your toaster on the floor?

858
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,840
I have nowhere to put it.

859
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,840
I have nowhere to put it.

860
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
You don't have an outer.

861
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
We'll put it on.

862
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:05,840
Do you need to clean off your counter?

863
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:14,840
If anyone can see how cluttered my room looks, you'd be appalled.

864
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,840
I can't even look at my TV.

865
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:18,840
There's like things in front of it blocking it.

866
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,840
Things hanging off of the TV.

867
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:25,840
It's a little bit better but the little bit of clutter that's at my house,

868
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:31,840
I mostly picked up yesterday.

869
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,840
Squalor core, mama.

870
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,840
I literally just called you squalor core.

871
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:46,840
As there is a true knee, 100%.

872
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:47,840
It's true.

873
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,840
Want to hear my bag of bottles?

874
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:53,840
Please.

875
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:54,840
Kikimori azu.

876
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,840
Kikimori knee azu.

877
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:57,840
Can you hear that?

878
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,840
Can you hear this?

879
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:07,840
Do it again?

880
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,840
Do you just have a bag of piss bottles?

881
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:14,840
What? No!

882
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:17,840
Someone asked, do you have a piss drawer?

883
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,840
No.

884
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:25,840
Pretty sure Emmy has a piss drawer.

885
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:33,840
I wouldn't be surprised.

886
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,840
Yeah, your chat is not used to me.

887
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,840
They're just like, what?

888
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:40,840
Yeah, I'm used to this.

889
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:41,840
Don't worry.

890
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,840
I'm unfazed.

891
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,840
I don't want to hear these allegations.

892
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,840
Okay.

893
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,840
I told you guys, literally, there aren't debuts.

894
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,840
Did I not say that because the outrageous thing?

895
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,840
I'm sorry.

896
01:46:58,840 --> 01:46:59,840
I'm just blunt.

897
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,840
I said it in my debut.

898
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,840
You were warned.

899
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:11,840
You were warned.

900
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,840
I became used to it.

901
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,840
The girls have been desensitized.

902
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,840
You should see our group chat.

903
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,840
We have a memes channel.

904
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,840
Although, is there going to be sending some very interesting memes in our memes channel?

905
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:33,840
I'm just going to say that.

906
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,840
Don't out me.

907
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,840
Don't expose me.

908
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:41,840
Don't expose me like that.

909
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:43,840
Should we increase the shot quality?

910
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:44,840
Okay.

911
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:45,840
Hold on.

912
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:51,840
I have to think of something inflammatory to say.

913
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,840
Bush did nine.

914
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,840
No.

915
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,840
This is a miss.

916
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,840
See me.

917
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,840
See me.

918
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,840
See me.

919
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:03,840
What the fuck?

920
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:04,840
I don't know.

921
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

922
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:11,840
Everything's fine.

923
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:23,840
If you don't know me, if you are unused to me, my content and how I roll, just watch

924
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:30,840
either my bunny garden play through or my class of 09 play through the first one.

925
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:40,840
Because those got demonetized for reasons, but they were so worth it.

926
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:50,840
I don't understand how you got monetized before me.

927
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:51,840
I don't either.

928
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,840
I don't either.

929
01:48:53,840 --> 01:49:01,840
I don't think YouTube likes brown people.

930
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:30,840
I mean, for those who don't know, I am brown.

931
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,840
I am brown.

932
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,840
I am brown.

933
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:33,840
I am brown.

934
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:34,840
I am brown.

935
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:35,840
I am brown.

936
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,840
I am brown.

937
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,840
I am brown.

938
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:38,840
I am brown.

939
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:39,840
I am brown.

940
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:40,840
I am brown.

941
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:41,840
I am brown.

942
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:42,840
I am brown.

943
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:43,840
I am brown.

944
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:44,840
I am brown.

945
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:45,840
I am brown.

946
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,840
I am brown.

947
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,840
I am brown.

948
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,840
I am brown.

949
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:49,840
I am brown.

950
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,840
I am brown.

951
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,840
I am brown.

952
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,840
I am brown.

953
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:53,840
I am brown.

954
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,840
I am brown.

955
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,840
I am brown.

956
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,840
I am brown.

957
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:57,840
I am brown.

958
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,840
I am brown.

959
01:49:58,840 --> 01:49:59,840
I am brown.

960
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:00,840
I am brown.

961
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,840
I am brown.

962
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:02,840
I am brown.

963
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:03,840
I am brown.

964
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,840
I am brown.

965
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,840
I am brown.

966
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,840
I am brown.

967
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,840
I am brown.

968
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:08,840
I am brown.

969
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:09,840
I am brown.

970
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:10,840
I am brown.

971
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:11,840
I am brown.

972
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,840

oh fuck yeah okay perfect sounds like so confused I would not suppose no

1061
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,320

1062
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:54,000
it up over a couple days true so shit yeah so I think but I think but I think

1063
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,200
we're kind of known for like we do a lot of endurance stuff like between me

1064
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:03,280
actually everybody I think has done like at least one endurance stream I think I'm

1065
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:10,840
not quite sure yeah I don't even know what I want to do for my donathon I have

1066
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:16,120
a few plans to do but I'm gonna do a Zatsu we're all gonna chat about what

1067
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:20,840

1068
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:26,640

1069
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:30,640

take a break before the next one yeah I'm sorry I totally misheard I was like

1074

those cool cigarette holders in her mouth and she's like hey doll you want to

1076

1084
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:44,920
I can't tell if she's getting she's not so far away like she ran across the room to

1085
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:54,280
cry she be here's blinker and think what's what the fuck is a blinker I'm

1086
02:00:54,440 --> 02:01:02,320
thinking about cars what I don't they call it what is that like I've never heard

1087
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:14,320
of that I've never heard that called that when you hit a bit for long enough in

1088
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:20,440
the light starts playing oh because I like I have friends that smoke vapes and

1089
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:33,080
stuff I didn't know that was a thing I'm wait till you know I'm very I'll expose

1090
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:39,760
myself more right now I'm I'm a part of me was very thankful that nobody recalled

1091
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:47,400
in my past life that I sat during a stream for about an hour debating male

1092
02:01:47,400 --> 02:02:00,720
anatomy with my viewers because I thought I thought the little the little you

1093
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:10,080
know beans in the sack were on like behind your legs and and that's why you

1094
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:16,640
had to like man's and I remember just like complaining cuz I'm just like men's

1095
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,960
anatomy is so weird cuz it's like why is it on the front like that and I thought it

1096
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,480
was cuz I'm thinking about like in terms of like the distance of like a woman's

1097
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:32,400
stuff and a man's stuff I'm like is it okay is the ball in between the leg like

1098
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:39,560
and and so I remember I was drawing my example for people and they were just like

1099
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:47,080
kind of doing what's happening now and I was and I don't know why I thought that

1100
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:53,920
cuz it's not like I don't like I don't watch stuff so I'm just like you know I

1101
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,920
was gonna stop talking

1102
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:01,560
you need to look at the draw it again

1103
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,400
guys she tryking it

1104
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,400
I got to see this.

1105
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,400
Hold on, hold on, I got you.

1106
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:26,400
I'll show you what I mean.

1107
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:30,400
I mean, I need to see this.

1108
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:38,400
Let's people forget I grew up in a very religious Christian hospital.

1109
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:44,400
Oh, I'm sweating so bad.

1110
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,400
How about sex ed when I was a lot younger?

1111
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:50,400
I didn't really remember a lot, but I thought so.

1112
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,400
Wait, they actually taught you?

1113
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,400
Like they actually taught you?

1114
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:58,400
I thought like you were like in a religious household where like they like kept you away from it.

1115
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:02,400
Because no, my mom, my parents were like, we don't want you getting molested.

1116
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:06,400
So like here's some information.

1117
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:10,400
And they're like, if somebody asks you to do this, don't do it.

1118
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,400
I don't even remember my sex ed class in high school.

1119
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,400
Like I'll be honest with you.

1120
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:20,400
I think I might have like blanked that out for my own mental health and safety.

1121
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:24,400
Yeah, pretty decent parents telling you that early age.

1122
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:26,400
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1123
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:34,400
Being a girl and an only child, they didn't want me to get like diddle by someone in church or whatever.

1124
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:38,400
Damn, every time she hits me with these like terms, it really shocks me.

1125
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:46,400
So this is the head of the dude and he's just hanging out.

1126
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,400
And then I'm going to do this from the side.

1127
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:52,400
So I'm going to, this is his leg.

1128
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,400
Wait, we can't see it.

1129
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,400
We can't see it.

1130
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,400
What do you mean you can't see it?

1131
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,400
We can't see it.

1132
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,400
Oh wait, I'm delayed in a month.

1133
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,400
Don't worry about me.

1134
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:10,400
I kind of made his legs too thick, but don't worry about it.

1135
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:16,400
I thought like this is the butt and let me get this one.

1136
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:20,400
How do I make this bigger?

1137
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,400
Damn, look at that cake.

1138
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,400
I know, he's kind of, he's caked up.

1139
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,400
He's caked up.

1140
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:30,400
So I thought like a guy's stuff was over here.

1141
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,400
Like that's where the peepee is.

1142
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:36,400
And then this is where the balls are because they're like in between the legs.

1143
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:42,400
But then come to find out, they're actually like weirdly at the front.

1144
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:48,400
And I just think that's stupid because as a woman, you know, you have like,

1145
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:52,400
there's like too much space between the asshole and the balls.

1146
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,400
I just think it's dumb.

1147
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:58,400
Whereas as a woman, your stuff is just like down here all chilling and then you got your asshole.

1148
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:02,400
You know, don't you want to pinch it?

1149
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:08,400
Like the space between a man's asshole and his balls?

1150
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:10,400
Yeah.

1151
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,400
Is there a what?

1152
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,400
You want to pinch it?

1153
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,400
I've heard it's called the Gooch.

1154
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:18,400
Yes, the Gooch existence.

1155
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,400
I think it's stupid.

1156
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,400
I don't like that anatomy.

1157
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,400
I feel like their stuff should be a little bit different.

1158
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,400
But yeah, the women's stuff is there.

1159
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:30,400
Like, I feel like I could just pop this off and just be like,

1160
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,400
I'll make you a Kendall.

1161
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,400
And then your asshole is all the way over here.

1162
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,400
Like, I don't understand it. It's stupid.

1163
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,400
Like, what? There's too much space.

1164
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,400
There's too much distance.

1165
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:46,400
I think the reason why the tack is on the front like that,

1166
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,400
because it's the root of where it grew.

1167
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,400
What?

1168
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:58,400
I thought that prostate was like inside.

1169
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,400
Yeah, isn't that inside?

1170
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,400
Yeah, the prostate is inside.

1171
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,400
Yeah, that's like you got the booty hole and then it's like,

1172
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,400
well, like right above it.

1173
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:10,400
Because the man's spot is literally in the booty hole.

1174
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,400
Yeah. And then I know like,

1175
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,400
I also get there with like sounding and stuff,

1176
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:18,400
which is terrifying, by the way.

1177
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,400
P is stored in the balls.

1178
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,400
That's true.

1179
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,400
You know, I remember when I was younger, mind you, again,

1180
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,400
I was like probably like five when my parents taught me

1181
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:29,400
about like how to make sure that I'm not being taken advantage of.

1182
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:32,400
So I don't remember a lot because they bought me like a whole ass anatomy book.

1183
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,400
And they also got me a little book.

1184
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:38,400
I think it's called The Caring Keeping of You,

1185
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:42,400
which was really cool for like girls who were going through puberty.

1186
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:46,400
But like I also, it took me a while to figure out where my P-hole was

1187
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,400
because I thought I peed out of my clit for the longest time.

1188
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,400
But I discovered that wasn't the case.

1189
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,400
Are you serious?

1190
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,400
Damn.

1191
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,400
I have to have a mirror.

1192
02:07:56,400 --> 02:08:00,400
Was I just that exploratory when I was younger?

1193
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,400
I knew all of this from the get.

1194
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,400
What do you mean Vod's cooked? Vod's fine.

1195
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,400
This is educational purposes.

1196
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:12,400
Educational purposes.

1197
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,400
Educational purposes.

1198
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,400
Precisely.

1199
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,400
I'm getting educated.

1200
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,400
Well, I've been educated.

1201
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:24,400
But like this was probably a couple months ago.

1202
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:28,400
What just happened? Excuse me.

1203
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,400
I think I was just very exploratory.

1204
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:37,400
Just overall with anatomy as a whole.

1205
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,400
So it was very, very, very young.

1206
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:41,400
But it's funny because like I would draw and stuff,

1207
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:43,400
but I didn't draw like that stuff.

1208
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:45,400
And then like I would read like,

1209
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,400
yeah.

1210
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:49,400
And like watch stuff.

1211
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:51,400
Like a little Fuji.

1212
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,400
There's no way that you watch.

1213
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,400
Yeah.

1214
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:59,400
And didn't understand the anatomy of the boob.

1215
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:03,400
It was, I think it was like object permanence.

1216
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:05,400
I don't know.

1217
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:07,400
Like I just thought it like moves around more often,

1218
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:09,400
but it's really just tacked to the front.

1219
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:11,400
And I thought you could like tuck it.

1220
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,400
Like that's why I'm like, oh guys can tuck

1221
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,400
and I don't want to like show how much they're packing.

1222
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:17,400
You know?

1223
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:19,400
You know?

1224
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:21,400
Am I just embarrassing myself?

1225
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,400
Why am I in the horror corpo?

1226
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,400
I don't know if it was out of me.

1227
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,400
I was curious since day one.

1228
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:33,400
I really thought that when they showed you the,

1229
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:37,400
the, the, the, the, you know, the sake wacky.

1230
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:39,400
Can I call it a sake wack?

1231
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,400
The wacky to back.

1232
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:43,400
When they showed you it in the pictures,

1233
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,400
I always thought it was like an egg.

1234
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:47,400
Yeah.

1235
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,400
So I was very curious.

1236
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:51,400
And, and like, because of like,

1237
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:53,400
because like there's stuff is on the inside.

1238
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,400
I thought it was like,

1239
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:57,400
I didn't know that it was like holding stuff on the inside.

1240
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:59,400
I thought it was like the organ itself.

1241
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,400
Like I didn't like the sack is holding the testes.

1242
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,400
I just thought it was like,

1243
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:05,400
it was the testes just covered in skin.

1244
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,400
Don't crack it.

1245
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:09,400
Everybody is terrified of you cracking the nuts.

1246
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,400
Oh, he cracked the nuts.

1247
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:13,400
Yeah.

1248
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:15,400
Yeah.

1249
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:17,400
I always thought it was, I always thought you like,

1250
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,400
it would actually crack.

1251
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:21,400
Like when I was younger, I was like,

1252
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:23,400
Oh, does it really hurt?

1253
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:25,400
I accidentally kicked someone like a long time ago.

1254
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:27,400
It was an accident.

1255
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:29,400
Like for real.

1256
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

1257
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:33,400
Thank you.

1258
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:35,400
Believe me.

1259
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:37,400
Believe me.

1260
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:39,400
Believe me.

1261
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,400
I remember when I was younger,

1262
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:43,400
I was playing tag with friends and at recess,

1263
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:45,400
aka I don't know if any European friends don't eat recesses,

1264
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:47,400
but just like a break time

1265
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:49,400
from after lunch and stuff.

1266
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:51,400
And we were playing tag and this one kid

1267
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,400
jumped off of a

1268
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,400
we had like these like benches

1269
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:57,400
and he jumped off of it and I went

1270
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:59,400
to go

1271
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:01,400
tag him and I ended up punching him in the nuts

1272
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:03,400
as he jumped off

1273
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:05,400
and he just started crying

1274
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:07,400
and I being a girl

1275
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,400
called him a little bitch

1276
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:11,400
because I'm like, why the fuck do you crack?

1277
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,400
I've taken

1278
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,400
shots of the pussy, you know.

1279
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:17,400
There's no way.

1280
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:19,400
There's no way because I remember

1281
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:21,400
when I was younger, I fell.

1282
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:23,400
You know those old wooden beds?

1283
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:25,400
Oh, yeah.

1284
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,400
I fell on one.

1285
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:29,400
I fell on the headboard.

1286
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:31,400
I was fucking with it

1287
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:33,400
and I was like a badass child when I was little.

1288
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:35,400
I was like running around jumping

1289
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,400
on the bed and like on the board and like

1290
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:39,400
do a flips and shit and then I flipped.

1291
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:41,400
I slipped and I felt

1292
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:43,400
in between on the bed and right in between my legs.

1293
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,400
No, that shit hurt.

1294
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:47,400
Like I'm like, I thought

1295
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,400
I broke bone. I thought I cracked bone.

1296
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,400
Does that mean my pussy can take more of a powder than yours?

1297
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:53,400
I don't know, bro.

1298
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,400
There's no fucking way

1299
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:57,400
that you didn't feel shit.

1300
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,400
There's no way. The only time

1301
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:01,400
it hurt.

1302
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:03,400
The only time it's hurt for me,

1303
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:05,400
nobody really does that a lot.

1304
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,400
The only time it's hurt for me

1305
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:09,400
I draw.

1306
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:11,400
This is educational.

1307
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:13,400
So like, you know,

1308
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,400
there's like the pubic bone like up here

1309
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,400
or it's like your lippies

1310
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:19,400
are right there.

1311
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:21,400
It's like this bone. I had there was a girl

1312
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,400
that like this looks like a bush.

1313
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:25,400
There was a girl

1314
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:27,400
to cut this out like right there.

1315
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:29,400
There was a girl that

1316
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,400
swung her music case

1317
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:33,400
that had like her clarinet or something and it hit me

1318
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:35,400
right at the bone.

1319
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:37,400
This is what it nuked.

1320
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,400
And I'm just cutting this out. Don't worry about it.

1321
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:41,400
And it hurt so bad.

1322
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:43,400
Like that was the only time it was like on the tip

1323
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,400
like the bone

1324
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:47,400
like right where your pussy lips start

1325
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:49,400
to happen. That really, that really hurt.

1326
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:51,400
Yeah.

1327
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:53,400
I've bruised that before like going too hard

1328
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:55,400
but otherwise

1329
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,400
like

1330
02:12:57,400 --> 02:12:59,400
you know like

1331
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:01,400
anyways

1332
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:03,400
I'm Bob Ross.

1333
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,400
These are educational drawings.

1334
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:07,400
The Vaude

1335
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:09,400
is not 100% dead. We can cut it.

1336
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,400
We can edit the Vaude guys.

1337
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,400
Archive bros, where are you at?

1338
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:15,400
I'm tempted to leave it

1339
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:17,400
in to be honest. I don't think YouTube will pick it up.

1340
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,400
I tested it now.

1341
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:23,400
I'm gonna test it.

1342
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:25,400
I'm gonna fucking test it.

1343
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,400
Because I didn't smash your pass with Tomo yesterday

1344
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:29,400
and we said some foul language.

1345
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:31,400
We just said some foul shit.

1346
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:33,400
Oh my god.

1347
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:35,400
And we were fine.

1348
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:37,400
Oh my god.

1349
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:39,400
I can't.

1350
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:41,400
Being in that

1351
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,400
you like I haven't used that

1352
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:45,400
like

1353
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,400
my vocal range changes depending on my mood

1354
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:49,400
right.

1355
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:51,400
How I feel

1356
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,400
my vocal range changes.

1357
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:55,400
I haven't been in that vocal range in so long.

1358
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:57,400
My throat fucking hurts.

1359
02:13:57,400 --> 02:13:59,400
I'm so sorry.

1360
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:01,400
Oh my god.

1361
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,400
I was laughing too hard in high pitch.

1362
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:05,400
I haven't laughed that hard

1363
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:07,400
forever.

1364
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:09,400
My throat is fucking fucked.

1365
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:11,400
Help.

1366
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:13,400
I'm so sorry.

1367
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:15,400
Did you need a break?

1368
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:17,400
Did you want to end stream?

1369
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,400
No.

1370
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:21,400
It's fine.

1371
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:23,400
We can play one more.

1372
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,400
Thank you madam.

1373
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:27,400
Educational lecture.

1374
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:29,400
Body education.

1375
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:31,400
Thank you.

1376
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:33,400
Oh thank you for the five gifted boy.

1377
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:35,400
I missed that one.

1378
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,400
Yeah everyone gave me gifted.

1379
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:39,400
I wanted to go through them but you guys send them

1380
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,400
like back to back to back and Chibi was talking.

1381
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:43,400
She just told me to shut up.

1382
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:45,400
No.

1383
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:47,400
Thank you guys after.

1384
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,400
Thank you all the people that were gifted.

1385
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:51,400
Yeah.

1386
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:53,400
What did you want?

1387
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,400
What did you thank the people that gifted them?

1388
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,400
Because the people who were gifted.

1389
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:59,400
Oh I don't have gifts.

1390
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,400
I don't have gifts.

1391
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,400
Remember I'm not monetized.

1392
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:05,400
I know but I mean like on my stream.

1393
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:07,400
Wait. Oh I meant mine.

1394
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:09,400
Oh I get you okay.

1395
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,400
Cause I'm like wait you're gonna go

1396
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,400
to my stream and read out the gifts.

1397
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:15,400
No.

1398
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:17,400
No.

1399
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,400
No.

1400
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:21,400
I'm happy you guys liked

1401
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:23,400
the educational portion of the stream.

1402
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:25,400
Um.

1403
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:27,400
I'll be good rid of this.

1404
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,400
It was very educational.

1405
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:31,400
Definitely.

1406
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:33,400
We should do a deep dive

1407
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:35,400
into drawing anatomy.

1408
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,400
Maybe I'll learn how to draw.

1409
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:39,400
Cause I can't draw bodies like Azir can't.

1410
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:41,400
Uh.

1411
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:43,400
I don't really try.

1412
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:45,400
I don't know.

1413
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:47,400
She doesn't even try everybody.

1414
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,400
Look.

1415
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:51,400
I'm not trying to.

1416
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:53,400
I'm like literally don't try.

1417
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:55,400
Everything I draw is literally the night before.

1418
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:57,400
Like not even like an hour or two hours

1419
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:59,400
before I post it.

1420
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:01,400
I'm like this is a great idea.

1421
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,400
I'll be honest.

1422
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:05,400
I think it looks bad.

1423
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:07,400
I don't know what you mean.

1424
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:09,400
What do you mean?

1425
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:11,400
I do have a question.

1426
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,400
I did some art.

1427
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,400
On your other account.

1428
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:17,400
Yeah.

1429
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,400
It was quite creamy.

1430
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:21,400
What was laying?

1431
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:23,400
Creamy.

1432
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:25,400
Creamy.

1433
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:27,400
What was laying in the cream?

1434
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,400
There was like a ball.

1435
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:31,400
My tail.

1436
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:33,400
Wait.

1437
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:35,400
Your tail popped off and.

1438
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:37,400
It popped off.

1439
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:39,400
No.

1440
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:41,400
My tail popped off.

1441
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:43,400
Wait a second.

1442
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:45,400
Lay directly on your tail.

1443
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:47,400
So it would like hold on.

1444
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:49,400
I need to go hold on.

1445
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:51,400
I'm going to send you the picture of the one that I'm talking about.

1446
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:53,400
I know.

1447
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:55,400
I know.

1448
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:57,400
Yes.

1449
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:59,400
Wait.

1450
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:01,400
I'm confused.

1451
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:03,400
You see the color.

1452
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:05,400
I know.

1453
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:07,400
I saw that.

1454
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:09,400
It was like my tail popped off.

1455
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,400
It was just like are you gay best?

1456
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:13,400
It was just like are you gay best?

1457
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:15,400
It was just like are you gay best?

1458
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:17,400
It was just like are you gay best?

1459
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:19,400
It was just like are you gay best?

1460
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:21,400
Steve is going to kill me.

1461
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:23,400
I'm going to laugh too hard.

1462
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:25,400
I'm going to perish.

1463
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:27,400
please don't die.

1464
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,400
Hold on.

1465
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,400
I'm going to your account right now.

1466
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:33,400
I'm going to stare at this.

1467
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:35,400
First I see some gorgeous legs.

1468
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:40,400
Then we're gonna go to someplace else.

1469
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:45,400
Oh, that is your tail!

1470
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:48,400
It's my tail!

1471
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:53,400
I thought your tail would be higher up!

1472
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:59,400
That was it again! I was just shocked! We are so sorry for her!

1473
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:08,400
My tail is on my tailbone, so I thought it would be behind.

1474
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:10,400
Yeah, but it was mine!

1475
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:12,400
How was your tail reaching all the way?

1476
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:18,400
You lay on your back and if you pull your legs up, your tailbone sticks out.

1477
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:22,400
Your tail would be out of your ass!

1478
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:29,400
I thought it was just a pile of cream and there was just a small bleeding.

1479
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:35,400
I'm like, oh, she gave birth!

1480
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:38,400
My tail is a little longer than yours.

1481
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:41,400
I'm not good with anatomy or perspective.

1482
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:44,400
Oh no!

1483
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:48,400
Now I'm just staring at this photo because it's very nice.

1484
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:51,400
Now that I know what it's supposed to look like.

1485
02:18:51,400 --> 02:19:04,400
I'm so sorry!

1486
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:11,400
I'm not doing it on purpose! I thought it was a pregnancy kink thing!

1487
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:15,400
Oh my God!

1488
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:18,400
This is my gen mate, everybody. This is my gen mate.

1489
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:24,400
See, somebody eyes agreed with me in my chat, so...

1490
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:27,400
You both need to get your eyes checked!

1491
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:31,400
I'm wearing glasses!

1492
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:41,400
Get new glasses! Even I don't have my glasses on!

1493
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:45,400
Okay, let's play one more.

1494
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:51,400
We got two spots left, everybody wants to join.

1495
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:55,400
Three spots now, three spots.

1496
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:56,400
Get your glasses.

1497
02:19:56,400 --> 02:19:58,400
I have to make these people leave me!

1498
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:01,400
She's like, no thank you.

1499
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:03,400
She doesn't even know where stuff is.

1500
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:07,400
I thought it was a rabbit spot!

1501
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:12,400
Oh my God.

1502
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:15,400
I'm sorry.

1503
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:23,400
Am I going to be bullied for this?

1504
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:25,400
I just don't remember things.

1505
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:28,400
I'm not good at remembering where things are and where they're supposed to go.

1506
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:34,400
That's literally one of my issues with my mental Illinois.

1507
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:36,400
The Dom has become a...

1508
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:38,400
No!

1509
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,400
Oh honey, don't get it twisted.

1510
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:44,400
Okay, I'll still put you in your fucking place, dude.

1511
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:48,400
Now I know where to kick properly!

1512
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:52,400
I'm so sorry if she be was how allowed.

1513
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:54,400
I know I got real close to my mic.

1514
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,400
Yes!

1515
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:59,400
I had you turned up on the score.

1516
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:01,400
I had you like maxed out, like...

1517
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:04,400
Because I couldn't hear you earlier, but I forgot to turn you down.

1518
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:09,400
I'll still be dumbed, but man, that was unfortunate to hear.

1519
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:14,400
Shut the fuck up.

1520
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:21,400
You know where to kick for now until I forget again.

1521
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:25,400
This is not the loot company, this is the...

1522
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:27,400
It's fine, she be yours.

1523
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:30,400
It's okay.

1524
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:33,400
No.

1525
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:38,400
I don't even know, I can't even defend myself.

1526
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:41,400
She be is over for you.

1527
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:43,400
I was right, I was right.

1528
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:48,400
I told you for day one when she be was saying all the things.

1529
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:53,400
I was like, no, this is the girl that's going to get everyone in trouble.

1530
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:57,400
She's gonna be in trouble with you, I can see it now.

1531
02:21:57,400 --> 02:22:00,400
Trouble make her...

1532
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:05,400
She's gonna say like the craziest things.

1533
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:08,400
You're wrong.

1534
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:14,400
You know, you're not wrong.

1535
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:23,400
I was still even with me saying that, I was still surprised by this shit you'll be saying.

1536
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:25,400
I can't get up.

1537
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:27,400
What is she saying?

1538
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:30,400
I can't get up.

1539
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:34,400
I'm falling and I can't get up.

1540
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:36,400
Oh shit.

1541
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:44,400
Oh, okay, there's water.

1542
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:47,400
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1543
02:22:47,400 --> 02:23:00,400
Oh shit.

1544
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:02,400
Oh no.

1545
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:07,400
Yeah, I'm not gonna make it.

1546
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:13,400
Oh shit.

1547
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:19,400
Forget I can dive.

1548
02:23:19,400 --> 02:23:21,400
Oh fuck.

1549
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:23,400
Ow.

1550
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:26,400
Oh my god.

1551
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:29,400
I'm literally like last.

1552
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:31,400
I made it.

1553
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:33,400
I'm amazing.

1554
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:39,400
I was like...

1555
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:41,400
No.

1556
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:43,400
She didn't make it.

1557
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:45,400
Rest in peace.

1558
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:47,400
Rest in peace?

1559
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:51,400
I'm resting in peace right now.

1560
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:54,400
Resting in peace?

1561
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:57,400
Resting in peace isn't in peace.

1562
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:02,400
In peace.

1563
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,400
Totally fair.

1564
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:06,400
I deserve this.

1565
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:11,400
I'm responding to my feet.

1566
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:15,400
It's not my fault that men are built weird, okay?

1567
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:19,400
I'm gonna draw a sheebie.

1568
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:23,400
Discovering a dick for the first time.

1569
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:24,400
How did you know?

1570
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:26,400
How did you know my plan?

1571
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,400
How did you know?

1572
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:30,400
That was my plan.

1573
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:33,400
What is this?

1574
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:38,400
Weeeeee.

1575
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:44,400
Ow.

1576
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:50,400
For not having our animal men are freaks of nature.

1577
02:24:50,400 --> 02:25:03,400
That's why they get dombed.

1578
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:11,400
Actually no, the male and the female form are quite beautiful.

1579
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:13,400
I just forget what they...

1580
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:15,400
Wait, is that the one way?

1581
02:25:15,400 --> 02:25:17,400
What if we go this way?

1582
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:19,400
Don't get it twisted.

1583
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:21,400
I don't remember.

1584
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:23,400
I'm not gonna make it.

1585
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:28,400
It's because I fell.

1586
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:30,400
I'm happy nobody heard me say that.

1587
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:32,400
What'd you say?

1588
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:33,400
Don't worry about it.

1589
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:35,400
What'd she say?

1590
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:36,400
What'd she say?

1591
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:38,400
What'd she say?

1592
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:40,400
What'd she say?

1593
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:45,400
What'd you say?

1594
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:51,400
I forget what my own looks like.

1595
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:53,400
Like that ass?

1596
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:56,400
Yeah, I'm not looking at it all the time.

1597
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,400
That ass?

1598
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:00,400
What if you get something?

1599
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:02,400
What if there's a mole?

1600
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:08,400
Actually, somebody made me really look the other day.

1601
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:10,400
Because they're like, do you have any moles?

1602
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:12,400
And I was like, oh, I do.

1603
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:14,400
I have one.

1604
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:19,400
I realized I actually have three beauty marks there.

1605
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,400
I have one.

1606
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:25,400
Oh, let me pull up a diagram.

1607
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:27,400
Oh, you're gonna actually give them a diagram?

1608
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:29,400
I'm just gonna say where it is.

1609
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:30,400
I can't say.

1610
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:32,400
It's hard to describe where they are.

1611
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:36,400
Mine is on my lip.

1612
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:38,400
Your lip?

1613
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:39,400
I have...

1614
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:41,400
I might have to look again.

1615
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:43,400
On the inside of my lip.

1616
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:49,400
I have one on the outside, and then one on the inside.

1617
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:52,400
This again.

1618
02:26:52,400 --> 02:27:00,400
I have to look again, because I forget.

1619
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:02,400
Capture?

1620
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:03,400
Perfect.

1621
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:06,400
Okay, let me take a peek.

1622
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,400
Okay.

1623
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:11,400
I have one right there.

1624
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:14,400
One right there, and one right...

1625
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:16,400
Wait.

1626
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:18,400
Wait.

1627
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:21,400
Okay.

1628
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:23,400
All right.

1629
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:24,400
I'm ready.

1630
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:30,400
Okay, so how do I make this thicker?

1631
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:36,400
Make the brush thicker.

1632
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:42,400
Yeah.

1633
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:45,400
Get distracted, get distracted, get distracted.

1634
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:46,400
Very much.

1635
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:49,400
Get distracted, get distracted, get distracted.

1636
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:52,400
I have one on the inside of my lip.

1637
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:53,400
Eggplant.

1638
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:54,400
I need help.

1639
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,400
One right there.

1640
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:58,400
One right there.

1641
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:00,400
Go bullet person.

1642
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:16,400
It's a duck.

1643
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:29,400
What the fuck are you doing?

1644
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:31,400
I'm not...

1645
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,400
It was very abstract.

1646
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:39,400
You guys couldn't tell what I was talking about.

1647
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:41,400
It's a duck.

1648
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:43,400
Yeah, she's just quacking.

1649
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:48,400
I was drawing my interpretation of a duck.

1650
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:50,400
Azir is quacking.

1651
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:52,400
I'm drawing my...

1652
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:58,400
My beauty marks.

1653
02:28:59,400 --> 02:29:01,400
That's everyone's phone.

1654
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:04,400
The phone will be fine.

1655
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:05,400
It's fine.

1656
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:06,400
Relax.

1657
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:07,400
Oh!

1658
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:09,400
Is that a chili dog?

1659
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:11,400
Oh, yeah.

1660
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:13,400
It's a chili dog.

1661
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:15,400
Look at that.

1662
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:17,400
Oh.

1663
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:19,400
There was two of them.

1664
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:22,400
Girl, are you good?

1665
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:23,400
It's a chili dog.

1666
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:24,400
Look at that.

1667
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:27,400
Oh.

1668
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:29,400
There was two of them.

1669
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:30,400
There are two.

1670
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:32,400
They're just like hot dogs, though.

1671
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:34,400
It's really grilled.

1672
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:36,400
Oh, which is really grilled.

1673
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:38,400
That's not sauce on it.

1674
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:40,400
They sauce in?

1675
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:42,400
They lost in the sauce?

1676
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:44,400
I don't know why I said sauce.

1677
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:56,400
They time Azir is a different breed.

1678
02:29:56,400 --> 02:30:02,400
Yeah, you guys get me at night when I have like no energy.

1679
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:07,400
This is like how she is in all of our collabs in our meetings.

1680
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:09,400
This is Azir.

1681
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:12,400
It's a night she's chilling.

1682
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:14,400
Azir really likes chili dogs.

1683
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:16,400
She definitely loves wieners.

1684
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:18,400
That's for sure.

1685
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:21,400
I want to touch the eggplant.

1686
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:24,400
Eggplants really taste the other good plants.

1687
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:25,400
Is it?

1688
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:26,400
Really?

1689
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:27,400
I don't know.

1690
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:29,400
I've never had an eggplant before.

1691
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:31,400
The texture isn't for everybody.

1692
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:32,400
I changed my mind.

1693
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:34,400
I don't want to eat it.

1694
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:36,400
Yeah, I don't know if you would like it.

1695
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:38,400
At least like eggplant farm.

1696
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:40,400
I like eggplant farm.

1697
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:42,400
Maybe.

1698
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:45,400
I'm very picky with some things that I eat.

1699
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:47,400
My throat is so fucked.

1700
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:49,400
I'm so sorry.

1701
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:51,400
Because aren't you streaming after this?

1702
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:53,400
Yeah.

1703
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:00,400
Put some salt on it.

1704
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,400
Don't worry, well I'm after this and you can rest.

1705
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:08,400
She needs some milk.

1706
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:10,400
She needs some milk.

1707
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:12,400
It's undercat.

1708
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:14,400
Fucking thing.

1709
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:16,400
Or key man rather.

1710
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:18,400
That's actually pretty cool.

1711
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:20,400
It is actually.

1712
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,400
It's kind of hardcore.

1713
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:24,400
Oh ghost cat, congratulations.

1714
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:26,400
Congratulations.

1715
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:33,400
It was so fun playing with everybody.

1716
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:38,400
And I'm glad

1717
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:41,400
you got to learn a little more about me.

1718
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:48,400
It's so funny.

1719
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,400
It's so funny because

1720
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:52,400
you were making fun of me.

1721
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:54,400
You are making fun of me

1722
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:56,400
earlier.

1723
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:58,400
I'm going to tease Azura.

1724
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:00,400
I'm going to tease Azura.

1725
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:02,400
I'm going to tell everybody what happened.

1726
02:32:04,400 --> 02:32:06,400
I said, do you want to call me

1727
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:08,400
50 minutes before?

1728
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:10,400
And she was like, sure we can do that.

1729
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:12,400
And I said, sweet.

1730
02:32:12,400 --> 02:32:14,400
And she was like, how do you want to play using vtube studio?

1731
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:16,400
And I said, I'm going to do

1732
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:18,400
foodie tech because it's easier on my computer.

1733
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:20,400
And then Azura says, okay.

1734
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:22,400
And I said, is that okay with you?

1735
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:24,400
I can still pop open studio,

1736
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:26,400
like have her model in it.

1737
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:28,400
So we had a boyfriend model.

1738
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:30,400
If you think it would be better.

1739
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:32,400
Azura said, I don't mind either way.

1740
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:34,400
But are you not using studio during live?

1741
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:36,400
And I said, I'd use studio for my model.

1742
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:38,400
Yes. And she's like, oh, okay.

1743
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:40,400
I was confused. I thought everybody use a PNG.

1744
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:42,400
And I said, no, use foodie tech

1745
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:44,400
for you. And then she said, oh,

1746
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:46,400
LMFAO.

1747
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:48,400
And I said, ellipses, Azura, ellipses,

1748
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:50,400
ellipses, ellipses.

1749
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:52,400
And then she said, oh, I'm sorry.

1750
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:54,400
And I said, I'm going to tease you for this. And she said, no.

1751
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:56,400
And then she said, style up off saying, don't do it.

1752
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:58,400
And that's the story.

1753
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:00,400
I have to fart.

1754
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:02,400
But she didn't say that.

1755
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:04,400
I didn't say that.

1756
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:06,400
Listening.

1757
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:08,400
Listening.

1758
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:10,400
I spread my teeth so you guys couldn't hear it.

1759
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:12,400
Oh.

1760
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:14,400
Oh, what the?

1761
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:16,400
What the hell?

1762
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,400
Oh, hi.

1763
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:20,400
Hi, welcome raiders.

1764
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:22,400
Hi.

1765
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,400
I don't know.

1766
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:26,400
I don't know.

1767
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:28,400
I don't know.

1768
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:30,400
I don't know.

1769
02:33:30,400 --> 02:33:32,400
I don't know.

1770
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:34,400
Let me look.

1771
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:36,400
Sorry.

1772
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:38,400
I can't tell.

1773
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:40,400
Because I can't see it.

1774
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:42,400
You highlight it.

1775
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:44,400
Can you highlight it?

1776
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:46,400
I have a chat very much

1777
02:33:46,400 --> 02:33:48,400
closed.

1778
02:33:48,400 --> 02:33:50,400
It is

1779
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:52,400
Shantarelle.

1780
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:54,400
Shantarelle.

1781
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:56,400
Shantarelle.

1782
02:33:56,400 --> 02:33:58,400
Shantarelle.

1783
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,400
Shantarelle.

1784
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:02,400
Shantarelle.

1785
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:04,400
I like your name.

1786
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,400
Welcome, raiders.

1787
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:08,400
Welcome, welcome.

1788
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:10,400
Thank you. You're doing great. Thank you.

1789
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:12,400
Yay.

1790
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:14,400
Yay.

1791
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:16,400
Yay.

1792
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:18,400
Yay.

1793
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:20,400
Yay.

1794
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:22,400
You won't get away with this, right?

1795
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:24,400
Whatever.

1796
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:26,400
Are you still streaming?

1797
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:28,400
Are you going to keep streaming?

1798
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:30,400
I think.

1799
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:32,400
I don't know.

1800
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:34,400
Should I end it?

1801
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:36,400
I think I'm going to end it and then start again.

1802
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:38,400
I'm going to just chat for a little bit at the end.

1803
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:40,400
With the tatters.

1804
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:42,400
And stuff.

1805
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:44,400
I'll chat with you guys too.

1806
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:46,400
Well, I mean like my chat.

1807
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,400
And I'll say bye.

1808
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:50,400
Thank you for playing with me.

1809
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:52,400
It was so fun.

1810
02:34:52,400 --> 02:34:54,400
It was so fun.

1811
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:56,400
Bye bye, cute-bye.

1812
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:58,400
Bye bye.

1813
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:10,400
Do you guys hate me?

1814
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:16,400
Listen, everybody forgets

1815
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:18,400
so that you used to be cute and funny

1816
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:20,400
in my past life.

1817
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:33,400
And I'm, I might be a little innocent and forgetful when it comes to male and female

1818
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:46,600
bodies but I'm still here madam and you can't forget that I am the one in

1819
02:35:46,600 --> 02:36:00,760
control. I, I am close to graduating my DOM class. I am learning

1820
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:12,320
expeditiously. I am still in charge. Isn't it hotter though? Isn't it hotter that you

1821
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:29,880
have such a silly girl doing that to you? Doesn't it just tickle you a little bit?

1822
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:43,040
It's a bit tantalizing is it not? Yeah, everybody has to learn somewhere.

1823
02:36:43,040 --> 02:37:02,400
The gap is getting wider each day. So you can't raise that? Yes I can. Bend over, spread your

1824
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:19,560
cheeks. I'm going in with no lube. If you scream, we repeat the process tomorrow. If you stay

1825
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:44,640
quiet, I'll let you finish. The game and Minecraft of course. Just as the fall guys beat. Oh, don't

1826
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:56,880
you want to flick that bean though? I wanna be the very best that no one ever was. To

1827
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:07,640
catch them is my real quest. To train my bitches. My harem is my cause. I will travel across

1828
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:15,880
the land. Searching far and wide. Something, something, something, something. The dominatrix

1829
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:25,080
that's inside. Madame Chibi. Gonna tame a mong. It's so true. She's gonna put her strap

1830
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:52,640
in you. She fucks me. And my balls are blue. Dom Chibi. Chibi Dom. The boss is not

1831
02:38:52,640 --> 02:39:16,800
obsessed. It's him. I love it here. Gotta tame a mong. Chibi Dom. Take all that juice

1832
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:31,120
out of you. What do you mean? Chibi streams are one of the, why would the bod is fine?

1833
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:51,720
The bod is fine. This is the one I call my Oshi. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I'm your Oshi.

1834
02:39:51,720 --> 02:40:02,960
My voice goes very high when I'm embarrassed and excited. Minas are a lot alike in that

1835
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:15,400
way that our voices change. Actually, no, I don't want to do that. I'll tame it. Call

1836
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:29,360
me Oshi. No. I'm so sorry. You guys have bad taste in women. I have to work on that,

1837
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:38,400
I guess. I think, I think Strawnee would love that if I told her. I already pitched a couple

1838
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:45,840
ideas to her about some content that I want to do consistently. And I'm going to start

1839
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:51,520
planning for them. There's two segments I want to start doing because I think there's a niche

1840
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:56,240
for them. I don't know if there'll be honestly a niche for one of them amongst men, but I

1841
02:40:56,240 --> 02:41:03,200
think you guys would still enjoy it. I want to do like a book reading club podcast of

1842
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:09,520
Smuddy Books. I was thinking about it before, and that's why I like when Amy's like, oh,

1843
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:12,280
I want to read this book. I'm just like, oh my God, please tell me because I want to do

1844
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:20,480
it with her. And then my friend Salem and Strawnee said it was fine. And fanfix. Yes,

1845
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:24,360
fanfix would be a thing. I'm going to do more. Don't worry, I'm still continuing fanfix

1846
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:33,000
next week. Yeah, I'm turning Salem into a Vtuber. I hope you guys are happy. I'm trying.

1847
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:39,120
I was supposed to go over her house today to see, to figure out a set up for a podcast.

1848
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:46,080
Because, but like, it's this is something we've wanted to do since for a couple years

1849
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:52,360
now me and me and Salem, but I'm trying. I'm helping her design her character, but she's

1850
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:58,400
not in Villalur. She's literally only going to live on my channel. She's not going to

1851
02:41:58,400 --> 02:42:02,240
be like social media or anything or be like her own entity. It's only going to be for

1852
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:08,600
a podcast. But I think it'll be super fun. What if Salem becomes a dominator? Oh, Salem's

1853
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:18,480
100% a sub. I'm sorry. No, she she is not Dom at all. She is 100%. She is the she is

1854
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:29,280
a bratty mess of Gaki type. 100%. She's short. I've choked her before as a joke in our store

1855
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:39,720
and she screamed and it was like R2D2 screaming. It was very funny. She's not my sub, no.

1856
02:42:39,720 --> 02:43:09,680
She's more of a pocket than me. I don't forget I said she was way more base than I am. I

1857
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:22,880
have to reel her in. She isn't even on the interwebs like that. Bad Omen's equal sub.

1858
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:33,320
Got it. Very great man though. Um, I think it'll be a recorded thing just because for

1859
02:43:33,320 --> 02:43:42,120
like safety. Strawdy set me to get stepped on. All right, hold on. Hold on just a moment.

1860
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:58,840
Prepare to be stepped. Thank you, Bob. Here are your stepies. Take a good with. My feet

1861
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:03,440
don't really like step from side to side like some models do, but I hope to get that at some

1862
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:09,320
point. My legs are so nice. Can we just talk about how nice my legs are? Imagine if this

1863
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:17,480
was my skin tone. I wouldn't even be mad about that. Or is there a skin tone? Steppy,

1864
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:28,640
okay, I need you to stretch out your neck and I'm gonna step on your windpipe. Oh yeah,

1865
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:35,480
it's look at my thighs. You guys don't see my thighs that often. Okay, come come and back to

1866
02:44:35,480 --> 02:44:44,320
her. Imagine if she'd be to step to their feet. Oh, I have heels so I could do that.

1867
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:59,520
How do you got the got thigh for the thighs? Everybody gets a treat. No, not my neck.

1868
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:14,520
But I hope you guys enjoyed. Sorry, I was looking at Azura's chat to see if she got off or not.

1869
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:24,920
I think you just did. Um, she's still talking. Um, because I wanted to see if I was going to read

1870
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:31,600
into her next one, but I don't know. I'm sorry for my behavior. If there's any bleeding hearts in

1871
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:47,000
the audience. Um, but sometimes I do misbehave and I do have no filter. Well, that's just how I am.

1872
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:58,600
Vaughn is not being edited. Vaughn is fine. Why not step on the ribs or solar plexus? I could

1873
02:45:58,600 --> 02:46:04,880
break your ribs if you want. I can just like pile of drive my ass into it. Be like, watch out,

1874
02:46:04,880 --> 02:46:18,680
watch out, and then just like fucking slam my ass down. Okay, I'm a little, a little embarrassed.

1875
02:46:19,280 --> 02:46:27,640
I got my way is strong right now. I'm feeling like, I'm feeling like I see I'm in my little space.

1876
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:35,040
I feel very cute and funny right now.

1877
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:56,000
But um, uh, I hope you guys had a good time. I'm gonna play Azura, uh, and I hope you have a good

1878
02:46:56,960 --> 02:47:06,920
night or day. And I'm gonna go hide away and I'm gonna go practice drawing. Because somebody got me a

1879
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:12,600
drawing tablet because I got a drawing tablet because I do want to practice drawing. So, uh,

1880
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:19,280
maybe I'll put up a drawing stream for next week. And you guys can all practice and what

1881
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:30,280
drawn out of me and fucking, you guys can laugh at me. Okay, I'll see ya. Stay for the raid. Bye.
