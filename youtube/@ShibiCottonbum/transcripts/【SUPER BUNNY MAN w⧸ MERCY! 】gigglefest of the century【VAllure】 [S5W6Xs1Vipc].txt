She's a scream of horror.
It's fine.
I'm going to get the carrot.
I'm not going to get the carrot.
Should we redo this level?
Yeah, you want to get the carrot?
I think it's past the portal.
We're going to try to get like the carrot.
All right, you're in front.
Don't kick me in the face.
OK, how do we get out of here without dropping?
I think, hold on, let me position myself.
I think I can kick you across.
Oh, shit, OK.
Just a moment.
Hold on, I'm almost there.
I'm so close.
OK, that's not going to work.
I need to flip.
It's fine.
It's fine.
I'm getting into position.
Yes, get into position.
Oh, damn it, that didn't work.
This is how I move around.
Did you want to do it again?
It's OK, we can try again.
All right, what if we just launch ourselves?
What if we just launch ourselves?
I'm going to.
What's happening?
Why are you planking?
I thought I was going to fall.
All right, what if I just got a scooch?
Nope, nope.
No, sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I killed her.
I killed her.
I'm so sorry.
I hate you too.
Oh.
I'm an acrobat.
As you say, anything you say.
Yandere, queen.
Oh, wait, hold on.
Let me just.
It works.
All right, I believe in you, Marcy.
No, Marcy.
It's fine, it's fine.
Damn it.
Next level.
Sure.
It's only going to get harder from here, girly pop.
It's OK.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, it's a little gap.
All right, I think.
Oh, don't kill yourself.
OK, OK.
Can you?
All right.
How do I kick again?
Yeah.
Damn it.
You got to jump over that.
Nice.
You got this.
You got this.
You got this.
Oh, so carefully.
Do you remember how to grab?
I left a button.
Yes.
You got it.
Oh, yes, queen.
Flip to victory.
Oh, you did it.
Nice job.
Oh, my god.
Why does it say we didn't get the carrot?
It said I got the carrot.
Oh, I just don't count.
Yeah.
Is it behind us?
Sorry.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
It's not.
All right, it's fine.
Acrobatics, acrobatics, acrobatics.
Why am I holding on to you?
Because we need each other.
Yeah.
Imagine you could jump like this.
Let's see.
Mercy carry.
I don't think so.
No.
All right, we can also help each other over the gaps.
Hold on.
I'll be there shortly.
One moment.
If I flip.
There we go.
See, now we're a little bit longer,
so we can flip over the gap.
Oh.
Yeah, so you got to rotate.
Perfect.
We are speed.
I got you.
Don't worry.
We are speed.
We are.
Wait, where's the carrot?
Where's the carrot?
It's back there.
No, Mercy.
Is it level?
OK.
Mercy's like, I'm not even going to bother going
for the carrot.
What's that place?
I don't know.
Why don't you find out?
You got it?
Oh, hello.
Hold on.
I need you.
You need?
Oh, fuck.
She just took me.
I just got kidnapped.
Please do not throw me to my death, sister.
Let's go.
All right.
I need to hold on to me because I
want to be able to cross this gap.
How do I do this?
It's a great question.
Perfect.
All right.
Wow.
We are a wheel.
We are the first wheel invented.
Oh, no, stop.
We were not going to make that.
OK, we have to jump over.
Mercy, you got to go first.
You're in front.
I got to be first.
No, yeah, you got to go.
Oh, god.
You got this.
Yes.
Yes, queen.
All right.
I'll be there in a moment.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Nice.
We're such gods at this.
Wow.
Oh, shit.
I'm actually I'm surprised at how well we're doing.
Oh, oh, hold on.
Oh, don't die.
Oh, nice job.
Impressive.
All right.
Oh, oh, you got this.
Oh, nice, nice, straight leg.
Save.
Carrot.
You want to get it this time here?
I accidentally jumped backwards, so it's all used.
I'll try my best.
Oh, no, I had seltzer water and I need to burp.
I'm stuck.
I got you.
Oh, yeah, you can take it.
I'm sorry.
I took the carrot, not you.
It's OK.
I just got to get it out.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm going backwards.
Oh, what's happening?
Oh, OK, I'm fine.
We're good.
No, mercy, please.
Acquired.
Wait, you dropped the carrot.
No, I didn't.
Oh, never mind.
Oh, yeah, sometimes for this game, it's like,
Lilly, NC is really weird.
Sometimes you'll fly off the screen and then come back.
Oh, I'm being taken with.
Oh, no longer.
Ah!
Oh, I'm fine.
It's OK, I'm good.
With the carrots up there, I think.
I know.
It's fine.
Hwa.
Yeah.
Wait, where is the hole?
Where is the hole?
OK, it's OK.
Just a flesh wound.
Just a little flesh wound.
It's fine.
Why is your blood like that?
I don't know.
Oh, you just, it's your good.
This thing, I just got your little toesies.
It's got a little toesies.
I'm going to hold on to you.
What?
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
You left me for dead!
I'm so sorry!
You left me for dead!
I killed her!
I killed her!
I killed my daddy!
I'm so sorry!
I'm horrible!
Give me!
Give me a kiss in here!
I'm so sorry!
Wait, now what?
I'm just stuck!
I'm impaled!
Wait, move?
Are you not dead?
Why are you here?
Why are you fucking dead?
Wait, press the X button.
Because it should have, it should have,
restocked it by now if you died.
All right, go back to the medial to restart this one.
Let's pretend this never happened.
Number seven?
Yeah, I think it was number seven.
The senpais are raging.
I'm so sorry, senpais.
They're okay.
Okay, I scared myself.
All right, you got this, Mercy.
You can jump across, I believe in you.
Oh, yeah, the tree gets in the way a little bit.
You might have to lean forward.
You might have to like tilt like this and then jump.
Oh, uh, I'm in a pickle.
Never mind.
Avenge me!
It's fine, I'm just gonna swing.
No, Mercy, why?
Why?
You're not gonna go!
I wasn't about to let you die, Comrade.
Thank you.
All right, okay, so it's fine, I'm just gonna...
Just gonna rock with it.
Pro strats.
Nice.
I almost got it, she's making momentum.
It doesn't matter, I'm probably gonna die on this, it's fine.
Let me just edge a little closer.
Oh my god, I am a master.
Hold on, I'm gonna throw this carrot down to you.
Okay.
Where'd I fucking go?
Oh, we gotta go back.
Okay.
You can grab it, if you can grab it.
I grabbed you!
I can't do this!
I'm trying to push it towards you.
Okay, I got it.
No, I grabbed the ground.
Okay, now I got it.
Oh gosh, my cat just jumped on my desk, hold on.
Boomie, please.
Oh gosh, I couldn't see.
All right, lead the way.
Okay.
She's doing sit-ups.
Don't...
She'll be the backup for you.
Maybe just a little bit.
It's okay, you got this.
You don't got this, it's fine, it's fine.
I can't even kill myself properly.
Oh, there we go.
All you.
Oh shit.
I'm clapping.
It's like it's hurting you every flip.
All right, it's fine.
Oh wait, I'll backup.
Nice form, amazing.
I think I just started lightning outside my window.
Holy crap, that was bright.
Yes!
We didn't get the carrot.
But we got each other.
It wasn't about the destination, it was the journey.
What the fuck is this?
Oh, it's a little bouncy thing.
Can we bounce backwards?
You might have to bounce backwards on top of each other.
Quick.
That's hard.
I don't know if we can...
Can I like, grab onto your legies?
Maybe.
And then we have like, you know...
Extra jump, go for it.
I'm being smacked in the face by this thing.
Oh, okay, well...
Oh, I need your butt.
I'm trying so hard.
Oh wait, I got you.
Oh, hello.
This is quite romantic, to be honest.
I think we're both too heavy for this thing.
All right.
Man, that was romantic.
That was, we just held each other and bounced around.
We could have kissed.
We really wanted.
We could.
Kissed.
What did I need to do?
This bitch keeps on killing me.
Wait, I didn't tweet with that.
I was live.
Did you tweet with that you were live?
No, I didn't.
Okay, let's tweet that we're live.
There's thunder and lightning outside my house right now.
Are you gonna be okay?
I hope so.
Okay, I can tweet that right now.
Oops, been live for like 30 minutes already.
That's usually how it works for me.
I casually foregoer.
Live and hysterically laughing.
I keep accidentally killing Mercy.
Whoops.
Get in here.
Hold on.
I'm just gonna quote, retweet yours.
Alrighty.
There we go.
Where's my live button?
Perfect.
She be a murderer.
Hello, is there a nothing to see here?
Sometimes my BDSM play gets a little bit too rough.
Yeah, but you know, Mercy's not, you know,
unfamiliar with a little pain.
You got this, Mercy.
I'll back up.
You got this.
I believe in you.
I believe in you so hard.
Okay, it's fine.
Let me just...
Romeo and Juliet impaled through my ass.
I got impaled with this bike up my IF.
Alright, we're doing good so far.
Yeah.
Oh, well, I'm fine.
You're good.
I wonder if you could throw the carrot across.
Oh my God.
I'm so scared.
She's going to launch herself into the spikes.
Hi.
Mercy is durable indeed.
Oh my gosh.
She is straddling that carrot.
Try to grab the carrot.
I'll die with you, my queen.
When the gamer and the non-gamer play games.
Please.
Oh God.
I'm not a gamer.
What do you mean?
Ask the harem.
That's the one who played.
Alright.
It's my time to shine.
I will try my best.
Yes.
When I try my best, I mean go backwards.
I mean...
Never mind.
It's fine.
I was going to see if I could jump back over,
but it didn't really work out.
Well...
Join me in the embrace of death.
Together our bodies and blood intertwined.
69, baby.
Wee.
You're just doing flips in the air on my screen
for no reason.
Because you're not touching me.
Oh, I got you.
I got you.
Don't move.
I got you.
Don't move.
I will grab you.
Hold on.
Let me just figure this out.
I saw I had it.
I saw I had it.
I got you.
Let go.
I got you.
I am letting go.
Oh.
Perfect.
Okay.
I'll never let go.
What?
I'm trying to avoid the thingy.
If I need to.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Why did you get bit down?
I don't even...
I don't even know what happened there.
I think we should f the carrot on this one.
Wee.
If I randomly lose power,
it's because the raging thunderstorm
outside my house randomly.
Oh, I'll join you.
My legs spread.
Retty to accept death
in its purest form.
Like how did I badly mess up?
Fuck these trees.
You got it.
You got it.
All right.
Careful.
Perfect.
Okay, we got it.
All right.
Fuck that carrot.
Good.
Oh, I almost kicked you off.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
We're fine.
Okay.
We have one issue.
We do have an issue.
It's okay.
I'm going to grab you.
I'm going to grab you.
I got you.
Let go.
You got me?
Yeah.
I tried.
In the end, it didn't even matter.
Oh my God.
Mercy.
Mercy.
Oh, God.
Actually do that.
Perfect.
I'm keeping you with me.
Maybe I shouldn't have kept you with me.
I like how we're only on like the first area.
Yeah.
Okay.
Will we ever pass the gap of spikes?
No, but we will 69 while we die.
Like how bad are we at this game?
I'm pretty fucking bad.
I won't admit.
I don't even know how you can be good at this game though.
Nice.
Impressive.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, never mind.
I tried.
That was so close.
Oh, you want to hold on?
Yeah.
Well, I think we're stuck.
I am.
I am.
Let go.
Okay.
Perfect.
Okay.
Are you okay?
Are you fucking dead?
I'm dead.
Take my dead body with you.
Okay.
Wait, where were we supposed to go after that?
No, once one of us dies, we can't finish the level.
Oh.
So the thing disappears.
What the fuck is happening?
I was holding on.
Okay.
Perfect.
We're good.
I let go.
Nice.
All right.
Grab my ass.
Are you ready?
I grabbed your ass.
Yeah.
Are you ready?
Okay.
That was supposed to have the opposite effect.
I was hoping it would propel us forward, but it didn't.
I just saw a red flash of lightning outside my window.
That was pretty cool.
Red?
Yep.
Okay, I'm good.
Those back shots, I suppose.
I was going to grab you.
Well, now I have to grab you.
Hold on.
Please.
Please.
Sorry, my fat ass killed you.
I know I got dragon lightning outside of my house right now.
Dragon deez ball.
Sorry.
Anyways.
Oh, nice kick.
Nice kick.
If only we could get over this fucking line.
What was that?
Wait, I'm going to hold on and then you can kick off.
Ready?
Go.
Go as hard as you can.
Why do we go backwards when this happens?
Maybe if we aim the other way.
Can we blast off?
All right.
Well, I'm just going to take you with me.
I'll let go.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Hold on just a moment.
What if I...
Well, goodbye, carrot.
Do a cheeky...
Well, bye, me.
Yeah, there's a physics glitch where if you hold on to each other's feet, you can like
propel yourself across the game.
So I was trying to do that.
Will we ever get past this level?
I don't know.
We're going to try.
But...
I believe in us.
We'll do it.
Oh, sorry.
I fucked up your jump.
Let me back up.
Don't worry.
Whoa.
Impressive landing.
Impressive death even more so.
Wait, it showed that you died for me.
It didn't show that you died for me.
I think people on my side can see that you're just glitching profusely.
Oh, what the hell?
Wait, you're still alive?
Yeah.
Oh.
Nice.
Oh my God, Mercy.
You're so goaded.
Let's go.
Baby Chibi, you should take the carrot.
You want me to take the carrot?
All right.
Carrot acquired.
Mercy glitched the system.
Are you in front of me or behind me?
I'm in front of you.
Okay, I just want to make sure.
Because again, sometimes the game will reflect something else.
Oh, Mercy.
It's okay.
Oh my God, I got a carrot.
Okay.
All you got to do is make it across.
All you got to do is make it across.
Immediately dies.
It's fine.
It's fine.
We got this.
Yeah.
It's fine.
It's fine.
You're good.
All according to plan.
All according to plan.
All according to plan.
69 each time.
Every time in death, we just die in another sex position.
Very, very on character for us.
All right.
Let's go.
You got it.
Nice.
Amazing landing.
Can you back up?
I don't want to actually kick you and then make you fly across to your death.
All right.
You got to angle this.
Oh my fucking God.
This game is called super buddy man.
Hello.
I'm playing with Mercy.
Mercy, you can just die.
I died, Mercy.
I have to like literally wiggle my way down.
I know sometimes it gets increasingly hard to kill yourself in this game.
All right.
All right.
Oh my God.
Oh, okay.
Let me go back for you.
Hold on.
It's okay.
Goodbye.
No, I was coming back.
I literally could have grabbed her.
Size and pale self on spikes.
I'm sorry.
I truly am.
So sorry.
We're all in this together.
Watching you slowly sit up to grab the carrot is really funny.
Amazing execution.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh.
What?
I love this game.
It's just, you just have a bunch of laughs.
It's just the funniest thing ever.
It's like so gentle and then immediately hold on.
Can you back up?
Okay.
I'm good.
Oh.
Layed it on my face.
Oh, it's fine.
Amazing recovery.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
You get the carrot.
You want me to get the carrot?
I'll try.
And when I say I'll try, I mean I'll almost.
Okay.
All right.
Carrot acquired.
Carrot acquired.
You're still your hateful one.
Yes.
You recovered.
What the heck?
Let's fucking go.
I got the carrot.
I love you.
Glitch that.
I don't know.
Sometimes the game glitches.
It looks like you die, but you don't.
All right.
All right.
All we got to do, Mercy, is make it across.
Oh, Mercy.
Mercy.
Mercy, I need your help.
Mercy, I need you to grab me.
Mercy.
Mercy, please.
Mercy.
I'm trying my best.
Just a little hard to get over this.
I'm slowly sliding down.
I'm slowly sliding to my death.
Please.
Mercy, please.
Give me a second.
I got you.
Oh, thank God.
I thought I was a goner.
All right.
I'll give you some space.
Go on.
Give me a second.
Watch out for the red button.
Impressive.
Amazing.
She is the moment.
See what I mean by like that area is hard.
Yep.
All right.
See if you can jump over the button.
The thing is just on the other side.
You might want to lean the other way.
I'm going to lean the other way.
Not that way.
Oh, my God.
If I could just...
Okay.
All right.
Go to the portal.
Go to the portal.
Amazing.
All right.
Don't die.
God, I laughed so hard.
I nearly peached my shell.
I'm like, don't die.
And I just immediately fucking die.
All right.
I ruined that.
It's all right.
Okay.
Hold on.
I try.
Let me just kill myself.
Oh, hello.
Oh, perfect.
That worked.
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.
All right.
I fucked that carrot.
And me too, apparently.
I hate that.
This is going to become a rage game if you don't get past this level.
You're standing on my body.
Can I stand on your body?
What the hell?
Being a rabbit in the hoppy hills.
Playing games.
And shit.
Doing...
Yeah.
Shit.
Nice.
All right.
We're getting somewhere.
Oh, my God.
This might be it, guys.
This might be...
Oh, hello.
All right.
Actually, that might be helpful.
Perfect.
Oh, no.
Oh, nice job.
Wait, shit.
Okay.
Fuck the carrot.
We launched into orbit.
All right.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Oh.
Oh, what the hell?
Oh, at least there's not spikes here.
But there's spikes over there.
Am I dead?
I think you are.
How did you die?
I don't know.
Weird.
You, like, died off screen.
I died off screen.
I was like, where did I go?
Maybe you hit the spike and we didn't see.
I don't know.
Oh.
His face flooded into my ass.
It's okay.
Her ass smells nice.
I did take a shower today.
Amazing precision.
All right.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's not okay.
It's okay.
Almost first try.
We almost did it.
This is definitely an easier one.
I feel like we can do, though.
I think I can get the carrot.
Yeah.
Easy peasy.
Carrot acquired.
If I could, if I could just, can I, can I please just,
if I could, if I could just, please.
Oh, there we go.
All right, Mercy.
I'm just going to go to the portal.
If I can get over this thing.
I'm trying my best.
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard.
I was also like struggling.
So I don't blame you at all.
It's funny.
You're doing the stuff in like slow motion on my screen.
Okay.
There's something over here that should kill us.
It's a gap.
Oh my God.
You got it.
I was so careful.
I was so careful.
I'm like, you got the, why is every, I'm never speaking.
I'm always just like, oh, we got this.
And then we just immediately die.
All right.
Oh, how did I get down here?
We got each other.
Just the two of us.
All right.
You probably can grab that carrot.
Can I grab a carrot?
I'm just going to be doing fucking flips on this thing.
Why am I just in the air?
What is happening?
Help, grab me.
I got you.
Okay.
Oh wait, we actually should be able just to go over like this.
Yeah.
All right.
We should have done that.
Oh, let go.
Nice.
All right.
I got it.
I need to just scoop forward.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
I see the perfect.
All right.
So there's a little gap and you just got to jump across it.
I believe in you.
Maybe you should grab the carrot.
You want me to grab the carrot?
I'll grab the carrot.
Wait, maybe we should hold on to each other.
I don't, I think we have to jump this.
I don't think, if we try to flip, I think we'll just kill ourselves.
Oh, okay.
Unless you want, we can try.
What if we both grab the carrot?
If I could just, if I could please.
It's okay.
You can jump.
I won't even let me get it.
Okay.
Here, I'll grab it.
You may grab it.
I got it.
I shouldn't have grabbed the carrot.
I shouldn't have grabbed it.
Give me a second.
I want to see if there's like a possibility of us,
of me shooting.
Shooting your shot.
Yeah.
Across the thing.
Go for it.
No.
You just have to like, you have to angle like this.
So I'll show you.
You just got to, you just got to be like this.
You got to lean forward.
You got to balance, but go forward and then jump like that across.
Like that.
Here, let me just grab you.
Oh.
I let go.
All right.
Or I could kick you across that gap.
Give me a second.
There you go.
Well, welcome back.
Welcome back.
Give me a second.
I'll give you a second.
Or maybe more than one second.
Yeah.
I almost got it.
I got the carrot.
Let's make it over now.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Grappy.
You might be able to grab me.
Never mind.
Never mind.
It's so ogre.
It's so ogre.
Kick me in the face.
I can kick you in the face.
No.
Give me a second.
Give me a push me forward a little.
That was just dead silence as I just flew away to my death.
Let's go.
What is that?
That's the physics glitch.
Oh, hi kitty.
You need to get out of the way kitty.
I can't see kitty.
Oh my gosh.
I can't see myself.
Did I fucking die?
Oh, no.
I can't see myself either.
Oh, there I am.
Nice.
Let's go.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know how that happens.
That's all up to you now.
Take your time.
It's so ogre for me.
Take your time, Mercy.
Think it through.
Yep.
Yep.
Scooch a little bit closer.
And then when you're at a nice 45 degree angle,
you're going to want to tip in the forward direction.
So lean forward.
Go for it.
Yeah.
When you're at that like teetering point,
you're about to be on your hands and knees.
Give me it.
Take your time.
It's all right.
Just take your time.
Think, be careful.
Think it through.
You're fine.
You're good.
You're good.
You got this.
You're amazing, Mercy.
So amazing.
Just lean forward.
Just a tad.
Jump.
Yeah.
Mercy, let's go.
My girl.
That's my genome right there, everybody.
All right.
What's going on over here?
It's okay.
I just got a little bit of my toesies.
I'm good.
Be careful.
Nice.
I got you.
I got you.
Come back.
Don't worry.
I got you.
Yeah.
This is like a great team building exercise game.
We should grab each other's legs or something.
That's a good idea.
There you go.
It's okay.
We're getting somewhere.
This is working out perfectly.
What if I lean up?
Oh.
This is impressive.
I have amazing upper body strength.
Wait, see if you can flip over on my body.
Let go of me.
Oh, no, that didn't work.
No, that didn't work.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Actually, you might be able to use your legs to propel yourself up.
Yeah.
Use me like a springboard.
I'll hang out just like this.
You just kick me in the ass.
I'll try to grab your leggings.
Nice.
Oh, almost got it.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm trying to angle myself better.
Nice.
All right.
I'll figure this out.
How do we get you?
I am the bunny master.
Mercy, where'd you go?
I definitely got up here.
Where'd she go?
Down.
Down.
To my town.
We're going down, down in an early area.
Yeah, to my death.
I'm so strong.
Um.
Whoops.
I'm fine.
Just my hands.
Oh, sorry.
My cat's food is going off.
Oh, you're ready?
Me?
I'm like a bunny.
I flipped through.
Okay.
Let me just.
Yep.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
You want to lean a little bit more forward.
Perfect.
Nice.
Oh, yes.
Incredible.
All right.
Let me let's do what we did before.
Oh, you don't even need me.
We did it.
Oh my God.
We're pros.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
What happened?
I accidentally, when I tried to jump over the gap,
I kicked you back at the same time.
Hold on.
Let me go.
Your body is facing through the walls.
Oh, is it?
On your end, I'm on just on top.
Let me see if I can fix it by grabbing you.
Okay.
Hello.
I was such a pro for a second.
Oh, okay.
Oh, you can keep rolling like this.
Go forward.
Yeah.
Nice.
Wow.
We are so good at this.
Wait.
Oh, the carrots right there.
Is it a trap?
No, it's not.
We're good.
All right.
I'll grab the carrot.
If I could just.
The carrot.
The trap up here.
I got it.
Oh, nice.
All right.
I'll let you go first.
You got this.
Oh, definitely.
Oh.
Oh.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Oh, God.
So nervous.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
So nervous.
I'm so scared you're going to roll into the button.
Hold on.
Let me get back up there so you can see better.
Oh, nice job.
Nice job.
Okay.
No.
Let me let me join you.
All right.
Let me just.
You have to jump over because we're going to fuck each other for over there.
Nice recovery.
Oh, God.
I love watching mercy work.
Work out what she's going to do next.
Nice.
Oh, my gosh, mercy.
You're incredible.
Okay.
Now I just can't fuck this up.
Okay.
I'm good.
It's okay.
I stabbed my footsie a little bit, but it's fine.
Oh, all right.
What?
I grabbed it.
Oh, okay.
Oh, at least on my end I did.
But if it if it shows up for you, you can grab it.
You're you're in perpetual.
I already got in.
So the game's just glitching.
Oh, mercy.
Oh, mercy.
Please.
I'm sorry.
You did it.
Yay.
Wait, I did it.
On my side.
You did.
Yeah.
It still says unlocked.
Really?
Oh, we need to get more.
We needed to get more coins.
Okay.
Okay.
So let's go back to the menu and then we need one more coin.
So we should probably go get a carrot for one of them.
Number one looks like the easiest one.
Did we already grab that carrot?
No, wait.
Did we not?
Yeah.
Hold on.
Oh, we can do the time thing really fast.
Yeah.
Oh, we weren't.
We were already too slow.
All right.
Yeah.
Let's try that again.
Try that again.
The time one should be easier.
Go.
Fucking trees.
Never mind.
We start.
Go.
Fuck.
Damn it.
I was too slow.
Is six minutes good enough?
No, we gotta see how there's like a ghost.
You have to do it in five seconds.
What?
Yep.
Go.
Oh, I fucked up.
So you can see the little ghost bunny.
It's like it's a ghost race from Mario.
Can I please get up?
I've never done a ghost race for Mario before.
Mario Kart?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so slow.
No, no, no.
It's also it's like whoever's behind like the second person.
It's hard to get the momentum because you're already at a disadvantage.
Oh my gosh.
It's older.
Killing myself.
Farewell.
Well, just keep going.
Oh, it's a cat.
I never noticed that before.
Okay.
Maybe we should do a carrot one.
Yeah.
We didn't do four carrot.
Let's try that one.
Where's the carrot?
Was the carrot behind us or in front of us?
I never get.
Hold on.
No.
It was in front of us.
Oh yeah.
There's like, yeah, there's one that.
That was a trap.
I could just, if I could, perfect.
Butt to butt.
I got you.
Don't worry about it.
We got it.
Yeah.
Where's a carrot for this one?
Oh, it's down there.
Oh, that's an easy one to grab.
Yeah.
Let me try to grab it.
Yeah, you got that.
I'm going to go in the portal.
All you girly pop.
Nice use of feet.
Mercy's good with her feet, everybody.
Not so much your hands.
I think you're grabbing the floor.
Nice.
You got it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good job.
We did it.
Can I go menu now?
Yes.
Then you should be able to do that.
You should be able to go the next level.
Where is it?
That's a great question.
Go.
Why isn't it?
We have 15.
Why isn't it automatically unlocking it?
Do we have to do it again?
Do you want to try to do 10 again and hopefully it'll prompt it?
Maybe.
Yeah, let's try it.
I'm going to cry.
We don't have to.
It said 15 on the lock.
Why isn't it letting me move?
Oh, there you go.
Kick you across.
Kick you across.
Yes.
How does somebody do this in a short amount of time?
Very smartly.
I'll back up.
Give you some space, queen.
Yeah.
Amazing.
Flawless.
Yes.
Shit.
You know, sometimes you just get stuck in places like me getting stuck here right now.
Oh, grab my feet.
If you don't need the carrot, we already grabbed it before.
Grab my toesies.
Oh, god damn it.
I'm trying to grab your feet, queen.
Or grab any part of me.
You might be able to jump and grab.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't move.
Okay.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, god.
I'm going back.
I'm going to wait my turn.
I'll be taking this and saving it for later.
Thank you very much.
Perfect.
