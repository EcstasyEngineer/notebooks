00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,680

68
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
of glory

69
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,080
I thought I had a controller, but it doesn't seem to work. So

Thank you for saying bless you guys. I much appreciate. Thank you

I'm sure if you're capable though, why is this guy sound so familiar?

78
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,880
He does sound hot. Yeah, I was thinking he sounds like the guy from sucker punch

79
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,720
The old man that tells you wise things. I just watched that movie the other day. It sounds like him

80
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,960
I love sucker punch. That's like my all-time top 10 movies to watch every now and then same

81
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,320
It's like one of us like it's mid, but it's great. Yeah

82
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,080
I just like the really intense fight scenes when they switch over and I'm just like yeah

83
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,400
I did it for our members watch along everybody liked it. So I'm glad nice

84
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,640
All right, which way we going we have to communicate what is happening

85
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,680
All right, so we're just gonna go we're just we're just going go. All right

86
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Oh, okay

87
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
All right

88
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Yeah, yeah, we got this game

89
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,560
I was watching markiplier play this game with his friends

90
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:11,520
And they were literally called it just going no stopping. Thank you. Thank you. I was getting the strat

92
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
I

93
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm sorry. I did it on purpose

94
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,080
There you go. There you go. All right. I'm bringing up the rear

95
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Oh gosh, I don't want to follow

96
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,280
You can only pull up the person in front of you and behind you so

97
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
You can you guys in the middle can pull either way

98
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I

99
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,280
We're doing pretty good so far. Yeah, I think we're almost there

100
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,120
Oh my god, this will do they know

101
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,240
Little is never little. Oh my god. You guys almost pulled me off. All right. All right. We're good. We're good. Okay

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
Just walk straight just edge edge a little bit. Yeah. Yeah

103
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Nice. All right proceed

105
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,560
Apollo you are a queen to make our gameplay worse. Don't go forward. There's a hole there

106
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,160
We are one oiled one well oiled machine. We're literally just telepathically communicating right now

107
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Yeah, we're so in sync with everyone

108
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,480
It's like our it's like our periods are synced up. We're just like that. Uh, okay, so these will throw us across

109
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Uh, okay, uh, all right

110
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
I

111
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Was I'm warning them I watched

112
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,880
I'm the type of person that watches a lot of gameplay of something before I started a majority of the time

113
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,080
Now we got the we're doing fine. We're doing actually pretty good. I think

114
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
All right, go go

115
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400

117
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,440
Speed run moment. All right

118
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,120
Okay, this part. I can't speed run. I gotta go slow. Is there a way to not fall off?

119
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
Is there like minecraft where you hold shift? No

120
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,920
You could dash but shift is not yeah, you can sprint

121
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,600
Can you guys pull me sprinting is the right move? Yeah, I'd be pulled. Oh, I'll just be pulled to my

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
I just kind of move little by little

125
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,800
You can just use your mouse and just trace along it to be honest with you

126
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,920
Yeah, I would require gamer skills, which I do not have

127
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
All right, we got this

You think they're going to start making suggestive jokes probably

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,520
During the game or be too angry at each other for falling to care about anything else probably who knows

00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,640

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,380
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. One by one. One by one. I don't think that's a good idea.

251
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,900
I'm trying so hard to keep us up here.

252
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,300
I don't know why, but whenever I clicky to eat, it pushes me forward. I'm like,

253
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,100
damn, no, that's not what I'm trying to do. I think it does like frame click forward as like

254
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,660
for the animation, it kind of pushes you forward a little bit. All right. One by one,

255
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:44,780
falling like apples. Damn. Wait, wait. You didn't say go. I'm sorry.

00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,100
We look like really homeless power rangers right now.

260
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,940
Okay. Okay. I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay. All right. Let's not calm down and run. Just go for it.

This is fine. Look, speed run. Speed run. Which way do we go? Okay. I think it's this way.

Hell. Put them up. Put them up. Oh, shit. Hell. Come on. Come on. No. Oh, shit. Guys.

269
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:45,660
I'm going to try to swing. No, don't swing. Okay. Swing to the other side. Swing to the other side.

270
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,740
Go, go. Power bottles. Damn. You know you're not wrong.

271
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,540

Swing me over. Somebody pull up.

275
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,060
Does it help if I pull on a zero when you guys are all gone? Oh, god.

276
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,860
All right.

277
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,460
I keep falling on the other side.

278
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,060
What if you jumped to the other side? You want us to jump? All right.

279
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:04,620
A zero. We got this. Wait. We almost got Freya. All right. We'll just jump. Yeah. Okay. Three, two, one. Go.

280
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:13,820
All right. That's fine. That's fine. We're back. We're so back.

281
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:26,940
I was so busy laughing at Freya just running off that I couldn't. I didn't walk backwards to stop

282
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:36,380
Azura from flying off and I literally. I was trying to pull. I can't. I'm literally ori losing my voice

283
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,940
laughing and yelling.

284
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:49,500
You know what I mean? My moms are like, my moms are like, why? Why are you like this? Oh, we are so

285
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,940
not back. It's already hanging. We're just climbing a ladder.

286
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:03,500
What the fuck are you doing?

287
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:15,580
All right, Freya. We'll pull you up. Just like the other of you. You're just a stripper.

288
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,220
On the pole. All right. Azura, are you paying attention?

289
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:42,220
I was watching Azura. Azura. Azura. Azura, did you just connect? Oh, no. Azura, please.

290
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,740
Oh my god.

291
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:59,260
Fatal error. Oh my god. How do you have a cracked out PC and it just keeps shooting the bed?

292
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,900
A player has disconnected, respawning.

293
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,500
Wait, if she spawns back in, is she gonna appear with us? I think so. All right.

294
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,980
Azura, make as much progress as we can while she's gone.

295
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:29,180
She's dragging a pole. Damn, damn. I think my game is not framed properly on OPS.

296
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:41,260
Ah, my neck. My back. All right, I'm ready. Okay, ready? Three, two, one, go. Nice. Three,

297
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:48,380
two, one, go. That was pretty fast. Oh, we're not gonna get far.

298
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,540
Hello, fate, mythos. Thank you so much for the radio.

299
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:59,020
Trying to find her. She's being full time pretty and welcome to the change together challenge game.

300
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:05,820
Oh no, the hag Maxine. Her hag's there with that. I'm 56, so.

301
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,180
Well, I'm a thousand years old. Well, shit, you got me beat.

302
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,260
Wow, very cool. Three, two, oh wait. Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

303
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,420
It's her. Hello. Thank you so much for the sub. Thank you. Thank you.

304
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:40,220
Three, two, one. Blast off. Blast off, three, two, one. Blast off, three, two, one. Blast off.

305
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,740
All right. Okay, perfect. Wait, where the fuck are we going? This way.

306
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,660
Oh, in here. Oh, there's up here, up here. This way. Oh, it's another ladder. I'm being,

307
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,380
she's called on. Hold on. She's clipped through the wall. Come back around.

308
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:07,180
I can't move. There are chains turned silver. I swear they were black earlier.

309
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:15,100
Hello, everybody. I am Apollo. Thank you so much for following me. I am the goddess of music.

310
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:22,620
Oh, this one's gonna be a killer and a bitch. Sorry. No, no, you're fine. This is gonna be a killer.

311
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:30,620
Look at that. Oh, all right. We did it before when they were. All right. So we just got to run and jump.

312
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,380
Or die. That's all so good. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine.

313
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,900
Back off from those lasers. I'm crying.

314
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,860
I can't. Okay, I'm pulling. I'm pulling. Move back. Move back.

315
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,980
That actually helped us. I think we're still going. Yeah, we're still, we're still in it. We're still in it.

316
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,500
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. I'm back down. I'm up.

317
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,220
Oh, she's loop-jumped her. Wait, I wonder if this will be to our advantage. Can we jump?

318
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,940
Yeah. Let's try it. Let's try it. Ready? Ready? Let's go.

319
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:18,620
Let's get closer. Let's go. Jump. It's fine. We're good. We got the hack, bros.

320
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:29,260
We're just looping around. Wait, if Rhea jumps over. No, I just have to do good.

321
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:39,420
It's fine. I'm backing up. I was trying to run away from it.

322
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:47,020
The struggle is real. We're so math flying.

323
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:53,260
All right. I mean, we did do it like that though. Like run and jump. One on the side

324
00:48:54,060 --> 00:49:00,540
and then one in the middle. We've got this. Let's do it. Okay. Cool. Run. Run. Jump again.

325
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,460
No, if you sprint. I think we should run. I think we should run with it and then jump

326
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,580
over and let's come back. I agree, you're a strat.

327
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:11,880
Okay.

328
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,020
We're going to wait for it. Let's come back.

329
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:24,020
Oh, yeah, let's go.

330
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,020
Pro gamer.

331
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,020
Over here.

332
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,020
Okay.

333
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,020
Can we make this?

334
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,020
Yeah.

335
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,020
Oh, we did.

336
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,020
Okay.

337
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,020
Okay.

338
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,020
Just wait.

339
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,020
I hear it to the other jumping pad over there.

340
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,020
That's fine.

341
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,020
We got this.

342
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,020
Go.

343
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,020
What?

344
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,020
What?

345
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,020
What's happening?

346
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,020
What's happening?

347
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,020
Now we just got it.

348
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,020
Jumped in.

349
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,020
Come on.

350
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,020
Come on.

351
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,020
Come on.

352
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,020
Hail.

353
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,020
Hail.

354
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,020
Why?

355
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,020
Hail.

356
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,020
Oh, it has actually worked out.

357
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,020
Oh, don't let go.

358
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,020
I'm not letting go.

359
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,020
I'm not letting go.

360
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,020
I'm not letting go.

361
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,020
I'm not letting go.

362
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,020
I'm not letting go.

363
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,020
Wow.

364
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,020
This is a beautiful mountain gelmere.

365
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,020
You got Mordor over there.

366
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,020
Damn.

367
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,020
Where'd the guy go?

368
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,020
Oh, he's all the way down there.

369
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,020
Now look at him.

370
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,020
Oh, here's the screams of the dams.

371
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,020
Oh, there he is.

372
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,020
Fly, you fools.

373
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,020
No, fly more.

374
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,020
You can let go.

375
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,020
It'll automatically drop us.

376
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,020
Oh, the car.

377
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,020
Oh, we got a car.

378
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,020
Oh, well.

379
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
Allo.

380
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,020
Have fun.

381
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,020
I like how this guy always is just like,

382
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,020
if you move your mouse around,

383
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,020
he just like goes to the opposite.

384
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,020
I love you.

385
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,020
Okay.

386
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,020
Here you go.

387
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,020
Here you go.

388
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,020
Here you go.

389
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,020
Zoom through it.

390
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,020
Ah!

391
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,020
She hesitated.

392
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,020
Hesitation means death.

393
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,020
Where'd the car go?

394
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,020
Hesitation is the thing.

395
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,020
So, who's turn is the next?

396
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,020
I'm ready to drive this flight.

397
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,020
Go for it.

398
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,020
Go for it.

399
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,020
Here we go.

400
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,020
I'm so ready for Fran.

401
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
Well, I love her.

402
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,020
Drive the song.

403
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,020
You're the queen.

404
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,020
She was gonna drive the song.

405
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
Never let Apollo drive.

406
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,020
What do you mean?

407
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,020
Never let Fran drive.

408
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,020
Okay, Azera.

409
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,020
Azera, you're next.

410
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,020
Azera, drive.

411
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,020
No Fran, don't touch it yet.

412
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,020
I'm not.

413
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,020
I'm not.

414
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm not.

415
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,020
Clicky, clicky, clicky.

416
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
Azera, you got this.

417
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,020
To the left, to the left turn.

418
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,020
To the left, to the left turn.

419
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,020
Alright, Apollo might have to be the one

420
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,020
that drives us.

421
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,020
Why is the turn so long?

422
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,020
It's hard to steer.

423
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,020
Wait, what do you steer with?

424
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
I don't know.

425
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,020
At the AD.

426
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,020
Oh, okay.

427
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,020
Oh, my God.

428
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,020
The AD is AD.

429
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,020
She's always just A and B.

430
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,020
Okay.

431
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,020
A and D and...

432
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,020
I wonder if you know how to live in Tokyo

433
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
if you see it and you need it

434
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,020
and you know you got to go

435
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,020
faster than you.

436
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,020
To the left, to the left slowly.

437
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,020
Rose, it's alright.

438
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,020
I'm a pro.

439
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,020
I'm a pro.

440
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,020
I'm a pro.

441
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,020
Come back, come back.

442
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,020
The AD is real.

443
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,020
I didn't think you...

444
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,020
Okay, okay.

445
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
We're fine.

446
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,020
We're good.

447
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,020
You're a pro.

448
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,020
Pro-stress.

449
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,020
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

450
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,020
We made it, boys.

451
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,020
We made it.

452
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,020
Years of Mario Kart.

453
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,020
Owned my skill.

454
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,020
Now this part, we just got to time it

455
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,020
to what the direction is.

456
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,020
We shouldn't be too hard, I believe.

457
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,020
And we just got, you can just jump.

458
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,020
Yeah, I want to get closer.

459
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,020
We just jump on it and kind of do it.

460
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,020
We just jump until it turns because, yeah.

461
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,020
Okay.

462
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,020
And go.

463
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
And jump.

464
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,020
And jump.

465
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,020
And jump.

466
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,020
There you go, there you go.

467
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,020
We're back, we're back.

468
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,020
And jump.

469
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,020
There's a weird version of dance, dance, revolution.

470
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,020
For some reason.

471
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,020
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

472
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,020
I tried to recover it, I tried.

473
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,020
Oh, wait.

474
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,020
Oh, we're back here?

475
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,020
Oh, okay.

476
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,020
Oh, we missed our ride.

477
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,020
Well, hey, it's okay.

478
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,020
Oh, wait, let's go back.

479
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,020
And go.

480
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,020
Wait, we're going back.

481
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,020
Wait, are we going back?

482
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,020
No, we're going to the right spot.

483
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,020
Oh, for a second it glitched out for me.

484
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,020
And I was like, we what?

485
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,020
Oh, hello.

486
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,020
I can't get about it.

487
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,020
Okay, jump, jump, jump.

488
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,020
Oh, perfect. There we go.

489
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,020
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

490
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,020
Hello, thank you so much for coming.

491
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,020
I'm getting like, super pulled here.

492
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,020
I'm sorry.

493
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,020
I have no control over what I do.

494
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,020
Sign in, sign.

495
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,020
We just got back.

496
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,020
Sign in, sign.

497
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
We just got to climb up.

498
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,020
Oh, is this just jumping?

499
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,020
Okay, jump.

500
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,020
If one of us can't make it, we just kind of pull them.

501
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,020
Yeah, the rest of us can make it.

502
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
We got this.

503
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,020
Oh, oh, I'm falling.

504
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,020
Okay, no, we're good, we're good, come on.

505
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,020
Pull me up, pull me up, bro.

506
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
Pull me up, bro.

507
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,020
Yippee.

508
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,020
Move over here.

509
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
Wait, just kidding.

510
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,020
Oh, my God.

511
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,020
Oh, you can jump on the corners.

512
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,020
Oh, okay, that makes it a lot easier.

513
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,020
Can I pull Azura?

514
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,020
Okay.

515
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,020
Thank you.

516
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,020
So we can just jump up onto the corner?

517
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,020
Yeah.

518
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,020
Yeah?

519
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,020
Sometimes it lets me.

520
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,020
All right, when you guys are free,

521
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,020
can you pull?

522
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,020
Pull here, pull over here.

523
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,020
Yay, I made it.

524
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,020
Why am I stuck under?

525
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,020
All right, perfect.

526
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,020
Perfect.

527
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,020
Yeah.

528
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,020
How are you able to do that?

529
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,020
I was able to do it once

530
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,020
and then I couldn't do it again.

531
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,020
I think only two people can do it at a time.

532
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,020
I am dead.

533
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,020
There we go, there we go, there we go.

534
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,020
One of these flames of fire.

535
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,020
Where do we go next?

536
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,020
We go that way?

537
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,020
All right.

538
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,020
One.

539
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,020
Oh, God.

540
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,020
This is just jumping, this will be easier.

541
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,020
Azura, lead the way.

542
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,020
Me, why me?

543
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,020
Because you get pulled around by us,

544
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,020
so it's your turn to pull us.

545
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,020
Why am I off to the side?

546
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,020
I am always standing sideways.

547
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,020
Any home?

548
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,020
What?

549
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,020
It's a small jump, it's a small jump.

550
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,020
You got to go push and then back.

551
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,020
Push back.

552
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,020
Oh, no.

553
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,020
Oh, no.

554
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,020
Okay, okay, okay.

555
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,020
It's all over you.

556
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,020
No!

557
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,020
I couldn't pull you off.

558
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,020
Okay, so when you're jumping,

559
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,020
push and then back.

560
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,020
You got to pull back.

561
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

562
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,020
Three, two, one.

563
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,020
Are we just going for it?

564
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,020
Three, two, one.

565
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,020
Small jumps, small jumps.

566
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,020
Three, two, one.

567
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,020
Okay, we got it.

568
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,020
Three, two, one.

569
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,020
Oh, shit.

570
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,020
I slid off.

571
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,020
I slid off.

572
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,020
We are doing so good.

573
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,020
We can do it again.

574
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,020
We can do it again.

575
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,020
Okay, okay.

576
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,020
We've got this.

577
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,020
Okay, okay, okay.

578
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,020
Who's the best gamer sub?

579
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,020
Use code up.

580
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,020
Go on.

581
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,020
Yeah.

582
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,020
Code, yum.

583
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,020
Yum, yum.

584
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,020
Code TV.

585
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,020
What is happening?

586
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,020
Oh, gaming.

587
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,020
This is pretty cool actually.

588
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,020
I feel like I'm doing double Dutch.

589
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,020
Do, do, do, do.

590
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,860
Little dunce, doo dunce, doo dunce, doo dunce,

591
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,520
doo dunce, doo dunce.

592
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,020
Doo dunce, doo dunce.

593
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,280
Ah, I'm out of breath.

594
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,400
Okay, are you yeah ready?

595
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,440
Three, two, one!

596
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,520
I got her!

597
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,060
My cat's food is going off!

598
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,680
Wow!

599
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,620
Wow!

600
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,880
Ow...

601
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,680
about looking at this disappointment.

602
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,560
Damn!

603
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,720
Don't go out and do me like that.

604
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,060
We trying.

605
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,900
Come here, Bea.

606
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,440
I'm gonna bring my cat to her food bowl.

607
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,280
Yeah.

608
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,280
Come here, you go fish meal.

609
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,480
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

610
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,280
Sorry, my cat's legs don't work.

611
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,520
She's fine.

612
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,320
I got her to her food bowl.

613
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,320
Do you just throw up?

614
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,240
What?

615
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,000
Oh, there we go.

616
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,200
Poles are close to me.

617
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,800
Yeah.

618
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,000
I want to be so close to you.

619
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,120
Oh, I want to be close.

620
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,720
So close.

621
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,360
That's so sexy.

622
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,720
I love a woman that can just burp into my face.

623
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,240
I like that.

624
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,720
Smells like Gamer Sub's lean.

625
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,240
I love it.

626
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,320
And it's really funny because my cat just jumped off the screen.

627
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,920
Oh, I'm dead.

628
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,120
OK.

629
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:49,600
I'm ready.

630
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,000
We ready?

631
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,440
We ready?

632
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,400
Ready.

633
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,960
Three, two, one.

634
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,240
Three, two, one.

635
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,600
Oh, he jumped off the car.

636
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,400
No, it's good.

637
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,200
I can get on this limb.

638
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Oh, thank you.

639
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,200
Oh.

640
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,200
I'm going to need you to.

641
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Oh, well.

642
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
Pfft.

643
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,200
Oh, no.

644
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,440
Yeah, I got to my chat.

645
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,560
I got Fia's meds today.

646
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,120
So hopefully that goes away soon.

647
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,640
She gets like this weird virus where her body is just like,

648
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,440
I can't walk.

649
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,280
But she should be good after some antibiotics.

650
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,440
She's a tough one.

651
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,040
I love her to death.

652
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,720
She's my little baby girl.

653
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,680
All right.

654
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,960
Three, two, one.

655
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,440
Baby steps, baby steps.

656
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,520
Three, two, one.

657
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,520
Baby steps, baby steps.

658
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,760
Oh, oh, there we go.

659
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,320
There we go.

660
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,440
Three, two, one.

661
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,600
This looks like tofu.

662
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,720
OK, OK, OK.

663
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,880
OK.

664
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,360
Three, two, one.

665
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,200
OK, OK.

666
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,840
Three, two, one.

667
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,840
Oh, shit.

668
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
Two, zero.

669
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,960
Get to the other side.

670
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,680
Let me swing.

671
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,520
Is there a don't move so much?

672
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,600
Ah, I'm not swinging anymore.

673
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,960
I'm not swinging anymore.

674
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,360
Guys, don't move.

675
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,200
Swingings, are you swinging?

676
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,600
I'm just constantly pulling.

677
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,240
I'm not swinging anymore.

678
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,680
All right, all right, there we go.

679
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,520
Stay calm.

680
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,240
Stay calm, collected.

681
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,360
Freya, don't.

682
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,360
Oh, that actually worked out.

683
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:29,860
I made it.

684
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:30,360
I made it.

685
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,360
I made it.

686
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,320
Yeah, let's jump across.

687
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,800
Then that gives us some more room.

688
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:43,760
Yeah, it's your sensitivity, so why?

689
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,200
You just fly off the platform when you get up.

690
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,680
OK, ready?

691
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,180
Ready?

692
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,600
Really bad at video games.

693
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,280
Three, two, one.

694
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,280
That was a little early.

695
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,000
Speedcore.

696
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,240
Speedrun, go.

697
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,520
Speedrun, go.

698
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,520
Oh, never mind.

699
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,200
Speedrun is not in my speedrun.

700
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
OK, OK.

701
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,800
I like how far the stairs are to follow.

702
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,800
Oh, jeez.

703
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
I'm trying to pull.

704
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,800
I'm trying to pull.

705
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,800
Oh, all right.

706
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
Woo.

707
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
OK.

708
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,800
Nice count.

709
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,800
What is this?

710
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,800
We were so unified before.

711
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,800
Easy jump.

712
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Easy jump.

713
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,800
We've got this.

714
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,800
Easy.

715
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
Easy jump.

716
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Oh, no, this next thing was.

717
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,800
Pause.

718
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,800
Pause.

719
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,800
Oh, never mind.

720
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,800
We're fine.

721
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,800
OK, we just got out of there.

722
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,800
This has to be timing.

723
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,800
Ready?

724
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,800
Here we go.

725
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,800
Get closer, Sarah.

726
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,800
Go.

727
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,800
Go.

728
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,800
Wait.

729
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
I don't think we did a good job.

730
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Oh.

731
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,800
I am fine.

732
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,800
Oh, never mind.

733
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Yippee.

734
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,800
OK, OK, OK.

735
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,800
Let's do that again.

736
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,800
Get closer, everyone.

737
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,800
Everyone, Azora.

738
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,800
Azora, honey.

739
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,800
OK.

740
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,800
Wait.

741
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Wait.

742
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
Wait.

743
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,800
Jump.

744
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,800
Why did I overshoot that?

745
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,800
I don't understand.

746
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Well.

747
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
Oh, we're fine.

748
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
We're fine.

749
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
We're fine.

750
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
We're fine.

751
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
We're fine.

752
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
OK, we just need to pull them up and quickly.

753
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
No.

754
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,800
Jump.

755
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,800
Oh, make it to that one.

756
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,800
Next one.

757
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
Smart.

758
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Smart.

759
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,800
All right.

760
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
Where do we go now?

761
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,800
Which way are we going?

762
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,800
I'm trying to climb.

763
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,800
Wait.

764
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,800
OK, OK.

765
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
Oh, we're back to the top.

766
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,800
All right.

767
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,800
Go.

768
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
This way?

769
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
Oh.

770
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,800
It's fine.

771
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,800
It's fine.

772
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
Dude, this is so fun.

773
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,800
No.

774
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,800
Oh, my God.

775
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,800
All right.

776
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,800
OK, OK, OK.

777
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,800
We got a speed run this.

778
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,800
Yeah.

779
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,800
OK, ready?

780
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,800
Shift the sprint.

781
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,800
Got it.

782
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,800
Jump.

783
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,800
Ready.

784
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,800
Jump.

785
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,800
Jump.

786
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,800
Oh, what the heck?

787
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,800
Yeah, me too.

788
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,800
I think you jump farther when you sprint.

789
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,800
We don't sprint until the jump is made.

790
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,800
OK.

791
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,800
I agree.

792
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
I don't know what's happening.

793
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,800
I'm just kind of just hanging out.

794
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,800
Oh.

795
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,800
Oh, I got us.

796
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,800
Wait.

797
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,800
We're going to be head down.

798
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
OK.

799
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,800
OK.

800
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,800
I guess no shift yet until when your feet are on the ground.

801
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,800
Got it.

802
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,800
Yeah.

803
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,800
OK.

804
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,800
Next one.

805
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

806
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,800
OK.

807
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,800
Let's do this.

808
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
OK.

809
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,800
And go.

810
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,800
And oh.

811
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,800
Oh.

812
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,800
Oh.

813
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,800
Oh.

814
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,800
Yeah.

815
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,800
Carry us.

816
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
Carry us to victory queen.

817
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,800
We found out.

818
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
We found out.

819
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Oh.

820
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
We found out.

821
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
We found out.

822
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,800
We found out.

823
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,800
We found out.

824
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,800
We found out.

825
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,800
We found out.

826
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,800
We found out.

827
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,800
We did it.

828
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,800
Yeah.

829
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,800
I was late.

830
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,800
Yeah.

831
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,800
I thought I was going to mash this all up because of that.

832
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,800
All right.

833
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
Oh, what's that?

834
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,800
What the heck?

835
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,800
Oh, it's a timer.

836
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,800
Oh.

837
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,800
Oh, we already lost that.

838
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
Yeah.

839
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
I think we got it.

840
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,800
Should we try that again?

841
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
Hold on.

842
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,800
Hold on.

843
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,800
Hold on.

844
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,800
Hold on.

845
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,800
OK.

846
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,800
So like when we're climbing, we got to try to jump as fast.

847
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,800
All right.

848
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,800
We'll try to shift.

849
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,800
We're going to use less time.

850
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
Yeah.

851
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,800
Actually, I think we can make that.

852
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,800
What is this?

853
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,800
OK.

854
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
I'm back.

855
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
Here we go.

856
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
Yeah.

857
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
Yeah.

858
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Oh.

859
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
Oh.

860
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Oh.

861
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Oh.

862
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,800
Go.

863
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Go.

864
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,800
Go.

865
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Go.

866
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Go.

867
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
Go.

868
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
Go.

869
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
I don't know if we're going to make it, guys.

870
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
We're making it.

871
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
We're making it.

872
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,800
We're making it.

873
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,800
We're making it.

874
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,800
We're making it.

875
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,800
We're making it, guys.

876
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
We did it.

877
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,800
We did it.

878
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,800
We did it.

879
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,800
We did it.

880
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,800
We did it.

881
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,800
We did it.

882
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,800
Yeah.

883
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,800
It was hard to avoid the climbing animations.

884
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,800
Help.

885
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,800
Oh, my God.

886
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,800
That was scary.

887
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,800
Thanks, Queen.

888
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,800
We did it.

889
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
We did it.

890
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
Apollo with the clutch.

891
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
We did it.

892
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,800
We did it.

893
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
We did it.

894
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,800
Yeah.

895
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,800
Apollo with the hard carry.

896
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,800
Ready?

897
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
Go.

898
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,800
Nice.

899
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,800
Right off.

900
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,800
Right.

901
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,800
I counted us off and missed.

902
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,800
There we go.

903
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,800
Thank you.

904
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
OK.

905
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,800
Ready?

906
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
Three, two, one.

907
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,800
Nifty.

908
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,800
Three.

909
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,800
Oh.

910
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,800
All right.

911
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,800
Three.

912
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,800
Three.

913
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,800
Three.

914
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,800
Three.

915
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,800
Three.

916
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,800
Oh, my God.

917
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,800
An elevator.

918
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,800
Thanks, the lords.

919
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,800
No.

920
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,800
I think you have an elevator.

921
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,800
It's OK.

922
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,800
You'll just hang around.

923
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,800
Yeah.

924
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,800
It's cool.

925
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,800
I'm fine.

926
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,800
I'm just going to chill.

927
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,800
It's like running in midair.

928
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,800
Oh.

929
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,800
Oh.

930
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,800
Oh.

931
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,800
Yay.

932
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,800
Oh, you guys are going to be stuck.

933
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,800
No, they're not stuck.

934
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,800
You're fine.

935
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,800
Uh-oh.

936
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,800
Wait.

937
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,800
Come around.

938
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,800
Come around the side.

939
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Come around the...

940
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,800
Go to the opposite side for you.

941
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,800
Go to the opposite side.

942
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,800
We've got you.

943
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,800
No, we've got you.

944
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,800
Oh, it broke.

945
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,800
It doesn't matter.

946
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,800
Oh, OK.

947
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,800
OK.

948
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,800
What's happening?

949
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,800
Pull them up.

950
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,800
Yeah.

951
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,800
What the hell is that?

952
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,800
Oh.

953
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,800
This is fun.

954
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,800
We're like one third of the way there.

955
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
We're almost done.

956
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,800
Yay.

957
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,800
Holy crap.

958
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:46,800
I'm impressed with this.

959
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,800
No deaths.

960
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,920
Azora and I are going to like plan to play this again in like Saturday, but we're going

961
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,920
to be drunk.

962
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,920
Oh, God.

963
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,920
Oh, my goodness.

964
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,920
How do you die?

965
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,920
Can you die?

966
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
How do you die?

967
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
I can't.

968
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,920
I just kind of went down.

969
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,920
All right.

970
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
Yeah.

971
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,920
If you look down and go down.

972
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
Cool.

973
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Yeah.

974
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,920
I'm excited for that.

975
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
Honestly impressed with the level design.

976
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,920
I'm not going to lie.

977
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,920
Yeah.

978
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,920
When I play Diablo.

979
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,920
Hello Raiders.

980
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,920
Hi.

981
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,920
Hello.

982
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,920
Hi Raiders.

983
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,920
Hi Raiders.

984
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,920
Hi Raiders.

985
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,920
Hi sisters.

986
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,920
Hi.

987
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,920
Sorry.

988
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,920
Oh, my God.

989
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,920
Hi sisters.

990
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,920
Hi sisters.

991
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,920
I love that.

992
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,920
The jump scare.

993
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,920
This is the third fate.

994
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,920
Hades.

995
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:35,920
Siri.

996
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,920
And Nico now.

997
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,920
Thank you.

998
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,920
Thank you so much.

999
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,920
I really appreciate it.

1000
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,920
It's an honor.

1001
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,920
It's an honor.

1002
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,920
We're playing chain together with a lovely, beautiful guest.

1003
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,920
Fraya.

1004
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,920
And Siby.

1005
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,920
Siby.

1006
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,920
Dule.

1007
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,920
I'm so sorry.

1008
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,920
I'm Dule now.

1009
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,920
Dule.

1010
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,920
I'm Siby Cottonbom.

1011
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,920
And Siby Cottonbom.

1012
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,920
Yes.

1013
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,920
Hi.

1014
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,920
What the hell is this?

1015
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
I hope the collab is going well.

1016
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,920
It's going very well.

1017
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,920
Oh, wait.

1018
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,920
Wings.

1019
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,920
Wings.

1020
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Get the wings.

1021
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,920
Get the wings.

1022
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,920
Where?

1023
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,920
Wings.

1024
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
I've never been this far.

1025
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Wings.

1026
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,920
Ah.

1027
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,120
Is this really only the second wings? Have we missed some?

1028
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,620
Oh, uh, probably.

1029
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:27,120
Oh.

1030
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,920
Yeah, I don't know how he's supposed to find all 10.

1031
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,720
Oh, anyways.

1032
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,320
Oh.

1033
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,120
What's the puzzle?

1034
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:32,920
We've got this.

1035
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,020
Mavikins, can we please have a shout-out to Hoda?

1036
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,120
I'm going to make you a VIP.

1037
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,120
Hee hee hee hee.

1038
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,520
Is this our final one?

1039
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,120
How do you-

1040
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:42,620
What?

1041
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,520
Over there.

1042
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,520
How do we-

1043
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,720
Oh, OK.

1044
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,220
I'll just uh-

1045
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:46,920
No, no.

1046
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,120
Someone has to stay on the end.

1047
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:49,620
OK.

1048
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,220
So the two on the end go to the end.

1049
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:51,720
I'll stay.

1050
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,620
I'll stay right here then.

1051
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,520
OK, then she beat go to the other one.

1052
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,420
Oh, I got it.

1053
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:56,920
I got it.

1054
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,420
OK.

1055
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:57,720
OK.

1056
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,220
OK.

1057
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,220
Are we missing one?

1058
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,720
And then what happens?

1059
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,020
Are there more buttons?

1060
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,220
Oh, there's one up there.

1061
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:07,820
It's time.

1062
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,120
Ah!

1063
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,020
It's time.

1064
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:10,920
Oh, where is it?

1065
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,420
Times.

1066
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,320
Over here, where I am.

1067
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,420
Oh, that's bad.

1068
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,420
Oh, it's up top.

1069
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,220
Damn.

1070
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,220
Are we supposed to do that?

1071
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,120
Yeah, it looks like we got to get to the little one.

1072
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:24,720
All right.

1073
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,820
And then we got to show.

1074
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:27,420
OK.

1075
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,220
OK.

1076
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,520
All right.

1077
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,320
Is it really timed or-

1078
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,420
Maybe it's timed.

1079
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,720
Maybe they're just on.

1080
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,220
Yeah.

1081
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,020
I hope so.

1082
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:35,720
Right?

1083
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,320
No.

1084
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:36,820
Go.

1085
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:37,520
Oh.

1086
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,420
Wait, no.

1087
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:40,220
Oh, there's another one up there.

1088
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,720
Oh, my God.

1089
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,020
Also, this isn't the right way.

1090
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,920
OK.

1091
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,320
It's this.

1092
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,520
I think it's this way to the left side.

1093
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,320
Is it tossed around?

1094
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,320
This way?

1095
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,420
Yeah.

1096
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:56,920
I think-

1097
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,520
Yeah, there we go.

1098
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,420
It was tossed around in a rag doll.

1099
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,220
What is going on?

1100
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,620
OK.

1101
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,720
Over here.

1102
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,220
Climb.

1103
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,420
Climb.

1104
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,720
Climb.

1105
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,320
Climb.

1106
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,020
Climb.

1107
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,920
Ah!

1108
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,720
OK, OK.

1109
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,220
OK.

1110
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,320
She just runs off every time.

1111
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,520
OK, OK, OK.

1112
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,120
OK.

1113
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,920
Over there.

1114
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,920
Jump over here.

1115
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,720
Over here.

1116
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,420
You-

1117
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,120
You went the hardest way.

1118
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:28,720
OK.

1119
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,520
OK.

1120
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,820
Oh!

1121
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:34,020
I'm trying so hard not to fall off right now.

1122
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,920
You pressed the button, right?

1123
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,320
Yeah.

1124
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,720
Yeah, I already pressed it.

1125
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,320
Now we just need to get to the other side.

1126
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:40,920
Come on.

1127
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,720
All you Azura.

1128
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,120
Ah!

1129
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,520
Perfect.

1130
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,720
Ah!

1131
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,720
I need you.

1132
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,920
Pull me, pull me.

1133
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,920
Trying.

1134
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,320
It's-

1135
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,720
There we go.

1136
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,920
I was pulling Azura towards me.

1137
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,920
No problem, no problem.

1138
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,720
I don't think it has been an hour in this room.

1139
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,620
I already got three raids.

1140
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:04,720
That's pretty crazy.

1141
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,120
OK, this one, this one.

1142
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,020
Wee!

1143
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:08,720
Wee!

1144
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,520
Wee!

1145
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,520
We did it!

1146
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,520
You're-

1147
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,520
We're free, we're free.

1148
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,520
What?

1149
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,520
We did it, yeah.

1150
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,520
I see, we did it.

1151
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,520
Oh.

1152
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,520
Uh oh.

1153
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1154
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,520
OK, now jump.

1155
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,520
Oh!

1156
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,520
Fine, we can just carry you.

1157
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,520
Thank you.

1158
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,520
Oh, thank you.

1159
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,520
That was a little thingy.

1160
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,520
Uh oh.

1161
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,520
OK, we gotta time it.

1162
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,520
How close should we get?

1163
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,520
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1164
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,520
I'm not so sure about that, chief.

1165
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,520
OK, now we go, now we go.

1166
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,520
OK, let's wait, wait here.

1167
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,520
Whoa, my toesies.

1168
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1169
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,520
OK.

1170
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
All right.

1171
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
OK, go.

1172
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,520
I feel like Spider-Man.

1173
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,520
I think I'm the slowest out of all of us.

1174
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,520
Oh, jump.

1175
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,520
Oh.

1176
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,520
Wee.

1177
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,520
Oh my gosh.

1178
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,520
Oh, stairs.

1179
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,520
Oh, stairs.

1180
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
Wow.

1181
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,520
Oh, that was easy.

1182
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
Wee!

1183
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
Talk to me in sexy voice.

1184
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,520
Is Mama Freya live?

1185
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,520
Oh, oh.

1186
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1187
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,520
Sorry.

1188
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,520
Sorry.

1189
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,520
Sorry.

1190
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,520
OK.

1191
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,520
She had to sprint through.

1192
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
Yeah, I believe so, ready.

1193
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,520
And, oh, I just jumped.

1194
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,520
OK.

1195
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,520
Oh, I'm like are y'all here?

1196
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,520
Azura is skirting the edge.

1197
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,520
I have to walk the way.

1198
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,520
You can't skip walking into it.

1199
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,520
I have to walk into the bridge.

1200
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,520
I don't want to pull, yeah, yeah, I don't want to pull.

1201
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,520
I am live.

1202
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,280
Yeah, boy, OK.

1203
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,720
Hold on tight, spider monkey.

1204
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:46,960
Got it.

1205
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,080
There you go.

1206
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:48,400
Got it.

1207
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:48,680
There you go.

1208
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,920
Got it.

1209
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,080
Where you been, Loka?

1210
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,760
I'm down.

1211
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,840
I'm down.

1212
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,400
I'm pulling you.

1213
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,520
I'm pulling you.

1214
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,000
There you go.

1215
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,960
I think I figured out how to pull now.

1216
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,440
Yeah.

1217
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:14,800
Oh, man, I like what Apollo just dangled there.

1218
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,040
Dangled to victory.

1219
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:16,520
Ready?

1220
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,000
Jump across.

1221
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
We jump.

1222
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,640
Ready?

1223
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,040
Jump.

1224
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,200
I got a jump here.

1225
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:22,640
Oh, no.

1226
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,640
Oh, no, I'm scared.

1227
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,120
We all just backed up at the same time.

1228
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,620
Ready?

1229
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,600
I'm scared.

1230
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,400
I'm scared.

1231
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:27,880
Ah!

1232
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,880
I'm so scared.

1233
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,400
I'm so straight on it.

1234
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:30,880
Sorry.

1235
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,320
Oh, nice.

1236
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,520
We're in a good spot.

1237
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,520
Oh, my gosh.

1238
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,000
I'm going to have lost my voice after this.

1239
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,160
Same.

1240
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:46,800
It's gone.

1241
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,640
I have ASMR stream tomorrow, so I guess I'm just

1242
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,400
going to have a horse voice.

1243
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,400
Hi, everybody.

1244
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,400
OK, ready?

1245
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:58,680
I'm going.

1246
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,400
I'm facing my fears.

1247
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,600
And go!

1248
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,920
Oh, you just missed that Apollo.

1249
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,880
My space bar was like, it didn't click.

1250
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,840
They almost panicked.

1251
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,240
OK.

1252
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,560
It's hard to see past these stupid bars.

1253
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,040
You got it.

1254
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:18,960
You got it.

1255
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,240
Where are we going now?

1256
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,880
Where are we going this way?

1257
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:24,480
Oh, wait.

1258
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,760
Are we not supposed to get off?

1259
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,360
I don't think so.

1260
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,360
We can go this way.

1261
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,000
Yeah, I think this is an area you fall at.

1262
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,880
Like, if you fall, you can land here in one of these areas.

1263
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,080
Also, we weren't supposed to jump off.

1264
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,440
OK, so we just jumped back off.

1265
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,840
I think we went the wrong way.

1266
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,160
OK.

1267
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,760
Sorry, I have to go in that direction over there.

1268
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,640
You got right there on our left.

1269
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,200
OK, we're supposed to go over there.

1270
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:51,800
OK, ready?

1271
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,800
Yeah.

1272
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
Oh.

1273
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,640
I got on me.

1274
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,640
Thank you so much for that.

1275
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:59,040
I blame Apollo.

1276
01:15:59,040 --> 01:15:59,920
You can blame me.

1277
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,960
It was all bait.

1278
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,160
Thank you so much for the raid.

1279
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,960
So nice weather we're having.

1280
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,400
Yeah, gorgeous hellscape.

1281
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,560
Oh, yeah, I love it.

1282
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,400
I kind of like it.

1283
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,920
It wouldn't be a hell unless we were chained together,

1284
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,160
though.

1285
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,880
If we were separate, it would be just a vacation home,

1286
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,960
honestly.

1287
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,760
So because we're chained together, it's hell.

1288
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,400
Mm-hmm.

1289
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,280
OK, don't.

1290
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,320
Oh, I'm laughing too hard.

1291
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,480
Sorry, that was me.

1292
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,800
Right on it.

1293
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
Oh, it's neat.

1294
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,320
Where are we?

1295
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,040
Oh, what is this?

1296
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,600
What's this pit?

1297
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,400
There's like a hole in there.

1298
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,000
Go to the hole.

1299
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,240
We find a secret spot.

1300
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,000
Oh, that's the water where we were.

1301
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,080
Hey, thank you so much for the raid.

1302
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,480
Welcome.

1303
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,880
Hell is my kind of place.

1304
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,120
Yeah, we are playing.

1305
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,600
Oh, Missouri is pulling us.

1306
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,720
Beautiful ladies of Veilor and Apollo.

1307
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,880
Hi.

1308
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,400
I am from Mythos.

1309
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,640
I am from Mythos.

1310
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,720
OK.

1311
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,880
Apollo, if we were.

1312
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,640
I think it's the only up.

1313
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,120
Sorry, it's called chained together.

1314
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,960
That too.

1315
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,960
If we were goddesses in Mythos, what would our goddess names

1316
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:20,920
be?

1317
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,320
Which Greek gods would it be?

1318
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,320
Let's see.

1319
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,320
Azora would be Aphrodite.

1320
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,320
Oh, that's a good one.

1321
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,320
Do we have to go over here?

1322
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,320
Because she's just she's so freaking adorable.

1323
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,320
I could see it like a shy Aphrodite be like.

1324
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,320
Hey, we're fine.

1325
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,320
We're fine.

1326
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,320
I don't see this is good.

1327
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,320
We got tossed up here.

1328
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,320
Now we go back on it.

1329
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,320
Three, two, one.

1330
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,320
Too far.

1331
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,320
Too far.

1332
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,320
Yeah, we got to wait for the next one.

1333
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,320
Don't we go?

1334
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,320
Don't we go over there?

1335
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,320
Looks like a point.

1336
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,320
Over there.

1337
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,320
OK, ready?

1338
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,320
Ready?

1339
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,320
Jump.

1340
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,320
How did I not land on that?

1341
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,320
OK, we got to go the opposite way over there, I believe.

1342
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
Why not?

1343
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,320
Where are we trying to go?

1344
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,320
Right here?

1345
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,320
Is that our jump?

1346
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
I would say Aris from Aris.

1347
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
Yeah, Aris would be cool.

1348
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,320
I think Artemis for Frio would be cool.

1349
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
You got jump on that.

1350
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,320
Oh, shit.

1351
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,320
We got to time it.

1352
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,320
OK, count.

1353
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,320
Three, two, one.

1354
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,320
OK, ready?

1355
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,320
Ready?

1356
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
Jump.

1357
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,320
Count.

1358
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,320
Three, two, one.

1359
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,320
OK, I don't know how that happened, but I did it.

1360
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,320
This guy stopped moving.

1361
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,320
Guy stopped moving.

1362
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,320
I'm pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling.

1363
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,320
I'm trying to stabilize.

1364
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,320
OK, cool.

1365
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,320
I'm going to get pulled off with a circle.

1366
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,320
All right, we're good.

1367
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,320
We good, we good.

1368
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,320
OK.

1369
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,320
Nifty.

1370
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,320
Oh, we got to go.

1371
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,320
OK, now don't kick that.

1372
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,320
You're ready to go.

1373
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,320
There it was.

1374
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,320
We did it.

1375
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,320
OK, OK, OK.

1376
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,320
I got so discombobulated.

1377
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,320
Where the heck are we?

1378
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,320
Yeah, which way are we going?

1379
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,320
Oh, my gosh, I saw a flaming man as.

1380
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,320
Where?

1381
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,320
Oh.

1382
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,320
Look at his butt.

1383
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,320
So there's another one coming up.

1384
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,320
We've got to get to that one.

1385
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,320
All right.

1386
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,320
Let's get closer.

1387
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,320
Get close.

1388
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,320
Yeah.

1389
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,320
Ready?

1390
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,320
Go.

1391
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,320
It's helpful if you shout when you jump.

1392
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,320
Is this where we're going?

1393
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1395
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,320
This one, this one.

1396
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,320
Yeah.

1397
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,320
There we go.

1398
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,320
Oh, OK.

1399
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,320
Good job.

1400
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,320
Yippee.

1401
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,320
Totally not late for Mickey is raiding the bar.

01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,320
Hello.

1403
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,320
Hello.

1404
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
Hey, guys, doing back there.

1405
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,320
Are you ready to jump off this hard wood?

1406
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,320
Yes.

1407
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,320
Do we have to jump?

1408
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,320
Oh, my God.

1409
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,320
There we are.

1410
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,320
OK.

1411
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,320
OK.

1412
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,320
Go forward, Apollo.

1413
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,320
Oh, I just fell onto it.

1414
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,320

1415
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,320

Yeah.

1460
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:20,380
You good?

1461
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:22,380
Yeah.

1462
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,380
You good?

1463
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,380
You dying?

1464
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,380
Yeah, I'm Gucci.

1465
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:28,380
I'm not dying.

1466
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,380
We're soaring.

1467
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,380
Dying.

1468
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:35,380
We're just falling to hell.

1469
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:37,380
Cause everything's out of reach.

1470
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,380
Free falling.

1471
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,380
Alright, I'm good.

1472
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,380
I almost put save and quit game.

1473
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,380
Do not.

1474
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,380
Do not quit the game.

1475
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:55,380
Beautiful cue of that random man screaming to death.

1476
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,380
Alright.

1477
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,380
Here we go.

1478
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,380
Here we go.

1479
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,380
We're back.

1480
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,380
Our heads are so big.

1481
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:03,380
Let's go.

1482
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,380
It's blocking the screen.

1483
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:05,380
Let's go.

1484
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:06,380
Hold on.

1485
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:07,380
We're not ready.

1486
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:10,380
Nobody else wants just me and you apologize.

1487
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:11,380
What?

1488
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,380
We've got it.

1489
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:13,380
I'm pulling you.

1490
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,380
I'm pulling you.

1491
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,380
I need to make a smaller.

1492
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,380
I'll do that while we're screaming.

1493
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,380
That was fine.

1494
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:24,380
That was fine.

1495
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,380
Hello.

1496
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,380
Thank you so much.

1497
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,380
Thanks so much for following, honey.

1498
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:39,380
Is there an Apollo or like on top of each other?

1499
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,380
We're moving.

1500
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,380
Is there over a little bit?

1501
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:45,380
Do you want to be on top or do you want to be on bottom?

1502
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,380
Want to be on top.

1503
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:47,380
Sorry to sort of.

1504
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,380
I like to be in between.

1505
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,380
Son of America's TechSop model.

1506
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:52,380
Yeah.

1507
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,380
I'm ready to jump.

1508
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,380
Go on.

1509
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:00,380
I'm ready to jump.

1510
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,380
Go.

1511
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:02,380
Okay.

1512
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,380
We're doing good.

1513
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,380
We're doing good.

1514
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,380
We've got this.

1515
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,380
Sound like you just came.

1516
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,380
Jump.

1517
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,380
Jump.

1518
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:11,380
Twas not high.

1519
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:13,380
Twas not high.

1520
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:15,380
That is all I will say.

1521
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,380
This is funny.

1522
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,380
Are you enjoying yourselves, guys?

1523
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,380
Yippee.

1524
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,380
Oh.

1525
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,380
We're doing good.

1526
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:30,380
We're doing good.

1527
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,380
We're doing good.

1528
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,380
Are you enjoying yourselves, guys?

1529
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,380
Yippee.

1530
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,380
Oh.

1531
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:36,380
What the heck?

1532
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:38,380
I can't take it off.

1533
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:42,380
I think I'm getting mind broken as this continues.

1534
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,380
Whoa.

1535
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,380
Okay.

1536
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,380
I'm moving back a little bit.

1537
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,380
Back of the front.

1538
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:48,380
Kind of like hugs me up.

1539
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:49,380
Azora.

1540
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:50,380
Azora.

1541
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:53,380
I didn't think she was going to move.

1542
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:54,380
Okay.

1543
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,380
Ready?

1544
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:56,380
There's another one coming up, guys.

1545
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:57,380
Over here.

1546
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,380
She was locked in.

1547
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,380
Go.

1548
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:00,380
Oh, my God.

1549
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:03,380
She just made that Apollo menu.

1550
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:06,380
Here comes another one.

1551
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,380
Oh, look.

1552
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,380
Hey, closer, ladies.

1553
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:10,380
Go, go, go.

1554
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,380
Oh, shit.

1555
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,380
Oh, what?

1556
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:13,380
What?

1557
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,380
Your guys' models are gone for me.

1558
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:17,380
Apollo, you're gone.

1559
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:19,380
Oh, Apollo just died.

1560
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,380
Apollo, you're gone.

1561
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,380
I'm dead.

1562
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:23,380
I'm dead.

1563
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,380
I'm dead.

1564
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:26,380
Jump to freedom.

1565
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:27,380
Damn.

1566
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:28,380
All right.

1567
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,380
Let's pause here.

1568
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,380
Apollo, come here.

1569
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:31,380
Hi, guys.

1570
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,380
You in chat.

1571
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,380
You guys doing okay, chat?

1572
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:35,380
You guys doing all right?

1573
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:36,380
Damn.

1574
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:37,380
Am I gone?

1575
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:38,380
Hello?

1576
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,380
Hello?

1577
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,380
Hello?

1578
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,380
Well, you're still here.

1579
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,380
We're just kissing you on VTube Studio.

1580
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:43,380
Yeah.

1581
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:44,380
I can't see you guys either.

1582
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,380
I'm bad.

1583
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,380
You might have crashed like I did.

1584
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,380
Oh, connection system.

1585
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,380
Okay.

1586
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:51,380
Okay.

1587
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,380
Ehe, ehe, ehe.

1588
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:54,380
Hydrate time.

1589
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:55,380
Good idea.

1590
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,380
Good idea.

1591
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:59,380
One by one, they're dying.

1592
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,380
Damn.

1593
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,380
We start my model.

1594
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:02,380
Sheesh.

1595
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:06,380
Oh, my gosh.

1596
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:09,380
Remember to have encrustables.

1597
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:14,380
Big stretch.

1598
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:24,380
What is happening?

1599
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:26,380
I'm sorry.

1600
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,380
I just got, I just let it out.

1601
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,380
I was like, oh my God.

1602
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:31,380
I was cute.

1603
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,380
And I ended up just like.

1604
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:37,380
Sometimes you got a stretch.

1605
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:38,380
It feels good.

1606
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,380
Connection to steam servers failed.

1607
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:41,380
Oh no.

1608
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:42,380
That's what I got to.

1609
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:43,380
I got that too.

1610
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,380
I got that too.

1611
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,380
I had to restart.

1612
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:47,380
Oh, like to restart steam.

1613
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:49,380
I did that already.

1614
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,380
Oh, then yes.

1615
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:55,380
I like horse clothes it on the end of your arm.

1616
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,380
Oh, wait.

1617
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:58,380
Oh, oh, it's connected.

1618
01:30:58,380 --> 01:30:59,380
It's connected.

1619
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,380
Yeah.

1620
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,380
Welcome, baby.

1621
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,380
Let's see it.

1622
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,380
Baby.

1623
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:07,380
What the hell?

1624
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,380
Who the fuck is that?

1625
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:16,380
A ghost.

1626
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,380
Ghosts just whispers in your ear.

1627
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,380
Hey, baby.

1628
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:27,380
How you doing, baby?

1629
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:30,380
I'm taking a shit, baby.

1630
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:37,380
Oh, fuck yeah.

1631
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,380
That's the best feeling man.

1632
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:45,380
Tell me more.

1633
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:50,380
Hey, vengeful baby.

1634
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,380
How you doing?

1635
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,380
Steam saying a bunch of failures.

1636
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,380
I'm done.

1637
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:59,380
I'll talk like a really bad southern bed.

1638
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:04,380
I'll talk like a really bad southern bell until Apollo gets back.

1639
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:05,380
Did it say it failed?

1640
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:07,380
It said that you rejoined.

1641
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,380
I saw it.

1642
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,380
Hello.

1643
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,380
I'm here.

1644
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:16,380
I was wondering if after all this years.

1645
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,380
I was like me.

1646
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:21,380
I was literally about to start singing that.

1647
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:25,380
You took the words right out my mouth.

1648
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:28,380
I was going to be so insulted by my southern accent.

1649
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,380
I am.

1650
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:37,380
She's fuming quietly.

1651
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,380
Bonjourno.

1652
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:39,380
Konichiwa.

1653
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:41,380
Moshi moshi.

1654
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:51,380
Are we got to go Zyma?

1655
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:54,380
I'm carrying.

1656
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:56,380
What the heck?

1657
01:32:56,380 --> 01:33:01,380
What the heck?

1658
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:03,380
I can't see.

1659
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:05,380
There we go.

1660
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,380
Make it stop.

1661
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,380
There we go.

1662
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:12,380
You haven't loaded back in for me yet.

1663
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,380
It's probably going to take a bit.

1664
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,380
She's coming.

1665
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,380
She came.

1666
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:20,380
She's here.

1667
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:23,380
Look at the musical notes.

1668
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:25,380
They're animated.

1669
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,380
All the mythos girls are.

1670
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,380
Their outfits are also pretty animated.

1671
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,380
I can control her guys.

1672
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,380
Look.

1673
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:35,380
Look at her feet.

1674
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,380
Hold up.

1675
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,380
I'm making myself big.

1676
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,380
Those are actually some really nice feet.

1677
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:45,380
They're not weird vtuber feet.

1678
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:48,380
Some vtubers have weird ass feet.

1679
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:51,380
You have nice feet.

1680
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,380
Get stuffed on over here.

1681
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:56,380
Get stuffed on over there.

1682
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:58,380
I'll put you back.

1683
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,380
I can't stop staring at these toes.

1684
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,380
These are nice.

1685
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,380
Oh my god.

1686
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:19,380
My mods are going to yell at me later.

1687
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,380
I'm so sorry.

1688
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,380
The grapefruit.

1689
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,380
That's why I learned that technique.

1690
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,380
I learned the grapefruit technique.

1691
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,380
Here we go.

1692
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:40,380
We're back.

1693
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:42,380
We're back at it again.

1694
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,380
Back and better than ever.

1695
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,380
I'm being pulled.

1696
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,380
Let's go.

1697
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:51,380
I'm coming.

1698
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:53,380
She's coming.

1699
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,380
Yeah?

1700
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,380
I'm being pulled.

1701
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:59,380
I'm being pulled to victory.

1702
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:01,380
What just happened?

1703
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:04,380
I saw the jump and I was like,

1704
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,380
oh shit, I did the same.

1705
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,380
Please.

1706
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,380
Please.

1707
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:12,380
Oh no.

1708
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:15,380
We have to literally be super good at this man.

1709
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:19,380
I'm going to kill myself in Minecraft.

1710
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,380
In Minecraft?

1711
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:26,380
They were talking about them dogs.

1712
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:28,380
Yeah, I'm all fucking feed, man.

1713
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:30,380
They're beautiful.

1714
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,380
Them dogs are barking.

1715
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:34,380
I got that dog in me.

1716
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:38,380
My neighbors are probably like,

1717
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:40,380
what the fuck is going on?

1718
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:43,380
I'm sure they always think that.

1719
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,380
Not just today.

1720
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,380
Okay, I got it.

1721
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,380
I'm ready.

1722
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:52,380
I don't know.

1723
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,380
Is chain together carrying my motion sickness right now?

1724
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,380
Wait, whoa.

1725
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,380
I'm trying.

1726
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:04,380
I could have turned around to pull up.

1727
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:11,380
Last time, your nieces and nephews were into that.

1728
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:13,380
Damn bright they are.

1729
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:15,380
Sweet home out, man.

1730
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:17,380
Listen, I don't kink shame here.

1731
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,380
You like feet, you like feet.

1732
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,380
That's it.

1733
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:23,380
I thought we were talking about

1734
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,380
kissing sisters.

1735
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,380
Are you from Mississippi?

1736
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:33,380
Because you're the only miss who's pissed.

1737
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,380
I'm sippy.

1738
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,380
Okay, baby, I'll get a cup.

1739
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:39,380
Give me some of that.

1740
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:42,380
Is that how you piss?

1741
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,380
You just make those noises?

1742
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:49,380
Sorry, I fucked that up and jumped too early.

1743
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:51,380
No, we're good, we're good.

1744
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,380
We're good, I got you.

1745
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,380
Yeah, lift me up.

1746
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,380
Up you go.

1747
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,380
You ready?

1748
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,380
Okay, I'm doing it.

1749
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,380
Are we all wearing the same pants?

1750
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,380
Why do we have all the ripped

1751
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,380
golden hole in our butt cheek?

1752
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,380
Go slow.

1753
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,380
I'm sprinting this.

1754
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,380
No, no.

1755
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:22,380
Slow and steady.

1756
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:24,380
Easy tap, easy tap.

1757
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,380
Easy clap, easy tap.

1758
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:28,380
One at a time, jump.

1759
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,380
One at a time.

1760
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,380
Altogether?

1761
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,380
I don't think so.

1762
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,380
Okay, let's do it.

1763
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,380
You don't have to jump.

1764
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:40,380
You can just fall, by the way.

1765
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:42,380
No, no, no.

1766
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,380
Okay, okay.

1767
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:48,380
It's very hard to pull her up

1768
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,380
for some reason.

1769
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,380
I have to be looking down at her.

1770
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:54,380
Three, two, one.

1771
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,380
Oops.

1772
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:58,380
We made it, we made it, we made it.

1773
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:00,380
Going without us, just go, just go.

1774
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,380
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.

1775
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:04,380
Dammit, dammit, dammit.

1776
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,380
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.

1777
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,380
Oh my god.

1778
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,380
I'm just going to walk on to this.

1779
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,380
I'm so tired.

1780
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,380
Okay, good, okay, next.

1781
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:22,380
Freak.

1782
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:24,380
Oh shit, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1783
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:26,380
We got it, we got it, we got it.

1784
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:28,380
Okay, okay, okay.

1785
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,380
We're going, we're going.

1786
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:32,380
Dammit, oh snap.

1787
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:34,380
Yeah, we're so good, we're so good.

1788
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:36,380
No, we're going.

1789
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:38,380
Why do I keep fucking jumping?

1790
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,380
That was so early.

1791
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:42,380
Jump button to jump.

1792
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:44,380
Okay, hold up, hold up, hold up.

1793
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,380
Hold up, I got to fix him.

1794
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:50,380
Ah!

1795
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,380
It's fine, you're fine, you're fine.

1796
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,380
We got this, we're going to carry you.

1797
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:56,380
Oh no.

1798
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:58,380
We've got you, we can carry you.

1799
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,380
And Kat just hopped on my desk.

1800
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,380
I jumped first, you jumped first.

1801
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,380
I don't know what happened there.

1802
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,380
I didn't see any of us touch it.

1803
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:08,380
I forgot about the jump.

1804
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:10,380
I forgot that it existed.

1805
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,380
Where am I going?

1806
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:14,380
Oh, where are we?

1807
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:18,380
At the top of the water one again.

1808
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,380
Okay, let's go.

1809
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,380
Okay.

1810
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,380
I didn't press the jump button.

1811
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:36,380
You just jumped off.

1812
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,380
I didn't press the jump button.

1813
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:42,380
I just ran off.

1814
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:44,380
We got this, we got this.

1815
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:46,380
Oh, I got a piss.

1816
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,380
I got a piss.

1817
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:52,380
I'm looking at this guy's ass.

1818
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,380
Some fiery ass.

1819
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:58,380
Don't get distracted by the ass.

1820
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,380
It's very hard not to.

1821
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:04,380
That's Hell's ass right there.

1822
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,380
Oh, we made it, we made it, we made it.

1823
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:10,380
Did we?

1824
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,380
Oh god.

1825
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,380
Don't speak so soon.

1826
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:16,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1827
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,380
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1828
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,380
Open up, Haram.

1829
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:26,380
Is it just me?

1830
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:28,380
Where did my sound go?

1831
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,380
Oh no.

1832
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,380
Your game sound?

1833
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:34,380
Oh, it disappeared.

1834
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:36,380
That's weird.

1835
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:38,380
Why is Apollo so down?

1836
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:40,380
Hold on.

1837
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,380
I need to fix Apollo's head.

1838
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:44,380
It's doing inappropriate things.

1839
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,380
Alright, I brought her back up.

1840
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,380
That's my default height.

1841
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,380
Damn.

1842
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,380
It's a tiny hill.

1843
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:56,380
I'm tiny.

1844
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,380
I'm in chibi form.

1845
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:00,380
Oh, that makes more sense then.

1846
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:02,380
Yeah.

1847
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,380
Oh, I just, what the?

1848
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,380
No, no, no.

1849
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:08,380
No, no, no.

1850
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,380
No, no, no.

1851
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:12,380
No, not again.

1852
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:18,380
Okay, I'm going last.

1853
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,380
Okay.

1854
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,380
Single file.

1855
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,380
Single file line, let's go.

1856
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:26,380
There's no stuff, we're reconnecting.

1857
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,380
We're reconnecting, no worries.

1858
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:30,380
Oh wait, what just happened?

1859
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:32,380
Where'd everybody go?

1860
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,380
Oh wait, did everybody go?

1861
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:36,380
Yeah, everyone left me.

1862
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:38,380
Alright, who cares?

1863
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:40,380
I'm not going to fall.

1864
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,380
I'm just putting my Fuji up.

1865
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:44,380
Fuji.

1866
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,380
Oh, that's the game.

1867
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,380
I need...

1868
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:50,380
Hello, thank you so much for following.

1869
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:52,380
Oh, there's something apparently wrong with steam.

1870
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,380
That makes sense then.

1871
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:58,380
Why does it news to mess up while we are playing?

1872
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,380
How dare they?

1873
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,380
Believe.

1874
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:06,380
You're all free now.

1875
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:08,380
We're not free, we're not free.

1876
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,380
Now I'm just going to be a muppet on your screen,

1877
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:14,380
so I hope you guys like that.

1878
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,380
Our meds ran out.

1879
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:24,380
We're just doing it how we are.

1880
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:26,380
Bye-bye to those leaving.

1881
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,380
Bye.

1882
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,380
I can give you a link.

1883
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,380
It's a really quick setup.

1884
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,380
You just download it.

1885
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:36,380
Do you want it?

1886
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,380
I can't download something right now.

1887
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,380
We've got to play the game.

1888
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:44,380
We have priorities.

1889
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:46,380
That's playing the game.

1890
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:50,380
How's the game going?

1891
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:52,380
It's very...

1892
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,380
It's very reminiscent of your name.

1893
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:02,380
I'll be right back. I hear my cat outside.

1894
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:06,380
Now let the cat in.

1895
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,380
Let me check on my cat.

1896
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,380
Oh, it's not my cat.

1897
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,380
It's an outside cat that I like feeding every now and then.

1898
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:14,380
And it cries whenever it wants food.

1899
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:16,380
So I go out there.

1900
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:18,380
I'll be right back.

1901
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,380
That's so good.

1902
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,380
What?

1903
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,380
Here, I look for you.

1904
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:30,380
I give this to you.

1905
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:32,380
What's up lady?

1906
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:34,380
What?

1907
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:36,380
What?

1908
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,380
What?

1909
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,380
What?

1910
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,380
What?

1911
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,380
What?

1912
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:46,380
What?

1913
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,380
What?

1914
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:50,380
What?

1915
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:52,380
I can't just do pictures of everyone.

1916
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,380
That might be easier. Let's see who I have.

1917
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:56,380
It's pictured here.

1918
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:00,380
You just use this and then it uses the picture.

1919
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,060
I got a fark discord with you.

1920
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:05,500
Is this the discord pictures?

1921
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,340
Okay, okay.

1922
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:09,100
Yeah, it's whatever we put in there.

1923
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:12,820
It will use whatever we have to open it.

1924
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:14,380
So you don't have to change anything

1925
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:16,260
or add anything yourself.

1926
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,900
It will always be in there.

1927
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,420
How do I join with you?

1928
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:23,980
You just copy the group one.

1929
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:26,580
Group, got it, got it, got it, got it.

1930
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:30,620
And then you just add it as browser source.

1931
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:32,300
Oh my God, it says I have to be using

1932
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:36,540
the discord desktop app and I don't do that.

1933
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,500
I use it in my browser.

1934
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,660
You do?

1935
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:44,180
You use the discord browser?

1936
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:45,140
What'd I do?

1937
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,740
That's funny.

1938
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:48,060
It's just what I do.

1939
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:51,220
I can still try to use it.

1940
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:52,740
I can still try to use it.

1941
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:55,860
Does it still work though?

1942
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:56,700
That's weird.

1943
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:13,700
Is that gonna work?

1944
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:17,620
I forgot I figured that out.

1945
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:19,580
I stole this animation from Azura.

1946
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:23,900
Oh.

1947
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,300
What'd you steal from me?

1948
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:31,140
Nothing.

1949
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,460
We mean nothing.

1950
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:34,700
What'd you steal from me?

1951
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:35,660
What'd you over there looking at?

1952
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:36,500
Nothing.

1953
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:39,420
What'd you steal from me?

1954
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:40,260
Mumble.

1955
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:44,820
I just copied a certain animation.

1956
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:51,020
I...

1957
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,260
Um...

1958
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:59,660
Yeah, this is not working.

1959
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:01,300
This is not working for me.

1960
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:05,140
Don't worry about it, we can still play.

1961
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:05,980
Okay.

1962
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,980
I give up, I couldn't figure it out.

1963
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,380
Okay.

1964
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:16,260
Maybe if I give you the link,

1965
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:19,260
can you still use the browser link that I give you?

1966
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:20,300
Oh, try it.

1967
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,860
We can see if that works.

1968
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:28,260
Yeah, that's what I tried and it doesn't work.

1969
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,780
It just shows a loading thing forever.

1970
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:33,100
I couldn't figure out the breath part though.

1971
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:40,820
The breath part is animated by the person who made it.

1972
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:42,540
Yeah, I know what you're doing.

1973
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:44,300
I see you there.

1974
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,660
You're naughty.

1975
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:49,860
I won't keep my eyes on you.

1976
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:52,060
Just throw the thumbnail in there.

1977
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:53,060
Oh, that's a good idea.

1978
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:54,380
That's a good idea.

1979
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:55,220
You want it?

1980
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:58,220
What the thumbnail?

1981
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:00,940
You want it?

1982
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:01,780
Don't...

1983
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:03,340
Why are you saying it like that?

1984
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:07,660
Yes, mommy, I want it so...

1985
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,220
Mommy, please, mommy.

1986
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:11,860
What?

1987
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:15,140
No.

1988
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:24,860
You're so lucky.

1989
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:27,620
Why, why, why?

1990
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:29,220
Why, uh...

1991
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:31,460
Stam is not working.

1992
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,620
And I'm not on your screen anymore.

1993
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,540
I added a really fun toggle.

1994
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:42,260
Oh, yeah.

1995
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,340
I added a really fun toggle.

1996
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:47,820
There, look, I've got everyone.

1997
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:49,980
Perfect.

1998
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:53,180
I need to make a toggle where I can take off my shabari ropes.

1999
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,780
There, I've got everyone now.

2000
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:09,020
You still thumbed out.

2001
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,780
I loved it.

2002
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:11,860
Yeah, there we go.

2003
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:13,300
OK, I'm ready, I'm ready.

2004
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,300
It's beautiful.

2005
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,300
It's all of us.

2006
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,300
Absolutely stunning.

2007
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,300
Oh, I love it.

2008
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:26,300
Oh, I also figured out, I have...

2009
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,300
Where is it?

2010
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,300
I have these eyes.

2011
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,300
And I didn't even know I had them.

2012
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,300
What do you mean you didn't know you had them?

2013
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:39,300
It didn't show up in any of my toggles.

2014
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:43,300
I was digging through the toggle files when I got my new tan toggle.

2015
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:48,300
And I was like, oh, where did this come from?

2016
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:54,300
I know a lot of them weren't set up as cue lines or even me.

2017
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,300
Yeah.

2018
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:56,300
Hello, I'm back.

2019
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,300
All right, are we ready?

2020
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:00,300
Yeah.

2021
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,300
Yeah.

2022
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:07,300
Yeah, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

2023
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:11,300
Turns out, I thought it was one of the black cats, whiskers.

2024
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:12,300
I named it whiskers.

2025
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,300
But there's a new cat.

2026
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:16,300
And I was like, oh, and she's so pretty.

2027
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:20,300
I was like, oh my God, I want to call you Sapphire.

2028
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:24,300
I'm basically now feeding nine cats.

2029
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,300
Oh my gosh.

2030
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:28,300
I'm a cat lady.

2031
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:30,300
We love it though.

2032
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,300
I aspire to be that level of cat lady.

2033
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:37,300
My Lord Apollo, leshing guys.

2034
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:39,300
I love cats, okay?

2035
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,300
Where you going lady?

2036
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:42,300
Yeah, it's this way.

2037
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:43,300
Don't go that way.

2038
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,300
She's like, let's go that way.

2039
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:45,300
Where am I going?

2040
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:46,300
Where am I going?

2041
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:47,300
She'll go that way.

2042
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,300
Oh, shit.

2043
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:49,300
Oh, shit.

2044
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:50,300
This way.

2045
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,300
Is there, are you ready?

2046
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,300
We're starting.

2047
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,300
We're going, we're going.

2048
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:54,300
She's not ready.

2049
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,300
Stop.

2050
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,300
Okay, ready, ready, ready, ready.

2051
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,300
Oh, okay.

2052
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:03,300
I'm very strong.

2053
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:09,300
Finger action is on point.

2054
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,300
Pinching forward.

2055
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:12,300
Very carefully.

2056
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:13,300
Okay.

2057
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:16,300
Oh.

2058
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,300
Just the, oh.

2059
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:28,300
Oh my God.

2060
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:30,300
Wait, what?

2061
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:32,300
This is not it.

2062
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,300
One at a time pulls the other's weight.

2063
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,300
It makes a lot of noise.

2064
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:38,300
Yeah.

2065
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:39,300
Okay.

2066
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,300
Oh my God.

2067
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:46,300
This is what breaks us, huh?

2068
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:48,300
Yeah.

2069
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:50,300
So close to the checkpoint.

2070
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:52,300
I'm completely mind broken at this point.

2071
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,300
It's a part of the old cat lady.

2072
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,300
Yes.

2073
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:05,300
What the hell is that?

2074
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,300
Is that you?

2075
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,300
Oh.

2076
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:13,300
Oh, I made it this time.

2077
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,300
Yay.

2078
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,300
Okay.

2079
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:16,300
Nice.

2080
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:20,300
I jump with one.

2081
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,300
Oh.

2082
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:25,300
Oh my gosh.

2083
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,300
Oh my gosh.

2084
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:29,300
Sometimes we may jump in like kind of different directions.

2085
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:30,300
It will gank you.

2086
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,300
So weird.

2087
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:32,300
Yeah.

2088
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,300
I mean, it's still kind of glitches through.

2089
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:35,300
So that's, oh my God.

2090
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:36,300
Yeah.

2091
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,300
Is that you?

2092
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:40,300
No, that's a circle.

2093
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,300
Oh.

2094
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:45,300
I would definitely make that noise though.

2095
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,300
Okay.

2096
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,300
Here we go.

2097
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:48,300
Here we go.

2098
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,300
Let's be careful and carefully make the jump.

2099
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,300
Okay.

2100
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,300
Careful jump.

2101
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:56,300
Okay, ready?

2102
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:59,300
One, two, three.

2103
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,300
You guys can, you can just fall onto it.

2104
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:06,300
I don't know for this one if you can do that though.

2105
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:08,300
This one we can jump.

2106
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:10,300
One, two, three.

2107
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,300
Nope, you can't.

2108
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:15,300
So I figured out you can't.

2109
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,300
Okay.

2110
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,300
Okay.

2111
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:33,300
I feel like I'm playing Elden Ring.

2112
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:40,300
I've been waiting this entire time for like a boss monster to come out and do this.

2113
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:43,300
Totally depressed.

2114
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:45,300
What is happening?

2115
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:48,300
I tried to jump and it didn't jump.

2116
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,300
Oh my God.

2117
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:54,300
Oh, I was not paying attention at all.

2118
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,300
Okay.

2119
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:59,300
How could this happen to me?

2120
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,300
How could this happen to me?

2121
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:04,300
I remember seeing me when I said I was worried about you.

2122
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:05,300
I remember seeing me.

2123
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,300
What?

2124
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,300
What are you saying?

2125
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,300
What?

2126
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,300
No, I didn't hear you.

2127
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,300
What?

2128
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:16,300
I said remember seeing me and I was worried about you and you're like, I shouldn't have been worried about you.

2129
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:17,300
That wasn't even me.

2130
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,300
That wasn't even me.

2131
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,300
I'm letting you dangle there for that.

2132
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,300
No, don't pull her up for it.

2133
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:25,300
Whatever, I'm leaving.

2134
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,300
I'll pull her up so she has to make the jump.

2135
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:34,300
We were never making it past this point.

2136
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,300
Where the fuck am I?

2137
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:44,300
He just jumped off.

2138
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:45,300
Oh, nice.

2139
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,300
Thank you so much for the raid.

2140
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:50,300
Welcome in.

2141
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:53,300
Do the lighting change.

2142
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:09,300
My cat is behind my monitor.

2143
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:11,300
Reina, why have you betrayed me?

2144
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,300
Okay, this time we've got it.

2145
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,300
This is the one.

2146
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:19,300
I am the one.

2147
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:25,300
I didn't touch it.

2148
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:29,300
I didn't touch it.

2149
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:33,300
I'm killing myself.

2150
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,300
I'm hanging myself right here.

2151
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,300
Hello.

2152
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:44,300
Hello and goodbye if you come and left or if you're just coming in.

2153
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:45,300
Okay, ready?

2154
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:47,300
Yeah, it's actually Reina this time.

2155
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:48,300
Go.

2156
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:49,300
Go, go, go.

2157
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:52,300
Oh.

2158
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:56,300
I can't slip and fall.

2159
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:57,300
No.

2160
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:05,300
You fucking suck.

2161
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,300
How can you do that?

2162
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:10,300
You can't slip and fall and I said it and boom.

2163
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,300
It works.

2164
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:18,300
I didn't see anybody land on that that time.

2165
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,300
That was weird on my screen.

2166
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:21,300
I think it's never good.

2167
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,300
Never get up.

2168
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:24,300
Never get up.

2169
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:25,300
Never get up.

2170
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:28,300
Speed run, speed run, speed run, speed run.

2171
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:30,300
Speed run, speed run.

2172
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:34,300
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2173
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,300
Perfect.

2174
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:36,300
Look to the other side.

2175
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,300
Look to the other side.

2176
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:38,300
We got this.

2177
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:39,300
We got this.

2178
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,300
Hello, family.

2179
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:42,300
You're not alone.

2180
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:43,300
What?

2181
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:45,300
Nobody jumped.

2182
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,300
Nobody jumped.

2183
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:49,300
I was like...

2184
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:54,300
Oh, hey, we're fine.

2185
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:55,300
Can I?

2186
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:58,300
I mean, might as well just go to the checkpoint, man.

2187
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:00,300
No, no, we don't from here.

2188
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:01,300
We don't from here.

2189
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:03,300
And then we go back on the one that we missed.

2190
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:06,300
It's all right.

2191
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,300
We're good.

2192
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:08,300
We're good.

2193
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:09,300
We're good.

2194
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,300
I literally can't pull a Zer up unless I'm looking at her.

2195
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:14,300
That's so weird.

2196
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,300
So if I'm looking this way, I can't just pull.

2197
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:20,300
I think you're supposed to be looking at them to pull them.

2198
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:21,300
I had to...

2199
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:22,300
Okay, ready?

2200
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:23,300
Go!

2201
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:26,300
Why did my space bar not work?

2202
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,300
Oh, hey, we're back.

2203
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:31,300
Never mind.

2204
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,300
I'm a wizard.

2205
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:36,300
I'm a wizard, guys.

2206
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:37,300
Shit.

2207
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:41,300
I wish to be a wizard right now and inhaling those fumes.

2208
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:43,300
Go!

2209
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:50,300
Okay, this is the last one and then I have to go.

2210
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:51,300
Okay.

2211
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:54,300
I can only do two hours, but this is the one we're going to make it.

2212
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:57,300
We're making it.

2213
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:58,300
We're making it.

2214
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,300
We're making it for one.

2215
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,300
I can feel it.

2216
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:04,300
Perfect technique.

2217
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:05,300
Beautiful.

2218
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,300
Ready?

2219
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:08,300
Ready?

2220
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:10,300
And jump!

2221
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,300
Ready?

2222
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,300
I was too excited.

2223
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,300
Thank you.

2224
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,300
I'm locked in.

2225
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:25,300
No.

2226
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:26,300
Okay, okay, okay.

2227
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:28,300
Look at that.

2228
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:31,300
If I save right there, will it be saved?

2229
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:32,300
No.

2230
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,300
We're going to make the logs.

2231
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:35,300
Damn.

2232
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,300
Okay, yeah, we've got to make it to the next checkpoint.

2233
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,300
We've got this.

2234
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:39,300
I can't...

2235
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:40,300
Oh, hello.

2236
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:41,300
Thank you so much for the raid.

2237
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:42,300
Hi.

2238
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:43,300
Hello.

2239
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,300
Hi.

2240
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:52,300
Oh, my gosh.

2241
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,300
Okay, this one you can just fall onto.

2242
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:55,300
Okay.

2243
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:56,300
Let's try.

2244
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:57,300
I don't think so.

2245
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,300
It's too far.

2246
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,300
I think you have to do a jump.

2247
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:01,300
Yeah, you can do a small jump.

2248
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,300
Small jump.

2249
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:03,300
Oh, no.

2250
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,300
Okay, let me up.

2251
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:05,300
Is there a...

2252
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:06,300
Is there a...

2253
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,300
It's because you pulled me down.

2254
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:10,300
I didn't even fall.

2255
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:12,300
What are you talking about?

2256
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:13,300
Oh, so you do fall.

2257
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,300
You do fall.

2258
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:15,300
Okay.

2259
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:16,300
You do fall.

2260
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:17,300
You've got to fall.

2261
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,300
You've got to fall.

2262
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,300
Just fall and then climb.

2263
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:20,300
Oh, my God.

2264
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:21,300
Oh, me.

2265
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,300
Okay.

2266
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:24,300
So it is a fall thing.

2267
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:26,300
It is a fall thing.

2268
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,300
Okay, I think we figured it out.

2269
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:30,300
We figured it out.

2270
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:32,300
No more jumping when we get to the wood part.

2271
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:35,300
You just fall and then climb.

2272
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:36,300
Okay, one more.

2273
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,300
This is it.

2274
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:38,300
This is the one.

2275
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:39,300
No.

2276
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:40,300
I'm killing us all.

2277
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:41,300
Come with me.

2278
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:42,300
No.

2279
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:43,300
Come on.

2280
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:44,300
Death.

2281
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:45,300
Here we go.

2282
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:46,300
Death.

2283
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,300
I'm sorry to follow.

2284
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:48,300
Goodbye.

2285
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:49,300
No.

2286
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:53,300
How are you able to pull us all up the one time?

2287
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:57,300
We're trying to kill ourselves, but then when we're trying to stay on, we all fall.

2288
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:58,300
I have no idea.

2289
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:02,300
I think it's because I'm on a flat platform and it's long enough.

2290
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:03,300
Oh, that makes sense.

2291
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:04,300
Hey, make a triangle.

2292
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:06,300
This game is terrible.

2293
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:09,300
Okay.

2294
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:10,300
This is it.

2295
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:11,300
This is the last one.

2296
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:12,300
This is it.

2297
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:13,300
This is the last one.

2298
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,300
Okay.

2299
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:16,300
We're almost at the two hour mark.

2300
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:18,300
Oh, my God.

2301
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,300
It fell.

2302
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:22,300
Do not fall.

2303
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,300
We got this.

2304
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:24,300
We got this.

2305
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:25,300
We got this.

2306
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:27,300
Here we go.

2307
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,300
Perfect.

2308
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,300
Oh, we're amazing.

2309
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:30,300
Okay.

2310
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:31,300
Okay.

2311
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:32,300
Okay.

2312
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:33,300
Okay.

2313
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:35,300
Ready and jump.

2314
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,300
Oh, my God.

2315
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:38,300
Okay.

2316
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,300
Okay.

2317
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:40,300
Okay.

2318
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:41,300
He saved me.

2319
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:42,300
He saved me.

2320
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:43,300
I got too pale.

2321
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:44,300
I got too orange.

2322
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:45,300
Okay.

2323
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:46,300
Over here.

2324
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:48,300
And jump this way.

2325
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:49,300
Okay.

2326
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:54,300
We made it.

2327
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,300
Yeah.

2328
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,300
Apollo.

2329
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:57,300
Hello.

2330
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:58,300
Okay.

2331
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:59,300
Okay.

2332
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:00,300
No, chunky wide.

2333
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:01,300
Yay.

2334
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:02,300
Okay.

2335
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:05,300
Jump on the first one and just fall on the second.

2336
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:06,300
Okay.

2337
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:07,300
I thought it was fall.

2338
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:09,300
Fall on the first one and jump on both of them.

2339
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,300
Both of them.

2340
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,300
I did fall.

2341
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:12,300
Okay.

2342
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:13,300
You can just fall.

2343
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:14,300
Okay.

2344
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,300
Yeah.

2345
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,300
You want to fall.

2346
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:17,300
Okay.

2347
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:18,300
I'm backing up.

2348
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:19,300
Shit.

2349
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,300
I couldn't make it back to the platform.

2350
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:23,300
I was trying to back up to the platform.

2351
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:24,300
Okay.

2352
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:29,300
I don't know why I fell and then I clicked like space bar to climb up.

2353
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:30,300
God.

2354
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:31,300
Okay.

2355
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:32,300
That was not the one.

2356
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:33,300
That was not the one.

2357
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:34,300
I'm killing us.

2358
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:35,300
Damn it.

2359
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:36,300
I'm killing us.

2360
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:37,300
Come here.

2361
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,300
No, we're killing us.

2362
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:39,300
It's over.

2363
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:40,300
It's done.

2364
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,300
It's over.

2365
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:42,300
It's over.

2366
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:43,300
It's over.

2367
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:44,300
It's over.

2368
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:45,300
It's over.

2369
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:46,300
It's over.

2370
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:47,300
It's over.

2371
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:48,300
It's over.

2372
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:49,300
It's over.

2373
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,300
It's over.

2374
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:51,300
It's over.

2375
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:52,300
It's over.

2376
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,300
It's over.

2377
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:54,300
It's over.

2378
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:55,300
It's over.

2379
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:56,300
It's over.

2380
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:57,300
It's over.

2381
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:58,300
It's over.

2382
02:00:58,300 --> 02:00:59,300
It's over.

2383
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:00,300
It's over.

2384
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:01,300
That's happening here.

2385
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,300
It's a game.

2386
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,300
We can end here.

2387
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,300
We can end here.

2388
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:05,300
Okay.

2389
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:07,300
Thank you so much for having me, guys.

2390
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:08,300
I had so much fun

2391
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:09,300
and I lost so much sanity.

2392
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:10,300
I don't ever want to play this game again.

2393
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:11,300
I did have a lot of fun.

2394
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:12,300
This.

2395
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:13,300
This was fun.

2396
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:14,300
Oh, this was good.

2397
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:15,300
I'm out of lunch, mom.

2398
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:16,300
I didn't play this as straw.

2399
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:17,300
This would be fun to play as straw.

2400
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:18,300
They're her Scottish rage.

2401
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,300
Good luck.

2402
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:20,300
Good luck.

2403
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:23,540
take bets on who's gonna throw up first when you're playing this when you're

2404
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:29,140
drunk. Oh my god. Azora, I'm putting my bets on you.

2405
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:32,300
Well, me. I'm gonna play with you first.

2406
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:37,300
Yeah, I think so. How are we dying?

2407
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:39,300
Yes, damn it.

2408
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:41,300
You're slowly trying to kill us, sir.

2409
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:44,300
No.

2410
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:47,300
Let me die. Let me die.

2411
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:50,300
I'm ending it. Why am I on top of that?

2412
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:52,300
Thank you.

2413
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:05,300
Oh, now they want to die. No, I'm not letting it happen.

2414
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:07,300
I'm not letting this happen.

2415
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:10,300
No, I get to die in our own terms.

2416
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:13,300
It's my terms we get to die on.

2417
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:20,300
Wee.

2418
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:28,300
Wee. This is actually nice.

2419
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,300
This is pretty nice.

2420
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:35,300
Oh, fuck. Get me out of here. Get me out of here.

2421
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:37,300
Get me out of here. Get me out of here.

2422
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,300
Get me out of here.

2423
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:43,300
Oh my god. I'm leaving.

2424
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:45,300
Leaving the game.

2425
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:48,300
Get me out of here.

2426
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:51,300
I'm still on the call.

2427
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:55,300
Why am I all the way down here?

2428
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:05,300
Let me turn that down a little bit.

2429
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:07,300
Hey.

2430
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:11,300
Did you guys enjoy?

2431
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:18,300
That was fun. I actually like that game a lot.

2432
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:21,300
I definitely want to play it with Stradi.

2433
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:24,300
It was going to be so funny. I miss you guys too.

2434
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,300
I miss you guys so much.

2435
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:29,300
Did you guys like my little surprise?

2436
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:31,300
Yeah, blue.

2437
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:33,300
Yeah, blue.

2438
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:36,300
Did you guys like my little surprise?

2439
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:38,300
Yeah, blue.

2440
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:41,300
And then you got tan toggle.

2441
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:44,300
Although I kind of go blackface for a second.

2442
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:47,300
Sometimes it happens. Sometimes it doesn't.

2443
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:54,300
Yeah, see that time I didn't do it.

2444
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:56,300
It's funny.

2445
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,300
I locked my true form.

2446
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:00,300
Yeah, I'll be honest with you.

2447
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:02,300
So normally it looks like this

2448
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:04,300
and I don't like the colors

2449
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:06,300
because I just look like a red orc.

2450
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:08,300
So I fixed it myself.

2451
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:10,300
I'm like, this isn't tan. This is red.

2452
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:12,300
But it colored my ears the way I wanted.

2453
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,300
So because I'm...

2454
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:17,300
This looks like I have a sunburn.

2455
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:20,300
Yeah, it looks so red.

2456
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:22,300
So I asked for less red undertones.

2457
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:24,300
But I was just like, whatever, I'll do it myself.

2458
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:27,300
I'll do it myself.

2459
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:30,300
And then I have my cover up coming.

2460
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:32,300
I actually like it with the red eyes.

2461
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:34,300
I thought I would like it with the blue eyes more.

2462
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:36,300
But I like it with the red eyes.

2463
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:42,300
Now we just need tan lines.

2464
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:44,300
Oh yeah, where all my shabari is.

2465
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:46,300
I could actually probably do that

2466
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:48,300
and make my shabari...

2467
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:50,300
Like initially my shabari was lighter.

2468
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,300
The shadows because of the underlying part of the model.

2469
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:54,300
I don't know if you guys noticed,

2470
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:56,300
my hair color changes too.

2471
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:58,300
And I change the toggle.

2472
02:04:58,300 --> 02:05:00,300
My hair gets lighter.

2473
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:02,300
Because it looks...

2474
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,300
I think it looks a little bit better

2475
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:06,300
with lighter blonde hair.

2476
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:08,300
I'm a sucker for white hair and dark skin.

2477
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:10,300
I'll be honest with you.

2478
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:12,300
Although this is a little bit darker than I am.

2479
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:13,300
But I like...

2480
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:15,300
I probably would be more of a Zura's color

2481
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,300
and then she would be more of my color.

2482
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:19,300
But you know, we can always figure that out.

2483
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:24,300
Strawberry blond.

2484
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:26,300
Look at that, I just dye my hair.

2485
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:30,300
That's Madam Secret.

2486
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:32,300
I dye my hair...

2487
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:34,300
red at the ends.

2488
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:37,300
Don't tell anyone.

2489
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:41,300
I'm naturally just normally blonde.

2490
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:45,300
I'm a freaking Valyrian from House of the Dragon.

2491
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:47,300
But let's talk.

2492
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:49,300
How are you guys doing?

2493
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:51,300
How are you guys feeling?

2494
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,300
Let me look at my donos and stuff.

2495
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:55,300
I wanted to give you guys more attention

2496
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:57,300
for my first stream back.

2497
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:59,300
But I wasn't able to do that.

2498
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:01,300
So I apologize.

2499
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:03,300
Let's see.

2500
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:05,300
Thank you guys for all the remembers.

2501
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:07,300
That's so nice.

2502
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:09,300
I saw it like this.

2503
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:11,300
I figured out what we're doing

2504
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:13,300
for the monthly.

2505
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:15,300
I'm not telling you yet.

2506
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:17,300
Hee hee hee.

2507
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:21,300
Thank you Grumbo for the $50 tip.

2508
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:23,300
I can't stay for your return stream.

2509
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:25,300
Take this and feel better.

2510
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:27,300
That sounds so bad.

2511
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:29,300
Take my money.

2512
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:31,300
Feel better.

2513
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:33,300
I actually feel...

2514
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,300
Somebody in my Twitter comments recommended

2515
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,300
this thing called Vertagon.

2516
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:39,300
That they said that they're family member use.

2517
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:41,300
So I'm like fuck it.

2518
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:43,300
And I bought it on Amazon.

2519
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,300
And it's actually really good.

2520
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:47,300
I feel a lot better after only taking one pill.

2521
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,300
It's like a little supplement.

2522
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:51,300
I was falling over myself

2523
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:53,300
at the grocery store with my mom.

2524
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:55,300
She had to study me a couple of times.

2525
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:57,300
I keep making myself bigger.

2526
02:06:57,300 --> 02:06:59,300
Thank you for the remembers.

2527
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:01,300
I'm going to call them remembers.

2528
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:03,300
Reherums.

2529
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:05,300
R-X-S-E-J.

2530
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:07,300
Thank you Mr. Black.

2531
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,300
Silence. Appreciate you guys.

2532
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:11,300
I miss you guys a lot.

2533
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:13,300
Let me...

2534
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:15,300
What the heck's going on in my stream?

2535
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:17,300
It's like showing me stuff from like five minutes ago.

2536
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:21,300
You look amazing as always.

2537
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:23,300
Thank you darling.

2538
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:25,300
Thank you.

2539
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,300
Yeah, I don't know if...

2540
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:29,300
I wonder if people

2541
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:31,300
will be mad that I'm brown

2542
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:33,300
or like...

2543
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:35,300
Although it's funny because when I do my toggles

2544
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:37,300
I forgot...

2545
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:51,300
So that's top audio was muted.

2546
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:53,300
But oh my goodness.

2547
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:55,300
What the hell?

2548
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:57,300
Um...

2549
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:59,300
Uh...

2550
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:01,300
Thank you Doki.

2551
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:03,300
For the two hundo.

2552
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,300
That was...

2553
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:07,300
I didn't expect that.

2554
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:09,300
Why are you guys so nice to me?

2555
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:11,300
I don't understand.

2556
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:13,300
I don't deserve this.

2557
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:15,300
Stop!

2558
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:17,300
I'm tired.

2559
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:19,300
Don't give me your money.

2560
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,300
Oh...

2561
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:23,300
I miss my hundo so much.

2562
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:25,300
Toggle is beautiful.

2563
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:27,300
I'm so happy to see you streaming it.

2564
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:29,300
I know. I'm so glad to be back.

2565
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:31,300
I was dying.

2566
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:33,300
I was going to stream again this morning.

2567
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:35,300
Um...

2568
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:37,300
Just for us.

2569
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:39,300
My mom was like, oh, let's take you to the grocery store.

2570
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,300
So I like...

2571
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:43,300
Didn't do that. And then my mom's like, oh, I'm going to be late.

2572
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:45,300
And I'm like, great.

2573
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:47,300
I'm just strafing mom.

2574
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:49,300
What the hell, mother?

2575
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:51,300
Um...

2576
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:53,300
But she says hi. She says...

2577
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:55,300
She's very thankful you guys have been taking care of me.

2578
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:57,300
Because I was telling you guys...

2579
02:08:57,300 --> 02:08:59,300
Telling her about that you guys got me like...

2580
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:01,300
So my mom's like, oh, do you need any like...

2581
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:03,300
Um...

2582
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,300
Gatorade? I'm like, sorry.

2583
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:07,300
They bought me PDLI.

2584
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:09,300
And my mom's like, oh, do you need this?

2585
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:11,300
I'm like, oh, they bought me curtains.

2586
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:13,300
She's like, what the hell?

2587
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:15,300
And I'm like, I don't...

2588
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:17,300
I don't know what they do to deserve it.

2589
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:19,300
They're just so kind to me.

2590
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:21,300
And I love it. And I appreciate it.

2591
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:23,300
Yeah, I got some groceries.

2592
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:25,300
I spent quite a bit of change on groceries.

2593
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:27,300
But...

2594
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,300
Definitely I hadn't gone grocery shopping in like...

2595
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:31,300
Two months.

2596
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:33,300
I would get...

2597
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:35,300
A few things here or there.

2598
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:37,300
But I just never like actually went full on grocery shopping.

2599
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:39,300
I got a crustables.

2600
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,300
Although I forgot to...

2601
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:45,300
Get some things. So I need to run to the store tomorrow, probably.

2602
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:47,300
She didn't even pay for it, literally.

2603
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:49,300
I was just like talking to her.

2604
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,300
I'm like, yeah, I finally got the um...

2605
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:53,300
Little set for the balcony that I wanted.

2606
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:55,300
The patio set.

2607
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:57,300
My mom's like, oh, that's nice.

2608
02:09:57,300 --> 02:09:59,300
And I'm like, oh, yeah, harem got that for me.

2609
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,300
And she's just like...

2610
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:03,300
What?

2611
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,300
And I'm like, yeah, she's like...

2612
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:07,300
Cheebie, that was a lot of money.

2613
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:09,300
And I'm like, I don't know what the...

2614
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:11,300
She's like...

2615
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:13,300
Are you sure it's only audio you're doing?

2616
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:15,300
I'm like, mom.

2617
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:17,300
I'm only doing audio.

2618
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:21,300
Incrustables tier list stream?

2619
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:23,300
Oh, yeah, I should probably do that.

2620
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:25,300
That'd be a good idea.

2621
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:27,300
Whoo!

2622
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:29,300
So eepy.

2623
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:31,300
Although I slept a couple of times today,

2624
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:33,300
but I was kind of off and on...

2625
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,300
A week since...

2626
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:37,300
What's it called?

2627
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:39,300
What's it called?

2628
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:41,300
Since this morning.

2629
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:43,300
Let me fix my freaking eyeballs.

2630
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:45,300
But thank you so much, Doki.

2631
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:47,300
Does Mama Cotton Bomb want anything?

2632
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:49,300
Mama Cotton...

2633
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:51,300
I was gonna buy her...

2634
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:53,300
Because she got some groceries too while she was with me.

2635
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:55,300
And I was gonna buy her groceries for her.

2636
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:57,300
My mom is a very proud woman

2637
02:10:57,300 --> 02:10:59,300
and she doesn't like taking things.

2638
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:01,300
And she's just like...

2639
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:03,300
I feel weird you buying my groceries,

2640
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:05,300
so I'm buying for my own.

2641
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:07,300
You literally don't have a job right now,

2642
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:09,300
and you've taken care of me my entire life,

2643
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:11,300
so let me just take care of you.

2644
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:13,300
And she's still refused.

2645
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:15,300
Um...

2646
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:17,300
My dad...

2647
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:19,300
My mom, like, ridiculed my dad

2648
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:21,300
because she's just like, well, you know how your dad is.

2649
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:23,300
He's always asking you to buy him takeout

2650
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:25,300
and get him that expensive bourbon.

2651
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:27,300
She's like, that's fine.

2652
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:29,300
And I'm like, oh my god.

2653
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:31,300
She's...

2654
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:33,300
My mom's just not like that.

2655
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:35,300
She's worked hard for everything,

2656
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:37,300
so she's very proud like that.

2657
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:39,300
That's... I aim to be just like her.

2658
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:41,300
And my dad's like, oh!

2659
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:43,300
My dad calls you my minions.

2660
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,300
He's like,

2661
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:47,300
so your minions get the hook up?

2662
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:49,300
Can they get me that bourbon?

2663
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:51,300
I'm like, dad, that bourbon was $2,000.

2664
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:53,300
I finally looked at the price.

2665
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,300
I didn't look up the price before,

2666
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:57,300
and I'm like, you wanted my people

2667
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:59,300
to buy a $2,000 bottle for you?

2668
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:01,300
No!

2669
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:03,300
That's just so fine!

2670
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:05,300
He's like, I don't know.

2671
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:07,300
I didn't know the type of money you were making.

2672
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:09,300
I don't know. I don't know.

2673
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:11,300
And I'm like, dad.

2674
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:13,300
No, I'm not going to ask them to do that.

2675
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:15,300
I'm like, you haven't even come on the stream yet

2676
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:17,300
and you expect them to catch you.

2677
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:19,300
He's like, okay, you're right.

2678
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:25,300
I'm doing okay.

2679
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:27,300
I'm still a little dizzy.

2680
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:29,300
Actually, that stream wasn't as bad as I thought it would be

2681
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:31,300
in terms of my dizziness.

2682
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:33,300
But I woke up fine this morning

2683
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:35,300
and I'm like, oh, yeah, it's probably gone.

2684
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:37,300
And then as I kind of move throughout the day,

2685
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:39,300
if I move too much,

2686
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:41,300
if I move my head, I get dizzy.

2687
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:43,300
So I think because I'm just moving my eyes

2688
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:45,300
and I'm not moving my head,

2689
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:47,300
because I'm not turning my head to look at the screen,

2690
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:49,300
I'm just using my eyes,

2691
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:51,300
then it makes it a lot easier.

2692
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:53,300
Although, when I was doing this

2693
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:55,300
as a joke a couple of times,

2694
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,300
I was like, whoa!

2695
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:59,300
How's Fia doing?

2696
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:01,300
So it seems like Fia has...

2697
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:03,300
So if you don't know, let me explain

2698
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:05,300
what's going on with Fia.

2699
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:07,300
So Fia is my cat.

2700
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:09,300
She is a little over a year old.

2701
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,300
She's like a year and a month or two.

2702
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,300
She is my female...

2703
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:15,300
One of my female classmates cat.

2704
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:17,300
She's adorable.

2705
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:19,300
This past March,

2706
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:21,300
randomly,

2707
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:23,300
I was...

2708
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:25,300
This has happened during my PL

2709
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:27,300
my past life,

2710
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:29,300
as Rina.

2711
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:31,300
She

2712
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:33,300
randomly,

2713
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:35,300
the day of one of my

2714
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:37,300
birthday event,

2715
02:13:37,300 --> 02:13:39,300
she randomly couldn't walk,

2716
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:41,300
so I had to cancel it.

2717
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,300
And I was wondering,

2718
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:45,300
she was plopping her feet

2719
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:47,300
and she couldn't pick up her back legs.

2720
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:49,300
So we literally did

2721
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:51,300
so many X-rays and scans

2722
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:53,300
and ultrasounds.

2723
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:55,300
I don't know if she had a surgery

2724
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:57,300
or if she had a neurological issue.

2725
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:59,300
No, she's totally fine.

2726
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:01,300
They literally couldn't find anything wrong with her.

2727
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:03,300
They have no idea. They did blood work.

2728
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:05,300
All her blood work came back normal.

2729
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:07,300
But she couldn't walk.

2730
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:09,300
She couldn't move her back legs.

2731
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:11,300
And then eventually it became her front legs.

2732
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:13,300
And then she couldn't move her body or her tail.

2733
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:15,300
So she was literally just paralyzed.

2734
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:17,300
And I had to bring her to the bathroom.

2735
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:19,300
There's like a clip someone took of me.

2736
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:21,300
And I'm like, sorry,

2737
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:23,300
so she can shit because she couldn't posture.

2738
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:27,300
And I would carry...

2739
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,300
Fiya's very good at communicating.

2740
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,300
So she has a little bed that I would put her in

2741
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:33,300
and I would just carry her around the bed

2742
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:35,300
and I'd bring over her litter box.

2743
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,300
She meow, no.

2744
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:39,300
Or I'd bring her over to the food and she wouldn't meow.

2745
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:41,300
So that means I just set her down so she wants to eat.

2746
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:43,300
So she was very good at telling me what she wanted.

2747
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:45,300
I gave her medication every day.

2748
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:47,300
She was on three different medications.

2749
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:49,300
And finally,

2750
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:51,300
when she got her on an antibiotic,

2751
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:53,300
she saw a plethora of doctors,

2752
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:55,300
thousands of dollars in vet bills

2753
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:57,300
that I'm still trying to pay off.

2754
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:01,300
Yes, for a month,

2755
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:03,300
almost three months,

2756
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:05,300
I was literally waiting on her hand and foot.

2757
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:07,300
I was another reason why I went on a mental leave

2758
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:09,300
because I couldn't take the toll

2759
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:11,300
because she hadn't even turned a year yet

2760
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:13,300
and I thought I was going to have to put my cat down.

2761
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:15,300
So it was really tough.

2762
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:17,300
And I love her to death.

2763
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:19,300
I just want her to fucking live to her first year.

2764
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:21,300
That's all I want.

2765
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:23,300
And then when I was

2766
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:25,300
accepted to be a lawyer, I literally was like,

2767
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:27,300
oh my god, thank you fucking,

2768
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:29,300
thank you universe for this.

2769
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:31,300
And then,

2770
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:33,300
Stroni was just like, I'll pay for stuff.

2771
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,300
I'll do this, I'll do that.

2772
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:37,300
I was like, nah, but she did help me

2773
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:39,300
with a bill.

2774
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:41,300
So I've already paid her back.

2775
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:43,300
But I was just very appreciative

2776
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:45,300
of that.

2777
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:47,300
And it's happening again.

2778
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:49,300
She can't move her back legs.

2779
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,300
So her body is slowly just

2780
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:53,300
not being able to

2781
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:55,300
support her.

2782
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:57,300
So she can't walk.

2783
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:59,300
She'll try, she'll like kind of drag herself

2784
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,300
towards me

2785
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:03,300
because she wants to be picked up.

2786
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:05,300
That's why I get the big stretch

2787
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:07,300
because I would have to do physical therapy

2788
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:09,300
because her muscles started to atrophy

2789
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,300
because she didn't move for like a month and a half.

2790
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:13,300
And she was so small

2791
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:15,300
and so tiny.

2792
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:17,300
I generally didn't think that she was going to make it.

2793
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:19,300
But she did.

2794
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:21,300
She got around these antibiotics

2795
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:23,300
because one doctor was like, oh, maybe she

2796
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,300
has this. I don't fucking know.

2797
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:27,300
And so we just threw shit at the wall

2798
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:29,300
and hope that it sticks.

2799
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:31,300
And it did. So I am hoping

2800
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,300
that

2801
02:16:33,300 --> 02:16:35,300
the antibiotics help her again.

2802
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:37,300
I don't know if she has some sort of viral thing

2803
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:39,300
that just like makes her shut down

2804
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:41,300
her ability to,

2805
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:43,300
I don't know any virus like that.

2806
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:45,300
The doctor said it could be toxoplasmosis

2807
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:47,300
which is why they have

2808
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:49,300
women who are pregnant

2809
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:51,300
not scoop litter boxes because

2810
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:53,300
humans can get it and like it's very

2811
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:55,300
dangerous.

2812
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:57,300
So I think

2813
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:59,300
they like they have no idea but they're like

2814
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:01,300
maybe she has that but they tested her

2815
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:03,300
for it and it didn't really come back for anything.

2816
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:05,300
But hey, it worked so

2817
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:07,300
we don't really care.

2818
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:09,300
So I already started her in the meds.

2819
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:11,300
The doctor and like

2820
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:13,300
I emailed her like in like 5am

2821
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:15,300
because I woke up because I just have

2822
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:17,300
like a fucking sixth sense about those

2823
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:19,300
things. And I noticed

2824
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:21,300
that Fia like was just

2825
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:23,300
stuck under the bed and that's where she is

2826
02:17:23,300 --> 02:17:25,300
now but she's on the edge

2827
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:27,300
so I can pull her out if I can like bring her

2828
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:29,300
to the litter box or bring her to the

2829
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:31,300
thing.

2830
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:33,300
But yeah, I'm very

2831
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:35,300
and that's why I have that crate is

2832
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:37,300
because I would have to crater when I left

2833
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:39,300
when I had to go to work or anything

2834
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:41,300
but I essentially

2835
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:43,300
was literally just being her caretaker

2836
02:17:43,300 --> 02:17:45,300
around the clock.

2837
02:17:45,300 --> 02:17:47,300
How long does it take for the meds to kick in? I have no idea.

2838
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:49,300
No clue.

2839
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:51,300
But I'm hoping it's soon.

2840
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:53,300
All I know is that

2841
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:55,300
she can be fixed, that she can be

2842
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:57,300
okay, that it is something

2843
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:59,300
that must flare up every once in a while.

2844
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:01,300
I'm thinking it might have happened

2845
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:03,300
because she was stressed that I was gone

2846
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:05,300
is my guess.

2847
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:07,300
Or I don't know if

2848
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:09,300
like

2849
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:11,300
my mom's like maybe like boomie

2850
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:13,300
like passes something along

2851
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:15,300
to her and like all the other cats are immune

2852
02:18:15,300 --> 02:18:17,300
but Fia and I'm like maybe she just

2853
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:19,300
like I'm pretty sure like Fia is just like immune

2854
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:21,300
no deficient.

2855
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:23,300
The foster mom

2856
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:25,300
because I rescued Fia from the south

2857
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:27,300
from like Mississippi so that's

2858
02:18:27,300 --> 02:18:29,300
why I get that Mississippi joke a lot.

2859
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,300
I'm getting dizzy a little bit.

2860
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:35,300
She said her sister

2861
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:37,300
passed away from complications

2862
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:39,300
because she couldn't move and so I'm wondering

2863
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:41,300
if it's like a congenital thing

2864
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:43,300
or she was born with this condition.

2865
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:45,300
But yeah.

2866
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:47,300
But I gave

2867
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:49,300
her all the vet

2868
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:51,300
minus the vet pills because

2869
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:53,300
again you guys know how much I fucking

2870
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:55,300
know in vet pills. It's a lot.

2871
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:01,300
The vet like was literally

2872
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:03,300
what I like with the vet is she tried to

2873
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:05,300
cut corners for prices

2874
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:07,300
where she could. She like reduced a lot of pricing

2875
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:09,300
for me because she knew it was like really

2876
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:11,300
like again like thousands and thousands

2877
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:13,300
of dollars just to try to save my cat

2878
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:17,300
and

2879
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:19,300
yeah I'm wondering

2880
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:21,300
if like the stress of me being gone

2881
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:23,300
triggered it

2882
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:25,300
or something else or like

2883
02:19:25,300 --> 02:19:27,300
my mom was cleaning the litter box while I was gone

2884
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:29,300
so like the litter boxes weren't dirty

2885
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:31,300
so there couldn't be like a bacterial infection.

2886
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:33,300
They literally don't know

2887
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:35,300
it's not they don't think it's by food

2888
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:37,300
she doesn't seem allergic to anything.

2889
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:39,300
So many tests so much stuff.

2890
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:41,300
I'm sorry to dump that all on you

2891
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:43,300
but I just want to give you context

2892
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:45,300
as to kind of what I'm dealing with

2893
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:47,300
and I have been dealing with since March

2894
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,300
I'm just I am just

2895
02:19:49,300 --> 02:19:51,300
thankful that

2896
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,300
it can be sorted and that she can

2897
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:55,300
be fine and she can play and she can run

2898
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:57,300
and she can jump

2899
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:01,300
eventually and so I'm just gonna

2900
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:03,300
wait for that to happen

2901
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:05,300
I'm gonna hope that the antibiotics work

2902
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:07,300
and if not there are two other medications

2903
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:09,300
she was on that will probably all bring them all

2904
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:11,300
into rotation again

2905
02:20:11,300 --> 02:20:13,300
I'm just gonna tackle it. I will fight for Fia

2906
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:15,300
she is my baby

2907
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:17,300
she is my she

2908
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:19,300
was with Reina when Reina was sick. I still have to bring Reina

2909
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:21,300
to the vet because they're like oh yeah Reina might have cancer

2910
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:23,300
and I'm like fucking

2911
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:25,300
great like come on

2912
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:27,300
stop and then I'm motion sick and I can't even

2913
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:29,300
bring my cat to the vet

2914
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:31,300
I still think

2915
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:33,300
when my mom drove me today to get her meds

2916
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:35,300
um

2917
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:37,300
yeah it's just really

2918
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:39,300
shitty because my cats are my life they're all I have

2919
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:41,300
besides you guys and my family

2920
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:43,300
it just sucks

2921
02:20:43,300 --> 02:20:45,300
Reina I'm kind of

2922
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:47,300
may peace with because she's 14

2923
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:49,300
she already has a lot of health issues

2924
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:51,300
she's got kidney disease she's in my arms

2925
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:53,300
right now purring

2926
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:55,300
um

2927
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:57,300
why did you get sick all of a sudden and I think it was from traveling

2928
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:59,300
my mom was

2929
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:01,300
wondering if I got oh I have to tell you guys

2930
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:03,300
what happened I didn't tell you guys what happened

2931
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:05,300
to me I'm so sorry that I'm kind of just dumping

2932
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:07,300
this on you but

2933
02:21:07,300 --> 02:21:09,300
uh I haven't seen my therapist yet

2934
02:21:09,300 --> 02:21:11,300
so I'm just gonna tell you guys instead

2935
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:13,300
um

2936
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:15,300
yeah Reina's

2937
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:17,300
being a cutie on my lap I have to bring Reina

2938
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:19,300
to the vet to get her calcium check

2939
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:21,300
she either has a thyroid issue or she is cancer

2940
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:23,300
you better not have fucking cancer

2941
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:25,300
or I'll be pissed

2942
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:27,300
if she has cancer

2943
02:21:27,300 --> 02:21:29,300
I don't think she would be able to survive treatment

2944
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:31,300
so I don't want to put her through that

2945
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:33,300
we'll see

2946
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:35,300
um she's she was playing and running around

2947
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:37,300
today so I honestly

2948
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,300
she was eating a lot

2949
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:41,300
so I'm wondering if um this is like a

2950
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:43,300
thyroid issue because that just makes

2951
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:45,300
way more sense to me because it's

2952
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:47,300
just makes more sense with what else

2953
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,300
she's going on um

2954
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:51,300
I know literally

2955
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:53,300
the house and everything goes wrong uh

2956
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:55,300
and

2957
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:57,300
my mom said she noticed it

2958
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:59,300
that Fia was acting weird

2959
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:01,300
when my mom first came to visit she was checking

2960
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:03,300
on her she says she was very

2961
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:05,300
my cats are very friendly

2962
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:07,300
she's like Fia was hiding under the bed she didn't want

2963
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:09,300
to come out and she usually she only does

2964
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:11,300
that if she feels like she's

2965
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:13,300
not feeling good or she feels threatened

2966
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:15,300
like a cat doesn't want to be bothered

2967
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:17,300
and all that stuff so I'm like hmm interesting

2968
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:19,300
um but as for me

2969
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:21,300
uh yeah I

2970
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:25,300
traveling was a nightmare I died I

2971
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:27,300
I'm gonna have to do it again soon um

2972
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:29,300
and I don't want to do

2973
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:31,300
it I have to travel again like October

2974
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:33,300
I still don't know the dates for another

2975
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,300
thing another family thing

2976
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:37,300
I think that'll also

2977
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:39,300
be it won't be in Florida again but

2978
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:41,300
I just got really dizzy

2979
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:43,300
because I'm moving my head around

2980
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:45,300
looking for the cats um

2981
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:47,300
so yeah

2982
02:22:47,300 --> 02:22:49,300
I'll give you the rundown

2983
02:22:57,300 --> 02:22:59,300
so what was supposed to

2984
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:01,300
so I I didn't tell you guys

2985
02:23:01,300 --> 02:23:03,300
because I also didn't say a lot what was going on

2986
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:05,300
with me or talk about

2987
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:07,300
what was going on with me because I didn't want you guys to worry

2988
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:09,300
and I didn't just want to go on my twitter and

2989
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:11,300
just like be like my life sucks

2990
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:13,300
this happened that happened this

2991
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:15,300
happened um but I did have a layover

2992
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:17,300
um

2993
02:23:17,300 --> 02:23:19,300
an ATL if you guys just like be in

2994
02:23:19,300 --> 02:23:21,300
an airport um

2995
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:25,300
and to get to

2996
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:27,300
the place where I was going

2997
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:29,300
and what should have been

2998
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:31,300
like a quick flight

2999
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:33,300
afterwards

3000
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:35,300
turned out to be

3001
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:37,300
like four hours of waiting

3002
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:39,300
on a taxiway because I think

3003
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:41,300
around that time is when the stuff went down

3004
02:23:41,300 --> 02:23:43,300
but we didn't know that

3005
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:45,300
um yeah I hate that fucking airport

3006
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:47,300
I'll tell you that right now

3007
02:23:47,300 --> 02:23:49,300
um I hate airports

3008
02:23:49,300 --> 02:23:51,300
I hate crowds of people I like

3009
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:53,300
I get sick very easily

3010
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:55,300
and I'm surprised I didn't get sick

3011
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:57,300
I immediately took a shower

3012
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:59,300
when I got to my family's house

3013
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:01,300
and I was like I need to get this gross off me

3014
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:03,300
so I already had

3015
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:05,300
a few hours and then I had to wait

3016
02:24:05,300 --> 02:24:07,300
another few hours

3017
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:09,300
and I just hate I didn't have a direct flight

3018
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:11,300
so I'm just like I hate it here

3019
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:13,300
um

3020
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:15,300
and then I didn't get to my

3021
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:17,300
grandparents house until like

3022
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,300
3am because they couldn't come pick me up

3023
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:21,300
because they're older and they don't have the luxury

3024
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:23,300
of driving at night like I didn't want to put them

3025
02:24:23,300 --> 02:24:25,300
in that situation so I took me a while to

3026
02:24:25,300 --> 02:24:27,300
excuse me find me a

3027
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:29,300
ride I couldn't get a rental car

3028
02:24:29,300 --> 02:24:31,300
there's no rental cars available

3029
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:33,300
um

3030
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:35,300
and

3031
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:37,300
I managed to get an Uber and I

3032
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:39,300
dropped a good chunk of change on an Uber

3033
02:24:39,300 --> 02:24:41,300
so that was fun

3034
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:43,300
then I finally got there and I was half dead

3035
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:45,300
and then

3036
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:47,300
the weather was shit the majority of the time

3037
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:51,300
so I couldn't really do a lot

3038
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:53,300
there was like one sunny day

3039
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:55,300
and it was just gross and humid and I hated it

3040
02:24:57,300 --> 02:24:59,300
I think honestly the only funny thing

3041
02:24:59,300 --> 02:25:01,300
was when that frog somehow got in the house

3042
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:03,300
into the toilet

3043
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:05,300
it was fun catching it

3044
02:25:05,300 --> 02:25:07,300
because my whole family was like

3045
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:09,300
and I'm the only one that likes

3046
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:11,300
bugs and like amphibians

3047
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:13,300
and reptiles and invertebrates

3048
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:15,300
so I just like yanked it and I'm like

3049
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:17,300
you're mine you're gonna be my friend

3050
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:19,300
I was gonna kiss it

3051
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:21,300
and then my but my grandmother was

3052
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:23,300
freaking out so I didn't do that

3053
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:25,300
but our frog and a snake

3054
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:27,300
I've grabbed snakes before

3055
02:25:27,300 --> 02:25:29,300
um when I would go with my

3056
02:25:29,300 --> 02:25:31,300
I've mentioned my grandfather before when I would go

3057
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:33,300
in the woods my grandfather I snatched a snake up

3058
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:35,300
and like I know I know my snakes

3059
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:37,300
so I know one one's poisonous

3060
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:39,300
and one's not

3061
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,300
it was like a little rat snake that I

3062
02:25:41,300 --> 02:25:43,300
snatched and I was like

3063
02:25:47,300 --> 02:25:49,300
frog was cannon

3064
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:51,300
and so yeah I put the frog outside

3065
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:53,300
somebody was like flush it I'm like

3066
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:55,300
what that's just messed up

3067
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:57,300
and I'm not gonna flush a frog down the toilet

3068
02:25:57,300 --> 02:25:59,300
although I know that's where you crawled up from

3069
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:01,300
but it was it was really weird

3070
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:03,300
I felt something wet on my butt cheek

3071
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:05,300
um it was because

3072
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:07,300
the frog was behind the seat

3073
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:09,300
and it was like trying to get away from my fat ass

3074
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:11,300
I was just gonna sit on it

3075
02:26:11,300 --> 02:26:13,300
um

3076
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:15,300
so I left it outside

3077
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:17,300
that was me my pet

3078
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:21,300
I was about to drop some heat too I was like

3079
02:26:21,300 --> 02:26:23,300
I was about to blow that shit up

3080
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:25,300
that's probably what it died

3081
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:29,300
cause I get really sick after it cause I get

3082
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:31,300
motion sick and the motion sick makes me nauseous

3083
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:33,300
and the nauseous gives me tummy upset

3084
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:35,300
and that was just a bad thing

3085
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:37,300
um and then so I finally

3086
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:39,300
like we're hanging out whatever

3087
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:41,300
is fine but I was so

3088
02:26:41,300 --> 02:26:43,300
tired and I felt so

3089
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:45,300
crappy the entire time

3090
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:47,300
that we couldn't really do anything so I literally

3091
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:49,300
just like watched Elden Ring videos

3092
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:51,300
and I forgot my switch

3093
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:53,300
and I was pissed cause

3094
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:55,300
like my family likes to play like Mario Party

3095
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:57,300
when we're all together like that was our thing

3096
02:26:57,300 --> 02:26:59,300
like they always come over our house

3097
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:01,300
my family's house and we all play Mario Party

3098
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:03,300
um a frog was spared

3099
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:05,300
um

3100
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:07,300
nobody got there a snake

3101
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:09,300
no a knife

3102
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:11,300
no um

3103
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,300
I

3104
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:15,300
like Elden Ring

3105
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:17,300
I'm so happy it's my hyper fixation again

3106
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:19,300
cause I need that I need a distraction

3107
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:21,300
and Elden Ring is my distraction

3108
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:23,300
um

3109
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:27,300
cause I also didn't want to hear talk about church

3110
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:29,300
and stuff for my family

3111
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:31,300
um and then

3112
02:27:31,300 --> 02:27:33,300
going back was also a nightmare

3113
02:27:33,300 --> 02:27:35,300
uh go ahead and do an overlay

3114
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:37,300
an overlay

3115
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:39,300
a layover in ATL again

3116
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:41,300
and there's so many people trapped in that airport

3117
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:43,300
um because the flights

3118
02:27:43,300 --> 02:27:45,300
were all messed up

3119
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:47,300
for like a lot of the airlines

3120
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:49,300
and it sucked

3121
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:51,300
I heard so many stories

3122
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:53,300
people in the south

3123
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:55,300
they're just so nice those telling you anything

3124
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:57,300
to a woman she's telling me her whole life story

3125
02:27:57,300 --> 02:27:59,300
and I'm just like

3126
02:27:59,300 --> 02:28:01,300
I'm from the north I'm like who the fuck do you think you talk

3127
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:03,300
don't talk to me then I'm like but then you know

3128
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:05,300
I put on my sweet smile

3129
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:07,300
and I'm like hey okay

3130
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:09,300
um

3131
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:11,300
new theory about

3132
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:13,300
America being a jar person

3133
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:15,300
instead of being a normal being

3134
02:28:15,300 --> 02:28:17,300
nice

3135
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:19,300
amazing theory I think you should

3136
02:28:19,300 --> 02:28:21,300
she definitely do a deep dive

3137
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:23,300
did your family question you about your job they did

3138
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:25,300
it was very awkward

3139
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:27,300
I just kept saying I was under NDA

3140
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:29,300
and then I was just like

3141
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:31,300
I'm just a voice actor

3142
02:28:31,300 --> 02:28:33,300
actress whatever um and I worked for

3143
02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:35,300
a social media startup so I was just like throwing out everything

3144
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:37,300
I should have said I worked for the government

3145
02:28:37,300 --> 02:28:39,300
but I don't think my grandparents would believe me

3146
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:41,300
um yeah we don't do that up there

3147
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:43,300
we don't do that up in the north

3148
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:45,300
mm-mm

3149
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:47,300
we're hard and cold in the north

3150
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:49,300
um

3151
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:51,300
all the ones words literally

3152
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:53,300
and uh

3153
02:28:55,300 --> 02:28:57,300
and then so stuck there

3154
02:28:57,300 --> 02:28:59,300
my I was up till

3155
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:01,300
since 3 a.m. because you guys

3156
02:29:01,300 --> 02:29:03,300
like in my space I was like

3157
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:05,300
I'm doing my makeup now I'm getting ready

3158
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:07,300
now because I'm not going to be able to do this

3159
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,300
when I first wake up I'm happy I did that

3160
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:11,300
um I woke up at 3

3161
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:13,300
I got made sure everything was good

3162
02:29:13,300 --> 02:29:15,300
I called an Uber for about

3163
02:29:15,300 --> 02:29:17,300
because they couldn't drive me

3164
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:19,300
like an hour and a half

3165
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:21,300
and then finally around

3166
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:23,300
like 4.30

3167
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:25,300
I was able to snag one

3168
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:27,300
and this dude

3169
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:29,300
decides to just talk to me the entire time

3170
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:31,300
and I'm like dude it's 4 a.m.

3171
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:33,300
why are you fucking talking to me

3172
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:35,300
just drive me to the damn airport

3173
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:37,300
um

3174
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:39,300
I just got shadow limbs

3175
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:41,300
and the broken bits

3176
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:43,300
shadows like a jar or houses ill

3177
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:47,300
are you being legit with your theory

3178
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:49,300
because I'm going to laugh at you

3179
02:29:49,300 --> 02:29:51,300
anyways

3180
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:53,300
uh but like

3181
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:55,300
I'm like I can be nice so I was like

3182
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:57,300
I'll humor people

3183
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:59,300
um

3184
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:01,300
my first my first Uber driver

3185
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:03,300

3186
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:05,300
was like very south he's like yeah I fought in the war

3187
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:07,300
you know that plane you just came off on

3188
02:30:07,300 --> 02:30:09,300
you know

3189
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:11,300
I've been one of those and I almost fell out

3190
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:13,300
of one of those and my sergeant I was like

3191
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:15,300

3192
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:17,300
died in one of the planes I was in

3193
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:19,300

3194
02:30:19,300 --> 02:30:21,300
like I hate this

3195
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:23,300
um

3196
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:25,300
and so then I get to the airport

3197
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:27,300
I like

3198
02:30:27,300 --> 02:30:29,300
what is it

3199
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:31,300
my flight leaves at

3200
02:30:31,300 --> 02:30:33,300
6.50

3201
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:35,300
should always get to the airport like 2 to 3 hours early

3202
02:30:35,300 --> 02:30:37,300
um

3203
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:39,300
did that

3204
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:41,300
flew

3205
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:43,300
like

3206
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:45,300
an hour late

3207
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:47,300
it was delayed an hour

3208
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:49,300
jealousy stop

3209
02:30:49,300 --> 02:30:51,300
um

3210
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:53,300
why do you spell her name wrong

3211
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:55,300
every time you type it

3212
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:57,300
Merica Merica Merica

3213
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:59,300
Merica

3214
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:01,300
oh my god

3215
02:31:01,300 --> 02:31:03,300
um and then I get

3216
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:05,300
to ATL

3217
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,300
and I think we got delayed like 3 hours

3218
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:09,300
um

3219
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:11,300
and then the flight took to I was so over it

3220
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:13,300
I was so fucking over it

3221
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:15,300
and it's not I'm not done yet

3222
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:17,300
I'm not done yet I finally land

3223
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:19,300
where I'm supposed to be

3224
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:21,300
America

3225
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:23,300
Merica

3226
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:25,300
um

3227
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:27,300
and my mom's unable to pick me up

3228
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:29,300
from the airport so I'm like okay I'll take

3229
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:31,300
public transportation

3230
02:31:31,300 --> 02:31:33,300
and so I'm

3231
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:35,300
going different places

3232
02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:37,300
going to different taking a bus

3233
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:39,300
doing the train doing this bus

3234
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:41,300
doing this taxi and I'm trying to get

3235
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:43,300
closer so my mom can pick me up

3236
02:31:43,300 --> 02:31:45,300
to a closer town

3237
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:47,300
um

3238
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:49,300
and then my dad's like

3239
02:31:49,300 --> 02:31:51,300
oh

3240
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:53,300
you're near me

3241
02:31:53,300 --> 02:31:55,300
why didn't you just say so

3242
02:31:55,300 --> 02:31:57,300
come back this way the place that you finally

3243
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:59,300
oh because I got to the

3244
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:01,300
I got to a train station

3245
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:03,300
and the trains like oh you're you just missed a train

3246
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:05,300
it's about an hour and I'm literally like I'm going

3247
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:07,300
to throw myself in the tracks right now

3248
02:32:07,300 --> 02:32:09,300
it was

3249
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:11,300
I got up at 3am it was

3250
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:13,300
the train won't come till 3.45 I'm like I'm ending

3251
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:15,300
my life in Minecraft

3252
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:17,300
right on these tracks and you can do nothing about it

3253
02:32:17,300 --> 02:32:19,300
conductor

3254
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:21,300
um

3255
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:23,300
and so

3256
02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:25,300
my dad's like oh why didn't you just say

3257
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:27,300
that you were nearby

3258
02:32:27,300 --> 02:32:29,300
because then you can just come over here

3259
02:32:29,300 --> 02:32:31,300
and pretty much retrace

3260
02:32:31,300 --> 02:32:33,300
the last two hours that you took

3261
02:32:33,300 --> 02:32:35,300
and come back to my work

3262
02:32:35,300 --> 02:32:37,300
and I'll drive you home and I'm like

3263
02:32:37,300 --> 02:32:39,300
dad are you

3264
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:41,300
I told you the plan with mom

3265
02:32:41,300 --> 02:32:43,300
I was going to take

3266
02:32:43,300 --> 02:32:45,300
this train

3267
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:47,300
to go to this town

3268
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:49,300
mom would pick me up at this station

3269
02:32:49,300 --> 02:32:51,300
and I told you that like

3270
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:53,300
literally like

3271
02:32:53,300 --> 02:32:55,300
when I got off the plane and you're saying oh wait

3272
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:57,300
that's right

3273
02:32:57,300 --> 02:32:59,300
I forget you're near me

3274
02:32:59,300 --> 02:33:01,300
I'll drive you home and I'm like

3275
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:03,300
dad

3276
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:05,300
dad why

3277
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:07,300
mmm

3278
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:09,300
so I did I went back

3279
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:11,300
I went all the way back took a train

3280
02:33:11,300 --> 02:33:13,300
took a bus took a taxi you went back to

3281
02:33:13,300 --> 02:33:15,300
where I came from

3282
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:17,300
and then

3283
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:19,300
I take a train

3284
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:21,300

3285
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:23,300

3286
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:25,300

3287
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:27,300

3288
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:29,300
with my suitcase and it's like super fucking

3290
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:33,300
to go down this plethora of stairs

3291
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:35,300
and I have to walk

3292
02:33:35,300 --> 02:33:37,300

3293
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:39,300

02:35:51,300 --> 02:35:53,300
off and sometimes every time I usually

3359
02:35:53,300 --> 02:35:55,300
step off an elevator I'll get a little vertigo

3360
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:57,300

always get motion sick on escalators

3378
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:35,300
elevators like moving

3379
02:36:35,300 --> 02:36:37,300

3380
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:39,300

3392
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:05,300
I didn't drink enough water that's a fact

3393
02:37:05,300 --> 02:37:07,300

3394
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:09,300

3395
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:11,300

3396
02:37:11,300 --> 02:37:13,300
worst fucking motion sickness

3397
02:37:13,300 --> 02:37:15,300

3402
02:37:27,300 --> 02:37:29,300
uh yeah the last time I also had vertigo

3403
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:31,300
this bad it was

3404
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:33,300
I had

3405
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:35,300
covid and then literally

3406
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:37,300
the day before I didn't know I had covid I went to an

3407
02:37:37,300 --> 02:37:39,300
amusement park when I had covid whoops

3408
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:43,300
and

3409
02:37:43,300 --> 02:37:45,300
unlike one of those like spinny

3410
02:37:45,300 --> 02:37:47,300
I don't know what the fuck it's called it was six flags

3411
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:49,300
I don't know

3412
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:51,300
which six flags right it was

3413
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:53,300
but it just spun you around a lot

3414
02:37:53,300 --> 02:37:55,300
and I was so

3415
02:37:55,300 --> 02:37:57,300
I should have never done that

3416
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:59,300
it wasn't teacups

3417
02:37:59,300 --> 02:38:01,300
but it was something yeah it was like a world

3418
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:03,300
gig looking thing that's a good way to say it

3419
02:38:03,300 --> 02:38:05,300
um

3420
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:07,300
and

3421
02:38:07,300 --> 02:38:09,300
I hadn't felt like that a while

3422
02:38:09,300 --> 02:38:11,300
and so

3423
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:13,300
I just literally had had all the

3424
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:15,300
I don't have curtains

3425
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:17,300
but I have all the blinds closed

3426
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:19,300
I've had the lights off

3427
02:38:19,300 --> 02:38:21,300
I'm just listening to Elden Ring Lore

3428
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:23,300
I'd sometimes try to read

3429
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:25,300

Boomi snuggled with me for a little bit

3432
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:31,300
which I was surprised because he

3433
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:33,300
he loves attention but he doesn't smuggle with you

3434
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:35,300
um but he the cats were

3435
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:37,300

3466
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:47,300
uh

3467
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:49,300
I'm a very lonely

3468
02:39:49,300 --> 02:39:51,300
sad woman

3469
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:53,300
that's why I'm very parasocial

3470
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:55,300
and um

3471
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:59,300
so I'm motion sick the first

3472
02:39:59,300 --> 02:40:01,300

3473
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:03,300
I try to make myself some food

3474
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:05,300
I try to move I try

3475
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:07,300
it's bad I almost fell over

3476
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:09,300
I did fall at one point but I was already

3477
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:11,300
I just rolled off the couch it wasn't a big deal

3478
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:13,300
and I'm like oh my god

3479
02:40:13,300 --> 02:40:15,300
and so I took like

3480
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:17,300
um some medication for it

3481
02:40:17,300 --> 02:40:19,300
I have like the non drowsy

3482
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:21,300
um Dramamine

3483
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:23,300
or whatever it is it's like male cuisine

3484
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:25,300
took that didn't do shit

3485
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:27,300
took my other meds

3486
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:29,300
I'm like fuck

3487
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:31,300
that didn't really help I don't know why I thought it would

3488
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:33,300
um

3489
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,300
and then

3490
02:40:35,300 --> 02:40:37,300
it's the next day

3491
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:39,300
in the middle of the day

3492
02:40:39,300 --> 02:40:41,300
I get the worst pains

3493
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:43,300
of my life

3494
02:40:43,300 --> 02:40:45,300
uh

3495
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:47,300
and I don't even know what triggered it

3496
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:49,300
I don't know if I got food poisoning

3497
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:51,300
I don't know if I have a had a virus

3498
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:53,300
or have a virus currently that I'm just like

3499
02:40:53,300 --> 02:40:55,300
working out of my system

3500
02:40:55,300 --> 02:40:57,300
I thought fun story time

3501
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:59,300
was enemies were prayer friends

3502
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:01,300
I was one random tough man so it was really

3503
02:41:01,300 --> 02:41:03,300
um

3504
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:05,300
I

3505
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:07,300
felt like I was

3506
02:41:07,300 --> 02:41:09,300
being

3507
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:11,300
stabbed

3508
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:13,300
in the gut

3509
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:15,300
and the pain was so

3510
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:17,300
unbearable I was trying not to

3511
02:41:17,300 --> 02:41:19,300
cry I have a very high pain

3512
02:41:19,300 --> 02:41:21,300
tolerance but it was bad

3513
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:23,300
um

3514
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:25,300
it was probably some of the worst excruciating

3515
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:27,300
pain I've ever felt

3516
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:29,300
and

3517
02:41:29,300 --> 02:41:31,300
it was it was just horrible

3518
02:41:31,300 --> 02:41:33,300
I would never want to go through that again

3519
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:35,300
um it was horrible

3520
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:37,300
because it was affecting because like how

3521
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:39,300
uh

3522
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:41,300
I think it never bothered me the first time like

3523
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:43,300
because I've had pain like that

3524
02:41:43,300 --> 02:41:45,300
but I didn't have fibro when I had pain like that

3525
02:41:45,300 --> 02:41:47,300
so it's different now because it hurts all the

3526
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:49,300
nerves in my body so my like

3527
02:41:49,300 --> 02:41:51,300
that from I started from my stomach

3528
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:53,300
it shot down my legs I don't know if you guys

3529
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:55,300
have ever had sciatica

3530
02:41:55,300 --> 02:41:57,300
or sciatic pain

3531
02:41:57,300 --> 02:41:59,300
I had both my legs uh it also shot

3532
02:41:59,300 --> 02:42:01,300
through my chest and into my shoulder and

3533
02:42:01,300 --> 02:42:03,300
down my right arm

3534
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:05,300
and that's my arm that's bad and my

3535
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:07,300
shoulders messed up um

3536
02:42:07,300 --> 02:42:09,300
I was really just curled up on a ball

3537
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:11,300
I really ripped up all my clothes

3538
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:13,300
I was just naked laying

3539
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:15,300
on the cold floor and just rocking myself

3540
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:17,300
and I thought I was gonna die

3541
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:19,300
and I didn't know what was gonna happen

3542
02:42:19,300 --> 02:42:21,300
and

3543
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:23,300
it sounds like a I thought I

3544
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:25,300
literally thought it was like as I

3545
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:27,300
didn't know if I was having a heart attack I didn't know

3546
02:42:27,300 --> 02:42:29,300
if my I thought my appendix was

3547
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:31,300
exploding

3548
02:42:31,300 --> 02:42:33,300
um I was so scared

3549
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:35,300
because I'm like

3550
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:37,300
family's just gonna come in

3551
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:39,300
because my mom has a key to my place

3552
02:42:39,300 --> 02:42:41,300
and she's just gonna find me dead naked

3553
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:43,300
in my bathroom and just like

3554
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:45,300
not know what the fuck happened to me

3555
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:47,300
and I'm literally sitting there

3556
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:49,300
and I feel my body just

3557
02:42:49,300 --> 02:42:51,300
going cold and I'm like

3558
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:53,300
oh this is it this is how I die

3559
02:42:53,300 --> 02:42:55,300
I wasn't so pain

3560
02:42:55,300 --> 02:42:57,300
and I was just like my phone was across the room

3561
02:42:57,300 --> 02:42:59,300
I couldn't call 911

3562
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:01,300
um I couldn't call my parents

3563
02:43:01,300 --> 02:43:03,300
my watch was far away from me

3564
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:05,300
because I had taken it off to shower

3565
02:43:05,300 --> 02:43:07,300
uh not yeah

3566
02:43:07,300 --> 02:43:09,300
and I just never put it back on the charger

3567
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,300
or pack anywhere and so I was really just like

3568
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:13,300
and then I managed to pull myself onto the toilet

3569
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:15,300
um

3570
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:17,300
and uh

3571
02:43:17,300 --> 02:43:19,300
I have a tummy upset

3572
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:21,300
and then at the same time

3573
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:23,300
from both ends

3574
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:25,300
uh

3575
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:27,300
I started just puking

3576
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:29,300
in my sink just

3577
02:43:29,300 --> 02:43:31,300
fucking projectile vomiting

3578
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:33,300
sweating

3579
02:43:33,300 --> 02:43:35,300
cold thinking I'm dying

3580
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:37,300
I'm like great my body

3581
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:39,300
shutting down I'm expelling all the

3582
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:41,300
waste

3583
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:43,300
um

3584
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:45,300
it was bad

3585
02:43:45,300 --> 02:43:47,300
it was so bad but then I felt

3586
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:49,300
better after I puked and I was just like

3587
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:51,300
fuck do I have food poisoning and I'm like

3588
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:53,300
I didn't even eat anything bad

3589
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:55,300
that's what yeah when you when you guys saw that tweet

3590
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:57,300
saying I threw up

3591
02:43:57,300 --> 02:43:59,300
that was literally what had just happened

3592
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:03,300
uh I did feel better

3593
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:05,300

like it was bad in my sink and so I like

3597
02:44:11,300 --> 02:44:13,300
I had like

3598
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:15,300
almost drunkenly clean up everything

3599
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:17,300
and like

3600
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:19,300
there's some drano down and hope that I caught

3601
02:44:19,300 --> 02:44:21,300
rid of it

3602
02:44:21,300 --> 02:44:23,300
and my cats are all around me

3603
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:25,300
and they know something's wrong

3604
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:27,300
like rena was

3605
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:29,300
uh and boomie were like by my side

3606
02:44:29,300 --> 02:44:31,300
fia was like off

02:44:31,300 --> 02:44:33,300
to the side but like

3608
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:35,300
um rena was always on top of me for that

3609
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:37,300
shit she's like she was up in my face

3610
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:39,300
she was checking she was sniffing me she knew

3611
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:41,300

3613
02:44:45,300 --> 02:44:47,300
uh

3614
02:44:47,300 --> 02:44:49,300
um

3615
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:51,300
and then

3616
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:53,300
I texted my mom right after because I'm like

3617
02:44:53,300 --> 02:44:55,300
mom I don't feel good I don't know what's wrong

3618
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:57,300
with me uh please just check in with me

3619
02:44:57,300 --> 02:44:59,300
every now and then because I don't know what's wrong

3620
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:01,300
with me and she's like do we need to take you to urgent care

3621
02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:03,300
and I'm like wait I don't have insurance

3622
02:45:03,300 --> 02:45:05,300
so don't take me to urgent care

3623
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:07,300
because ambulances are expensive

3624
02:45:07,300 --> 02:45:09,300
y'all

3625
02:45:09,300 --> 02:45:11,300
like 20k in the US

3626
02:45:11,300 --> 02:45:13,300
um

3627
02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:15,300
yeah it's

3628
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:16,300
it's

3629
02:45:16,300 --> 02:45:18,300
that's why like I didn't tweet a lot

3630
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,300
about what I was fucking dealing with

3631
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:22,300
because I didn't want you guys to worry

3632
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:24,300
um

3633
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:26,300
but yeah it was hard it was tough

3634
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:29,300
it was bad

3635
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:31,300
we suffered in America literally

3636
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:33,300
my friend had a baby she still was like

3637
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:35,300
30k

3638
02:45:35,300 --> 02:45:37,300
like damn bitch

3639
02:45:37,300 --> 02:45:39,300
um

3640
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:41,300
but then

3641
02:45:41,300 --> 02:45:43,300
I got up

3642
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:45,300
cleaned up

3643
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:47,300
uh

3644
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:49,300
and just laid on the floor on the cold

3645
02:45:49,300 --> 02:45:51,300
tile

3646
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:53,300
because I was just

3647
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:55,300
like I was cold and then I was hot

3648
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:57,300
so I don't know if I had food poisoning or something

3649
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:59,300
I don't know

3650
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:01,300

3651
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:03,300
I literally had just like

3652
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:05,300
eaten some rice

3653
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:07,300
and then I had like sweet potatoes

3654
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:09,300
I don't

3655
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:11,300
know

3656
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:13,300
it was so weird

3657
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:15,300
uh

3658
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:17,300
and um

3659
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:19,300
and I had some like dressing on it

3660
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:21,300
but the dressing isn't

3661
02:46:21,300 --> 02:46:23,300
wasn't bad I literally like had ordered

3662
02:46:23,300 --> 02:46:25,300
food so I'm like

3663
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:27,300
was the food bad from this place that I ordered from

3664
02:46:27,300 --> 02:46:29,300
again I just

3665
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:31,300
I don't know

3666
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:33,300
some rice left out too long to grow some stuff

3667
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:35,300
yeah that's no

3668
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:37,300
no wherever she goes

3669
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:39,300
she's down with the sickness

3670
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:41,300
oh wow

3671
02:46:41,300 --> 02:46:43,300
but guys

3672
02:46:43,300 --> 02:46:45,300
don't think this doesn't happen on like a daily occurrence

3673
02:46:45,300 --> 02:46:47,300
hello

3674
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:49,300
hello welcome in

3675
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:51,300
I has medical expenses

3676
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:53,300
of thing when someone needs medical attention

3677
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:55,300
I don't fucking know I hate America for that reason

3678
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:57,300
she went to fly to another country to get healthcare

3679
02:46:57,300 --> 02:46:59,300
and fly back literally

3680
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:05,300
is she a doctor?

3681
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:07,300
I don't know

3682
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:09,300
I'm not going to say that

3683
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:11,300
but here's what I'll tell you

3684
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:13,300
because this is exactly what happened last time

3685
02:47:13,300 --> 02:47:15,300
my throat hurts

3686
02:47:15,300 --> 02:47:17,300
last time this happened to me

3687
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:19,300
I went to urgent care

3688
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:21,300
uh

3689
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:23,300
they gave me the same pills that I have

3690
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:25,300
just the milk cuisine or whatever it's called

3691
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:27,300
literally just gave me like over-the-counter

3692
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:29,300
or uh prescription

3693
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:31,300
it didn't do shit

3694
02:47:31,300 --> 02:47:33,300
I literally just had to wait it out

3695
02:47:33,300 --> 02:47:35,300
I don't like 300 bucks

3696
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:37,300
for a waste of my time

3697
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:39,300
and a waste of gas to tell them to tell me

3698
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:41,300
oh here's some drugs

3699
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:43,300
no

3700
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:45,300
I hate that

3701
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:47,300
I hate going to the doctor because they literally don't do shit besides

3702
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:49,300
like you want some drugs and I'm like

3703
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:51,300
I have been on so many medications

3704
02:47:51,300 --> 02:47:53,300
between my like

3705
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:55,300
for my mental health, for my physical health

3706
02:47:55,300 --> 02:47:57,300
for my um

3707
02:47:57,300 --> 02:47:59,300
neuropathy

3708
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:01,300
for like rheumatology issues

3709
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:03,300
I'm like I'm tired of taking fucking

3710
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:05,300
pills bro

3711
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:07,300
I'm trying like

3712
02:48:07,300 --> 02:48:09,300
I would go totally holistic

3713
02:48:09,300 --> 02:48:11,300
if I could because I'm so

3714
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:13,300
fucking tired of taking pills dude

3715
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:15,300
um I literally don't

3716
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:17,300
yeah that's why like that's the only

3717
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:19,300
like what I was like alright

3718
02:48:19,300 --> 02:48:21,300
I think I have a stabbing pain in my gut

3719
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:23,300
I'm puking my guts out

3720
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:25,300
my body's gone cold

3721
02:48:25,300 --> 02:48:27,300
my organs must be shutting down

3722
02:48:27,300 --> 02:48:29,300
I will then

3723
02:48:29,300 --> 02:48:31,300
possibly

3724
02:48:31,300 --> 02:48:33,300
think about getting a

3725
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:35,300
going to the

3726
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:37,300
the doctors

3727
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:41,300
I can see one of those medical recast videos

3728
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:43,300
getting made, VTuber eats moldy rice

3729
02:48:43,300 --> 02:48:45,300
this is what happened to her body

3730
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:47,300
I had like moldy bread on accident the other day and I was fine

3731
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:49,300
I had salmon that was

3732
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:51,300
left out in water

3733
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:53,300
defrosting that I forgot

3734
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:55,300
about I was fine I'm like

3735
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:57,300
what the fuck is going on I think

3736
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:59,300
that's why I'm like my mom just said I think

3737
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:01,300
your body was just so stress

3738
02:49:01,300 --> 02:49:03,300
and you had already had something inside

3739
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:05,300
that you just your when you finally

3740
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:07,300
got to relax your body just like couldn't

3741
02:49:07,300 --> 02:49:09,300
take it

3742
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:11,300
yeah they add up

3743
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:13,300
only bread

3744
02:49:13,300 --> 02:49:15,300
has pedestal that's fine

3745
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:17,300
it's some weird thing when I was a state

3746
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:19,300
very similar to when I've been high for two

3747
02:49:19,300 --> 02:49:21,300
days straight I went to the ER

3748
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:23,300
waited for three hours for them to tell me it's nothing

3749
02:49:23,300 --> 02:49:25,300
that's so crazy yeah it was so I had

3750
02:49:25,300 --> 02:49:27,300
the spins and I'm like

3751
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:29,300
I didn't drink anything I don't drink

3752
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:31,300
because of my medication I only drink for special occasions

3753
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:33,300
so like I might I usually

3754
02:49:33,300 --> 02:49:35,300
won't take my

3755
02:49:35,300 --> 02:49:37,300
prescription for like a day

3756
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:39,300
so I don't think it'll interact with it

3757
02:49:41,300 --> 02:49:43,300
and I literally had the spins

3758
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:45,300
I thought I was on a boat

3759
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:47,300
and I'm like

3760
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:49,300
I feel high

3761
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:51,300
and I'm like if this is what being high is like

3762
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:53,300
I never want to be high bro

3763
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:55,300
this fucking sucks

3764
02:49:55,300 --> 02:49:57,300
um the room is spinning my throat is dry

3765
02:49:57,300 --> 02:49:59,300
right now uh sorry

3766
02:50:01,300 --> 02:50:03,300
I'm not used to talking so much again

3767
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:05,300
I have to get used to yapping

3768
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:07,300
um

3769
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:09,300
yeah so

3770
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:11,300
my body was like not can't do it

3771
02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:13,300

3772
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:17,300

3853
02:53:19,300 --> 02:53:21,300
of myself my mom has told me that before

3854
02:53:21,300 --> 02:53:23,300
um and that's why she was

3855
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:25,300
happy that I left my last job because

3856
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:27,300
I was so busy cleaning up other people's messes

3857
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:29,300
and just like doing stuff for other people

3858
02:53:29,300 --> 02:53:31,300
she's like you need to do something for you

3859
02:53:31,300 --> 02:53:33,300
that gives you energy stop giving

3860
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:35,300
your energy to other people

3861
02:53:35,300 --> 02:53:37,300

02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:39,300
you know stressful things that yeah you guys understand

3863
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:41,300
with my OCD I need to be in control

3864
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:43,300
and nothing's in control right now and it's

3865
02:53:43,300 --> 02:53:45,300
not going my way and it's very stressful

3866
02:53:45,300 --> 02:53:47,300
um

3867
02:53:47,300 --> 02:53:49,300

3868
02:53:49,300 --> 02:53:51,300

that's my word of the year is resilience I

3876
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:09,300
aiming I'm aiming to be resilient

3877
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:11,300
so one of the first things I've noticed about

3878
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:13,300
you plus you know how to don't take anyone's crap

3879
02:54:13,300 --> 02:54:15,300
sometimes I do

3880
02:54:15,300 --> 02:54:17,300
sometimes uh

3881
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:19,300
yeah like I tweeted something stupid the other day

3882
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:21,300
and the day after I tweeted it I'm like why the fuck did I tweet that

3883
02:54:21,300 --> 02:54:23,300
like why am I being a little bitch right now

3884
02:54:23,300 --> 02:54:25,300

3886
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:29,300
but I'm like I just like got distracted

3887
02:54:31,300 --> 02:54:33,300
resilient bouncing no

3888
02:54:33,300 --> 02:54:35,300
I'm still taller than you

3889
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:37,300
you don't have me on my knee

3890
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:39,300
um

3891
02:54:39,300 --> 02:54:41,300
but yeah it's just like

3892
02:54:41,300 --> 02:54:43,300
it's just

3893
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:45,300
I'm still dizzy like I'm

3894
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:47,300
I'm a little nauseous right now

3895
02:54:47,300 --> 02:54:49,300
I'm not nauseous actually I'm just motion sick

3896
02:54:49,300 --> 02:54:51,300
I can't move my head a lot and I'm moving

3897
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:53,300
I'm gesturing so I need to stop

3898
02:54:53,300 --> 02:54:55,300
um

3899
02:54:55,300 --> 02:54:57,300
I hope you guys like the tan toggle

3900
02:54:57,300 --> 02:54:59,300
I might

3901
02:54:59,300 --> 02:55:01,300
I realize I'm darker like

3902
02:55:01,300 --> 02:55:03,300
on

3903
02:55:03,300 --> 02:55:05,300
whoa

3904
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:07,300
yo

3905
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:09,300
I kind of like the upturned hair

3906
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:11,300
hello the physics

3907
02:55:11,300 --> 02:55:13,300
um it's I realize I'm lighter

3908
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:15,300
on one display versus the other

3909
02:55:15,300 --> 02:55:17,300
in my displays they're literally the same freaking

3910
02:55:17,300 --> 02:55:19,300
model but they have differently

3911
02:55:19,300 --> 02:55:21,300
I tried I matched up all like

3912
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:23,300
the gamma saturation all the shit

3913
02:55:23,300 --> 02:55:25,300
but one's darker than the other it makes no fucking

3914
02:55:25,300 --> 02:55:27,300
sense to me

3915
02:55:27,300 --> 02:55:29,300
um

3916
02:55:29,300 --> 02:55:31,300
but I'm happy you guys

3917
02:55:31,300 --> 02:55:33,300
it's on the other but it's because I'm flipped

3918
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:35,300
that's why I flipped myself

3919
02:55:35,300 --> 02:55:37,300
I might flip myself back

3920
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:45,300
tada

3921
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:47,300

leash

4016
02:59:41,300 --> 02:59:43,300
I regret the other one was oh the cat

4017
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:45,300
that was me and those little cat paw tights

4018
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:47,300
a cute little pink dress

4019
02:59:47,300 --> 02:59:49,300
and tail and cat ears

4020
02:59:51,300 --> 02:59:53,300
I don't know I like stepped

4021
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:55,300
in makeup on those tights

4022
02:59:55,300 --> 02:59:57,300
like literally right after I took the photos

4023
02:59:57,300 --> 02:59:59,300
I remember and I had to it toss them

4024
02:59:59,300 --> 03:00:01,300
I want to get some more cat paw tights

4025
03:00:01,300 --> 03:00:03,300
those are cute

4026
03:00:03,300 --> 03:00:05,300
my little paw pads

4027
03:00:09,300 --> 03:00:11,300
can we have like I just thought of like walking on my toes

4028
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:13,300
because like walking in the tights

4029
03:00:13,300 --> 03:00:15,300
and like walking the cats walk on their toes

4030
03:00:15,300 --> 03:00:17,300
is it an

4031
03:00:17,300 --> 03:00:19,300
is it an autistic thing

4032
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:21,300
to walk on your toes so you don't

4033
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:23,300
make noise

4034
03:00:23,300 --> 03:00:25,300
because I didn't know that

4035
03:00:25,300 --> 03:00:27,300
I don't understand how that's a thing

4036
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:29,300
Reina what are you doing you got something in your ear

4037
03:00:29,300 --> 03:00:31,300
or so

4038
03:00:31,300 --> 03:00:33,300
because like why is that a thing

4039
03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:39,300
I don't think so yes I think so

4040
03:00:39,300 --> 03:00:41,300
is it I do that

4041
03:00:41,300 --> 03:00:43,300
but I'm not autistic I think

4042
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:45,300
I think it's somewhat common yeah

4043
03:00:47,300 --> 03:00:49,300
because I don't like making noise when I walk

4044
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:51,300
okay

4045
03:00:53,300 --> 03:00:55,300
at least I'm not the only person

4046
03:00:55,300 --> 03:00:57,300
that doesn't that does that

4047
03:00:57,300 --> 03:00:59,300
the walks on our toes sometimes

4048
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:05,300
like I'll just do it in general

4049
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:07,300
I just don't like making noise when I walk at all

4050
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:11,300
so I'll walk weird

4051
03:01:11,300 --> 03:01:13,300
my mom says I bounce when I walk

4052
03:01:13,300 --> 03:01:15,300
she's like why are you so bouncy

4053
03:01:15,300 --> 03:01:17,300
just walk normal and I'm like I don't know

4054
03:01:19,300 --> 03:01:21,300
Reina just had to put the mic

4055
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:25,300
I need to get a little

4056
03:01:25,300 --> 03:01:27,300
cat

4057
03:01:27,300 --> 03:01:29,300
mascot

4058
03:01:29,300 --> 03:01:31,300
in the form of Reina

4059
03:01:33,300 --> 03:01:35,300
because I don't know if I get all three cats

4060
03:01:35,300 --> 03:01:37,300
and just like have them surround me

4061
03:01:39,300 --> 03:01:41,300
she tip toes like a cartoon

4062
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:43,300
villain yeah exactly

4063
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:47,300
but yeah I'm very glad

4064
03:01:47,300 --> 03:01:49,300
to

4065
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:51,300
Reina on your head

4066
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:53,300
yeah I have one cat under each arm

4067
03:01:53,300 --> 03:01:55,300
and then Reina is just on my head

4068
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:57,300
I don't know if I can make this model

4069
03:01:57,300 --> 03:01:59,300
and go bald I'll be honest with you

4070
03:01:59,300 --> 03:02:01,300
I'll have to do try to figure out a bald toggle

4071
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:09,300
they add the cats

4072
03:02:09,300 --> 03:02:11,300
to the family treat no they're not

4073
03:02:11,300 --> 03:02:13,300
they're just my babies they're separate

4074
03:02:13,300 --> 03:02:15,300
they're not part of that mess

4075
03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:19,300
I know people who did that a lot

4076
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:21,300
don't get surgery later in life

4077
03:02:21,300 --> 03:02:23,300
because doing that messed up their legs

4078
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:25,300
oh walking in your toes

4079
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:29,300
oh maybe

4080
03:02:35,300 --> 03:02:37,300
it's called it it's on a family treat

4081
03:02:37,300 --> 03:02:39,300
it's a wreath alright so I'm gonna say

4082
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:41,300
um

4083
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:45,300
I don't know what I'm gonna say

4084
03:02:45,300 --> 03:02:47,300
I'm just like

4085
03:02:47,300 --> 03:02:49,300
losing my train of thought

4086
03:02:51,300 --> 03:02:53,300
no wreath

4087
03:02:53,300 --> 03:02:55,300
w-r-e-a-t-h

4088
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:57,300
wreath

4089
03:02:57,300 --> 03:02:59,300
using a sentence

4090
03:02:59,300 --> 03:03:01,300
my mom made a beautiful Christmas wreath this year

4091
03:03:01,300 --> 03:03:03,300
wreath

4092
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:05,300
I was good in spelling bees

4093
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:07,300
so I'm gonna say

4094
03:03:09,300 --> 03:03:11,300
wreath

4095
03:03:11,300 --> 03:03:13,300
they also uh

4096
03:03:13,300 --> 03:03:15,300
when they updated my model for the toggle

4097
03:03:15,300 --> 03:03:17,300
they also changed my mouth tracking

4098
03:03:17,300 --> 03:03:19,300
so it's a little bit weirder and I have to fix it again

4099
03:03:19,300 --> 03:03:21,300
my mouth doesn't open all the way

4100
03:03:21,300 --> 03:03:23,300
it's very odd

4101
03:03:25,300 --> 03:03:27,300
can I get a location of origin

4102
03:03:29,300 --> 03:03:31,300
I don't fucking know well no

4103
03:03:31,300 --> 03:03:33,300
I can't give you an a- they need

4104
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:35,300
the person who's

4105
03:03:35,300 --> 03:03:37,300
testing you gives a location

4106
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:39,300
of origin

4107
03:03:39,300 --> 03:03:41,300
velar spelling bee

4108
03:03:41,300 --> 03:03:43,300
strani can't spell

4109
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:45,300
because she's Scottish

4110
03:03:45,300 --> 03:03:47,300
Azura

4111
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:49,300
I think would just fall asleep

4112
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:51,300
and they would go to her turn

4113
03:03:51,300 --> 03:03:53,300
and she'd just be asleep

4114
03:03:53,300 --> 03:03:55,300
uh mercy

4115
03:03:55,300 --> 03:03:57,300
would do well

4116
03:03:59,300 --> 03:04:01,300
emmy

4117
03:04:01,300 --> 03:04:03,300
would only ask for

4118
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:05,300
words that were inappropriate

4119
03:04:05,300 --> 03:04:07,300
I see would just

4120
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:09,300
be like

4121
03:04:09,300 --> 03:04:11,300
this is not fair

4122
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:13,300
English isn't my first language

4123
03:04:13,300 --> 03:04:15,300
after she gets like one word wrong

4124
03:04:15,300 --> 03:04:17,300
and we give her a second

4125
03:04:17,300 --> 03:04:19,300
and she would just be like

4126
03:04:19,300 --> 03:04:21,300
no

4127
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:23,300
let me so we'd have to like give her like

4128
03:04:25,300 --> 03:04:27,300
Russian words

4129
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:29,300
haha

4130
03:04:33,300 --> 03:04:35,300
yeah because

4131
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:37,300
Scottish spelling is very phonetic

4132
03:04:37,300 --> 03:04:39,300
very much like krill

4133
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:43,300
yeah all my fucking god

4134
03:04:43,300 --> 03:04:45,300
you expect me to spell this shit

4135
03:04:45,300 --> 03:04:47,300
and she just fucking like

4136
03:04:47,300 --> 03:04:49,300
eat something across the room right now

4137
03:04:49,300 --> 03:04:51,300
I just was gonna go put right on the ground

4138
03:04:51,300 --> 03:04:53,300
and she just immediately just

4139
03:04:53,300 --> 03:04:55,300
gripped my shoulder

4140
03:04:55,300 --> 03:04:57,300
um

4141
03:04:57,300 --> 03:04:59,300
but yeah

4142
03:05:03,300 --> 03:05:05,300
it's like a club

4143
03:05:05,300 --> 03:05:07,300
it's funny so

4144
03:05:07,300 --> 03:05:09,300
strani really shouldn't have

4145
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:11,300
set this up like this

4146
03:05:11,300 --> 03:05:13,300
but she puts all of our models in a drive

4147
03:05:13,300 --> 03:05:15,300
folder

4148
03:05:15,300 --> 03:05:17,300
but

4149
03:05:17,300 --> 03:05:19,300
but I see and Emmys are separate

4150
03:05:19,300 --> 03:05:21,300
so I can't get to their models

4151
03:05:21,300 --> 03:05:23,300
I was like really debating whether or not

4152
03:05:23,300 --> 03:05:25,300
I'm gonna come back and I'm just like

4153
03:05:25,300 --> 03:05:27,300
mercy on the screen

4154
03:05:29,300 --> 03:05:31,300
because if I were I would totally

4155
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:33,300
yank I see his model and be like

4156
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:35,300
hello everybody

4157
03:05:37,300 --> 03:05:39,300
oh yeah

4158
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:41,300
I'm hoping she's getting a well deserved break

4159
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:43,300
she's been very stressed

4160
03:05:43,300 --> 03:05:45,300
make sure you guys if you're a snowberry

4161
03:05:45,300 --> 03:05:47,300
your dada give her lots of love

4162
03:05:49,300 --> 03:05:51,300
um

4163
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:53,300
impressions yeah I can I can literally

4164
03:05:53,300 --> 03:05:55,300
only do icy though out of my gen mates

4165
03:05:55,300 --> 03:05:57,300
and then I can kind of do a zero

4166
03:05:57,300 --> 03:05:59,300
everyone swaps models

4167
03:06:01,300 --> 03:06:03,300
um

4168
03:06:05,300 --> 03:06:07,300
I would like show up

4169
03:06:07,300 --> 03:06:09,300
and like

4170
03:06:09,300 --> 03:06:11,300
because I like I could definitely grab like

4171
03:06:11,300 --> 03:06:13,300
mercy's or is there a model or strani's

4172
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:15,300
I'm very tempted to yank

4173
03:06:15,300 --> 03:06:17,300
because strani has all our models too

4174
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:19,300
I'm tempted to yank

4175
03:06:19,300 --> 03:06:21,300
because she backs them up for us

4176
03:06:21,300 --> 03:06:23,300
uh strani's model

4177
03:06:23,300 --> 03:06:25,300
when I collab with her

4178
03:06:25,300 --> 03:06:27,300
and just like show up as her and she'll be like

4179
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:29,300
what the a**

4180
03:06:29,300 --> 03:06:31,300
what the f**k

4181
03:06:31,300 --> 03:06:33,300
I can't even do her voice right now

4182
03:06:33,300 --> 03:06:35,300
like

4183
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:37,300
what the f**k in hell

4184
03:06:37,300 --> 03:06:39,300
yeah I just I'm sounding British

4185
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:41,300
and then I'll just be like

4186
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:43,300
eww reeflings look into my eyes

4187
03:06:43,300 --> 03:06:45,300
you're falling in love with me now instead

4188
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:47,300
I'm the real

4189
03:06:47,300 --> 03:06:49,300
strani consoles

4190
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:53,300
which girl would you want to do

4191
03:06:53,300 --> 03:06:55,300
a she be impression with your model

4192
03:06:55,300 --> 03:06:57,300
uh emmy or mercy

4193
03:06:57,300 --> 03:06:59,300
emmy is a good dom and mercy is a good

4194
03:06:59,300 --> 03:07:01,300
dom so I think

4195
03:07:01,300 --> 03:07:03,300
I think that would be really funny

4196
03:07:03,300 --> 03:07:05,300
uh

4197
03:07:05,300 --> 03:07:07,300
I would like to as you guys know

4198
03:07:07,300 --> 03:07:09,300
I love cute and funny stuff so I would

4199
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:11,300
like to yank emmy's

4200
03:07:11,300 --> 03:07:13,300
or icy's model as a meme

4201
03:07:13,300 --> 03:07:15,300
although it'd be very funny

4202
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:17,300
if me and zura were both like cute

4203
03:07:17,300 --> 03:07:19,300
and funny

4204
03:07:19,300 --> 03:07:21,300

4205
03:07:21,300 --> 03:07:23,300

4206
03:07:23,300 --> 03:07:25,300
having strani's model

4207
03:07:27,300 --> 03:07:29,300

03:07:29,300 --> 03:07:31,300
strani's model

4209
03:07:31,300 --> 03:07:33,300
I see with the zura's model I'm just thinking of

4210
03:07:33,300 --> 03:07:35,300
all the combinations it's funny

4211
03:07:35,300 --> 03:07:37,300

03:07:37,300 --> 03:07:39,300
as she would she would just jiggle my boobs

4213
03:07:41,300 --> 03:07:43,300

anymore yet no I just got back

4224
03:08:15,300 --> 03:08:17,300
I just got here

4225
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:19,300
I don't even know where it went oh yeah I shoved

4226
03:08:19,300 --> 03:08:21,300
it in my closet so my mom couldn't find it

4227
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:23,300
but then I ended up kinda showing her

4228
03:08:23,300 --> 03:08:25,300
where it was because I put the cat

4229
03:08:25,300 --> 03:08:27,300
carrier in the same spot she's like

4230
03:08:27,300 --> 03:08:29,300
what if I need to get the cats out if there's

4231
03:08:29,300 --> 03:08:31,300
emergency and I'm like fuck

4232
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:33,300
it's in the same spot as I put the whip

4233
03:08:33,300 --> 03:08:35,300
so I had to take out the whip

4234
03:08:35,300 --> 03:08:37,300
and then take out the cat carrier

4235
03:08:37,300 --> 03:08:39,300
and be like it's right here and then put it back

4236
03:08:39,300 --> 03:08:41,300
pretend that everything

4237
03:08:41,300 --> 03:08:43,300
was normal

4238
03:08:43,300 --> 03:08:45,300
how would you power

4239
03:08:45,300 --> 03:08:47,300
scale you and the girls

4240
03:08:47,300 --> 03:08:49,300
based off of what

4241
03:08:49,300 --> 03:08:51,300
Azura

4242
03:08:51,300 --> 03:08:53,300
is gonna be the most powerful she's literally

4243
03:08:53,300 --> 03:08:55,300
god

4244
03:08:55,300 --> 03:08:57,300
so

4245
03:08:57,300 --> 03:08:59,300
um and then

4246
03:08:59,300 --> 03:09:01,300
strongy

4247
03:09:01,300 --> 03:09:03,300
no no and then emmy because of her

4248
03:09:03,300 --> 03:09:05,300
book and then strongy because her hypnotism

4249
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:07,300
I

4250
03:09:07,300 --> 03:09:09,300
I'm

4251
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:11,300
literally probably the weakest now

4252
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:13,300
they think of it I see because

4253
03:09:13,300 --> 03:09:15,300
of her polar bear upbringing

4254
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:17,300
mercy because she just knows how to kill

4255
03:09:17,300 --> 03:09:19,300
people and torture them

4256
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:21,300
and me I'm just

4257
03:09:21,300 --> 03:09:23,300
I just do that sexually so I'm like I'm

4258
03:09:23,300 --> 03:09:25,300
I yeah

4259
03:09:25,300 --> 03:09:27,300
I guess I'm the weakest

4260
03:09:27,300 --> 03:09:29,300
affection meter

4261
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:31,300
um

4262
03:09:31,300 --> 03:09:33,300
she was just

4263
03:09:33,300 --> 03:09:35,300
I'm just some girl I'm just some bunny girl

4264
03:09:35,300 --> 03:09:37,300
that runs a hotel

4265
03:09:37,300 --> 03:09:39,300
bro

4266
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:41,300
I'm just freaky canonical

4267
03:09:41,300 --> 03:09:43,300
I'm literally the only freaky one canonically

4268
03:09:43,300 --> 03:09:45,300
everybody else is normal

4269
03:09:45,300 --> 03:09:47,300
like if you really think about it I'm the actual

4270
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:49,300
one that's like on the nose for my

4271
03:09:49,300 --> 03:09:51,300
my my uh my niche

4272
03:09:51,300 --> 03:09:53,300
um for affection

4273
03:09:57,300 --> 03:09:59,300
hmm that's a tough one

4274
03:09:59,300 --> 03:10:01,300
I would say

4275
03:10:03,300 --> 03:10:05,300
who's the most affectionate

4276
03:10:05,300 --> 03:10:07,300
for their fans

4277
03:10:07,300 --> 03:10:09,300
I would honestly say that

4278
03:10:09,300 --> 03:10:11,300
me and strongy are tied

4279
03:10:11,300 --> 03:10:13,300
at the top

4280
03:10:13,300 --> 03:10:15,300
then emmy

4281
03:10:15,300 --> 03:10:17,300
then I see

4282
03:10:19,300 --> 03:10:21,300
the mercy and azura

4283
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:23,300
I think that's how I do it

4284
03:10:25,300 --> 03:10:27,300
I think

4285
03:10:27,300 --> 03:10:29,300
me and

4286
03:10:29,300 --> 03:10:31,300
strongy are very similar in our

4287
03:10:31,300 --> 03:10:33,300
affection

4288
03:10:37,300 --> 03:10:39,300
yeah it's hard to rank that because

4289
03:10:39,300 --> 03:10:41,300
we all like show our affection in different

4290
03:10:41,300 --> 03:10:43,300
ways

4291
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:47,300
mercy was an ex student yeah but she

4292
03:10:47,300 --> 03:10:49,300
fucking kills people

4293
03:10:49,300 --> 03:10:51,300
um

4294
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:53,300
because me and strongy

4295
03:10:53,300 --> 03:10:55,300
I think

4296
03:10:55,300 --> 03:10:57,300
are very

4297
03:10:57,300 --> 03:10:59,300
and yes I'll use this term

4298
03:10:59,300 --> 03:11:01,300
just because of how we are like we just

4299
03:11:01,300 --> 03:11:03,300
like spending time with you

4300
03:11:03,300 --> 03:11:05,300
um and we just talk a lot and we just want to

4301
03:11:05,300 --> 03:11:07,300
hang out and play games with you

4302
03:11:07,300 --> 03:11:09,300
um

4303
03:11:09,300 --> 03:11:11,300
emmy is as different because

4304
03:11:11,300 --> 03:11:13,300
again it's familial

4305
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:15,300
and a little like

4306
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:17,300
it's yeah it's

4307
03:11:17,300 --> 03:11:19,300
really hard

4308
03:11:19,300 --> 03:11:21,300
to

4309
03:11:21,300 --> 03:11:23,300
kind of because everybody kind of expresses

4310
03:11:23,300 --> 03:11:25,300
themselves in different ways

4311
03:11:29,300 --> 03:11:31,300
I don't know if she be you can just pull off

4312
03:11:31,300 --> 03:11:33,300
your own voice and make someone do whatever you want

4313
03:11:33,300 --> 03:11:35,300
that's true I liked so like in my

4314
03:11:35,300 --> 03:11:37,300
PL I love switching my voice up because

4315
03:11:37,300 --> 03:11:39,300
people would come in and I'd be like hi everybody

4316
03:11:39,300 --> 03:11:41,300
my name is uh Rana Noi

4317
03:11:41,300 --> 03:11:43,300
and today we're just playing

4318
03:11:43,300 --> 03:11:45,300
whatever the fuck I was playing at the time

4319
03:11:45,300 --> 03:11:47,300
and um

4320
03:11:47,300 --> 03:11:49,300
then

4321
03:11:49,300 --> 03:11:51,300
they'd be like oh how's it going I'd be like it's

4322
03:11:51,300 --> 03:11:53,300
going fine thank you

4323
03:11:53,300 --> 03:11:55,300
and they're just like

4324
03:11:55,300 --> 03:11:57,300
was that somebody else

4325
03:11:57,300 --> 03:11:59,300

Laurie

4329
03:12:05,300 --> 03:12:07,300
I can't even do my higher pitch voice right now because

4330
03:12:07,300 --> 03:12:09,300
it's already my throat is dry

4331
03:12:09,300 --> 03:12:11,300
I don't know if my air is dry in my house

4332
03:12:11,300 --> 03:12:13,300
Rana why are you just staring at my go XLR

4333
03:12:13,300 --> 03:12:15,300
like you're gonna do something

4334
03:12:15,300 --> 03:12:17,300
she's

4335
03:12:17,300 --> 03:12:19,300
squeaked because I poked her but

4336
03:12:19,300 --> 03:12:21,300

03:12:25,300 --> 03:12:27,300
sometimes just like silent meow she's like

4340
03:12:27,300 --> 03:12:29,300
like you can't hear it

4341
03:12:29,300 --> 03:12:31,300
she'll just open her mouth and like let out a

4342
03:12:31,300 --> 03:12:33,300
squeak like the light side a silence

4343
03:12:33,300 --> 03:12:35,300
squeak Rana speak to the people

4344
03:12:39,300 --> 03:12:41,300
that's not speaking to the people

4345
03:12:41,300 --> 03:12:43,300
you're just rubbing against the mic she went

4346
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:47,300
Rana

4347
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:49,300
no yes actually meow and stop

4348
03:12:49,300 --> 03:12:51,300
whisper meowing

4349
03:12:51,300 --> 03:12:53,300
Rana say hi

4350
03:12:53,300 --> 03:12:55,300

4351
03:12:55,300 --> 03:12:57,300
whisper meowing

4352
03:12:57,300 --> 03:12:59,300
Rana

4353
03:13:03,300 --> 03:13:05,300
Rana

4354
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:07,300
she just did it again she just whisper

4355
03:13:07,300 --> 03:13:09,300
meowing and whisper purring

4356
03:13:09,300 --> 03:13:11,300
that's what she does

4357
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:13,300
she just opens her mouth and goes

4358
03:13:17,300 --> 03:13:19,300
if I put her in the ground maybe she'll meow

4359
03:13:23,300 --> 03:13:25,300
Rana

4360
03:13:25,300 --> 03:13:27,300
raise your voice

4361
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:29,300
say hi

4362
03:13:31,300 --> 03:13:33,300
she just squeaked again

4363
03:13:37,300 --> 03:13:39,300
he heard that oh hello again

4364
03:13:39,300 --> 03:13:41,300
Rana just hopped on my desk and back on my lap

4365
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:43,300

03:13:43,300 --> 03:13:45,300

03:13:45,300 --> 03:13:47,300
doesn't Rana mean queen in Spanish

4368
03:13:47,300 --> 03:13:49,300
or is that a coincidence

4369
03:13:49,300 --> 03:13:51,300
it is it's spelled R E

4370
03:13:51,300 --> 03:13:53,300
Rana

4371
03:13:53,300 --> 03:13:55,300
queen in Spanish

4372
03:13:55,300 --> 03:13:57,300
but that's not how I spell her name

4373
03:13:57,300 --> 03:13:59,300
excuse me I'm so sorry

4374
03:13:59,300 --> 03:14:01,300
it's the lean game

4375
03:14:01,300 --> 03:14:03,300
I'm drinking the lean game ourselves

4376
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:05,300
and I'm not even joking this shit is delicious

4377
03:14:05,300 --> 03:14:07,300
like

4378
03:14:07,300 --> 03:14:09,300
I usually don't like mix drinks

4379
03:14:09,300 --> 03:14:11,300
like shake your drinks but I'm like

4380
03:14:11,300 --> 03:14:13,300

4381
03:14:15,300 --> 03:14:17,300

4383
03:14:19,300 --> 03:14:21,300

4384
03:14:21,300 --> 03:14:23,300
no I'm not drinking lean like I'm not drinking

4385
03:14:23,300 --> 03:14:25,300
actual lean

4386
03:14:25,300 --> 03:14:27,300
bro

4387
03:14:27,300 --> 03:14:29,300
yeah I got a little robot susan

4388
03:14:29,300 --> 03:14:31,300
um no I'm drinking

4389
03:14:31,300 --> 03:14:33,300
the gamer subs flavor lean

4390
03:14:33,300 --> 03:14:35,300
it's peach lemonade flavor it's very good

4391
03:14:35,300 --> 03:14:37,300
it's caffeine free

4392
03:14:37,300 --> 03:14:39,300
I'm so happy I took the caffeine free one

4393
03:14:39,300 --> 03:14:41,300
because I probably wouldn't sleep

4394
03:14:43,300 --> 03:14:45,300
yeah I'm leaning to the side

4395
03:14:45,300 --> 03:14:47,300
because I have motion sickness

4396
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:49,300
um

4397
03:14:49,300 --> 03:14:51,300
it's really tasty

4398
03:14:51,300 --> 03:14:53,300
um and then

4399
03:14:53,300 --> 03:14:55,300
I usually don't like tropical

4400
03:14:55,300 --> 03:14:57,300
flavors but I tasted

4401
03:14:57,300 --> 03:14:59,300
the

4402
03:14:59,300 --> 03:15:01,300
the shyly

4403
03:15:01,300 --> 03:15:03,300
flavor and it's so good

4404
03:15:03,300 --> 03:15:05,300
and then the other one I think it's like

4405
03:15:05,300 --> 03:15:07,300
strawberry lime or like sour

4406
03:15:07,300 --> 03:15:09,300
strawberry um

4407
03:15:09,300 --> 03:15:11,300

4408
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:13,300
the gorilla one I don't know what it's called

4409
03:15:13,300 --> 03:15:15,300
um it's like gorilla fart

4410
03:15:15,300 --> 03:15:17,300
6000 or something silly

4411
03:15:17,300 --> 03:15:19,300
I was like I don't know if I'm gonna light

4412
03:15:19,300 --> 03:15:21,300

4413
03:15:21,300 --> 03:15:23,300

4414
03:15:23,300 --> 03:15:25,300

4424
03:15:45,300 --> 03:15:47,300

and vtubers named them what did you

4431
03:15:59,300 --> 03:16:01,300
expect

4432
03:16:01,300 --> 03:16:03,300
what is it

4433
03:16:03,300 --> 03:16:05,300

03:16:13,300 --> 03:16:15,300
just in my chat screaming

4438
03:16:15,300 --> 03:16:17,300
my code every time he has the chance to

4439
03:16:17,300 --> 03:16:19,300
um yeah

4440
03:16:19,300 --> 03:16:21,300
I definitely need to fix the rigging around my mouth

4441
03:16:21,300 --> 03:16:23,300
because I'm not as

4442
03:16:23,300 --> 03:16:25,300
and I'm I'm I'm emoting

4443
03:16:25,300 --> 03:16:27,300
as much as I normally do

4444
03:16:27,300 --> 03:16:29,300
so I don't know why

4445
03:16:29,300 --> 03:16:31,300
unless I over exaggerate

4446
03:16:33,300 --> 03:16:35,300
so I definitely need to fix my physics

4447
03:16:35,300 --> 03:16:37,300
I have my uh cover up

4448
03:16:37,300 --> 03:16:39,300
for my boobies coming soon

4449
03:16:39,300 --> 03:16:41,300
I'm going to be

4450
03:16:41,300 --> 03:16:43,300
um

4451
03:16:43,300 --> 03:16:45,300
what's it called

4452
03:16:47,300 --> 03:16:49,300
my chest will be covered

4453
03:16:49,300 --> 03:16:51,300
and I'll look like a normal businesswoman

4454
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:53,300
hahaha

4455
03:16:53,300 --> 03:16:55,300
they're not going away

4456
03:16:55,300 --> 03:16:57,300
it's just a toggle

4457
03:16:57,300 --> 03:16:59,300
my

4458
03:16:59,300 --> 03:17:01,300
my chocolatey boobs

4459
03:17:01,300 --> 03:17:03,300
oh I'm like

4460
03:17:03,300 --> 03:17:05,300
I'm shaking and I'm shaking

4461
03:17:05,300 --> 03:17:07,300
Reyna and Reyna just going

4462
03:17:07,300 --> 03:17:09,300
hahaha

4463
03:17:09,300 --> 03:17:11,300
Reyna I'm sorry

4464
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:13,300
damn girl

4465
03:17:13,300 --> 03:17:15,300
you got stimkey breath

4466
03:17:15,300 --> 03:17:17,300
I need to brush your teeth again

4467
03:17:17,300 --> 03:17:19,300
she just looked at me like I offended her

4468
03:17:23,300 --> 03:17:25,300
um yeah

4469
03:17:25,300 --> 03:17:27,300
I definitely need to change the coloring

4470
03:17:27,300 --> 03:17:29,300
on the model

4471
03:17:29,300 --> 03:17:31,300
because I like it looks lighter on one screen

4472
03:17:31,300 --> 03:17:33,300
but it's darker on the other so I might lighten myself up a little bit

4473
03:17:33,300 --> 03:17:35,300
for a little bit

4474
03:17:35,300 --> 03:17:37,300
for a little bit

4475
03:17:37,300 --> 03:17:39,300
copy um yeah as a game or something

4476
03:17:39,300 --> 03:17:41,300
Reyna's stinky

4477
03:17:41,300 --> 03:17:43,300
Reyna got a stinky breath

4478
03:17:45,300 --> 03:17:47,300
she just looked up back at me like

4479
03:17:47,300 --> 03:17:49,300
what the fuck bitch why are you exposing me

4480
03:17:51,300 --> 03:17:53,300

4481
03:17:53,300 --> 03:17:55,300

4482
03:17:55,300 --> 03:17:57,300

4483
03:18:01,300 --> 03:18:03,300
ugh no more chocolate milk

4484
03:18:03,300 --> 03:18:05,300
I don't want her going on the milkers

4485
03:18:05,300 --> 03:18:07,300
guys I can toggle it

4486
03:18:07,300 --> 03:18:09,300
on and off

4487
03:18:09,300 --> 03:18:11,300
I'll probably just use it for thumbnails

4488
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:13,300
hahaha

4489
03:18:13,300 --> 03:18:15,300

4490
03:18:15,300 --> 03:18:17,300
Azur although Azur is giving

4491
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:19,300
a cover up too hers looks fucking sexy though

4492
03:18:19,300 --> 03:18:21,300
I was like I think this

4493
03:18:21,300 --> 03:18:23,300
is just making her look more hot

4494
03:18:23,300 --> 03:18:25,300
to be honest with you

4495
03:18:25,300 --> 03:18:27,300

4496
03:18:27,300 --> 03:18:29,300

it's nice that I'll be able to go between

4505
03:18:51,300 --> 03:18:53,300
I didn't realize how pale I was

4506
03:18:53,300 --> 03:18:55,300
cause I'm like if I turn

4507
03:18:55,300 --> 03:18:57,300
this is my ear color normally

4508
03:18:57,300 --> 03:18:59,300
and if I turn off that

4509
03:18:59,300 --> 03:19:01,300
I'm like

4510
03:19:01,300 --> 03:19:03,300
I don't remember being this pale

4511
03:19:03,300 --> 03:19:05,300

4513
03:19:09,300 --> 03:19:11,300
I don't remember being this white

4514
03:19:11,300 --> 03:19:13,300

4515
03:19:15,300 --> 03:19:17,300

4516
03:19:17,300 --> 03:19:19,300

but like I swear

4521
03:19:37,300 --> 03:19:39,300
cause like

4522
03:19:39,300 --> 03:19:41,300
it's so weird I bet if I loaded

4523
03:19:41,300 --> 03:19:43,300
it in my old model it would look hold on

4524
03:19:43,300 --> 03:19:45,300
I'm testing this Reina I need to put you on the floor

4525
03:19:45,300 --> 03:19:47,300

4526
03:19:47,300 --> 03:19:49,300
trying to turn around to get back on my shoulder

4527
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:53,300
I'm testing it

4528
03:20:01,300 --> 03:20:03,300
ignore what my model looks like

4529
03:20:05,300 --> 03:20:07,300

4530
03:20:09,300 --> 03:20:11,300
see I swear

4531
03:20:13,300 --> 03:20:15,300

4532
03:20:15,300 --> 03:20:17,300
you being like that

4533
03:20:17,300 --> 03:20:19,300
I swear I'm like a little bit

4534
03:20:19,300 --> 03:20:21,300
like I'm not as bright

4535
03:20:23,300 --> 03:20:25,300
I swear I'm not as bright

4536
03:20:27,300 --> 03:20:29,300
and now my model is more

4537
03:20:29,300 --> 03:20:31,300
like you could tell by the

4538
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:33,300
the mouth tracking is a little bit better

4539
03:20:33,300 --> 03:20:35,300
and more responsive

4540
03:20:35,300 --> 03:20:37,300
actually let me look at the settings for that right now

4541
03:20:37,300 --> 03:20:39,300
while I'm here

4542
03:20:41,300 --> 03:20:43,300

my mouth form

4544
03:20:47,300 --> 03:20:49,300
