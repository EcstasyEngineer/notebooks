1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,420
Hi, hi.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,140
Hello.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,540
I am Striggler diabo.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,840
He was quite dangerous.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,760
Were you nervous?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Oh, not the ad.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Oh, not the super loud game.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Oh, what the hell?

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,760
I think, did Alderman update or something?

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:56,760
Because everything's, like, really weird.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Ooh, what's happening?

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm gonna put you in the litter box.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Let me turn down the sound volume a little bit more.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,760
I don't know why the game is suddenly full-screen and not borderless windowed.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I think the game might have updated.

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Alderman Jump Scare.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Ooh, Shrieken Witch.

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
I'm still a cat.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
I forgot about that.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
I still haven't eaten my Taco Bell yet.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Can I please?

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Why is OBS doing this to me?

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Please let me...

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
It's just not letting...

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,760
I can't make the window any smaller on OBS.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Usually I can make it smaller.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
It's just, like, nope.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Hi.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
It's a good look.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
You guys, like...

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,760
You guys, like, kitty-kitty-sheebie?

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Kibbie?

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
You can call me Kibbie.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Hi, Mari.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Kibbie.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,760
I'm Kibbie.

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Very distant cousin.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
It's a very cute outfit, though.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Like, hold on.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
I'll show you guys.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
It's a very...

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Like, look how cute it is.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
It's a very cute outfit.

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
And I can beat you up.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,760
I love booth outfits.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,760
They're so fun.

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Keep jiggling.

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
But...

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
And...

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
I don't know if there's any other toggles for this.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
There's...

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Can I take off the bat?

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
What do you mean?

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
There's a little bunny on my hip, too.

56
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Which is funny, because it says milk.

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,760
So you think I'd be, like, a cat on the hip?

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
I like the palette.

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Go back the handout.

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Oops, sorry.

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Give me your money.

62
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
What?

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I'm not even gonna read that out loud.

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
The...how are the toggles?

65
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
I haven't eaten them yet.

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
I haven't even opened the bag.

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
You're drawing a what in my...

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,760
No, put it away.

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Put it away.

70
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
I have some potatoes.

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
What is this?

72
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
I've never had the potatoes.

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh, boomies got the zoomies.

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Oh.

75
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
He just slammed into the window.

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Kibby.

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
He also gave me nachos for free.

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,760
I didn't...oh wait, no, that was part of the thing.

79
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Can I dip the nachos in the potatoes?

80
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I never had these before.

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I don't really eat Taco Bell.

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Oh, I broke the nacho.

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
What's new?

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Mmm!

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
They're not pretty good.

86
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Have money, Minko?

87
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
That sounds really interesting.

88
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Do you feel the suggestion for that game?

89
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
No, I didn't get cinnamon twists.

90
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
I don't like those. They're gross.

91
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
I had them before. I didn't like them.

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,760
I keep breaking the chip. I can't even pick it up.

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Good night.

94
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Night night.

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Forever eating on stream.

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Baja Blast is spicy but has no flavor.

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
It's like soda water.

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I got the cantina meal.

99
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,760
So it's a cantina burrito with a cantina taco.

100
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Hi!

101
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
They are nasty.

102
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
I can't.

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Let's see if this is good.

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I'm kind of flat.

105
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Mmm!

106
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
This is very good.

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Want some help?

108
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
This is very tasty.

109
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm like pleasantly surprised.

110
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Mmm!

111
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,760
There's no rice in it that I can see.

112
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
I usually get the steak chalupa.

113
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
I like the chicken chalupa.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
I don't know. I haven't had that in years though.

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I don't think they ever brought it back, did they?

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
I don't know.

117
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
The chicken.

118
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
It's like made out of chicken.

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I thought that was really tasty.

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
You guys really like my outfit, huh?

121
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
You guys are going crazy.

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Chalupas are bangers.

123
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I like the breading.

124
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
I like soft tacos.

125
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
I don't really like hard tacos.

126
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
I just end up choking and almost dying.

127
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm about to enter the shadowkeep.

128
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Well,

129
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,760
I've already broken Micola's charm.

130
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm just going back and I'm getting the ice perfume bottle thingy

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
so I can fight Mesmer.

132
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,760
The food is actually making me feel better.

133
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Oh, my dams.

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
She literally drew a dick in my hand, guys.

135
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I can't stop giggling at it. It looks so silly.

136
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
I don't know.

137
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Yeah, we know.

138
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
It's something.

139
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
It's something.

140
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Oh, Miwa sending me nice messages.

141
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Hold on, I need a message from Miwa

142
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
because now I'm just checking all my discord messages.

143
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Miwa is very sweet.

144
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,760
She's like, I'm sorry for the delay, for the role play.

145
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
And I'm like, don't worry about it.

146
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

147
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
It takes time.

148
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Um,

149
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
I don't know.

150
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
I don't know.

151
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
I don't know.

152
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
I don't know.

153
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
I don't know.

154
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I don't know.

155
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
I don't know.

156
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
I don't know.

157
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
I don't know.

158
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
I had a really good day today.

159
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Today was a really good day.

160
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Well, it wasn't, it wasn't a good day

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
because of my ISP.

162
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
And because I threw up this morning

163
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
and I didn't get any sleep.

164
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Excuse me, but my friends just made it a lot better

165
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
and you guys made it a lot better.

166
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
I'll be honest with you.

167
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Hi.

168
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Hello.

169
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Um,

170
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
okay.

171
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
You definitely have to go to the bathroom for you.

172
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I feel like, hold on.

173
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Let me, I see take my kitty to the litter box.

174
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
You're gonna hear her squeak.

175
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
She's on my desk, by the way.

176
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
I have a disabled cat.

177
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
I just don't work.

178
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
I have to carry her around with everybody.

179
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Everybody gets the gist.

180
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Yeah.

181
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Here.

182
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Let's do it in the litter box.

183
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
There you go.

184
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Okay.

185
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Poop to your heart's content.

186
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Via poops and they're like human size, by the way.

187
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Her shits are bigger than mine

188
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
because her body moves so slow to like

189
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
do it.

190
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Via, don't eat the

191
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
wait, leave her alone.

192
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
She's trying to do shit.

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
I lit, hold on.

194
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
I literally throw her stuff in the toilet.

195
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Ah!

196
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
What is happening?

197
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Is this what you want?

198
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Is this what you're into?

199
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
She's taking care of my disabled cat.

200
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
She's taking a poo and she's trying to eat litter.

201
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Can you stop?

202
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
She like tries to chew

203
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
on the um

204
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
and play with the like

205
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
litter pellets and it's like really funny to me.

206
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Damn girl, that's huge.

207
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
I have some gloves next to my desk

208
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
that I usually put on so I'm going to do that right now

209
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
and then I'll wash my hands.

210
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Shit, girl.

211
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Oh my god, that's like

212
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Yeah, I knew you had to use the bathroom.

213
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
I brought you earlier before I started stream.

214
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
I don't know why.

215
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Holy

216
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Her face when she's pooping is funny.

217
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
My god.

218
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
I've had the urge so many times

219
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
to take a picture

220
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
to show you guys.

221
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

222
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm just trying to move you out of the way so I can help you.

223
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Damn girl.

224
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
That shit stinks.

225
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
What?

226
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
I'm dying.

227
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Are you still shitting?

228
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Are you done?

229
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
I definitely have to give you a bath tomorrow

230
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
because

231
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
you're still pushing. I can see it on your face.

232
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Boomi, leave her alone.

233
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
She doesn't need to be bothered when she's pooping.

234
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
I have shit all over my hands.

235
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
You might be wondering, Sheevie,

236
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
how the heck can you eat after this?

237
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
I'm hungry. I haven't eaten all day.

238
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
And honestly, I'm so used to taking care of Fia

239
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
that I'm just like whatever.

240
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
It's like...

241
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I don't know what to do with my hands.

242
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
I've got too much shit all over them.

243
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
I'm not going to wash them in the sink.

244
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Goring gloves.

245
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Don't worry.

246
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
All right.

247
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Okay.

248
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Okay, I still have to clean her.

249
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
I'm so sorry.

250
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Hello, Miss.

251
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Oh, I can't put you back on the bed

252
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
because you have to go back.

253
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
You have to go in the deep end.

254
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
You stink, girl.

255
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
I'm going to die.

256
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
I want to see what you guys are saying in the chat.

257
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
I can't tell.

258
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm embarrassed.

259
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
It's a lot of love.

260
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
I have to find that clip

261
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
because I literally, there's a clip of me

262
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
in my PL

263
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
and I'm like, sorry guys, hold on.

264
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
My cat's shitting and I have to hold her up.

265
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Hi, ma'am.

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Hi, Miss.

267
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Where are your wipes?

268
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Where did your wipes go?

269
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Where did I put them?

270
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Hello?

271
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Boomi, can you stop trying to attack my feet

272
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
when I'm trying to take care of your sister?

273
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Thanks.

274
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
What are you...

275
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
What are you doing, dude?

276
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
He's like waiting to pounce on me.

277
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Where I need a trash bag.

278
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Trash bag.

279
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Trash bag.

280
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Trash bag.

281
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I know.

282
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
When you come over here for like,

283
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
you don't get something.

284
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Hello, ma'am.

285
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
He is patiently waiting for me to wipe her ass.

286
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Tomagotchi's are a different story.

287
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Oh, no, I'm almost out of wipes.

288
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
I'm going to use these last ones.

289
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
But I have extra wipes.

290
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
They're just not...

291
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
specifically for cats.

292
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Let me wipe your butt with that tissue first, ma'am.

293
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
You're going to hear Fia squeak

294
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
because obviously I don't think anybody likes

295
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
their butt being wiped.

296
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Unless you're a baby.

297
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Even then. Or you have a fetish for that.

298
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
I don't know.

299
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Hi, Shibi. How's it going?

300
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm wiping my cat's ass because she just shit.

301
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
So it's comfortable.

302
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Hi.

303
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Hi, Steven.

304
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Yeah, I'm going to wipe your stinky gross butt.

305
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
That's a lot more than I bargained for.

306
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
You get some more tissues.

307
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Uh, I should go.

308
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Boomi, get your head out, please.

309
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
He's like, I would like to smell version.

310
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Thank you very much.

311
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Hi, if you're new here and you're like,

312
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I just came to watch a cute cat girl play Ellen Ring.

313
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
I'm sorry, I have a disabled cat

314
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
and I need to take care of her first and foremost.

315
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Because it's a gorilla.

316
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm like, whatever.

317
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
You guys can listen to me do it

318
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
because the bod's probably going to be gone anyways.

319
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Because I just delete a lot of gorillas.

320
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Hi.

321
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
I know you don't like this, Lily.

323
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
What?

324
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

325
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
She's like, you are violating me, mother.

326
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
You can't lick your own ass, so

327
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
this is the only option we have.

328
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Alright, so

329
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm going to pick you up and I'm actually going to take you out of the mailbox.

330
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Yeah.

331
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Yeah.

332
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Oh, you can hold yourself up pretty good.

333
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm impressed.

334
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
You can hold up her front and half.

335
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Alright, I'm going to wipe your bum.

336
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
I am a mother.

337
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
First and foremost.

338
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Why does madam hate gorillas?

339
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
What?

340
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Do you want me to keep this up?

341
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
I don't know if anybody wants to hear me just like

342
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
talking about taking care of my cat.

343
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
I don't know.

344
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Poor bod game.

345
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Okay, fine. I'll keep the bod up.

346
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
I don't think my content is good enough

347
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
to keep up a lot of time.

348
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
And it's a gorilla.

349
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
It's not even scheduled.

350
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Hi.

351
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
She sounds like she's saying no.

352
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Oh, she growling.

353
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Sorry, ma'am.

354
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
You're a rear.

355
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
He's retaking care of

356
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
angry baby.

357
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Mother, stop touching my ass.

358
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Well, I have to.

359
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
It's entertaining shit.

361
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Pun intended.

362
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
My gorillas are comfy.

363
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
You think, is this comfy?

364
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Is this comfy for you?

365
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Are you extremely comfy

366
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
hearing me talk about

367
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
how I'm taking care of my disabled cat

368
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
and wiping her ass?

369
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Does that get you going?

370
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Shut up, Mari.

371
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Yeah?

372
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Alright, yeah.

373
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
She's looking at me like I just killed her dog.

374
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Are you mad at me?

375
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
No, don't be mad at me.

376
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Please.

377
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
You literally have poop on you.

378
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm trying to help.

379
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Yeah, you're definitely

380
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
getting a bath tomorrow.

381
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
You're getting a bath.

383
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
But you've been through a lot of stress,

384
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
so I'm not going to do it to you right now.

385
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Are you stink?

386
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
You're a poopy baby.

387
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
You have a poopy baby butt.

388
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Pooey, what are you doing?

389
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
I'm going to pick you up.

390
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm going to pick you up.

391
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm going to pick you up.

392
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Why are you screaming?

393
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
You just made me get poop on my arm,

394
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
so thanks for that.

395
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Now she's a little bit more global,

396
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
so she's hard to control.

397
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I want to let you form

398
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
your head to your toes,

399
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
and I want to...

400
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
You feel better now,

401
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
because you pooped?

402
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Loomie, go like

403
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
be useful and lick your ass or something.

404
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
I don't know.

405
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm going to wash my hands.

406
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
I have some.

407
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Hands washed.

408
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Baby put to bed.

409
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
I'm going to wrap her up in a little blanket here.

410
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
You want a blanket?

411
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
I'm sorry for, you know,

412
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
the final move

413
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
without me.

414
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
What is that?

415
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
What is that?

416
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
There you go.

417
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Now you're all tucked in

418
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
and snug into a bugger rug.

419
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
But you're getting your bath tomorrow.

420
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
I need to let a candle cause

421
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
God damn.

422
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
All right.

423
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
What about we were playing Elden Ring, right?

424
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
I need a fork.

425
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
I need a fork for my potatoes.

426
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
I accidentally

427
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
kind of

428
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
twisted my ankle

429
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
when I was going down the stairs.

430
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I stepped down on my ankle

431
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
when I was going down the stairs

432
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
because I didn't take the elevator.

433
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
I took it back up though,

434
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
because I wasn't even...

435
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm like, ow.

436
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
You did say your child's mommy issues.

437
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
If you were

438
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
in pain,

439
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
if you were a little vegetable,

440
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
if you were paralyzed,

441
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
I'd take care of you the same way.

442
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
No.

443
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
They don't hiss at each other.

444
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
They only will hiss at each other

445
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
if one boomy's being annoying

446
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
like he is right now, he just hopped on my desk.

447
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Um...

448
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Hey!

449
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Don't try to take the fucking nacho.

450
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Um...

451
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
He's trying to have my fucking potatoes!

452
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
And

453
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
if they come back from the vet

454
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
and they smell weird, then

455
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Reina especially, Reina hates the vet

456
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
and she hates the smell of the vet.

457
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Did they give me an extra taco?

458
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Can you

459
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
go over there, sir?

460
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
I don't know if boomy could eat any of these.

461
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
I don't know if they...

462
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
They probably have garlic and stuff.

463
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Boomy, you want a little cheese?

464
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Actually...

465
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Well, you know what? You don't deserve it anyways.

466
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
You were an absolute piece of shit

467
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
this morning.

468
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Sorry, that's him skating in the background.

469
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Yep.

470
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
It's zoomie time.

471
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
You know those pictures I posted of them

472
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
snuggling

473
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
and like Fiya like

474
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
grooming him and stuff?

475
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Because they were grooming each other.

476
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
And I was like, oh nice!

477
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Because Fiya can't really groom herself.

478
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
I have to give her a bath or I have to wipe her down.

479
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
This little like

480
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
anti-dander wipes

481
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
and like spray her and like kind of do like

482
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
waterless shampoo.

483
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Oh my god, boomy.

484
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
He's making such funny noises when he's running around.

485
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
And I was like, oh nice!

486
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
And they haven't snuggled like that in a bit.

487
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
And then I leave and I come back

488
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
and Fiya's fucking screaming because

489
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
he has her by the throat.

490
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
And I'm like, boomy!

491
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Fiya was like, you know how Fiya was like

492
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
meowing like you heard her?

493
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Like even more like, ahhhh!

494
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
And I'm like, oh my god!

495
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I went, I got up to go

496
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
what was I doing? I went to the closet

497
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
to, I think

498
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
to change my shirt because I like

499
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
I don't know if I spilled something on it.

500
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
I can't remember.

501
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
And he's here for Fiya's

502
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
screaming.

503
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
And I'm like, oh my god, boomy!

504
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
You're being so good.

505
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
And then Reina was yelling at me.

506
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
Boomy keeps eating her food.

507
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
And so Reina comes

508
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
like

509
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Reina will come over to me, yell

510
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
and I'm like, what?

511
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
And I look over and Boomy's eating out of both

512
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
of the cat dishes.

513
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
And Reina tells on him.

514
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
And so I have to go

515
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
and um

516
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
put Boomy in another room

517
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
so Reina can eat.

518
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
This has been happening for the last like two days.

519
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Why would I film

520
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
my cat

521
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
chewing on my other cat's neck? I know

522
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna record

523
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
my cat's enacting violence.

524
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Like I recorded Boomy and Fiya when Fiya

525
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
was able-bodied

526
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
and they were playing with each other.

527
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Hello.

528
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
My hair Reina yell

529
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
cause I think Boomy took her food again.

530
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Cause I fed her and then I went

531
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
downstairs to get my food.

532
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Did I accidentally order steak?

533
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
I don't think I'm gonna finish this.

534
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
But I'd rather have the steak chalupa

535
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
than the taco.

536
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Cause I just clicked on my order from last time

537
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
which was like a couple months ago.

538
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
And so I must have

539
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
um

540
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
had his chalupa with it.

541
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Bonus!

542
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Boomy, I apologize.

543
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Yeah, honestly

544
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
he can mess with me.

545
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
He just can't mess with Fiya.

546
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
That's like not cool.

547
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
If I could

548
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
please open Elden Ring.

549
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Where had a cord?

550
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Well the reason why me

551
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
I was taking so long

552
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
my Taco Bell's cold now but it's fine.

553
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
The reason I was taking so long

554
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
for me and Yana's stream

555
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
was because

556
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I woke up late.

557
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
I woke up at like 7.30

558
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
at like 7.20

559
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
and I was like shit.

560
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
And so I quickly

561
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
had to throw everything together.

562
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
And set up everything.

563
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Game's a bit loud.

564
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Your mom's a bit loud

565
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
when I rammed her last night.

566
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
I don't know.

567
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Um

568
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
but yeah

569
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Eepie

570
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
everybody

571
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
cry.

572
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
You guys are funny.

573
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Oh

574
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
You know I don't usually like that

575
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
like type of cheese but

576
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
sour cream they got pretty good.

577
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
Yeah I was just improv. It was really funny though.

578
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
It was Elden Yana's idea.

579
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
I liked it a lot.

580
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Because I was going to like

581
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
actually try to teach her ASMR

582
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
and like try to do a better job than I did with Para.

583
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
But

584
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
we decided to go in a Mimi direction.

585
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
What the heck did I drink?

586
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
I drank leftover dry ice water

587
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
that's been sitting in a cup.

588
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
I meant to just like gurgle on it

589
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
but then it tasted so bad.

590
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
That's why I gagged.

591
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I was like that one meme

592
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
with Eric Andre

593
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
where I just shoot you over a gun.

594
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Mm-hmm

595
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
Yeah it was fun.

596
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
It seemed like a lot of everybody was entertained.

597
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
I haven't checked if my tomagachi is dead.

598
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
I

599
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
feel like a tomagachi has like a microphone

600
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
or

601
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
some sort of motion detector

602
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
because sometimes when I move past it it'll wake up

603
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
and it kind of freaks me out

604
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
because it'll be like sheebie.

605
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Oh my god it turned into the fucking cactus again.

606
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Oh my god.

607
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Just die. Just die. Just die.

608
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Just die you fool.

609
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Just die.

610
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I don't know if you heard Reino just hissing at Boomi.

611
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Boomi, she doesn't want to play with you.

612
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Boomi, come here.

613
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Come here.

614
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Come here.

615
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Don't stare at me like that.

616
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
You're some boy.

617
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Why are you

618
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
posting up like that for?

619
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Okay whatever.

620
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
I don't know.

621
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm not telling what the good news is.

622
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
I can't tell you. It's not my place to say.

623
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Okay.

624
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
They'll find out in another couple months

625
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
or whatever.

626
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
It's a secret.

627
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Well I'm just saying a couple months because I'm just

628
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
I don't know how long it's going to take.

629
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
No.

630
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
There's no NDA.

631
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
What? I do it for a sheebie snack?

632
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
What's a sheebie snack?

633
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
What would be a sheebie snack?

634
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Hold on. Let me make myself smaller.

635
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
I'll be a cat for the remainder

636
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
of the stream I suppose.

637
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Since you got I'm like too lazy.

638
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
I was going to throw a blanket on and everything

639
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
but I'm too lazy.

640
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
You know what's really funny?

641
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Me

642
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

643
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
What's happening here?

644
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
What's going on?

645
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Uncrustables?

646
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Oh my god. I have uncrustables.

647
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
A while ago. I actually just remember

648
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
they're in my freezer right now. Thanks guys.

649
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
I literally cannot recall

650
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
why I forgot those were in there.

651
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
What am I going to say?

652
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
I forget.

653
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
I don't want to say where are my glasses

654
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
but they're on my head.

655
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
I meant to say where are my headphones.

656
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Oh my god.

657
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Post meal snack?

658
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
I know. My tummy does not have enough room

659
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
for an uncrustable right now.

660
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
I still have a taco next to me

661
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
and I'm like I can eat it

662
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
and I'm like I will puke if I try to consume

663
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
maybe in like an hour I'll be able to eat it.

664
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
It'll be cold by then

665
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
but that's fine.

666
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
Good volume. Thank you.

667
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Somebody remind me

668
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
to

669
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
turn off the candle.

670
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Blow out the candle in like

671
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
15 minutes.

672
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Your tortilla chips are pretty good.

673
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
I won't lie to you some.

674
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
I got 99 problems

675
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
and a bad tortilla chip ain't one.

676
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Also every day when my parents

677
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
are gone this week

678
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
I have to go to my mom's house

679
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
and water her plants

680
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
in the morning so after I feed Fia

681
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
I have to go to my parents house

682
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
and I'm like oh

683
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
my mom has a big garden

684
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
in the front and the back

685
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Did you get the keys to their place?

686
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,760
My mom gave me a backup

687
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,760
because my mom always has backups.

688
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
No, I still don't have my keys by the way.

689
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I saw the maintenance guy.

690
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I was scared to talk to him because he's the one

691
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
that saw my sex toys, well he didn't see my sex toys

692
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
but he saw the

693
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
door frame thing that I had

694
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
from some like

695
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
sex toy website

696
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
that said like don't

697
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
disturb my masturbating and I'm like fuck

698
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
I left that out and I left the

699
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
lush out as well.

700
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
It was the same maintenance guy

701
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
so I didn't really want to talk to him

702
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
and be like hey did you hear about the keys?

703
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Yeah does anybody remember that?

704
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Them just coming into my apartment

705
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
and me being too scared to be like

706
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
wait this wasn't scheduled

707
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
and I'm just like changing all my filters

708
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
and then going into my room and seeing all my

709
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
inappropriate things.

710
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Yeah they saw the crop as well.

711
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Yeah that was the same one that like giggled at me.

712
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
That was like oh so they all know that I'm like

713
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
they're like they probably think I'm like

714
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
this crazy oldie fans person.

715
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
What was I doing here?

716
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
This was the deeper

717
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
I just put the key in.

718
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Okay this is where

719
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
I don't know why we're going this way.

720
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm kind of scared.

721
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
I hear a lot of moaning.

722
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
I hear it sounds like

723
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
like a massive orgy.

724
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Yeah I know I'm getting the frost.

725
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Are they so like where are they down here?

726
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
What the fuck?

727
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Oh there's one of those things over there.

728
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Um...

729
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
It's not letting me lock on them though.

730
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
They're just, they're just peeking.

731
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Is there anything over here?

732
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Another hole?

733
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Yeah.

734
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Diagro please. What are you doing?

735
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Just fucking running away.

736
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
What's this hole?

737
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
I'm just gonna, why do they keep running back and forth?

738
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
I'm just gonna crouch so maybe it'll continue to Diagro.

739
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Yeah it's like waiting to like run out

740
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
and like grab me and I'm just not there.

741
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
In a room after being jumped by jar people.

742
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
So I just literally just have to keep

743
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
digging around until I find them.

744
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm assuming right?

745
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Oh my god that guy, I'm waiting.

746
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
Let's say I have a vagina on its back.

747
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm waiting for it to

748
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
just fucking run over here.

749
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
It looks like it's like I'm gonna get you.

750
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Aw you're not there.

751
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Have a good night. Bye.

752
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Oh hi Rekuma.

753
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

754
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
You're so sweet.

755
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
I hope you're having a good day, evening,

756
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
morning, night, afternoon.

757
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
I can't get up.

758
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Hello? Okay I just have to jump then.

759
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
Um, alright.

760
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Why did you yell?

761
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Wait why do I only have 5 flasks?

762
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
And since when was I plus 9?

763
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
I was plus 8.

764
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
I'm a little confused.

765
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
If you got gifted make sure you say thank you.

766
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
That's quite odd.

767
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Aw.

768
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Aw I'll put you out of your misery.

769
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
You too.

770
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Found it. Alright let's go.

771
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
I'm not going in here. No thanks.

772
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm good.

773
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Amazing.

774
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Really cool. Really nice being here.

775
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Um.

776
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
I got what I came here for.

777
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
So...

778
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Want me to finish the dungeon?

779
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Nah. Nah I'm good.

780
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
Thanks though.

781
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Maybe next time.

782
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Maybe next time.

783
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Perhaps another time.

784
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
Perhaps another never.

785
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Yeah I'm good.

786
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
I know there's a lot of more spooky stuff in this game

787
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
than the last one.

788
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
That was so loud.

789
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Since when do I have plus 9?

790
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I just...

791
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
I thought I was plus 8.

792
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Since forever?

793
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Oh okay.

794
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
I was thinking...

795
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
I probably should get more

796
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
flasks.

797
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
But...

798
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
It'll be such a bitch

799
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
to try to get all those golden seeds.

800
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Thank you.

801
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Um.

802
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Wait why did I mark that?

803
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
I don't know.

804
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
I don't know.

805
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
Oh wait.

806
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
What was that for?

807
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
I was to find the opening.

808
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
You liked me Niana?

809
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
It was honestly...

810
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
It made my day so much better to hang out with her again.

811
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
I missed her a lot.

812
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
I missed her a lot.

813
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
And it really warmed my heart.

814
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
And she was like,

815
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
I love you and I miss you so much.

816
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
And I was like, oh my god.

817
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
I'm about to cry in this call Niana.

818
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
She's so sweet.

819
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
She's planning on

820
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
getting a surgery for her cat.

821
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Because her cat is a little sick.

822
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
I didn't actually ask the specifics of it.

823
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
But I want to help her out with that.

824
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Um.

825
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
So I'm...

826
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
If she has a donut on or anything,

827
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
I'm probably going to

828
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
boost it and donate myself.

829
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Because again, as someone who has a sickly cat,

830
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
it sucks.

831
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Yeah.

832
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
I had no idea you two knew each other.

833
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Yeah, my PL, we hung out.

834
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
I bet the pow world stream on her side

835
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
is still a high boomy.

836
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
What's going on? Can I help you?

837
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
You almost stepped in the cheese.

838
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Sorry, he's controlling my character.

839
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
Can you

840
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
get off the spacebar?

841
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
Thanks.

842
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Hey, can you move your butt?

843
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Your butt's in the way.

844
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Your stinky butt.

845
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
Mister, please.

846
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
At least it's cleaner than Fia's.

847
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Sir?

848
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
You can't have...

849
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Do you want a chip? Is that what you want?

850
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
You can lick the chip.

851
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Haha.

852
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
You may lick the chip.

853
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
He's giving it little licks and nibbles.

854
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
It's quite adorable.

855
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
Boomy's actually very gentle when he takes food from my hand.

856
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Sorry, he's sitting on my spacebar.

857
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
So he's making me jump.

858
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Oh,

859
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
you can take a little bite.

860
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
You can have a little bite.

861
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Go on.

862
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
Boomy, you can't just bite it.

863
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
You have to crunch it.

864
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
You can have a little crunch.

865
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
Okay, you're actually quite adorable right now.

866
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Good boy, do you like it?

867
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
Did you hear him crunch it?

868
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
Do you like the tortilla chip?

869
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
I have to, like, monitor him while he eats this

870
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
because I don't want him to choke on anything.

871
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
Here, you have a little...

872
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
have a little piece.

873
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
You're very cute when you want to be.

874
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
Okay, well, are you done with this?

875
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
You seem to be distracted by whatever is...

876
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
there's nothing over there, but that's fine.

877
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
He's literally just taking it in between his teeth

878
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
and going

879
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
and then just, like, licking it

880
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
and then giving it back to me.

881
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
Here.

882
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,760
I'm assuming you just want the salt.

883
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
Sorry, again, he's sitting on my spacebar.

884
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
And now he's holding my hand.

885
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
He took his paw and he placed it on my hand

886
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
and he licked the chip

887
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
and he just jumped away.

888
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
All right, bye.

889
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
If there's a sixth member of Gen 1...

890
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
No, Niana will never be an

891
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
vealer.

892
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
I...

893
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,760
she is...

894
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
if I associate...

895
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
if I collab with someone,

896
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,760
please don't assume they're going to be in the next gen

897
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
or, like, whatever,

898
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
and make some of them uncomfortable

899
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
because they don't do that...

900
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,760
the content that we do, you know?

901
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Niana, although she's, like,

902
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
not exactly say so,

903
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
she doesn't do 18 plus content

904
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
and I wouldn't want her to feel like

905
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
she's, like, being lumped in

906
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
with something that she doesn't do, you know?

907
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Oh, yeah, no, I'm not...

908
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
I'm just saying it to you, like, a couple people

909
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,760
have already, like, we're saying in the chat

910
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,760
she needs to be a part of vealer.

911
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,760
Honestly, it's like, she said that

912
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
she thought it was funny and that she's

913
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,760
flattered and everything, but

914
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
how does this work?

915
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Never had this before.

916
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
Where is it? Where are the perfume bottles?

917
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Causes frost buildup.

918
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
Yeah, interesting.

919
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Oh, yeah, I have the thing that

920
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,760
re-does my F.P., by the way,

921
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,760
which is pretty nifty.

922
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
Sorry, I want to switch it to this hand.

923
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Yeah, interesting.

924
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
Oh, yeah, I have the thing that re-does

925
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
my F.P., by the way,

926
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,760
which is pretty nifty.

927
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
Sorry, I want to switch it to this hand.

928
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
The perfume bottles are quite pretty.

929
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
I just want to see...

930
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
Oh, that's just a kick.

931
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
Oh, okay, so those have a heavy...

932
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
What the fuck is in my hand? Oh, it's, like,

933
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
interesting.

934
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,760
What if I do...

935
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
It's weird that

936
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,760
I don't do, like, some other...

937
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
Like, I'm just... Why am I kicking?

938
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

939
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,760
Yeah, no.

940
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Yeah, I do want a Latina and Gen 2.

941
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,760
100% I do.

942
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,760
But Neon is not the person

943
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,760
I had in mind because I know how she...

944
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,760
how she is.

945
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
Trust me, if she was like...

946
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,760
If she turned around, she was like, actually,

947
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
I would be like...

948
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,760
I'd be like, Poggers, please.

949
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
Nepoire, this will be a stat.

950
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
Default Ash... Wait, can I change the Ash?

951
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Why is that the Ash?

952
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Wait, I can two-hand it?

953
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
Holy shit.

954
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
Do I ever run out?

955
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Do I ever run out of frost?

956
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,760
No?

957
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
You'd think this would be, like, F.P. related.

958
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,760
That's very interesting.

959
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
The good Ash is in a camp?

960
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
I'm camp.

961
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,760
What Ash?

962
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,760
Tell me, I'll go there.

963
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,760
I'm a cat.

964
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
And I dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.

965
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
Cat. I'm a kitty cat.

966
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,760
And I dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.

967
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,760
Hold on, I'm going to balance the...

968
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
I want to balance the...

969
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,760
a controller on my boobies.

970
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
It's funny, the controller is called Ice Controller.

971
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,760
I need...

972
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,760
Sweet.

973
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,760
Perfect.

974
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Can I have, like, some hands?

975
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
Do I have any hands?

976
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,760
No.

977
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,760
I only have hands that, like...

978
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
You know what I should do?

979
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,760
I should get my own controller made.

980
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
I should probably commission that.

981
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,760
I should probably get that for myself as a little Christmas gift.

982
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Sorry, I'm looking at a funny message.

983
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,760
Because Marcy posted the Gamer Sup's...

984
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,760
art in our...

985
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,760
in, like, Discord.

986
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,760
And she's like, she me dies!

987
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,760
Me!

988
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,760
And then Strati's like, she's not tan!

989
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
Because it was too...

990
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,760
It was already in the works.

991
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
So it's kind of funny.

992
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,760
My tummy is growling.

993
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,760
Okay, let me pull that back up.

994
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Oh, the candle, thank you guys.

995
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
Okay, where is...

996
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,760
Can we loot it from a flying scrub on the eastern side of the large camp with a Shadowkeep?

997
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
Is it...

998
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,760
Eastern side of the large...

999
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,760
Okay, is it within Shadowkeep or...?

1000
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,760
Hi, who do you have?

1001
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,760
What?

1002
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,760
What are you thinking?

1003
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,760
What's in water?

1004
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
Jamawa?

1005
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
I don't think it's water.

1006
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,760
I don't think it's water.

1007
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,760
I'm not sure I can share it.

1008
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,760
I'm not sure I can share it.

1009
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,760
I need the badge for the baby.

1010
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
I need the badge for the baby.

1011
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Okay. Oh my god, I'm so full from this talk, this room.

1012
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,760
Where did Romeo go? He's suspiciously quiet.

1013
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,760
Where did he go?

1014
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,760
Where's Marina?

1015
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,760
Where are my traps?

1016
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,760
Where is he?

1017
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,760
What are you doing?

1018
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,760
What do you do?

1019
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,760
Why is that your spot now?

1020
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,760
Are you happy about your chin?

1021
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,760
Can I take you up?

1022
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,760
Can I take you up by the house?

1023
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,760
Oh, yes, please.

1024
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,760
Yes, please.

1025
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,760
You're welcome.

1026
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,760
You're welcome.

1027
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,760
You're welcome.

1028
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,760
Don't be.

1029
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,760
So I have the...

1030
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
You know that cart you guys got me?

1031
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,760
Thank you so much, by the way, for the cart.

1032
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,760
It's like that I use for my groceries.

1033
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,760
I brought it...

1034
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,760
I used it to bring down some trash.

1035
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,760
And he just like, like, sleep under it.

1036
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,760
I don't know why.

1037
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Sorry, I just saw what you guys were staring at.

1038
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,760
You got your tub.

1039
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,760
Oh, thank you, no one's special.

1040
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,760
Oh, thank you.

1041
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,760
Yeah, no, so it's like, it's on wheels.

1042
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,760
And he just goes under the cart

1043
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,760
and lays under there for some reason.

1044
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,760
And Rena likes to lay inside of it

1045
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,760
when I have it out

1046
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,760
and not fold it up.

1047
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,760
How was my tummy drinking feeling?

1048
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,760
It was rumbly,

1049
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,760
but it's fine now.

1050
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,760
It looks like Rui's playing Black Myth Wukong.

1051
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,760
Oh, now I'll be able to play Black Myth Wukong.

1052
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,760
I should have put that on the schedule for next week.

1053
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
I'll do it the week after.

1054
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,760
I also have some other good news.

1055
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,760
I might be collabing

1056
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,760
with a special coddlefish

1057
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,760
sooner than I thought.

1058
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
I'm gonna go monkey.

1059
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Yeah, I've been like,

1060
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
I've been like, Strani, why haven't we hung out yet?

1061
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,760
Like we talk like literally every day,

1062
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,760
but we still haven't like,

1063
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,760
by the way,

1064
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
Strani makes like her plans like two months in advance.

1065
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
I'm not like, I'll look at the schedule

1066
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
and I'm like, why is she all the way out to November?

1067
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,760
Um...

1068
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,760
Yes, it is an FPS co-op game.

1069
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,760
And I believe

1070
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,760
that you all will be able to participate

1071
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,760
as well.

1072
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
Wait, is it outside the keep?

1073
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,760
I can't remember what you guys said.

1074
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Or like south, do you mean like south,

1075
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,760
like inside of it?

1076
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,760
Why don't I just...

1077
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
It's not overwatch.

1078
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,760
Hello?

1079
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,760
It's a fucking

1080
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,760
sheep ghost.

1081
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,760
Oh...

1082
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
South of the keep is outside?

1083
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,760
Well, maybe your south of the keep, okay?

1084
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,760
How about that?

1085
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,760
Wait, let's check if I already grabbed it.

1086
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,760
Because I'll surprise myself

1087
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
and I might have...

1088
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,760
Because I've already been through the camp, I think.

1089
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,760
Um...

1090
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,760
Let's click on this one.

1091
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,760
Uh-huh, I already have that.

1092
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
Wait, is that what we were talking about?

1093
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Oh no, we're talking about an actual war.

1094
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,760
An idiot.

1095
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,760
Um...

1096
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,760
Let's go.

1097
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,760
No...

1098
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
I'm sorry.

1099
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
That shit of war, she be...

1100
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,760
Yeah, I figured it out.

1101
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,760
I figured it out.

1102
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Rolling sparks?

1103
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,760
Is he weak against lightning?

1104
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,760
You said south of the camp.

1105
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,760
So am I just gonna run around?

1106
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,760
I think I actually almost grabbed it before.

1107
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,760
Ow.

1108
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,760
And I just

1109
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
ended up not doing so.

1110
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,760
Sorry, there's a fire golem right there.

1111
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,760
Trying to be discreet.

1112
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,760
Being extremely discreet.

1113
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,760
Being extremely demure.

1114
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,760
I don't understand the demure meme.

1115
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,760
I'm sorry, it's like not funny at all to me.

1116
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,760
I'll say it, because...

1117
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,760
You know...

1118
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,760
Of course, I'm gonna hop on trends that have nothing to do with me, but...

1119
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,760
Up a few stories east.

1120
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,760
Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry.

1121
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,760
I might die.

1122
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,760
This guy's gonna just fucking smack me in the back.

1123
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,760
Can I...

1124
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,760
Excuse me, excuse me!

1125
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,760
Oh, he took me out.

1126
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,760
Yeah, I'm like, they don't even use the word correctly.

1127
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,760
That's not what demure means.

1128
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,760
Demure.

1129
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,760
That's not what it means.

1130
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,760
I like it's so funny.

1131
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,760
I guess I'm not hip with the kids.

1132
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,760
I honestly, like, I used to be super hip

1133
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,760
because I used to be on TikTok all the time,

1134
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
but I just don't really go on TikTok

1135
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
because I'm too busy nowadays.

1136
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,760
And I'd rather just watch

1137
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,760
Elden Ring lore videos.

1138
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,760
And just lore videos in general.

1139
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,760
Um...

1140
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,760
Can I, like, jump on top of the tents?

1141
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,760
That would be making things a lot easier to navigate.

1142
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,760
He said east.

1143
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,760
East.

1144
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,760
East.

1145
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,760
He's so big.

1146
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,760
How does anybody even kill it?

1147
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,760
Don't they have, like, a million HP or something ridiculous?

1148
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,760
Oh, fuck!

1149
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,760
I didn't think you'd be able to fucking reach me!

1150
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,760
Hello?

1151
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,760
Your range is insane, brother.

1152
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,760
They're easy to kill?

1153
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,760
What do you mean?

1154
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,760
I need some kind of weapon equips?

1155
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,760
I don't really care.

1156
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,760
I'm just trying to get the fucking thing.

1157
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,760
My cat is freaking out

1158
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,760
and I can't turn and look

1159
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,760
because I don't want to get fucking shanked.

1160
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
I swear, I saw something in a tent

1161
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,760
and I bet that was it.

1162
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,760
Don't hit me.

1163
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,760
It's not very nice. Is this it?

1164
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,760
No. It's fucking Ember of Mesma.

1165
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,760
Mesma kid.

1166
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,760
They die into repulse?

1167
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,760
Really?

1168
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,760
Oh, interesting.

1169
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,760
Alrighty.

1170
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,760
Oh, is this it?

1171
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,760
No?

1172
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
Maybe? I don't fucking know.

1173
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,760
I'm stuck.

1174
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,760
I might be stuck in here.

1175
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,760
Oh!

1176
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,760
Holy fuck!

1177
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,760
I'm getting five guide.

1178
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,760
Jesus.

1179
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,760
Boomi, what are you skating about?

1180
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,760
I know Reina is hiding in my closet right now.

1181
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,760
Boomi, did you just scare yourself?

1182
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,760
Is your tail on a puff?

1183
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,760
Yes.

1184
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,760
What's the matter?

1185
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,760
Why are you staring at me like you've never seen me before?

1186
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Ah!

1187
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,760
I don't know if you just heard him run at me going

1188
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,760
grrrrrrr.

1189
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,760
What?

1190
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,760
You're in a goofy mood, huh?

1191
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,760
You just want to play, huh?

1192
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,760
I would play with you, but I don't know where

1193
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,760
your thing went.

1194
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,760
I usually give him

1195
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,760
a little...

1196
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,760
not the spring.

1197
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
It's like a little cat toy wand.

1198
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,760
I don't know where the toy wand went.

1199
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,760
Are you eating a chip off the ground?

1200
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,760
Yeah, that's the one that you broke.

1201
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,760
He's really just eating a chip off the ground.

1202
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,760
Are you happy and proud of yourself?

1203
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
Please don't choke on it.

1204
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,760
It's a small piece though, so you should be fine.

1205
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,760
How you doing?

1206
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
Did you enjoy your chip?

1207
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,760
Huh?

1208
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,760
I wish you gave kisses like Fia.

1209
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,760
Boomi, if there's nothing, no.

1210
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,760
Boomi is scared of a lot of things, actually.

1211
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,760
I can literally just look at him

1212
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,760
and he'll freak out.

1213
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,760
Or I will, like, move a certain way

1214
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
he'll freak out. If he hears a noise, he'll freak out.

1215
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,760
If he thinks he sees something, he'll freak out.

1216
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,760
I had my feet up on my desk

1217
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,760
under my blanket

1218
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,760
and he hopped up on my desk and almost fucking

1219
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,760
gave himself a heart attack because he didn't know what my feet were.

1220
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,760
And under the blanket.

1221
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,760
And he, like,

1222
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,760
was creeping up to them.

1223
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,760
And I'm like, dude, and so then I took the blanket off my feet

1224
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,760
and he was like, ah, okay.

1225
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,760
They're just feet.

1226
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,760
I'm like, why?

1227
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,760
He definitely has anxiety

1228
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,760
and it makes me sad

1229
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,760
because he used to not be like this

1230
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,760
until

1231
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,760
that time when my fire alarms

1232
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,760
kept going off because my stupid

1233
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,760
previous apartment people

1234
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,760
there's nothing in there.

1235
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,760
And, um,

1236
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,760
is this a major...

1237
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,760
Oh, what?

1238
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
I'm a little confused here.

1239
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
Oh!

1240
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,760
I didn't think he could walk

1241
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,760
that far.

1242
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
What am I stuck on? A tree?

1243
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,760
Achoo!

1244
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,760
They're so cool.

1245
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,760
That's such an interesting...

1246
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,760
They have one of my favorite boss designs.

1247
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,760
They have one of my favorite

1248
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,760
character designs.

1249
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Are these ever going to stop?

1250
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,760
Or...

1251
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,760
Okay, he's over there. At least they move slow.

1252
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,760
Thank you.

1253
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,760
No, he is on unhealthy skepticism.

1254
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,760
I'm debating whether or not

1255
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,760
to, like, start giving, like,

1256
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,760
getting him diagnosed with something

1257
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,760
like, he just is so high

1258
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
strong sometimes and it makes me sad

1259
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,760
because he'll freak out

1260
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,760
and, like, I'll open a trash bag

1261
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,760
and he'll, like, throw

1262
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,760
himself into the closet

1263
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,760
behind my dryer because he's so scared

1264
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,760
of the sound that a trash bag

1265
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,760
makes when you ruffle it

1266
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,760
just a little bit.

1267
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,760
Like, it triggers him.

1268
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Or if he hears a beeping noise, it triggers him.

1269
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,760
Um...

1270
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,760
I don't

1271
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,760
know where this thing is.

1272
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,760
Huh.

1273
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,760
Sorry, boys.

1274
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,760
Sorry. Can I jump?

1275
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,760
Oh, I can.

1276
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,760
Yeah.

1277
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,760
This is what I'm talking about.

1278
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,760
Ow.

1279
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,760
This is not what I'm talking about.

1280
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,760
Is he gonna shoot me?

1281
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,760
Haha, you missed.

1282
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,760
You buffoon.

1283
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,760
Oh, damn it, Torrent.

1284
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,760
Damn it, Torrent.

1285
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,760
Thank you.

1286
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,760
Can you hit me?

1287
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,760
I think you can.

1288
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,760
Probably.

1289
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,760
Uh, there's only a flesh wound.

1290
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,760
Ha ha ha.

1291
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,760
Flying through the east side of camp.

1292
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
I'm on the east side.

1293
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
Oh, flying scarab.

1294
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,760
I haven't seen a flying scarab.

1295
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,760
Immy raid.

1296
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,760
Hi, little sis.

1297
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,760
Hi, pin pals.

1298
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,760
I hope you guys had a good member stream.

1299
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,760
You guys have had an eventful night, huh?

1300
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,760
Hi, hello.

1301
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,760
We're just playing some Elden Ring,

1302
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,760
and I'm trying to avoid getting burnt to death.

1303
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,760
And I'm trying to find a bug.

1304
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,760
Feel free to stick around

1305
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,760
if you want, if you need to go to sleep.

1306
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,760
Totally understandable.

1307
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,760
We're just big chilling right now.

1308
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
That was a good night. I'm glad.

1309
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,760
Very eventful.

1310
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,760
I saw.

1311
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,760
But a little bit that I was in there.

1312
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,760
I was very, I was very abused.

1313
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,760
It's funny to like, be there on the other side,

1314
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,760
like part of the audience I realize.

1315
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,760
Just like how everybody speaks.

1316
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,760
Where the frick is this scarab?

1317
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,760
Bro, stop coming at me like that.

1318
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,760
I'm going to have to search.

1319
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,760
I'm wondering if it already disappeared.

1320
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,760
I might have to like,

1321
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,760
actually look up a video tutorial.

1322
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,760
Immy raid.

1323
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,760
Hi.

1324
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,760
You guys, there's a lot of raiders.

1325
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,760
Just look at the map.

1326
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,760
What do you mean? Just look at the map.

1327
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,760
The map is not going to tell me where a scarab is.

1328
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,760
Oh my god, these fucking dudes.

1329
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,760
I don't know.

1330
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,760
Oh my god, these fucking dudes.

1331
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,760
Oh, there's a bear. Hold on.

1332
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,760
I'm also a cat for some reason.

1333
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,760
Don't worry about the fact that I'm a cat.

1334
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,760
Just, I swear I'm not,

1335
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
I'm just dressing up.

1336
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,760
Oh my god, the bear is on my booty cheeks.

1337
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,760
The wiki map.

1338
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,760
Oh.

1339
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,760
That's true.

1340
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,760
Hold on, I need to run away.

1341
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,760
What's that?

1342
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,760
Ooh.

1343
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,760
Oh, it's Ember.

1344
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,760
Interesting.

1345
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Okay, am I de-aggeroed?

1346
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,760
I'm just going to pop over here real quick

1347
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,760
in your safety.

1348
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,760
I'm a cunny.

1349
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,760
I'm a cat bunny. I'm a cunny.

1350
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Finally, what I've always wanted.

1351
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,760
I'm just like the other girls.

1352
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,760
Maybe I can apply for that

1353
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,760
university that I see

1354
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,760
was followed by.

1355
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,760
Outfit's really cute.

1356
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,760
It is really cute.

1357
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,760
I'll show you more of it.

1358
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,760
It's a very cute elf. Ignore that.

1359
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,760
That's on my chest.

1360
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,760
It's very nice.

1361
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,760
It's very cute. I like being able to hit people

1362
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,760
with the bat.

1363
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,760
It's really nifty.

1364
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,760
It's funny that I can hold out my hand

1365
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,760
and be like, give me your money.

1366
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Thirsty for some reason?

1367
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,760
I wonder why.

1368
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,760
Okay, where...

1369
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,760
Where does that ash called, you guys said?

1370
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Shondo approves.

1371
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Oh my god, Shondo's new like Bimbo

1372
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,760
outfit. I'm like, oh my god,

1373
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,760
she's literally me.

1374
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,760
Like, that's so funny.

1375
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,760
But...

1376
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
Oh my god, I'm getting like...

1377
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,760
I don't know why I'm getting the sniffles.

1378
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,760
Do you watch

1379
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,760
Zuley the Witch? They do a lot of model

1380
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,760
close-ups. I do not.

1381
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,760
Sorry, I'm scrolling up the chat.

1382
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,760
I can't find it.

1383
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,760
You guys said the name.

1384
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,760
Rolling Sparks.

1385
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,760
Rolling Sparks, rolling in the

1386
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,760
D.

1387
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,760
In me, if you're still here,

1388
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,760
I hope that you have the best sleep

1389
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,760
from all your nuts that

1390
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,760
you've cracked.

1391
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,760
Alden Ring

1392
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,760
Location.

1393
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,760
Make sure

1394
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,760
you guys, you know,

1395
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,760
hydrate, pee afterwards.

1396
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,760
I know it can be, you know.

1397
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,760
You know.

1398
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,760
Peeing as they speak.

1399
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,760
Oh my god, yes, queen.

1400
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,760
Stupid ads.

1401
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,760
Oh, by the way, I'm watching a video.

1402
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,760
Please don't freak out, there's a male voice.

1403
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,760
I will choke you.

1404
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,760
Oh, okay, that's interesting.

1405
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,760
It literally was, I was right near it,

1406
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,760
but I feel like it disappeared

1407
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,760
because it's literally

1408
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,760
up here.

1409
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,760
And I was up there at one point.

1410
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,760
Okay, let me go

1411
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,760
close that out.

1412
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,760
I think that's right.

1413
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,760
Shut up, dude.

1414
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,760
Oh, it's like super up high.

1415
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,760
That's probably why I didn't see it

1416
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,760
because it's literally up high.

1417
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,760
I could just use the interactive map.

1418
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,760
Yeah, but sometimes I need a visual.

1419
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,760
Guys, I'm a visual learner.

1420
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,760
I need to quit out and reload.

1421
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,760
Okay, I can't just go to a different site.

1422
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,760
Well, we'll find out.

1423
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,760
I don't...

1424
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,760
I could be completely wrong

1425
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,760
and it could...

1426
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,760
I freaked out.

1427
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,760
I'm sorry, it choked me.

1428
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,760
I can't see, I'm choking you.

1429
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,760
Anyways, let's just head over there.

1430
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,760
Map service.

1431
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,760
No, I need like a 3D...

1432
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,760
You know, using Google Maps,

1433
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,760
I will look out at the actual

1434
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,760
like 3D rendering

1435
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,760
and like the road view

1436
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,760
because I literally need

1437
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,760
to see it.

1438
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,760
I can't just see like top down.

1439
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,760
That's why I sucked at playing Diablo

1440
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,760
because it was like a weird...

1441
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,760
It's a weird perspective for me

1442
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,760
that I just can't handle.

1443
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,760
Oh, there it is. I can see it.

1444
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,760
I can literally see it.

1445
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,760
It's right above my head if you look up.

1446
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,760
All right, that's fine.

1447
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,760
I just have to loop around.

1448
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,760
Wait, how do I...

1449
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,760
How the fuck do I get up there?

1450
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,760
How did I get up there before?

1451
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,760
Oh...

1452
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,760
Oh...

1453
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,760
Oh...

1454
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,760
Oh...

1455
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,760
Oh...

1456
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,760
Oh...

1457
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,760
Oh...

1458
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,760
Oh...

1459
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,760
Oh...

1460
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,760
Oh, then you got the perfumers

1461
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,760
right here, perfume and shit.

1462
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,760
I don't know how I'm supposed

1463
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,760
to get that down.

1464
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,760
I don't have anything to throw at it.

1465
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,760
Fuck off, lady!

1466
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,760
Okay.

1467
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,760
Wait, don't leave.

1468
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,760
I need to...

1469
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,760
I need to...

1470
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,760
I need to get off my damn horse. Where is it?

1471
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,760
No, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave.

1472
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
No, don't leave! Don't leave!

1473
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,760
Don't leave!

1474
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,760
Don't leave!

1475
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,760
What is this?

1476
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,760
I'm sorry.

1477
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,760
Panic zooming in.

1478
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,760
I thought if I had

1479
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,760
the sword out, I could still...

1480
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,760
but that's not how that works.

1481
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,760
Ow, I just poked my own eye.

1482
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,760
You're lucky you're adorable.

1483
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,760
Imagine if I wasn't.

1484
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,760
Oh, what the fuck?

1485
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,760
Why did Otto save here?

1486
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,760
I need to be on my horse.

1487
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,760
Okay, alright.

1488
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,760
I need to be well prepared.

1489
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,760
I do have magic, you're right.

1490
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,760
I don't know why I was so

1491
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,760
mentally inept for a bit.

1492
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,760
Listen, it is

1493
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,760
almost 2 am.

1494
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,760
No, not the fucking dog.

1495
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,760
Fuck you, dog.

1496
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,760
No, dog, please!

1497
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,760
Jesus Christ.

1498
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,760
I'm gonna kill this fucking dog.

1499
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
Where are you?

1500
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,760
She dumbass.

1501
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,760
Um...

1502
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,760
Anyways.

1503
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,760
Well, that's been great, boys.

1504
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,760
That's all we were gonna do for tonight.

1505
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,760
No, I'm kidding, that's not the case.

1506
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,760
Wait, where is it?

1507
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,760
What?

1508
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,760
Why am I so dumb?

1509
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,760
What are you still doing here, Dee?

1510
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,760
I'm going the wrong way.

1511
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,760
I'm going the wrong way.

1512
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,760
Here's the right way.

1513
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,760
Hi, Queen!

1514
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,760
I still have any Glover to give you.

1515
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,760
Hi, King.

1516
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,760
Wait, I need to have it.

1517
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,760
Fuck me, brother.

1518
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760
Hold on.

1519
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,760
Please, hold.

1520
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,760
Yep.

1521
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,760
Lay out my arms.

1522
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,760
I just, like, hold my arms, though, and he just cuts them off.

1523
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,760
Ash of War.

1524
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,760
Let's put a little roll in Spark.

1525
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,760
Why does it say 14?

1526
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,760
I don't understand that.

1527
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,760
I could use Storm Stop.

1528
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,760
What is Raptor of the Mists?

1529
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,760
In the arms of an angel.

1530
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,760
So he disarms you, oh my god.

1531
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,760
I've smacked your backside for that one.

1532
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,760
What does Rolling Sparks do?

1533
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,760
Can I boost this while I'm at it?

1534
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,760
Okay.

1535
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,760
Okay.

1536
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,760
Press Square on it.

1537
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,760
BOOM!

1538
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,760
I can't.

1539
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,760
I can't.

1540
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,760
I can't.

1541
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,760
I can't.

1542
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,760
Why am I so stupid?

1543
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,760
Well, listen, I'm very tired.

1544
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,760
And I've only drank Baja Blast.

1545
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,760
I'm doing my best.

1546
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,760
I didn't hold on.

1547
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,760
I need to put on the crying.

1548
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,760
I'm doing my best.

1549
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,760
I'm trying my hardest.

1550
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,760
My eyes are burning because I rubbed them after touching spicy food.

1551
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,760
You guys still love me?

1552
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,760
I already blew out the candle.

1553
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,760
Ow.

1554
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,760
My hardest is not good enough.

1555
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,760
I'm being bullied by my own chat.

1556
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,760
And I'm supposed to be the dumb.

1557
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,760
Sorry, I was yawning.

1558
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,760
I'm not crying. I'm laughing.

1559
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,760
But they're hard to distinguish.

1560
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,760
My dad was making fun of my laugh the other day.

1561
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,760
So my dad hadn't seen my model yet.

1562
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,760
And I put on the golf collab.

1563
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:04,760
One, it was really funny because my parents thought I was Emmy.

1564
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,760
I was so happy.

1565
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,760
I was so happy.

1566
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,760
I was so happy.

1567
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,760
I was so happy.

1568
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
I was so happy.

1569
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,760
I was so happy.

1570
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,760
And now my dad is laughing at me.

1571
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,760
Too.

1572
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,760
But then my dad heard me laugh and he was like, never mind.

1573
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,760
That's her.

1574
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,760
I'm like, how did you know?

1575
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,760
You laugh like goofy.

1576
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,760
Oh my god, my eyes itch.

1577
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:51,040

01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,480
Dip my eyes in milk go wash my face

1591
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,560
I don't feel like it

I was trying to two-handed it was taking me a long time

1647
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,280
I

1648
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,280
What am I doing

1649
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,400
What am I doing

1650
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,640
I'm guarding

1651
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,680
Where's the ash of war I ordered

1652
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
Where's the ash of war

1653
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,280
I

1654
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:36,480

1655
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:45,920

1656
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,040

1657
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,280

1658
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,280
I

1659
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,720
That's the ash of war

1660
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:09,120
That's the skill is that it lets me what is it I'm confused

1661
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:18,000
What does rolling sparks do I thought I would roll and it would do sparks

1662
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,040
What the f that's fucking stupid I wanted to roll like fucking sonic

1663
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:39,520
Try dual wielding and then L2 what I am already dual wielding

1664
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,640
I said you want me to step off the stairs

1665
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,080
I don't see no fucking sparks

1666
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,520
I don't see no Nicholas sparks up in here

1667
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,520
I

1668
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,480
Know I can roll like sonic. I thought that was the one that rolls like sonic

1669
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,680
Now I have them both out

1670
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200

All right, well

1674
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,760
Fabulous let's see how this works

1675
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,680

1676
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,720

01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,800

01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,160

1687
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,800

Yeah

1693
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:12,640
I'm dying where the tissues go. I thought I put them next to me. Oh, they're over there

1694
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:24,640
Then I go back to my sword. Well, I'm gonna go back to heal and just reset everything

1695
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,800
I have to get up what do you mean I have to get up

1696
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,760
Oh

1697
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,640
No, I know what you mean again. I'm forgetful

1698
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,360
I want to make some babies. I want to get it up

1699
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,240

1700
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,640

1702
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,920
I didn't have to get up. I just rolled over in my chair

1703
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,760
Get it up

1704
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,160
It must be your face

1705
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:07,760
Or it's your body if it ain't your body then it must be your face

1706
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,600
Screwing and moderation screwing is such a bore

1707
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,480
None of my time is wasted. I do that shit on tour

1708
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,840
Oh, yeah

1709
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,920
All right

1710
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,920
Oh, yeah

1711
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,920
All right

1712
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
All right, so if I do a little

1713
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,600
What the fuck

1714
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,360
If I do a little

1715
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,360
If I do a little

1716
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,840
If I do a little what the fuck I thought

1717
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,640
Oh

1718
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,640
I didn't have them equipped

1719
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,040
Let's go

1720
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,640
All right

1721
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,800
Yeah, I'm gonna go sit down again

1722
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,620
I sound like I'm fucking drunk when I'm just tired

1723
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,040
I'm off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard. I'm just gonna up two hand this for a second

1724
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,880
I need to sit back. I'm like I have the worst posture right now

1725
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I may put up my little

1726
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,240
foot rest

1727
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:30,160
If only I was well actually I could play from my couch, but you just hear you just your distant she be the entire time

1728
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:36,320
Yeah, I was literally just shrimping. I normally don't shrimp, but because I'm tired. I can't hold my fucking titties up with my back

1729
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,600
No, why are you here? I'm not here

1730
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,120
You can't see me

1731
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:03,760
I'm not here. You can't see me. I'm not here. You can't see me

1732
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:11,040
What the where the fuck am I going? Oh what the hell

1733
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,120
Uh anyways

1734
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,400
Oh, what the I thought I could knock you off

1735
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,200
All right, I did

1736
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,800
Oh

1737
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,760
Oh

1738
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,920
Oh

1739
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,440
Oh

1740
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:37,200
I just got killed by a fucking soul. Honestly the NPCs in this game are so difficult

1741
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,600
They are so much more harder than the base game

1742
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,560
Um, just yeah, those guys like the axe guys keep getting me

1743
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:55,120
They got me before when we um

1744
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,800
Ever get where we were

1745
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,520
In that uh in the catacombs

1746
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,040
I

1747
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,160
I almost would just beat my head against the microphone

1748
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:43,440
I keep dying in the most stupid way. Yeah, I don't know what that noise was either. That was a gasp

1749
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,520
Anyways

1750
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,840
It's fine

1751
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:03,600
I came in like a wrecking ball. I never meant so hard enough

1752
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,200
All I wanted was to break you

1753
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,840
Anyone you wrecked me

1754
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,040
The ai's just better

1755
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,080
Because I still get them in what was that was like three or four hits

1756
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,320
Festive grease. What is the festive grease off?

1757
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,200
You scared me

1758
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,200
Were you trying to knock me off?

1759
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,360
I don't what was going on there. Is anybody else in here?

1760
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:36,160
Just getting up

1761
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,160
Do be do be do body

1762
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:50,640
Oh no, sweetie, come back. You know, you're probably just dropping armor. I don't really care that too much

1763
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,920
Oh my god, a smithing stone one

1764
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:59,360
Something so far. Oh my god. They gave me the smithing stones. I need it

1765
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,360
Wait, okay, sorry

1766
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:08,000
Don't shout. Don't shout. Don't shout. Don't scream be quiet

1767
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:14,720
Oh, fuck. Uh, you guys didn't hear that, right? Can I like

1768
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:23,840
Too bad we need like 15. It's fine. Uh, I'm gonna go for you first

1769
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:32,720
And then well, he's getting back up. I'm gonna fucking run for my life

1770
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,440
And try not to die

1771
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:44,320
Oh, no, you don't no, no, I can't get out of the corner

1772
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:52,800
Oh, not the corner. I like his little his uh his

1773
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,440
I like you cut G. No, what's it called the twin blades? Yeah

1774
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,880
Yeah

1775
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,920
He cheated. Yeah, he corner locked me. That's not that's not a fucking sentence. What you guys know what I mean

1776
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,840
I don't even know I'm fighting them. I can literally just run past everybody

1777
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,920
But again, sometimes I just want to fight people

1778
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,600
And see what they drop. So I actually will probably go kill that guy

1779
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,120
Although these guys will probably aggro me

1780
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,760
and these guys

1781
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:26,320
No, don't knock me off the fucking thing and don't do it

1782
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,280
The other guys are gonna come up behind me

1783
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,640
No

1784
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,440
Nice

1785
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,000

She's going up and up and up and rolling out of the way

01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,800
She's rolling and going and jumping

1854

Over in this direction. I didn't mean to fucking swing

She's going the distance. She's going for speed. Fuck off

She's going down the stairs. Holy fuck. These are not stairs

01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:09,920
She's going to the store and opening it and hoping that they don't hit her

1986
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,360

Can you guys direct me to the nearest stairway? Thank you

1989
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:07,120
No, you just want to throw flames at me instead

1990
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,120

1991
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:12,240
Um, I'm just gonna heal. Oh fuck. Oh shit

1992
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:18,480
Oh my god. Okay. I'm gonna have to start killing some of you. No, you're gonna kill me first. Oh, please

1993
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,320
I don't want to

1994
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,320
I don't want it

1995
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Can I just sit down?

1996
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,440
Go away

1997
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:38,240

01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:53,040
Did I get I know just sitting down fuck up my runes. I don't really care that much to be honest with you

2000
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,680
Why can't I find

2001
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,760
The stairs

2002
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,080
I

2003
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,160
Thought they're over there, I guess they're not you're right walking around is a lot easier

2004
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:21,680
Where the fuck are the stairs?

2005
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,360

You're gonna kill me. You're gonna kill me. You're gonna kill me. No, you're not. No, I forbid it. I forbid it. I forbid I forbid it

2011
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Stop auto walking. Oh here it is

2012
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:51,200

2015
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:08,080
All right, let me just hi

2016
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:18,400
Okay, thank you. I appreciate your you're really sweet

2017
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,160
Oh

2018
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,240
I can't

2019
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:30,880
I'm on fire. I'm poisoned and I'm on fire and there's probably I'm gonna grab this and somebody's probably gonna fucking shoot me

2020
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:35,200
Oh, yep, it's you. It's you. You're the you're the bitch

2021
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:42,240
You know guys, I think I hate this area. I take it back. I think I think I hate it. I take it back

2022
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,200
You guys are gonna destroy all the important tomes

2023
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:02,720
Anyways, let me look at the chat

2024
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,560
I don't even know do I even have enough

2025
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:19,520
What did I want to put it put it into intelligence or dex did you guys say should I put it into the strength? I don't know

2026
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,480
I

2027
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:29,280
Was back is on the first floor here. I do want to talk to him because I know he has some interesting lore stuff to say

2028
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:39,040
Good night your eepiness has peaked. Oh have a good eep

2029
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,720
Have the best eep

2030
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
My nose is killing me

2031
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:54,960
I can't just go to 60 intelligent, but I don't even have like

2032
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:59,120
I don't even have like

2033
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,040
sorceries

2034
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,680
Like I haven't run into any sorceries in the dlc

2035
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:08,640
Like what's up with that? Are there no sorceries in the dlc?

2036
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,080
I feel like this is incantations

2037
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,800
And

2038
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,640
Mpc is a good chunk of them

2039
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:27,040
Are you familiar with how level caps and soft caps work in this game? Yeah, I think it was soft caps

2040
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:30,320
Intelligence at like 70

2041
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:33,840
Invigorate 60. Isn't that the case? I don't fucking know

2042
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,840
I

2043
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,760
Endurance in mid

2044
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:50,160
Are you saying I'm mid? Oh, what the hell would I just knock over?

2045
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:58,960
There are very few sorceries, but most are boss powers like remembrances

2046
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:07,280
Lightning rim. Oh, that's right. That's what it's called. No

2047
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:16,880
For weapon damage soft caps at 45 oh

2048
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:22,080
Oh soft caps at 80. I thought it was 70

2049
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,040
Okay

2050
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:36,400
Let's just do intelligence. Although I kind of want strength so I can weird wield those fucking

2051
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,960
Um

2052
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:45,200
Well, I can always just respect it doesn't really matter because I want to be able to read wield Rinaldo's sword

2053
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:47,520
That's Rilana's swords at some point

2054
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:57,360
All right, now I don't have to worry about these fucking

2055
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,920
Oh

2056
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:07,920
It's down here besides a dead man

2057
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,520
It's just a Denver

2058
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:16,080
Oh my god, please just you guys need to relax like

2059
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:23,920
Live a little or something. Why is that there's no stairs there? Why is that guy just okay? You need to sit down stop

2060
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:29,280
Take a step back breathe. Oh, you have a lot of money. So I'm gonna kill you

2061
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,400
Sorry, you give extra

2062
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:35,200
Yeah, you too. I'm

2063
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:38,640
I'm not lucky. I've accidentally clicking the non lock-on button

2064
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,300
It's probably a hundred like I probably get another level killing everybody in this place

2065
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:45,460
Stop

2066
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:51,860
It I'm gonna keep spamming you because you're too short and I can't see

2067
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:54,660
past my tears

2068
02:02:55,620 --> 02:02:57,620
From my oh fuck off

2069
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:02,180
You missed motherfucker where's on spot?

2070
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,940
Oh, he's not even aggroed

2071
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:14,900
Will he get poisoned that would be funny

2072
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:24,740
All right. Well sick

2073
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:30,740
Stop

2074
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:33,860
It's like I'm fighting an annoying child

2075
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:37,860
Okay, you said Anzbach is on the first floor

2076
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:41,140
Let's take a look see poo around

2077
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:44,900
That's just

2078
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:50,580
You can't hear me right if I crouch behind you you guys get easily

2079
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:55,860
Oh, I can't do the timing for that. I don't want to have to fight all of you

2080
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,900
I'll go up here

2081
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:05,140
This is where it's safe

2082
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:16,980
It's funny I wanted like I wanted like a faith int build when I first did this and now I'm just like fully in

2083
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:20,100
Do you have anything important up here?

2084
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:24,020
No, oh, there's a long

2085
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:28,900
Long road. Oh, can I jump on the feet?

2086
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:33,300
Why are you so far away and I can't hit you

2087
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:39,700
I'm gonna get poisoned in a second. Oh, I'm on the feet. Haha. I'm on the beat. Oh my god. I'm on his ass

2088
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:44,420
No

2089
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:46,420
Go away

2090
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:54,260
I'm busy climbing up a horn scent. Oh, don't mind if I do

2091
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:58,260
Don't mind if I do

2092
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:06,260
What is he just scarring here your arm? He just fucking cuts off his arm and leaves it there

2093
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:18,980
Well, I know I passed him but I got distracted by the grace. What do you expect?

2094
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:20,980
Wait, can I level up my scottish scabba?

2095
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:24,900
I can't okay. Well, fuck you then. Um, oh, it's interesting

2096
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:29,860
You know, I'm wondering I'm interested in the uh, is this an actual body or is it like a statue?

2097
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:31,860
It looks like it's an actual body

2098
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,860
You think it has an actual dingaling

2099
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:36,420
And then yeah, then you have

2100
02:05:38,420 --> 02:05:42,420
I don't know man because this looks and it's it's interesting that they hang them up and they do the rune of

2101
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:44,420
I

2102
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:48,980
Don't know man because this looks and it's look it's interesting that they hang them up and they do the rune of

2103
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:51,540

2104
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:53,540

not well

2106
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:58,580
I don't think that worked out for me

2107
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:08,740
Um, can you jump back on his head? I like it I should have been able to make that

2108
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:15,460
I feel like I should be able to jump back on his head

2109
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:22,260
I well

2110
02:06:25,780 --> 02:06:27,780

02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:39,140
And then get poisoned

2149
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:40,260
Yeah

2150
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:44,740
Do I have any of the staunching boluses? Oh, I fucking smacked him back. Oh

2151
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:48,420
Interesting

2152
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:52,820
Cool, um

2153
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:55,860
Oh, can you

2154
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:58,340
I'm not here

2155
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:04,900
No, I hear him walking towards me

2156
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:10,980
Okay

2157
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:21,220
I guess I'll just be poisoned. I look like I'm just stinky

2158
02:10:21,860 --> 02:10:23,860
Stop

2159
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:26,820
Don't try it

2160
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:32,420
Oh, what telepart explore

2161
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:37,780
I explore that would mean explore the area with the bookshelves. I've already explored

2162
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:42,420
All the books. Oh, no, I haven't I think there was like a whole side I missed

2163
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:49,060
Hi, how's it going? I'm just gonna kill you all before you kill me. I'm so sorry

2164
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:53,060
I don't know what's happening here

2165
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:03,620
What's that beast horn fascinating I'm still stinky

2166
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,900
I thought you said the first floor

2167
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:12,740
Isn't this the first floor

2168
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:16,660
You sons of bitches lied to me

2169
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:21,540
How could you hold on I'm poking around

2170
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:30,980
No, can you stop

2171
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:34,180
Can we just can we just stop the madness?

2172
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:37,060
Can we stop the sadness?

2173
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,180
So smithing stone

2174
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:45,640
Thanks. Oh look at this. I can just walk on down and then I can pop a squat

2175
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:48,820
Right here

2176
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:57,700
This is not the first floor this is this is the ground floor then you have the first floor and then the second floor

2177
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:02,180
This is not the first floor. This is the ground for us the bottom floor

2178
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:09,300
This is not the first floor

2179
02:12:10,820 --> 02:12:14,980
Unless you consider like from here to here then okay, then I would understand

2180
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:26,020
Yes, in America the ground floor is the first is the first floor. That's what we call it the ground floor

2181
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:28,900
um

2182
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:33,940
Come on out. Can I jump up there and just like completely just fucking get you?

2183
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:46,580
Oh my god

2184
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:49,220
Well, am I getting an allergy attack?

2185
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:59,700
Okay, so Anzac is on this floor guys. You don't have to try to school me on what floor it is. I generally don't care

2186
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:04,660
I don't care if you call it the fucking nymph floor

2187
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:14,500
I just need you to explain it in dumb terms for me

2188
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:19,140
It's the lobby

2189
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:25,860
Okay, Anzac is that no

2190
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,500
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you

2191
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:39,060
What you want some you want some you want he wants some he wants it he's getting it

2192
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:44,180
First section

2193
02:13:47,540 --> 02:13:52,020
Is he over here?

2194
02:13:55,220 --> 02:13:57,220
Nope

2195
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:09,220
All right, well I would came from there. I didn't really explore this way

2196
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:13,300
So I will

2197
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:16,260
Go over here Anzac are you over here?

2198
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:21,860
Excuse me, sir. Why is it so fucking dark? This is just a fucking corner

2199
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:26,260
What the fuck where am I?

2200
02:14:28,820 --> 02:14:30,820
Hello

2201
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:35,380
Oh, oh, thank you

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I apologize. I'm so sorry

2204
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:03,780
It's a dead end. Oh, yeah, just kidding. You're right. Wait, why is this like

2205
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:09,940
Why is this bookshelf fake? It's a fake fucking bookshelf

2206
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:18,100
Oh my god, I can't breathe. I have to breathe out my mouth. There's a lever. Oh

2207
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:30,980
I see I'm finding fucking secrets, bro. You see this shit. Oh shit. This is where uh, yeah, that's cool

2208
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:33,220
Nice

2209
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:41,780
Oh my god, stop I can't breathe

2210
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:55,300
You said he's he's uh, total opposite of the grace. I was waiting for this man to assault me

2211
02:15:55,380 --> 02:16:02,660
Come up come closer. He's moving at a slow pace to come beat my ass

2212
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:07,860
You know what he's actually not he's not you're not too bad old man

2213
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:13,380
Oh, nope. He's posted up now. Stop stop. We were friends and then you ruined it

2214
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:16,340
Why do you have to do that?

2215
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:18,340
We were having a good time

2216
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:26,340
So in the area where that flame night was like there was like oh, but there was like three places where one was working

2217
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:29,060
What are you talking about?

2218
02:16:30,660 --> 02:16:32,660
There was like a bunch

2219
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:44,260
You mean in the corner over here, sorry

2220
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:48,660
Stop it

2221
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:58,580
Oh, it's over here

2222
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:04,180
Ooh, something's gonna jump out at me. Oh, no

2223
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:08,020
Nothing

2224
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:10,020
Nobody's gonna fucking try to assault me

2225
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:14,260
It's all right nice sick

2226
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:19,140
We love to see it

2227
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:27,620
What he's living in the corner, what do you mean? I don't see him

2228
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:31,540
Hello

2229
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:37,380
How the fuck am I supposed to see this guy? He literally blends in

2230
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:42,100
He blends in

2231
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:52,100
No way I guys I have explained to you. I can't see in games

2232
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:58,020
Why don't you understand? I can't see in games

2233
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:02,020
Hi

2234
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:04,500
It's been like two days

2235
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:09,380
Yeah

2236
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:12,100
Here I am

2237
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:16,820
I don't even know why I'm talking to you. It looks like a rock

2238
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:21,940
Dynastic

2239
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:28,180
Yeah, because his fucking ass turned

2240
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:33,300
I almost said radigan. It's turned to run on to him used him and to run on

2241
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:38,020
Excuse me

2242
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:47,620
You know what's interesting to me is that Ronnie and Micola are honestly a lot more alike

2243
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:51,140
And then you'd think

2244
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,820
Like micola is a shit person

2245
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:57,780
Honestly, Ronnie is too because she takes she took squad wins soul

2246
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:05,380
I mean bought body killed his soul and killed her body so she can you know separate herself from her two fingers

2247
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:09,940
And but like and he was a good. He's a pretty good dude. It seemed

2248
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:17,860
And this left him a fucked up husk and made like death root and stuff

2249
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,180
and Micola

2250
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:22,340
This goes ahead and uses the same method

2251
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:25,860
Except he uses it a mogwin

2252
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:31,860
Not mogwin mog and just takes his body for his own purposes

2253
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,740
Yeah, Ronnie was way more

2254
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:38,420
Direct

2255
02:19:44,980 --> 02:19:46,980
Somebody clip this

2256
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:53,860
I couldn't see him. What do you tell if I'm running around you don't even fucking see him

2257
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:57,380
I also didn't remember what he looked like

2258
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:00,900
Okay, like can I

2259
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:05,220
What am I doing? Wait, let me see if I exhausted all of his dialogue

2260
02:20:08,420 --> 02:20:10,420
Hey

2261
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:19,140
Yeah, you know what they did with this body they turned it into another person against there that persons will

2262
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:25,300
Because we don't know if Radon wanted to be a part of that vow

2263
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:32,100
Because it's funny because it's because like Micola liked I feel like Micola wanted Godwin to be his a consort first

2264
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:34,100
But then he made had Radon do it

2265
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:42,340
Because then he just became obsessed with Radon unhealthily

2266
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:48,500
I fell asleep in my chair in a minute go to sleep go to bed

2267
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:50,740
I

2268
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:58,100
Have no idea what's going on. Well, I only like I just like listening to stuff about like I like watching video essays about the lore

2269
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:01,380
But I don't literally I don't go out of my way to like

2270
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:07,940
Usually talk to NPCs and like actually figure out what the fuck they're saying and piece stuff together. I usually don't care about that

2271
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:10,820
um

2272
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:16,260
Okay, where is the stair

2273
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:18,260
Or fuck

2274
02:21:19,220 --> 02:21:22,980
Where's this elevator? Oh my god, please

2275
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:28,740
What is the where does the elevator lead to

2276
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:34,100
This is not the elevator. Oh

2277
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:42,340
Don't do it. Oh, you did it. You did it. Look what I had to do. Look what I had to do

2278
02:21:43,060 --> 02:21:48,980
Young child obsessed being not like his mom but ends up like his mom and even worse like

2279
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:54,900
I I generally like I was very interested in Micola's character in the base game because I was like

2280
02:21:54,980 --> 02:21:59,700
I was really wondering what his association with st. Trina was and everything and then like oh, these are the same people

2281
02:22:00,980 --> 02:22:06,100
And just like figuring out how the same they're the same people and stuff. Um, what are you fucking waiting for?

2282
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:10,180
Smother fucker, um

2283
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:16,740
I fucking kicked this little man. Um

2284
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:25,540
Another area I can explore

2285
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:32,020
What do you mean? Is there stuff that's like worth it there? Or is it like a fucking rota fruit?

2286
02:22:33,380 --> 02:22:35,380
Rota leaf

2287
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:37,780
Down the lift

2288
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:40,020
Where's the lift

2289
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:48,260
I won't lie to you. I don't know how I missed this room before

2290
02:22:49,700 --> 02:22:51,700
Oh

2291
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:53,780
Uh

2292
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:56,420
Go

2293
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:05,700
More another ash for the perfume why damn this is a fucking fast elevator. I'm getting dizzy

2294
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:10,180
Jesus christmas

2295
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:17,940
Hello, is anybody gonna fucking attack me? There's a jar person. That's uh, no, it's not. Whoa. Why is this place so fucking big?

2296
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:27,060
Oh my god. Yeah, that's great. That's that's absolutely lovely. Um, anyways

2297
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:30,500
Stop it

2298
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:39,860
I should have fucking knew it there's always there's always there always I didn't mean to press that

2299
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:43,860
They're always gonna find a way to jump scare you. Oh, look at the little jar people

2300
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:47,940
I look like they're having a lot of fun

2301
02:23:51,460 --> 02:23:53,460
This is a better ash

2302
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:59,380
I kind of want to jump down and like just lay down that fucking guy, but I'm not going to uh, because I'll probably just

2303
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:01,300
Eat shit

2304
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:03,300
Let's go

2305
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:07,140
The fourth floor

2306
02:24:11,060 --> 02:24:13,060
I

2307
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:18,020
Do it no balls

2308
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:25,700
Like I honestly just want to get to mesmer this is all like but don't tell me how

2309
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:30,420
This is pretty

2310
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:37,780
Kind of want to jump off damn this is genuinely like a really

2311
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:43,140
I hear bird. What is that? Oh, it's a bat

2312
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:48,900
This is generally this is a really fucking huge castle and it's really amazing level design

2313
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:54,180
You're gonna come get me a little bat. You're just gonna be up there

2314
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:05,780
Like I'll probably do some more exploring off stream, but

2315
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:07,940
But

2316
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:10,260
What the hell

2317
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:12,260
Why are you doing fucking

2318
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:14,740
Faith shit at me now. Um

2319
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:19,700
Can I please just like come up here and explore the area for like five seconds?

2320
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:30,260
I'm sneezing I can't do this

2321
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:32,260
Oh

2322
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:43,540
I almost rolled off can you fall off that would be fucking great. I'm really crying tears

2323
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:48,660
Stop you're gonna kill me. Oh

2324
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:55,700
How am I still alive that doesn't make any sense I should have died a long time ago

2325
02:25:56,420 --> 02:25:59,620
Oh, okay, that's not very nice

2326
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:03,860
Oh

2327
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:12,660
Oh, that was pretty neat

2328
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:18,500
Oh, I'm still getting up. How's your stance not broken?

2329
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:22,100
Am I gonna have to spam on you? I'm stuck

2330
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:29,620
It doesn't matter though because you're dead. I wish you'd drop your fucking sword her whatever the hell

2331
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:32,180
I think I have enough health

2332
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:42,100
What's gonna fucking jump out? Oh, yeah some bats. Oh, it's down here

2333
02:26:44,820 --> 02:26:48,500
Oh my god, chill out. This is some dudes. Oh, okay

2334
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:51,860
It's pretty neat

2335
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:58,660
Mesmer really I wonder why what the significance is for mesmer to have all these. Um

2336
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:05,140
Oh, yes, I think that that scroll is actually like an important plot point. Um

2337
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:13,780
To have all these tomes and then like he has like paper and he has stone

2338
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:16,980
Very interesting to me

2339
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:23,700
Like why why why did he collect so many books, you know, but you guys all fucking looking at there's nothing there

2340
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:26,020
I guess I'll just leave you alone

2341
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:38,740
They're literally what are you guys staring at usually sometimes when they have dudes like staring at like mean something

2342
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:43,860
Yeah, that's right. It's on box quest. That's why

2343
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:51,700
All right, coming here you stupid fucking bat. I don't even know how your friends like followed me

2344
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:55,700
Uh, sorry, I was just scared that I was gonna clip through the

2345
02:27:57,540 --> 02:27:59,540
I was gonna clip through the damn

2346
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:02,740
No wall

2347
02:28:04,820 --> 02:28:13,380
What you doing EEN? That's cute. Oh, there's another one. There's another one

2348
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:19,940
Oh

2349
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:26,260
Oh, I didn't think you would hit me. I don't know why I can't tell the depth of what's happening right now

2350
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:37,620
Okay, I wonder what these ember mesmers probably to make a mesmer fire grease or something

2351
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:45,060
Hi, you're probably gonna try to kill me so I'm gonna kill you first. I'm so sorry

2352
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:50,740
I'm just fucking through him. Jesus. You too

2353
02:28:55,300 --> 02:28:58,100
That was kind of a delayed reaction. Uh, I can't see

2354
02:29:01,460 --> 02:29:03,460
Not again

2355
02:29:08,020 --> 02:29:10,020
You're gonna kill me

2356
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:15,780
Let's just just stop. I only have one flask left bro. It's my last flask

2357
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:35,380
Bitch

2358
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:39,140
Huh

2359
02:29:40,980 --> 02:29:42,980
Yeah

2360
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:49,540
Is she above me? Bitch can't read for some reason

2361
02:29:52,820 --> 02:29:57,860
There's a grease up one more flight. I assumed as much because I hear Freya nearby. Yeah

2362
02:30:02,260 --> 02:30:06,580
What the fuck are you looking at looks like I push you to the fire

2363
02:30:10,980 --> 02:30:12,980
You're stepping on stuff

2364
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:18,980
He's literally downstairs. I don't know what to tell you

2365
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:37,780
Alrighty oh, that's a way to take the stairs I suppose

2366
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:49,940
Sorry, I meant to be sneaky. Yeah, what's a spirit calculus? I've never heard of that

2367
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:58,100
Fascinating. Oh, I was debating whether which way to go but since you walked by

2368
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:01,140
You were over here

2369
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:03,140
I'll go this way

2370
02:31:03,220 --> 02:31:06,020
Oh, this is a dead end. Can you stop spinning?

2371
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:08,020
Oh

2372
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:20,500
Hey Freya you want to help me?

2373
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:25,300
That's a fucking fire

2374
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:33,860
Am I in the shadow realm? No, I don't know what you're talking about

2375
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:40,340
What the hell I can already tell that there's so many places to go in this fucking place. What?

2376
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:47,540
How where what are you doing? Why are you just running at me?

2377
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:52,260
I'm trying not to fall off

2378
02:31:55,620 --> 02:32:02,180
How did you I actually hit b before our r1 before you could do anything so that's extremely confusing to me

2379
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:07,540
Freya is indifferent to my suffering

2380
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:14,180
Okay, it's getting a lot harder to get through

2381
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:19,300
The shadow keep that I thought it was I thought it was gonna be pretty straightforward

2382
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:25,940
I thought it was gonna be like, um, you fucking just stop

2383
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:28,660
Oh

2384
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:36,420
My god, brother, they are pretty tanky and fast. That's very

2385
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:42,660
Sick outfit. I kind of remind me of Renault with her little stupid fucking hats

2386
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:49,540
You enter from two different directions, that's pretty that's very interesting

2387
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:55,620
All right, let me grab my roots

2388
02:32:58,020 --> 02:33:04,980
And I'll kill you how about that? Oh, oh, I'm pressing b but you have me stun locked

2389
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:10,580
What the hell bro? I hate you

2390
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:13,140
I

2391
02:33:14,820 --> 02:33:19,780
Could only imagine what the damage is with without the talisman that I have on

2392
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:29,300
They're not even tough

2393
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:37,060
Like I'm leveled enough that it's not really super tough. It's just like I'm just not really playing properly

2394
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:39,380
Oh

2395
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:48,980
You're gonna get me again. Oh my god

2396
02:33:50,900 --> 02:33:53,860
It's like I'm someone who I just I like I'm not really like

2397
02:33:55,140 --> 02:34:02,340
Perceptive or strategic with my roles like I'll watch some eldering players and they know the moves that

2398
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:04,340
I

2399
02:34:04,660 --> 02:34:10,980
Very well and like if I paid closer attention, then I would probably fare better but because

2400
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:18,500
Because if I am how the way I am I should not have given you the high ground Anakin

2401
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:29,940
Stop just stop you're ridiculous. Oh my god, you're so angry

2402
02:34:30,740 --> 02:34:32,740
No, don't come over here

2403
02:34:34,980 --> 02:34:37,940
Can I knock you off are you gonna keep spinning?

2404
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:44,660
You're my z

2405
02:34:51,380 --> 02:34:54,340
Oh pretty deep off because I'm ebh3am

2406
02:34:55,780 --> 02:34:58,660
What am I doing? What am I doing tomorrow today?

2407
02:35:00,260 --> 02:35:01,620
technically

2408
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:03,620
What am I what's my stream?

2409
02:35:05,380 --> 02:35:07,380
What am I doing?

2410
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:09,700
What am I streaming today?

2411
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:13,700
I don't even know

2412
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:24,420
Borderlands too, okay, but what's that time is that at four? I don't fucking know that you walk downstairs sweet

2413
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:26,660
What

2414
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:34,020
There's a whole place I should totally just drop down. Oh

2415
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:38,580
Stop

2416
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:40,900
I just want to steal your shit

2417
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:46,500
There's tons of dead bodies everywhere that you guys don't bother to clean the fuck up. So I'm gonna do it for you

2418
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:50,420
There's a lever

2419
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:53,460
What is this for

2420
02:35:54,740 --> 02:35:56,740
What the hell

2421
02:35:56,740 --> 02:35:58,740
What the hell

2422
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:00,900
Stop creeping at me

2423
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:02,260
fucking weirdo

2424
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:03,380
fucking

2425
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:04,980
pervert

2426
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:06,980
What the fuck

2427
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:10,580
What the fuck am I looking at here?

2428
02:36:12,660 --> 02:36:14,660
Oh my god

2429
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:18,100
It's pretty cool. Oh, it's actually really fucking sick. I'm just impressed

2430
02:36:18,740 --> 02:36:20,740
I

2431
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:28,340
I've never played Borderlands before I picked FPS's except for Titanfall that I haven't really played before like I've never played

2432
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:36,180
Fallout New Vegas and ever I don't know Fallout New Vegas really isn't an FPS to me. It's mostly just a

2433
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:39,860
RPG

2434
02:36:40,980 --> 02:36:43,860
It's fun though. Hi. How are you guys doing?

2435
02:36:48,580 --> 02:36:54,180
By my lord makes it who is she is that Freya?

2436
02:36:56,420 --> 02:36:58,420
Oh it is

2437
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:03,860
Um, I'm gonna pop a squat real quick

2438
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:16,420
No, you you'll be surprised I'll wake up at 7 or 8 a.m. Tomorrow because my body just automatically wakes me up super early

2439
02:37:17,220 --> 02:37:23,220
Um, sometimes I'm awake, but I just don't tweet yet because I'm just like I'm still like doing stuff

2440
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:26,020
Like I'm still waking up and taking care of the babies

2441
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:29,140
um

2442
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:37,620
But yeah nine times eight eight times out of ten I wake up at literally like

2443
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:44,820
Seven oh fucking fuck bro

2444
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:47,060
Oh my god

2445
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:51,860
I just

2446
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:54,100
I just literally hate him

2447
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:57,620
How did you get down here so fast?

2448
02:37:58,900 --> 02:38:00,900
What is up with the tracking?

2449
02:38:02,580 --> 02:38:07,140
That's ridiculous the AI for that particular

2450
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:13,300
Stop oh that actually thank you. Thank you so much

2451
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:17,700
Thanks

2452
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:25,620
Ow, it's fine

2453
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:35,380
Oh, this is pretty cool. Look at it. It's uh, am I supposed to jump?

2454
02:38:36,580 --> 02:38:40,980
Well, actually technically I can just walk. Oh, oh, please calm down

2455
02:38:40,980 --> 02:38:46,580
Um, what are you doing you motherfucker? You're all just standing

2456
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:53,620
Oh my god, I almost missed that jump um

2457
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:57,380
Hello

2458
02:38:57,860 --> 02:39:00,020
Why is there a stake america here?

2459
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:06,820
Why is there a stake america here? Are you secretly like a super crazy boss? No

2460
02:39:07,140 --> 02:39:13,780
I was a fucking bat doing what the bat doing

2461
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:19,140
I'm pretty sure that's where I came from before at some point. Yeah

2462
02:39:20,740 --> 02:39:24,420
At least there's only just fucking ghouls up here the ghouls are really easy to fight

2463
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:35,380
Well

2464
02:39:36,820 --> 02:39:41,780
Hi, don't mind me. Just grabbing a number of mesmer

2465
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:46,980
This is the boss room. Why are you in front of it?

2466
02:39:55,860 --> 02:40:00,340
Ow fray a shut up

2467
02:40:00,500 --> 02:40:02,500
Oh

2468
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:07,300
You are absolutely insane

2469
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:16,420
A frostbite proc is hard to get

2470
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:26,660
I do like

2471
02:40:26,740 --> 02:40:34,740
Um, ralana's armor. Well, thank god for all that. Sorry fucking wrong way. Sir. Excuse me, sir

2472
02:40:36,340 --> 02:40:38,340
Excuse me. No

2473
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:46,260
Fuck me. I just it's not nice of you. I'm I would spare you both if you would just let me

2474
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:49,700
If you would just let me

2475
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:59,540
Ah

2476
02:41:09,140 --> 02:41:11,140
Oh

2477
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:18,260
That's a really fucking cool sword. I was trying to dodge that when I was in my drinking animation

2478
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:22,580
Oh Jesus

2479
02:41:23,380 --> 02:41:28,500
He's like two completed this game. I'm about to burn to death. Oh my god

2480
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:47,620
Why am I not getting any blood proc on you just fall off motherfucker

2481
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:59,460
I realized oh cool. Nice. Oh flames beer. I like it

2482
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:09,860
It was funny because in my head immediately when I fell off

2483
02:42:10,820 --> 02:42:12,820
what started playing

2484
02:42:13,220 --> 02:42:14,100
was

2485
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:16,260
Oh fuck. I did side agrees. Um

2486
02:42:16,900 --> 02:42:18,900
Um

2487
02:42:19,220 --> 02:42:26,660
Just like I see fire just started playing in my head and if I let me all burn together

2488
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:31,300
Inside

2489
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:39,940
Wait

2490
02:42:47,140 --> 02:42:49,140

2491
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:54,340
First you have money that I want. Give me your fucking money

2492
02:42:55,780 --> 02:43:01,620
Why are they they have a lot of um, I almost fucking miss that they have a lot of rooms

2493
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:05,380
I'm surprised something like a little ghoul has that many rooms

2494
02:43:06,260 --> 02:43:08,260
He

2495
02:43:10,100 --> 02:43:12,100
Please don't fall

2496
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:15,380
Okay

2497
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:20,580
What is this animal I'm crawling on I can't really tell to be honest with you

2498
02:43:22,180 --> 02:43:24,180
Shut up for you

2499
02:43:26,100 --> 02:43:29,620
Will you who knows who knows if you ever will

2500
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:45,140
Stop I didn't mean to do that, but that actually worked out. What the hell are you healing? That's too bad

2501
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:48,260
They're dead

2502
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:52,980
I'm surprised they're gone

2503
02:44:00,500 --> 02:44:02,500
I don't want to lose all my rooms

2504
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:06,340
What is this

2505
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:09,540
No

2506
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:18,260
I

2507
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:24,260
Is it grace ahead

2508
02:44:28,340 --> 02:44:30,340
I'm trusting you

2509
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:38,740
Oh

2510
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:44,020
I believe there's a lot of scotty tree fragments in here

2511
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:49,220
I

2512
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:55,460
Can I level I don't think I can

2513
02:44:57,220 --> 02:44:59,220
Okay, okay

2514
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:12,180
I thought I had three I think I only have two fuck

2515
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:14,260
I

2516
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:16,740
Hello, who's in here?

2517
02:45:19,940 --> 02:45:23,620
Skibbity tree wait, is this mesmer?

2518
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:29,540

2519
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:33,300
Why the fuck am I walking like this?

2520
02:45:36,740 --> 02:45:38,740
Oh my god, I'm anxious

2521
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:48,740
Damn you're really calling out my mixed race like that

2522
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:09,540
Why is your voice hot

2523
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:16,340
There was like an edit of mesmer as like a daddy and I'm like bet

2524
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:27,460
Although his limbs are pretty long although all the proportions in this game are fucked

2525
02:46:35,380 --> 02:46:37,880
I'm gonna cover your eye

2526
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:44,340
You are your mother's son

2527
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:48,740
Oh beam

2528
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:55,860
Geez that's definitely an erupting opening. I don't really know your moveset at all

2529
02:46:57,620 --> 02:47:00,100
I like I've seen gameplay of people fighting you

2530
02:47:01,540 --> 02:47:03,540
Oh

2531
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:06,820
Ah how am I alive?

2532
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:12,020
Thank you for letting me heal that was pretty kind of you

2533
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:22,580
I heard mesmer is pretty weak. Oh, I should dodge to the side for that definitely impaling me bro

2534
02:47:30,500 --> 02:47:32,500
Well

2535
02:47:33,460 --> 02:47:38,260
Mesmer's not mesmer's mesmer's he's a fucking sneaky poo

2536
02:47:41,620 --> 02:47:46,260
There's a summon. Yeah, I don't care. I'm doing it myself. I'll do a summon later

2537
02:47:48,180 --> 02:47:50,340
I like to see what their moveset is

2538
02:47:54,580 --> 02:48:00,340
Oh, I should probably not be as close to you. You're really, you know, you're kind of tall

2539
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:04,660
Oh, interesting

2540
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:12,100
I love this. How does this make you feel? Okay, you can get out of it. That's nice. I have literally too hell

2541
02:48:18,980 --> 02:48:20,980
Uh

2542
02:48:21,060 --> 02:48:23,060
For some reason

2543
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:31,700
He has a really cool moveset I like it I like the little sneaky poos

2544
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:34,500
He's cute sneaky poos

2545
02:48:37,140 --> 02:48:42,420
Yeah, because I like I like to like try them by myself a cup only a little bit like, uh, I

2546
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:45,620
I feel like

2547
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:50,500
Um

2548
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:53,540
Why are you oh

2549
02:48:55,380 --> 02:49:00,260
I'm getting the same feels that I felt with one of the lies of p characters when you're fighting the king of the puppets

2550
02:49:00,340 --> 02:49:02,340
I'm like, oh, oh

2551
02:49:02,820 --> 02:49:04,820
Little twinks coming after me

2552
02:49:11,060 --> 02:49:16,580
Don't worry, I'm not gonna beat him like this. Don't you think I'm gonna beat him by myself. I'm gonna try

2553
02:49:21,060 --> 02:49:23,060
Not that it's gonna happen

2554
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:29,380
I just want to see the type of damage I can do let's let's do a little

2555
02:49:31,220 --> 02:49:33,220
Little sparkly

2556
02:49:34,980 --> 02:49:38,180

02:50:28,340 --> 02:50:30,340
Damn, okay, I might level up

2567
02:50:35,780 --> 02:50:39,620
I'll accidentally get up three at a time I'll log off I'll like end stream

2568
02:50:39,620 --> 02:50:42,340
I'll be like all let me try one more time and then I fucking kill them

2569
02:50:42,740 --> 02:50:47,940
I kind of killed R'nala and three try R'alana and three tries off stream. Um, let me

2570
02:50:49,780 --> 02:50:51,780
Um

Why I'm literally brain dead right now, uh

2572
02:51:01,940 --> 02:51:03,940
I'll see that

2573
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:11,380
It's because I just I don't I think I do this lock in better when I'm um

2574
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:14,900
Off stream and sitting on my couch

2575
02:51:16,340 --> 02:51:18,420
I'm going the wrong fucking way. That's how tired I am

2576
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:21,460
Although no, if I was if I was awake, I would

2577
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:24,260
Where am I?

2578
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:29,700
I would also be going the wrong way. What was this door always open. Oh, that's Fia's room. What the fuck?

2579
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:32,100
I'm so out of it

2580
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:37,700
Hi, um

2581
02:51:39,620 --> 02:51:43,300
I don't have any money I'll suck your horn

2582
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:51,060
Oh

2583
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:04,660
I was I was here like five seconds ago

2584
02:52:13,460 --> 02:52:15,460
Okay

2585
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:18,020
He needed that

2586
02:52:19,140 --> 02:52:21,140
Whatever that is

2587
02:52:23,540 --> 02:52:25,540
I'm changing the ash of war

2588
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:33,700
I'm about to become the perfume master

2589
02:52:37,300 --> 02:52:42,100
Okay, I'm gonna do like a couple more attempts and then I'm gonna go to bed because I am delirious

2590
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:50,420
I

2591
02:52:57,060 --> 02:53:03,300
Nine I do the bells off stream. What do you mean the bells?

2592
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:16,420
Let's try it queen. What are you doing?

2593
02:53:19,300 --> 02:53:23,860
Okay, I should probably jump to the side instead of backwards for that

2594
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:35,300
How did you hit me?

2595
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:39,540
Oh like that

2596
02:53:41,460 --> 02:53:43,460
He is a fun fight because

2597
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:46,500
Why is my hitbox so small?

2598
02:53:46,580 --> 02:53:48,580
He's very

2599
02:53:50,580 --> 02:53:51,860
He's very

2600
02:53:51,860 --> 02:53:57,700
It's very interesting move set, but it's not too difficult. It is definitely like an entertaining move set like it is it

2601
02:53:58,740 --> 02:54:02,180
Like it's it's challenging, but it's not frustrating, you know

2602
02:54:03,140 --> 02:54:05,140
It's all it's all about timing

2603
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:07,860
That I don't have

2604
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:10,740
You

2605
02:54:13,620 --> 02:54:16,980
Why am I getting hit by that suddenly when I was able to dodge it before

2606
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:24,420
Get frosted I'm not locked on you get frosted

2607
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:30,980

Malate my maricob is like, you know what I'm gonna give you the most snake fucking sounding name besides

2612
02:54:50,420 --> 02:54:52,420
With all fucking asses in it

2613
02:54:54,580 --> 02:54:57,780
Um, honestly, I bet I could beat him with the ash

2614
02:54:58,020 --> 02:55:00,020
Let's see

2615
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:09,940
Who are you? What do you who are you doing boy?

2616
02:55:12,820 --> 02:55:18,020
Because if I like just fucking yeah, yeah, yeah

2617
02:55:20,340 --> 02:55:22,340
I forgot to heal

2618
02:55:27,860 --> 02:55:34,660
Actually, maybe not because I was hoping if I actually just give just the come back here

2619
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:39,460
Oh my god, I'm getting caught up in the crossfire

2620
02:55:45,140 --> 02:55:49,380
Can you please get frosted in I don't

2621
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:52,180
Quite under whoa

2622
02:55:52,900 --> 02:55:54,900
That was the oh my god

2623
02:55:55,860 --> 02:55:57,860
Definitely just got wet from that

2624
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:03,540
Holy shit, that was fire get it

2625
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:11,620
Dodge forward into him. Yeah, it seemed like that was the thing to do. Okay, so maybe

2626
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:15,620
Maybe

2627
02:56:15,940 --> 02:56:17,940
It isn't

2628
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:21,220
Like

2629
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:23,300
It's definitely not that easy

2630
02:56:25,460 --> 02:56:27,460
Hiking

2631
02:56:30,660 --> 02:56:40,340
Ow, why did I roll that close no help actually, what are you gonna do? Oh my god

2632
02:56:45,300 --> 02:56:51,620
See that's what I wanted you to do and you weren't doing that before you fucking Jesus Christ, it's kind of cool to watch

2633
02:56:54,980 --> 02:56:59,460
Like literally I'm pretty sure this is like the king of puppets fight in lines of p

2634
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:06,260
Does he does the same thing? He throws you up and he impales you on like a spear and I remember playing and being like

2635
02:57:09,380 --> 02:57:11,380
I grabbed does hurt like hell

2636
02:57:11,380 --> 02:57:18,660
Um, no, it's I'm not it's mostly me like fangirling over how awesome that the fight is choreographed

2637
02:57:19,300 --> 02:57:21,300
To be honest with you

2638
02:57:24,900 --> 02:57:26,900
Oh

2639
02:57:34,900 --> 02:57:38,340
No, I went too early. Thank you for letting me get up

2640
02:57:40,340 --> 02:57:42,340
No

2641
02:57:44,500 --> 02:57:47,860
It's really it's all it's literally I need to do my timing better

2642
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:50,980
I think I'm just are you is he waiting leopard print? What the fuck is that?

2643
02:57:51,700 --> 02:57:54,580
I know it's snake skin. I was very confused for a second

2644
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:07,860
I don't really think it has to do with leveling maybe you know, I could probably get some more scabbadabba to do but as fragments, but

2645
02:58:09,220 --> 02:58:13,220
I might do that. I might get some more scatter tree fragments and come back to it later

2646
02:58:13,220 --> 02:58:15,220
I

2647
02:58:19,460 --> 02:58:24,260
Wonder if you can like repost him and he are like, can you backstab him? I don't know

2648
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:27,700
What's his poise like?

2649
02:58:28,340 --> 02:58:29,700
like

2650
02:58:29,700 --> 02:58:31,700
I don't know

2651
02:58:36,660 --> 02:58:38,660
Ow

2652
02:58:39,460 --> 02:58:41,460
Damn, so please don't

2653
02:58:44,100 --> 02:58:45,220
I

2654
02:58:45,220 --> 02:58:51,620
Comes like in the process of standing up. I kind of do anything. Oh, they have a little way. I didn't notice he has like little fucked up wings

2655
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:03,460
You know, I was literally I would do this

2656
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:07,380
You know, what was it? Oh, no as when I was two-handing I would do that

2657
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:10,740
And it literally knocked down ralana

2658
02:59:11,460 --> 02:59:13,460
Uh after two hits of doing this

2659
02:59:14,420 --> 02:59:17,860
So I'm wondering if I do that for him if it will

2660
02:59:19,460 --> 02:59:21,460
Stagger him as much as did ralana

2661
02:59:23,460 --> 02:59:25,460
So we'll see

2662
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:28,900
I jumped way too fucking early

2663
02:59:32,500 --> 02:59:36,660
Oh, my timing is all off. I'm gonna see if it works. Nope

2664
02:59:37,380 --> 02:59:39,380
Oh

2665
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:41,540
Okay

2666
02:59:41,700 --> 02:59:43,700
All right

2667
02:59:43,940 --> 02:59:45,940
Nice

2668
02:59:48,180 --> 02:59:50,180
Thank you

2669
02:59:51,540 --> 02:59:53,540
Oh you fucking bitch

2670
03:00:00,660 --> 03:00:02,660
I can't get close enough to him

2671
03:00:04,500 --> 03:00:06,420
He is

2672
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:08,420
Some wide range

2673
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:14,500
Damn, I'm already dead brother

2674
03:00:17,140 --> 03:00:19,140
He's a lanky motherfucker

2675
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:25,700
So if I I never block

2676
03:00:27,220 --> 03:00:30,900
I never parry. Uh, I parried a fucking lot and uh

2677
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:34,420
Lies a pee because you have to

2678
03:00:37,060 --> 03:00:39,060
You

2679
03:00:43,220 --> 03:00:47,860
Wait, can I can I please get up dude? I just want to practice parrying you

2680
03:00:55,540 --> 03:00:57,540
No, I can't parry a grab

2681
03:01:07,380 --> 03:01:10,660
We'll see we'll see

2682
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:17,140
I need a tear from the golem

2683
03:01:18,820 --> 03:01:22,660
Yeah, I never really I never parried any time I played Elden Ring

2684
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:27,220
I only parried when I like if I was playing like what like Bloodborne I'd probably do it

2685
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:32,820
Um, but otherwise

2686
03:01:33,540 --> 03:01:35,540
Ow

2687
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:38,420
Yeah

2688
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:44,980
Yeah, I can't I don't think I can parry him

2689
03:01:50,500 --> 03:01:57,860
Well, yeah, I might have to get more scabbadabadabada fragments. I literally just want to practice parrying him. That's all I want to do

2690
03:02:06,500 --> 03:02:08,500
All right, I'm not gonna even

2691
03:02:15,540 --> 03:02:17,540
Okay

2692
03:02:20,580 --> 03:02:22,820
Oh, I got him once

2693
03:02:27,060 --> 03:02:29,060
I got him once but I don't

2694
03:02:29,620 --> 03:02:33,780
What is the parry tier two I don't

2695
03:02:35,140 --> 03:02:40,420
Is it improve your parrying? I don't know how it does that because that's all again. I bet it's funny

2696
03:02:43,060 --> 03:02:45,060
Out um

2697
03:02:45,940 --> 03:02:50,260
I was very like I'm pretty okay at parrying

2698
03:02:51,940 --> 03:02:53,780
Thank you

2699
03:02:53,780 --> 03:02:55,780
No, no, how did you fuck you bro?

2700
03:02:56,820 --> 03:02:58,820
No

2701
03:02:59,300 --> 03:03:01,300
Yeah

2702
03:03:01,540 --> 03:03:03,540
I thought he was gonna throw me off the map

2703
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:10,180
That would have been sick actually if you just fucking chucked me off of the arena. This is a nice arena. I like it

2704
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:18,260
Pretty nifty Bloodborne and Sakura was built for parrying but I never felt parrying as primary K

2705
03:03:18,580 --> 03:03:20,580
It's really not though

2706
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:23,220
It's really not um

2707
03:03:24,020 --> 03:03:29,700
I actually prefer parrying I like the timing of it

2708
03:03:37,460 --> 03:03:39,460
I'm still sitting down

2709
03:03:40,740 --> 03:03:42,740
Oh, I can't parry that

2710
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:44,660
Oh

2711
03:03:44,660 --> 03:03:47,220
Okay, I give the fuck up. I definitely can't parry him

2712
03:03:47,220 --> 03:03:51,540
I I don't have the timing right to attempt to parry him if I could dodge

2713
03:03:52,100 --> 03:03:55,540
If I can't dodge because I don't have the timing right. I'm not going to be able to parry

2714
03:04:00,500 --> 03:04:03,860
Dodge we sink it at mitigation. I understand. Um

2715
03:04:05,540 --> 03:04:08,020
I'm gonna end it here because it's almost 4 a.m

2716
03:04:08,980 --> 03:04:17,140
And I'm quite tired, but we will probably I might do some when I wake up. It depends. Um, I might do some

2717
03:04:17,700 --> 03:04:19,700
just like looking for

2718
03:04:20,100 --> 03:04:23,700
Golden seeds and more uh scottotree fragments

2719
03:04:25,540 --> 03:04:27,940
I might do that sort of farming off stream

2720
03:04:28,580 --> 03:04:34,340
Um, and then I'll try to go for maybe I'll we'll just I might not go to mesmer right away. Maybe I'll like

2721
03:04:35,220 --> 03:04:39,380
Scoot scoot about and look at other people look at other um

2722
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:44,180
Little mini bosses like I know I could probably fight like the other guy that rides the hippo

2723
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:47,620
Maybe I sucked with the hippo. So who knows?

2724
03:04:48,340 --> 03:04:50,340
The excuse me

2725
03:04:50,340 --> 03:04:54,740
Look for bell bearings. Uh, yeah, I have to get the bell bearings too. That's a good point

2726
03:04:55,220 --> 03:04:58,740
Um, I might not do a gorilla elden ring for a little bit

2727
03:04:58,980 --> 03:05:03,300
I'm probably just gonna work on like the next couple days just like farming stuff

2728
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:06,420
Um, so I could set up for the next

2729
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:15,620
Stream and everything um, but yeah, I hope that you guys had like a fun time hanging out with me for a little bit

2730
03:05:15,700 --> 03:05:21,700
I apologize um for the stuff with my cat, but you know, when you gotta go you gotta go

2731
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:25,380
Um

2732
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:29,540
But I hope you guys have a good rest of your night or day or evening or morning

2733
03:05:29,620 --> 03:05:30,900
I kind of like

2734
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:36,900
like late night stream like this because um, I feel like the chat's nice and slow and I can kind of

2735
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:39,620
Interact with you guys better

2736
03:05:40,340 --> 03:05:42,180
No, the cat's okay

2737
03:05:42,260 --> 03:05:48,180
Um, my throat is starting to itch and my nose is totally blocked and I've been breathing through my mouth

2738
03:05:48,820 --> 03:05:53,540
I'm probably going to snore because obviously when my nose is blocked my mouth opens

2739
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:58,100
I still have a taco to eat but I can't eat it

2740
03:05:59,220 --> 03:06:02,340
Someone's that stick it in the fridge and have a taco for breakfast

2741
03:06:03,780 --> 03:06:05,300
Maybe

2742
03:06:05,300 --> 03:06:07,300
So far my tummy is fine

2743
03:06:08,260 --> 03:06:11,460
I kind of I can't really tell if it hurts a little maybe because I haven't been focusing on it

2744
03:06:11,940 --> 03:06:13,940
Maybe I just need a fart. Who knows?

2745
03:06:14,260 --> 03:06:15,540
um

2746
03:06:15,540 --> 03:06:17,300
Blackface taco

2747
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:24,100
Um, but I hope you guys sleep well if you've been up staying up with me. Otherwise, I hope you have a rest of your day

2748
03:06:24,660 --> 03:06:29,460
I hope whatever you're working on if you're at work or if you're doing something in the background or if you have me in the background

2749
03:06:29,460 --> 03:06:31,460
You're just listening to me. I hope

2750
03:06:31,460 --> 03:06:33,460
That you can complete it

2751
03:06:34,340 --> 03:06:37,140
And thank you to all the lurkers

2752
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:38,660

Coming to the roleplay stream earlier. So I appreciate that. I know it was short. Um

2757
03:06:53,860 --> 03:06:58,500
We intended to have it be like a little short thing just a little funny skit and hang out

2758

My day was good because I got to meet old friends and

2763
03:07:15,220 --> 03:07:18,900
I'm not meet old friends. I got to see old friends and then I got to meet new ones

So sweet dreams dream of me

2767
03:07:34,980 --> 03:07:40,420
I won't call you stinky because I've been stinky because I was walking around with poison being a stinky girl

03:07:57,380 --> 03:08:02,820
I might break you on audio with Azura. Oh, sorry. I remember I sent it to her because she was like, can I see your half?

2773
03:08:03,220 --> 03:08:05,860
Because I don't know how to do this. I'll make sure

Um, so I haven't listened to it. So I hope that you guys enjoy

2775
03:08:14,260 --> 03:08:16,260
You know I love laughter

2776
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:20,340
Yeah, we just wanted to make people laugh and just be a little silly because we like um

2777
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:25,300
Neanna was just like I want to do one of those like meme role plays people do like

2778
03:08:26,820 --> 03:08:31,060
Like that one's like your girlfriend accidentally like fucking kills you or whatever

2779
03:08:31,780 --> 03:08:33,780
Like those like silly ones

2780
03:08:34,260 --> 03:08:35,460
Um

2781
03:08:35,460 --> 03:08:41,220
Yeah, you're only stinky because I can't smell you. So you could be stinky. Yeah, gf crashes the car

2782
03:08:41,540 --> 03:08:44,980
Um, but I just can't smell right now because I can can't breathe

2783
03:08:50,340 --> 03:08:52,340
Um

2784
03:08:53,140 --> 03:09:01,700
Showing your stink. Uh, well, I hope you guys have a good night. Um, let me see. I'm literally just gonna probably throw you into someone's chat

2785
03:09:06,740 --> 03:09:08,740
We'll see

2786
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:15,380
I don't know who's up this late probably some of my people on either side of the world

2787
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:21,860
Uh, well, I'm gonna send you to scarle, but you guys don't have to have a raid message

2788
03:09:21,940 --> 03:09:23,940
You guys can just sneak in if you want to

2789
03:09:25,140 --> 03:09:31,220
Um, because scarla is the only person that's streaming up this late right now that I can raid

2790
03:09:31,460 --> 03:09:33,460
So I didn't want them

2791
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:39,380
In the view so yeah, I can't talk you guys know what I'm saying. Um, but I have a good night

2792
03:09:40,900 --> 03:09:42,900
Um, so probably

2793
03:09:43,140 --> 03:09:45,640
It'll be funny if she says my name on the gun

2794
03:09:48,420 --> 03:09:50,980
All right, bye guys later. Have a good one
