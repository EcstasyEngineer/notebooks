trabaj   review

07:49.620 --> 08:02.620
but I was so excited for this project from the moment of its inception and I even said that in my video

08:02.620 --> 08:10.620
I was like, I just want to be a part of this. I just want to be part of something different.

08:10.620 --> 08:15.620
I want to be part of this company that's going to make waves.

08:15.620 --> 08:20.620
I want to be part of this company that's going to set a whole new standard for V-Tubing

08:20.620 --> 08:26.620
and I hope that we do. I know it's only been, it's only my second day out here

08:26.620 --> 08:36.620
but part of V-SUCKY. Hi, welcome to V-SUCKY. We'll give you some SUCKY SUCKY.

08:36.620 --> 08:52.620
I was very excited to be a part of this in my interview with...

08:52.620 --> 08:59.620
So I got the email and it was April's Fool's Day and I'm just like, this is a joke.

08:59.620 --> 09:04.620
Somehow someone figured out that I applied because I kept it on the DL

09:04.620 --> 09:09.620
and they sent me a joke email but it wasn't.

09:09.620 --> 09:17.620
And then I had the interview and then I hear...

09:17.620 --> 09:22.620
and I'm expecting to talk to some run-of-the-mill lady who's just like,

09:22.620 --> 09:27.620
Hey, so you're applying for V-LUR here. I'm going to ask you these questions.

09:27.620 --> 09:30.620
Tell me about yourself, blah blah blah blah blah.

09:30.620 --> 09:35.620
And it was strongy. I was like...

09:35.620 --> 09:38.620
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.620
But actually I was pretty... I got my whole... I had questions ready.

09:42.620 --> 09:46.620
I was going in. As you know, I was an office bunny.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.620
I know what I'm getting into. What color is my underwear?

09:50.620 --> 09:55.620
It should be cotton moth. That just sounds like I'm a snake.

09:55.620 --> 09:59.620
Like I'm a... like I'm... I was some sort of... it's going to be a snake.

09:59.620 --> 10:04.620
Like, I'm a shibby cotton moth.

10:04.620 --> 10:08.620
Would you like to be wrapped up in my scales?

10:08.620 --> 10:10.620
Why do I sound like Rita Rapulza?

10:10.620 --> 10:14.620
Um...

10:14.620 --> 10:17.620
Lawmio for Gem 2. Lawmio for Gem 2.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.620
But I heard her voice.

10:21.620 --> 10:25.620
And I was like...

10:25.620 --> 10:29.620
Is that... is that strongy cuttles?

10:29.620 --> 10:33.620
Is that the strongy cuttles?

10:33.620 --> 10:35.620
Excuse me.

10:35.620 --> 10:38.620
The interview was great. She literally was just like, yeah, so you got it.

10:38.620 --> 10:43.620
I'm like, huh? You're joking. And she's like, yeah, that's it.

10:43.620 --> 10:46.620
Okay. Oh, she's like, here's the model.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.620
And I'm like, oh, okay.

10:49.620 --> 10:52.620
And I'm like, do you want to ask me anything?

10:52.620 --> 10:55.620
Like, I could just be... I could be a crazy person.

10:55.620 --> 10:58.620
Like, I could just... you're just gonna...

10:58.620 --> 11:01.620
And she's like, no, you're good.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.620
She's like, you're the person I wanted immediately.

11:05.620 --> 11:11.620
I was like, oh, that's actually like really,

11:11.620 --> 11:14.620
really freaking nice.

11:14.620 --> 11:17.620
It was really nice.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.620
She's been a creator I've looked up to for a very long time.

11:20.620 --> 11:23.620
And I know the other girls can say the same.

11:23.620 --> 11:30.620
And just to hear her be like, you were a first choice.

11:30.620 --> 11:34.620
I was impressed with your video. I was this, I was that.

11:34.620 --> 11:39.620
And I had applied to many companies before.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.620
Because I'm like, I'm never going to get in.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.620
I'm just going to do whatever.

11:43.620 --> 11:48.620
I applied to, I think, 10 different auditions.

11:48.620 --> 11:52.620
And I'm generally happy I failed each one.

11:52.620 --> 11:55.620
Because I wouldn't want this any other way.

11:55.620 --> 11:58.620
It was great.

11:58.620 --> 12:02.620
And me knows what I'm talking about.

12:02.620 --> 12:06.620
And meeting all the girls, I was like,

12:06.620 --> 12:09.620
everybody's so freaking talented.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.620
Like, Emmie's talented, Icey's talented,

12:11.620 --> 12:16.620
Azura's voice is pure fucking sex, dude.

12:16.620 --> 12:19.620
Sorry, I had a burp.

12:19.620 --> 12:20.620
Yeah, I'm trying.

12:20.620 --> 12:24.620
He's not the only freaking burp in this company.

12:24.620 --> 12:28.620
Let's see how long it takes for me to rip ass or something.

12:28.620 --> 12:31.620
Burp a corp.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.620
And I'll go right up to the mic.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.620
And I'll do it.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.620
It runs in the family.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.620
But yeah, I'm really glad to be one of the daughters.

12:41.620 --> 12:45.620
One of the whore daughters.

12:45.620 --> 12:48.620
Although it's kind of funny.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.620
People thought, oh bear, condition just kicked on.

12:50.620 --> 12:53.620
We're just like, we're just going to be whores.

12:53.620 --> 12:54.620
24-7.

12:54.620 --> 12:57.620
I'm going to be little in my doodaw right here, right now.

12:57.620 --> 13:01.620
No, like, I'm also a normal person.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.620
I'm also like, you can chat with me,

13:03.620 --> 13:05.620
and then, you know, you can go to Patreon,

13:05.620 --> 13:07.620
and that's great, you know?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.620
It's...

13:09.620 --> 13:10.620
Hey, yo, what's up?

13:10.620 --> 13:12.620
What, what's she saying?

13:12.620 --> 13:15.620
All right, hear me out.

13:15.620 --> 13:19.620
That'd be, you know,

13:19.620 --> 13:23.620
and like my hair already kind of has like that snake-like appearance.

13:23.620 --> 13:24.620
I don't know.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.620
I can hear the, yeah, it's, it's loud.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.620
It's like 80 degrees outside.

13:28.620 --> 13:29.620
Leave me alone.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.620
I kicked onto her debut.

13:31.620 --> 13:32.620
Whatever.

13:32.620 --> 13:33.620
I have my cat next to me.

13:33.620 --> 13:34.620
My handsome little man.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.620
He is sleeping in a bed.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.620
I'll have a cat cam eventually.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.620
So you guys can see my little boy.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.620
This is, I have Boomi next to me.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.620
Boomi King of Umashu,

13:44.620 --> 13:47.620
because I am a,

13:47.620 --> 13:51.620
I am a, I would call the last Airbender fan.

13:51.620 --> 13:54.620
And then, yeah, the cat name drop.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.620
The cat name drop.

13:56.620 --> 13:57.620
Hold on.

13:57.620 --> 13:58.620
I'm not actually, wait.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.620
I'm not, let me, let's just,

14:00.620 --> 14:02.620
I'm getting ahead of myself.

14:02.620 --> 14:03.620
Ow, I hit my knee again.

14:03.620 --> 14:04.620
It's because my legs are crossed.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
I'm trying to sit all seductively in my chair.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.620
It's not working out.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.620
Fuck you.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.620
Cat talks.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.620
Let's go to my lore.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.620
I'm going to pull myself up in the lore.

14:16.620 --> 14:21.620
So you can just break down scene by scene.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.620
Hello.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.620
Where am I?

14:25.620 --> 14:28.620
I need to manually play it.

14:28.620 --> 14:29.620
Hold on.

14:29.620 --> 14:33.620
Let me just, where am I?

14:33.620 --> 14:38.620
Who am I?

14:38.620 --> 14:41.620
You also will learn that I have fucking ADHD

14:41.620 --> 14:44.620
and I forget what I'm doing.

14:44.620 --> 14:48.620
I think it's, no.

14:48.620 --> 14:49.620
It's dark.

14:49.620 --> 14:50.620
Mommy, I can't see.

14:50.620 --> 14:51.620
Shut up.

14:51.620 --> 14:52.620
Shut up.

14:52.620 --> 14:53.620
Just take it.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.620
Just don't worry about it.

14:56.620 --> 14:57.620
Don't worry.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.620
Just bend over and take it.

14:59.620 --> 15:05.620
You don't have to question anything.

15:05.620 --> 15:09.620
Okay.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.620
F my annoying ass voice.

15:11.620 --> 15:16.620
I realize I go a lot deeper for when I record stuff.

15:16.620 --> 15:20.620
There it is.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.620
Whoopsies.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.620
Give me just a, there we go.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.620
When I'm nervous, I do lots of different voices.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.620
It's just me.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.620
What the fuck?

15:32.620 --> 15:39.620
You know, I will constantly slip into a Scottish accent

15:39.620 --> 15:41.620
because of Strani.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.620
I got bad Aqualalia where you just mimic voices.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.620
I usually mimic accents.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.620
You're going to get a lot of cat mo.

15:49.620 --> 15:50.620
I'm a fucking dork.

15:50.620 --> 15:51.620
I'm sorry.

15:51.620 --> 15:52.620
I'm sorry.

15:52.620 --> 15:53.620
I'm a dummy, mommy.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.620
I'll step on you.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.620
I'll step on you so far.

15:56.620 --> 15:59.620
I'm going to kick your fucking teeth in.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.620
Don't get me started.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.620
But I'm also a bit stupid.

16:04.620 --> 16:05.620
I'm a blonde.

16:05.620 --> 16:06.620
Don't forget that.

16:06.620 --> 16:07.620
Anyways, hold on.

16:07.620 --> 16:11.620
Let me just, okay.

16:11.620 --> 16:19.620
So, like I was saying, I'm going to keep bunny.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.620
It's like, hang in there.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.620
And I'm really depressed.

16:23.620 --> 16:30.620
You know, I really identified with this valley bunny girl.

16:30.620 --> 16:31.620
Oh my God.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.620
Why?

16:32.620 --> 16:34.620
You don't like this voice?

16:34.620 --> 16:36.620
What the fuck are you talking about?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.620
You're such a fucking little bitch.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.620
Am I allowed to swear this much?

16:40.620 --> 16:42.620
Am I going to get demonetized?

16:42.620 --> 16:45.620
Immediately, when I get monetization, probably.

16:45.620 --> 16:50.620
Because my titties are too fat and so is my ass.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.620
And I swear a lot.

16:52.620 --> 16:53.620
I'm sorry.

16:53.620 --> 16:58.620
Like, I'm going to bully you.

16:58.620 --> 17:01.620
Do you like sit by yourself at lunch?

17:01.620 --> 17:05.620
Don't you like have any friends?

17:05.620 --> 17:06.620
No?

17:06.620 --> 17:09.620
What a fucking loser.

17:09.620 --> 17:10.620
Wow.

17:11.620 --> 17:15.620
What the fuck?

17:15.620 --> 17:16.620
There's a dog barking out.

17:16.620 --> 17:19.620
I hate my apartment building.

17:19.620 --> 17:23.620
Yo, shut your fucking dog up.

17:23.620 --> 17:25.620
I'm about to scream out my balcony.

17:25.620 --> 17:28.620
Okay, anyways.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.620
Like I said, I have ADHD.

17:31.620 --> 17:33.620
A doctor said I got ADHD.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.620
I don't know what that means, but I got 80 of them.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.620
I need a drink.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.620
He got that dog and I'm a wolf.

17:42.620 --> 17:47.620
That's a spark.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.620
School bully ASMR.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.620
Hell yeah.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.620
Okay.

17:53.620 --> 17:54.620
3D.

17:54.620 --> 17:55.620
That's very sensitive.

17:55.620 --> 17:56.620
What do you mean?

17:56.620 --> 17:57.620
Am I talking to the...

17:57.620 --> 17:58.620
Wait, is my 3D a long?

17:58.620 --> 18:00.620
No, it's not.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.620
I record with AT2020.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.620
That's also why my mic is shit.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.620
You need a shirt and I'm like...

18:07.620 --> 18:10.620
I'm totally fine.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.620
It's good.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.620
So yeah, I identify with this a lot.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.620
Working in retail, slaving away.

18:18.620 --> 18:19.620
I finally...

18:19.620 --> 18:22.620
I need a noise gate.

18:22.620 --> 18:25.620
How about I fucking noise your gate, bro?

18:25.620 --> 18:27.620
Okay, hold on.

18:27.620 --> 18:31.620
I do have a noise gate, actually.

18:31.620 --> 18:35.620
Let's see.

18:35.620 --> 18:39.620
How about now?

18:39.620 --> 18:40.620
I also have a compressor.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.620
I don't fucking know.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.620
We'll figure that out later.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.620
I don't...

18:44.620 --> 18:45.620
I hate noise.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.620
I hate...

18:47.620 --> 18:49.620
I hate sounds.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.620
I suck with audio.

18:51.620 --> 18:55.620
They're like, oh, I hope the girls are like actually good with audio.

18:55.620 --> 18:58.620
No, I'm not one of them.

18:58.620 --> 19:02.620
I didn't do anything, but that's okay.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.620
Thank you.

19:05.620 --> 19:06.620
Mic settings are...

19:06.620 --> 19:08.620
Yeah, just like...

19:08.620 --> 19:09.620
Whatever.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.620
But yeah, retail sucks.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.620
I finally dropped to part time.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.620
I got a part time...

19:14.620 --> 19:17.620
I don't...

19:17.620 --> 19:18.620
Wait, where is my...

19:18.620 --> 19:21.620
I don't remember my fucking toggles.

19:21.620 --> 19:29.620
I had to apply for a part time position that I already had.

19:29.620 --> 19:34.620
I already was in the role as full time.

19:34.620 --> 19:43.620
And I had to apply and go through two interviews just to be considered for part time.

19:43.620 --> 19:46.620
Like, can you...

19:46.620 --> 19:51.620
Mind you, I've been at this company for like almost six years.

19:51.620 --> 19:54.620
It's not like they don't fucking know me.

19:54.620 --> 19:58.620
So now I have more time to stream.

19:58.620 --> 19:59.620
Thank God, that was my goal.

19:59.620 --> 20:00.620
I just want...

20:00.620 --> 20:03.620
I'm like, please, please, universe, just give me more time to stream.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.620
I just want to be a streamer.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.620
I just want to hang out with you guys.

20:06.620 --> 20:09.620
I just want to yop, yop, yop, yop, yop.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.620
Are you going to be a full time?

20:11.620 --> 20:12.620
That's the goal.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.620
That is the goal.

20:13.620 --> 20:16.620
If I can stream full time, that is the goal.

20:16.620 --> 20:26.620
Like, I just want to sit here and just talk to you and moan in your ear and like diddle you a bit and play some games.

20:26.620 --> 20:30.620
And you know, call you a piece of trash because you are trash.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.620
By the way, hope you don't forget that.

20:32.620 --> 20:38.620
Just because I'm a little like, I'm a little, oh, I'm, I'm whatever.

20:38.620 --> 20:45.620
That doesn't mean just because I have zoom or energy sometimes doesn't mean I won't be a fucking bitch.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.620
You'll do what to me.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.620
Don't worry about it.

20:49.620 --> 20:50.620
Just close your eyes.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.620
Just take it.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.620
Anyways, so I've identified with this a lot.

20:53.620 --> 20:59.620
I showed my mom parts of my lore video and my mom also identifies with this a lot.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.620
Speaking of my mom, I love my parents.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.620
My parents are very supportive of me that yes, they know I do loot audio.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.620
Don't be like, can your parents look at you in the face?

21:11.620 --> 21:12.620
Yeah.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.620
My mom's like, get me on.

21:14.620 --> 21:15.620
My dad's like, get me on.

21:15.620 --> 21:16.620
Get us on stream.

21:16.620 --> 21:17.620
Get us in recording.

21:17.620 --> 21:18.620
Let's do some stuff.

21:18.620 --> 21:19.620
I'm like, all right.

21:19.620 --> 21:20.620
All right.

21:22.620 --> 21:23.620
Is your mom sink?

21:23.620 --> 21:24.620
No.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.620
My mom is not single.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.620
She is happily married to my father.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.620
Get the fuck out.

21:33.620 --> 21:34.620
Yeah.

21:34.620 --> 21:38.620
My mom says she's going to hijack my channel so she can become a Vtuber.

21:38.620 --> 21:40.620
Pull a Brea cookie boxes.

21:40.620 --> 21:44.620
Mom, our cookie box and make a gardening channel.

21:44.620 --> 21:48.620
She said, is your dad sick?

21:50.620 --> 21:51.620
No.

21:51.620 --> 21:52.620
My dad is a Chad though.

21:52.620 --> 21:55.620
My dad and Strani's dad are so much alike.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.620
My dad was just like, hey, are you going to be?

21:58.620 --> 21:59.620
Okay.

21:59.620 --> 22:00.620
You know what?

22:00.620 --> 22:02.620
Let me just fuck this noise.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.620
I'm just going to be fully in the frame because I can't stop talking.

22:07.620 --> 22:18.620
My dad was like, I was like, dad, I got accepted for the Vtuber thing that I applied for.

22:18.620 --> 22:20.620
And he's like, whoa.

22:20.620 --> 22:24.620
So you're really a hentai waifu Vtuber?

22:24.620 --> 22:29.620
And I'm like, yes.

22:31.620 --> 22:32.620
And he's like, sick.

22:32.620 --> 22:37.620
Don't tell me anything about it, but I'm proud of you.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.620
Yes, my dad knows what hentai is.

22:39.620 --> 22:45.620
And we had to thoroughly explain to my mother what it was with pictures.

22:45.620 --> 22:47.620
It was quite funny.

22:47.620 --> 22:57.620
My very religious conservative mother blushing profusely as we show her a clip from Bible Black.

23:04.620 --> 23:05.620
Anyways.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.620
Oh no, my parents are cool religious.

23:09.620 --> 23:14.620
If when I was like super young to be like, wait, she's religious, how does this work?

23:14.620 --> 23:15.620
I'm not religious.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.620
Fuck that.

23:17.620 --> 23:18.620
Respect though.

23:18.620 --> 23:23.620
If you, you know, worship our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then you know, all for you.

23:23.620 --> 23:28.620
I'm just not a part of it, but my parents are very devout Christians.

23:28.620 --> 23:31.620
But as I got older and I was just, you know, I wasn't feeling that.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.620
They're just like, you know what, you do you boo.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.620
And I think my parents for that.

23:35.620 --> 23:38.620
My parents are based as hell.

23:38.620 --> 23:39.620
You don't even know.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.620
I'll tell more stories.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.620
Moving on.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.620
See if I can jerk my titties around.

23:51.620 --> 23:54.620
Watching this is church parking lot right now.

23:54.620 --> 23:55.620
Don't ask.

23:56.620 --> 23:59.620
My dad's going to be so mad that I'm putting him on blast.

23:59.620 --> 24:05.620
He's like, wait, you told her stream that that we we showed your mom had.

24:05.620 --> 24:06.620
Why would you do that?

24:06.620 --> 24:09.620
I don't know why my dad's southern, but in whatever.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.620
But yeah, moving on.

24:13.620 --> 24:18.620
I also didn't fight with this because this happened to me multiple times.

24:18.620 --> 24:21.620
Remember when I said I worked there for like six years?

24:21.620 --> 24:23.620
I still work there because I need insurance.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.620
Yeah, I was passed up on a lot.

24:30.620 --> 24:31.620
And I didn't even come up with the lore.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.620
They just threw this at me and they're like, read the script.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.620
And I was like, why the fuck is this me though?

24:35.620 --> 24:36.620
This is me.

24:36.620 --> 24:37.620
This is real.

24:37.620 --> 24:41.620
But yeah, there's they're like, no, we don't we don't believe in nepotism.

24:41.620 --> 24:43.620
What are you talking about?

24:43.620 --> 24:51.620
And I'm like, you just gave this girl who just came in because she never mind.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.620
She just gave this girl a job that I clearly deserve.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.620
I've been there for three years and you just can't get to a girl.

24:58.620 --> 24:59.620
It's been there for six months.

24:59.620 --> 25:00.620
Let's fight.

25:01.620 --> 25:06.620
Oh, my bosses don't see this because they know I stream too.

25:13.620 --> 25:18.620
Somebody pointed out in Strani stream, they're like, oh, it's queen.

25:18.620 --> 25:23.620
It queen was my my my pre-concept art and stop telling people you stream.

25:25.620 --> 25:29.620
I tell all people I stream and people just find me.

25:30.620 --> 25:39.620
I had one of my co-workers come up to me and be like, hey, I saw are you doing this like playing this game?

25:41.620 --> 25:42.620
Was that was that you?

25:42.620 --> 25:46.620
And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

25:46.620 --> 25:47.620
It wasn't me.

25:51.620 --> 25:57.620
But yeah, queen, she's queen, rest in peace.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.620
I kind of want an alternative outfit.

25:59.620 --> 26:02.620
That's similar to her outfit, just like fur.

26:02.620 --> 26:06.620
And then somebody also pointed out, I'll use the loli voice when you should.

26:06.620 --> 26:09.620
The funny thing is, is that I did and they still know it was me.

26:12.620 --> 26:13.620
I do.

26:13.620 --> 26:19.620
Yeah, you guys know I do a lot of different voices and yes, I will continue to do so.

26:20.620 --> 26:28.620
Someone said this looked like Contel VA and I'm like, oh shit, I didn't even get that until now.

26:29.620 --> 26:34.620
In my debut, I glanced at chat real quick and someone's like, is that Contel VA?

26:35.620 --> 26:40.620
And I'm like, hey, oh, it wasn't, it wasn't my intention.

26:40.620 --> 26:45.620
Well, I might not even make this concept art and I didn't do the lore, but it wasn't the intention.

26:45.620 --> 26:46.620
I can assure you that.

26:46.620 --> 26:49.620
But it's funny that it happened.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.620
It wasn't planned.

26:51.620 --> 26:52.620
But a shout out to her.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.620
She makes amazing audios.

26:55.620 --> 26:57.620
Jorked off to one of them the other day.

26:57.620 --> 26:58.620
Anyways.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.620
Oh, damn.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.620
Hold on.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.620
Let me move my.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.620
I got some tickle bitties.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.620
I'll probably need to cover up because.

27:13.620 --> 27:17.620
Because yeah, I'm probably going to get an outfit similar to the one I'm wearing in this.

27:18.620 --> 27:25.620
Picture just because my bazonga hungers are bazonga hunging.

27:30.620 --> 27:34.620
Oh my God, kids are running down the hallway screaming in my apartment building.

27:37.620 --> 27:45.620
If I can just move out into the countryside with my three cats, get some dogs, some horses, some horses.

27:46.620 --> 27:50.620
Some goats and just live on a farm.

27:50.620 --> 27:51.620
No animals.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.620
That's not everyone.

27:52.620 --> 27:59.620
So every time you buy my merch and you, yeah, I got merch too, bitch.

27:59.620 --> 28:03.620
You buy my merch and you support my Patreon.

28:03.620 --> 28:07.620
You're helping me get one step closer to my tree.

28:09.620 --> 28:12.620
Yeah, when I saw this, I'm like, this isn't going to be allowed.

28:13.620 --> 28:17.620
I'm like, this isn't with this fucking.

28:20.620 --> 28:21.620
Hold on.

28:21.620 --> 28:22.620
Hold on.

28:24.620 --> 28:31.620
Can someone like take a screenshot and like have me pointing like backwards like, oh fuck.

28:31.620 --> 28:32.620
Excuse me.

28:32.620 --> 28:33.620
Excuse me.

28:35.620 --> 28:41.620
One step closer to Ram Ranch, 18 naked cowboys in the showers at Ram Ranch.

28:46.620 --> 28:47.620
She did what?

28:47.620 --> 28:48.620
Where?

28:50.620 --> 28:51.620
Excuse me.

28:51.620 --> 28:52.620
Seven out of 10 burp.

28:52.620 --> 28:53.620
Fuck your mother.

28:53.620 --> 28:54.620
What?

28:54.620 --> 28:57.620
I burp like a fucking God, bro.

28:58.620 --> 29:01.620
Anyways, I don't know why I keep calling you guys bro.

29:01.620 --> 29:02.620
I need to start.

29:02.620 --> 29:03.620
I used to call you trash.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.620
I'm a fucking God trash.

29:05.620 --> 29:09.620
What's a nice one syllable word?

29:11.620 --> 29:12.620
You fucking sluts.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.620
Oh, here's my neighbors.

29:17.620 --> 29:19.620
Yapping their asses off.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.620
I don't know if you can hear that on the background.

29:21.620 --> 29:25.620
Anyways, they probably can hear me and I'm just like, ah ha ha, gips.

29:27.620 --> 29:28.620
This is hot.

29:29.620 --> 29:30.620
This is hot, but yeah.

29:32.620 --> 29:33.620
He.

29:34.620 --> 29:35.620
Can you speak while burping?

29:35.620 --> 29:36.620
No.

29:37.620 --> 29:38.620
Hi honey neighbors.

29:39.620 --> 29:40.620
I love this.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.620
This is like my favorite scene.

29:44.620 --> 29:49.620
Because I just look so cute with my little hair up and with a glass of wine.

29:51.620 --> 29:52.620
Hold on.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.620
I'm going to do a hi honey.

29:57.620 --> 29:58.620
It's a little nod.

29:59.620 --> 30:00.620
Take a sip.

30:02.620 --> 30:03.620
Perfect.

30:03.620 --> 30:07.620
And then my queens in the background, like hot infinity pool.

30:07.620 --> 30:12.620
You know what would have been funny if they had Azura just flying.

30:12.620 --> 30:16.620
You know how in her lore video she just flies over?

30:16.620 --> 30:18.620
Do you do voice training?

30:18.620 --> 30:19.620
Do you know?

30:19.620 --> 30:20.620
I'm just like that.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.620
I give credit.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.620
My dad will probably say this.

30:25.620 --> 30:29.620
I give credit to my father for giving me a wide voice range.

30:29.620 --> 30:35.620
Because my dad's voice is super deep, but he can go super fucking high like me.

30:35.620 --> 30:41.620
And so sometimes they're like, I would, for example, let's say I do something and I fuck up.

30:42.620 --> 30:43.620
And I don't know.

30:43.620 --> 30:47.620
I stubbed my toe, you know, like that one snot nose kid from the Simpsons.

30:47.620 --> 30:49.620
They go ha ha ha.

30:49.620 --> 30:52.620
My dad does that perfectly.

30:53.620 --> 30:56.620
And so we would just be like ha ha ha.

30:56.620 --> 30:57.620
And then they would talk higher.

30:57.620 --> 31:07.620
And you can also do the, um, the fucking, uh, the PDF file from, um, South Park voice.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.620
Hey there little boy.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.620
I can't do it.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.620
My dad, my dad is a good voice actor.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.620
He should, he should honestly voice in games.

31:16.620 --> 31:21.620
And my mom just sounds like can really do a really good Muppet impression.

31:21.620 --> 31:24.620
She'll try to be British and she just sounds like a Muppet.

31:24.620 --> 31:30.620
Um, family guy, whatever, whatever, bro.

31:30.620 --> 31:32.620
I mean, slut.

31:32.620 --> 31:38.620
I mean, you guys need a name when getting dad.

31:38.620 --> 31:40.620
Can you do a Russian voice?

31:40.620 --> 31:44.620
One of my, hold on.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.620
I need to think of IC.

31:46.620 --> 31:49.620
And one of my best friends is also, she's Russian too.

31:49.620 --> 31:53.620
Shout out to, shout out to my girl.

31:53.620 --> 31:57.620
Um, everybody's Russian, the Finnish.

31:57.620 --> 32:05.620
No, I can't, I can't do it right now because then I'm going to slip into, I always end up slipping into a British accent.

32:05.620 --> 32:11.620
And then sometimes when I'm listening to Strony, I'll just slip into her, her Scottish accent and she's been teaching me Scots.

32:12.620 --> 32:18.620
But I also just sound like I'm from Northern, cause I can't roll my, my Rs that well.

32:18.620 --> 32:25.620
Sound like I'm from Northern Britain or UK or whatever.

32:25.620 --> 32:29.620
What about calling a slit? No.

32:29.620 --> 32:33.620
I'm not going to be like, hey slave on YouTube.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.620
What's up you guys?

32:35.620 --> 32:36.620
We're talking to this.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.620
What's up you slave?

32:38.620 --> 32:43.620
Are you trying to get me canceled?

32:43.620 --> 32:47.620
Are you trying to get me canceled?

32:47.620 --> 32:48.620
Do not clip this out of context.

32:48.620 --> 32:50.620
I will come for you.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.620
Not like that.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.620
I will come for you.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.620
I'm coming for you.

32:55.620 --> 32:57.620
Coming for your family.

32:57.620 --> 33:02.620
I'm coming for your, your, your career.

33:02.620 --> 33:05.620
I'm coming on your lap.

33:05.620 --> 33:06.620
All right.

33:06.620 --> 33:07.620
All right.

33:07.620 --> 33:08.620
Stop it.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.620
Stop it.

33:09.620 --> 33:10.620
Stop it.

33:10.620 --> 33:11.620
Ah, Shibi, what are you doing?

33:11.620 --> 33:12.620
What are you doing?

33:12.620 --> 33:13.620
Shibi.

33:13.620 --> 33:22.620
Ah, anyways, at least take me out to dinner first.

33:22.620 --> 33:25.620
Nah, we're going straight to third base.

33:25.620 --> 33:26.620
You know what that is?

33:26.620 --> 33:28.620
Holding hands.

33:31.620 --> 33:32.620
How about calling you Scum?

33:32.620 --> 33:34.620
Oh, I like Scum.

33:34.620 --> 33:39.620
I love her absolutely scatterbrained Tommy.

33:39.620 --> 33:40.620
That's me.

33:40.620 --> 33:43.620
And I'm getting too lewd.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.620
I'm getting too lewd.

33:44.620 --> 33:52.620
And it's like, I've always been like not say so, but I usually, it's usually just in

33:52.620 --> 33:58.620
the frame of what's it called, just swearing and cursing.

33:58.620 --> 34:03.620
But now I can just make really stupid, perfected jokes just because I can.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.620
Oh, okay.

34:07.620 --> 34:09.620
And holding is insane.

34:09.620 --> 34:11.620
I know.

34:11.620 --> 34:13.620
Hey, look, it's me.

34:13.620 --> 34:18.620
So yeah, people are like, Shibi, Shibi, hold on.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.620
Where's the, where's the dumb?

34:20.620 --> 34:25.620
Oh, where's the dumb face?

34:25.620 --> 34:27.620
There we go.

34:27.620 --> 34:31.620
This is what, this is how I picture you guys.

34:31.620 --> 34:35.620
Oh, Shibi, when you wear Shiba, he rubs.

34:35.620 --> 34:41.620
If you're not, like, domesticated.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.620
Because I don't fucking know.

34:49.620 --> 34:55.620
And obviously I kind of thought my Laura would explain it like it's just my get up.

34:55.620 --> 35:00.620
I just wear it and you know, you can be a dumb and like pain.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.620
Right?

35:01.620 --> 35:09.620
Like, you know, you're allowed to also enjoy things.

35:09.620 --> 35:15.620
Like, I just, you know, like, you want to know how much of a dumb I am.

35:15.620 --> 35:17.620
Let me tell you a secret.

35:17.620 --> 35:18.620
Let me tell you.

35:18.620 --> 35:25.620
Oh, by the way, this is the voice that I mostly use for my, my naughty audios.

35:26.620 --> 35:31.620
So, so 100% a switch.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.620
Shut the fuck up.

35:33.620 --> 35:34.620
Shut the fuck.

35:34.620 --> 35:38.620
No, let's not be guys, guys.

35:38.620 --> 35:42.620
Okay, I'll educate you after this because Jesus Christ.

35:42.620 --> 35:44.620
I can maintain it.

35:44.620 --> 35:50.620
By the way, but what the fuck was I saying?

35:56.620 --> 35:59.620
Where am I?

35:59.620 --> 36:02.620
Because someone remind me what the hell I was saying.

36:02.620 --> 36:06.620
Again, I have, I have, I have short term memory.

36:06.620 --> 36:09.620
Audio's voice talking about being a dumb.

36:09.620 --> 36:12.620
Dom's going to enjoy things with no clue.

36:12.620 --> 36:15.620
Yeah, you're just, you're just like odd titties.

36:15.620 --> 36:19.620
Madam.

36:19.620 --> 36:24.620
Guys, I'm, I'm, I'm elderly.

36:24.620 --> 36:30.620
You see, so I lose track of things quite quickly.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.620
You thought I was a hag.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.620
I'm ancient.

36:34.620 --> 36:42.620
Um, but, and then if this filters you, but it's okay, but I don't really care.

36:42.620 --> 36:46.620
Um, but Dom's like you could, they can enjoy paid.

36:46.620 --> 36:47.620
Oh, I remember those.

36:47.620 --> 36:50.620
I was going to make a joke.

36:50.620 --> 36:53.620
Um, I'm such a dumb.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.620
I'm such a, I'm such a masochist.

36:56.620 --> 36:59.620
Don't you thought shut the fuck up.

36:59.620 --> 37:02.620
You piece of shit about stupid toilet.

37:02.620 --> 37:08.620
Um, I'm such a masochist that I'll sleep with a scrunchie on my wrist.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.620
So it leaves a mark.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.620
Putting dumb.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.620
Okay, you got me there.

37:20.620 --> 37:21.620
You got me there.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.620
I'm like fucking sweating.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.620
I got like titty sweat right now under my boobies.

37:25.620 --> 37:29.620
Um, uh, insider note.

37:29.620 --> 37:31.620
Uh, I have the same exact body top.

37:31.620 --> 37:34.620
I have the same exact body type as she be.

37:34.620 --> 37:38.620
So my boobs are actually as big as hers and it is a hassle.

37:38.620 --> 37:39.620
Let me tell you.

37:39.620 --> 37:40.620
Oh, hold on.

37:40.620 --> 37:41.620
I'm asleep.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.620
Wake the fuck up.

37:43.620 --> 37:45.620
Wake the fuck up.

37:45.620 --> 37:51.620
Oh, my parents don't walk in right now.

37:52.620 --> 37:55.620
Oh, I love scuff.

37:55.620 --> 38:02.620
Um, anyways, I'm just going to like jiggle myself around to talk official boob chart.

38:02.620 --> 38:03.620
I don't know.

38:03.620 --> 38:04.620
I think that'll be like a donut on goal.

38:04.620 --> 38:14.620
I think, um, mome was saying, can we just talk about how annoying vtube studio.

38:14.620 --> 38:18.620
I don't know if you're a vtuber watching this or if you're not a vtuber watching this.

38:18.620 --> 38:19.620
Oh, my God.

38:19.620 --> 38:22.620
It's so easy just to be a vtuber.

38:22.620 --> 38:23.620
It's not.

38:23.620 --> 38:24.620
There's so much annoying.

38:24.620 --> 38:28.620
It took me three hours to set up a fucking chat with you today.

38:28.620 --> 38:29.620
Okay.

38:29.620 --> 38:34.620
We need baby keys on screen to help she be constant.

38:34.620 --> 38:37.620
Shut up vtube studio breaks.

38:37.620 --> 38:38.620
Exactly.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.620
Thank you, Emmy.

38:39.620 --> 38:40.620
Thank you.

38:40.620 --> 38:43.620
Technical difficulties, you know, their png.

38:43.620 --> 38:47.620
Um, so there was a point when we were doing like, I think I'm starting to mention this.

38:47.620 --> 39:00.620
We did like a couple of mock streams before we did a real stream and my model just wasn't working because my the cable I think I was using just wasn't behaving.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.620
Oh, I'm a soup in my mouth.

39:02.620 --> 39:05.620
Um, hold on.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.620
You like that?

39:08.620 --> 39:18.620
Um, so I just had a png of my model and I was just like, and I was just talking over it and the girls were losing their minds.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.620
Get some subway servers up there.

39:20.620 --> 39:21.620
You know what?

39:21.620 --> 39:22.620
You might tempt me.

39:22.620 --> 39:28.620
Um, it's been 30 minutes and I've just talked about lore.

39:28.620 --> 39:32.620
I haven't even talked about the like, I haven't even anyways.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.620
Yes, this is my boss.

39:35.620 --> 39:36.620
It's not my real boss.

39:36.620 --> 39:39.620
Um, it's Johnny.

39:39.620 --> 39:40.620
No, she's not my boss.

39:40.620 --> 39:41.620
She's not.

39:41.620 --> 39:43.620
She's my co-worker.

39:43.620 --> 39:46.620
This is the entirety of my management and editing team.

39:46.620 --> 39:52.620
Um, but yes, if you caught on, yes, it's it's my boss from the beginning, which is pretty.

39:52.620 --> 39:56.620
I thought that was pretty pretty shaky if you ask me in it.

39:58.620 --> 40:00.620
Hey, your skip ahead.

40:04.620 --> 40:10.620
Let's talk about this queen.

40:10.620 --> 40:13.620
God rest her soul.

40:15.620 --> 40:23.620
When I tell you when they handed this to me when management's like, oh, here's the sketch.

40:23.620 --> 40:30.620
I'm like, you're telling me that this woman's dying from this some disease.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.620
And there's just a guy.

40:33.620 --> 40:36.620
There's a guy with a gypsy in the hospital.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.620
A gypsy in the corner.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.620
It looks like an SCP.

40:41.620 --> 40:43.620
Yeah, SCP 69.

40:46.620 --> 40:49.620
Someone also did a cheeky edit of this with something.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.620
So that was funny.

40:51.620 --> 40:54.620
Um, but I, uh, this was funny as hell.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.620
That was so funny.

41:01.620 --> 41:04.620
Uh, this last scene makes me feel so badass.

41:04.620 --> 41:08.620
Like this last take I did with my voice and the way the beat goes.

41:08.620 --> 41:13.620
I was like, oh, I'm feeling like a motherfucker.

41:13.620 --> 41:20.620
I am feeling like the baddest bitch that ever bitched the bad before.

41:22.620 --> 41:24.620
One of the gim stairs.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.620
Um, but yeah, let me get out of the way.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.620
Oh, step on me.

41:30.620 --> 41:31.620
Oh, step on me.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.620
She be step on me.

41:33.620 --> 41:34.620

41:45.620 --> 41:47.620

41:47.620 --> 41:50.620
That's officially the voice that you guys have now.

41:50.620 --> 41:53.620
My little, I'm a little boy slut.

41:53.620 --> 41:54.620
That's me.

41:55.620 --> 42:00.620

I have a deep voice.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.620
Yeah, this is what it sounds like.

42:07.620 --> 42:08.620

42:22.620 --> 42:25.620
You sound like you're a wimp in a pussy.

42:26.620 --> 42:27.620
Okay.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.620
I'm losing my voice because I'm screaming.

42:32.620 --> 42:33.620
Base pro shop.

42:33.620 --> 42:34.620
Anyways.

42:38.620 --> 42:39.620
Wake me up.

42:39.620 --> 42:41.620
Wake me up inside.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.620
Uh, hold on a moment.

42:46.620 --> 42:47.620
What the fuck?

42:47.620 --> 42:48.620
Yeah.

42:52.620 --> 42:54.620
I came up with the memes.

42:54.620 --> 42:56.620
I was like, throw my titties on Changus.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.620
Throw me on this.

42:59.620 --> 43:00.620
Hold on.

43:00.620 --> 43:01.620
Can I make this bigger?

43:08.620 --> 43:09.620
Okay.

43:09.620 --> 43:11.620
It's me as a bunny.

43:11.620 --> 43:12.620
And that's you guys.

43:13.620 --> 43:15.620
Can't live with energy.

43:15.620 --> 43:19.620
Sometimes they're like, I know people are like,

43:19.620 --> 43:25.620
I can't wait for her to be like a dummy mommy and just order me around and be really cold.

43:25.620 --> 43:30.620
And, you know, what is that called when you're,

43:30.620 --> 43:33.620
what type of dairy is it called when you just have no emotions?

43:33.620 --> 43:34.620

48:24.620 --> 48:26.620
Yes, you do have to pay taxes.

48:26.620 --> 48:33.620
We are beating the e-girl and e-boy allegations of not paying our taxes.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.620
I sound like a weird bun because you are one.

48:37.620 --> 48:39.620
Is this slander or bullying?

48:39.620 --> 48:41.620
Why not both, you know?

48:44.620 --> 48:45.620
My likes.

That can't be real.

54:23.620 --> 54:24.620
But yeah, I read.

54:24.620 --> 54:25.620
I read a lot.

54:26.620 --> 54:27.620
I was.

54:27.620 --> 54:29.620
I mentioned it and not called the girls in the day.

54:29.620 --> 54:32.620
I read Watership Down when I was in like fifth grade.

54:32.620 --> 54:34.620
Right Battle Royale right after that.

54:34.620 --> 54:37.620
The original Battle Royale name of the wind.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.620
Yes, I love name of the wind.

54:40.620 --> 54:42.620
Fuck Patrick Roth is for real.

54:43.620 --> 54:45.620
I want to go to that dude's house.

54:45.620 --> 54:48.620
Seal his manuscript for the Doors of Stone.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.620
Punch him in the dick and publish it.

54:52.620 --> 54:54.620
He's literally just sitting on his ass.

54:54.620 --> 54:56.620
Pulling a George R. Martin.

54:58.620 --> 54:59.620
And I do.

55:00.620 --> 55:01.620
Why?

55:01.620 --> 55:03.620
Just release the third book.

55:03.620 --> 55:04.620
His dark materials.

55:04.620 --> 55:05.620
Yes, good.

55:05.620 --> 55:06.620
Dragonlands.

55:06.620 --> 55:07.620
I have not.

55:09.620 --> 55:13.620
I a lot of my friends read the Wheel of Time.

55:13.620 --> 55:14.620
I'm only on the second book.

55:14.620 --> 55:16.620
So they're a little bit ahead on me.

55:16.620 --> 55:17.620
One of my my girlfriends.

55:19.620 --> 55:21.620
I need to come up with a code name for her.

55:21.620 --> 55:22.620
Because I'm going to call her by her real name.

55:22.620 --> 55:24.620
I'm going to call her.

55:26.620 --> 55:27.620
Salem.

55:27.620 --> 55:28.620
Because she's witch like.

55:28.620 --> 55:29.620
Salem.

55:30.620 --> 55:34.620
She said because she's very supportive of my VTubing.

55:34.620 --> 55:37.620
She's the only person that knows outside my parents.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.620
And she's like, please get me on your stream.

55:41.620 --> 55:46.620
And we can do like some sort of podcast where we talk about really smutty books.

55:46.620 --> 55:48.620
Like a court of thorn and roses.

55:48.620 --> 55:49.620
Or credence.

55:49.620 --> 55:50.620
Oh, credence.

55:52.620 --> 55:54.620
Hey, if you guys like Emmy.

55:56.620 --> 55:57.620
You should read credence.

55:59.620 --> 56:01.620
But yeah, what the fuck her name is.

56:01.620 --> 56:02.620
Colleen Hoover.

56:02.620 --> 56:03.620
I forget.

56:04.620 --> 56:05.620
Sort of truth.

56:05.620 --> 56:06.620
Actually, I have.

56:08.620 --> 56:09.620
I know he said sort of truth.

56:09.620 --> 56:10.620
But I have.

56:10.620 --> 56:14.620
I literally have like the Witcher books on my.

56:14.620 --> 56:15.620
I'm looking to the side right now.

56:15.620 --> 56:16.620
The Witcher.

56:16.620 --> 56:17.620
Books on my bookshelf.

56:17.620 --> 56:20.620
I have Joe Abercombe the blade itself.

56:20.620 --> 56:21.620
My favorite.

56:23.620 --> 56:25.620
Series that I've read.

56:25.620 --> 56:26.620
Or.

56:26.620 --> 56:28.620
Well, my favorite like book series of all time.

56:28.620 --> 56:32.620
Or actually no TV show series and kind of book series has to be.

56:33.620 --> 56:34.620
The magicians.

56:34.620 --> 56:37.620
The book series obviously blows the fucking show out of the water.

56:37.620 --> 56:38.620
But I like the show too.

56:40.620 --> 56:42.620
I also really like Brandon Sanderson.

56:42.620 --> 56:43.620
What's.

56:43.620 --> 56:45.620
What's the other dude's name that wrote.

56:46.620 --> 56:47.620
Hold on.

56:47.620 --> 56:48.620
Let me move over to my.

56:50.620 --> 56:51.620
Where did the book go?

56:53.620 --> 56:55.620
Oh, it's going to bother the crap out of me if I don't know the name.

56:55.620 --> 56:56.620
Hold on.

56:59.620 --> 57:02.620
Red sister by Mark Lawrence.

57:02.620 --> 57:03.620
I love Mark Lawrence.

57:04.620 --> 57:06.620
And let me see.

57:07.620 --> 57:08.620
Why is it a lot?

57:08.620 --> 57:13.620
And mind you, my dad recommends every book that I've read because of my dad's a huge reader.

57:13.620 --> 57:14.620
Scott Lynch.

57:14.620 --> 57:18.620
Scott Lynch needs to also release more books because he's a great writer.

57:19.620 --> 57:20.620
How about Jordan?

57:20.620 --> 57:21.620
Yes.

57:21.620 --> 57:22.620
Just read the blade itself.

57:22.620 --> 57:23.620
What did you think?

57:23.620 --> 57:24.620
Yeah.

57:24.620 --> 57:27.620
Brandon said, I still have to read the last book in the Stormlight archive.

57:27.620 --> 57:28.620
I know that came out like last year.

57:28.620 --> 57:31.620
I want to get the nice, nice, really fancy hard, hard cover.

57:32.620 --> 57:33.620
Cooking.

57:33.620 --> 57:34.620
Cooking.

57:34.620 --> 57:35.620
Cooking.

57:35.620 --> 57:36.620
Cooking.

57:36.620 --> 57:37.620
Cooking.

57:37.620 --> 57:38.620
Cooking.

57:38.620 --> 57:39.620
I love to cook.

57:39.620 --> 57:42.620
You might see on my all, I've actually posted pictures of stuff that I've cooked.

57:42.620 --> 57:44.620
I definitely want to do some cooking streams.

57:44.620 --> 57:46.620
I don't know how I'm going to manage that.

57:47.620 --> 57:53.620
Because I like, I don't know how people do cooking streams as a VTuber, but we'll try.

57:54.620 --> 57:56.620
I know a lot of random internet shit.

57:57.620 --> 58:01.620
Like, well, did you know that?

58:04.620 --> 58:05.620
Excuse me.

58:06.620 --> 58:11.620
That humans are covered in stripes.

58:11.620 --> 58:15.620
We just can't see them, but our pets, like our cats can see them.

58:15.620 --> 58:21.620
I forget what the stripes are actually called, but it's on a different, I think it's like UV rays or something.

58:22.620 --> 58:23.620
Ranger.

58:23.620 --> 58:24.620
Yeah.

58:24.620 --> 58:25.620
Oh yes.

58:25.620 --> 58:26.620
I wanted to read Rangers apprentice.

58:26.620 --> 58:28.620
That's definitely on my list.

58:29.620 --> 58:30.620
Just take bow or scooch.

58:30.620 --> 58:31.620
Yeah.

58:31.620 --> 58:32.620
Yeah.

58:32.620 --> 58:35.620
Or I'm really, I'm blanking on names right now.

58:35.620 --> 58:39.620
But that other big, I literally watch her.

58:39.620 --> 58:40.620
I don't know why I'm playing your name.

58:40.620 --> 58:41.620
Who also does a lot of cooking streams.

58:42.620 --> 58:43.620
Jujitsu.

58:43.620 --> 58:49.620
I got into Jujitsu because Onigiri.

58:49.620 --> 58:50.620
Thank you.

58:50.620 --> 58:51.620
Thank you.

58:51.620 --> 58:52.620
Thank you.

58:52.620 --> 58:53.620
Onigiri.

58:53.620 --> 58:54.620
Yes.

58:54.620 --> 58:55.620
Onigiri.

58:55.620 --> 58:57.620
I'm like, I was thinking of another Japanese food.

58:58.620 --> 59:00.620
I was like, no, not Konigiri.

59:00.620 --> 59:02.620
What's the right one?

59:03.620 --> 59:04.620
Got Connie on the brain.

59:04.620 --> 59:05.620
Whoopsies.

59:08.620 --> 59:16.620
When I was younger, someone broke into my house when I was 13 and I was home alone.

59:17.620 --> 59:28.620
And I decided to run after the guy.

59:28.620 --> 59:32.620
There was a grown ass man in my house and I chased him out.

59:35.620 --> 59:36.620
And then I called the police.

59:37.620 --> 59:43.620
And then my dad tried hunting for him for a very, very long time.

59:45.620 --> 59:48.620
But afterwards my parents put me in Jujitsu classes.

59:48.620 --> 59:50.620
And so I'm all, don't get it twisted.

59:50.620 --> 59:53.620
I'm only a white belt, but it doesn't mean I won't put you in the grounds.

59:54.620 --> 59:55.620
I know submissions.

59:56.620 --> 59:57.620
I'm very strong.

59:57.620 --> 59:58.620
I've taken it.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:03.620
And my school that I attended was co-ed.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:08.620
So I sparred with guys like twice my size and I still put their asses to sleep.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.620
Do not get it twisted.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:15.620
I will gladly knock you out.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.620
And I like to watch UFC too.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.620
I'm pretty gory like that.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.620
My mom's teaching me about gardening.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.620
I love listening to my mom talk about gardening.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.620
So I think I want to get into gardening more.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:35.620
And then obviously voice acting.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.620
Wow.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.620
I wouldn't have given that away.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.620
I'm only on my second fucking slide.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620
Yeah, we already talked about this.

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.620
Dollhouse.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:47.620
I love Dollhouse.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.620
Great show.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.620
Dungeon Mesh is good.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.620
I love Robotech.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.620
I literally have the OG discs on my entertainment center right now.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.620
Princess Bride is my all-time favorite movie.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620
Hands down.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:02.620
I can quote that movie word for word.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:13.620
And I think it started a trend into the type of men I'm into because I really liked Wesley and I really liked Howl.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:17.620
And they look very similar in hindsight.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:23.620
And it's funny, my mom almost named me Wesley if I was a boy after him.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.620
You've never seen the Princess Bride?

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:28.620
I've seen it like 10 times.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.620
Also Lady Hawk is good.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.620
I should put Lady Hawk on here.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.620
Haunting a Hill House.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.620
Bom.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.620
Bom.

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.620
My name is Enugamentoya.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.620
You killed my father.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.620
Prepare to die.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.620
Inconceivable.

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.620
Two times watch it more.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.620
Against your will.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.620
It's a great movie.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.620
What are you talking about?

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.620
Yeah, I like that is my comfort.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.620
If I'm really upset, I'm watching the Princess Bride.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.620
I just binge watched a show called Harlots.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.620
It's about brothel madams in Victorian England.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:12.620
I like a lot of period films and shows like Tudors.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:19.620
I know Game of Thrones isn't a period, but I like older settings, but also sci-fi.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.620
Like I said, the magicians, although it's more like fantasy.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.620
But I'm trying to think of another sci-fi show that I've watched.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.620
I can't remember.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.620
Anyways, games.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.620
I'm trying to think.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.620
Again, I'm blonde.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.620
It takes me a long time and I'm a hag.

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.620
I don't play a lot of games.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.620
I've never, I've gamed a lot when I was younger.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.620
My dad was a badass and he, we were poor.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.620
So he emulated games on my PC.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.620
Star Trek, yes.

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.620
Star Wars, yes.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:59.620
Battlestar Galactica, yes.

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.620
You prefer haunting a blind manor?

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.620
You're dumb.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620
Get out of here.

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620
Mods.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.620
Kick them out.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:14.620
If you like horror, archive 81 though.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.620
I'm so mad.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.620
Ow, I just hit my arm.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.620
I'm so mad that archive 81 got canceled.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.620
That show fucked me up.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.620
Babylon 5.

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:24.620
I've never heard of Babylon 5.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.620
Never heard of Babylon 5.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.620
I've heard of World of Horror.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.620
I've played Alien Isolation.

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.620
I will not do it again.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.620
I love, yeah, but I love horror though.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:41.620
I want to do like a drunk stream of amnesia, the dark descent, because I think it'd be funny.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.620
Babylon 5 is starting to get me Star Trek.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.620
Ooh, okay.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.620
All right.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.620
I have not watched Star Trek Andromeda.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.620
Have you played FNAF?

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.620
Yes, I've played FNAF.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.620
Of course.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:02.620
You know what I didn't mention?

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:06.620
I didn't like, I also watched, I used to be obsessed with Marvel.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:14.620
Like, when I was like eight or, I don't know how old I was when X-Men the Last Stand came out.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.620
No, I don't really know.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.620
But I saw that it's a shitty movie.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.620
But I just fell in love with the X-Men.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.620
So I was obsessed with the X-Men for the longest time.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.620
Looping the third.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:32.620
I've seen Looping the Third.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:41.620
And then in terms of like anime, I grew up, the first anime, again, my dad, big, big contributor to a lot of the content that I absorbed.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:46.620
He, the first anime I ever watched was The Cat Returns.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.620
Yes, I had a crush on the cat.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.620
X-Men 80s.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.620
I watched the first episode of X-Men 87.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.620
I didn't like it.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.620
Maybe I have to watch it again.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.620
I don't know.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.620
2000s.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.620
It came out of 2006.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.620
Oh, damn.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.620
In the comics.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.620
Yes, I actually have.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.620
I have a lot of old OG Thunderbolt comics right next to me right now.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:21.620
But the thing is, I'm so pissed what they did with the Thunderbolts movie.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.620
I'm so angry.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.620
Like Thunderbolts.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620
I love Thunderbolts.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:31.620
Like in that like, they just totally ruined it.

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.620
Like they just totally retconned everything.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.620
And yeah, I'm not, I don't even want to talk about it.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.620
We can thank Cat Returns for rewinding up an anti-wife.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.620
Yeah, I guess so.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.620
Yeah, I've been watching Mushu Tensei.

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.620
I can't pronounce it.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:53.620
I also really like, because I like dungeon meshi so much, I like went on a binge watch of watching food related enemies.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:55.620
Enemies.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:56.620
Enemies.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.620
So I watched like a little bit of food wars.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.620
It's fucking weird.

01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.620
I'm not finishing that.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:09.620
And then I watched my cooking skill from another world or using my cooking skill in another world or useless or whatever.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.620
I don't know what's the trend with some anime lately.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.620
Just having the weirdest names.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.620
So.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.620
I should be banished to catch a stream.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:20.620
I really like Marvel.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.620
Personally, I don't know.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.620
No DC lovers here.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.620
No DC.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.620
Fuck DC.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.620
Yeah.

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.620
But I don't mind Isekai that bad.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.620
But I'm really like, people like, I hate Isekai.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.620
Isekai sucks.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.620
And then I realized I didn't know how prevalent it was in the anime.

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:47.620
It was like, I grew up watching Naruto, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, staying up watching that on Adult Swim.

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:51.620
And just like being like having it on mute so my parents don't hear.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:07:02.620
You know the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist I watched and spoiler where it was the one where a girl gets turned into that bird thing.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.620
I can't quite remember.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:08.620
And then she's like dies and just like covered in blood and like bird feathers everywhere across his bed.

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.620
That's the first thing I saw.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:13.620
And I was like, this is so cool.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.620
Oh no, not me.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.620
Not me.

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:16.620
No.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.620
Not me.

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.620
It was like one of the first like three episodes, I think.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:25.620
It wasn't the, it wasn't the Chimera episode.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.620
It wasn't that one.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:30.620
But someone asked about Junji Ito.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.620
Yes, I read every Junji Ito thing.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.620
I love Junji Ito.

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.620
I love the art style.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.620
I love body horror.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.620
I am a fan of body horror and gore.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:44.620
Although, you know, weirdly enough, I don't super like slasher films.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.620
Like you're not going to catch me watching saw, but like I'll watch it.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:55.620
But I'm like, I prefer more in terms of horror, like spooky, like sparritism.

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.620
Let's see.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.620
I've heard of Let's See.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.620
I've not watched it.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.620
It's episode two.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.620
Oh, okay.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.620
There you go.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:06.620
I've watched both Fullmetal Alchemists.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.620
I have.

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.620
I remember watching PewDiePie play Corpse Party when I was younger.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.620
That was great.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.620
The ring.

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:14.620
Yes.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.620
Psychological horror.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.620
That's right.

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:17.620
I really liked.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:24.620
I think Archive 81 had a little bit of psychological horror.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.620
I like suspense.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.620
Hamels.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.620
Hamels.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:30.620
Joker.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.620
Hands down.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.620
You don't even have to ask.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.620
You don't even have to ask Sans the Lambs.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.620
Of course.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.620
The witch.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.620
That was good.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.620
And the ritual was good too.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.620
Are you into motorcycles?

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.620
They're all right.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.620
I guess.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.620
I like horror visual novels.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:50.620
Yeah.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:55.620
I like, I remember like Ib Corpse Party, Mad Father.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.620
I have not watched Suspiria.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.620
I have not watched that.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620
Yeah.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.620
I remember seven.

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.620
You start to laugh.

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:12.620
But yeah, in terms of games, like I want to play Soul's Likes.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.620
Hold on.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.620
Let me skip ahead a little bit.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.620
Let me skip ahead.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.620
So you got some names here.

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:22.620
Little girl, big mama and big man.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.620
You already know big man is booming.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:34.620
I also call him Metro booming or the boomster or titties because he has a little pouch that makes him look like he has little titties.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:41.620
Little girl, she's named after a character from Elden Ring.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:46.620
Can you guess what her name is?

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:52.620
And then big mama is Reina, which is funny because it sounds like Ronnie.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.620
But that's not where like the spelling is similar.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.620
Just rearrange the letters, but it's not.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:01.620
Let's see.

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.620
Let's say Ronnie.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.620
No, Raya.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.620
Molina.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:06.620
No.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.620
Melania.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.620
No.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.620
Dong eater.

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.620
Yeah.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.620
Yeah.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:12.620
Come here.

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.620
Dong eater.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.620
Where is she anyways?

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.620
Where's my little dong eater?

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:17.620
I don't even know.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.620
Is she next to me?

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.620
No.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.620
Sometimes she likes to go under my blanket under my legs.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.620
I don't know where she went.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:25.620
Her name is Fia, the death bed companion.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.620
I love to snuggle her.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:30.620
She's a snuggler, this little baby.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.620
Then I can't move because I love snuggling her death.

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.620
Oh, she stinks though because she likes to fart on me and it sucks.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.620
She's really stinky farts.

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.620
So she is, I guess, the dong eater.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.620
You know what I should have put up here for dislikes.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.620
I should have put people who have bad breath that puts me off a lot.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.620
Hate bad breath.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.620
Disgusting.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620
Yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:03.620
It's funny because I didn't know that until recently when I went over a friend's house

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:08.620
and they were house sitting some rabbits that they normally don't have.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.620
And I was like, oh, I love rabbits.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.620
Bunnies are so freaking cute.

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:13.620
Don't get me wrong.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.620
Look at me.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.620
I'm fucking sexy.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.620
Hold on, I'm trying to jiggle my titties but they weren't jiggling the way I wanted to.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.620
Don't worry yourself.

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:31.620
So I was like hanging out with these bunnies and I'm petting them and I'm like, yeah, I forget.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.620
Like it's name is Harold.

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.620
Harold's the hair.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:45.620
And yeah, I almost went to Anaphylactic show after because I'm also mildly allergic to dogs and cats.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:49.620
So if I like, but if I just don't touch my face, I'm fine.

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:57.620
But I had rubbed my hand against my nose after petting the bunny and it was not a good.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.620
And it's funny because my mom's like, oh yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:07.620
And I'm like, why did I inherit the ability to be allergic to rabbits from my mom?

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:11.620
Like I don't, what is the, but like I'll still pet a rabbit.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.620
I don't care.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.620
I'll risk my life to pet myself every day.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:25.620
You might be thinking, wow, Sheeby, you are so full of energy.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.620
You are so extrovert.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:36.620
I'm not actually, I only, I only really get this way when I have to work because I used to work in sales.

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:39.620
But now I'm doing something else.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.620
So I know how to like sell stuff.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.620
So like buy my merch.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.620
I don't have to tell you twice.

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.620
Do it.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:48.620
Buy my merch.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:49.620
I'll show it to you later.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.620
Let me take a step on my team.

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.620
I look so funny when I'm drinking.

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:09.620
Oh, I don't even know where I put the.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.620
There it is.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.620
Can I just like drop this in here?

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:18.620
Oh, I can't.

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.620
Can I just download this?

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.620
My link for my merch is in my description.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.620
Check the description down below and you can get merch.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:35.620
What's there?

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.620
Oh, please.

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:45.620
Can I please just copy and paste for the love of Christ Almighty.

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.620
My voice is starting to crack though.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.620
There it is.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.620
Look at it.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.620
I got my own merch.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.620
That's it.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:01.620
It's funny because like one of my goals being a Vtuber, I was like, I always got my own merch and then I'm signed on and I get merch.

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:08.620
And I was like, I've always wanted to voice in a video game and I'm signed on and I'm in a video game which is coming out soon.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.620
I've seen some of the promotional art for the game.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.620
Oh my God.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.620
You're definitely going to be seeing my cotton bum.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.620
That's all I can say.

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.620
But yeah, go check that out.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.620
Check out the other girls merch too as well.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:29.620
Make sure that you look at the description below and yeah.

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.620
We've got some cool standees.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:44.620
So if you want to, you know, have me on your desk so I can like and you can like put a little sticky note under my head that just says like you fucking suck or something like I'm salting you.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:49.620
And then I got a key chain and then I got, um, what else do I got?

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:53.620
I got a sweatshirt and sweatpants and I think I want to go for myself too.

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.620
Let me get rid of this.

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.620
Sorry.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:02.620
Again, the bun speak voice comes, comes out when I'm excited.

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.620
Put in the jar.

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.620
Excuse me.

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.620
Do not, do not put me in the jar, please.

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:14.620
Please don't put me in the jar.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.620
After getting to a car accident, I jumped off a cliff.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.620
That is true.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:30.620
I was sleeping over at my friend's house and we were going to get McDonald's.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:35.620
It was like 2am and she's like, yeah, what's the McDonald's?

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.620
And I'm like, yeah, let's get frosty.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:41.620
So we are, I'm like, I forgot what it was, but I wasn't driving because I wasn't old enough to drive yet.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.620
Nine out of ten.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.620
Okay.

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.620
Thank you.

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.620
Eight out of ten.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.620
Perfect.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.620
Oh, six out of ten.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.620
Perfect.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.620
Nine out of ten.

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:55.620
And so we're driving.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:56.620
We're driving.

01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:03.620
And then this person had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel while she was texting.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.620
So like double whammy.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:13.620
And so she fell asleep and she, her foot just pressed into the pedal and she rammed us from behind.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:18.620
And then we fishtailed and spun out on the highway.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.620
It was crazy.

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:25.620
And she, the other driver, flipped over the barrier.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:29.620
And so we're pulled over.

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:33.620
We're like off in the middle pulled over kind of.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:38.620
And my friend runs across the highway.

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.620
Like, yeah, it's 2am.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.620
But people are still driving.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.620
She runs across the highway to check on the other driver.

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.620
I'm calling 911.

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:49.620
You know what?

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:52.620
We literally all walked away.

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:53.620
Fine.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.620
Like I didn't get injured.

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.620
I had like a little bit of whiplash.

01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.620
So did my friend.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:09.620
And the other driver who flipped over the guardrail didn't, didn't, she only had like a little bit of scratches on her hands because like her phone was in her hand when she fell asleep.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.620
It was crazy.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:18.620
So I call my mom to come pick me up because I'm like, I just want to go home and be with my mommy.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:19.620
And yeah.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.620
Oh, lucky that I should like 100%.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.620
We all should have freaking died.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:26.620
Like it was, it was, it was crazy.

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:28.620
I don't, it was really crazy.

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:31.620
But um, and I'm like, you know what, you know what I should do?

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:37.620
I should jump off a cliff because the next day I was invited to go to this quarry and the quarry is this place where

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.620
there's like a, it's like a, kind of got water hole, but it's, there's cliffs all around.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:48.620
It's like an old rock quarry, but it's full of water and people usually go and jump and swim in there.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:57.620
And so I'm like, mom, can I, like I was invited to go with my friends and I'm like, mom, can I please, can I please go to the quarry with the girls?

01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.620
And my mom's like, yeah.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:04.620
And I'm like, and then I got there.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:07.620
One, it was a, it was a dump, by the way.

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:14.620
Like don't anytime, any place that there's like not publicly maintained.

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:17.620
Like there was like beer bottles broken.

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.620
I'm pretty sure I saw needles.

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:20.620
There was like shit everywhere.

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:26.620
I cut my foot on a bottle walking barefoot and then I slipped on a rock.

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:34.620
And then there's a part of the cliff that's 50 feet up.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.620
And I'm like, you know what?

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.620
Let me jump off.

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.620
I almost died before.

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:45.620
Let's try it again.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:50.620
Cue the Kermit jumping off the building gift.

01:18:50.620 --> 01:19:02.620
And I hit the water and I think I actually got worse whiplash from that because I landed like kind of folded in half and I snapped back up.

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:08.620
And yeah, what was fun, I can just say, it's just a fun story to tell.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:11.620
Do you know that the voice one?

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:15.620
I lost two of my bunny lives.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:18.620
I don't know, bunnies have lives like cats, but yeah.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.620
I met the voice of Mario.

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:22.620
He was pretty sick, came into my job once.

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.620
I don't even know why he was there.

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:31.620
And he's like taking pictures and videos with some of my coworkers and I'm just there like, oh my God, my child.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.620
Oh my God, my childhood is right in front of me.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:39.620
Mario, I used to fucking play the shit out of Mario on the Wii.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:43.620
And he's like, oh, do you want a picture?

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:58.620
I'm like, no, no, no, I couldn't because like as someone who has been in the entertainment industry for a while outside of VTubing, I know how annoying it is to have people walk up to you and be like, can I get a picture?

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.620
So I was like, oh, no, I'll just sit back.

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.620
But he was just like, he was so nice.

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:15.620
He insisted on taking a picture and I sent it to my parents and my dad was like, oh my God, my mom was like, yes, Charles, he is the sweetest, the sweetest person ever.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.620
I will tell you that, not Chris Pratt.

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:19.620
It was not Chris Pratt.

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.620
That would be funny though.

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:25.620
Where did my, okay, there it is.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.620
I'm losing my voice.

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.620
I want to be a souls like first souls.

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:31.620
I was going to play Bloodborne, but they didn't do a port like I wanted.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.620
So come on, Sony.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:39.620
Looks like, I don't know if I can learn Japanese, but I would like to.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.620
I know a little bit of Spanish.

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.620
I know a little bit of French.

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:44.620
Who knows?

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:45.620
Who knows?

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.620
Have you hit 100K views?

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.620
That'd be so cool.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.620
Hit 10K subs.

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:54.620
I'm almost halfway there, which is crazy to me.

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.620
Crazy German.

01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:57.620
How are you live?

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:58.620
Don't know.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.620
I am Scottish too.

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:09.620
So I could try to learn Scots and feel like I'm not culturally appropriating or something.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.620
Yeah.

01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.620
Shadow of the Erd Tree soon.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:12.620
I know.

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.620
I know people have asked me like, are you going to play that on stream?

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:19.620
I don't know why, but Elden Ring is a comfort game to me.

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:25.620
I don't know if I'll play it on stream because that is a game that pulled me through

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.620
a very, very tough situation.

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.620
You know, you get down in the dumps.

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.620
Got that mental Illinois.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:36.620
And that's, that is a game I just put poured so many hours into.

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:37.620
Yes, a comfort game.

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.620
You, we be like, how is the souls like a comfort game?

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:50.620
But like, it was, it was a way to helpfully kind of express my frustration on a video.

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:54.620
Although I have broken a pair of headphones before, so I can't really talk of headphones I'm wearing right now.

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:59.620
I actually broke while playing a lot as a PA smash, smash them on the ground.

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:07.620
But it was just like, I liked the dopamine I got from beating a boss from coming with the builds.

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:12.620
It was, it was really fun to nerd out on something I normally don't nerd out on.

01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.620
Because again, like I've said in the past, I played a lot of CSGO.

01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:20.620
I played Overwatch, not playing Overwatch 2.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.620
I played a lot of like FPS games.

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.620
Like I play a lot of cod.

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:32.620
I didn't like I play a lot of Valorant, but I'm not like in the last year or so.

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.620
I haven't been playing any FPSs.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.620
And I've been playing like inscription.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.620
I've been playing, you know, some horror games.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.620
I've been playing, I'm trying to think of more games that I've played.

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.620
The coffin of Andy and Laylay I've played.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.620
Your CS2 account got hacked.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.620
Oh no.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:56.620
Yeah, I gambled like 1000s of skins away.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.620
So fuck that game.

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:04.620
I do want to play buckshot roulette because that, they have like the best fucking music.

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.620
Almost like every time.

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:13.620
Neo and Neo 2 for so, wait, hold on a second.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:18.620
Neo is a souls like.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.620
I didn't even know that.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.620
I also play a lot of Skyrim.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.620
Plates of Minecraft, although I'm not good at Minecraft.

01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.620
Yeah, I'm going to mow you guys down at a convention, by the way.

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:36.620
So like, although as Strani mentioned, we were kind of gypped by that place, which really sucked.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:39.620
Like I really wanted to do the convention.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:45.620
But hopefully next year, or maybe, you know, another convention pops up.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.620
Hades, I want to play Hades.

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.620
I want to play Hades.

01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:49.620
Do you mod Skyrim?

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.620
Yes.

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.620
Although I played it on mod at first.

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.620
I was recently playing Oblivion as well.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:04.620
We're going to be playing Vampire of the Masquerade at the end of the week.

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:08.620
And we are turning those boobs up.

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.620
I want to play more retro games.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.620
Travel.

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.620
I want to do Off Club with the Girls.

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:14.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:31.620
And then if you are a streamer or a Vtuber watching this, please, just because I'm a lewd ASMR creator, please do not get off put on hanging out with me.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620
I don't bite.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.620
I just feel bad.

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:45.620
I was, I knew that, like, for example, for the watch along stuff, like a lot of people were kind of going to snub us because of the content that we do, but we do do normal content on YouTube.

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.620
And then there are companies that are say so.

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:58.620
I'm doing air quotes that you cannot see that a backshot roulette that do worse than us.

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:04.620
So, like, I, I don't, I just want to be friends with people.

01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:09.620
I want to, you know, branch out, network, help the other girls network.

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:14.620
It's, I probably won't have any collab set up for a bit just so I can get my bearings.

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:18.620
But what, no lewd tuba.

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:19.620
No, what are you talking about?

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.620

01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:40.620
Yeah, I'm a good Christian girl.

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.620
You know, I was a nun.

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:45.620
You won't believe it, but I was a nun.

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.620
Is that too on the nose?

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.620
How long?

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:55.620
Short amount of time.

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:59.620
This is too class.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:04.620
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:05.620
Okay.

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.620
Is there my tags?

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.620
What do you guys want your fan name to be?

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.620
Because I don't know.

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.620
I don't know.

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.620
Hold on.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:21.620
Let me, I'm on a hold on ventral cause moment I want to go into my notes on my phone.

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:26.620
And I'll tell you what I had for ideas at first.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:32.620
So Strani initially came up with love bunnies and I'm like, that's too long.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.620
And then I was like bumpkins cause I'm bum.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:38.620

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.620
Cause yeah.

01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:44.620
Excuse me whippersnappers cause I'm a hag and I have a whip.

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:46.620
Whaskley rabbits.

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:51.620
Do you know a group of rabbits is called a fluffle?

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:56.620
Fluffle bros, bun buddies, bum buddies.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:00.620
But then the other day it came to me in a dream.

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.620
Harem.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.620
Harem.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.620
Harem.

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:10.620
You are my harem.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.620
Shibbatees.

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.620
Shibbatees toilets.

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:20.620
Or I was also thinking harlets but like spell it like hairlets.

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:23.620
You are my harlets.

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.620

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:29.620
So the nun bun, yeah that's not going to flow.

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.620
Fluffers, you know those fluffles on Club Penguin.

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:37.620
So I didn't realize that's probably where they got the name from.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.620
Alright let's do a vote, let's do a vote.

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.620

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:43.620
Start a poll.

01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.620
Okay, ask a question.

01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:50.620
Alright.

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.620
Rabin turns.

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.620
That's pretty good.

01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.620
I can't call you bun sluts guys.

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:04.620
Although I already say a lot of bad things.

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.620
You're not my dom-

01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:07.620
You're not doming me.

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:09.620
I'm doming you.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:11.620

I'm ready for some ASMR.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:18.620
All I see are three options.

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.620
Oh did I fuck it up?

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.620
It's fine.

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:21.620
Don't worry about it.

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:22.620
Hello good evening mathem.

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.620
Good evening.

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:25.620

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.620
Someone time him out.

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:34.620
Time is a bit joke.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.620
I am my dom.

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.620

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:43.620
Again I will fuck you up.

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.620
Are you British?

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:46.620
And whatever you want me to be darling.

01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:47.620
You want me to be British?

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:48.620
I can be British.

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.620
You want a bottle of water?

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.620

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.620
Here catch.

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:57.620
Tea is the best British beverage known to man.

01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:01.620
I'm drinking a ginger-

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.620
Ginger lemon tea.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.620
Sweet tea.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.620
Now I know you from the south sweetheart.

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:19.620
If you like French-

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.620
I heard French accent.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:22.620
If you like sweet tea.

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:26.620
I can do a French accent as well.

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:28.620
It is not as good.

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:34.620
My name is Shibi Kotemban.

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:39.620
I would like to fuck you in the ass.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.620

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:46.620
Sweet tea.

01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.620
Yes, Baguette.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.620
I live in France.

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.620
Hi Amy.

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.620
Amy is like shut up.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.620
I think Amy speaks Quebecois.

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:01.620
So.

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.620
The sac les bleus.

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:05.620
On les deux fromage.

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:09.620
Do you know how I do the French accent?

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:15.620
I think of Lumière from the beauty and the beast.

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.620
All I have to do is in my head say

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.620
Don't you know she is the one.

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.620
And then I can do it.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:23.620
Je dors madame.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:24.620
You better.

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620
Croissant.

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.620
I am not Canadian.

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:31.620
All from fucking America.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.620
Fuck yeah.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.620
Suck my.

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.620
Anyways.

01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:40.620
French-

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.620
I have that je ne sais quoi.

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.620
Beauty and the beast is front.

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:48.620
Are you kidding me right now?

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:50.620
Are you kidding me right now?

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.620
Finish the sentence.

01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:59.620
We got some Canadians.

01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:01.620
We got some Europeans.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:03.620
We got them all.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.620
Do you see Los Muthrobs?

01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:07.620
Yes.

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:08.620
Actually no.

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:10.620
I don't like musicals in Brooklyn.

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:12.620
I am walking here.

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:15.620
But when I do a Brooklyn accent

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.620
I just start sounding like I am from Jersey.

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:23.620
Or I can sound like your Jewish aunt.

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.620
You know your brother was a doctor.

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:27.620
You know.

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.620
Uncle did that once.

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.620
Bastard.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.620
Pack the fucking kind.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:35.620
Have a yard kid.

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:36.620
I swear to God.

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:38.620
Do not come at me with that shit.

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:39.620
Alabama.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.620
I fuck my sister.

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.620
That's Alabama accent.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.620
I can't do Austrian.

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:51.620
Australian is one I can't do

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:54.620
because I just end up sounding British.

01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.620
Roll that.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.620
Run.

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:07.620
Oh boy.

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.620
You guys get to have her after me.

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.620
That sounds weird.

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:17.620
You guys get to have her after I am done with her.

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:19.620
All right.

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.620
So it looks like.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.620
It looks like it was harem.

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.620
Okay guys you are the harem.

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:26.620
I am losing my voice.

01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.620
Oh shit.

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.620
Where did my chat go?

01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:31.620
No I don't want to see the viewer count.

01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:32.620
Fuck.

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.620
Let me just talk with the girls real quick.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:45.620
Damn.

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.620
When I tell you.

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:50.620
I was so.

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:52.620
Worried.

01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:54.620
That I am like okay.

01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:55.620
Oh I forgot to shoot.

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.620
I made art too by the way.

01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:58.620
Of the girls.

01:33:58.620 --> 01:33:59.620
I just forgot.

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:00.620
I didn't.

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:02.620
Like I had pictures for like a lot of my likes.

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:03.620
I just didn't.

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:05.620
Toggle them because I was just.

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.620
Too lazy.

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:09.620
Where is it?

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:11.620
Whoop.

01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:13.620
Throw that off to the side.

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:15.620
Oh shit.

01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:16.620
I don't know what the fuck I am moving.

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.620
I am a smart of the girls.

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.620
I am my iPad real quick like.

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:24.620
So these girls.

01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:26.620
I love them to death.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.620
You do not understand.

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:29.620
I will kill.

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.620
I will hurt someone.

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:34.620
If you cross.

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.620
You think you are thinking I am joking.

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.620
You are thinking I am not even going to put on toggles.

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.620
Because that will just be stupid.

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.620
If you hurt these girls feelings.

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.620
If you make them cry.

01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:49.620
If you leave a bad comment.

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.620
I will.

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.620
You don't think I will.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.620
But I know how to find you.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.620
Okay.

01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.620
You better be nice.

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:02.620
I would die for these girls.

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:04.620
Better make them smile.

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.620
Down bad com.

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.620
What if they want you to find us?

01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:12.620
Well.

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:14.620
We might end up in the bottom of a ditch then.

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.620
But.

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:21.620
I am starting to sound like Mercy the way I am talking.

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:24.620
But yeah.

01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:27.620
Strani feels like my sister.

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.620
We are on the same wavelength.

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.620
She said in her debut that.

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.620
I was supposed to be her in another life.

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.620
And dude.

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.620
That just.

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:40.620
Oh.

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:41.620
I want to make me cry.

01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.620
Because that's just.

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.620
She's so talented.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.620
And I can't.

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:48.620
Tearing up a little bit.

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.620
Just nice.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.620
And then is her so sweet.

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.620
Is her the sweetest person.

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:56.620
Like I can't.

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.620
Like I just love hearing her talk.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.620
She's so helpful.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.620
Like.

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.620
She's.

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.620
She is.

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.620
She's also just crazy good at games.

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:05.620
It's just.

01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:06.620
She's nasty.

01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:08.620
She's just awesome.

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:09.620
And I just love hearing her talk.

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:11.620
And encouraging me.

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:13.620
Cause like I just know everything's going to be okay.

01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:14.620
I see.

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:15.620
I see.

01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:16.620
I see my girl.

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.620
She's the first person I talked to.

01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:19.620
We're the first two people.

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.620
She was accepted before me.

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:23.620
And he wrote my eyes.

01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.620
Because I'm crying.

01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:26.620
Tearing up a little bit.

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:27.620
Cause I love them.

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.620
I see was the first person I talked to in the server.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.620
And he immediately headed off.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.620
She's so sweet.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620
She's so down to earth.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620
She loves her cats.

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.620
I love my cats.

01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:38.620
She's like.

01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:40.620
She's so wonderful.

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.620
And so talented.

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:43.620
And.

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:45.620
I don't do anything for her.

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:46.620
Emmy is so.

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:49.620
Also one of the most fucking talented people she told me.

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:51.620
She's like I applied to other companies.

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:52.620
And they said.

01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:54.620
No.

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.620
And I'm like huh.

01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:57.620
She could play piano.

01:36:58.620 --> 01:36:59.620
She can sing well.

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.620
She's a fucking amazing artist.

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:03.620
Holy crap.

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.620
Like I don't.

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:08.620
You guys don't even know.

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:11.620
Like there's some things you don't know behind the scenes.

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:13.620
And I'm like how are you not picked up.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:15.620
By like hello live or some shit.

01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:16.620
Like you know.

01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:18.620
Cause she dunk.

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.620
Yeah.

01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:20.620
She could dunk.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.620
But she's also just the sweetest.

01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:24.620
And I love her.

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:25.620
You're talking about her rats.

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:27.620
Oh my God.

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:28.620
And then mercy.

01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.620
Mercy.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.620
Mercy.

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.620
Wow.

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.620
Like me and her.

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:35.620
Thick as thieves.

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:36.620
It's bad.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:39.620
We're bad together.

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.620
We're so fucking toxic.

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:42.620
But in a good way.

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.620
In terms of like.

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:45.620
Like we're just like.

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.620
Like evil with each other.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.620
Like.

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:53.620
Oh it's just.

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.620
Oh it's just.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.620
I just love her.

01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.620
She's like if I need a bitch and moan about something.

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:00.620
She's the one I'll go to.

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.620
And then.

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.620
She'll just be like fuck those hoes.

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.620
And I'm like.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:06.620
Oh my thing died again.

01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:08.620
Cause I'm just so excited talking about mercy.

01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:11.620
And.

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.620
I just like she just cheers me up.

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.620
I remember I forget what happened.

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:18.620
I think.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.620
I was worried about like I said before like my job interview with.

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.620
Going to their job.

01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:25.620
And she's like you're going to fucking get this shit.

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:26.620
Fuck.

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:29.620
And like you know mercy might be coming off as shot.

01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:30.620
She's not.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:31.620
She's just warming up.

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.620
I'll tell you that right now.

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.620
She.

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620
Yeah.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.620
She has my back.

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.620
She has all these girls backs.

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:40.620
She she's also ride or die.

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:41.620
I'll tell you that right now.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.620
She was everybody's perfect castings.

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:45.620
Perfect castings.

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.620
I wouldn't.

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.620
Think of.

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.620
Another way to cast any of them.

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:52.620
Cause people are like.

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:54.620
Oh it's this person's this person's this person's this person's.

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:58.620
And then like everything just fell into place perfectly.

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:00.620
And.

01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:02.620
They're just.

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.620
I'm so glad that it's them.

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:05.620
Like they're.

01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:07.620
I can say that they're close friends.

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.620
Like.

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.620
Well you don't get that and sometimes in gens.

01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.620
You don't get that sometimes in gens.

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.620
But.

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620
I don't know.

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:17.620
They're just wonderful.

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:18.620
Ball oil machine.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:19.620
Yeah.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.620
Mommy you had to pick them.

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.620
Moment knew how to pick them.

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:24.620
It's not your toxic.

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.620
Okay.

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:27.620
So we're gonna.

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:28.620
Wait.

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:36.620
The thing about my like transition is that.

01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:38.620

01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.620
Please like it shows me.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.620
And I don't know why it does before.

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.620
So we're going to go over.

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.620
Some arrows.

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:50.620
Oh wow.

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:52.620
Oh my god.

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.620
I'm gonna have it cover you guys.

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.620
My voice is gone.

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.620
My neighbors are walking by again.

01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.620
Put it right there.

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.620
We're going to go quick through these because it only got like.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:05.620
40 minutes.

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:06.620
Do you have permission to fluff my ears?

01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:07.620
No.

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:09.620
Do not touch me unless I give you permit.

01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:10.620
Well actually.

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.620
You did ask permission but no.

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.620
Is it true that looking rabbits hold on a second.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.620
Let me just.

01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.620
I'm like looking wrong.

01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:28.620
There we go.

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.620
Now I'm facing the right direction.

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.620
Is it true that looking a rabbit's foot brings good luck?

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:33.620
Yes.

01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:36.620
You during some sessions.

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:41.620
I know I have people travel far and wide just to lick my feet.

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:43.620
Because I'm pretty good luck.

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.620
Yeah.

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:47.620
They think it's like oh if I have a rabbit's foot.

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.620
It's.

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:53.620
Licking a rabbit's foot is the correct terminology by the way.

01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:59.620
I heard that you're a distant relative of Jessica Rabbit.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.620
Of who framed your rabbit fame.

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:04.620
Could you please say in your hottest voice.

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:05.620
I'm not bad.

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.620
I was drawn that way.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:07.620
Okay.

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.620
Hold on.

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.620
My voice is gone so I need to.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.620
I'm not bad.

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.620
I'm just drawn that way.

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:18.620
That was bad but my voice is going so.

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.620
As a rabbit are you big.

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:22.620
Are you scared of big hawks.

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:24.620
No.

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.620
They'll punch a hawk.

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:30.620
I'm not bad.

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:32.620
I'm not bad.

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.620
I'm just drawn that way.

01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:36.620
That was bad but my voice is going so.

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:38.620
Elevator.

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:41.620
Anyway.

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:45.620
Hi Sibe.

How did you know it was the right corporate for you again.

01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:52.620
Like I said I've been looking into real Earth since.

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:58.620
Mommy decided to even talk other the word I want to be.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:59.620
I want to make a corporate.

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.620
I was like I want to be in it so I you know.

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.620
I don't know.

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620
I don't know how I got here.

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:09.660
Dreams
