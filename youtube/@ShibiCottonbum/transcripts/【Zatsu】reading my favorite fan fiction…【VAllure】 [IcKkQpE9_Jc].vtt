My favorite

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
MCR song

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Wait, is it by MCR?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Or is it by Good Charlotte?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
It's Teenagers by MCR

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Black Parade was written about me

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
You know what one of my

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Handles was when I was a kid

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I was Mistress Muffin

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
XXX

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And I was also like Lady Mistress

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I don't even know what the I didn't even know what that meant

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Welcome to the Black Parade

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
That's for like

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
That's like too mainstream for me

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
You know

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I've been day drinking, no

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm just talking in a different voice for my

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
For my emo face

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Lady Mistress

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Yubi is more a 3-2 for sweet or french time

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Or

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
What's the song?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Local hack tries being cute

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm not trying to be cute

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm a vampire

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Alright

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I sleep in a coffin

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
And you know what

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Let me describe my outfit please

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I woke up this morning

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I put on

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
My black lace panties

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
And my red and black lace bra

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I slid on

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
My black tights

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
That were ripped

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
And I threw on an MCR T-shirt

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
In my favorite MCR red hoodie

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I put on a choker with a bat on it

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
And I put on makeup

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
No foundation though

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Cause I'm already so pale and white

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
You know

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm not wearing pants

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Don't cut yourself on the edge

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Don't threaten me with a good time

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
We're uh

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
We're bringing

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We're bringing emo

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Doraike

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Whatever it's called

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
My spark

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
This is the skin of a killer Bella

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
This is the skin of a killer

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Come on Yubi

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Let's go buy overpriced anime shirts

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
From Hot Topic

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
And split a marb red

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Until we get kicked out

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Hell yeah

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
You guys want to go to the mall

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I want to get my clipped pierce at Claire's

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I already got my nipples pierced there

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
You guys

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
You guys want to get your clipped pierce with me

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
What do you mean what

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
We're going to look at all the toys they got

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
You have an lobotomy appointment at Claire's?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Oh okay

I see that you're busy then

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Maybe I'll do a little bit of

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
A little bit of shoplifting

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
At Spencers

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Maybe I'll

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You know

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Blow a car up

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Maybe I'll just hate the patriarchy

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Maybe I'll just post pictures of myself on my phone

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
And revealing poses

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't know

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I don't really care much about anything

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
You know

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Cause I'm

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Gothic

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Can we go to the food court

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
And order five pounds of Chinese

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
No I only drink blood

I only drink human blood

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I only drink muckled blood

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I only drink muckled blood

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I only drink muckled blood

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
I only drink muckled blood

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Caring is for preps

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Fuck caring

But somebody did send me one

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
What you might call it

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Fanfiction that I thought would be funny to read

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I didn't read the whole thing

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
They said it might be too spicy

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
And I'm like you know what

My fan

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
But I'm still here

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Cause I'm a real gothic

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
And I'm a vampire

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
And I can't die

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Welcome to my bedroom

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
How many of these do you fan fix?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Did I write?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
None

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I just relate to them a lot

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
You know

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Okay let me turn my BGM down

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I'm gonna turn on some other music

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Actually no I think this music will be suitable

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
For this one

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I have like some copyright free

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Hogwarts themed music

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Let me move up

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Can I move this over?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Okay

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
It's a Harry X Drake one

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
This one I don't know

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
It's called First Encounter

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Thank you to the

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Anon that submitted it

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
The characters in the story

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Slowly belong to JK Rowling

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Whatever the fuck her name is

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
One of her brothers

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
So it's an unbaited

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't know what that means

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
In some one shot

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
It was made in

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
2006

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I need to move my

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Camera tracker out of the way

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Are you ready?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I wanted to make a fanfic

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
But I was worried it would be too long

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
And no one understands it

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Since I was making a deal

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I wrote

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
A 100 plus page fanfic

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
About how down bad

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I was for Zetsu

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
From the Akatsuki

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Cause I did a self insert

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Of myself and every Shippuden

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
My character

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
My OC

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
And every Shippuden episode

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
That the Akatsuki were in

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
In Daedora

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Naturally

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
In Kisame

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Naturally

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
In Pain

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
And all of them

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Especially Haydn

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
They're all hot

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Okay

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Her power levels

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I also made a young justice

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Fanfiction that was 80 pages long

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
And I self inserted my OC's

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Into every young justice episode

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And I shipped my character

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Who was

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
By the way

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Her name was Missy

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
And her last name was Chief

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
And so her hero name

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Was Miss Chief

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
And she was

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Or she would also

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Would get the nickname

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Pantamime

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
And

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
And she was a shapeshifter

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
That could

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Temporarily

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Take on the powers

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Of who she shapeshifted into

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
That's why she was called Miss Chief

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Cause she would usually just

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Fuck shit up

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I was like mistake

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Missy Chief

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Melissa Chief

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Fucking hilarious

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
And I shipped myself

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
With Clarion

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
For some reason

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Clarion the witch boy

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
I don't know

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
What was going on with that

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
If you know you know

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Okay

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Sorry yeah

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Goth girls don't laugh

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm laughing at

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
You actually

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm laughing at your pain

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Cause it

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It awakens something in me

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Nobody had no Clarion the witch boy

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah it was when

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Was I a bottom in my gut

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Nope

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
No I was mostly

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I think I was

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Because I was such a fucking loser

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
And shy

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I think I made myself the top

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
In most scenarios

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
In my fanfictions

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
That I wrote when I was like 14

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah well cause Clarion

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
The witch boy

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Shows up in Young Justice

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
As like one of the first villains

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
And I just fell in love

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm so edgy

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm so edgy

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Don't cut yourself

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
On all my edge

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Or do cause we're being

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Gothic and emo

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Just kidding don't

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Don't do that

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I do not condone self harm

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
It was 40 years ago

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Wasn't it?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Azeroth Metrion Zhentos

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
First time chatter

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Hello hi

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I like the anime that your name is from

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
What about harming others

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Only what they say for

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Anyways

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Let's get started

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I think I've yapped

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Clarion is even using the comics

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Is he?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh well he was using the show then

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
For some reason

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Reina are you singing the song of your people

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Sorry

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
She's a

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
She's listening to Good Charlotte right now

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And she's singing to it

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Cause she's she's Gothic

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Okay

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
So we're gonna read first encounter

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I think this is like a personification

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Of like

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Hogwarts

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
For some reason

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Very Hattalia axis powers

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Remember Hattalia

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh my god

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Hattalia

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Hattalia

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Sort of thing

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Who the fuck is the skinware?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
It's me

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm Shiboni

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Shiboni

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Hogwarts side

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And it echoed within its empty halls

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
His empty halls

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Sorry again

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
It's personified

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
The students had all left for the summer

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
And he felt empty and useless

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Hagrid was often around

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Reina please

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Reina what are you yelling about

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I wish you guys could hear her

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
She's literally just going

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Reina come here

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
She usually has a toy in her mouth

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
She's aware life is pain

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
What is that

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Was it

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Michael Fassbender

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Oh

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Like

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Who is like

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
In

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
In um

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Like X-Men first class

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I think he's like

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Life is pain

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
I can't remember

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Who says that

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
This is a fanfic

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
I don't know

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
We'll find out

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Hagrid was often around

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
But he was usually too focused

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
And bizarre animals

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
To fulfill the needs of Hogwarts

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Professors would pop in occasionally

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
But being in magic school

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Hogwarts didn't need much upkeeping

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
The little he did need was taken of

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
By

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Filch

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
He shuddered

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Causing small trembles

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Of his halls

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
That was barely discernible

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Except by the spiders and owls

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
He didn't care much for Filch

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Wishing he could

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Or Filch

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I don't

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Disclaimer

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I've never

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I've only read one Harry Potter book

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
I read the first one

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
If you're a Harry Potter fan

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
I don't really care

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
The books are mid

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
I never put the game

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
It's funny

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Cause I love fantasy

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
But I never got into Harry Potter

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
I don't know why

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Well

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
One cause my parents were like

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
It's demonic

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
And then my dad's like

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
I don't fucking care

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Actually you can read it

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
I'm like alright

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
This is

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Mid at best

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I'd rather read something else

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
That's when I was like

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Up picks up name of the wind

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Picks up the magicians instead

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Picks up American gods

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
He shuddered

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Causing small trembles

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
He didn't care much for Filch

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Filch

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I'mma call him Filch

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Pretty light fantasy

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Wishing he could walk

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Without his squib feet

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Touching his magnificent stone floors

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
He had long since stopped trying to force his floors

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Open to swallow Filch

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
And miss Nor

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Miss Nor's hole

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
I don't know any of the characters

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Besides

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
If he kept it up

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
He would be risking a prolapse staircase

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
And that was no laughing matter

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
The giant squid

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Saw how miserable Hogwarts was

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
It was true

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
That he also missed his students

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
But for an entirely different reason

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
He missed their terrified screams

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
As he revealed himself

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Rising from the murky depths of the lake

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
I didn't even know there was a

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Giant squid in this

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Fucking series

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
What?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Yeah I don't know what they mean by prolapse staircase

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Don't ask me

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
His huge eyes

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Stared mournfully

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
At his very large tentacles

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
At one time

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
He had dreams of being an actor

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
The larger he grew

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Fucking a fucking actor

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
The larger he grew

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
The fewer agents and scouts would come calling

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Until they finally stopped altogether

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
There wasn't much in the market for a squid

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
That would split a schoolgirl from stem to stern

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Goddamn

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
I'm a squid now

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
He stared at his tentacles

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
As they moved gently in the current

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Schoolgirls were out

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
A plan formed in his mind

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
And he swam to the surface

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Hesitating momentarily

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Before pulling himself from the water

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
It ran off his rubbery skin

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
As he made his way across the grounds

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
No humans were around

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
To witness the incredible trek

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And no human would believe his eyes

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Had he been a witness

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Hogwarts watched the giant approach

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Giant squid approach

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And felt apprehension well up in his kitchen

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I guess I should give it a British accent

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
What are you doing?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
The words weren't spoken

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
But they were understood

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Just trust me

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
The giant squid replied

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Caressing Hogwarts's

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Outer walls

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I'm not ready

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Hogwarts exclaimed

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Trying to push the giant squid away

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
With his magic

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Hogwarts

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
You're lonely

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I can fix that

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I'm lonely

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
We don't have to be

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Besides

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You can't go around manipulating your staircases

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
You know about that

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Everyone does it

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Sort of

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
That's besides the point

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
I've never

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
The temperature within

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Rose in embarrassment

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
I'll go slow

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I promise

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
He began to caress a window

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Teasing it open

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Hogwarts sighed

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
The fight leaving him

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
He relaxed

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Allowing the tentacle inside

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Where it brushed against the inner walls

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Before settling on the stone floor

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
He fashioned the suction cups to the floor

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Lifting the tentacle away

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
So that it pulled the floor

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
On the floor without losing its grip

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Another sigh

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Swept through the halls of Hogwarts

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh, Merlin

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
That feels so good

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
His rapture tap turned to fright

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
As he fell the tentacle work its way

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Into a second window

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I don't

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Trust me

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
It'll feel good

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Remember this?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Wait, there's 80 pages?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
You're lying

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Okay, no, it's only one page

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm like, I'm not

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Reading all of this

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
If um

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
If it's 80 pages

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Trust me

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
It'll feel good

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Remember this?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
He pulled the suction cups a little harder

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
And Hogwarts grown

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Do that again

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
The giant squid complied as he did so

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Thrust the second tentacle in

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Hogwarts shuttered

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Coming very close to ending the fun

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The giant squid backed off

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Unwilling to finish so soon

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
He waited for Hogwarts to calm down

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Before sending the second tentacle

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
To search the room

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
He felt a need to fill Hogwarts

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
As much as possible

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And erased another tentacle

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Caressing his outer walls

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Running along windowsills

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And tracing individual bricks

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
So caught up in the blizz

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Hogwarts didn't even notice

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
The giant squid slipped in a third

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And a fourth tentacle

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
This is incredible

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Hogwarts breathed

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
This isn't even the best part

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
He held up his two longest tentacles

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
These can reach further than the room

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
They can go into your hallways

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I want them in me

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Are you sure?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
They're quite large

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Opera henshin rolled through his kitchen again

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
While he was deciding

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
The giant squid forced another tentacle in

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
You have three tentacles left to decide

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
What happens if I don't?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
In response

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
The giant squid slid a sixth

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Into another window

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Two

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
He simply

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
And with a hint of warning

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
He said simply

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
With a hint of warning

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Hogwarts could take them all

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
He knew he could

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
What would the other wizarding schools think?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Would Boba Tons allow a giant squid

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
To violate her?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Certainly not

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
If DermString ever found out

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
There'd be no end of teasing

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
The giant squid grew impatient

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Slid a seventh tentacle into a window

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Falled immediately by an eighth

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
One

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Two

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Times up

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
And you didn't decide

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
What?

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
But that's not fair

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Why would this wizard get nuked?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
This is perfectly normal

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
This is fine

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
This is Hogwarts the building

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
What?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
But that's not fair

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
It's a simple answer

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I guess I know

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Now I'll have to punish you

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
And with that

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
He struck Hogwarts square

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
On the outer wall of a paddle-like tentacle

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Hogwarts yelped

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
And tried to square it away

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
But the tentacles and his foundation

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Held firm

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
The giant squid struck him with the other

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Again and again

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
He spanked the naughty wizarding school

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Until he sawed for the giant squid to stop

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
And still

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
He spanked

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
This makes me feel funny in my bathroom

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
You like my outfit?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Good

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
You better

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I dressed up

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
All nice and pretty

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
For myself, not for you

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
You thought this was for you

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Baka

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Don't do anything for you

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
The giant squid finally stopped

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
But Hogwarts didn't have time

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
For reprieve before the giant squid

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Forced his extra-long

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Spanking tentacles into two separate windows

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
They slipped through the room

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
And forced the doors open

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
The pain only adding to Hogwarts' pleasure

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The tentacles were in the hall now

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Massaging the long stone

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Tunnels

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
This was incredible

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
The giant squid thought

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
He really should have done this

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
At ages ago

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Every tentacle was in a different window

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
No school girl

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
No matter how many movies she made

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Could hold all tentacles

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
At ten tentacles at once

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Each one moved differently

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
And with a different pace

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Driving Hogwarts crazy

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
With the inability to match his speed

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I'm just waiting to get a raid

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Or someone like I know come in

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
And be like, hey, what are you?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Oh, God

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
He felt that familiar feeling

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And doubled his efforts

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Ink exploded all over Hogwarts

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Some finding its way into the windows

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
He unified his tentacles

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
With the ability to match his speed

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
I'm just waiting to get a raid

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Or someone like I know come in

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
And be like, hey, what are you?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Oh, God

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
He felt that familiar feeling

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And doubled his efforts

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
And unified his tentacles

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Somewhat completely unified

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Can we focus on Hogwarts?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
He must be close

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Then it happened

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Water shot of a faucet

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Toilets overflowed

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
And bread set in ovens

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
To keep warm by thoughtful house elves

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Exploded

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Hogwarts shook violently

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Into his foundations

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Rousing filled from bed

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
And sitting house elves

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And Mrs. Norris scrambling for cover

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Even Hagrid heard the groan

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Of stone and came running

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
They searched around the castle

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
And through the castle

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
But found no sign of intruders

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Most perplexing was the stinky ink

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
On one side of the castle

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Hagrid peered to the dark

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Towards the lake

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
But was unable to see the ripples left

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
In the wake of the giant squid

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
The giant squid slipped beneath the waves

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Wanting to grin even though

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
His beak was incapable

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
He anticipated a very short summer

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Before the professors and students returned

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
So he had better make the most of it

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
And seen

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
That was it

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
That was a first encounter

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
By a

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Lyrus Malachi

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Sorry, Fia is also meowing

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
What is going on guys?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
What you mean by that?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I don't know

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I don't know

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I don't know

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Come on guys

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
What you meowing about?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah, I was hoping some of you guys

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Would have written me some cringe fanfictions

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Of me and the girls

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Or me and

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
A harem

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
A harlot

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
No

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Shook my

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Shook my

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Foundations

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'll tell you what

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Cringe but Kino

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Yeah, a singular

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Member of the harem

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Is called a harlot

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Or a harlot

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I can't write good

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
That's the whole point

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Just wait

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Just wait till I read my immortal guys

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I was disappointed

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
There was no line as memorable as

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Hold on tight spider monkey

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Different franchise

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
But understood

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Okay, let's go to the next one

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I'm going to turn off my BGM

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Because I'm going to put on some Hogwarts related music

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
Wait, I don't think I have the donation stuff on here

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Hold on

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Apologies

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
There it is, okay

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah, I didn't have the donation alert

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
So if you did, I'm sorry, I didn't catch it

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
So let me double check that real quick

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Thank you bun for the tip

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I vastly underestimated the level of

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Cringe you desired

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I have to recalibrate all systems

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Precisely

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I wanted the cringiest stuff

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Okay, let me see

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
If I play this, will it work again?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Well, aren't you just this

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Cool beads

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Recalibrating

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Recalibrating

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Okay

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Fuck

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I want to cover this fucking dude

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Get rid of this

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Nobody needs to see fucking Eric

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
No males on the stream

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Aw frick

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Okay, so this is my favorite fanfiction

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Of all time

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
I hope you will enjoy

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Because I know I will

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
It's yeah, it's a pretty

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
You're right, I set a pretty high bar

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
For that

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Feel, what do you want?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I know you don't need me

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
My cats are just little

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
That's what they eat, but yes

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
It's a cover up Eric

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
It's just pretty normie

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Well, I feel like now it's normie

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Can I?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
If I zoom in more, it's just not going to work out

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Where is

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Is that too loud?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Yes, it is named after the

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Evanescent song

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
It's a bit loud

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Half the text in blue is because

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
It's like

The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again

50:17.360 --> 50:20.320
I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had

50:20.800 --> 50:24.640
My coffin was black ebony and inside was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends

50:25.280 --> 50:30.560
I got on my coffin and took off my giant and I'm gonna say I'm not gonna correct anything that she says

50:30.560 --> 50:36.640
And I took off my giant mcr t-shirt, which I use for pajamas

50:37.920 --> 50:42.720
Instead I put on black leather dress a pentagram necklace combat boots and black fishnets on

50:43.120 --> 50:47.520
I put on four pairs of earrings and my pierced ears and put my hair in kind of a messy bun

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
My friend willow

50:50.560 --> 50:53.440
This is like Irel friend woke up and then grinned at me

50:53.840 --> 50:58.880
She flipped her long waist length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her four screen eyes

50:59.440 --> 51:04.000
She put on her maryland manson t-shirt with a black mini fishnets pointy hide-heeled boots

51:04.960 --> 51:07.760
We put on her makeup black lipstick without foundation and black eyeliner

51:09.120 --> 51:12.640
I'm just gonna use my normal voice for willow because she doesn't show up too much

51:13.920 --> 51:20.480
Oh my fucking god, I saw you talking to drago mouthful yesterday. She said excitedly. Yeah, so I said blushing

51:22.000 --> 51:23.520
Do you like drago?

51:23.520 --> 51:27.920
She asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into of course their Slytherin and into the gray hall

51:28.640 --> 51:30.640
No, I so fucking don't

51:31.280 --> 51:33.280
Yeah, right. She exclaimed

51:33.840 --> 51:35.840
Just then drago walked up to me

51:36.720 --> 51:38.720
Hi, he said

51:38.880 --> 51:40.880
Hi, I replied

51:41.520 --> 51:42.880
alertly

51:42.880 --> 51:44.880
Guess what he said

51:45.440 --> 51:47.440
What I asked well

51:48.000 --> 51:51.280
Good charlotte are having a concert in hogsmeade. He told me

51:51.920 --> 51:54.800

51:55.200 --> 51:57.840

51:59.360 --> 52:01.760
Well, do you want to go out with me wait?

52:03.200 --> 52:06.320
Well, do you want to go with me he asked I gasped

52:09.680 --> 52:11.680
I'm not gonna read all the office notes

52:14.240 --> 52:18.000
On the night of the concert I might just read like the exposition in my normal voice

52:18.720 --> 52:22.000
On the night of the concert I put on my black lace up boots with high heels

52:22.480 --> 52:26.080
God fucking damn she she has to tell you how well she dresses

52:26.480 --> 52:28.160
Underneath them are ripped red fishnets

52:28.240 --> 52:31.760
Then I put on a black leather mini dress with all this corset stuff on the back and the front

52:32.240 --> 52:34.240
I put on matching fishnet on my arm

52:34.720 --> 52:40.800
Arms I straightened my hair and made it look all spiky. I felt a little depressed. So then I slit one of my wrists

52:42.000 --> 52:46.080
I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding and I listened to this gc

52:46.640 --> 52:49.440
I painted my nails black and put on tons of black eyeliner

52:50.320 --> 52:53.840
Then I put on some black lipstick. I didn't put on fedation because I was pale anyways

52:54.320 --> 52:56.880
I don't know what happened to the rest of the time before that, but okay

52:57.200 --> 52:59.700
I drank some human blood. So I was ready to go to the concert

53:01.840 --> 53:03.840
Spiky like Goku

53:04.720 --> 53:09.300

We walked into his into his flying black mercedes benz the license plate said 666 and flew to the place with the concert

54:15.600 --> 54:18.640
On the way we listened excitedly to good charlotte and maryland manson

54:18.880 --> 54:21.200
We both smoked cigarettes and drugs

54:21.840 --> 54:23.920
When we got there we both hopped out of the car

54:24.560 --> 54:28.400
We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to good charlotte

54:29.920 --> 54:31.920
We smoked some drugs

54:32.880 --> 54:34.880
Uh

54:38.400 --> 54:42.000
I don't know how the song goes so i'm just gonna sing it badly

54:43.360 --> 54:45.760

54:46.240 --> 54:51.120
They're all so happy you've arrived the doctor cuts your cord hands you to your mom

54:51.360 --> 54:53.360
She sets you free to this live

54:54.240 --> 54:56.240

54:57.040 --> 55:00.160
Joel is so fucking hot

55:00.480 --> 55:04.560
I said to drago pointing to him as he sung filling the club with his amazing voice

55:05.200 --> 55:07.200
Suddenly drago looks sad

55:07.200 --> 55:10.480
What's wrong? I asked his mom to the music then I caught on

55:11.440 --> 55:14.640
Hey, it's okay. I don't like him better than you I said

55:16.160 --> 55:20.560
Really asked drago sensitively and he put around his arm around me all protective

55:20.880 --> 55:25.520
Really I said besides I don't even know joel and he's going out with hillary fucking duff

55:25.920 --> 55:30.720
I fucking hate that little bitch. I said disgustedly thinking of her ugly blonde face

55:31.760 --> 55:34.160
The night went on really well and I had a great time so did drago

55:34.560 --> 55:38.480
After the concert we drank some beer and asked benji and joel for their autographs and photos with them

55:38.960 --> 55:42.960
We got gc concertees drago and I crawled back into the mercedes-benz

55:43.360 --> 55:47.120
But drago didn't go back to hogwarts instead he drove the car into

55:47.120 --> 55:49.120
The forbidden forest

55:53.120 --> 55:55.120
There's some omega first jargon

55:57.120 --> 56:03.120

56:07.120 --> 56:09.120

Fia stop meowing especially because the concept pilot she likes to meow a lot when she plays I don't even know why I gave her a toy

57:25.120 --> 57:31.120
The concept revolves around the notion that in an alternate universe society and members are split into three categories alphas betas and omegas

57:35.120 --> 57:37.120
Oh

57:37.120 --> 57:43.120
But not in the Andrew Tate type of way. Oh, they had to justify that. Oh, I thought it was gonna be like

57:45.120 --> 57:49.120

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.120
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna accidentally shut off my computer

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.120
Trico I shouted what the fuck do you think you're doing?

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.120
Trico didn't answer but he stopped the flying car and he walked out of it

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:21.120
I walk I don't know were they still in the air because that okay

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120
What the fucking hell I asked angrily

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120
Ebony he asked

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.120
What I snapped

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.120
Draco leaned in extra close

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120
And I looked into his gothic red eyes

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.120
He was wearing color contacts

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:41.120
Which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and suddenly I didn't feel mad anymore

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.120
And then justice

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.120
Suddenly just as I

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.120
Draco kissed me passionately

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120
Draco climbed on top of me

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120
We start to make out keenly against a tree

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.120
He took off my top and I took off his clothes

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.120
Then he put his thingy in my new you know what we did it for the first time

Okay put it to a poll

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.120
Dumbledore doesn't talk too often in the beginning but

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.120
Cute and funny

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.120
Because you might want to say the cute and funny voice for another person

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:24.120
Or cowboy because I like the idea of a cowboy

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:36.120

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.120

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.120
Draco comforted me

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:24.120
When we went back to the castle Dumbledore took us to Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall who were both fucking very angry

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:30.120
They were having sexual intercourse in the forbidden forest I'm sorry I'm like goofy

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.120
They were having sexual intercourse

These fucking kids

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:41.120
They were having sexual intercourse in the forbidden forest

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.120
Iha he yelled in a furious voice

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.120
Why did you do such a thing you mediocre dumpsies

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.120
Asked Professor McGonagall

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.120
How dare you

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.120
Demanded Professor Snape I can't do a Snape voice

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120
Andrako shrieked because I love her

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.120
Wait why am I British

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.120
Because I love her

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120
Patron voice

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.120
Everyone was quiet

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.120
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall still looked mad but Professor Snape said

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.120
Fine very well

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.120
You may go up to your rooms

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.120
Snape never sleep

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.120
Well Harry Potter

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.120
Picking noise

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.120
Potter puppet pals man

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120
Bring you back

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.120
Are you okay Abany

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120
Draco asked me gently

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.120
Yeah I guess

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.120
I lied

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.120
I went to the girls dorm and brushed my teeth and my hair

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:55.120
And chained into a low-cut black floor-length dress with a red lace all around and black high heels

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.120
Iha when I came out of the closet

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.120
Draco was standing in front of the bathroom and he started to sing

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.120
I just want to live by Good Charlotte

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.120
I was so flattered even though he wasn't supposed to be there

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.120
We hugged and kissed

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.120
After that we said good night and he reluctantly went back to his room

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.120
You know Demwell Snape got the victory secret though

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.120
That's not a song

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.120
I'm so scared of that

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.120
I'm really really

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.120
Sorry Eric we're covering your face

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.120
The next day I woke up in my coffin

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.120
I put on a black many skirt

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.120
Many skirt that was all ripped around the end

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.120
And a matching top with red skulls all over it

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120
And high heeled boots

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120
Sorry I was making that again

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120
That were black

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.120
I put on two pairs of skull earrings and two crosses in my ears

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.120
I spring painted my hair with purple

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.120
In the great hall I ate some Count Chocula cereal

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.120
With blood instead of milk

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.120
And a glass of red blood

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.120
Suddenly someone bumped into me

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.120
All the blood spilled over my top

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120
Faster

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120
I shouted angrily

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120
I regretted saying it

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.120
Cause when I looked up

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.120
I was looking to the pale white face of a gothic boy

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.120
The spiky black hair with red streaks in it

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.120
Who could it be

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.120
He was wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down to his fate

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.120
I was going down his face

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.120
And he was wearing black lipstick

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.120
He didn't have glasses anymore

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.120
And now he was wearing red contact lenses just like Draco's

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120
There was no scar on his forehead anymore

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.120
He had manly stubble on his chin

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.120
He had sexy English accent

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.120
He looked exactly like Joel Madden

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.120
He was so sexy that my body went hot

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.120
When I saw him kind of like an erection

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.120
Only a girl so I didn't get when he was sicko

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.120
Alright what's the voice

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.120
What's the voice for vampire aka Harry Potter

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120
Would you like

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120
Like

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.120

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.120
I'm so sorry

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.120
I'm so sorry

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120
That's alright

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120
Yeah I need to go deeper

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.120
I'm so sorry

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.120
Or you want a cute and funny

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.120
I can't do a Donald Duck one

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.120
Transylvanian

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.120
Classic Dracula

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.120
Maybe I can attempt that

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.120
Or corpse

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.120
Do you want me to fucking kill my throat

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120
Goofy?

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120
Okay I don't like Goofy

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.120
He made a mute

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.120
I'm just quiet

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.120
When his lines come up

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.120
I'll be right back while you guys vote

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.120
Goofy

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120
Goofy

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.120
Gosh

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.120
Alright

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.120
We got Goofy

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.120
I'm so sorry

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.120
He said in a shy voice

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.120
That's alright

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120
What's your name

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120
I questioned

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.120
My name's Harry Potter

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.120
Although most people call me vampire these days

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120
He grumbled

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.120
I'm not able to do that

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.120
Why

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120
I exclaimed

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.120
Because I love the taste of human blood

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120
Well

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.120
I am a vampire

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.120
I confess

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.120
Really?

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120
He whimpered

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120
Yeah

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120
I reward

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.120
We sat down to talk for a while

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.120
The dragon came up behind me

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.120
And told me he had a surprise for me

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120
So I went away with him

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120
I know I didn't do the

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.120
Because I love the taste of human blood

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.120
And I'll kill him again

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.120
Goofy did you kill these people

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.120
Have you seen that?

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.120
The Goofy

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.120
Is on trial for murder

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.120
You know I fucking do it again

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.120
Oh yeah with Joji

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.120
Oh my god

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120
That's right

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.120
It's so funny

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.120
So as I've said in the past

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.120
I used to be in the commentary community

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.120
So I was familiar with a lot of like

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.120
Those personalities

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.120
And I remember

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.120
Going to TwitchCon

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.120
And I got to meet anything for views

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.120
And all he did was just select

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.120
Sexually harass me the entire time

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.120
And I got to meet anything for views

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.120
And all he did was just select

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.120
Sexually harass me the entire time

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.120
He's like you got a man

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.120
And I'm like no

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.120
He's like

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.120
I'm gonna come back to my hotel room later

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.120
And I'm like bitch what the fuck

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120
No

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.120
I'm like

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120
He's like how old are you?

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.120
And I'm like

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.120
I wasn't even like offended

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.120
Because I'm like

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120
I'm like is he

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.120
I'm just gonna assume

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.120
He's in character

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.120
No

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.120
No he at

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120
So like I was with a group of friends

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120
And so he's like

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.120
The first thing he asked

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.120
He's like

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.120
Are you dating any of these people?

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.120
Because some of them are girls

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.120
Some of them are guys

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.120
And I'm like no

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.120
Never meet your heroes

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120
Oh yeah

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.120
I remember one of my friends

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.120
After I was like

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.120
What the fuck was that

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.120
Hahaha

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.120
And I'm like

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.120
Okay

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.120
Cool

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.120
I can't remember if he followed me back on Twitter

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.120
Or not

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.120
Probably

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120
Maybe

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.120
Who knows

That sounds a little bit about me

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.120
Alright

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.120
Ever got to get a PewDiePie tattoo

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.120
And then like on his ass

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120
Yeah and then I just went to like

The artist's poll instead

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.120
And just like hung out

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120
And then I played um

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.120
There's like some places

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.120
Play people like game places there

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.120

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120
Or

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.120
Was it TwitchCon

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.120
Or was it FanExpo

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.120
I don't even fucking remember

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.120
Was it

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.120
Outbot? No

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.120
What?

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.120
I don't even know what convention it was

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.120
Yeah I broke my back in the

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.120
The Tumblr ball pit

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.120
Dashcon

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.120
That's what that's 100%

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.120
Alright chapter 7

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.120
Draco and I held our pale white hands

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.120
With black nail polish as we went upstairs

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.120
I was wearing red satanist sings

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.120
Not signs, sings

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.120
On my nails in red nail polish

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120
I don't know how you can wear red

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.120
Signs on your nails in red nail polish

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.120
But then it just like not show up

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.120
Emo Shibi? Yeah that's me

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.120
Fuck you

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.120
Emo

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.120
We dark over here

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.120
I waved to vampire

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.120
Dark misery was in his depressed eyes

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.120
I guess he was jealous of me

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.120
That I was going out with Draco

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.120
Anyway I went upstairs excited with Draco

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.120
We went to his room and locked the door

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120
Then we started Frenching passively

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.120
And we took off each other's clothes enthusiastically

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.120
He felt me up before I took off my top

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.120
Then I took off my black leather bra

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.120
That doesn't sound comfortable

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.120
And he took off his pants

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120
We went to the on the bed

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.120
And started making out naked

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.120
And then he put his boys thingy in mind

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.120
And we had sex

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.120
Oh Draco! Draco!

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.120
I screamed

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120
Well getting an hour

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.120
Ow I just hit my arm

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.120
Just getting an orgasm

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.120
When all of a sudden I saw a tattoo

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.120
I had never seen before in Draco's arm

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120
It was a black heart with an arrow through it

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.120
On it and bloody gothic writing were the words

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.120
Vampire?

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.120
I was so angry

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.120
You bastard!

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.120
I shouted angrily

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.120
Jumping out of the bed

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.120
No no you don't understand

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.120
Draco pleaded

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120
But I knew too much

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.120
No you fucking idiot I shouted

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.120
You probably have AIDS anyway

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.120
I put on my clothes all huffily

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.120
And then stomped out

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.120
Draco ran out even though he was naked

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.120
Had he had a really big you know what

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.120
But I was too mad to care

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.120
I stomped out and did so

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.120
Until I was in Vampire's classroom

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.120
Draco was having a lesion with Professor Snape

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120
And some other people

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.120
Vampire Potter you motherfucker

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120
I yelled

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.120
Hold on

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120
I'll tell you

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.120
When was my immortal

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.120
Written

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.120
It was

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.120
Published in serial installments

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.120
On fanfiction.net

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.120
Between 2006 and 2007

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.120
Holy crap

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120
You think they'd be careful with anything blood to blood

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.120
Because they're off their second blood

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.120
They're vampires so I don't even

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.120
I don't think they would even apply to them

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120
Ffff

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.120
I should read a Twilight fanfiction

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.120
The fact that 50 shades was a first at Twilight Fiction

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.120
It always throws me off

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.120
Damnit fucking Eric

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.120
Fuck you

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.120

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:24.260
Her real parents are vampires, and one of them is a witch, but Voldemort killed her mother and her father, committed suicide because he was depressed about it.

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.260
She still has nightmares about it, she's very haunted and depressed.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:30.260
It also turns out her real last name is Smith, the knockranger.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:35.260
Since she has converted to Satanism, she is in slithering now, knockriffin door.

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:41.260
What is it that you desire, you ridiculous dimwit?

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:45.260
Snaped demeaned angrily in his cold voice, but I ignored him.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.260
Vampire, I can't believe you cheated on me with Draco!

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.260
I shouted at him. Everyone gasped.

01:21:53.260 --> 01:22:00.260
Wait, but she's not dating vampire, so technically, I can't believe Draco cheated on me with you is what she should have said.

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:07.260
This is the least e-real, you would be surprised, just you wait what Snape gets up to.

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:11.260
Oh, it's gonna be a lot like class of 09.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.260
Spoiler alert.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.260
Um...

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:20.260
I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.260
What?

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.260
Wait, so...

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.260
Why did I... am I...

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:36.260
Oh, is this from Draco's perspective?

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.260
No.

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:47.260
Okay, I got sorry, I lost, I kinda lost the plot for a moment. I'm just gonna read it.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.260
I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:54.260
I had went out with vampire, I'm bi, so as Ebony.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.260
For a while, but then he broke my heart.

01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:00.260
He dumped me because he liked Brittany, a stupid preppy fucker.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:05.260
We were just good friends now, he had gone through horrible problems, and now he was gothic.

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:07.260
Haha, like I would hang out with a prep.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:12.260
But I'm not going out with Draco anymore.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:13.260
Says vampire.

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:16.260
Yeah, fucking right, fuck off you bastard.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:17.260
I screamed.

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:21.260
I ran out of the room and into the forbidden forest where I had lost my rarality.

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:29.260
My rarality, yep, rarality to Draco, and I started to bust into tears.

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:33.260
I'm not under the Draco still not wearing anything.

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:38.260
Yeah, what is this, the Bible?

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.260
Haha, this is my Bible.

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:46.260
I was so mad and sad, I couldn't believe Draco for cheating on me.

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:49.260
I began to cry, I cranced the tree when I did it with Draco.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.260
That's pretty hardcore.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.260
I'm trying to actually know exactly which tree that they did, you know what,

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:59.260
where he stuck his, you know what in her, you know what.

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:07.260
Then all of a sudden, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick.

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:11.260
He didn't have a nose, basically Voldemort in the movie.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.260
He was wearing all black but it was obvious he wasn't gothic.

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.260
It was Voldemort?

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:21.260
No, I shouted in a scared voice but then Voldemort shouted.

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.260
What voice, what voice for Voldemort?

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:31.260
Actually he has, he says vow a lot, so I might just give him a...

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.260
I might just give him a birch accent.

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.260
Imperius?

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.260
And I couldn't run away.

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.260
Croc shanks!

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:44.260
I shouted at him, Voldemort fell off of his broom and started to scream.

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:47.260
I felt bad for him even though I'm a sadist, so I stopped.

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:52.260
Abony, he yelled, vow must kill vampire potter.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:59.260
I thought about vampire in his sexy eyes and his gothic black hair and how his face looks just like Joel Madden.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:03.260
I remember that Draco had said I didn't understand so I thought,

01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:07.260
what if Draco went out with vampire before I went out with him and they broke up?

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.260
No, Voldemort!

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.260
I shouted back, Voldemort gave me a gun.

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:25.260
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.260
Voldemort gave me a gun.

01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:40.260
Voldemort gave me a gun.

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.260
No, please, I begged.

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:52.260
Thou must heal, if thou dost not, then I shall kill thy beloved Draco.

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.260
How did you know?

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.260
I asked in a surprised way.

01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:01.260
Voldemort got a dude yourself.

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.260
Look on his face.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.260
I have a telekinesis.

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.260
He answered cruelly.

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:14.260
And if you dost not kill vampire, then thou not know what will happen to Draco.

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.260
He shouted.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:17.260
Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.260
I was so scared, mad, I didn't know what to do.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.260
Suddenly Draco came into the woods.

01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.260
Draco, I said, hi!

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:27.260
Hi.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.260
He said back, but his face was all sad.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.260
He was wearing white foundation and messy eyeliner.

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.260
Kind of like a pentagram, get it?

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.260
Between gold, instead of a cross, it's a pentagram.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.260
So like a sort of a cross between, it's a pentagram.

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.260
It took me forever to figure that out the first time I ever read this.

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:45.260
Between Joel Madden and Jared Way.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.260
Are you okay?

01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.260
I asked.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:51.260
No, he answered.

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:55.260
I'm sorry, I got all mad at you, but I thought you cheated on me.

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:56.260
I expelled.

01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:00.260
I hope it's a teagle.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.260
That's okay.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.260
I'm sorry.

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.260
That's okay.

01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.260
He said all depressed.

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.260
And we went back to Hogwarts together, making out.

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.260
Alright, this is a toxic relationship.

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:23.260
Chapter 10.

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.260
It's a lot of making out, yeah.

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:36.260
I was really scared about Vlad and Mort all day.

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:37.260
I was even upset.

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:42.260
Went to rehearsals with my gothic metal band Bloody Gothic Rose 666.

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:44.260
I'm the lead singer of it and I play a guitar.

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:48.260
People say that we sound like a cross between GC, Slipknot and MCR.

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:53.260
The other people in the band are Bloody Mary, Vampire, Draco, Ron.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.260
Although we call him Diabolo now.

01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:00.260
He is black hair now with blue streaks in it.

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:02.260
And Hagrid.

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.260
This is a loaded band.

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:09.260
Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed.

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.260
So they weren't coming and we wrote songs instead.

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.260
I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists.

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:18.260
He wouldn't die because he was a vampire too.

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:22.260
And the only way you can kill a vampire is with a C-R-O-S-S.

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:24.260
There's no way I'm writing that.

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.260
Or a steak like the food.

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.260
Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:39.260
I put on a black leather shirt that showed off my boobs in a tiny matching mini skirt that said simple plan on the butt.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:42.260
You might think I'm a slut, but I'm really not.

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:49.260
Hagrid kind of gives grimmer vibes being in this band.

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:52.260
So he's like the chaperone, he's hanging out.

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:59.260
We were singing in cover of Helena and at the end of the song I suddenly bust into tears.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.260
What voice did I give her?

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.260
What voice did I give Bloody Mary?

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:11.260
What voice did I give Hermione?

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:12.260
Oh no, I never gave her a voice.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.260
I also gave her a normal British girl voice.

01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:17.260
Ebony, are you okay?

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.260
Ebony?

01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:21.260
Ebony, are you okay?

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:23.260
Ebony, are you okay?

01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.260
Bloody Mary asked in a concerted voice.

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.260
What the fuck do you think? I asked angrily.

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:33.260
And then I said, well Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry.

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.260
But I don't want to kill him because he's really nice.

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:40.260
And even if he did go with Draco, but if I don't kill Harry, then Voldemort will fucking kill Draco.

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:42.260
I burst into tears.

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:44.260
Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind the wall.

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:47.260
Why didn't you fucking tell me?

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.260
He shouted.

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.260
How?

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:53.260
How could you fucking poser muggle bitch?

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.260
Jesus fuck.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.260
He just called me a slur.

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.260
I started to cry and cry.

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.260
Draco cried too all sensitive.

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:04.260
Then he ran out crying.

01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:06.260
We practiced for it.

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:09.260
See, like, whoa, chill with the M word.

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.260
I know, that was, I'm so sorry I said that.

01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.260
That was, that was a hard M.

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:17.260
That was a hard, I, I feel really awful to say that.

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.260
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:23.260
Especially when you add like bitch after it.

01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:25.260
Or like really just does it.

01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.260
Oh yeah, I still have the gun in my hand.

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:30.260
Let me just put that away real quick.

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.260
Remember the gun is still on my person.

01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.260
Practiced for a more hour.

01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:39.260
Then suddenly Dumbledore walked in angrily.

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.260
His eyes were all fiery and I knew that this time it wasn't because he had a headache.

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:49.260
Cowboy voice, let me think.

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.260
What have you done?

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.260
He started to cry wisely.

01:30:56.260 --> 01:31:01.260
See, that's basically not swearing and this time he was really upset and you will see why.

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:02.260
Ebony.

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:04.260
Draco has been found in his room.

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.260
He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:13.260
You guys think I'm gonna get monetized?

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.260
Wait hold on, let me check my email.

01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:22.260
Clearly I was trying to get monetized.

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.260
Yeah, I'm thinking not.

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.260
What?

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:47.260
Still says in progress.

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:49.260
Shout out to the person that got me a fidget toy.

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.260
You are amazing.

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:54.260
Hold on, I just realized.

01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:00.260
Don't have my headphones on to see donuts again.

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.260
Let me see if anybody...

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:11.260
Harim, remember to buy your heat suppressors.

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.260
Thank you, Anonymous, for that tip.

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:17.260
Thank you for the tip and the other tip.

01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:21.260
She's autistic?

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.260
Don't worry, don't read ahead.

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.260
Don't read ahead.

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.260
Stop.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.260
It's still in progress.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:36.260
I wonder if any of the other girls got monetization yet?

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.260
I don't know.

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:11.260
I got out of the bathtub and I put on a black low cut dress with lace all over it sandly.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:16.260
I put on black heels with pink metal stuff on the ends and six pairs of skull earrings.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.260
I got more piercings, guys.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.260
I couldn't fucking believe it.

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.260
Then I looked out the window and screamed.

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:29.260
Snap was spying on me and he was taking a videotape of me and Lupin was masticating to it.

01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:31.260
They were sitting on their broomsticks.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.260
Ew, you fucking perv, stop looking at me naked.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.260
Are you paddles or what?

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:39.260
I screamed putting on a black towel with a picture of Marilyn Manson on it.

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.260
Suddenly a vampire ran in.

01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:46.260
Abracadabra!

01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.260
He yelled, holy crap.

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.260
There was a giant SB that just flew into my window.

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.260
He was just eating, he was eating.

01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:00.260
He yelled at Snape and Lupin pointing his womb.

01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.260
I took my gun.

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:03.260
Hold on.

01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:08.260
I took my gun.

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.260
And I, what did I do?

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:22.260
And I shot Snape and Lupin a gazillion times.

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:28.260
They both started screaming and the camera broke.

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.260
Suddenly Dumbledore ran in.

01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:32.260
Ebony.

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:34.260
It has been revealed that someone has.

01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:36.260
No!

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:40.260
He shouted looking at Snape and Lupin and then he waved his wand and suddenly

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:44.260
Hargrid ran outside on his broom and said everyone we need to talk.

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.260
What do you know Hargrid?

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.260
You're just a little Hogwarts student.

01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:51.260
I don't know who is speaking.

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:54.260
What's had a Cagrin's voice?

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.260
I might be a Hogwarts student.

01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:59.260
But I'm also a scientist.

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.260
This cannot be.

01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:04.260
Snape said in a crisp voice.

01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.260
As blood dripped from his hand where Dumbledore's wand had shot him.

01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:10.260
There must be other factors.

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:12.260
There must be other factors.

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.260
You don't have any.

01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.260
I yelled in madly.

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:19.260
Lupin held up the camera.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.260
Try um-fall-element.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.260
Try um-fall-element.

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:25.260
Try um-elephantly.

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.260
The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:31.260
I'm just going to give him normal voice.

01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.260
Oh wait.

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:34.260
The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:37.260
A little like a creepy family guy.

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.260
Hagrid is Emmy?

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.260
No.

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:43.260
He's not going to be cute and funny.

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:52.260
I'm maybe a Hogwarts student.

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:54.260
Hagrid pause angrily.

01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.260
But I'm also a scientist.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.260
Okay fine.

01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:59.260
Fine fine.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.260
Hagrid can be cute and funny.

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.260
You want to vote? Okay.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:08.260
Hagrid voice.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.260
Brixton.

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.260
Or cute and funny.

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.260
I've got to be homophobic.

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.260
My bitch is gay.

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:29.260
Scott?

01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:30.260
I actually-

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.260
Maybe I'll do Scott to someone else.

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.260
Hagrid is Tony.

01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:37.260
I may be a Hogwarts student.

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:39.260
But I'm also a Satanist.

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.260
Because, because.

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.260
I may be a Hogwarts student.

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:47.260
But I'm also a Satanist.

01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:50.260
I'm not the cute and funny voice.

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:51.260
Okay.

01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:53.260
Cute and funny it is.

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:58.260
Because like they did it.

01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.260
They always-

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:02.260
When girls wrote fanfics they'd always

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:04.260
tell and not show.

01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:06.260
Like because it's like it's like a-

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:08.260
kind of a key factor of

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:10.260
writing as you can

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.260
kind of show

01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.260
what you can do.

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:16.260
Writing as you can

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.260
kind of show what they're wearing with how

01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.260
like the dialogue flows

01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:22.260
or like how they interact with their environment.

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.260
But when you're younger you just

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:26.260
say it, you just tell.

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:28.260
I was wearing this, this and this instead of like

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.260
I looked over at

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.260
um, Draco.

01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:36.260
My

01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:38.260
cross necklace making a distinct

01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:40.260
jingling sound.

01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.260
I can't believe you fucking done this.

01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:47.260
I don't know.

01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:49.260
I had pretty good fanfics.

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.260
Too bad they're like, they were all lost

01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.260
when they accidentally nuked my computer.

01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:56.260
I'm very sad about that.

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.260
I like cried for days.

01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:01.260
Because then I would 100% read them for you guys.

01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:11.260
What was that?

01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.260
The lens might be ruined

01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:16.260
but the tape is still there.

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:18.260
The lens might be ruined

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.260
but the tape is still there.

01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:22.260
The lens might be ruined

01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.260
but the tape is still there.

01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:26.260
I can do the whistle.

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.260
Why are you doing this?

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.260
Lupin said angrily while he rubbed his dirty hands

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.260
on his cloak.

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.260
Hope it's his cloak.

01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:38.260
And then I heard the words I had heard before

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:40.260
but not from him.

01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.260
I did not know whether it feels

01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.260
shocker and happy or to bite him

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:46.260
and drink his blood cause I felt faint.

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:48.260
Because, because.

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.260
Hargid said and he paused

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.260
in the air dramatically,

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.260
waving his wand in the air.

01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.260
Then swooped in he and singing

01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:59.260
to the tune of a gothic version of a song

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.260
by 50 cent.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:03.260
Because you are gothic.

01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:05.260
Snap asked a little afraid voice

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:07.260
because he was a friend.

01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.260
It meant he was connected with Satan.

01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:12.260
Because I love her.

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:14.260
Whoa.

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:16.260
Hargid.

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:18.260
You're like

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.260
like 60 years old.

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.260
I think he's like actually a student

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.260
in this iteration.

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.260
Like he's like actually like he's like also a teenager.

01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:32.260
Yeah, stop say

01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.260
okay Hargid is a pedo too.

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.260
A lot of American schools like I wanted to address

01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:38.260
that issue.

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.260
Oh.

01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.260
Nope, he's an adult in this author's note.

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.260
Never mind.

01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:47.260
I was about to slit my wrist again

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.260
with the silver knife that Drago

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.260
had given me in case if anything happened to him.

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:53.260
He had told me to use it valiantly against an enemy

01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:55.260
but I knew we must both go together.

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.260
No! Sorry, I'm reading ahead.

01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:03.260
I thought it was Hargid, but it was Vampire.

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:05.260
He started to scream

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.260
Oh my fucking good, no.

01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.260
My scar hurts.

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:12.260
And then his eyes rolled up.

01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:14.260
You could only see his red whites.

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:16.260
I stopped.

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:18.260
How did you know?

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:20.260
I saw it and my scar turned back

01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:22.260
into the lightning ball.

01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:24.260
No, I ran it closer.

01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:26.260
I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.260
I shouted.

01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.260
I do, but the Ebola

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.260
changed it into a pentagram for me

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:35.260
and I always covered up with foundation.

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:37.260
I'm losing the goofy voice.

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:40.260
Anyway, my scar hurt

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.260
and it turned back into the lightning ball.

01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.260
Save me!

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.260
Wake me up, wake me up inside.

01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.260
Save me.

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:55.260
Call my name and save me from the dawn.

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:57.260
So this is Class of O9.

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.260
This is Gothic Class of O9.

01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:04.260
Honestly, I would love to ask the author

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.260
of Class of O9 if they got any inspiration

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.260
from my immortal.

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.260
It's my favorite cover.

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:18.260
I do not know what

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:20.260
Kayoko means.

01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:23.260
What does that mean?

01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:25.260
Sorry, I still have a gun.

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.260
Let me put the gun away.

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:32.260
I don't mean to be threatening you

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:34.260
so diligently with my gun.

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.260
I always covered up with foundation,

01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:44.260
he said back.

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.260
Anyway, my scar hurt back.

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:48.260
Then I had a vision of what was happening to Draco.

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:50.260
Ellipses, ellipses, ellipses.

01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.260
Wolfamort has him bondage!

01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:58.260
Anyway, I was in the school nurse's office

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:00.260
now recovering from my slit wrist.

01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:02.260
Snapp and Lupin and Harrid

01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:04.260
were there too.

01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.260
They were going to St. Mango's

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.260
after they were recovered

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:10.260
because they were pedophiles.

01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:12.260
You can't have those pervs teaching in a school

01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:14.260
with a lot of hot girls.

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:16.260
Dumbledore had constipated the city-o camera

01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:18.260
and they took of me naked.

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.260
I put up my middle finger up at them.

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.260
Anyway, Hargard came into my hospital bed.

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:26.260
He came into the bed holding a bouquet of pink roses.

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.260
He said it in a very serious voice.

01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:36.260
Giving me the roses.

01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:38.260
Fuck off, I told him.

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:40.260
You know I fucking hate the color pink anyways.

01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:42.260
Although she has a lot of pink stuff so...

01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:44.260
I don't like the fucked up.

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:46.260
I don't like fucked up preps like you.

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.260
I snapped.

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:50.260
Hargard had been mean to me before for being gothic.

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:54.260
Hargard says.

01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:58.260
What? Are they goffs too?

01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:00.260
Do you pose their prep?

01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:02.260
I asked because I was angry that you bought me pink roses.

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.260
I saved your life.

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.260
He yelled angrily.

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.260
No you didn't. I replied.

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:10.260
You saved me from getting a Paris Hilton pee video

01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.260
made from your shower scene and being viewed

01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:14.260
by Snap and Lupin.

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.260
Who masturbated.

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:18.260
Whatever.

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.260
Oh, he added. Who masturbated.

01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:24.260
To it he added sign Lee.

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:26.260
Whatever. He yelled angrily.

01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:28.260
He pointed his wand at the pink roses.

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:30.260
These aren't roses.

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:32.260
He suddenly looked at them with an evil look in his eye

01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:34.260
and muttered.

01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.260
Well, if you want honesty, that's all you had to say.

01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.260
That's not a spell. It's an MCR song.

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:42.260
I corrected him wisely.

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:44.260
I know. I was just warming up my vocal chords.

01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:48.260
And he screamed.

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.260
That's not a spell I can't make!

01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.260
I don't know.

01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:02.260
What the fuck is she saying?

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:04.260
What the fuck is Hagrid saying?

01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:06.260
And then the roses turned into a huge black flame

01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:08.260
floating in the middle of the air.

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.260
And it was black.

01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:12.260
Did I mention it was black?

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:14.260
No, I knew he wasn't a prep.

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:16.260
Okay, I believe you know what the fuck is Draco.

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.260
What the hell is Hagrid's mean spin facts?

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.260
I don't know about you.

01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.260
What a voice, my beloved.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.260
I have found myself okay, you mean old man.

01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.260
Anyway, when I got better, I went upstairs

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.260
and put on black leather mini-dress

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:18.260
that was all ripped on the ends with lace on it.

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.260
There was some corset stuff on the front.

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:22.260
Then I put on black fishnets

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.260
and black high heeled boots

01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:26.260
with pictures of Billy Joel all strong.

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:28.260
I put my hair all out around me

01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:30.260
so it looked like Samara from the ring.

01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:34.260
Like that girl in the club

01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:36.260
in a vampire in the masquerade.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.260
If you don't know who she is, you're a prep, so fuck off!

01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:42.260
And I put on a blood red lipstick,

01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.260
black eyeliner, black lip gloss.

01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:48.260
You look kawaii, girl.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.260
What?

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:56.260
Sorry, my head's flying away.

01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:02.260
Sorry, you look kawaii.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.260
Not kawaii, kawaii.

01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:06.260
You look kawaii, girl.

01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:08.260
I can't even do a birth accident for her.

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:12.260
Sorry.

01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:14.260
You look kawaii, girl.

01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:16.260
Bloody Mary said sadly.

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:18.260
Fangs.

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:20.260
Get it? You did too.

01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:22.260
I said sadly too, but I was still upset.

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:24.260
I slipped off my wrist feeling totally depressed

01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:26.260
and I sucked out on the blood.

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:28.260
I cried again in my bathroom

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.260
and put on the shades on so snap and loop

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.260
and couldn't spy on me this time.

01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:34.260
I went to some classes.

01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:36.260
Vampire was in the hair of magical, magic creatures.

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.260
He looked all depressed because Draco disappeared.

01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:40.260
He had used to be in love with Draco.

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:42.260
He was sucking some blood from a hufflepuff.

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:46.260
Hoi.

01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:48.260
He said in a depressed way.

01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:50.260
Hoi back.

01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:52.260
I said in an equal wakali said way.

01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:56.260
We both looked at each other for some time.

01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:58.260
Harry had beautiful red gothic eyes

01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.260
so much like Draco's

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:02.260
because they were in the same fucking contacts.

01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:04.260
Then we jumped at each other

01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.260
and started screwing each other.

01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:08.260
Stop it now, you horny simpletons!

01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:12.260
I shouted at Professor McGoggle

01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:14.260
who was watching us and so was everyone else.

01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.260
Vampire you fucker!

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.260
I said slapping him.

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:20.260
Stop trying to screw me.

01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:22.260
You know I love Draco.

01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:24.260
I shouted and ran away angrily.

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.260
Just then he started to scream.

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.260
Oh my fucking god no!

01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:30.260
My scar hurt!

01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:32.260
And then his eyes rolled up.

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:34.260
You could only see his red whites.

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.260
No!

01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:38.260
I ran up closer.

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:40.260
I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.

01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:42.260
We already went over this before.

01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:44.260
Pace.

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:46.260
Okay. Anyways.

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:48.260
We know that, yep.

01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:00.260
The hex is a red white.

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:02.260
I think the whites of the eyes where you can see the veins

01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:04.260
I don't get it.

01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:06.260
I try to roll my eyes back as if you guys could see.

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:08.260
I try to roll my eyes across the head.

01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.260
What scar?

01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:20.260
Is making me lose IQ?

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:22.260
As it should.

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.260
Red Sleras

01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.260
I highly doubt that's what she wanted to say.

01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:28.260
Sleras, Sleras.

01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:32.260
Vampire and I ran up the stairs looking for Dumbledore and we were so scared.

01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:34.260
We were so scared.

01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:36.260
Dumbly door! Dumbly door!

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:38.260
Dumbly door!

01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.260
We both yelled. Dumbledore came there.

01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:44.260
What is it that you want now you despicable snobs?

01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:46.260
He asked angrily.

01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:48.260
Voldemort has Draco!

01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.260
We shout at the same time.

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.260
He laughed in evil voice.

01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.260
No, don't. We need to save Draco.

01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:02.260
We begged.

01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.260
No, he said meanly.

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.260
I don't give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco.

01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:10.260
Not after how much he misbehaved in school, especially with you, Ebony.

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:12.260
He said while he frowned looking at me.

01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:16.260
Besides, I ain't never liked him that much anyway.

01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:18.260
Then he walked away.

01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:20.260
Emperor started crying.

01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:22.260
My Draco!

01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:24.260
He moaned.

01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:28.260
Author's note, don't you think

01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:30.260
fake gay guys are like so hot?

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:34.260
It's okay.

01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.260
I tried to tell him, but that didn't stop him.

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:38.260
He started to cry tears of blood. Then he had a brainstorm.

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:40.260
Like how did I do?

01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.260
He exclaimed.

01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:44.260
What? I asked him.

01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:46.260
You don't see.

01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:48.260
He said. He took out his wand and did a spell.

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.260
Then suddenly, we were in Voldemort's lair.

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:52.260
We ran with our wands out as we heard a crooned voice say.

01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.260
How were.

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:56.260
How were.

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.260
Hela Godavra

01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:06.260
insha Allah.

01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:08.260
It was Voldemort.

01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:16.260
Sorry, Eric. Fuck you.

01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:20.260
Warning, some of this chapter is extremely

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000
She's a vampire. She can't die. She just drinks her own blood. I don't understand it. Though...

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Can vampires bleed? Well, you know, true blood. I can't remember in the twilight. Can they bleed?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:23.000
And Obi, I love you, he shouted sadly. I do not care what those fucker-preps and losers think.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000
You're the most beautiful girl in the world. Before I met you, I wanted to commit suicide all the time.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Now, I just want to fucking be with you. I fucking love you.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Then, he started to sing The Chronicles of Life and Death. We concerted our song now because we fell in love with Joel singing it.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Right in front of the entire class. His singing voice was so amazing and gothic and sexy.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000
The cross between Gerard, Joel. Oh, she's a cross. She didn't say a pentagram.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Tester, Pierre, and Marilyn Manson.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I'll just note, don't do your fingers, guys. They're so hot. If you don't know who they are, then get the fuck out of here.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
This is my last resort. He cut my life into pieces, indeed.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Oh, my fucking god. I said after he was finished. Some fucking prep stared at us.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000
But I just stuck on my middle fingers that I've recovered in a black nail polish and we're in twine with Draco's now at them.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I love you, I said. And then we started to kiss, just like Hilary Duff. I fucking hate that bitch.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
And CMM and a Cinderella story. Oh, yeah, I remember that.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Then we went away holding hands. Lupin shouted at us, but he stopped because everyone was clapping by how sexy we looked together.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Then I saw a poster saying that MCR would have a concert in Hogsmeade right then.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Just teleported and now there's a concert.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
We looked at each other all shocked and then we went together.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
To be continued.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
There's 44 chapters of this. It gets even better.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Handholding. Disgusting.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Anyways, as long as the tip of the iceberg, ladies and gentlemen.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
MCR is a wizard band? Of course they are.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
What do you guys think? Oh, yeah, sorry, the gun's over.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
You love me, right? You like me a lot?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
My god, is it finally over?

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Yes it is.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Did we already do a part of Sonic High School? I did not read Sonic High School, no?

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Because I couldn't remember the name of it.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I couldn't remember that someone suggested a Sonic thing. I can't remember what it was called though.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Excuse me.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
I could definitely always do that one again.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Well, not again. I can always read that one.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
You loved it? You like the dramatic reading?

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Because I'm gothic. Get it?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Thanks. What the fuck am I sitting on?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Ow.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000
You know, cats will shed their claws a little bit.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I just sat on the claw.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Stabbing my booty.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Cutest dramatic reading. Thank you.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Glad you enjoyed.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Let me know. I'll probably make a poll on Twitter if you guys want me to continue.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
When you call him Madam Shibinia Papp.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Wait, hold on. I need that.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Screenshot material.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
For all your meme needs.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Hold on. Let me put the gun up higher.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
My hand.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Did you like emo goth Shibi? Did you like my immortal?

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Because I have a blonde streak and blonde streaks in my hair, you think I'm a fake?

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
You're a fucking poser, bro. Back off.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Maybe I made a lot more fun.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I dressed like a relay man.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I did actually have a hoodie like this except I had cat ears on the top.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And the cat ears could stretch over like the hood could go over your face.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
It was like a cat mask and it came with like a little cat paws.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
And it was hot pink and black.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
It was great.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
You can probably find a picture of it now that I think of it.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
The Suprem is nice to...

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Well, this is from Booth. I'll probably put credit so that the model in the description.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I'm debating whether or not to end stream or play Call of the Lamb.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I might just end stream because I should probably like do my dishes and shit.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Probably wear Ahigaya clothing if we could.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Well, I did get a face mask that...

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
You speaking is true.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
I fucking hate that dog, man.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So I'm like more loud than I am.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
He naps more than me.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
This dog is trying to call for Satan to come get him.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Yeah, maybe I'll do a girl later if I'm...

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Holy crap.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Guys, that's not my dog. It's a dog outside of my apartment right now.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
There's walking by and the dog is screaming.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I don't even know what the fuck he's barking at.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
He's just walking with his mom and dad. I think I hear their voices.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
It has to be a puppy, although I think there's like a Pomeranian.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
And it might be that Pomeranian.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I don't know.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000
But the dog is annoying because it'll bark at all hours of the day.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Spontaneous interview.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Yeah, it's actually like someone a demon with a reading fanfic.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Yeah, well, is...

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Is Emmy streaming today?

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Okay, I remember.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Yeah, I see that it finished our ASMR stream.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Strawny is currently playing Skyrim.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
So that means you guys wouldn't have anybody till...

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Till Azura.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Oh yeah, because she... I remember she was saying she has piano lessons and stuff.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Oh, and Azura is not on.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I know, I realized that when I started streaming that I didn't...

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I didn't post it on YouTube.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Again, I suck at doing YouTube stuff.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Okay, so do you get...

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
I guess I'll keep streaming then because then it's just...

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
It's just mercy.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
At 11.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.000
It'll be a large gap of, you know, cute girls.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
So I'll be glad to fill that gap.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Fill that gap.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I guess I'll play a little bit of Call of the Lamb.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Fill the what?

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
The what?

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I'm gonna...

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I'm gonna end stream, but then start it again.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
It's just I'm gonna start a separate stream.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Actually, I'm just gonna set up that right now while I'm talking to you guys.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
None of them, because I would never harm an animal.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
I'm gonna start a separate stream.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
None of them, because I would never harm an animal.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I'm gonna stay in my dull hand form.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Where?

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Yeah, I'll just call it a lamb.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Yeah, I'm saving the vlog.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Don't you worry.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Don't you worry.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
You're a pretty little head.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I'm gonna end stream, then I'm just gonna start again.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
And just so people can be like,

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
wait, there was van-fiction reading,

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
and then they're like, just so it's not confusing.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
And Estrani did that for her 2.0

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
and the exposing be a little other thing.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
And I've done that in the past myself.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Schedule stream.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Schedule stream.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Onput.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
607.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Call order name.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Can I put poop in my thumbnail?

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Guys, stop pooping everywhere for the love of God.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Is that allowed?

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Not my thumbnail.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
My cult of the emo.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
She'll be watching my course.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000
I'm gonna stream call the lamb as Shibony.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.000
It's fine.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
It's fine.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Gorilla cult of the lamb.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Let's try to beat the third boss.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Oh my God.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Sometimes graphics artist gives me the thumbnails,

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
but they're like the wrong size

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
and I don't have to keep compressing them.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I'm actually gonna edit that real quick.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.000
All right, I'll be right back.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I'll see you guys.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Probably I'll say 6.15.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Bye.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Give me one second.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Public 6.15.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Cool.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Public 6.15.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
All right, later nerds.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Somebody fucking hung up.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Public 6.15.
