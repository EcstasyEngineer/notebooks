1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:55,580
Do you hear that do you hear that it's fucking nothing

7
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,180
Wait, I should have done this one. Um, does that sound better?

8
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,860
Does that sound better the the um?

9
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,020
The microphone I fixed it. I fixed it

10
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,860
Hello

11
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,140
I literally just spilled water on myself, and I'm not even like joking and like trying to be cheeky or whatever

12
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,620
I literally I just noticed I didn't close

13
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,460
Oh, I just squirted at me. Um, my little water thing

14
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,900
So I'm soaking wet sounds like I'm underwater. No

15
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,500
It's only I'm gonna keep I don't believe any of you hold on

16
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,660
Hi kitty, what are you doing? I literally

17
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,500
Work so hard to fix this and you're telling me

18
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,860
Oh no, oh my god

19
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,340
Okay, I think there was like a filter on and I don't know why it did that

20
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,460
No, there's no AC shoes

21
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,380
Wait, no, you can hear I literally I was

22
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,140
Messing around for an hour

23
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:46,460
With my microphone trying to fix it. So if you're telling me you can still hear my AC. I'm gonna cry

24
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
I'm literally

25
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Where's my crying tag?

26
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
Gonna cry

27
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
AC is the main care. No

28
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,380
No, hold on. I don't believe you. Are you guys lying to me? I'm gonna listen to myself for a second

29
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,580
Hello myself, can I talk? Oh

30
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,580
Oh

31
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,140
My headphones are on. Oh

32
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Gosh

33
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,780
You can hear it you guys are liars bitches bitches

34
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Bitches

35
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,660
Stop memeing me stop it be nice. I'm gonna

36
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,460
Oh

37
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,460
Shit fuck where I messed something up. No, that's not what I meant to do

38
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
There it is I

39
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,100
Need to change the toggle for this because it makes my whole entire YouTube full screen

40
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Oh

41
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Sounds perfect

42
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
It's still there

43
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
Okay, no, you know what we're serious

44
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
you guys

45
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,700
Don't forget just because I'm a goofy girl failure as some of you like to affectionately call me doesn't mean I

46
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,340
Won't wrap my legs around your head

47
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,180
And squeeze you tightly until your neck pops like a Barbie doll

48
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,220
Hmm, I promise it's not a no. Yeah, it's not a threat. It's a promise

49
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:51,900
Have any in at all today it's 4 p.m. You know, we're just I'm gonna have a little bit of girl dinner a little bit of early girl dinner

50
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Um

51
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
So mom

52
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,740
Go-go squeeze apple cinnamon applesauce

53
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Don't eat a cookie. I know

54
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Can you believe Azura's?

55
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,380
ASMR got taken down when she was way more in tamer than me or

56
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,860
Or in me and honestly, I feel like she was just as tame as Mercy and Mercy's is still up

57
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,100
Thank God. Mine's gone to the ether aka. It's been privated

58
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,980
I'm like tempted to like let's put on private it for like a minute

59
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,020
Oh

60
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Mmm

61
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Yeah, I'm actually the only one that made it out alive

62
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,740
That's because I can't help myself and tease you guys. I

63
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,700
Also, just like I personally really like

64
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
mouth sounds

65
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,560
And it is just really annoying

66
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,940
But I'm like I can't even do like mouth sounds or kisses or belated numb numb numb numb

67
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,660
It's trying to you nice. I'm are they I don't know. I haven't looked at her schedules. I

68
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,900
Haven't looked at her. We have a little schedule thing. I have to I haven't looked at it. I

69
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,180
Know that strong. He's playing like avatar

70
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,980
At first when I started on the schedule, I'm like, oh like the last airbender, but no James

71
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,140
I

72
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,980
But yeah, I can't on private the vaude because I will get got

73
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,060
because in me got got and

74
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,180
Azura got got

75
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,140
Honestly, it's only a matter of time before Mercy gets got

76
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
So it is what it is

77
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,220
But you know, um, I know that some people are trying to find a way to put together

78
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,260
Like some sort of archiving system if that does happen, I will

79
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Definitely pass that along to you guys or whatever if that's allowed. I don't know manager

80
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:05,580
Will you do I'm not safe for work non-live on your channel. Well, this is is it's not safe for work. I know I'm like

81
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:13,340
Big boob duh, but like I'm I'm safe for work. Oh, do you mean like a video video?

82
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:20,300
Um, I do have like although I know strong. He's worried that I might get taken down or something

83
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Um, I have like a really cute

84
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,380
like snuggle with me audio and then like a meme audio and

85
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,780
So I don't but I don't know if it'll work

86
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,940
Like I don't know if like because YouTube's really cracking down on any sort of mouth sounds

87
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,420
And how the algorithm works an algorithm just the bots work right now is that they're combing through the newest videos

88
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,900
So that's why you'll like see like people with like millions of views

89
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Have like the most foul

90
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,180
ASMR videos, but they're like from like a year ago or so or like a couple months ago

91
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,260
The it's not you it the bots aren't prioritizing the old ones are prioritizing the new stuff. So

92
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,180
Yeah, oh, I just smack my microphone. Sorry

93
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,620
Because I'm gesturing. I need a 3d model so bad. I'm moving around

94
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:20,300
Um, but yeah in the JP side. Yes, the JP side has been and I also think that's because the bots don't really know how to

95
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,820
Deal with England deal with English the bull they don't but like handle like Japanese and stuff

96
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,380
It's the Mackis again by big girl. Oh

97
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
You're so bad

98
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,300
But um, yeah, so that's why we're getting kind of like

99
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,660
Tart and also like people are gonna report us because you know, we're a company that

100
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,980
Although we do safer work on our YouTube channels. They will you know report us. It is what it is

101
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,220
We knew what we were getting into. Oh

102
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,380
That she be calm bum

103
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,220
Pots need to let go

104
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,580
Like I looked up here looking videos and some of them are not yet up and not taken down like the bigger youtuber

105
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:11,020
Yeah, exactly and it's like another thing like people like oh my god, you guys are getting cold so bad

106
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,820
It's because we're very new that the bots look at our channel and they're like, okay

107
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
They don't watch a lot of videos

108
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,620
They don't comment too too much they must be a bot so we're gonna remove some followers

109
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,860
We're gonna and that's what so they've just kind of been

110
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,060
Nuking our stuff and like we probably be over 5k by now

111
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
But I feel like when we get monetization

112
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,060
Which is a very phone. We haven't like

113
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,540
Applied it yet. We're just making sure everything's good before then

114
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
but when

115
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,260
See I lose my train of thought cuz I'm I'm just a little

116
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,580
But when yeah, so it's just because of the algorithm the bots whatever it's I don't really think

117
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,300
Somebody is like at YouTube sitting at their desk and every time we get a hundred new followers taking away

118
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
And I also I don't think YouTube

119
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,180
Much likes

120
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,020
VTubers like twitch as well. So y'all y'all y'all she got that chibits is

121
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:26,860
Would you believe me if I told you I have not been diagnosed with autism or ADHD, I'm just a quirky gal

122
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:40,420
John YouTube hates youtubers. Yeah, and if um and I can't add any free stuff to my patreon because if it's 18 plus overall

123
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,180
It can't be

124
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,060
It has to be pay walled like 18 plus stuff has to be pay walled

125
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,040
See and I'm probably gonna try to figure out how to upload like

126
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Maybe I'll do like a Twitter

127
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,580
I'll ask management if I can make like a Twitter that I can upload the VODs to like um

128
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,820
Cut it in half because I know you can upload like two hours. I think to Twitter

129
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,020
So I'm like just in case

130
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,860
Like archive it

131
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,940
Maybe I don't know if it's not sure. I don't know anything about YouTube. I don't I'm sorry

132
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,180
It's only my my six day my six day out here. I don't know what I'm doing

133
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,420
But um

134
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,100
Yeah, fans late, maybe I don't know cuz I don't I don't know how fancy it works either

135
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,380
But yeah, I bet like where I know what we're looking to get more established on other platforms

136
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,180
There are more used and then we'll like I know like a hundred percent at one point want to play like the

137
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Hoony pop like with the

138
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,380
with the you know with the

139
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:58,180
Yeah, but yeah, who knows have a burner va channel, but that'd be like but that's a thing like if I made a burner va channel

140
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,140
It'll probably just get taken down, especially. Yeah, I just don't I feel like this wouldn't work

141
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,580
I will not touch Twitter even if you pay me unfortunately, but my archival is good archival. Okay

142
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,740
This guy hates Twitter. He hates zitter. What's who?

143
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,140
He doesn't know and he doesn't know whatever

144
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,900
The joke over his head. Um, but yeah, we're gonna play

145
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Hold on me eat some applesauce

146
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Wait, no mouth down

147
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,620
We have to play we have to play we're going to play

148
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,340
Class of 09 I've never played it before I've only watched the trailer in the animated thing which I thought was hilarious

149
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,340
I was laughing hysterically. Um

150
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,340
If you're someone who I'm just gonna say a little disclaimer if you're someone who is sensitive to like

151
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Darker humor and edgy humor and jokes. This might not be the video for you

152
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,180
because um, if you ever saw the anime trailer, there are some

153
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,540
What's that song pumped up kicks jokes

154
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,860
If you catch my drift, maybe pin a disclaimer, that's a good idea

155
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,340
Mm-hmm

156
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Let me just tippy-tappy type

157
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,580
Video game is edgy

158
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,580
If you don't like it go cry elsewhere

159
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Okay, thanks

160
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Also check out my merch

161
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,780
On the market shameless plug

162
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,460
Only 15 no what you you think I'm not done yet you think I'm not done yet

163
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Okay, I need a link

164
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,620
My stomach hurt I wonder why

165
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,820
Probably because I need to eat something I'm like

166
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,220
Craven cheeky tendies in the worst way. I saw our meme about cheeky tendies and I'm like

167
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Oh, I need me some cheeky tendies

168
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Okay, where is my

169
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:49,140
Hell yeah, brother, I don't even know how to pin something so this will be we'll see how this works

170
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Nobody talk

171
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,420
Okay, I did it because then I wouldn't be able to catch up to it

172
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,020
Oh shit, where did my not no not the viewer count

173
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,860
Oh

174
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,900
Oh, okay. So yeah, you guys voted that you guys want me to do the voices

175
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,780
So I'll do the voices we'll have a girl that kind of looks like me. She's very cute. She's blonde there

176
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
We actually have the same exact eye color

177
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,300
You know what I should have done. I should have like prepared

178
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,180
Something where I'm like I cosplay as her

179
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,140
It would have taken way too long to cut off my head from my body again though. That took me like an hour

180
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,180
I have to make my full model transparent for that

181
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Um, she looks like she might be like

182
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,700
Valley girl and the other girl who is like dark hair and blue eyes looks like she might be like, oh my god

183
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,740
I fucking hate it here. So she's probably be closer to my normal voice

184
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
Nicole jacka

185
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Jacka and Nicole

186
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,820
It's not it wasn't a technical difficulty how it works to use those little things

187
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,060
Except I did it wrong

188
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,620
Because I can't read Japanese or Chinese. Okay. Ni ha ma leave me alone. Um

189
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,420
So I have to you have to make her the whole so from the neck

190
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,260
Down I had to make my entire model transparent

191
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,100
Do you know how many layers are in a vtuber model guys?

192
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,940

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,060
There's a centipede tuber. Yeah, I'm scared of centipedes, uh, but I saw her model and I'm like, yo

260
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,220
That's pretty sick. I'd watch you just so I could conquer my fear of centipedes

261
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:11,540
Mom throw him to the lava girl. Oh boomie. You look so cute. I just turned to the side and he's eating in his bed

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,940
Because it's just fun to watch and so I end up like talking like that dude be like, oh

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,220
Boomie eating some cat food for today

267
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,380
But like I'm like, that's the goal right there. I just have a rescue ranch just like that

268
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
rescue wild animals

269
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,140
Definitely afraid of cockroaches. I'm actually I'm literally

270
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,500
Not afraid of bugs literally only

271
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,420
those house centipedes freaked me out like um, my parents are afraid of bugs

272
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,260
So when I lived at my parents house like my dad's like terrified of slugs

273
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,380
Although that's not really a bug, but anytime there was like a bug

274
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,060
I would have to get it and then my mom's like kill it kill it kill it and I'm just like

275
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,300
Takes this giant stick bug off the side of my house not knowing where it came from because

276
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:12,420
I don't think stick bugs are native to the area puts it on the another tree outside and my mom's just like

277
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,180
And then spiders I like spiders. I love spiders. Um during covid

278
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:26,900
During miss rona and her visit to everybody in the whole world. Um, I was my my niche interest was um

279
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,020
snake breeding and uh tarantulas

280
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,100
And so I would just watch a bunch of like tarantulas stuff. Oh roly poly isopods

281
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,780
I love me some isopods isopods are so cute, especially my favorite ones are the ducky ones

00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:57,140
Um, I love snakes. I love ball pythons. Uh, I like banana banana morphs. They're so cute or um

286
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,100

287
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,940
um

288
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,780
Jumping spiders. I had a little when I went to the store for the drunk stream

289
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,380
There's a massive, uh, I can't remember the latin name of it

290
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,300
It wasn't the the black jumping spider. It's the more brown one

291
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,740
And she was hanging on the side of my car when I was driving over and I'm like and I was tapping on the window

292
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,980
trying to get her attention when I was stationary, of course and um

293
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,020
I'm like ma'am ma'am. Please let me pick you up so I can put you uh

294
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,500
In a tree or like in these bushes or in this grass and she just wouldn't let me she wouldn't let me pick her up

295
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,540
So I'm like, all right. You're coming with me to the store. So she came to the store

296
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,340
And so she probably would never have traveled that far in her life. So I hope I didn't like

297
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,540
Ruin anything for her and there's also this family of jumping spiders that live on the side of my balcony

298
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,660
It's this big lady and her boyfriend that I'm surprised. She hasn't eaten yet or maybe he's just like hasn't

299
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,340
Gone up to her yet, but I was like watching her. Um

300
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,260
Eda

301
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,220
Eda, I think it was like a fly and I'm like, wow, that's so badass

302
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,860
You look so majestic and then this little tiny tiny boy

303
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,300
Tiny uh boy jumping spider came out. I was just like watching her

304
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,900
Oh, no

305
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
No, thank you

306
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,700
I had my desktop audio turned off

307
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,260
Dang it

308
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,300
Because then it messes stuff up because then it like double plays but the thing

309
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,020
I need to like make it. I don't know how to make it. So it's like a separate sound thing for

310
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,180
Alerts so it doesn't just play my desktop because I say

311
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
um

312
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
I'm something of a gamer myself

313
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:49,860
God damn you graduate in 2009. Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm old. I'm so old. No, I did not graduate in 2009

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,980
Jesus christ. I was I don't even remember how old I was

315
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,540
I was a beach. I

316
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
but like honestly

317
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,900
Like I used to be afraid of bugs and my mom got me this bug book

318
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,420
And I would just walk around with little magnifying glass and that like I was it really helps you conquer your fear

319
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:13,860
Um guys, I'm I did not graduate in 2009 for the love of god. No, I did not graduate that early

320
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,500
I I had still a ways to go very very more much more years

321
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,140
Um, I am not I am I I am a hag

322
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,220

323
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
theory

324
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,740
But that's just a theory a game theory more like 1909

325
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,700

Kitten versions of her cats on her uterus. So it looked like she was going to give birth to cats

464
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,620
Dairy contribute a lot to inflammation so

465
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,060
Is Jason born actually when you know what I can now I'm not gonna do that because the chat's not even bothered to be readable

00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,980
I'm gonna I'm gonna stick

492
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,300
To make this at least somewhat useful I'll stick the alerts

493
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,500
Wait, it's not letting me oh, whatever. I don't who cares just play the game just play the game gb

Oh shit

495
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
The cat

496
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:35,180
All right, um, let's see scene volume. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine

497
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,500
It's funny when a girl tells her story only to be told back that it's unrealistic

498
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,260
Almost as if they're afraid to believe it's real

499
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,540
He's fucking loud in my ears

500
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:58,220
For everyone who doesn't know my mom's a bitch my dad shot himself my life sucks and my brother's on a watch list

501
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
Ayo

502
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,460
Was that bad it was just really standard other girls saying their gym teacher wanted to bang them

503
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
Their counselor texting them at three in the morning

504
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,180
I was the only one with a white nationalist photography teacher though, so I guess that's something but here's the problem

505
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,660
Mom won't listen the principal doesn't care and I still have all of senior year to get through

506
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,940
My life's just a game a sick hopeless game

507
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,180
Like I've never really been I think I skipped the first game

508
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,740
How's it wait what I really hope they can help me through that. What do you mean?

509
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
This is a sequel

510
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,860
Fuck

511
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:06,540
No, I want to play the first one. I thought the re-up was like a redone version. Oh my god, do I have to buy the game?

512
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,820
I gotta log out and then I gotta buy them my other account and then I gotta

513
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I am alive

514
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,820
Same characters different stories

515
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,660
No, it would take it would be fine. Oh my god. I'm it

516
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
I hate it here

517
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,620
Okay, do you want me to go get the first game?

518
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,660
Or do you just want me to play this game?

519
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
I will

520
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,260
Because I do want to play the first game. Okay. I'm gonna hold on

521
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,780
I am the world's worst streamer. I really

522
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:13,420
Okay, I'm gonna be ventriloquist for just a split second

523
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,780
How could this happen to me?

524
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,820
Scuff cotton bum

525
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,260
No, no, no, no, I I thought I would have gotten the first one

526
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,900
I'm gonna play the first one because I wanted to play the first one

527
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,380
I thought it was the first one just like read. I thought the re-up was just like like they remastered it because I'm weird

528
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:52,300
Look back at this laugh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, why am I big? I'm trying to just scroll

529
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:59,580
Fastest girl boss a girl failure to

Add to cart who might caught continue to payment

531
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,860
Use this card ending in

532
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,780
I agree patches

533
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
Perfect

534
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,020
So, uh, how about them Dodgers?

535
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,540
How uh, how a fuck shit, where is it?

536

It didn't show up. I just bought it. Where'd it go?

537
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,820
How's that sports ball?

538
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,140
444 make a wish everybody, you know, right? Am I right? Am I wrong? I'm always wrong

539
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,900

540
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,820
Let's just let's just look at each other drake or Kendrick Kendrick drake can kiss my booty cheeks

541
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,100

It's nice weather. Oh, it was like, you know, the sprinkling a little bit. It's fine

546
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,660
I was asked I I was asking for rain though because I love the rain

547
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
I love the rain

548
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:14,700
I think I have to log out of my computer and log into

549
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,940
You

00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,060

555
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
for 10 days

556
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
We have been

557
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,860
Fucking your mother what?

558
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,380
Okay, you know what let's just play the re-up then because that's not working

559
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,460
We persevere

560
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,900
Why does it say I've played this for four hours?

561
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,900
Huh

562
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,460

00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,900
Oh, this rope is filthy. What are you doing with the climbing rope? Nothing just

00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,420

If I turn that off will they still talk?

570
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,860
Oh, you're the Girl Scouts. Yeah, we learned how to tie knots to go bats and shit not hang ourselves

571
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,140
We're just assuming a whole lot today, aren't we?

572
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:13,180
Hey, what's going on? Why is there a rope in here? She was just asking me how to tie a noose and like did you help her?

573
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,940

574
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,060
Yeah, no pick your favorite answer out of those

575
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,340

I didn't oh my god. I can't right now

577
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,300
What's her problem? What's your problem? We're not even two weeks back yet. You're trying to hang yourself the gem rope

578
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,580
Do you have no idea what I had a witness this morning?

579
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,780
The jeffrey kid was doing cartoon voices for mr. Bouldery and the guy does not I'm telling you to future in Hollywood

580
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,740

00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:53,500
This is going so fast. I have to like paw. Oh shit. Can I like change the speed?

582
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,780
Oh

00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:03,100
Oh, they don't so it is automatic. Okay. You know what? We're just gonna. I'm not voice acting. We're saving my voice

584
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:10,380
Oh, that's your motive for keeping me alive. Yeah, sure. No problem. So will I see you in science today about that?

585
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,140
Why don't you start me something else?

586
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,340
So will I see you in science today about that?

587
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,340
I like how it's a bottle of pills

588
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,580
Regardless of whatever you say. I'm not showing up to any class with jeffrey for the rest of the week

589
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:26,860
I exerted all that energy to keep you alive and you're still not to go. You can come with me if you want

590
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,100
Uh, I'm just balling the crap out of me after I graduate fine. Go to science and let jeffrey do elmo voice at you

591
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:40,140
Oh god, are you even going? Yeah, the video is great. The game's quiet. Okay. Yep. All right

592
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,220
Let's go to the mall

593
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,500
Why did we come here if we don't even know what we want to buy

594
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,300
Dude, we're literally in the mall. Just figure it out. Even if I do want something. It's just torture

595
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,620
I have like no money. Who said we're buying anything. Just steal the shit. Oh, okay

596
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,340
You think they have MSI stuff here. I'm sorry I mentioned

597
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,740
Yeah, they're all in my shuffle and they might be in town

598
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,100
I love it. She's me

599
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,100
No, I'm just surprised you like MSI because you're so

600
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,820
Normal

601
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,660
Oh

602
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:22,780
Never mind. Okay. So what do we get? I want a cd. I'm a self-indulgence great band. Why can't we steal both?

603
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,740
She won't steal twice in the same trip. The only people here is us and some dad buying sketches

604
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,220
Like how they spelt sketches wrong probably on purpose

605
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,900
You wouldn't look at us. We're like children. I know sidekicks are so cool. I used to want one so bad

606
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,260
You know when I was 56

607
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,180
Um

608
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,780
I'm stealing her should I steal a shirt? Oh, I just want to this is so funny. Um

609
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,100
Should I steal a $10 shirt or still a cd?

610
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,260
Where iPods around in 2008 because then I would just pirate it

611
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,380
I'm stealing a shirt

612
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,820
Steal the seat well too bad

613
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,900
You wouldn't download you wouldn't download a car

614
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,540
Sludge lord this looks like

615
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,340
Either Spencers or hot topic

616
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,900
Like

617
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,100
I don't know the tv said you suck. So fuck you. Yeah, right

618
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,900
You guys get paid eight an hour to go to that bitch idiot school. He gets paid eight an hour. Oh, that's true

619
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:44,860
That would impress us. Yeah, you're dumb white and bro. I applaud five the i4 were out. Okay, bitch

620
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,860
Hey, whoa, where's your manager? Oh wait, I didn't notice it was a hot topic shirt

621
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,300
God damn it fine. Sorry

622
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,500
Good now what sizes do you have msi shirts in right now?

623
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:02,460
You know the thing is you don't talk to the staff when you go to steal something right because then they're just like they

624
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,540
They know you out is what we have, dude

625
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,860
If you don't check right now, I'm gonna tell your manager. You didn't say hi to us when we walked in

626
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,100
Fuck fine. Joe. Go to your bitches. I'm just gonna go back and pretend to look

627
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,980
Okay, grab the small let's go. Yeah, I was like, how the fuck do you think I'm a large come on

628
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,900
Well, you got big titties. How'd you learn how to do that?

629
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,780
What do you mean learn you can't just take the shit in front of them. Okay, it's like it's like that's just a common sense

630
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,540
Before we get caught. We can't leave now. That was the sound experience. I actually

631
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,180
Cannot comment on that

632
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,540
You know when I was younger, why would you risk getting caught one time?

633
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:46,220
Oh my god, they talk so fast. I can't even one time. Um

634
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,260
When I was younger

635
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
I stole candy

636
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,100
He he

637
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,060
But like one of those like penny candies at like the grocery store

638
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,180
And my dad I was like five and my dad like made me like

639
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,340
Walk back

640
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,340
because he I knew

641
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,980
I took something you probably just saw me do it

642
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,020
And then he's just like and I was like acting really sus

643
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,700
And then my dad made me walk back and apologize to the manager in return the candy

644
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,700
It was literally like

645
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,860
Awerthers like an individually wrapped like werthers and like jolly ranchers

646
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,020
1970 yeah 1975 that's why I call it penny candy. Exactly

647
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,060
So, yeah, it was he stole tic-tacs

648
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,620
Oh my god tic-tacs or tic-tacs still around. I don't even know

649
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,260
Or with the free samples lady chase after us literally anywhere, but here come on

650
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,980
Oh

651
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,780
Little diner

652
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:50,540
This suspiciously looks like a diner. I know

653
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,980
Where does this take place it's literally just a burger or maybe every all diners just look the same I guess

654
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,900
Someone who butters margarine with butter

655
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,780
You think we got trody fired today. I don't know

656
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,500
I don't care either weird most of our friends just get jobs to buy Adderall

657
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,500
but he has to like

658
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,180
Support himself just to buy Adderall almost like he has to deal with the consequences of his actions or something

659
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,180
Since when do you of all people worry about accountability? I don't worry about it for my actions. I'm too smart for consequences

660
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,180
It's the one time I feel kind of bad for a guy because he can't do any of the stupid money jobs

661
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,940
Well, he could pole dance. There's nothing stopping him from pole dancing

662
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,140
Though I feel ripped off because I learned how to read from nothing

663
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,460
What if you're too shy and just work out hopes in Los Angeles? Okay hooters is even worse than a club

664
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,860
It's a legalized brothel. What how how do you know this? Is it really worse at one?

665
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,020
She says half the girls blow dudes for like $300 tips. Oh my god. My funny story at Hooters

666
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:53,660
I have to ask her if that actually happened. That's really specific. That really happens. So what's next?

667
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,700
I think although she got she did make major tips working at Hooters. She has big old knockers too

668
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,180
I'd rather do that than end up the dick-sucking girl at Hooters

669
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,660
You can just say girl at Hooters the dick-sucking is implied

670
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:09,900
Check please. You're not even paying for it. Just get up and leave. Just dine and dash. Oh my god. They are the worst

671
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,900
There's so much happening. I can't even react properly. You don't know the half of it

672
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:19,340
Not even a quarter for being honest. Well, the sign and sheet is on the desk the unexcused column

673
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:25,180
Oh, so we just ended up skipping a school to go to the mall to steal shit and get stuff. Okay. That's cool

674
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,860
Yeah, trauma has to be one of the excused hardies, right? For some reason I don't believe you

675
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:37,980
But today I think that's your problem. It's being a fucking bitch your problem. Ayo, excuse me. Oh my god. It was the trauma

676
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:44,460
I'm so sorry. So why don't you both enlighten me to the source of this trauma that's caused absence after absence

677
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,140
Uh lie, but no we're gonna we're gonna pull the depression card

678
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,100
There's a game only on them. I don't know

679
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,460
Because it only gives me the display and the

680
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,140
Volume so I'm like, uh, can I because if I could slow it down

681
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,700
That'd be great

682
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,700
Can I just save? Oh

683
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,540
Just lie about having aids

684
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:23,180
How do I go back? Hello. Oh my god

685
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,620
Let's see. Oh

686
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,580
Actually, I won't keep lying

687
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:39,020
Okay, yeah, I'll play this one for now, but next I'm done because I actually do want to play the first game and voice it so

688
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,940
There's I don't think there's any way

689
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,940
For me to not make it just auto play hardcore. No, it's just

690
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,860
We were both like, uh, what she said like I can skip ahead

691
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,740
Honestly, I don't know. It's just

692
00:55:54,460 --> 00:56:00,140
We were both diagnosed with manic depression and it's just hard to show up. Oh my god, sis relatable

693
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,860
She said it just nothing makes me happy anymore. Not even cocaine. Not even cocaine

694
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:11,340
Is that why she's so skinny? Hmm. I'm not sure we've had that as an excuse before but it's totally real

695
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:17,900
Come on. Isn't it manic depression real? That's like a combination of bipolar and being depressed

696
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,580
She could have said seasonal depression

697
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:27,660
When he Houston said we need a whole year that was for black history month. No, it was for mental health

698
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:33,660
Yeah, maybe they're black. They look black to me anymore. They're just really light skin

699
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,140
I just don't feel feelings or care about anything headed into a downward spiral. Oh my god

700
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:45,260
Automotive only is a game feature kill myself. Oh, that's good. Yeah, and I'm totally numb to hearing that because of my

701
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,100
Manic depression. All right fine. I'll excuse it this time

702
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,300
But I expect you to seek help if this really is so much. Oh, yeah, a comedian hour

703
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,620
You made my day just a little bit better. I have no

704
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:05,420
I have no emotion in your way of depression. Remember? I think so. You didn't do shit with Lynn. All right

705
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:10,300
I think instead of class you should head over to your counselor for additional. I would love to voice in a game like this

706
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:16,220
Hey, uh principle in you got a minute. Hold on. He just slides in. I thought you dropped out

707
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,860
Well, yeah, I did but I think I want to reenroll what the hell great to hear trody

708
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,500
Why the sudden change of plans? I think it just make going to college a little easier

709
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:31,100
Also, I got fired from hot topic. They said I let someone steal a shirt. Oh my god. They got a fire

710
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,460
What why do you say that they were in the mall like two hours ago? No

711
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,100
He fucked us

712
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,500
Could you step outside for a bit? Yeah, no problem. I meant trody

713
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:49,820
Oh, no, we were fucked. Yeah, who can trust what they say manic depression, huh?

714
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:56,220
Suicidal thoughts and all we had retail therapy right now. So we're not all the way lying. Exactly

715
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,700
Worth it for a t-shirt at the mall. You must be so

716
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,500
Yes, I'm self destructive. Why do you think I'm stealing t-shirts? It's a cry for help

717
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,500
Dude, can we just go to an easier book this is the easier book

718
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:16,140
Is everyone in the reading buddies program this stupid? Hey, the principal sent you here to help me

719
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:22,060
So make good or I'm snitching hard. Okay. Kylar. What are these names? Surf and Co's. Let's be like amber conby

720
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,020
Oh my god, bin Laden

721
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,020
Who has fucked you raw?

722
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,700
two

723
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:35,340
Fist uh, oh my gosh, hard one on purpose. It's a dr. Seuss book. You fucking did he cannot be this dumb

724
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,820
If it's so easy, why don't you try it, huh? One fish two fish redfish you bitch

725
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:48,460
Blue fish. See, I knew you couldn't do it. This is a really potent punishment. No, I want to drop out

726
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:56,620
For real, let's go to here. Let's go to Hooters get some tips. I don't think they will I think you have to be at to work at Hooters though

727
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:02,460
It's senior year. You're not. Oh my god. She's like very seen haircut. I'm not either, but you sound like a sitcom

728
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:07,500
Here we go again. I feel like I'm just reacting to a tv. So this is just a watch along at this point

729
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,980
I'm like, where the hell did you get so much at all? My boyfriend's 25. I can get whatever

730
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,740
Her boyfriend's 25? Sweetie. You're being groomed

731
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,860
Eight year age gap. That's pretty cool. That should work out. Yeah

732
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,660
The irony in her voice start giving out free syringes at south county south county high school

733
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,860
Uh-huh before they were trying to curb the opioid addiction

734
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,580
But now they're just trying to keep all the kids from getting hapsi or whatever because I could like remove their voices

735
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,980
I would just be speaking really fast

736
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,420
Socks

737
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:41,500
Oh, do you do that? She shoots up my boyfriend got me into it, but it's just lines

738
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,900
Not just nothing serious your boyfriend dating you in high school got you into heroin

739
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:50,460
You guys are gonna be awesome. Oh my god. Match made in heaven. What do you want the needles for for him?

740
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,860
Because he did it so much that like eventually doesn't hit. So like he has like track marks in his arms in his feet

741
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,340
It's crazy

742
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,220
What happens to some good holy

743
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:08,540
Yeah, I'll see you there. I feel pretty educated on stuff because I just been to watch euphoria. So I'm like, uh

744
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,460
Yes, well, yeah, I get references now

745
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:18,300
Usually when I look in the mirror, all I see is a self-destructive pill popping hoe after five minutes with her

746
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,380
I feel like Selena Gomez

747
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,940
Like you feel Mexican

748
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:28,220
I have school, Nicole. You'd fuck that school. Shit. So from everything we had to do

749
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,860
Oh, no, I'll make I'll make them go to class euphoria. Um, no, not that euphoria

750
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,660
No, the tv show euphoria. It's a tv show with Zendaya

751
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,700
Okay, let's go to the theater class. Let's go

752
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,260
Crispin here

753
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:56,060
Emily. Uh-huh. Yeah, watch I was watching euphoria the from face connect

754
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:03,500
We do it right. Do you want right taking attendance? Nicole tardy. Which one's the teacher tardy in here

755
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:09,100
Meaning you're late since when are you in charge of that your student like the rest of us? Okay? I was gonna say last week

756
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:14,300
Not anymore. Ms. Tegan made me student teacher while she's off working on a that's not how that works

757
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:18,060
I get you a substitute dunking those nuts

758
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,100
Acting sucks. Well, I thought it's just pastes of the board. Well, I don't think you're a good actor either

759
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,420
You probably couldn't even lie to the police. Yeah, honestly, don't take her side. Why not?

760
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:33,180
She's right because I'm your student. Wait. Why is like Jesus crossed out on his shirt or her shirt?

761
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,580
I really can't tell I ever killed himself while dating you

762
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,780
So anyway, today we'll break up

763
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,820
One'll do a table read exercise. The other will be improvised acting

764
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:48,140
So who wants to do what I don't want to do anything the teacher isn't even here

765
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:54,300
I just can't wrap my head around if my teacher's like, sorry, I have to go on and do this thing and this puts a student in charge

766
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,020
Yeah, that's not jesus. Who is that?

767
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,900
Not pretty enough to be in movies. I don't get why you want to act acting isn't about looks

768
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:05,900
It's about talent and creativity. This is about written character, but you want to see it for a while

769
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,060
Stop calling me ugly. No, I'm not calling you ugly. I am

770
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,020
I am you look like the girl from harry potter, but not photogenic

771
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,260
Go off says

772
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,020
Should do a group improv or table reading

773
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,140
It's too improv. I think they'll be funnier

774
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,580
So how do we do this?

775
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,500
Wait, maybe I can just like let's see if I can read it fast

776
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:55,340
Let's see if I can read it fast because like I feel like I'm doing nothing

777
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,540
I give you guys a snare. Oh, yeah, it makes sense. So the scene is you're a newlywed husband and wife in 1949

778
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,540
The wife wants to know what the war was like

779
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,140
What if he doesn't know what the war was like

780
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,820
It was 1949 everyone was just getting out of the war at least knew someone, right?

781
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,020
The

782
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,020
Okay, so we go now

783
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,780
Yeah action

784
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,340
Hey, you seem kind of upset. Is there a thing you want to talk about?

785
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,620
Nah, I'm good. Oh, well, do you want to hear about the war?

786
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,780
No

787
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:37,100
Wait, wait, megans. You can never say no for improv. It just like makes it go nowhere

788
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,060
That was the plan

789
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:45,420
Well, I guess don't do that. All right, let's try again. Hey wife something on your mind

790
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,380
Yeah, um, there's something I've been wanting to stay lately

791
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,420
Oh, what's that the end?

792
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,060
Oh

793
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:27,660
Why do you want to say that it's 1949, isn't it tell me if you see

794
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,340
Oh, maybe oh, so let me just

795
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,140
I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest with you

796
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:59,340
I have the pass so it's fun. I may not vtuber look like I have the pass, but I have the pass

797
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:08,300
I did mention my dad is proud of my mom this way. So this is like

798
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,500
I

799
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,500
Can't cancel me if I'm brown

800
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,460
I'm getting that tan toggle

801
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,420
Prove it. Well, you'll see it in the the monetization stream

802
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:25,420
I was like, I'm like, I didn't know I'll be honest with you. I didn't know how people would react if they're like, oh

803
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,700
She's white vtuber, but she's

804
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,780
light-skinned tan

805
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:35,340
Iro, uh, like I don't really give a shit play who I play. I'm an anime girl on the internet

806
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,980
I have fucking bunny ears like it's whatever

807
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:44,700
But yes, uh, I wanted you if you were gonna find out anyways when I do a hand cam stream and a

808
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,820
thigh cam. So let's just continue

809
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,300
The n-word is probably

810
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,860
With no repercussions

811
01:05:52,860 --> 01:06:00,940
1949's a great year for me. Uh, I'm glad you're happy. Yeah. Oh, you see that see what that different colored family pulling up in a

812
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,940
Lincoln you want to do the honors

813
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,300
What are the honors calling them the n-word? Duh

814
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:12,940
Why would I do that? It's 1949. Why wouldn't you all right? Um, is there anything else you want to talk about?

815
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,060
Yeah, you want to

816
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,060
It's not all right now

817
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,700
I can't my

818
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:51,100
I love this game so far. I love it

819
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,340
I think reading is the best option. Are you kidding me?

820
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,380
And my love to manager

821
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,140
Oh

822
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,660
No, but another no

823
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,480
It tells you get that word of your vocabulary if you're gonna do this exercise

824
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:31,580
Yeah, but the situation got kind of the situation doesn't matter. It's improv no matter what you never use the n-word

825
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,020
If you do it again, I'll have full power to fail you for the quarter

826
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,340
Jesus

827
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,340
All right, so uh resume scene

828
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:44,700
But yeah, honey should we sign up for the 1949 kkk initiation

829
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:49,260
Okay, great to hear by the way. Could you tell me about the war?

830
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:56,060
Oh and use the n-word as much as possible when describing it and scene. All right, so how do we do?

831
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,700
Uh, i'm gonna have to talk with megan

832
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
shit

833
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:08,300
Nicole dude class is over. What do you want? I just need to have a little talk with you

834
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,020
About your partisan

835
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,420
Can I be honest?

836
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,900
Okay, is that it or

837
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:20,540
You're not getting it. I'm your teacher in this class. It'll treat me as such this disingenuous attitude

838
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,620
Isn't gonna fly in my program got it

839
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:29,420
Dude, what the fuck ever I just told you don't treat me like i'm your classmate. I'm your teacher. Is that how you talk to your teachers?

840
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:35,180
Actually, yeah, don't lie to me. Oh my god, chill out if you don't get your shit together

841
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:40,220
I'm gonna call miss teegan and tell her everything. She's gonna write you up for in school suspension

842
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:45,580
So think it's all fun and games. Nicole. Yeah, sure side note. Are you withdrawing from bipolar meds right now?

843
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:50,860
Don't change the subject. We're talking about you and your issues right now. Jesus christ, okay

844
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:56,540
You think you just smirk while emily calls me an ugly Hermione? I had no part of that. Go ahead. Call me ugly again

845
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:01,900
No, thanks. Can I go? Oh, see now you get it. Now you're treating me like your teacher

846
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:06,860
Okay, megan. Yeah, it's miss megan. Miss megan. Can I get the fuck out of here now?

847
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,740
You're excused sweetie, but work on the foul language

848
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,860
Work on getting a fucking therapist. Holy shit

849
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,860
Oh

850
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:40,300
Oh my god, there's so many clips out of context. I'm gonna be speedrun

851
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,300
I can't stop

852
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,820
Oh my tommy, okay, um

853
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:57,740
Oh special card. Hey, was this again the english sub today. She was so old and talkative

854
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,580
At least you can go on your phone, right? That was the worst part

855
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,220
She stopped her boring story to get anyone with their phone out

856
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,340
A sub that won't let you screw around want to rip off

857
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,700
I don't know how someone manages to be more boring than regular shit

858
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,580
Weird. Yeah, I had a sub today too

859
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,820
How'd that go the drama teacher nominee just student teaches a class while she's out of school

860
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:23,580
What the fuck? I know why would she pick a student, right? No. Why are you in drama?

861
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,100
It's a gimme class. Don't worry. I have no intention of being a fucking actor

862
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:32,140
Good the drama kids are so fucking annoying. They're all ugly yet. Some I think they're gonna be in a movie one day

863
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,660
Yeah, that's pretty much the student teacher who's a massive bitch, by the way

864
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,540
Do I know her? Do you know megan? I was in second grade with her. Why is she a bitch?

865
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:46,220
No, I'm just doing whatever not really caring and then she stops me outside after class and gets super in my face about it

866
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,020
Because you weren't acting good enough

867
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:54,380
I guess but she's like i'm gonna fucking write you up get you suspended and all this shit and i'm just standing there

868
01:10:55,100 --> 01:11:01,180
Uh, that makes a lot of sense now. So until she was a tantrum kid in second grade every week was a freak out

869
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:07,100
Once a tantrum kid. Oh, it's a tantrum kid. Yeah control freak for real. So are you gonna drop the class?

870
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,940
No, i'm good. I'm gonna drop her ass though. Aren't you a little too old for revenge? Oh, so now you're taking her side

871
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,180
No, no, I support you. I'm just not getting involved

872
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,460
Because you have such a future, right? Apparently more than you

873
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:23,740
Future or no future revenge is a dish best served cold like pizza. She's wrong. No

874
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:31,500
Wow, you do seriously eat pizza cold. Yeah, what's wrong with that? Now, I know you're out of your fucking mind

875
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:36,300
Ew, I hate like greasy solidified

876
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,580
This is very much visual novel e

877
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,300
twit longest cancellation

878
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,500
I'm canceling she be cotton bum

879
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:48,940
I hate cold pizza

880
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,660
I'll eat it. I don't like it though tickets for what? Oh my god. You really forgot again

881
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,740
the dinner theater

882
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,980
Oh, yeah, I can like order those tonight still

883
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,860
Tompather, I'll see what myself

884
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:05,580
Sorry. Yeah, okay. If you were actually sorry, wouldn't have fucked it up in the first time

885
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,140
Yeah, I'll try better next time

886
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,660
Stress out enough teaching this class. She's so annoying

887
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:17,900
Does this he's our student too. What do you mean student too? They're dating. You didn't know that

888
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,980
No, but it checks out. I thought it was kind of weird. He was the only one in class not making fun of her

889
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,700
I know for a fact he wants out of it too. He's flirted with like three of my friends so far

890
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,500
Not surprising a bitch like her I cheat on her too

891
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:37,260
She's not weird category of just barely putting enough to be super demanding. What pretty enough. Oh god the sex with her must be so bad

892
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:40,940
I didn't even think he's getting that she was raised catholic like super prudish

893
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:45,980
Do you just know everything about this bitch? What I've been around longer. You just hear this shit

894
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,700
All right, don't worry about it because I think I have my in

895
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,860
in for what

896
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:55,100
Megan's life a boyfriend isn't she isn't fucking is the perfect weakness for me to exploit

897
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,780
This is starting to sound like a red tube video

898
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,340
Ew, I'm not gonna fuck him. Okay. Just checking because every second the video there sounds exactly like that

899
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:09,820
Like what like oh you killed my parents. I'll show you what the most suffocating blowjob ever can share on video

900
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:16,780
Dude, how much red tube do you watch? Don't worry about it. Fine. But anyway, me and hunter share a science class next period

901
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:21,820
That's convenient. What are you gonna do? Let's say I'm gonna

902
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,620
order a hot pizza

903
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,020
Are you gonna wait for it to get cold?

904
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,740
You know me so well

905
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,860
Oh my god, I feel like pause so I can look at chat

906
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,980
So I don't want to steal the boyfriend. I don't like people like that, but

907
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:44,220
Come to me. Yeah, I could potentially niffle. She is pretty based

908
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,620
She is pretty base. You want me to steal her boyfriends? I'll do I honestly like normally

909
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:55,980
For real though, I would never do such a thing, but she is so fucking annoying this mega girl

910
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,180
Nicole is not going to do that. Is she gonna like throw pizza in his face?

911
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,220
That's right. We'll finish

912
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:07,580
My wife killed herself. Any questions, Jeffrey?

913
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,900
Uh, yeah, when's our science lab gonna be about today?

914
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,860
I mean questions about my wife killing herself

915
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
Oh, sorry, no

916
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:26,300
So for Tay's lab will be identifying which element is based on its massive volume. Get into your groups while I grab the supplies

917
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,260
But like there is always that one teacher that like dumps too much

918
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,980
Are you gonna be okay?

919
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,940
Oh, yeah, I got up. It's bullshit effort doing it alone

920
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,900
I could partner with you if you want

921
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:47,420
Really? I thought you hated this class while we're both in drama. So it might help get to know each other if we're gonna act

922
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,460
I thought you hated that class too

923
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,900
I'm warming up to it

924
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:56,780
Mom and Nicole, I thought we were lab partners. Shut the fuck up. Go away. She's fucking christ

925
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:04,700
Wasn't that kind of harsh yesterday. He was telling about how he kills dogs in his backyard. I can't work with someone like that

926
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:10,700
Uh, okay, I guess that was justified sit with me. Cool

927
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,220
You don't mind if I look at porn on my phone, do you?

928
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,180
Uh, no

929
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,700
Awesome. Yeah, it's something I do when I'm bored. That's not tmi. Is it?

930
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,460
Uh, I'm okay with it. But uh, why do you do it at school?

931
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:31,580
Kind of add something to it. I don't know. So what are you doing after school?

932
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:37,100
I gotta go to the dentist for cavity. You always make me gag with all those tools. I hate it

933
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,900
You like the dentist?

934
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:44,460
What? No, I meant gagging. I don't have a gag reflex. Oh, you're so lucky

935
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,460
I don't think luck had anything to do with it. I like testing my limits

936
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,180
Oh, you mean like uh

937
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,380
Yeah, like that, but don't worry. I know Megan's your girlfriend. I won't cross any lines. I'm just honest about myself

938
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:03,260
Oh my god, she's so bad. Honestly, she's good. I don't mind it. Sweet. I think we'll just get along fine in drama

939
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:07,180
By the way, I realized you're technically dating your teacher ultimate fantasy, right?

940
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,620
Uh, I guess so

941
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,980
She's an actor actor too. Do you guys have a role play?

942
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,780
No, can't say we do

943
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:22,060
I guess she's burned out after acting at school. I can't like maintain Nicole's voice because it'll slip into jecca

944
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,420
But me personally, I love role playing

945
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:30,380
Oh, cool. Some kind of things you play. You have a girlfriend. You're asking me about my role playing

946
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:35,180
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I mean to relax. I'm fucking with you. Honestly, you don't need to worry

947
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:40,780
I have a sixth sense for relationships and I can tell I have I'm so sorry. Excuse me

948
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,820
How fun is she?

949
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:49,020
Okay, don't tell her I told you this but just based on her personality. I can tell she gives amazing head. Am I right?

950
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,940
Uh, your sixth sense might need some work

951
01:16:55,580 --> 01:17:00,380
Oh my god, I was wrong. Is she really bad at it? She doesn't really do any of that

952
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,900
How long have you been dating a few months now?

953
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:09,580
Wow, I'm really sorry your relationship like that. Do you want my number in case you want to vent or anything?

954
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,060
Oh my god, that's so toxic

955
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,860
What did you mention the relationship does feel kind of manipulative sometimes

956
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,900
And that's why I want to be there for you because trust me. I know all about manipulative relationships

957
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:27,100
He's so fucking bad. Holy shit

958
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,140
Okay, so again, this is romance improv

959
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,500
We're just gonna need to see who's best for a mini production at Romeo and Juliet

960
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,420
Who's going first?

961
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:39,500
Well, we need a guy and a girl hunter. Why don't you go first? I smack my mic. All right, sure

962
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,540
Now who's gonna play the other side? Emily

963
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:47,500
This far romance. Yes romance improv. No, he's ugly

964
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,580
I'll do it

965
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,300
Seriously? Yeah, why not get better if I don't practice, right?

966
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,380
Okay, go ahead

967
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:55,740
What's the scene again?

968
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:59,980
You're about to go to prison for 10 years and this is your last conversation with your girlfriend

969
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,020
scandalous

970
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,020
This might be the last time we ever talk face to face

971
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,460
Are you sure you'll beat the case? I know you

972
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,420
My lawyer said it's not looking good. If I'm lucky, I'll get out in five for good for behavior

973
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:19,100
This is not Romeo and Juliet. We're just gonna take that you're free now, aren't you? What do you mean?

974
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:25,020
Let's run away to Mexico. They won't find you there. I would but this ankle monitor isn't doing me any favors

975
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:29,180
Just cut it off. I don't have any scissors

976
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:33,340
Okay, that makes sense. So you're really just gonna serve the time

977
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:39,020
No other options, but what about me? What am I gonna do with myself without you?

978
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,820
Do you think you can wait for me on the outside?

979
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,060
I don't know. All your friends really want to have sex with me

980
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:51,500
Look, I can't control you from the inside. Just keep me in the dark about it. Jesus

981
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,540
You're giving up that easy. I thought you loved me

982
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,860
I guess not enough

983
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,500
You're just telling yourself that to feel less bad about missing me

984
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,100
But actually speak louder than words whenever you touch me. I know the truth

985
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,260
But but what am I supposed to do

986
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:14,380
Touch me one more time take me to my limit with your last sign of freedom and don't ever forget the feeling

987
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:21,580
Uh, uh and scene what we can't keep going. I was about to suck a stick

988
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,140
Not the ntr not the net

989
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,180
No

990
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:35,100
No, we can't see but i'm putting my arms up in an x. No, no, we do not support ntr here

991
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,660
We do not support ntr

992
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,380
Don't get it twisted. We don't support ntr

993
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:47,420
Oh my god, I nailed those lines. Thank you. Thank you

994
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:53,820

995
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,940

Wait

1014
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,580
I'm confused by this sentence

1015
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:20,460
You like powerless humiliation. Yeah. Yeah, that's true

1016
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:24,220
But you can there's so many other ways to humiliate

01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,060
yourself

1018
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:31,580
You know should be approved of polygamy. I don't really care. I don't really give a shit what you do

Me I will not participate in that sort of thing although is it polygamy if i'm dating all of you

1020
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,260
You're all my brother and sister husband wives

He who he ha anyways. Wow

1037
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:13,180
That's enough. Nicole. Okay. Who else wants to try maybe a little too scandalous

1038
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,220
Emily, do you know where to buy a whip-its without getting carded?

1039
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:23,500
Uh, no, sorry. I don't even do whip-its. Damn because you really look like a girl who does whip-its

1040
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,060
Oh my god. Thank you

1041
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,380
Little weird she took that as a compliment

1042
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:33,420
Nicole, I need another talk with you. Shit. I went overboard for what nothing. What's the problem this time?

1043
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:37,660
Actually, there's no problem at all. I just want to let you know. I really appreciate the effort today

1044
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:46,380
Wait, seriously? Yeah, you're seen with hunter today showed a lot of passion actually kind of moved me

1045
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:51,740
It's like you were really trying to make him fall in love with you. It showed a lot of talent

1046
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
Oh, well, okay. Thanks

1047
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:59,100
And Nicole, I just want to say i'm really sorry for being so hard on you

1048
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,940
At first I thought you were just another disingenuous white kid

1049
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:06,060
You're white too

1050
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,180
I

1051
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:13,740
Told you it's miss Megan

1052
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:17,340
I'm sorry. It's like

1053
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:22,380
This was like my childhood friends basement. That's kind of funny. Um

1054
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,860
It's really funny when me to me when like

1055
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:29,740
Never mind

1056
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:34,700
People refer to other people white people for other people as just a white person. I'm like you're white

1057
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,940
Oh

1058
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:41,020
Butt implants. Yeah, I don't get either in this group of slides on their leg. What?

1059
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,140
Ew gross. Do you want to say?

1060
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:48,860
Taxing someone right now. You've been on the phone like all day. Who are you talking to?

1061
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:54,220
Little Caesars cold and ready. Oh, I almost forgot. Yeah, how's it's going? Megan's boyfriend

1062
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,420
I'm making some pretty good progress and so far. I got 10

1063
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:01,740
11 pictures of his dick so far. God damn. He's desperate. Jesus. Fuck

1064
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,380
I'm trying to get one of this face in it too so I can prove it's him. Yeah, I rest like it'd be anyone's dick

1065
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,860
But what if he's checking you with a picture of someone else's?

1066
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:14,700
Why would a guy carrying around 11 angles of someone else's erection? He could be gay. He's definitely not gay

1067
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,420
No gay guy would ski in mom's jewelry box for me

1068
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,980
Why would he do that in his mom's jewelry box?

1069
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:28,300
I told him it really turned me on and within 90 seconds he sent a picture of it. You want to see

1070
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:34,060
Uh, yeah, look at this. Jesus Christ. It's fucked

1071
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,340
Pearl necklace on a pearl necklace

1072
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,860
Ew and circumcised

1073
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,620
I'm gonna throw up and circumcised mentioned

1074
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:49,340
Oh

1075
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:01,260
He'll wear this guy for literally nothing as it stands or technically into him

1076
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,740
I could not let that happen

1077
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:09,420
Brother

1078
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:14,860
Couldn't tell you or maybe we multiply the density by the mass

1079
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,020
Dude, I'm feeling this class. Anyway, who gives a shit is something bothering you right now

1080
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:25,900
Not really. It's just caring about science for white guys are correct. You're a grammar

1081
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:29,420
All right. Actually, there's been starting something I've been thinking about lately

1082
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:35,660
Oh, you don't correct my grammar. No, not that just us

1083
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:40,460
What about us? Who does he have on a shirt? I had fun texting last night

1084
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:45,180
No, I looked at you. It's just I think about how I feel talking to you and compare it with talking to megan

1085
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:50,620
And I don't think she actually likes me. She's gay. Megan's gay. She's gay. She's gay. She's a catholic gay. She's a catholic gay

1086
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,180
What? How so?

1087
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:55,180
She just doesn't humor me the way you do

1088
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,980
Does it feel like she actually loves me? You're in high school. You don't love each other

1089
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,340
Are you sure? I think you can stick it out a lot longer

1090
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,500
I could but I really don't want to it's no fun being with some bossy prude

1091
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,220
If you like me for me, she would have done something by now

1092
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,620
Okay, that's a little bit problematic

1093
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:23,260
Love does he not equate to sexual gratification? Get it through your heads. Don't pressure girls and claim

1094
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:27,500
That you love them if you love me you would fuck me

1095
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,020
But especially in high school

1096
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,420
Just break up with her and go screw some other girl that wants to have sex

1097
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,620
She just needs time and good

1098
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,580
I

1099
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,940
I'm sorry. I just wasn't funny. Keep what up like sending you all those pictures

1100
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:59,900
Amy when you came in your mom's jewelry box. Does anyone need my help over here? Yeah, actually for the no, we're fine. Just thinking

1101
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:01,820
okay

1102
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,820
Jeffrey could you draw a better picture?

1103
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,820
But yeah, the jewelry box. Yeah among others

1104
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,780
That was really hot by the way

1105
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,580
You really thought so I had another one like that, but I forgot to send it

1106
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:18,860
Did you clean that another jewelry box? No, it was my brother's uno collection

1107
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,660
Like uno the restaurant

1108
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,220
No uno the card game

1109
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:29,020
Oh, how can you have a collection of uno?

1110
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:33,820
Like all the different versions nfl uno batman uno simpsons uno

1111
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:38,540
That's all you just put them all together and blew a fat load on them

1112
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,940
Yeah, I'm always doing it. I was thinking about you and oh god, listen to me

1113
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,700
What's wrong we're just having a normal conversation

1114
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:53,100
Megan has no idea we're doing this. It feels kind of messed up. Yeah, you're cheating on her

1115
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,700
That's why I feel guilty bro

1116
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,540
Her relationship with her is like long-term romance the kind of thing and like dating or whatever

1117
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,940
She really loves you, but then

1118
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,500
I

1119
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,100
Can't keep up

1120
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:22,780
She won't explore your urges and nothing we're finding someone who will besides it's only cheating if you say you love me. Mm-hmm

1121
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,900
So if you say you love me

1122
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,700
You can't see I'm pointing at the camera right now. I'm pointing at my phone

1133
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,620

1134
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,420
Is is veeler the other corpo

You leave your oh, she's streamed to sneak into ours

1136
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:37,980
Oh

01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:43,740
No, what have I done? What have I realized?

1138
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:55,420
I'm I'm a normal girl. I'm say so. I'm good. No, it's not this bad. No, I'm not I'm not a whore

1139
01:30:55,900 --> 01:31:02,940
I'm not a whore. I'm a good girl. I'm not wearing shabari ropes for an outfit. I'm not the side. Oh, she I'm the I'm the commy

1140
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,060
Ah

1141
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,220

1142
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,380
You clean

1143
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:28,780
Oh my god, and people make all the counts to watch us. Oh my god, that's so fucked

1144
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,260
I

1145
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,660
Feel terrible. I feel like

1146
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:46,220
I genuinely just feel like we just got caught like doing something like what if you're oh, she's like watching this out of like curiosity

1147
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,700
She was she's just like she just comes over. She's like, oh

The new veeler girls seem really nice and then she's like watching me right now

1149
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,100
And then she's like and then she sees me just talking about this

1150
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:00,060
No, this isn't a clip don't clip this

1151
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,540
No

1152
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:10,380
The only negative to having a larger audience now is that I just can't nuke vods when I was like a

1153
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,940
One view on twitch. I would just fucking delete shit because I'd be like

1154
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,300
Arise it

1155
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:26,060
I don't want to be the other girl. I don't want to be the other woman. I feel bad being the other woman

1156
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,500
I

1157
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:41,180
Because I want to be friends and it's even fucked up because I probably want to be friends with your oh, she

01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:53,740
The friend's gonna go crazy

1162
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:56,460
Anyways, let's continue my tummy

1163
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,420
Actually, we don't bring containment

1164
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:02,460
Yeah, it's been the rule since forever as long as we don't kiss and all that mushy stuff

1165
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,740
We hang out whenever we want and that's pretty cool and I've looked at it like that

1166
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:10,220
That's what I'm here for so are you doing anything tonight?

1167
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:13,900
Actually, I want to divide you just I don't like NTR

1168
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:21,660
I don't I generally don't like I'm I'm upset because I've done this realize

1169
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:27,180
I'm pointing behave behave behave

1170
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:36,060
Okay, like jesus. Yeah the one and only I need a burp so you snap pictures of your penis while frequenting a church

1171
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,660
Yeah, I know that's what it's confession is for right?

1172
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,820
Are you gonna tell a priest you came in your mom's jewelry box?

1173
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:48,860
Yeah, I'll have to do the sunday, huh going blind and just forgive me father for I've sinned

1174
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:56,540
So you're telling me you blindly say to a guy all the sex shit you did over the week and call him father but not daddy

1175
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,180
What I don't what do you mean?

1176
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:03,740
Sorry red tube. What's so you what he doesn't want red tube is

1177
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:08,220
Nicole, please report to the counselor's office repeat. Nicole, please report to the counselor's office. Thank you

1178
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,220
Oh, wait. No, she's a mommy voice. Hold on

1179
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,220
Looks like I gotta go. I'll get back to you on that though

1180
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,260
I mean just let me know by Friday

1181
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:19,820
This is the first time being here is less awkward than where I just was

1182
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:23,820
Nicole, I hope I'm not interrupting too much with your class

1183
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:29,100
It was actually a perfect amount of interruption regardless. I wouldn't knock you off your newfound drive

1184
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:33,980
Driving where I mean your effort your sudden passion for scholastic participation

1185
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:37,100
Since when did you just lie to get me in here?

1186
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:44,300
Of course not you're saying you haven't gone the extra mile in theater and science lately your teachers in both spoke very highly of you

1187
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:48,220
Oh, they have

1188
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:52,780
Yes, they're very both very impressed with their sudden initiative when it comes to participating in the classroom

1189
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:57,820
Quite frankly, it's pleasantly surprising to hear you giving your prior reputation being a whore

1190
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:02,300
As your counselor it'd be important to know what's the sudden inspiration

1191
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,260
Should we live long enough to become the villain?

1192
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,700
Uh drama and science couldn't tell you. I'm just really smart I guess

1193
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:13,020
Well, either way great to see one of our most beautiful students. This is just a pretty fit

1194
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,980
Hold up

1195
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,780
What did he say?

1196
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:22,300
Not to mention dark daring fashion sense. You have a knack for turning heads, don't you?

1197
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:29,420
Well, now you're really flirting. Nothing flirtatious about admiring creative mind. You picked out such vibrant shorts. They shape you over. I am uncomfortable

1198
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:33,020
Hold on

1199
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,820
You know, I'm not gonna lie to you

1200
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:46,060
Some of this shit like definitely happened at my high school because actually my middle school

1201
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,500
Um

1202
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
Southern grade one of my uh

1203
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:55,260
Teachers slept with the students. It was very fucked up

1204
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:59,820
It was so fucked up and it sucked because that girl was my friend and I really liked that teacher

1205
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:05,020
And he's in jail. I can't see but I'm holding thumbs up

1206
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:13,660
Yeah, it was bad. It was really bad and now she works at Olive Garden

1207
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,140
Why don't you give me a twirl

1208
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,780
I'm having PTSD

1209
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:24,140
Um, it's like it's it's so like why

1210
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,620
like

1211
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,620
gross

1212
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:31,980
Stop praying on people like stop praying on kids

1213
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,940
It's where you get all your breadsticks

1214
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:37,100
That's how I become on that. No

1215
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,980
No wrong

1216
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:51,660
Get timed out for that mods. Where are you?

1217
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,580
Oh my god

1218
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,140
Go ahead and give me that twirl

1219
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,700
Oh, wait and press resume

1220
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
Oh, let me look at this

1221
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:10,140
Hi, oh, I tell you're fine. Tell me you can just sit back and relax baby girl. You're fine. Don't do anything. You're good

1222
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:15,020
Mods my vtuber stream mods gonna keep up

1223
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:21,340
Dude, I'm white. There's nothing to see anyway. Oh, no, that sounds like low self-esteem if I could volunteer a few more compliments

1224
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:25,260
I'm gonna go. I can still voluntarily. Bye

1225
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,980
Oh my god

1226
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:30,140
I got your tech. Sorry. I was caught up. What happened?

1227
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:36,140
I was in french too and called the weird kid rugrats fetish and got held after like rugrats to call it a cartoon

1228
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,380
Yeah, that's really good diss

1229
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:41,820
I know everyone laughed that you're made of both stay after for me apologize to him

1230
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,860
I can't talk but then after I was forced to say three nice things about him

1231
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:52,300
While he was there to his face. Yeah, talk about argus. Fuck. That's really cruel and unusual punishment. What did you even say?

1232
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:56,620
One of them was you don't smell that bad. Like I had no idea what to say

1233
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,740
Did he get turned on while you did it? Like think of how often a regular girl would say something nice to him

1234
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:06,860
I was trying to block that out when he gets home. He's going straight for your facebook summer photos

1235
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:11,340
Shit, and I forgot my password too. So what are you freaking out about micah's boyfriend?

1236
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:15,180
I thought you said the console that was horny. Oh, that's like every week. I'm already over that

1237
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:20,380
But no her boyfriend is out of his fucking mind. Well, yeah, he sent 11 dick pics for nothing back. No, shit

1238
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:24,540
No, he invited me to church this saturday. Isn't church on sunday?

1239
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,820
He's so involved the church. He goes more than sunday

1240
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:31,420
See a Mormon. Oh, he's one of those. Is it really surprising though?

1241
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:38,140
I didn't think a guy who cheats on his girlfriend and photographs his dick would have a strong relationship with jesus, I guess

1242
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,140
Oh, yeah, no, I've seen it

1243
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:44,380
I would so get off for your picture. So if it wasn't for my faith in god like, okay, thanks

1244
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:48,780
How'd you even get that far with the guy so religious? That's when I found out like what the fuck do I say?

1245
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,340
I didn't know what jesus was the escrow and titty pics

1246
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:56,780
Who even is jesus anymore? Anyway, some pedophile is fine to say that what?

1247
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:02,940
If you're a counselor, I don't find jesus. Yeah, jesus is a 15 year old girl for a juicy couture

1248
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:10,780
Are you gonna tell him no you just distract him? Hey, so I can't go to church tomorrow

1249
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:14,300
But you know what I want to do, you know what I want to do really fucking badly

1250
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:21,180
That was cool. How do you do that do 90% of dirty talk is just rhetorical questions

1251
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:22,940
She's not wrong

1252
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:29,260
So like I warned last week. Here's my casting for school's romeo and julia production. Let's see if romeo we have

1253
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,820
Wait, they made a play about romeo

1254
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:37,340
Oh, yeah, romeo's lead character. Isn't that mr. P's kid? Why do you think a little lot of it?

1255
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,940
No, not as a romeo mataku. It's shakespeare. We study this all month

1256
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:43,660
So it's not a little romeo and julia thong

1257
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:48,380
Yeah, what the fuck so the part playing the part romeo's hunter. Congratulations

1258
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:50,940
Oh, thanks

1259
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:57,420
A little more excitement can be applaud the castings listen some clapping and chat clap the mass cheeks guys

1260
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:04,300
Yay, thanks guys and playing the role of juliette will be not me not me nicole. Oh, thank god. Seriously

1261
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:07,180
Yeah, you earned it. I know we got off a rocky star

1262
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:12,220
But you're on stage the synergy with hunter has really blown my mind. I can't think of anyone better for the part

1263

1268
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:40,540
I'm not having this conversation with you. Is he like asking for ask pictures or something?

1269
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:43,820
Can you not I can give you the aspects trump card if you want to know it

1270
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:46,860
Just so you see it come if you try to use it what trump card

1271
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:51,820
Oh, it's real simple. If a girl's holding out on me. I just make it about trust and how I'll kill myself

1272
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:58,620
There's no way that works. No, like it works every okay

1273
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:03,900
Well, not every time but like 10 of the time what girl would respond to emotionally enough to sue us all the guy begging to jack off

1274
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:07,820
My maros be like

1275
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,780
It's job

1276
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:20,620
Life's really good in the bathroom. Why are you coaching your sister? You're my brother. Yeah, what would you care about my quality of my aspects?

1277
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,420
Uh, no, it's uh, I gotta go

1278
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:30,860
I had to teach us what ancient Greece in school. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here's been 45 seconds asshole

1279
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:34,940
Haven't gone anywhere with this full body pick. Let's try idiot's way

1280
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:41,180
Do you not trust me? I just want to see you in all one picture because it'd be really really

1281
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,340
Really

1282
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,100
Really

1283
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,100
I got him got what you know what?

1284
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:55,340
Blink tickets are not even together anymore the pictures. Oh, right if revenge you're still plotting. How's that's going?

1285
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:57,820
Let's just say I have the key ingredient

1286
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,820
Suicidal

1287
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:10,460
Or or I see all the oji sons are the big bros. I see that many pictures the same thing over and over

1288
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:13,260
Loser and Nicole's bitch negan is a whore just cool. Shit

1289
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:20,060
My fire alarm is going off. Well, it's not mine, but someone in the building's fire alarm is going off. That's annoying

1290
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:22,460
Hopefully you might be able to hear it on the microphone

1291
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:26,140
Probably some loser smoking weed in my building

1292
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:33,100
It's like some ugly guy writing shit on himself not the visual of the rock control for a very awesome. Wait a second

1293
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,420
Oh

1294
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,740
No, there's not a fire people always open the doors so their apartments when they're cooking and let the smoke go

1295
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,740
And it sets their fire alarm off

1296
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:47,180
So she writes

1297
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:53,660
No, it's not like you got it's it's literally like it sounds like it's on a different floor

1298
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,820
It's or whatever. It's fine

1299
01:42:56,220 --> 01:43:01,660
If it's not in my apartment and you'll trust me you'll hear when it's my apartment the alarms going off it is

1300
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:05,660
Your splittingly loud. It's terrible

1301
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:12,300
They are smoking weed and didn't offer a roofie bro. I don't think you know what that word means

1302
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:17,980
Um, but uh

1303
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:23,820
Writing writing we're writing my name on your body

1304
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:26,540
Ooh the control the control

1305
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,100
She be run save yourself

1306
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,700
No, this is the closest thing I've ever gotten to say

1307
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:36,140
It's a horrifying line in this game from oh my god

1308
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:41,820
Okay, that's what rapists say just so you know, I mean like I just but I'm a curl

1309
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:46,940
What am I gonna do guys fly off the handle for barely anything? Yeah guys not all not a lego

1310
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:51,900
Not saying that line exactly so now to the next step

1311
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:56,940
Are you gonna post the pictures online somewhere? No, I think I'm gonna hold on to these until the time is right

1312
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,100
And what time is that?

1313
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:05,740
Oh, you'll know I think everyone's gonna know. Oh my gosh. You can spread his news

1314
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:09,580
That's what

1315
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:14,540
We're on lesson five guys phones over outfit. It's good to get mega number check

1316
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,500
Make sure of a boyfriend with this weird dick out

1317
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:24,620
Hey, Nicole. Good luck tonight. Good luck to you too. Oh my god. Is she gonna put them up?

1318
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,900
That's so fucked

1319
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:37,980
Not her wink not the wink. We got two minutes into the first scene before mech and checked her phone

1320
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,260
Oh, okay

1321
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,460
That's so terrible

1322
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:48,140
What an amateur so she ran out on stage in the middle of romeo line laying out of control and just broke down crying in front of everybody

1323
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,100
Oh my god

1324
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:55,260
They were taking videos laughing. It was pretty fucking cool. He's just like shrugging

1325
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:59,820
She had to go to the ER for a panic attack and that was really fucking cool

1326
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:03,500
Jack I kept asking me why I had to go through rehearsing for a whole play even though I know

1327
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:08,060
I said like that's a good point. Well, I had to commit to it. Otherwise, she was gonna see when was up

1328
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:13,260
If I sent the picture as soon as I got it, she had the time to resolve everything before the play anyways

1329
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:15,660
There's no satisfaction in that

1330
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,780
See the movies where people kill someone for revenge, but it's like

1331
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:24,460
You're gonna let them off that easy. I didn't break a single law and this is like 10 times the payoff

1332
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,100
She's gonna be mentally fucked for the rest of her life over this

1333
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:31,900
And I just feel good about it. It's my face now Megan's gonna end up a cat lady. Hey

1334
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:39,980
This never happened to me. I just want to say that nobody does this to me

1335
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:45,260
No

1336
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:47,740

For the longest time like I I pretty much look like I'm Latina. Um

01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:33,020
And for the longest time

1422
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:41,420
I wouldn't eat fried chicken or watermelon because I didn't want to perpetuate hysteria type

1423
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,900

01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,660

1456
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:04,620

1512
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:38,220
My uncle used to make fun of me and said he could see in my brain

1513

I wasn't so okay. I'll tell you the story while I order food

1519
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:04,940
So

1520
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:10,380
Wait, did I add it? Okay, I did so what happened was

1521
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:15,580
I was playing ponies as a little girl does

1522
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:18,380
in elementary school

1523
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:20,700
and um

1524
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:22,780
Oh fuck

1525
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:25,980
Oh, should I treat myself? Oh, but I probably won't finish it

1526
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:29,100
Oh fuck

1527
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:31,100
Oh shit. Okay. I'm gonna treat myself

1528
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:35,020
Oh, yeah, brother. Wait

1529
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:40,220
So as I'm saying so we're playing ponies um as one does

1530
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:46,140
And I'm I'm playing the pony and I'm on my hands and knees and I'm just like me, you know being a pony girl

1531
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:50,380
And some kid playing football

1532
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:57,340
Uh runs into me while trying to catch the ball. So I slammed my head on the pavement because he ran me down

1533
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:01,260
Um nice just literally laid there and screamed

1534
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:05,580
And and then the um

1535
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,660
The uh, ooh

1536
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:14,060
Give me that I'm already from this korean fusion place. Oh, fuck. Yeah

1537
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:17,980
Okay, we out here

1538
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:23,740
No, we don't want fucking dash pass although this is very expensive

1539
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:26,320
I'm really sure just go pick this up, but I'm not going to because I want to hang out with you guys

1540
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,280
No

1541
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:33,040
And so

1542
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,120
I was uh, no, this is what I was like

1543
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:43,440
Like seven or I don't know how old I was but like I have a you can't see it anymore because but I have the faintest scar

1544
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:47,920
Um right next to my eyebrow. You can't even tell especially if I wear makeup

1545
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,560
Um, you don't even notice it especially with my hair

1546
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,440
because I have um

1547
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,120
my bangs

1548
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:59,920
Like my little my little side my little bangs and the side bang part like literally how my model is right now

1549
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:08,640
Um, she was a child. No. Yeah, this was yesterday. I just was playing ponies with these kids and slam my head on some

1550
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:11,200
no, um

1551
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,080
That same year I bit piece of my tongue off, but it grew back. So it was fine

1552
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,880
It was good

1553
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,680
Um, you can tell no, you can't

1554
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:26,320
Uh, yeah, so I was sliding down a slide

1555
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:29,440
Um

1556
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,440
And you know like those bumpy slides

1557
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:36,160
I don't know. I'm just Wolverine. Um, I just grow stuff back

1558
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,520
You know those like little slides that have like little dips in them and like waves

1559
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,600
I'm literally moving my arm in a wave and you guys can't see

1560
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:46,160
And um, so when I was going down my knees were up. So my knees

1561
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,960
Um snapped up and hit myself in the jaw. So I bit off

1562
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:53,440
um, like a third of my tongue

1563
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:57,120
But uh

1564
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:00,080
And I was just sitting there screaming blood dripping out of my mouth

1565
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:02,400
And then a kid was like looking at me and he was just like

1566
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:06,640
And I was just like and we were just like screaming at each other and the the manager

1567
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:11,920
The teacher comes over and was like, oh, what the fuck did you do to yourself?

1568
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,800
Can you still eat out? Oh

1569
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,920
Just wait for the that audio that come out on preachy on just you wait

1570
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:24,400
Um, but no it into my tongue looks completely normal

1571
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:30,960
But yeah, I'm grateful and baffled you made it to this point. Um

1572
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,040
Don't lose your head now

1573
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,400
But uh

1574
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:44,960
I'm usually oh one time I was so in this at my school and my my my great school. Um

1575
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:46,720
I

1576
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:51,840
So they're these like wooden chairs that they didn't have like they weren't like the legs weren't separated

1577
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,440
They were just like kind of fused together and like this like cube square thing

1578
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:58,240
And so what they always told you not to do

1579
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,760
was run and push the

1580
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,840
Like don't run with the chairs because they just slide across the rug on the in the library

1581
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,080
So I was like

1582
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:13,120
Fuck my life and I ran with the chair and I pushed it and I flipped over the chair

1583
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:14,720
I

1584
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,720
banged my shin on the um

1585
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,760

and uh

1588
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:28,320
I still have that scar on my shin today. It's I'm and I was probably like

1589
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:32,560
I was super young. I was like in first grade. So I don't even know why I still have it

1590
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,240
Although it's like almost completely gone. Sorry. I'm looking down at it right now

1591
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:40,320
Um

1592
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:44,560
So I'm lucky because all this happened to you at the same time. You're super lucky because you didn't it was

1593
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:48,880
It wasn't even that like I didn't hit my head that bad. I like I've never like I've never

1594
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:51,760

Pull down your pants. Let me knock on some wood

I've never broken a bone on my body. So yeah

1598
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,800
I don't enjoy it

1599
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,800
I don't enjoy

1600
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:14,720
You like my jokes? I'm funny. I'm funny. Women aren't funny. I'm funny, bitch. Get it through your head

1601
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,920

02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,720
Okay, so I ordered my food

1603
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:22,720
Let's see what I'm gonna get here

1604
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,520
Okay, like 30 minutes

1605
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,200
Do do do do

1606
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:34,320
Wait, I didn't click download shit. Oh my god, this will take only a few minutes though. My internet's fast

1607
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:40,560
I need a chat for like two more minutes and I'll be fine. Funny money. Is this how you became a masochist? No

1608
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,120
No

1609
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:45,120
What are you talking about?

1610
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:50,080
I don't know. I don't I do not know what you're referring to. Okay

1611
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:58,000
And today you inflict pain on us. Yeah, you know what comes around goes around and comes around goes around and comes around again

1612
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,360
And comes on you, you know, it happens. That's what happens

1613
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:04,240
blonde moment

1614
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:06,480
Oh, I'm so blonde. You don't even I

1615
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:11,120
I literally I don't think it's when they say like when you're blonde

1616
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:16,160
Or if you dye your hair blonde like the dyes in your head or like when you're blonde

1617
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:20,800
Uh, you're just really yeah, I know it's a fact as someone whose best friend was blonde and I was blonde

1618
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:25,600
We were all blonde. We were just dumb blondes. Like I was in my bimbo era

1619
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:28,240
with my blonde hair

1620
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,560
Switch to almastery

1621
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:34,800
Jamie, why aren't you dominant? What do you want me to know? I'm just a loser. I'm a dork

1622
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,920
But you're more of a loser in a dork. So how does that make you feel? Hmm?

1623
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,800
The game's ready to play only took me a minute

1624
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:44,080
You really are jacka

1625
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:46,080
Stop it. I'm not jacka

1626
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,960
All right

1627
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,360
Oh

1628
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,920
Let's go why am I so fucking huge?

1629
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:13,520
Yee, whoa, why I don't like how this perspective is go outside. Does that just quit the game?

1630
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,560
All right, let's go to options

1631
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:23,600
Okay, so the really I think the biggest difference was everything was voiced wasn't it

1632
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:28,960
Make no mistake. So now I can properly voice stuff. I'm a sociopath

1633
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,360
You might want to show the game. Oh fuck

1634
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,360
I grew up all over coastal america house after house after restraining order

1635
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:41,920
Everything just kind of blends in

1636
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:44,880
I

1637
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:59,280
Would you believe me if I told you that I've been sure seven years

1638
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:08,160
Oh, no, why am I like this?

1639
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:13,920
A month into high school. So the why is meeting on you social leverage was why do you guys follow me?

1640
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:22,400
Or other v-tubers as this like as stuffed it like to be honest like am I am I really the ultimate girl failure out here?

1641
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,280
I can't be right. They're like there has to be someone out there. That's worse than I am

1642
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,080
right

1643
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,560
Please

1644
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,520
Like just just like hope

1645
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:40,560
Sorry, I just looked at my all account. Why isn't it fucking almost seven k

1646
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,840
Jesus Christ

1647
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:48,560
Anyway, so mom was crying packing up the moving boxes. And that's when she told me

1648
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:55,120
And I just got settled. I said, fuck you. I'm living with dad. It's just a narrow way down

1649
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:01,600
I put the boxes down and go over knock on the door and boom a gunshot my second christmas killed himself

1650
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:06,720
I walked in floor look like a whole lot to be okay. Hi. Dakota. Oh, I want to I want

1651
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:10,400
I so I followed her the other day and like mind you. I've also like I've

1652
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:15,520
Always been up to date with a lot of agency v-tubers in my past life. I'm Nicole, by the way

1653
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,760
And I was

1654
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:19,360
um

1655
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:23,120
I remembered I'm like hi like we need a collab

1656
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:24,880
like

1657
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,880
It would be hilarious as fuck if we collab

1658
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:28,800
again

1659
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:34,240
Uh, the power of not being called by youtube. Well, no, no, it was 6k on um on twitter

1660
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:39,840
Although I don't yeah, we haven't been called. I think I think we're good

1661
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:44,880
I'm crossing. I'm knocking on wood again. Pull down your pants. Um

1662
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:48,720
So hopefully we don't get called again because it doesn't seem like we are

1663
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:54,640
Anyways, so I started blasting

1664
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,640
class this year with mr. Burlodey

1665
02:08:56,720 --> 02:09:00,160
Wait, no. Oh my god, that is so funny. What the heck?

1666
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:02,880
They are never funny. It's like the girls just laugh to avoid

1667
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:04,880
Okay, hold on. Let me restart this

1668
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:21,760
Why does the game keep disappearing? Okay, there we go. I think when I click off well

1669
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,720
Jesus Christ

1670
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:35,440
See the game is there house after house after restraining order

1671
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:42,240
Everything just kind of blends in if the divorce rate is 5050. My mom landed on tails like eight times. Jesus christ

1672
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:50,800
Mom gets around different houses and attended six different school districts. We stay technically disabled. Yeah

1673
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:57,360
And see graduation song. Yeah, I can't relate but then one year all of that almost changed

1674
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:02,400
For the first time ever I found myself in a school for two consecutive years going on three

1675
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:09,440
Oh, okay started turning pretty a month into high school. So the dance got big titties social leverage was really awesome

1676
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,480
The popular girls would talk to me all the time. I don't know is

1677
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:16,720
They were stupid. Is jecca or nicole the literally me

1678
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:21,440
Because I don't have like a literally me character like she oh, she's literally me and when I think about it

1679
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:24,640
All the thinking I've ever done was when I was alone

1680
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:28,000
I was nice about it and thought I'd always be nice about it

1681
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:31,120
Finally in one place to build a steady reputation

1682
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:38,240
And then life said fuck that my piece of shit gamer brother got us evicted for pirating breakbeat mixtapes

1683
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:45,040
It's not even good music. Anyway, so mom was crying packing up the movie. Why does it sound like like spoken words?

1684
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:51,200
And I just got settled. I said, fuck you. I'm living with dad. He's just a neighborhood down

1685
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,600
This is like so intense

1686
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:02,640
Oh, so she literally did

1687
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:09,440
Walk into her dad killing himself. I mean whatever he's asking for to know

1688
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:13,120
No

1689
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,800
That's so fucked

1690
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:27,840
I'm moving again. He unalived himself in minecraft state all the same fate

1691
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:32,720
But I've always said that bars fire this time

1692
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:35,520
It's on arrival

1693
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
dead on arrival

1694
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:43,680
Oh, this is the year before hey, so for the senior prank

1695
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:51,120
Why does it keep going this year? Okay, park their cars or we don't usually park them

1696
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:54,160
I don't have a choice

1697
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,840
Yep, yeah, that's usually how it is

1698
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,920
Okay, now it'll pause. Okay

1699
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,960
Can I

1700
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,840
I just want to do the reading

1701
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:25,760
Let me how when do I get to the part where I do the readings myself?

1702
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:28,960
This is the first game

1703
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,440
I just want to voice it myself

1704
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,880
Please

1705
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:40,800
The ui volume that's just the user interface and the scene volume like I don't know why they don't have that as a feature

1706
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:46,320
I mean kind of there's like numbers on the doors. I think I can figure it out. No, no

1707
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,880
I'm a reaction streamer now like like a school tour. You want to do that you after that?

1708
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,880
Hmm

1709
02:12:57,600 --> 02:13:02,960
Should I do the school tour or should I just go to class or because I don't feel like I cut class in like the last one so

1710
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:06,400
I don't want to be a react to her

1711
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:12,320
Scene volume down. Yeah, but it's oh hi rena. She just decided to hop on my lap. Hello, ma'am

1712
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,960
How are you?

1713
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:18,080
I know it's a two. I love to use your own adventures. Um

1714
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:25,600
But it also like I can't it auto plays still like I can't like just like I don't like that auto plays

1715
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:27,600
I want to go at my own pace

1716
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,520
You know

1717
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:35,680
You're insistentively going for the no, I'm not you can mute the voices again. Okay. I guess I will that's fine

1718
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,280
I want to go straight to class

1719
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:45,360
School tour. Um, that sounds nice. I'm mediocre, but I'm just gonna go to class. See you

1722
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,640
Hey

1723
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:03,600
Hey, so uh, I guess I guess we're lab partners, huh?

1724
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,840
Huh, I guess

1725
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:13,600
Huh, not a big talker. Are you I don't know you are you just chill me with everyone you meet

1726
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:19,280
Not everyone, but if they look like the type to like anime then may as well, right

1727
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:25,760
Packs away. I'm sorry. I look like I like anime. No, that's a good thing. It means you're cool and different

1728
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:31,360
In 300 pounds. What was that? Oh, nothing. I was just converting british currency in my head

1729
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:38,160
Cool see, um, well the teacher said I'm jeffrey the teacher the teacher said I'm jeffrey. So that's my name

1730
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,800
Uh, this freak is not getting my name

1731
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:46,800
So what so you'll be up on my space or something? No, thanks

1732
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:51,520
Well, we're gonna get to know each other anyway, right? Probably not probably after this week

1733
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:56,960
We won't even talk anymore. I moved to a lot of different schools. So I'm fully aware using the new kid grace period

1734
02:14:58,320 --> 02:14:59,920
Wait, what?

1735
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:01,920
What's new kid grace period?

1736
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,800
Uh, it's where the outcast squeeze all the interaction they can out of new kids way above their social status

1737
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:08,080
That's so true, though

1738
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:13,920
When the new kids get here, it's awkward. They don't know who's who they'll humor any conversation or friendship until they find the people in their social level

1739
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:19,360
How do you know i'm not in your social level fucking look at you. Listen to how you talk

1740
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:22,800
How do I know i'm not shut the fuck up. Hey, I didn't do anything

1741
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:26,800
I know that's what you will do. I've had my ear talked off about comics laser swords

1742
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:30,640
Larring the age of consents ninja hand signs. I just saw that weird shit

1743
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:35,040
You know, the other pretty girls here a lot nicer than you are

Yeah, a lot of people say i'm funny. Oh, you're funny. Tell me a joke

1746
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:46,720
Oh, well, it's more like in the moment. You kind of had to be there kind of funny

1747
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:50,000
Okay, fuck

1748
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,160
Okay, jeffrey. You want me to save your ears of guessing?

1749
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:58,480
Yeah, sure how they're not laughing at you with you. They're laughing at you because you'll they'll never have sex with you

1750
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:03,280
Ah, I got you there. A lot of the girls here said they're saving their subs themselves for me

1751
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:09,280
Christ they make it that obvious here. Yeah, they're kind of easy if you ask me know it

1752
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Believe what you want. I'm going to lunch

1753
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:19,440
Oh, you feel for jeffrey bless your soul bless your sweetheart. I'm funny. I know I am

1754
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:28,480
God the food here is tragic. Even the air has preservatives fucking tell me about it. So I pack. Oh, sorry. I didn't see you

1755
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:31,680
That's okay. You can stay here. I'm jacka. Where are you from from?

1756
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,440
Uh chemistry, I think I don't know. I don't really do anything

1757
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:40,080
Uh, that sucks. Yeah, you have to like wash acid off you before you can touch your food

1758
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:45,600
I'm not eating it anyway. The guy had to sit next to me scared my appetite away pretty much just me away in general

1759
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:49,760
Who was it? Do you know?

1760
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,440
um jeffrey

1761
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,440
Oh, yeah, he's a fun one

1762
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:56,160
But he's like so overly chummy. That's fun to you

1763
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:01,760
No, like fun the fuck with him. Da freshman year every girl put love notes in his locker, right?

1764
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,680
So he went up to some of the girl's boyfriends like, uh, she's in love with me now

1765
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:08,160
Oh my god, that is funny

1766
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:12,000
But because they're all like 14 three guys just beat the shit out of them for it

1767
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,480
Now we all these stupid anti-bullying rules

1768
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:20,880
I never got how they could like enforce that. It's baby simple. Baby simple. Just be hot and sociable

1769
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:23,600
Fucking accurate. I'm Nicole by the way

1770
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:26,960
Well, I'll see you around Nicole

1771
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:34,800
Nicole you ready for day two? Is someone gonna kill me day two? If so, absolutely

1772
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,360
Why what happened?

1773
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:41,440
Just like waking up in general hurts and I got a deal with my brother who's still up from the night before I'm from eating

1774
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:43,440
a family box of anything

1775
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:47,360
He can eat family size meals. How old is he?

1776
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:50,400
Like 26. He just reloads off my mom

1777
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:57,280
I mean, we kind of reload too, but we're 16. It's cool when we do it. Exactly. I have to tell him when I'm woken up by

1778
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:59,360
loud chewing noises

1779
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,280
Is he fat?

1780
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:03,440
Do you know what x bodybuilder fat is?

1781
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:07,360
Yeah, I kind of know what that looks like. Well, he's an obese monster

1782
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:13,200
I was just curious if anyone else knew that body body filter body filter phrase. He's not that good to know

1783
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:17,520
Hey, let's gossip more at lunch. I gotta get to class dude. Fuck class. Just skip with me

1784
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:22,400
I told you yesterday I never skip anymore and my mom's gonna start giving me disciplinary tattoos

1785
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:28,480
How does that even work? What's she write on you? It'd be some weird shit. Like I love school on my fingers

1786
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:31,280
Isn't that like abusive?

1787
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:34,400
She's the only mom I've ever had. How the fuck should I know?

1788
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:36,800
Huh

1789
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,800
So are you headed?

1790
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:40,000
Oh

1791
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000

1792
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:45,680
Nicole it goes in high school. Which was cruel as fuck. I'm not gonna lie

1793
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:48,720
I was one of those fucking weird kids like

1794
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:56,640
Because you know, I rolled up. I liked anime drew on my notebooks drew like anime shit and um

1795
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:05,280
Uh, I remember I got bullied for being a lesbian just because I hung out with the group of girls

1796
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:08,640
And I was which doesn't make any sense because I'm like you hang out with girls, too

1797
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:15,280
Um, and I was also like I looked like a fucking rat. I looked like I looked like ass now

1798
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:20,480
I'm hot as fuck, but Jesus christ. So yeah, like kids kids are harsh

1799
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:24,640
I was I was definitely the female Jeffrey. I'm not gonna lie. Um

1800
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:29,680
Don't girls usually hang out in packs. You're right. I was also first read books. I was reading books

1801
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:31,760
I was so socially awkward

1802
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:33,840
I couldn't talk to anybody. Um

1803
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:37,360
I was definitely like the follower in the friend group like I would just sit there

1804
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:39,120
Just sit with the girls and be like

1805
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,120
Yay, I'm

1806
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:43,280

1807
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:48,720
My mom like really hated these girls. I like and when I say friends

1808
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:54,160
I say really loosely because um, I was friends with like loosely with these mean girls

1809
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:58,880
And I was definitely the friend they kept around like, you know how there's always like that one person in the friend group

1810
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:01,680
um

1811
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:06,880
They keep around just to like shit on like there's always that one person. I was that person

1812
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:11,440
I was definitely that fucking person. Yeah, you can always tell people who peaked in high school

1813
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:15,440
Yeah, I see these people because like I still live where I grew up and I'm just like, oh, wow

1814
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:18,640
You work at an ice cream stand

1815
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:23,120

Yeah, now I'm like I have like when you're an adult you like

1818
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:42,080
Sometimes like, you know, I took I still took a lot of work. You kind of build up that confidence to

1819
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:45,920
Really hang out with people that are your friends and that you like

1820
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:48,720
Um, why am I so small in the corner?

1821
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:53,920
There you go

1822
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Yeah, but I took a lot of effort to be as the people are like, oh

Literally working my retail job forced me to come out of my shell and also give me a wake-up call because I was so

1825
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:13,440
severely sheltered being a religious

1826
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:15,520

1894
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:29,040
Hold on. I have to look back at my vaude because I didn't know what he said

1895
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,200
Uh, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up self

1896
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:38,240
Come on. No, I think I think I'm behind in my own vaude. I am

1897
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:45,360
Okay, do I want to hang out should we hang out with him? I'm gonna I'm gonna have you guys help me with this one

1898
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:47,520
Should he does he have no chance?

1899
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:50,640
Because I'm gonna play through stuff. I'm not gonna save and go back because that's stupid

1900
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:53,840
Kyler, please I'm begging

1901
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:56,160
Nope. No, okay. Let's put it to a vote. Let's put it to a vote

1902
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,960
Kyler yes or no

1903
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:07,120
I'm gonna wait for that. I'm gonna look at see where my food is

1904
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:10,080
Oh, it's heading to me

1905
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:16,080
Oh, it's all the way it'll be here in 10 minutes

1906
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:26,160
We stay indecisive he's the stupidest character in game. That's kind of funny grill him

1907
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:30,320
Would you order? Um, I'll tell you when it gets here

1908
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:32,320
Oh

1909
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,600
My tummy is like I've literally only had applesauce. What the fuck is wrong with me?

1910
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:46,000
Before you dig in snap a photo of your food. No, I'm fucking eating that shit. You kidding me door ash. I got it here

1911
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:49,520
Dumb golden retriever type energy she be for

1912
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:55,920
Can we put the gym teacher six feet under in facts? That's so gross for real

1913
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:01,440
No, I'm gnomes. No, okay. Dipsha has no chance with me

1914
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:08,560
Good night

1915
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:11,200
Are you seriously asking me out while taking dodgeball seriously?

1916
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:16,160
No, I mean, well, kind of it could just be sex. We don't need like a whole relationship

1917
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:22,960
Oh, sorry. I don't know the politically correct way of asking this, but are you actually retarded?

1918
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:29,040
I don't know who told you but when I got tested that was supposed to be a secret fucking trolley. Can't keep us

1919
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:34,080
Don't clip it

1920
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:36,960
Don't

1921
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:40,320
Your quintessential dipshit don't fucking do it

1922
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:47,680
If you do it, I'm ending the stream right now

1923
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,520
I'm not even fucking with you

1924
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:54,960
I

1925
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:58,480
I'm ending it

1926
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:00,800
Ended by everybody

1927
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:03,200
streams done

1928
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:04,720
All right

1929
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:07,840
I'll see you guys around. It's been great. I'm gonna go eat some food

1930
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:10,800
Uh, let's see

1931
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:18,720
Oh, no, fuck you guys I'll play

1932
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,680
I

1933
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,200
Hate all of you

1934
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:27,200
Quinn, uh, I don't know what the fuck that means, but I'm gonna kick your ass. I'm a girl. Don't fucking hurt me

1935
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:30,080
Actually, no

1936
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:32,800
Honestly, if I if I hit a guy, I'd totally expect him to hit me back

1937
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:35,760
I beat the shit out of my mom

1938
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:39,600
Get the nerd in on it. I feel like that won't matter. I don't think he'll let me

1939
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:45,040
Let him simmer down. I feel like yeah, because I was mean to him. He won't do anything for me

1940
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:48,160
Let's get a fucking beat up

1941
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:53,200
I would I would if I if I got I would totally get the shit over a guy though

1942
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:56,880
I'm a strong bitch

1943
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:02,720
Okay, whatever you're the only party who cares in this anyway. Yeah, don't test me again. There's gonna be trouble now

1944
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:04,720
I got balls to dodge

1945
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,960
Why does everyone in the closet want to kill me?

1946
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:13,200
What's that

1947
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,280
What's what the gym clothes

1948
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,480
Oh, yeah, the heat's cranked way too high here. So I just left class in this. I can finally breathe, you know

1949
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:25,360
Okay, well, you're the first girl I've ever met who isn't cold 24 seven

1950
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:28,400
Yep, not cold at all

1951
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,640
I am actually

1952
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:35,840
Canonically, I'm cold 24 seven. Um, I don't my customers when I worked in sales

1953
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:40,880
Tell me I probably have what is it called reinoids syndrome or renaud syndrome

1954
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:43,600
Because my fingers turn white

1955
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,600
When I'm really cold

1956
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:49,840
And I lose a feeling in my lens. Well, mostly my fingies

1957
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:52,560
He he

1958
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:54,960
He he who who

1959
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,920
Ho ho ho he he

1960
02:30:58,160 --> 02:31:00,160
Hold on. Let me see where my food is at

1961
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:03,440
Oh my god, please

1962
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,840
Oh, they're so close

1963
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:16,720
Don't click what don't be an asshole

1964
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:27,440
That will

1965
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:30,720
She be you can't eat on stream. Fuck it. We ball

1966
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:36,720
A skip's changing to get out what let's throw it away. What about you?

1967
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,880
He asked me out and I'm pretty clearly told him to screw off

1968
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:41,920
It's like white guys who like running can't take no for an answer

1969
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:48,800
I wish I had like five percent of your confidence. How's that confidence blatantly telling some scary dude to get lost?

1970
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:50,960
I could never do that

1971
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,920
It's not that I'm confident. I'm just too lazy to give a shit facts

1972
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:57,120
True

1973
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:59,120
It's either I'm too lazy or I'm too crazy

1974
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:01,760
Months later

1975
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:08,960
So it's been a few months since we moved to school going like academically or socially

1976
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:14,400
Everything anything honestly it's going pretty good

1977
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:18,560
It looks like she didn't have any arms for a second because

1978
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:20,480
the

1979
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:22,480
color of the background

1980
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:24,880
Nothing's a burden

1981
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:31,600
Yeah, I'll turn on the the audio like the voice acting stuff when um my food gets here like I'll put it like this

1982
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,880
Anytime I got asked for my company asked me out or asked or anything

1983
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:38,800
And I make decisions entirely for myself not concerned with their feelings. There's no stress

1984
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:41,920
Damn, she's a bad bitch

1985
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:44,480
Honey, that sounds a little mean-spirited. Don't you think?

1986
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:48,640
Yeah, well, what's the alternative of being used to do shit people

1987
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:53,440
Especially men are for the perfect pawns when you don't give a fuck about them or whatever they want

1988
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:59,440
I won't argue as

1989
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:07,280
Half the all my viewers leave because they hear me say that they're just like what she be

1990
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:14,640
Because there's feminism you vote and work. Okay, well fuck feminism. I'm starting necolism

1991
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:19,600
Necolism. Yeah, the main concept is girls are moving all emotional attachment from anyone

1992
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:23,600
Oh, I'm sure you'll meet a nice boy soon. You'll be all over this

1993
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:29,120
How can I meet a nice boy when all men are just rapists and pedophiles is fucking kids nice mom?

1994
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
This conversation's over

1995
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Oh

1996
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:39,360
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god

1997
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,040
Hold on. Let me pause. Who the fuck is this guy?

1998
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:52,080
Okay, my food's here. Let me run. I'm gonna be our be real quick. Go get it. Um and come back

1999
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,640
Let me just stretch

2000
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:59,200
E

2001
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:08,240
All right, see you in a moment love

2002
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,640
You

2003
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,640
You

2004
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,640
You

2005
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:58,640
You

2006
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:28,640
You

2007
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:58,640
You

2008
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,640
You

2009
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:58,640
You

2010
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:28,640
You

2011
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:58,640
You

2012
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:28,640
You

2013
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:30,640
You

2014
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:56,560
Okay

2015
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:00,640
Uh

2016
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:17,760
So, you know how door dash like I'm like if someone doesn't speak English usually like auto translate

2017
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:21,360
So they do this Spanish and so I think my person was Spanish and they just

2018
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:24,720
They just said here I am

2019
02:40:25,360 --> 02:40:27,360
And I'm like, okay

2020
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:35,760
And then I was gonna go to the elevator to go downstairs and then he just shows up. He's like here I am and I'm like

2021
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:43,520
And it was funny he looked at me he was like, oh

2022
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:45,920
Because I look like a rat right now

2023
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:50,560
I look like shit. I'm wearing just wearing a pair of fucking booty shorts and a sweatshirt

2024
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:53,120
My hair's a mess. I still haven't showered

2025
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:55,600
Probably shower after this

2026
02:40:58,320 --> 02:41:00,320
Okay, let me move my keyboard

2027
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:12,240
Gracias mi amor. Yeah. Hello me. I'm me. I'm your mi amor. There's no ice in here

2028
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:16,560
I'm probably eliminated and put no ice in it

2029
02:41:18,480 --> 02:41:20,480
Shower stream one. I've already done that

2030
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:24,160
Not like in a stream, but I did record myself in the shower

2031
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:26,400
Okay

2032
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:28,960
I've actually already forgot what I got

2033
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:31,760
I got

2034
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:34,880
Sandwich so it's a mac and cheese chicken sandwich

2035
02:41:36,480 --> 02:41:43,440
Then I got what is this? Oh, it's sauce boomie. Can you fuck off dude? You don't have boomie is

2036
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:49,200
One of those cats that oh, I need to lock my door. What is this? Oh, it's marinara sauce

2037
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:52,560
um

2038
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:55,460
Boomie's one of those cats that just like has to be a part of everything

2039
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:05,920
Door locks

2040
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:14,480
And then I also got some

2041
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:19,200
Sammy spicy no, it's like kind of spicy

2042
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,640
It's not this it's not the spicy one. It's the mac and cheese

2043
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:26,240
What is this?

2044
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:29,040
Oh, this is I'm definitely gonna have a lot of leftovers. Um

2045
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:32,240
It's like mozzarella sticks

2046
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:35,600
But they're made with ontons

2047
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:38,560
Oh

2048
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:44,800
Blooming I'm gonna fight you

2049
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:55,760
And then I have some tater tots with parmesan

2050
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:03,760
One bite

2051
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:11,200
Boomi's literally looking at me and looking at his lips. Boomi likes french fries. He steals french fries from me

2052
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:31,760
There was no three, what are you talking about? I should probably have a napkin here

2053
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:35,680
Cause I'm probably gonna spill something in myself. Oh, I'll just use this blanket

2054
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:40,240
This is a towel, right blanket

2055
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:47,840
If three gang ever emerges, what is this random role play going on?

2056
02:43:53,440 --> 02:43:55,440
Mmm, that's so good

2057
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:06,800
I'm probably going to have the worst stomach ache later from all this cheese

2058
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:20,400
Cute bunny, hello

2059
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:36,400
Hey guys having fun rp-ing in the chat game of thrones house one and house two and the unknown house house three

2060
02:44:41,440 --> 02:44:43,840
I have lactate. I just didn't take any because I'm dumb

2061
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:51,120
Are you lactose intolerance? Yeah

2062
02:44:57,280 --> 02:45:03,920
Well, this is the the mozzarella stick. I'll take a bite of the um, I'll take a picture of the sandwich so you guys can see what I'm eating

2063
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:09,200
Wait

2064
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:12,800
Now my phone is using to being used to record. Never mind. You can't see

2065
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:16,080
I

2066
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:25,120
I get diarrhea when I drink chocolate milk nobody asked

2067
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:31,040
But only chocolate milk. I don't think you should drink chocolate milk then bro

2068
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:41,040
I I'm not the one who lactates that is a zura

2069
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:47,200
Lactosians, what are you talking about?

2070
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:55,600
Hope you'll be all right after all the cheese you're consuming. I'll probably die later

2071
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:58,080
I'm probably fight for my life on the toilet later. No worries

2072
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:04,560
You could at least try

2073
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:06,640
What?

2074
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:10,800
What's going on here? That's what I'm asking. That's what I'm asking bro. What is going on here?

2075
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:14,720
She's 56. Can she still lactate? Yep

2076
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:20,800
Okay, let me take a bite of the sandwich. Oh my god, it looks so fucking good

2077
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:37,280
Oh my god, oh the spicy fuck. Oh no. Yeah, I'm not gonna have a fun time later

2078
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:42,800
I

2079
02:46:56,480 --> 02:46:58,480
Looks so funny when I eat food

2080
02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:00,640
When I drink something

2081
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:03,760
Um, oh my god, spicy. No, I forgot it was spicy

2082
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:08,800
So what it is it's a nap. Yeah, just say it's a garlic mac and cheese

2083
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:11,760
Um

2084
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:18,240
On it like a on a chicken fried chicken sandwich

2085
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:23,040
Pretty bomb

2086
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:33,040
No two one but one also technically one because two was spicy and I forgot it was

2087
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:46,160
Well, it's just a bun, you know, it's just a bun then the fried chicken then a little bit of mac and cheese and then that

2088
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:50,400
So was the hidden third option

2089
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:55,520
I need a bar. Oh my god, boomi. What are you doing?

2090
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,080
brother

2091
02:47:58,080 --> 02:47:59,840
brother, what are you doing?

2092
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:01,840
Why are you playing the paper clip?

2093
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:03,360
boomi

2094
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:05,360
Are you serious?

2095
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:09,680
Why? Oh my god, he's a menace in society. I need a burp

2096
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:14,080
I hid it from you. You don't deserve my burps

2097
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:22,400
I need to take off my shirt. I'm getting hot. Oh my god a bird just flew really close by my window

2098
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:28,480
Two gang is just a palm. Okay, let's let's watch tv

2099
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:31,680
While I eat

2100
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:35,600
Could you lock your door? I did lock my door. Why are you knocking on it? I'm gonna come visit

2101
02:48:53,920 --> 02:48:55,920
Wait, can I go back?

2102
02:48:57,440 --> 02:48:59,440
Okay

2103
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:01,520
Couple months later

2104
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:28,400
Oh

2105
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
I

2106
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:41,840
Feel like the he can't tell you what to do will cause him to probably like send me to the principal's office

2107
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:45,520
Passive aggressive eye roll

2108
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:50,720
Mr. White can get it on guys that his name mr. White

2109
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:54,640
You trust my instincts

2110
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:57,040
I'm gonna be a bitch

2111
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:07,520
How dare you how dare you disrupt my lecture. It's disrespectful to me and your classmates

2112
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:12,720
You can't trick anyone here. Is he Walter white when no one gives a shit about your class in the first place

2113
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:18,960
Well, how would you like a failing grade? How would all of you like a failing grade?

2114
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:21,520
Yeah, the girl to the right is kind of hot

2115
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:26,400
Yeah, mr. White, you can't keep us from graduating you tell him the call. Yeah, you tell him

2116
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:30,880
You finger skateboard bitch. Oh, I was just trying to help. Yeah, you were trying something

2117
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:35,600
I can visit to the counselor's office the principal's office

2118
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:39,760
Hey, if you think not listening to you talk is disciplined, then I'm gone. No problem

2119
02:50:40,160 --> 02:50:42,160
out

2120
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,840
Again, Nicole. Oh, not the counselor. Every time you said a lot of stuff so I can leave early

2121
02:50:50,400 --> 02:50:53,360
The principal ordered for you to be in this room for one hour

2122
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:57,520
I like how the principal's purse is like in the chair. You'll see them slapping the shit on

2123
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:00,080
And what do you mean by that?

2124
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:04,640
How are you feeling? I'm saying if a whole company like them can't get my order, right?

2125
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:09,280
Then what's one guy like you? Mistakes happen. They can try again after the next soccer practice

2126
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:12,160
I think we go to Mr. White supremacist. Wait, what?

2127
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:19,520
I fucking derailed this shit talking out of turn in class bullying classmates talking back to faculty

2128
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:23,360
Is this really are you gonna kill me? Why am I leaving behind a legacy?

2129
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,200
It's high school who gives a shit fact

2130
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:37,360
Show some light on everyone else. Hmm like I would just like tell him off like about what everybody else does

2131
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:42,240
Probably about the gym teacher. It's high school. I'm gonna do that

2132
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:46,080
Say that to all the guys who go here. It's like a co-ed prison without tattoos

2133
02:51:46,480 --> 02:51:52,080
Do you think it's a tad irresponsible to point fingers at others when you're the one in question here

2134
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:57,120
Aren't you mr. Child psychologist like trauma and all that shapes who we are?

2135
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:01,040
Well, yes, I have several degrees in pediatric psychology

2136
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:07,520
What's your point every dude here is like a rapist or a drug addict or trying to turn you into a drug addict

2137
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:12,560
Have you tried something? What are you doing? I understand you not try to play in my wires

2138
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:15,280
I just feel like you're gonna shut off my computer. He's like real cold on

2139
02:52:16,080 --> 02:52:17,360
teacher or

2140
02:52:17,360 --> 02:52:19,360
No, no, no get shoot

2141
02:52:19,360 --> 02:52:21,520
He was like dangerously close

2142
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:22,960
to

2143
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:26,720
My power outlet where like the switch would just turn off everything. So if I disappear

2144
02:52:28,160 --> 02:52:33,200
In stream just dies. That is the reason why boomie. What is the matter mr?

2145
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:37,280
Why don't you go play with fia?

2146
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:39,520
Hi

2147
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:42,800
It's important. What's wrong? Okay, let me go get him a toy to play with

2148
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:48,800
I have the pee

2149
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:53,120
Okay, let me pee and get him a toy

2150
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:18,080
You

2151
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:48,080
You

2152
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:18,800
You

2153
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:23,600
All right, can you bitch just stop warping in the chat for the love of god the joke is done

2154
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:29,520
I was making the shiba aid. Oh, it's pretty good

2155
02:54:30,640 --> 02:54:31,840
real quick

2156
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:36,000
You might hear like some noises in the background because I gave my cats their toys so that they'll play

2157
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:39,200
Reina's sleeping nicely by my feet because she is a good old lady

2158
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
at the ripe age of 14

2159
02:54:42,560 --> 02:54:43,600
and then

2160
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:48,240
Boomi and fia are fucking about in my closet playing with a spring toy

2161
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:57,360
Teachers are trying to fuck me too. You're all psychotic a few months ago

2162
02:54:57,360 --> 02:55:01,200
Mr. Burlodey was really feeling up one of my friends and just last week

2163
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:03,920
The coach was staring down my shirt during push-up tests

2164
02:55:04,240 --> 02:55:09,760
I tried to level with all my students. So can you really blame him? They really like that spring toy

2165
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:11,760
That's your favorite toy

2166
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:14,240
Low cut here

2167
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:21,040
Go on honestly her outfit is fine. We're looking away the entire time you've been here. Oh my god. That's so fucked

2168
02:55:22,560 --> 02:55:25,360
Are you kidding me right now? Where's the hidden camera? What show is this?

2169
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:32,400
You're like acting for a prank show, right? I'm waiting for someone more attractive than you to walk in so I can pretend to laugh

2170
02:55:32,800 --> 02:55:36,640
Nicole there's no prank here. Oh, so you're just seriously a pedophile

2171
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:42,480
He's right here. Did we ever have our little chat on social constructs? I'm leaving

2172
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Oh my fucking god

2173
02:55:46,240 --> 02:55:51,680
So fuck photography. Yeah pretty much mr. White acts like his class is so goddamn important

2174
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:56,080
We can take pictures with a camera phone who even needs a camera camera anymore

2175
02:55:56,320 --> 02:56:01,760
Exactly message electives get so insecure when they realize they can't stop anyone from graduating

2176
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:07,840
It'd be happy anyone even took your class. It's an art course. Anyway, I like doing your makeups a huge step down

2177
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
What's up you whores? Wow

2178
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:12,800
I'm gonna spit on my drink

2179
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:21,120
What do you want all right damn hold on you shit. Wow. What's up you whores?

2180
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:31,040
That's actually me when I enter any sort of call. Oh my god, the sandwich is so fucking spicy

2181
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:33,200
with the girls

2182
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:35,200
That's how I walk in the call

2183
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:40,080
What's up you whores

2184
02:56:41,440 --> 02:56:49,280
I heard something fall. I think my cats are oh my god. I'm dying. Okay, so I'm drooling. Oh my god. This is so fucking

2185
02:56:53,360 --> 02:56:55,360
Oh, why is it so spicy?

2186
02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:58,720
I can't I can't

2187
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:00,720
I

2188
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:02,720
Oh my god

2189
02:57:03,760 --> 02:57:09,120
I swear to god the sandwich is not spicy. Why is this spicy now? Should I accidentally click spicy in my order?

2190
02:57:11,760 --> 02:57:13,760
I remember

2191
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:16,880
No, I'm really fighting for my life

2192
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:27,280
I can't I can't handle spice I get that from my mom actually know my mom can handle spice and soak in my dad

2193
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:29,680
So I don't even know why I can't handle spice

2194
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:33,920
Oh my god, the burp is like sucking my fucking throat

2195
02:57:52,960 --> 02:57:54,960
Well, I just got lightheaded

2196
02:57:57,600 --> 02:57:59,600
I

2197
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:07,680
Let me go get some milk and then I'm gonna go on a live myself in Minecraft

2198
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:23,760
I'm dying

2199
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
It's not supposed to parts

2200
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:35,040
I just bought it though. Oh, yeah, it's fine

2201
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:42,320
Oh

2202
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:45,600
Oh my god, you got your spring

2203
02:58:48,320 --> 02:58:52,320
Okay, yeah, I've only taken like a few bites of that sandwich and I think I'm done

2204
02:58:52,320 --> 02:58:54,320
I

2205
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,160
Need some milk

2206
02:58:59,600 --> 02:59:03,840
The cats are just walking around playing with their toys boomies playing in a plastic bag. What's his spring?

2207
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:09,280
Can I have it? Can you can you what my sandwich? No

2208
02:59:11,440 --> 02:59:16,000
I'm throwing that motherfucker in the air fryer tomorrow tomorrow. I'm gonna fight for my life tomorrow too actually

2209
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:19,840
Oh my god, I can't stop hiccuping

2210
02:59:23,280 --> 02:59:25,280
Oh my god, there's so much spit in my mouth

2211
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
I can blow bubbles

2212
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:38,960
I just drooled

2213
02:59:44,560 --> 02:59:49,520
So how are you guys doing you having fun I'm enjoying myself I think

2214
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:58,800
I feel like I got punched in the stomach. Oh, it's fine. The spice must flow fears the mind to live

2215
03:00:00,960 --> 03:00:02,800
Those movies are good actually

2216
03:00:02,800 --> 03:00:06,720
All right, dude was good book. Actually, no, I didn't end up. Did I finish dude? Did I finish reading dude?

2217
03:00:07,360 --> 03:00:09,600
I don't think I did. I think I got like halfway

2218
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:17,840
Streams can be a criminal stream's been a criminal disaster in all the best weas

2219
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:20,640
Or just ball

2220
03:00:20,640 --> 03:00:23,760
Barbie wish you be I'm playing Hades too. Oh, I want to play Hades

2221
03:00:24,480 --> 03:00:26,640
How I said I would like it. I'm still panting

2222
03:00:27,360 --> 03:00:30,640
Dune books get weird. I know a spot. Yeah, I don't have a spice dollars

2223
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:34,960
My ethnicity failed me

2224
03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:38,720
And I'm like

2225
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:41,120
My white mother could handle spice way better than me

2226
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:46,480
Well, you know what I blame my mom because apparently I don't know why I'm talking like this

2227
03:00:46,560 --> 03:00:48,560
You know, I'm not talking like Cartman

2228
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:51,360
but um

2229
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:53,360
But it's the only way I can feel like

2230
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:57,120
My mouth is okay. Um, so my mom when she was pregnant with me

2231
03:00:58,880 --> 03:01:02,000
Only a bottle of chicken wings because I was there like grave

2232
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:06,320
So I think because of all the spicy food. I just can't handle spicy food

2233
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
I don't know

2234
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:12,480
Hades is goaded

2235
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:15,680
Crazy respect my authority

2236
03:01:17,280 --> 03:01:23,280
You might hear Fia meowing in the background because she gets really excited when she plays and she starts meowing at herself

2237
03:01:24,960 --> 03:01:26,960
Little girl, what are you doing?

2238
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:32,560

03:01:45,360 --> 03:01:47,600
Just because you guys are shitting on me so much

2242
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:55,200
Yeah, if you hear that little like chat like noise in the background, that's um, I'm playing with the springs on my

2243
03:01:59,440 --> 03:02:03,680
Good god, I'm lifting up your glasses. I'm spitting in your face right in the eyes

2267
03:03:59,520 --> 03:04:02,560
Actually experiment let's do it

2268
03:04:02,560 --> 03:04:04,560
Yeah

2269
03:04:07,920 --> 03:04:09,920
Live tweeting

2270
03:04:10,480 --> 03:04:12,480
I forgot to say I was

2271
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:14,720
I forgot to say I was live

2272
03:04:16,160 --> 03:04:18,480
I always forget to tweet that I'm live

2273
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:26,080
I'm gonna have to start how your management tweet for me and be like saying when I'm live

2274
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:28,640
It's been three hours

2275
03:04:29,600 --> 03:04:34,880
Oh, my neighbor probably helped hates me because I've been yelling a bunch. Actually, I don't even know if they're home

2276
03:04:44,400 --> 03:04:46,400
Testing it

2277
03:04:46,480 --> 03:04:51,600
Okay, let me move my food that I'm not going to be able to finish to the side because I am dying

2278
03:04:52,400 --> 03:04:56,400
I barely even ate anything. I literally only ate like a couple mozzarella sticks

2279
03:04:56,560 --> 03:04:59,840
And that's what I ate and some tater dots. You know if you buy somebody so much

2280
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:02,640
um

2281
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:09,840
Because my alt is blowing up for no reason

2282
03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:15,680
I am going to

2283
03:05:17,440 --> 03:05:20,800
Mess with the algorithm

2284
03:05:21,920 --> 03:05:23,920
here

2285
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:26,560
And say something about porn

2286
03:05:33,200 --> 03:05:36,000
Why is twitter pushing porn, I don't know

2287
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:41,840
Also follow my alt

2288
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
At she be

2289
03:05:46,160 --> 03:05:48,160
And

2290
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:58,160
You gotta you gotta play the game you gotta you gotta play the stonks, you know, I'm still dying

2291
03:06:08,400 --> 03:06:13,840
Because uh twitter likes that word now

2292
03:06:16,240 --> 03:06:18,480
Oh my god, my tummy is rumbling bad

2293
03:06:22,720 --> 03:06:24,720
All right

2294
03:06:25,680 --> 03:06:27,680
Oh, no, actually they banned it for a little bit

2295
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Oh

2296
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:39,360
Guys, I think I think getting this food was a bad idea. I don't feel so good

2297
03:06:39,360 --> 03:06:41,360
I

2298
03:06:43,440 --> 03:06:45,440
Mean dummy heart

2299
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:56,800

2300
03:06:57,520 --> 03:07:03,120
My high pitch voice comes out when I mean they should be excited or super fucked up

2301
03:07:03,120 --> 03:07:08,320

03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:29,520

Like a good little puppy

2310
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:08,880
Fucking prick fucking hell fucking dumb asses bitches. I hate you all

2311
03:08:14,400 --> 03:08:18,320
No, you should talk and mr. White. Yeah, he probably deserves it

2312
03:08:18,960 --> 03:08:24,320
What do you want? All right, damn. Did you guys get an invite to kelly's poll party poll party?

2313
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:28,240
No, her parents are like really rich. It's glass and and everything. It's kind of actually fucking cool

2314
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:34,000
They got those four foot long syringe water gun things. What are you 10? Whatever

2315
03:08:36,960 --> 03:08:40,240
I've been here for a year and never once heard of someone having sex with you

2316
03:08:40,480 --> 03:08:45,440
I've been here since third grade and haven't heard it. No, uh, remember freshman year with jenny philmore

2317
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:47,600
She was unconscious. How do you still brag?

2318
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:52,880
That's so fast like the reason they have women's college. Okay old news. Whatever you have invites or not

2319
03:08:53,280 --> 03:08:56,320
Yeah, let me too. How did you get one? You haven't even been here

2320
03:08:56,320 --> 03:09:01,520
Because i'm a cool ass bitch. That's why I'm not fat facts. Okay. Well, like her belts

2321
03:09:02,240 --> 03:09:07,600
I used to have belts like that if I can't go. I don't want to be responsible for you ruining the party

2322
03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:10,880
But I also want to listen. I'm a tomboy. I really like boys

2323
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:13,680
Nicole's choice fine

2324
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:18,560
Nicole, I know I think I'm getting better, but could you let me go with you just this once?

2325
03:09:19,600 --> 03:09:21,600
I've worn

2326
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,640
I've worn three belts at once

2327
03:09:25,440 --> 03:09:27,440
three belts

2328
03:09:28,080 --> 03:09:32,800
With this this voice sounds better when I put this little mouth on

2329
03:09:33,440 --> 03:09:35,440
Yeah

2330
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:39,120
Choose the top

2331
03:09:40,080 --> 03:09:42,080
Well, yeah, I was planning on it

2332
03:09:45,440 --> 03:09:52,240
Yeah, no, fuck off fine. Be a bitch. See if I care you're just mad. You can't see us in bikinis this weekend

2333
03:09:52,480 --> 03:09:57,200
What are you doing? What don't get flustered like that. He's a rapist sex turns

2334
03:09:57,360 --> 03:10:03,760
Rapist right to those types. What like choking and biting that and jerking off while thinking about us suddenly turning into

2335
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:08,000
Jekyll would look so hot with her organs gouged out. Hell. Yeah. How do you know these things?

2336
03:10:08,400 --> 03:10:10,720
I had a brother. You had up. Is he dead?

2337
03:10:12,080 --> 03:10:17,680
Did you fucking kill your brother? Are you wearing to Kelly's pool party? Well summer's over. So no, we're selling anything

2338
03:10:17,840 --> 03:10:20,160
Hello girls. Oh fucking this guy again

2339
03:10:20,240 --> 03:10:27,760
Pool party in the fall? Yeah. Well, I don't know Jeffery mode. My place is Jeffery mode. I could help you out with that

2340
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:34,400
You sell bikinis? Of course not. But swing by my office later and we can take some measurements for the homex sewing club

2341
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:36,400
Oh my god, this guy creeps me out so bad

2342
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:42,960
To your every curve. Gee. Thanks. I'll see you there. Maybe have a good day at school

2343
03:10:44,880 --> 03:10:48,880
Yes, I know her brother's fucking alive. It was a fucking rhetorical question. You idiots

2344
03:10:49,600 --> 03:10:54,320
What are you guys freaking out about? I think the counselor might have made an advance at me

2345
03:10:54,400 --> 03:10:56,400
They're made in advance. Who says that?

2346
03:10:58,320 --> 03:11:05,040
Yawn, what else is new? What? You've gone here longer than me. How did you not notice? To be fair, he's kind of subtle about it

2347
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:07,840
He's what I call a marathon pedophile

2348
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:16,320
Sorry, but what the fuck is a marathon? Fuck, I got a toot. He tries to make you question society's hatred of pedophilia before he actually

2349
03:11:16,480 --> 03:11:22,560
molests you then you'll feel bad. That's actually really fucked up. So he guilt you so he can make a routine out of it

2350
03:11:22,880 --> 03:11:27,280
Exactly a predator. Are you the same age as the count? Is the counselor 56?

2351
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:31,920
That's like three levels worse than what I thought he was gonna do. I don't know. Why do you even want to measure you anyway?

2352
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:38,400
For bikini to wear a killie's pool party. He'd have home ec make it home ec. What are they gonna make a fucking felt bathing?

2353
03:11:38,400 --> 03:11:40,400
Yeah, I was like, how are you gonna make anything?

2354
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:44,160
Okay, I think I'm good. I think it's yeah

2355
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:50,400
You planned on swimming at a pool party. What do you do at a pool party sit around and look cute same?

2356
03:11:51,120 --> 03:11:53,120
Yeah, that's yeah

2357
03:11:53,920 --> 03:11:55,920
Never been to a pool party, but sure

2358
03:11:56,720 --> 03:12:02,400
The school saw no one steals shit anyway. You still aren't dressed. Yeah, they need thumbprint scanners or some shit

2359
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:07,200
It's 2008. Isn't it the future by now? You're gonna be late. No shit

2360
03:12:07,920 --> 03:12:11,600
Now how many spends again? Oh wait, hold on. Nailed it. What the fuck?

2361
03:12:12,320 --> 03:12:15,600
There's no lock on the doors saw it as a great opportunity

2362
03:12:28,960 --> 03:12:32,960
Choke him out if that happened to me. I'm sorry. Do you think you're cool right now?

2363
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:39,760
You're a freak not even the sex being counselor wants to fuck you your petty insults will make the development of this photograph

2364
03:12:39,840 --> 03:12:41,840
All the more satisfying

2365
03:12:41,920 --> 03:12:48,560
Cam girls are all cheap digital nonsense. I've captured your I'm cheap digital nonsense. That's me

2366
03:12:48,720 --> 03:12:50,720
I'm cheap digital nonsense

2367
03:12:54,480 --> 03:12:59,120
Yeah, if you're gonna sexually harass me could you not talk like a cartoon character while you do it

2368
03:12:59,440 --> 03:13:01,440
I do what I want with my words

2369
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:08,080
I'll also do as I please with this photo. No, come on. Just throw the film out. I'm afraid I can't do that

2370
03:13:08,560 --> 03:13:14,080
Every boy with a crush on you should pay top dollar for these prints. That I would literally kill him

2371
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:20,640
No, I should have been nice to him. Oh, no

2372
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:33,600
You won't convince me otherwise runs away. Wait, was I at the wrong locker? Oh my god, you're all really

2373
03:13:38,080 --> 03:13:41,680
I need a lock on that door. Thanks hindsight. So what the fuck do I do right now?

2374
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:44,560
This is gonna ruin my life. Well, technically isn't that like

2375
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:50,080
Child pornography if it takes a picture and tries to spread it has a picture of my titties halfway out

2376
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:57,040
Yeah, they'll probably find a way to make it your fault. Anyway, I still can't believe he shot it on medium format film of all

2377
03:13:58,400 --> 03:14:04,640
Look, I'm just worried about the print the film type parents in the 70s. Wait, like film film

2378
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:09,200
Like it needs to be Jeffrey's Jeffrey's a very nice guy up to tomorrow's film club

2379
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:15,600
That bitch no lab. No developing if it's some weird format. There won't be another one for miles and miles, right?

2380
03:14:16,240 --> 03:14:18,160
Destroying the dark room

2381
03:14:18,160 --> 03:14:22,320
But I get expelled for that if you go in after everybody leaves no one needs to know

2382
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:25,760
Just wear gloves or something so you don't leave finger. Oh smart

2383
03:14:26,640 --> 03:14:32,640
If I have any very smart. No, it's not my ass on film. Come on. I'd help if it was you

2384
03:14:33,280 --> 03:14:35,040
No, you wouldn't

2385
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:36,640
Okay, I wouldn't but

2386
03:14:36,640 --> 03:14:37,600
God damn it

2387
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:41,200
Is it really the end of the world if people see you in your underwear? You look good naked

2388
03:14:41,520 --> 03:14:46,000
Yeah, exactly if I had weird tits and a gut it'd be classified as an artistic nude

2389
03:14:46,240 --> 03:14:49,200
But if you're hot with no clothes on it's porn

2390
03:14:49,920 --> 03:14:54,160
Fine, I'll drive you over there, but I'm not stepping a foot inside artistic anew. Let's go

2391
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,800
Wow, I am creative when it comes to destroying things

2392
03:15:01,600 --> 03:15:02,480
Are you done yet?

2393
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:07,040
Yeah, set it on fire. This should buy me enough time to swipe Jeffrey's camera and ruin the negative

2394
03:15:07,360 --> 03:15:09,040
Hey, do you have permission to-

2395
03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:10,880
Why is there a cop?

2396
03:15:10,880 --> 03:15:12,080
Uh

2397
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:15,200
If I said a teacher told me to meet here for a date

2398
03:15:15,280 --> 03:15:19,440
Would you go after him or just blame me for that too a date in your pajamas?

2399
03:15:19,760 --> 03:15:25,920
Did he tell you to destroy thousands in school property too? Look at this place come with me. What it was like this when I

2400
03:15:27,040 --> 03:15:28,880
Sleep walked in here

2401
03:15:28,880 --> 03:15:30,880
You wear gloves to bed

2402
03:15:32,240 --> 03:15:33,920
Yeah, don't you?

2403
03:15:33,920 --> 03:15:37,200
Well, so much for jack a stupid fucking glove idea to this day

2404
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:41,040
I genuinely believe sleepwalking would have worked if it wasn't for wearing those

2405
03:15:41,440 --> 03:15:45,440
Anyway, I got statewide expulsion. Yeah, I didn't know it was a thingy. Oh, no, that sucks

2406
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:46,480
I'm used to move again

2407
03:15:46,480 --> 03:15:50,320
Forced me to get a shitty job and hits me to relieve her feelings of disappointment

2408
03:15:50,800 --> 03:15:54,880
The deep fryer leaving craters on my face. No, I don't like this ending

2409
03:15:55,280 --> 03:15:57,280
Is a suicidal experience

2410
03:15:57,600 --> 03:16:00,000
Wow, the camera really does add 10 pounds fuck off

2411
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:03,120
No

2412
03:16:28,240 --> 03:16:36,960
What the one the other mouth on I look way too devilish I look normal fun like this when I'm like

2413
03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:55,120
I'm just gonna look at you

2414
03:16:57,680 --> 03:17:08,800
I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm not even joking. Yeah, there's no stream. I took a break today

2415
03:17:10,160 --> 03:17:14,240
Uh, love you all. Let's uh find someone to read

2416
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
I will simply pass away

2417
03:17:27,680 --> 03:17:29,680
Can I please read her eyes, please?

2418
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:35,200
Oh, at least there's only like 300 of you watching

2419
03:17:44,320 --> 03:17:51,360
Oh god, I've given myself a headache. Let's see who's live right now

2420
03:17:57,280 --> 03:18:00,880
Because I'm like, oh, I can't wait to make nobody's gonna want to be friends with me

2421
03:18:02,240 --> 03:18:04,240
And like a man and a

03:18:05,360 --> 03:18:07,840
Because I was hoping to raid someone outside the jet my

03:18:08,800 --> 03:18:12,240
My gen to my company today, but I'm not gonna send all you

2425
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:19,280
I'm just gonna send you to straw nation. I don't know how to handle you and

2426
03:18:19,920 --> 03:18:21,920
I already know you're gonna tell on me

2427
03:18:22,160 --> 03:18:24,160
Whatever do your worst

2428
03:18:24,720 --> 03:18:35,120
You just won't get nice Maros for a week. Hmm. I won't say zero. Hmm. Hmm

2429
