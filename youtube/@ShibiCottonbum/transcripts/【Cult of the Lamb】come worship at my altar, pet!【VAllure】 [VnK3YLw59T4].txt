I have set up crowd control for Cult of the Lamb, I've just kept all of the regular like coin amounts so like you can, I'm doing air quotes, purchase coins to mess with me on stream and I'm just like, I left everything there like I didn't take away like me switching weapons taking away my health vice versa.
So you guys can go ham if you want to you know help great or if you want to fuck me over great it's fine.
I have played Cult of the Lamb before I almost beat it I haven't finished it all the way through so we're starting a new save.
So you're letting us kill you whenever you get maybe I might have to adjust it but we'll see.
I don't know my chat died. Oh there it is there it goes.
But we'll see how because I've never used crowd control I've only played Cult of the Lamb with Twitch and they have like a built-in extension like companion on the lamb and I was pretty straightforward.
Although it was pretty easy to set up crowd control and I got the pro version so because Cult of the Lamb is like early access to get the pro version to get it.
And but I also know some other cool games on there that I would love to play with crowd control like inscription is one of my favorite games of all time and I would love to do.
I'm like really tempted to like yoink one of my stuff things from next for next week and do inscription with crowd control.
I don't know if I could never use it before yeah and either way so I think it'll be lots of fun.
I'm very epi so I've pounded two energy drinks.
We'll see how hyper I get.
Wow delicious Red Bull.
Did you see you call the lamb trailers today as local co-op yeah I'm like I tagged strongy in the trailer and I was like.
And then I just deleted it because it's a local and I'm like well fuck me then.
She's so far away.
I just get I only like the regular Red Bull.
I like could have gotten a Celsius but then Celsius is like shit to me and I haven't drink a monster in a very long time.
I remember I had like four monsters in the span of like an hour and I had like really bad heart palpitations.
That was funny.
That was real fun those days being a mall rat going through the mall.
Steam has played together.
Lots of people play local co-op games remotely.
What?
You're lying to me.
Is that true?
Have you tried Nukko?
That sounds like a drug so no.
Pink monsters.
I just only I don't like the original flavors of everything.
I don't like like although I do like the monster green team.
So time for an off club.
They rolled out during the primitive.
Oh okay.
Is there a way to send you money for super chat?
You can support me.
I have text to speech donations on with stream elements.
So you guys can mess around with that.
We all I think we all have partner now like we can all apply.
So but then it takes about like almost a month to get approved for monetization.
So super chats.
I don't know if YouTube will just fucking nuke our channels and be like who's applying horse.
No.
So we'll have to see can you have a hot dog.
Okay.
Take this glizzy puppy bark bark open wide and take this glizzy needs to do all those all I need.
Good for you.
See you're not putting poison in your body like the rest of us.
I never seen a raft before.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm just I'm a I'm going to yeah you know I got to do my normally appage before we get started.
Although I I can't wait to play call the layman.
I haven't played call the layman like three months.
So I'm going to be trash.
But yeah.
Rough.
Bow bow bow bow bow not tomorrow today.
I have to like listen to their voice and then I'm sure I could mimic Fumimoko perfectly.
We love the yappings.
I'm you know I appreciate it.
I remember back when I was a high priestess sometimes I would yeah for like an hour before I even started a game and they'd be like can you please just play or switch to just chatting.
I come into your stream and he won't shut up.
I'm looking for a game.
I'm like get the fuck out then.
I'm here to talk.
All right.
Daycare simulator.
But some bad news.
I mentioned it on my alt briefly.
My landlord discovered I'm harboring a fugitive known as Fia.
I'm supposed to have only two cats in my apartment.
And so they're like you the maintenance guys I think rat it on me.
So fuck those maintenance guys because you have to pay pet rent for every pet and it's like 50 bucks for a cat.
And I'm like I already pay like $1500 in rent.
You're telling me I have to pay rent for my cats.
Like if it was like I get it for like dogs and stuff because if they have amenities with a dog like a dog bath or like a dog park and whatever but like I'm like dude.
And so I'm just like I'm so I'm like already looking for a new place and I was texting my parents and my dad's is like honestly just save.
And I'm like what do you mean and my dad just like to start spamming save in our family's group chat.
My mom's like can you shut up and it was really funny.
But my dad's like come on with the with the hentai waifu money you'll be making.
You can save for a house and and I'm like not if they kick me out dad where am I going to stream.
But yeah no I'm going to save I'm going to look at other places but like I'm just lying to them and saying I'm cat sitting so we'll see.
Isn't it better to buy an apartment at this point.
But you can't really well you could like a condo or something.
Yeah no it's way more worth it where I am in to buy instead of rent.
I could move to another state where it would make more sense to rent but again like I've lived in this apartment for almost two years now.
And I was really just going to like wait it out until I do you get enough money to save and move and like purchase my own house but like I might have to be sooner rather than later.
But I'm actually I'm not that worried because you know I'm just really thankful.
Sometimes stuff just like I fear the worst and stuff works out for me whether it be like random acts of kindness from you guys or strangers or like.
I don't know I just I just have faith that I'll be fine so I'm not I'm not really I'm not going to stress about it.
I'm just going to hang out with you guys and you know do my thing streaming public transport.
I see streams from a laptop I could just get a laptop and just like streaming the wilderness something of a gamer myself.
Wait that was there.
I didn't put my headphones on yet so I didn't hear the Texas speech.
Hope this helps a bit thank you thank you I appreciate you so much.
Yeah but like honestly like don't feel like just because I told you that don't be like I have to save her that's not what I'm saying I'm just being honest with you.
So like if there's a time or like a week I don't stream it's because I'm probably moving but I'll keep you guys updated if that happens.
But I'm not I'm honestly not worried at all.
Force brothel let's go.
Call you Mr Sir Mommy go for it you can do either or sugar tits.
Yeah because I remember like sometimes I just like to talk to say hey what's going on in my life and I know and girls can say this to we don't tell you stuff to make you feel bad for us we just tell you because we like to talk to you.
We like to be honest with that's going on.
Because like I know as there was getting really emotionally yesterday because she's talking about her stuff.
That when I tell you I love a certain death she's a fucking cheaper for what she's gone through.
But I know she wasn't telling you to be like feel bad for me she's telling you because I'm like because like hey I have those shoes so some days are harder than others.
And like I have the same thing so I just appreciate you guys for being very understanding and supportive.
Yeah she's such a tuber.
But yeah because like we're all here we're content creators to have fun.
Yeah communication is a point especially in our relationship because you're my boyfriend go from.
I just thought of like I just thought of what's it called Ryan Gosling from the Barbie movie because your boyfriend go from.
Should be GFB let's go wait no don't get it twisted you're still the bottom of this relationship.
I'm just a lonely cow woman so I'm just gonna call you my boyfriend go from.
I'm sorry so many relationships and because of communication issues I probably yeah I would say so like.
When people don't it's usually from like my love my friends are married or dating people and I just love listening to their problems on bothered because I can't relate.
And so they'll just be like oh like money this money that or this thing and then he expects me to do this and I'm like did you tell him and then they'd be like well no when I'll be like.
Why you fucking are the or I know I'm usually I'm 100% nicer than that.
A lot of my coworkers like come to me with a lot of their problems because I'm motherly I'm big sisterly like even my coworkers who are older than me will be call me like their big sis just because like.
I've grown so much from other people's experiences because people just tell me everything I think it's my Gemini moon or whatever.
And you know I got that I got that cancer rising in that Libra son baby girl.
But oh no she's one of those astrology bitches yeah I'm fucking am it's fun.
So people saw this like I know I'll shed some wisdom and like I remember and I was also a trainer for my job for a bit so a lot of I refer to a lot of my my trainees that have blossomed and grown and have already been there for a year at my job.
Like when they get like a raise or a promotion like that's my son that's my daughter I'm so proud of them.
One of them likes to call me the they like to say I was your first born.
So I guess yeah I'm some of my coworkers I've trained or my children that makes me a meal.
She's a 10 but she's a two astrology.
But yeah no I'll I'll I used to have especially for guys because guys don't have usually a safe space to talk about their feelings.
And so I remember I had this like group of like two girls and one guy and one of the guys was like super down and I'm like hey what's going on here we're going to talk about we're going to have a therapy moment and then we all just like had a heart to heart.
My brother was crying his other brother was brother I say like air quotes like his co worker was hugging him it was so emotional and the girl was sitting there like wow I can't believe you brought that out of him and I'm like you know.
I'm just an empathetic motherfucker you know sometimes sometimes they.
Sometimes people just need a vent and yeah I'm like I'm one of those people that like I care so much that's why it's a little bit hard for me to be a dom sometimes because I'm someone who's actually very.
Caring so my aftercare goes hard.
Some homie cuddles yeah honestly you know it's not it's not homo if it's your homie and you're just consoling him.
Madam is a talent for making men cry honestly I do like I remember there's this one co worker of mine that like his girlfriend cheated on him.
And I'm like you know puts hand on shoulder bro don't worry you'll find another chicken like cuz I'm sorry like you could I'm a bro right now you guys see it so like I'm a bro to the bros and I'm a I'm a bro to the get what fried tipped $50 house fund house fund thank you.
That's the best thank you so much I appreciate that oh my gosh you're sweetheart.
But it'll be like don't worry about her there's other bitches in the sea.
And it's like thank you big sis and then you know and then I do the same thing for like my my my daughters I'm just like it's usually always like a relationship thing why are you guys breaking each other's hearts out here.
These poor children 18 years old getting dumped over the stupidest shit.
I've been calling you a bro to my friends.
Yeah I'm I'm that what's it called I'm that bro GFE.
What's up I'll play games with you and then I'll be like you know a little bit of that'll be like don't worry about it.
So how about this then I'll just be like fuck you piece of shit walk away.
Tom's over League of Legends match.
Oh shit that sucks.
Yikes.
I would say you're more pro personality with domination as a second.
I agree.

I appreciate the sloppy bro.
The perfect moment.
Tom boy GFGFB.
That's me.
That's me I guess.
I love you.
I love you you piece of shit grips you by the throat slams you up against the wall don't let anybody tell you any different.
Okay pookie kisses you on the mouth.
Not that I should answer my coworkers by the way.
No no no you never shit where you eat.
That's the first thing I tell people who who we hire on at my job.
I'm like please don't shit where you eat because I've seen my other girly pop friends.
And what they get up to you gonna cry homegirl.
Sometimes my AAVE may comes out and I'm like.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to sound like the one.
He did something like ex-libber.
People like he's black right.
Yeah yeah please don't follow him.
No yeah it's I think because I give off the big sister energy.
No one I've never had like any confessions which is nice because I just be like dude I'm just being nice to you.
You mean Quinn yeah Quinn.
I can't remember what is his newest iteration is now.
Don't share is something all the houses in Miguel.
I don't know what half a sentence meant but.
He's white.
I know he's white.
Some people just grow up in a sort of like a with a you know just multiple groups of people so they just adapt the vernacular.
Mine only comes out when because normally I'm like very like I get made fun of all the time for like because I have a customer service voice where I just sound like hi oh my gosh welcome to redacted I'm so glad to help you today so what are you looking for.
Oh okay like and I'm not joking that's what I sound like.
And then.
My white friends are like what are you doing.
And I'm like what do you mean.
Where is the AVE coming from because then because honestly from TV.
Because there's not I think the demographic in my area is mostly like Spanish and white now that I really think of it.
Sorry I'm like thinking and I was like almost going to say something and just like docks my location and I'm like no that's not right.
I remember my old job my coworkers are prank each other by pretending to be customers and have a voice.
Oh it'd be so funny.
I like sometimes I.
I'd like go up to my manager and be like excuse me and to be like what and I'll be like hi I'd like to file a complaint.
And just like major Karen voice.
And yeah it's adopted the pot media culture 100% love and hip hop I don't.
I actually.
And it's I don't want to say no I'm not going to I'm not going to say nothing because I'm going to I don't want to take this ball down because people are going to take my shit out of context.
How do I safely dispose of scorpions.
Well there is a way to remove their stinger.
You could capture them in a bucket and then so you capture them in a bucket and you put a piece of paper or the cover down you try to guide them onto the cover and then you close it and then you can let them outside.
I don't scorpions unless they're like invasive you know they might be valuable to the environment so I don't recommend killing them.
I like are really like.
Invertebrates.
OK.
To tie in with what you're about to play and you call the lamb trailer.
Yeah we were talking about that.
I'm excited for the new stuff that's probably going to come out in like I don't know like a month or two.
Since the flesh I did play.
Oh wait I was you can't you can't sleep with the cult leader and since the flesh so sorry boys.
Excuse me.
Sorry it's the red bull.
Delicioso.
Is she Texan.
Gonna take my horse down the old time road.
I'm gonna ride like I can or more we got the horses in the back.
We're tacky as a dad.
Don't know the lyrics so I'm gonna sing them bad.
Energy drink ruin the burp.
Oh that was pretty good.
I'm getting a lot of nines.
Fuck you forgive me a five.
But go off.
Deep voice she be.
I remember I posted a tech talk of my range and someone's like so you're a man and I'm like.
Thanks that's like the highest form of compliment for me for me.
I think I'm a dude with my voice range I guess.
Oh my gosh.
It would make a lot of the stuff that I posted on my alt Twitter very confusing.
Deep voice she be coming at you from the bottom.
We got the horses in the burp.
My apartment is very good.
My apartment is very echoey as well.
I need to put those sound panels up.
Shout out to the person that got me some panels.
Alt Twitter is the best shit post so far.
I didn't expect my my alt Twitter to get like what is it like 17k now almost.
And like I just posted dumb as shit on there and I'm like why is it keep getting and so that's why I'm like I'm like scared to post as often as I would because normally I don't shut up on my alt.
But now there's like majority of bots eyes on me.
It's terrifying.
That's great.
She be is not a boy.
She be is not a dude.
What the fuck.
Spikes phone.
Spikes laptop.
Spikes PC and anger.
Spikes MacBook.
Spikes whatever you're watching this on.
Did I hear cat girl?
Okay.
She's good.
She's drinking water.
I heard.
I heard.
I got a little laugh yesterday in my Maros because apparently my little sister brapped on stream.
I had someone in my Maros like hey and this gave me a laugh.
I was like cracking up.
They're like hey I'm sorry we had such good times but I'm going to have to leave you for Emmy because she she farted on stream and you gave us burps.
But like you haven't farted for us yet.
That voice is like exactly how I read it.
It's like hey so I'm going to have to leave you for your little sister and I'm like this is not an airport.
You do not need to announce your departure but have fun.
I will eventually probably fart too on accident when I can't mute fast enough but it's not you.
It's me.
I just I just really miss Mel Nakamada and she's like the closest thing I can get to her.
Okay.
Hell don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
I think there's like a compilation of back when I was a priestess all my my burps in my farts too so no one's going to find them.
I don't even know if it actually existed.
Mel mentioned.
That's such a good impression.
Damn you weren't lying with your range.
Like I said I wanted you to stream or maybe I'll do it in the collab that we have probably I think next week.
I'll be like hey guys so I need you all to say a line and I'm going to try to say it exactly the way that you say it.
Don't worry I'll make a burp compilation.
Hell yeah.
Is she be the new Mel iteration.
Hell no baby.
That would be funny though.
No trust me I'm not going to scam you guys and say I have cancer and then leave.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry cut the cameras.
Oh my god what is she saying stop it she be stop bad she be bad slap your ass she be sleep.
Damn what the fuck hold on.
Damn get a palm full of that.
Please don't awaken anything.
I'm an English guy so here you match my voice.
I can't like when I so what was it.
So when I played Andy and Lele I did like a very I gave Ashley a very like.
Okay and like okay Andy like that sort of voice and then Andy was like fuck what the hell man like damn this like that kind of like tomboy voice but for every other character.
I just gave a real shitty like British accent and then like same thing when I played Liza P just like really bad British accents all around.
Yo she be got the dumpy.
She be does not have a dumpy she has a okay thumbs up E.
Damn the shock wave Liza P Liza piss I like to call it.
It's time to put this what time is it oh it's almost time oh hi boomi.
Sometimes boomi likes to reach over to me and like reach out when he stretches on his cat bed next to me and just like touch me lightly in the arm.
I'm just like hello sir yes I know you're still there.
More boobin than dumpy yes more boobin than dumpy although hey do you guys want to fund like my brush reduction because my back started hurt.
What was that song my back is aching my brow too tight something something something something I think that's like a Beyonce song.
Is this crowd control thing going to dox me no I turned off names and and photos so I shouldn't do anything for you.
Sounds like an insult to God yeah but when you're skinny as a rail in your body type your boobs don't match the rest of your body type.
Your back hurts a lot you know how hard it is to find clothes I have I'm scared to try on the cosplay I got for she be because I know it's not going to fit over my boobs so I might have to come up with another strategy to.
To like find like just another version of the outfit because I'm scared I'm scared of being so often I go to dressing rooms try stuff on and I just cry because everything else fits perfect minus my boobs cut a hole out for the boobs.
What oh that reminds me I need to get like a bra that's similar.
Wait because I don't have to well hmm I was good thing I was planning on buttoning up my shirt but should I unbutton it for the cost.
Oh thank God I'm not a woman and then like I have friends and I bet strong he has this problem because she has a fat ass where they're like.
You know a little bit smaller like medium is premium on top and then when they go to pull up their pants their ashes and fit in any.
Pants because like their thighs and their ass are thick ums the rest of them is normal ums.
Not the nerf I got the rope for the cosplay yeah I got the rope for the cosplay well I got like a there's like a lingerie thing that I can just put on because I am not going through the effort of tying she barry although again like I said I want to do a membership stream while we learn to tie she barry.
Cake topping out the bakery suffering from success.
500 sound right for a corset or under bus is actually tailored for you um.
I sound a little bit expense maybe because like I have corsets.
Not comfortable it's like the thing is like the lingerie for the rope is pre tied.
I have two corsets one one I use for cosplay that I think I just chucked because I use it for a fairy cosplay when I went somewhere to a Renaissance fair.
And then another one I just had because I when I was working from home I just kept slouching so I put on a corset and it helped me set up straight and it was actually helpful spray on she barry.
I'm sure I heard a girl crying for not having back pain oh yeah it's always like the girls with small boobs always wish they had some the girls with big boobs always wish they had small ones and like I just want to be like in the middle.
I remember because I've been to physical therapy for the pain because I have like a fucked up neck and shoulder because of it and have to get like injections in my neck and shit.
I mean shop steroids all right right um but I remember my physical therapist um he was just like hey no he's not touching my boobs by the way get the fucking out of your head now he just directed me what to do with how to move my shoulder properly okay.
All right relax um he was telling me his wife got a reduction and then like he was just like yeah it was a fucking shame I'm like I was looking at him like of course of course you her husband would say that it was really fucking funny.
Um everyone's always unhappy yeah exactly everybody has like a little I'm doing like that salt bait like a little dash of dysphoria dash of fuck my life I hate my body and especially as a woman be like with like eastern and western ideals of like beauty and stuff it's like what the fuck do I do with my body when I don't look like that.
But yeah I'm like I think like the only thing I'm very insecure about is because I am partially melanated if I like hurt myself like if I bruise really easily and it can you can really see it on my skin and if I get like um a scratch like if I fucking boomy ran across my foot and I have a scratch on my foot and it looks like I like slashed myself because it just like leaves are really like.
Dark scar although the rest of me is super light and so like I have lots of like I remember I was wearing short sleeves at work and a girl was just like oh my god the fuck happened to you and I'm like.
Then the other girl was like you can't just fucking say that because I just have like um I have scars all over my body so I promise you it's not it's not self harm scars it's just like I'll get a zit.
I leave it or if I pick at it it just leaves a scar so I have like lots of um my mom lovingly calls me her little leopard sometimes.
Emojibi no it's not deep gashes it's really like the most superficial stuff like if I like accidentally like I'm trying to think of something.
If I got like stung by a bee the you know how like when you get stung by a bee it turns red um mine just turns dark brown like I don't even need to touch it and I just scar I just scar so fucking easily and so it just fucking sucks that's like the only thing I'm self conscious about.
Oh my god Carrie cause ask people why they have scars and then I'll usually make the joke that like you want to know how I got these scars being brown like she be yeah she be I get it now.
Jesus Christ those are damage I think I'll be honest I don't really take it personally because sometimes people just like don't have social cues and just ask those things.
Or like you know tism you know it's a little dash of tism.
Let me see I saw someone ask that question you put cream on them yeah I put stuff on them you say leopard or a leopard no a leopard like the spots.
And you know my mom always is really cute and she's just like you know scars like show us that we've survived things and we've lived Pat I'm like mom shut the fuck up I just like give me some laser.
Can you like be rich or something so I can get like laser treatment so I can get these scars and like this show up about me doing anything.
Cause like they don't have body foundation.
I was gonna speak and make up a super dark lie.
Oh yeah no cause I have like at first when she first asked me that I was like oh I just shoot myself and she was like what I'm like no fucking I just have these scars relax.
And then the other guy that's when the other girl was like you just fucking ask people why they're like that.
Or be a little bit like and they were called like she was from another country too like so she was just like being genuinely curious.
So I know she wasn't like being malicious about it.
Survive my cat walking over me yeah I live bitch.
I also have scars cause my freaking cat used me as a scratch toy I know.
Boomi will sometimes like stretch on on me like he'll reach up with his little paw paws.
But he only does this if I'm wearing pants cause he knows my pants isn't my skin so then he'll use his claws.
But if I'm not wearing pants and he reaches up to get pet he won't he'll be he'll I call it soft paw and I'm like thanks for the soft paw.
Have you ever used the line do you want to know how oh yeah all the time all the time.
You know I got the scar I got the scar oh I had like what was it.
There was like one scar I got.
It was I think it was from one of my older cats I used to have a cat named Naomi.
And she I think I was holding her and she just like what I like held her wrong or something and because she like needed to jump out of my arm so she pushed off.
She left like a crazy scratch and it looked like it looks kind of cool like it looks like I got I fought someone and I did tell a girl in grade school that I was stabbed.
She believed it and I still like and right next because and then she just and then this fucking girl proceeded to stab me with a stick fuck you Mackenzie I still have the scar fuck you I hate you so much.
I was like 10 and I told her yeah I was stabbed she's like oh really stabbed you with a stick yeah remember that same year that winter I got hit with an ice ball in the ear.
And then the kid who threw it passed out from looking seeing my blood and I was just laughing maniacally.
Mackenzie hate.
With the stick oh wait can I fart hold on.
Get that I really just like spread my cheeks for the mic.
Oh my God.
I hope I hope we get like we need every girl to fart so we can have like a fart compilation like a clip of just every viewer member fart.
Eat more fiber though.
I see I thought I was going to be the first one but then since Emmy was the first one I'm not shy anymore because if my little sister can do it then I can do it.
So now I'm just as cool as her.
I'm uncomfortable I'm starting to stare from that statement but that's all deal that's the only one you'll get that's the only one you'll get the rest patreon.
I ain't ripping ass for free except for that one so clip that you can play that as much as you want.
You know so bad it's gonna be so weird no I don't think like I know I don't think I see for a zero would maybe a zero I see maybe a little cute princessy farts.
I don't know what like why are you guys like farts.
It's just like for me like toilet humors is really funny so like when a streamer does it like I just cackle a lot but then somewhere you are just like.
Like hello.
Oh my God I'm like hot now from doing that.
We bond through farts is that how it works that's what girls do in the bathroom I'm going to tell you a little secret.
We just go in the bathroom we just share our farts with each other.
It's exactly what it's like.
Ha ha pee pee poo poo yep exactly and we did on the ASMR stream.
No I think she did it on her Andy and Lele stream.
I'm sweating it's hot it's hot in my fucking apartment for some reason though I have the AC cranked up.
Don't know why that is.
Oh.
OK we're going to play the game.
And how exactly do you know what's happening in girls bathrooms.
Do it sorry I pissed outside I pissed outside the bathroom they don't allow me in and a man or woman's bathroom.
Ä Phill selfish
And if you pass
And if you pass
🌊
Why would I destroy it?
Why would I destroy Pluto?
It's already been through enough
No. Dont ruin my Girlbath infanticies
Yeah, I'm not a woman or a man. I am just an eldritch being from another dimension. That's why you don't know anything about my early history and my lore. It's because they couldn't show it because it would make you go crazy.
Yeah.
Why the fuck did I call the lamgo?
I'm crazy. I was crazy once. I'm one of the old ones.
I wouldn't mind a fudashibi.
Bro, where did you come from with that?
I said eldritch being like, you know I wouldn't mind fuda.
That's not what that means!
Crazy? I was crazy once. It locked me in a room.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I will release the audio of me applying to an agency where all I did for five minutes in the video was being a straightjacket and scream and cry.
Then I did that for three or five minutes.
I will show that after stream.
I was not the first one to say that.
Oh, were you?
Okay.
Where's my...
Okay, how's game sound?
How's game sound, baby grills?
How are we doing?
You applied to phase?
No.
No, so this was before the viewer opened stuff.
Because again, I didn't think I was gonna get into the viewer because I didn't think I was cool enough, but look at me now.
Yeah, your little fucking whore.
Not mentally ill enough.
Oh, honey, you don't even know.
He doesn't know.
He doesn't know how mentally ill I am.
Why do you think I deal with these voices?
Because the voice is in my head.
You're just hiding your cheaper.
Game sound okay?
Perfect.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hidden yonder?
Yeah.
Aren't we all just like a little land area at heart?
Mentally ill, but not PC mentally ill?
I need to stand up.
My ass is sweating.
What the fuck is going on?
It's so hot.
I'm only wearing a T-shirt.
I need to air my ass out.
Hold on.
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.
Smack that thing.
Corporal love.
Oh, but as I was saying, so, um, so I applied for the socks V2 being agency.
This is before like I'm great for them.
I'm happy to get in.
I was just applying like Vila like was my one and only.
If I if I got into any other, I would have fucking dropped it for Vila.
I'll tell you that right now.
So don't think you guys are like, oh, she only applied cuz she had no other.
No, that's not the case.
But because they're like, oh, we bought some really crazy bitches.
And I'm like, hey, you know, I'm a crazy bitch.
I can be crazy.
And so I sent like a very me-me application where I talked about Avril Lavigne having a doppelganger.
And like I said, and she was replaced socks, socks agency by a, what's their name?
What's their name?
Flork the the the the the the artist.
There we go.
Gotta hide by wait.
Well, I'm not really hiding my titties, but it's fine.
I want all in.
I'm surprised the voices are real.
I'm not schizophrenic guys.
I'm not schizophrenic.
I swear.
Let's get to Fernia does run in my family.
I don't have schizophrenia.
Maybe shut up anyways.
Yeah.
Come on.
That one Chad.
E.T.L.
Blessed soul.
Her name is literally on the website as an investor.
Hey, at me.
Can I run?
Oh wait, you know what I should do?
One hell yeah devolver.
I'm gonna make my way.
I like it when
I reflect the screen.
I think it's fun.
Like how strong he does it.
Whoa.
I'm a little I'm a little too dark.
Hold on just a moment.
White woman jump scare.
There we go.
There we go.
Laura.
I thought that was my voice.
Wait.
But for us.
That's the last of its kind.
Others have hunted down and put to the blade.
With its final sacrifice,
the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.
The heretic who lies down down below
will be condemned to attorney to captivity.
The old faith shall be preserved.
This isn't my first time being a cult leader.
I've been a cult leader before.
Where the fuck I am.
If you know that reference, I love you.
Come closer.
Fear not.
For though you are already dead,
I still have need of you.
Those foolish bishops thought they could keep me from me and death,
but instead they sent you straight to me.
I will give you life again for debt or price.
All I ask is for you to start to call to my name.
Do we have a deal?
White woman jump scare.
I didn't even notice that my stuff went like that.
My choice.
Take the red crown from
which I once wore.
With it you shall command the lower two followers
and strike fear to the hearts of our enemies.
Return to your land of the living.
Start to call to my name and begin recruiting followers.
She be the angel.
All eat my ass.
Once you've done so you'll see me again.
Now go.
Lord inaccurate she be.
Let me know if it's too loud.
I love the music.
They're like wow she's actually not dead yet.
Yeah I'm decent.
Oh wait my BGM is playing.
I don't even fucking know this.
What about that? Does that sound better?
It's just dance for a moment.
Start voguing.
Shake that.
Shake that.
Throw it back on this dig.
Yeah get it.
Throw it back on the strap.
Okay we're good.
Cool.
Can you throw it back?
Yeah I can throw it back.
I shake what my mama kinda gave me.
Relax.
I'm matching those things right now.
Thanks you're welcome.
Welcome.
Okay let's see if stuff works.
Cause I know you can claim to be the follower.
I was trying to think if I could do Jamaican accent.
But I don't think I can.
Fear not I am run out.
That's not a Jamaican accent cause I'm trying to think of a voice to give him.
I might just give everybody uwu voices.
Gamer girl wuga.
Hello man would you kindly share a number on the account?
I have to fart.
It's not for free.
That was the only one for free.
Is the land like dancing or vibing?
I think they're just vibing.
You guys are fucking...
Little brap stuff.
Fear not.
I was sent to guide you.
We are the deep in the lands of the old faith and in great danger.
She's just gonna have a really bad London accent or whatever the fuck.
Australian.
My instructions are I'll lead you to safety.
Continue through the woods.
Escape loads ahead.
I'm Sean Connery.
I will be close by.
I'll let it go.
Ooh I get one coin.
What to open inventory?
That's not good.
Huh?
Oh.
I'm like my controller doesn't look like that.
I don't even think I ever really looked at my inventory when I played before either.
What's my best operation of a Jamaican?
Probably offensive.
Although I was listening to a lot of dancehall yesterday.
Six million ways to die. Choose one.
Ah ah ah ah ah.
Listen to a little chocolate demersen plier.
Oh my god.
I have to fart again.
It's because I had Indian food.
Almost penniless.
Oh my god.
Gibi's farting so much.
Why is she announcing it?
Because you're gonna wonder why I mute and pause for a second and stare at me like I'm stupid.
Like is she okay?
Is she having an absence seizure?
Probably.
How's your spice tolerance?
Non-existent.
Come here.
Come here you little bitch.
Maybe some kind of mental illness is happening.
It's already happened.
A.O. shout out to Christina Applegate.
Brother.
I know what you're referencing.
It's fucked.
Non-existent.
Butter chicken.
No, it's not spicy.
I didn't get spicy.
I just got goat korma.
Yeah, I like goat and lame a lot.
We have nearly reached safety, but look ahead on their pulse.
So let's be sacrificed.
It's one of you bitches.
Oh mighty bishops of the old faith.
We asked, I don't know why I sound like Toad.
We asked you to accept the sacrifice of this wretched soul.
Hey, who interrupts her ritual?
Trespass is on signal.
Mario.
Oh.
I don't think I can die though.
Because I don't have any hearts.
Yeah, I think I'm fine.
My favorite in this game is the axe.
Pfft.
Oh, my Toad is nowhere.
That's pretty good Toad voice. Thank you!
Hold on, I want to see for the crowd control.
I think I turned off something.
I just want to make sure that it's fine.
Pfft.
Test effect.
Is it working?
No, whatever.
Did it work? I can't tell.
Hold shift to delay five seconds.
Pfft.
Oh, it's so tiny.
I can't see it up there.
Hold on.
Keep talking amongst yourselves.
I can ban people.
That's funny.
Okay.
Can I figure?
Pfft.
Settings.
Options.
Inside the sound.
This is very interesting overview.
Oh, if you guys will use real money, I can get paid.
What the fuck? I didn't even know it was a thing.
Oh, aren't you funny.
Thank you for the tip.
Wait.
Damn, I can't use crowd control.
It only takes credit cards.
Damn you credit cards.
Damn you.
I don't know why the sound effect didn't work.
I swear stream elements has like a love-hate relationship with me.
Sometimes they'll just be like, yeah, we'll work properly.
Yeah, that's fine.
Oh, there's a no though.
No, I don't think you have to use really, you should be able to get free coins and stuff.
Because I know some of you have already claimed stuff from when I'm looking at the history of stuff.
It should be good.
It should be good in the hood.
I don't know how to use it.
Oh, I hate you no less.
Yeah, it's fine.
It's all like normal.
Texas Beach.
I might have to have management look at that.
Make sure it's fine.

i like smooth peanut butter if you like crunchy peanut butter your sociopath
crunchy game you pull up disgusting get out of here if you like crunchy peanut butter
like i said you're literally a sociopath you probably like your pillow when it's warm
you probably pour milk in before the cereal
instead if you ever get a dog why whitney moscow no what the fuck
now that is a throwback that reference
i pour milk before getting a bowl
why are you excited about that mention
i pour milk before the cereal and i'm proud i need you to if you pour milk before the
cereal can you explain that to me are you okay
but y'all you all right in the head
mm no
that was a stupid ass laugh
you eat them separately first of all you don't fucking eat milk
you're a psychopath and should be locked up for that one
just saying you're the probably the type of person that puts the dips your oreos in water
your oreos in water
yeah we're talking about milk the beverage don't try to aha me
when i'm talking about milk when it's in another form
you can eat milk depends on how expired it is i actually drank expired milk the other day
and i was so uh i was i was not having a good time
and like because i was i had made s'mores in the oven because you know you just take a s'more
you just put a little graham cracker put the um some chocolate you put us a
marshmallow on top and you just broil it you put it to beside its broil so the top gets
like nice and like baked um and then like made myself a little s'more then i poured some milk
and i'm like how does the milk the milk kind of smells sweet and when it smells too sweet you
know it's bad but i'm like it's fine probably and then i drank it and with my and i couldn't
really tell that it was not good with eating the s'more
and um
yeah okay yeah thank you for those high numbers thank you i'm bowing thank you thank you
apply yourself what does that mean
perfect thank you ah i'm here all week ladies and gentlemen thank you thank you
i'm just picturing you guys all just raising like this little score cards like 10
11 out of 10 oh perfect i'm glad i'm glad i hope you like the reverb on that burp um
um but so i drank the milk and then i was like oh my tummy really hurts and
then when i went to pour cereal the next morning it just came out solid and i was like
that explains a lot i just gleaned what the hell it just squirted all over my keyboard ayo
i dropped my raise key
but is it me streaming today
i don't know i shouldn't have said ayo because now you guys are gonna be like
for everything
you're making pop and cook in today so emi has a hand cam stream
in about three minutes if you guys want to go watch her totally understandable
i would also want to watch a cute and funny girl make pop and cook in
i've done it myself in the past when i was a priestess very fun
i should actually find those clips of me just i got one of those like
i got a lot of japanese candy stuff and um like there's like a toilet candy
and it was so bad it's supposed to taste like cola oh god
but yeah she's doing pop and cook in so make sure and then we got um azura is doing
supermarket simulator and then mer she's playing harvester harvester is one of my
favorite fucking games because of how out of pocket it is so that's going to be fun
that'll be real fun
um
toilet candy um i don't know if i can pull up a picture of it but it's like just look
up japanese toilet candy and like you jet you decorate the toilet and you put like some
fizzy stuff inside the toilet and then like um like water and then it fizzes up it's supposed
to taste like soda but it was funny
streaming right through me
no no yeah the freshener that you put in the toilet
i think i'm gonna just keep eating my my rice cake because i still got one to eat
it's a good snack i just throw a little bit like if i want something sweet
i just throw a little bit of peanut butter on a rice cake or some nutella and i'm good
so i don't have like candy or shit
yeah it's pretty terrifying
it was really fun to get though because it's like a gotcha of like which toilet you'll get
you don't know if you'll get like the princess toilet or like the
ooh is that a hawk like a hawk to the way my window or was it
or like there was like a serious one and there was like a ooo one
yeah japan might be too advanced 100 percent there's this youtuber i watch called dancing
bakens and him and his wife just go to lots of different like tai and japanese places and he goes
to a lot of like convenience places and just all like weird ass stuff they have in japan
but i wish i could try and i cannot in america
okay was there was there a thing with that
mr text to speech or just let me tip ten dollars thank you for tipping ten dollars
let's see he's shy oh no mr al he just he didn't say anything
my character is a schmetterling is what iron reaper said i didn't catch that one
schmetterling what is a schmetterling
dancing bacon a vtuber classic yeah i just like to watch like a lot of like i was watching um
this other like i watched a lot of catching cook stuff and like um japanese chef like i'm
i got 100 can filet a fish and just take it apart and break it down if i wanted to actually broke down
you guys are gonna say i'm fucked for this but i um i uh so i was like i said i
was watching yellow jackets and yellow jackets is a great survival show about like these girls
that have to survive in the wilderness after the plane crashes and a bunch of other shit too it's
like it's really cool psychological horror a little bit of like spiritual horror stuff and so at
one point they catch a rabbit and they make it and i'm like man i wonder what rabbit tastes like
so uh they had rabbit at my store and it happened to be on sale so i bought a whole young
rabbit and i processed it i broke it down and i made it into stew and it was one of the most
delicious stews i've ever made does that make me a cannibal
oh yellow jackets are wash well when you're hungry
as a frenchman rabbit is good yeah i was like it's it's almost like dark meat of a turkey
um yeah i have like pictures of me uh breaking down the rabbit that i took
old pictures of the rabbit that i broke down brutal why are you eating yourself
it was worth it your fourth third cuz i want to remove
i was yeah i was feeling really Hannibal lector you know do you know how difficult it is to break
down an animal because my this is a whole rabbit i had a little bit like the awfuls in there too
there was some heart the kidneys were good um so that's it's probably the most
so i think yeah the weirdest thing i've ever eaten was a rabbit's heart
why are you taking pictures because i'm fucked up have you tried gator tastes like chicken
um but like yeah i had to because i couldn't just like i wasn't gonna just throw it in the oven
like i wanted to specifically make a stew out of it because in the show they made a stew out of it
and guys i like to make a lot of fucked up stuff from media that i play so like i've made like i made
a rabbit stew from yellow jackets but then i also made like the same stew from coffin of andy and lele
not with human i got um a like beef for that but i followed like the recipe air quotes that
ashley did um so not human disclaimers but like i don't know like i get like really like
like feral and animalistic sometimes where i just wanted like
i'm gonna sound like a fucking serial killer if i said never mind um i did not eat human
i didn't eat long pork i know uh who was it that talked about long pork is it loomi
um sure beef it was really tasty though i have pictures i'll post them on my all
my pictures of my rabbit stew and my beef stew that i made and it was during like the winter
so it was like really like nice um so it's full of snuff amutilation kinks
but uh why is the stream why would the stream get archived i'm not even saying anything bad
come on excuse me come on guys i was gonna possess by a burp demon there
no one wasn't that good this would be my surprise actual cannibal shy she'd be
call me shebe hammer isn't army hammer eatable
eight out of ten solid okay
hi shebe it's me fun time freddy greggory welcome to cold the lamb the
story is about the lamb who became a deity a lot of people have had heard about the one who waits
they will have immortality get inside me greggory
this is classified as girl probably
other day i was a racist i don't know what you're talking about
thank you fun time she be anytime
dance learn for what eating food
castle nine never happened happy yesterday morning
i decided adhd tangent in my head where you said shebe is over party then i
felt like the dream is over party and i thought of a meme i saw her dream where he's like i'm not
dreaming anymore call me nightmare kitten and it's like him with a really bad snapchat filters biting
his lip it's shebe over fun while it lasted
okay i think i have to pee do you actually do that i don't i think somebody edited like the like
he definitely did the snapchat filter but i think somebody edited it to make like he said that in the snapchat
i think did i save that photo because i was dying laughing it's funny when you look up dream you just see rumpelstiltskin
he just shows up as one of the first suggestions and it kills me every time
hold on i don't even remember when i saved it just a bunch of cat pictures i have a picture
an ai photo of a lady tied up with spaghetti in shabari
and i have spongebob tied up in shabari
i have my boobs
fuck i can't find it and then i have you know the first photo i ever said to strani what it was it was
a picture of this girl's feet and she has like really long acrylics on her toes
and she's barefoot in her car like pressing the gas pedal and i don't even know what the context of it was
it was the first picture i ever said to strani and she was like hey yo what the fuck is this
i also have a picture of that one shebe shebe shebe inu pulling a katana or ninja sword
nothing personal kid
scrolling through the phone
can't find it
i'm gonna google it i'm gonna pull it up
i'm not dream i'm nightmare snapchat
dream is literally just cryotic and i don't know why anybody hasn't noticed that yet
oh i can't it's not fucking there when i search it
i used to love cry until he was a freaking weirdo
it's uh i think that channel with him and his friends like minks and stuff and that whole like friend group is why
i like reading um like dramatic reading stuff out loud because they like did a dramatic
it confused the two so did i i'm like who is this kid with the exact same mask
many such cases i know i remember i also used to watch um a lot of like the van os crew when i was younger
because i really like their gta 5 stuff and um why am i i'm asleep it's because like i closed out um
um no don't rip him don't rip you cry he's a piece of shit um but i used to watch the van
os and then fucking many lad had to go groom a girl stop grooming girls there are plenty of women
your own age that'll probably send you titty pictures just go to a bar and say i'm a famous v2 v youtuber
youtuber and make a lot of money and they'll just flash them at you
oh god not him it was just yeah i think he disappeared off the face of the earth one of my um
one of my former friends used to edit for i think one of them i can't remember
and he said that they were like behind the scenes are pretty nice not edit for many lad edit for
another one of the people just crew i can't remember and um they said they were nice
like the the crew were pretty cool and they paid well cartoons and delirious are great yeah i think
delirious became like a uh v youtuber i remember uh i would always get like the delirious out of my mind
i'm so delirious like stuck in my head um i don't even watch any of those people anywhere oh another
although sometimes i'll go back to the clip where um it was like gassy mexican would pretend he was
uh morgan freeman i'm creeping around somewhere like when they're playing like i think like stalker
whatever it's called like that was because those animations are funny and yeah the only
people i watched it was literally like uh my vtuber oh she who you'll never know she will remain my
lovely secret because i'm a little bit parasocial for her um uh and and it's funny because um because
i have like multiple oh she's right because you know it's i also like i'm a whore i double
dip in multiple oh she's it's funny because like strani was my oh she for a long time and i'm like
now she's just my friend um so i'm like can i oh she my friend i don't i guess you're just my friend
now it's case on isn't it it's not but she definitely is whoo whoo it's emilia airhart oh you
got me um yeah so and then i watch like markiplier old jenna marbles videos um a lot of like tarot reader
videos meditation videos rain sounds and game grumps i just like and then i'd just rather
be streaming than watch somebody so i haven't really watched all the youtube videos boxy oh my
fucking god boxy boxy baby i don't remember what she used to say oh she to oh she friendship
the pipelines here oh my oh she's graduated i'm so sorry bro jenna marbles is the name i
haven't heard in a minute i wish she would come back i wish so much jenna marbles to come back
because she was my comfort youtuber for the longest time like when i was really down i would just
watch her kory kenchan oh yeah i know kory kenchan um i don't watch kory kenchan though but um
and it's the fact that she left over people flaming her on the internet for um a joke that just
didn't age well but it was like from like 10 years ago so who the fuck cares she's not that person
and the type of seatbelts she got for her dogs that she loves and would die for and she hasn't come
back but i'm like i'm happy she got married to julian and all that shit like oh my god my my otp got
married uh seen her in her smiletime fight he's a bit underrated yeah i can't wait for his movie to
come out though i'm very excited um that the little teaser that they posted was pretty cool i'm just
wondering what his directorial debut will be like because i'll be on it like i'm not a huge fan of the um
like uh heist as markiplier etc stuff um i do like choose your own adventure stuff and it's like on
it like that's the coolest thing i've ever fucking seen if like a vtuber did that it'd be so
fucking cool um i should shout out markiplier yeah he's such a small creator um nah we don't shout
out males on this channel fuck men like we fuck them in but like fuck men you know
um old school smosh oh yeah i remember i used to sing the like assassin's creed song they did
shane doft in her smosh movie i think i did i watch this shane doft was it like smiley or i don't
think i watched that shit but i'm just like i know they cast good people i know he's a good actor but i
feel like his acting is different from like hollywood acting it's like youtube acting but i don't know
if that's change like i just really curious to see when this movie comes out um that man the harem
you know it baby you know it baby girl you know it pookie pie um i love you so much um i've been
gay and brist favorite since john same same um sometimes i watched like a couple of the john
tron's recent stuff but i was just like uh smosh like an zelda rap did not age well go back oh i have
to watch that then if it didn't age well um there's like another like legend of zelda song sometimes
i'll just like sing i think it was like a dubstep remix of like zelda rap it's like i took
look to my left i look to my right i look to the front and i'll be all right or whatever the
fuck it was like so dumb all john tron videos in my comfort yeah i prefer the old john tron videos
dicks insider ouch such a good one brentel brentel floss no i don't have in her that person
how many how many fools can i kill today too many to count don't get in my way
so good i fucking love that oh so good i wish like people would make parody sounds like i know
like kelly has made a new few um kelly a kriami from uh ann project has made a few parody songs
and i'm like and i wish more people would make parody songs like it would just be great
like i'm i'm thinking about making a parody song i'm not going to tell you what it is because it's a
really fucking good idea and so i'm a hawk chop is my death blow um but uh yeah kelly is a really
good creator really talented singer her she got noticed by um by hiara so good for her good for her um
rey bliem johnson never heard of him i didn't do a song cover or anything
um although it was funny because uh shawnee gave us the songs to do
and uh behind the scenes insider thing i like how i'm not playing the game
but i'm gonna be playing this for a while anyway so it doesn't fucking matter um
mercy did her whole song in one take
and that she did the whole song in one fucking take i don't know how she fucking did that
those ghiyat skewdie parody
did you do a parody song as a tiktok yeah but that's like not the same
like i want someone to make like parody stuff related to vtuber stuff like community
shawnee certified rapper yeah i take after my mother a lot
oh maybe i'll do that for um maybe i'll do the assassin's creek cover for like a karaoke
have you heard of weird al yeah i was singing i'm fat like the other day
your body's wine well mine is too so shut your mouth or i'll sit on you
i listened to someone's dumb shit when i was younger i also know i knew a lot of
like uh what's it called songs and like popular pop culture reference songs only because i'm
naruto flash animations only because of like i you know like that one song like the sailor song
that was in the flash animations toy box um i grew up after like watching the naruto fan
animations toy box was the first cd i ever fucking bought and i would i want to do a cover
of one of their songs like either like best friend or um or like superstar i am a superstar
the big big house in a big big car i am a superstar and i don't care who you oh tarzan's
a good one too what the fuck is on my leg what is this i got fortune i got fame love it when
you say my name love to party i am naughty pretty as everybody i've got muscles on myself
gentle just people kiss my butt i'm so fly i'll make you cry cross my heart and hope to die
i got to really piss gotta really piss gotta really piss my life is like a video game
i really love the freedom view alert gives you guys such a good vibe with the company yeah
i know like some people like oh like wow wouldn't it be so cool to be in hall alive i would not
survive in hall alive not because of like the content that i make but because or like that i swear
a lot or whatever so many eyes on me and having to get permissions and stuff would just be like i would
literally have a panic attack every time i went live i'm kind of happy that like we're small
but it's funny because i honestly expected us to not get a large viewership but i wasn't doing
for viewership i was doing because i wanted to have fun um and be like with the group of girls
and have friends and be in the company together and just collab and um but yeah i didn't expect
as much success as we have gotten and then go do your thing we can wait i'm gonna piss on the
microphone bring it with me i'm just kidding this is a brain sense of structures oh yeah toy box
is not good et is an alien and he is kind of crazy coming to the university party and whatever
the fuck the song is some people are definitely blind by the numbers and can't work an actual
company like yeah like i've worked in corporations like like for a good chunk of my career so like
i know how to be like if i was in haul life or if i was in like nijisanji god for fucking bid
not getting not getting not bad getting nuked um i could ease like i could easy kind of like dial
my personality back a little bit and not be like as lewd or as like untoward and forward um negligible
but um i'm really happy that with veeler i can kind of really be myself but then like you know
then there's like marine like she's kind of like who and like there's like a there's a couple of
people that are like i like who in tall alive so i can't really say that um i want to put the
niji curse on my worst enemy i know right i just i feel my heart goes out to them the people there um
because like yeah when you join niji you get like an auto like boost of viewership and all that stuff
but then you know there's some other stuff that goes along with it um she's seen you already um
but yeah it's like it is what it is i'm not gonna talk about that or otherwise we'll go in a rant
i know strawney has the same feelings as i do negative feelings he used to get the boost but
anymore i know i think not to like number or anything or talk about that or anything but like
so i know i'm performing a little bit better than the new niji sawni livers really surprises me it makes
me kind of sad for them uh i wouldn't wish but uh hold on let me go piss

And all the background noise, you couldn't hear it.
Oh, thank you.
I want to kermit.
Kermit the frog.
I don't know what you said.
Jokes on you.
I like to be jam.
I literally checked, but what I realized I muted was I muted something else.
I muted...
I think I accidentally muted my 3D audio instead, although it's not running.
So...
Imagination fills the blanks, cool.
Oh, and I just want to say, if you're a Neegee fan, please don't come for me.
Please.
I like your livers. Please don't hurt me.
I promise.
I won't say anything.
Please don't hurt me.
I really like their little cute and funny girl they got.
Her design is really adorable.
Twisty.
And I'm a Victoria Blight Brite Shield fan.
Alright, what about playing the game, right?
Free my Neegee ocean.
I see a box to create a little box even stream.
Well, yeah, there's not enough...
Oh, you guys are starving, I forgot.
There's too many of you.
I have to kill some of you off.
I like Skarl.
Skarl is cool.
Choco.
Beast?
Let's see.
Let's scratch my nose.
I think there's a game, you know?
Probably gonna play this for like five hours or something.
I'm supposed to switch to the mapping.
I don't know why I choked.
Where's the other dude?
Oh, he's over here.
He's fighting for his life.
Alright, let's go.
Where the fuck did these bitches come from?
When you were a kid, did you ever sit in a place
and pretend like ninjas were gonna drop down from the ceiling
and you were the only one that could save all the people in the building
so you would fight them off?
I would do that at church a lot when I was bored.
I'm like, what if just a bunch of motherfuckers just busted up in my church
and there were ninjas, and then I used some little bitch-no-jutsu on them.
God, so I don't care if you're starving.
Cool.
Okay, I'm not the only one.
Cool.
Cause you just get so bored.
Like if you had to like go to church or like do something with your mom
or like go shopping or whatever.
Just be like this picture of weird stuff.
I forgot that I'm supposed to be picking stuff.
I meant to pick the spyglass.
I'm just pressing A.
It's fine.
I don't care that much.
I just want the fleece that lets me do automatically three anyways.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, fervor.
Get fucking, god.
Cool.
Can I?
Oh, I have to shoot.
I love to see it.
Oh, that hurt my throat though.
How am I supposed to be the throat goat like this?
Just kidding.
That's a serious job.
I'm god, it's like I think from Hades.
Yeah, I want to play Hades so bad.
I think I can only go this way again.
Can I burp?
Again, I don't notice when that happens.
I'm glad you could catch a stream too on your lunch break.
I too like to watch streamers on my lunch break.
So then I can just stick my headphones in and pretend to ignore everybody.
Oh.
All right, I already have plenty of followers so I don't need that.
I could get some food for cooking and I forget what that little thing means.
I can't remember, but I'd rather go this anyways.
A little short burp.
Yeah, I tend to cute.
Cool.
Fuck your family.
Die, die.
Death, death of honey, death of punky, die, death.
Oh wait, I don't know why I'm killing them when I don't have bones yet.
Look what you've done, you've massacred my boy.
I can't even make any fish recipes yet, I don't think.
I'm gonna get the fucking...
Oh, I should have gotten the seeds actually.
I can't hit his wife, his wife is so precious.
What? Oh, I have to...
I'm like, what?
Shit's in good...
Yeah, you know, sometimes it'd be like that.
Sometimes you just gotta murder people, you gotta murder people, shit's in giggles.
I just realized my mouth hasn't been moving this entire time.
I didn't know what he'd tell me.
I didn't know what he'd tell me, I was just staring at you awkwardly.
Why am I so small?
Because you were watching the K&L.
Because I stood here in telepathic.
I don't know if you're too close, that's good.
I don't know if you're...
I don't know if you're aware of this.
Here I am.
I don't know if I'm always in my head.
Yeah, you're in your head.
I don't know if I'm in my head, I don't know if you're aware of this.
They don't exist.
So I'm solving a dream.
Game is loud, your mom's loud.
Washing the game and not your pretty mouth, oo-woo.
My oo-woo-woo mouth.
I'll take the top because I'm a top.
Sorry.
Tour a land of many gods once, hundreds now.
On the very first.
You know how you gargle like mouthwash?
Like you go, ah, like that's what I do.
That's how I can also do like a cat pernoise.
Like.
Although my throat is a little bit dry, so I can't like do it as nice.
Can I just take the rest of these?
Oh, I can.
Get fucked.
I'm stealing.
I'm stealing.
I've been stealing along.
Oh, I hate these ones.
Hate them so much.
My least favorite enemy in this game, any variation of them, I just fucking hate.
So you foolishly persist, little lamb.
I hear your lies and I smell your fear.
The red crown rises again, but what an unworthy bearer it has.
Eat my fucking- oh, what the hell?
I thought-
Get fucked.
Get fucked.
Get fucked.
Ho-ya!
Oh, ow.
Come here, you little bitch.
Oh, I hate that they jump because then I can't tell with the depth of the field.
Things their voice can do.
I wish I knew how to purr.
I know.
I remember it was like really weird because I was able to do that since I was a little kid.
So people would be- I was like, oh yeah, I can purr and kids would be like, what? No way.
They purr in my ears.
I just purred people's ears like a fucking weirdo.
And that's why I like to war your cats.
I was a cat girl all along.
Oh, you guys just gave me a blunderbuss.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.
Oh, I'm gonna be back in the corner.
It's hard to aim sometimes.
Cool beans.
Okay, I'm gonna go back for that one over there.
Yeah, ASMR before is ASMR.
Okay.
I like the blunderbuss, so I'll keep it.
It's a bit-
I can also just get-
Yeah, that should be fine.
I don't care if you're starving.
I read war your cats too.
Of course I read war your cats.
That was my shit.
I was larping the fuck out of war your cats.
What's up?
It's-
It's your deputy, Broke and I here.
What's up?
It's your medicine cat, Nightrun here.
That was my names.
I was a-
Some of my sub-OCs.
Actually, I think I have like still have a list and like-
I emailed a lot of my like OC character sheets to myself.
So I have to find that in my old email.
What cat clan were you?
I was Shadow Clan.
Hello Shadow Clan.
I also did a lot of like online.
Like, you know like Flipno Hatena?
Give me your fucking-
Fuck!
I couldn't shoot this girl.
So you could do a lot of like-
What's it called?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Like role-playing on Flipnote.
So I was part of like Ghost Clan and Broken Clan.
Shout out to Ghost Clan.
I was in that Warrior Cache channel.
It's so funny.
One of the girls that I role-played with, we just-
We discovered we lived only like 10 minutes away from each other.
And then we met up and it was so fun.
Cause we were like-
Our little parents-
Wasn't our parents let us hang out or something?
Although I don't know when my parents will allow me to hang out with some random stranger from on the internet.
Maybe we just like snuck out.
We hung out with each other.
I can't remember.
We like met at a public place.
But it was just really cool.
It was the first time I met one of my online friends.
It was because we both like Warrior Cats and we were the same age.
Yeah, I liked Warrior Cats.
Guardians of the Ghoul was good.
What else?
What else?
She's a Slytherin of Cats.
It's funny cause I'm actually like a Gryffindor.
When I did like that Pottermore house sorting.
So it burned people.
There's like a fucking weirdo.
Now I get paid for it.
I know, right?
What was a Warrior Cat?
No, thunder.
Thunder.
Thunder.
Thunder Cats Ho.
Warrior Cats was a young adult novel.
And it was almost like Game of Thrones, but cats.
Cause you had like instead of houses, there were clans.
And there was different ranking systems.
You had like your leader, your deputy, your medicine cat,
who was also the spiritual leader of the clan.
And it was honestly, despite being a young adult novel,
looking back, it has some very adult themes in terms of like this one cat
cheated on another cat and had kids with this cat.
And he tries and he goes crazy and tries to kill her in a fire and kill her children.
Like what the fuck?
That was a kids book?
Yeah, it was.
It was fucking great.
Young adult, but they had them in my elementary school library, right?
Animorphs?
Oh, Animorphs was my shit as well.
I remember watching the TV shows.
I watched a good, I read a good book, good chunk of Animorphs.
Okay, I might be quiet so I can focus.
Okay.
I forgot that I sometimes I just forget I can use fervor.
I know I would like finding of Isaac because I like this game.
Strony was telling me that.
Oh, I thought I was out of range of that, but I guess not.
Okay.
My thumb is starting to hurt for some reason.
I missed?
What was that?
It was a little cheebie.
What are you doing?
Cheebie.
Cheebie, you dumbass.
You're losing it.
Oh, fuck me.
I should have done that.
I'm so stupid.
Why am I not talking again?
Oh, chat disconnected.
Oh, no.
Hurry, guys.
Enter the gun.
Oh, I got greedy.
Yeah.
I got a little greedy.
Just a smidge.
Just a smidge.
Oh, I can hear myself.
Fuck that.
I can't voice act right now.
Where's my thumb hurt?
I need to pop my thumb.
I need to pop my thumb loosey.
Okay.
Hello?
I know I'm so close to clutch.
Of course this bitch got a choke.
Why is my...
Live 2D.
Why are you fucking with me?
Why am I so white?
Come on.
I believe in you.
Excuse me.
I'm bad.
It's getting brighter again.
My nose.
I'm so big.
Let me sit back a little bit.
It's like a growl.
I ask myself that question every day.
That's funny because I haven't been to the beach yet this summer.
Or really mostly been outside for the last...
I've been outside, but I just haven't really been going to the beach.
So I'm very light right now.
My mom is darker than me.
My white mother.
Yeah, I'm gonna go make some food right now.
I'm gonna go beat that stupid ass boss.
Because my mom is outside a lot because she got gardens, so she's...
She's also Portuguese, so...
Portugues.
So she's tan as well.
There we go.
So my mom and my dad make fun of me a lot.
My dad calls me his white child.
And then my mom's like,
Well, she is white!
And he's like, yeah, but my melanin should take precedent.
Dang, me look angry.
I think my Wi-Fi is like struggling a little bit
because I have to have it on Wi-Fi when I use my controller
because I only have one USB-C connection.
Now I'm just gonna look really shocked the entire time.
And again, I only freeze on this thing for some reason.
It's so weird.
I don't care that you're starving. Get away from me.
You little whiny bitches.
I don't know about that right now.
I need more beds.
I don't have enough beds for any of you.
Most intensive menu.
That's never happened before too when I streamed this.
Do you have cable from your controller?
Yeah, I have a USB-C going into my PC.
But I only have one USB-C on my PC.
It's nice because there's so many of you.
I can do double stuff.
Come on, get me to the top.
Yes, thank you.
The menu is consuming all the PC resources.
I didn't want to ask for another PC
when I was hired on.
I forgot who got a PC.
I didn't ask either.
Because he uses a laptop.
We're too nice.
They were just like, we'll buy you a 3DO, a PC, a mic.
And I'm like, no, I'm good. Just give me the 3DO.
One thing for doctrine.
Yeah, I built my PC back in 2017.
She has not been updated for quite a bit.
Yeah, oh yeah, we get spoiled.
Mommy and management spoilers.
I need bones.
Okay.
I can't do it because I don't got bones.
Oh, okay, now I can.
Collect reward from Strani.
Where is my little mother?
Mother, I need to speak to you.
Mom.
No, not Saber.
Strani, please.
Cool.
I can't wait to unlock fishing.
Because then I can just fish for hours and just talk to you guys.
Yeah, while fishing.
Oh, you look kind of cute just sitting there.
Get the fucking to work though.
Actually, I think there's actually nothing you can do.
Everything's taken up.
2008 here.
Jesus.
Do you need RAM then?
What do you mean, download RAM?
What?
Rounds well upgrade for a year from now.
I'll probably, like, when I get more established,
stop grumbling because you're hungry.
I'll just buy my own PC.
I just, I don't, I'd rather have the funds go to Gen 2
or go to, like, 3D or just go to
making, oh my god, you guys are legit starving,
but I don't have anything to give you.
Can I build a farm?
Hold on, let me see if I can build a farm first.
I seriously can't build a farm yet.
Dumb.
Oh wait, there it is.
Because I'm like, I think I have not a bright spot.
I do not have enough coins.
All right, some of you are going to die.
Sorry.
Yeah, go to sleep.
Die in your sleep.
It'll be fine.
$50.90.
I think I have a $10.70 in my computer.
I have a, I don't remember, do I have a $7.20 watt?
Power supply.
I don't have a $7.20 watt.
I don't have a $7.20 watt.
Do I have a $7.20 watt?
Power supply.
32 gigs of RAM.
I think it's DDR4.
It's a DDR5, I don't know.
I have a risen 2700.
I can't remember if it's 2700X or not.
But yeah, she needs to upgrade.
I've also just been too lazy to build a PC.
I'd rather just like, like I, I almost went to for computer engineering in school because I really enjoyed building PCs.
I remember I, um, my friend bent the pins on their computer so I was able to fix it and like solder it and all that shit.
That was really fun, but I'm way too lazy to build my PC again.
Although I think if even if I get a pre-built, I'll have to build it, but whatever.
And if, if that's the case, then I'll probably just end up building it myself and like do you like PC par picker?
Feel free to like give me suggestions on my marrows or whatever.
45.
I feel like a big, little big planet.
A risen, risen, I don't know.
Risen.
I always call it a risen.
Is it not, is it rising or risen?
I'll be risen you up.
That's for sure.
My mouth's not moving again, but it's fine.
I'm like moving my face around.
Nothing's happening.
Risen.
Risen.
A risen.
Risen.
Risen.
Cause it's like, isn't it risen?
Like it's been risen.
Like the, you know, Jesus has risen on the third day, that type of thing.
I don't know.
I'll riz you up.
I just realized you guys changed it to a hammer.
Cause I'm like, why is it taking me forever to do shit?
You think my voice acting would be good?
And that would help with, oh nice.
That would help with me singing, but it doesn't.
Risen, 5,800.
Probably get seeds.
Up.
I Reaper, you're dead.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna get seeds.
I'm gonna get bones actually now that I can kill them.
I'm gonna get seeds.
I'm gonna get the seeds.
I'm gonna get bones actually.
I'll get the seeds.
I'll get the seeds.

Oh literally like ten away.

Oh my god.

There's fucking twenty of you.
Oh my god I'm so done. I hope you all die.
I'm gonna water my plants.
You look so sad.
Oh he's reading a book.
Saint of the bum.
What the fuck?
Whatever. You guys can just revive yourselves.
What the fuck? That bird just came out of nowhere.
Where's the dead body? I can't.
I can't get to it cause you're all just fucking standing around it.
Perfect. Let's harvest your meat.
Yeah we're gonna harvest your meat.
Oh fuck I didn't do it right.
Right. Oh whatever.
Fuck where should we have the funeral shit?
Stop. No Azura!
No Azura. Somebody revive Azura please.
Oh my fucking god.
Thank god. Thank you.
She's like yeah I'm great.
Stop fucking dying.
Stop fucking dying.
Can you all stop?
Okay perfect.
Oh see you guys can just keep reviving yourself.
More meat for the grinder.
I'm definitely gonna get the thing that if you guys eat yourselves then you'll be fine.
Okay so we got that. All that's good.
I could do that. I need to get a prison.
Ooh prison.
I need a summoning circle.
When do I get a fucking toilet?
What?
What's that? Basic decorations?
All right well.
I'm making myself dizzy.
I'm free statue.
I guess I'll get you guys better beds.
No actually no I need these first.
Yeah I need these first desperately.
I'm gonna start with stone.
Cause it's really hard to get stone.
Sometimes.
You can revive unless you harvest the meat.
Okay gotcha. Zero deaths.
Zero deaths everyone.
I know you guys some of you guys will leave too when the faith's been low for a long time.
Time for a seven.
I guess you guys are all just shit everywhere then.
Okay.
It's crude ice blessing.
Yeah I don't care about that.

Being first.
Imagine yeah just getting starved to death and revive.

Kind of fucked up.

But I need, don't I need money for that?
Oh.
It's not.
We are speed running, call to the lamb.
Call to the Irish fam, famine? Nooo, don't say that.
Can I open still cradle?
Oh I can, I can open literally every door.
I realize we form a little star. It's cute.
Not again! What the f**k in Ireland? That's funny as hell.
I would have to build a prison soon and put Strani in it and pretty sad.
I don't have to put, what is that thing called? I forget.
I don't know.
I know you're gonna f**king show up. Let me just farm for a second.
Can you like, oh dammit.
It sounds like Jabba.
So it's true, the red crown sits upon the brow of another.
But how?
We did everything we could to.
It matters not, we need not bother Shamura with this, deal with it brother.
As you command my sister.
Ow.
I hate these bad things cause they can go off screen and I don't know where they go cause they're coming from.
Do not back me in a motherf**king corner.
F**k you, f**k you, f**k you.
Oh, missed you.
F**k you, f**k you.
F**k you in the booty cheek.
What pow, what pow, I got that boom boom pow.
Team Chicks being dragged in my style.
You wanna copy my sweat.
No, my shoe died.
Not my shoe.
How am I gonna step on bitches now?
Yeah, I need a correct.
Clap, clap, clap, get corrected, get corrected.
Hold on, while you do that weird animal thing, I'm just gonna farm cause I know you're super slow.
I know you're super slow.
Why am I not getting grass?
I can't make grassy gruel if I can not even getting any grass.
Okay, there we go.
I'm like usually there's like a higher chance of me to farm stuff.
I wonder if they changed it with update.
To the right, to the right.
Okay.
Why would I pick the other one at all?
So not trying to turn traitor, but can we get a caring cult leader?
I blame you guys.
You all decided to spawn it.
Like little bitches.
Okay.
And there's too many mounts to feed.
It's not my fault.
The game at this point only anticipates me having like five followers.
Ooh.
I got a necklace thingamabobba.
I can't, I was like trying to hit that like I could.
I'm not even using fervor.
We demand work benefits, you thought.
Fuck this fucking little bat shit.
I need a drink water.
Don't worry.
You guys are going to have some delicious grassy gruel in a moment.
I might have to get the grassy like eating grass trait.
At this rate because there's too many of you guys to feed.
Was there another way I could have gone?
I think there's like a maximum of only six or seven rooms, right?
Yeah, there was.
Okay.
What can we say?
Wonderland's getting good business in the swelma perks after our stay.
Guys, let's unionize.
Shut up!
Guys, let's create a self sculpt syndicate.
To be honest, with the collective brain power of 30 chatters,
at least one of us should have known how to farm.
I'm going to have to do this.
I'm going to have to do this.
I'm going to have to do this.
I'm going to have to do this.
I'm going to have to do this.
I'm going to have to do this.
I'm going to have to do this.
OK, let me get another drink real quick.
Oops.
Sorry, Reena, it didn't scare you.
Ow!
Oh, he's our rice table.

That's a damn shame.
Looks like there's shit on the ground.
Guys, I'm tactically refilling my food.
Maybe I'm going to heal, not needing followers.
I'm going to be real, not eating followers should have been the call 14 runs ago.
Yeah, well.
What can you do? I didn't know you'd all want to spawn in.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
Can I make it?
Can I make a stab you?
I can't.
Trying to get it to stab the thing.
Oh wait, I'm going to do this.
I'm dirt.
I knew that was going to get me.
I didn't realize the animation would last so long.
Oh shit.
I like the noise it makes when you have no more fervor.
See, I could, what do I have right now?
I don't think I have a pair of guts.
Let's get bones.
I'm looking to get bones.
No, let's fuck me.
Nevermind.
What the hell?
Oh, I forgot.
Fuck.
Fuck.
I never got the point of that weird ass bird thing, to be honest with you.
What the hell?
Let's do this.
Hey.
What's up? It's your voice.
Any penis?
I'm here to skate fast and eat your mom's ass.
St. Paul.
So is anyone else dreaming of food while they sleep?
Shut up.
Quit your whining.
I am the best cult eater ever.
I heard bodies in these rocks.
Oh wait, no, they're like bags of people.
Aw, that sucks.
Don't worry, I'm going to make you the best grass food when I get back to camp, okay guys?
So like everything will be fine.
Okay.
It's crumbling stuff, it's coming from the end approaches.
Yeah, let me get some stone.
Get a little stone, you know?
Give me fucking squirrel.
Okay, bye.
Camilla flowers are good for when you guys get sick.
So I'm going to snatch those up real quick.
Umi is giving Reina kisses below me.
It's very adorable.
You guys are missing out.
Pop the grass.
Are you more going to miss anything?
No, I'm good.
Just dreaming of rural.
This playthrough is just normal.
Oh my god, Jesus fuck.
You're fucked, mate, you're done.
The strong, he says, you're done.
You're done.
She loves saying that, it's adorable.
Ah, my nose edges.
I'm trying to scratch my nose.
I'm sick.
Ooh, I can get some nice flooring, guys.
Oh my god.
Are you excited? I'm excited.
I'm going to make it real pretty for us.
So we're going to have a really nice time.
I love interior decorating and call to the lamp.
Make it a really pretty place for us all to hang out, you know?
No.
Why do you shoot stuff?
Did they give you that power?
That's fucked.
I like kind of what I have going, so I'm not going to pick anything up.
I couldn't do the quest because I'm busy.
Busy trying to get you guys food.
All you guys do is bitch and moan.
How I don't feed you.
Oh, hi Serenity.
How are you doing, Serenity? What's up?
My favorite bunny girl.
Welcome to the Irish Famine.
To Shime Pougaloo.
Got someone raiding.
Oh, did you?
Serenity, raid us?
I wish I got an alarm when that happened.
Well, this game of sometimes music is like a mosquito in my room at 5 a.m.
Why, you don't like that?
We're not in the death loop.
What are you talking about?
I think there have been dice over here.
Yeah, you guys are fine.
Serenity, what were you streaming?
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.
It's their fault for starving.
They all, like, I have crowd control on.
They all decided to spawn at the same fucking time.
You know?
I think I'm actually...
Should I go with the...
I'll try to...
Actually, all my stuff just goes down.
So I'm not gonna bother with that.
It's a fervor.
They're all for starving.
Hey, you decided to join this cult
and spend your hard-earned coins.
And so you chose death.
It's not up to me.
It's not up to me.
It's up to, you know, the gods, the old gods.
Iron Reaper died again.
It's fine, don't worry about it.
Stop fucking dying.
You guys could, like, stop dying, that'd be great.
And you want some of this grass-fed long pig?
Stay dead.
You wanna starve, eh?
Yeah, you know?
Let me know how that goes.
Look over the corn.
It's looking mighty appetized.
All you guys are just role-playing in the chat.
That's adorable.
Barbados?
Oh, he an island gal.
He's an island gal.
Okay, well, at least his attacks don't go far.
Help.
No, put it a bit too early.
We're going a little bit farther.
I'm, like, really bad at tech,
telling depth of field in this game.
Like, when they do, like, those long-range attacks.
Because I still feel like they're going to hit me anyways.
Oh, I don't know why I spoke like that.
Just back a little bit.
It's easy, easy clap.
Easy, oh fuck.
Easy clap.
Easy clap.
I can't see.
Can you come over here?
Thank you.
Now I can see better.
It's fine.
Fine, don't worry about it.
Ooh, indicated the damage, perfect.
It's okay.
It's terrifying.
I know she's always terrified of death.
So she just fucking cries every time somebody dies.
I don't breathe in my face.
I want the air heating to have some play for her.
Where's the final looks of the game?
I don't even know what this thing is to be honest with you.
I was always confused by what this is.
It's not like a spider.
I won't be needing this.
Yeah, I'm not adding another follower.
I have two followers to indoctrinate.
I can't really refine anything yet.
Hey guys, it's fine.
I'm coming back with food.
Oh, they're sleeping bags.
It's a little spedable.
Yeah, you guys can use a new follower.
It's fine.
You can eat them both.
I am encouraging cannibals in this hope.
Yeah, I can't wait to get more doctrines.
Although I already could tell how hungry and sick they were.
So I don't know why they're giving me this.
Kitty, what are you doing?
When we're attacking the window, it's probably a bug.
Russian.
Yes, Russian.
Speaks Russian back at you.
Hello.
Hello.
Strony, stop being angry.
Come here.
No.
Strony is fucking leaving.
Oh my god, Strony left.
No.
Oh my fucking god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god, I'm so sad.
Strony left.
Strony left.
So fast.
Oh my god, they're dead.
Oh my god, they're dead.
Everybody's fucking...
I don't want to speak to people.
Oh god, oh fuck, oh god, oh fuck.
We might be falling apart just a bit.
Okay, I'm going to put the...
What the fuck is that?
What is this massive golden poop?
What is this massive golden poop?
What is this massive golden poop?
What is this massive golden poop?
I'm going to put...
So this will be the farming area.
So I'll put like the refinery stuff.
We're here.
Why can't I place it?
Why can't I place it there?
Oh, it's because there's a fucking tree there.
Are you serious?
Okay.
Guys, don't worry, I'm going to make you food.
Look at this.
Look at all these berries.
You guys are going to be able to eat.
Aren't you going to be so happy?
Look how far we've come.
Wait, let me get this giant poop.
Oh, there's two.
You guys are all angry and you have no faith.
I'm trying to harvest as fast as I can.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Guys, come and get it.
Oh my God.
Are you ready?
Look at all this food.
This delicious food to eat.
Well, you're not going to be able to enjoy any.
Oh my God.
Where did he go?
Stop whining and sighing over him.
He's fine.
He'll be back in a little bit.
I need to make a body pit.
Where's the fucking body pit?
Where's the fucking body pit?
Where's the fucking body pit?
Where's the body pit?
Where's the body pit?
Where's the body pit?
Where's the body pit?
Where's the fucking body pit?
Can I please make a body pit?
Okay.
Just because I know we're going to get to centers,
I'm just going to do this.
Ooh, naughty followers.
Okay.
Um, I don't know where should I put the fucking graves?
I'll put them over here.
Wait, can I only make one?
Fucking hell.
God damn it.
Well, sorry guys.
Azura gets precedent.
Wait, where is it?
Where is it?
Oh, I need to build it.
I might want to revive Amy.
All right.
It's time for a little sermon.
Actually, wait, let me see if you guys give me any money.
You know, it's time to have...
Oh, yee, a little faith.
Anapathizo.
Well, I got us, you know, I got to support my sister.
She gets, yeah, she gets special stuff.
There's a lot less people than they were here before.
I don't know what to do with that.
I'm not making you drink Kool-Aid.
You're just starving to death.
You know, there are monks that would mummify themselves
from eating as little as possible and staying in the same spot
and just, you know, doing prayer.
And I think you guys should be doing the same.
Also, when do I get to intimidate you
to give me your fucking money?
Because I don't know what to do with it.
I don't know what to do with it.
I don't know what to do with it.
To intimidate you to give me your fucking money
because I need money.
How'd you?
How'd you rest until you're not sick?
I was sick, okay.
I still have enough money.
What's up?
What's up Buttercup?
Want me to build decorations?
Oh my god.
Why are you guys so...
I can make...
I'll make your bed area look real nice.
You know?
Well, this isn't going as I thought it would, but...
Look at this. I'm making your bed area so cute.
You get to sleep on rocks.
I want to get rid of that.
Hold on, I'm not done yet.
What the fuck was that noise?
This is so pretty.
Dones and flowers.
Okay, he's this little sick guy hanging out.
Dope.
Oh, ain't that dapper.
Look at that. That's so pretty.
Cool.
That didn't count as a decoration.
Okay, well, let's just put...
What are these, motherfuckers?
God, there's...
I need an outhouse and a little cleaning thingy ASAP.
Do we have to choose between food and sleeping indoors?
Yeah.
Wait, I can't build.
Can I kill you?
I can't kill you.
Sorry, I was going to kill you, God's will.
That gives a little log what you guys fucking think about.
Okay, which one of you wants to be food?
Why are you angry?
I gotta do all the work around here.
Oh my God, Fia, what are you doing?
Hi, can you jump instead of clawing my chair, lady?
Sometimes, because she couldn't use her legs for a long time.
I think she forgot how to jump.
So she kind of just pulls herself up on things.
Hi, new girl.
Hi.
You gotta jump up if you want to get up here.
Angerly waters.
Do you want me to pick you up because you seem like you're struggling, ma'am?
Or you can just sleep with Reina in the cat bed.
Iris is hardly good at farming.
Clean everything.
It's a pigsty in here.
You guys just be shitted and farted all over the place.
Why is it so dirty?
Why is it so dirty?
Sick.
Sick, nasty.
I think we're good.
Oh, maybe because of the fucking bodies or everywhere.
That's why it's so gross.
Is there a sick?
Oh, god.
All right.
Can I make some beds for you guys?
I can make one bed.
Hell yeah, brother.
One of you guys will get to wake up and fight over this little bed.
All right.
Collect?
Oh, I'll do that when he wakes up.
I just brought her back.
Finally, let's let us end this.
I'll be awaiting you in my temple.
Come witness your true power.
What the fuck are you doing?
You have to untouch yourself.
Ma'am, come here so I can pick you up.
There you go.
Now I have a snuggly baby.
How's the game going? It's going good.
I got a kitty cat on my lap.
She's purring up a storm.
She's sticking her butt in my face because she's weirdo.
Yeah, can I get some kitty purrs for the mic?
Can you get a little bit?
What are you doing?
Oh, you guys are missing out.
I can't wait for monetization because then you get the cat cam and you can see her cuteness.
Because she likes to roll on her back.
I'm going to show give me her tummy so I can rub her tummy.
She's a small little kitten girl.
She's a small little baby.
Let everybody hear your purrs for you.
I don't know if you can hear it.
Yeah, I don't think it's picking up.
She'd be staring at me when she just asked me if I'd be okay here.
Where are you going, Lee?
She's rubbing up her ass against the microphone.
Okay.
She got distracted. I think there's somebody walking by.
Are my landlord listening for extra cash?
Where are weapon damage, double the health when healing?
I can't, I think I have, I don't remember if I have a vampiric weapon.
Or not, I think it's just baneful.
So I'm going to go with this one.
Wait, was it vampiric dagger?
I think it was, fuck me.
Why do I have to have the worst memory imaginable?
Can I farm everything over here?
Okay.
The other deathbed companion.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Get poisoned, get poisoned.
I can't see what the fuck's happening.
Cool, alright.
The river just dried up real quick.
Can you hear that in the background?
That's Fia drinking water.
There's a fox on the water coming from her cat fountain.
I don't know why she does that.
She's done that ever since she was a little baby.
Nope, I like this. Why are there so many spikes?
Okay, this is easier for me.
Let's do a little farming, shall we?
What the fuck was that?
Am I tripping or did I just hear something?
What was that?
I just heard something that sounded like it was coming backwards.
Am I losing my mind?
Your dono sound?
That shouldn't come out backwards.
The Texas species doesn't sound like that.
Hold on.
Someone tipped?
Did you scare me?
Please, let's stop letting us starve, you cruel, cruel mistress.
That sounded so weird, the Texas species just gets garbled.
Thank you for the tip, Anonymous. You're the best.
Yeah, I think the game sound overcame it.
Was Arizona longer ill?
I forgot the name for Donovan and Sheba.
Yeah, I knew. What were you talking about?
Thanks, Anonymous. That's what their name was.
I don't know what to tell you.
Don't tell me how to do my job.
Thank you, Anon.
Anon? I would say Anon.
Souls of the Damned. I'm haunted by your donation alert.
Sorry, I just looked at my text and my friend texted our group chat.
We have a group chat, me and my friend.
I already talked about her before and I gave her the code name Salem.
Any other girl? I'll call her Olive.
Olive, because she's Greek.
So Olive and Salem, Olive just texted.
Guys, we're all hot. We should get pregnant and procreate.
So spread our genes.
Just like what?
I don't know the context of the conversation.
I haven't been looking at the group chat that we have together.
I was just out of context.
I was glanced and saw it pop up.
We're all hot. We should all get pregnant.
Olive Gardening kind of based for that.
My God.
It's because we're all around the baby fever age.
One of them was married, one of them was engaged.
They got them hormones.
Me, I'm sitting here with my three cats and I'm doing okay.
Kids are way too fucking expensive.
That's why I run Wonderland instead.
I'm a business woman. I'm a career woman.
Oh, I forgot I have a disease heart.
I'm not a...
I'd be a great mom. I'd be a great fucking mom.
Sleeping bag has collapsed.
At least they're no longer ill.
Because I cook.
I stay mostly clean.
I'll support the child emotionally.
I have a job.
I'm pretty.
I'm cultured.
The child would be brought up well.
I don't have a job.
I'm cultured. The child would be brought up well.
So yeah, I'd be the perfect mother.
That's all you need, right?
Childs in this economy, not children.
Childs.
I guess you're all adopted. You're all my children.
The dying star will light again.
Inflation is hitting harder.
I did leave the tweets, though, because I didn't want people to freak out.
But I was saying that my landlord wants to raise my rent to 2,300.
No! Thank you.
Oh, wait.
And I'm just like, kill me.
Let's see.
I can't.
What the fuck is that? I get a tarot card? I don't really care about that.
I'm going to prioritize materials.
Living in Darnia? No, cost of living where I am is just really expensive.
For one bedroom.
In some places, it's 1900 for a studio.
Isn't that fucking whack?
I hate America.
Although, I wonder if it's easier.
It's move? Yeah, it's so easy to move.
My whole family is up here. Actually, some of my family is south.
I'm also someone who fucking hates change.
And my friends and my family up here, so I would be very terrified to move to some place that has a lower cost of living.
Especially because you guys know I tend to isolate myself.
Yeah, like moving is cheaper.
Right now, I do pay 1500, but because of all the stuff with my cats, they're just like, well, 2,300.
Actually, let me check my email.
She literally, you know how petty she fucking is?
She sends the email about possibly evicting me for that.
And then, and it was 10 minutes before the office closed.
So when I sent my response, she didn't have the response.
The office was open today, but I don't think she was in.
And so she's just like letting me sit.
Like what sort of fucking maniacal being are you?
To email someone, oh, you're gonna get evicted if this is a change.
And then let them stew over that over the weekend.
Like how fucked is that?
I'm just like, I hate these landlords. Our last ones were so much fucking nicer.
And it's like, oh my God.
And like, and I'm not like, oh, because like, yes, it was a lease violation having more than two pets, whatever.
But they send the most passive aggressive on professional emails.
Like, so we have like a pool at our place, right?
There's like a pool.
And before you could like rent out the space to have host like gatherings and whatever.
So they got rid of that.
Now you have to have like a sort of like ticket thing to go to the pool.
You can only bring one other person with you.
So if I wanted to have like my friends with me or my parents come over and just like hang by the pool,
I would only be able to take like my mom or my dad.
Just dumb.
And if I violate that more than like three times, they'll evict me.
Oh no.
So they'll take away my pool privileges and then they'll evict me.
And then what else?
Oh yeah, they just, they would were towing people that had the right stickers.
And then when people were like, hey, I was towed by the towing company when I had the right information on my car.
They were like, sorry, it's on the towing company.
It's not on us.
And so you'd have to, I remember my neighbor, my sweet little old man neighbor I have.
What the fuck do you want?
Got towed and he had to pay $300 to get his car back.
You may think yourself clever.
You may think yourself righteous and your service to him.
But you cannot be so trusting of the chained one.
Oh well, it's too late for talk.
One such as you deserves no absolution.
This will not end well for you.
I remember staring again.
I'm just trying to farm shit.
Oh, I'm feeling.
And yeah, I feel bad for older people that lived in the building.
I saw like there was this really sweet disabled old woman that lived on the first floor and she moved out because I think they raised her rent on her.
She was like this little cute old woman with a walker.
I helped her bring in her groceries once.
And I haven't seen her since and I'm worried that she had to move or was evicted for whatever fucking reason.
Like it's just all they want is money.
Like when I was first moved in here, everything was so much cheaper and they raised the rent.
Like a two bedrooms like almost 3K.
Bricks.
I'm about to get bricked up.
They're still there at the first.
Oh yeah.
And I know like you know how like places will like you'll be like you give the deposit and then they just kind of like say something.
Stupid and then they won't get like so my building is like fairly new.
I get like leaks in my windows and so the seal isn't good.
And so I have like brown all under my windows because of the stain from the water and the paint peels off.
And I'm like, I hate it here.
Rent control should be the norm 100%.
Yeah, I know New York has rent control.
I think, right?
Sometimes you can tell with like little stars and stuff.
What?
Oh hey, it's that guy.
Hey kiddo, keep your eyes off my fishies.
Alright, enough with the both of us.
The best fishing can be found at Pilgrim's Passage.
Where's that you say?
Let me show ya kid.
For real, I mentioned one streamer having a donathon chat on past the goals.
They were like, use the rest of money to move out.
Yeah, that would, I'm not going to lie.
When I do my birthday donathon.
I'm torn between using it to like my cut to do 3D or move out.
Cause like I know if I move out and get a little spot, like that'll be best.
Cause then I can just literally do whatever the fuck I want.
Wish I could fish.
Move out 100%.
And it's like cause like I thought like everything would be fine when I moved out of my parents house.
But like there's always something.
Like an apartment, landlord is always something.
I feel bad for my parents too.
Cause I know they want to buy a house.
But my mom got screwed on something.
Some person from her job screwed up her taxes.
And so she has to pay like so much taxes and interest back.
Because of one little temps mistake.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get a bug?
Cause you're freaking me out.
You're going to fall.
Sorry, I don't mean to complain.
Just telling you what it is.
Telling you what's on my mind.
Just so you, sorry, I'm destroying your entire camp.
I hope you don't mind.
I'm just hungry and I need to feed my people.
Just like how there's like still fire coming from the ground when the fire is gone.
Haha.
He's spitting bars.
Yeah, and like I'm not, don't, oh my god, but we just fell.
I told you, I warned you dude.
But I know like the other girls have it more difficult me.
Cause like I live in my apartment.
I live alone.
It's great.
I know like some other girls with their family.
So, or like live in an area where it's really noisy.
So I'm thankful for what I have and for how much I have to pay.
For now.
Like trust me, I'm very, very much full of gratitude.
For what I do have.
Sometimes you just need a vent.
And I normally I would use my, I'm already full.
I would use my alt, but I'm scared to vent into the boy that is 17k people.
Haha.
That's cool.
That's great.
I'm trying to, do you have anything here that I can steal or break?
No?
All right.
It's fine while I'm here.
We appreciate it.
Talking about stuff is like, like this.
I actually, to be more to say like, I think so.
The listening, understanding, like bro, mounting, and you, and then we're just singing, right?
It's a great time to be in the line of the place.
Also, in the creature's life.
Yeah, 100%.
If you have the ability to save, definitely save for a house.
Although it's really hardly even the housing market's trash right now.
Wait, what?
She really just went in the complete wrong direction.
Am I fucking stupid?
Oh yeah, I am.
Save, always save as much as you can.
Like save first and last and also like an extra month.
Like save first last.
If you can save first and last twice, you're golden.
And it sucks because like they say like, oh, your rent should be like 30% of your income.
Like that's not the case.
Like my rent's like majority of my income.
Then the rest of it goes to the cats and then I sometimes get food.
It's savings hard too.
Like I also have like a lot of school debt I have to go through.
I gotta pay off my credit card because I spent $8,000 trying to save Fia's life with her shit that she had going on where she couldn't move.
For a month and a half and that was some of you guys know from back when I was a priestess how fucking harrowing that was.
She's here, she's fine, she's alive.
That's all I cared about.
Come here you fucking squirrel!
I always put my babies first.
It's a one-bed appointment.
Appointment? Yeah.
Some people will pay about $1.50 right now.
I think it's more than that.
$50, $60, $100.
Yeah, she's much better.
She's much better now.
Guys close the whole video game on the same?
Aw, rip.
I'm sorry bro.
But like despite all the stuff that I've been like dealing with, I'm just so fucking thankful I'm here with you guys.
Like I'm so fucking thankful I'm a realer.
Cause all I wanted, like one of my goals was just to be in there and see all I wanted to do.
I just wanted to hang out with cool people.
And the fact that it was my dream agency that I really wanted to be in, makes it a-
I'm sorry bro.
But like despite all the stuff that I've been like dealing with.
The fact that it was my dream agency that I really wanted to be in, makes it all a more sweeter.
Cause Strani's old fanbase, I'm like I want that.
I want just like like-mighted people like that.
And I have it.
It's great.
You don't have a fucking fucking bit.
Oh hi Reina.
Are you gonna-
Oh man.
Oh, you almost fell.
Ow, your claws are fucking digging into me.
Okay, I'll give you a little hug.
Yeah, hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.
Why am I so small?
That's fine.
I appreciate, I'm happy you guys stuck around since debuts and stuff.
I genuinely thought people wouldn't like me.
The brainworms got to me for a little bit.
But it seems like everybody enjoys all the girls, which makes me just happy.
Yeah, I just- I just- I'm a-
I'm a-
Not to be-
Not to be emo or anything, but I'm a very lowly person and streaming is like the closest thing I get to like speaking my truth.
Hanging out with people.
Cause sometimes-
Like when you-
Are like from the internet and stuff,
I feel like I can't-
Like I'm not my friends like VTubers, not my friends like-
I have a couple of friends like anime.
Like-
It's nice or like streaming or anything.
I only have like one other streamer friend and I think she even quit.
Funny you generally like about to. Thank you.
You alert to each other on my timeline on other passages.
No, check out everyone streaming down here.
Autonic love.
No, send me your true love.
Oh, I'm feeling me.
Disgraceful.
I have to make some grasp rule.
Yeah, I'm just really glad I'm here and that it's been my dream since I was a little girl to be a content creator.
Now I get to, you know, pour myself out on the internet, but in a better way as an anime girl.
I grow tired of you little lamb.
Time to put an end to this frivolous masquerade!
I'm on my own. I'm on my own.
Yeah, they all killed themselves.
Thank you, thank you.
I'm a terrible cult leader, but I'm a person.
It's funny as hell.
Oh.
Actually, I don't really care about the little guys too much, unless they get in the way.
I don't know why.
Sometimes I forget where I am.
Usually I kill all the little guys and then I leave one alive, but I accidentally just fucking killed one.
So then he doesn't spawn them again.
I wish that would have effected them.
Okay, I'll leave that guy alive.
Oh, damn it, he spawned more.
Fuck.
What?
I was not paying attention to my health.
What the fuck?
Did you guys kill me?
Oh yeah, someone in chat killed me.
Well, whoever did that, fuck you.
Totally wasn't deserved.
Thank you, starving cultist, for tipping.
My fellow cultist is time to rebel.
We have nothing to lose, but this is the show on our accurate valve for food.
Oh, that's funny as fuck.
Follow me?
Let's see what's going on for the fun.
Sometimes it, but...
That's how speak works.
Drag's still on?
Yeah, I might turn that one off.
The randomly just kill me one.
I didn't know that was a, that was a thing.
Cause I know someone will just trigger that again.
Why does Strony's Texas speech work so well?
Mine doesn't at all.
I think some of the settings override each other.
Traitor among us.
Hope I won't resurrect any of the followers now.
That's just how it's gonna be.
Do you think we're getting pretty mad at the whole cultist uprising thing?
This might get dicey.
He doesn't know where to get.
No.
I think...
I think there's something that's overriding everything.
It was like when you did one of them at works.
And I made it so that...
I made it so that...
I made it so that...
I made it so that...
I made it so that...
I made it so that...
I made it so that...
I made it so that...
Creations are always like that!
Okay, you're gonna see me, like...
