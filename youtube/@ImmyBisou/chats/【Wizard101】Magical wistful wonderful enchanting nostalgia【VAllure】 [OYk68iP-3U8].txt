cinctulus	6279325	probably not lol
[A.B.I.] Xairen	6281697	TERA was really fun because it wasn't just a select and spam keyboard.
FargoneMyth	6281933	What was the name of the TERA private server?
Frippe_	6291380	I think Neverwinter is like Tera, unsure.. didn't play much tera
FargoneMyth	6291455	I swear I heard the name somewhere and that Kirsche played it

Ethernity 🎃🩹	6395920	wasn't Tera really popular with vtubers early on?
FargoneMyth	6396010	Porn :B
Mikeylel🎃🩹	6405766	Lmao
Heie.hr3888	6415003	We were talking about Tera 
FargoneMyth	6420180	I know Kirsche and Pippa played it.
Raoku	6420975	well the emulator would cause it to start it would get stuck at finding a server
FargoneMyth	6436561	That's okay, to each their own. ^^
[A.B.I.] Xairen	6455109	Were vtuber even a thing back then?
shwomplr	6460403	skyrim with mods goes insanely hard, but it does take a great deal of effort to actually get the game to work
Frippe_	6463500	Did you play Perfect World? :p
Canary Faerie	6463857	ps4 emulators are barely a thing unfortunately too
AK	6465736	Skyrim is amazing the magic kinda sucks but with mods it’s a lot better
shwomplr	6470642	so its understandable
SquishyGhool	6478884	Digital puppet shows 
Raoku	6478895	wasnt Kizuna AI the first VTuber?

FireHill20	6595382	Monkey Wizard Raid
SquishyGhool	6601096	The world has to have floating mountains and purple trees. Skyrim is just like colorado. I want fantasy, not a windows screensaver
