Something Original	2497800	Wait, there are other VTubers besides Immy?
Canonlin	2501469	that shylily situation was wild she really got dragged into it for no reason
Juan🎃🩹	2504147	last i heard she has another persona.
JerryFreshEsch 🎃🩹	2504339	wait yeah what happened?
GraMMa	2506137	that was something too, ugh..
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2506774	Yes
CrackRacing	2509328	Immy loves spilling the tea
Root VegetabIe	2509950	Hey Immy!
Ron Johnson	2510759	Tons of discourse about niji in the past year

StinkMeat	2521509	Immy drama alert nation 
Root VegetabIe	2524836	If you had to choose one Dark Souls character to mercilessly jerk you off until your bag was mush and you were begging for them to stop, which character would you pick and why?
pen kai	2531671	idk why its even a thing when shylily had the same thing said about her by viebae
theDeathBerry🎃🩹	2535877	I'm not obsessed with drama it just keeps showing up on my feed okay
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2535892	Immy drama alert streams soon?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2537594	Lmao
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2544707	Oh....
animajunki123	2547283	copying shylilies model and stuff right? I recall that
S0ltinsert	2550937	it's a little ironic that she used to face the same allegation herself before
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	2551387	Lola something or other, yeah
Darkshaman	2557536	lola
Ethernity 🎃🩹	2558694	+
Amhran	2561535	I think its all super stupid
pen kai	2562174	its irrelevant
Crono Time	2563830	I'd watch immy drama watch a longs
cinctulus	2567572	no thoughts :_Buffer:
GreaseCat🎃🩹	2568071	They dogpiled her?
TechNinja_420	2572380	ngl, most of the vtubers are pretty cringe and its not my jam, but i like VAllure, because you girls are cool and pretty funny and you guys most importantly of all are genuine and i respect that 
Raoku	2573815	i dont think
DarkCFC	2574214	oh, that was a while ago, did it escalate recently?
Canti 🎃🩹	2574764	it's messed up but blown out of proportion
CrackRacing	2575340	it's very sad that she felt pressured into saying something about it,glad it seems to be resolved tho
Greedy_Seagull	2575408	game is game
EasyPeazy	2579424	i dont know enough to give an opinion
TheJemsen	2581779	hey immy!
urinal cheesecake 🎃🩹	2581957	no thoughts tbh, just dont care about it
kurokamitenshi	2587417	there was a time when shylily was compared to veibae too, like shylily was discount veibae or whatever
GraMMa	2587552	veibae, yeah
cinctulus	2589158	ah yeah
ManiSolKatti	2589478	It was pretty blatant when the speech change clip came out
Jun ジュン	2589945	it's not nice to pressure the main person to make some sort of statement when they don't want to. best not to bother people with a thing, unless they themselves start talking first
S0ltinsert	2590501	yeah
ReconCrusader	2590885	correct
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	2591158	yeah
Sai_ Bu11et	2591900	I feel like it's all for the sake of drama to get attention...
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2592377	Her model doesnt even look similar to shylily
Childsbrad	2594543	theyre are going to be similar models eventually its stupid
pen kai	2595756	yes
CrackRacing	2596043	more than accused it was just a little jab
Canonlin	2597697	it was all ridiculous but to say she didnt take heavy influence from lily would just be wrong it shouldnt have blown up like it did
Ethernity 🎃🩹	2602247	there is a saying that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery
Elemental 201X	2603634	didn't know that
Crono Time	2604211	like she's wrong for copying but Shylily fans went FERAL
Sleepy 	2604620	the world is a small ol
Silver	2606719	thoughts and feelings? all we know is Immy, Immy is love immy is life
Sleepy 	2609907	place
Jon Omni	2616172	It did seem a little sus with rebrand and the similar name, catchphrase, and model
GreaseCat🎃🩹	2617805	How did shylily respond to it or the other vtuber?
Elemental 201X	2619977	but tbh vei and nyanners do sound a bit similar
animajunki123	2623317	I don't care much about it. It's almost impossible to be original in the Vtuber scene without someone intentionally or unintentionally copying 
TechNinja_420	2631674	"normal" lol
Mew Edits Ch.	2634118	are you telling me i should see other vtubers?
Canonlin	2637901	shylily eventually responded but her response was just leave me alone essentially 
Arles_The_Rabbit	2638441	I don't care about the voice stuff cause ik like two girls irl that sounds like her
askterix_	2640860	it's fine to use her as inspiration but lola should have known people would point out the similarities so she really should have put more effort in differentiating herself to avoid drama.
Raoku	2641334	nope only immy
Elemental 201X	2641456	the "normal" in question
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2647036	I do like other vtubers, just obsessed with you
Irving D	2647510	LUL

GreaseCat🎃🩹	2655961	I see I see 
Wolfy The Wolfy	2666106	Alright what did i miss
Ron Johnson	2671031	disliking how common the witch hunt type mobs are popping up in the vtubersphere honestly
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2672884	@TheLieIncomplete kinda based
Fafnir	2680521	I get the copping model desing but wichhunt is soo mad thing to do 
Canti 🎃🩹	2683140	I can't wait until Immy has a big tasty drama. I'll defend you to my dying breath online

Monster Hmc	6081477	oh that xd

Greedy_Seagull	6105338	money laundry 
TechNinja_420	6107428	yeah, they can be, but casinos even small ones are even better for that, dont ask how i know 
penguin00001	6107924	@LordAziki Massage Therapists are usually a good/better first stop than someone calling themselves a chiro
George Martinez	6126159	no jokes, some are fronts for that
Wrench	6126319	well theres two types of chiropractors, Physical therapy chiropractors, and homeopathic chiropractors. Try and find a physical therapy one, cause they are worth the money
Jun ジュン	6128306	chiropracting isss technically a form of pseudo-science 
penguin00001	6130685	in america/canada no there is no official school, in the UK and EU there's a required medical school degree
pen kai	6134945	 its a poormans medical profession
Something Original	6138663	That's because it's not based on science or anything
Rob	6141249	There was a video where a chiropractor was literally watching chiropractor tutorial videos while performing on a patient
