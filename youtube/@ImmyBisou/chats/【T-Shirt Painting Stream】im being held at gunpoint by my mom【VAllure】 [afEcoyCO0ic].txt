Denyal	8658041	she was the biggest earner at the time i think
Stashpower💔	8660139	She was pretty big
Jonnyboy48🎲	8660803	@Mufasa lol
Ethernity 🎃🩹	8663577	I'm so out of the loop, I only have enough time to watch you and some of the other VAllure girls :_Sad:

Reefling Cuttles🦑🛐	8663777	She was the most superchatted vtuber I think
Nero2276🦑🛐	8665841	I think it was Powdur
ReconCrusader	8667982	the more ppl learn about rushia the worse she gets...
Geoff	8669812	What, you mean the vtuber who copied Lily?
FargoneMyth	8674906	STILL the biggest superchat
Panopticon	8676847	Coco had the most, she was second, i think
theDeathBerry🎃🩹	8677115	I remember even moistcritikal mentioned rushia at least in passing
MrObby	8681323	:_Note::_Note::_Note:
Shuggleoth	8683192	the twitch drama just has everyone panicking too in the vtuber space, and streamers in general
Ronnie_G	8683786	I was watching an old podcast talking about pre- Vallure drama earlier today.
Juan🎃🩹	8693633	mikeneko became a lolcow in japan
Kimono Gamer	8696283	In your experience is Vtuber drama happening more than regular streamer drama? Cus I’ve never interacted with streaming at all before Vtubers and I don’t know if it’s actually more drama than irl.
cinctulus	8700201	she really is
Doctor P	8701392	Immy is a little drama frog it’s cute :_Love:
RightHandSun	8701483	I knew the selen thing was big when my brother knew of it XD
samurai3502	8701536	mhm mhm
YepCog🎃🩹	8704645	The things she did were very on brand for her lmao
Nero2276🦑🛐	8707436	she still is
Geoff	8715843	Rushia is not just the biggest Holo earner, she's STILL one of the ten biggest earners of all time on all of Youtube
Denyal	8715903	that's why she still has a following, despite everything she has done
Panopticon	8717528	Bro - (not)Rushia is a headcase and needs help, I feel bad for everyone going after her. She really needs therapy.
Canonlin	8719442	she was truly giving the gfe
Mufasa	8723046	i heard she's requesting a boyfriend
Opresser 005	8723260	I'm pretty sure one year she was the #1 streamer on youtube
Kawaii Idoc	8726745	But what she do though?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	8732029	The thing is it wasnt roleplay yeah...
Nero2276🦑🛐	8745117	oh yeah, now Rushia said she's looking for a boyfriend
Canonlin	8747648	there's a new collab feature built into twitch that apparently activates your webcam automatically 
ManiSolKatti	8753026	facecam activated in new feature
Jeez Louis	8763898	Asmongold got a whole video on anycolor drama
Denyal	8764503	I like how passionate your voice becomes talking about drama
AngelMC7	8765625	wait she actually got engaged with a fan irl
Nero2276🦑🛐	8771549	@Canonlin:jack_o_lantern::adhesive_bandage: that's straight up violation of privacy
Shuggleoth	8777579	there are new rules rolling out for music streaming, karaoke streams are in limbo on twitch as well as other musical stuff
Geoff	8777809	Two twitch dramas ongoing - the karaoke ban, and the "anyone can collab with anyone else whether the second streamer wants it or not" thing
RightHandSun	8788428	the new twitch "knocking" thing?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	8792522	@Canonlin:jack_o_lantern::adhesive_bandage: what the fuck?
Panopticon	8800695	Nah dawg, she WAS MARRIED
Nero2276🦑🛐	8801656	now
Shuggleoth	8807174	OH people are just ANNOYED about the knocking thing lol
samurai3502	8807515	unles...
cinctulus	8808911	it was such a good idea lol
銀漢	8809728	would or wouldn't for immy rings? 
Jeez Louis	8814187	she got engaged and divorced mafumafu
Dylan Curry	8814496	Drama ends up being lots of “he said, she said” nonsense
Juan🎃🩹	8814693	did you see how mikeneko acted in this rust server, the streamers in that server used her as lolcow, it was CRAZY
Mufasa	8815597	IMMY ENGAGEMENT RINGS WHEN
Nero2276🦑🛐	8815681	she said in a recent interview
Denyal	8816115	RIGHT BEFORE the drama exploded, the rings got refunded because of it
urinal cheesecake 🎃🩹	8818310	it is a little funny
Nero2276🦑🛐	8819387	said it
Canti 🎃🩹	8820656	I would buy an Immy engagement ring in a heartbeat
Mikeylel🎃🩹	8821422	WAIT SHE GOT MARRIED TO A VIEWER??
ReconCrusader	8821888	i dont mind the ring merch but... being married while selling rings... :weary_face:
Canonlin	8822082	she was playing the game and making money playing it
Rono Chider	8823603	Rushia NTRed her secret husband i thought
MrObby	8832795	:_Note:
AngelMC7	8834666	where's our ring IMMY??'
Denyal	8835778	I bet cover loss a lot of money with those rings
Panopticon	8840230	"who would buy an engagement ring" A LOT of people.
ReconCrusader	8843359	@Mikeylel:jack_o_lantern::adhesive_bandage: nope
Nero2276🦑🛐	8843751	@ReconCrusader GFE at its finest
Heie.hr3888	8845966	We need Immy ring UwU

Yogiボークマちゃん (クマYogi)	8848747	what's a lolcow
cinctulus	8850617	i feel bad for her lately tbh
ReconCrusader	8854824	@Nero2276:squid::place_of_worship: :skull:
Geoff	8855541	Mike is more parasocial than her fans
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	8865265	yup
Kawaii Idoc	8866187	CONTEXT people, context!
Panopticon	8869097	She was just unaware of how Rust is as a game and got butthurt when people were mean to her when she wasnt being helpful
Panopticon	8874717	and she ended up crying
optix	8880000	how did shirt stream become vtuber drama talk 
KBGamer96	8880436	me learning more and more about vtuber drama :0
BasicallyWiz	8883468	Wait, the streamer streaming doesn't have to accept the collab?
Bean Meister	8883827	In the rust server she was basically going around begging to be apart of people's groups and getting KOSed on sight until she got into a group, upon which she stole resources from to give to 
Geoff	8890338	The new karaoke ban on Twitch is significantly worse than the way YT handles it
Jeez Louis	8890385	we need a member only drama gossip stream
Bean Meister	8890992	another clan because it had a big streamer in it
Mikeylel🎃🩹	8893449	Ohhh that stream... basically she allowed ppl to enter discord and say stuff to her without any restrictions I think
Ruin Desolation🦑🛐	8894141	it was cute, until the whole....thing...happened
MrObby	8894222	:_Headpat:
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	8899038	The collab thing sounds so half baked, it apparently turn your webcam on or something...
GraMMa	8900649	:_Headpat::_Headpat:
Canonlin	8901485	it is automatically turned out but you have to accept it for it to actually happen
Carney_rob	8903269	I gotta dip big homie have a beautiful day
urinal cheesecake 🎃🩹	8905540	:_Headpat::_Headpat::_Headpat:
Denyal	8906588	yes, you cannot turn it off, you have o set it to "favorites only" and then never add anyone to favorites
zurich957	8907307	anyone you follow can start a colab with you, or something like that.
Shuggleoth	8907865	these rules, from what i read, are a LOT harsher, and can strike your channel while live, not just the VODs
Rono Chider	8909392	My old Little sister:_Headpat::_Headpat::_Headpat:
RightHandSun	8911474	twitch is something else man...
Mikeylel🎃🩹	8911858	I hate bright lights as well...
Kawaii Idoc	8916108	Immy is a Batgirl, confirmed
Jeez Louis	8930039	partners i think
Bean Meister	8936444	her original clan found out and she was kicked out and went around the rest of the server time chasing people are a naked and being KOSed until I think she started crying? That's just what I remember
Bean Meister	8937053	heaing
Shuggleoth	8938300	and you CAN do karaoke, but it has to be done "in good faith" and with live instrumentals not prerecorded stuff
Reefling Cuttles🦑🛐	8948367	What about a coc ring?
FargoneMyth	8950732	Yes
cinctulus	8950934	yeah 
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	8956408	Yes
Nebulosity [ネビュロシティー]	8958376	You can just give me a strip of aluminum foil shaped like a ring
Denyal	8959510	you can trick the system, but no turn it off, and apparently the ambassador that is pushing it is being outed as a creep and a groomer of other vtubers
MrObby	8964998	lol
Geoff	8971247	No, only the person making the collab request needs to be an affiliate. Everyone else needs to set their thing to "whitelist only" in order to prevent it
FargoneMyth	8974397	Yeah, Immy should only be a regular whore ;b
Nombie	8975799	here for the tea pfft :relieved_face::hot_beverage:
Heie.hr3888	8981046	Drama whore? That's hot :P
Shuggleoth	8995282	then the "free vtuber asset cards" were REALLY bad, people were very upset
ReconCrusader	9000843	we love our whores!(affectionate) 
cinctulus	9000912	:_AHH:
Mikeylel🎃🩹	9010896	omg the drama.....
Canonlin	9011664	she says she loves to see the vtuber drama but missed the biggest drama of the day...
Nero2276🦑🛐	9015979	wait, they banned karaoke streams on twitch? Well, add that to the list of idiotic things done by Twitch
Ponyboy💔	9034389	copyright music....
cinctulus	9035688	major labels secretly hate music
Geoff	9036348	Twitch doesn't hate karaoke, they hate vtubers
Denyal	9043899	being "unarchived" karaoke doesn't fix it?
Dylan Curry	9046801	Because the music industry is the worst
Mikeylel🎃🩹	9048123	Yeah twitch just htes vtubers...
Nero2276🦑🛐	9052612	it doesn't make sense tbh
Jeez Louis	9052643	maybe intellectual property
Kawaii Idoc	9054886	Well I'm about to go home, eat, and sleep. Enjoy the rest of the stream Immy! Bye all!
Lonely Glizzy	9056403	2d women discrimination 
Bean Meister	9058489	Another thing, before the rust drama I think, she did like a interview type stream where anyone can join and she got A LOT of trolls who made fun of her or something
Ethernity 🎃🩹	9058761	this place is a cafe for drama. just sipping the :hot_beverage: now :_Cozy:
Stashpower💔	9061981	Because everything is copyrighted, they want you to buy their products, not share them for free.
Denyal	9068026	Twitch is doing a lot of stupid stuff 
zurich957	9068375	the webcam thing sounds like fear mongering
ReconCrusader	9078092	Rushia tried to sneak in with some vtubers, ditched them to be with the big japanese streamers and they treated her like an unwanted slave 
Canonlin	9078254	it turns your camera on if you are the person who is requesting the collab not if you accept
Nero2276🦑🛐	9079183	@Bean Meister yep
Heie.hr3888	9080815	@Kawaii IdocTake care and sleep well! <3
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	9082049	Could be fake tbf, just what I heard
Jeez Louis	9083038	real
Ponyboy💔	9083341	twitch is weird, strange and stupid
SleepyFenix🦑🛐	9083612	they didn't out right ban it, you just have to have express permission for the copyright holders now. which might as well be banned imo
samurai3502	9086855	vtubers in hot tubs tho
Geoff	9097586	"unarchived" is not enough, you can get bonked live if it's anything other than a public domain composition or your own original music
Shuggleoth	9098540	ASMR hate is real
Something Original	9102999	Music companies hate karaoke, because they can't stand the idea of someone listening to music (even crappy karaoke) for free
No One Special🐰👠	9121766	that sounds like an invasion of privacy.
Shuggleoth	9128439	i won't mention the specific people... but i know a few chuuba that are trying to navigate their alt accounts being shadow banned
Doctor P	9130698	it’s solving a problem that doesn’t exist
Nero2276🦑🛐	9130945	@SleepyFenix:squid::place_of_worship: which practically equals to it being banned lol
No One Special🐰👠	9131449	sounds like an easy lawsuit.
ViewtifulDevil	9132551	Both platforms do be sucking
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	9139677	6/10
Geoff	9144209	How does it work? Poorly. It works poorly.
Denyal	9145598	the creep pushing this feature also has a history of going into smaller vtubers chats with his ambassador medal and force himself into voicecalls with girls
Ruin Desolation🦑🛐	9156027	Twitch mods are compromised due to the fact that they listen to their streamers whining about other content makers, particularly women content makers
Nombie	9161763	ew

cinctulus	9175694	might work lol
samurai3502	9176632	oldest trick in the book
Nero2276🦑🛐	9187847	so, how long till Twitch backtracks as usual? Lol
