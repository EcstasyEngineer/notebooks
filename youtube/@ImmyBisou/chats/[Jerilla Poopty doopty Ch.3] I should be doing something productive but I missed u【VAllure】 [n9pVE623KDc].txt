Nihongohorni Dodemo	1722328	That was a glitch it seems
KBGamer96	1730468	soooo immy when do we get to see you where the new collar you got :3
Canonlin	1745060	you lost progress i think immy you have to redo what you did last stream

Heie.hr3888	2061224	I think it's the room with the blue couches?
CrackRacing	2063597	the scariest thing about Poppy Playtime is the lack of checkpoints
Raoku	2076822	lets hope she doesnt have to start over
KBGamer96	2105300	stop being a zoooomer :3
Juan🎃🩹	2120851	we got spoiled by autosave
JerryFreshEsch 🎃🩹	2125973	the brain rot from the other day is getting to you lol
Canonlin	2126981	ok remember theres a power source outside the door you need to find an opening to power the piece on the top
Raoku	2126992	dont worry its just me
Brolylegend99_	2134917	I have max volume I don’t hear anything immy
urinal cheesecake 🎃🩹	2148839	i figured this game would have generous checkpoints
Heie.hr3888	2160826	Yeeee that piece

Juan🎃🩹	2171273	monster hunter put the fear of losing progress by forgeting to save. i recommend:face-blue-smiling:

Thunder Dragon Legends	2259429	I highly doubt it
Heie.hr3888	2259676	So there is another power source far away, grab it, then power up the thing on top
Raoku	2261185	no there isnt

Canonlin	2369156	just follow the path it will naturally take you to where you need to go
Heie.hr3888	2380943	So I think you find a door, go through it, and grab the battery from him
