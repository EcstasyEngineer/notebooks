HeadEmptyNoThoughts	387456	no?
TMPLBLCK	387925	it takes a lot to revive another player this early
Something Original	389583	Having one of you be dead causes a constant sanity drain, so it's pretty bad
Jon Omni	390680	I know there are alters around the map that can revive you
Monokuma	398006	2 non gamers attempting to game this will go well
Mikeylel🎃🩹	406049	No revive needs a special stone thingy
Sai_ Bu11et	409858	getting revived by the door isa setting to be enabled

S0ltinsert	425830	when setting up the world, there is an option to enable permanent revives at the door

ChaosH	1931654	Icey's dead sister
Sai_ Bu11et	1942132	you need boulders with gold streak, you can find that on your map at the top right, but worry about food first
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	1943724	it's icey's dead sister
Hero	1945905	Abigail's flower is Wendy's dead sister that through the use of the flower she can summon
Yubris	1946337	give that flowe to her and she can use it
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	1952494	it's a good item for icey
S0ltinsert	1953603	don't mind the art installment. This worlds God is a little eccentric.
Yubris	1977615	tell her to use it
ChaosH	1977843	that's Abigail
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	1983751	it's icey's sister
Demonzx	1984756	that is icy ead sister
Bean Meister	1985901	Abigail will kill enemies for you
Yubris	1986528	finally, that thing can kill almost anything
Mikeylel🎃🩹	1990207	Yes she can use the flower to summon za ghost
Jon Omni	1996387	We got Abigail boys

Sai_ Bu11et	2049149	you take damage in the dark
Jeez Louis	2056239	starving
Bean Meister	2056537	You're hurting because you're starving LOL

Bean Meister	2087392	Yo it's the shadow creatures
Canonlin	2090127	you prolly should you're about to die
Hero	2092475	It's gonna restart on it's own anyway
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	2095954	icey needs to look for touch stones
Jon Omni	2100203	Have Icey use the flower at the start of the next game for an easier time killing monsters
ScrumptiousNightmare	2108338	Icey could explore the map for a touch stone to revive. But a restart might be good.
ChaosH	2116423	o7

Yubris	2333799	also you can create an army of spiders
Bean Meister	2342444	Webber's powers is that he won't get attacked by spiders and he starts with a spider egg
Raoku	2343863	spiders are hard to kill
Yubris	2366465	and wendy is really like you
Jon Omni	2369284	If she is going willow house should do Wendy
S0ltinsert	2380138	Wilson is extremely straightforward! He's a normie.
Hero	2381790	Wilson is just a basic character, not any upsides except his beard during winter
Sai_ Bu11et	2389943	btw don't break that pile of rocks

Yubris	6250308	celestial champion, or whas it lunar champion
Bahdas_Jahfada 	6258950	wait 21 is deer right I think I mixed up the days
Bahdas_Jahfada 	6277648	basically whenever deer shows up they struggle since they are new
