Hydrus-cymothoida	8117845	Who knows with YouTube sometimes 
GreaseCat🎃🩹	8118078	I’m not sure 
Sylvost Frenchkiss	8118945	just watched an asmr vid of a girl doing ring fit ... you're fine 
Something Original	8119931	Just half-ass the Ring Fit, don't even get out of breath, problem solved
Khift🦑🛐	8120107	Mummeh did just get away with it it's just a question of how much risk you want
Canti 🎃🩹	8120319	just have to be a little careful
TI Crimson	8120920	you should be ok?
Peanutzthepig	8122522	I don't think so if mummeh doesn't get a strike for hers you should be fine :)
GinJaeger	8126254	i have not seen problems with ring fit, but maybe
SSide cima vei	8128440	a lot of people stream ring fit 
Rylon🎃🩹	8131159	Youtube is questionable with the rules. We recently learned rat nibbling is a bannable offense
Nihongohorni Dodemo	8134106	Mummeh also has a Strike and did it without problem Immy
JoxFoxGaming	8138550	They did hit you because your rat was sniffing in a mic
