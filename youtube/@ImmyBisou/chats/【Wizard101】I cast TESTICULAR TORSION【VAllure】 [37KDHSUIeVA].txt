Dabman77	3966038	damn.......
You Will REPENT	3973311	just got in and we are already talking about MLP today is a good day
FargoneMyth	3978382	It's not for everyone, it's for stereotypical girls.
FargoneMyth	3983124	Which is why it sucks.
Denyal	3983728	maybe they changed everything in otder to purge the fanbase they created
Hydrus-cymothoida	3997753	We had that month where like Pony zombie infection TikToks was like the big art trend. That was fun. 
AngelMC7	4008501	we getting spice boys
FargoneMyth	4016059	The reason Gen 4 was good was because of Lauren Faust.

Mikeylel🎃🩹	4176973	Lmao
BasicallyWiz	4182406	bro...
FargoneMyth	4190305	I mean, their wings aren't big enough for their bodies so the ability to fly without magic makes sense.
AngelMC7	4192651	Friendship is MAGIC
shwomplr	4205000	what possessed them to do that...??
You Will REPENT	4205346	ponies aren't bees they must follow the laws of aviation 
Jango Fitso	4214473	I present to you sir: BEES
Billyyyy4	4221132	Birds have magic confirmed 
Denyal	4221473	@FargoneMyth why are you applying logic to this show?
FargoneMyth	4238033	@Denyal Because if we didn't there's no logic to anything.
shwomplr	4244260	them not needing magic was never part of the established lore i think
GamingKitsune99🦑🛐 	4260467	i didnt know My Little Pony had a so much story and lore to it
•JustLlenn•	4263471	@denyal Because yes
CrackRacing	4266768	Immy has become the Nostalgia Critic of MLP
FargoneMyth	4267710	Because fuck you, our OC
Hydrus-cymothoida	4273800	It’s kinda crazy how in gen4 everything in nature kinda needed ponies to interfere. Like leaves don’t fall seasons don’t change and weather doesn’t happen. 
Jango Fitso	4276771	MLP casually making new princeses
shwomplr	4278485	them as in the pegasi
Zoybe	4279925	Woof
You Will REPENT	4281414	damn pony racism and social hierarchy 
VTArchiver	4288416	The pegius had weather based magic but that nothing really beyond that
Hydrus-cymothoida	4288949	There all like nature spirits or something 
Denyal	4289223	isn't that like anime powers when at the end the main character was a god all along?
FireHill20	4305515	pony lore looks deep
AngelMC7	4309296	there is a reason mlp has a big fanbase
FargoneMyth	4322262	It's how they were able to stand on clouds.
Hydrus-cymothoida	4328435	It is cool it’s just kinda crazy to think about 
FargoneMyth	4337151	Who is she?
Bean Meister	4344405	who that?
Alex Jacobo	4351083	same
Denyal	4362501	if the old one was so popular why did they change generations? dorry i don't know about my little pony

GreaseCat🎃🩹	4460053	Not even the princesses?
AngelMC7	4462362	thats it, MLP Whatchalong
Denyal	4463374	Immy should take over the show and make her own generation
Jango Fitso	4479557	ok, that's insane that they don't even show the princesses
shwomplr	4480821	spike my goat
FargoneMyth	4481771	Who the fuck moves the sun and moon in Gen 5 then, if it's same-universe?

Justin Spencer	4618450	hydreigon
AngelMC7	4624516	same body type? sounds lazy AF
Denyal	4627040	sounds like artist/animator laziness
Ethernity 🎃🩹	4633857	that sounds like a huge change between season 4 and 5, did they change directors or something?
FargoneMyth	4636219	That's what happens when talentless fucks take over a show's design.
Jango Fitso	4639189	*when u copy paste a design to cut costs*
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	4640399	Hey hey @Raykuma:test_tube::dagger:

FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	4738171	Oh no, Courtney Unicornflame needs help. lol
shwomplr	4741123	ive only watched friendship is magic but gen five feels actually slanderous to mlp the way its being described
Hydrus-cymothoida	4756016	Part of it might be because the gen4 team just didn’t wanna make more but hasbro wants to make more money 
Denyal	4759513	Jose lui Uchiha??

AngelMC7	4868883	a lot of people do that, for exaple we have the HALO show, and the creators admited they didn't research much of the games
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	4884073	Is it as bad as I've heard? @Geoff 
Mufasa	4889028	it's the anniversary
CSeye	4891677	the game, it's been out for 16 years

urinal cheesecake 🎃🩹	4898357	:_Headpat:
Hydrus-cymothoida	4903887	Nothing turns me off more then YouTuber with no history of voice acting is voice acting in a show it almost never leads to a good performance. 
Raoku	4907055	Cute Yawn
Mufasa	4914057	john wizard101's birthday
JoxFoxGaming	4918300	does the brony fandom still do stuff? has it died since gen 5?
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	4918512	I mean, you wrote some fire fanfiction.
Flaming Bearded Dragon	4928707	there was a showrunner out there that was talking about how knowing the lore of Star Wars was disqualifier for working with Lucas Film
FingersJones	4938253	Congratulations Wizard101! You're old enough to get railed in England
Denyal	4942133	youtubers acting in games is horrible too...
Jango Fitso	4944596	what's with the geenie guy?
xZylon Gaming	4949107	Bro Wizard 101 does that still exist xD

This Toxic Guy	5059074	And him voicing Kiryu
Omnicrab	5059074	hes been doing VA work for a while, hes great
Hydrus-cymothoida	5063027	He has a history of voice acting though so he gets a pass 
Mikeylel🎃🩹	5067355	Hes an actual VA though
Denyal	5069728	even if it is a shitty gen?
Geoff	5069945	....Broadway stage actor Ned Luke never did any video game voce acting or motion acting before he played Michael in GTA 5
Mikeylel🎃🩹	5071270	So makes sense
Boi	5072770	:_Note: working on it
EchoSoundz03	5073862	proZD is a good VA just a bad person

Mikeylel🎃🩹	5114665	Agree
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	5119272	Still need to watch that stream.
EchoSoundz03	5120453	u could FR
Duncafunk	5122202	I mean from what I saw her character really doesn't fit a kids show, booze fridge and talking about loosing her virginity in the first video I clicked on.
GreaseCat🎃🩹	5124470	I thought it was cute
AngelMC7	5126657	you COULD 100%
GamingKitsune99🦑🛐 	5129294	i would say My Little Pony is small the producers are only think of the kids that are going to watch it
This Toxic Guy	5132517	Will you be one of the smaller fillies?
Denyal	5137609	I feel like Immy acting in mlp would cause another gooning generation
Ethernity 🎃🩹	5138822	Immy would brag about it and get one guyed like she did in Roblox. MLP what? Is that what the hags watch now?
Lexryt 🦑🐰	5140575	Idea for a stream: Immy acts the entire script for the first ep of Friendship is magic.:_Headpat:
Geoff	5143999	Gotta start somewhere, and Youtube shitposts are as good of a starting point as any
Canti 🎃🩹	5149100	any MLP producers in chat? it's your time to shine

EchoSoundz03	5189763	screw the numbers, we love ur passion projects
Hydrus-cymothoida	5202411	Kira Buckland technically started out small online as well. And now she’s a pretty big voice actor 
GreaseCat🎃🩹	5212736	If you have fun with it well enjoy it
Geoff	5222445	There's also the issue of the rights holders to a children's cartoon officially sanctioning a voice actress who streams on Brosly
Jango Fitso	5235454	the arrow always points to the same place, you just change your camera view which also changes where the arrow "looks" to be going
SeraF	5238500	She NEEDS her numbers!
FargoneMyth	5242496	Fair.

IamFUBAR🎃🩹	5285350	But Immy you're already at 50k you don't have to worry about the numbers for a little bit

FargoneMyth	5302492	I can't look at Suzie and not think she has cum for lipstick.
Jango Fitso	5314572	are they even creating new wisards 101 story for people to voice act in?
This Toxic Guy	5318967	Faaair
Canti 🎃🩹	5322193	my love for you grows proportionally with your numbers
This Toxic Guy	5323539	Thats sound logic
Ethernity 🎃🩹	5335787	sooo, have you planned what you are going to do when you hit 1 mil subscribers?
SeraF	5344293	I respect that a lot. It's a business and you do what you have to do to keep growing.
Juan🎃🩹	5345437	that would be depressing
EchoSoundz03	5346715	true since ur corporate 
Skyace13	5348879	Wait you aren’t dicking around?
AngelMC7	5356269	donathon goal should have a MLP SONG COVER included
HeadEmptyNoThoughts	5356858	isn't wizard 101 still updating? they should be no?
This Toxic Guy	5362509	I bet
FargoneMyth	5364656	If anything their standards are too low for you.
Dawid Blazkowicz	5365577	lmao KingsIsle your move
Hydrus-cymothoida	5366512	I don’t think a current voice reel of what you’ve recorded in the past should be sent to a kid’s product
Raoku	5367894	immy you would not get in cause your too good
Mikeylel🎃🩹	5370615	Damn shade
Contemplative	5372639	Yeah the voice acting even in the new worlds isn't too good, but it's def better than the first world lol
cinctulus	5376352	probably since it just came out on consoles
Duncafunk	5377755	shoot your shot!
This Toxic Guy	5382985	I am sure you can, they got no reason not to.
Jon Omni	5383518	it is still updating i think
Jango Fitso	5386981	bro idk, I know they technically finished pirates 101
Hydrus-cymothoida	5391016	Maybe might need to make a new demo reel
This Toxic Guy	5395101	Not unless they look into your online profile.
