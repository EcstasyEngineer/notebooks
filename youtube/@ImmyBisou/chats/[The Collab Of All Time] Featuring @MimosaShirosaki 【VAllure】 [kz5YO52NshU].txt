Shadowstriker0S	5820457	Sounds like religious stuff...
Aqua Liusaidh Reborn	5821817	I know that feel, Mimosa...
The Mighty Wobb	5822082	the kind of parents who thought video games were evil
Aqua Liusaidh Reborn	5830744	Satanic Panic.
Mikeylel🎃🩹	5832565	Mimosa thats not religion thats just being stupid
Bekir Kakasson	5835631	why do all christian parents dislike specifically Harry Potter lol

Xagluz	5875856	they dont like magic/sorcery
Nihongohorni Dodemo	5878258	Yeah cause of the witchcraft and such
CrackRacing	5879823	yeah mages=withccraft
Shadowstriker0S	5880169	Its taboo
Doctor P	5880445	yeah they don’t like magic and pokemon
Aqua Liusaidh Reborn	5883165	HWITCHES!
Arinok	5883683	Yep, witchcraft is exactly it.
Alexis	5893076	The same with Doom
xXDMOGXx	5893596	Well I mean, it IS witchcraft lol
pen kai	5894070	it's literally wizards and witches that's like base level Christian scaring content
Budukai	5894727	wow, that is old
Slavic Soul	5897504	aint no way
Nihongohorni Dodemo	5901235	Dnd had the same thing back in the day
Fiendish💔	5903183	istg its the preachers. whenever something popular comes out harry potter, pokemon go, they say satanism and the church members just believe it immediately
CrackRacing	5905051	they thought Dungeons and dragons was satanic so anything magical is scary to them
Doctor P	5905891	from the 1970s
stardustSilhouette	5908860	that's not a universal christian thing, that's just an american fundamentalist thing
Arinok	5915512	Lots of people went to Jail over the Satanic Panic
Shadowstriker0S	5916813	It was a big deal back then
cinctulus	5922193	yes
L. Cross	5922362	Some American bullcrap
Shoestain	5930917	Not knowing what the satanic panic was is very zoomer
Aqua Liusaidh Reborn	5932617	Harry Potter I get. It's Pokemon that makes no sense of religious parents hating it at the time.
Insomniackid7 💔🐥	5934525	music, video games, they called everything satanic and corrupting the children
Rawke	5936485	I only know of it because they went after DOOM later on as well
ExoticTomato	5937097	DND inspired a full on panic yeah
theDeathBerry🎃🩹	5947358	they though DnD was satanic
S0ltinsert	5949518	Dungeons & Dragons is Satanism
pen kai	5951387	they were scared of the content, music, and activities. some church burning in Europe didn't help thp
Doctor P	5955747	yeah it was an excuse to blame bad things on something else
ExoticTomato	5957289	Kids were playing DND and the churches got scared 
Fiendish💔	5960397	my country doesnt have this issue either. its just the americans lmao
Aqua Liusaidh Reborn	5962661	Playing up to their own agenda. Not too far from today.
Shadowstriker0S	5969377	D&D was under some fire back then for that
Arinok	5971246	Look, we never said people were smart
Xagluz	5975363	demons made up
Doctor P	5977849	nerd stuff was satan
Mikeylel🎃🩹	5977891	Damn Do not Disturb is satanic 
S0ltinsert	5978206	Because D&D allows you to be a wizard and cleric, and the world is pagan, and there is demon
Alexis	5981055	Roleplaying as a evil bean
ExoticTomato	5982960	Caused a massive panic. Like every time there was a murder it was like…. Was this the work of satanists 
The Mighty Wobb	5983902	they thought Pokemon was satanic too
Panda	5986511	demons and witchcraft = satanic to some people
Shadowstriker0S	5990405	there are demons and "Evil" stuff
ExoticTomato	5995739	Yeah but roleplay was taboo at the time 
Lightfellow	5997410	its like when they were trying to blame games GTA for any young adults being violent
CrackRacing	5999264	roleplaying was like being possessed by a demon for them
Canti 🎃🩹	6005481	my mom had a schizo christian phase and banned everything like that
Rawke	6007422	There are some really goofy movies and stuff they made that are anti-DND from the time. Hilarious in hindsight

Shadowstriker0S	6388088	NGL, sounds like something a person who don't experience the "Monthly" event would come up with.
