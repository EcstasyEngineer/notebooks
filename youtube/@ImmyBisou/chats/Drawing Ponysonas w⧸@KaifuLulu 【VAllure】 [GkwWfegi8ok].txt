Something Original	2544007	Immy, do you have any thoughts about how they made Derpy Hooves a "real" character? I remember it being a bit controversial at the time
cinctulus	2547234	too good for weird al lmao
FargoneMyth	2549182	Immy's down bad.
Makuto66	2549912	But Cheese Pie is awesome!!!! XD
Greedy_Seagull	2556970	it should've been me not him 
Thickishdread	2589118	Party ponies gotta stick together, and boneless 2 was a super plus to the marriage.
dabomb	2604720	I liked the music in the show. Daniel Ingram was great 
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2728360	Yeah I dont see any issue with derpy
FargoneMyth	2736049	People will be offended by anything.
Makuto66	2738073	My eyes are literally like Derpy's. I actually like her!!!!
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2742002	But I know some parents were offended yeah
FargoneMyth	2750887	I mean Derpy was her fan name.
Thickishdread	2759575	They changed it to Muffins.
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2759582	Derpy doesnt necessarily mean anything offensive
Rain Man	2767427	Fuck I remember that, people got offended because they tried to say derpy was making fun of autistic people
SilentTanuki	2788056	I thought it was her voice that caused controversy?
Juan🎃🩹	2796821	who is derpy?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2799429	Pegasi
EchoSoundz03	2810064	faster then rainbow??
Something Original	2813240	I love that an animation error can lead to a whole new canon character being created
FargoneMyth	2814427	She went plaid.
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	2815347	Derpy?
Greedy_Seagull	2820123	so she aged or something?
Makuto66	2822906	Lazy eyed
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2829544	She did
FargoneMyth	2833957	She did in the one episode
Rain Man	2844685	She talked once, but it had to be changed because "it made fun of the mentally disabled"
Makuto66	2849069	She did talk.
Thickishdread	2854782	The actor giving the voices mistook that Derpy was a male and since the cross eyes and sounded kinda mentally challenged a lot of parents got affended.
Something Original	2860952	She talked in one episode and they originally gave her a kinda stereotypically "handicapped' voice due to a miscommunication with the VA. They changed it later
AlitaIsAWolf	2861521	she talked a few times
EchoSoundz03	2864251	i dont remeber her talking but i did stop watching at somepoint 
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2865671	Ehhhhhhh she just sounded a bit derpy LOL
Makuto66	2868615	That shouldn't be an issue.
AlitaIsAWolf	2888502	im autistic and I think she's cute
cinctulus	2909086	:_Note:
Canonlin	2919560	im learning so much mlp lore :_Note:
Makuto66	2920056	Those parents are overly sensitive. I liked it.
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2920487	@AlitaIsAWolf same
pen kai	2925434	it's the deaf lisp kind of sound
Thickishdread	2928597	“Sorry rainbow dash”
Sayakai	2931933	Also didn't the whole OC start on 4chan and hence was rather intentionally offensive?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2932781	Real
the hedgehog is a lie	2960136	i remember a indi comic artist at the time being hella pissed about that
EchoSoundz03	2964714	that voice isnt too bad
Thickishdread	2971977	You gotta listen to the original voice line in like season 1 or 2 I believe.
Something Original	2983265	That's the "fixed" version. The original voice was quite deep
Mikeylel🎃🩹	2986017	I think there is another voiceline
pen kai	2986195	it's certain clips of her that sound questionable
Tiger Festivals	2989771	the original voice, i think they changed it
EchoSoundz03	2994367	yeah, so it dosent sound too offensive 
Mikeylel🎃🩹	3002466	I think thats the edited version
Makuto66	3010230	Characters with mental and physical disabilities existing shouldn't be considered offensive....
the hedgehog is a lie	3037758	nice save
Redclown	3038945	statement of what?
dabomb	3048338	I used to be a gym rat, so I cosplayed Bulk Biceps once 
EchoSoundz03	3048816	no the deeper one is the original, they fixed it by making it higher pitch 
Mikeylel🎃🩹	3050467	I think mostly like neurodivergent ppl dont really take offense with Derpy
dasedwee	3077964	whats the deets on the new ocs?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	3095002	Silence....
the hedgehog is a lie	3100130	i don't think the actual group took offense, i think it was everyone else did tho

dasedwee	4164443	twilight fucked up
Makuto66	4168869	No.
Thickishdread	4169312	No it was twilight messing with a spell
dabomb	4187673	Because she was a bit snobby in the beginning 
dasedwee	4192335	Twilight had tried to do some bullshit spell and whoopsie doopsied fucked her friends cutiemakrs
Theidealheight	4195909	a Böok?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4224410	I think it was fine 
Makuto66	4228701	I didn't really care.

dasedwee	4284596	toys
GreaseCat🎃🩹	4290675	They blew up the treebary…
dabomb	4291274	That tree got gentrified 
Something Original	4293508	It felt to me like they were just trying to sell more new toys, which is lame, but understandable
FargoneMyth	4294201	Because now she's a princess and princesses MUST HAVE CASTLES FOR REASONS
JoKiru	4294522	her tree house was so awesome
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4295226	Marketing!
dasedwee	4299693	the show is used as a giant ad for selling toys
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4301582	Oh absolutely
Makuto66	4302199	Yes
AndyMk3oc	4320070	That huge tacky crystal castle in the middle of a small sleepy town lol.
Something Original	4321785	Like, ultimately the only reason the show existed was to sell toys
Thickishdread	4325775	Yeah Tirek destroyed the library tree, and then the magic of friendship gave her a crystal castle cuz has to needed more money.
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4333850	Cause castles are "cooler"
Thickishdread	4340008	Hasbro’
GreaseCat🎃🩹	4350596	Hasbro hate
Canti 🎃🩹	4368341	I want a MLP watchalong with Kaifu and Immy
dasedwee	4380997	that sounds really bad
FargoneMyth	4381498	And princesses are immortal
dasedwee	4389831	like what would they be princesses of ?
Makuto66	4392173	Castles are cooler. But destroying the library was unnecessary. Just make it into a new location.
Heie.hr3888	4399704	Really? I didn't know that about everyone being a princess, I may have to look that up :0
Thickishdread	4413296	All my MLP knowledge is coming back to me.
Azura	4436687	that indeed looks adorable
Demonzx	4437646	I was under the impression that all the ponies were princesses. i thought that was the point lol
Heie.hr3888	4455576	@Thickishdread Yee its all coming back haha
FargoneMyth	4470049	It's magic, they can do whatever they want.
JoKiru	4471260	I was actually only last week at the galacon (biggest mlp con in europe) it was amazing!
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4476893	PICK UP THE LIBRARY AND MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
dasedwee	4488287	oh yeah there was also that whole thing where they took the roots of the tree house and hung it up like some macarabe corpse 
Something Original	4501450	Applejack as a princess just fundamentally wouldn't work for her character, I feel
FargoneMyth	4501580	*shrug*
LordSkizzik	4504823	can't only unicorns advance to alicorns ?
Thickishdread	4505409	There was only Luna, Celesteia, Cadence, and twilight are princesses.
dasedwee	4508478	the princesses also have that whole concept tied to their magic
Makuto66	4515754	She was an ambassador or something.
Theidealheight	4521418	dont worry about it
dasedwee	4523089	princess of sun, princess of moon, princess of love kinda is eh but has kingdom so pass
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4530207	Definitely
Heie.hr3888	4530425	It's okie Immy, I'm interested in knowning if there were any cancelled stuff for the story or like, scrapped plans, I never thought to look into that
JoKiru	4544942	she took over ther kingfom of celestia and luna eventually
Dinosaurus Rex	4545945	only flurry heart was born as an alicorn
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4555473	They definitely just wanted her to be an alicorn
AlitaIsAWolf	4580784	cadence is the princess of love
dasedwee	4581996	luna blossom parents are mega luna fans
Thickishdread	4590034	Mia Moreau Cadenca is Princess of love.
Makuto66	4594552	Love. Cadence was love but did nothing in the story...
dasedwee	4597899	also princess of love feels more like princess of mindcontroll
FargoneMyth	4601436	Luna Blossom, Princess of Deez
Makuto66	4608455	Lol!!!!
dasedwee	4613138	she is
Bean Meister	4628713	Jaundice Pony
GreaseCat🎃🩹	4644158	She beat back sombra 
FargoneMyth	4645237	Jeff
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	4649005	Pony needs a liver transplant
AndyMk3oc	4657157	King Ham as I call him lol
dasedwee	4658809	the crystal kingdom has a big artifact like atlantis that was hidden away and when it was recovered cadence shot love magic at the crytstal heart
Makuto66	4664578	Spike was the hero of the crystal kingdom as well.
Thickishdread	4684433	No since the crystal kingdom came back Celestia dictated that Cadence be it leader, it just happened that cadence was able to bring the kingdom together.
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4685811	I mean to be honest its also very anime
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4696030	Friendship is also very anime
dasedwee	4701617	to be fair; cadence's whole deal feels like a different show that got boot strapped to the original show
cinctulus	4706366	WHAT
BrattyBigBro🎃🩹	4708439	nice
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4711572	Yes the racism LMAO
JoKiru	4713286	and then she fights a goat demon xD
dasedwee	4719709	I mean, it did tie in for the over all lore

FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	4725739	racism? I'M IN
EchoSoundz03	4730395	based ponies 
Heie.hr3888	4731203	Ah yes, the racism lel
Mufasa	4731655	pony racism???? I'M IN
Thickishdread	4733446	Yep instead of everypony it’s every creature know.
dasedwee	4735228	they wanted to teach kids that racism has habbnened but its better to work past it
Mufasa	4740790	LMAO
Something Original	4752815	I mean, not to be harsh, but Earth ponies are just literally less special than the other ponies
dasedwee	4753732	Like that's their origin story for their country
Azura	4755624	the classic wealthy unicorn looking down the earth ponies, somehow made sense

LordSkizzik	4783646	they had a whole episode about it with winter episode and the everlasting winter
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4792205	Yeah true
dasedwee	4794328	originally the three races did trade and offererd services but it was forced in some cases, however this strife drew in creatures of hate and winter that caused endless winter
Demonzx	4815393	immy can you make a pinpal pony
dasedwee	4815515	it was only by the three races coming together in the fires of friendship that drove the creatures of hate awy and let summer bloom
Thunder Dragon Legends	4820902	Hi immy 
Makuto66	4823813	They based them too much on a stereotype maybe?
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4824989	Immy's ponysona looks so cute!
dasedwee	4836254	Okay, but to be fair for that
Juan🎃🩹	4844134	there is racism in mlp?
dasedwee	4848214	they didn't have like extinction event to force them to work together
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4849388	Yeah season 7
Juan🎃🩹	4850200	:_Buffer::_Buffer:
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4863523	Oh GOd G5
AndyMk3oc	4866036	I think it was more their strong warrior type of culture. They were like muscle heads that act brashly. At that’s how I saw it…
Insomniackid7 💔🐥	4881019	the species-ism and colorism allegory man....got wild 
ReconCrusader	4884412	lmao 
Makuto66	4884948	I stay far away from the other gens!!!!
BAR-1 Studios	4887999	5th season opener featured the most evil.villain, and she wanted everyone to be Equal
FargoneMyth	4893044	Who knows?
dasedwee	4894239	its like they had their culture invaded and shit went to shit
Juan🎃🩹	4895791	racism made a comeback?
Something Original	4906602	I mean, that's kind of realistic though. You can't just "solve" racism
Juan🎃🩹	4907591	wtf is even happening?:face-blue-smiling::face-blue-smiling:
Canti 🎃🩹	4908159	it's a government psyop
Heie.hr3888	4908225	I have only seen gen 4 mlp, I wonder how the other ones are? :0
dasedwee	4918898	and all the ponies were looking for reason why things went to shit
Monokuma	4920242	writers have no new ideas
FargoneMyth	4945100	Pussification
Canonlin	4952275	mlp lore goes so deep
dasedwee	4952646	might be that Twilight sealed magic away
Mikeylel🎃🩹	4954614	Yeah I dont think about G5 lol
dasedwee	4954741	no magic

Monokuma	5002278	they have no new ideas for any show they just have reruns
Mikeylel🎃🩹	5006174	Absolutely
AndyMk3oc	5006875	Yeah, I dropped it after that
Something Original	5008184	Why spend money on a well-written season when you can just shit out something for cheap and have it sell just as many toys?
Makuto66	5009484	Glowing dragons being called by the dragon lord was pretty interesting!!!!
pen kai	5033858	making a new show is more of a gamble than sloppifying an existing property
BAR-1 Studios	5040722	the Brony phenomenon was a product of it's time mainly driven by comparatively wretched adult TV at the same time
JoKiru	5051764	g5 concept is good it was just badly written, old fans stayed for the characters and the potential mostly
Makuto66	5052740	Chad Spike!!!!! XD
Thickishdread	5053658	My boy spike getting big and brick like.

Dinosaurus Rex	5096011	Hasbro lost the rights to half the show so they couldn't use spike's new design
Mikeylel🎃🩹	5101513	Could be
Makuto66	5101980	I liked Spike!!!!
dasedwee	5108422	the other dragonlord lady who was gonan be the big lady of the dragons
Something Original	5118269	Any time they change a design it's because they want to sell new toys
Makuto66	5141922	Gem eating dragons...make me think of Ruby Basarios from Monster Hunter!!!!!
dasedwee	5152683	okay chat; you have a brief window to sling your character concept as a pony go

Thickishdread	5362963	Yeah it was like a jumpscare back then.
dasedwee	5367571	@Mikeylel:jack_o_lantern::adhesive_bandage: alternatively just go ham on cenpt, I did that one by mashing Applejack and Twilight colors together and refined it a bit more
dasedwee	5382404	additionally just take a hippie sounding name and run with it
