Brolylegend99_	5299492	The changes to the buttons make sense and make it look cute
Shoestain	5300506	Buttons make them kind of jack-o-lantern-y as eyes
FOCUSxFIRE🎃🩹	5306798	Something about them...

CrackRacing	5344565	15K celebration with update outfit?
TechNinja_420	5347795	but the rat skull is blending a bit into your body since there is no contrast, maybe the gems should stay, no ?
James Moore	5352131	I thought the buttons were for back up eyes when a pinpal breaks one.

Heie.hr3888	5512690	I feel like the reason the big buttons work now is because there isn't any leaves there too, but with the leaves, that changes things and it can feel too cluttered altogether
