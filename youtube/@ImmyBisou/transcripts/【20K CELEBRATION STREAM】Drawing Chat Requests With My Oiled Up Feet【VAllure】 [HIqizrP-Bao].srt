1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,320
Well, thank you all for watching.

2
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
You

3
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:44,080
your

4
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
You

5
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:34,080
You

6
00:06:44,080 --> 00:07:14,040
Oh, thank you. I didn't I didn't see anything. I don't even have

7
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:26,840
chat open. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm almost 30 minutes late. I'm sorry. I can't even

8
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't have the I don't have the stream moments tab open. Hold on. I like I woke up and as

9
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,160
soon as I saw people were waiting for me, I was like, Oh, shit. Fuck. I need to start

10
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,200
the stream. I wasn't even sure if I was going to stream today. Um, thank you for the 20

11
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:06,920
gifted. Okay, there. Thank you for the 20 gifted. Let me make sure I'm on the right

12
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:19,360
microphone setting. I'm super unorganized right now. I'm so sorry. Okay, I am. Thank you so

13
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:27,400
much for the 20 gifted. That's so nice of you. Let me open chat. I'm like really sweaty

14
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,680
because I got ready for the stream super fast because I had to. I had to set it up, you

15
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,920
know, because it's a foot cam today. Um, oh my God, why are there so many people watching?

16
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:45,440
This is not going to be that extravagant of a stream. Thank you for being here though.

17
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:53,000
Scuff stream. Let's go. It's gonna be good one. I don't know about. Oh my God. It could have

18
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,960
taken a day off if you needed. I wasn't sure I was I was being really, um, what's the word

19
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,360
when you can't make a decision indecisive. I was being really indecisive and so I took

20
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,240
a nap and then I woke up at two minutes after the stream was supposed to start and I checked

21
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,000
the stream and I see that I think maybe strong or someone rated me and I was like, shit, shit.

22
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,800
I feel bad for canceling now. But thank you for the $20. Congrats on 20k at this rate.

23
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,000
You'll be at 30k before you know it. I am at 30k. Are you gaslighting me right now? Am I

24
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,960
not at 30k? I am at 30k. Thank you though. Probably cuz feet, cutest feet on YouTube.

25
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,080
I did make my feet pretty. Um, I hope you'll be able to see it. The nail polish kind of

26
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:59,680
looks great but it's supposed to be purple. I don't know. I hope you'll like it. My phone

27
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,880
might die and so I might lose tracking. I realize I don't even have my ring light on.

28
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Let me turn that on. Hold on.

29
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,960
There we go.

30
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Okay, before you know it. Okay, I put the sound alerts back on.

31
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
One.

32
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm drinking gamer stuff. It sounds so weird to say but I feel like I should say it cuz I

33
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,960
actually enjoy, I really enjoy lean. Lean is my favorite flavor out of all the other flavors.

34
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,960
50k soon? I don't know maybe. It would be nice. It would be nice. I don't know when.

35
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I feel like I might slow down because I have so many things that I didn't finish. I didn't

36
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,960
finish the 10, I didn't even finish the 10k ducky art.

37
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Why are you guys freaking out that I like lean? Is lean a drug? I don't even know.

38
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:27,960
How are you feeling Amy? Like shit. Like shit.

39
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Okay, let me back away from the drawing pad here. Hopefully my camera is working.

40
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,960
We're about to find out. Oh it is working. Let me move out of the way.

41
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Okay, I'm kind of far from the mic now.

42
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Hi, there they are. It does look gray. I'm sorry. It looks gray.

43
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:15,960
So I'm wearing like mom yoga pants. I found them at Goodwill and they were really cheap

44
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,960
and I need yoga pants. So I'm wearing like the really mom looking yoga pants.

45
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I painted my nails they're supposed to be purple and sparkly but they look gray.

46
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,960
And also I have like really old nail polish from when my aunt did my nails but they were

47
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,960
supposed to be purple. What the fuck? Alright, well they're gray.

48
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:44,960
But they are sparkly at least. So that's nice. And there's my feet.

49
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I'll give you a close up because I know you like them. I have some scabs on them.

50
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Because it's summer and I get a lot of bugs in my room.

51
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Don't worry, brothers and y'all, I'm just using my powers.

52
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Thank you for the five dollars. What do you mean using your powers?

53
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Because it's summer and I get a lot of bugs in my room and they bite me.

54
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I got some scars from the bug bites, especially on this one.

55
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Double audio? Wait, did someone do it? Double audio? Uh oh.

56
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Is that better? What the fuck? Was my camera capturing my audio?

57
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Oh, I'm so sorry. Double audio. Thank you for letting me know. There we go. Is this better?

58
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,960
It's better. Okay, it's fixed. Okay, okay. Sorry for the double audio.

59
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I had no clue that this camera captured audio too. Was it good audio at least or was it bad?

60
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,960
It was probably bad. Okay.

61
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I gotta stop turning off my phone. I need this phone for chat.

62
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,960
It was yummy audio? I don't think it was. I don't think it was.

63
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:29,960
I gotta take a moment to rest because as soon as I got up, I started running around everywhere to get this stream up.

64
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Chat is fixed though. OBS fixed chat.

65
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
It wasn't bad, sounded echoey. Okay, that's good.

66
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Okay, well good to know that my, um, I don't like how you can see my, I don't like how you can see my, um, my shadow there.

67
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Okay, let me come in a little more. Let me back you up.

68
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm using, someone bought me pink puppy pads or not a puppy pad. These are, um, P pads. Someone bought me pink P pads and, um, now I'm using them for the background of the stream.

69
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,960
I'm, okay, hold on. Let me adjust the camera. I'm going to turn it off though.

70
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,960
One moment. I feel like I gotta bring it closer to the pewter.

71
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,960
And that's why I turned off the camera, because it just fell over. That would have been bad.

72
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Oh, over.

73
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Ah, no, not my mom yoga pants. You saw them. Oh, they're so ugly.

74
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
I'm so embarrassed of them.

75
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
There we go.

76
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
That's better.

77
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Okay.

78
00:16:51,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Good enough for me. I don't care. Right.

79
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Is the background music good? Is it quiet enough? Loud enough? Let me check chat.

80
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Wife.

81
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
No.

82
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Okay.

83
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
If you're embarrassed, take them off. No.

84
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
No.

85
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I will keep my mom yoga pants on. I don't like it. I don't like showing the shape of my legs.

86
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Okay.

87
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Um, so, basically today, we're going to, um, oil up my feet. And by oil up, I mean, lube up, because I don't have oil.

88
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Because I don't have oil, so I'm just using the lube from a member stream. I hope that's okay.

89
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:22,960
And I have a bunch of, um, I have a bunch of Crayola markers in here, and that's what I'm going to use to draw.

90
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:41,960
And I'm just going to try, that's why I have this puppy pad out is so that, um, if I like spill the juices around me, then, um, they won't go on the floor. They'll go on the pup pad.

91
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,960
I call it a puppy pad, but really it's for like geriatric patients when they piss and shit themselves.

92
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Okay, let's lube up my feet now.

93
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah, I'm so smart.

94
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Yeah, it's going to be messy, but, um, you have a pack maxing.

95
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,960
That's such a funny way to put it. I'm going to use, uh, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, because I remember that tastes good.

96
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I don't know if I should have my rats out for this. Should I?

97
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
I'll open the cage.

98
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,960
If they want to come out, they can. If they don't, they won't.

99
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
I don't know.

100
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Rats get you banned? Is it pet safe? I mean, it's human safe, so I assume it's pet safe. Rats can eat basically, oh, I don't even have napkins.

101
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Uhhh.

102
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Okay, I'll go get napkins. I wasn't prepared for this. I'll go get napkins. I'll be right back.

103
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:23,960
I'm back. I was talking to myself because my mic was muted.

104
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Silhouette reveal? No fucking way. It's rough. Don't look at it. Don't look. Keep your eyes closed.

105
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Okay, um, should we start? Okay, I gotta lube up the feet first, okay.

106
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Let me get you a good, uh, I mean, moisturize them. Oil them. Oh yeah, there we go.

107
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Oh my. This is allowed on YouTube, right?

108
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Is this allowed? It looks kind of...

109
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Oh my god, they're so shiny! Oh my god!

110
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Oh my god! I gotta hold them up like this. Oh wow. Oh, I'm falling over. Okay, there. Oh wow. Look at that. They're so shiny.

111
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Should I add some more? I feel like they could be shinier. Ew, that's so gross. That's gross. Let's make them shinier. Hold on, let me show you.

112
00:21:42,960 --> 00:22:10,960
I'll rub it around. Make this one shinier too. There you go. That's so gross. Okay, so now my feet are sufficiently, um, wet.

113
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,960
It's gonna get all over the canvas, for sure. It's already all over the canvas. How am I gonna draw like this? Should I choose a different...

114
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Maybe I should choose a different page because this one already has oil all over it.

115
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Entirely not suggestive. No, they're just shiny. I just greased them up. They're almost reflective. I just greased them up a little bit. Nice, right?

116
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Okay. Now, I'll take a couple suggestions from chat about what to draw.

117
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,960
If the canvas was on an ankle? Ew, there's hair on the canvas. It's not really canvas, it's just a sketch pad.

118
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:36,960
A pinpal? Okay. I'll do a pinpal first, then. If that's what you suggest, I mean, um, you can see my shadow so much.

119
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Oh my. How lewd. Let me try drawing on this side of the canvas because it's not as wet. Alright. I should have been drunk for this. It would have been more entertaining.

120
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Let me get the green out and the black out and the orange? Orange.

121
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Is that all the colors I need? I think that's all the colors. I'm drawing this from memory so I don't... No, I think I need red, too.

122
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Red. I'm drawing it from memory so I don't remember much. I'll try to keep chat with me.

123
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Drunk and slippery? Peak entertainment.

124
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Let's start with the orange. Ew, there's a hair. Oh my god. My room is filled with hairs because it's my room and I'm disgusting and so I don't vacuum that often.

125
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Oh, it's really slippery. Oh, it's really, really slippery. Okay. Okay, let's start with the head. Oh, shit.

126
00:24:50,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Oh, I'm gonna get so many cramps right now. I can feel one coming on. Oh, it's not that bad. It's cute.

127
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:17,960
And then you got like ear holes. Okay, that ear hole is kind of bad. Another ear hole. Alright, alright. I think that's all the orange because you're a pumpkin. Or should I draw the pumpkin lines?

128
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Anyways, how was your day? Mine was meh.

129
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,960
How was your day? Mine was just meh. I woke up. I made a coffee.

130
00:25:38,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I got some nice chairs on my, recently I got some nice chairs on my porch because I went on vacation to the beach and at the Airbnb they had chairs on their porch and I was like, wow, it's just so nice to sit here in the morning. Is this gray?

131
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,960
It's black. Why is it so gray? What was I saying?

132
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:30,960
They had like chairs on their porch and I was like, wow, so nice to sit here in the morning and like chill on the porch and I was like, I need to get myself some chairs on my porch and that's what I did and it's really nice actually.

133
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I definitely recommend putting chairs on your porch if it's big enough. And it's actually not too expensive either. I thought it was going to be like $500 to get some chairs and a table but it really wasn't that bad.

134
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,960
I feel like I should get the camera closer. You guys are kind of far, right?

135
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Thank you for becoming a member of Moni. Make that 34K big bro. I'm so proud of you. Thank you.

136
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:13,960
I don't have small grippers actually. They're very normal sized. They're very average sized. Let me get you closer. Hold on.

137
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:38,960
There we go. That's better.

138
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Now you can see it closer.

139
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Is it even better? Did it change? Did anything change right now?

140
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Oh yeah, green. Green fell on the floor. How convenient. What else did I do? I woke up, had my coffee. I recorded an audio for next. I can't pick it up.

141
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:18,960
There we go. I did it. I recorded an audio for next month. It won't open now because it's so greased up.

142
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Come on. Okay, I got it open. I recorded an audio for next month. What else did I do? I cried.

143
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:42,960
And then I went to sleep after because I was tired. And then I woke up and now I'm here drawing with my toes.

144
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
I feel like we need a darker green. That's not dark enough.

145
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:57,960
If you keep hearing fart sounds, it's my cheer. I don't fart that often. I don't fart nearly as much as I burp.

146
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Okay, let me make it darker green.

147
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:22,960
There we go. Completely followed the original outline for sure.

148
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Sudden Barrage of Kisses. Congrats on 20k and Way Beyond. You're doing great. I love you, little sis. Thank you.

149
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:43,960
You guys are really, thank you. I'm really sorry for having to cancel stream yesterday. I don't like to cancel. I feel bad canceling.

150
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Thank you for understanding. Why does it look nice, doesn't it? It's because I'm really good at drawing.

151
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,960
So it transitions to every single part. Ew, my feet look so disgusting because it picks up all the dirt.

152
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,960
I'm really good at drawing, so it spreads to the rest of my body too.

153
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Every part, every single part of my body is good at drawing. Can you tell? Can you tell?

154
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,960
And then, I think I have to do the rest of the body with black, right? You're like, mostly black.

155
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,960
The penpal is melting? No, he's not. He just took an edible.

156
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Your armpits? Even your armpits? Sure. Yeah, maybe one day.

157
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,960
I don't know if I'll do a drawing with my armpit stream. That would be really difficult. That would be really, really...

158
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Get this fuck-ass hair out of here. That would be really difficult to draw with my armpit.

159
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,960
And it'd be even more difficult to show it without just fucking base-camming it up.

160
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Oh, shit. There we go.

161
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Cut.

162
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,960
And then you got a little tail.

163
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Cut.

164
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Now I have to remember how the rest looks.

165
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,960
He's rotten? No, he's not rotten. He's not rotten.

166
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Don't insult him like that. He's very ripe and ready to be bred.

167
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,960
He's very ripe. Don't call him rotten.

168
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Or a bit fatter than I remember. No! I think the chubby-ness is cute. I like the roundness.

169
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Cats are cute when they're chubby.

170
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Looks like he has the shakes. What's shakes? What do you mean the shakes?

171
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,960
He's not shaken. He's completely normal.

172
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,960
I'm trying to pick up this orange.

173
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Should I take a break in between drawing to oil up the feet even more?

174
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,960
My feet are covered in hair now!

175
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
And now I have to figure out how to open this marker when it's all greased up.

176
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Fun fact, I'm ambidextrous with my feet. Yep. I'm just as good.

177
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,960
I'm just as good at drawing with my left feet than I am with my right feet.

178
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Okay, I genuinely don't remember. I know you have stitches on your feet, right?

179
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,960
And these ones are white. Your hands are white.

180
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Chat talking some mad shit for people without any feet?

181
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Exactly! Exactly!

182
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,960
This is what you look like, you know, I'm drawing you. You're insulting yourself by talking shit like that.

183
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,960
And then you have like some orange bits somewhere.

184
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,960
I think your tail is orange too, actually.

185
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Ignore all the disgusting hair on the canvas.

186
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,960
You have left feet and right feet? Do you not?

187
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,960
This is my left one and this is my right one.

188
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Do you not have left feet and right feet?

189
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Do you only have left feet?

190
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
You only have one foot?

191
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,960
That's true, the average amount of feet in people is less than two.

192
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
And the average amount of hands too!

193
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Or maybe it could be...

194
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,960
No, it's probably less than two. There's probably more people without a hand or a foot than there are people with an extra one, right?

195
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Oh fuck, my markers keep falling!

196
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Pop on one foot like the Pixar lamp? Why? Why would I do that?

197
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Why would I do that?

198
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Grease check? Still amply greased?

199
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,960
And you have... I think it's like on the paw?

200
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
The stitches are on the paw? Maybe?

201
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Maybe?

202
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Okay, I tried. I tried. And then you have a heart! You have a broken heart on your chest, right?

203
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,960
The average amount of brains in a person is more than one and that's kind of weird.

204
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Are you talking about like conjoined twins or something?

205
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Why is the average amount of brains on a person more than one? Do some people have two brains?

206
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I know I have less than one probably.

207
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
Nails look nice, thank you!

208
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,960
The raw average is actually three, but only because they counted Hans George who was born with over 10,000 hands.

209
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Are you trolling me right now?

210
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Who the fuck is Hans George?

211
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
I'm I, I'm I, what do you mean I'm I?

212
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Am I?

213
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Ambi dextrous footsies? Yeah, did I say something weird or wrong?

214
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Ami? Ami what? Pregnant women?

215
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Is your heart on the... which side is your heart on?

216
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
I think it's on this side.

217
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
Wait, but are we counting pregnant women in the average count of hands, too?

218
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
And feet, because then at that point they would also have...

219
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Then at that point, if we count them in the average amount of hands and the average amount of feet, then it would also be bigger than two.

220
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Like when do... my feet are so shaky.

221
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
When do pregnant women count and when do they not count?

222
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Okay, I tried.

223
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
That's your heart.

224
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
My heart is with you and me?

225
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,960
I don't think pregnant counts. That's what I'm saying. It shouldn't count.

226
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Let me put the pin in you.

227
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Only when it matters to make funny statistics.

228
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Okay, okay.

229
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Okay, so it only counts when you want it to count then, huh?

230
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
Okay.

231
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Also, you know what's really funny? The script I did today...

232
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
The script I did today was...

233
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Paisu-di? Is that how it's pronounced?

234
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Um...

235
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,960
And I just thought it was funny because the stuff I was saying in the script I was like, damn.

236
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
This doesn't apply to real life.

237
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,960
I showed my... my bitties like way before I knew I was gonna do this script.

238
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,960
So I'm like, you like my flat chest?

239
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
You like my...

240
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Oopsies.

241
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,960
I didn't expect to ever do a script like that because there's...

242
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Just imagine, just imagine.

243
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
We'll be a little bit de-lulu together.

244
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Alright, there's a pinpal.

245
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Did I... I... Last time I drew with my feet on stream, I signed every, um...

246
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,960
I signed every drawing at the bottom, so...

247
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
You know, I gotta sign this piece of artwork...

248
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
With my name because...

249
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,960
The people in the future are gonna need to know the name of this wonderful artist.

250
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
There she is.

251
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Amy.

252
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Amy, let me fix that.

253
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
There we go.

254
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Alright, let me rip it off.

255
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Or not rip it off. Let me show you. Let me show you first.

256
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
There it is.

257
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Amy.

258
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
There's the pinpal.

259
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
It looks like shit.

260
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Okay.

261
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Next page.

262
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Next page.

263
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Next page.

264
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
What are you saying?

265
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Artist. It's cute. It is cute. Very cute.

266
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Good.

267
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Looks like a five-year-old male made it. It looks cute.

268
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Why do you have to specify that a five-year-old boy made it?

269
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,960
A five-year-old girl could have done just as much of a shit job as this.

270
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
It's perfect. Thank you. It is perfect.

271
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,960
It is perfect. Fridge-worthy. It's museum-worthy. It's not fridge-worthy.

272
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Fridge-worthy is an insult to my artistry.

273
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,960
This is gonna be worth something. Big money. It's already worth something.

274
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
It's already worth big money.

275
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Every girl can do pysody depending on the position.

276
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm supposed to be completely flat. I don't know what they were thinking.

277
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,960
I think you just rub against my chest.

278
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Draw your rats.

279
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

280
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Mr. Sister Kisser Disco took $6.90. I like Big Ditty.

281
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,960
But I'll play the xylophone with my giggle stick and the ribs on your flat chest.

282
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Oh my god!

283
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,960
You'll play the xylophone with your giggle stick on your flat chest.

284
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
What an image.

285
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,960
What an interesting image to think of.

286
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,960
I was not thinking of it that way.

287
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,960
It's called nicety.

288
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,960
No, because there's nada there.

289
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,960
What's your favorite MLP character? I've already drawn my favorite.

290
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
I don't want to draw her again. I can show you.

291
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
I don't know if I have it here. Hold on.

292
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Here it is.

293
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I drew Minty with my feet.

294
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Look, it's Minty.

295
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,960
My favorite MLP character is Minty.

296
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
This is an old drawing I have of her with my feet.

297
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Isn't she precious? I love Minty.

298
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
I love Minty.

299
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Your uterus crashed. Reboot it.

300
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Hire that man. Hire that man to do what?

301
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Write scripts for us?

302
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,960
I guess he would fit right in, wouldn't he?

303
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Draw Liberty? I've already drawn her, too.

304
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,960
I don't want to be drawn. I've already drawn.

305
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
I'll draw the viewer girls.

306
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Sure, yeah.

307
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
I can do that. I can do that.

308
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
They won't be great.

309
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,960
I think I'll try to draw Stickman viewer girls.

310
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Let me re-lube between sets.

311
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Sets.

312
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Oh no, it's dripping.

313
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Gotta make sure I'm sufficiently moisturized for this.

314
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Alright, there we go.

315
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Refreshed and also have a piece of marker on me.

316
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
But still refreshed.

317
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Refreshed.

318
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Right.

319
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
Take all your screenshots now.

320
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Okay.

321
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Who should we start with?

322
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Let me get it. Let me try to start with Strani.

323
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,960
She's got pink and green hair.

324
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
And her outfit is...

325
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Fuck, what color is her outfit?

326
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,960
I forgot what color Strani's outfit is. Isn't it green?

327
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Okay.

328
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
Green mostly.

329
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Okay, I'll get this...

330
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,960
I'll get this...

331
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,960
Seafoam green color.

332
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
That matches.

333
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,960
And also black. Where's the black?

334
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Here's the black.

335
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Alright, Strani's coming up first.

336
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,960
Hopefully I have enough space on the canvas for this.

337
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
Alright, pull it closer in the middle.

338
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Okay.

339
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Okay.

340
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
I gotta go, like, really...

341
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm not gonna draw myself, I'm just gonna draw the other girls.

342
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
And Strani's got some...

343
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Some medium-sized bazlingas.

344
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
Um...

345
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
And then these are gonna be her legs.

346
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
Can you hear me good?

347
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
The microphone's kind of far from my face.

348
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Maybe I'll turn up the...

349
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
I'll turn the...

350
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
The what's it called?

351
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
The gain up!

352
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Oh, I gotta get this cap.

353
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,960
Hold on.

354
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,960
Hold on, I almost got it.

355
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
Hold on.

356
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Come on.

357
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Come on.

358
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Come on.

359
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,960
Come on.

360
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,960
Just get in between.

361
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Oh my god.

362
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Okay, I got it.

363
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Yay!

364
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Ah, fuck!

365
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
I just draft it again.

366
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,960
I don't want to bend over to get it.

367
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Okay, I got it a second time.

368
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
Can't escape me.

369
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,960
And then she's got green hair with pink tips.

370
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
And it's like...

371
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Big bangs, right?

372
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,960
She's got those big bangs.

373
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
And the...

374
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Shit.

375
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,960
And the pigtails.

376
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
This is rough.

377
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
And the pigtails.

378
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,960
That looks...

379
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
It's already looking like Strani.

380
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
I could basically leave it there

381
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
and you'd probably be able to guess who was Strani.

382
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Here's the pink tips.

383
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,960
It's really hard to get a hold of this marker

384
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,960
because my feet keep slipping down it.

385
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Are her bangs pink too?

386
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
I think her bangs are pink too.

387
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,960
Let me add some pink in her bangs.

388
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,960
And she's got those swirly things on the top of her head.

389
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,960
There they are.

390
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,960
And then I'll draw her dress.

391
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,960
Oh yeah, I watched a lot more May Day today.

392
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
Which is just a show about...

393
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,960
More plane crashes.

394
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
It's just a show about plane crashes.

395
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,960
I watched the one about the pilot that flew out the window.

396
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,960
Basically, he flew out the window because, um...

397
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,960
They replaced the screws.

398
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,960
They replaced the screws in the plane.

399
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
And, um...

400
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,960
I think the plane had the wrong screws in them.

401
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,960
My ancestors watching me watch an oiled feed stream.

402
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,960
Skull.

403
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,960
Thank you.

404
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,960
Thank you for the five dollars.

405
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,960
Your ancestors would be proud.

406
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,960
What do you mean?

407
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,960
They'd be very proud.

408
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
There it is.

409
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
Does she have?

410
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,960
She doesn't have shoes, right?

411
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Does she?

412
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
No.

413
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,960
Does she have anything on her legs?

414
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,960
I feel like I'm going to have to do this.

415
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,960
Does she have anything on her legs?

416
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,960
I feel like she has some sort of something on her legs.

417
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,960
But I don't know what.

418
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
I think she has like...

419
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
Stuff?

420
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Like...

421
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,960
Gills or something?

422
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,960
She got something going on her legs.

423
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
That's the something.

424
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
Hey there, scrawny.

425
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
Leg wraps in pink.

426
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
I don't know how those look though.

427
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
Wow, it's actually recognizable.

428
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,960
I told you it is.

429
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,960
I told you it is.

430
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,960
From the start.

431
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,960
I knew it was going to be recognizable

432
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,960
because my skills never fail.

433
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,960
I've been in this business...

434
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,960
I've been in this business...

435
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,960
30 years.

436
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
And you dared doubt...

437
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,960
my professionalism and my skill.

438
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
I could sue you.

439
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,960
I could sue you.

440
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,960
For a lot of money.

441
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Because I know how this business works.

442
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,960
I could sue you for defamation.

443
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,960
I'm losing clients because of you.

444
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,960
And you're doubt.

445
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,960
And you're spreading of rumors.

446
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,960
That I'm not good at what I do.

447
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,960
I've seen your fake Google reviews.

448
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,960
On my art.

449
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
I've seen them.

450
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,960
I've seen what you've been saying.

451
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,960
Okay, I don't...

452
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,960
Oh shit.

453
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,960
One of my marker tips.

454
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
Oh fuck.

455
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,960
What?

456
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Oh.

457
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
There it is.

458
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,960
What the hell?

459
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,960
Okay.

460
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
Do I not have a brown?

461
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,960
I do have a brown.

462
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,960
I'm going to draw a zero next.

463
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,960
A zero has...

464
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Purple clothes.

465
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960
Yeah.

466
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,960
And green hair.

467
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,960
And...

468
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,960
This is just proof that I don't remember what any of the girls look like.

469
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,960
What is this talking about?

470
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,960
I'm talking about you.

471
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,960
And giving you...

472
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,960
Yeah.

473
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
Giving you a cease and desist.

474
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,960
For your defamation.

475
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,960
For your defamation.

476
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,960
I'm talking about all the haters.

477
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,960
That are plotting against me.

478
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,960
That's what I'm talking about.

479
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,960
I'm going to try drawing with this foot now.

480
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
I feel like I'm low-key kind of better with this foot.

481
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,960
All the haters that are plotting against me.

482
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
I see you.

483
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,960
Oh fuck.

484
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,960
It was like really tall.

485
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Um...

486
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
I'm going to move her head up here.

487
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,960
She's like really big and tall.

488
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
And I'm going to make her boobs.

489
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960
I don't know.

490
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,960
I'll fix it.

491
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,960
I'll cover it.

492
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Somehow.

493
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,960
Are you sure boobs?

494
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Can you tell that they're boobs?

495
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Can you tell that this says Strani?

496
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
It looks more like...

497
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
Forks.

498
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,960
Fox?

499
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
Okay, well it says Strani.

500
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,960
And then she's got really big hips.

501
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,960
Yeah.

502
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

503
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Hot.

504
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,960
Fuck, it keeps slipping.

505
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,960
My feet are hurting because it keeps slipping.

506
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Okay, I just exchanged feet without even trying.

507
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
I didn't mean to do that.

508
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Okay?

509
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,960
What was I talking about?

510
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Damn, she thick.

511
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
I know she thick.

512
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,960
Family of 20 birthing hits.

513
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Soothe the haters?

514
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Oh, fix it in post?

515
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
There is no post.

516
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,960
This is live.

517
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
This is a live recording.

518
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
There is no post.

519
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
There is no post.

520
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
Wait, are you wafflin'?

521
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,960
Oh, what are you wafflin' about?

522
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
I don't know, man.

523
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,960
I don't know what I'm wafflin' about.

524
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
Yeah, I gotta put this on.

525
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,960
Normally I would be paywalling this, you know?

526
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,960
This kind of art.

527
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
This kind of this lude.

528
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,960
This lude kind of art.

529
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Normally I would be paywalling this.

530
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,960
But instead I'm giving it to you.

531
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,960
Fuckin' hell, come on.

532
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,960
Oh shit, I drew on the pad.

533
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,960
Give it to me.

534
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,960
But instead I'm giving it to you.

535
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,960
For free.

536
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,960
For free.

537
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,960
She has like long hair.

538
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Yeah.

539
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Oh yeah.

540
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,960
Oh yeah.

541
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,960
Oh, that's hot.

542
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
Hell yeah.

543
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,960
And then she's got purple clothing

544
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,960
and they're like drapes.

545
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
If you could see my feet

546
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,960
and how disgusting they are right now,

547
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,960
like in high res, you'd be disgusted.

548
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,960
And she's got like her boobas out.

549
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
And like...

550
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,960
She's got like some sort of...

551
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
I know you can see her thighs.

552
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,960
Does she have some sort of body suit?

553
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,960
I don't remember.

554
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Like some sort of body suit.

555
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Sorry, it doesn't cover her Gucci.

556
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,960
It's okay though, it's cuter if the Gucci's out, right?

557
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
And then she's got like the...

558
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
The drapes.

559
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Cause she's like a goddess.

560
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,960
I realize I forgot to draw her arms.

561
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Does she have shoes?

562
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,960
I don't think so.

563
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,960
She does have some sort of thigh highs, I think though.

564
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,960
I gotta make that more loud so you can hear it.

565
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Oh shit, I gave her a shoe.

566
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,960
She's not wearing shoes.

567
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,960
Sorry, ignore that.

568
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
Thank you for becoming a pin pal.

569
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Yeah, easy access.

570
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,960
We wanna see high res disgusting feet.

571
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,960
I don't think the camera is high res enough.

572
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,960
Like you can see the marker.

573
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,960
It looks like caca.

574
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,960
It's the marker.

575
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,960
And some white hair, I don't know where that's from.

576
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,960
Is this string?

577
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,960
I think it's string.

578
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
It looks like poop from a butt.

579
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,960
Is that what you wanna see?

580
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
There you go.

581
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,960
There's...

582
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
Oh, that looks like Azura.

583
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,960
That looks like the word Azura.

584
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,960
And I'm not trying to guess like you into believing that.

585
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Am I drawing with feet cause no hands?

586
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,960
No I have hands.

587
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Is there poop that's not from a butt?

588
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,960
Yeah, there is.

589
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,960
Oh she has horns, I forgot, yeah.

590
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,960
There is poop that's not from a butt.

591
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,960
There's poop from the intestines.

592
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,960
Sorry, there we go, there's her horns.

593
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,960
Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.

594
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
And she has ears too.

595
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,960
Okay, there's her ears.

596
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,960
It's kinda covered in like...

597
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
marker.

598
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,960
There you go.

599
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,960
They're quite soft.

600
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,960
And a little dirty, but...

601
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,960
You guys are so weird.

602
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,960
You're so weird.

603
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,960
And then this one's also covered in marker.

604
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,960
This one I can't turn as much.

605
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Wow.

606
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,960
Oh thank you, feet tickle, Redeem.

607
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,960
You want me to tickle them?

608
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,960
No, I don't think I can really tickle myself.

609
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,960
I need you to tickle me.

610
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,960
I can't tickle myself, it doesn't work.

611
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
I don't get ticklish.

612
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Okay.

613
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Self tickles don't work, yeah.

614
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,960
Soft confirmed.

615
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,960
Go wash your feet, stinky.

616
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,960
I'm drying with my feet, of course they're gonna get dirty.

617
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,960
What's next, let's draw?

618
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,960
Let's draw Mercy next.

619
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,960
So Mercy...

620
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,960
Mercy's kinda like...

621
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,960
purple, right?

622
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,960
I don't have many shades of purple.

623
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,960
Dennis came out of the cage, but I don't know if you'll see her.

624
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,960
Does she have pink on her?

625
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,960
We're trying to think what Mercy looks like.

626
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,960
I'm drawing them from memory.

627
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,960
I can't cheat.

628
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
She's a little purple.

629
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,960
Purple?

630
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,960
Rats are ticklish if you tickle them they laugh, but it's so high pitched you can't hear it.

631
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,960
I know, I'm actually certified.

632
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,960
I have a certificate from an official university in rat tickling.

633
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,960
I'm a certified rat tickler.

634
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,960
Not to toot my own horn, but um...

635
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,960
I know how to tickle a rat.

636
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,960
Really good.

637
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,960
Purple, scissors, fishnet, thong, that's all I can remember.

638
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,960
Don't cheat, you're making me cheat by telling me what she looks like.

639
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,960
It's gotta be from memory.

640
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,960
There's a hair.

641
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,960
There's a university, I don't remember which one.

642
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,960
That um...

643
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:53,960
Gives out rat tickling certificates, and it's just an online course.

644
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,960
It's not even a course, it's more like a PowerPoint.

645
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,960
It's just like an online PowerPoint, and you like, I think you take a quiz.

646
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,960
Maybe you don't even take a quiz at the end.

647
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:11,960
And they just give you a certificate saying you're certified to tickle rats inside of a lab.

648
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,960
Inside of like a lab, basically.

649
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,960
Like if a lab never ever needs a rat tickler, like, you're certified.

650
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,960
And you can show them that as proof.

651
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,960
I don't know if I can send you the link or anything.

652
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,960
I don't know what...

653
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,960
It was a long time ago, but I still have the picture in my phone somewhere.

654
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,960
Of my certification.

655
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,960
In case I ever need to show my certification.

656
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,960
In case of an emergency and a rat needs to be tickled.

657
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,960
I'm ready.

658
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,960
She's got like two strands.

659
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,960
She's got really spiky bangs.

660
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,960
There's her spiky bangs.

661
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,960
Man, you can't even tell what this is.

662
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,960
I think her uniform is like really dark purple too.

663
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,960
Will you tickle pin pals if they're rats?

664
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,960
Yeah.

665
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,960
Of course, I would tickle you even if you're not a rat.

666
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,960
May I ask which university?

667
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,960
Don't doubt my credentials.

668
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,960
It's a real university.

669
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,960
Okay, so she's got like a bra.

670
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,960
And like a shirt.

671
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
And like a...

672
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,960
A dress, but only half...

673
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,960
Only like half of the dress, because then it's cut off.

674
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,960
And she's got like a thong.

675
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,960
There's her thong.

676
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
I feel like I need to zoom in even more.

677
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,960
You're like, you can't see all the details of my art here.

678
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,960
You can't appreciate all the details of the art.

679
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,960
Hold on.

680
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:38,960
There we go.

681
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,960
Now you can see all of the details.

682
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:49,240
details. An effort that I put into this. We started off kind of far away, but now we're

683
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,400
now we're real up close and personal.

684
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,360
Ah, I love lead. I don't even know anything about the drug.

685
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:11,160
She's got like red, red and white stockings.

686
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,040
I don't, uh, I don't really know anything about any drugs.

687
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,080
Some of my family members do.

688
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:35,560
Ah, growing up was interesting to say the least.

689
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,520
There's her stripes and then she's got purple shoes.

690
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:53,240
I know I'm so wholesome and angelic and I don't dabble in the devil's lettuce

691
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:54,920
or the devil's

692
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:07,160
powder, the devil's baking soda or the devil's, the devil's

693
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:18,360
the devil's shrews or the devil's. Is that an M to you? Does that look like an M?

694
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:34,200
There we go. Mercy or the devil's. Thank you for the dollar. Thank you for the dollar.

695
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:43,960
The devil's crystals, the devil's crystals or the devil's candy or the devil's soap.

696
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:54,600
The devil's soap or the devil's, the devil's booger sugar.

697
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:05,640
The devil's booger sugar. Okay, I'm going to draw Icy and then

698
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,640
and Sheebie's last. Sorry, Sheebie. Icy's like real short.

699
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:24,120
Anyway, it's back to Mayday because it's become my new favorite thing.

700
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,320
This pilot, like while they were, oh my god, that scared me.

701
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:41,240
This pilot while they were flying blew out of the, oh thank you for the 100,000 IDR.

702
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:50,760
I don't know what IDR is. I hope that's not like a bunch of money.

703
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,680
Did you donate like a, oh, they're $637. There we go.

704
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:07,240
Wow, what is that currency where it's only $6 but it's 100,000? That's crazy.

705
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:21,640
Oh, Indian rupees. Oh, oh, damn. I don't know how money economics work. Oh, Indonesian rupee.

706
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,560
Last, are you forgetting someone? Oh no, did I?

707
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:38,280
Strani, Azura, Mercy, Icy, Sheebie and then I'm the sixth one but I'm not going to draw myself.

708
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,320
Oh wait, let me, let me draw her tights.

709
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:51,640
Indonesian money, Argentinian monopoly money. Why not? Because there's not going to be space on

710
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:59,560
a canvas and also like, you know, this is fan art. This is fan art. I can't include myself in the fan

711
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:06,200
art. That's like weird. I don't know. I have no space on this canvas.

712
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:14,360
I'm drawing them fan art. You know, I don't want to, I don't need to draw myself fan art. I've already

713
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:20,760
drawn so much fan art of myself. I need to, you know, I need to spread the love, spread my artistic

714
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:31,240
talents to the other girls. I promise them I would draw them so here it is. I think Icy's

715
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:44,440
bangs might go the other way but oh well. There's her hair. Nothing wrong with inserting yourself.

716
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:55,720
Imibezu is an Imibezu hater. I am an Imibezu hater. I hate Imibezu. Fuck that bitch. I hate her.

717
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:06,280
Her voice is ugly and her model is ugly and she's weird and I don't like her because she

718
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:15,400
farts on stream and makes weird content and her feet are ugly.

719
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,160
Thank you for the $2.99. You are your own hater. I am my own hater.

720
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:26,360
Any hate comments you ever see online? That's me on, um, that's me on burner accounts.

721
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,080
Yep, they're all me. Anytime you see a hate comment, it's me hating on myself.

722
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:39,320
Just to kind of like pretend that I have some haters. Because in reality everyone loves me and

723
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,880
I don't want to, I don't want to make the other veiler girls jealous by not having any haters so

724
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:50,040
I purposefully hate on myself. I hope no one's taking this seriously. Every hate comment you see

725
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:58,920
is real. I know some people are weird and like like to like to take things out of proportion.

726
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,480
Every hate comment you see, I mean you probably don't see a lot of hate comments on my videos

727
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:10,280
because I delete them all. But um, anyone you do see ever is real.

728
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,880
You have a lot of free time then? Of course I do.

729
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,840
I'm a VTuber, of course I have free time. What do you think I do all day? Make content? No.

730
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:34,280
I make fake hate accounts so I can get so out and hate on myself. Sorry, I'm like...

731
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,560
Here's Icy.

732
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,760
Don't talk about her feet like that.

733
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,760
Liberty is way better. Oh, the amount of comments I get.

734
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:02,200
Hold on, let me get, let me get, oh fuck. All of my markers are falling.

735
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:14,520
What was I even saying? Yeah, the amount of comments I get like that is crazy. Also the amount

736
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,960
also the amount of comments that are like, wow. Her voice is so familiar but I don't know where

737
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:25,720
I've heard it before. I'm sure Strani gets a lot of those comments too. What colors are shebies?

738
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,360
What color is shebie?

739
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,000
She's blonde.

740
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:44,600
And she wears like a black, she wears like black office attire and red and red.

741
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,920
Yeah, red rope. Yeah, I know. I have a great rem, meh, meh, meh.

742
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:11,720
I have great memory. All right, let's stick shebie in here. Anyways, I was talking about the,

743
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:16,760
God, it's getting hot in my room. What type is it? Okay, I was talking about the...

744
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:25,400
Wait, shebie's taller than Icy. Fuck, I keep doing this.

745
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:34,600
I'll figure something out. Okay, I kind of made shebie the same way I did this year.

746
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,720
Damn it. The heights are accurate. Ignore the heights. Let's just make this another one of

747
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:52,360
shebies boobs. There. Basically, the cockpit has windows, right? In a plane.

748
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:05,560
My feet are getting so tired right now. I have to grip the grip, the strength of the grip I have

749
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:14,360
on this marker is so freaking strong because I have to grip it so hard for it to not slip

750
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:24,040
out of my feet, out of my toes. Yeah, the cockpit in the plane has windows and you screw those

751
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:31,080
windows in with screws and they like, I think they like built the plane with the wrong, I'm so

752
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:37,240
sorry, please don't fall, with the wrong screw size and so when they were doing maintenance,

753
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,760
they, the engineer used the same screw size and for some reason all those years the screws were

754
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,480
fine but when they replaced it with new screws, it didn't work out and so the

755
01:11:49,480 --> 01:12:04,920
cockpit window like fell out mid-flight and one of the pilots was sucked out the window

756
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:10,520
but his feet got caught onto the steering wheel and it started pushing the plane downwards

757
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:18,200
and so they had to grab onto him and move him and then they figured he was probably dead

758
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,560
so they were gonna let go of him, did she be have,

759
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:33,080
she may have socks right, they were gonna let go of him right but um

760
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,320
if they were gonna let go of him, he was gonna fly into the engine of the plane,

761
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,080
ill my, the palm of my feet are even more gross now, he was gonna fly into the engine of the

762
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:53,640
plane and that could like send the whole plane downwards you know, what, what does her,

763
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,600
she wears like some sort of shirt right and it goes like underneath,

764
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,800
she wears a shirt underneath and like a bra, she wears a bra for sure,

765
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:17,080
she doesn't have her whole wampas out, it's like an office shirt, oh fuck,

766
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,440
sorry I see shebe's, shebe's arm is gonna be in your face a little bit

767
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:31,800
and she's got like some stripes but I'm just gonna color it in fully, um so they were hanging

768
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,360
on to him the whole time while landing the plane and he was just like flailing out the window of

769
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:44,200
the plane and getting all bloody and stuff because that's like you know dangerous and guess what

770
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,560
the motherfucker lived, he lived and they were, they were gonna let go of him and he lived,

771
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:55,800
they were hanging on to him the whole time, isn't that crazy, he was like dead for a little bit

772
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,240
though, I think that's how the story goes, he was dead for a little bit,

773
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:09,320
all right, there's shebe's outfit, let me draw her hair,

774
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:18,840
it's wild, happy 20k, thank you, only dead for a little bit, yeah you couldn't like die for a

775
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,320

01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,560
is that from a mean pic, what, no, it's real, it's real and true,

778
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:48,040
this is like a workout for feet, who needs the gym, except I shouldn't be working out my feet,

779
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:54,760
I have like really bad feet, what kind of, what does shebe's hair look like,

01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,920
hit me, hit me, what do you got,

807
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:33,000
not bad, it is not bad, it's good, I don't know why people say honestly not bad as if

01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:39,240
they're expecting it to be bad, it's not bad at all, your rats, pin pal, I already drew pin pal,

01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,960
birth of Venus, come on,

810
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,400
Amy Bison,

811
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,160
society,

812
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:02,040
Bakutek, oh my god,

813
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:05,240
um,

814
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:14,680
lots of people are telling me to draw a plane, why do you want me to draw a plane,

815
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,600
I'm scared of planes, if I look at the picture of the plane I'm gonna freak out,

816
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,560
because it's gonna be so accurate to a real life plane,

817
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,080
Amy taking a mating pass,

818
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:35,800
okay, fine, I'll draw a plane, but it has to be a crash plane, because otherwise

819
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:42,200
I'm gonna get too scared of a crash plane, I'll draw a crashing in the ocean,

820
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:51,080
and I'll tell you another story of a crash, a plane crash,

821
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:57,160
because I've been really into plane crashes lately, and there's another one, I think it's

822
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:04,760
from the 1950s, I watched it today as I was falling asleep, so I don't remember anything much, but um,

823
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,320
back in the day, they weren't really that good at like,

824
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:22,680
um, they weren't really that good at like making, like being um,

825
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:33,720
how do I call it, they weren't very strict about keeping planes away from each other,

826
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:39,000
like nowadays like they have like, like lanes for planes in the air or something,

827
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:43,720
like they have altitudes for different planes and lanes, you stay in your lane,

828
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:49,960
so that way you don't crash into other planes, but um, back in the day they didn't really do that,

829
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:58,600
because planes were a new thing, and so um, because planes were a new thing, they would try really

830
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:10,440
hard to like, um, oh that's a thin ass plane, I'll just, I'll draw like multiple parts of the plane,

831
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:17,800
it's all, it's all cracked up, it's all broken in pieces, and so um, they would like try to make

832
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:22,200
planes like appealing, because it was so new and so expensive, so they would try to make it like

833
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:31,640
really um, luxurious, and so they would like go down really close to the ground and like show

834
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:38,680
people stuff, to be like, ooh look down there, it's the lake of fucking, I don't know, Guatemala,

835
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:46,440
or look down there, there's the, there's the, what's the highest amount in the world?

836
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:55,960
I forget the word, there's the highest amount in the world, Everest, they'll be like look down

837
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:00,840
there on your left is Mount Everest, shit like that, they'll like show, they would like show the

838
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:07,800
passengers like um, different sites and shit, which nowadays they don't do, they just leave

839
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,440
you up fucking really high in the air, and you, you can't see shit the whole time,

840
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:19,960
other than like ascending and descending, but um, back then they used to do that,

841
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:28,280
and this one plane was going over, what are those, in Arizona I think, those um,

842
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:41,400
those um, those big mountains that, that go down, a pit, a pit, a pit in Arizona, Grand Canyon,

843
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:51,000
yeah, I called it a pit, the Grand Canyon, at Tibetan Sandbox, I don't even know, I'm trying

844
01:22:51,000 --> 01:23:01,000
to plane crash, um, the, the Grand Canyon, yeah, um, they were like, okay guys, they, they kind of

845
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:07,000
went down to the Grand Canyon, um, and they also went off course a little bit, they would do that

846
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,800
a lot, and they went off course without really telling people, because they didn't have much

847
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:19,720
communication back then, with like, um, you know, like the, the, the towers, the plane towers,

848
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,640
I don't know, the communication stations, I don't fucking know, they didn't have much communication

849
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:30,200
back then with like, the companies, um, the, you know, the tower companies, I don't fucking know

850
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:38,120
anything about planes, um, so they went off course, and I don't exactly know what happened,

851
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:43,000
but there was some sort of miscommunication, and when they went off course, they asked to go at a

852
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,360
specific altitude, and I don't remember if they were denied, and they went anyways, or, I don't

853
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,760
know, something went wrong, but they were like, and they were told that another plane was at that

854
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:58,600
altitude, should I draw a dead people, I'm gonna draw a dead person here, they were told that another

855
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,480
plane was at that altitude, and they were like, okay, that's fine, we'll just make sure to like,

856
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,520
look out for the plane, and if we see it, we'll go further away from it, right?

857
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:17,560
Fuck, I tried to make an X on his face, that's a dead person, um, but little did they know

858
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:24,200
that when you're in the clouds, you can't see shit, because you're in the clouds, so um,

859
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:30,520
what ended up happening is that they saw the other plane, like, right before they were gonna hit it,

860
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:36,920
and so they hit the other plane, and both planes went down, and everyone fucking died,

861
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:42,680
like, they tried to avoid it, but it was too late, like, they were, they like, went straight through a

862
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:53,400
cloud, and on the other side of the cloud was the other plane, there's two dead people,

863
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:01,480
did the plane hit a giant? No, that's just the two pilots in the plane, it's a really small plane,

864
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,720
it's a really small plane, I mean, where were you in 2001?

865
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,720
I can't even tell you where I was in 2001, I can't tell you,

866
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:25,240
I can't, it's a, it's a top secret, if I, if I let you know I'd have to kill you,

867
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:35,240
if I tell you where I was in 2001, I'd have to kill you,

868
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:46,680
no alibi, you have no alibi, you're the one accusing me,

869
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,400
I didn't even bring up 2001, you brought up 2001,

870
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:02,840
something original tip $10, do you know the story about the plane that vanished in bad weather

871
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:08,840
after sending the words dindeck on the radio twice, no one knows what it meant then, and we

872
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:17,240
still don't know now, hmm, no, thank you for the $10 though, you should send the link,

873
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,920
or not the link, but the name of the,

874
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,760
while drawing the accident with her oiled up feet was not what I was expecting to see today,

875
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:33,160
but I'm here for a colon underscore grab, no I wasn't drawing the accident, I'm just drawing

876
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:39,880
an accident, thank you for the $10 though, I'm just drawing an accident, they, they, they both died

877
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,600
in the, in the Grand Canyon, this is in the water, obviously it's in the water, could you not tell

878
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:49,640
that it's water, you should tell me the name of the, the plane, hold on let me look,

879
01:26:54,280 --> 01:27:00,680
is the plane, is that the plane Tom Hanks from the ocean, I don't know, are you, is this a movie

880
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:11,720
reference, congrats on 20k, thank you, the pilot's hands were oily and he lost control,

881
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:18,280
it was driving with his oily feet, the oil is kind of all gone now,

882
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:34,760
are you gay, why are you acting so gay, something original tipped five dollars, the stand deck one

883
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:40,680
is 1947, it's an avalanche castry and stardust accident, oh geez that's a long game, okay hold on

884
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:59,240
let me look it up, 1947, B F A A, Avril, plane castry and stardust accident,

885
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:08,840
oh wow this is like really niche, oh wow,

886
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,600
okay well thank you for letting me know about it, I guess plane crashes are pretty niche,

887
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:28,040
most people don't care, but I care, imagine being a pilot with commercial plane and doing loops,

888
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:34,520
bro I had a fucking dream where I was on, I was on like an airline plane with other passengers and

889
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:42,520
the, the fucking um, the pilot was trolling me and doing loops, like multiple loops over and over

890
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,640
again and I was freaking the fuck out in this dream because I was like oh my god I'm gonna die,

891
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,680
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I don't even think you

892
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:53,720
can do loops with, with those big planes, I feel like they're too big and bulky, they're not designed

893
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:58,200
to do loops, I feel like they would just fall out of the sky if you tried to do a loop, you know,

894
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:06,280
it had to be like a really big loop, I don't think they could do a loop, I don't know,

895
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:10,040
has someone here tried, is there any pilots in chat that try to do a loop with one of these

896
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:16,600
big passenger planes, please, please show yourself, let yourself be known, do a flip,

897
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:24,760
okay anyways here's the end results of the feet, um, they got markers all over them, obviously,

898
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:34,920
um, I think some people have a kink for dirty feet though, so that's good and on this side too,

899
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:41,480
wow, and here's my creations,

900
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,400
I present to you, hold on,

901
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,360
I present to you, plane crash in the ocean by imi bezu,

902
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:11,320
the vealer girls other than that slut imi bezu, because she doesn't deserve to be in the picture

903
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:19,000
by imi bezu, and then the pin pal by imi bezu,

904
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:28,280
three, ah, three masterpieces by imi bezu,

905
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:37,320
I'm putting the auction for the real drawings at um,

906
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:51,000
the auctions for the real authentic drawings at a starting price, 1k, each, each, 1k each,

907
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,000
that's the starting prices,

908
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:02,040
and that's all I have for today folks, let me um, go back to just chatty,

909
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:17,080
um, I feel so gross now,

910
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:38,920
oh wow chat's going quick, okay, sorry it's a bit of a shorter stream,

911
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:45,080
I mean my streams are always a bit of a shorter stream, um,

912
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,520
chat on crack, yeah it does that, I don't know why, it's kind of weird,

913
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,920
like why can't you just be normal, why do you have to do that?

914
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,720
okay rain and nana amano are streaming, I know strani rated nana once,

915
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:09,800
so I feel comfortable reading her too, or rain,

916
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:17,960
did you guys hear about the news from yume plus, it's kind of sad,

917
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:27,560
I kind of, don't tell anyone but um, kind of knew it was coming, I think most people did,

918
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,680
I think most people knew it was coming,

919
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,200
chat reflect streamer, I have good chat, oh you mean like on crack, is that what you mean,

920
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,280
is it just me or is my mouth tracking like way better because I'm closer to the,

921
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:52,280
closer to the phone now, tends to happen but it's sad, it does tend to happen, doesn't it,

922
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:56,840
it does tend to happen with a lot of small companies, oh here let me put that down because

923
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:04,840
I'm closer, it does, that sucks, luckily they can keep their IPs, that's really good because um,

924
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,000
sometimes that doesn't happen, or sometimes it can be a little bit of a

925
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:21,240
a struggle I guess, a little bit of a struggle to get your IP, so I mean I'm sure it was a little

926
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:29,480
bit of a struggle for them too, this soon was a bit insane, I thought it was coming any day now,

927
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:38,360
honestly a lot of companies are are are croaking any day now, when you went, like when I learned

928
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:44,120
to like how bad it is for some of them, I'm like wow, damn that's crazy, not gonna name names of

929
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:49,160
course, not including us, not including us, what we won't croak, I will not let us croak, I will

930
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:58,200
personally not let us croak, will your stream start times ever change, no unless like something

931
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:04,040
changes in my life, I like this start time, I used to stream at, I used to start stream at 8 p.m,

932
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,920
can you believe that, I used to start at 8 p.m and then I would go for four fucking hours,

933
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,840
I don't have a sort of Santa, Santa money anymore,

934
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,400
Niji keeps making bad decisions, I don't think Niji will go down, at least not,

935
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:25,800
not the uh Japanese branch, maybe the English branch, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

936
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,680
she became a vampire, what if she becomes a vampire, oh well yeah if I become a vampire I'll

937
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:41,400
start streaming like at night, because that's when vampires are awake, I hope the most it does well

938
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,520
and whatever she wants to do, she seems like a really nice person from what I saw in your stream

939
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:53,560
with her, I know me too, I haven't been, I've been struggling to reply to DMs um but I do, I do hope

940
01:34:53,560 --> 01:35:01,720
she, she does well, I think she will, she's super talented on her own, like I think whatever she

941
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:10,120
does she'll do good, she's funny too, she's really funny, did I miss another Vtuber company

942
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:14,600
to spamming, they were a very small company, it's not, it didn't, it didn't make any big news,

943
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:20,040
um they were, they were very small but they were a friend, so that's why it sucks,

944
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:26,040
I don't know maybe it did make big news, did false ID talk about it, I don't know, um

945
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
that's not kind of bad, what's not bad

946
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:38,040
Pinky told painting competition, what, why would it be a competition, what,

947
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:45,320
Melissa's doing even better in her pl, don't worry, I know she's doing good, I know she's doing good,

948
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:50,680
she's like, she's funny on her own, she's talented, she can do stuff on her own, like

949
01:35:51,240 --> 01:36:00,840
a lot of people think that joining a company means that you'll get a lot of support

950
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:11,960
and I think, I think some people overestimate the amount of support, like they expect

951
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:20,680
and I think Mamosa is definitely, honestly all the girls are definitely better on their own

952
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:25,720
and anything, anything, like everything they've done they already did on their own, you know,

953
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:32,120
um, yeah you gotta be careful, especially with small companies, they can't really,

954
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:38,600
they might, they might promise something but you know, they might not go through with it

955
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:43,960
as we've seen from Yume Plus, as we've seen from Yume Plus,

956
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:50,040
do you still get many marshmallows Amy, I don't, I don't get as many anymore because I

957
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:57,080
can't answer them, would you like me to answer some, I feel like maybe I could answer some on stream

958
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:04,840
right now, most of them are just really lovey, or like telling you, telling, telling me about my day

959
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:14,280
or maybe a little bit corny, maybe a little bit corny, I know Amy made a lot of her own assets

960
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:23,880
or had them commissioned with her own money, yeah, yeah, only if you're comfortable,

961
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:31,080
is Viola a small, small company, I like to think so, yeah, I think we are, I feel like

962
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:39,400
once, I feel like once all of us pass 30k, then I think we'll be a little bit bigger,

963
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:48,520
but V2Bang is already so niche that like, no matter how big we get, I feel like it'll be hard to

964
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:52,840
ever be considered a sort of big company, because when I think of big companies, I think of like,

965
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:58,680
all alive, it'd be crazy to get as big as all alive, but I don't think so, I don't think so,

966
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:08,200
that's crazy, yes, and niche internet micro celebrity, yeah, small enough that the CEO is

967
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:14,680
one of its talents, I don't think that contributes to how small it is, I think that was just a

968
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:18,840
choice, that's just a choice, like it doesn't have anything to do with how small we are,

969
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:24,040
it's not like we need more talent, so the CEO stepped up and was like, I'll be a talent,

970
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:31,960
I think she just wanted to do that, you guys are going pretty far, oh thank you,

971
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:39,160
here, I can answer some marshmallows, but don't send anything corny right now, because we're on

972
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:45,960
YouTube, and I have to be like extra safe now, I have to be extra safe now unfortunately,

973
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:57,400
because I got a strike, because I got a strike here, let me send you

974
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:02,440
a marshmallow cut, I'm hungry, I'm gonna order sushi after this,

975
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:11,480
I'm gonna order sushi after this, there's a link, there's a link if you want to,

976
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:16,840
save it for brosley, yeah I could, I could, I could, yeah, I'm not sure when I'll do that,

977
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:22,280
I'm not sure when I'll do that, I hope soon, I hope,

978
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:36,520
should I show you, is that safe to show you, should be safe, the strikes go away,

979
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,440
they go away in like three months, so I have to be careful for three months,

980
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,320
um,

981
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:57,400
don't read out loud, what, what, do you want me to answer out loud, don't read out loud, what do you

982
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:07,880
mean, let me um, let me catch the marshmallow, oh that's not it, that's display capture, let me

983
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:15,640

984
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:23,400

um, okay I'll show this,

988
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:11,880
someone made a drawing for Esteban, oh thank you, it looks like her too,

989
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,360
I don't want to talk too much about her because I'll start to cry, but thank you,

990
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:23,880
I really appreciate it, I like it, I'll save that,

991
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:43,640
um, let me try to crop, crop, crop this so that it's uh, it's cropped to the, to the marshmallow,

992
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:48,120
there,

993
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:56,680
there we go, sorry chat, I'm covering you,

994
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:06,840
this has been a fun time so far, how are you doing, I'm super proud of you for hitting 20k,

995
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:14,200
I'm glad I became your big brother before this amazing time, I'm okay, I'm happy, I have to do

996
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:19,400
some sort of 30k celebration I guess too, I don't know, I don't want to do any more promised

997
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:25,400
celebrations until I can finish my um, other promised stuff for my other milestones,

998
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:30,840
because if I keep growing, then I'll have so many like celebrations stuff to do,

999
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:38,760
and I still have to finish the previous ones, um, let me, let me refresh the page,

1000
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:51,000
Amy you're the best little sister, I love you so much, thank you, this one's funny,

1001
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,720
is life even worth living knowing I can never get your cute little toes in my mouth, Amy,

1002
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:05,960
it is, it is, you can always imagine my cute little toes in your mouth, you can always imagine it,

1003
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:13,720
I know it's not as good as the real thing, but um, you should, you should continue even though you,

1004
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:21,400
you can't have my toes in your mouth, princess carrying piggyback rides around the shoulders,

1005
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:28,280
which is your preferred method of transportation by big friend, you guys have funny questions,

1006
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,680
deep throat it, deep throat what the toes,

1007
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,000
so real, real,

1008
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:47,320
yeah we're gonna hit 40k pretty soon, I don't think so, but I, I, I, I want to get another video out,

1009
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:56,120
and I have to be another um, I might have to be another like improv, I have like no time to

1010
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:02,280
write scripts anymore because um, forlude audios is a lot for me, so I'm like, I'm banging the

1011
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:08,920
mouth but I don't have script writing time, up to 34k, oh did we already reach 34k, no way,

1012
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:21,480
where is me, where is me, where is me in my channel, oh we did reach 34k, thank you, thank you,

1013
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:28,280
that's nice, thank you, um, preferred method of transportation,

1014
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:36,360
I think I prefer piggyback rides, I never got much piggyback rides when I was a kid,

1015
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:41,720
so I think I prefer piggyback rides, when I was a kid I would piggyback all of my friends,

1016
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:48,680
because um, I don't know I just had weird friends that would always try to get on my back, and I was

1017
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:54,680
like, you know how I tweeted out that I have like strong farm women jeans, I really do have strong

1018
01:44:54,680 --> 01:45:01,080
farm women jeans, so I would piggyback all my friends on my back because I was the strongest,

1019
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:11,000
um, what is this, I know that the VLR discord server is only for stream notifications,

1020
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,040
a big part of vtubing is for a community where fans can interact with each other,

1021
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:17,480
any place I'm creating an official place where we can all share our love for Amy that isn't Twitter,

1022
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:27,320
so I know that's a big part of vtubing, but it's not, um, like you guys can interact in the fan

1023
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,400
server, the only problem is like we're not affiliated with that, but you guys can interact in

1024
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:40,520
the fan server if you want, like make your own server, but um, like vtubing, like corporal vtubing

1025
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:48,520
is like not, is not the same as like indie, so like um, a lot of companies stay away from official

1026
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:54,040
servers with us in them, you know, with the talents in them, I don't understand why,

1027
01:45:54,280 --> 01:46:02,040
Amy, I like to hold through my screen during, during this stream, please do more feed streams,

1028
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:06,840
you're gonna go through all of the, all of the, you're gonna go through all of your, all of your

1029
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:15,320
monitors, let us groom you now, groom each other, my pin pals can groom each other, that's how you

1030
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:21,640
can cope with not being able to groom me, yeah, many other companies don't have official discord

1031
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:29,000
servers, yeah, don't touch discord with a 10 foot pole, I've, I, I trust me, I know the kind of crazy

1032
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:38,680
fucking people on discord, I know, I'm aware, I've met them, I met a lot of them, and they're all crazy

1033
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:46,920
there's always the free chat, yeah you guys could talk in free chat, I probably won't be there very

1034
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:54,760
often, but like you can chat it to each other, yes there's a fanzir, you could just look it up on

1035
01:46:54,760 --> 01:47:01,800
reddit or something, like any, any, on twitter too, I know I probably shouldn't like, I probably shouldn't um

1036
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:12,600
encourage it, but like, I don't know if you guys want to talk to each other, I feel bad saying like

1037
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:21,160
no, what is your happiest memory, oh that's so depressing, fuck, um, my happiest memory

1038
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:36,680
I don't know, I have a lot of my saddest memories, I don't have a lot of my happiest memories

1039
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:49,240
can they be fixed though, some of them can, some of them need to be in jail

1040
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:56,200
does it stink, what, being with your big bro

1041
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:05,800
I guess one of my happier memories can be debuting, for sure, I don't want to say woman

1042
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:12,440
brain, what do you mean, what do you mean, I take that back, fuck you, you're not allowed to be part

1043
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:23,400
of my happiest memory, meeting us obviously, I think that's definitely one of them, maybe others

1044
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:31,960
could be like quitting jobs, quitting jobs would be happy memories for me, because I didn't like

1045
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:42,520
any of the ones I, I were at, I did, like I was at, which debut, both debut, both debuts, of course

1046
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:51,880
um classic depression moment, yeah I don't, I can remember a lot of depressing moments, but I

1047
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:58,760
can't remember a lot of happy moments, I don't know why, sorry, that's depressing, maybe getting

1048
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:06,520
my rats, getting my rats, my first two rats was very happy too, I found a channel recently

1049
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:11,960
because of your andy and lele games, you might like everything I see, keep at it and enjoy, thank you, thank you

1050
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:21,880
um are there any streamers outside of the vtuber community who've influenced you slash you've

1051
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:31,000
learned from? jibidoki kind of influenced me, my phone got a notification

1052
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:41,800
jibidoki definitely influenced me because she's the first vtuber that was like kind of honest about

1053
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:48,040
being like using a cute voice that I, that I saw, that I saw, that I like learned of, um

1054
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:55,400
what other, oh wait outside of the vtuber community, oh outside of the vtuber community, sorry, sorry,

1055
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:59,720
outside, uh outside, um well when I first started streaming um

1056
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:10,120
I uh, I learned a lot from uh katlienta, unfortunately katlienta kind of sucks now

1057
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:15,960
because she's like leaching off a vtuber drama on her channel, which I think is cringe, I'm sorry

1058
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:22,360
I think it's cringe but back in the back a few months ago or a year ago katlienta made a lot of um

1059
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:30,200
really helpful streaming advice like technical advice and just like just advice for how to stream,

1060
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:36,520
how to be a better streamer especially for beginners and I learned a lot from from her tutorials um

1061
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:40,520
so yeah I would say her um

1062
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:50,120
in terms of like personality maybe, I also really like Jenna Marbles, my fucking, my life got

1063
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:55,720
significant, my quality of life significantly decreased as soon as Jenna Marbles left youtube

1064
01:50:57,240 --> 01:51:02,200
like my depression meter raised to maximum when Jenna Marbles left youtube

1065
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:08,680
so I'm really, I'm really um, I'm really uh

1066
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,920
inspired by Jenna Marbles and like the kind of content she makes

1067
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:19,480
what kind of guys do you like or what is your type of character or guys do you

1068
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:26,600
prefer average macho man buff harry fanboys pretty far, I guess so many questions like this

1069
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:32,840
I guess the only thing I don't like here I should show the question

1070
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:40,200
the only thing I really really don't like is like super super buff guys um

1071
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:47,080
I think a lot of guys misunderstand that girls want super buff guys and it's like no

1072
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:52,920
at least not me I don't like buff um I hope your macho kind of got sorry

1073
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:59,480
I don't like it ripped bros it's over sorry I don't know I just feel like

1074
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:04,360
I feel like we wouldn't mesh well and also I just don't like that body type

1075
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:13,800
role-voided kind yeah like big buff yeah yeah guys want super buff guys way more than women do

1076
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:18,200
I feel like our our personality types and our lifestyles wouldn't match you know

1077
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:28,200
like I I I am not waking up at 7am to go to the gym I'm not counting my calories I am not eating

1078
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:37,000
plain chicken with rice I am not um drinking protein shakes and pushing those weights you know

1079
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,760
like I will I will not come with you I will not come with you to the gym I will not participate in

1080
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:51,720
that um and I I think it's I yeah we wake up at 5am yeah sorry buff penthouse it's over

1081
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:57,000
I don't have the energy for that and I don't think I could beat with someone that has the

1082
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:05,080
energy for that because it's like no no it just doesn't mesh with me the gains I know the gains

1083
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:15,240
but like I don't know it's like it's not for me you know um chubby cook then he'll feed you

1084
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:22,520

1088
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:53,640
average um Harry I'm not too big on mostly because I was bullied for being Harry as a kid so now I'm

1089
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:58,600
kind of disgusted by hair but as long as it's not excessive I don't really care that much you know

1110
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:51,240
I'm not original in the slightest basically just from other people

1111
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:01,080
oh hold on I'm really I'm really sweaty right now let me get my fan out

1112

01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:11,000
where's my fan oh here it is

1114
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:24,280
olive creation is just paying homage to the things that inspire you to create yeah damn that's deep

1115
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,120
real and true and deep

1116
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:32,920
Amy you fed the flipbrows good today I need to see your butt in those yoga pants I don't really

1117
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:43,480
have a butt I don't have a good butt man I don't literally oh my god it's so embarrassing so like

1118
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:51,320
my cousin is really really interested not interested but like into taking pictures of herself

1119
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:56,600
so when we went to all of these cool places and attractions I was basically her personal

1120
01:57:56,600 --> 01:58:03,000
photographer because she's like crazy about taking pictures of herself and like I I know

1121
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:09,800
how to take pictures of people because I take a lot of anytime I take a picture I like take

1122
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:14,120
forever to get the right angle so even though I don't take many pictures I know how to make

1123
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:18,760
someone look a little bit better and um I was just her personal photographer and every time I

1124
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:26,280
took a picture of her um I would be like damn like she looks good like work girl you know

1125
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:31,800
but then we would take pictures together right and I I don't know how to pose in like full-body

1126
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:38,360
pictures so like anytime we would get a picture together she'd be like posing like a model and

1127
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:44,520
she'd look so freaking good like Instagram model level like fucking she would look so good and I

1128
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:49,000
would just be standing there awkwardly she doesn't even smile like that's how model-esque

1129
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:55,880
she tries to be and I I'm standing there I'm like way shorter than her and I look so awkward

1130
01:58:55,880 --> 01:59:03,320
standing next to her because I just stand there like awkwardly and it sucks to see all the pictures

1131
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:11,720
with us because I'm like fuck man I'm so awkward next to her uh yeah that's just what that reminds

1132
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:18,280
me of like I I I'm not good at I'm not gonna taking pictures of myself and I'm not gonna posing and

1133
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:26,040
um I don't think I could get a good butt picture like Strani's butt picture was good I don't think

1134
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:33,000
I'd be able to pose like that I I'd be like hunched over I'd be hunched over like a crab

1135
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:41,080
they're not like a crab like a shrimp tear hot chocolate before you get tucked into bed uh

1136
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:51,160
hot chocolate hot chocolate ask her for tips I should she gets a lot of good pictures of herself

1137
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:57,560

1139
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:08,440

1145
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:03,800

1146
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:11,960
feed tubers versus feet uh trend that some of the other veiler members have been doing on exeter um

1147
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:19,320
maybe I probably would just post like a picture of my feet that I already have I don't think I'd

1148
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:24,520
post a new picture of my feet just because it's a lot of effort you know it's a lot of effort

1149
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:32,280
um I'm just here to see someone drawing with the toes reminds me of an archer who

1224
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:06,440
and though I don't have I don't have a pen pal I only have a pin pal is what offensive

1225
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:11,240
I don't know is this someone just said someone asked me to say something but I'm scared of saying

1226
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:17,160
I'm scared of saying things that people tell me to tell me to say because what if it's offensive

1227
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:20,200
what does that mean is that your name do you want me to call you cool

02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:44,840
and like whiny but deeper sounds like a little nicer so I really want to do a stream

1239
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:49,960
where like karaoke stream where I practice those it would have to be on archive probably

1240
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:51,880
probably

1241
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:59,000
thank you to the person who reminds me to take my birth control every day

1242
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:06,680

1243
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:16,760

1244
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:23,720
I was drunk like in the moment I was like fuck yeah I sound so good right now and then I listened

1245
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:29,960
back to the stream and I was like holy shit I was not hearing myself accurately what's the highest

1246
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:34,840
note you can make I don't know I don't know notes like that like I'm not a professional singer I

1247
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:40,760
can't be like oh yeah the highest note I can make is a seven like I don't know what that means then

1248
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:49,720
I can go my when I got a singing singing teacher she said I was a oh what did she say I was

1249
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:52,440

02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:58,200
she said I was a let me alone add block

1251
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:06,360
singing categories right like a different

1252
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:20,520
she said I was a soprano I feel like I'm not a soprano though because anytime I try to sing

1253
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:25,160
high pitched I sound like shit I sound like shit and then anytime I try to sing deeper I'm like

1254
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,160
this sounds better

1255
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:47,720
can you go queen type of high pitched I don't I don't what is what is queen type of high pitched

1256
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:50,280

1257
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:54,440
I have no more juice left

1258
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:11,640

1262
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:41,160

1263
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:47,480

1265
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:08,680
don't be regarded karaoke stream is 10 out of 10 I still ferried up once or twice a week

1266
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:10,440
still wishing you didn't mute

1267
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:17,480
every day people cry because I didn't because I I muted while I was puking

1268
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:24,040
brie is good brie is good I like to microwave brie with the honey or maple syrup and dip stuff in

1269
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:29,480
inside of it when you said you liked men sounding whiny during activities what do you

1270
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:35,960
exactly mean by that pitch cadence personality can you give me an example all of them all of them

1271
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:39,160
um all of them example

1272
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:43,240
like

1273
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:49,880
there's always next time you get drunk to not mute there is I don't know when I'll get drunk

1274
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:57,080
again because I those times felt like they made me feel like shit so I'll need a break um so I come

1275
02:15:57,080 --> 02:16:03,720
here pixie she was right next to me came it I listen to a lot of I'm I'm a I'm a I'm a gooner

1276
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:11,800
myself I listen to a lot of um boyfriend asmr not as much anymore but I went through a phase

1277
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:18,200
where I listened to a lot and I noticed that a lot of guys like artificially deeps of course you do

1278
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:23,160
shut up I've noticed that a lot of guys artificially deep into their voice

1279
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:31,880
and I just was like I just really I'm not gonna like my favorites I'm not gonna like my favorites

1280
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:37,160
I don't really I only had one of favorite ever and they've luck and deleted their channel so

1281
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:41,160
you can't even find it wait a minute

1282
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:45,640

1285
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:09,320

1286
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:16,760
me and they were like uh ew she listens to my content okay I'm kidding um free with grilled

1287

1288
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:23,880
um

1289
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:29,720
yeah male ASMR artists do exist yeah

1290
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:37,960

1293
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:51,400
do you know what I mean like they try to go out grievely and I was I it was always so

02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:57,880
it was so unattractive so when I say whiny I mean like just sound like yourself sound like

1295
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:06,440

1297

1313
02:19:54,520 --> 02:20:00,440
family and I kind of felt bad because I kind of got you a little bit of attached a little

1314
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:06,440
bit attached to my pets and if I if they just suddenly disappeared and I never explained anything

1317
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:24,200
rice if it's not with rice it won't be considered a meal and just a snack
