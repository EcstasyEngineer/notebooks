My f U C A G H E C L E, that I worked so hard to make clan this one working.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.200
Okay, there is real chat.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.000
Hello, thank you for coming from Shibhi's...

02:55.180 --> 02:58.820
I'm not sure if that chat is working completely correctly either,

02:58.820 --> 03:05.360
but thank you for coming from Shibi's stream, how was it! I was there too.

05:14.160 --> 05:20.160
That's like a lot for a poor Canadian like me.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.160
So yeah.

05:22.160 --> 05:30.160
Alright, the next thing on my list is...

05:30.160 --> 05:34.160
Right, for those who listen to the loot audio, give me feedback.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
I want feedback.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.160
Like, like, like, like, uh...

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
Like, hurt my feelings.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.160
Like literally, if you didn't like it, like tell me.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.160
Like, tell me what was wrong with it, you know?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.160
Did we miss the Canadian accent?

05:46.160 --> 05:48.160
I don't think I have a Canadian accent.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.160
It was my French.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.160
My French is very like...

05:52.160 --> 05:54.160
My French is very Canadian.

05:54.160 --> 06:02.160
I went to a French school, like, up until college.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.160
Yeah.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.160
Is my music on?

06:07.160 --> 06:08.160
It is.

06:08.160 --> 06:14.160
I was enrolled in a French school since birth until I went to college.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.160
And then I went to an English college.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.160
Did you have a Patreon as well?

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
Yes, we do.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.160
It's in the description.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.160
There was an audio.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.160
Bro, you guys don't know?

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
What the hell?

06:26.160 --> 06:28.160
It was not French immersion.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.160
It was not French immersion.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
It was fully French.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.160
We did everything in French at that school.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.160
All the teachers spoke French to us.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.160
I kind of hated it.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.160
But you know, whatever.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.160
Now I learned French.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.160
Ow.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.160
I'm sipping on some tea for my throat.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
It was helpful.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
Okay, hold on.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.160
I'm scrolling up so I can see if anyone...

06:50.160 --> 06:51.160
Why can't I scroll up?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
Fucking YouTube chat.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
I had nothing to say about it.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.160
It was my first ASMR.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.160
Oh.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
I think your accent is cute.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.160
Oh, thank you.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.160
Okay, well, if you have complaints...

07:03.160 --> 07:04.160
I don't know.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.160
Send me a marshmallow.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.160
Tell me, okay?

07:07.160 --> 07:08.160
Is the delay high?

07:08.160 --> 07:10.160
The delay for chat might be high.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.160
What kind of tea?

07:11.160 --> 07:12.160
It's raspberry tea.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.160
Um...

07:17.160 --> 07:18.160
Oh my god.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.160
What else?

07:19.160 --> 07:20.160
What else?

07:21.160 --> 07:22.160
Okay.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.160
Next I have some slides.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.160
Yup.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.160
Didn't even know there was a voice?

07:28.160 --> 07:29.160
What voice?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.160
Voice?

07:33.160 --> 07:37.160
Thank you for all the support that we've received, by the way, too.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.160
I was so surprised.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.160
I thought there was going to be like 500 people at the debut.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.160
And we had like 2,000 something.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
I was like, damn.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.160
I was not expecting that.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.160
I really appreciate that you guys showed up.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.160
I'm not always going to be like...

07:56.160 --> 07:59.160
I'm not always going to be super high energy during streams,

07:59.160 --> 08:01.160
but I'm also not always going to be super low energy.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.160
It just depends on the day.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.160
And today is a sick day.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.160
Right, so I have some slides to show you.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.160
How do I present these?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
Okay.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.160
Present.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.160
All right.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.160
Okay.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.160
I gotta go back to old chat.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.160
Okay, there we go.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.160
Um...

08:30.160 --> 08:31.160
Nope, that's the wrong one.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.160
Nope, that's also the wrong one.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.160
Okay, okay.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.160
I'm figuring it out.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.160
I'm figuring it out.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.160
One moment, please.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.160
Window capture.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.160
Sure.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.160
There it is.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.160
All right.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.160
Okay.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.160
Oh.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.160
I hope I don't crop anything out.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.160
There's my...

09:19.160 --> 09:21.160
Maybe I should even put it a little higher up

09:21.160 --> 09:24.160
because chat is kind of covering it.

09:24.160 --> 09:28.160
Here's my 2.0 slides.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.160
So I will mostly talk about myself and then...

09:36.160 --> 09:39.160
And then maybe we can talk about you at the end.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.160
We'll see, we'll see.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.160
And I'll probably answer marshmallow questions too

09:43.160 --> 09:44.160
at the end.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.160
So right, here is the 2.0.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.160
Emmy's list of very important info.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.160
Memorize it all.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.160
You're gonna get tested on it at the end.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.160
Next.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.160
Okay.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.160
Ignore the fact that I'm using camera.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.160
We're pro streamers.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.160
Oh, hi, Mercy.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.160
Good, good, good.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.160
Remember it all.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.160
Okay.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.160
Who is Emmy?

10:11.160 --> 10:12.160
What?

10:14.160 --> 10:15.160
What?

10:15.160 --> 10:17.160
Emmy was living.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.160
Right.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.160
Okay.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.160
Full paw and V-tubing, I know.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.160
Right, so, uh,

10:24.160 --> 10:27.160
Vealer have allowed us to be

10:27.160 --> 10:29.160
open about our PLs.

10:29.160 --> 10:33.160
Obviously, don't go and bother the other girls

10:33.160 --> 10:34.160
about theirs.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.160
If they don't want to say it,

10:36.160 --> 10:38.160
they don't have to say it, you know?

10:38.160 --> 10:41.160
If they want to keep it private, that's okay.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.160
I am not keeping it private

10:44.160 --> 10:46.160
because a lot of you already know.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
Right, yeah.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.160
And also, my voice is pretty recognizable.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.160
So, like,

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
possible lover.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
No, it means past life.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.160
Right, yeah.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.160
My voice is really recognizable.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.160
So, to me, it's like,

11:06.160 --> 11:07.160
what's the point?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.160
Unless I had, like, you know,

11:09.160 --> 11:11.160
some closets in my,

11:11.160 --> 11:15.160
some skeletons in my closet to hide.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.160
I don't, but,

11:18.160 --> 11:21.160
you know, if you do, I understand

11:21.160 --> 11:23.160
if you want to hide your past account,

11:23.160 --> 11:24.160
but I'm not going to do that.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.160
Like, and,

11:25.160 --> 11:26.160
God, I'm so scattered brain.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.160
Like, in terms of V-tubers

11:28.160 --> 11:30.160
who join companies doing that,

11:30.160 --> 11:32.160
it's okay, like,

11:32.160 --> 11:33.160
I don't judge the ones who hide it,

11:33.160 --> 11:35.160
but I didn't want to hide it.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.160
So, yeah.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.160
Go watch my other content.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.160
It's really good, and I like it,

11:41.160 --> 11:42.160
so I hope you will also like it.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.160
Who is living?

11:44.160 --> 11:46.160
You just search Liberty on YouTube.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.160
Yeah.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.160
Just how, the way I spelled it here,

11:48.160 --> 11:49.160
you can just search that,

11:49.160 --> 11:51.160
and if you want to go watch the other content.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.160
Oh my God, am I running out of tea already?

11:56.160 --> 11:57.160
I am.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.160
Yes, it's great to be back.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.160
It was so fucking hard.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.160
Staying away from you,

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
you don't fucking understand.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
You don't understand.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.160
You don't understand how hard it was

12:12.160 --> 12:13.160
to not stream.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.160
God, I'm getting voice cracks.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.160
To not stream.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.160
To not tweet.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.160
To not make any videos,

12:20.160 --> 12:23.160
because I had to work on viewer stuff.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.160
It was killing me, bro.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.160
But I'm really happy to be back now,

12:29.160 --> 12:31.160
and I'm really happy to be able

12:31.160 --> 12:34.160
to continue making content for you guys

12:34.160 --> 12:36.160
with the support of viewer.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.160
And the other girls too.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.160
Go support the other girls too.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.160
Right, so,

12:43.160 --> 12:44.160
man,

12:45.160 --> 12:47.160
I'm kind of covering my own,

12:49.160 --> 12:51.160
I'm kind of covering my own thing here.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.160
Oh fuck, I'm locked.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.160
Right.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.160
So don't,

12:58.160 --> 13:00.160
don't go on my old channel

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
and be like,

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
guys, I found her,

13:02.160 --> 13:03.160
she's gonna be, she's gonna be,

13:03.160 --> 13:04.160
go subscribe.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.160
Don't do that.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.160
I will announce it myself.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.160
So you don't have to do that.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.160
Okay, don't even worry about it.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.160
Don't go, don't go reading the other channel

13:13.160 --> 13:14.160
and being like,

13:14.160 --> 13:15.160
I found her,

13:15.160 --> 13:17.160
I will do that for you, okay?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.160
I'll make an announcement.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.160
When YouTube stops calling our subscribers,

13:21.160 --> 13:23.160
because I don't want to make an announcement,

13:23.160 --> 13:25.160
and then everyone who comes and subscribes

13:25.160 --> 13:26.160
gets cold.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.160
That's like,

13:28.160 --> 13:29.160
that's annoying.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.160
Sorry, let me, let me try to read chat.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
Pretty cool that you can make loot content,

13:37.160 --> 13:39.160
though obviously you have to do other stuff on,

13:39.160 --> 13:41.160
sites other than YouTube.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.160
Oh, what do you mean we have to do other stuff?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.160
We don't have to do anything on,

13:49.160 --> 13:51.160
on any other sites other than YouTube.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.160
Unless you're talking about Patreon content,

13:53.160 --> 13:55.160
but we signed up knowing that we had to do that.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.160
You know someone stupid enough to do that anyways?

14:01.160 --> 14:02.160
Yes,

14:02.160 --> 14:04.160
I know multiple people stupid enough to do that.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.160
Okay.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.160
Okay.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.160
All right.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.160
Conclusion, good company, I appreciate that.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.160
Yeah.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.160
Next slide.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.160
Next slide, where's my slides?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160
Okay, there's my slides.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.160
All right, stuff I want to mention.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.160
Five out of ten?

14:34.160 --> 14:36.160
That was, that was like, at least a six out of ten.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.160
Right.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.160
I want to do fanzly streams eventually.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.160
But we will have to wait until around July.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.160
Maybe more, I don't, I don't know.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.160
But at least July,

14:51.160 --> 14:53.160
because I think Strani said like,

14:53.160 --> 14:58.160
oh, we have to establish ourselves on YouTube first.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.160
Yeah, they're very supportive of the talents.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.160
That's why I joined.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.160
Next point.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.160
I'm a little bit mentally ill,

15:08.160 --> 15:10.160
but we're not going to talk about it.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.160
And I will never bring it up to you.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.160
Just know if I do some wax shit,

15:15.160 --> 15:17.160
or if you see some wax shit, you know.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.160
C'est la vie.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.160
Oh yeah, right.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.160
Okay, so I know my shtick is like,

15:30.160 --> 15:31.160
cis con, right?

15:31.160 --> 15:34.160
A sister con,

15:34.160 --> 15:36.160
what does con mean?

15:36.160 --> 15:39.160
Consensual convention.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.160
Blue Twitch?

15:44.160 --> 15:45.160
Oh, you mean fanzly?

15:47.160 --> 15:48.160
Brocon, whatever.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.160
Oh, complex.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
Complex.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.160
What does it end with an N if it means complex?

15:55.160 --> 15:56.160
Okay, well.

15:57.160 --> 16:01.160
Yeah, I know my little shtick here is cis con.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.160
My rats are fighting in the background.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.160
Oh my god.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.160
Did you hear that?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.160
Okay, you hear that?

16:20.160 --> 16:22.160
Okay, if I hear that again,

16:22.160 --> 16:24.160
I might have to BRB to separate them.

16:25.160 --> 16:29.160
I'm trying to introduce some new babies to my adults,

16:29.160 --> 16:31.160
and they're kind of not getting along.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.160
Oh my fucking god.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.160
Alright.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.160
What's their names?

16:44.160 --> 16:46.160
You'll see them soon.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
In handcams.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.160
Right, so,

16:53.160 --> 16:56.160
I know that my whole shtick is like brocon cis con,

16:56.160 --> 17:00.160
but unfortunately to disappoint you,

17:00.160 --> 17:02.160
we can't do that on Patreon.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.160
I don't even think we can do that on fanzly either.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.160
We have to abide by their TOS.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.160
Yeah, I know that might disappoint some of you,

17:13.160 --> 17:14.160
and you might be like,

17:14.160 --> 17:16.160
oh well why don't you go to this other platform

17:16.160 --> 17:18.160
that does allow that stuff.

17:19.160 --> 17:23.160
You know, the shirt that we could,

17:23.160 --> 17:28.160
but also we're trying to stick to the bigger platforms

17:28.160 --> 17:31.160
that a lot of people have access to

17:31.160 --> 17:33.160
and a lot of people know about.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.160
It's not very smart to go streaming

17:38.160 --> 17:41.160
on smaller platforms,

17:41.160 --> 17:44.160
because then you're just making your...

17:48.160 --> 17:50.160
Oh god, I'm having a brain fart.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.160
When we have the option for a bigger platform,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.160
let's just try that first, right?

17:56.160 --> 17:58.160
Big brain, right? Accessibility, yes, yes, yes.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
Accessibility equals growth.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.160
That's what I mean.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.160
Yeah, you don't want to

18:05.160 --> 18:08.160
shoot yourself in the foot right from the start, you know?

18:08.160 --> 18:10.160
Let's just wait until we get banned first,

18:10.160 --> 18:11.160
and then we can go to those platforms.

18:11.160 --> 18:14.160
I'm just kidding, don't ban us, please.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.160
Right, my IRL goals, I have real life goals,

18:18.160 --> 18:21.160
because I'm actually, you know, not...

18:21.160 --> 18:24.160
I'm only part-time anime girl on the internet.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.160
My real life goals is...

18:28.160 --> 18:32.160
I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.160
I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning

18:35.160 --> 18:39.160
because it's summer right now, and...

18:40.160 --> 18:43.160
If something is allowed on Fancy, but not on Patreon,

18:43.160 --> 18:45.160
you can get banned from Patreon for doing it on Fancy.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.160
Shit, yeah.

18:47.160 --> 18:51.160
So, no Bokon, I guess, on Fancy.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.160
Yeah, I don't have air conditioning.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.160
A lot of apartments don't come with air conditioning,

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
so I want to move to one that does

18:59.160 --> 19:01.160
because it's going to be summer soon,

19:01.160 --> 19:04.160
and if I, you know,

19:04.160 --> 19:07.160
if I am able to do that,

19:07.160 --> 19:10.160
that helps me be able to stream longer,

19:10.160 --> 19:13.160
and it helps me be able to make more content

19:13.160 --> 19:17.160
because I will be comfortable during the summer,

19:17.160 --> 19:20.160
because I have to keep my stream short for now

19:20.160 --> 19:25.160
because I can't stream for long hours in the heat without AC.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.160
So, yeah.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.160
What did GB say?

19:30.160 --> 19:32.160
Scroll up.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.160
Pomf?

19:33.160 --> 19:35.160
Yeah, some people said pomf.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.160
Yeah, some people said pomf.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.160
I don't know if we'll go there.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.160
Right, yeah.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.160
Next goal is I want to get a big girl microphone.

19:44.160 --> 19:48.160
I feel like I'm using such a newbie microphone right now.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.160
I'm using the HyperX,

19:50.160 --> 19:54.160
and I don't know, I'm sure the quality is okay.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.160
But I want to get like a really professional one, yeah.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.160
Something expensive,

20:04.160 --> 20:06.160
something I can waste my money on.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.160
It sounds good.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.160
Yeah, I'm sure the quality is good,

20:08.160 --> 20:10.160
but I want something like,

20:10.160 --> 20:12.160
I want a big girl mic

20:12.160 --> 20:14.160
with lots of cords

20:16.160 --> 20:18.160
to tie you up with.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.160
Next, I want to,

20:20.160 --> 20:22.160
I want to be able to get a dishwasher

20:22.160 --> 20:25.160
and a washing machine

20:25.160 --> 20:27.160
and a dryer for clothes.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.160
I feel like these goals should be pretty realistic.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.160
I feel like I should be able to get these things.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.160
So, I'm so excited to tweet

20:37.160 --> 20:39.160
a picture of my new washing machine

20:39.160 --> 20:41.160
and to be like, guys!

20:41.160 --> 20:43.160
I got a washing machine!

20:44.160 --> 20:46.160
Wait, we're skipping number three?

20:46.160 --> 20:48.160
Oh, be mentally stable, yeah, that too.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.160
I want to do that too.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.160
Wait, what's she be stick?

20:55.160 --> 20:58.160
Do you live in a cardboard box?

20:58.160 --> 21:00.160
No, I live in an apartment,

21:00.160 --> 21:03.160
but it doesn't really have amenities

21:03.160 --> 21:05.160
because it's not really an apartment.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.160
Okay.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.160
All right.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.160
And the last one is not visible

21:14.160 --> 21:16.160
because the chat is covering it.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.160
I'll be able to afford your membership.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.160
I used to be really, really athletic,

21:24.160 --> 21:27.160
which is crazy to say because now I'm not.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.160
But I want to go back to those days.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.160
I mentioned before that I won a gymnastics award.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.160
Yeah, I used to like do gymnastics.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.160
I don't know if I'll ever go back,

21:39.160 --> 21:43.160
but I want to do something athletic

21:43.160 --> 21:45.160
because it was fun.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.160
Yeah, fat-shaming and chat?

21:47.160 --> 21:48.160
What?

21:48.160 --> 21:50.160
Who's fat-shaming and chat?

21:51.160 --> 21:55.160
The only one around here that's allowed to fat-shame is me.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.160
I'm kidding.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.160
I won't be fat-shaming anyone.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.160
Right.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.160
Next.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.160
What does Imi like under the shats?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.160
I don't know.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.160
Okay.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.160
Let me know if I'm being too rude too quickly.

22:11.160 --> 22:15.160
I don't know how quickly we want to advance here, but...

22:17.160 --> 22:20.160
Will there be some content on YouTube to a lesser extent?

22:21.160 --> 22:23.160
I have to consult Strani for that.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.160
I don't know what YouTube allows.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.160
I would get bonked all the time on YouTube in the past.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.160
I'm still getting bonked to this day on YouTube.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.160
Guys, guys, I...

22:34.160 --> 22:37.160
You know how YouTube is like removing ear-licking content

22:37.160 --> 22:40.160
and deleting people's channels for ear-licking content?

22:40.160 --> 22:42.160
But I still have ear-licking content up.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.160
I mean, what YouTube execs?

22:49.160 --> 22:51.160
No, I would never do ear-licking content.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.160
I don't do that.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.160
Wait, wait, wait.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.160
So in the...

22:59.160 --> 23:00.160
In the what?

23:00.160 --> 23:01.160
In the trailer,

23:01.160 --> 23:02.160
my voice line was like,

23:02.160 --> 23:05.160
what, you've never seen a masochistic bracket before?

23:05.160 --> 23:08.160
Which to me is kind of a silly trailer line,

23:08.160 --> 23:11.160
but Strani sent it to me and I was like, whatever, I'll do it.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.160
So yeah, here's all my masochistic tendencies.

23:18.160 --> 23:23.160
I won't go too in-depth, but I'm also a sadist.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.160
So anything you see here, like, fuck, it goes both ways, you know?

23:28.160 --> 23:30.160
What's Painplay? Exactly what it sounds like.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.160
If you don't know what Painplay is, then what are you doing here?

23:35.160 --> 23:38.160
Weren't you guys just in Shibi's chat? Shouldn't you know?

23:41.160 --> 23:43.160
Yeah, yandere?

23:44.160 --> 23:45.160
Okay.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.160
God, I really am covering everything, aren't I?

23:50.160 --> 23:52.160
I'm sorry for coughing in your ear.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.160
All right, so yandere, right.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.160
Okay, I know it's Mercy's job.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.160
I won't steal her job.

23:56.160 --> 24:00.160
I won't be like, Senpai, you're gonna fucking...

24:00.160 --> 24:02.160
You're gonna eat my ass tonight, right Senpai?

24:02.160 --> 24:03.160
Huh?

24:04.160 --> 24:07.160
I'll tie you down in my basement and force you to sit on you.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.160
No.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.160
I'm not gonna...

24:09.160 --> 24:10.160
Why am I so tiny now?

24:10.160 --> 24:11.160
I'm not gonna steal her thing, okay?

24:11.160 --> 24:12.160
That's her thing.

24:12.160 --> 24:20.160
But you wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me.

24:20.160 --> 24:29.160
Okay, I'm not a Swiftie, but I've been obsessed with that sort of content since seventh grade.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.160
You can't rip it out of me, okay?

24:35.160 --> 24:40.160
I consume an unhealthy amount of that sort of content.

24:40.160 --> 24:45.160
Someone was able to find all of the...

24:45.160 --> 24:49.160
All of the hentai I had put on my coffee table from my debut.

24:50.160 --> 25:01.160
Just from the really shitty Minecraft pixelated tiny little images I had put up.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.160
They found every single one.

25:03.160 --> 25:08.160
So if you wanna go into the debut comment section and read what I like,

25:08.160 --> 25:10.160
go ahead, but I can't say here probably.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.160
Yeah, yeah, I've been...

25:15.160 --> 25:16.160
I think...

25:16.160 --> 25:17.160
Oh fuck.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.160
I can't say how long I've been obsessed with it.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.160
I think I really did.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.160
Oh, whatever.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.160
I've been obsessed with it for way too long.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.160
Longer than some of you Zoomers might be alive for.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.160
Oh yeah, the red goo that comes out of your body.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.160
Peeling skin.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.160
Peeling skin is like really satisfying.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.160
I'm not a fucking hag.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.160
You'll be surprised I'm not a hag.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.160
We do have hags though if you want them.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.160
Yeah, peeling skin.

25:51.160 --> 25:55.160
Okay, my favorite thing about peeling skin.

25:55.160 --> 25:59.160
Not just on your lips, cause also on your lips and on my lips on...

26:01.160 --> 26:03.160
On your lips, from my lips, whatever.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.160
But also just in general like scabs.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.160
I really like to pick sc...

26:07.160 --> 26:08.160
Oh, I got a cough.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.160
Okay.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.160
Let me drink some water.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.160
Right.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.160
I really...

26:25.160 --> 26:31.160
My favorite thing ever is when you're peeling a scab and it makes like a ripping sound.

26:31.160 --> 26:36.160
I don't know if you've ever experienced that cause I'm sure none of you...

26:36.160 --> 26:39.160
I'm sure not everyone here likes to pick scabs.

26:39.160 --> 26:43.160
But I love it when you can hear the skin rip.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.160
That's my favorite thing ever.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.160
And also when you can feel the skin rip, but yeah.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.160
Or talking like dead skin?

26:51.160 --> 26:54.160
Well like, you know, when your lips are dry they start to peel.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.160
How big of a scab are you picking? Any fucking size.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.160
The bigger the better.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.160
It's audible? It is.

27:02.160 --> 27:05.160
If you get a big enough one.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.160
I like popping pim...

27:06.160 --> 27:07.160
Oh, there's a car outside.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.160
I like popping pimples too.

27:11.160 --> 27:17.160
That's satisfying too, but I feel like scabs are better cause they...

27:17.160 --> 27:18.160
They goo.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.160
They goo.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.160
They goo red.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.160
Spanking and chunking.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.160
I am a switch.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.160
I gotta move it for you.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.160
Imi does not read much hentai.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.160
I mostly read dirty books.

27:35.160 --> 27:39.160
But if you have a recommendation, I've been trying to read...

27:39.160 --> 27:41.160
Hold on, I gotta cough again.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.160
I'm a Nintendo switch.

27:54.160 --> 27:59.160
I've been trying to read at least one recommendation from...

28:00.160 --> 28:03.160
Cause a lot of you have been sending full on lists of a bunch of them.

28:03.160 --> 28:06.160
I can't read all of those.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.160
But I try to read one at least from each one.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.160
Any favorite tags?

28:16.160 --> 28:17.160
The ones here!

28:17.160 --> 28:18.160
These ones!

28:21.160 --> 28:23.160
My neighbors are being really loud downstairs.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
Genuine love and affection.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.160
Yeah, I just want someone to love me.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.160
That's my ultimate kink.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.160
Non...

28:33.160 --> 28:35.160
Complex.

28:35.160 --> 28:39.160
Also, anything you're into...

28:39.160 --> 28:42.160
If you presented the right way to me,

28:42.160 --> 28:45.160
then I'll probably be into it too.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.160
Yeah.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
Next slide.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.160
What does Imi not like under the shats?

28:54.160 --> 28:56.160
Right, right.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.160
Who loves the most degenerative kinks?

28:59.160 --> 29:00.160
I know.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.160
I know that's asking a lot.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.160
I know, I'm really freaky when it comes to that.

29:11.160 --> 29:16.160
Okay, so all of the below stuff I am fine with when it comes to fan art.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.160
This only pertains to elude marshmallows

29:19.160 --> 29:22.160
or just how we interact with each other in general.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
Right.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.160
I bet you like hand holding.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.160
Don't you, you little freak?

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
I hope you can't hear the dog barking.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.160
Let's not my dog either.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.160
Great.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.160
Death or necrophilia.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.160
I may have threatened to have...

29:48.160 --> 29:52.160
gex with your dead body in a past audio.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.160
But I'm not actually into it and please do not do...

29:56.160 --> 30:00.160
I mean, do not send any weird necrophilia stuff to me.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.160
I know, I know we're freaky here,

30:02.160 --> 30:04.160
but let's not go that far, okay?

30:06.160 --> 30:08.160
Let's not go that far.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.160
Right, I'm all about love.

30:15.160 --> 30:20.160
So I'm uncomfortable with any sort of pain play stuff if it's not loving.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.160
Because, you know, I'm just freaky like that.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.160
It's got to be loving.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.160
Do not fuck the dead body.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.160
Actually, right, right, right.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.160
Okay, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.160
I really like cutesy stuff.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.160
Or like...

30:39.160 --> 30:41.160
Or like...

30:42.160 --> 30:44.160
You mean freak?

30:46.160 --> 30:48.160
You guys are so funny.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.160
Okay, I'm like, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.

30:51.160 --> 30:54.160
Or like, I didn't know that touching a peepee makes it...

30:56.160 --> 30:58.160
But I don't go Google Gaga.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.160
I don't go into that territory, so...

31:00.160 --> 31:01.160
Go to AC.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.160
Yeah, if you're into that, she will...

31:03.160 --> 31:05.160
She will satisfy you.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.160
And the same thing with the OG-san?

31:11.160 --> 31:12.160
The same thing with the OG-san?

31:12.160 --> 31:15.160
If you don't know, OG-san means like uncle, I guess?

31:15.160 --> 31:17.160
Or maybe like old man?

31:18.160 --> 31:20.160
I'm not really into that either.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.160
So also, yeah, old dudes.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.160
So you can also...

31:26.160 --> 31:28.160
Go to AC for that too.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.160
Because that's her shtick, you know?

31:30.160 --> 31:32.160
Fat older uncle.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.160
Yeah, that's not for me.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.160
Oh, what's the last one?

31:40.160 --> 31:42.160
Alright, the last one is...

31:43.160 --> 31:45.160
Extreme body play stuff, yeah.

31:45.160 --> 31:48.160
Don't fill my tits up with saline solution

31:48.160 --> 31:50.160
and then jump on them to make them pop, okay?

31:50.160 --> 31:51.160
Okay.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.160
And then I won't fill your balls up with saline solution

31:53.160 --> 31:55.160
and then jump on them to make them pop.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.160
It's a mutual agreement there, okay?

31:57.160 --> 31:58.160
Okay.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.160
You need to rest?

32:01.160 --> 32:03.160
It's okay, it's okay.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.160
I'm usually not really sick.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.160
I don't know...

32:07.160 --> 32:09.160
I don't know who I am today.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.160
But I'm okay.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.160
It's really just my throat.

32:12.160 --> 32:16.160
And like my coughing's been acting up.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.160
Oh no, chat fucking broke on me!

32:19.160 --> 32:21.160
Shit!

32:21.160 --> 32:23.160
Oh no, how am I supposed to look at chat?

32:25.160 --> 32:26.160
How am I supposed to read chat?

32:26.160 --> 32:29.160
Okay, let me open my own stream.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.160
Because my chat froze!

32:37.160 --> 32:39.160
Are you kidding me?

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
Alright.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.160
I will read chat from a tiny window from YouTube.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.160
Okay?

32:50.160 --> 32:51.160
Okay.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.160
What's next?

32:55.160 --> 32:58.160
Let me adjust it because now I have to change my windows around

32:58.160 --> 33:00.160
because my freaking chat froze.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.160
Alright.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.160
I will not pop your balls for you.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.160
No, I'm sorry.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.160
Maybe she will.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.160
If you're into that, I don't know.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.160
Here, let me even just close chat.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.160
Or maybe if I close and then open it again.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.160
It works!

33:24.160 --> 33:25.160
Oh, okay, okay.

33:25.160 --> 33:28.160
I don't have to have the whole YouTube tab open.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.160
Alright.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.160
Pop them like boba?

33:33.160 --> 33:35.160
Chew on them like boba balls?

33:37.160 --> 33:38.160
Yeah, next.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.160
Alright, music stuff.

33:39.160 --> 33:44.160
I didn't mention my music taste in my debut, so I can mention it now.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.160
So, I wrote this when I was like...

33:48.160 --> 33:51.160
It was like 2am last night when I made this slide, so...

33:52.160 --> 33:55.160
I don't know why I said I don't have favorite genres.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.160
I do have favorite genres.

34:02.160 --> 34:07.160
I like Korean pop and Japanese pop and like...

34:10.160 --> 34:11.160
Vocaloids.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.160
I like vocal aids, too.

34:15.160 --> 34:16.160
Yeah.

34:18.160 --> 34:21.160
I'm not into making music or anything.

34:24.160 --> 34:29.160
I don't have a goal of producing an original song or anything.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.160
I mean, if it comes to that...

34:32.160 --> 34:36.160
Sure, I don't know if I can do it, but it's not a goal of mine.

34:37.160 --> 34:41.160
I'm not really passionate about making music or any of that.

34:41.160 --> 34:46.160
But yeah, I put my current favorite songs here so you can listen to them if you want.

34:46.160 --> 34:48.160
I'm kind of a normie and I apologize if you don't like it.

34:48.160 --> 34:52.160
It's not like I'm going to be bothering you with my song choices.

34:55.160 --> 34:58.160
You gifted some fun stuff on Throne. I can't wait to hear it be used.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.160
Dirty.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.160
Shame him.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.160
Oh my god.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.160
What a pervert.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.160
Not on this Christian website, youtube.com.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.160
Mods.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.160
Hang him by his balls and twist him around.

35:14.160 --> 35:18.160
Yeah, I like Takayan. I like Metsuki. I like Romani Martinez.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.160
I recently found out about What's-A-Heart.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.160
I don't know how popular they are.

35:25.160 --> 35:29.160
Yeah, and fuck, now I have to actually show it.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.160
And then there's the last one.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.160
Don't even worry about that.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.160
Or I like some dislikes.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.160
I didn't mention this in my debut either, so let's talk about it here.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.160
I like rats, obviously.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.160
I like rats.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.160
Yeah.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.160
I like pink and cute things.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.160
My whole room is pink.

35:55.160 --> 35:58.160
And my whole room is covered in cute things.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.160
Yeah, I like cute stuffed animals.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.160
I like cute clothes, like Hawaii fashion.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.160
I think I season to that too, like Hawaii fashion.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.160
She sent pictures of her outfits and I was like,

36:10.160 --> 36:12.160
She's like my twin, she's so cute.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.160
I'm sorry if there's any Koreans in chat.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.160
I don't think I'm pronouncing it right.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.160
But it's basically just...

36:26.160 --> 36:27.160
It's like race cakes.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.160
And I like it with...

36:29.160 --> 36:34.160
I like it with like cheesy sauce and stuff and like spicy...

36:35.160 --> 36:36.160
I like it when it's spicy.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.160
I don't know the brand I've been eating.

36:43.160 --> 36:47.160
Let me try to look up the brand because I've been eating this one brand.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.160
I've been eating this one brand like over and over again.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.160
It's like the only...

36:52.160 --> 36:53.160
Oh, fuck wrong tab.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.160
It's like the only thing I've been eating lately.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.160
I think it was spicy chicken.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.160
Wait, what brand is that?

37:09.160 --> 37:10.160
Bulldog, bulldog.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.160
That one, the pink one.

37:13.160 --> 37:14.160
It's really good.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.160
That's right.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.160
Korean perfect pronunciation?

37:18.160 --> 37:19.160
I feel like that's a lie.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.160
Do you want to pick on each hand scabs?

37:24.160 --> 37:25.160
Yes?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.160
Scab picking stream?

37:28.160 --> 37:30.160
No, I don't think that's allowed.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.160
Yeah, bulldog.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.160
I like those.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.160
I think a...

37:39.160 --> 37:41.160
Mukbang stream would be fun.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.160
It's going to have a lot of...

37:43.160 --> 37:44.160
Maybe it could be an ASMR stream.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.160
It's going to have a lot of wet noises.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.160
Eating on each hand scabs.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.160
I don't...

37:52.160 --> 37:53.160
Okay, I don't like to eat this.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.160
Let it be known here.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.160
I don't like to eat the scab skin.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.160
I only like to eat the lip skin, okay?

38:01.160 --> 38:03.160
I feel like scab skin is kind of gross.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.160
I only like the lip skin, okay?

38:06.160 --> 38:07.160
Okay.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.160
Not auto cannibalism.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.160
Well, I guess a little bit of auto cannibalism,

38:15.160 --> 38:16.160
but also other people cannibalism.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.160
Regular cannibalism.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.160
Dislikes, dislikes, right?

38:21.160 --> 38:23.160
I don't like to interact with real humans.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.160
When I had like a real person job,

38:27.160 --> 38:30.160
and not an anime girl on the internet job,

38:30.160 --> 38:32.160
it was so awful.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.160
People are so mean.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.160
I don't like to talk to them.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.160
So now I just spend a lot of time not doing that.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.160
Okay.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.160
She is into that shit.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.160
Well, you know what?

38:52.160 --> 38:54.160
If people are into scab eating,

38:54.160 --> 38:55.160
I'm not gonna king shame them,

38:55.160 --> 38:56.160
but I'm just not into it.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.160
Do you like to pop zits?

38:57.160 --> 38:58.160
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

38:58.160 --> 39:01.160
Let me sit on your back and pop all your back knee.

39:02.160 --> 39:04.160
That's quality time for me.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.160
Okay.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.160
I don't like people who can sing good

39:11.160 --> 39:13.160
because I'm jealous of them.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.160
I don't like heat.

39:15.160 --> 39:19.160
I don't like being hot or moisture.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.160
I do like to watch Dr. Pimple Popper.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
Yes.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.160
I don't like bugs trying to crawl in my ear.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.160
And I have this really specific fear

39:33.160 --> 39:36.160
of bugs crawling in my ear because one time

39:36.160 --> 39:39.160
when I was sleeping, I was really young.

39:39.160 --> 39:42.160
And why is my model?

39:42.160 --> 39:44.160
I was really young and I was just sleeping.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.160
And all of a sudden I felt like

39:46.160 --> 39:48.160
something go inside my ear.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.160
Like I felt a buzzing near my ear

39:50.160 --> 39:53.160
and then I literally felt penetration in my ear.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.160
Like something like crawled into my ear

39:55.160 --> 39:57.160
and I woke up as fast as I could

39:57.160 --> 39:59.160
and I like, you know, put my fingers up to my ear

39:59.160 --> 40:01.160
to see like what the fuck is going on in there.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.160
And I couldn't get anything.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.160
Like there was, it felt like nothing was there.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.160
So I don't, I don't know if I just have

40:07.160 --> 40:10.160
like a dead bug in my ear since, since I was a child.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.160
But now I'm just really, really scared of bugs

40:12.160 --> 40:14.160
crawling into my ear because I don't know if,

40:14.160 --> 40:16.160
I don't know if that was a dream.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.160
I don't know if it's real,

40:18.160 --> 40:20.160
but it felt really real and I hated it.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.160
So yeah.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.160
Next is people who are smart

40:26.160 --> 40:28.160
because I'm jealous because I'm stupid.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.160
Sleep with earplugs.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.160
That's smart, but also I feel like

40:33.160 --> 40:35.160
the earplugs are going to get dirty really quickly

40:35.160 --> 40:38.160
and I'm too lazy to clean those.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.160
Me being piloted by a bug like Ratatouille.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.160
That fly that flew into my ear

40:45.160 --> 40:47.160
has just been controlling my brain.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.160
Okay.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.160
And then finally,

40:53.160 --> 40:55.160
other streamers you watch because I'm jealous.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.160
Don't bring them up in my chat because I will cry.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.160
Hold on, what's the next?

41:01.160 --> 41:03.160
I'm kind of worried about what the next.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.160
Oh shit, okay.

41:05.160 --> 41:08.160
The next one is also, the next slide

41:08.160 --> 41:09.160
is also common knowledge,

41:09.160 --> 41:11.160
but I'm going to say it again

41:11.160 --> 41:14.160
because I know a lot of people, you know,

41:14.160 --> 41:15.160
we just met each other.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.160
A lot of people, you know, don't know me.

41:18.160 --> 41:23.160
So I'm going to give you an important note here.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.160
Right?

41:24.160 --> 41:25.160
Okay, here we go.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.160
So,

41:28.160 --> 41:31.160
I want to bring up right now to warn people

41:31.160 --> 41:34.160
who want me to stay in the little sister character

41:34.160 --> 41:35.160
at all times.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.160
I can't.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.160
Uh oh.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.160
And he thinks her voice,

41:41.160 --> 41:43.160
she's a fucking broadcastle that bitch.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.160
She's a little liar.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.160
Okay, yeah.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.160
So it's true.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.160
I am the only one in viewer who fix her voice.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.160
All the other girls do use their natural voice on stream.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.160
Even if you think like, oh, she's trying so hard.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.160
She's trying so hard to sound mommy

41:56.160 --> 41:57.160
or she's trying to,

41:57.160 --> 42:00.160
she's trying to so hard to sound lolly.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.160
They're not.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.160
I've been in voice calls with these girls.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.160
They all genuinely sound like that.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.160
They all genuinely sound that sexy and hot

42:09.160 --> 42:12.160
and cute and pretty naturally, right?

42:12.160 --> 42:13.160
Except for me.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.160
Except for me.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.160
Okay, yeah.

42:17.160 --> 42:20.160
So I don't know how others do lolly voice 24-7.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.160
Maybe they're born with it.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.160
Like I see.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
Or,

42:25.160 --> 42:26.160
yeah.

42:26.160 --> 42:28.160
But your little sister's a fake bitch.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.160
So when she's sick

42:30.160 --> 42:33.160
or maybe during longer streams like Donathons,

42:33.160 --> 42:37.160
big sister in me will come out to play and torment you.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.160
So yeah.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.160
Let me move it.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.160
Okay, there we go.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.160
And there's my little drawing.

42:45.160 --> 42:47.160
I'm sorry if that disappoints anyone,

42:47.160 --> 42:49.160
but I hope you can still like me anyways

42:49.160 --> 42:53.160
and I hope you can put up with dummy sister in me.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.160
You get a full package with me.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.160
You get little sister and older sister.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
Okay, that's it.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.160
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

43:05.160 --> 43:07.160
Okay, so I can go through.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.160
Only, and it's only been 43 minutes.

43:10.160 --> 43:13.160
So I can go through safer work marshmallow questions.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.160
Or we can do chat questions.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.160
So, oh, I got a burp.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.160
Don't hold back.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.160
Yeah, ask me your most,

43:26.160 --> 43:29.160
your moist burning questions.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.160
Don't worry about whether or not

43:32.160 --> 43:34.160
management would want me to talk about it.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.160
Just ask it to me.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.160
Yeah, they're not here.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.160
It's just us.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.160
It's just me and you, poopy.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.160
Or we can just talk about like your own interests.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.160
I don't know.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.160
We can get to know each other if you want.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.160
So I think first what I'll do

43:46.160 --> 43:49.160
is go back to the chatting screen.

43:51.160 --> 43:55.160
And nine out of 10, thank you.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.160
And I want to open marshmallow.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.160
And any questions you have,

44:01.160 --> 44:03.160
I will look through those first

44:03.160 --> 44:05.160
and then I will go through chat questions.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.160
Okay.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.160
What color is your panties?

44:09.160 --> 44:10.160
Okay, I'll answer that one

44:10.160 --> 44:11.160
because it's mercy.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.160
They're light blue.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.160
Okay.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.160
Let me open marshmallow.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.160
I think I should be able to show it

44:22.160 --> 44:23.160
if I'm careful.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.160
If I'm careful.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.160
Okay.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.160
I'm going to refresh it.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.160
Okay.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.160
It's good to have you back, lad.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.160
Good luck on your future clothes and stuff.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.160
This is what you've been up to the whole time.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.160
Yup.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.160
Any book recommendations?

44:48.160 --> 44:51.160
Can I show the...

44:52.160 --> 44:55.160
Let me try to show the marshmallow question.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.160
So that way...

45:00.160 --> 45:01.160
Oh!

45:03.160 --> 45:04.160
Oh!

45:04.160 --> 45:06.160
Well, there's my OBS.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.160
There's...

45:09.160 --> 45:10.160
Docs myself.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.160
I hope not. Okay.

45:21.160 --> 45:23.160
Here's a marshmallow question.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.160
Okay, I'll put it right on chat.

45:26.160 --> 45:29.160
Any recommendations for books instead of dojins?

45:29.160 --> 45:30.160
Right.

45:31.160 --> 45:33.160
All of the books I've read will get me canceled

45:33.160 --> 45:34.160
if I say them,

45:34.160 --> 45:38.160
but I guess I'm probably going to get canceled anyways.

45:38.160 --> 45:40.160
So...

45:40.160 --> 45:41.160
The problem is...

45:41.160 --> 45:42.160
She uses...

45:42.160 --> 45:44.160
Guys, she uses OBS.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.160
Fight your IP address right now.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.160
Go to her house.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.160
So, like, all of the books I've read

45:54.160 --> 45:56.160
have been mostly, like,

45:56.160 --> 45:58.160
female, like,

45:58.160 --> 45:59.160
orientated...

45:59.160 --> 46:00.160
Oriented?

46:00.160 --> 46:02.160
So if I tell you, like,

46:02.160 --> 46:05.160
you might not enjoy it because you're a dude.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.160
But I will tell you my all-time favorite.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.160
But let me look it up first

46:10.160 --> 46:12.160
because I forgot the name.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.160
It is really problematic.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.160
But, you know,

46:22.160 --> 46:24.160
we're here today, so whatever.

46:24.160 --> 46:28.160
It's Take Me With You by Nina G. Jones.

46:29.160 --> 46:31.160
That one...

46:32.160 --> 46:34.160
Okay, I might be really bad.

46:34.160 --> 46:36.160
I haven't read it in a long time,

46:36.160 --> 46:37.160
but it was the first...

46:37.160 --> 46:38.160
It was the one I read that I was like,

46:38.160 --> 46:40.160
ah, that's good.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.160
So, I don't know.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.160
Okay, next question.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.160
Have you seen One Piece or Dragon Ball?

46:47.160 --> 46:49.160
I started Dragon Ball,

46:50.160 --> 46:52.160
but I didn't really care about it.

46:52.160 --> 46:53.160
So yeah.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.160
Considering the pin

46:57.160 --> 46:59.160
and button aesthetics on your designs,

46:59.160 --> 47:00.160
are you a fan of Coraline?

47:00.160 --> 47:03.160
Okay, we didn't design our characters at all.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.160
I also didn't apply to be in me,

47:05.160 --> 47:06.160
so I didn't design anything,

47:06.160 --> 47:07.160
but I do like Coraline.

47:07.160 --> 47:09.160
It's a really good movie.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.160
I really, really like it.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.160
I watched it a lot on repeat.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.160
When I was a kid, it really scared me.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.160
I'm sure it scared a lot of kids,

47:16.160 --> 47:18.160
but yeah, I like Coraline.

47:25.160 --> 47:27.160
I saw you played League,

47:27.160 --> 47:29.160
and I started wondering what rank is.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.160
What your rank is.

47:30.160 --> 47:34.160
Okay, I had League on my...

47:37.160 --> 47:40.160
I had League on my like,

47:41.160 --> 47:45.160
Steam library during debut.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.160
I don't play League.

47:47.160 --> 47:50.160
I've played League like maybe a total of five times.

47:50.160 --> 47:52.160
I don't even know if I have a rank.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.160
That's how much I don't know anything about League.

47:56.160 --> 48:00.160
I've only really learned how to play Yumi,

48:01.160 --> 48:03.160
and I don't know any of the other characters,

48:03.160 --> 48:05.160
and I don't know how to play any of the other characters.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.160
Like, I'm not really a League player.

48:07.160 --> 48:08.160
I don't...

48:08.160 --> 48:11.160
I'm sorry to maybe disappoint you,

48:11.160 --> 48:14.160
or also to make you happy,

48:14.160 --> 48:16.160
because a lot of people don't like League.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.160
I don't know.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.160
But I thought it would be a funny game to like,

48:20.160 --> 48:22.160
have chat teach me how to play,

48:22.160 --> 48:24.160
but you know, if you guys don't like it,

48:24.160 --> 48:25.160
we don't have to play.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.160
It's not that deep, you know?

48:26.160 --> 48:27.160
Oh no, Yumi.

48:27.160 --> 48:30.160
Guys, like I said, I haven't played League at all.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.160
Like, don't start freaking out.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.160
Don't start freaking out. It's okay.

48:37.160 --> 48:40.160
If you guys get a fans League account, will it be free?

48:40.160 --> 48:42.160
I think Strani already mentioned that, but yeah.

48:42.160 --> 48:43.160
Yeah.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.160
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.

48:45.160 --> 48:46.160
Um...

48:47.160 --> 48:49.160
So if you have, like, fans League questions,

48:49.160 --> 48:50.160
please direct them to Strani,

48:50.160 --> 48:52.160
because I've never used fans League before,

48:52.160 --> 48:53.160
so I don't know.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.160
Will you groom us?

48:59.160 --> 49:00.160
Yes.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.160
Um...

49:03.160 --> 49:04.160
Ooh.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.160
Well, this isn't interesting.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.160
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.160
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.160
Well, this is an interesting question.

49:12.160 --> 49:14.160
I barely even read it before showing it to you.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.160
Do you feel like there are equal parts of you

49:16.160 --> 49:18.160
in Yumi as Liberty?

49:19.160 --> 49:21.160
Are there things you're excited to do as Yumi

49:21.160 --> 49:22.160
that you couldn't do before?

49:22.160 --> 49:25.160
I could do anything I wanted as Liberty before.

49:25.160 --> 49:28.160
I just chose not to, you know?

49:30.160 --> 49:31.160
Um...

49:31.160 --> 49:33.160
Equal parts of you in Yumi...

49:34.160 --> 49:35.160
Equal parts of me.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.160
I don't know what that means.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.160
Um...

49:46.160 --> 49:47.160
I...

49:50.160 --> 49:53.160
How do we congregate together outside of streams?

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
Right.

49:54.160 --> 49:56.160
There's a fan Discord,

49:56.160 --> 49:58.160
but I'm not in it, so we can't.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.160
Um...

50:00.160 --> 50:04.160
Once I announce that my PL is PL,

50:04.160 --> 50:07.160
you're free to go in my old Discord server.

50:07.160 --> 50:09.160
I'm also not in that one.

50:09.160 --> 50:12.160
So you cannot congregate with me outside of streams

50:12.160 --> 50:14.160
other than, like, pre-chat.

50:15.160 --> 50:18.160
But you can congregate with other fans outside of streams.

50:18.160 --> 50:20.160
There's a fan Discord out there on Twitter.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.160
I think you can search for

50:22.160 --> 50:25.160
Feeler Community Server or something.

50:26.160 --> 50:28.160
But we will not have our own...

50:28.160 --> 50:30.160
Is the chat behind Frozen?

50:30.160 --> 50:31.160
I don't know.

50:31.160 --> 50:34.160
We will not have our own, like, Discord server

50:34.160 --> 50:36.160
with us in it, you know?

50:39.160 --> 50:40.160
Yeah.

50:40.160 --> 50:42.160
Also, this question, I'm not quite sure

50:42.160 --> 50:44.160
what you mean by that,

50:44.160 --> 50:47.160
so I don't know if I can answer it.

50:47.160 --> 50:50.160
I do feel like the character's cute.

50:50.160 --> 50:52.160
I like her.

50:52.160 --> 50:54.160
Um, did I expect to get her?

50:54.160 --> 50:55.160
No, not at all.

50:55.160 --> 50:56.160
But yeah, I like her.

50:56.160 --> 50:57.160
I think she's cute.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.160
I'm cute.

50:59.160 --> 51:02.160
Do you feel like Yumi is just as big

51:02.160 --> 51:04.160
of a part of her as Liberty?

51:04.160 --> 51:06.160
Yes, of course. Of course. Of course.

51:10.160 --> 51:15.160
Oh, have you picked up any recent shows?

51:15.160 --> 51:20.160
I am just about finished watching

51:20.160 --> 51:22.160
to your eternity.

51:22.160 --> 51:24.160
It was really, really good.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.160
It was so cute and sad.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.160
I literally cried, like, every five episodes.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.160
I still have to finish watching,

51:30.160 --> 51:33.160
like, maybe the last two episodes or something.

51:34.160 --> 51:37.160
Um, but, yeah.

51:37.160 --> 51:38.160
Yeah.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.160
It was really good.

51:39.160 --> 51:40.160
I really recommend that anime.

51:40.160 --> 51:41.160
It's so sad.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.160
It made me cry so much.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.160
Even thinking about it now, I'm crying.

51:45.160 --> 51:47.160
I'm literally tearing up thinking about it.

51:47.160 --> 51:48.160
Oh, my God.

51:49.160 --> 51:51.160
Fuck that anime.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.160
Okay, okay, okay.

52:02.160 --> 52:05.160
Okay, this is an interesting question.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.160
I'm literally wiping away my fucking tears

52:09.160 --> 52:10.160
because it made me cry.

52:10.160 --> 52:11.160
Thinking about the anime.

52:13.160 --> 52:14.160
Have you watched Steins' Gate?

52:14.160 --> 52:15.160
No.

52:18.160 --> 52:19.160
In your lore video,

52:19.160 --> 52:22.160
was that an alternate from Mandela catalog?

52:22.160 --> 52:25.160
Do you also like other analogue horror

52:25.160 --> 52:26.160
or horror in general?

52:26.160 --> 52:27.160
Wait, okay.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.160
We did not come up with our lore.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.160
We had no part.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.160
Oh, my God.

52:32.160 --> 52:33.160
My neighbors are yelling downstairs.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.160
I'm sorry.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.160
We had no part in any of the lore, right?

52:38.160 --> 52:39.160
So, no.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.160
I don't know anything about that.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.160
Apologies.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.160
I do horror stuff, though.

52:47.160 --> 52:49.160
Can we get a taste of your real voice?

52:49.160 --> 52:50.160
Oh, my God.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.160
You can go look that up yourself.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.160
That's so easy to find.

52:56.160 --> 52:57.160
That's really easy to find.

52:58.160 --> 53:00.160
You can find my vods very, very easily.

53:00.160 --> 53:02.160
I'm trying to go back to the old questions.

53:05.160 --> 53:07.160
Oh, I think this is an important question.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.160
Our future schedule is going to be around the same hour,

53:10.160 --> 53:12.160
or are you planning to shift to earlier or later?

53:13.160 --> 53:16.160
For now, I think I will keep it at this time.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.160
I have to cough.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.160
Okay.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.160
For now it will stay here.

53:36.160 --> 53:40.160
I really want to do gorilla streams earlier in the day.

53:40.160 --> 53:42.160
I think that would be fun.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.160
But regularly...

53:47.160 --> 53:48.160
Earlier in the day.

53:48.160 --> 53:49.160
Hours before this one.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.160
For the future.

53:52.160 --> 53:53.160
For the future.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.160
For the future.

53:55.160 --> 53:59.220
Like, hours before this one

53:59.220 --> 54:03.980
For any European viewers

54:03.980 --> 54:09.820
For now, regularly scheduled streams will be at this time

57:12.840 --> 57:14.840
You can tell there's a really big difference between the names.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.840
Do you read any visual novels?

57:29.840 --> 57:32.840
Hmmmmm...

57:39.840 --> 57:41.840
Is... oh, there's one I'm thinking of right now.

57:44.840 --> 57:46.840
I forgot the name.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.840
I read a little bit. I read a little bit, but...

57:50.840 --> 57:57.840
I mostly read, like, manga where I started the anime, and then they stopped, like,

57:57.840 --> 58:01.840
you know, they took a break from making it for, you know, like, the next season and stuff.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.840
Like, I've read most of the New Freerun chapters.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.840
Like, I read manga more than I read visual novels, I feel like.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.840
So, yeah.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.840
Yeah.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.840
Oh, oh, I'm gonna disappoint you guys with this question.

58:14.840 --> 58:17.840
Have you watched Toradora Feelings on Romance Anime?

58:17.840 --> 58:20.840
I have not watched Toradora. I know. Disappointment. Oh my god.

58:21.840 --> 58:24.840
Esteban is a weird name for a female rat.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.840
I got it from... I got it from The Office.

58:28.840 --> 58:33.840
Um, I have not watched Toradora and Feelings on Romance Anime.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.840
This is probably why I haven't watched Toradora.

58:35.840 --> 58:38.840
I don't like romance anime.

58:39.840 --> 58:43.840
Like, as much as I love, like, yeah, didn't stuff.

58:43.840 --> 58:48.840
As kinky as I am for liking love, I don't actually like romance anime.

58:48.840 --> 58:54.840
So, I tend to stay away from a lot of romance anime.

58:54.840 --> 58:55.840
Yeah.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.840
I have not watched Violet...

58:57.840 --> 59:00.840
I tried watching Violet Evergarden, but I got bored.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.840
I'm super, super picky when it comes to anime. I apologize.

59:08.840 --> 59:10.840
This question is so fucking funny.

59:12.840 --> 59:16.840
Every trade, sweet, cuckoo, date a cuckoo.

59:19.840 --> 59:22.840
Have you ever dated a cuckoo?

59:25.840 --> 59:27.840
I guess we know who the cuck is.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.840
Point and laugh at the cuck.

59:30.840 --> 59:31.840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

59:31.840 --> 59:33.840
Actually, no, if you're a cuckoo, you should enjoy it.

59:33.840 --> 59:35.840
You should enjoy the humiliation.

59:37.840 --> 59:38.840
Right, um...

59:42.840 --> 59:43.840
I'm sorry?

59:44.840 --> 59:45.840
No.

59:45.840 --> 59:46.840
Um...

59:47.840 --> 59:48.840
No.

59:48.840 --> 59:49.840
But...

59:49.840 --> 59:51.840
Thoughts on the Polly thing?

59:51.840 --> 59:53.840
I've said before, I want two boyfriends.

59:53.840 --> 59:56.840
I want to dress them up like Barbie dolls, like twin Barbie dolls,

59:56.840 --> 59:58.840
and I want to make them kiss.

59:58.840 --> 59:59.840
And I want to watch them...

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.840
I want to watch them kissing.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.840
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.840
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.840
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840
There's so many questions.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840
Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840
I feel like I've already answered that one.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.840
How do you want your fan groups to interact?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840
Interact.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.840
Talk to each other.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.840
I don't know.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.840
But I understand if they don't want to,

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.840
because I know the content is different.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.840
I'm not going to be disappointed if everyone from the past is like,

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.840
fuck this, I'm not coming.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.840
I understand, I understand.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.840
If you don't want to be here, because the content is different,

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.840
I understand and that's okay.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.840
So it's really...

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.840
I like you guys to get along,

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.840
but also if you don't, that's okay.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.840
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840
Oh my god.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.840
How many rats total have you raised in your life?

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.840
God, these questions are so boring.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.840
I'm so sorry to anyone who thought I would be entertaining today.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.840
Not because your questions are boring,

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840
but like my answers are boring.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840
Okay, okay.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.840
I raised... raised.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.840
I don't think I raised, but I've had...

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840
Six.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
Six?

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
Seven.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840
Six or seven.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840
Hold on.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840
Let me count them.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840
So my first two were...

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.840
My first two were Pikachu and Mudkip.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.840
And then after that...

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.840
After that, I also...

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.840
After Pikachu died,

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.840
you're going to hear a lot about rat deaths.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.840
They die really fast.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.840
So after Pikachu died, I got three more.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.840
I got crackers, I got Esteban, and I got Dennis.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.840
My neighbors are having sex downstairs,

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.840
and I can hear it very clearly right now.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.840
I can hear them moaning and also the bed creaking,

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.840
and it's making me a little bit uncomfortable.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.840
Is the marble my neighbors have sex downstairs?

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.840
Um, yeah, right.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
Pikachu?

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.840
Pikachu and Mudkip.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.840
Crackers.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.840
Dennis.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.840
Esteban.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840
Pixie Luna.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840
That makes seven.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840
Yeah, that makes seven.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.840
Clap for him.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.840
Cheer them on.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.840
I do have thin floors and thin walls.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.840
Yeah, that's why I want to move.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.840
Tribute raiding stream?

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.840
What?

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.840
Tribute raiding stream?

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.840
What?

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.840
Never, bros.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.840
No.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.840
Is it illegal or otherwise not liked to talk about

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.840
or ask about previous online identities

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.840
with you or the other viewer, bros?

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840
So me, I'm comfortable with it,

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.840
but also don't bring it up too much,

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840
because we're here now today.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.840
Let's be in the present, you know?

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.840
Let's be...

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.840
I should probably show that question.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.840
Let's be in the present together, you know?

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.840
But obviously, it's the other viewer girls' choices.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.840
I'm not going to talk about it,

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.840
like for them,

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840
like in terms of them,

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.840
like I'm not going to tell you,

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840
but if they want to talk about it,

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.840
you know, is their choice.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.840
I'm just happy that viewer let us talk about it,

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:50.840
because I miss the people that supported me from the start.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.840
I really appreciate them,

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.840
but I also appreciate any new people

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.840
that are also coming in and saying hi

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.840
and giving me a chance.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.840
Okay, now I'm getting to the inappropriate ones.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840
Let me scroll back up.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.840
Okay, are you sure I'm not showing those?

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.840
Oh my god, they're being so fucking loud right now.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.840
Holy shit.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840
Here, let me...

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840
I should probably...

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.840
You talked about being self-conscious about your real voice.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840
I went and checked,

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.840
and it could still be a little sister.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.840
Lies.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840
You're gassing me up.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.840
You're sucking my cock so hard right now.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.840
Okay, I guess I'll get into the actual spicy question.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840
Not spicy, but like...

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840
Okay, where are they?

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.840
Oh, what do you plan to do on Fancy?

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.840
Okay, well, I do want to play like,

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.840
you know, the dating sims.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.840
I think those would be fun.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.840
Yeah, look at my throne.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.840
Yeah, look at my throne if you want to know

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.840
what I plan to do on Fancy.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.840
Mom, louder!

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.840
Is there your dominance?

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.840
You guys are so funny.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.840
I guess I should probably talk about this too.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.840
Okay, since you weren't able to choose your character,

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.840
how do you feel about lolly characters and lolly culture in general?

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.840
So, I have drawn...

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.840
Like, I've been drawing...

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.840
I guess I didn't really know at the time.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.840
When I first started drawing,

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.840
I was like, only drawing lollies.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.840
And also furries.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.840
I was drawing lollies with furries.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.840
And I didn't really care.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.840
Like, I wasn't like,

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.840
oh yeah, shit's hot.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.840
But I also wasn't like totally against it.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.840
There were times where I found some stuff to be a little questionable.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.840
But I know what I'm comfortable with personally.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.840
And I will...

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.840
I wouldn't be here if in the present moment,

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.840
you know, I wasn't comfortable with it.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.840
And I'm obviously not going to do anything,

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.840
but I'm not comfortable with it.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.840
Um...

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.840
Yeah, in terms of like...

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.840
Like, I am not immersed in the culture.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840
There's a culture.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.840
I'm very new to this.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840
I'm very, very new to this.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840
Like, other than drawing them,

01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840
I don't...

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.840
I haven't...

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.840
I'm not in the culture.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.840
So, I hope you can accept me as...

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840
I don't fucking know part of the family.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.840
Brother?

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840
I don't know.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.840
Yeah, hopefully no one's disappointed that I'm like new to this or anything.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.840
I don't know.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.840
We're being real right now.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.840
Yeah, no one's asking any like crazy questions.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840
I thought you were going to ask me like...

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.840
I don't fucking know like...

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.840
How far can you squirt or something?

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.840
Okay, I can go to chat questions now, I guess,

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.840
for anyone that doesn't have marshmallow,

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.840
or doesn't want to use it.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840
So...

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.840
Okay.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.840
We'll educate you.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Thank you, thank you.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.840
That's why I said like send me your recommendations for like,

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.840
you know, literature, quality, you know,

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.840
literature because I haven't read them.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.840
So, how far?

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840
How far?

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840
Probably only like...

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840
Ah, I want to say like...

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.840
Maybe like a little 40 centimeters?

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840
Not far.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.840
Not far.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.840
Oh shit, chat just fucking broke for me again.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.840
No, no, no, we're good.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.840
What are your thoughts on fashion?

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840
What do you mean fashion?

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.840
Not 47, just 40, 40, 40, 40, 40.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.840
Don't get your hopes up now.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.840
Is that impressive?

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.840
Can we talk about this?

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840
I'm very, very not...

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.840
I'm very, very unfamiliar with like YouTube rules.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.840
If I get bonked on YouTube, I apologize.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.840
How do we use marshmallow?

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840
It's the link in the description,

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.840
and you just type your thing and you send it,

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.840
and you can use like a translator

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.840
on like a Google Chrome extension translator

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.840
because the website isn't in Japanese.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.840
Would you rather be inflated with liquid like water

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.840
or juice or with gas like air?

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840
Inflation, okay.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.840
Okay, let me think about it critically here.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.840
If I had to choose, I feel like...

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:27.840
Juice is a bad idea.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.840
I feel like juice is asking to get some kind of infection

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840
inside of my body.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.840
So, I'm going to say...

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.840
I'm going to say whatever is the safest,

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.840
so either water or air, yeah.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.840
Or if I could choose probably none of them.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:53.840
My chat is so laggy.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.840
I have a lot of trouble seeing it.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Maybe I should reload it again.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840
Chat.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.840
Oh, if you could have picked your character,

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.840
what would you have done?

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.840
Okay, here was my mindset going in.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840
My mindset was...

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.840
I don't suit any of the characters.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.840
I thought maybe I would suit stabs,

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.840
but even now looking at Mercy, I was like,

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.840
damn, Mercy is literally Mercy.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.840
Like, I don't...

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.840
She's not me.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.840
So, I didn't really think I would suit any of them.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.840
So, I kind of went in hoping for an interview

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.840
so I could get the experience.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840
I was hoping for an interview

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.840
so I could get the experience of an interview

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.840
because I've had the experience of an interview

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.840
before.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.840
And I thought it would be good practice.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.840
I don't know how to explain.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.840
It was kind of a stupid mindset.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.840
I was like, you know what?

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840
You know what?

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:09.840
I might get an interview,

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.840
so let me try to get the experience of that.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.840
And then will I actually get accepted?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.840
Probably not, but I'll do the interview.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.840
And then, you know, down the line,

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840
if I apply to Hollow Life,

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.840
I'll be super pro because I'll know how to...

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840
I'll know how to talk to them

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.840
because I've had two freakin' other VTuber interviews.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.840
Yeah.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.840
Does the rats really stay on during...

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:39.840
Yes, it does.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.840
Yes, it does.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840
Yeah, unless you can get used to them.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.840
Yeah, because during my first VTuber interview ever

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.840
with unnamed company,

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840
it was really, really scary.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.840
And it was...

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.840
I did not do a good job.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.840
So I understand why they didn't choose me.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.840
But he...

01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.840
I didn't...

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.840
It was really nerve-wracking.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.840
Little did I fucking know

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.840
that the VLR didn't even give me an interview.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.840
They didn't give any of the girls an interview.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.840
So I didn't get any interview experience.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840
Yeah.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.840
You're in Hollow Life already, Imi-chan.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.840
Thank you.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840
Aww.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840
Do you have some sort of routine

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840
to prepare for the lulley voice?

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840
No, I don't.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.840
I just do it.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840
And that's probably why my throat

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840
is fucked up right now.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840
But no, I don't.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.840
I just do it.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840
It's probably smarter if I do.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840
Yeah.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.840
I thought you liked footskin as well.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.840
I do, I do.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.840
Kind of a shame to admit

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840
that I also like to eat my footskin.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.840
But I feel like I wouldn't want to eat your footskin.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.840
I feel like I know where my feet have been,

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.840
so I'm comfortable with eating my footskin

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.840
because it's like,

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.840
I wash my feet really well

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.840
every time I take a shower.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840
So like,

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.840
I'm comfortable with eating

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:01.840
and peeling my footskin.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.840
But with your footskin,

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.840
I don't know where those dogs have been.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.840
So I don't think I want to eat that.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840
You know?

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.840
Is the rat plush the reason for the rat suit?

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.840
No?

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.840
I just thought the suit was funny.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.840
I just thought it was a funny suit.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840
Lemon ginger tea is your friend?

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840
I did drink tea.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.840
It's not really helping.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840
Can you describe your creative process

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840
for your videos and streams?

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.840
Videos?

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.840
The years upon years upon years

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.840
of,

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.840
content.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840
I've,

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840
I've,

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.840
what do I even call it?

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840
Consumed.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840
That's where I get my inspiration from.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.840
Literally, I've copied like,

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.840
I've copied like direct voice lines,

01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840
voice lines.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840
I've copied direct lines

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840
from like other,

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840
corn.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.840
Yeah,

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.840
so there, there,

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.840
that's where I get it from.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.840
Strani said,

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.840
you're cool, get in.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.840
Yeah, I,

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.840
oh yeah,

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.840
because I told someone

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.840
to kill themselves in my YouTube chat.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.840
That was it.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.840
Um,

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.840
I don't remember doing that to be honest.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.840
I have,

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.840
I have done the pin of shame before,

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.840
where if someone leaves a,

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840
a hate comment,

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.840
I'll pin the comment and,

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.840
and uh,

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:30.840
maybe I'll say something mean,

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.840
but I've,

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.840
but it's mostly so other people bully them.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:35.840
So yeah.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.840
Have you watched, dude,

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840
that's wholesome before joining feel or,

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:40.840
a little bit, yeah,

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.840
yeah, a little bit.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840
A little bit.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:14:59.840
I'm sorry,

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.840
I'm just looking for those concrete slappers.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.840
What do you enjoy most about engaging

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.840
with your community?

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840
I don't know.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840
I feel like,

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840
I don't know.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840
It's just fun.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.840
It's just fun to,

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.840
to, to do.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.840
Like,

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:21.840
I don't really,

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.840
this is so fucking depressing.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840
Oh my God.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.840
So,

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
um,

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.840
I don't really have like real life friends unfortunately.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.840
I'm really,

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.840
really bad at like,

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.840
keeping up with people in real life.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.840
So all the friends I used to have,

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.840
I,

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840
I'm such a terrible person.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.840
I can't keep up with them.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.840
So like,

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840
you guys are like the ones I hang out with.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840
God, that's so depressing.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.840
I'm sorry.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.840
Do you like us?

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.840
No.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840
Say ah.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840
I hate you.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.840
You're trash.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.840
I don't think that's based.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.840
I don't like when people say kill to other,

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.840
kill yourself to other people,

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840
but I get it's not serious.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840
Yeah, it's not serious.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.840
But also like,

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.840
if you're gonna leave hate,

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.840
you should probably expect to get,

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.840
to get hate back,

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.840
you know?

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.840
Um,

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.840
so,

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.840
I wasn't really thinking when I,

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.840
when I did that,

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.840
but it's,

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.840
it's like, you know,

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.840
if you're gonna dish it out,

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.840
get ready for it to come right back to you.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.840
Sonic Generations or any Sonic game.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840
Yeah, I'm not a gamer.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.840
I've played like,

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.840
do you guys know Friv,

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.840
Friv.com?

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.840
It's like a really, really old browser,

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.840
does it still exist?

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Let me look it up.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:41.840
It's like, okay,

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:42.840
maybe it's not that old,

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.840
but it's old to me.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.840
It's like a browser game website.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.840
And that's the only place I've played.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.840
It still exists,

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840
but it looks shitty now.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.840
That's not how it used to look like.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840
Yeah, it's just a website

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.840
where you play browser games.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:16:59.840
And that's the only place

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.840
I've played any sort of Sonic game.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.840
And I don't know if that's,

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.840
that was like real Sonic or anything.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.840
Hag!

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.840
Not a hag!

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.840
Please!

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.840
Is people getting overly parasocial

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.840
concern you at all?

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.840
Well, as long as

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.840
you don't fucking find my house,

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.840
no.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.840
How automatic is the automatic plushie?

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.840
I haven't tested it out yet.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.840
I don't know.

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:37.840
I haven't ordered it yet.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.840
Fortunately,

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.840
thrown takes a little while,

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.840
takes a couple days for them to

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.840
because how it works with thrown is

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.840
they don't always order it for you.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.840
Sometimes they just give you the money

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.840
and then you have to order it yourself

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.840
and then it takes a few days

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.840
for them to actually give you the money.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.840
Yeah, I was hoping you'd get a test run.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.840
Even if I did get a test run,

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.840
I wouldn't talk about it here.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.840
I went to fish after flash games were taken.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.840
Fish? What's fish?

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.840
Is that another?

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.840
What do you mean?

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840
Like did you go to touch grass

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.840
after flash games were taken out?

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840
Is the plushie the same one

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.840
that she tweeted about?

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840
Yes.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.840
Listen, I mostly put it there as a meme.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:42.840
It was mostly a meme.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.840
I really did not expect.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.840
I really did not expect anyone to get it

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.840
because we're VTubers.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.840
I don't want to disappoint anyone,

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.840
but if you want to see a real life

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.840
gucci getting gutted,

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.840
we're not the place for you,

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.840
but someone got it anyway.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.840
Thank you.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.840
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.840
I should probably...

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:20.840
There is a plush polar bear context,

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.840
so they don't know what I'm talking about.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.840
Polar bear context.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.840
There is a plush polar bear

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.840
that has an extension.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.840
It has an extension.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.840
It has some other capabilities.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840
I added it to my throne

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.840
and someone very graciously purchased it.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.840
I guess I will be doing something with it.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.840
I know what you're talking about,

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.840
so when I followed her,

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.840
I replied to that clip I saw it too.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.840
Okay, good, good, good, good.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.840
The clam slam and plushy.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.840
You guys should get together

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.840
and do a burping contest.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.840
Honestly, I really, really want to do

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840
an off collab one day.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.840
I think it would be really funny.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.840
So, sure, maybe we can do a burping contest.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.840
Honestly, I think I'll win.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.840
Just because...

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.840
Can the other girls burp on command?

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.840
I'm not sure.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840
If they can, maybe I won't win.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840
But if they can't,

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.840
then I'm the fucking winner.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.840
There's no competition

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.840
because I can burp on command.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.840
I love hearing women have fun.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.840
How do you balance v-tubing

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.840
with other aspects of your life,

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.840
such as work or school?

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.840
I'm a loser.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.840
I don't have a job.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.840
Before this,

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.840
this was...

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.840
Before Vealer,

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.840
this was also my job.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.840
So, yeah.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.840
School, it was really, really difficult

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.840
for sure I stayed up during...

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.840
I have a really bad schedule.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.840
I'm hoping that maybe management

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.840
can help me a little bit more

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.840
when it comes to schedule stuff.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.840
Because...

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.840
When I was managing myself,

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.840
it was really, really bad.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.840
I would record and then edit

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.840
and then post all in one day.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.840
And...

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.840
I'm a really big...

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.840
Well, I used to be a really, really big perfectionist.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.840
I'm trying...

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.840
Trying to let loose a little bit

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.840
and let the editors take care of it.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:56.840
Let the script writers take care of it.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.840
I'm trying not to be so much of a control freak.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.840
But before, I was a huge perfectionist.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.840
So, it would take me forever

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.840
to write scripts.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.840
It would take me forever to...

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.840
to record.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.840
It would take me forever to edit.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.840
So, I would stay up a lot at night

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.840
until, like, 1, 2, 3...

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.840
Never 4 a.m.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840
Maybe 4 a.m.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.840
I don't know. I would just stay up a lot. That's all.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.840
Do you properly take care of yourself?

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.840
No.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.840
You can take care of me.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.840
Found you through the other Twitter account?

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.840
Ah!

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.840
That's good.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.840
I'm glad you enjoyed that.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.840
Mom... Mom might give you a run for your money.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.840
Will she?

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.840
We'll see. We'll see.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.840
Starting in Shibibirp a bit.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.840
They do. They do.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.840
Can you burp the ABC?

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:57.840
No. No.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.840
I think I'm gonna...

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840
I'm gonna vomit. I can't.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.840
Any hopes, wants, or ideas for a future outfit?

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.840
A future second outfit at this stage?

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.840
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh my god. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.840
Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.840
I'm really excited to announce this.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:19.840
I already have a rigger in mind that I've sent to Strani.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.840
We will... I want...

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.840
I think we're playing on reaching out to him soon.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.840
They're a really good rigger.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
Oh my god, I saw their work. They're so fricking good.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.840
So I...

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.840
What I want to do is...

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.840
I want to design a 2.0 model with you guys.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.840
I don't really...

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.840
I don't really like...

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.840
I don't really want to do a lot of art streams,

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.840
mostly because I'm not good at art streams,

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.840
but oh my god, Zellie's here! Hi!

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.840
Hi, Zellie. Oh my god, I didn't expect you to be here.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840
Oh my god, I'm flustered.

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:00.840
Okay, yeah.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:01.840
So...

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.840
What I want to do is I want to design a 2.0 with chat.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.840
Whenever we get a quote from the rigger,

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.840
the modeler, I don't know,

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.840
I will put it on thrown.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840
So that way we can...

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.840
You can donate to it,

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.840
to a goal of having a 2.0 model.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.840
It's really expensive,

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.840
but I'm going to do the art myself,

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.840
so I'm hoping that we will be able to reach the goal

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.840
and I can get another model soon,

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840
because I'll be doing the art myself,

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.840
so maybe it won't be as expensive as a regular model,

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.840
because if you don't know a lot of artists

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:51.840
and a lot of riggers and a lot of, like, live 2D...

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.840
Oh, mod Zellie! Oh, fuck you, right.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840
Where is she?

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.840
Zellie, where'd you go? You're lost in chat.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.840
Oh, there she is.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.840
Ah, shit.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.840
Ah, I can't do it in OBS with a frick.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.840
Okay, let me open...

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840
So, let me continue, explain.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.840
A lot of live 2D artists and stuff

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.840
actually charge companies more,

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.840
simply for being companies.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.840
They have, like, a corporal...

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.840
Zellie, I have to find you again.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.840
Shit.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.840
Oh, there she is.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.840
Add as moderator.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.840
Standard?

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.840
Standard, I don't know, standard.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.840
Okay, so they actually charge companies

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.840
more than, like, a regular person,

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.840
which is understandable, because, um...

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.840
you know, companies are gonna probably make more money

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.840
off of your work than, like, a, you know, an indie person,

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840
so, uh...

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.840
I don't think Strawny mentioned

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.840
how much the models costed.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.840
I don't even know if I should,

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840
but it was a lot.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.840
It was a lot of money.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.840
The models costed, like, more than you would expect.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.840
Let's just say that. They costed more than you would expect.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.840
So...

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.840
Where was I going with this?

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.840
Where the fuck was I going with this?

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.840
So, yeah, if you want us to have 2.0 models, you know, um...

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.840
you don't have to support us financially,

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.840
but just watching us is really helpful,

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.840
like, watching our streams or watching our videos

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840
that we put out, um...

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.840
because once we get monetized, you know,

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.840
ad revenue will help us.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.840
But yeah, models, 2K top?

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.840
Not even close, bro.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.840
I was so surprised when I learned how much they cost.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.840
I was really, really surprised.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.840
I was like, oh, my God.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.840
It was a crazy amount, okay?

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.840
For individually, it was a crazy amount.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.840
I'm not gonna...

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.840
You could ask Strani, okay?

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:06.840
But anyways, because I'll be drawing the model art myself,

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:11.840
I think, I think, I think, I think a 2.0 should be like...

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.840
I want to say 3K,

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.840
because it's just gonna be paying for the raker.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.840
But we'll see.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.840
Anyways, one jazillion dollars.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.840
I really want to design a 2.0 with you.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.840
Yeah.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.840
And I want to make it emo.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.840
I want to make it emo.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.840
I think that would be really funny.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.840
You're doing your own work.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.840
Did you use a model on your stream before?

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.840
Yes, of course. I was a V2 player before this.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.840
And I made my own model before.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.840
I can help design.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.840
Yes, I would love that.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.840
I made my own model.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.840
I can rig,

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.840
but I don't really want to make my own 2.0 model

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.840
because I'm actually kind of trash at rigging.

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.840
I'm not good at it.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.840
So that's why I would like to get someone else to do that,

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.840
but I can do the art.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.840
What kind of emo?

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.840
Like basic emo?

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.840
Internet emo?

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.840
I don't know.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.840
Gothic maybe?

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:25.840
Get free.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.840
I already have someone in mind.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.840
I already know who I want.

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.840
I think you'll recognize the person's work.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.840
They're good. I've seen their stuff before.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.840
You should do 2000's emo.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.840
Gothic Lolita? I don't know.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.840
Something dark and mysterious.

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.840
Is 2.0 still going to be emo?

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.840
Of course.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.840
I can't completely change.

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.840
I'm emo now.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.840
I can't completely change this design.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.840
That would be so mean.

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.840
It'll still be emo, of course,

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.840
but we'll have a different hairstyle.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.840
We'll have different...

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.840
I got you, Bish.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.840
It'll be really cute.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.840
Unless you mean like I'm still going to use

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.840
this model art?

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.840
No, I'm not.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.840
I will be redrawing it entirely.

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:28.840
I'm not going to just replace the hair and stuff.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.840
I would pay a go-rillion dollars for...

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.840
for emo in me.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.840
You guys are so cute.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.840
Some of the biggest technical challenges

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.840
you face during the transition?

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.840
Technical challenges?

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.840
Sorry, I don't know.

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.840
I don't know.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.840
I don't know.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.840
I don't know.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.840
I don't know.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.840
I don't know.

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.840
I don't know.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.840
Technical challenge?

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.840
Sorry, I'm so bad at reading the full chat message.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.840
Someone asked what's the biggest technical challenge

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.840
you face?

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840
None?

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.840
I don't think there was.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.840
The only... I don't know what you mean by technical

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.840
different software?

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.840
No?

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.840
I...

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.840
I didn't get any new equipment

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.840
from feel or I already had

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.840
all of the equipment I needed.

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.840
So,

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.840
I didn't have to learn anything new.

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.840
Some of the other girls, you know,

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.840
aren't as experienced with ASMR.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.840
That doesn't mean they're bad at it though.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.840
They're probably better than me.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.840
You know?

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.840
So, yeah.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:54.840
So, I didn't really have to

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.840
do anything.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.840
The only really issue I have

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.840
is trying not to be so much of a

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.840
control freak when it comes to like,

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.840
you know, my content

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.840
because, you know, I have to give it off

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.840
to someone else.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.840
And they will do the work

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.840
for me and I will get it back

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.840
and I can't

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.840
find their house and knock on their door

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.840
and tell them

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.840
and give them a whole giant list

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.840
of things to change because

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.840
then that's just gonna make

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.840
it take forever for every single audio

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.840
and as much as I want

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.840
to do that, that's really annoying.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.840
So, yeah.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:36.840
Thoughts on beavers?

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.840
I've never seen one in real life actually.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.840
Scuff is usually part of every process.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.840
The only, I mean like,

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.840
the only issue I have is my,

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.840
my fucking iPhone.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.840
It keeps disconnecting.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.840
And sometimes it doesn't even work at all.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.840
That's the only issue.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.840
And also like,

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.840
YouTube is stupid. Like, this YouTube

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.840
chat is stupid.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.840
YouTube should fix that.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:06.840
Someone sent an email right now

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.840
to YouTube CEO.

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.840
Fix it. What is your response

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.840
to the skibbity toilet allegations?

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.840
It's fake! It's fake fucking news!

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.840
Shibi made that shit up! It wasn't me!

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.840
I swear to god.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.840
I swear to god.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:22.840
Let it be known here in front of the court of law.

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.840
I didn't, I never said

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.840
shibbity toilet.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.840
I never said shibbity toilet not even once.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.840
I don't know where you got that from.

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.840
I never said shibbity toilet.

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.840
It was mercy. There you fucking go!

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.840
Admission of guilt.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.840
It was mercy.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.840
Mercy is the one that said it.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.840
And you put it on me,

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.840
and now people are like,

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.840
what a fucking zoomer.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.840
Shibbity toilet.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.840
Blame mercy.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.840
It was mercy.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.840
YouTube street have told

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.840
that they are doing anything for streaming.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.840
They aren't doing anything for streaming anytime soon.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.840
Oh well, they can suck my dick. I don't know.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.840
YouTube is not optimized for streaming.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.840
Yeah. Which is understandable,

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.840
but also like,

01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:14.840
lots of people stream on YouTube so optimize it.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.840
Yeah, it was mercy.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.840
We still got 30 minutes left.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.840
Objection, shibi never lies.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.840
Shibi does lie.

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.840
Or was it our manager? No, it was mercy.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.840
YouTube is pursuing shorts?

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.840
Are they?

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.840
I don't know.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.840
I'm kind of...

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:46.840
I'm biased against shorts when it comes to

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.840
like YouTube shorts.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.840
Because when I posted shorts,

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.840
not just on this channel, but on other channels,

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.840
like the same content

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.840
that would get popular

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.840
on other platforms

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.840
never really saw any reach

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.840
when it comes to shorts.

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.840
So I might even just ask management

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.840
if like, if my shorts aren't getting views,

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.840
I might even just be like,

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.840
hey guys, can we like just

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.840
post them on other platforms

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840
and not post them on YouTube?

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.840
Because what's the point?

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.840
You know, I feel like, I don't know,

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:22.840
maybe they used to push shorts

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.840
a lot in the past,

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.840
but I feel like not anymore as much.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.840
But maybe that's just me. I've never really been

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.840
I've never really been lucky

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.840
when it comes to algorithm stuff.

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.840
I've always been like, fighting.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.840
I've always been fighting to the nail

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.840
when it comes to algorithm stuff.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.840
Yeah, it's wildly inconsistent.

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.840
Yeah.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.840
7K, I know, but like,

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.840
I don't know how else to...

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.840
7K

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.840
Do I sound prissy

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.840
if I say 7K isn't that much?

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.840
Like, I feel like

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.840
I feel like other platforms

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.840
that are more

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.840
focused on shorts might have more

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.840
talking like I'm a real fucking content creator,

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.840
like I know what I'm fucking talking about.

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.840
I don't know what I'm talking about, but I feel like

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.840
they might have more potential.

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.840
I just don't have faith in like, YouTube shorts.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:28.840
That's all.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.840
Uh uh uh uh.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.840
Many say they regret hyper-focusing on shorts.

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.840
I don't know. I also hear that

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.840
shorts um...

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.840
I also hear that shorts like

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.840
get you subscribers

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.840
but they're always like dead subscribers.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.840
Is that true?

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.840
Girl talk right now, okay? Let's um...

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.840
What's it called?

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.840
I keep fucking forgetting words.

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.840
Okay, well I forgot the word.

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.840
But like...

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.840
Wait, what was I talking about?

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.840
Oh yeah. Yeah, shorts get views

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.840
but do they get you like subscribers? Cause I feel like

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.840
the subscribers might be dead.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.840
Like I feel like, not saying they're bots

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.840
but I feel like it's like

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.840
the shorts viewers are just like zoomers

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.840
that actually don't really stay around for your content.

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.840
They're just there for shorts.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.840
Is this true?

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.840
I do have...

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.840
My grandma does have Alzheimer's.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.840
Alzheimer's doesn't run in my family.

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.840
Yeah. Asked Strani?

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.840
I don't know. I uh...

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.840
I don't know. I don't know if Strani would know.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.840
I get more money off a 20k

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.840
video than a 2 million view

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.840
shorts. Yeah, that's true too.

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.840
You get subs but they never go up.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.840
They never show up.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.840
Yeah, lots of kids do this girl.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.840
We must find the meta. We'll find it together.

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.840
I'm sorry to hear about your grandma.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.840
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.840
I won't trauma dump to you about my grandma.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.840
But if I ever forget things

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.840
or words, it happens like a lot.

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.840
I forget words a lot.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.840
A dead sub is better than no sub though.

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.840
Maybe for other people but for me

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.840
I would not prefer dead subs.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.840
Some people shout on me for

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.840
having a tiktok stream.

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.840
They were like cringe tiktok

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.840
as if you bitches aren't watching youtube shorts

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.840
and like

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.840
and like instagram reels

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.840
and like I don't know any other kind of facebook

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.840
like it's all the same stuff.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.840
It's all the same stuff

01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.840
and plus I'm not going to be going

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.840
I'm not going to be logging on to tiktok.com

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.840
and scrolling through my 4u page together

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.840
I'm going to be curating it

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.840
and showing you my absolute favorite

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.840
short form content

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.840
and you know

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.840
if you don't like tiktok that's okay

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.840
because it's basically just a meme review.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.840
Maximum little sister immersion

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.840
you're going to

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.840
sit with me and I'm going to make you

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.840
watch me drool on my ipad

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:22.840
as I scroll through my tiktok

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:24.840
4u page

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.840
and cough in your face

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.840
How about a girl like you show

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.840
you her funny little videos that makes you laugh

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.840
I know but I think some people saw tiktok

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.840
and they were like cringe tiktok

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.840
maybe I should have said shorts

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.840
or maybe I should have said memes

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:52.840
I don't know but yeah

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.840
I do scroll tiktok everyday

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.840
thank you thank you

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.840
but like I said it's all short

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.840
all short form content websites

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.840
just kind of have the same content

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.840
because people repost their stuff there

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.840
which yeah

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.840
I see in disguise what you mean I see in disguise

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.840
don't worry if the sub dies

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.840
just bring him back with your spellbook

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.840
oh I forgot to mention oh my god

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.840
okay so

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.840
shebe is into this too

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.840
me and shebe both do witchcraft

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.840
I'm sure shebe is more

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.840
experienced with it

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.840
well like me and shebe like both

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.840
genuinely do it

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.840
I think even mercy a little bit

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.840
I think even mercy a little bit

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.840
I think even mercy a little bit

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.840
I think even mercy a little bit

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.840
I think doing a witchcraft stream

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.840
would be really fun the problem is

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.840
some people may shit on me for my witchcraft

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.840
because like I don't

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.840
I don't go by any books

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.840
because to me it's like

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.840
I feel like to me it's like

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.840
not that serious

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.840
like I don't follow a lot

01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.840
of witchcraft rules

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.840
because it's like

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:04.840
I don't want to offend any witches

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:06.840
and chat any witches or wizards

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.840
and chat

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.840
they're all gonna curse me

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.840
they're all gonna hex me

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.840
so yeah basically

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.840
if I do some stupid shit

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.840
during witchcraft streams it's because

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.840
I'm not like a pro

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.840
wizard

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.840
I am not truly part of the shadow

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.840
money wizard gang I am just

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.840
a fraud I guess

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:36.840
I would probably shit

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.840
on something you do

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.840
with love

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.840
as long as it's with love

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.840
shadow wizard here

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.840
I'm very offended

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.840
I'm sorry please please please please

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.840
please don't curse me I'm sorry I'm sorry

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:52.840
yeah terror stream

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.840
that would be fun that would be fun

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.840
oh my god okay hold on let me drink some water

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.840
what strategies do you use

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.840
to retain your original ASMR audience

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.840
while attracting your new viewers

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.840
as a youtuber?

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.840
none? I am very well aware

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.840
that ASMR people like

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.840
there's like this weird thing

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.840
Starry talked about it too

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.840
there's this weird thing

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:24.840
about like

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.840
oh god this is so chronically online

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.840
and boring and like weird

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.840
and like stupid like go touch grass

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.840
but I feel like

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.840
and Starry agreed with me

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.840
there's this weird thing where

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.840
whenever an ASMRist

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.840
starts to delve into

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.840
v-tubing they get hate for it

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.840
which is so weird

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.840
because I feel like the

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.840
I feel like the audience

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.840
is very similar so you think it's like

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.840
people would be happy

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.840
but when I did it I got hate for it

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.840
I got comments like

01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.840
another one

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.840
another one

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.840
oh my god

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.840
okay

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.840
like what do you mean another one

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.840
like they're basically just streaming

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.840
as an anime girl and you've been clicking

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.840
on their thumbnails with anime girls

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.840
in the thumbnail like why are you annoyed

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.840
that they're now turning into an anime girl

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.840
like you've been watching

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.840
anime girl content

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.840
I don't get it

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.840
but

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.840
um yeah so I have

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.840
I don't have a strategy

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:44.840
because I won't be surprised

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.840
if I get no people from there

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.840
because the content is so different

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.840
like I will say like

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.840
I'm still planning on doing ASMR content

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.840
for sure for sure for sure for like we will have videos

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.840
I'm planning a slime girl

01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:58.840
one for the first one I don't know if it will get removed

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.840
by you too because

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.840
slime girl is very wet but I want to do

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.840
a slime girl for the first video

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.840
um

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.840
um

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.840
yeah

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.840
so many vtubers do ASMR

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.840
yeah exactly like why is it so

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.840
what what what what

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:18.840
what

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.840
I want to keep you your

01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.840
third D

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:28.840
they want to keep your third D

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.840
what does that mean

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.840
find the ASMR streamers don't get any views

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.840
when they stream non ASMR

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.840
that's true but I like ASMR

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.840
so I'm okay with streaming ASMR

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.840
it is weird I'm guessing they're worried about

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.840
that their ASMR is going to stop ASMR

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.840
all together yeah I think

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.840
they assume that but like

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:50.840
that's often not

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.840
the case

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.840
I mean sometimes it is

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:00.840
she is not my oh she

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.840
she is to be rejected in shunt

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.840
fuck this bitch

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.840
okay I keep seeing this question

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.840
a lot I don't know if it's the same person

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.840
thank you for the verb reading

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.840
um

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.840
someone keeps saying

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.840
why did what inspired you to be a vtuber

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:26.840
um

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:30.840
can I say this

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:32.840
I used to be a fleshtuber

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.840
I used to be a fleshtuber

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:36.840
yeah I used to be a fleshtuber

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.840
what inspired me to start streaming was

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.840
I had this friend that I met

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:42.840
and he he was like

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.840
oh

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:46.840
I'm a streamer and I was like dude

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.840
that's so fucking gay and boring why would you ever stream

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.840
it was a commissioner

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:52.840
at the time so obviously like it was a dude

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.840
that commissioned me and he was like

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:56.840
I'm a streamer I'm commissioning you

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.840
your art for my stream right

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.840
and I was like

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.840
that's cringe

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.840
in my head I was like that's cringe

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.840
but I was like

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.840
sure yeah yeah yeah

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.840
I'll do some art for you

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.840
for your stream

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.840
and then

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:18.840
when I like tuned into the stream

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.840
I was like

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.840
maybe this is kinda cool

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.840
maybe this is kinda cool

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:26.840
actually I kind of ate my words

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.840
I was like oh actually

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.840
actually you know

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.840
maybe maybe I can do this too

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.840
so I

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.840
did it

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:38.840
and I had a lot of fun with it and I was like

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.840
oh my god

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.840
this is kind of fun and I remember

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.840
my first stream

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.840
what I did was I had a laptop at the time

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.840
so I streamed on my laptop

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:50.840
and then I used

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:52.840
like my phone

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.840
as like a facecam

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:56.840
and then I didn't even have a microphone I used

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.840
my laptop microphone

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.840
and then I was having so much fun

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:02.840
with like

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.840
I think I had like one viewer maybe

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:06.840
so um

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.840
I was having so much fun

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.840
but then like halfway through the stream

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.840
my work called me

01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:14.840
and it made my phone

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:16.840
like fall off of the stand

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.840
so my facecam fell

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.840
and I had to like answer the

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.840
the work call during stream

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.840
and I was like hello

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.840
and they were like hey Emmy can you come in

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.840
tomorrow at I don't know 3pm

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.840
and I was like

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.840
nope

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:34.840
I never came in

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.840
when they asked me to

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.840
but um

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.840
and then I like

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.840
stream right after that cause like

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.840
I didn't

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.840
I didn't want this stream to like

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.840
you know

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.840
continue after work called me

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.840
um

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.840
I don't think I have that

01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.840
that stream

01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.840
like saved but it was really cringe

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.840
and I had a lot of fun and then I continued

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.840
hold on

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.840
ok

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.840
I continued until

01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:18.840
I

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:20.840
sometimes I would just use a vtuber

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:22.840
because I wanted to have big boobs

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.840
and so I would find like a 3d model

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.840
with really big boobs and I would

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.840
like jiggle them around

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.840
jiggle them around

01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:32.840
it was really fun to just use one

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.840
to have big boobs

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.840
um

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:38.840
and then um

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.840
I saw like

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.840
prism project auditions

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.840
and I didn't even know what hollow life was

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.840
but I was like whoa

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.840
there's like companies for this shit

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.840
damn

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.840
um

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.840
Emmy voice on the serum

01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.840
it was

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.840
it was funny ok it was funny

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.840
one moment oh my god

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.840
I'm sick ok I'm sick for any new people

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.840
I'm sick right now

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.840
right

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.840
so anyways

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.840
um

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.840
I saw prism project auditions

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.840
and I was like yo

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:22.840
this was meant for me

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:24.840
I've been using a vtuber model

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.840
I know how to do this

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:28.840
I'm totally getting it

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:30.840
and yeah prism project is gone now

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.840
um

01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.840
unfortunately you know what it's gone

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.840
because I wasn't in there I would have saved that company

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.840
I would have gotten them so much money

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.840
they would still be here if I was in there

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.840
I thought I was in there I'm kidding

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.840
I'm kidding I'm kidding

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.840
no I probably would have gone down with them

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.840
if I had ever joined

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:50.840
but um

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.840
obviously I got rejected

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:56.840
of course with that I'd be like are you fucking kidding me

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.840
oh my god it would be so funny to show you guys my old prism project audition

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:00.840
it was so funny

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.840
it was so funny

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.840
it was so fucking funny

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:06.840
you will cringe

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.840
so hard

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.840
but um

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:14.840
after that I was kind of

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.840
really like

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.840
mad because I was like what

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.840
are you kidding me I got rejected

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:22.840
so um

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.840
I stopped streaming

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:26.840
all together because I was busy

01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.840
but then afterwards um

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.840
one of my other friends

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.840
one of my other streamer friends

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.840
because I hadn't made streamer friends during this time was like

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:36.840
oh

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.840
you should you can draw anime

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.840
so maybe you should try drawing

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.840
vtuber models because you can make

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.840
money off of that

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.840
and at first I was like

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.840
that looks complicated right

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.840
um

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.840
at first I was like oh that looks complicated

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.840
I don't know and then I tried it once

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.840
and learned and I was like

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.840
it's kind of easy

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.840
it's not as hard as it looks

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.840
um

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.840
and so that's when I

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.840
learned how to make vtuber models and I was like

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.840
well I'm here now

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:12.840
so let me make a model for myself too

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.840
and uh

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.840
now we're here

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:18.840
that was a long ass story

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.840
do show

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.840
I don't let me see if I can even

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.840
find it

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:30.840
what's really crazy was

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.840
um

01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.840
not crazy but cringe

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.840
it might not be on this computer

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:38.840
it might be on my old laptop

01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.840
I'll try to look for it on this computer

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.840
but I'm not sure if it's here

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:44.840
um

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:46.840
during that time

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.840
the only thing I knew about vtubers was like

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.840
what I had seen from prison project

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.840
and I was like oh they like cute girls

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:54.840
they want to hear a cute voice

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.840
um

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.840
what is this

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.840
oh I just found my script for my audition

01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.840
aw

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:08.840
bro

01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.840
so what I did was

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.840
at first I was like okay let me try to be a cute girl

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:14.840
right

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:16.840
but I couldn't make the voice

01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:18.840
and that's why it's really cringe

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.840
I couldn't do it I couldn't it was

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.840
I was really bad at voice acting so instead I was like

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:24.840
okay

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.840
let me be a MILF

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:28.840
let me voice act as a MILF

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.840
because they had some

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:32.840
some mommy type models so I was like

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.840
let me let me try that

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:36.840
so I roleplayed

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:38.840
as a 40 year old

01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:40.840
I roleplayed

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:42.840
as a 40 year old

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:44.840
MILF

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:48.840
in my prison project audition

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:50.840
I literally said I'm 40 years old

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.840
and I have two daughters

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.840
and then I flirted

01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.840
with the listener

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.840
during the whole

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.840
because their thing was like introduce yourself

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:04.840
in a character

01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:06.840
so I basically flirted with

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:08.840
the listener as

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.840
as my audition

01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.840
let me see what I found

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.840
I found the script I don't know if I can find

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:18.840
oh god the dog is parking

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:20.840
downstairs type

01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:22.840
video

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.840
videos

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.840
I found the

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.840
modified

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:30.840
no

01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.840
well I can't find the video

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.840
but I can read to you a bit of the script

01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:40.840
hold on

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.840
I was like it's in dead a 40 year old

01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.840
MILF

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.840
let me see

01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.840
I fed

01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.840
I roleplayed feeding the listener

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.840
noodles

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.840
I was like open wide

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.840
see I told you

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.840
you doubt me too much

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.840
if you keep doing this I'll just have to

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.840
give you some firsthand experience

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.840
of what I can really do

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.840
I read it in a mommy voice

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.840
that'll have to be me showing you

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.840
my big sister

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.840
oh my god fuck I didn't even realize

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.840
we're close to two hours

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.840
I gotta keep my eye on the time

01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:34.840
cause we're gonna read a 0 after this too

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.840
but yeah that was me

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.840
that was me trying to be a MILF

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.840
for a prison project

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:44.840
what happens to your liberty channel now

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:46.840
nothing

01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:48.840
it'll stay up but all my new content

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.840
will be here

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:52.840
that's it

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.840
can we see the mascot

01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.840
I apologize

01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.840
sure

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.840
I think I should probably post

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:06.840
the mascot on twitter right

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.840
wait where is the mascot

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.840
here it is

01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.840
oh that's humongous

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.840
here it is here's the mascot

01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.840
you can see the old mascot

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:36.840
in my background music video

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.840
the bgm

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.840
I just thought it was a little too menacing

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.840
and all the other girls

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.840
had like really cute mascots

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:50.840
and I was like

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.840
I want something cute so I drew something cute

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.840
and this is it

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.840
I mostly got inspiration from like

01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:58.840
Pinterest photos

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:00.840
but yeah here's the picture of the mascot

01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.840
if you wanna draw

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:04.840
if you wanna draw yourself

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.840
the little pin pals there you go

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.840
here I'll put it in the corner maybe

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.840
down here up here

01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:14.840
yeah so cute

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:18.840
yes this is

01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:20.840
this is different from the schedule

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.840
the schedule has the old mascot on it

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.840
did Azura start streaming yet

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:28.840
let me check

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.840
I think I made it

01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:32.840
so that it automatically

01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:34.840
raids right

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.840
so cute

01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:42.840
can I eat it you wanna eat yourself

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:44.840
yourself

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:50.840
ok now yeah I'll stay with you until Azura starts

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:54.840
can you wink

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.840
ah that was kinda cute

01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:58.840
oh my god I just cut it

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:00.840
I kinda just like

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.840
I blushed at myself

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:06.840
there you go that's me winking

01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:08.840
I can wink now

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.840
I couldn't wink before

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.840
but now I can

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:22.840
what inspired you to make the leap to 18 plus content

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.840
so I actually

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.840
was gonna make

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.840
like ok

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.840
I listened to it a lot before

01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:36.840
and I listened to it a lot before

01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:38.840
and since I was doing

01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:40.840
I was already doing you know

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:42.840
the safer work stuff

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:44.840
I actually planned on starting

01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.840
way way earlier than I

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.840
then I ended up starting

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.840
but I kind of

01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.840
just like I was

01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.840
it was always in the back of my head

01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:58.840
I was like yeah I'm gonna do it soon eventually

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:00.840
but I had put a goal in my head

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:02.840
that I thought I would never reach

01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.840
when it comes to subscribers

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.840
I was like once I get 25,000 subscribers

01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.840
I will

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.840
I will do

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.840
you know 18 plus a somewhere

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.840
and then I got 25,000 subscribers

01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:16.840
like way faster than I thought I would

01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:18.840
and I was like oh fuck I'm not ready

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.840
I didn't think I would actually get that amount hold on

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:22.840
wait wait wait I'm not ready

01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:24.840
so

01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:26.840
so you know I just made it

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.840
when I was finally ready

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:30.840
yeah basically I listened to it before

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.840
and I was like maybe I should do it too

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:36.840
um

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:42.840
what a sweet and innocent looking peach

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.840
um

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:48.840
is this stream finishing before your neighbors?

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.840
my neighbors have stopped now

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.840
I don't hear it anymore

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.840
yeah from consuming it

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.840
to making it yupp

01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.840
yupp yupp yupp yupp

01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.840
um

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.840
the concept for your eyes

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.840
like the eggs?

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:10.840
ask strawny

01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:12.840
I didn't design the character I don't know

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.840
they're in the afterglow

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.840
they're sleeping now

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.840
shh don't wake them up

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.840
okay though

01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:28.840
um

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:30.840
that was a weak performance

01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.840
is it because you didn't hear it?

01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:34.840
I heard it

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:36.840
honestly

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:40.840
I don't want to trash talk my neighbors

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.840
but I don't know how the guy downstairs gets it dude

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:44.840
he's like

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.840
oh my god I should probably talk about

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.840
I don't know how the guy downstairs gets any pussy

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:50.840
he's like

01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:52.840
kind of annoying

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.840
and ugly

01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:58.840
and he's kind of mean

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.840
I don't know how he gets any

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:04.840
and he's kind of stinky like I've seen inside his

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.840
I've seen inside his apartment

01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:08.840
and I'm like bro

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:10.840
bro clean up a little

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:16.840
you didn't hear that from me though

01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:28.840
start moaning louder

01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.840
no

01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:32.840
they've already heard me moaning anyways

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.840
buttons like a voodoo doll

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:38.840
probably yeah

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:40.840
yeah the eyes probably do represent

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.840
that would make sense

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:52.840
sorry I know I'm being quiet

01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:54.840
my voice hurts after talking for so long

01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:58.840
what's the thing

01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.840
or item you would steal from the other girls

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:02.840
they're tits

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:04.840
so I can touch them

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.840
duh

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.840
you think I want to be flat

02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:10.840
you think I chose this

02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:12.840
I want boobies

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.840
I want big hunkers

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.840
so

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.840
I don't know

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:20.840
I don't know

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:22.840
I don't know

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.840
I don't know

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:26.840
so of course if I could steal

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:28.840
something from the other girls

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:30.840
I would steal their boobies

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:42.840
flat is justice

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.840
you ain't flat

02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.840
I'm not

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.840
really you think so

02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:50.840
well breast envy is cute

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.840
is it

02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:56.840
ok well I'm glad you think

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.840
my suffering is cute

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.840
maybe the 2.0 will have tits

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:02.840
I'm kidding I'm kidding I can't

02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:04.840
I can't I can't do that

02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:06.840
image flat flat is ok therefore

02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.840
image is ok

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:12.840
did you guys

02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:14.840
there's this one image I really want to show you

02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.840
but I don't know if you guys

02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:18.840
will

02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.840
there's this maybe someone can find it for me

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.840
there's this meme

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:24.840
of this anime girl

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:26.840
and she has like really flat boobs

02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:28.840
but the meme was like oh

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.840
you know flat boobs

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.840
they're just they're just hiding

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:34.840
like in another dimension or something

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:36.840
and then you can see behind her

02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:38.840
you can see behind her

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.840
and like there's like giant tits

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:42.840
coming out of the other side of her

02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:44.840
does that make sense

02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.840
I don't know

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.840
I don't know if anyone has ever seen that meme

02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.840

02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:58.840
that freaking meme

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.840
or at least say like where the artists

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:02.840
