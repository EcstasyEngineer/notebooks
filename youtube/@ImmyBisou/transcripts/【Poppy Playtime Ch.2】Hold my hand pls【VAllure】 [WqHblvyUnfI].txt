didn't transfer because I'm family sharing with my other account so I guess
I had to have to download it again let's see now I'm playing chapter 2 because
I've already played chapter 1 and wait oh fuck it's on my speakers let me close
the game yeah I already I already played chapter 1 so yeah that's why I'm playing

thank you as long as they make you smile that's all that counts oh okay okay
let me move to a different screen is that capturing good nope nope nope oh that
is not capturing good okay are you okay if I have like a random gap I don't know
why maybe I can change the resolution to be better I don't know why that gap is
there I see is totally more of a brat than me I am not as much of a brat as
she is you like cats or maybe full-screen would make it gapless oh oh but
now every time I click I always have trouble with this game oh there we go
now it's gapless wait why am I floating am I floating for anyone every time I
click back on to I'm so confused okay I'm just gonna make it windowed and
there's just gonna be a gap or borderless window no there's just gonna be a gap oh
well whatever whatever it's okay sorry I know the music keeps pausing because I
keep clicking off at the game you're not late you're not late we haven't even started yet
okay um okay I think we can start the resolution the red that resolution is
very wait let is something wrong with the resolution right now

here what's the highest resolution here this is a higher resolution
gonna be cushing every time I scream oh my god most monitors are 1920 by 1080 I have
really weird monitors because both of my monitors are really old so it's really
possible that they're that they're like strangely shaped wait this is a high
resolution I don't understand resolutions we'll just get there just gonna keep it at
this I'm just gonna keep it at that okay okay okay okay or should I make it should
I make it in the middle like that yeah yeah that's good that's good okay okay

blood on this toy your entire life is a lie I guess this is the only direction I can go do you
want collections what do you mean collections I just heard a sound I should probably have both
of my headphones on for this didn't I I just like to hear myself talk I love to hear myself yeah
do I have to figure out how to get past here and I run in this game
how do I we like to hear you you have to fuck okay wait wait I didn't think I'd figure it out
so quickly I'm so smart oh my god wait do I have to run yeah yeah let me cook let me cook I'm
getting there I'm getting there how do I do this am I letting go too soon and too late oh
there we go oh there's another buddy toy here oh my god I have a story about this okay can I bring
this with me no when I was in kindergarten I used to they used to have dinosaur toys in
kindergarten and my favorite dinosaur toy was the long neck dinosaur toy and I played with it
all the time and that was the only dinosaur toy I played with and anytime you know any other kid
wanted the long neck one I wouldn't let them have it because it was my toy and then this one kid
wanted the long neck dinosaur toy but I didn't want to give it to him because it was my freaking
toy and so he didn't even want it because he wanted to play with it he just wanted it because
he knew I liked it have to you in the inventory oh okay he just wanted it because I liked it and he
wanted to like you know take it from me and so when I told him no he was like Amy's a bully he
started teasing me and he made a whole song of it buttons are there other buttons other than E
he made a whole song with lyrics about how I was a bully and he would sing it to me oh wait press
here okay puppy oh wait you're not puppy what's your name what's his name again um I forgot his
name was it catchy no right how dare they bully me huggy wuggy huggy wuggy yeah there you go huggy
look at me I'm right at the perfect height for him okay um then we come from there I feel like I
should have done I mean I guess I got a key from this room right maybe I shouldn't have made it maybe
there's nothing more to do here for the next place is there another place wait there was a door
that was locked wasn't there you have to have to fucking do this again okay I did it I'm doing so
well compared to other times how do I run okay this door I wish I was as tall as Hucky you
don't even need to be as tall as Hucky don't worry I'm short enough or you don't need to be as tall
um I'm guessing I have to put a cassette in there oh look at all the drawings on him oh
so good what is that I need to find a cassette in here don't they more bloody toys more drawings
my best friend oh my god literally me and my long neck dinosaur toy oh thank you mr. Ludwig wait is
that a reference to the actual streamer wait you didn't have to swing again there was a ramp oh yeah
you're right I could have just felt fell down if you're as tall as huggy the NBA would be the most
realistic true what does this one say for Elliott Ludwig wait I don't think it's actually the
streamer Ludwig is it it's probably a character I can't read that hey we made toys like this in
the first chapter okay give me the freaking cassette oh there's a note here no give me the
give me the cassette next next give me the cassette huh I'm not the cassette fuck give me the note
help me only chance experiment 814 notes this experiment utilized a live rat rat was fed
three portions daily for two weeks at the end of the two weeks the rat was killed are you fucking
kidding me they knew I was playing this game they wanted to torture me into a poppy flower and
preserve preservative gel mixture one week later an electric shock was applied to the rat
still in the gel and attempt to revive it the rat remained unresponsive of course it fucking
remained unresponsive you should have been it should have been me not the rat it should
have been me just take me don't take the rat analysis I still believe in the potential of
the poppy flower its unusual properties lead me to believe that the proper mixture and procedure
could have life-altering properties the poppy flower has for a long time carried heavy symbolism
and I don't believe that's for bro this guy's got terrible grammar and I don't believe that's
for no reason perhaps something larger than a rat would yield different results yeah I don't
think so let's watch this play can I zoom in somehow I feel like I'm too sure is the product
of a great man by the name of Elliot Ludwig divorced but a family man his site will always
set on bringing amazing toys to amazing children around the globe Ludwig spent countless hours
in the factory working overtime relentlessly in an attempt to continuously innovate and surprise
in the 1960s an unfortunate family death had pushed Ludwig down to his lowest but with so
much ambition he rose back up and continued to fulfill his vision for the playtime code
why do they censor his face Ludwig could never be content leaving a project unfinished but
just how did one man come to create such an astounding empire how did he manage to stay
determined even after suffering such a tragic loss it all began in the fateful year of 19
oh I guess that's all okay okay not the streamer Ludwig can we get up here I feel
like this is someplace I should look into okay maybe not he's probably disfigured oh you think
something happened to him when does William Afton come in wrong game wrong game I'm William Afton
maybe oh wait am I supposed to go in there no I'm not right I remember watching Markiplier
play chapter 2 and he streamed it and he refused to look at chat to help him and he got stuck for
like two fucking hours in one part of the game because he's too fucking stupid to like even I
knew what to do and I'm really stupid and I don't want that to happen to you guys I don't want
you to get like super frustrated with me playing this game there's another vent
come down oh okay thank you okay thank you oh my I hope another huggy-wuggy doesn't come and chase me
this was literally the room that he got stuck in isn't it oh careful what you wish for what
you mean oh you think he's actually coming I thought he's not in this chapter I'm safe hell you

whoa oh I remember this
this
welcome to musical memory Jesus Christ the sound in this game is so
fucking badly
memory and cognitive recognition test is designed to stimulate several segments of the brain
allowing us to see how quickly and efficiently your brain works
like I put the sound so low and it's still so loud why is the sound like that is there
another sound option why does it do that memory time this isn't gonna go out
a sequence of colors will be shown and you must recreate the exact sequence using the buttons
around you uh-huh bunzo will slowly lower towards you when you complete a color pattern correctly
bunzo will rise back up when you input a pattern incorrectly bunzo will lower towards you faster
if bunzo reaches you your test is over the test will become more difficult as it continues
with longer patterns in quicker succession that's all good luck okay
isn't it amazing mommy hasn't seen the place I've been running in years mommy can only imagine
how excited bunzo must be it's been such a long time oh my god oh bunzo
hey we haven't even started the game now come on slow down now

Olive brown.
That's no fun.
Oh, there you are.
Thank you, mommy.
Thank you.
You praised me too much, I don't deserve it.
You're too nice.
Okay.
We did good, that was really scary.
That had me really, oh, oh, oh, okay.
I knew you could do it.
I'm not used to this much racing, oh my god.
This way?
Let me in!
I expected you to fail, are you serious?
No, actually, never mind, you don't praise me enough, keep praising me, come on.
I believed in you, thank you.
That's what I want to hear, expected me to fail.
I never fail.
I don't fail at anything ever.
I love you and me, I love you too.
Oh, am I just supposed to jump down?
Um, okay.
I knew you could do it.
Stop you're making me fucking laugh like a fucking mouse, it's so annoying.
Okay, what do I do here?
Oh, there's a long neck toy, and it's covered in wood.
Rejected item, orange robot toy, reasons for rejection.
After considering both options, management has decided to go with mommy long legs as playtime-coast stretch toy concept.
I like him personally.
Orange robot toy.
Ah!
I'm guessing there's something, did you notice, did you all notice the scream of Bunzo's death?
No, he died?
I can't handle all these praises and compliments, it's- it's, it's- I can't- I can't focus.
Oh god, that's terrifying.
Oh! Oh, um, oh, lever.
I'm guessing I'm supposed to power something here.
What am I supposed to power?
You weren't scared during any of that last mini-game, but got spooked by random collisions on the ground.
Well, because I was, you know, I was expecting it to be scary. It was the scary part of the game.
So obviously, you know, I'm locked in.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Stop praising me and help me with the game!
Oh.
Oh, look, there's a huggy.
Get the crane to get the collectible.
The crane.
The crane. There was a crane around here. You're right, there was a crane.
Of course it's unexpected scares that get me.
Where is, oh here, the crane. So do I power the crane?
With this hand?
Is there like a button to power? Oh, there's another rejected one.
Kick me, Paul. Nobody likes it.
Laughed out of presentation.
He's just like me. I never told you. I want to tell you this story because it's really funny.
Okay.
Raise equals awkward in me.
The claw. Pull the crane over top of large objects to pick them up.
Oh.
Oh, this one. Pick this one up.
Pick it up. Do your job.
Pick it up. Oh, I have to, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
I have to, I have to, um, the, the, the electrocute, right?
Okay, let me tell you the story.
So when I was like in seventh grade, maybe I used to play this very,
I used to play this very role-playing game. It was called, um,
it was called Feral Heart. If anyone, if, if anyone knows that game,
I'm going to be super fucking surprised. It was not a popular game, but okay, pick it up.
Pick it up. And, um, I used to role-play in that like all the time.
Give it to me now. Give it to me.
Oh, suck my, huh?
Was I supposed to move it so that it fell underneath me?
No, it was, um, it was a very role-playing game, but you could only be a wolf or a lion,
and I was usually role-playing as a wolf. You can make your own wolf or lion character.
When I, you could like customize the lion to look like a cat more,
and a lot of people did that so that way they could, so that way they could play as, um, please fall.
Okay, thank you. A lot of people did that so they could play as warrior cats,
and I played a little bit as warrior cats too.
Um, like I would make my own warrior cats, I see, and then I would role-play as one,
but that's not the point of the story. The point of the story is to tell you there was this one,
there was this one part of the map where people would do something called like the mating circle.
It doesn't, it doesn't sound like what you think it is, okay?
Oh, there's another rejected one. Hold on.
Serpup's a lot. Extremely negative reception from various focus groups.
Whoever's idea this was should feel ashamed.
So there was this one part of the map where they would do some activity, some event, I guess,
called the mating circle.
Now the mating circle, what happens in the mating circle is not a gang bang, right?
It's not a gang bang. What happens is, you know, everyone kind of gets in a circle,
and there's like, um, there's like a, um, there's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, right?
Work!
What?
It's not an orgy! I know it sounds like one.
There's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, and what they do, what they would do is they would, um...
Is there another sign?
A scientific?
A scientific sign.
Is they would call your name, like your username, and you would walk to the middle of the circle and sit next to them, right?
And then, basically how it worked is anyone, any other wolf that was interested in you and wanted to be your mate
be their mate in between a ladder where junk is piled and um or if like multiple people went
into the circle with you then you could choose like which one you wanted to be your mate or you
could reject them both so the point of this story is to tell you that anytime it was my turn I would
sit in these circles for hours by the way absolute hours to wait until it was my turn to see if I
to see if I could catch a mate in this free role playing game and every single fucking time it was
my turn no one ever went into the circle to be my mate I only ever got one mate
and I don't remember how it happened I think it was just some I think it was a girl I think it was
a girl she just came up to me she was like wow she had like a male character and she was like wow
you're so you're so pretty and I was like oh is this my chance to get to get a mate finally
and then um we like role played for a little bit together and then she left me like I added her
as a friend on that account and I found her because you can have different characters on the same
account and I found her later again by accident because she never came to me or found me or talked
to me ever again I just found her by by accident and it was a girl like character and I was like oh
my god I've been fucking bamboozled I've been bamboozled I actually didn't find a mate
that's okay to me that's why you have big brother you're gonna heal my trauma from being rejected
in the furry role play game okay now actually help me I'm I'm done I'm done with my my traumatic
childhood story something about a ladder right
yeah she one night stood me in catfish me you're right that fucking bitch
the lever the lever go down the stairs and move forward oh okay

in the pile of ladders and blocks is the tap you want tap I want

I couldn't tell another one
well it finally happened after years of being ignored the company actually heard all my complaints

This advanced test is designed to assess the extent of your reactionary abilities.
A dual-palm grab pack will be provided to you for this test
Around you are 18
An adorable huggy look toy could appear out of any one of these holes
I'm gonna suck on one of those one comes out hit it with your grab pack
That's all good luck, okay

Wait, wait, wait, no, I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready to call again. I'm not ready. I need to take a break
Wait, maybe I should turn my sound up so I can hear them better. Was I close?
Was I close to being done?
You're tears are my nourishment
You're only using one hand it will be slow once the pace picks up use both hands to hit faster
Okay, let me
Let me try putting those sound up more. Maybe
Maybe that would help
I feel like the sounds in this game used to have strings attached to them
So they could be pulled back when they got too close to the children
Have fun
I
Should I
You can only do so much with money brightness is already up in the game is to start that's what I'm saying
I
Don't see any I don't see any should I put

Oh
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Stop?
I'm crying
I
Jump off jump off that edge come over here
Wait, I want to see if putting my brightness lower might help because maybe maybe it's too light
Um, that's a bad idea
Don't cry I'm going to try to ignore this time. I just keep slowly looking around. Okay
I feel like the sound helps me see where it's coming from though
Oh
The gamma
That's not a thing here
There's no gamma is it vignette?
Don't stay in the middle if that doesn't help you
Okay
Camera is brightness remove bloom, okay
Sound can't help you it helps you
Sound can't help you see it helps you hear
I know but it helps it feel like I feel like it helps me tell which direction it's coming from if I can hear like

Mommy, one game left to play.
Sad.
Mommy was hoping you'd stay here forever.
Though, it's never too late to change your mind.
I don't care about you anymore.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Leave me alone, Mommy.
You're not hot anymore.
I don't care.
I don't care what your voice sounds like.
I don't like it.
I wish Amy would scream at me like that.
If you frustrate me this much, I might do it.
Oh, fuck.
What do I do here?
I don't think I can jump back, can I?
Collectible here.
Collectible.
Look up.
Up there?
Do I have to go higher?
Oh.
Am I allowed to say that I'm going to KYKMSonYouTube.com?
Is that allowed?
How do I do this?
Okay.
No?
Die.
Only in Minecraft?
You'll make me sad if you say that.
Okay, I'm only going to do it in Minecraft.
Well, I guess I have to enter then.
Move!
Can you make me proud if you say that?
Well, which one is it?
Can I say it or not?
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, was I supposed to go down there?
Wait, no, I feel like...
Rep collectible?

No.
YouTube, don't worry.
I don't actually mean it.
Oh, who's that?
Oh, it's...
Is that Huggy Wuggy?
Oh, I missed you.
That's not Huggy Wuggy.
Do it.
Pull it.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, fuck off!
Is she nice?
Oh, she is nice.
Well, how nice of her.
Okay, hold on.
Let me put the sounds back down now.
Because now they're too loud.
Okay.
She's on our side?
That's good.
What is this?
Oh, it's so light.
I wish I had Optifine so I could zoom in like in Minecraft.
She's teasing me?
I know.
I could tell.
Uh-oh.
Is my arm going to get stuck there?
Okay.
Huh?
In here?
What a nice girl.
She's so nice.
She's the only one that's been nice to me this whole time.
Other than you two, I guess.
What am I supposed to do up here?
Galvanized square steel?
Drop.
Do I just go up here?
No.
So don't blame me if you don't wish to take the route if you know what I mean.
Um.
I don't know.
Should I?
Should I try?
Should I try?
What am I doing wrong?
Oh.
Oh, okay.
Was I supposed to take that with me?
Oh!
Yee!
I'm so surprised I didn't even need help for that one.
Okay.
And then I guess we just keep doing that, right?
Come closer.
You have to cross all the steel doors fast.
Got it, got it, got it.
Where do I get the...
Wait.
Wait.
Oh, do I just get it from the same place?
Okay.
Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Give it back!
No!
Give it back!
Wait.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Hello, sisters of genius.
Oh, I can just push it.
I am a genius.
I'm so smart for making it...
Heart corridor.
I'm so smart for making it all the way here.
All by myself with no help at all.
Okay.
Is that Jacksepticeye?
Is that Jacksepticeye?
Is that Jacksepticeye?
Is that Jacksepticeye?
Oh, not at all, sir.
That's what I'd like to hear.
So, Marcus,
what happened?
You see,
I was in home for the day,
when my grandparents realized
that if we bloody wallowed in the cafeteria again...
His accent is so funny.
And that's when I see it.
Jacksepticeye.
Jacksepticeye.
So, what did you do?
Where is that from again?
I forgot.
When I just thought I'd nab the bloody york
and be on me merry way.
Double the mornin', do ya?
Well, laddies.
I'm reaching for the thing.
And the mob handled Jolton at all.
Had me scared stiff.
I thought I was the only one there.
So,
I took a peek beneath the gate,
and some massive bloody thing
was duthering about the bloody hallway.
Thing?
You're sure it wasn't a person?
Clearly, and we can skip school
and take care of her 3k birthday.
Of course, yeah.
I don't need school anymore.
I'm obviously smart enough
to just graduate right now.
I haven't a bloody nausea murder-wise,
but I wasn't human.
It wasn't human.
Besides me, obviously.
Is it bad that I can't tell the difference
between a Scottish and an Irish accent?
I didn't know that Strowney was Scottish.
Had a Scottish accent.
I thought she had an Irish one,
because they sound the same to me.
Don't tell her I said that.
Poor Jacks, but they see.
Is that it?
Oh, how am I supposed to get there?
I can't tell between Strowney and fruit,
and one is from Scotland,
and the other is from North England.
I feel like I'd be able to tell
between Strowney and fruit.
That's easy.
No, don't tell Strowney I thought she had an Irish.
Don't tell her I said that.
Do I?
I have no...
Get one charge.
Open gate.
Get other charge.
Place it at the end.
Grab the other charge.
Okay, you're putting too much trust in me there.
Where is the charge?
Charge?
What did that do?
What did that do?
What did that do?
What did that do?
What did it do?
What did that do?
Do I need to get all of them?
But it won't last long enough.
Just don't tell her you thought she was English.
No, I knew she was in British,
like British, British, like,
like, like, hello, mate.
Good luck.
This one?
Let's fucking go.
I didn't think I'd be able to do that.
I was so confused when you said it in chat.
I was like, what the fuck do you mean
get one charge and get the other charge?
How many charges are we catching here?
We're gonna get so many charges we'll end up in jail.
Okay, go.
Go, break it.
Break it for me.
Yeah.
Say bye to Barry now?
Do you mean Jacksepticeye?
I can't say Jacksepticeye.
No.
Well, it was a sacrifice I am willing to make.
Oh, okay.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I recognize this place.
Isn't mommy gonna come up from there?
No, maybe not.
Okay, never.
I just recognize it because we've been in here before.
Okay.
We did it.
Did we do it?
Oh, the card's name is Barry.
Oh, Barry the card.
Oh, Barry the card.
Oh, Barry the card.
Oh.
That was whack-a-wacky.
Oh, I did it.
I fucking did it.
I hope you had a fun day at the game station.
No, I didn't.
I'll start you the last one.
Thank you for all the pets.
All the pets.
Did you know that pet in French means fart?
Which way do I pull it?
Which way does it go?
Open.
Go to the middle of the train station.
The train station.
And look up.
This?
Oh, yippee.
Yay, thank you for the collectible.
Okay, now how do I open this?
Why is it beeping?
What a funny language.
So when you sharded, you petted yourself?
No.
Sharded out?
Is there a word for sharded in French?
We didn't learn that in class.
They didn't teach us, like,
I think someone asked for like,
18 plus French like ASMR,
but it's like, do you think
they teach us how to dirty talking French?
Of course, I don't know how to dirty talking French.
I don't even know how to say cock in French.
Close.
Close it.
Come on, we're trying to be safe.
All the safety regulations.
I'm going to fall off the train if I don't close it.
Oh, wait.
I don't know how to say cock in French.
I don't know how to say cock in French.
I don't know how to say cock in French.
Oh, wait.
Isn't that all French is?
Just dirty talking?
The teacher has failed me.
Louie nerd.
Won't be teacher fat, aw.
Bracket.
There's many ways to say cock in French.
Louie nerd.
La baguette.
Or maybe even le cock
if you're feeling spicy.
What about a stream learning to do it?
Who's going to teach me?
There's no website that teaches you how to dirty talking French.
Is there?
They're always talking dirty.
Okay, okay, train code.
Okay.
This thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.
Okay.
Okay.
This thing.
Google translate?
That sounds like a bad idea.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Are you doing something wrong?
You're not done.
Oh.
Collab with someone who speaks French?
Mmm.
Wait.
I think one of the people who did a watch along with us speaks French, right?
Is it para something?
Is she like native French?
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
Do the code.
It's too early for the train.
Well, how do I get down here now?
Because isn't this the next game?
Paras...
Is it Parasite?
Parasite?
Yeah, maybe we can do a collab with her and she can teach me how to speak French.
She can teach me how to dirty talking French.
Why won't this open?
Stand to the right of the door and pull.
Is it opening?
She didn't understand you when you spoke French on stream?
Oh, bruh, really?
Damn.
Well, I speak like very, um...
I don't, like I speak very English French, like...
The kind of French I speak is like,
it's like the French of kids who just went to French school all their life,
like haven't ever been to Quebec or France or anything, you know?
Like...
She'd be happy to do that?
Oh my god, maybe I should reach out to her.
Oh, okay, where does this go?
Oh, there.
Well, now that's distracted me.
If Ella's Canadian French and she's real French, she won't understand it.
Well, no, my...
It should still be understandable, though.
It's just not a good accent.
That's all.
Like, it's still completely understandable.
Otherwise, all of my teachers wouldn't be able to understand me,
because I had, like, actual French teachers.
Oh, come on.
Down here?
Puzzle time, y'all.
Gotta use my brain again.
Unfortunately.
Now what?
Wait, now what?
Did I use the wrong hand?
Think?
Okay, I used the wrong hand.
Okay.
I got this.
Okay.
Fuck!
I'm gonna fucking kill myself in Minecraft!
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Please!
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Did I do it?
I did it, right?
Okay.
No.
We're alone.
Hm?
Hm?
Hm?
Hm?
Hm?
Hm?

Welcome to Statues.
Hi.
This advanced obstacle course is designed to test your physical endurance and strength.
The rules are simple.
The lights will turn off.
You can move through the obstacle course at this time.
However, when the lights turn on, you can look around but cannot move.
You may move again once the lights turn back off.
The lovable PJ Pugga-pillar will follow you.
If PJ reaches you, your test is over.
Oh my god, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
Good luck.
Wait, I'm not ready, I'm not ready.
Come on, I need to take a break.
I need to take a quick break.
I need to take a break.
I'm gonna go refill my water.
I'm gonna go pee.
I'll be right back, okay?
Oh my god.
You
You
You
You
You
You
You
Okay, I'm back.
You didn't hear me, shut up.
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear anything.
How was the piss? It was okay.
It was a normal piss.
I didn't look at the color.
Surprisingly, I actually didn't, um, bleed at all.
I didn't goo at all while I was scared.
That's really surprising.
Usually I do, especially when I sneeze.
What did she say?
I can't hear you, bitch, speak up.
Huh?
I didn't hear anything she said.
Oops.
Okay, now the sound is completely off.
What just happened?
Okay, there we go.
Got it.
What the f-
Wait, wait, wait.
How was it already?
What happened?
Do you bleed when you sneeze?
I do, I do, I do.
When the lights turn on, you have to stop.
You can't move during lights on.
Did you forget the rules?
Okay, okay.
You don't move in the light.
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh my god, please hold my hand, I'm scared.
Hold my sweaty fucking hand.
Oh, come on.
What are those circles?
Should I have grabbed the circles?
Should I have grabbed the circles?
Tell me right now, tell me right now.
Please tell me right now, should I grab them?
Do I grab them or do I do-
Are they for him?
Yes?
Shit, shit, what?
No, no, no, yes, no.
I can't see, I can't see.
How do I run? How do I run?
Which one is it? Which one is it?
I forgot, I forgot which button, I forgot which button.
Not the hard tube? What do you mean?
Stop pressing F, what the fuck is that?
You're scaring me right now.
Which direction do I go?
Stop, stop saying it's over, stop.
Go to the right when you get out of the tube?
Wait, I don't get it.
Choose hard path, shut up about hard path.
You gotta tell me where I have to go, otherwise I don't know.
I know it moves when the lights are on.
Should I have gone in a different direction?
Should I go like this?
What did I do wrong?
What did I do wrong that time?
Tubes after the slide have difficulties above them.
Go to your left in the tubes.
I did not fucking move.
Those hoops are optional?
I stopped talking when the lights are on.
Okay, hold on, I need to pause to reach out.
You let go of the bar so it counts as you're moving.
Oh, so I should hold on to the bars.
You don't have to hang on the hoops.
The pugga pillar is chasing after you.
I know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
When the lights are on, yeah.
But aren't the hoops faster?
So, Amy, what you need to do is run faster than the monster.
Okay, thanks.
Go!
Oh, fuck!
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on!
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I can't take it.
I can't take it.
Usually I love being told I can take it,
but this time I can't fucking take it.
You moved during lights on?
I'm trying so hard not to do that, but I...
I lost eye!
God damn it.
Where's the easy tube?
I will see it.
Where's the easy tube?
Oh, it's on the left?
Go!
There's the easy one.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
I can't see.
Have you played red like green light?
You're treating me like I'm actually delusional,
like I'm actually stupid.
Like I have negative IQ.
Oh, shut up, she fell for the easy path.
Go right?
What do you mean go right?
What do you mean go right?
The blinking window.
What about it, what about it? What do I do there?
What do I do with the blinking one, hold onto that?
Ahh!
Go, go, go, go.
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, what do I do here?
What do I do here, what do I do here?
Help me!
What do I do? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up?
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
You're safe? Which hole? There's no hole!
There's no hole. Oh, there's a hole! Get me in the hole!
Oh? Oh, okay.
Bitch, she talks so, so low. Is it music or sounds? I can't hear you, girl.
It's still chasing me.
Did I just fucking die of fall damage?
I thought I had to do all of that all over again. I got so scared.
What do I do here?
Mommy, mommy, mommy, shut up. Oh my god. I'm so tired of hearing mommy.
I never want to hear the word mommy ever again.
How do I get out of here?
Look up at the end of the- yeah. Have you tried looking up?
What?
I like how crazy her voice gets, though. I really like this voice.
Keep needing to put her like louder. She's so fucking quiet.
Where are you?
Up again?
Oh my god.
Okay, okay. I'm guessing I have to look up another time, too.
Oh, maybe go down here.
Look up simulator.
Look up stupid.
I am authorized. I am authorized.
She's about to turn.
Is my little sis winning? Fuck yeah, she is.
I'm winning so hard right now.
Right? Right?
Tell me I'm winning. Tell me I'm doing a really good job.
Do I turn this? No, okay.
Okay, now it's too loud.
Wait.
Oh, another cassette.
You know, some people think I'm really old.
I'm really old, no, no one fucking thinks I'm really old.
Some people think I'm really young, but I was actually...
I was actually listening and watching cassettes when I was younger.
A lot.
I had a whole cassette player and I had a whole collection of cassettes,
and I would watch cassettes.
I'm not that young.
You're doing a really good job.
I'm actually secretly a boomer, and no one will ever know.
Hag! No, no, I didn't tell you that so you couldn't call me a hag.
Give it to me.
Rotate top degree. Oh, wait.
What?
Oh.
There's a tape. Where is the tape?
Did I miss it? Probably. Is there somebody here?
200-year-old.
Oh, wait, no, where's the tape? Yeah.
There's nothing back here.
Oh, that's where we came from.
Literally legal.
How could you miss? It was three feet in front of you.
What was in front of me?
The tape?
There's no tape.
It was right...
Where? Here?
Oh!
Can I jump?
Oh, no.
Yeah, I was too distracted thinking about hags and how sexy...
Oh, okay. I was trying to read it upside down.
Okay.
I see.
No, no, no.
Wait, no.
Wait, there's a top and a bottom?
This one.
No! Oh, that's the top.
Can I go the other direction?
Can I go the other direction?
Maybe like that?
Wait, what?
I don't get it!
No matter how old you are for me, you're eternally 19?
Why 19? That's such a random age.
Toy scanner.
Scan this toy.
Scan my dick.
I'm guessing I can't jump.
Can I? Should I try again?
19?
Haggler!
Watch out, we got an old lady over here.
She might trip and fall and hurt her back at 19 years old.
Can I grab it with my hands?
Sometimes...
Wait, so if I only rotate the top,
the bottom doesn't rotate, right?
Is that it?
But if I rotate the bottom,
then they both rotate, right?
Right?
Oh fuck you!
These bitches know what they're doing.
Wait, oh, oh wait.
Wait, wait, what?
No, I don't think I... I don't...
I don't think I got it.
So I need...
What?
Oh.
This fucking game is playing with my head.
But how am I supposed to get to it?
How am I supposed to get to it?
This is your first time seeing someone get stuck.
We'll be taking a lot of each other's first times.
Just keep trying.
Run while your hand is on it?
What do you mean?
Rotate more.
You gotta flip it truly.
You gotta use more specific language.
Step one, stand on blue platform in the middle.
Oh wait, I can't even get to it, hold on.
Okay, I'm in the middle.
I'm in the middle.
Can I just...
You know what, I don't even deserve that.
I don't deserve to see that fucking cassette.
I'm too fucking stupid.
Oops, am I tracking?
I'm too fucking stupid.
I don't deserve to even look at it.
I don't know how I got this far in life.
How haven't I died yet?
Watch me not be able to get it anymore.
Oops, I think I did it.
I'm trying to finish this fucking chapter,
but it's really taken my soul with it.
Play.
This better be fucking worth it.
Should I know this guy?
Is he also like a popular gamer?
It's huge, I'm telling you. What's your favorite color? Blue? I bet it's blue, right? It's blue?
It's green.
Okay, well, your special case, most people would say blue.
But seriously, marketing is not as easy as you think.
I make it look easy.
If there's anything playtime coach should be known for, it's not toys, it's marketing.
Thank you.
Your special case?
A special nutcase.
What do I do now?
I'm guessing I go to one of the places.
What the hell is the E sound?
Benjamin?
Am I supposed to, is Benjamin like a YouTuber?
Go to left first.
Wait.
Wait.
Oops, wait, no.
Aw, fuck.
Now I'm going to have to figure out how to get to the left one.
No, I wasn't listening to the video, was I supposed to? Was it telling me something important?
Hitting that Benjamin to blinker tint.
What the fuck kind of zoomer talk are you, are you saying?
Oh!
What?
Oh.
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, but...
Oh!
What?
Oh.
Meow, meow, meow, meow, but...
Wait, what?
Oh!
Can you meow like her?
What did she say?
Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Button.
Oh.
When you elevate yourself, go all the way to the top and grab the button.
Oh, I did it!
Did something happen?
Oh, this one's to go down.
Ugh.
Okay.
Oh.
Is there anything else?
Am I missing something?
Should I press the other buttons?
Aw, I think I'm doing something wrong.
I'll never understand why viewers urge humans to get collectibles.
They'll never worry or care about.
I don't know, it's fun.
It's a nice challenge, even though this entire fucking game is hella challenging for me.
Okay.
So...
I feel like...
I feel like I should be sending these arrows a specific direction.
Can I go up here?
You're doing it correctly?
Which way are they supposed to go?
We direct the cat to a sand.
You should be sending them towards you.
Where is me?
Where am I?
Which cat?
Are those cats?
Those look like monkeys.
How late is it?
I tell you how late it is, you're going to make fun of me for yawning.
Those are the bunnies.
There's no cats here.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, so I have to make them come towards me.
So, if they go that direction...
They go there.
Oh, but then they fall.
I won't, I promise.
Thank you, promise.
What do you hear inside me?
What do you hear inside me?
I don't know.
Do you want to find out?
Go up and hit the next one.
Push the blue button.
Oh, can I reset?
Yeah, everyone was thinking it.
He just said it.
He said it for everyone.
Oh, did I do it?
Oh, no, I didn't.
There we go.
Hello.
Now what?
I'm squishy and warm on the inside.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Is that all I needed?
Proof?
Proof where it didn't happen.
Bring it back to the other side of the spinny platform.
The spinny platform.
Is there a spinny platform?
Oh, that goes up.
Okay.
Oh, there you go.
Oh, nobody leaves without a toy.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
The toy scanner.
The toy scanner.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
The toy scanner.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Here we go again.
I need that one.
I can't believe the NSFW Twitter was official.
What do you mean?
Do you not know anything about us as streamers at all?
I'm not as streamers.
I guess as a company.
What time is it?
It's 8pm.
Yippee.
I've highly educated myself.
Listen, I've had a stressful evening here.
Of course, I'm going to be tired.
Okay.
On the whole.
The V-Sack.
Wait, what?
Was I here before?
No, I guess not.
What?
Okay, I'm glad no one made fun of me for being tired at 8.
What do I do here?
This part is tricky.
Okay, will I go another direction then?
I'm tired the moment I wake up.
Me too.
Me too.
That is very real.
Oh, this is a different place.
Wait, no, it's not.
No, wait, yes it is.
Okay.
Wait, oh no, I need...
Oh, I almost fell down.
Okay.
Are you fucking shitting me?
Wait, what?
Hold on.
Oh.
I thought I was gonna...
Okay.
I had a little bit of a delay reaction.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm gonna...
Huh?
Why did you lock it?
What?
Oh.
Wait, no, don't use that hand, don't use that hand.
Okay.
Ah.
What?
What?
Sorry, sorry.
It's still locked though.
In order to get the red tape,
you need to touch the second electric pole.
The second electric pole.
Do I go back this way?
Okay.
When we can hear you smile when you talk, that's the cutest shit.
Can you hear me smile?
I think it's mostly that you can see me smile.
Further from the panel.
Panel.
What is a panel?
There's a panel here?
Hello?
Did I fuck it up?
Hello?
Uh-oh.
You can hear me smile?
Aww.
Step one, grab one.
I grabbed one.
You have to activate the other room
and then go back with your hand still connected.
Touch only the further pole.
Oops.
Okay, only the further pole.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
Okay, okay.
Oh.
Wait, what?
Hold on.
What just happened?
What?
Wait.
The circle in the middle of the screen
indicates how far your arm...
Oh, there was a circle.
Wait, I feel like I just did nothing.
What did I...?
Wait.
What did I just do?
That was nothing.
Did I...
Your smile sounds like ara ara, what the fuck?
How is that...
What?
What did I...
What did I...
What did I forget?
Stop.
When you type in me like that,
it makes me feel like you're disappointed in me.
Where do I go now?
Red door was open.
It was open, you're right.
It was open.
What do I do with it?
Come on.
Repeat the steps.
You did great, just forgot to send energy
to the one in the wall.
Don't use my full government name against me.
Or there was...
Was there another one here?
Was there another one here?
Am I missing something?
Am I missing something?
Stop!
Stop!
If you see channel VR,
grab the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.
The red tape tucked into the electrical panel.
Okay, the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, behind me?
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Wait, now I feel like I'm going the wrong direction.
Okay.
Electrical panel.
Oh my fucking god.
The way they make me kill myself here?
It's like...
It's like extra punishment.
Okay.
You can die later.
Kill me now, please.
I don't want to.
You've tortured me enough.
Get your...
Pull yourself back up, soldier.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
How am I supposed to see that?
How is...
How am I supposed to see that?
Okay, wait.
Oh, this one.
Am I supposed to keep my hand there?
Okay.
Oh, that's the wrong thing there.
Is he talking about...
Is he talking about mommy?
I am a good girl.
I'm a good girl for suffering through this game with you.
Okay, where do I go now?
You can pick all the bookers with that thing.
Yeah, he is.
Okay, okay.
Do I leave?
That's not...
Spiders aren't scary, I agree.
I have a spider.
Her name is Rangel,
and she's a tarantula.
And she's an Arizona blonde,
and she's five years old,
and she's really fat.
You gotta do it again and go through the other door.
The best girl?
Your best girl?
No.
You have to need to get through the electrical door.
Electrical door.
There's another door.
Okay, I'm gonna go here.
Another door.
This door?
Jumping spiders are really cute.
Is it this door?
What's the point of using both of these?
What if I just do one?
Nothing.
In the room with the TV.
The other outlet.
The other outlet.
Did you try to type in me,
and instead of correct it to I'm my?
Right there, the circle.
The circle in front of me.
The circle in front of me.
The circle, the circle in front of me.
The circle in front of me.
The circle in front of me.
It's just that simple, the circle in front of me, right.
Why don't I think about that circle in front of me?
Yeah, but yeah, I get it.
Yeah, the circle in front of me.
The circle in front of me.
All these squares make a circle, and I'm in the middle, and all the rest of the wolves
are around me, and no one wants to be my mate, and I'm getting publicly humiliated because
no one wants to be my mate!
I don't need sleep, I need to finish this fucking level, that's what I need!
Okay, fine, jeez, let's go up left, tell me what to do now?
Look for the number 2 in the room with the VCR.
Your circle is your reticle, are you?
Are you shitting on my dick right now?
Swing across, open door, swing back, connect power.
Swing across, you gotta connect 1 to 2.
Okay, what?
I should be in front of the...
When you open the door, don't take the energy out of it.
Number 2?
Number 2?
2?
Any 2s?
Why won't it work?
Huh?
It's right there, it's right there!
What's going on, what's going on?
It's right there, it's right there, it's right there, just let me...
You have to swing back?
Huh?
What is a reticle, what does a reticle mean?
You have to swing back, you need the green one?
There's a green one?
Swing to the other room, then let go, then let go, left hand go through the door,
you will be back to the first, activate the pull, that doesn't...
You need green power.
Green power, of course!
Right, yeah, green power, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I need green power.
You gotta open the door to go through the red side to get the electricity.
Yeah, green power, yeah.
Why don't we go to sleep?
If I pass this, do I win?
Like how much more is there?
Do I need both of these?
In the middle of the screen you got a little rectangle.
No?
The lid?
I feel like...
Okay wait, so do I need both of these?
Hold on, I have an idea, I have an idea, I have an idea, let me do something here.
Let me do something.
What the fuck is this called?
Yeah, stand back, I'm starting to cook with gas now, okay?
What is this part? What should I call this part?
Come on, fucking ad.
Wait, is there such a thing as YouTube dark mode?
Okay, we passed that, we passed that.
Oh fuck, we're almost at three hours?
Okay, we passed that.
YouTube has a dark mode?
Oh this is the room, okay.
I want to finish this fucking game dude.
I'm not about to change the dark mode right now, let me have my fucking light mode.
I like light mode.
I know it's muted, I know it's muted.
Is he figuring it out himself currently? Does he not know how to play either?
Cause he looks like he doesn't know how to play either.
Come on dude, come on, this is a walkthrough, you're supposed to know what to do already, come on man.
Maybe he's talking?
No, he's not even talking.
Come on man, don't waste my time here, come on.
Oh my god, you dumbass.
Wait what?
Wait what?
Is this guy stupid?
Is he being stupid on purpose?
He's not talking.
Bro, this is not a walkthrough.
How are you going to fucking die during a walkthrough?
Yeah everyone's stupid except for me.
Come on, you can do it, come on.
Play it at two times speed.
Does he get stuck here too? Cause it looks like he's almost not...
Okay no, I'm not watching this, I'm not fucking watching this.
Give me a walkthrough.
Like show me that you know what you're doing.
Oh my fucking god.
This is so frustrating.
It's literally a pre-recorded video, cut out the parts where you fucking die.
Isn't that fucking hard? It's a walkthrough.
Walk me through the game, why are you showing me you dying?
Do you want me to copy that too? Do you want me to copy every time you fucking die?
Wait, what?
Wait, what just happened?
Let me look through that again.
Okay.
Oh you have to do it really quickly and you have to get both of them.
It stays open.
Okay.
Oh god it's lagging, why is it lagging?
Okay.
Okay, hold on, let me...
God this game hurts to look at.
This developer should KYS.
One out, one out.
What do you mean gamma? Do I have something?
This play capture? Do I have like a filter on my...
Where's the gamma? What gamma are you talking about? There's no gamma.
The developer should kiss his sister.
Turn your brain around, do you hate it so much?
Like, huh?
Is that better? Is that what you want?
Thank you for the pet.
Okay, I'm as the same thing as Brainus, but I feel like this is too dark.
I'm really blind, man.
Okay.
Let me see what he does.
Where do you go? Back in here.
Okay, okay.
Nothing is brighter than your smile, oh you.
Nothing may be bright and OBS.
Like my display capture doesn't have any gamma filters or anything.
Yeah, of course I fucking love the dislike, are you kidding me?
What's the fucking effort into your walkthrough?
It's not that hard.
Wait, what?
The wrong direction?
If you could just watch the rest of the playthrough?
Okay, oh shit.
This is when mommy chases me.
Okay, if I get stuck here with mommy, I'm gonna...
I will end, right?
I asked you to play fair and you cheated.
Great cheaters.
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
One last game.
Okay.
Hide and...
Stay.
Fuck.
Ten.
Nine.
God, the way she goes crazy is so sexy.
I hate her before but her voice is so hot.
Am I actually supposed to hide?
I'll just run? Okay.
I'll just run.
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.
I feel like it's really suspiciously quiet.
Oh, come on now.
Did I go the wrong direction?
Okay, wait, I'm pausing.
What did I do wrong?
What did I do wrong this time?
Did I go the wrong direction?
Up?
Hello, you silent when I'm crazy?
You can go listen to me be crazy if you want.
There should be a handle.
Stop saying I'm mine.
Okay, look up where?
Look up where?
Where is the up?
Where is the up?
You have to pull yourself off while she passes by.
I feel like I'm just walking towards her now.
Here?
Wait, what? Am I?
I think therefore I'm mine.
Go back?
Is there some sort of timer?
I was doing it right the first time?
Oh.
Okay, and now she's going to chase me through this?
Get back to me!
Okay, okay.
I feel like I should be getting chased right now.
There's no urgency here.
Should I do all of these?
Put the figure in a jiffy.
Put the figure in a jar.
There's an order.
I'm guessing it's...
Red, yellow, blue, green.
Red, yellow, blue, green.
A common tactic in this game when stuck is to look up.
What do I do here now?
Wait, wasn't there a voltage thing?
Tab?
This one?
That's a train call.
Numbers?
Look under?
Numbers.
Numbers.
Numbers, what do they mean?
Numbers!
Okay, goodbye.
It's just the order of the numbers.
Numbers?
The wires? The numbers and the wires?
There's numbers and wires?
Numbers?
Pull up, check the numbers.
The numbers.
Two, one.
Is it one, three, two?
Is that the order?
There's numbers, yeah.
Look at the numbers on the boxes, yeah.
Let's tell you what color lover to pull.
So red, red, red, green, blue?
Red, blue, you guys are telling me different colors.
Red, red, blue, green.
Red, blue, green.
Red, blue, green.
Did I do it?
Wait, red, blue, green, yellow.
Yellow, where's yellow?
There's no yellow.
Where are you seeing yellow?
Fucking, stop saying I'm mine!
Yellow last?
But there's no yellow here.
Okay, red, red, blue.
Oh, there is a yellow!
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Red, red, blue, green, yellow, okay.
Okay, red, blue, green, yellow.
Yay!
Oh my god, I love not being stuck in video games.

Oh, fuck!
Let me turn the sound down a little.
Isn't he wonderful?
I'm still not excited for chapter three.
Okay.
Okay, I can do this. We're almost done.
Right, right, right, right, right. We're almost done after this.
This is it, right? This is like the last chase, right?
Please say yes. Please say yes. Say yes.
To me? Please say yes.
I feel like that bear was there on purpose, isn't it?
To fuck you over.
Laugh isn't really sexy anymore.
I don't want to play with you anymore. You're not sexy.
She legit sounds like she's painfully gagging on something.
Yeah, gagging on my dick!
It's not a skill issue. It's a game issue.
They just have to fix their aim.
The game obviously is poorly optimized here.
If they can't pick up my perfectly aimed mouse cursor.
Gagging on the two-way check.
Come on! Did I walk into her?
Shut up! There's so much to gag on it.
It'll go so deep in your throat just you fucking wait.
Cough.
Okay.
I'll do it this time.
Your throat will be so sore.
Your dentist is gonna be like,
God damn, were you gagging on a fucking...
I don't know.
Were you gagging on Amy's dick last night?
Because that's the only cock that would be long enough to make such...
such damage to your throat.
I got it that time!
I fucking got it that time!
Too slow.
The dentist knows?
Yeah, there's like bruising at the back of your throat sometimes.
The dentist will know.
I'll make sure that throat is bruised up, baby.
Fuck this barrel!
No!
Get up you fucker with my craft!
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft...
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft...
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft.
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft, in my craft.
In my craft, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game,
In game, in game, I, I, I died in game.

My throat is literally killing me right now.
Oh.
Wait, I take a long time because I'm trying to.
I'm trying to ink correctly.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Okay, if I don't get it this time, I'm literally stopping.
And we'll finish it the next time.
I can't.
We'll finish the next time.
I didn't even see it.
I had it and I didn't even know.
I didn't know what I was doing.
How do people do this?
This is like way harder than the first chapter.
What do I do?
Please tell me what to do.
Please tell me what to do.
Why is it so slow?
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Die, bitch! Die!
I love seeing you in pain!
That's right scream for me!
Oh my god.
Okay, we did it.
Right?
Thank you for the head pass.
Oh.
Is this it?
Please tell me.
Please tell me.
That's it.
I know I'm so good at games.
Like, really, they should have considered that I might play this game and make it harder
because this was just too easy.
Hi, I fucking saved your life, bitch.
What?
Do I have to read that?
I can't read that.
Opening the control station.
Just pull both levers?
Oh.
Yeah, double fist that shit.
It's not working.
Slap, puppy?
Is that it?
Is that it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm so happy!
Oh my god, that was such an emotional roller coaster.
Where am I going?
You skipped a tape?
I don't fucking care.
Was it important?
Was it really important?
That thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.
Do I press buttons?
I'm confused.
Do I press the buttons?
Oh.
Oh, oh.
Oh, I have to make them the right colors.
Wait.
So this thing is red?
Okay.
The other thing is yellow.
The next thing is red.
Okay.
The last thing is blue.
Oh wait.
Oh, now I have to put them in the right order.
Red, yellow, red, blue.
Now what?
It's in the right order.
Hit the arrow to put them in the same order.
Yeah, they're in the same order.
Yeah.
Red, yellow, red, blue.
The color.
I've seen subscribers break their brains on this puzzle.
You understood it immediately?
Password three?
One, four, two, three.
How do I change the numbers?
But how do I change them?
Push them?
Punch them?
I can't click on it.
Huh.
Click on the faces?
Oh.
One, four, two, three.
Go.
Go.
Let's go.
Let's leave this.
Oh, is it going?
Yippee.
Re-game.
Red lever's a break?

Choo-choo.
Can I go choo-choo?
Choo-choo.
Choo-choo.
Yay.
Choo-choo.

Oh my god, I'm so tired.
Let's go.
I ran out of water again.
Phew.
Get applauded.
Get applauded.
Hm?
Ew.
Whoa.
What?

Sounds like me?
Time to figure out what's happening.
Hm?
I'm not good at copying voices like Chibi.
What?
Hm?
Hm?
What happened?
What happened?
Why is it going faster?
Where are we going?
Why are we going so fucking fast?
Are we tilting?
Are we getting tilted right now?
Get tilted.
I feel like something bad is going to happen.
Hm?
What do I do?
Do-do.
We're going to die.
Stop train.
I can't.
No brakes.
No brakes on the train.
It's not going to work.
My hand.
Don't rip my hand off.
Oh, that was it, wasn't it?
Playcare?
Never mind playcare.
I need some fucking aftercare after getting fucked in the ass so hard.
We did it.
We did it.
We did it.
We did it.
We did it.
We did it.

No, I already have something planned for chapter 3.

Maybe the week after that we can do chapter 3.
There's Jacks but I see Big Spider.
Yeah, I did it.

Is that it?
There's not like other-
Shut up.
It is not story early for another horror game.
I can't.
My mind is-
I've been mind broken.
What do you want as a reward?
A shower.
A shower.
We can shower together as a reward.
A shower and a cough drop and some tea.
That's what I want as a reward.
Yeah, together.
Quit.

I'm fucking blinking like a fucking frog right now.
I usually only-
Okay, that's really distracting.
I usually only stream for two hours.
But I guess we were here for the long run.
Thank you so much for coming and staying
and helping me the whole time.
Encouraging me and praising me when I was going insane.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
I think it's going to be really funny and exciting.
Bye-bye.
I love you, big bro.
Bye-bye.
