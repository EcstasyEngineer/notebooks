00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
Could you survive living in France?

00:01.840 --> 00:04.160
Probably not, let's be honest, no foreigner could.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.680
They're unhinged over there.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.080
But let's test your French knowledge anyways.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.120
What is dobe?

00:09.920 --> 00:11.120
It means to stink.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.040
Come on, you should be familiar with that one.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.600
How about le toad à la naix?

00:16.480 --> 00:17.920
It means piece of cake.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.920
But if you were to directly translate it,

00:19.920 --> 00:21.600
it means to put your finger up your nose.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.000
I don't know how they got piece of cake from that.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.560
And finally, what is lâcher une caisse?

00:26.560 --> 00:27.360
It means to fart.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.760
And now you're a real Frenchie.

00:29.760 --> 00:30.800
Good luck out there.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.880
And don't be scared, they can smell your fear.
