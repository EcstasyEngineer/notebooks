1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,600
music

2
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:04,280
Hello, hi, hello, hello, welcome, huh, ah, sorry, okay, I'm going to be a little, little

3
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:13,960
energy today, um, I don't know, it's just been a tiring day, I don't know why, um, but

4
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:25,240
thank you for coming to the stream, um, I have a thing to talk about, um, um, um, let me find it, hold on,

5
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:36,840
um, what is my thing, what did I want to talk about, this is what I wanted to talk about,

6
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:46,040
um, I have a new ASMR up, so if you didn't watch it, there's a link in chat, you should

7
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,960
watch it, um, here, I'll, should I pin it, no I'm too lazy to pin it, well there's a

8
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:01,480
fucking link, uh, watch it, I worked semi-hard on it, oh my headphones keep hitting the mic,

9
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:10,200
I worked semi-hard on it, I, um, I wanted to get a video out soon because my last ASMR was

10
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,360
eight days ago and that felt like it was getting a little long, so I, um, I just improved it, normally

11
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:25,160
I would want, I would write a script, but sometimes when I don't have time, um, I just improv it, um,

12
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,840
because, you know, it's easier, and also I wanted to say thank you so much for 100K views

13
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:38,200
on my ASMR, my cat girl ASMR collab with Kaifu, I haven't, I haven't told her that we got 100 views

14
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,000
yet, I don't know if she's been keeping up with the video, but that's so cool, it's so cool that we

15
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,560
got 100,000 views, that's, it was literally like the, it was the second video I made, and it was

16
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,480
the first video I guess I made without the help of like, um, anyone in Vila, because Strani, um,

17
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,200
scripted the first one, she scripted everyone's first video, so yeah, 100K is so cool, 1 million,

18
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,560
oh no, no, no, no, no, no, it won't get to 1 million probably, but it's cool that we got 100K,

19
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,200
I hope I get more videos that reach 100K views, I used to get them all the time, but that's because,

20
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,040
Yandere is like a really popular genre, and it's a popular niche, and I understand why it's a

21
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,520
popular niche, because I love it too, but now I'm doing like normal, normie stuff, so I don't know

22
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,680
if I can, I don't know if I can pretend to be normie enough to attract the other normies, you know?

23
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:45,720
We'll see, we'll see, um, make an ASMR where you beat us over the head with your rats, no, no I won't,

24
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:55,080
no, that's weird and not, it's not even Mimi, P.L.V. you're getting beat over the head with rats,

25
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:05,240
what do you mean? Cisclon is normie? Oh, is that you facing me? Sorry, I have my mic in a different

26
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,400
position today because I'm doing a hand cam, Cisclon isn't kind of normie, isn't like,

27
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:24,360
isn't, isn't, um, in sense like one of the most popular tags on corn, hub, c-c-c-c-corn, I'm talking

28
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:34,200
about corn right now, on the hub of corn, Yandere is overrated, don't say that in front of me,

29
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,720
don't say that in front of me, I like the genre, I like it, it's not overrated to me,

30
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:51,640
yeah it's very popular on the cob, it's not really, you know, I guess it is normie, I don't know,

31
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:04,520
anyways, um, let me switch over to hand cam, I forgot to change, okay,

32
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,040
that was on my speaker, sorry, thank you, I'm glad you liked it, oh something I wanted to do,

33
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:32,840
I completely forgot, fuck it, I'll do it right now, so I'm going to, I'm going to change,

34
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:44,680
how do I do this, I'm going to change the minimum for the text to speech,

35
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,120
um, yeah, I'm going to change the minimum, so for the tip for both of them, the new minimum

36
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:07,480
amount will be, is $5 okay, I think I'll change it to $5, hold on, minimum amount, no not minimum

37
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:14,520
to show, minimum for text to speech, like it'll still show up, um, and I can maybe still read it,

38
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,800
but um, I won't do text to speech, so minimum amount to trigger text to speech, I'll do $5,

39
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,320
because I understand that sometimes it can get a little spammy, and then um,

40
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,360
that's for the tip, and then I'm going to do the same for super chat too,

41
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:48,040
okay, sorry, my keyboard is far away from me, so I have to move, all right, there we go, I,

42
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,760
I hope that worked, if not I'll try to fix it again, thank you for the $1 anonymous,

43
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:02,120
is having it only read out the text of the text to speech and not the name or don't know amount,

44
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,680
would speed up each message, well it's just that like, I don't know, I feel like one dollar is

45
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,720
just too um, little, sorry, I'm like adjusting my mic, are you gay, why are you acting so gay,

46
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,440
thank you anonymous for the $5, it worked, okay, I'm there, now I changed my sound

47
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:33,000
out, so it's not coming out of my um, my speakers, and now I can go over to the hand cam,

48
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,480
most vtubers have a minimum for text to speech, yeah, yeah, um, that's my minimum now,

49
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,680
yeah it's, it's super easy to spam text to speech with just one dollar, um,

50
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
oh,

51
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm working on it, I'm working on it, oh wait, hold on, I didn't even turn on

52
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,520
the audio for the, there we go, why are you acting so gay, thank you for the $5,

53
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know, wait is that, is that an old one, wait, no, oh two people did the testing, oh,

54
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,960
what the fuck, or at least two anonymous,

55
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,440
anonymouses did the testing, I don't know, okay, well now the audio is on, so any

56
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,800
testing should be good, and you should hear it too, I heard the other one, I don't know,

57
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm confused, um, this should be the screen, okay, uh, over here, hi, okay, there we go,

58
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,560
testing on lower range, okay $4.99, thank you anonymous, it didn't say it, but it did say the

59
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,920
are you gay, should I remove that too, is that annoying, do you hate the are you gay,

60
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,600
here's my hands, they look a little dirty for some reason, I promise they're clean, I don't know,

61
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:12,920
gay, why are you acting so gay, anonymous tipped $5, lucky me, I found $5 in front of a

62
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,320
blind crippled homeless dude's pants in front of the grocery store, oh thank you so much,

63
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:29,880
oh, oh my, are you gay, why are you acting so gay, my cue well tipped $5, hi amy, just testing as well,

64
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,600
also did streams start early, I arrived at $5.58 and the stream was already well on its way,

65
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:45,000
uh-huh, we started early, we did, thank you for the $5, and thank you for stealing $5 from the

66
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,760
blind crippled homeless man's pants too, the blind and crippled don't deserve money, you should take

67
00:11:50,840 --> 00:12:00,200
it from them, your nails, two of your nails look shorter than the rest, ah, they literally broke,

68
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,160
it wasn't me, they broke, they, I swear it wasn't me, they broke, I don't know why,

69
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't know what happened, but they broke, it wasn't me, also look how gross they are, oh,

70
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,560
my aunt did them and she really wanted to cut my cuticles, but I was like, no, I don't want you

71
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,800
to cut my cuticles, like, that hurts, you know, and so she was like, okay sure, I won't cut your

72
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,560
cuticles instead, I'll just push them back, and I was like, oh, yeah, sure, just push it, also sorry

73
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,680
if the camera's shaky, it's because my, my um, my desk is shaky, that's why, but I was like, sure,

74
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,200
yeah, just push them back, that's fine, and then she grabs like a really sharp tool, and she just

75
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,200
fucking goes ham on them, and at some point she gets like, I guess frustrated with pushing them,

76
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,280
this is getting annoying, I might have to take my headphones off, she gets like frustrated with

77
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,720
pushing them back, and she literally just starts cutting them with like the blunt tool that she

78
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,400
was using to push them back, and it hurts so fucking much, uh, like at the end I was like,

79
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,840
fuck, I should have just asked her to cut it off, it probably would have hurt the same amount,

80
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,760
she was like fucking, like rubbing a blunt tool against my cuticles, it fucking hurt,

81
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,280
I work as a cashier, and y'all kept mentioning five dollars, and the customer had to pay five

82
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,440
thirty, and I asked if they were gay, you've been watching too many Emmy streams,

83
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,720
how dare anyone of her Emmy, it's, it's my aunt, she gets aunt privileges of hurting me,

84
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,880
also I have a cup of water, I'm drinking water right now, and it's got a peach, or no wait,

85
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:58,280
sorry, it's got a tulip on the um, on the cat, yeah, fancy,

86
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:11,960
and it's water instead of a monster, okay, so um right, we need the rats, oh we need the rats,

87
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,440
okay well maybe first we can decide on which, which plant to make, so that way I can set it up

88
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,600
before the rats come and mess everything up, which plant do you want, should I like put a pool,

89
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,760
okay maybe we'll make like only one set today, so um maybe I can do it like this,

90
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,880
okay so here's our three sets, um this is one, this is two, this is three, okay I'm gonna make a

91
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,920
pool, and you can choose which one we do, you just choose one, two, or three, okay, oops that's the

92
00:14:50,920 --> 00:15:13,160
wrong button, um pool, um start a pool, which, let go, set,

93
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:20,120

94
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,280
or three, start pool, there you go,

95
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,400
or top middle bottom, that works too, but one, two, three, that's easy too, okay I'm,

96
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:41,320
I didn't think of it that way, but like this one's like I don't know red and, and, and purple and uh

97
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,280
green, and then this one's blue, and this one's got a cactus and shit, how much for you to

109
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:27,080
I'm trying to make it look long, I don't think I have the right camera perspective to make it

110
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:36,360
look long, whatever, no, that looks stupid, fuck you, do it,

126
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:07,480
on YouTube than it does in my um, I don't know, one day we'll have good camera quality,

127
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:15,080
one of these days we'll have good camera quality, mark my words, it'll happen,

128
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,560
it looks great, here what if I like make it bigger,

129
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,040
like that, and then turn these off, and then make it big,

130
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know why it's such a weird shape, there, now you can see how gross and stained my um,

131

my computer thing is, my computer mat, it looks fine, oh well you have low standards,

132
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,720
you should, you should raise your standards for vtubers, what are you doing watching me,

133
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,960
go watch someone else with good quality streams, like I don't know,

134
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,640
let's start with the big one, no let's start with the little ones, oh there's two in this one,

135
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,920
that's why, okay, like stronty or something or like sheebie, they have good quality streams,

136
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,800
right, I don't have a lot of time to watch their streams, sorry I know the camera's really shaky,

137
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:30,760
thank you for watching all my streams and audios, the clock,

138
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,000
what do you mean thank you, thank you for watching them, and thank you for the $30,

139
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:47,480
okay, I'm gonna close, I'm gonna close this um, box so that the rats can't

140
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:56,120
kidnap the other parts of the other plants, they'll still try to but,

141
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,480
and then I'm gonna close this Tupperware so they can't kidnap those parts,

142
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:11,400
they're safe in here, okay, and I'll go get them, BRB, well they're right behind me,

143
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:27,320
there's not much BRB but you know,

144
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:40,920
okay, I have the fan favorite here, Esteban, now Esteban recently I just noticed like yesterday,

145
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,680
unfortunately she has a tumor, she has a mammary tumor, I made an appointment with the vet,

146
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,840
it's two weeks from now, that was the fastest they could get me in,

147
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,760
so she will be getting surgery as soon as possible to get it removed, but um yeah,

148
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,800
so don't be afraid if you see a lump, I don't think it's visible, here she is, she hates me,

149
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,640
she hates me, she hates being held, I don't really think it's visible but if you do see it,

150
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:15,560
don't worry, I know it's there, come here, come here, okay she's off camera, but yeah,

151
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,600
yeah they're super prone to tumors, I've had lots of raps with tumors already so I know it happens

152
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:33,560
and uh, it doesn't surprise me anymore

153
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:46,520
there's um

154
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,520
cute fingies always, can't stick around, sorry I can't hear the text this week,

155
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,040
I just wanted to say love ya Amy and hope you have a good stream, oh my god hopefully you

156
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:05,000

161
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,480
also thank you for becoming a pin pal demon seal, um hopefully the doctor helps, yeah

162
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,600
it should be fine, it's not, it doesn't look abnormal or anything, um

163
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,080
some tumors can be a little bit scary because they might be abnormal, this one looks pretty

164
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,040
normal though, so I, I'm not too worried, okay

165
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,640
didn't see anything Luna cute, they're quick, they don't like to be on camera all the time,

166
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,200
except for Esteban, apparently Esteban loves being on fucking camera, I had no clue,

167
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:20,360
um only face, I mean only rats, no face, okay good, good Dennis the menace, why did you write

168
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:32,200
menace as menus, Dennis the menus, okay, some of you guys may be a little bit too young to be

169
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:40,040
watching me if you don't know how to spell out menus, I mean menace, am I stupid, is this not

170
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:48,040
oh this is the pot, I kind of have an awkward angle here, um I don't have the best angle so

171
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,880
excuse me, she was born to be on camera, she's a little attention whore apparently, I was never

172
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:06,520
aware of that, she's a star, she was born to be a star, do you have your glasses on, yes I do,

173
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,360
I always have my glasses on, I always have to have my glasses on, I couldn't live my life

174
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,480
without my glasses, well I guess I could but I wouldn't be able to see anything, so yeah I do

175
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:42,840
have my glasses on, um I can't find, I can't find the next piece now, wait what the fuck

176
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,840
wait what the fuck

177
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,520
wait the next piece isn't in here, oh no it's in here I see it, I thought I was going crazy

178
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,400
immediately stuck on the third piece, bro you can't spell either, stock

179
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:21,000
immediately stuck on the first piece, no I don't deal with stocks,

180
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,520
we don't do stocks around here, not around here partner, not around here

181
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,640
this is going to be an endurance challenge, why, it's pretty chill so far

182
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
oh wait I'm supposed to put

183
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,080
we're chill, we're just chillin

184
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,800
rats already stole it, no they didn't, it's here, it's here

185
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,840
no I'm not stuck, shut up calm down, calm yourselves, calm yourselves

186
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,160
it's chill, maybe I'll even be able to get through more than one

187
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:18,360
I believe Lil sis can do this in a stream, easy peasy, you don't even have to believe

188
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:28,440
because it's going to happen, it's going to happen easily, anyways I don't know, we should

189
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:36,120
talk about something, what's the recent vtuber news, um, stocks vtubing agency girls I think

190
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:46,600
are debuting right now as we speak, which is cool, um, one of my friends I think auditioned

191
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,000
to stocks vtubing agency, I'm not sure, I'm not sure if she did or not to be honest, I can't

192
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,080
remember, I think she wanted to, um, I saw it, I saw their auditions and I was like

193
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,080
a meme or making a vtubing agency, what the fuck is going on here, thank you for the member,

194
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,200
I'm sure the typos are coming from phone posters, autocorrect must be the origin of the first I

195
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,440
am I, yeah probably, probably, I'm just shitting on them for it

196
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:29,240
do they show stocks, they do not show stocks, fork makes some of the craziest drawings, he does

197
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,040
but I was kind of like, like when I saw the auditions, because this was before I got into

198
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:42,040
the viewer, I was like, wait, why is he starting a vtubing agency, um, because he's a memeor,

199
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:49,320
right, I was like, what, did I put this in the wrong hole, I don't know, I was very confused,

200
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,000
I hope the girls do well though, and I hope the company does well too

201
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:07,160
don't let your dreams be memes, exactly, don't let your dreams just be memes,

202
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:14,840
if you want to start a vtubing agency, go ahead and do it, that's not true, don't do it,

203
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,120
don't, don't, don't do it, um, I remember Strani, she told me, she's like,

204
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,920
Amy, Amy, whatever you do, don't ever start a vtubing agency, she was like, don't,

205
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:37,560
don't start a vtuber agency, Amy, I'm guessing it's a lot of stress, yeah, don't,

206
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,320
yeah, stay a big brother, don't start a vtubing agency,

207
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,000
my dream is to marry little sis, don't let your dreams just be dreams, it'll happen,

208
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,880
don't you worry, it'll happen,

209
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,280
though I don't really want to get married like in front of people,

210
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:11,080
my dream marriage is just to like order Uber Eats and lots of wine, and like, I don't know,

211
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,160
party alone together, and like, preferably do all the paperwork through mail,

212
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:28,680
but I don't know if that is possible, ah, no, okay, I was scared a rat was gonna get it,

213
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,680
cause it fell down, a classy woman, yep, a courthouse marriage, not even courthouse,

214
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,040
don't even, I don't even want to go in the courthouse, a home marriage, can we just call

215
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:48,520
the courthouse via zoom and do it that way, can that, can that work, same weddings are

216
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,040
expensive and boring, I mean, it's not to like, I don't want to shit on girls that, that want to do

217
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:03,080
weddings, cause you know, it's like, I don't understand, I don't understand this one,

218
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,240
it's a lot of people's dreams to have really cool weddings and I don't want to shit on people's

219
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:21,000
dreams, I just wouldn't be able to plan one, I feel like that's too stressful for me,

220
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,040
and there's too many eyes and there's too many people on me, like, all the people staring at

221
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,960
you, I, I don't want my family to see me be like, lovey-dovey with someone else either,

222
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,000
that's like, kind of cringe to me and scary, like I don't want my family to know that I have like

223
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,680
feelings and stuff, you know, tell the court we have COVID, yeah, and gotta isolate at home,

224
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,520
but want to wed anyways, yeah, exactly, that's what we'll tell them, we got gold, we got scurvy,

225
00:32:52,520 --> 00:33:02,120
we need some vitamin C, yeah, totally good, moderators, are you banned for Russian vocabulary,

226
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:12,680
what, moderators or have you been banning the Russians, I mean please use English in chats,

227
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,840
so if you're not using English in chat, that's a good reason,

228
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,760
it's hard to be vulnerable in front of others, yeah, exactly, I don't want to be vulnerable in

229
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:33,160
front of people, so that's why I wouldn't want a big, a big, big, big, crazy wedding and stuff,

230
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:45,800
you know, Russians in chat, I can smell them, there's a Russian nearby, oops that's not the

231
00:33:45,800 --> 00:34:01,480
right thing, wedding sounds too much to dress up and prepare for, that too, that too, it's a lot,

232
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:08,520
it's a lot of stuff to do, I kind of want to watch like SpongeBob or something while doing this,

233
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,040
wait how, fuck, I think I did this wrong,

234
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,560
how shaky is the camera right now, I feel like it's constantly shaking a little bit,

235
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,040
I think it is,

236
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,440
oh whatever,

237
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,400
I simply yell, I object that every wedding you, oh simply yell, I object that every,

238
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,680
chat's going too fast, hold on, at every wedding you attend so that no one invites you anymore,

239
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,920
I've never been invited to a wedding before though, so it doesn't matter, yeah it has been not a lot,

240
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,640
um,

241
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,080
sorry I'm just tightening the camera, yeah that probably didn't do anything, whatever,

242
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,640
and this one goes this way, maybe,

243
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,040
me's hands are giving us the shakes, if I ever get married can I invite you,

244
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,040
what do you mean, if you ever get married I'd already be there because I'd be the bride,

245
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,360
can I invite you,

246
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,640
what am I doing wrong,

247
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,640
I don't understand what am I doing wrong,

248
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,240
oh there we go,

249
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,000
you mean a wedding dress, never, you'll never see it, it'll never happen,

250
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,040
there we go,

251
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:21,080
still debating on whether or not to invite the bride to my wedding,

252
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:30,680
that reminds me of Icy's um, that reminds me of Icy's uh, clip of her marrying all her,

253
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:40,920
all her snowberries, if you haven't seen um, some of the, the vtuber clip or made a clip of Icy and

254
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:49,240
they'd like, made an edit, a photoshop edit of her like marrying all her snowberries,

255
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,480
and there was a bunch of guys in a line,

256
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,240
there was a bunch of guys in a line, um,

257
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,120
waiting to marry, Icy is this wrong, yes it is wrong,

258
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:13,160
I think all the rats just went back into their cage, they were done with me, is that it,

259
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,280

279
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:10,760
fuck, it was the Nijisanji thing where like, two of their VTubers were kind of um,

280
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,640
in a dispute I guess, because um,

281
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,960
because one of them was like copying the other girl's like voice and way of speaking, I forgot,

282
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,640
do you know what I'm talking about though,

283
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:41,320
Roa, yeah, Mero and Roa, Roa, fucking hell, Roa, I just finished watching that story,

284
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,760
wait, is this the right one, oh it's on the outside,

285
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:55,640
and how, was it Roa who stopped streaming, that's old like 2021, I know but like,

286
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,440
I had to catch up okay, I had to, I had to catch up on the news, yeah,

287
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,000
yeah she's been on hiatus for years, probably because of that I'm guessing,

288
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,720
I kind of live under a rock unless it's related to you, that's okay, that's how it should be,

289
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:27,560
but if you guys got any like, almost like the shy lily situation, oh dude,

290
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:36,440
the shy lily situation, I feel so bad for shy lily, man, if you don't know that situation,

291
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I'll explain it because apparently, apparently you, you live under a rock and you're not obsessed

292
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,880
with drama like I am, obsessed with other people's drama, okay, not obsessed with my own drama,

293
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,320
we stay out of drama here, but we like to listen to other people's drama, it's because my life

294
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,600
is so boring, I need, I need other people's drama to like fill in, fill in the blank spots, you know,

295
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,640
but if you don't know, a vtuber was like accused of

296
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:17,960
copying shy lily's design and copying shy lily's voice

297
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,960
and kind of everyone on twitter and probably other social medias too went on like a witch hunt of her,

298
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,960
what are your guys thoughts about that and then they even pressured shy lily into responding to

299
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:43,160
yeah, small lola, her name was small lola, give me your thoughts, give me your thoughts and opinions

300
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:56,840
and I'll read them, fuck, let me open this, it's a little ironic that she used to face the same

301
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:03,480
allegations herself before, oh yeah, didn't, wasn't shy lily accused of copying um, I don't remember

302
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:16,200
her name, vey, vey, vey, vey's um, voice, right, most of the vtubers are, most of the vtubers are

303
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,360
pretty cringe and it's not my jam, oh fuck, I have to scroll up, but I like vealer because you girls

304
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,160
are cool, cool and pretty funny and you guys most importantly of all are genuine and I respect that

305
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:35,160
I feel like we're not that much different from other vtubers but I'm glad you like us

306
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:41,160
but you should check out other vtubers too, most of them are pretty normal, at least if you like

307
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,880
go the, oh my god my voice is cracking so much, if you go the indie route and find like smaller

308
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:58,440
ones, they're mostly normal, mostly, no thoughts, don't care about it, fair

309
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,920
there was a time when shirley, oh yeah, yeah when she was compared to vey, but yeah, it's not nice

310
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,880
to pressure the main person to make some sort of statement when they don't want to, but to not

311
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,160
bother, yeah that's true, I feel really bad because like no matter what she says, what she says,

312
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,280
people are gonna come after her for it, you know, thank you for becoming a pinpell silver

313
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,880
it's fine to use her as inspiration but lola should have known people would point out the

314
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,400
similarity so she should have put more effort into differentiating herself to avoid trauma

315
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:34,840
true

316
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:51,240
true, the veal or drama are gonna go crazy, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think so,

317
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,280
I don't know, what do you guys think we would get into drama for, something crazy, I remember people

318
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:02,360
on twitter before we even debuted, they were like, I can't wait until all these whores get accused of

319
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:09,960
grooming, I don't know, I feel like we wouldn't get into drama for that, that's like, nah

320
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,800
I'm missing more stuff

321
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:28,280
this one, this one, this one, one, two, three, four, one, two, one, two, one, two,

322
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:37,160
murder, the critical video on image drama, that'd be hilarious, I'd be the first to watch that one

323
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,080
getting banned on youtube for live orgasms

324
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:55,160
what, what, that's crazy, none of us would ever do that, that's crazy

325
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,960
I feel like one weird toy that has to get viral and the normies will point out that loli and

326
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:10,440
win says, possible, possible, possible, maybe not because of you guys doing something bad,

327
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,200
but some other models throwing shade at you, like seeking out trouble

328
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,600
is it even grooming if we know and accept getting groomed?

329
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:31,720
but no, I think, I don't know, maybe they met like the other kind of grooming, like the grooming of

330
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:43,960
minors, what am I doing, what am I doing, I don't understand

331
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:50,840
do you just eat illegal?

332
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,480
no, that one wasn't obvious, oh my god, I actually put it in my mouth, I didn't mean to do that

333
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:07,160
it was gonna be the trace of you, my thoughts on, my bets are on, no I'm kidding, I'm not

334
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:15,160
betting on anyone, no one, no one, I'm just joking, no, no, we wouldn't get into drama

335
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:26,040
the children yearn for the minds, we wouldn't get into drama, we're nice and wholesome

336
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:34,200
what, I'll like this, okay and then do that twice

337
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,480
sis chokes on Legos and fucking dies, that's our drama, we choke on Legos and die

338
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:54,840
the bad girls spit out the Legos, there you go, I spat it out

339
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,200
I mean when you get popular you'll eventually get drama if only because of the corn is bad

340
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:22,920
people, but it is what it is, that's possible, that is possible, yeah

341
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,040
if you keep trying to eat the Legos, Big Bro will have to take them away from you,

342
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:41,320
just try and stop me, I will store them, oh wait, no yeah, I will store them in my mouth and you'll

343
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:53,160
never find them, I think I did this wrong, this doesn't look right, that doesn't look the same

344
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,960
what

345
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:13,640
what

346
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,640
Ahem.

347
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
Stir them up, my ass.

348
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,640
What's the context here?

349
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,640
Ah, we're talking about drama.

350
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,640
What would Vilaer get into drama for?

351
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,640
Okay, this was right from the start.

352
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,640
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?

353
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,640
That would be a cute one to make.

354
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
Okay, I figured out what I did wrong.

355
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Thank you for the five dollars.

356
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,640
You'll have to put a finger up and search on my butt for the lego-

357
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,640
Oh my god. I'm gonna shit on your hand.

358
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,640
I'm gonna poop all over your hand.

359
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,640
Yup, that's what I'll do.

360
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,640
Don't test me. I'll do it.

361
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,640
I'll shit all over your hand and you'll never touch my butt again.

362
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,640
There we go. Now I got it right.

363
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,640
We have been suffering from an intense lack of rats.

364
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Ah fuck, I have to do it twice more?

365
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,640
Even suffering from an intense lack of rats in this stream, I'm sorry.

366
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,640
They come out when they want to and I guess right now they don't want to come out.

367
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,640
No shitting on my fingers.

368
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:59,640
Vilaer drama would be something like they get drunk and forgot to close OBS and pull a dark side fill.

369
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,640
But you can see what they go into.

370
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,640
Wait, what happened to dark side fill?

371
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,640
Can't wait until Amy starts fistfighting her chin, right?

372
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,640
I would never.

373
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,640
But if I did, I would win for sure.

374
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,640
Wacked it on stream, jorked it live?

375
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,640
Oh shit.

376
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,640
I wouldn't know.

377
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,640
I'm not that horny that I just pulled down my pants and jork it right after streaming.

378
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,640
Okay, that's not true.

379
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Most of the time, most of the time, I don't, I don't.

380
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,640
That's crazy.

381
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,640
Wrestling match? Oh my god, we should do a 3D wrestling match.

382
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,640
That would be funny.

383
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,640
That would be so funny.

384
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,640
We need to get together in real life for that though.

385
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,640
Dang it.

386
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,640
She's zirking it live on stream.

387
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,640
Vilaer drama would be when someone does a Twitter space and thinks they ended the space and then they say they hate their fans.

388
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Oh my god.

389
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,640
That would be, that would be the drama.

390
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,640
He jorked it on stream seven years ago.

391
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
Poor dude will never live that down.

392
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,640
Well hey, maybe it got him some fans, you know?

393
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,640
Maybe it got him some fans.

394
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,640
It got him some attention, you know?

395
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,640
I don't, I don't know.

396
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
He got something, something out of it, right?

397
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,640
Vilaer mud wrestling off collab?

398
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,640
No, it would, it would be a, it wouldn't be mud wrestling.

399
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,640
Why, naked mud wrestling?

400
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,640
No, no, no.

401
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,640
It would be real wrestling.

402
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,640
In a wrestling rink and everything.

403
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,640
And Strani would be like the microphone person, you know?

404
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,640
The newscaster?

405
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,640
No, that's not right.

406
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,640
Wait, this isn't right.

407
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,640
Wait, what?

408
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,640
Wait, what?

409
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,640
Oh.

410
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,640
Yeah, like WWE wrestling.

411
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,640
Commentator, yeah, the commentator.

412
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,640
That's where she would be.

413
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Lube wrestling? No.

414
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,640
I could be, I could wear the rat suit.

415
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,640
I guess, maybe.

416
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,640
But it would, wait.

417
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,640
Oops, I put this one wrong.

418
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Come on.

419
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,640
Here we go.

420
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,640
It would be in like 3D.

421
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,640
So I would have to get a...

422
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,640
I would have to get an outfit

423
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,640
of a rat suit in 3D.

424
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,640
Oh, I put this on the other way.

425
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Okay, that's why.

426
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,640
Man, these things are so confusing.

427
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,640
Man, these things are so confusing for

428
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,640
stupid me.

429
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,640
Nacho Libre.

430
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,640
What's Nacho Libre?

431
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,640
Is that a wrestler?

432
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,640
Remy?

433
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,640
Why would you...

434
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,640
Oh, Remy, for like,

435
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,640
for like a...

436
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,640
What's the guy's name around?

437
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,640
Remy?

438
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,640
Oh my god.

439
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Remy the wrestler.

440
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,640
And my signature move

441
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,640
can be the rim job.

442
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,640
Okay.

443
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Uh...

444
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,640
Okay.

445
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,640
Oh, there we go.

446
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,640
I finished the pot.

447
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,640
Let's go.

448
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,640
Yay.

449
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,640
Remy Bezu.

450
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,640
I don't even know what's a rim job.

451
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,640
Oh, you don't...

452
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,640
You don't know?

453
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,640
You don't know what a rim job is?

454
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,640
Should I explain to you what a rim job is?

455
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,640
Would you like to know?

456
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,640
Would you like to learn?

457
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,640
He doesn't know?

458
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,640
You want me to enlighten you?

459
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,640
Oh, fuck. Alright.

460
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,640
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

461
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,640
Okay, I didn't warn you.

462
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,640
A rim job, you see,

463
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,640
is when you have the,

464
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,640
you know, the donut hole here.

465
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,640
Oh, you finished the donut hole.

466
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,640
You got the donut hole.

467
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,640
You got the donut hole,

468
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,640
and you just, um,

469
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,640
play with it

470
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,640
with your, but with your mouth.

471
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,640
Yeah.

472
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
I'm being gross, sorry.

473
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,640
Yeah, when you, when you,

474
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,640
your tongue punch it,

475
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,640
and you can make it bigger.

476
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,640
Okay, whatever, whatever.

477
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,640
Next, next, next.

478
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,640
Next, next step.

479
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,640
We're almost done. That's surprising.

480
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,640
I'm getting mega hot in this room, though,

481
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,640
because I'm wearing your sweater.

482
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,640
Pacific Rim.

483
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,640
Is that a video game? I think that's a video game, right?

484
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,640
But, but there's poop in there.

485
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,640
Kachan, but there's poop in,

486
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,640
I just spat all over my face.

487
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,640
But, but Kachan,

488
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,640
there's poop in there.

489
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,640
It's fine.

490
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,640
Just do it, Deku.

491
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Oh, no, that's not right.

492
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,640
Oh, there he is.

493
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,640
What is it asking me to do?

494
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,640
But I poop in there.

495
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,640
You,

496
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,640
you don't want my poop, do you?

497
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,640
Oh, what?

498
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,640
I'm getting so confused.

499
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,640
How do I do this? Oh, fuck.

500
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,640
Do you think Deku's gonna like

501
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,640
his new job at McDonald's? Wait, what do you mean?

502
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,640
What is that referencing?

503
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,640
Are you getting

504
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,640
tired of my poop jokes?

505
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,640
Do you hate me in my poop jokes?

506
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,640
I think they're funny.

507
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,640
You think the green lego tastes,

508
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
you think the green lego

509
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,640
tastes like green apple?

510
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,640
I don't know.

511
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,640
Let's see if it does.

512
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Lego tastes testing.

513
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,640
No, not really.

514
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,640
It kind of tastes more like

515
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,640
microplastics.

516
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,640
Is that right?

517
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,640
They managed to get there so straight.

518
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,640
Why is mine so not straight?

519
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,640
My hand is starting to hurt

520
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,640
from this.

521
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,640
I'll taste the same.

522
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,640
Conspiracy theory.

523
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,640
It's like when they try to trick us into thinking

524
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,640
fruit loops all tasted the same.

525
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,640
I mean, no. It's like when they try to

526
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,640
trick us into thinking fruit loops all tasted

527
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,640
differently, but in reality they all tasted

528
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,640
the same.

529
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,640
These

530
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,640
capitalist corporate scammers

531
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,640
thinking we're

532
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,640
stupid,

533
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,640
thinking we're not going to notice that all

534
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,640
the legos taste the same.

535
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,640
I did this wrong, didn't I?

536
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,640
That's a mega plastic?

537
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,640
Well, I'll turn it into

538
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,640
a microplastic once it enters my mouth.

539
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,640
And I crush it up.

540
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Everyone knows that just like crayons,

541
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,640
the red one tastes the best.

542
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,640
I don't know.

543
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,640
Wait, what the fuck? Oh, I'm messing it up.

544
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,640
What does your mouth taste like?

545
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,640
It tastes like I haven't brushed my teeth in the past

546
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,640
12 hours. That's what it tastes like.

547
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,640
You want to taste it?

548
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,640
Here we go.

549
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,640
Does Amy bite her nails? No.

550
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
They just broke off because they're long.

551
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,640
They broke off.

552
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,640
And they broke off very conveniently.

553
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,640
Very conveniently.

554
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,640
Mm-hmm, plaque.

555
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,640
Activated elements.

556
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,640
What's an activated element?

557
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,640
I have not licked the switch cartridges.

558
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,640
No.

559
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,640
But I kind of want to try.

560
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,640
Would you encourage me to lick the switch cartridges

561
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,640
if you were here with me?

562
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,640
I feel like I don't want to...

563
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,640
I don't want to break any of my video games,

564
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,640
so I'm kind of worried

565
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,640
about licking the switch cartridges,

566
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,640
but maybe

567
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,640
I would be open to licking a DS cartridge

568
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,640
because I have a lot of DS games that I don't care about.

569
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,640
Would you want to play a DS game with me ever?

570
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,640
There was one point in time...

571
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,640
Fuck.

572
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,640
There was one point in time

573
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,640
where I was really, really committed

574
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,640
into doing, um...

575
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
Um...

576
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,640
What's it called?

577
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,640
A speedrun

578
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,640
of this one really niche

579
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
DS game.

580
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,640
So that way I could be on the speedrun

581
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,640
record website

582
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,640
because, like, the one person who,

583
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,640
you know, speedran this DS game

584
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
because no one else fucking plays

585
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
this random ass DS game.

586
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
But I never fucking ended up doing it.

587
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,640
I think I'd want to do it with you, maybe.

588
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,640
I think it'd be really fun

589
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,640
to, like, speedrun a game with me,

590
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,640
except it wouldn't even be a speedrun.

591
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,640
It would just be a regular playthrough

592
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,640
because, um, no one else has speedrun the game,

593
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,640
so I can basically go at whatever pace I want

594
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,640
because no matter how slow I go,

595
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,640
it'll still be the record for that website.

596
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,640
Is it called speedrun.com

597
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,640
or something like that? I think it is.

598
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,640
What if there's someone already on the leaderboard?

599
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,640
No, it's a really niche game.

600
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,640
There was, like,

601
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,640
one person on the leaderboard

602
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,640
for one of the game modes,

603
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,640
but for the regular game mode,

604
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,640
there was no one on the leaderboard.

605
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,640
The only problem is if I,

606
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,640
like, stream myself speedrunning it,

607
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,640
um, someone else is going to be like,

608
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,640
oh, I'm going to beat her.

609
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,640
I have the game, I'm going to beat her, you know?

610
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,640
DSR Childhood.

611
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,640
It's my childhood.

612
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,640
For most people, it's not their childhood.

613
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,640
Their childhood is, like, I don't know,

614
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,640
the fucking SNES

615
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,640
or the GameCube or something.

616
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,640
A lot of people use that technique.

617
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,640
Just take advantage of the fact that nobody else

618
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,640
has bothered to speedrun

619
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,640
Tomba 2 or some shiz, yeah.

620
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,640
And it's 64. That one too, yeah.

621
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,640
That one too.

622
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,640
And Game Boy, yeah, that one too.

623
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,640
I grew up with Pictochat too.

624
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,640
Oh shit, my phone's gonna die.

625
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,640
Mm-hmm, PlayStation 2.

626
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,640
Yes, PlayStation.

627
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,640
All of those.

628
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,640
All of those games

629
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,640
are a lot of people's childhoods.

630
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,640
Mine was mostly the DS.

631
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,640
I was poor and had an SNES

632
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,640
when all my friends had an N64.

633
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,640
Oh please, what's the difference?

634
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,640
I don't know.

635
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,640
But at least you have something, you know?

636
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,640
You have a...

637
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,640
You still have a console.

638
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,640
Oh no, I gotta twist it like this.

639
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
Um...

640
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,640
Wait, how do I twist it?

641
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,640
Oh.

642
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,640
Like that.

643
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,640
And then like this.

644
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,640
And then like this.

645
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,640
Um...

646
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,640
Oh.

647
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,640
Oh, this is hard to do.

648
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,640
Why does mine not look as twisty as theirs?

649
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,640
What am I doing wrong?

650
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,640
Huh?

651
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,640
Oh, there we go.

652
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,640
Mine doesn't look as twisty as theirs.

653
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,640
3D models to pixels in me?

654
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,640
What does that mean?

655
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,640
What does that mean? What do you mean by that?

656
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,640
Are you comparing the different game consoles?

657
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,640
Ah!

658
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,640
I just spilled a bunch of

659
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,640
freaking Lego pieces, fuck.

660
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,640
No, I spilled one and it's gone!

661
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,640
Fuck!

662
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,640
Oh shit, I don't see it anywhere.

663
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,640
No!

664
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,640
Oh wait, I found it.

665
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,640
I hope that was the only one.

666
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,640
I don't know if any more fell.

667
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,640
Ugh.

668
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,640
The rats have made their presence known.

669
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,640
Nah.

670
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,640
I don't think they want to come out.

671
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,640
N64 has

672
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,640
early 3D polygons.

673
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,640
The SNES was 64 bit.

674
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,640
Oh!

675
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,640
Yeah, see, I didn't know that.

676
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,640
My cousins had a genesis

677
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,640
in older consoles like SNES.

678
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640
Mmm.

679
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,640
What's a genesis?

680
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
What is a genesis?

681
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,640
Oop.

682
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,640
Sega.

683
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,640
Sega!

684
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,640
Okay, I see.

685
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,640
Imi.

686
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,640
What do you mean, Imi?

687
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,640
Genesis is Mega Drive? What's a fucking Mega Drive?

688
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,640
Mega Drive.

689
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,640
Oh, I'm done.

690
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,640
I'm done this one.

691
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,640
I'm turning into dust.

692
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,640
Showing your normies' roots?

693
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,640
What?

694
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,640
Is it because I don't know all these, all these, um,

695
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,640
these games?

696
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,640
Game systems?

697
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,640
Here's the next one.

698
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,640
There we go, there's the other one.

699
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,640
It looks pretty close to the original.

700
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Right? That looks about right.

701
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,640
I feel so old now.

702
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,640
You're such a zoomer? I am a zoomer.

703
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,640
Sorry, I'm covering the camera.

704
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,640
I am a zoomer, yeah.

705
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,640
There it is.

706
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,640
Two down.

707
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,640
My childhood games were like,

708
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,640
Mario Kart.

709
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,640
Keep in mind though, I didn't get, um,

710
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,640
I didn't get a DS until I was like,

711
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,640
Ah shit, how old was I?

712
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,640
I don't remember.

713
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,640
I don't remember.

714
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,640
I want to say I didn't get a DS

715
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,640
until like,

716
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,640
like seventh grade,

717
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,640
maybe? Sixth grade?

718
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,640
Maybe like six,

719
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,640
six or seventh grade?

720
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,640
So, um,

721
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,640
yeah,

722
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,640
maybe seventh grade.

723
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,640
How old are you in seventh grade?

724
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,640
I don't know.

725
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,640
How old are you in seventh grade?

726
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,640
Twelve?

727
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,640
Are you twelve in seventh grade?

728
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,640
Twelve, yeah.

729
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,640
Yeah.

730
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,640
I didn't have much experience with consoles or anything.

731
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,640
Um, okay.

732
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,640
Okay, now I need the last.

733
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,640
I need this one.

734
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,640
They give you extra pieces.

735
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,640
That's nice.

736
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,640
Okay, so it's okay that I dropped some.

737
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,640
Oh, by then I was playing with 3DS.

738
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,640
Yeah, the 3DS had come out, but

739
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,640
I only got the regular one.

740
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,640
Snack time.

741
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,640
I want some snacks.

742
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,640
Some, some variety pack.

743
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,640
Yum, yum, yum.

744
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,640
Yum, yum.

745
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,640
This one seems really big.

746
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,640
I don't know if I can do this one.

747
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,640
This one seems like a lot.

748
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,640
Should I?

749
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,640
This one's a lot.

750
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,640
Maybe I should take a quick break and then I'll continue.

751
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,640
Okay, I'm going to take a quick break.

752
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,640
Um, this one's like the biggest one, right?

753
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,640
I'm going to take a quick break and then I'll continue.

754
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,640
This is where it starts.

755
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,640
Alright, I'll be back in like, uh,

756
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,640
five minutes.

757
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,640
Maybe maximum ten.

758
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,640
But I think five.

759
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,640
Okay?

760
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,640
Okay, baby.

761
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,640
Let's go.

762
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,640
Let's go.

763
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,640
Let's go.

764
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,640
Let's go.

765
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,640
Let's go.

766
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,640
Let's go.

767
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,640
Let's go.

768
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,640
Let's go.

769
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,640
Let's go.

770
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,640
Let's go.

771
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,640
Let's go.

772
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,640
Let's go.

773
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Let's go.

774
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,640
Let's go.

775
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,640
Let's go.

776
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,640
I'm back.

777
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,640
Let's go.

778
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,640
Let's go.

779
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,640
I'm back.

780
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,640
little bit cooler and

781
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,560
I fanned myself with two fans this one included

782
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:09,080
Oh, now you can see the fan and you can see that I'm not using anything that's vibrating and it's literally just a fan

783
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,960
It doesn't make the fan sound I

784
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,200
Should like fan my chest here

785
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:27,600
That's nice get underneath there. Oh my god imagine if I showed oh my god if I lean forward too much

786
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,240
Should I do it?

787
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,640
I'm not wearing a shirt. I'm just wearing a sweater. I'm not wearing a shirt. That'd be crazy

788
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:43,160
Hey, Amy, I'm going to an oddity festival tomorrow and they have a rat taxidermy class. Should I take it?

789
01:20:43,160 --> 01:21:01,000
Should I lean forward a little? Should I? I want to now. It is bueno, yeah

790
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:09,080
Someone got me like a really big pack of bueno because I tweeted out that I want chocolate when I wake up from my nap and I did it

791
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,160
No, I won't do it

792
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,400
See you say you say bless us, but like

01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,280
Okay, that's not my tits. That's just the sweater

799
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,160
Don't worry. It's not my boobs. It's the sweater

01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,040
Ah fuck I need to look there you get you can get that

Yeah, everyone's calling me flat because they want me to say no and try to prove them wrong, right?

803
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,640
You want me to be like, ooh, I'm not flat and then whip out my tits

804
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:57,400
Just to prove you wrong. Well, it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:08,040
How long is that pee I don't know I need pee I don't know

Just

858
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,800
Unzip all the way. There's no point in unzipping all the way

859
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,200
I'm wearing like a really old sports bra

860
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,360

Didn't know you guys were so desperate for just a little bit of a little tiny reveal

877
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:18,360
Did you miss something no you didn't miss anything nothing happens. We're still just building like those here

878
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,760
That's all you miss a single thing

879
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:27,560
What the fuck is this isn't all this stuff getting covered

880
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,960
Why do I need to put a wheel

881
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:48,080
The clip is spreading like wildfire in the fan discord it's okay. I

882
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,540
Hope that's allowed on YouTube. I didn't really do much. I

883
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,520
Didn't really do much

884
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:03,160
Watch my channel get fucking deleted because of that that would suck

885
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,560
No, I won't

886
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,800
Why are you calling what why are you calling them warlocks?

887
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,640

888
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,480
For what reason are you calling them warlocks? I

889
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:29,760
Can't find the last piece well not the last piece, but the next piece. I

890
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,920
Really don't like the sound of them clinking together

891
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,640
Is this it

892
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:43,920
There's a youtuber who plays piano in a bikini regular and she's still up that's true. I saw her she's really talented

893
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,840
Good for her. Is it in here? Oh

894
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,320
It's there, okay

01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,280
Am I the first girl to show a little bit of

896
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:11,480
Tiddage on stream, I think so unless she be did maybe she be did during her. I don't remember I wasn't there

897
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,360
Unfortunately, I wish I could watch more of the other girls, but

898
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:24,560
The only one I usually I'm able to catch as I see because she does it at a convenient time for me

899
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,680
I'm like shaking now because I was so nervous

900
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,960
Thank you for the $400

901
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,960
Oh

902
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,560
I'm supposed to push it. No, I think that's it

903
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:49,400
Maybe stream but not in general. Yeah, no not in general but on stream though

904
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,920

You can have feet

908
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:10,240
There's my foot all the paint chaff chipped off now. Here's the other one

909
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,040

01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,920
Yeah, I'm so brave today

916
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,080
What is this

917
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,520
I

918
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,320
Anyways, I've been playing that um

919
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:17,760
To the spa. I know I need to go to like a spa one day. I've never been to a spa

920
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,760
I've never um

921
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:27,080
Need to I've never gotten like a massage or anything. I feel like I need to treat myself one day

922
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:30,600
I've never even gotten my nails done other than like by my aunt

923
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,040
So I really want to one day

924
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,560
You'll give me a massage and I

925
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:54,080
Feel like I want like a fancy one, you know, I don't want I don't want some amateur massage. I

926
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,080
Want a fancy massage?

927
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:06,520
I'm like a fancy person that knows how to massage. I have fancy establishment

928
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,560
That costs way too much money, but they oil up your body and make you all shiny

929
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:17,760
And they give you a happy ending. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. No, no, no, no, no

930
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:23,360
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't do those places even exist in Canada. I don't know I

931
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,640
Would not know

932
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:31,840
Are you saying we're not fancy? Well, I want like a fancy establishment, you know

933
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:41,720
Like actually maybe I don't maybe I'm too shy for that. I don't know

934
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:51,680
Cuz don't you have to get naked or something like you have to take off your clothes and then they just like

935
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:55,080
This is a chicken foot. What is this?

936
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,040
That chicken foot

937
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:10,080
Had a worry about freezing your bits off freezing. Is it cold?

938
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,840
Yeah, if you can pronounce the name it's not fancy enough

939
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:21,920
It's got to be at like some crazy super expensive hotel or something

940
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:32,760
She'd do a ham on and get a Turkish Turkish massage. They give you the good treatment with the sponge and stuff

941
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,200
What's the difference between a regular massage and a Turkish massage? I

942
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:44,360
Know that there's different types of massages and you don't have to get naked for all of them

943
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:50,000
But you at least have to take off your shirt for like a back massage, right? And I'm even scared to do that

944
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,880
Because like

945
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,080
No, I'm too scared to do that

946
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:03,480
I can't pronounce the little Caesars. Let's go there. Well, I can so let's not go there

947
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,760
Let me see that this one

948
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:22,280
They speak Turkish when they do with the massage. Oh, oh, that's okay. I can't pronounce or anything in Turkish. Okay. Yeah

949
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,520
They'll strip your skin raw. I kind of want that too

950
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:36,600
Amy boob camp easy was scared to get a professional massage. Yes. Yes

951
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:44,280
And I haven't done no boob cam. I don't know what you're talking about talking about I've never done that

952
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,520
Maybe that can be like a

953
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:51,800
Imagine that would be like a a donathan reward

954
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,680
I just have a boob cam

955
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:03,160
Oh my god, that would have to be like $60,000 that would have to be really high reward

956
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,640
Oh

957
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:16,840
Last one is gray. I hope that's okay. I can't find another white one

958
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,160
Oh, there's the other white one

959
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:24,280
Oh

960
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,200
As long as you go to actual professionals, it should be fine. Yeah, there's your drama

961
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:39,480
Have you considered a chiropractor not scared of chiropractors because I've heard stories of chiropractors like fucking up people's lives

962
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,040
like like like literally causing people to like have um

963
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,600
You know like uh

964
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:53,160
Like I don't know like breaking their necks and stuff. Haven't you heard those stories?

965
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Hey sneeze

966
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,760
No

967
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:15,000
You would definitely not be the first person to

968
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:19,800
The masseuse ever saw naked and probably not the first person they saw naked that day. I know

969
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,240
But it's still shy like I'm still shy about it

970
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,040
I'm still shy about it

971
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,960
It's real life where real people can see me

972
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:36,680
It's not the internet where I'm just sitting in front of my computer and leaning over a little bit, you know

973
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,640
I

974
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,240
Yeah, chiro's a scam. Yeah, that's what I heard people say like

975
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:51,560
You know, it's it's dangerous in a scam. There's a shit ton of chiropractors near me though

976
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,040
And I always think that there's some sort of like a front for like, um

977
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,040
What's it called?

978
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,600
Um

979
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,760
Oh

980
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,880
I always think there's some sort of front for money laundering

981
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:21,560
You know, oh, I didn't do this, right? Oh shit

982
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:28,200
Oh shit, yeah money laundering

983
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I messed it up

984
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,320
Chiropractors are a bit mixed some can realign a spine others have no idea what they're doing

985
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,960
Yeah, because isn't there like not any kind of official school for chiropracting?

986
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,880
Is this right?

987
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,680
That doesn't look right

988
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,640
Whatever

989
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:06,040
Like I heard there's nothing official for chiropractors. They just fucking do whatever they want

990
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,240
All right, what am I wrong?

991
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,760
There are plenty of massage places that are just fronts for

992
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:22,040
Boston tuition. I heard of that. Yeah, I know about that

993
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,520
Uh

994
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:31,400
In america slash canada, there's no official school in the uk. There's required medical school degree

995
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,840
Why don't they do that in america and canada?

996
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:41,240
The government must be making money off of us going to chiropractors and getting hurt

997
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:48,520
That's the conspiracy didn't strongly do a conspiracy theory stream. I should do a conspiracy three theory stream

998
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,320
I've watched a lot of conspiracy theories

999
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Oh wait

1000
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,560
It's basically pseudoscience. Yeah, that's what I heard

1001
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:10,840
I don't know if it's true because I'm sure there's a bunch of people that are like

1002
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:15,400
Oh chiropractors saved my life because before I was in intense

1003
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,920
Before I was in intense pain

1004
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,480
And now I'm you know healed

1005
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,680
I

1006
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:35,560
She does that almost every stream. Well, let me fucking join her. Um, what should I conspiracy theory about?

1007
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,920
I can't really think of any recent ones that I watched

1008
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,560
Uh

1009
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:52,360
Okay, I have been watching a lot of um

1010
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:02,440
A lot of those like cave diving exploration um gone wrong videos where they tell the story of some like idiot that went cave diving

1011
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I'm sorry. I shouldn't call them idiots. They're real people with families and stuff, but

1012
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,240
Of like people that went cave diving

1013
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:15,160
And they do something dumb like they're like, oh, no

1014
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
You know

1015
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:25,160
There was once a church called trying to recruit new members outside of the uni iton

1016
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:32,040
They were like, are you ready for eternal life? Oh, fuck that reminds me. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really bad at finishing my um

1017
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,600
I'm really bad at finishing my train of thought. I'll come back to the cave diving stuff

1018
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:45,960
The baron scene bears stuff. Yeah, the mandala effects. I believe in those for sure. I believe in that stuff

1019
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,240
Like secretly there's like not secretly but like there's like alternate universes

1020
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,280
Where um, you know, sometimes we we we switch between like

1021
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,920
alternate dimensions, you know

1022
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:06,600
There's a conspiracy theory that in me isn't my real sister lies lies. Don't believe them. They're trying to trick you

1023
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Don't believe what they say. Okay

1024
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,360
It's true. I am your real sister. Okay

1025
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,520
Don't don't don't trust them

1026
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,400
Okay, only only trust me only trust what I say, okay

1027
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,920
I speak the truth

1028
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:29,080
Amy, have you heard of bad memory? No, are you saying I have it?

1029
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:35,480
Um, yeah, I gotta wipe me. Oh, I gotta wipe my face. I'm getting sweaty

1030
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,600
What was I talking about?

1031
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:44,120
I forgot what I was talking about

1032
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:52,360
Cave diving. No, I wanted to use the fan here, right? Where is the fan?

1033
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,960
I wanted to talk about one more thing

1034
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,960
I

1035
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,640
Sweating all over the toys

1036
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:13,640
I'm I'm I'm I'm facing the fan down here now

1037
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,520
Here, let me let me unzip for you

1038
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:23,160
And and fan inside of my sweater. Who's getting hot?

1039
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:34,200
You're wearing a sweater. I know but I want to wear the sweater cuz like

1040
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:43,000
You know look does it match? No, but it's close enough

1041
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:50,840
It's close enough. It's it's it's you know, but it's it's on theme

1042
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,040
Ah

1043
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:09,160
Close enough good cosplay I can never truly cosplay myself could I

1044
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,480
Okay, sure. I'll talk about the cave diving. There was actually one more thing I wanted to talk about but I forgot

1045
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,040
I

1046
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:36,520
Don't you have water I do right here. I'm drinking it

1047
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Literal fan service, huh?

1048
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,480
Okay, okay, okay, so I've been watching like

1049
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:54,920
Cave diving videos, um, we're like

1050
01:47:55,640 --> 01:48:00,440
Basically, I don't know. I can't think of a specific one

1051
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:07,320
Just one like like some people have this really weird hobby of like

1052
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:18,600
Okay, some people have this weird hobby of like putting their bodies into really tiny spaces

1053
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:27,000
And seeing how far they can go basically, you know, like like the nutty putty cave guy who like

1054
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:31,320
Like they just they just have this weird hobby of like

1055
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:36,120
Exploration, I guess I guess it's the thrill, you know of like, ooh

1056
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,360
I'm you know really crushed on all sides and I'm gonna try to squeeze through this tiny hole

1057
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:45,800
And I have to push out all of my breath

1058
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:52,200
I have to push out my entire breath to be able to squeeze through this whole

1059
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:57,800
How invigorating and exciting, you know, I think some people have like that kind of thrill

1060
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:00,360
That sounds like a fetish. I don't think it's a fetish

1061
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:05,080
I think they just have that sort of you know, they they like to be um

1062
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,360
They like the rush the rush, you know

1063
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:14,840
But yeah, like the nutty putty guy that's the only one I actually remember

1064
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:21,400
Latex kink. They should just get in a latex suit

1065
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:28,680
More people they're all secretly mole furries and they're role-playing being a mole

1066
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:35,560
Yeah, like people that like that parkour on the edge of like buildings, um

1067
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,240
Hmm

1068
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:45,000
It's like those kind of people that seek some strange rush

1069
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,760
But the nutty putty cave situation is basically the story of this guy who um

1070
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,960
He was cave diving with his friends, I think

1071
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:03,720
I'm pretty sure he was cave diving with his friends. Maybe not, but I'm pretty sure he was cave diving with his friends and um

1072
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:08,040
There is one part of the cave where um

1073
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,880
You know

1074
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:16,280
You have to squeeze through a really tiny hole to get to the next part of the cave, right?

1075
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,840
And after that hole it like gets bigger again

1076
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:27,080
But like these kinds of caves are literally like you crawling on your on your on your stomach like like dragging yourself

1077
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,720
Through on your stomach, you know

1078
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:35,800
So that's what the site this guy was doing and he came across, you know

1079
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,360
That really tight part of the cave and he was like, okay. I just gotta squeeze through this hole

1080
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,680
And it'll get wider again after I squeeze through it, right?

1081
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,600
because people like have that cave mapped out like um

1082
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:53,240
Other crazy people have gone into that cave and mapped it out

1083
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:56,280
So you know where to go and you know which direction to go

1084
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:03,880
To be at least a little bit safe. I don't think their their goal is to be safe doing this kind of stuff, but you know

1085
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,760
At least a little bit safe to know at least where you are and you don't get lost in the cave forever

1086
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:15,320
So he squeezes himself through the hole, right?

1087
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,840
But the problem is is that it was actually

1088
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,960
It was actually the wrong hole, you know

1089
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,920
um

1090
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,920
I don't did I do this right? Oh, there you go

1091
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:35,640
No, I did this wrong. It was actually the wrong hole. He had gone

1092
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:42,120
The wrong direction and he was squeezing through a different hole and this hole was actually like

1093
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,520
really um

1094
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:48,280
Really small and it would keep getting smaller and it also was um

1095
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,900
It was also aimed um downward

1096
01:51:55,640 --> 01:52:01,480
It was aimed downward. So he goes through the hole and he falls in and he hangs upside down

1097
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:07,720
Um, and he can't get out, right? So he's just hanging upside down

1098
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,760
And his friends I think call for help, you know, and so they um

1099
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:18,040
It takes them a while to to you know

1100
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,960
Get to him in the first place while he's hanging upside down

1101
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:25,640
Sorry if you hear bumping against the mic. It's either my headphone wire

1102
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:28,760
Or my glasses

1103
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:33,800
It's one of those too, sorry, um, but um

1104
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:38,280
Yeah, he hangs upside down for a really long time until the rescuers come

1105
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,800
And the rescuers are like shit, dude

1106
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:47,320
Like it's gonna be really hard to break you out of here without, um

1107
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:51,080
Without breaking your legs

1108
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,240
You know

1109
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:56,280
They're like we might have to break your legs to get you out of here

1110
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:00,520
But then they realized I don't remember what they realized they realized like

1111
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:07,000
Breaking his legs was gonna be really dangerous because he you know

1112
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:11,320
I think they said it like my cause of blood clot or something

1113
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,600
You know

1114
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:18,520
I try to squeeze through the round hole before too it can get pretty messy

1115
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:23,000
That's something I never quite understood. How do guys go in the wrong hole?

1116
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,680
Like I feel like you gotta you gotta really not be paying attention

1117
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,480
And you gotta be going really fast

1118
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,200
To end up in the wrong hole, you know

1119
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,560
And then that hole has to accept you in the first place

1120
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:43,800
Which I feel like you'd probably know by then like oh shit. I'm going through the wrong hole, you know

1121
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:54,920
No wrong no hole is wrong if you're brave enough

1122
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:05,400
Slippery I'm sure it can get slippery down there. Yeah

1123
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:09,480
It just hurts when it doesn't accept it. Yeah, that's what I'm saying

1124
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:11,000
Like I feel like you're just

1125
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,920
You're not actually going to be able to like go all the way in like you're just oops. Sorry poked you. Okay moving on

1126
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,880
Anyway, um

1127
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:33,080
I hope you guys don't hate me for showing my boobs. I thought it would be fun. Some people are really against flesh posting

1128
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,080
Um, which means like showing your flesh as a vtuber

1129
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,280
um

1130
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:42,360
I think it's a little bit fun

1131
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,640
um

1132
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,520
But some people are really against it and don't like it so

1133
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,720
I don't know

1134
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:56,200
There's a lot of people and it's hard to please them all right. There's it's really hard to please everyone

1135
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,240
I've dropped it again

1136
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,040
Oh, I see it

1137
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:12,520
Do what you want. Yeah, I will try to I love it more please

1138
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:19,000
Shh shut your your mouth your dirty mouth

1139
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,760
Um

1140
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:38,920
What was I saying? Okay, now he put a cave situation right so eventually they were like, okay, we can't break his legs

1141
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,360
I think they said something like it would cause a blood clot or something since he was hanging upside down

1142
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,680
So they were like we can't break his legs

1143
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:50,120
How about we try doing like a pulley situation since he's he's hanging upside down and like this really tight like

1144
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:53,880
crevice rate so they can't just like you know

1145
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,920
grab his legs and like

1146
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:03,160
Pulled him out normally while he's like pushing like I don't know. He's probably like really dizzy at this point and barely knows

1147
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:05,160
what's going on um, so

1148
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,120
They try to do some sort of pulley situation

1149
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:13,480
Where they attach the pulley to him and then they like pull from the outside right

1150
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,200
With like maybe some sort of machine

1151
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:19,480
um

1152
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:22,120
But then the pulley breaks

1153
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,240
And um

1154
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,000
This keeps breaking too

1155
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:32,040
The pulley ends up breaking and they I think in the end they just couldn't get him out

1156
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:35,480
And he was stuck upside down for like 30 something hours, dude

1157
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:36,920
It was crazy

1158
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:40,520
But I think they got his family down there or something for him to say goodbye to

1159
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:44,040
Before he died or something or at least talk to him. I can't remember

1160
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:47,960
I haven't rewatched this the the story in a long time

1161
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:53,080
Won't be won't be flesh stream anytime anywhere

1162
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
No

1163
01:56:57,160 --> 01:57:00,760
No, they're they're won't no what what do you mean?

1164
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,280
Oh

1165
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:08,120
Sorry, I'm I'm growing

1166
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,800
Oh, fuck I keep growing there's never enough in me flesh posting

1167
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:31,640
You have fun you're having fun is the most important part. Yeah, that's right having fun

1168
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:34,760
I

1169
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:39,560
Mean I'm literally rock solid right now. Why are you acting so gay?

1170
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:45,560
I'm a faucet tip 10 dollars. I don't care what other people think. I'm still rock solid right now

1171
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,880
Please keep doing it if you're comfortable

1172
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:53,720
Okay, I understand thank you for the dollars

1173
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:00,680
How's anyone here sorry like that and thank you man? I want to go crawling into a tiny ass space

1174
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:04,360
See that's what I'm saying because people do still do that stuff

1175
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:08,280
And not only do they continue to do that stuff

1176
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,920
Some people do it underwater

1177
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:15,480
Like I legit heard us. I I like to watch them

1178
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,680
Am I doing this wrong?

1179
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:23,880
I like to watch like I get random videos on my tiktok of like people telling these stories

1180
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,160
And I just watch them there and sometimes I'll subscribe to them. Yeah

1181
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:32,120
I've only really subscribed to Stephanie Sue, but sometimes I'll go on the youtube channel to find the full stories

1182
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,440
Because they usually only post post clips on tiktok

1183
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:37,160
um

1184
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:43,320
But like some people do that shit underwater like they crawl through tiny caves under the water

1185
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,040
under the sea

1186
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,440
under the sea, you know

1187
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:55,420
And that's even scarier because not only will you get stuck you'll get stuck underwater

1188
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:00,120
I finished the pot

1189
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,960
Because I just heard this one story of two guys

1190
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:10,040
And they went together underwater they were going through an underwater cave

1191
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,040
um

1192
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:16,920
and it was tight and stuff just like my poo and um they

1193
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:18,920
like

1194
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:24,120
Decided at one point to turn around I think and to go back. I don't remember why they decided to go back

1195
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:26,680
But they decided to go back

1196
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,120
And when they decided to go back

1197
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:34,520
Oh, shit. We're already at two hours into the stream finish your freaking

1198
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,320
Lego bitch

1199
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,040
That reminds me of something but I don't remember why

1200
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,920
I've seen this video and you can see the corpses more nightmare fuel. I've seen some corpses. They're very scary. They're all swollen and stuff

1201
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:00,040
Uh

1202
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:06,600
A fella who was cave diving in 1890

1203
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,200
Whoa

1204
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:24,360
I'm surprised most of you haven't heard of this. I'm sure some of you have

1205
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:31,240
But um, yeah, there was these two guys that were uh cave diving underwater

1206
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,160
I already did that step

1207
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,960
And they said decide to turn back right

1208
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:44,120
But then they realized as they were turning back that there was like a bunch of uh

1209
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,480
Like sand and like um debris

1210
02:00:48,120 --> 02:00:51,880
On their on their road like on their tunnel on the way back and they're like, okay

1211
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:56,120
Wait, this wasn't here when we got here. Um, what's going on, right?

1212
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:00,520
So

1213
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:03,720
They're thinking like oh, maybe we went the wrong way, you know, like

1214
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:07,240
Maybe we took a wrong turn somewhere in this in this dark

1215
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:11,720
Ask cave underwater and we read them went the wrong way

1216
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,960
So they turn around and they're looking for the right way

1217
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,440
But then they realized like no, dude, this is the right fucking way

1218
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:20,600
But the problem was the reason there was debris was because um

1219
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,200
The

1220
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:31,000
Reason there was debris was because a bunch of like rocks like literally fell

1221
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,800
From like the top of the cave

1222
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:39,320
So it was like walking their way out, right? Yeah, it collapsed

1223
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:47,240
Other people stopped giving funds to the family and then the poor lad basically was forgotten and died in the cave

1224
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,240
He was stuck. Oh my god

1225
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:51,240
Wait, what story are you talking about?

1226
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,880
Oh

1227
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,240
Oh 1890 oh

1228
02:01:57,880 --> 02:02:00,280
People helped at first so people got sus

1229
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:03,480
If it was sure or not

1230
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:05,640
Oh

1231
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:08,760
He forgot and died in the cave. He was stuck in. Oh my god

1232
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,040
Hands heart you want hands heart?

1233
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:15,080
How do I do a hand heart? There we go. Hand heart

1234
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:17,880
There's also like the the kpop version

1235
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:20,920
Actually, I should do it with this now uh this

1236
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:25,480
This is supposed to be a heart too, but this one looks more like a heart

1237
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:29,640
Bro, why is my heart so weirdly shaped? There we go. Ta-da. Okay

1238
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,880
Um

1239
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,960
So yeah, they realized that the cave had uh

1240
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,480
Collapsed a little bit um

1241
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:43,580
In the tunnel that they were supposed to use to leave, right?

1242
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,280
So

1243
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:49,560
One guy so they were they had like 10 minutes of air left, right?

1244
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:53,960
Descent is a good movie. I really like that one. I have hard time

1245
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:57,560
I have a hard time finding um a good place to pirate it though

1246
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:03,320
I can't find a good pirating website for descent that um has good quality

1247
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:09,880
If anyone knows any pirating websites for descent that has good quality all the all the fucking versions of descent are like in

1248
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:12,440
Fucking 360 pp

1249
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:17,480
You're hard hardy whole

1250
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:20,440
Um anyways, um

1251
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:27,800
And the audio is always always fucking shit dvd. Uh

1252
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:34,440
Bro, no, I don't even have a dvd player. I've been wanting to buy one eventually though

1253
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:44,520
I have heard of the story of the pipeline pipeline workers. I'll tell that one next I think but I don't know that story so super well, but um

1254
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:49,960
So one guy says to the other one like okay, they have like 10 minutes left, right?

1255
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:56,360
And I think they were writing on like whiteboards or something underwater because obviously you can't talk to people underwater and um

1256
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:02,840
One guy says to the other guy, okay, you stay here. I'm gonna go see if there's another exit, right?

1257
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:08,120
So that's what he does. He leaves the other guy and he goes to look around for another exit

1258
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:12,280
Unfortunately, he comes back because there's no other exit. That's the only exit, right?

1259
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,240
Send it your way on twitter

1260
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:18,760
Yeah, you can send it on twitter or a marshmallow link

1261
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:22,760
But just make sure if you use a marshmallow link you you put a space in between

1262
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,600
um in between the the dot because marshmallow doesn't

1263
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,360
Sometimes it allows links. Sometimes it doesn't I don't know

1264
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,480
But thank you to anyone who helped me pirate

1265
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:44,360
Okay

1266
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:48,920
um and when he gets back because you know, he couldn't find um

1267
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:55,480
He couldn't find another way out. He realizes that his friend is fucking gone

1268
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:05,240
So he's like, okay, shit. I guess he he he was able to get through, right?

1269
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:08,600
um, so he's like, okay, I guess I'll go through too

1270
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:11,640
but the problem is

1271
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:14,920
He can't get through to the outside

1272
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:19,960
without taking off his um his oxygen tank

1273
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:23,320
But he's running out of oxygen anyways

1274
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:32,680
I'm going to light this goddamn desk on fire if this freaking drawer opens one more time. Oh my god

1275
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,080
Okay

1276
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:42,040
So he takes off his um

1277
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:50,120
Oxygen tank and he squeezes through to the other side now. They had apparently left oxygen tanks

1278
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:51,880
Um

1279
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:55,800
Outside of their cave. I guess maybe for a situation like this. I don't know

1280
02:05:56,200 --> 02:06:01,800
But they left oxygen tanks outside of the cave. I think that he the I think it was like, I don't know maybe like

1281
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:04,920
A hundred meters away or something like that like that's

1282
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:11,400
That's that's oh, that's really far. Maybe it wasn't a hundred meters, but they have left oxygen tanks

1283
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:14,120
outside of their cave

1284
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:16,280
um

1285
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:22,360
So he he swam around with no oxygen until he found the extra tanks, right?

1286
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,280
And he put put it on but then he realized oh shit

1287
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:29,320
You know my friend isn't here

1288
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,320
Um

1289
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,760
Um, is that it?

1290
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,280
Okay, and he realizes like oh shit my friend isn't here. Um, what do I do?

1291
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:52,920
And that's because his friend was fucking dead. His friend had tried the same thing as him

1292
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:56,040
to escape through without oxygen

1293
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,720
But his friend couldn't find the tanks in time

1294
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:02,600
So he died

1295
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Isn't that crazy?

1296
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:11,960
Um, this isn't right

1297
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:17,640
Hi Amy. Hi

1298
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:20,200
I

1299
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:27,000
Get really angry with this desk the drawer always opens on its own it's because I um

1300
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:30,520
I'm

1301
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,520
I placed like

1302
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,560
Another drawer underneath like a like a

1303
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:41,880
I placed an extra like fucking Walmart drawer under my desk and it's putting pressure

1304
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:45,800
On the actual desk drawer, and I think that's making it open constantly. Uh

1305
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:48,760
Ah

1306
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:53,720
I should do an apartment tour I talked about that

1307
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:57,080
I kind of want to do an apartment tour

1308
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:04,200
My apartment doesn't have the best interior decor. It's very cluttered and um, I think it's a little bit cozy too though

1309
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:11,080
But I'm gonna have to like clean a little bit and make sure I don't have my fucking laundry out

1310
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:15,480
Because I have to dry my laundry inside of the house because I don't have a dryer

1311
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,600
And I don't want you to see all my freaking laundry

1312
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:22,120
All my dirty stinky laundry

1313
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:32,760
You keep your toys in that drawer. No, I keep my art supplies in that drawer. My toys are in my closet

1314
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:39,960
Dryer fund I don't have space for a dryer. I don't have anywhere to plug a dryer either

1315
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,960
I

1316
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:47,480
Had too many toys. Why do you all assume it's my toys?

1317
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:51,160
You always assume it's my toys

1318
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:55,800
Damn since you live like this. Yeah, people are gonna say that damn since you live like this

1319
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:00,120
No

1320
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,360
Wait a minute. Oh, I put another flower on top

1321
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:07,720
You don't understand pill pin pills if you think we don't want to see your stinky laundry

1322
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:10,680
I guess I don't

1323
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:17,800
Okay, one more story one more story. Let me take a sip of water

1324
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:23,880
Add that to the flat funds. Oh, I already have an apartment place in mind. I just have to apply to it

1325
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:27,480
Which um, I haven't done yet

1326
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:31,560
I really need to do that. It's just that they ask for so much

1327
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:41,720
They ask for like, you know pay stubs. I um, they ask for like references from like two people, you know

1328
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:45,640
They ask for a reference from your current landlord, which fucking

1329
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:54,760
My current landlord either has dementia or he's autistic or he has like fucking a missing chromosome or both

1330
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:58,200
He's very strange. I don't know if I'll be able to get um

1331
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:03,960
I don't know if I'll be able to get any sort of note for him from him. He's really

1332
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:09,560
He's um gay. Why are you guys so gay?

1333
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:15,320
Link 3 22 tip 10 dollars close being left out is a plus for pin pals

1334
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:21,480
Imagine my landlord is like visiting one of my neighbors

1335
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:33,400
No, you don't have to prison fried pay stubs to prove your flat you have to provide pay stubs to move into a new flat

1336
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:42,280
Can you prove of 10 twice the income in America? I don't know what they ask for they just ask for

1337
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:45,560
Pay stubs. They don't say like you have to make a specific amount

1338
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,600
um

1339
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:54,440
I'll try to do the math to see if I would make twice the amount of the rent

1340
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:57,800
But I literally don't know how to do the math

1341
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:01,400
In my head

1342
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:03,880
On

1343
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,600
Oh

1344
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:12,440
Oh man, I don't know how to do that. I think I would

1345
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:15,640
Requires reference from your landlord. Yeah

1346
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:21,400
And references from people you know in real life and they also ask a print for two months of rent

1347
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:25,480
And they also asked for uh

1348
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:33,560
I don't know they asked for a shit ton and it wasn't even a nice place like okay. It was a nice place, but it was like

1349
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:38,440
A standard place. It was like. Yeah, this is this is like a

1350
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:42,440
Standard good nice place, you know, it's not like fancy or anything

1351
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:48,040
It's just like very standard place that that is good and normal and average

1352
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:50,760
Yeah

1353
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:53,880
Um, so it was really frustrating and then they were like

1354
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:55,480
Oh

1355
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:58,440
Here at stupid corp. We don't allow pets

1356
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:02,920
And I was just really fancy when I went to see that lady

1357
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:08,200
I was just super fancy because I was like, I don't want them to think I'm poor

1358
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:13,880
So I was I I was reading through their their requirements and I look up at her and I'm like

1359
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,880
Oh

1360
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:20,760
You don't allow rats or not rats. I was like, oh, you don't allow pets to you

1361
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:24,120
Well, I guess I'll take my business elsewhere then

1362
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:28,120
I was like, oh, you don't allow pets, huh?

1363
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:32,840
I guess uh, I guess I won't be able to apply here and then she was like, oh, no, no, no, no

1364
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:35,080
No, no, no

1365
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,080
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay

1366
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:48,600
They just say that on on on the requirements so that they can kick you out if you don't pay rent and use that as an excuse

1367
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:55,240
And I was like, okay damn, okay

1368
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:00,600
Um anyways

1369
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:04,600
That's evil of them, I know

1370
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:08,040
I know

1371
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:10,040
I know

1372
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:11,800
Also, I'm pretty sure

1373
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:16,520
I don't know. I thought oh this doesn't fit. Oh, yeah, but I don't know

1374
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:22,360
I know in some places it's like illegal for landlords to decide. Um

1375
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:29,160
I know in some places it's illegal for landlords to decide whether or not you're allowed to have a pet

1376
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:34,200
Which is based and true and real and they should do that in more places

1377
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,160
Thank you for becoming a pin pal Gerald

1378
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:40,600
Is that Gerald from the video game?

1379
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:43,640
What's it called?

1380
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:45,640
Is that Gerald from?

1381
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Um

1382
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Um

1383
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Sassans Creed

1384
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
The Witcher!

1385
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Is that Gerald from The Witcher?

1386
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Yeah, The Witcher

1387
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I know video games

1388
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:05,240
um

1389
02:14:06,040 --> 02:14:10,680
Most apartments in the US charge you monthly for pets too. Yeah, they don't do that here, but they do um

1390
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,920
A lot of them do say no pets allowed in the first place

1391
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,520
I don't know video games

1392
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:21,480
Sorry, I don't know video games

1393
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Gerald for the famous game Mass Effect

1394
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,680
Okay, yeah, I wanted to tell you one more story or I guess two more stories

1395
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:31,320
Oh, I realized I just forgot what the second one I wanted to tell you

1396
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:33,480
Oh, yeah, it was about these people on a boat

1397
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:38,600
I got I get a lot of these stories from uh, Mr. Ballin on youtube

1398
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:41,400
He tells like crazy stories

1399
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:46,760
His titles are like really fucking clickbaity, but then his stories are actually like

1400
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:49,400
interesting, so

1401
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:51,400
um this other one is um

1402
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:56,040
Fucking um

1403
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:01,640
Like I think it was like this one dude um had a younger brother out

1404
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,920
Oh, sorry I'm getting hot

1405
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:08,440
Should I should I take my sweater off?

1406
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:11,480
I'm not gonna take it off all the way, but I'll unzip it

1407
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I put the fan down there

1408
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:20,840
I know some people let their pets ruin housing i.e walls and carpet

1409
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:28,840
I I can't say I can't say anything about that because I've also done that

1410
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Okay

1411
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:46,760
Um

1412
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:54,760
Right this one was um, it was about like some guy and he had a younger brother and his younger brother was like I guess into

1413
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:59,560
Boats and stuff and he he's he had some experience with that

1414
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:04,040
But I guess his younger brother was more experienced and they didn't have enough people on their crew

1415
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:09,400
To go on this to by the way, most of these stories I listen to like while I'm doing something else

1416
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:14,840
So I probably am getting some details wrong, but they didn't have enough people to go on their on their on their um

1417
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:19,080
Other expedition

1418
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:23,160
Huh

1419
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:29,720
What

1420
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:43,720
What

1421
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:49,240
Oh

1422
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:03,160
Wait, why won't it connect

1423
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:15,480
Huh

1424
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:20,200
Is it just supposed to sit on it

1425
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,280
Oh, maybe I did place the side pieces too low

1426
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:37,320
Uh

1427
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:39,320
Um

1428
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:56,600
Hmm

1429
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:03,960
Anyways, so his brother was like hey, oh, I think I did thank you. You're right his brother was like hey, um, can you

1430
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:10,120
You know, can you come with us on this trip and he was like sure

1431
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:14,600
Yeah, sure. I'll come with you. You guys are missing some crew members. I'll just come with you

1432
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:17,480
and um

1433
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:21,640
As they were as they were uh

1434
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:31,080
Going I think what happened was like there was some boat malfunction. So they like go down into the you know the boat to try to fix it

1435
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:33,880
and um

1436
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:39,880
And as he was doing that they were realizing like holy shit the boat is flooding, you know

1437
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,080
They're like, oh my god, the boat is flooding

1438
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:48,600
So they get on their um, and it was like really flooding badly. So they get on their um

1439
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:53,400
On the on the safety raft

1440
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:57,640
Lego has always been a two-person job

1441
02:18:57,720 --> 02:19:02,760
One person fiddles with the figuring out how to get the thing together while the other reads instructions or sorts pieces

1442
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:08,200
Oh, well, this is so easy a baby could do this. I don't need anyone else

1443
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:11,240
I don't need anyone to help me

1444
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:13,240
other than maybe you

1445
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:15,720
um

1446
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:20,360
So they get on the life the the safety raft like the you know the emergency raft

1447
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:27,560
And um

1448
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:32,360
Once they're like kind of far away from the boat they realize like holy shit

1449
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:34,840
um

1450
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:48,120
I forgot what I was gonna say holy shit the raft has a hole in it and the raft was like leaking too, right?

1451
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:51,480
someone fucking had to have

1452
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:54,920
Trolled them a little bit, but um

1453
02:19:55,720 --> 02:19:58,680
So they realize even the raft had a leak in it, right the safety raft

1454
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:05,800
And so now they're like frick shit. What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? You know even the safety raft is gonna

1455
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:09,480
Is gonna um

1459
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:37,400

You don't watch and you don't watch enough vtubers if you think I sound like project melody

1466
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:45,480
She does sound cute though

1467
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:54,200

Oh, fuck no, no one was gonna tell me that I have my mic on I don't have my mic on mono

1471
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:18,440
Oh, dude. I'm so sorry to anyone listening with headphones

1472
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:20,440

1474
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:26,280
No, it's gonna fucking tell me that

1475
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:32,920
Anyone who is listening with headphones was probably hearing the only in one ear

1476
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:37,560
Oh, it just happened wait, seriously

1477
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I just thought Amy was to my right. No

1478
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:43,800
It's been like that the whole street

1479
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:47,320
No, it's gonna fucking tell me

1480
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:54,440
It only just started wait, what? It only happened when you pull up on youtube. What?

1481
02:22:57,080 --> 02:22:59,560
What the fuck that's weird

1482
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:03,480
It sounded okay before

1483
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:06,280
It has not been like that the whole stream, huh?

1484
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:09,720
I don't know

1485
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:15,000
I did have my mic on uh stereo or whatever the fuck it's called for the the

1486
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:19,880
The 3DO ASMR stream though. I have to switch it for every fucking ASMR stream

1487
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:24,040
And then I always forget to to switch something back afterwards

1488
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:30,680
Okay, anyways

1489
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:36,600
I'm using headphones. It's been fine this whole time for you until you until the youtube clip. That's so weird. That's so strange

1490
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:40,680
So, um

1491
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:44,200
Your audio also sounds different compared to pre youtube switching

1492
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:48,120
Bro, has my audio been like fucked this whole stream?

1493
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:53,560
Was my was was my mic bad or something?

1494
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:58,520
That's wrong thing

1495
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:02,440
No, it was peaking kind of bad

1496
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:07,320
You're right, that's fine

1497
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:14,040
Hold on i'm going back to i'm going back to the stream. I'm super super um

1498
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:18,600
Like i'm super super picky you're getting one guide

1499
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:23,320
That happens a lot. I'm super super picky about you tried. Uh

1500
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:36,920
Huh

1501
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:47,800
I don't know

1502
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:52,200
I sound like my usual annoying ass self. Audio's fine. Okay

1503
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:59,400
She's so artistic. I'm just really picky about my audio sounding normal at least and okay and good

1504
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:06,520
It seems very easy to one guy and me it is it is very easy

1505
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:11,480
We love spreading this information

1506
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:14,120
Okay, um

1507
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:17,880
You sound amazing always don't say that. Oh, okay. Thank you

1508
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:20,760
okay, so um

1509
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:27,000
They were like, okay, what do we do? What do we do? So they decide okay one guy this this one guy

1510
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,200
He's the main character. He's like, okay. I'm the biggest dude, right? So he's he's the

1511
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:37,560
The biggest one. He's the one weighing down the the safety raft. So he's like i'm going to

1512
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:42,200
Jump off of the safety raft and i'm going to swim back to the sinking boat

1513
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:48,200
That's what he he decides and everyone's like no, that's a that's death wish

1514
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:51,160
You're gonna die well because the sinking boat was pretty far at this point

1515
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:54,680
They're like you're gonna fucking die if you do that like don't do that

1516
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:57,400
Don't do that and he's like it's fine because in the back of his head

1517
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:00,600
He's like oh, there's a rat at my feet in the back of his head. He's like, you know what

1518
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:04,360
If I don't do this then no one has a chance, you know

1519
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:09,800
Is that really how it's supposed to look that looks stupid

1520
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:13,880
He's like if I don't do this then no one has a chance of living, right?

1521
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:17,720
Oh, I guess that is how it's supposed to look. So he gets off

1522
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:22,440
Stopped peeking now too, huh?

1523
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:26,360
I don't know

1524
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:32,200
No, there are not rats on the boat. I'm saying there's a rat at my feet right now

1525
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:34,040
Not on the boat

1526
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:34,520
Um

1527
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:36,760
Not on the boat. Um

1528
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:43,960
Um, it's fun to one guy in me

1529
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:48,760
You're the only one I want to one guy me

1530
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,000
um

1531
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:57,640
So he he gets off the the like safety raft and he he does it. He's he's thinking it's a death. Um, you know

1532
02:26:58,280 --> 02:27:03,320
It's it's it's kind of you know a a lost cause, but at least his friends will be able to

1533
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:10,360
Oh, it's pixie. Hi pixie. Oh, sorry. Fuck. It's luna. No, it's pixie. It's pixie. I get their names confused. Um

1534
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:17,640
So he he just thinks like at least my friends will be able to be safe for a little longer

1535
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:22,200
And I still might have a chance of swimming back to the to the sinking ship maybe right

1536
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:27,720
So he swims for like hours straight like fucking. I don't even know like a day or something

1537
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:31,960
And um

1538
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:35,320
And he finally gets there

1539
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:36,920
Oh, I'm done

1540
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:41,480
He finally gets there and you know, he he's like, okay great. We're good

1541
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:44,040
And then he like stays there for a really long time

1542
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:46,600
And eventually he sees a big ship

1543
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,560
Go up to like where his friends were and he's like, holy shit

1544
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:56,280
My friends were saved right and sees since he's not too far away from from them because he saw the ship saving them

1545
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:58,760
He's thinking like, okay, maybe um

1546
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:02,040
Maybe i'll be saved too

1547
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:04,040
So, um

1548
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:09,560
He falls asleep thinking like oh when I wake up. I'll be in the hospital with my friends, right?

1549
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:12,840
And um

1550
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:21,320
And um, oh shit Estefan is here. Hi Estefan

Ever since you opened youtube it's random crunchy audio. It's because my rat is playing with the plastic wrapping of the um

1581
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:37,240
Of the legos

1582
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:39,240
And also with my chocolate

1583
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:41,640
She's in the background like playing with the plastic wrap

1584
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:46,040
That might be why you hear crunching in the background. I don't know

1585
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:49,320
Whatever

1586
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:51,320

Oh man, what if I unplug and plug it back in?

1589
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:12,840
Is that better

1590
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:19,720
Did that do anything? I don't know. It's okay. We're we're in the extreme. So there's no point in um

1591
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:24,200
Missing around for now. It is better. What the fuck?
