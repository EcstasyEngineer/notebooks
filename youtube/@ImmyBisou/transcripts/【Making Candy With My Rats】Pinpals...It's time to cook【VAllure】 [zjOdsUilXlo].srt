1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh my god, my hands are there! Hi! Can you hear me good? I feel like the audio might be a little bad.

3
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't want it to be cutting me out at all.

4
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello, hello, hello! You sound great. Am I getting cut off? Should I make it even louder?

5
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing.

6
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I know I'm not muted this time.

7
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

8
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't find the scuff. I know!

9
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Last hand cam stream, it was so scuffed. The ASMR was so bad. I'm so sorry.

10
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I figured out how to fix my camera so now you can actually see in good quality.

11
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Also, my tracking isn't going to be as good because it was harder to set up.

12
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not as simple as it looks. Okay, there's a lot of wires around me.

13
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And there's a lot of technology around me, okay?

14
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So sorry if the tracking isn't as good.

15
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hello, welcome. What happened to your pink setup? What do you mean by pink?

16
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, you mean like my mousepad? I'm on the floor today.

17
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is the two that I got. They're pop and cook and so basically they're just candy.

18
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They're just candy. They're just candy and they look like food.

19
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So this one's like the American one and then this one's like the Japanese one.

20
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's just the Japanese one.

21
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So we're going to make, I don't know if we'll make both of these, but we're going to make at least one of them.

22
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But yeah, we're on the floor. Floor gang. Floor wire at random? No.

23
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The whole thing's going to come tumbling down.

24
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, floor shim. I'm on a blanket today. Should I move my, I know you can see like my iPhone over there.

25
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sorry, sorry if it's annoying.

26
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Which one do you want to, oh wait, first before we do anything.

27
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The long awaited introduction. I have to introduce you to my rats now, don't I?

28
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Right? Yep. It's time for you to meet the family.

29
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We're getting really serious now. Oh no.

30
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is my camera getting fucked up? What are those? What are those?

31
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you see that?

32
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Bro, I thought there was going to be no scuff. This is a new camera. What the hell?

33
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You do see that? Radiation?

34
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Cough.

35
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hmm.

36
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hmm.

37
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Dammit.

38
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sigh.

39
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sigh.

40
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, I'm going to switch cameras to my, um, to my phone. I'm going to use my phone as a camera.

41
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay?

42
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I'll be right back.

43
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll be right back. I'm going to try using my phone. I'm so pissed this is a new camera. What the fuck?

44
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000

140
00:32:42,320 --> 00:33:07,200
sick as the buns looking at me right here's my story yesterday it's not really story it's just

141
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:17,680
something I want to tell you yesterday I was posted a picture on Twitter dot com of two are you gay

142
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:24,160
well why are you acting so gay can't always catch streams live but I'm happy to watch when I can

143
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:32,200
and sometimes even see toes keep up the great work sis thank you thank you for the tip

144
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:40,560
it's okay you don't have to watch them live you don't have to be here I have I'm really

145
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,640
thankful that you are here in the first place though so yesterday I posted a picture on Twitter of

146
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:55,720
some toys wink wink and I tried them out yesterday you heard me you heard me try it yesterday the

147
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,920
one I use well my hands are shaking the one I used for the audio that I posted yesterday was the

148
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:08,120
pink one and I'm sorry to disappoint you for actually both toys I'm sorry to disappoint you

149
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,520
pink one I couldn't figure out how to get it to work well because like from the shape of it it's

150
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:24,360
supposed to like how am I supposed to describe this on YouTube so from this okay from the shape of

151
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:42,040
it looks like it's supposed to like like like like it's like this shaped right so it looks like

152
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:51,200
it's supposed to go like that right like inside but like it was just kind of like like I couldn't

153
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,720
get it deep enough so it was kind of just like hanging out like like this instead of going like

154
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:05,200
I need to rip this off to really give you a good visualization here alright

155
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:22,520
alright so imagine this box is me right this is this is this is me and that's my underside so the

156
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,640
toy is like this shaped right so I thought it would go in like that but I couldn't get it in to go

157
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,080
like that it was kind of just hanging out like this it wasn't even like it's supposed to be like it

158
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:41,120
was frustrating it still felt good but it was frustrating that's all I have to say any um any

168

192
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,800
it's a rat do you think she knows she's a girl do you think she hears me call her name do you

193
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,080
think she hears me say the word Esteban and she thinks oh fuck that bitch she called me she named

194
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:34,000
me after a man no it's just a rat who cares I don't care she's not gonna get bullied by the other rats

195
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,680
who is gonna bully her the babies because they're the only ones with female names

196
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,040
rats are very smart they're not they're not that smart they're not that smart

197
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,720
she's not sensitive oh my god no absolutely not the sensitive ones are the babies

198
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,640
Esteban is one of the least sensitive ones and I think you're I think you might need me another one

199
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:16,480
Dennis is very shy that's why I didn't pick her up and show her to you but she's near me right now

200
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,440
fish who you call an Esteban I am Princess Buttercup no her name is not Princess Buttercup

201
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:33,440
her name is Esteban deal with it how'd you get your rats um

202
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,240
oh my god

203
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:51,120
it all started when I wanted a hamster and I looked up on google hamster videos

204
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,120
or not on google but on youtube hamster videos and um

205
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:05,120
well I was looking at videos of hamsters I learned that hamsters don't really care about their owners

206
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,880
that much are these instructions

207
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,360
I will keep this for instructions okay

208
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,560
so I learned that hamsters don't really care about their owners that much

209
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:35,200
and in my head I was like if I'm gonna get a pet and if it's gonna look this cute it's gotta care

210
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:43,840
about me I'm sorry it's gotta care about me because if I'm gonna care about some cute little

211
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,160
creature I wanted to care about me in return you know I was a little lonely yeah I was a little

212
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,840
lonely and I needed a pet to love me back I wanted a pet that loved me so yeah

213
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:07,120
so um I think I don't know how I just found out that some people kept rats as pets too

214
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,520
when I was um when I was looking like

215
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,760
you know looking through pet videos of small animals I debated on getting mice

216
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,240
maybe but then I found out that mice also don't really are you stealing your shit

217
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,920
I found out that mice also don't really like you back either so finally I landed on rats

218
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,440
hamsters die in some weird ways

219
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,160
oh my god

220
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,200
they don't it's not that they die in weird ways they're just really neglected animals

221
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,760
it's kind of depressing how neglected poor hamsters are

222
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,720

241
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,680
well buy two rats because they need to be in pairs um but then I saw the prices at the pet store

262
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,960
and that started my journey of rats and ever since then I've gotten more an estaban and

263
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:28,560
deniser from a rat rescue they're not they're not from kijiji yeah and pixie and luna are

268
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,000
no it's not a stanley cup it's just a random cup

269
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,640
the upkeep for five is never ending they also fight constantly wait guinea pigs fight oh

270
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,920
fuck I'm not even paying attention to what I'm doing here I don't I don't think this is enough water

271
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:38,240
this is nowhere near enough water damn it what if I just

272
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,160
or I guess I can do it

273
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:56,080
I thought guinea pigs liked each other that's why you get multiple because they want to be together

274
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,200
stop making imie excuse her canadianness what do you mean

275
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,160
so get the rats and pairs if you get them okay perfect for needing them catch on in deku

276
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,520
and then that way you can make them kiss and roleplay as kachan and dick

277
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,960
that would be so funny

278
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:37,200
it's already gonna be botched what why this it's not botched I still feel like it's not enough

01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:39,080
one container of the water apparently excuse me

the more items you get the more points you get we collect more points

492
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,000
it's this is not a crack house it's a crack home

493
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,320

612
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:19,000

oh my god please don't look at my notifications

614
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,320
that's nothing important anyways

615
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:35,880
actually whatever

616
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:44,680
I know I'm so talented

617
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,440
a blue logo what do you mean a blue logo

618
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,720
there's no blue logo

619
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:58,760
right um

620
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,920
um

621
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:08,120
the question is should I make another one or should I um

622
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,880
should I should I end here what do you want

623
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:25,480
should I make this one this one kind of feels easier to make or maybe actually it looks harder

624
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:30,680
that's up to you baby girl

625
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:39,400
it means so good at cooking she could be your wife but can you sanity handle another one

626
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,480
if Esteban isn't here to fuck me over all the time maybe

627
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:08,360
you never end the broadcast you're still hungry okay I'll make another one for you

628
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:15,240
just for you because you asked so nicely I'll make another one how are you feeling I'm feeling

629
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:24,360
okay I could go on a little bit longer I'll make another one well Esteban get involved

630
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:28,360
probably I can see her peeking from the corner at me um

631
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:39,640
I I don't normally like to waste food but I'm not gonna eat this so it's going in a trash

I like paint fluid did you guys hear uh I'm thinking of a story but I forgot it

821
02:15:19,160 --> 02:15:23,400
there was there's like Reddit stories or here I'll tell you multiple stories because I just

822
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:29,400
thought of another one did you guys see the freaking post about that guy on the internet

823
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:36,200
that like he made a post on the internet right and he was like he posted a picture of his um

824
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:44,360
he posted a picture of his leg I think and it was covered in bruises and he was like I don't know

825
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:51,960
he's the the caption was like days blah blah blah blah day something um of trying to micro dose

826
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:59,160
bullets until I'm bullet proof it days something I've tried to micro dose

827
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:08,840
bullets until I'm bullet proof fucking hell open oh my god okay and his leg was covered

828
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:17,560
in like scars and then eventually he like posted another update and he was like guys

829
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:24,600
I went up I don't remember the guns that he was using or like the bullets that he was using

830
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:32,040
he literally said it was working too he was like my um my bullets have no longer been like

831
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:36,600
breaking skin okay get your nose out of there okay I need two of these he said my bullets

832
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:42,520
have no longer been breaking skin so I'm gonna move up to the next like gun I don't know next

833
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:50,520
gun or next bullets he might be onto something right and so um that's what he did and then he ended

834
02:16:50,520 --> 02:17:00,040
up in the he ended up in the hospital after that yeah next caliber I don't know bro was bullet

835
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:07,160
maxing he ended up in the hospital after that and he was like guys I'm gonna stop micro dosing

836
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:09,880
bullets and then he started

837
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:16,040
okay um

838
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:33,000
sorry I'm just rewatching the stream to see the clip of of S1 trying to um take my my packaging

839
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:46,280
why am I so far behind on stream okay well whatever guys tell me if you see my face okay

840
02:17:46,280 --> 02:18:03,000
that's embarrassing but anyways um what was I talking about

841
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:15,480
we didn't even see your hair I was hoping for a hair reveal I'm spilling water everywhere

842
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:23,800
um why does my stream so delayed on my end what the hell

843
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:32,120
okay there we go right micro dosing bullets um

844
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:40,040
um um so he went up to the next caliber and then he was like guys he ended up in the hospital

845
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:46,200
he was like guys I can't do this anymore I'm gonna stop but if anyone wants to pick up

846
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:53,000
like pick up my my challenge like basically just saying like guys you should try this too

847
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:59,880
um I just thought that was hilarious and then he started being like an asshole about the nurse

848
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:05,320
and saying like yeah I'm gonna fuck the nurse in the hospital which yeah sure yeah of course the guy

849
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:13,160
who would try to micro dose bullets would be creepy like that no face just be perfect how I like it

850
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:23,720
S1 has been waiting on the phone so that may be the uh walking on the phone yeah that's true

851
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:30,680
okay but was the nurse hot though I don't know why are you asking it doesn't even matter

852
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:39,800
it doesn't matter if she was hot do you like her huh are you looking for a girlfriend in the nurse

853
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:48,200
you know being a streamer probably pays just as much as being a nurse these days

854
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:55,880
so maybe you should just stick with me okay

855
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:03,480
why isn't my race racing the way I want it to race only in me only in me perfect perfect

856
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:16,680
ill women are you gay why are you acting so gay right now

857
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:22,280
I need more water

858
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:35,480
I caught my socks on oh so it's not gay

859
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:44,280
there you go it means the best sister in the world and she's the only girl I

860
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:50,920
need in my life and I love her a lot good job good job you're doing good I've trained you well

861
02:20:54,280 --> 02:21:01,480
right what was I saying so the other story I had was of I think it's a Reddit story I'm not sure

862
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:08,040
it was of this girl who was man I wish I could remember I really wish I had better memories

863
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:13,880
so I could tell you tell you about it better but it was from this girl and I think she had this

864
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:20,840
weird obsession with like people you know giving her attention for being sick so she would pretend

865
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:26,040
to be sick online um and I think it got to the point where she was like

866
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:40,520
every female I come across wait what I see every female I come across as a potential partner

867
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:42,840
what is wrong with you why would you say that to me

868
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:52,360
I'm the only potential partner shut up do you want this up your ass because you're acting

869
02:21:52,360 --> 02:22:04,280
like it right now or even better this one okay anyways so this girl would pretend to be sick

870
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:06,840
online and I think she would um

871
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:20,520
um Fixie's here come here don't be scared come on come closer come closer

872
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:27,800
she's so scared it's okay come closer come to the light do you see her

873
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:32,680
is it all oh I'm sorry you're scared she's oh

874
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:35,720
hi baby

875
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:48,680
every time I move she gets scared

876
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:53,320
okay bye bye

877
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:56,280
okay great

878
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:10,440
did you recently adopt her is that why she's scared um

879
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:18,040
female rats tend to be more skittish I notice that male rats just in general

880
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:19,720
um

881
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:27,080
she is also recently adopted yeah so she hasn't been outside of her cage much this is like

882
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:32,120
probably the second time I've let her free roam around my entire room so yeah she's a little spooked

883
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:42,920
um what was I talking about right right so I think what she would do is I feel like I need to get

884
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,760
closer let's get let's get up close and personal here um what she would do is that she would um

885
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:56,760
pick at her leg I guess which same same but she would pick at her leg and like

886
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:00,600
at one point it got um

887
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:08,520
yo don't like the don't don't like the scissors at one point it got infected

888
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:14,680
and she kept picking at it because you know she was like posting photos online I guess

889
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:18,600
and um

890
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:25,000
it got to the point where she had like an entire hole

891
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:30,440
in her leg like through her leg like you could see through her leg because if she got

892
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:37,160
like it got so bad because it got infected I think by the way don't take these stories as like

893
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:41,800
100% like this is what happened like these are stories I've seen on the internet but I might be

894
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:45,320
fucking them up because I don't remember them correctly okay so just know that

895
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:56,040
um yeah she got a hole through stop touching me it might be a little spooky um she got a hole

896
02:24:56,040 --> 02:25:02,920
through her leg and I saw the picture and it was so scary yeah I'm on Chow's and that's what it's called

897
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:12,520
I can't believe that Amy's friend did that what my friend no I don't know this person it was an

898
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:17,880
internet story what do you mean Amy wait wait wait wait and I spilled more water

okay that's my triangle race shape

913
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:56,200
my stepdad knew a guy who kept amputating parts of his toes he just chopped off every once in a

914
02:26:56,200 --> 02:27:03,080
while wait he just chopped off a bit every once in a while oh my god he's trying to make himself

915
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:11,560
grow his limbs back isn't he that's what he was trying to do he was trying to get his limbs to grow

916
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:20,440
back so if he chopped off a little at a time it would slowly grow back dude what a freaking

917
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:29,320
Elon Musk who uh what other smart people uh Elon Musk isn't smart um what other smart people

918
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:38,280

02:27:57,480 --> 02:28:03,640
so I fill up all of these okay I'm gonna fill up I'm gonna fill them up

922
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:09,160
what does this say it says nutty I was just saying what it is

923
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:17,880
okay I'm just gonna pull a little bit then

924
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:23,800

925
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:34,600
he freaking shadowbanned me from twitter of course I hate him it's okay though my twitter is okay now

926
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:40,920
okay that's a little bit terrifying

927
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:52,120
there was that one guy earlier this year who got convinced to freeze his legs with dry ice until

928
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:57,800
he lost them for insurance money and then got caught dude there's like people who I'm just gonna

929
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:04,280
put the rest in here I think that's right there's like people who identify as now we're just talking

930
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:09,400
about mental illness at this point what a great topic for me I'm kidding I'm not gonna talk about

931
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:15,960
my own but um there's like people who I saw I saw it on like those tlc shows there's people who

932
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:23,240
identify as like handicapped and then they will literally handicap themselves to to to be the handicap

933
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:29,160
that they like identified with like the lady that like put bleach in her eyes so that she um

934
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:35,880
so that she was blind because she wanted to be blind isn't that crazy I don't know I think I

935
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:39,240
need to start dipping because this is no longer getting deep enough in

936
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:46,840

940
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:15,320

941
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:29,720
oh shit I wasn't supposed to put oops I wasn't supposed to put any water in

942

I identify as Imi's brother you are my brother you don't need to identify as that

943
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:44,520
the fury that amputated his his hands so he could have paws what

944
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:56,280
that guy in japan who had surgery done on him to become a dog

945
02:30:57,160 --> 02:31:03,000
while they're fighting I think you're thinking I think I'm thinking of but I think we're thinking

946
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:11,800
of the same guy was I even supposed to add water to this I don't think I was supposed to add water

947
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:17,480

952
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:47,000

958
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:47,880
soon so that way you know what to what to do I'm sorry I've been like I've been I've been um neglecting

959
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:54,040
you um okay and now the last one is this one

960
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:05,080
thanks for the hard words yes thank you is this does this have a hole in it

961
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:16,840
I'm not gonna have a taste no and then this other person that also identified as a handicap

962
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:23,960
like wanted to be in a wheelchair or something this is gross oh wait I have a

963
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:30,360
I have a garbage can what am I doing they wanted to be in a wheelchair or something so they um

964
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:41,080
they laid down on train tracks and had the train like cut their legs off

965
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:53,480
okay now she's going in my trash and then the train did it because of course it would

966
02:33:56,040 --> 02:34:01,480
um how many do I put in here one yeah no I'm putting more than one

967
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:10,200
do not resuscitate at that point I mean like why would the train do that

968
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:15,400
why would the train do that is the train stupid

969
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:22,120
is the train stupid why would it do that

970
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:34,120
I mean can you be Japanese a little bit I took eight months of Japanese class but that doesn't

971
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:41,000
mean I can read it well and also I haven't like practiced in a long time

972
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:49,720
that's why I didn't name it as a as a language that I know because I don't really know it

973
02:34:49,720 --> 02:35:01,000
I can try reading what it says this says dekiyakari right dekiyakari oh you can't even see it

974
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:03,880
I don't know what dekiyakari means though

975
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:25,480
this says tsukuro tsukuro or bento there you go my very limited Japanese knowledge

976
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:35,720
oh ready to eat oh that's what it means enjoy your food ready to eat whoa first step stop watching

977
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:43,720
dumb shut up I will do as I please with my anime and no one's allowed to tell me what otherwise

978
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:54,440
I mean studying Japanese here gana and katakana is easy kanji is hard as fuck

979
02:35:55,400 --> 02:36:01,320
I find kanji to be easier because oftentimes like there you can find pictures in the kanji

980
02:36:01,320 --> 02:36:10,680
that help you remember what it means um yeah but that's just me that's just me being a little

981
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:12,040
special

982
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:23,880
I'm pretty sure kanji is based off of pictures anyways so it's not even just me it's just facts

983
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:36,760
there are a lot of kanji you're right you're right there are I think I think we're we're almost there

984
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:38,280
um

985
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:43,880
so now I just put it in this bag

986
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:53,320
kanji is easier if you learn slash you know Chinese that's true that's true that's very true

987
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:56,680
because I think they have the same meanings

988
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:02,040
oh this is the noodle oh okay okay

989
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:04,360
okay

990
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:22,360

for a Japanese bento but we're doing it so

1028
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:50,120
I'm trying to think of some crazy some other crazy shit internet shit I've seen

1029
02:41:51,480 --> 02:41:57,880
there's a lot apparently one guy tried to recreate uh I forget which youtuber it was

1030
02:41:57,880 --> 02:42:05,160
some vtuber's pee that's why I said that's why I posted my um my what does your oh she

1031
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:15,080
smell like post and I said okay use this to recreate my pee he like tracked like what kind

1032
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:23,720
of food she ate too which you know and then he would drink it while watching her like while watching

1033
02:42:23,720 --> 02:42:36,280
her what's her name Sui Suisei Suisei Suisei yeah the Sui piss yeah that that's okay I think

1034
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:41,960
that's so funny like like I know some people genuinely are really creeped out by that I think

1035
02:42:41,960 --> 02:42:48,120
it's the most funniest shit ever I think it's hilarious all right there's our meatballs I don't

1036
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:54,440
have a toothpick to put in the meatballs like they have here a toothpick but it's you know it's

1037
02:42:57,400 --> 02:43:02,360
I don't even need a toothpick to be honest because it already looks just like the packaging basically

1038
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:04,200
like

1039
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:08,360
