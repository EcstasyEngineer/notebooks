01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.340
I didn't see that it's a gel polish.

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:52.340
Oh, I'm so mad right now.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.340
Alright, you're right, you're right, you're right.

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.340
Sorry, okay, okay, okay.

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.340
Change of plans, change of plans.

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:00.340
We're going black and we're not going back

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.340
because black is the only other going out polish I have

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:09.340
and I don't have a UV lamp to cure this.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.340
I'm so sorry, I didn't realize this is a gel.

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.340
Oh, I'm a stupid bitch.

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.340
I want hot rod red, okay.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.340
I'm going to go...

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.340
What am I going to do?

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:24.340
Okay, let's wipe this off first with my, um, disgusting...

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:26.340
Ew.

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.340
With my disgusting snot.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.340
Snot napkins.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.340
Fuck, why am I such a dumb bitch?

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:37.340
This is why I need you in my life to help me.

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.340
No, I don't have to start from zero.

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:44.340
I'm just...

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:47.340
I just have to wipe off what's here.

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.340
I just have to wipe it all off.

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.340
I wasn't paying attention when I was shopping around.

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.340
I was wondering, I would have stayed here forever

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.340
waiting for it to dry.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.340
Thank you so much.

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.340
Thank you.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.340
Okay.

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:18.340
Is that good enough?

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.340
It kind of looks like I dipped my toenails

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:25.340
in some gross, like, purity cooch.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.340
Right?

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.340
I'm so tired.

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:35.340
Someone with a blue wrench mentioned it earlier.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.340
Most of the rest of us probably would not have noticed

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.340
your mistake.

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.340
I didn't see, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.340
I'm not a family boy, I'm sorry.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.340
Hold on, I'm sorry.

01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.340
Forgive me.

01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.340
Forgive me.

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:02.340
Okay, I'm gonna go give my black nail polish.

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:06.340
I'm also gonna give it my trash can.

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:10.340
Okay, let me actually wipe this well.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.340
Because I'm dumb, bitch.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.340
I'm actually so disappointed myself.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.340
I don't know, ow!

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.340
I don't know how I didn't see that it said gel.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.340
I didn't see that, I swear!

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.340
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.340
The girl you saw earlier was not me.

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:41.340
Ow, is that what it also kind of hurts too?

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:43.340
I mean, not that I'm complaining,

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:46.340
but something on my toenails is burning me.

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.340
Okay.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.340
No, that's just you.

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.340
Okay.

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.340
Okay.

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:04.340
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:08.340
I'll go get black nail polish that is not gel.

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.340
And I will also get the garbage can

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:16.340
because we be shittin' out all this paper towel

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:20.340
and I got nowhere to put it.

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:23.340
I'll be right back.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.340
Okay.

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:06.340
Okay.

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.340
Okay.

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.340
Okay.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.340
Okay.

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.340
Okay.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.340
Okay.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.340
Okay.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.340
Okay.

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.340
Okay.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.340
Okay.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.340
Okay.

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:30.340
Okay.

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:32.340
Okay.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.340
Okay.

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.340
Okay.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.340
Okay.

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.340
Okay.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.340
Okay.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:02.340
Why are you acting so gay?

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.340
My pants are fine.

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:11.340
I don't know, man.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.340
Beauty is pain.

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.340
Oh, shit.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:16.340
Off with the sweater!

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.340
Off with the sweater!

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.340
Oh, you little tease.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.340
Off with the sweater.

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.340
I'm not taking it off.

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:29.340
I already took it off for

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.340
my ASMR.

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.340
It felt super fucking weird doing that, by the way.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.340
I took off my shirt for my ASMR stream

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.340
so that you could hear my heartbeat better.

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.340
And, um,

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.340
I felt like I was like a mother, like,

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.340
breastfeeding her baby.

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.340
Which is like the worst I hate that feeling.

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.340
I don't like that feeling.

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.340
That's the worst feeling ever.

01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.340
I don't like it.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.340
So I'm not doing that this time.

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:14.340
Thank you, Link, for becoming a pinball.

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.340
Off with the skin as well?

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:20.340
Yeah.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.340
Off.

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.340
Feed the mic stand?

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.340
What does that mean?

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.340
Like, milk?

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.340
I don't want to get black on it.

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:36.340
Black on what?

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.340
Right, I brought...

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.340
Whoa, I'm dizzy.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.340
I brought a trash can.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.340
Amy prefers to be on the receiving and breastfeeding.

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.340
Aha!

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.340
You know what, actually...

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.340
Oh god, I'm gonna puke.

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:02.340
Sorry, I'm not gonna puke.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.340
Well, I might.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.340
I'm gonna puke on stream.

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.340
Actually, maybe I shouldn't drink more.

01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.340
How much did you drink so far?

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:16.340
Um, around half of this much.

01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.340
So like...

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.340
Are you gay?

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:24.340
Why are you acting so gay?

01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:27.340
Barotiped $3.33.

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:30.340
A stethoscope helps with ASMR heartbeat recording.

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:33.340
Also, 10 out of 10 on that last one.

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:35.340
And every other before that.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.340
Thank you.

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:41.340
So I drink, um...

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:48.340
Half of this, which this is 750ml.

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.340
So about 350ml.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:52.340
Is that half of 750?

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:58.340
7 divided by 2 is 250?

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:02.340
And then add another...

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.340
Oh fuck.

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.340
Oh fuck.

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:11.340
Add another 50%?

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.340
375.

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:13.340
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:14.340
I didn't look at chat at all.

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:19.340
375, 375, 375.

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:20.340
Yup.

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:23.340
I drink about 375ml.

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.340
This isn't gel, right?

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:27.340
This is not what I've been using.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.340
It's not gel.

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.340
3.5, YEAH!

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.340
I got it right, right?

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:36.340
I'm gonna use more math homework.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.340
You know what's really funny?

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.340
A lot of people thought I was faking it.

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:42.340
Like faking being bad at math.

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:44.340
For that stream.

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.340
Dude, you don't even know.

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:51.340
I got faking nail polish on my light.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:55.340
You don't even know half of the story.

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.340
I'm genuinely really really bad at math.

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:01.340
And it's honestly really depressing.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.340
And it makes me really sad.

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.340
Like no, you guys don't understand how bad...

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.340
Someone faking sent me a marshmallow asking if I had dyscalcula.

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.340
Dyscalcula?

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.340
Is that it?

01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:15.340
I might have dyscalcula, I don't know.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:19.340
But I've gotten this far without the diagnosis, so I don't know.

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.340
I used to be in um...

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:30.340
I used to be in IB math with my bestie when I was in high school.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:33.340
I just wanted to be with my bestie and I was like,

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.340
Sure, I'll take IB with you.

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.340
And it was so stressful for me.

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:42.340
Because every like for our math classes.

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:46.340
Sorry, if you don't know what IB is, it's basically AP classes, right?

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:51.340
And it was so stressful for me because

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:57.340
Like for every faking 30 minutes that my friend had to study for math class.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:01.340
I had to study for like 2 hours to get the same grade.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:04.340
And I hated it because, you know,

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:10.340
My friend was having such an easy time with it and she never had to study for tests.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:14.340
And I always had to study like twice as hard as her,

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:18.340
Three times as hard as her just to keep up and get the same grades as her.

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.340
And it made me want to kill myself.

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.340
It wasn't fair.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:27.340
Or even lower grades than her too sometimes.

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:30.340
And I remember during exam time,

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:37.340
I studied like every day for multiple hours and she just kind of like chillaxed with us in class.

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:42.340
And like casually did some practice questions with the whole group in class

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.340
And then didn't study at all other than that.

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:47.340
And she got the same grade as me.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:51.340
I wanted to jump off of a bridge in Minecraft after that.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.340
Because I would stay after class just to study math.

01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:57.340
Oh, you're gonna make me cry.

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:59.340
Shut up, Amy.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.340
Bro, high school was a shit time.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.340
I never want to go back to that.

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.340
How long has the stream been?

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.340
I can't see when how?

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.340
One hour and 24 minutes.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.340
Okay, I'll try to keep...

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:22.340
I'll try to keep going until two hours, I think.

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.340
Going, my voice gets so annoying when I'm drunk.

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:27.340
It's because I can't keep up.

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:30.340
Okay, I'm gonna wait until this is dry now.

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:32.340
It was pain.

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.340
Yeah, stay in middle school.

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.340
Ahahahahaha...

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.340
Ahahahahaha...

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.340
Funny.

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.340
Or should I say cuddly?

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.340
Your voice is 10 out of 10.

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.340
When I'm drunk it's annoying as fuck, dude.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.340
Cuddly!

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:03.340

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.340
I really hope I'm not annoying my neighbors by screaming.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:14.340
I'm trying to wipe off the red at the bottom here.

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.340
I'm only getting black.

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:24.340
I gotta keep hiding my viewer count.

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.340
I don't wanna see that shit, it makes me nervous.

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.340
There we go. Is your foot still hurting?

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.340
My foot still hurting?

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.340
Are you an OG that knows about my foot cramps?

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.340
I have really bad foot cramps.

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.340
I get really bad foot cramps sometimes.

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.340
Yes, it doesn't go away ever.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.340
I was born with it because...

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.340
I don't know.

01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.340
They said something about me having arch problems.

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.340
I feel like my arch is cute.

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.340
There's nothing wrong with it. It's really cute.

01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.340
I'm not tensing up my foot at all.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.340
This is how my foot is shaped.

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.340
It is completely relaxed.

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.340
It is completely...

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.340
It is...

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:12.340
It's completely relaxed at the moment.

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:16.340
I'm not tensing it up at all.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.340
I feel like it's a perfect shape.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.340
It is cute.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.340

It's a good shape, right?

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.340
Don't tell me it's not a good shape.

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.340
So, yeah.

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:38.340

01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.340
But I'm too lazy for that.

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:44.340
I'm too lazy, so I don't.

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.340
Yeah, it's a great shape.

01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:48.340
Perfect shape, that's what I'm saying.

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:50.340

I don't want to cry. I don't like to cry. I think it's cringe.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.800
Blow your nose!

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.800
You're right.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.800
Guys, I know we love her but didn't Strawny say she would kick our butts if we made her cry?

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.800
Hold on.

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.800
I'm okay.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.800
I'm okay. I don't know what you're talking about.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:32.800
I am completely sane and sober and not crying at all.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.800
You know this is the first time I've actually actually shed a tear on stream?

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.800
I mean I didn't shed a tear but like I was like close to it.

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:48.800
It's so cringe though.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800
It's so cringe.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:51.800
Why are you crying on stream for me?

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.800
I mean everyone can do it out there.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.800
I don't judge other people for doing it but I feel like it's cringe if I do it.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.800
So I don't like to do it.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.800
Is this three?

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.800
One, two, three, one, two, three.

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.800
Okay, last one or three.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.800
I don't know if I'll have enough. We'll see.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.800
One, two, three.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.800
I think we will. I think I will.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.800
No.

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.800
Strawny knows where my butt is.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.800
Anyways, Amy is the best sister in the world.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.800
And she's the only girl I need in my life.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:29.800
And I love her a lot.

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.800
Are you gay?

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.800
Why are you acting so gay?

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.800
Are you gay?

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.800
Why are you acting so gay?

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.800
Are you gay?

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.800
Why are you acting so gay?

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.800
Stop loving me.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.800
These little bitch tears.

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.800
They're not bitch tears.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.800
You're the bitch here.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:08.800
Shut up.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.800
I ran out of tiny ones so we're gonna have to make the last couple ones kind of thick.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800
I just think so.

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.800
Is this one tiny?

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.800
No, that one's pretty...

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.800
Kik.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.800
Okay, we're almost done with these nails.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.800
How do I do this? I just play.

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:10.800
There was this one person in my community that I kind of trusted a lot because they were part of my friend group.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:19.800
They were part of my Minecraft, not my Minecraft streamer friend group, but they were just part of my small streamer friend group.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:29.800
You know, I trusted all those people in my small streamer friend group because we were all cringy little streamers that streamed art in Minecraft.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.800
Right?

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.800
I know I was family-friendly before.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:41.800
Okay, not completely family-friendly, but like, I was pretty family-friendly if you ask me.

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.800
Are you gay?

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.800
Why are you acting so gay?

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.800
I'm on Bro Tip $6.90.

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:51.800
Hey, I heard you drinking some Irish cream.

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:55.800
Well, I got some Irish cream for your right here pants grab.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:58.800
Are you Irish?

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:05.800
I don't mean to be rude, but every Irish slash Scottish accent just kind of reminds me of Shrek.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:09.800
Even like, strongy's accent reminds me of Shrek, don't tell her I said that.

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.800
Not in a bad way or anything, I just think it does.

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.800
I don't know if I could be sexually attracted to Shrek.

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.800
God, I want him to step on me.

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:21.800
I'll step on you if you want.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.800
What was I saying?

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.800
Right, when I was a small Minecraft streamer, there was this person in my community that I trusted a lot.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.800
You know, we would watch each other's streams because I had like a little stream friend group.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:40.800
And one time, someone was like, hey, by the way, I got on a call with X person and they were shit-talking you.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.800
And I was like, shit-talking me?

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:53.800
I mean, not surprising, there's a lot of shit-talk you could do on me, I'm pretty easy as shit-talk.

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:59.800
But they were like, yeah, they were shit-talking me and also they were trying to...

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.800
Groom me.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:06.800
And I was like, Groom you!

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:13.800
In my server, apparently more likely than you think, cause that person was a minor.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:20.800
And anyways, that broke my trust, that broke my trust in any new internet friends for a long time.

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.800
Cause I felt so bad for, cause that person was like a really good viewer friend of mine.

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.800
Cause you know, I was a family-friendly Minecraft streamer, so I attracted a lot of kids, which was fine.

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.800
Cause you know, we'd be up in here family-friendly Minecraft streaming.

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:42.800
So I attracted a lot of kids and I was like, oh man, this is all my fucking fault, dude.

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:44.800
All my fault.

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:49.800
Anyways, so that's why we don't deal, we don't, we don't do kids anymore.

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:52.800
We don't do that here.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:55.800
I still feel bad about it till this day.

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.800
I can't believe I let that happen.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.800
Cause they were like friends with me.

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.800
Guys, don't let anyone groom you.

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.800
What is with Minecraft streamer?

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.800
Okay, I didn't do anything.

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.800
I didn't do anything.

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.800
I just kind of didn't know what was happening.

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.800
I saw the red flags too, but I was a stupid bitch.

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.800
I mean, I'm always a stupid bitch. What do you expect from me?

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.800
I'd always be bitchin' and stupid.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.800
Let me take a shwig.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.800
I have worse stories than that, but I can't say them.

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.800
I can't say them.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:44.800
Yeah, don't let anyone groom you except for me.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.800
But make sure you're over 18 if you want me to groom you.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.800
Fuck.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:57.800
My thunder cunt of an ex tried to groom me and manipulate me.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.800
F me up, yeah.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.800
I know.

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.800
I know.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:03.800
I know.

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:04.800
I know.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.800
I know.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:06.800
I know.

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.800
F me up, yeah.

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:10.800
I know.

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.800
It sucks balls.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.800
But what if I want you to groom me?

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.800
Make me worse.

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.800
No, I'll do it.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.800
I'll do it if you want me to.

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.800
Anything for you, baby girl.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.800
Or baby boy.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:29.800
Or a brother.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.800
I'm getting my freakin' forehead sweat all over my microphone.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.800
What time is it? 1.47.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.800
Okay.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:42.800
Thank you for becoming a pin pal dragon.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:46.800
Imagine getting groomed by Fond de la bosom.

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.800
That's the only girl I'd like groom me.

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.800
Oh, sorry.

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.800
Didn't see you there.

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:01.800
Fond de la bosom and no one else.

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.800
Only...

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:10.800
Only Fond de la bosom is allowed to groom me.

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.800
I guess you too.

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.800
Abuse?

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.800
Abuse these nights.

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:28.800
Man, I wish I could get drunk more often, but I legitimately get so much trouble breathing.

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.800
I don't know why.

01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.800
Is that normal?

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.800
Does that happen to you too?

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.800
I'm so sorry.

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.800
It's a really hard time reading chat because I'm...

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.800
I can't see.

01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:40.800
It doesn't happen to you.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:43.800
You don't get a hard time breathing when you're drunk.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:48.800
I literally feel like I'm going to pass out from like...

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.800
Well, not right now, but when it gets really bad, I feel like I'm going to pass out from lack of oxygen.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:54.800
No, it's not normal.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.800
Wait, it's not normal?

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.800
Wait, it's not normal?

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.800
Dude, when it gets really bad, I'm literally like...

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.800
Holy shit, I'm going to die.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.800
Like, I'm literally... I can't breathe.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:08.800
Be careful?

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.800
Well, I'm okay now.

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.800
I just... I'm just heavy breathing.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.800
But like, when it gets really bad, it's like really bad, you know?

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:19.800
Wait, you might be slightly allergic?

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.800
No way.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:25.800
I have passed out drunk before.

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.800
Me too, I have too, but like...

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.800
Well, not really.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.800
Passed out drunk means like you don't remember what happened, right?

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.800
You should get an inhaler.

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.800
Poster check.

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.800
No, posture doesn't fix it.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:44.800
I'd like to be groomed by any.

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:46.800
Turn me into your ideal big brother.

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.800
Of course, Pookey.

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.800
Of course, thank you for the five dollars.

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.800
Oh shit, one of my toenails is coming off.

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:07.800
Let me put it back on, I'm sorry.

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:13.800
When someone consumes alcohol, the central nervous system is slowed down,

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.800
which results in a slower breathing rate and depth of breathing.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:18.800
This is known as alcohol...

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.800
Alcohol induced respiratory depression.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.800
It's normal, you're saying it's normal, right?

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.800
You're saying it's normal, right?

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:32.800
I can't be allergic to alcohol, you don't understand.

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.800
I can't do it, that can't be happening right now.

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:37.800
I won't let it happen.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:39.800
I can't be allergic to alcohol.

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.800
It's not fair, it's not fair.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.800
Not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair.

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.800
Passed out just means you passed out.

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.800
Black dealt means you don't remember.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.800
Oh, black dealt means you don't remember.

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:53.800
Okay.

01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:58.800
I will paint these toenails.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:00.800
I will do it.

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:14.800
Plop, plop, plop, plop, get painted, get painted, get painted, get painted.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.800
It's fine, just get a pen, I don't have an api pen.

01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.800
It's not the case.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:34.800

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.800

Yeah.

01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:03.380
We die together.

01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:08.380
Let me just keep painting.

01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:14.380
Oh here, I have one story to tell you, but it's not that fun, I'm sorry.

01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:20.380
When I was younger, um...

01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:24.380
Hey Sastilda, wake up, your brother is concerned.

01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:27.380
Don't worry, please don't be worried about me, please don't be worried.

01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:31.380
I promise you I'm okay, I promise you I'm fine.

01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:34.380
I love you.

01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:38.380
Don't worry, I'm okay.

01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:41.380
Why are you concerned? There's nothing to be concerned about.

01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:44.380
I always get really dramatic like this.

01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:49.380
Right, um, when I was younger, so my mom's divorced, right?

01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:52.380
I mean, our mom's divorced.

01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:54.380
Sorry to break it to you like this.

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.380
I don't know if you know.

01:55:55.380 --> 01:56:00.380
My mom's divorced, right? She has, um...

01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:04.380
She's had multiple boyfriends in the past,

01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:09.380
and one of her boyfriends had this daughter,

01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:16.380
and her name was, let's call her Steve from Minecraft.

01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:20.380
So one of her boyfriends had this daughter called Steve from Minecraft,

01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:24.380
and he, uh, his daughter was the same age as me, actually.

01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:28.380
So, you know, they were, we were kind of like expected to play together.

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.380
What are you guys saying? Gay?

01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:32.380
Why are you so gay?

01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:35.380
I'm not a misstep, ten dollars. Love you, Emmy.

01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:38.380
I love you too, thank you.

01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:41.380
Right, he had this daughter called Steve from Minecraft,

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:45.380
and because we were the same age, unfortunately,

01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:48.380
we were forced to play together a lot.

01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:53.380
The problem is that Steve from Minecraft had a really bad...

01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:57.380
had a really bad problem with, um...

01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:00.380
compulsive lying?

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:04.380
She had a really bad problem with compulsive lying,

01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:08.380
and she would lie about, like, everything and anything,

01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:11.380
and because I was stupid little bitch and I still am,

01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:14.380
I would believe her for every single lie.

01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:16.380
She used to be like,

01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:20.380
Yeah, we got werewolves in the forest next to our house,

01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:23.380
and then any time I would come over, I'd be like,

01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:25.380
Where are the werewolves?

01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.380
Are they gonna get us while we're sleeping?

01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:31.380
Stupid, Emmy.

01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:33.380
Um...

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:37.380
One time she locked me in her fucking bathroom and she was like,

01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:40.380
The werewolves are coming! The werewolves are coming!

01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:43.380
The werewolves are coming!

01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:44.380
She was...

01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:47.380
She had a really bad problem with compulsive lying,

01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:49.380
and I felt for every single one.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:51.380
But one time, right?

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:55.380
My cousin did the same thing to me.

01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:56.380
Quite a moment.

01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:59.380
But one time, um...

01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:02.380
I slept over at her house,

01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:05.380
and, um...

01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:09.380
I woke up, right, and she was like,

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:12.380
I cut your hair,

01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.380
and I looked this bitch in the face,

01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:15.380
and I was like,

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.380
You fucking didn't.

01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:18.380
No, you didn't.

01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:21.380
I was so over all her lies,

01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:23.380
and all her bullying,

01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:24.380
and I was like,

01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:25.380
Yeah, sure.

01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:27.380
Whatever!

01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:30.380
You didn't cut my hair.

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:32.380
And then she's like,

01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.380
No really,

01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:35.380
I cut your hair while you were sleeping.

01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:37.380
And I looked at the pillow,

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.380
and I saw like,

01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.380
I need to drink more.

01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:46.380
