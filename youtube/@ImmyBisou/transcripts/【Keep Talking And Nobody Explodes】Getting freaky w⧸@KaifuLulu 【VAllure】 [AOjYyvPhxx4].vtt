03:30.000 --> 03:55.000
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

04:00.000 --> 04:15.000
Oh wait. Oh shit, my model turned off! Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. That wasn't supposed to happen. You're muted on my stream, too. Hold on, hold on.

04:15.000 --> 04:23.000
Uh, application audio capture, discord call. Okay, say something?

04:23.000 --> 04:39.000
Stop party people. Okay. Hi. Hello. Okay. Hi. Let me connect my model again. Oh shit, my phone. Okay.

04:39.000 --> 04:52.000
Hello. Apologies for the scoff. It was working before stream. It was. We even started early just in case, or we hopped on call early. Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 05:09.000
Hey, well. Oh, I just realized audio is bad. Okay, let me turn that down a little bit. Is audio okay on my side? Your audio's fine. Yeah, is my audio okay?

05:09.000 --> 05:30.000
Is the background music to voice ratio to Emmy ratio okay? Yeah, is it okay? Audio's fine? Come on, chat on my side. You gotta step it up. You gotta step it up.

05:31.000 --> 05:50.000
We should tell them. Okay, we're both streaming on YouTube. So if you want to see the other person's perspective, because this is a two person perspective game, then you should go to the other person's stream too.

05:51.000 --> 06:11.000
Um, I think I have you in the, in my, um, description. In my title, I should. Oh, yeah, yeah, me too, me too. So guys, yeah, click on that. Oh, like, go check out the other person too. Yes. Yeah, you're in my, why is my bottle lagging? Oh, yeah. Okay, okay.

06:11.000 --> 06:28.000
Okay, thanks guys. Thanks for stepping up. Okay. Yeah, like you said, this is a tool, tool perspective thing. So I also have Emmy socials in the description of my stream, but you can also click the little at thing in the title, whatever you want.

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
Open it on two screens. Do will this shit. If you don't have two screens, open one on your phone and one on your computer, unless you broke, which I'm sorry.

06:38.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, open them both up and watch them both. Okay. Okay. Are we ready to, oh wait, wait, wait, one more, one more announcement. The stream will only be one hour long because I'm going through a heat wave and I'm fucking hot in here. Yeah.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah. Yes. Send some ice cream funds to me, please.

06:57.000 --> 07:07.000
Don't do that. AC funds, let's go. We need to upgrade her to a new apartment, guys. We gotta step up.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
No, it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Okay. Let's, let's, let's do this. Okay.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
Okay. Do you want to diffuse first or do you want to give instructions first?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I'll give instructions first.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay.

07:25.000 --> 07:37.000
All right. Okay. So Emmy and I did play a little bit of this upstream so you can see a little bit of check marks and everything. We kind of skip to point two and point three because we were like, easy money.

07:37.000 --> 07:50.000
This is easy. So let's start at 3.1. Let's not even do the other two because we beat the last one in the level of self. Okay. Okay. Okay.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is five minutes, three minutes, three seconds. I'm so excited.

07:59.000 --> 08:10.000
Oh, why is my model frozen? Oh, okay. I think my Wi-Fi is being a little shitty. So, Mubby, if the shit is wrong. Okay.

08:10.000 --> 08:18.000
Okay. So we have, let's start with Simon Says because we did Simon Says before.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Simon Says. Yes. Okay. Got it.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
Okay. Okay. Yellow blink. It's blinking yellow. One time.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
We've never done Simon Says. We've never done Simon Says. No, we've never done Simon Says.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay. Okay. Wires. Wires. Wires.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
So I have, are you there at Wires? Yes. Wires. Okay. Okay. So I have white, blue, white, and that's the only three I have. So there's three.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
Okay. Cut the second wire. Boom. Noise. Okay. Simon Says.

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
Blinking yellow. Are you control f-ing? Yes. That's exactly what you did. Yeah, that is the smart way to do it.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
One of the four colored buttons will flash using the correct table below. Press the button with the corresponding color. The original button will flash.

09:06.000 --> 09:15.000
Okay. Sorry. I shouldn't read it. I don't get it.

09:15.000 --> 09:26.000
So, so. Oh, fuck. I can't remember what it looks like now. Um, if it's blink, I think it's corresponded to the thing. I don't know. You can figure it out.

09:26.000 --> 09:35.000
Okay. Well, the right button. You said it flash yellow. Yes. Yes. Well, for me, the yellow one is the right, the button on the right.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
Yes. So it, oh shit. Fuck. Fuck. I'm wrong. Press the button with the corresponding color.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah. So if I have yellow, then that means it's something on your side.

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
Green. Green. Fuck. Oh, it's a yellow and then green. Oh, no. Okay. Um, that's two strikes.

09:59.000 --> 10:11.000
One more. Okay. Blue. Blue. Fuck. We did. Oh, I don't get it. Oh, wait. It's the serial. Oh, we were supposed to look at the serial number two.

10:11.000 --> 10:22.000
Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. It's okay. We can retry. We can retry. That was just a practice run. We were just practicing warm up. Yeah, that was just a warm up.

10:22.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay. Um, oh shit. I don't have Simon Says anymore. Okay. I have the button, the button. We've done that one before. It's a white button. This is whole.

10:33.000 --> 10:46.000
Um, hold the button. Okay. Hold the button. Okay. There's a red strip.

10:46.000 --> 10:58.000
Um, release when the countdown timer has a one in any position. Boom, baby. Okay. Okay. This is the word one. This is the one that looks like a calculator.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
Remember that one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the word on the screen is you are spelled Y O U space A R E.

11:08.000 --> 11:19.000
Y O U. Uh, bottom right. Bottom right. Nope. Nope. Okay. Now it is the word you are.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
Remember, you have to look at step two as well.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
Oh, wait, you like you and are you the letters you and are. Yes.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Okay. Um, top.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Okay.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Sure.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Okay. Okay. Now, now it's the word first.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It's the word first. And then let me know.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
Oh, I think you have to ask me what like so so if it's the word first, then I have to tell you what what word it is in that eyeball location.

12:07.000 --> 12:16.000
Okay. Okay. Okay. So what's the eyeball location? Top right. Top right is the word. Uh, so a U H H H. So now you have to go to step two.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
Uh, ready? Nothing left. What? Okay. Yes. Right. No. Okay. Nice. Nice. Okay. Okay. We're getting it.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
We're getting it. Now it's the word C C E E.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Um, okay. Bottom, bottom, bottom right.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Bottom right is the word nothing.

12:40.000 --> 12:48.000
Okay. Uh, U H H H. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Okay. Next. Read R E A D.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Uh, middle, middle right.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Middle right is the word wait.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Uh, U H H H. No blank.

12:59.000 --> 13:11.000
Okay. Nice. Noice. Noice. Noice. Okay. We just have one more. Fuck. I don't know what this thing's called either. It's like there's five. Fuck. Shut up snooze. Okay. Shut up. Okay. Okay.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
So there's a five letters and then up arrow down arrow per letter. I think we're supposed to spell a word or something.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Five letters.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, one, two, three, four, five. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I found it. Passwords. Okay. Cool. Okay. The button above and below each letter.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
We're so I can do the possible only one time.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Oh, that's a lot of you, but we have 40 seconds.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Only one combination of the available letters.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Is there a word?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Uh, U G M U B is what I see right now.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Oh.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Can you press up or down and see what it says?

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah. Um, so, so the first column is the letters D T G Q U column.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
So, so, you know how there's like four, there's five letters, right? So when I cycle through the first, oh shit, I'm dead. Okay.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Damn it.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
It's okay. It's okay. We had that puzzle on the other one as well. So let's let's try to do that one first.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
Then okay, I'm going to retry one more time. If you can't get this one, you want to switch perspectives? Yes. Yes.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
Stupid rain downstream. I feel like we're doing 10 times worse.

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
It's okay. It's okay. It's the heat. It's melting your brain. Okay. Let's do passwords first. Um, so, okay. So there's five letters, right?

14:36.000 --> 14:45.000
And the up arrows, I can cycle through each one of the letters. So the first letter in the five letter sequence has such and such letters.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Does that make sense? Okay. Do you want me to tell you what the letters are?

14:50.000 --> 15:01.000
Or okay. So the first, the first letter in the sequence is J N D G Y T. Those are the first sequence of letters.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Okay. And then you might need a pen and paper.

15:07.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't know. Um, so the next sequence is Y H A D J B. Okay.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
And then the third sequence, because I think you're supposed to make a word out of like all of the letters.

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
So you're going to have to be super big brain for this. Okay. Three is J A Z F R C.

15:34.000 --> 15:49.000
Okay. And then let me know if I'm going too fast. And then four is C K W R E I. Okay.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
And then the last sequence is L E M A I O.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Okay. You're like confident.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
I'm going to tell you to spell a random word and I don't think it's going to work. Can you spell the word?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Spell which? W H I C H.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
You cannot spell that word, girl. You can't. You can't have the letters.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
Okay. So the first, okay. Maybe the first sequence of letters will be able to help you determine which word it is.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah, say it again. Say it again. I think I understand that. Say it again.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Okay. Cool. So it's J N D G Y T.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
What's the next one? What's the next one? I get it. I understand now.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
Okay. Okay. D J B Y H A.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Okay. Okay. What's the next one?

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
Okay. J A Z F R C.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Okay. Spell three.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Three. Three. Three. Three.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Oh my God. You're so smart.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Okay. What's the next one?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Simon says. Simon says.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
You got this. You got this.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
I didn't understand this one either. One of the four color buttons will flash using the correct table.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
We'll press the button with the corresponding color.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Okay. Which one is flashing?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Blue.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Okay. Does the zero number contain a vowel?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Uh, er, er, yes.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Okay. Um, press the red one.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Red. Oh! Oh!

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Okay. Okay. Now it's blue, red. Blue, red.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Blue, red.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
What do I do now?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
What do I do now? Blue, red?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Okay. Blue, red.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Um, try red?

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Red and then...

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Red and then...

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
And then, and then what?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Red, red? No, that's wrong!

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Wait, I didn't understand this one either!

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
So, so, so the sequence on my side is...

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Well, you got the first one, so you're one step closer.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
So the sequence on my side is blue, red.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Okay. Blue, red. Okay. So try...

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Try red and then blue?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Red. Oh!

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I accidentally hit something.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
I accidentally hit green and it didn't give me a fucking thing.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Red. Oh, it's not red anymore!

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It's not red anymore!

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I think, I think after we get one strike,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
it might affect the side of the screen.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Green, yellow.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Okay. I have two strikes now. I have two strikes now.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh, red, red, green.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Red, green. Oh, pug. Okay.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Blue, red, yellow. Blue, red, yellow.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
Okay. Red, green, blue.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Red, green, blue.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Oh my god.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
We're figuring it out. We're figuring it out.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Blue, red, fucking yellow is the last one.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
So blue, red, yellow, green? Or no?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh, I died.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Oh, we're so close!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Really? Are we actually close?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Because, because after Simon says it's the button

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
and then the button's so fucking easy.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay. That's okay.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Okay.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Cool. So now, everybody look at,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
look at Amy's perspective.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
We're gonna switch.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
We're gonna switch sides.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Yes.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I got you, dog.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
I got you.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I need a little smaller there.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Which one did you do?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Oh, wait.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
I can only do the first bomb.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Oh, what?

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Oh, fuck, because you had to redo the tutorial and everything?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Mm-hmm.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Okay, we can do this usually.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It's okay. Okay, cool.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Okey-doke.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
All right. Let me go to section two, yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Okay, start. This is easy. This is easy.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Okay. Sounds good. We're gonna spree-run this shit.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Let's go! Let's go!

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Let's go! We're record! Let's go!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Okay.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Um, okay.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I have the symbols. Let's go with the symbols.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Okay, symbols, symbols, symbols. Got you.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I have an upside-down question mark.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I have a B with a T in it.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I have a smiley face sticking its tongue out.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
And then I have the little monkey creature with the E at the bottom.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Oh, okay, okay. I think I know what you're talking about.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
What's the upside? Okay, I think I found it.

42:14.800 --> 42:20.720
where the fuck is it do you remember what that one's called oh I found it okay on the

42:20.720 --> 42:24.880
subject of memory okay there's a four on the screen uh press the button in the fourth position

42:26.240 --> 42:36.480
four okay um the next one is a three uh first position okay that's a three okay okay the next

42:36.480 --> 42:45.360
one's a three again third position oh fuck okay the next one is a one

42:47.840 --> 42:53.520
same position as the one you press in stage one so that would be the fourth position okay okay cool

42:54.800 --> 43:01.600
that one again same label as stage one was that four yeah yeah okay cool cool

43:02.160 --> 43:08.240
yay that was easy that was easy yeah that was pretty easy okay did you unlock stage three

43:08.880 --> 43:16.560
let me see um let me treat yes I unlocked stage three

43:21.840 --> 43:25.920
okay should I try let's go to two yeah go to two

43:26.640 --> 43:35.360
three point two you mean yeah yeah three point two okay start it gives us five minutes that feels

43:35.360 --> 43:42.480
like a long time right for real when you're fighting for your life it does seem like a long time

43:44.080 --> 43:54.320
okay I don't see anything what what oh sorry it was upside down okay I have um one I have six wires

43:54.320 --> 44:02.240
is that six okay if it's all of them then it's six okay I have three yellow ones uh two red ones

44:02.240 --> 44:12.960
and one blue one um did you have any red I just said I had three red I need two red okay okay uh

44:12.960 --> 44:21.760
cut the fourth wire okay good okay cool next I have um the color Simon says oh Simon says okay

44:22.000 --> 44:25.760
uh bowel in serial number yes no maybe so

44:29.200 --> 44:38.560
no no okay uh oh my god sorry my light's turned off um it's flashing red it's flashing blue

44:38.560 --> 44:47.280
hit blue I thought the ant came back to your water bottle bro okay blue okay um now it's flashing

44:47.360 --> 44:50.320
red green red green blue green

44:54.160 --> 45:02.960
what the fuck what I didn't know that the freaking um the okay red green green red green green

45:03.600 --> 45:04.320
blue green green

45:04.640 --> 45:14.160
red green green yellow blue green green red

45:15.360 --> 45:21.760
oh my god did we do it okay we did it okay okay noise next one I've never seen before so

45:22.720 --> 45:28.080
there's one two three it's like a square with one two three on the left and then abc on the right

45:28.160 --> 45:35.680
and then there's like wires oh this looks complicated okay we have three minutes there's

45:35.680 --> 45:39.360
arrows right on top and bottom yeah there's an error on the top and then error on the bottom

45:39.360 --> 45:42.480
okay god I can't fucking read let me let me try to fucking

45:42.800 --> 45:57.440
okay what the fuck does that mean okay what color are the wires uh red and blue I mean

45:58.640 --> 46:06.960
red red and black red and black brother color black okay hold on what does that mean what do you mean

46:06.960 --> 46:17.680
oh oh it's the first wire what's the color the first wire red red red okay cut if connected to

46:17.680 --> 46:22.960
c is connected to c it's connected to b it's connected on the left side to one and then it goes to b

46:22.960 --> 46:27.120
and then the black wire is connected to the three and it's also connected to the b

46:28.480 --> 46:35.760
fuck me okay um oh I get it I get it okay so so it's one b is the red right

46:36.720 --> 46:47.200
yes yes okay what's the black one three b three b oh nice uh cut if connected to b yeah cut the

46:47.200 --> 46:55.920
third black wire connected to b okay now okay now what's on your screen the same thing oh oh oh oh

46:56.080 --> 46:59.120
you need a you need a press an arrow I think oh which one

47:02.240 --> 47:08.320
upper down cut the wire to the direction I don't know click down maybe

47:10.320 --> 47:16.000
okay okay okay okay so now I have um four five six on the left and then abc on the right

47:16.800 --> 47:23.760
so um four is connected to four is a blue wire and it's connected to a five is a red

47:23.760 --> 47:33.360
cut that one oh cut no what for a yeah it was a blue wire oh I think you have to start from

47:33.360 --> 47:38.960
from one to one down okay start start from one

47:42.960 --> 47:49.120
start from one there's no one there's no one okay then they go to the next it's the first one four

47:49.120 --> 47:57.920
it's four five six oh fuck oh shit my nuts oh my goodness okay what's the next one okay five is a

47:57.920 --> 48:03.840
red wire connected to a and then six is a black wire connected to c and I have 30 seconds left

48:04.560 --> 48:11.360
red wire that's connected to c cut if connected to a or c so cut the red wire

48:12.320 --> 48:20.320
you just made me die okay I think what the issue is I think on the first panel I had to tell you

48:20.320 --> 48:26.800
everything I thought we just need to cut one wire but no I think we have to cut every single one

48:27.600 --> 48:34.880
and then we can move on to the next panel I think I didn't quite get it but it's okay

48:35.680 --> 48:42.160
press retry oh okay that's okay then do over time I hope you get this again I want to

48:43.200 --> 48:48.960
try to decode it oh there's two sides of this oh fuck me okay okay so let's start with the wires

48:48.960 --> 48:54.720
there's three wires two black and one blue two black one blue two black one blue two black one blue

48:54.720 --> 48:59.440
sorry I'm scrolling two black one blue ah that's the wrong fucking thing three wires two black one

48:59.440 --> 49:01.440
three wires two black one blue

49:05.760 --> 49:13.040
cut the last water a white wire no oh shit if there's no red wires cut the second wire might be

49:14.480 --> 49:22.080
okay I can't read okay okay okay it's okay um let's start with Simon says again um it's green

49:22.080 --> 49:34.080
and we have one we have one strike vowel wait vowel oh vowel vowel um vowel vowel is a is a vowel

49:35.120 --> 49:45.760
yes okay yes one strike vowel what color green green yellow hit yellow oh sorry blue

49:45.760 --> 49:54.160
fuck me okay a yellow hit yellow I didn't blue it it made me explode oh shit might be

49:58.880 --> 50:02.640
hold on one more time one more time let me redo myself you want to try one more time

50:03.360 --> 50:11.920
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever I need myself okay okay okay I can't see anything oh what is this

50:12.880 --> 50:21.920
okay wires again um one two three five wires two black one white one red and one blue

50:23.120 --> 50:28.800
okay uh one red mm-hmm is there more than one yellow there's no yellow

50:29.520 --> 50:39.840
fuck uh you have a black cut the first wire okay um okay Simon says again um okay there's no strikes

50:39.840 --> 50:52.400
right no strikes no vowels and right now it's flashing um red blue hit blue okay um okay red red

50:53.520 --> 50:54.080
blue blue

50:57.680 --> 51:01.600
red red yellow blue blue red

51:01.920 --> 51:04.400
okay

51:10.560 --> 51:14.240
excuse me okay so now we have wires again this time they run um

51:14.240 --> 51:24.880
vertical vertical they run vertical so there's a no it's not the same one as before

51:25.680 --> 51:30.160
I know it's complicated wires there's a fucking bend diagram

51:32.000 --> 51:37.760
okay hold on hell fuck I need a I might need a pull out pencil and paper for this shit

51:37.760 --> 51:43.600
okay it's okay we still have three minutes you got this you got this okay um stop calling me I'm mine

51:45.440 --> 51:54.640
I'm mine so there's four wires okay are there like stars at the bottom and everything and

51:54.720 --> 52:00.880
then lights at the top there's lights at the top but there's no stars okay no stars oh hold on let me

52:00.880 --> 52:15.760
look at the okay okay all right so all the leds are on no

52:18.320 --> 52:23.600
there's okay you're gonna have to be so fucking specific with this shit okay I'll describe it all

52:23.600 --> 52:29.840
is that okay yeah yeah okay let me turn my game volume down it's so loud right now Jesus Christ

52:29.840 --> 52:36.000
shut up okay so there's a red wire okay that's the first one and then there's a space and then

52:36.000 --> 52:41.040
there's another red wire and then there's a blue wire and then there's a white wire and then it's

52:41.040 --> 52:50.160
blank again okay okay and then at the top okay hold on do it like this say light color and then

52:50.240 --> 52:54.320
there's no stars at all right so just say the whether it has a light and then what color the

52:54.320 --> 53:02.960
wire is okay red with light red with no light blue hold on go slow down slow down okay okay red with

53:02.960 --> 53:14.320
light um okay red with light and then the next one red with no light red with no light red with no

53:14.320 --> 53:25.440
light red with no light red with no light what the fuck red with no light okay okay blue with light

53:28.160 --> 53:43.200
blue with light okay okay next one okay okay white with no light white with no light

53:44.640 --> 53:54.160
okay god it's just like fucking math class all over again aren't you good at math no i hated this type

53:54.160 --> 54:02.480
of math fucking algebra miss me with that shit okay um cut the wire if the last digit of the serial

54:02.480 --> 54:12.640
number is even do not cut the wire okay don't cut the wire that has red and light don't cut that one

54:12.640 --> 54:24.880
okay um the last digit of the serial number is eight okay so i think if it's red and blue but

54:24.880 --> 54:32.960
it's not red and blue fuck oh my god there's only 45 seconds left oh fuck i'm an idiot okay okay hold

54:32.960 --> 54:39.680
on hold on hold on hold on so so so if it's red with light uh cut the wire if the bomb has two or

54:39.760 --> 54:47.040
more batteries it has two or more batteries yes okay cut that one the red with the red light yeah

54:47.920 --> 54:57.440
okay okay okay okay what's the next one again red with no light red with no light is s um s s s

54:57.440 --> 55:04.240
cut the wire if the last digit of the serial number is even so cut yes cut that one okay okay okay

55:10.640 --> 55:14.320
cut the wire if the bomb has a parallel port what the fuck there's a parallel port

55:19.200 --> 55:25.440
oh my god i got at the last moment oh my god it made sense in my brain at the last moment okay

55:25.440 --> 55:30.000
so what i thought it was okay so there's like multiple venn diagrams crossing each other right

55:30.000 --> 55:34.160
i thought it was like math where you have to like put it like factor in all of the variables

55:34.160 --> 55:39.200
and you only look at the area that's inside of like all of the variables but variables together

55:39.200 --> 55:48.800
but that's not how that works you only look at two variables or more okay okay okay okay okay

55:48.800 --> 56:00.160
you want to switch yes we can switch okay do you want to do that level yes okay yes i want you to

56:00.960 --> 56:10.640
listen i want suffering with you i know my suffering i was there the whole time i've been suffering

56:14.480 --> 56:20.000
okay whatever you're ready i'm ready right now okay dogs let me open

56:23.040 --> 56:25.440
i'll drink with you yeah

56:26.080 --> 56:31.680
cheers

56:34.160 --> 56:38.720
that's what it is in japanese okay um i see the venn diagram one let's just start with wires

56:40.240 --> 56:45.360
it is six wires two white one yellow three yellow one blue

56:48.000 --> 56:53.440
not in that order by the way not in that order two white three yellow there's no red okay a

56:53.440 --> 56:59.200
cut the last wire cut the last wire pug okay uh the numbers the numbers on the screen the number on

56:59.200 --> 57:09.760
the screen okay what's the display four um press the button in the fourth position four that's

57:09.760 --> 57:16.320
number four okay and then four press the button in the same position as you press in stage one

57:16.320 --> 57:22.320
so fourth earth position yeah that's number one okay three um

57:24.960 --> 57:33.520
which stage are we in third um press the button in the third position that's the number four

57:35.600 --> 57:40.080
then three um press the button in the same position as you press in stage two

57:40.480 --> 57:49.760
that's the second position or the first position fuck first position fuck no okay uh

57:50.640 --> 57:55.200
no we have to start all over again okay two it's the number two press the button in the second

57:55.200 --> 58:01.920
position four okay second position two this is number two press the button in the same

58:01.920 --> 58:10.880
position as you press in stage one that's second position yeah is it okay okay yes uh one press

58:10.880 --> 58:16.880
the button the same label you pressed s is in stage two four okay that was in the second position

58:17.600 --> 58:22.080
two press the button in the first position that's the number two

58:24.560 --> 58:31.360
three press the button with the same label as you pressed in stage four so two two oh good

58:31.360 --> 58:36.000
thank you remember it okay okay all right um the last one is the one with the bend diagrams

58:36.000 --> 58:39.920
is the complex wires that you had before the one with the lights and then stuff

58:41.680 --> 58:47.840
except this time i have all of the wires oh fuck me okay so let me read it look at each wire

58:47.840 --> 58:56.320
there's an okay four and four use the vendor here below so whether or not to cut the wires each

58:56.320 --> 59:04.400
wire may be striped with multiple colors okay they're not just let you know okay okay so it's just um

59:07.120 --> 59:13.360
okay sure i think i can get it okay so do i have to find which vent diagram to use

59:14.560 --> 59:20.400
yes so i'll read you what the uh elements of the wire is and then you find that position on the

59:20.400 --> 59:26.000
vent diagram you correspond that letter to the little chart and then even easy lemon squeezy okay

59:26.000 --> 59:29.680
the first one is no light red no star none of these have stars

59:33.520 --> 59:35.760
red yes red

59:39.040 --> 59:40.080
no light red

59:46.080 --> 59:51.600
so because there's no other elements you would just do the one that's only red

59:52.240 --> 59:57.920
okay um overlaps so do i tell you now whether or not to cut it

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.560
yes okay cut the wire if the last digit of the serial number is even

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:11.200
i heard cut the wire in my fingers slipped okay it's five it's not fucking even okay the next one

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:18.320
is light red light red light light uh red oh led red

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:36.400
30 seconds i'm shall we uh same same thing same thing so i don't touch it okay um uh no light white

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:46.880
i don't think that's on there there's no there's no light oh fuck uh i died there's no white wires

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.840
yeah right so i think we just have to skip that one in that case okay i'm going to retry i'm going

01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:01.600
to press retry okay okay okay okay i think we got this i think we got this bro okay now that we

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:11.920
both experienced it fucking hell oh oh oh okay uh wires normal wires okay there are one two three four

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.880
five it's one yellow one black one blue two white

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.880
is the last wire black it's white

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.800
say it again sorry yeah no worries it's one yellow one black one blue two white

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.560
okay cut the first wire cut the first wire pog okay uh numbers the number on the screen

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:59.200
um okay what's the display three okay press the button in the third position three that's

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:07.040
number three okay um then we have one only press the button labeled four uh so the first position

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:15.200
okay number one press the button with the same label as you press in stage two brother what did i

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.720
say it was four one you didn't say anything i fuck what's it water four it was four okay pog

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:28.880
okay pog uh i can't see she oh it's four four four okay press the button in the same with uh in the

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:40.320
same position as you press in stage two um is that one oh nice okay okay three okay press the button

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:47.760
in the same label as you press this no no there's two now there's two on the screen two there's two

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.360
oh yeah sorry press the button with the same label as you press in stage two

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.720
is that one or four was that one or four was that one or four oh fuck was that one or four

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:08.320
four oh my god oh my god oh my god god bless god bless okay okay okay now i have the same that

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:15.920
you had earlier that was one two three abc abc do you remember the name of that like what that was

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:25.760
called nope okay not at all okay okay okay let me look for it i think i might have been closer to

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:34.160
the middle oh yep within this one yeah that should hurt my brain that should make no sense to my brain

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.560
okay so if you want to go to the next level you hit the down button if you want to go to the

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.640
previous level you hit the up button okay okay do not switch until you're sure that you have cut

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:55.200
all the necessary wires though okay on the current panel okay okay hi hi um wire currents are cumulative

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:04.960
all over panels within the module okay okay tell me um tell me what the wires look like

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.760
yeah i'll give it to you one by one it's one b red one b

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:30.160
so wire currents yep yep okay so don't cut it okay don't cut it the next one is two red b red two b

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:41.280
two yes the second wire is red and it's connected to cut it cut it cut it cut it nice okay third wire

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:52.000
is black connected to b cut it cut it pog okay down i'm going down okay nice nice we got a light

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.480
the next one is fifth wire is red connected to c

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.760
um don't cut it don't cut it okay next is sixth wire is black c

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.400
cut it cut it nice okay next one okay we only have 40 seconds seven black c

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.160
don't cut it don't cut it red eight c

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.720
30 seconds don't cut it don't cut it uh red nine c

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.200
don't cut it okay nice oh fuck no that was wrong what

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.520
seven black c eight red c nine red c

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:56.880
no don't cut any of them you said the seventh black connected to c yeah

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:04.240
eighth eighth red red oh i side i don't know what i did wrong what the fuck happened there

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:11.600
