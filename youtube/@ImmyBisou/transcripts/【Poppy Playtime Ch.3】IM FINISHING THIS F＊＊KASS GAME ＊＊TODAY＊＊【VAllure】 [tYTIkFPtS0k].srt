1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,840
its

2
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:56,220
Hello

3
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,980
Hello, hi, you might notice something different.

4
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,220
I have a heart monitor today in the top corner.

5
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:17,180
Yeah, hi, um, welcome, thank you for coming.

6
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,620
Um, this is gonna be our last Poppy Playtime stream.

7
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,340
I'm not gonna, um, put my pants, no.

8
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,300
Um, yeah, this is gonna be our last Poppy Playtime stream.

9
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,540
Now, I don't know if I'll finish it, um, I don't know.

10
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,940
I'll go as far as I can, but I didn't realize how hot it would be today.

11
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,100
It's like 32 degrees Celsius outside and it's probably even hotter in my

12
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,060
bedroom because my bedroom is the hottest room in the apartment.

13
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,540
It faces the sun, so the sun, you know, hits the bedroom directly

14
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,020
and gets really hot in here.

15
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,380
So, it will not be an endurance stream.

16
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:09,580
Um, it'll just be, I'm gonna play for, uh, as long as I can until I get too hot,

17
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,140
hot and give up.

18
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,340
Yeah, or I just get too frustrated and give up.

19
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,940
So, uh, yeah.

20
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,020
Um, I, it's not, your resting heart rate is crazy, it's not.

21
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,500
It's very normal, is 100 not normal? I thought 100 for resting heart rate is

22
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,820
normal.

23
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,180
Resting heart rate, between 60 and 100 is normal.

24
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,620
And look, I'm even going lower.

25
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,540
60 and 100 is normal.

26
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,380
It's on the higher end. Yeah, I know it's on the higher end.

27
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,820
I know it's on the higher end, I'm aware.

28
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,900
Um, but that's normal.

29
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,780
It was more than 100? Well, that was because I was walking around, okay?

30
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,620
I was setting up and I was walking around and, um, I'm gonna take off the,

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:23,740
pillow underneath me, because, oh, I just made my calendar fall off the wall.

32
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,580
Uh-oh.

33
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,580
Um.

34
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Alright, so now there is a pin on the floor that was pinning my calendar to the

35
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,100
wall, and I hope I don't step on it because I don't see it anywhere.

36
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,020
Alright, well, if I, if I randomly screech, you know what happened.

37
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:57,660
I stepped on a pin. Okay, um, um, what did I want to talk about?

38
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:06,540
Fucking, uh, uh, I had, hold on, let me, let me, let me, um,

39
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,940
right, I ordered a new capture card. I got an Elgato capture card.

40
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,020
Um, I got an Elgato capture card, so this

41
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,780
should work because it was expensive and it was by a trusted brand instead of

42
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,740
like a random Amazon brand. So, and the, the first capture card I got was like

43
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,500
$20, like I understand if it breaks or maybe it's not suited for the,

44
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,900
for the switch, I don't know, but this time it should work,

45
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:42,460
um, for sure, so I 100% aim to be playing, um, Mario Kart while drunk.

46
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,980
Next week, now next week, sorry, um,

47
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:59,980
next week we will be, um, um, a Guerrilla week, and the reason it'll be a Guerrilla

48
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,580
week is, so a Guerrilla week basically means every

49
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,180
stream will be unplanned. I will try to keep every stream out,

50
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,460
like I will start around the usual stream time,

51
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,660
so like, you know, I won't randomly start a stream at like

52
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:21,580
3 p.m. EDT, um, or like 11 a.m. EDT, I'll keep them all at 6 p.m. EDT,

53
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,020
whatever, whatever the usual stream time is for you, I know I'm not streaming at

54
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,820
the usual time, we're a little early, so that way, um, at least

55
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,380
it'll be like the usual time that I stream, so maybe you can make it.

56
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,500
I'm sorry that, uh,

57
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,900
I'm sorry it's Guerrilla, my cousin is coming over,

58
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,140
we're making last-minute plans to visit, you know, all these crazy places with

59
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,140
her because it's her first time here, so we want to make it fun for her,

60
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,660
of course, I realized I didn't turn my ring light on,

61
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,980
um, you know, we want to make it fun for her, so yeah, I won't be home,

62
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:04,300
I'll be, I'll be going around, um, thank you for the $5 Guerrilla week,

63
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,900
um, right, fansly, uh, I have not set up my fansly, I am currently not,

64
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm not prioritizing fansly, I haven't even set it up,

65
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,060
you're not gonna get, I think, um, some girls are doing a fansly

66
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,020
stream like tomorrow or the day after, I'm sorry I'm not planning that,

67
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:31,340
I, um, like, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna be busy very much next week, so

68
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,180
I'm sorry, I know a lot of you were excited for it, I was excited too, but

69
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,660
I, uh, I, like, I, uh, you know, I got other stuff to do,

70
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,980
I apologize, I have to spend some time with, um, you know, my,

71
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,260
my cousin and I have to, you know, I, isn't that terrible, no, that's okay,

72
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,660
um, I'm excited to meet her, well, I've met her before, but I'm excited to,

73
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,340
you know, have fun with her, sounds very fun,

74
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,460
yes, it will be fun, family obligation, it's understandable, yeah, it's family fun,

75
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,460
it's not obligations, I just do it because it's like, you know,

76
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,340
unless you're here for the first time, so let's, you're visiting,

77
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,540
you're visiting us for the first time, so let's have fun together, yeah,

78
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,700
um, so, yes, I'll tell you one way or another

79
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,700
that I'm doing it, it, I don't think it'll be on our

80
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,940
weekly schedules, I will probably have to notify you, like,

81
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,980
on our, on our, um, audio schedules, uh, that, like, I,

82
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,900
sorry, I'm, like, talking fast, I'll, I'll probably have to notify you on our

83
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,540
audio schedules, um, for, like, Patreon, where, where,

84
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,380
where I say, like, you know, this, or doing, or doing this

85
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:00,060
subject for, you know, all four audios of Patreon, and then maybe at the end,

86
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,380
I'll have, like, um, the days for fansly streams for the month,

87
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,380
um, like that, and obviously don't expect, like,

88
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,500
weekly fansly streams, yeah, um, I think

89
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,540
that's all I had to say, um,

90
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,580
I'm glad you're patient, thank you for being patient,

91
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,660
I'll try to have the thigh cupping video out for next week, so that way you

92
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,300
still have a little bit of me, you know,

93
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,380
um, if Momosa is able to get me her, um, part of the ASMR

94
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,380
video we have together, I might be able to have that out too,

95
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,620
it depends on her, but it's okay, no pressure on her, you know,

96
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:57,420
she's, she's very busy too, so like, uh, we'll see, it's not a big deal though,

97
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,100
um, that was my day, I didn't do too much in the morning,

98
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,580
we had our meeting, that was, that was, I, uh, we talked about a lot more than I

99
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,860
was expecting to talk about.

100
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,580
Is the same time of today the guerrilla stream?

101
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,700
Is that the same time of today the guerrilla stream?

102
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,180
No, they'll be at the usual streaming time, so six.

103
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,820
Six, is the, the usual streaming time, 6 p.m. EDT,

104
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,380
or, uh,

105
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,700
um,

106
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,060
fucking, I don't know the other time songs that I, that I stream in, I don't know the

107
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,100
other ones, yes, two hours from now, or one hour and

108
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,300
40 minutes from now is my usual time, uh,

109
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,020
yeah, I don't expect too many guerrillas, I'll try my best whenever I'm

110
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:02,300
home to do something, but I'm not going to be home a good chunk of it, so yeah,

111
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,860
so productive, not really, not really, truly I do nothing,

112
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,100
truly I do nothing, most of the time I'm just sitting there stressing about how

113
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,860
I should be doing something, but I'm not,

114
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,860
so truly like I don't do anything, like I say, oh I'll have the thigh cupping

115
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,900
video next week, you think I have the thigh cupping

116
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,020
video ready, I don't have it, I don't have a script for it,

117
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,420
I didn't record it, I don't even have art for it, I'm just saying that,

118
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,100
I'm just saying that in hopes that it'll pressure me to do it,

119
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,660
so yeah, like, most of the time I'm rot-maxing, I'm just feeling bad that I

120
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,460
have to leave you next week, so I'm like, okay, let me,

121
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,020
that thigh cupping video I wanted to do for so long, let me do that now,

122
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,180
so that I, you know, I have something to give you while I'm gone,

123
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,300
but yeah, uh,

124
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,980
so don't call me productive, because truly I ain't doing shit,

125
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:12,380
okay, um, let me start the game, let me open scene to start the game,

126
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,300
I don't have a controller today, I was just too lazy to plug it in

127
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,380
and I feel like we're at a, you know, we're at a intense part of the

128
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,300
game, so I don't, I'm not even gonna use the controller for a good amount of it,

129
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,260
you know, um,

130
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,060
why can't, uh, why can't I find the game?

131
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Probably play time, there it is, play, okay,

132
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,020
found from Twitter, ah, thank you for coming from Twitter,

133
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,140
thank you, thank you, Mr. Light, yes, we're meeting Mr. Light, oh, that's loud,

134
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,420
and I'm going to, um,

135
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,780
gonna turn off my music,

136
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,340
uh, turn that on, turn off discord call, because I'm not in a discord call right now,

137
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,860
um, for now on, for now I'm gonna lurk, oh, okay, thank you for lurking,

138
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,940
can she clear the, the worst part of the game? I don't know, I'm really, really worried that, um,

139
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,420
I won't be able to clear it, I really hope that, uh,

140
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,100
I really hope that I can, today's underwear color, it's just light pink again,

141
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,940
I'm really sweaty today, I really, really, even when I had the AC on,

142
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,380
I was sweating really bad, it's like, even with the AC on, what happened, what ends up happening

143
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,780
is the top part of my room, sorry, I'm looking up a tutorial on how to clear this chapter, so that way I'll

144
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,460
know how to clear it, um, what happens with the AC when it gets really hot in my room is that

145
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,620
the lower part of my room gets like, decently cool, but literally, if you like, lift your arm

146
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,700
to like, feel the top layer of air in the room, it like, there's like a drastic

147
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:21,580
temperature difference between the bottom layer of air in my room and the top layer of air in my room,

148
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,260
and that's because the AC can only cool the bottom layer, yeah, hot air rises, so like,

149
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,860
I'm like, sitting here in my desk and like, my feet are cold but my, my, my face is sweaty,

150
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:45,980
okay, Poppy, playtime, chapter three, uh, walkthrough, walkthrough, no jumpscares, that's so funny,

151
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:54,300
okay, I'm gonna skip the first one, um, no deaths, okay, thank you,

152
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,140
oh no, I don't expect them to die if they know how to play the game, you know,

153
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:11,420
get a fan going around to move air, um, should I do that? What the fuck is this ad?

154
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,620
I don't use ad blocker, I know, I'm sorry, ever since YouTube blocked ad blockers,

155
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,060
I got lazy, I don't, and I don't use them, it's not like the ads work, I don't click on them,

156
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:33,020
um, a fan should help, you're doing fine last time, you just need to find the other power

157
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:42,140
source at one part, but it's so difficult to find it, like, so difficult, I mean, will you cater to

158
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:51,500
your lesbian fans? Unfortunately, probably not, you have to, you have to deal with the F4 content,

159
00:15:52,460 --> 00:16:00,060
I'm sorry, I do have old F4A content on my other channel if you want to look at that,

160
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,380
but that's a little different, I understand if you want, if you're here for, if you're here for

161
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:15,580
Imi, then no, if you're here for any content I've made, then possibly, yeah, no F4F, um, yeah,

162
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,940
but there's a lot of good other content creators that do F4F content here, let me see if I can,

163
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:34,300
I know, I think it was, um, you can go to Eksumar, E-G-G-S-M-R, she does a lot of

164
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:42,540
good F4A content, which means female for anyone, like the, the, you know, the pronouns and stuff

165
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:53,340
used in, um, in the video or, uh, fuck, there was one more, um, oh no, I don't remember her name,

166
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:02,620
she did a fucking Amonka say it some more, I remember that one, it was funny,

167
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:22,940
FANGAR, FANGAR does really good F4F content, so there you go, there's my recommendations,

168
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:31,900
um, if you're looking for that, you're welcome, um, okay, let me look through this walkthrough here,

169
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:43,100
let me show it to you, okay, let me see,

170
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:56,700
okay, I forgot how fucking dark this game is, okay, no, give me the full, give me the full screen,

171
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:03,420
okay, did I, I died, right, so I'm gonna end up at the start, right,

172
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,180
right, thank you, sis, you're amazing, you're welcome,

173
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,780
uh-huh, let me read that, I had, I don't have a tab open even though I should,

174
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,660
let me close my other, I have so many tabs open, why do I have this program open,

175
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,660
oh so I tested it out, I received the vlog camera and I tested it out,

176
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:39,180
I am so worried about how high deaf it is, you can see everything, you can see every gross

177
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,220
disgusting wrinkle on my finger, you can see every pore, like truly you can see everything,

178
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,180
it's always great to come home to your little sister after a rough day at work, hope you're

179
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,300
doing well sis, oh thank you, thank you for the two dollars,

180
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,780
you'll start when delight triggers delight, any hands in HD, yeah truly you can see everything,

181
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:15,100
I tested it out and oh my god, you can see everything, it's, it's um, it's rough,

182
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,060
but it's really good quality which is nice, should I um,

183
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,860
man this really, this part, does this part take a long time usually,

184
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,380
wait he, he so easily passed the part that I was stuck on, what the fuck,

185
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,900
what did he do, or is this another part, oh wait I forgot to show it to you, sorry,

186
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:49,740
sounds useful for brosley streams, oh no no no no no, no it is not,

187
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,220
I will not be using the vlog camera for brosley streams,

188
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,660
is this not the part that I was stuck on, no this wasn't the part that I was stuck on was it,

189
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,700
he passed it so quickly, what the fuck,

190
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,900
oh this is it right, no is it, oh man I'm so confused,

191
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,540
no that seems after,

192
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,700
okay this is the part that I was stuck on,

193
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,500
okay so he sees that, okay, so first he goes down the hall

194
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:05,020
to this room and what the fuck, oh man I'm gonna have such a hard time finding that,

195
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:11,020

196
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,540

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:37,900
okay so there is a different one, okay, okay I'm so directionally challenged, truly I'm really

198
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:44,220
really directionally challenged, thank you for being here to lead me, um maybe you can show us

199
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:52,780
the puppy pad, that's funny, maybe, yeah maybe, I don't know if the, I don't know if the camera

200
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,660
that I got is like better than my phone camera or anything, you want to see the puppy pad in a

201
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,900
high definition, okay,

202

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,540
possible together, she spiked her heart rate from like low 90, oh oh wait you don't see my heart

205
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:37,580
here anymore, what the fuck, here it is, oh is that gonna be hard to see, should I put it up here,

206
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:56,620
okay, um, okay, I'll try to become, I'm a very anxious person, um in general,

207
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,580
first time, no I've been anxious lots of times, or no, how does it go first time?

208
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:15,820
Are you anxious, yeah, first time, no I've been anxious lots of times, or was it nervous, nervous,

209
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,340
yeah, first time, no, I've been, I've been nervous lots of times, okay, grab that,

210
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:30,140
yes, nice airplane reference, I never even watched that movie, but yes, I know it's a,

211
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,420
oh fuck how am I supposed to open this door,

212
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:48,460
all right, oh what the fuck, what the fuck, okay but she goes through doors, right,

213
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,420
um,

214
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,380
you should watch it, I don't know, will I understand the the humor in it, I have a lot of time,

215
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:10,620
sometimes this is embarrassing, but sometimes I have a hard time understanding the humor in older

216
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:17,820
movies because, oh no I backed myself into a corner, because like I just don't,

217
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,060
I just don't like recognize like, like if they take a jab at a celebrity or something,

218
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,420
they're like ah ha ha ha, fucking, I don't know, joke about this celebrity or something,

219
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:39,260
I won't understand it because like, you know, I uh, fuck what do I do here, excuse me,

220
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:51,020
oh, cute, in me heart, yeah, in me heart, I think it's age, been a while since I last saw it,

221
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,420
she spawns in as you go further along the hallway,

222
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
huh,

223
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:11,500
do I open this door, how do I get this door open without her attacking me,

224
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,740
she moves like a weeping angel, yes I remember that, thank you for the two dollars, thank you,

225
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,780
thank you, when I watched Deadpool we're over in because I wasn't into the lore, but the movie

226
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:32,940
was still super funny, yeah I wanted to watch that, but um, I couldn't find a, what do I do,

227
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,060
if I turn around she's gonna attack me, should I try to lead her like,

228
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,580
I didn't know if I got too close to her she would attack me,

229
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:57,660
I didn't know if I got too close to her she would attack me, follow the hallway in me,

230
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,100
don't go in any rooms with the battery, oh okay, okay thank you for the tip,

231
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:11,500
I'm so lucky that you're here to help, truly I would be so lost in this game, if you weren't here,

232
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:17,100
okay, the volume is not too loud is it, I want to make sure,

233
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,420
okay,

234
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:35,580
I keep forgetting that I need to open the door, did it open, yes, okay follow the hallway,

235
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,900
wait wasn't there something here,

236
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,700
wait, oh wait, oh no no no no,

237
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:57,500
this way right, okay, thank you, that looks right, okay put that, oh there we go,

238
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,500
there we go,

239
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,460
um,

240
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,980
I just want to walk backwards because I'm scared all the time,

241
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,340
I'm scared, I'm spooked,

242
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,220
keep following the hallway to the next door now,

243
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,780
hi Emirates, hi, how was your voice so majestic, what do you mean,

244
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,500
ah, I attached new stickers, I have a bunch of stickers on my desk drawers because I think

245
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:48,140
they look cute, but now do I go to this door, no, no, do I go to that door, I need to sneeze,

246
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:04,940
I don't feel, oh, I guess I can keep going this, yes, okay, I need to sneeze again,

247
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,980
hold on, I think I'm okay, thank you for the blessings,

248
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,660
okay, thank you,

249
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,260
um,

250
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:30,780
do I do anything with this,

251
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,140
wait a minute,

252
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,420
wait no no I'm lost, I went the other way,

253
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,820
follow the hallway again to open the door, it's not this direction is it,

254
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:06,860
I'm so directionally challenged, I used to have this when I was younger, I made my first mod in

255
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,060
Minecraft world and I was so proud of it because I had all these cool mods in it and I built such a

256
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:21,260
cool, I built such a cool fucking, oh, I have to open this door with the thing in the room,

257
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:30,380
right, I built such a cool house with my, with my, with all the mods and stuff, stop,

258
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:38,060
leave me alone, how am I supposed to get past you, is she gonna attack me, okay, come on,

259
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,060
how am I supposed to get past,

260
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,940
I'm never gonna pass this fucking part, I'm gonna cry,

261
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:03,420
I made a really nice Minecraft world with all the mods that I had downloaded,

262
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:11,900
I'm gonna open this door first, okay, and I went on my first ever like expedition

263
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:24,460
after making the Minecraft world and I immediately got lost and um,

264
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,780
I couldn't find my house anymore and I had to delete the world

265
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:37,180
because I was literally just lost, what do I do with this again, oh the hallway,

266
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,020
Amy tears, whoa, Amy tears,

267
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,500
come on,

268
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,540
okay,

269
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,620
I really do have goldfish memory, it's a problem,

270
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:09,500
I tried my best though, okay, so in this room, right, is the,

271
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:17,900
that's where the, the thing is for that, right, okay, so I need to go in this room,

272
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,420
that's why I always save a screenshot of the coordinates, I didn't know how to use coordinates,

273
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:33,980
I still very, I still very badly know how to use coordinates, like my coordinate

274
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:40,220
knowledge is like, here let me get you a little closer here, okay, okay,

275
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,860
oh come on, am I gonna be able to make this, how did I do it last time,

276
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,260
oh please don't attack me just because I got close to you, this is the furthest I can be,

277
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,220
please don't attack me, I'm scared to get close,

278
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,500
okay,

279
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:19,820
you can grab it from outside the hallway, through the window or what, can I grab it through the window,

280
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:26,220
oh, I don't understand, through the door,

281
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,220
oh,

282
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,020
grabbing it as you're leaving, okay,

283
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:49,100
oh, thank you,

284
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,900
okay, and then the door behind me should open, right, okay, there we go, thank you, thank you,

285
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:07,980
thank you, you're so helpful, thank you, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be able to figure that out myself,

286
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:17,740
okay, now this hallway ends, so I'm gonna go through here, I'm drinking,

287
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,100
okay,

288
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:33,660
no, is that the double door, this isn't the double door situation is it,

289
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:46,300
is it, this is the double doors, I'm not going backwards, am I,

290
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:57,820
oh shit, no, no this is something else, wait, what, did I just go in a circle, wait,

291
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,860
Amy would it help if you just jump doing the puzzle and just check the map first to see where

292
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,020
you have to go and then do the puzzle, is there a map in this game,

293
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,500
if there's a map in this game I feel like it would be cheating,

294
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,180
the map, you can open the door with the power, oh the power,

295
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:34,380
okay, hold on, it's right in front of you, this door,

296
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,020
oh she's gonna attack me, no, okay, she didn't, okay,

297
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,140
I feel like Loki, I'm going in a circle, okay here's the double, okay,

298
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,100
okay, okay, okay, okay, here's the double door situation right, I remember that whole, no,

299
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,380
no maybe not, maybe I'm going a little crazy,

300
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,500
what's down here,

301
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,820
double door is after the door in front of you, okay,

302
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:22,540
okay, okay, here it is, okay, here it is, no, no this is another door,

303
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,020
how far away did I get so fast,

304
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,620
um, we all remember that whole,

305
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:50,140
so wait, there's nothing here right, no, you have to grab the power from the door you just

306
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,340
opened to open this next one, so the one over there, I have to grab power from the one I just opened,

307
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,620
okay, we'll try to remain calm,

308
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:07,420
um,

309
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,860
isn't it kind of far though, I feel like it's very, very far,

310
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,420
I have to grab power from this door to the next one,

311
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,380
you're close to the end, weren't you, I have no clue, you're doing very well, thank you,

312
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,300
I feel like I'm too stupid to play this game,

313
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,940
it is,

314
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,940

315
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,780

okay, here's the double doors, or the, yeah the double, okay, okay, now we're back to how,

320
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,500
we made it back to where I got stuck, okay, let me just locate them first, so I know one of them

321
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,380
is in this room, right, I want, I want to locate them first, so that I, oh fuck where is she coming

322
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,420
from, okay there she is,

323
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,820
one of them is definitely in this room, correct, yes, okay there it is, let me locate the next one

324
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:46,940
now, let me locate the next one, come through the, come through, okay, okay, it's the hardest deck

325
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:53,260
builder I've ever played and I'm not good at deck builders, Poppy playtime, is the hardest deck

326
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,380
builder you've ever played,

327
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,980
you can't hear the game,

328
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,340
okay, so he went, let me just make sure where he went,

329
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,340
where did he go, let me look at the tutorial again,

330
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:31,740
okay, so he, there's the door, so he went down the hall right in front of the doors,

331
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,700
and then he went in the classroom on the right,

332
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,820
and then he went through another, a hole after the classroom on the right,

333
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:49,660
got, got the, the thing, and then fucking, uh, what,

334
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,980
what,

335
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:13,980
I'm too directionally challenged for this, okay, it was down, okay, it looks like it's down this way,

336
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:28,380
is it in here, oh come on bitch, oh fuck, where is she,

337
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,260
okay, there she is, is it in this room,

338
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,300
yes, okay, um,

339
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:48,380
let me get her a little, a little poster so that I can go around her,

340
00:39:50,620 --> 00:40:06,940
okay, no, it's not in this room, what, is it through this hole,

341
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,900
okay, no, I just went out of that room, is it in this room,

342
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:26,140
it's in this room, okay, okay, I don't know if I can get it first try,

343
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,620
but I'll give it a shot, or maybe, hold on, let me wait until I'm closer to the door,

344
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,980
we're gonna big brain this, I'm gonna wait until it runs out and I'm closer to the door,

345
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:47,580
come on run out, run out, oh my god, I thought she went back into the hallway, it scared me, okay,

346
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:55,260
what, it ran out, oh no, it didn't run out, it didn't run out, it didn't run out,

347
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:12,060
get it, get it you dumb bitch, oh, we did it, we did it, I'm so happy right now, oh my god,

348
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,380
okay, no, I'm checking, I can't, I can't pass this moment up, I'm checking what the tutorial

349
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:27,580
is doing after this, I can't, I need to get past this part, I can't, okay, he goes under the door,

350
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:43,500
then what, the stickers on my desk keep coming, okay, he finds, okay, it's behind him,

351
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,420
he finds the power battery thing, puts it in the door on the left of him,

352
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,740
or I guess on the right depending on which way you're facing, okay, okay, okay, I'll do that,

353
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:02,700
I'll do that, I know it's probably sucky to, okay, so it was behind him here, there it is,

354
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:14,780
give it to me, and he puts it in this door, oh you fucking hoe, okay, okay, okay, okay,

355
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:24,140
I need to get past Mr. Light, okay, after he does that, what does he do then,

356
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,700
he goes and opens the door, oh wait, what,

357
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:43,020
okay, well he moves the thing away from the door, finds the other power source thing in the room,

358
00:42:43,020 --> 00:43:11,100
okay, and puts it in the next door on the other side, and then grabs the one from the previous door,

359
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,820
and then what, dude, no, do you not know what you're doing,

360
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,660
oh he's trying to just get her into a corner, okay,

361
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,380
are you gonna put it in the door, you're urging me right now, okay, okay, I can do that,

362
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:37,740

364
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,700

366
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:29,740
put it in, put it in,

367
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:45,260
okay, okay, then what, then what, then what, after he goes to the door, you have

368
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,860
here back seating the walkthrough, dude, I just don't like it when they're not like direct with

369
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:57,180
what they need to do, like be direct about what you're doing right now, you know, don't play games

370
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:10,940
in this game, it's not a game, opens the door in that room, grabs the power source,

371
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:25,660
so he grabs the, one of the thingies from the room, puts it in,

372
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:37,340
grabs another thing, and grabs the other battery from the same door, here let me show you the

373
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,340
the thing, that way um,

374
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:51,420
not left on it, there, now you can see what he's doing too,

375
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,180
I kind of forgot to be honest, what did he just do,

376
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:07,500
so he's going to the, he just moved the two power supplies from that room to the next one,

00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:29,020
Lights and painted skies hell. We're not even allowed to talk. It's not my father isn't that

459
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:35,300
Why do you want to talk to the kids? Why do you want to talk to the kids?

460
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,660
Trying to stop being so pissed off all the time

461
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,680
My wife says I'm a lovely man, but I gotta control my temper

462
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,460
Rich

463
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,740
But I always like that about you. Yeah

464
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,540
How do I reach these kids

465
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,620
You know Richie

466
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,020
With my retirement coming up you have to park or a bit in the next section

467
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:22,580
That's pushing hard for me to choose my replacement. I'm actually thinking about giving the role to you

468
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,260
Really? Yeah, really

469
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:32,620
Nothing official yet, but sorry. I'm messing with my face. That's one of my models

470
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:40,140
Bucking up an honest hard-working man, but he wanted to did all the kids. Why would you give it to him?

471
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
Let's say your chances are pretty good

472
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,820
Wow

473
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,900
Don't know what to say

474
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:55,300
I'm just glad to see not everyone in this place has it out for me. I'm not picking my nose. No

475
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,060
It's cat naps Paul. Why? Why am I just seeing his paw?

476
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:09,860
Did they not did they not have a stock image a stock photo did they not have enough budget for actors for that part?

477
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:27,420
Am I supposed to jump through here wait? Oh, no

478
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,940
Okay, so here's where I didn't know what to do

479
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:48,660
Here's where I wasn't sure where to go look down

480
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,660
Wait, oh

485
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,300
Okay, oh

486
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,780
Okay, this parkour isn't so bad when you got a jump boost

487
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:36,580
Are you sure I was right there

488
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,540
Don't tell me I have to go all the way back down. Oh my god. I didn't know there was a timer

489
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,060
Okay

490
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
Go

491
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:01,740
Ah

492
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:21,460
Okay, did I make it in time it was easy it was okay. It was okay. I am locked in

493
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,900
Do I need to go fuck down there? Oh

494
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,700
It's saving oh

495
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,380
Wait, it was Q and R

496
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:55,260
Mmm, that doesn't look right probably there

497
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,820
Can I just press two? Oh, I can okay

498
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:05,220
That was close, okay, and then this one is

499
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,780
Probably gonna go there

500
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:20,460
And then this one gonna go here

501
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,260
I

502
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:44,140
Feel like I'm getting it. Oh, I'm not getting it

503
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,940
Okay, I'm getting it now

504
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,700
Now the only thing is I don't know what happens after this

505
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:03,300
Did it work? No, wait, let's try let's try this again. Hold on hold on hold on

506
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,940
Over here there we go

507
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,380

01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,940
Okay, well, let's go see if that did anything

511
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:59,420
Go up the last one isn't aiming towards this one. Oh

512
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,540
This one is supposed to aim towards this

513
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,700
There we go. Okay. Now I get it now. I get it now. I get it I

514
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,940
Understand I aimed it towards that one even though this is what shoots that okay

Okay

519
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:42,820
Like if I took an IQ test before and after this game, I feel like my IQ would be higher

520
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,380
Wait what

01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:53,820
Hello, oops, that's a bad idea

670
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,900
There we go

671
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:06,700
Okay, oh, this is just like chapter one where he chased us through the vents

672
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:13,220
Okay, I'm guessing I can't shoot him right

673
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:25,940
Oh, oh, oh, no, do I have to shoot the little guys too? It skipped most of his lines yet

674
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:36,860
Isn't he wonderful who's the prototype is the thing chasing me the prototype

675
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:43,220
But wait, I got attacked by something did I go down the wrong path?

676
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:56,500
Straight left and right, okay, okay, I'll try doing that

677
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Straight left and then right

678
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:18,660
Okay, that wasn't too bad do not take wrong turns cuz he spawns okay

679
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:26,540
Is it cuz I took a wrong turn that he spawned straight straight straight left and right straight left right straight left right

680
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,540
straight left right, okay

681
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,420
Straight left right. I'm ready

682
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:34,780
Yeah

683
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,420
Are you gay

684
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:44,620
Right right right right right

685
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,540
He's scared

686
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,420
Left

687
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,260
Sorry that's me

688
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:13,420
I

689
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:23,420
Do get a little toxic with games, I'm sorry

690
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:33,900
That's why I don't play league because I would probably tell people to kiss their sister if I play league I

691
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:40,120
Used to do that in bed wars. I would get really toxic with bed wars

692
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,900
That's the only kind of competitive game that I used to play

693
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:49,380
It's left not left right. It's right left

694
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:56,220
Okay, you know what I think I will just not go that direction next time and then we'll figure it out from there. I

695
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,580
Would get toxic with bed wars

696
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,740
I would

697
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,460
Go go

698
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:16,660
Okay

699
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,660
Okay, so just keep going straight after that

700
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,660
I

701
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,340
Might not remember

702
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,740
Okay, here it is keep going straight

703
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:41,660
Oh my god

704
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,220
You want to see me play bed wars I

705
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:01,860
Get toxic in bed wars. I'm not even that good at it either

706
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,740
I'm not even that good at it

707
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,820
I miss the door

708
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:14,820
I

709
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,180
The guy said straight left right was right

710
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:29,340
Was he I don't know

711
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,980
He looks different when he gets evil when he you know

712
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,820
Yeah

713
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,380
Okay, let's see if we can do this

714
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:01,100
You got this and me you got this don't get stuck

715
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:11,700
Like I feel like if I make one tiny wrong move like that if I get stuck a little bit I'm scared. I'm gonna die

716
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,820
You know

717
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:27,180
Oh, come on, I swear to God if this is it, okay

718
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,500
Shh, I don't know which to okay

719
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,180
Okay

720
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:42,460
Was that just a luck thing

721
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,940
Was I just supposed to not take that one

722
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:04,740
Like how was I supposed to know when I return left don't go through any of the tubes. Oh

723
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,460
Oh

724
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:11,020
Okay

725
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:23,020
I was almost done to just turn left there, okay, okay, thank you

726
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,020
Hello

727
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:35,500
It's just a luck thing it's your first time it is my first time

728
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:51,880
Okay, okay, I'm just trying to stay calm at this point

729
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:59,180
I'm surprised my heart rate is surprisingly low for how stressed I am

730
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:02,780
Straight here

731
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,580
Shit did I go the right way

732
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,100
Okay, so after this room I go left

733
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,140
Or in this room you just go left

734
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:26,740
Shit shit

735
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:42,100
Did I do it or am I still in danger?

736
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:51,260
Oh man, oh man, that's scaring me you did it

737
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:55,260
I

738
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,780
Should I go down here

739
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:09,100
Is this a save screen is a saving for me

740
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:15,660
No, oh many out cheese

741
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,460
I'm really glad you're okay. I'm not

742
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,260
It just saved okay

743
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:29,020
Oh

744
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,700
See before

745
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:39,820
He almost died but

746
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:43,100
But they say that the prototype saved his life

747
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,660
living up his own freedom in the process

748
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:52,820
The prototype is a superhero and has saved this place

749
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:58,020
So Katnack treats him like a god killing everyone that opposes him

750
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:04,660
Us included if we're not careful. What is the prototype is that the thing that scare you? No

751
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:09,420
You thought that was terrifying. Just wait until you see the real thing

752
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:13,220
Anyways, we're really close to the end

753
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:22,500
You're going to the counsellor's office instead. It's not ideal, but it should have enough juice

754
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:26,540
If you can get that generator going and plug it in

755
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:31,540
I think we'll be done and keep your eyes open for Katnack

756
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,180
Every shadow

757
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:39,820
It means only when we're building the banners is there still good amount of game left

758
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:58,980
Thank you Oley, okay, I think what I'll do

759
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,660
I

760
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,380
Think what let me turn that off

761
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:15,780
That's not the right thing this way guys, okay

762
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:20,340
It's way too hot right now to finish the game

763
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,860
I

764
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:25,860
Think what I'll do

765
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:29,420
What did I have planned for today hold on I have a planner

766
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:34,420
Yeah, I'm a real adult and I have a planner for on one of the pages of my planner just fell out

767
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,600
Okay

768
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,700
So I think what I'll do is I'll end here because I I'm not over just

769
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:46,860
Stop trying to get me naked. I know what you're fucking doing. Yeah, I have a planner

770
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:49,780
I I've been trying to get organized and

771
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:55,780
Plan content because I really want to post more like ASMR and stuff

772
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,260
So, yeah, um

773
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:10,700
Yeah, I'm a big girl so um what I'm going to do

774
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:17,460
Is I'm gonna end here because I did want I did have to record a little bit

775
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:24,380
I'm gonna record the thigh cupping. Yeah, that's what I'll do and

776
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:29,940
That way you can have it

777
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:32,340
Yeah, I I did

778
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:37,020
What I what I'm able to do is like when I plan stuff and write it down

779
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:40,240
I'm able to get like a good amount of what I want finished in a week

780
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:44,380
But the problem is as I'm not able to do anything else

781
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:52,540
Like it's like I can get what I want done, but then I can't do anything else. So I still have to work on like

782
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:56,580
Routines in my day. I still struggle with that

783
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:02,940
But um, I think I'm getting somewhere. I think I'm getting somewhere slowly

784
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,620
Maybe yeah, you'll get my thighs

785
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,620
You hear that I

786
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,620
Don't know what people like in thigh cupping

787
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,460
I think I'll have to watch strong is that cupping and see how she did it

788
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:17,100
Do I just put the 3d on my thighs into my thighs and go?

789
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:21,700
Like do I oil my thighs up or something to get them wet like how does it work?

790
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:27,500
Same in some ways. I just list whatever I'm after and then put numbers on which ones I got to get done sooner

791
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,540
Which ones I already got progress with oh, I should I should do that too

792
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:37,700
Executive function isn't easy bb steps. I'm trying to get there

793
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,940
Please crash the 3d

794
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:49,100
I'll try I don't I don't see I don't know how here. Let me hear how strawny does hers

795
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:51,820
Like is it literally just shwerp shwerp shwerp with your thighs?

796
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,340
Let me hear her

797
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:03,060
She talks to

798
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,700
Oh

799
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:20,980
It feels like I'm in her belly this was this sounds like the okay. I she talks to I thought I was okay

800
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,060
Okay, I think I have a good idea of what to do. Okay

801
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,380
It's like using hands with thighs

802
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:35,820
Maybe I'll do some slapping too actually wait will you two think that's like clapping if I slap my thighs?

803
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:43,420
