00:00.000 --> 00:17.140
Psst, yo. Yeah, you dumbass. You got $100 on ya? Um, cuz I need it. I can do something

00:17.140 --> 00:30.820
in return, mister. I'm a good girl. I can, like, offer my services. What kind? Eh, good

00:30.820 --> 00:41.500
question. Let me think. Well, we're in this dark and dingy alleyway, in a scrupulous part

00:41.500 --> 00:50.380
of town, so the only logical thing that I can do in return for an exchange of money is...

00:50.380 --> 01:01.380
ASMR, of course. Duh. Well, come on. If you've got the cash, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

01:01.380 --> 01:07.180
I mean, who else is gonna offer you it? Are you telling me there's cute and funny girls

01:07.180 --> 01:14.420
throwing themselves at you to tingle you? Exactly. So hurry up and hand it over already.

01:14.420 --> 01:27.980
I love people who make it easy. Thanks. Um, alright. Let's see what I have on me that I can use to

01:27.980 --> 01:39.980
make you tingle. Hmm. Oh, this'll do. It's my little plastic tube. You know that whole thing

01:39.980 --> 01:47.060
where girls like cute small things? It's true. Like stationery, for example. The smaller the

01:47.060 --> 01:53.100
cuter, and thus the better. That's why I have this little plastic paper clip holder.

01:57.980 --> 02:25.620
Okay. Now ain't over. You're too tall for me to do this one.

03:27.980 --> 03:46.620
Alright, so if each tingle is worth $5, then I only need to do this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 more times.

03:46.620 --> 03:55.220
Oh, what? I don't even have enough things with me to do that. I'm gonna have to get really creative

03:55.220 --> 04:05.020
with this. Oh, there's a glass bottle in the ground. What? Don't give me that look. It's

04:05.020 --> 04:14.060
good to be resourceful. You know that, right? See? I can make do with this ear to ear. You

04:14.060 --> 04:39.060
can't tell me that's not tingle ready with a straight face.

04:39.060 --> 04:59.340
I could bite joke you? What? It's a tingle. I swear it is. Do you not want YouTube videos

04:59.340 --> 05:07.900
or something? Goth roleplays are pretty popular at the moment. It's your $100. If you don't

05:07.900 --> 05:14.900
want it, then fine. I'll think of something else. Ha, got ya.

05:37.900 --> 05:59.900
Some cotton balls came out of my voodoo doll recently. I can repurpose it for now.

06:59.900 --> 07:06.900
And if you enjoyed that sound, I can also do this too.

07:30.900 --> 07:38.900
Then there's the super basic stuff like finger flittering. It's a bit boring, but I can mix

07:38.900 --> 07:41.900
in some ear tapping too.

07:59.900 --> 08:27.900
Oh, you have a request? And what would that be, mister? Of course I can run my fingers

08:27.900 --> 08:35.900
through your hair. You made me nervous thinking it was something a little more explicit that

08:57.900 --> 09:25.900
I do have tissues. I could try this. Have you been keeping count, by the way? I was starting

09:25.900 --> 09:32.900
to lose track of how long I've been doing this for.

09:55.900 --> 10:15.900
Maybe you like the sound of scratching? Yeah, like that. What do you think? It's good, right?

10:55.900 --> 11:18.900
I suppose I can take my pins out to brush through your hair as well, but only because

11:18.900 --> 11:23.900
you didn't make a fuss when handing over the money. You'd be surprised how many people

11:23.900 --> 11:26.900
only want to pay me after the service.

12:23.900 --> 12:31.900
Um, not to alarm you or anything, but you're starting to slouch over now. I think you're

12:31.900 --> 12:41.900
passing out. You want more? Are you sure you can even handle more, though? I have a few

12:41.900 --> 12:48.900
more things I could do then, but I'm going to need to get going soon.

13:11.900 --> 13:34.900
This is the last one, sadly, but I'm really thankful for your business. You never know.

13:34.900 --> 13:38.900
If you walk through here again, we could do this, and I'll actually be more prepared next

13:38.900 --> 13:45.900
time, but I'll be quiet while you enjoy this last one.

14:08.900 --> 14:37.900
I have to get going now, but thanks again for your patronage. Maybe I'll see you again

14:37.900 --> 14:47.900
next time. Good night, mister.
