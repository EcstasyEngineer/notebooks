00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,060

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,060

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,120
you

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

7
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh wait. Oh shit, my model turned off! Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. That wasn't supposed to happen. You're muted on my stream, too. Hold on, hold on.

8
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Uh, application audio capture, discord call. Okay, say something?

9
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Stop party people. Okay. Hi. Hello. Okay. Hi. Let me connect my model again. Oh shit, my phone. Okay.

10
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hello. Apologies for the scoff. It was working before stream. It was. We even started early just in case, or we hopped on call early. Yeah.

11
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hey, well. Oh, I just realized audio is bad. Okay, let me turn that down a little bit. Is audio okay on my side? Your audio's fine. Yeah, is my audio okay?

12
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is the background music to voice ratio to Emmy ratio okay? Yeah, is it okay? Audio's fine? Come on, chat on my side. You gotta step it up. You gotta step it up.

13
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We should tell them. Okay, we're both streaming on YouTube. So if you want to see the other person's perspective, because this is a two person perspective game, then you should go to the other person's stream too.

14
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Um, I think I have you in the, in my, um, description. In my title, I should. Oh, yeah, yeah, me too, me too. So guys, yeah, click on that. Oh, like, go check out the other person too. Yes. Yeah, you're in my, why is my bottle lagging? Oh, yeah. Okay, okay.

15
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, thanks guys. Thanks for stepping up. Okay. Yeah, like you said, this is a tool, tool perspective thing. So I also have Emmy socials in the description of my stream, but you can also click the little at thing in the title, whatever you want.

16
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Open it on two screens. Do will this shit. If you don't have two screens, open one on your phone and one on your computer, unless you broke, which I'm sorry.

17
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, open them both up and watch them both. Okay. Okay. Are we ready to, oh wait, wait, wait, one more, one more announcement. The stream will only be one hour long because I'm going through a heat wave and I'm fucking hot in here. Yeah.

18
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah. Yes. Send some ice cream funds to me, please.

19
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't do that. AC funds, let's go. We need to upgrade her to a new apartment, guys. We gotta step up.

20
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No, it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Okay. Let's, let's, let's do this. Okay.

21
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay. Do you want to diffuse first or do you want to give instructions first?

22
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll give instructions first.

23
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

24
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right. Okay. So Emmy and I did play a little bit of this upstream so you can see a little bit of check marks and everything. We kind of skip to point two and point three because we were like, easy money.

25
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is easy. So let's start at 3.1. Let's not even do the other two because we beat the last one in the level of self. Okay. Okay. Okay.

26
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is five minutes, three minutes, three seconds. I'm so excited.

27
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, why is my model frozen? Oh, okay. I think my Wi-Fi is being a little shitty. So, Mubby, if the shit is wrong. Okay.

28
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay. So we have, let's start with Simon Says because we did Simon Says before.

29
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Simon Says. Yes. Okay. Got it.

30
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay. Okay. Yellow blink. It's blinking yellow. One time.

31
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We've never done Simon Says. We've never done Simon Says. No, we've never done Simon Says.

32
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay. Okay. Wires. Wires. Wires.

33
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I have, are you there at Wires? Yes. Wires. Okay. Okay. So I have white, blue, white, and that's the only three I have. So there's three.

34
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay. Cut the second wire. Boom. Noise. Okay. Simon Says.

35
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Blinking yellow. Are you control f-ing? Yes. That's exactly what you did. Yeah, that is the smart way to do it.

36
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
One of the four colored buttons will flash using the correct table below. Press the button with the corresponding color. The original button will flash.

37
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay. Sorry. I shouldn't read it. I don't get it.

38
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So, so. Oh, fuck. I can't remember what it looks like now. Um, if it's blink, I think it's corresponded to the thing. I don't know. You can figure it out.

39
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay. Well, the right button. You said it flash yellow. Yes. Yes. Well, for me, the yellow one is the right, the button on the right.

40
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes. So it, oh shit. Fuck. Fuck. I'm wrong. Press the button with the corresponding color.

41
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah. So if I have yellow, then that means it's something on your side.

42
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Green. Green. Fuck. Oh, it's a yellow and then green. Oh, no. Okay. Um, that's two strikes.

43
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:11,000
One more. Okay. Blue. Blue. Fuck. We did. Oh, I don't get it. Oh, wait. It's the serial. Oh, we were supposed to look at the serial number two.

44
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. It's okay. We can retry. We can retry. That was just a practice run. We were just practicing warm up. Yeah, that was just a warm up.

45
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay. Um, oh shit. I don't have Simon Says anymore. Okay. I have the button, the button. We've done that one before. It's a white button. This is whole.

46
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Um, hold the button. Okay. Hold the button. Okay. There's a red strip.

47
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Um, release when the countdown timer has a one in any position. Boom, baby. Okay. Okay. This is the word one. This is the one that looks like a calculator.

48
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Remember that one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the word on the screen is you are spelled Y O U space A R E.

49
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Y O U. Uh, bottom right. Bottom right. Nope. Nope. Okay. Now it is the word you are.

50
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Remember, you have to look at step two as well.

51
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, wait, you like you and are you the letters you and are. Yes.

52
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay. Um, top.

53
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

54
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Sure.

55
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay. Okay. Now, now it's the word first.

56
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's the word first. And then let me know.

57
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, I think you have to ask me what like so so if it's the word first, then I have to tell you what what word it is in that eyeball location.

58
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. So what's the eyeball location? Top right. Top right is the word. Uh, so a U H H H. So now you have to go to step two.

59
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Uh, ready? Nothing left. What? Okay. Yes. Right. No. Okay. Nice. Nice. Okay. Okay. We're getting it.

60
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We're getting it. Now it's the word C C E E.

61
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Um, okay. Bottom, bottom, bottom right.

62
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Bottom right is the word nothing.

63
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay. Uh, U H H H. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Okay. Next. Read R E A D.

64
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Uh, middle, middle right.

65
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Middle right is the word wait.

66
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Uh, U H H H. No blank.

67
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay. Nice. Noice. Noice. Noice. Okay. We just have one more. Fuck. I don't know what this thing's called either. It's like there's five. Fuck. Shut up snooze. Okay. Shut up. Okay. Okay.

68
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So there's a five letters and then up arrow down arrow per letter. I think we're supposed to spell a word or something.

69
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Five letters.

70
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, one, two, three, four, five. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I found it. Passwords. Okay. Cool. Okay. The button above and below each letter.

71
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We're so I can do the possible only one time.

72
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, that's a lot of you, but we have 40 seconds.

73
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Only one combination of the available letters.

74
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is there a word?

75
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Uh, U G M U B is what I see right now.

76
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh.

77
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Can you press up or down and see what it says?

78
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah. Um, so, so the first column is the letters D T G Q U column.

79
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So, so, you know how there's like four, there's five letters, right? So when I cycle through the first, oh shit, I'm dead. Okay.

80
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Damn it.

81
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's okay. It's okay. We had that puzzle on the other one as well. So let's let's try to do that one first.

82
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Then okay, I'm going to retry one more time. If you can't get this one, you want to switch perspectives? Yes. Yes.

83
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Stupid rain downstream. I feel like we're doing 10 times worse.

84
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's okay. It's okay. It's the heat. It's melting your brain. Okay. Let's do passwords first. Um, so, okay. So there's five letters, right?

85
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And the up arrows, I can cycle through each one of the letters. So the first letter in the five letter sequence has such and such letters.

86
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Does that make sense? Okay. Do you want me to tell you what the letters are?

87
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Or okay. So the first, the first letter in the sequence is J N D G Y T. Those are the first sequence of letters.

88
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay. And then you might need a pen and paper.

89
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know. Um, so the next sequence is Y H A D J B. Okay.

90
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then the third sequence, because I think you're supposed to make a word out of like all of the letters.

91
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So you're going to have to be super big brain for this. Okay. Three is J A Z F R C.

92
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay. And then let me know if I'm going too fast. And then four is C K W R E I. Okay.

93
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And then the last sequence is L E M A I O.

94
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay. You're like confident.

95
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm going to tell you to spell a random word and I don't think it's going to work. Can you spell the word?

96
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Spell which? W H I C H.

97
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You cannot spell that word, girl. You can't. You can't have the letters.

98
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay. So the first, okay. Maybe the first sequence of letters will be able to help you determine which word it is.

99
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, say it again. Say it again. I think I understand that. Say it again.

100
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay. Cool. So it's J N D G Y T.

101
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

102
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What's the next one? What's the next one? I get it. I understand now.

103
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay. Okay. D J B Y H A.

104
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay. Okay. What's the next one?

105
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay. J A Z F R C.

106
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay. Spell three.

107
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Three. Three. Three. Three.

108
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh my God. You're so smart.

109
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay. What's the next one?

110
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Simon says. Simon says.

111
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You got this. You got this.

112
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I didn't understand this one either. One of the four color buttons will flash using the correct table.

113
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We'll press the button with the corresponding color.

114
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay. Which one is flashing?

115
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Blue.

116
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay. Does the zero number contain a vowel?

117
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Uh, er, er, yes.

118
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay. Um, press the red one.

119
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Red. Oh! Oh!

120
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay. Okay. Now it's blue, red. Blue, red.

121
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Blue, red.

122
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What do I do now?

123
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What do I do now? Blue, red?

124
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay. Blue, red.

125
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Um, try red?

126
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Red and then...

127
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Red and then...

128
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then, and then what?

129
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Red, red? No, that's wrong!

130
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Wait, I didn't understand this one either!

131
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So, so, so the sequence on my side is...

132
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, you got the first one, so you're one step closer.

133
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So the sequence on my side is blue, red.

134
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay. Blue, red. Okay. So try...

135
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Try red and then blue?

136
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Red. Oh!

137
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I accidentally hit something.

138
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I accidentally hit green and it didn't give me a fucking thing.

139
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on.

140
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Red. Oh, it's not red anymore!

141
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's not red anymore!

142
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I think, I think after we get one strike,

143
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it might affect the side of the screen.

144
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

145
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Green, yellow.

146
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay. I have two strikes now. I have two strikes now.

147
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000

00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,280
can you change the frequency that's what you're supposed to do right I can't yes

326
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:30,480
okay and I submit it okay try putting at 3.535 that's just a guess 3 5 3 5 nope and we have

327
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:42,320
55 seconds left okay 3 5 3 5 5 2 3 5 5 2 5 5 fuck what happened yeah I die damn it I was just

328
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,160
guessing I'm sorry that's my fault it's new it's a difficult actually you shouldn't tell me but

329
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:57,440
it's just like so the morse code is saying a word and you're supposed to tell me like all of the

330
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,000
morse code and I'm supposed to put like like each each code is for like one letter and I have to put

331
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,920
the letters together together to make a word and then oh shit and then when I find the word I have

332
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,200
to tell you which frequency to make it I think god damn that's difficult I mean that's the

333
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,400
point of the game right that's true okay okay let's try over to that let's let's go again okay okay

412
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:17,680
oh oh it's the first wire what's the color the first wire red red red okay cut if connected to

413
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,960
c is connected to c it's connected to b it's connected on the left side to one and then it goes to b

414
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,120
and then the black wire is connected to the three and it's also connected to the b

415
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,760
fuck me okay um oh I get it I get it okay so so it's one b is the red right

418
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,120
you need a you need a press an arrow I think oh which one

419
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,320
upper down cut the wire to the direction I don't know click down maybe

420
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:16,000
okay okay okay okay so now I have um four five six on the left and then abc on the right

421
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,760
so um four is connected to four is a blue wire and it's connected to a five is a red

422
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:33,360
cut that one oh cut no what for a yeah it was a blue wire oh I think you have to start from

423
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,960
from one to one down okay start start from one

424
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,120

427
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:11,360
red wire that's connected to c cut if connected to a or c so cut the red wire

428
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:20,320
you just made me die okay I think what the issue is I think on the first panel I had to tell you

429
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:26,800
everything I thought we just need to cut one wire but no I think we have to cut every single one

430
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:34,880
and then we can move on to the next panel I think I didn't quite get it but it's okay

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,600
red red yellow blue blue red

449
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,400
okay

450
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,240
excuse me okay so now we have wires again this time they run um

451
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:24,880
vertical vertical they run vertical so there's a no it's not the same one as before

452
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,160
I know it's complicated wires there's a fucking bend diagram

453
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,760
okay hold on hell fuck I need a I might need a pull out pencil and paper for this shit

454
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,600
okay it's okay we still have three minutes you got this you got this okay um stop calling me I'm mine

455
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:54,640
I'm mine so there's four wires okay are there like stars at the bottom and everything and

456
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,880
then lights at the top there's lights at the top but there's no stars okay no stars oh hold on let me

457
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:15,760
look at the okay okay all right so all the leds are on no

458
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,600
there's okay you're gonna have to be so fucking specific with this shit okay I'll describe it all

459
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,840
is that okay yeah yeah okay let me turn my game volume down it's so loud right now Jesus Christ

460
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:36,000
shut up okay so there's a red wire okay that's the first one and then there's a space and then

461
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,040
there's another red wire and then there's a blue wire and then there's a white wire and then it's

462
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:50,160
blank again okay okay and then at the top okay hold on do it like this say light color and then

463
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,320
there's no stars at all right so just say the whether it has a light and then what color the

464
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:02,960
wire is okay red with light red with no light blue hold on go slow down slow down okay okay red with

465
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:14,320
light um okay red with light and then the next one red with no light red with no light red with no

466
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:25,440
light red with no light red with no light what the fuck red with no light okay okay blue with light

467
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:43,200
blue with light okay okay next one okay okay white with no light white with no light

468
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:54,160
okay god it's just like fucking math class all over again aren't you good at math no i hated this type

469
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:02,480
of math fucking algebra miss me with that shit okay um cut the wire if the last digit of the serial

470
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:12,640
number is even do not cut the wire okay don't cut the wire that has red and light don't cut that one

471
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:24,880
okay um the last digit of the serial number is eight okay so i think if it's red and blue but

472
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:32,960
it's not red and blue fuck oh my god there's only 45 seconds left oh fuck i'm an idiot okay okay hold

473
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,680
on hold on hold on hold on so so so if it's red with light uh cut the wire if the bomb has two or

474
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:47,040
more batteries it has two or more batteries yes okay cut that one the red with the red light yeah

475
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:57,440
okay okay okay okay what's the next one again red with no light red with no light is s um s s s

476
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:04,240
cut the wire if the last digit of the serial number is even so cut yes cut that one okay okay okay

477
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,320
cut the wire if the bomb has a parallel port what the fuck there's a parallel port

478
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,440
oh my god i got at the last moment oh my god it made sense in my brain at the last moment okay

479
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,000
so what i thought it was okay so there's like multiple venn diagrams crossing each other right

480
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,160
i thought it was like math where you have to like put it like factor in all of the variables

481
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,200
and you only look at the area that's inside of like all of the variables but variables together

482
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:48,800
but that's not how that works you only look at two variables or more okay okay okay okay okay

483
00:55:48,800 --> 00:56:00,160
you want to switch yes we can switch okay do you want to do that level yes okay yes i want you to

484
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:10,640
listen i want suffering with you i know my suffering i was there the whole time i've been suffering

485
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,000
okay whatever you're ready i'm ready right now okay dogs let me open

486
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,440
i'll drink with you yeah

487
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:31,680
cheers

488
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,720
that's what it is in japanese okay um i see the venn diagram one let's just start with wires

489
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,360
it is six wires two white one yellow three yellow one blue

490
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,440
not in that order by the way not in that order two white three yellow there's no red okay a

491
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,200
cut the last wire cut the last wire pug okay uh the numbers the numbers on the screen the number on

492
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:09,760
the screen okay what's the display four um press the button in the fourth position four that's

493
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:16,320
number four okay and then four press the button in the same position as you press in stage one

494
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:22,320
so fourth earth position yeah that's number one okay three um

495
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:33,520
which stage are we in third um press the button in the third position that's the number four

496
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,080
then three um press the button in the same position as you press in stage two

497
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:49,760
that's the second position or the first position fuck first position fuck no okay uh

498
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,200
no we have to start all over again okay two it's the number two press the button in the second

499
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:01,920
position four okay second position two this is number two press the button in the same

500
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:10,880
position as you press in stage one that's second position yeah is it okay okay yes uh one press

501
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,880
the button the same label you pressed s is in stage two four okay that was in the second position

502
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:22,080
two press the button in the first position that's the number two

503
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:31,360
three press the button with the same label as you pressed in stage four so two two oh good

504
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:36,000
thank you remember it okay okay all right um the last one is the one with the bend diagrams

505
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,920
is the complex wires that you had before the one with the lights and then stuff

506
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,840
except this time i have all of the wires oh fuck me okay so let me read it look at each wire

507
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:56,320
there's an okay four and four use the vendor here below so whether or not to cut the wires each

508
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:04,400
wire may be striped with multiple colors okay they're not just let you know okay okay so it's just um

509
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:13,360
okay sure i think i can get it okay so do i have to find which vent diagram to use

510
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,400
yes so i'll read you what the uh elements of the wire is and then you find that position on the

511
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,000
vent diagram you correspond that letter to the little chart and then even easy lemon squeezy okay

512
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,680
the first one is no light red no star none of these have stars

513
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,760
red yes red

514
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,080
no light red

515
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:51,600
so because there's no other elements you would just do the one that's only red

516
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,920
okay um overlaps so do i tell you now whether or not to cut it

517
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,560
yes okay cut the wire if the last digit of the serial number is even

518
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:11,200
i heard cut the wire in my fingers slipped okay it's five it's not fucking even okay the next one

519
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:18,320
is light red light red light light uh red oh led red

520
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:36,400
30 seconds i'm shall we uh same same thing same thing so i don't touch it okay um uh no light white

521
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:46,880
i don't think that's on there there's no there's no light oh fuck uh i died there's no white wires

522
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,840
yeah right so i think we just have to skip that one in that case okay i'm going to retry i'm going

523
01:00:53,840 --> 01:01:01,600
to press retry okay okay okay okay i think we got this i think we got this bro okay now that we

524
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:11,920
both experienced it fucking hell oh oh oh okay uh wires normal wires okay there are one two three four

525
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,880
five it's one yellow one black one blue two white

526
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,880
is the last wire black it's white

527
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:38,800
say it again sorry yeah no worries it's one yellow one black one blue two white

528
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,560
okay cut the first wire cut the first wire pog okay uh numbers the number on the screen

529
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:59,200
um okay what's the display three okay press the button in the third position three that's

530
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:07,040
number three okay um then we have one only press the button labeled four uh so the first position

531
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:15,200
okay number one press the button with the same label as you press in stage two brother what did i

532
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:22,720
say it was four one you didn't say anything i fuck what's it water four it was four okay pog

01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:28,880
okay pog uh i can't see she oh it's four four four okay press the button in the same with uh in the

534
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:40,320
same position as you press in stage two um is that one oh nice okay okay three okay press the button

535
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:47,760
in the same label as you press this no no there's two now there's two on the screen two there's two

536
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,360
oh yeah sorry press the button with the same label as you press in stage two

537

540
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:25,760
called nope okay not at all okay okay okay let me look for it i think i might have been closer to

541
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:34,160
the middle oh yep within this one yeah that should hurt my brain that should make no sense to my brain

542
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,560
okay so if you want to go to the next level you hit the down button if you want to go to the

543
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:46,640
previous level you hit the up button okay okay do not switch until you're sure that you have cut

544
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:55,200
all the necessary wires though okay on the current panel okay okay hi hi um wire currents are cumulative

545
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:04,960
all over panels within the module okay okay tell me um tell me what the wires look like

546
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,760
yeah i'll give it to you one by one it's one b red one b

547
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:30,160
so wire currents yep yep okay so don't cut it okay don't cut it the next one is two red b red two b

548
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:41,280
two yes the second wire is red and it's connected to cut it cut it cut it cut it nice okay third wire

549
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:52,000
is black connected to b cut it cut it pog okay down i'm going down okay nice nice we got a light

550
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,480
the next one is fifth wire is red connected to c

551
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:09,760
um don't cut it don't cut it okay next is sixth wire is black c

552
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,400
cut it cut it nice okay next one okay we only have 40 seconds seven black c

553

don't cut it don't cut it red eight c

554
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,720
30 seconds don't cut it don't cut it uh red nine c

556
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,520
seven black c eight red c nine red c

557
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:56,880
no don't cut any of them you said the seventh black connected to c yeah

558
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:04,240
eighth eighth red red oh i side i don't know what i did wrong what the fuck happened there

559
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:11,600
were we on the last level i think that that was second to last oh hey at least i kind of got it

560
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:22,080
yeah you live yeah i had hope for a long time there okay let's do let's do one more game and then um

561
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:31,040
we'll stop there okay doki it's sweaty okay oh shit the timer started already um

562
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,600
uh let's do wires first black uh blue white red god how many

563
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,360
one of each four sorry four so there's one of each yeah yeah yeah yeah

564
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,640
one of each black got the first one oh the black cool okay uh numbers

565
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:04,560
okay i'm ready one um second position fuck i can't see that's three okay

566
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:15,920
okay uh three first position first position does the number two okay one three one two okay two

567
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:23,520
uh same label as you pressed in stage one uh uh fuck i just said it to myself i think it's three

568
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:31,120
okay that's second position um four um same position as you pressed in stage two

569
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:38,960
same position same position say two does first position okay that's three uh four four

570
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:47,040
same label as you pressed in stage three three uh it's that two or one was that two or one same

571
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:51,040
label two or one i'm gonna say it's one

573
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,400
sure we're starting over okay um yeah we're starting over uh third position third position is the number one

574
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:12,160
okay three label three first position first position this number one okay it's one one so far

575
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:19,440
third position first position two same label as stage one one that's in the fourth position god

576
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:28,880
damn okay um three uh same position as stage two i think it's the third position no it was the

577
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,880
first position oh damn it did we have to start over again hold on hold on let me let me let me

578
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,000
fuck let me just kill myself real quick let me kill myself bro i can't

579
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,600
well i accidentally solved um the complex wires so uh we can just keep doing

580
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,800
i accidentally solved it because i just spam clicked every single one because i don't have any i

581
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,960
can't die anymore for what a reason that or i accidentally just clicked every single one

582
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:12,320
that was correct anyways um so back to numbers uh two is displayed oh fuck second position

583
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:18,400
but it's the second but it's the second stage it's second stage oh um same position as you

584
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:28,160
pressed in stage one brother i can't remember that brother you gotta remember it fuck stage one

585
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:34,080
has the first but nope so i really did just accidentally cut every single one of the complex

586
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:40,320
wires that's so fucking funny okay hold on you want to get one dub before we end let's get one

587
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:46,640
dub before we end okay did you want to defuse or do you want me to defuse i'll try defusing okay

588
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,920
sounds good let me end those games then because i accidentally hit retry return to office okay

589
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:59,280
okay i'll do something easy i'll do a hidden message does that work okay i don't know why

590
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:13,680
they're titled this way but okay ready let it all i i all right i'm locked in are you ready kids
