07:07.040 --> 07:09.040
No, you don't have to change anything

07:09.040 --> 07:11.040
As long as you're on stream, you can change it after stream

07:11.040 --> 07:13.040
No one gives a shit when the stream is called

07:13.040 --> 07:15.040
As long as we're online right now

07:15.040 --> 07:17.040
Okay, okay

07:17.040 --> 07:19.040
I'm just doing it because we're all

07:19.040 --> 07:21.040
I'm sitting here

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
The girls are running around

07:23.040 --> 07:25.040

08:09.040 --> 08:11.040
She just says smashing

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
And that's it

08:13.040 --> 08:15.040
She loves smashing

08:15.040 --> 08:17.040
Are we here?

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040

08:19.040 --> 08:21.040

We're good?

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
Yeah, we're here

08:27.040 --> 08:29.040
She's talking to her chat

08:29.040 --> 08:31.040
Blah blah blah

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
We, a viewer, have done the holistic approach

08:33.040 --> 08:35.040
Where none of us will mute

08:35.040 --> 08:37.040
You're just gonna hear everything

08:37.040 --> 08:39.040
All at once

08:39.040 --> 08:41.040
Yeah, that's how we're all

08:41.040 --> 08:43.040
Just as a reminder

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
All donations, memberships

08:45.040 --> 08:47.040
Or super chats will be addressed

08:47.040 --> 08:49.040
At the end of the stream

08:49.040 --> 08:51.040
There's an absolute cluster

08:51.040 --> 08:53.040
Buck of all six of us together

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
But yes

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
The whole premise of the power washer

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
Was I was gonna do a gag and be like

08:59.040 --> 09:01.040
Oh, Viola isn't doing so well

09:01.040 --> 09:03.040
We might go bust

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
So everyone put a bikini on and get clean in

09:05.040 --> 09:07.040
Well, that idea is out the window now

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
So instead we're playing Gartik Phone

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
I've never played it personally

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
She'd be

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
Suggesting it and her word is

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
Law, so let's just

09:17.040 --> 09:19.040
Ah, yes

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
I'm taking over the company

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
I am the shadow CEO

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
Okay, do you guys want to start?

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
You ready?

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
Let's do it

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
Three, two, one

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
Let's go

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
I know cheating

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
So chat, don't fucking cheat

09:37.040 --> 09:39.040
Don't fucking do it, I swear to God

09:39.040 --> 09:41.040
I'll beat your ass

09:41.040 --> 09:43.040
How long do I have to do the sentence?

09:43.040 --> 09:45.040
I don't know

09:45.040 --> 09:47.040
Help me out

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
Help me out

09:55.040 --> 09:57.040
These lines don't give out

09:57.040 --> 09:59.040
Wait until it's over

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
This is our secret

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
Oh wait

10:13.040 --> 10:15.040
I don't think they'll actually know what that is

10:15.040 --> 10:17.040
So let me change it

10:17.040 --> 10:19.040
What's wrong?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.040
We don't have any time

10:21.040 --> 10:23.040
I see

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
We have to draw these now

10:29.040 --> 10:31.040
We have to draw these now

10:31.040 --> 10:33.040
We have to draw this

10:33.040 --> 10:35.040
Oh my God

10:35.040 --> 10:37.040
I'm drawing this

10:37.040 --> 10:39.040
I'm drawing this

10:43.040 --> 10:45.040
I can't see

10:45.040 --> 10:47.040
This is so bad

10:47.040 --> 10:49.040
Oh no

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
Nothing

10:53.040 --> 10:55.040
Wait

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
Smell a smaller sheet

10:57.040 --> 10:59.040
Oh no, why are you

10:59.040 --> 11:01.040
Why are you drawing this?

11:01.040 --> 11:03.040
I don't even know what's happening

11:03.040 --> 11:05.040
I can't see anything

11:05.040 --> 11:07.040
Why are you guys screaming?

11:07.040 --> 11:09.040
Oh my God

11:09.040 --> 11:11.040
How much time is left

11:11.040 --> 11:13.040
Why is it left on my God?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
The top right corner is the indicator

11:15.040 --> 11:17.040
Not the shading

11:17.040 --> 11:19.040
I'm an artist

11:19.040 --> 11:21.040
I wish I brought my drawing tablet out

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
An artist

11:25.040 --> 11:27.040
Oh yeah, wait

11:27.040 --> 11:29.040
All you can fucking draw about me

11:29.040 --> 11:31.040
No, we're using our moses

11:31.040 --> 11:33.040
I can look up with the logo

11:37.040 --> 11:39.040
We need to do a witness time

11:39.040 --> 11:41.040
Oh

11:49.040 --> 11:51.040
What the fuck am I doing

11:51.040 --> 11:53.040
What is this shit

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
I should whip out my drawing tablet

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
for this

12:01.040 --> 12:03.040
Actually it's better with a mouse

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
Better with a mouse

12:05.040 --> 12:07.040
No, it's better with a mouse

12:07.040 --> 12:09.040
It looks like hot garden

12:09.040 --> 12:11.040
It looks great

12:11.040 --> 12:13.040
It's like a fucking cave

12:13.040 --> 12:15.040
I think I'm done

12:15.040 --> 12:17.040
Would you?

12:17.040 --> 12:19.040

What's that say

12:23.040 --> 12:25.040
Can't tell you

100% wood

12:33.040 --> 12:35.040

12:35.040 --> 12:37.040
We need to put the chat logs in quick

12:37.040 --> 12:39.040
These are the chat logs

12:39.040 --> 12:41.040
Oh good answer

Chat logs?

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040

Let's put a bit of detail

12:47.040 --> 12:49.040

12:51.040 --> 12:53.040
Freak

12:53.040 --> 12:55.040
You're trying to describe it

What the fuck

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
There we go

13:19.040 --> 13:21.040
What do you think

13:25.040 --> 13:27.040

13:27.040 --> 13:29.040

13:29.040 --> 13:31.040
Oh no

13:31.040 --> 13:33.040

13:51.040 --> 13:53.040

13:55.040 --> 13:57.040
I don't know what Thornberry looks like

13:57.040 --> 13:59.040
Oh no

13:59.040 --> 14:01.040
I had to look it up

14:01.040 --> 14:03.040
I'm just going for it

14:03.040 --> 14:05.040

14:09.040 --> 14:11.040
I don't look like that

14:11.040 --> 14:13.040
Sugar

14:13.040 --> 14:15.040
Don't question

14:15.040 --> 14:17.040
They can't curve

14:17.040 --> 14:19.040
Bunches

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
Don't question this

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
What the fuck

14:33.040 --> 14:35.040
How do you draw

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
I don't know

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
I don't know

14:39.040 --> 14:41.040

14:47.040 --> 14:49.040
Oh I don't know how to draw

14:49.040 --> 14:51.040
I don't know how to draw anymore

14:51.040 --> 14:53.040
That's great

14:53.040 --> 14:55.040
That's pretty good right

14:55.040 --> 14:57.040
They agree with me

14:57.040 --> 14:59.040
Oh my god

14:59.040 --> 15:01.040
This is something

15:01.040 --> 15:03.040
Hold on

15:03.040 --> 15:05.040
Oh shit

15:05.040 --> 15:07.040
Ginger in it

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
Sweet

15:09.040 --> 15:11.040
I don't know what

15:15.040 --> 15:17.040
This is awful

15:17.040 --> 15:19.040
I'm sorry

15:21.040 --> 15:23.040
This is

15:23.040 --> 15:25.040

Oh my god

15:31.040 --> 15:33.040
Oh my goodness

15:33.040 --> 15:35.040
Draw his thorn

15:35.040 --> 15:37.040
His nose

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
Just google a picture

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
I'm still late

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
The phone rang

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
That is very nice thank you

15:51.040 --> 15:53.040
I'm glad you agree to it

15:53.040 --> 15:55.040
My little leaflings are saying I'm a true artist

15:55.040 --> 15:57.040
Your hair is not orange

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
Is it?

15:59.040 --> 16:01.040
Oh my god

16:01.040 --> 16:03.040
Wait I'm ginger

16:03.040 --> 16:05.040
Are you blonde

16:05.040 --> 16:07.040
Your hair is orange

16:07.040 --> 16:09.040
I thought I was blonde

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
This whole time

16:11.040 --> 16:13.040
I've been drawing myself

16:13.040 --> 16:15.040
What the fuck are you looking at

16:15.040 --> 16:17.040
I'm sorry

16:17.040 --> 16:19.040
In my image

16:19.040 --> 16:21.040
What does that even say

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
May I

16:23.040 --> 16:25.040
Eat

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
Meow

16:27.040 --> 16:29.040
Oh meow

16:29.040 --> 16:31.040
Oh my god

16:31.040 --> 16:33.040
Meow

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
Which one of you speaks Spanish

16:35.040 --> 16:37.040

Oh lord

16:39.040 --> 16:41.040

16:41.040 --> 16:43.040
Oh

How am I supposed to draw that

16:45.040 --> 16:47.040
Oh my god

16:47.040 --> 16:49.040
Oh my god

16:49.040 --> 16:51.040
Did we even have

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
What do I look like

16:53.040 --> 16:55.040
Oh wait I can't even draw the fucking toilet

16:55.040 --> 16:57.040
Alright hold on

16:57.040 --> 16:59.040
What do I even look like

16:59.040 --> 17:01.040
Oh

17:01.040 --> 17:03.040
This is terrible

17:03.040 --> 17:05.040
This is so hard with a mouse

17:05.040 --> 17:07.040
Um

17:07.040 --> 17:09.040
I love this shit

17:09.040 --> 17:11.040
It's so fucking cursed

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
Hits his armpits

17:13.040 --> 17:15.040
We're grabbing onto the ground

17:15.040 --> 17:17.040
We're holding onto your life

17:17.040 --> 17:19.040
Right armpits

17:19.040 --> 17:21.040
So

17:21.040 --> 17:23.040
I don't know

17:23.040 --> 17:25.040
Oh my god

17:25.040 --> 17:27.040
Cause

17:27.040 --> 17:29.040
Cause none of you guys know like some English phrases

17:29.040 --> 17:31.040
Or some like

17:31.040 --> 17:33.040
Jokey phrases so I can already

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
Like what I'm hearing is that a lot of you guys are misinterpreting

17:35.040 --> 17:37.040
What I've written and it's very funny

17:37.040 --> 17:39.040
It's going all over his back

17:39.040 --> 17:41.040
It's not looking good

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
Edit

17:43.040 --> 17:45.040
How do you draw an angry mouse

17:45.040 --> 17:47.040
Like a

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
Oh there we go

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
And then

17:53.040 --> 17:55.040
And we need

17:55.040 --> 17:57.040
We need to draw

17:57.040 --> 17:59.040
Weeds of sweat

17:59.040 --> 18:01.040
This is amazing

18:01.040 --> 18:03.040
What does the Walmart logo look like

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
What

18:05.040 --> 18:07.040
Your armpits has become sentience

18:09.040 --> 18:11.040
Walmart

18:11.040 --> 18:13.040
I'm not even going to explain to Mercy

18:13.040 --> 18:15.040
Are you going to call it toilet?

18:15.040 --> 18:17.040
Oh wait

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
Don't do toilet

18:21.040 --> 18:23.040
Oh wait

18:25.040 --> 18:27.040
I see

18:35.040 --> 18:37.040
It makes it worse

18:37.040 --> 18:39.040
It makes it worse

18:39.040 --> 18:41.040
Oh my god

18:59.040 --> 19:01.040
I think that works out

19:03.040 --> 19:05.040
Oh my god

19:05.040 --> 19:07.040
I can't wait to see everyone

19:07.040 --> 19:09.040
All according

19:09.040 --> 19:11.040
Now we'll get to see everything

19:15.040 --> 19:17.040
There's going to be no voice over

19:17.040 --> 19:19.040
And then we'll do

19:19.040 --> 19:21.040
Beginning from the end

19:21.040 --> 19:23.040
Okay

19:23.040 --> 19:25.040
So

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
So I said

19:37.040 --> 19:39.040
And Mercy's

19:39.040 --> 19:41.040

19:41.040 --> 19:43.040
My favorite mood

19:43.040 --> 19:45.040
Mashery

19:45.040 --> 19:47.040
Mash

19:47.040 --> 19:49.040
Scrum

19:49.040 --> 19:51.040

19:59.040 --> 20:01.040
This is over

20:03.040 --> 20:05.040

20:07.040 --> 20:09.040
Oh my god

20:11.040 --> 20:13.040
Oh my god

20:21.040 --> 20:23.040
Okay

20:23.040 --> 20:25.040

20:25.040 --> 20:27.040
Oh no

20:27.040 --> 20:29.040
Oh boy

20:29.040 --> 20:31.040
Your honor

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
She wanted it

20:33.040 --> 20:35.040
Oh my god

20:35.040 --> 20:37.040
She said it's going to jail for the crabs

20:37.040 --> 20:39.040
You know date look

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040

20:43.040 --> 20:45.040
Okay

Oh my god

20:57.040 --> 20:59.040
I love it

20:59.040 --> 21:01.040
I love it

21:01.040 --> 21:03.040
It actually worked out

21:03.040 --> 21:05.040
Why is your OG Santa such a fat cock?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.040
Yeah

21:07.040 --> 21:09.040
Because he loves me

21:09.040 --> 21:11.040
And his dick grows thick

21:11.040 --> 21:13.040
With all the love you have for me

21:13.040 --> 21:15.040
They grew sick of times that day

21:15.040 --> 21:17.040
All right

21:17.040 --> 21:19.040
Sestrani's

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
I'm sorry

21:21.040 --> 21:23.040
Oh my god

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
Mercy's cheesy

21:25.040 --> 21:27.040
Festival in Feet

21:27.040 --> 21:29.040
Oh no

21:29.040 --> 21:31.040
I feel like her feet is actual cheese

21:31.040 --> 21:33.040
I know

21:39.040 --> 21:41.040
I like that

21:41.040 --> 21:43.040
I like that

21:43.040 --> 21:45.040
Stinky Pete's

21:45.040 --> 21:47.040
But like

21:47.040 --> 21:49.040
And then she drew

21:49.040 --> 21:51.040
Pits

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
Oh my god

21:55.040 --> 21:57.040
Oh my god that's too good

21:59.040 --> 22:01.040
She's cutting out

22:01.040 --> 22:03.040
She's screaming so loud

22:05.040 --> 22:07.040
That's her

22:07.040 --> 22:09.040
Okay

22:13.040 --> 22:15.040
Very good artist

22:15.040 --> 22:17.040
Thank you

22:19.040 --> 22:21.040
What does that even mean?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
When your job is a poo

22:23.040 --> 22:25.040
So when your poo hits your prostate

22:25.040 --> 22:27.040
On the way out it feels good

22:27.040 --> 22:29.040
Oh my god

22:31.040 --> 22:33.040
What is this?

22:35.040 --> 22:37.040
Is Amy sucking?

22:37.040 --> 22:39.040
Amy suckers on them hot toes

22:41.040 --> 22:43.040
Oh wait, is she giving a blowjob?

22:43.040 --> 22:45.040
That's what it looks like

22:45.040 --> 22:47.040
Mercy what did you draw?

22:47.040 --> 22:49.040
What does it look like to me?

22:49.040 --> 22:51.040
Oh my god

22:51.040 --> 22:53.040
Really?

22:53.040 --> 22:55.040
Oh my god

22:55.040 --> 22:57.040
I love the drool

22:57.040 --> 22:59.040
This is so fucking good

22:59.040 --> 23:01.040
The drool is so good

23:01.040 --> 23:03.040
Oh boy

23:03.040 --> 23:05.040
We are

23:05.040 --> 23:07.040
Over some pie

23:07.040 --> 23:09.040
Okay

23:09.040 --> 23:11.040
That was pretty good

23:11.040 --> 23:13.040
That's really cute toilets

23:13.040 --> 23:15.040
That's not a cat

23:15.040 --> 23:17.040
That's not a cat

23:17.040 --> 23:19.040
Meow

23:19.040 --> 23:21.040
Meow

23:21.040 --> 23:23.040
Meow winky face

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
Okay it's a winky face

23:25.040 --> 23:27.040
I was like what is meowers

23:27.040 --> 23:29.040
I was like no one speaks Spanish

23:29.040 --> 23:31.040
I didn't hire anyone to speak Spanish

23:31.040 --> 23:33.040
Neato

23:33.040 --> 23:35.040
Neato

23:37.040 --> 23:39.040
Neato

23:39.040 --> 23:41.040
That's good

23:41.040 --> 23:43.040
I love that

23:47.040 --> 23:49.040
Okay this makes sense

23:49.040 --> 23:51.040
This makes sense of what

23:51.040 --> 23:53.040
on earth we were drawing

23:53.040 --> 23:55.040
Because I was to check out

23:55.040 --> 23:57.040
And like that's items on the shelves

23:57.040 --> 23:59.040
I worked really hard

23:59.040 --> 24:01.040
I didn't get that

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
Oh this is a good diaper

24:03.040 --> 24:05.040
I see understood me

24:11.040 --> 24:13.040
I love the details

24:13.040 --> 24:15.040
Take the magic

24:15.040 --> 24:17.040
Honestly

24:17.040 --> 24:19.040
Why is it coming out of his back

24:19.040 --> 24:21.040
It's fighting for his life

24:21.040 --> 24:23.040
It's going everywhere

24:23.040 --> 24:25.040
It's going everywhere

24:25.040 --> 24:27.040
It's like air is back

24:27.040 --> 24:29.040
I can't

24:29.040 --> 24:31.040
I had toilet stole cap

24:31.040 --> 24:33.040
Because that's all I see about

24:33.040 --> 24:35.040
When I like see American memes

24:35.040 --> 24:37.040
They're like oh the toilet stole

24:37.040 --> 24:39.040
The toilet gap is so big

24:39.040 --> 24:41.040
You can literally look at people's eyes

24:41.040 --> 24:43.040
Is it not like that

24:43.040 --> 24:45.040
It's a different version

24:45.040 --> 24:47.040
We have them closed

24:47.040 --> 24:49.040
Because you know it's a private time

24:49.040 --> 24:51.040
And you're very vulnerable taking a big job

24:51.040 --> 24:53.040
So yeah it's actually closed everywhere

24:53.040 --> 24:55.040
Else in the planet

24:55.040 --> 24:57.040
You're so lucky

24:57.040 --> 24:59.040
I had people peeking at me

24:59.040 --> 25:01.040
In high school through the stalls

25:01.040 --> 25:03.040
Me too

25:03.040 --> 25:05.040
Oh no it didn't

25:05.040 --> 25:07.040
Is there a check

25:07.040 --> 25:09.040
Is there a check

25:09.040 --> 25:11.040
Is there a DC check

25:11.040 --> 25:13.040
Do you need to reload that

25:13.040 --> 25:15.040
It's gonna

25:15.040 --> 25:17.040
Do it on its own usually

25:17.040 --> 25:19.040
No I'm gone

25:19.040 --> 25:21.040
The link should be in the discord

25:21.040 --> 25:23.040
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord

25:23.040 --> 25:25.040
Don't

25:25.040 --> 25:27.040
Do that

25:27.040 --> 25:29.040
Of our naughty photos

25:29.040 --> 25:31.040
We just sent to each other

25:33.040 --> 25:35.040
It's mostly memes

25:35.040 --> 25:37.040
Any memers

25:37.040 --> 25:39.040
I mean to be fair we did share

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
Some naughty photos

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
We did share some

25:43.040 --> 25:45.040
Lucky nudes of ours

25:45.040 --> 25:47.040
They've seen my TTs

25:47.040 --> 25:49.040
So uh

25:49.040 --> 25:51.040
I started roleplaying as the girls with my nudes

25:51.040 --> 25:53.040
So I was like this is what Ibi would do

25:53.040 --> 25:55.040
This is what Acey would do

25:55.040 --> 25:57.040
This discord is so chaotic

25:57.040 --> 25:59.040
Okay real though

26:01.040 --> 26:03.040
But also I did snort out my T

26:03.040 --> 26:05.040
It like went down the wrong hole

26:05.040 --> 26:07.040
And went up my nose

26:07.040 --> 26:09.040
Wow mercy I hear snort and

26:09.040 --> 26:11.040
T

26:11.040 --> 26:13.040
This is what galley offers

26:13.040 --> 26:15.040
A stosterone

26:15.040 --> 26:17.040
Is this better

26:17.040 --> 26:19.040
Yeah

26:19.040 --> 26:21.040
Are you in game

26:21.040 --> 26:23.040
I pushed it

26:23.040 --> 26:25.040
That's what it's like so in my ears

26:25.040 --> 26:27.040
I'm getting a little deep

26:27.040 --> 26:29.040
Getting another hard beat right now

26:29.040 --> 26:31.040
Every time she talks

26:31.040 --> 26:33.040
Have a turn

26:33.040 --> 26:35.040
News or eye round news

26:35.040 --> 26:37.040
What do you think

26:39.040 --> 26:41.040
Oopsy

26:41.040 --> 26:43.040
Oopsy

26:43.040 --> 26:45.040
Oopsy

26:47.040 --> 26:49.040
I feel like Azura could do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression

26:49.040 --> 26:51.040
Me too

26:51.040 --> 26:53.040
Jennifer Coolidge

26:53.040 --> 26:55.040
Do do do do

26:55.040 --> 26:57.040
I don't know

26:57.040 --> 26:59.040
Jennifer Coolidge's impression

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
Wait you don't know Jennifer Coolidge

27:01.040 --> 27:03.040
Oh Jennifer Coolidge

27:05.040 --> 27:07.040
I

27:07.040 --> 27:09.040
I'm gonna switch

27:09.040 --> 27:11.040
Oh my god

27:11.040 --> 27:13.040
I can't do it

27:13.040 --> 27:15.040
Oh my god

27:15.040 --> 27:17.040
Jennifer Coolidge

27:17.040 --> 27:19.040
You can't go in your gap

27:19.040 --> 27:21.040
For the Rizzler

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
Why are we opening our gap

27:23.040 --> 27:25.040
For the Rizzler

27:25.040 --> 27:27.040
Azura

27:27.040 --> 27:29.040
Azura

27:29.040 --> 27:31.040
Azura

27:31.040 --> 27:33.040
Click that link in the general

27:33.040 --> 27:35.040
Click that link

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
You can't go in

27:37.040 --> 27:39.040
You can't go in

27:39.040 --> 27:41.040
I can't go in

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
I can't go in

27:43.040 --> 27:45.040
What is happening

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
You're making cuts

27:47.040 --> 27:49.040
When you do that Azura

27:49.040 --> 27:51.040
So it just goes

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
Eww

27:53.040 --> 27:55.040
What's happening

27:55.040 --> 27:57.040
What's happening anymore

27:57.040 --> 27:59.040
It's constantly loading

27:59.040 --> 28:01.040
It's literally

28:01.040 --> 28:03.040
It's literally

28:03.040 --> 28:05.040
Let me do another

28:05.040 --> 28:07.040
I'm gonna

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
Will you guys see the discord

28:09.040 --> 28:11.040
If I open it okay you guys can't see it

28:11.040 --> 28:13.040
No

28:13.040 --> 28:15.040
I shouldn't see anything else

28:15.040 --> 28:17.040
I would close the window capture

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
In the OBS just in case

28:19.040 --> 28:21.040
Yes you can open it

28:21.040 --> 28:23.040
Are we restarting a new lobby

28:23.040 --> 28:25.040
A new lobby

28:25.040 --> 28:27.040
I think we should all invite to this lobby

28:27.040 --> 28:29.040
A bit of all

28:29.040 --> 28:31.040
Why is there two

28:31.040 --> 28:33.040
Are we going to a different room

28:33.040 --> 28:35.040
I don't know

28:35.040 --> 28:37.040
Why is there two

28:37.040 --> 28:39.040
I only see one of you

28:39.040 --> 28:41.040
No on mine

28:41.040 --> 28:43.040
There's

28:43.040 --> 28:45.040
No

28:45.040 --> 28:47.040
Where'd you go

28:47.040 --> 28:49.040
Okay which one should we play

28:49.040 --> 28:51.040
Normal

28:51.040 --> 28:53.040
Which we just did

28:53.040 --> 28:55.040
Knock off, keep yourself focused

28:55.040 --> 28:57.040
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster

28:57.040 --> 28:59.040
Animation

28:59.040 --> 29:01.040
Create an animation in a collaborative way

29:01.040 --> 29:03.040
Icebreaker, play with a sentence

29:03.040 --> 29:05.040
Ask questions and have fun with others drawings

29:05.040 --> 29:07.040
Exquisite co-ops

29:07.040 --> 29:09.040
Create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings

29:09.040 --> 29:11.040
Don't know what that means

29:11.040 --> 29:13.040
Hold on

29:13.040 --> 29:15.040
Burt friends have a good time with that

29:15.040 --> 29:17.040
Compliment, complete the sketch

29:17.040 --> 29:19.040
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations

29:19.040 --> 29:21.040
Masterpiece, create a piece of art

29:21.040 --> 29:23.040
Play in a single turn with no time limit

29:23.040 --> 29:25.040
I feel like story would be funny

29:25.040 --> 29:27.040
Let's try a previous sentence

29:27.040 --> 29:29.040
Story, story, story

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
Do you want to do a story

29:31.040 --> 29:33.040
Let's try a story

29:33.040 --> 29:35.040
What are you doing

29:35.040 --> 29:37.040
Sorry

29:37.040 --> 29:39.040
Oh

29:43.040 --> 29:45.040
Wait do I have to write a full story

29:45.040 --> 29:47.040
Or just a sentence

29:47.040 --> 29:49.040
Just a sentence

29:49.040 --> 29:51.040
Okay

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
Oh

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
Do you like write the whole story

29:55.040 --> 29:57.040
Or no

29:57.040 --> 29:59.040
You have really limited characters

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
I don't know it

30:03.040 --> 30:05.040
No

30:05.040 --> 30:07.040
What did you do

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
There's time

30:11.040 --> 30:13.040
15 seconds love

30:13.040 --> 30:15.040
I wanted to write more

30:15.040 --> 30:17.040
I wanted to write more

30:17.040 --> 30:19.040
I can only write one sentence

30:19.040 --> 30:21.040
Shit

30:21.040 --> 30:23.040
I feel like I should be drunk

30:27.040 --> 30:29.040
We are not beating the caca

30:29.040 --> 30:31.040
No we're not

30:31.040 --> 30:33.040
What the fuck is happening

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
Oh they're going to know this is me spelling it

30:43.040 --> 30:45.040
Because I didn't use that Z

30:45.040 --> 30:47.040
Don't know

30:49.040 --> 30:51.040
I'm just going to leave it like that

30:51.040 --> 30:53.040
Yep

30:53.040 --> 30:55.040
I'm sending it

30:55.040 --> 30:57.040
I'm not even spell checking

30:57.040 --> 30:59.040
The lack of spell check is good

30:59.040 --> 31:01.040
Fuck it

31:01.040 --> 31:03.040
I'm bad at stories

31:03.040 --> 31:05.040
What is this

31:05.040 --> 31:07.040
Why

31:13.040 --> 31:15.040
It's over

31:19.040 --> 31:21.040
Oh

31:21.040 --> 31:23.040
Oh the sentence is so small

31:23.040 --> 31:25.040
Like I want to give a bit more

31:25.040 --> 31:27.040
Me too

31:27.040 --> 31:29.040
But it's too short

31:29.040 --> 31:31.040
I think it gets shorter over time

31:33.040 --> 31:35.040
I want to be like bi-

31:41.040 --> 31:43.040
Well I could have write until

31:43.040 --> 31:45.040
Fuck

31:45.040 --> 31:47.040
What

31:47.040 --> 31:49.040
What

31:49.040 --> 31:51.040
You're sleeping

31:51.040 --> 31:53.040
Wow

31:53.040 --> 31:55.040
Let's see

31:57.040 --> 31:59.040
Oh no

31:59.040 --> 32:01.040
Fuck

32:01.040 --> 32:03.040
Fuck I'm so bad

32:07.040 --> 32:09.040
It's funny because

32:09.040 --> 32:11.040
I hate this I can't think of anything

32:11.040 --> 32:13.040
The reeflings, the snowberries, the snippets

32:13.040 --> 32:15.040
The pin pals

32:15.040 --> 32:17.040
The bleedin' hearts

32:17.040 --> 32:19.040
And the harem all get to see this unfold

32:19.040 --> 32:21.040
And we're all just tapin' like

32:21.040 --> 32:23.040
Ugh

32:23.040 --> 32:25.040
Fuck it

32:25.040 --> 32:27.040
Oh you

32:27.040 --> 32:29.040
Wait is that the fucking

32:39.040 --> 32:41.040
You watch fucking

32:41.040 --> 32:43.040
Bank theory

32:43.040 --> 32:45.040
Wait that's a nice spell

32:45.040 --> 32:47.040
Paris

32:47.040 --> 32:49.040
Fuck

32:49.040 --> 32:51.040
Give me more

32:57.040 --> 32:59.040
I need more letters

32:59.040 --> 33:01.040
I need more like I can't

33:01.040 --> 33:03.040
I don't know why they didn't

33:03.040 --> 33:05.040
Go ahead and play this

33:05.040 --> 33:07.040
To help me spend song lyrics

33:07.040 --> 33:09.040
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

33:09.040 --> 33:11.040
That sounds like she me

33:13.040 --> 33:15.040
No

33:17.040 --> 33:19.040
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

33:19.040 --> 33:21.040
Wait

33:21.040 --> 33:23.040
This

33:23.040 --> 33:25.040
This agency

33:25.040 --> 33:27.040
We can just

33:27.040 --> 33:29.040
This agency

33:29.040 --> 33:31.040
I spelled it wrong but that's the point

33:31.040 --> 33:33.040
I hate that's like

33:33.040 --> 33:35.040
They don't give you enough to write

33:35.040 --> 33:37.040
Yeah there's no story

33:37.040 --> 33:39.040
Not enough

33:39.040 --> 33:41.040
Fuck off

33:43.040 --> 33:45.040
Okay let's see what's happening

33:49.040 --> 33:51.040
So how about everybody

33:51.040 --> 33:53.040
Read their own story like

33:53.040 --> 33:55.040
Okay

33:55.040 --> 33:57.040
Okay I go first

33:57.040 --> 33:59.040
In a galaxy far far away

33:59.040 --> 34:01.040
There was a goat with big titties

34:01.040 --> 34:03.040
She had so much milkers

34:03.040 --> 34:05.040
It started raining milk

34:05.040 --> 34:07.040
Azera then went home

34:07.040 --> 34:09.040
To make an empire bane milk daily

34:09.040 --> 34:11.040
It was so successful

34:11.040 --> 34:13.040
The neighboring kingdoms became jealous

34:13.040 --> 34:15.040
They also

34:15.040 --> 34:17.040
Wanted some of the juicy

34:19.040 --> 34:21.040
Ew cooties

34:21.040 --> 34:23.040
We're not good

34:27.040 --> 34:29.040
Okay long time ago

34:29.040 --> 34:31.040
In a kingdom called far away

34:33.040 --> 34:35.040
There was a boy by princess

34:35.040 --> 34:37.040
Who was trying to fit into

34:41.040 --> 34:43.040
Their love was stronger than any foreign addiction

34:43.040 --> 34:45.040
They couldn't stop jerking

34:45.040 --> 34:47.040
I'm so sorry I'm jerking

34:47.040 --> 34:49.040
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

34:51.040 --> 34:53.040
They say it's just a jerk

34:57.040 --> 34:59.040
I was like this agency

34:59.040 --> 35:01.040
Ding ding

35:01.040 --> 35:03.040
Ding ding

35:03.040 --> 35:05.040
It was supposed to be the song like ding ding

35:05.040 --> 35:07.040
Ding ding

35:07.040 --> 35:09.040
I was so hard

35:09.040 --> 35:11.040
I was in Paris

35:17.040 --> 35:19.040
There was a beach of agency

35:19.040 --> 35:21.040
That was lit

35:21.040 --> 35:23.040
They opened

35:23.040 --> 35:25.040
And controlled the urges

35:25.040 --> 35:27.040
So they danced

35:27.040 --> 35:29.040
The pee pee danced until they kicked

35:31.040 --> 35:33.040
And then finally they peed everywhere

35:33.040 --> 35:35.040
On the floor

35:35.040 --> 35:37.040
The walls, the bed, the kind

35:39.040 --> 35:41.040
We're all filled with piss everywhere

35:41.040 --> 35:43.040
But he loved it

35:43.040 --> 35:45.040
The fact that we're going to piss

35:45.040 --> 35:47.040
Prompt before AC came out with that

35:47.040 --> 35:49.040
Let's just say there wasn't any AC

35:49.040 --> 35:51.040
Because of the board

35:53.040 --> 35:55.040
AC came out of the board

35:57.040 --> 35:59.040
I'm sorry

35:59.040 --> 36:01.040
This is so good

36:01.040 --> 36:03.040
Okay

36:03.040 --> 36:05.040
Once upon a time there were whores

36:05.040 --> 36:07.040
They were the elitist of whores

36:07.040 --> 36:09.040
They had wild whores

36:09.040 --> 36:11.040
They had all these really cute cowgirls

36:11.040 --> 36:13.040
They had so cute

36:13.040 --> 36:15.040
So fuzzy

36:15.040 --> 36:17.040
So pussy warm

36:17.040 --> 36:19.040
Thanks

36:19.040 --> 36:21.040
You're more like bang bang your mama

36:21.040 --> 36:23.040
Keep my mom out of your home now

36:25.040 --> 36:27.040
I'm sorry

36:27.040 --> 36:29.040
10 out of 10

36:31.040 --> 36:33.040
That's the time they were like this

36:33.040 --> 36:35.040
Oh no

36:35.040 --> 36:37.040
Oh no

36:41.040 --> 36:43.040
Oh no

36:59.040 --> 37:01.040
Oh shit

37:01.040 --> 37:12.240
I know you guys know why I write the scripts in v-alert

37:12.240 --> 37:13.240
Why am I?

37:13.240 --> 37:15.520
I think we can deserve a road of each other

37:15.520 --> 37:20.520
She was sad because she realized she didn't have the frosting

37:20.520 --> 37:27.520
Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?

37:27.520 --> 37:33.520
She became sheep green tentacles

37:33.520 --> 37:37.520
Fuck no

37:37.520 --> 37:41.520
So no, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic

37:41.520 --> 37:45.520
Azura, do you have a mic filter on? I can never hear you

37:45.520 --> 37:47.520
Who's turning that mic?

37:47.520 --> 37:49.520
Get that steel seat out

37:49.520 --> 37:51.520
See that steel steering

37:51.520 --> 37:53.520
No it's not

37:53.520 --> 37:55.520
Don't have a filter on

37:55.520 --> 37:57.520
There's no filter on?

37:57.520 --> 37:59.520
What is happening?

37:59.520 --> 38:01.520
Your steel series filter

38:01.520 --> 38:03.520
I don't have a filter

38:03.520 --> 38:05.520
Don't have one on

38:05.520 --> 38:09.520
What is happening?

38:09.520 --> 38:13.520
Can't wait for the void if they survive

38:13.520 --> 38:15.520
They'll be fine

38:15.520 --> 38:17.520
They'll be fine

38:17.520 --> 38:19.520
Do you want to try another one?

38:19.520 --> 38:21.520
Another, another, another

38:21.520 --> 38:23.520
Another one

38:23.520 --> 38:25.520
Please, please, no more shit

38:25.520 --> 38:27.520
No more shit and piss

38:27.520 --> 38:29.520
No more shit, stop

38:29.520 --> 38:31.520
No promises

38:31.520 --> 38:33.520
I didn't even do what you said

38:33.520 --> 38:35.520
It was you guys

38:35.520 --> 38:37.520
Can we do a compliment?

38:37.520 --> 38:39.520
We have promised one

38:39.520 --> 38:41.520
Compliment

38:41.520 --> 38:43.520
All the actions are a mystery

38:43.520 --> 38:45.520
Drawings and sentences are hidden during this

38:45.520 --> 38:47.520
You can't hear mercy, mercy test

38:47.520 --> 38:49.520
Mercy test?

38:49.520 --> 38:51.520
Sorry, I was muting because I was coughing

38:51.520 --> 38:53.520
Okay, mercy test complete

38:53.520 --> 38:55.520
Do you want to do a compliment?

38:55.520 --> 38:57.520
What is that?

38:57.520 --> 38:59.520
We draw on each other's drawings

38:59.520 --> 39:01.520
We should try that

39:01.520 --> 39:03.520
I think that would be fun

39:03.520 --> 39:05.520
Can't wait to draw so much piss

39:05.520 --> 39:07.520
That's the basic lines

39:07.520 --> 39:09.520
Start sketch some basic lines

39:09.520 --> 39:11.520
Okay

39:11.520 --> 39:13.520
We'll do this

39:13.520 --> 39:15.520
Okay

39:15.520 --> 39:17.520
Okay

39:17.520 --> 39:19.520
Okay

39:19.520 --> 39:21.520
We'll do this

39:35.520 --> 39:37.520
I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks

39:43.520 --> 39:45.520
Are you so cute?

39:45.520 --> 39:47.520
What the fuck

39:49.520 --> 39:51.520
You know exactly what you did

39:51.520 --> 39:53.520
And no, I don't have the strength to resist

39:55.520 --> 39:57.520
What's going on?

39:57.520 --> 39:59.520
I got it, I can make this

39:59.520 --> 40:01.520
I can salvage this

40:01.520 --> 40:03.520
This is the back legs of it

40:03.520 --> 40:05.520
And then this is its huge

40:05.520 --> 40:07.520
Mokers

40:07.520 --> 40:09.520
And then this

40:09.520 --> 40:11.520
This is its legs

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
There you go

40:13.520 --> 40:15.520
Only a few more left

40:15.520 --> 40:17.520
Uh huh

40:17.520 --> 40:19.520
You're so dirty

40:19.520 --> 40:21.520
Don't be so dirty minded

40:21.520 --> 40:23.520
Honestly

40:23.520 --> 40:25.520
I'll get the girl to tell you off

40:25.520 --> 40:27.520
If you don't behave

40:27.520 --> 40:29.520
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore

40:29.520 --> 40:31.520
What

40:31.520 --> 40:33.520
Cute

40:37.520 --> 40:39.520
Rude to me

40:41.520 --> 40:43.520
Wait

40:43.520 --> 40:45.520
Am I supposed to finish this off?

40:45.520 --> 40:47.520
Are we supposed to finish it all?

40:47.520 --> 40:49.520
I think so because it's given us tons of time

40:49.520 --> 40:51.520
Hold on

40:51.520 --> 40:53.520
Oh, okay

40:57.520 --> 40:59.520
I fixed it

40:59.520 --> 41:01.520
I fixed it

41:03.520 --> 41:05.520
A big fish up bro

41:05.520 --> 41:07.520
Oh my god, I've just made Chibi

41:07.520 --> 41:09.520
What the hell

41:09.520 --> 41:11.520
I heard my name

41:11.520 --> 41:13.520
Oh wait, that's a thing

41:13.520 --> 41:15.520
Oh no, that looks like

41:15.520 --> 41:17.520
Dang it

41:17.520 --> 41:19.520
Let's just do that

41:21.520 --> 41:23.520
There you go

41:23.520 --> 41:25.520
I saved it

41:25.520 --> 41:27.520
I saved it

41:27.520 --> 41:29.520
Babe, it gave you a lot more time

41:29.520 --> 41:31.520
Yeah, you're to finish it

41:31.520 --> 41:33.520
Ah, you need to finish

41:33.520 --> 41:35.520
Okay, I'm fucking stupid

41:35.520 --> 41:37.520
Okay

41:37.520 --> 41:39.520
So Am I, don't worry

41:39.520 --> 41:41.520
I saved it

41:41.520 --> 41:43.520
Let me do it

41:45.520 --> 41:47.520
Let's put some nice shading in

41:47.520 --> 41:49.520
To make this look extra beautiful

41:51.520 --> 41:53.520
Wow

41:53.520 --> 41:55.520
Let's put lipstick on

41:55.520 --> 41:57.520
Yeah

41:57.520 --> 41:59.520
So beautiful

41:59.520 --> 42:01.520
I saved it

42:05.520 --> 42:07.520
They pranked me

42:07.520 --> 42:09.520
I think this is the best time

42:13.520 --> 42:15.520
Who drew a pair of hairy ball sacks?

42:15.520 --> 42:17.520
Come on

42:17.520 --> 42:19.520
What?

42:19.520 --> 42:21.520
What are we supposed to do with this?

42:23.520 --> 42:25.520
She's supposed to add the shaft

42:29.520 --> 42:31.520
Oh, I really know what I want to do

42:31.520 --> 42:33.520
But I know I shouldn't do it

42:33.520 --> 42:35.520
Because we're on YouTube

42:35.520 --> 42:37.520
I'm fixing this

42:39.520 --> 42:41.520
Oh no

42:41.520 --> 42:43.520
I can't

42:43.520 --> 42:45.520
One thing

42:45.520 --> 42:47.520
This is amazing

42:47.520 --> 42:49.520
Oh wait, maybe, hold on

42:49.520 --> 42:51.520
I got it

42:51.520 --> 42:53.520
I got it

42:53.520 --> 42:55.520
I got it

42:55.520 --> 42:57.520
Fuck, how do I go back

42:57.520 --> 42:59.520
The snow bears

42:59.520 --> 43:01.520
They've got a big head

43:03.520 --> 43:05.520
Wow

43:05.520 --> 43:07.520
I've drawn them too

43:09.520 --> 43:11.520
This is so fucking good

43:11.520 --> 43:13.520
Let's fucking go

43:15.520 --> 43:17.520
I'm trying so hard right now

43:17.520 --> 43:19.520
I can't even think of anything to say

43:23.520 --> 43:25.520
Oh my gosh

43:25.520 --> 43:27.520
Imagination

43:37.520 --> 43:39.520
There you go

43:39.520 --> 43:41.520
Look at you all

43:41.520 --> 43:43.520
I'm so proud of you

43:51.520 --> 43:53.520
Your laugh is so cute

43:53.520 --> 43:55.520
Thank you

43:55.520 --> 43:57.520
I love you so much

44:01.520 --> 44:03.520
I just think I did mine really well

44:05.520 --> 44:07.520
Yeah, it's a water bottle

44:13.520 --> 44:15.520
That's the best I got

44:15.520 --> 44:17.520
I saved the pair of ball sacks

44:23.520 --> 44:25.520
Did you make it into a dog or something?

44:25.520 --> 44:27.520
No

44:27.520 --> 44:29.520
It just works

44:29.520 --> 44:31.520
Can you

44:31.520 --> 44:33.520
Tenpais, can you do better? Shut the fuck up

44:35.520 --> 44:37.520
I love when you do that

44:37.520 --> 44:39.520
Shut the fuck up

44:39.520 --> 44:41.520
Oh my god

44:43.520 --> 44:45.520
What is this?

44:45.520 --> 44:47.520
Wow

44:49.520 --> 44:51.520
You're asking me not to draw a vagina with those

44:51.520 --> 44:53.520
Oh my god

44:53.520 --> 44:55.520
What do I do?

44:55.520 --> 44:57.520
How am I supposed to do with this?

44:59.520 --> 45:01.520
How am I supposed to do this?

45:01.520 --> 45:03.520
How do I save this?

45:13.520 --> 45:15.520
I need to do this all for memory

45:17.520 --> 45:19.520
I won't draw that

45:19.520 --> 45:21.520
Oh my god

45:21.520 --> 45:23.520
I just realized

45:23.520 --> 45:25.520
I'll draw this instead

45:35.520 --> 45:37.520
You thought women were less immature than men?

45:37.520 --> 45:39.520
You're wrong

45:43.520 --> 45:45.520
I wasn't going to draw a coochie

45:45.520 --> 45:47.520
or a woman giving birth

45:47.520 --> 45:49.520
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

45:49.520 --> 45:51.520
I literally don't know what the fuck

45:51.520 --> 45:53.520
I'm doing right now

45:53.520 --> 45:55.520
Wait hold on

45:55.520 --> 45:57.520
Oh my god

45:57.520 --> 45:59.520
I have time

45:59.520 --> 46:01.520
Can you guess who it is now?

46:03.520 --> 46:05.520
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

46:05.520 --> 46:07.520
Fuck

46:07.520 --> 46:09.520
Fuck

Be like ones

46:19.520 --> 46:21.520
Pen pals

46:21.520 --> 46:23.520
Pen pals

46:23.520 --> 46:25.520
Quick quick quick quick

46:25.520 --> 46:27.520
I'm running out of time

46:29.520 --> 46:31.520
Oh my god

46:31.520 --> 46:33.520
This is okay

46:33.520 --> 46:35.520

46:59.520 --> 47:01.520
Oh god

Reflex how could I forget your fucking

47:03.520 --> 47:05.520

I saved it

47:07.520 --> 47:09.520
I saved it

47:09.520 --> 47:11.520
I think I did a good job

47:11.520 --> 47:13.520
This is the best I got I ain't got none other than me

47:19.520 --> 47:21.520
Why do I feel like

47:21.520 --> 47:23.520
This is really bad this happened

47:23.520 --> 47:25.520
This is a really specific reference

47:25.520 --> 47:27.520
And I don't know if anyone can

47:27.520 --> 47:29.520
I get it but

47:29.520 --> 47:31.520
There used to be a flash game

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520
Where your guy was on like a snowboard

47:33.520 --> 47:35.520
I love that game

47:35.520 --> 47:37.520
I know what you're talking about

47:37.520 --> 47:39.520
Someone literally just drawn that

47:39.520 --> 47:41.520
Literally this is perfect

47:47.520 --> 47:49.520
That's it that's my drawing

47:51.520 --> 47:53.520
Someone says lane rider

47:53.520 --> 47:55.520
Oh is that what it's called?

48:01.520 --> 48:03.520
What

What is bear pants

48:07.520 --> 48:09.520
Oh

48:09.520 --> 48:11.520
Is it panties

48:15.520 --> 48:17.520
I was so confused

48:17.520 --> 48:19.520
I saw people were asking me to draw

48:19.520 --> 48:21.520
Bear wearing underwear

48:21.520 --> 48:23.520
I was like what the fuck is wrong with you guys

48:23.520 --> 48:25.520
Newsy pants

48:25.520 --> 48:27.520
I remember fancy pants

48:27.520 --> 48:29.520

48:29.520 --> 48:31.520
Pants that were

48:31.520 --> 48:33.520
Fence

48:33.520 --> 48:35.520
Why not

48:35.520 --> 48:37.520
And now is not the time

48:37.520 --> 48:39.520
To pop a bomb in my lap

48:39.520 --> 48:41.520
Cause he blundered at me though

48:41.520 --> 48:43.520
You know the story

48:45.520 --> 48:47.520
I might make that up

48:51.520 --> 48:53.520
Right hydration check

48:53.520 --> 48:55.520
Girlies I don't want your boyfriend dying

48:55.520 --> 48:57.520
Okay

48:57.520 --> 48:59.520
You know the story

48:59.520 --> 49:01.520
Some water

49:03.520 --> 49:05.520
Pants

49:07.520 --> 49:09.520
He's guggling my balls sorry

49:09.520 --> 49:11.520
He had no hair color but his pants were yellow

49:11.520 --> 49:13.520
Let me do that for you

49:13.520 --> 49:15.520
Do you have a beard? I don't know

49:15.520 --> 49:17.520

49:19.520 --> 49:21.520
Needs hip

49:21.520 --> 49:23.520
Yeah you're right I don't really know how to do that though

49:25.520 --> 49:27.520
Can I zoom in

49:27.520 --> 49:29.520
No

49:29.520 --> 49:31.520
Yeah

49:33.520 --> 49:35.520
It's like a beer braid

49:35.520 --> 49:37.520
Braid is pants though

49:37.520 --> 49:39.520
Stop

49:41.520 --> 49:43.520
Yeah

49:43.520 --> 49:45.520
No fuck I didn't mean to add that

49:45.520 --> 49:47.520
Who drew ball sacks everywhere

49:49.520 --> 49:51.520
It's not you sheebie

49:51.520 --> 49:53.520

50:03.520 --> 50:05.520
What

50:05.520 --> 50:07.520
Who's whispering

50:07.520 --> 50:09.520
Zura's whispering some like

50:09.520 --> 50:11.520
Evil incantations to us

50:15.520 --> 50:17.520
See it's great

50:19.520 --> 50:21.520
It was definitely a Zura that drew the ball sack 100%

50:25.520 --> 50:27.520
I feel like this is a lie

50:27.520 --> 50:29.520
No I didn't draw it

50:29.520 --> 50:31.520
I'm really drawing over it right now

50:31.520 --> 50:33.520
If you guys didn't know

50:33.520 --> 50:35.520
Zura's ears actually have golden

50:35.520 --> 50:37.520
Little jewelry on the end of them

50:37.520 --> 50:39.520
Oh

50:39.520 --> 50:41.520
This is icy

50:41.520 --> 50:43.520
Pimped out with jewelry but it's like

50:43.520 --> 50:45.520
Not about anything

50:45.520 --> 50:47.520
Here you go

50:47.520 --> 50:49.520
Going for her first bike ride

50:49.520 --> 50:51.520

50:51.520 --> 50:53.520
Isn't cheating to a race? Ah fuck it is

50:53.520 --> 50:55.520
Okay

50:55.520 --> 50:57.520
Isn't it cute

50:57.520 --> 50:59.520
So if you didn't know

51:09.520 --> 51:11.520
Oji-san is so happy for her

51:13.520 --> 51:15.520
I know this isn't a Zura

51:15.520 --> 51:17.520
It's cold

51:17.520 --> 51:19.520
That looks terrible get rid of that

51:19.520 --> 51:21.520
Oh my god you can't just control Z

51:21.520 --> 51:23.520
What's wrong with my life

51:23.520 --> 51:25.520
I was trying to talk about lactation

51:25.520 --> 51:27.520
Duh

51:29.520 --> 51:31.520
This is yeah it was right before she said

51:31.520 --> 51:33.520
Chocolate that was correct

51:33.520 --> 51:35.520
Milk

51:35.520 --> 51:37.520
Milk

51:45.520 --> 51:47.520
So painful

51:47.520 --> 51:49.520
That's the timer

51:49.520 --> 51:51.520

51:57.520 --> 51:59.520

I can't see

52:03.520 --> 52:05.520
I have saved

52:05.520 --> 52:07.520
I have single handedly saved the stream probably

52:07.520 --> 52:09.520
We'll do that

52:09.520 --> 52:11.520
This is supposed to be the liquid

52:11.520 --> 52:13.520
The liquid

52:13.520 --> 52:15.520
Wait I just know I have to draw my own drawing

52:15.520 --> 52:17.520
But that's cheating

52:17.520 --> 52:19.520
I know what I wanted to draw

52:19.520 --> 52:21.520
That's nothing

52:23.520 --> 52:25.520
Fine

52:25.520 --> 52:27.520
I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing

52:27.520 --> 52:29.520
Fine

52:29.520 --> 52:31.520
I started it and I'm gonna finish it

52:31.520 --> 52:33.520
It's me

52:33.520 --> 52:35.520
Fucking mental

52:41.520 --> 52:43.520
I don't know

52:43.520 --> 52:45.520
I'm already pissed

52:53.520 --> 52:55.520
It's the odd

52:55.520 --> 52:57.520
Okay

52:57.520 --> 52:59.520
Okay

52:59.520 --> 53:01.520
Okay

53:01.520 --> 53:03.520
I would talk

53:03.520 --> 53:05.520
But it takes too much brain power

53:05.520 --> 53:07.520
To do this

53:13.520 --> 53:15.520
I don't know

53:23.520 --> 53:25.520
My cats are fighting

53:25.520 --> 53:27.520
Stop

53:33.520 --> 53:35.520

53:39.520 --> 53:41.520
I don't know

53:41.520 --> 53:43.520

53:45.520 --> 53:47.520

Knock off is fun

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.520
Because it's like super

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.520

Because you make it pretty drawing and then

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.520
It becomes hell

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.520
On the spot

You want me to draw that

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.520
Oh this is terrible on a mouse

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.520
That one's actually funny

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.520
How much time do we have

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.520
Can I draw the whole gang again

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.520
I'll make sure

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.520
You have quite a bit of time with this one

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.520
Okay hold on

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.520
What the fuck is going on

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.520
Oh that's not how you draw the whole gang

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.520
Oh no

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.520
Oh

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.520
Sitting down oh my god I'm having a stroke

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.520

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.520

I'm supposed to be a snow fairy

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.520
I'm going to get beaten up by AC

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.520
After this oh my god

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.520
Oh my god what what

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.520
I want to draw harmony I want to draw unity

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.520
Perfect

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.520
I can't draw like this

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520
Wait it has kind of like

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.520
Who's next

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.520
We need to draw the devilish

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.520
Fuck this is hard cause like

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.520
I don't know what to fucking draw

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.520
Get creative nerds

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.520
Geez it's not that

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.520
It's not that hard you can do

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.520
Okay Miss Artist

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.520
Okay

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.520
Eventually

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.520
Amy's like I'm just going to draw myself casual

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.520
And it comes out with like this fucking

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.520
Banger of a commission

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.520
It would probably cost like 500 dollars to do

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.520
And she like bangs it out

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.520
And I'm like oh my god

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.520
I'm going to make a vtuber model

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.520
He he

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.520
Wish I could

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.520
Wish I had a finger

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.520
Nerval talent

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.520
Speaking of that

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.520
They were like thank you for not

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.520
Tying down your talents

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.520
To the designs that you assign them

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.520
And they can be more themselves and I'm like

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.520
Yeah well why would I do that

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.520
I was like

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.520
I don't know why I feel like it's such a basic things

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.520
What the fuck do I need to draw next

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.520
A bleeding heart

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.520
Yeah we're more like

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.520
Building upon the characters

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.520
Rather than

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.520
Changing everything

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.520
Cause um

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.520
Right at the vtuber

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.520
They were like the only thing that would have been better

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.520
Is if you let them design

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.520
Their models like from the start

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.520
I'm like bro it took me a fucking year to get here

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.520
Like oh my god give me like a fucking

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.520
It takes forever

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.520
To

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.520
Draw and rig a vtuber model

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.520
Yeah

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.520
You can ask Amy she knows how to

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.520
She knows how to do it

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.520
It's a lot of work

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Oh my god

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.520
Yeah there's only a select few corpos that will

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.520
Let you do that

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.520
Oh shit

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.520
Man this is rough

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.520
Usually ones that have like artists in house as well

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.520
Ahh

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.520
Yeah we don't

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.520
This is so bad

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.520
Most companies

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.520
If not all of them

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.520
Say for you

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.520
Will have pre

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.520
Pre-made

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.520
Pre-made

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.520
It's actually standard for people to choose

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.520
Yeah it's really not

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.520
You

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.520
That's why it's usually they cast for the roles

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.520
You have to fit the

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.520
Character they're looking for

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.520
Oh oh oh

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.520
It's magic

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.520
Oh oh

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.520
It's magic

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.520
You know

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.520
Oh

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.960
What is this

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.880
Are we ready? Yeah, I'm ready

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.800
Just draw it your way. Yeah, that's the fun part. Yeah

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.880
I've already forgot which position

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.040
Oh

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.000
Sorry, we flinch honestly, I would talk more but this takes so much brainpower to do

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:29.360
Reading chat I'm reading everything, but I'm not responding. I'm so sorry because we everyone's

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.400
I'm just really in this

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.520
Fucking losing it. Oh

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.680
My god, wait

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.440
That's far too short, so this is why it's chaotic

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.440
Oh my god

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.520
Okay

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.160
Oh sure, there's like a lot of time we draw this as fast as we can

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Can't remember what it looks like

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.080
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way, cuz I don't think I saw it

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.800
supposed to be a person in it, I don't know

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Oh, it's already have

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.520
Oh

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.440
My god

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.520
Okay, okay, okay, we can do this

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.840
Do this, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's go. Don't panic

01:10:44.840 --> 01:11:11.080
Okay, this is easy. This is easy. This has to be men's this has to be men's

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.840
Fucking go

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360
Man this looks like shit

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.840
Oh

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.280
At least it stayed a cat

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.240
Oh

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.020
Oh they're cute!

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:35.820
It's no face

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.900
Oh we're argued in real time

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.360
Like egg and faces

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.080
At the end of the day, or I'll just stick ring here

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.220
Okay, this is good this stage

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.240
Oh

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.840
She's not in jail she's

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.240
There

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.800
Peace

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.240
Oh

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.880
Shooting her

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.240
Oh

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.920
What have we not done

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.200
All the actions are mystery drawing and sentences are hitting during the game

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.240
I've never done that one before

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:57.480
Okay, we'll try we're doing secret right last room boys last room. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.640
Oh, shit. Oh what I can't see what I'm writing

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.680
How do I just know what I'm writing?

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.160
Wait what?

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.040
Huh

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:16.760
Yeah, oh no, wait you run it with freaking words. Oh bro. I can't erase my

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560
I don't know

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.800
It just appears. Oh, we can't see what we're drawing

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960
Okay, we'll drop out

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.520
Okay

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.360
Okay, I don't know I think

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.320
I'm gonna just guess

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.600
What it is where it is

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.520
What the fuck?

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.720
I'm taking a shot in the dark

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560

Someone had a stroke whoever drew this one. Hope you're feeling okay. Hope you didn't all right make sure you hydrate

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.120

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.360

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.360
I don't know who to raid

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.880

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.200

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:51.080
But I wanted to redirect into someone but I don't know who

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.640
Strony's pissed and oh

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:05.160
Is mercy still going okay, I'll redirect into strony because I know that strony will

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.720
stream

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.640
I don't know who's ending, but I know I am

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:18.200
I had so much the fun. Thank you for the peeler stream. You're welcome. I had fun too

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:22.280
I know I didn't know that I was ginger

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:26.600
Didn't know that I was ginger. I thought I was blonde

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.240
Maybe I'll make myself more ginger because

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:37.640
I really thought I was just like a really really bright blonde and I was wondering like why is my hair so

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.160
Like bright blonde. It's because I'm fucking ginger. What the fuck?

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.440
And every time I was drawing myself. I was drawing myself as like a blonde blonde

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.240
Because I thought I was supposed to be blonde

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.680
I'm ginger

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.560
Well

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.520
Yeah, it all makes sense now

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.000
I probably might change my emo design to look more ginger

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.480
Because like ginger people have like reddish hair, don't they?

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.640
Strawberry blood. No, no

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.160
No, so

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:21.720
It does make sense. I still love you even though you're ginger. Thank you

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.160
I still love you too

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.160
Even though you're dead

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.000
Okay, uh, let me let me

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.960
Fuck that's what I wanted. Did I I need to I need to add the redirect

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:44.680
Reddish orange. Yeah, like ginger people have like reddish orange hair

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:52.360
And mine looks really blonde to be ginger. Not shitting on the model artist or anything

01:31:52.360 --> 01:32:00.360
Next time look at ginger people though. I know it's hard to look at them because they're so fucking pale, but like

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.560
Use your references

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.360
You saw me using all my references

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.880
During this game. Um, oh, oh Zeriz playing Sturge Valley though

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.240
Ginger the whole time

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.600
Yeah, it does look really blonde. That's what I'm saying

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:24.760
Um

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:32.120
Right, I'll redirect into Azura. Yeah

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.560
Okay, there we go

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.520
So

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.160
I didn't realize so that that's what I yeah, I didn't realize

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.480
Ginger's scary you good. You should be scared of me. I'm scary

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.200
girl

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.200
You're pissing your pants yet

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.760
Yeah, it explains the freckles, but you know

01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:04.440
Not not only ginger people have freckles, so I wasn't sure

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:09.720
Um, but yeah, I'll stream tomorrow. I'll start stream around, uh, 12

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:23.640
I don't know how long I'll go probably not too long. Um, we'll see. We'll see

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.720
You're not you're not scary. You're an adorable ginger

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:38.040
I'm glad I'm glad you think I'm cute. I sound so fucking gross and snotty right now

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.000
It's because my voice has gone from screaming and laughing

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.600
Right

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:51.560
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Um, really early in the day. You better be there or else I'm gonna cry. Um

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.520
Um, yeah

01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:59.640
See you later
