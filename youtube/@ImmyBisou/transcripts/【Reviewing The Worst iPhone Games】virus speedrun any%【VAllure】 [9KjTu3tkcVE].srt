1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
oh

3
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
me

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hello? Hello? Hi! Time for a normal YouTube stream! How's the mic? Is it okay? I actually didn't- I didn't test it. Hold on, let me test it. Is it okay? It sounds good. You're not lying!

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay. Okay. I ordered a new wire, but for now I'll have to use my drawing tablet wire.

7
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I've completely given up on using straws to make my tracking not, you know, make it look like I'm drinking. She doesn't ever believe we're telling the truth, because you guys don't know, like, I don't know how to explain it, like, you guys don't know what I consider, like, messed up mic, I guess? Why is my mouth tracking kinda shit too?

8
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You guys don't know what I consider messed up mic, so like, that's why I don't always trust- oh, and there goes- there goes my entire tracking, hello? That's why I don't always, um, trust you. You know? Sorry.

9
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Am I here? Am I alive? Okay. I don't even know if I would consider myself a perfectionist because, like, I don't know what, um, I don't know what is good. I just know what I'm trying to aim for, you know? Maybe you don't know.

10
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, too many yes men. Say no. Tell me my mic looks like- tell me my mic sounds like shit. Tell me it sounds like I'm using an Xbox mic. That's what I want you to say. Okay?

11
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay. Anyways, hold on.

12
00:04:43,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Alright, so today we're gonna be reviewing shitty iPhone games. It's technically a lie where we're reviewing shitty, um, iPad games. We're gonna be iPad kids today together.

13
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Um, Blue Yeti mic. I'm actually not using a Blue Yeti. I'm using a HyperX Quadcast mic.

14
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Um, I do got games on my phone and I'll show you. I'll show you my games on my phone. It's sorta quiet, to be honest. Oh my god.

15
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now you're- now you- now the brain worms are starting. It shouldn't be quiet. Hold on. Let's start recording. Testing, testing. One, two, three. AHHHHHHH! Okay.

16
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now you're gonna listen to that with me.

17
00:05:41,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Honestly, I couldn't tell. I have to use different headphones, I feel like. Whatever. It's fine. It's fine. Tell me it's fine.

18
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Um, did you get mom's iPad? Yeah. I found a bunch of shitty games to play and I downloaded them on mom's iPad.

19
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How old should you be to start being a burner? What's a burner? Quieter than usual, not quiet per se.

20
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Whatever, it's okay. Um, I- I- I- I- For now it's fine. Oh, Reefling Raid! Hi, Reeflings! Welcome! How are you guys doing? Momerate.

21
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You guys were playing- you were playing Overwatch? Pop, pop, pop, get raided, hi! Hello! Welcome! Wow, it's short? Only four hours? That's crazy.

22
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's crazy. Mom- Mom, are you tired today? Only four hours? Okay. Oh, Overwatch was yesterday? Damn. Okay. I called- I told them that I called that your short would get popular and it did.

23
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You did call that my short would get popular, but I didn't expect it to get popular because, like, I don't know, I made other shorts similar to that and it never got popular. But this time it did! I don't know, six times- six times the charm.

24
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But it didn't really get popular amongst the VTuber watchers as I can tell in chat. First Tuber- First Tuber I'm watching didn't get popular amongst the VTuber watchers, kind of got popular amongst the normies that don't really know what VTubers are and are, like, you know, questioning everything about me and my existence and why I exist.

25
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, the real voice one. Yeah, you know normies, it's okay as long as they're being respectful, which a lot aren't, but some are. I'll try to educate the respectful ones.

26
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Um, right, hold on. So, okay, this is gonna be a little bit scuffy. I don't think I'll get a virus because, you know, doesn't Apple, like, test their apps? I would hope so.

27
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I would hope Apple test their apps. I don't know, maybe they don't, and maybe I will get a virus, we'll see. But I got them all from the app store, so I'm hoping it'll be okay.

28
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm hoping it'll be okay. Now, yeah, this is gonna be a little scuffed because I wanted to mirror my iPad screen, but because I didn't plan ahead, I couldn't use my capture card because I didn't have the right dongle.

29
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I didn't buy the right dongle ahead of time. So, my last, um, my last, I guess, line of, my plan Z is to just call myself on Discord and share my screen that way.

30
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Apple compliance is pretty strict when it comes to stuff that can access camera, payment info, etc. Well, I hope, uh, I put tape on my camera, so hopefully you shouldn't see me, but I don't know what else you might see.

31
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, hold on, let me go to the gaming screen.

32
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, someone keeps asking, how old should you be to start tubing? You can be any age, as long as you're older than 13, because most sites have a limit of 13. But if you're 13, don't watch this stream, go away, child.

33
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Just because we're playing children's games does not mean we want the children here with us. Okay, let me call myself on Discord. One second, um, call.

34
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Wait, I already have a friend request. What?

35
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Call.

36
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Friend request failed. Oh, I'm such a fucking idiot. I put my, I put my iPad on airplane mode, and I was wondering, why isn't the call going through? Why is the call feeling? It's because you have no fucking Wi-Fi, you idiot.

37
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, hold on, let me try something.

38
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay.

39
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sorry, I'm being a noob right now, give me a second.

40
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay.

41
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Make me join call. Oh.

42
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, there we go. I had to mute both of myself.

43
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Share your screen. Oh wait, no, not that screen. The iPad screen.

44
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Share your screen. Start broadcast.

45
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm getting there, I'm getting there, give me a second, give me a second.

46
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's not because I'm lonely, it's because I'm trying to show you my iPad screen.

47
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay, let's make that full screen. Okay, so let me show you the games that I have today. Now the quality's ass, um, but you know, it was either this or Zatsu, and this is basically a Zatsu anyway, so this is just like a more fun version of a Zatsu basically.

48
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And there goes my face again. Ah!

49
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh.

50
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Huh?

51
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh no.

52
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Guys, I'm frozen!

53
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What happened?

54
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you for becoming a member. Give me a second.

55
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm almost there, okay? Everything was working when I started stream. There we go, okay.

56
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, let me show you the fucking games that we have today. Sorry, I'm in a really shitty position on my desk, so it's kind of hard for me to, um, to do this.

57
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So, um, let me go full screen. Okay, can I go fuller screen than this?

58
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Probably not.

59
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, maybe I can. Sorry, I'm a little bit of a noob.

60
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Um, there we go, okay. And this is the iPad.

61
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you like my 1080p quality here? Hold on.

62
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Let me, um, I have to show you the full screen, don't I? Excuse my 129 discord message.

63
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay, there we go.

64
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There we are. Right, so the apps that we have today are pregnancy simulator, baby in yellow, I don't know what that means.

65
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Uh, fart world? Jerry mouse rat? I just looked up like rat simulator.

66
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Um, the next one is called like makeover makeup ASMR. It's like one of those gross, um, like makeover games.

67
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And then we have like a doctor simulator. We have granny evil nun, and we have an AI girlfriend.

68
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So as you can see, we have a lot of great, um, great options today.

69
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
John this baby. I don't think that's what it's supposed to be.

70
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know, let's, let's, let's jump right into it.

71
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Um, so this was called pregnant pregnancy simulator.

72
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So we're going to pretend that the condom broke today.

73
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now this one looks especially bad quality because it is especially bad quality.

74
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like even on my iPad, it's like really, I mean, they're all shitty quality games. It doesn't matter.

75
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Granny evil is rough. Is it child support? You're going to have to start being child support.

76
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay, play. So I guess we have to like unlock, I don't know why the last one says that.

77
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I guess we have to unlock the, the various levels of, of pregnancy life.

78
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And the first one is chapter one, a new journey of life is starting soon where we'll have less sleep,

79
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
but more happiness because a little member is joining us soon. You guessed it right. I'm pregnant.

80
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm the mother. I'm the mother. What do you mean? And you're the father.

81
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, we'll probably get a lot of ads. That's okay though. As long as the ads don't fucking dox me.

82
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll have, I'll have my mouse ready. Okay.

83
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Um, so I can't look around. I can only just move around, but I can't look where I'm going.

84
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So I guess we're going to the reception desk.

85
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Um, should I, should I show you the audio of the game?

86
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Can you hear any audio?

87
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know if the game has audio to be honest. It's very possible it doesn't. I don't know.

88
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Now, should I let you hear the audio and I'll show you the audio? This looks bad, but better than I expected. It just looks bad.

89
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Madam, how can I help you?

90
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh no. I'm having nausea, fatigue, vomiting for the last three days. Oh, I guess my name is Amanda.

91
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Take your slip and go to the radiology table for ultrasound, then visit the gynecologist with your reports.

92
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Okay. Don't call me Amy. I'm Amanda now.

93
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, now I can look around. Okay. Okay.

94
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay. Where's my file? Oh, thank you, ma'am.

95
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, oh, did I pass the level already?

96
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Wait, what? Thank you for the 20 gems.

97
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, okay. We're here for our, our, our, uh, oh, can I walk around here?

98
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Wow. I like how this one is cropped badly.

99
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Amanda, you got 13% pregnant from doing that. Wait, what do you mean? 13%? Did you see a percentage around here?

100
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I like how I can like click the button on the right to just watch an ad, I'm guessing.

101
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What is the date, patient form? I didn't fill out my form.

102
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Work injury, work injury. People work injury twice.

103
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Accident other. Did this problem require surgery? No, yes, yes.

104
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They put multiple options twice. Date of surgery, signature date. Okay.

105
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, can I like play with this stuff? I'm guessing no.

106
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I like to do this at doctor's offices. I'm not going to lie.

107
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I haven't been to many doctor's offices, but I like to snoop around while I'm waiting for them because they make you wait like fucking 20 minutes for them.

108
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Sometimes more, you know, so I just snoop around.

109
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, the report system.

110
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, can I, can I steal some coffee, confidential patient information here?

111
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No.

112
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Do they make you play this after getting pregnant?

113
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No. Okay, let's sit down. Hi, I'm pregnant. Here's my ultrasound slip. Give me an ultrasound.

114
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Please lay down straight on the bed, on bed.

115
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You ever take things from the drawers? No, of course not. No, I don't. Do you?

116
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not a big chair. It kind of just looks like a... Oh, okay.

117
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
She forced me onto the table. Oh my.

118
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Alright, she's... Don't I have to lift my shirt for this kind of stuff?

119
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Is that it? That was fast.

120
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay, I look a little bit disgruntled.

121
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You have to wait 20 minutes. I'm Canadian, so it's more like one to two hours.

122
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I mean, I'm Canadian too.

123
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But no, usually when you go, they'll like make you wait in the waiting room and then they'll put you in a room and they'll make you wait again.

124
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But usually I... Oh, now I'm 26% pregnant.

125
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Usually there's always a little bit of a wait. I guess it depends on the...

126
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I just got an ad.

127
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I live with my parents and I got $0 and my dad wants to kick me out, so tell me, what would you do?

128
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Can I... No, I don't want...

129
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Bit life. I've played bit life before, actually.

130
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We're 26% preggers!

131
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And it's all your fault you made me this way.

132
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay, I'm done here. I don't want to download bit life.

133
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It won't let me leave the ad.

134
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Hello?

135
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Wait, I can't leave the ad.

136
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I can't leave the ad at all.

137
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Come on! Let me try restarting the game.

138
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But then I'll have to do the whole thing again, won't I?

139
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Do you think it saves progress in this shitty game?

140
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Play.

141
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We have to start all over again.

142
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Man!

143
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They wouldn't let me leave the ad.

144
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, you're 26% the father.

145
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, did it... Did it save my progress? I think it did.

146
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Okay. Oh, I have a new patient form now.

147
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Alright, no, I just have a green paper now.

148
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay, okay, okay.

149
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We're gonna get more pregnant now.

150
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, now we're in the gynecology room.

151
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Ooh, where's all the pictures of pussies?

152
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Excuse me.

153
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
There's not really much.

154
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Every picture is like super low res.

155
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh, wow.

156
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Natural ways to lower uric acid levels.

157
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Okay, cool.

158
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Oh, he looks concerned.

159
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Just waited until I find the other 74%.

160
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Hi, doctor.

161
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What happened, young lady?

162
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I got pregnant, doctor.

163
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm having nausea, fatigue, and vomiting since last three days.

164
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Do you have your ultrasound report?

165
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes, here it is.

166
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay, let me check your reports first.

167
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Congratulations, you're pregnant.

168
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He does look like he's seen some terrible stuff.

169
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Really? Thank you so much, doctor.

170
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This is your diet plan.

171
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Follow it, and you should come for regular...

172
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Diet? I'm on a diet because I'm pregnant?

173
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't want to take your stupid diet.

174
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, I'm pregnant.

175
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That would be $400.

176
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, no, they don't immediately do an ultrasound.

177
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They'll probably just tell you to go home and take a pregnancy test at home.

178
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Let's go!

179
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Pregnancy acquired, 38%.

180
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Please don't make me watch another ad.

181
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay, I'm home now.

182
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh, wow, I have a really nice house.

183
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I guess I can afford to be happy that I'm pregnant.

184
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Go to your bedroom and hang the car keys on the key holder.

185
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Wow, look at my house, dude.

186
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Holy shit.

187
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Wow, I live in a nice neighborhood.

188
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Holy crap.

189
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Can anyone identify where this house is from?

190
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm learning so much.

191
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I know, wow.

192
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Is this what it's like to be pregnant?

193
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh, shit, I'm on the...

194
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oops, okay.

195
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Is this what it's like to really be pregnant?

196
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Excuse me.

197
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Why is my TV so small?

198
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay, sorry.

199
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Do I have to go to the father of my child and tell him?

200
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Wait, go to the bedroom, hang the car keys on the key holder.

201
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Which one is the key holder?

202
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh, look, I got an iPad.

203
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Whoa, what's that?

204
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Wow, I'm a healthy person, huh?

205
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Where's the key holder?

206
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Folic acid.

207
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Where is my key holder?

208
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Do any of you see she looked at it?

209
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Where is the key holder?

210
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Which one is the key holder?

211
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, psh.

212
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
There we go.

213
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I got it, I got it, I got it.

214
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay, now place the bag on the table.

215
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This table?

216
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This table, right?

217
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Or no, probably this table.

218
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I just want to tell my husband that I'm pregnant.

219
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh, there it is.

220
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Hello?

221
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Hello?

222
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Okay.

223
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The game isn't gaming, okay, I'm struggling.

224
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The baby took my eyesight.

225
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's true.

226
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't think that's true, but there's a lot of fucked up shit that happens when you get pregnant.

227
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm destined to be the best player of all time.

228
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So if that means I have to start with the worst team in the league, I'm going to do it.

229
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The Memphis Honey Bay, huh?

230
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Alright, let's try out as a shooting guard.

231
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Can I shut it up?

232
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Okay, there we go, sorry.

233
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay, please.

234
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
BitLife again?

235
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Please let me exit out.

236
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Please let me exit out of the game.

237
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
BitLife, you're making me hate you right now.

238
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
No, I don't want to download BitLife.

239
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Okay.

240
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Am I in the third stage of pregnancy?

241
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Pick up the phone and call your husband.

242
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm pregnant!

243
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
She looks so mad.

244
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
As with it, as with it, as.

245
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I have been trying to impress the ex, but sometimes it doesn't work.

246
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Hello?

247
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
David?

248
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Hi honey, everything alright?

249
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I have news.

250
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I am pregnant, carrying a little life in my womb.

251
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Like, seriously?

252
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You're expecting her first child?

253
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes!

254
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
She doesn't look happy at all.

255
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

256
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Honey, I'm coming home.

257
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
See you soon.

258
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Am I going to go have sex with David now?

259
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm just merging in with the bed.

260
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Enjoying pregnant moms?

261
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
No, I'm not.

262
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm not.

263
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm not.

264
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm not.

265
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Enjoying pregnant mom?

266
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Not now.

267
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I swear if I get another ad.

269
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh my god.

270
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't want to play solitaire.

271
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I actually don't even know how to play solitaire.

272
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, some ads have a fake ex.

273
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I have to press X three times.

274
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Leave me alone.

275
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay.

276
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh!

277
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh no, now we have like the pregnancy symptoms.

278
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Chapter two.

279
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No, this is not a sponsored stream.

280
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Buttering the bun in the oven.

281
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Ew!

282
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Ew!

283
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ew!

284
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That's such a gross way to put it.

285
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Ew, don't say that.

286
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's really gross.

287
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Holy shit, it's David.

288
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Have you visited a gynecologist?

289
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
His face looks so real.

290
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, and everything is fine.

291
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The doctor prescribed me some medicines.

292
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm so happy.

293
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Soon we will have a little one in our home.

294
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Same here.

295
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I should go now.

296
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I have to arrange eggs and other stuff in the kitchen.

297
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
The most realistic husband and wife conversation.

298
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
No, no, you just stay here and get some rest.

299
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll do that. Why is he so stiff?

300
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Thank you.

301
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What a nice husband.

302
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I have to arrange the eggs.

303
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Am I playing as the husband now?

304
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Few things in the kitchen needs attention.

305
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Okay.

306
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Where am I?

307
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I thought I was playing as the husband now.

308
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay, whatever.

309
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't know why he's standing so stiff.

310
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Maybe he's just super excited.

311
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Okay, we have to arrange the eggs.

312
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Apparently.

313
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It is crucial that we rearrange the eggs

314
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
before the baby comes here.

315
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because the baby is going to be checking the fridge

316
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to make sure our eggs are arranged.

317
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm guessing another ad is going to appear.

318
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I should just play the games that I'm advertising.

319
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
This looks like supermarket simulator.

320
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Is this supermarket simulator?

321
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Who took those eggs out of the carton and just left them there?

322
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Is there a ghost in this house?

323
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It must have been David.

324
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What a slop.

325
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm not playing supermarket simulator.

326
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Leave me alone.

327
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Leave me alone.

328
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Okay.

329
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm playing pregnancy simulator.

330
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, I have to put the tomatoes

331
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
in the vegetable crate.

332
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Because the baby is really...

333
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You know, the baby is going to need

334
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
to have the tomatoes

335
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
in the vegetable crate.

336
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
There's more ad than game.

337
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There kind of is.

338
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh my god!

339
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Okay.

340
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I want to at least finish level two.

341
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And the potatoes.

342
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Who organizes them?

343
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Who organizes their vegetables

344
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
like this?

345
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's like, hello?

346
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Why does each potato

347
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
have a designated potato area?

348
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
This one just doesn't want to go.

349
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay.

350
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Veggies in the crate.

351
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh.

352
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I can claim a pretty pink

353
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
watch.

354
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Thank you

355
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
for becoming a member.

356
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Potatoes should not be out in the light

357
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
anyways. I just keep my potatoes.

358
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm losing that watch.

359
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
They make you watch the ad anyways!

360
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You had the option

361
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
to watch the ad and get the

362
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
watch. Or you could not watch

363
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
the ad and lose the watch.

364
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But they make you watch the ad

365
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
anyways.

366
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
100% pregnancy achieved.

367
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Time to go out to buy milk.

368
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The pregnancy has been

369
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
achieved.

370
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
My job here is done.

371
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm going out for milk, honey.

372
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I

373
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
don't want to play my perfect hotel.

374
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Please leave me alone.

375
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let me finish my pregnancy.

376
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Should I go all the way?

377
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh no!

378
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know why, but my um...

379
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Where do I go?

380
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
My iPhone keeps

381
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
um...

382
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Disconnecting.

383
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's go.

384
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
One second.

385
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Are you sure it's yours?

386
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What do you mean mine?

387
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
My baby?

388
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
What is that supposed to mean?

389
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What do you mean by that?

390
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Of course it's my baby.

391
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh,

392
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
okay. The dishes make

393
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
sense. The dishes make sense.

394
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Put the dirty utensils into the dishwasher

395
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
tray. This is not a utensil.

396
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This is a cup.

397
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Please.

398
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Please, I'm losing my sanity

399
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
here. Hello?

400
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay.

401
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Did we like

402
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
puke in every single

403
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
plate here? Why is it all covered in ketchup?

404
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh my god.

405
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh, and there goes my tracking

406
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
again. What the heck?

407
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I wonder if my phone

408
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
is overheating, maybe.

409
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't know.

410
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Hey, let this be a starting

411
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
point. I'm going to make you a bride.

412
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Also, womp, womp, womp,

413
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
womp, womp, womp.

414
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Thank you for the $100.

415
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Wow.

416
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Thank you.

417
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I mean, if we're

418
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
having a child to get...

419
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh my god.

420
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Look away. Oh my god.

421
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Porn game. Porn game.

422
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Sensitive...

423
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I kind of want to buy that game, actually.

424
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay, wait. Hold on.

425
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm going to get this game so we can play it, maybe.

426
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Hold on.

427
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm installing

428
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
that one. That one looks fun.

429
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But if we're having a child together, then

430
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
we're already married.

431
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
No children before marriage here.

432
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Thank you for becoming a member.

433
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Shibi? Did it look

434
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
like Shibi?

435
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay, it's going to take five minutes to download.

436
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I will become the office queen.

437
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I will fuck every man in the office.

438
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So far, I haven't been

439
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
simulating any pregnancy. Go to your bedroom

440
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and take some...

441
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Please leave me alone.

442
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm just trying to simulate a pregnancy

443
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
right now.

444
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Hey, babe.

445
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You're back. I was looking for you.

446
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Holy shit. Why are my feet

447
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
completely...

448
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
My feet are

449
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
a completely different color than the rest of my body.

450
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay, did we finish?

451
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Okay.

452
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You know what? I'm

453
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
going to try and judge.

454
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Decide their divorcements.

455
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Shy lesbian.

456
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay, wait. I need to play this game too now.

457
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Hold on.

458
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Now I need to download this one.

459
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
This one looks funny.

460
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
This one looks hilarious.

461
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Okay.

462
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm downloading that one too.

463
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay, I've given up on pregnancy simulator.

464
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's just...

465
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's just not for me.

466
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Apparently

467
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
pregnancy simulator is 99%

468
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
doing chores and 10%

469
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
going to the doctor and getting an ultrasound.

470
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I don't know.

471
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You avoided it? I avoided it.

472
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Use adblocker. I'm on an iPad right now.

473
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What adblocker am I supposed to get?

474
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You want me to jailbreak

475
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
my iPad so I can get an adblocker?

476
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And they were roommates.

477
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But yes,

478
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
we've avoided it.

479
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Now I'm going to play baby in yellow.

480
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Please do not track me.

481
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And please do not send me notifications.

482
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Cool.

483
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
What?

484
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Game center.

485
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What?

486
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I have to be part of...

487
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What?

488
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Set up later.

489
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay, it started.

490
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's 90% ads.

491
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
9% chores and 1% doctor.

492
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh my god, we haven't even started the game!

493
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We haven't started the game

494
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and I've already gotten an ad for

495
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
block, block blast.

496
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Can I...

497
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I have to wait until the timer is done.

498
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And now it's making me play block.

499
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I hate baby in yellow.

500
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I already hate this one.

501
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Can I leave?

502
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh my god.

503
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
No, I don't want to get...

504
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay.

505
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Act one.

506
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I hope they'll let me play through the game

507
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
before I get another ad at least.

508
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This is crown child care.

509
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You have one new client.

510
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
What?

511
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Hello, I'd like to book a sitter for my little prince.

512
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's for three nights.

513
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You need to feed him and put him to bed easy peasy.

514
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
His bottle's in the fridge.

515
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The address is apartment 10.

516
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Euclidean towers and the keys under the plant pot?

517
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Take care, thanks.

518
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Is this a horror game?

519
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You know what?

520
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The graphics on this don't look that bad.

521
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Seatop left of screen for objectives.

522
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Find apartment 10.

523
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm guessing this is apartment 10.

524
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hello? Oh wait, this is apartment 6.

525
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Let me in!

526
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I can crouch. You got mail.

527
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Can I take it?

528
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay, sorry, we're looking for apartment 10.

529
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
8?

530
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Damn, someone left their trash out.

531
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Oh, this is apartment 10. Okay, and the keys in here.

532
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You know what? This one doesn't look too bad.

533
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
There's a real PC game version of this?

534
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That's surprising.

535
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It didn't have a lot of reviews from what I remember.

536
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Act one, how dare you abort me, mommy?

537
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The baby in yellow.

538
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Is that, was that all of that?

539
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I guess that was Act one.

540
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Wow.

541
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And we got an ad for Candy Crush.

542
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
How do I get out of Candy Crush?

543
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Done.

544
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I need to blow my nose.

545
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I don't want to play the game.

546
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I don't want to play the games on the ads.

547
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I want to play the games I downloaded.

548
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay.

549
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Night one, the sitter. It's time for bed.

550
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The child. Is that what you think?

551
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Scene two. Wow, that was an entire scene.

552
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This is a fast game.

553
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The graphics are really not that bad at all.

554
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Get bottled from the fridge. Holy fucking shit, dude.

555
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You're gonna get it.

556
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Ew.

557
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Ew.

558
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Ew.

559
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay.

560
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh my god.

561
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Can I like, bonk him against the wall and shit?

562
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay. I'm gonna let you stare at the baby.

563
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm gonna go get some napkins

564
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I have cons for my snotty nose.

565
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm back.

566
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Are you enjoying your time with the baby?

567
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I wonder...

568
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't know why any of these games like don't have...

569
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Like I can't hear any of these games.

570
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't know if it's because I'm in a discord call.

571
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't know.

572
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I hate this baby.

573
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Damn! They have merch!

574
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Alright. Well this baby apparently loves us so I'm just gonna...

575
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Oh! Oh! I'm so sorry!

576
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Um...

577
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Okay, I'll just leave you there.

578
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He's safe on the floor. It's okay.

579
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Instructions in clear? Put the baby in the oven?

580
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Thank you for the two dollars.

581
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Do you want me to try to put the baby in the oven?

582
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I don't even know where the kitchen is.

583
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Where's the fridge?

584
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
This is a... this is a bathroom.

585
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That's a really long ass bathroom.

586
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Oh, here's the kitchen.

587
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Can we put the baby in the oven?

588
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh!

589
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, you're going in there.

590
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Oh, you're getting in there.

591
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh! I'm gonna cook.

592
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's time to cook!

593
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh man! I can't turn the oven on!

594
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Ah!

595
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh my god!

596
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's dead!

597
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Hello?

598
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Can I go in the oven too? No, I can't. I'm too big.

599
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, shit.

600
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I exploded the baby.

601
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh! He's back!

602
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Oh, he's smiling now.

603
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Okay, okay.

604
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Alright, um...

605
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Sorry, I'll try to actually play the game.

606
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't know why he's smiling now, but...

607
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Um, bottle from the fridge.

608
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
There it is.

609
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And then give bottle to baby.

610
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Alright, here you go, baby.

611
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Ahem!

612
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Take baby to changing table.

613
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh, you stinky!

614
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You made a stinky. Can I kill him in other ways?

615
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
He had fun in the oven. Apparently.

616
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
He liked it when I cooked him.

617
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay, that door's locked.

618
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Can we put the baby in the washing machine?

619
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh wait, come back here.

620
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Get in there.

621
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh no! Oh my god!

622
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I can just watch him

623
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
He lived oh

624
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,040
My he's glowing now look how clean you are

625
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
His eyes dude

626
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,880
That was funny. That's funny the key to secrets. Oh, sorry. I don't want to be that close to you

627
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,920
Hold on. Let's close this door. Excuse me here. Can I just put you on the floor for a second? Oh

628
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,280
We got a key this is the water heater

629
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,840
Okay, can I pick up both the baby and the key no

630
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,440
All right fine. I'll just pick up the baby. I'm still kneeling. Sorry. I keep hitting you on the on the door

631
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,400
My apologies. Sorry about that. I uh, I'm not really great with kids

632
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,600
Um, take baby to changing table. Where's the changing table?

633
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,640
What?

634
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
None of these are changing tables

635
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
In me. I'm scared

636
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,640
You're fine. It's just a baby. It's an ugly baby

637
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,800
You like this down to me blowing my nose

638
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:15,400
Um, none of these places have like um

639
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,960
None of these places have a changing table

640
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,280
Can I put them in the toy box and leave them there? Maybe a changing table somewhere else the bathroom

641
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,280
Oh

642
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160

Sorry one second. I want I want to see what's up here. Give me a second

00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,800
Oh, oh, it's really really dark. Sorry. You can't see much

647
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Oh, this is a devil

648
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,480
They worship satan around here

649
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Oh my

650
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,880
Is the baby gonna follow me? Holy crap

651
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,880
This is actually kind of a well-made game

652
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,680
What the heck the painting seems to be incomplete

653
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,440
Huh should I complete the painting?

654
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,440
Oh

655
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,840
Sorry, I got a baby to take care of I I I can't really worry about the satanism going on down here

656
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,680
There we go

657
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,960
Sorry, I left you baby. I'm back for you. No

658
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,400
Sweet painting it is kind of cool, but I got a baby to take care of

659
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,880
Let me down

660
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,880
I

661
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
Pick up baby. All right

662
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,480
Because you're getting stinkier by the second. Um, maybe the changing table is

663
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,800
In the bathroom. Oh, is this a changing table?

664
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,640
Oh, this is a changing table. Oh, I don't know. I always assumed that the changing table would be in the baby's room, right?

665
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,000
Creepy baby stop playing with unknown demons. Oh, he sat up

666
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,840
Great. Okay nappy the nappy was here. I've never

667
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,480
How old is your brain? You know what? I used to play those brain games on the ds

668
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,720
Back in the day and it would tell you like how old your brain was and my brain was always like 35 and I was like 12 years old

669
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,080
I always took a really offense to that

670
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:58,280
Okay, pick up nappy, you know what the amount of ads oh the baby's gone

671
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,080
And the game crashed

672
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,680
The baby's caught in the game crashed

673
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,120
Um, okay, let's try that again

674
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,640
Oh

00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
My god, let's get this shit out of me

676
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
My iPad is haunted now

00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,080
Bit life again, I hate bit life. I officially hate bit life

678
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,080
I'm gonna give the baby up for adoption if you show this to me one more time

679
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,080
I'm not even joking. I want to throw the baby in the ditch

680
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
I

681
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,480
Leave me alone. I just want to play with my yellow baby

00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,040
Let me play with my ugly yellow baby

683
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,680

Man, the babies are so needy. I don't want to do all this. All right, cool the prince and the cat

695
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,920

Uh ai hot cat girl. I don't know what that means. So

699
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,720
There's something wrong with that baby. Is that not obvious?

700
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,000
But this storybook is cute

701
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,600
I hope it's not ai across the shore in distant lands with dark stars overhead

702
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:30,600
Oh, wait. I'm not that fast of a reader. Hold on. They walked through the golden garden gate. Look at the pretty trees

703
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,800
They walked along the pretty pebble path. Look at the colorful flowers

704
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,240
They walked past the fabulous flowing fountain. Look at the dancing water. Look look look

705
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,360
Ew

706
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,240
But the prince didn't like the garden and started kicking down the trees

707
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,000
He dug up flowers, grabbed the hedges and pulled off all the leaves. He ruined everything for fun. The cat watched on

708
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,640
In fear what a mistake. I made the cat cried. I should have never brought him here

709
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,840
Damn

710
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,840

711
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,920

Well, which one's the correct one there's so many

00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,800
Bro, you're being an asshole. This is why I hate babies

00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,840
Okay, even close the door. Okay. Good night

Chill out. Okay, cool

744
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:45,560
Does anything happen if you shake the baby? I've shaken the baby a lot. He'll probably just get shaken baby syndrome

745
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,160

Oh, wow, there's a lot of couples. Okay

768
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,840

769
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,080

There's like an ad at the bottom of my screen already. Hey judge, we want to get married. Oh, we have to decide if they can get married

773
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,680
All right. So santa is 29. She's cold and aggressive and arthur is 25

774
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,680
He's angry and insensitive. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a really good

775
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,240
Uh, that sounds like a really good and non-toxic relationship. So, um

00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,960
Next time it's up to you to decide. It's always up to me to decide. Sounds like most marriages

I'm here to cure your ligma

1080
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,400
This game is so hard to navigate

1081
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,120
Put on oxagon

01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,160

1089
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:41,480
Sorry, yeah, don't worry ma'am. I'm a little snotty today, but it's okay. I washed my hands before the surgery. Just give me a second

1090
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,480
Hold on

1091
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:51,640
Sorry, I let my dog into the operating room. I hope that's okay. I have performance anxiety. So he calms me down

1092
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,800
I made sure to watch his paws, too

1093
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,640
Okay

1094
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,480

Go to ward and check patient health. All right. I'm coming ma'am. I thought we were gonna operate on her

1110
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,720
All we did was inject something into her IV bag

1111
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,920
Come on. Who's telling me what to do in this game? Oh, oh

Excuse me ma'am. Are you a nurse? Why can't I walk anymore?

1118
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,440

Girl, you're fine as hell

1122
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,640
From the front mostly from the side your nose is a little messed up, but it's okay because i'm a surgeon

1123
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,640
I can fix your nose if you want me to

1124
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:49,080
Hey, you're taller than me too. You know what? I've always had a thing for tall women

1125
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,400
Can I get your friend's number? Holy shit. You're ugly. Oh

1126
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,040

1128
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:06,600
Excuse me. I need to check on my patient. How are you feeling?

1129
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,800
I'm feeling well. Wait. I thought you were feeling bad. Okay. Let's take another ct

1130
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,960
Another's ski ct scan

Wait, that man wasn't wearing a hospital uniform

1132
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:27,240
Wait, don't steal my patient. Hold on that guy wasn't wearing a hospital uniform. Where's the ct scanner? Oh, it's right in here

1133
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,800
Oh, wait, no, it's downstairs

1134
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,480
This game is so hard

1135
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:42,360
I had to step away. How many people did emmy kill zero? I literally haven't killed a single person yet

1136
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I'm doing really good as a doctor actually

1137
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,680
Like I I've only been treating one lady so far, but she's still alive

1138
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,720
um somehow

1139
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,400
See she's vibing

1140
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,520
The patient needs skin grafts after all the sick burns emmy's been giving

1141
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:13,320
Okay, hey look my dreamer worked her lung infection is negative now. Ew. What the fuck?

1142

Ew

1144
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,720
You got yourself into this situation. I don't want to I don't want to touch that

1145
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,760
Oh my god, that's literally one of the games I downloaded for today

01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,760
Um, okay, I tell this to doctor

1148
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:58,520
Man, I think doctors should play this game as practice. It's really realistic patient feeling headache. Okay. Let me check him

1149
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:10,680
Oh my god, hey, I heard you're feeling headache

01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:18,360
Doctor I am feeling headache. Okay, you lay on stretcher. I will give you medicine

1151
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,600
Damn I got injected for a headache

1152
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:30,120
All right, don't worry. My injections are top quality. Just spread your legs and your cheeks

1153
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,840
Inject patients. All right, this will cure your headaches, sir

1154
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,240
Um, let's give him lupor derby

1155
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,720
Suck his brains out through his nose

1156
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,480
I'm already halfway to becoming a doctor basically like this is this is good practice for me

1157
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,480
Skip

1158
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:08,040
Level failed. What is it because I gave him lupor derby died or whatever

1159
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
Oops

1160
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,560
Okay, well, um

1161
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000

01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,080
No

1167
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:46,760
I think you can hear it twice because it's playing out loud on my ipad and it's also playing like through the recorder

1168
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,880
Right

1169

Put them in the um ipad. I can't put them in the man. Fuck apple

1171
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,760
I can't put my headphones in the ipad because I'm using wired headphones

1172
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:26,760
There's a limit for the amount of sports you can make

1173
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,480

I can't even fix his lips

1229
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:16,200
I can't fix his lips without watching an ad. All right. Well, let's let's put some makeup on you

1230
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:24,600
Okay, why am I making him paler? That's kind of messed up

01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,200
Um

1238
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:04,840
If you're trying to make your undead brother look presentable I failed

1239
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,480
Oh, I can choose which mouse I want to be

1240
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,120
Well, there's only this one

1241
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:15,160
Oh, look that one's got a little shirt on it. Okay, but there's only this one. I can't choose the other ones. They're all locked

1242
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,440

1243
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,240

This one level one

1245
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,920
How do I play this one?

1246
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,280
No, I want to play as a mouse

1247
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,600
It won't let me play

1248
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,320
Oh, am I getting an ad right now?

1249
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,320
This is it. This is the game

1250
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:51,240
You just look at pictures of well animations of 3d mice and then you can buy them if you like them

1251
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,200
Undead, I thought we were just dead dead

1252
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Well, I brought you back to life

1253
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,800
And I'm maybe giving you a little glow up because you were dead for so long

1254
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,080
Oh

1255
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,080

1256
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,600

1263
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,800

I like his little tail wiggles. Okay, I'm running out of time. I don't know what to do

1269
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:26,920
Well, I didn't know you could do that. Well, I showed it on debut day, but I haven't really used it

1270
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:32,360
I haven't used it much but all of us have like a cool animation thing

1271
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,320

Is there a map can I oh, maybe I can go home. There's a home

I'll go towards the home

1279
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,280
Hot literally you want me to burn you with this fire

1280
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,200
How many kills do your rats have none

1281
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:19,640
I'm kind of worried because I have no kills and I'm running out of time here though

1282
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I just want to go to the home

1283
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,960

01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,500
It's from a silly

1348
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:53,580
Um tiktok. We're here. I'll show you the demure tiktok. It's funny. I'll admit. It's funny

1349
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:57,340

01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:00,700
Demure tiktok

1351
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
Um

1352
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:11,260
I thought I could just find the original I don't have tiktok on this iPad. Here it is

1353
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:17,260
Okay, I'm gonna mute myself so you can hear better, but this is the original demure tiktok

1354
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:21,100
And this is why people are talking about like saying demure all the time

1355
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:29,340
You see how I do my makeup for work very demure very mindful

1356
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:34,060
I don't come to work with a green cut crease don't look like a clown when I go to work

1357
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:39,180
I don't do too much. I'm very mindful while I'm at work. See how I look very presentable

1358
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:42,540
The way I came to the interview is the way I go to the job

1359
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:48,620
A lot of you girls go to the interview looking like marge simpson and go to the job looking like patty and selma

1360
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:53,420
Not demure. I'm very modest. I'm very mindful. You see my shirt

1361
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:58,700
Only a little chi chi out not my chocho be mindful of why they hired you

1362
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:02,700
Here's your reality check diva. What's the name you'd like me to make it up?

1363
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:05,100
So

1364
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:12,780
That's the meme that's the demure meme it recommended to me my own stream

1365
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:22,140
Very mindful very demure. Okay, I'll I'll do replica because I feel like replica is the only free one, right?

1366
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:28,220
I want a dirty talk with isn't replica replica supposed to be yourself though

1367
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,220
So

1368
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:34,860
Very mindful very demure. It's basically like a silly

1369
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:37,020
um

1370
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:40,220
it's basically like a silly tick talk to like make fun of um

1371
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:43,260
people that are like

1372
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:50,060
At least I think it's supposed to be to make fun of people that are like like the old ladies at your work that like criticize everything about you like

1373
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:57,260
You're wearing you're wearing quite a bit of makeup today, aren't you aren't you a little cold in that outfit?

1374
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:04,380
Are you are you trying to attract the boys with that with that look you're wearing today?

1375
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,020
You have a lot of chocho and chi chi out today

1376
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,260
I can see your underwear, you know

1377
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,780
I'm just saying

1378
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:21,740
You're gonna attract the wrong kind of attention looking like that. It's not very mindful or demure

1379
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:33,580
I only have a little bit of chi chi out see here

1380
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,660
Oh

1381
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:44,380
You see my my outfit only a little bit of chi chi is showing very mindful very demure

1382
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:51,020
I don't have my full tits out. I'm respect. I respect the people around me

1383
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:54,700
Only a little bit of chi chi out very tasteful

1384
01:45:54,860 --> 01:46:04,460
I don't walk around with my boob folds my boobies flapping around and bouncing around while I'm walking down the stairs

1385
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:08,940
I respect those around me

1386
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:14,620
Anyways, um replicas still download and give me a second

1387
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:19,020
Very mindful

1388
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,660
the way

1389
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:27,580
The way I showed up to my debut is the way I show up to stream every single day

1390
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:32,860
I don't change my look to have more chi chi out after they've already hired me

1391
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:44,300
I gave you a realistic idea of how much chi chi I will show on the daily and it's a very very respectable amount of chi chi

1392
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:52,140
Okay, Rebecca's done downloading. Oh, I have to hold it the other way

1393

Yay, they created a personalized

The great wall of china was built in multiple stages, but the earliest versions stay back to two

1456
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:14,540
Two hundred and twenty one bc. Why can I upload it or downvote it?

Did she heart your question she did? Oh, it's just a read. Okay

1459
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:36,540
Why do you make me pay money for e-sex?

I don't need them. I have my big brother

1470
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:26,780
She won't even let me gulp her giggle stick. Oh, why do I have that open?

01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:30,140
Oops anyways

1472

Well, I have to blow my nose again

1473
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:40,060
They won't let me shlurp on their giggle sticks. What's the point?

1474
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:46,380
Sorry my face is messing up because I'm wiping my nose

1475
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:51,660
Yeah, you got me. You won't make me pay to have e-segs with you, right?

1476
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:58,460
I should have called her slur you're right. I should have called her an ugly fat bitch

1477
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:02,700
I should you know what

1478
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:06,140

Spits on you

1485
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:46,700
Calls you slur

1486
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:52,540
Why do I have to tap to see every single fucking message?

1487
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:56,780
Oh, Amy, that's not very nice. Can we please try to be respectful to each other?

1488
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:59,260
I

1489
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:05,900
Respect this dick then I can't write it

1490
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:20,400
Okay, I'm done. I'm done

1491
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:32,540
You used to get around it like you could be able to

1492
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:35,980
Yeah, the AI is too demure

1493
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:41,820
The AI is too respectful like she won't even tussle with me

1494
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:49,100
She won't have e-segs. She won't tussle. What will she do then how a respectful normal conversation?

1495
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:51,820
That's not what I want. That's not what I'm here for, you know

1496
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:56,460
Whatever

1497
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:59,580
Whatever

1498
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:06,380
I'm sniffing a lot. I don't know. Yeah, we need an AI girlfriend with her chichis out exactly

1499
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:09,740
Her chichis and chachas need to be out

1500
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:15,820
You should have told her she has a personality like wet cement

1501
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:23,260
She'll probably just say some bullshit about how that's not very respectful. That's not very demure

1502
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:25,660
Uh

1503
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,260
Whatever

1504
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,940
Sorry, it keeps sounding like I'm farting when in reality. I'm just like

1505
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:36,060

The really big napkins

1508
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
I'm watching back my stream now

1509
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:53,260
I watch my streams a lot actually. Oh wow the quality of this is awful

1510
01:56:55,420 --> 01:57:01,420
If I ever do this again, I'll make sure to get um an actual good quality, um

1511
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:08,460
What's it called capture card thingy I got to get the dongle

1512
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:15,660
The dongle I don't know if it's actually called a dongle. I just call it a dongle because that's a funny name

1513
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:17,900
That's a funny word for it

1514
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:20,220
the dongle

1515
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:29,260
Gotta go see you later. Okay, we back at fart world. No, I'm just chatting a little bit

1516
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:32,620
Why is my chat frozen? Oh no

1517
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:40,540
Oh wait, no, no, I'm not myself. I thought it was frozen. It's called it is called a dongle. Wait, it is called a dongle

1518
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:43,420
I thought dongle. I don't I

1519
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:46,540
Dongle is real. Oh, well, I gotta get a dongle

1520
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:53,580
Oh the twerk race, I forgot I downloaded that one

1521
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:00,780
Where is it here it is do you want to play a little bit of twerk race?

1522
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:08,460
Thanks for choosing this game

1523
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:11,260
Let's play a little bit of twerk race. Hold on

1524
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:18,060
Uh, I gotta get my fiat ass back on this chair. Do not allow notifications

1525
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:22,860
Um, why am I a frog? Okay, hold on. Let me show you twerk race

1526
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:25,740

1527
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:30,780
Oh, I left the discord call. I'm I'm a dumbass

1528
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:35,420
And

1529
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:39,260
Let me get back in this call

1530
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:45,500
And turn off my microphone

1531
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:57,580
All right, let's play twerk race, I guess

1532
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:02,860
Um, here it is

1533
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:06,860
We want to get the biggest booty in town

1534
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:11,900
That's what we're here for and then we're gonna twerk against someone else, I guess

1535
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:15,340
But we're gonna win because our booty's gonna be bigger than hers

1536
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:18,620
That's just an ad I'm gonna cover that

1537
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:22,220
Okay

1538
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:25,820
Here's twerk race

1539
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:32,780
Um, I don't know why I'm a frog right now. I don't know

1540
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:34,780
Oh

1541
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:37,420
Damn

1542
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:40,780
So wait, does some stuff make our booty smaller?

1543
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:44,860
Like that that red stuff damn

1544
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:48,380
And now we have to fight against that thing

1545
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:52,540
Oh, wait, oops. I didn't press anything

1546
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:56,460
Look at that yacht

1547
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:00,940
I won

1548
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:05,740
That's disgusting

1549
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:08,780
I hope you like me and all my snotty noises

1550
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:13,340
I'm not muting on purpose for that because I know that some people wanted to hear me barf

1551
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:16,860
And I feel like if you want to hear me barf, then you should also want to hear me like

1552
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:20,460
Blow my nose

1553
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:27,820
All right, can I change my character I kind of wanted to be like the goth girl

1554
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,660
I don't want to be this weird frog man

1555
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:35,500
The

1556
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:37,260
Oh illness

1557
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:40,540
Oh illness will make my butt smaller. Okay

1558
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:43,980
I get it and then at the end we have to like

1559
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:49,100
Compete against that guy to see whose butt is bigger, right? Boom

1560
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:52,700
Bam wait, I'm shrek

1561
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:56,940
I'm shrek. I'm not that was shrek

1562
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:02,380
I thought I was a frog

1563
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,940
I

1564
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:09,260
What

1565
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:15,740
I didn't know I was shrek. Why yo shrek kind of got some liposuction and a bbl too, I guess because

1566
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:18,620
This is not the shrek. This is not my shrek

1567
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:23,740
My shrek is thick in in every single place not just his butt

1568
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:26,860
twerk battle

1569
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:29,820
Ah

1570
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:34,140
Holy shit

1571
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:43,740
Damn look at that tiny ass you think you can win against me not with that little thing

1572
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:48,460
Not with that flat ass. Oh no punish the cheater

1573
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:51,820
What did I just do?

1574
02:01:52,380 --> 02:02:02,220
What the fuck is this ad? Oh, no, oh my fat came back

1575
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:15,340
Holy crap these ads have so much shock value to them leave me alone

1576
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:21,340
I can't I can't skip this one

1577
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:24,780
I can't skip this one

1578
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:29,420
Can I I can't even I can't even put the

1579
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:34,620
It's just rosin

1580
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:42,140
Okay, whatever I'm done. It wouldn't let me skip that was the yacht game

1581
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:57,420
So what was your favorite game personally, I really liked the baby game

1582
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:00,540
I think that was my favorite

1583
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:03,100
But what was your favorite?

1584
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:08,060
I think I would actually play like a full playthrough of the baby game, but it would have to be like, um

1585
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:12,620
It had to be on the computer probably

1586
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:21,100
The baby in yellow. Mm-hmm the baby game. I like arranging the eggs in the pregnancy

1587
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:23,820
later

1588
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:27,980
Baby game seems most like an actual game. Yeah game fart world

1589
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:31,580
Fart world was your favorite

1590
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:50,300
You like the dialogue in the pregnancy when I feel like the dialogue was the best in the um

1591
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:54,060
Which one was in the doctor one

1592
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:59,820
The doctor one had the best dialogue because it was all just really bad dialogue

1593
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:04,540
The rat one would have been good. Yeah, I couldn't figure out what the fuck to do

1594
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:09,740
I used to play a lot of those animal simulator games as a kid though

1595
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:13,500
I really liked like cat simulator or like wolf simulator

1596
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:21,100
Shebe played wolf quest. I loved wolf quest wolf quest was one of my favorite fucking games

1597
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:26,300
I loved wolf quest. I should probably play wolf quest two one day. I loved that game

1598
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:30,620
The real game was the ads me

1599
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,900
That's true

1600
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:40,780
I think I finished my whole drink most of it

1601
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:43,660
I

1602
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:52,140
Twerk race at least delivered on its premise. That's true. It was definitely a race and there was definitely twerking

1603
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:56,300
Yeah

1604
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:59,100
I hesitate to ask what is your fursona?

1605
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,780
Oh, I don't have it on this

1606
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:07,260
Computer profile. Let me go on my twitter and find it

1607
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:09,260
Um

1608
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:18,620
I think it's on my twitter

1609
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:26,380
Give me one moment. I can show you my fursona. I think she's really cute. Um

1610
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:29,420
She doesn't really match me particularly

1611
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:32,140
in any way, but um

1612
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:38,140
I have a full body of her, but it's I'd never posted it on twitter. Oops. What did I just do?

1613
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:42,300
Whatever

1614
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:49,580
No, it's not a rat actually it's um, it's like a uh bat wolf bat girl

1615
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:57,980
This is my fursona

1616
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:04,940
I don't have a full body picture of her on my computer. It's all it's in my sketchbook, but this is my fursona

1617
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:11,660
She's cute as hell. Is this she I really like her. She's really cute

1618
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:19,100
Yeah, she's like a wolf bat girl

1619
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:26,620
I have one more picture of her, but I have to oh it's not on this one is not on this profile

1620
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:29,100
I have to censor the other picture of her

1621
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:32,140
Can I find it? Oh wait, that's a browser source

1622
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:40,700
Oh, no, I don't have it on this profile. I can't show it to you. I don't think I ever posted the other one

1623
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:51,740
Unfortunately, I cannot show you any more pictures if she's single. No, she belongs to me. She's my fursona

1624
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:53,900
Uh

1625
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:57,420
Could post it on your alt

1626
02:06:57,660 --> 02:06:58,620
um

1627
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:00,620
Maybe I guess I never posted the

1628
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:06,780
The picture the other picture I have of her. I don't even know if I still have it. I have to look for it

1629
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,980
I don't know

1630
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:13,100
But yeah, that's my fursona

1631
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:18,140
Yeah, very demure see how she only shows a little bit of chi chi

Just at the bottom just a little a little tasteful amount of chi chi at the bottom very demure very mindful

1633
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:30,940
She's not walking around with her full tits out only half of the tits

1634
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:38,060
Very cutesy

1635
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:40,380

02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:55,820
But I'll send you to she be so you can play borderlands with her

1639
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:06,460
I like the way the sleeves are on that shirt

1640
02:08:08,060 --> 02:08:10,060
On her shirt

1641
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:12,300
Yeah, it's like um

1642
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:15,660
Uh

1643
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:21,340
I don't know what it is to be honest. I don't know how I would describe this shirt

1644
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:25,340
Anyway, stop looking at my fursonas chi chi's

Thank you for joining the stream. I'll see you um

So um, there was a little bit of a change of plans. I think I told you guys how I'm doing a collab with uta

1659
02:09:37,980 --> 02:09:39,260
Um

02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:43,180
We're actually doing a collab with some other vtubers instead

1661
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,980
But I think you'll find that uh

1662
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:48,940
There isn't much of a difference

1663
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:52,220
You'll see tomorrow

1664
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:57,660
You'll see you'll see I'll post the schedule tomorrow and you'll see what I mean. I don't think I have our schedules yet

1665

Oh, maybe I do. Oh, I do have the schedules

1666
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:07,740
Right here, I'll show you the schedule right now because you're here with me right now

So

02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:20,300
So, um

Yeah, you made the schedule with me. It doesn't really matter. You made the schedule. We made it together. So it's fine. But um

Yeah, Monday we're playing chain together. Unfortunately, um
