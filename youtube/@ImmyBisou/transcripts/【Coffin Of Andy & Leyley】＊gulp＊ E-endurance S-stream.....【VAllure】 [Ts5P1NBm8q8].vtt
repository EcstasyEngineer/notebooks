ఓయ�gh

03:33.660 --> 03:35.660
how is your favorite ginger?

03:37.660 --> 03:39.660
I still can't believe I'm ginger man

03:39.660 --> 03:41.660
I don't look ginger

03:41.660 --> 03:44.660
I just look blonde to me

03:45.660 --> 03:48.660
I'll try making my 2.0 look more ginger

03:48.660 --> 03:50.660
Whenever you wake up this morning

03:50.660 --> 03:52.660
we don't make the rose here, yeah

03:53.660 --> 03:55.660
You fall asleep when I fall asleep

03:57.660 --> 03:59.660
My morning is your morning

04:00.660 --> 04:02.660
I hit my mic

04:02.660 --> 04:04.660
It's the freckles

04:04.660 --> 04:06.660
Yeah, but gingers also have ginger hair

04:06.660 --> 04:08.660
And I feel like mine is blonde

04:08.660 --> 04:10.660
Not ginger, you know

04:13.660 --> 04:15.660
Ginger denial

04:16.660 --> 04:18.660
I guess, yeah, I'm in denial

04:19.660 --> 04:21.660
I hope you can recover soon

04:21.660 --> 04:23.660
Me too, but it's okay

04:23.660 --> 04:25.660
Even if I don't recover in a couple weeks

04:27.660 --> 04:29.660
I'm going on vacation soon

04:29.660 --> 04:31.660
Like actually

04:31.660 --> 04:33.660
So I can take that time

04:33.660 --> 04:35.660
To recover too

04:37.660 --> 04:39.660
Because um

04:39.660 --> 04:41.660
No don't worry, I went last year

04:41.660 --> 04:43.660
I'm going to be going every year

04:43.660 --> 04:47.660
This is a planned vacation that I go on every year

04:47.660 --> 04:50.660
So it's inevitable

04:50.660 --> 04:52.660
I'm going to be going next year

04:52.660 --> 04:54.660
And the year before that

04:54.660 --> 04:57.660
Because this is a planned vacation that I go on every year

04:57.660 --> 05:00.660
So yeah, I'm going on vacation soon

05:00.660 --> 05:03.660
So I can use that time to recover

05:03.660 --> 05:05.660
If um

05:06.660 --> 05:10.660
If for some reason the cough lasts a really long time

05:10.660 --> 05:12.660
Yeah

05:12.660 --> 05:14.660
It won't be long, don't worry

05:14.660 --> 05:16.660
It won't be a long vacation

05:16.660 --> 05:18.660
Right?

05:18.660 --> 05:21.660
Did you have a happy sleep? I did, it was so good

05:21.660 --> 05:23.660
You don't fucking get it

05:23.660 --> 05:26.660
When I was like

05:26.660 --> 05:28.660
Setting my timer

05:28.660 --> 05:30.660
To wake up at 11, I was like

05:30.660 --> 05:32.660
I'm not going to make it

05:32.660 --> 05:34.660
I'm not going to make it

05:34.660 --> 05:36.660
I'm not going to make it

05:36.660 --> 05:38.660
And I didn't make it

05:38.660 --> 05:40.660
Here I am, wait

05:40.660 --> 05:42.660
Right, I know my voice is really croaky right now

05:42.660 --> 05:44.660
It's because I just woke up

05:44.660 --> 05:46.660
Hope you have fun there

05:48.660 --> 05:50.660
Okay, let me show you something

05:50.660 --> 05:52.660
Let me show you

05:52.660 --> 05:54.660
Oh

05:54.660 --> 05:56.660
Okay

05:56.660 --> 05:58.660
Right

05:58.660 --> 06:00.660
Oh, that's not the right thing

06:00.660 --> 06:02.660
Right, so

06:06.660 --> 06:08.660
Here's our screen, right?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.660
Let me explain the rules

06:12.660 --> 06:14.660
Okay, let me explain the rules

06:14.660 --> 06:16.660
So, here's our rules

06:18.660 --> 06:20.660
Any tip amount

06:20.660 --> 06:22.660
Is a sip of water?

06:24.660 --> 06:26.660
Hold on

06:26.660 --> 06:28.660
Let me make sure my tips actually work

06:28.660 --> 06:30.660
Because I'm not sure they do

06:30.660 --> 06:32.660
I'm not sure that they do

06:34.660 --> 06:36.660
And also we're doing our monetization stream

06:36.660 --> 06:38.660
Tomorrow

06:38.660 --> 06:40.660
Because I got monetized

06:40.660 --> 06:42.660
I'm here

06:48.660 --> 06:50.660
Tip event custom

07:04.660 --> 07:06.660
Right

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
Well

07:08.660 --> 07:10.660
It's supposed to

07:10.660 --> 07:12.660
It's supposed to have text to speech

07:12.660 --> 07:14.660
Um

07:14.660 --> 07:16.660
Sip sip sip get hydrate get hydrate

07:16.660 --> 07:18.660
Why doesn't it have text to speech?

07:18.660 --> 07:20.660
Oh, I already have to sip

07:20.660 --> 07:22.660
Was that? Fuck, okay

07:26.660 --> 07:28.660
Um

07:28.660 --> 07:30.660
Oh, it's because I muted it

07:30.660 --> 07:32.660
Okay, there we go

07:32.660 --> 07:34.660
Let me try that again just to make sure

07:38.660 --> 07:40.660
Okay

07:44.660 --> 07:46.660
Also, I did sip

07:46.660 --> 07:48.660
Thank you for the dono

07:48.660 --> 07:50.660
I did sip, I did

07:50.660 --> 07:52.660
Okay, let's try that again

07:52.660 --> 07:54.660
Are you gay?

07:54.660 --> 07:56.660
Why are you acting so gay?

07:56.660 --> 07:58.660
Okay, why am I not hearing it?

08:00.660 --> 08:02.660
Alerts monitor

08:02.660 --> 08:04.660
Are you gay?

08:04.660 --> 08:06.660
Why are you acting so gay?

08:06.660 --> 08:08.660
To drink water, not just me

08:08.660 --> 08:10.660
Okay

08:10.660 --> 08:12.660
There, I drink

08:12.660 --> 08:14.660
Oh, for some reason my alerts

08:14.660 --> 08:16.660
Aren't

08:18.660 --> 08:20.660
Doing text to speech

08:22.660 --> 08:24.660
Let me try something

08:24.660 --> 08:26.660
Alerts

08:26.660 --> 08:28.660
Control via OBS, no

08:28.660 --> 08:30.660
There

08:30.660 --> 08:32.660
Emulate

08:32.660 --> 08:34.660
Custom

08:34.660 --> 08:36.660
Chat

08:42.660 --> 08:44.660
How about that?

08:44.660 --> 08:46.660
Are you gay?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.660
There we go

08:48.660 --> 08:50.660
Why are you acting so gay?

08:50.660 --> 08:52.660
Penis, penis, penis, penis

08:52.660 --> 08:54.660
There we go

08:54.660 --> 08:56.660
Right, I realize that our alerts

08:56.660 --> 08:58.660
Are covering the rules

08:58.660 --> 09:00.660
So I'll move them

09:00.660 --> 09:02.660
$1 for one sip, it's any amount

09:02.660 --> 09:04.660
For one sip

09:04.660 --> 09:06.660
A sip is any amount

09:10.660 --> 09:12.660
Okay

09:12.660 --> 09:14.660
Where the fuck are my rules?

09:14.660 --> 09:16.660
Okay, so continuing on

09:16.660 --> 09:18.660
Energy levels goes as following

09:18.660 --> 09:20.660
So I will have my energy down here

09:20.660 --> 09:22.660
Are you gay?

09:22.660 --> 09:24.660
Why are you acting so gay?

09:24.660 --> 09:26.660
Hi Emmy, hydration check

09:28.660 --> 09:30.660
Thank you for the $1

09:30.660 --> 09:32.660
Okay, hydration check

09:34.660 --> 09:36.660
Okay there

09:40.660 --> 09:42.660
Right

09:42.660 --> 09:44.660
Yeah, energy goes as following

09:44.660 --> 09:46.660
So there's good as you can see down there

09:46.660 --> 09:48.660
And then there's alright

09:50.660 --> 09:52.660
And then there's

09:52.660 --> 09:54.660
Are you sick? Yes I am sick

09:54.660 --> 09:56.660
There's alright

09:56.660 --> 09:58.660
And then there's eek

09:58.660 --> 10:00.660
And then there's low

10:00.660 --> 10:02.660
And then there's very low

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
And then there's no more

10:04.660 --> 10:06.660
And it says please please please please please

10:06.660 --> 10:08.660
Let me end, okay?

10:08.660 --> 10:10.660
That's how the energy levels go

10:12.660 --> 10:14.660
And then

10:14.660 --> 10:16.660
Once energy is very low

10:16.660 --> 10:18.660
Sorry, once energy is low

10:18.660 --> 10:20.660
I will start making polls to ask

10:20.660 --> 10:22.660
If I can end stream

10:22.660 --> 10:24.660
I can only...

10:24.660 --> 10:26.660
Are you gay?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.660
This is going to get interesting

10:28.660 --> 10:30.660
Also congrats on monetization

10:30.660 --> 10:32.660
Thank you

10:32.660 --> 10:34.660
For the $20

10:38.660 --> 10:40.660
There

10:40.660 --> 10:42.660
And thank you, thank you

10:42.660 --> 10:44.660
Very happy that we got monetized

10:44.660 --> 10:46.660
I'm sorry if I don't

10:46.660 --> 10:48.660
Some of the other girls are so thankful

10:48.660 --> 10:50.660
On Twitter they're giving such heartfelt messages

10:50.660 --> 10:52.660
And I'm like damn

10:52.660 --> 10:54.660
I probably seem like an asshole

10:54.660 --> 10:56.660
Why are you so gay?

10:56.660 --> 10:58.660
I can't talk right now

10:58.660 --> 11:00.660
I'm making piss

11:00.660 --> 11:02.660
Thank you for the $420

11:04.660 --> 11:06.660
I hope you can hear me drink

11:08.660 --> 11:10.660
But I am thankful

11:10.660 --> 11:12.660
I'm just not like

11:12.660 --> 11:14.660
I guess I'm just not as hyped cause it's like

11:14.660 --> 11:16.660
I sound like such an asshole

11:16.660 --> 11:18.660
Cause it's like

11:18.660 --> 11:20.660
Of course we got monetized

11:20.660 --> 11:22.660
That's the whole point of this

11:22.660 --> 11:24.660
But I thank you for watching

11:24.660 --> 11:26.660
And helping us get there

11:26.660 --> 11:28.660
You know

11:28.660 --> 11:30.660
So I'm happy that

11:30.660 --> 11:32.660
You're the one watching

11:32.660 --> 11:34.660
And helping us get monetized

11:34.660 --> 11:36.660
But um

11:36.660 --> 11:38.660
I've already been monetized before

11:38.660 --> 11:40.660
So it's not like a huge accomplishment for me

11:40.660 --> 11:42.660
If that doesn't make me sound like a bitch

11:42.660 --> 11:44.660
I feel like it does

11:44.660 --> 11:46.660
But yeah

11:46.660 --> 11:48.660
You sound good okay

11:48.660 --> 11:50.660
But you know

11:50.660 --> 11:52.660
It's a big goal

11:52.660 --> 11:54.660
And I'm happy that you helped us get there

11:56.660 --> 11:58.660
Right

11:58.660 --> 12:00.660
Thank you for the headpats too

12:00.660 --> 12:02.660
Gay

12:02.660 --> 12:04.660
Why are you acting so gay?

12:04.660 --> 12:06.660
Yippee

12:06.660 --> 12:08.660
Another sip

12:08.660 --> 12:10.660
Man

12:12.660 --> 12:14.660
Okay

12:14.660 --> 12:16.660
Everyone takes it in differently

12:16.660 --> 12:18.660
I just feel like compared to the other girls

12:18.660 --> 12:20.660
I'm like underwhelming

12:20.660 --> 12:22.660
Cause I'm like

12:22.660 --> 12:24.660
Well I sure hope we got monetized

12:24.660 --> 12:26.660
But yeah

12:26.660 --> 12:28.660
Thank you

12:28.660 --> 12:30.660
Okay um right

12:30.660 --> 12:32.660
Let me show you the game

12:32.660 --> 12:34.660
And also

12:34.660 --> 12:36.660
Fuck

12:36.660 --> 12:38.660
Um

12:40.660 --> 12:42.660
There are branching paths in this part of the game

12:42.660 --> 12:44.660
This is gonna need more than one save file

12:44.660 --> 12:46.660
Well

12:46.660 --> 12:48.660
We only want one path

12:50.660 --> 12:52.660
I'm only going one path

12:52.660 --> 12:54.660
I'm not playing multiple endings

12:54.660 --> 12:56.660
Membership went Saturday

12:56.660 --> 12:58.660
So tomorrow

12:58.660 --> 13:00.660
Right um

13:02.660 --> 13:04.660
Also I

13:04.660 --> 13:06.660
I'm not gonna explicitly say it

13:06.660 --> 13:08.660
But I'm gonna explicitly say it now

13:12.660 --> 13:14.660
I started

13:16.660 --> 13:18.660
Oh shit is this a game built on chromium

13:18.660 --> 13:20.660
No

13:20.660 --> 13:22.660
I started

13:22.660 --> 13:24.660
This stream having to piss

13:24.660 --> 13:26.660
Okay I woke up

13:26.660 --> 13:28.660
From sleeping

13:28.660 --> 13:30.660
And I had to go

13:30.660 --> 13:32.660
And you know what I didn't do? I didn't go

13:32.660 --> 13:34.660
You're welcome

13:34.660 --> 13:36.660
Saving a chest for you

13:40.660 --> 13:42.660
9 out of 10

13:42.660 --> 13:44.660
9 out of 10

13:44.660 --> 13:46.660
Why are you acting so gay

13:52.660 --> 13:54.660
I love you too

13:54.660 --> 13:56.660
Thank you for the 420

13:58.660 --> 14:00.660
Okay

14:00.660 --> 14:02.660
Keep your mic on when you go

14:02.660 --> 14:04.660
That's the thing I'm not fucking going

14:04.660 --> 14:06.660
Until you tell me to end the stream

14:08.660 --> 14:10.660
I'm not going

14:10.660 --> 14:12.660
That's the plan of the endurance stream

14:12.660 --> 14:14.660
So yeah

14:22.660 --> 14:24.660
Okay let me set up here

14:24.660 --> 14:26.660
Get all comfy

14:28.660 --> 14:30.660
There won't be ending simple as

14:30.660 --> 14:32.660
What do you mean there won't be an ending

14:32.660 --> 14:34.660
We are ending it's ending eventually

14:34.660 --> 14:36.660
You're letting me end please let me end eventually

14:38.660 --> 14:40.660
I hope you get a mat ready

14:40.660 --> 14:42.660
Shut up

14:42.660 --> 14:44.660
Please I need to end eventually

14:44.660 --> 14:46.660
Gay

14:46.660 --> 14:48.660
Why are you acting so gay

14:48.660 --> 14:50.660
Testing testing

14:50.660 --> 14:52.660
It works I'll set up for you

14:52.660 --> 14:54.660
Thank you for the 10 dollars

14:56.660 --> 14:58.660
Just make sure you don't hurt yourself

14:58.660 --> 15:00.660
I won't

15:00.660 --> 15:02.660
I would not lie to you

15:02.660 --> 15:04.660
I can't

15:04.660 --> 15:06.660
Not that I've tried before or anything

15:06.660 --> 15:08.660
But I can't

15:08.660 --> 15:10.660
We will never let you leave

15:10.660 --> 15:12.660
I think you will

15:12.660 --> 15:14.660
I think if I beg hard enough you will

15:14.660 --> 15:16.660
You'll feel bad for me

15:18.660 --> 15:20.660
We need a safe word

15:22.660 --> 15:24.660
I was going to say a slur as our safe word

15:24.660 --> 15:26.660
But then I realized that I probably shouldn't

15:26.660 --> 15:28.660
Um

15:36.660 --> 15:38.660
Let's use the word

15:38.660 --> 15:40.660
Rats

15:40.660 --> 15:42.660
Rats is our safe word

15:44.660 --> 15:46.660
Anyways let's continue

15:46.660 --> 15:48.660
Our game

15:52.660 --> 15:54.660
Okay we were in the park

15:54.660 --> 15:56.660
What were we doing in the park

15:56.660 --> 15:58.660
Rats

15:58.660 --> 16:00.660
Rats

16:00.660 --> 16:02.660
Where are the rats

16:04.660 --> 16:06.660
Yes it's a very fitting safe word

16:08.660 --> 16:10.660
Ice cream stand

16:10.660 --> 16:12.660
Only

16:12.660 --> 16:14.660
Only operates during the height of summer season

16:16.660 --> 16:18.660
Oh

16:18.660 --> 16:20.660
This can't be the right place

16:20.660 --> 16:22.660
Look how nice everything is

16:22.660 --> 16:24.660
No it's gotta be

16:24.660 --> 16:26.660
She did sound happy when she talked about their new place too

16:28.660 --> 16:30.660
What's the last name anyways

16:30.660 --> 16:32.660
What do you mean what's the last name

16:32.660 --> 16:34.660
The name plates on the doors

16:34.660 --> 16:36.660
Gay? Why are you acting so gay

16:36.660 --> 16:38.660
I already feel bad

16:38.660 --> 16:40.660
Yet here I go donating

16:40.660 --> 16:42.660
Thank you for the 15 dollars

16:46.660 --> 16:48.660
I hope you can hear me sipping

16:48.660 --> 16:50.660
Right

16:50.660 --> 16:52.660
The name plates on the door

16:52.660 --> 16:54.660
Did they go with dad's name or mom's

16:54.660 --> 16:56.660
Dad's name right

16:56.660 --> 16:58.660
Why would they change that at this point

17:00.660 --> 17:02.660
I don't know to throw us off

17:02.660 --> 17:04.660
You really make it sound like they don't want us to find them

17:04.660 --> 17:06.660
Just a feeling I got

17:06.660 --> 17:08.660
Or whatever

17:08.660 --> 17:10.660
Let's find the house of Mr. and Mrs. Graves

17:10.660 --> 17:12.660
Going to the parent's house right

17:12.660 --> 17:14.660
Did you skip an episode

17:14.660 --> 17:16.660
I played a little

17:16.660 --> 17:18.660
At the end of a stream

17:18.660 --> 17:20.660
Grayson

17:20.660 --> 17:22.660
So if you missed one of the streams

17:22.660 --> 17:24.660
I think it was during the

17:24.660 --> 17:26.660
Blind stream

17:26.660 --> 17:28.660
Where I played a little

17:28.660 --> 17:30.660
Ugly Van McHidious

17:30.660 --> 17:32.660
Are you gay

17:32.660 --> 17:34.660
Why are you acting so gay

17:34.660 --> 17:36.660
It's okay Emmy we understand never feel bad

17:36.660 --> 17:38.660
We are happy and proud that you made it to this point

17:38.660 --> 17:40.660
I'm really excited for this stream

17:40.660 --> 17:42.660
Are you gay

17:42.660 --> 17:44.660
Why are you acting so gay

17:44.660 --> 17:46.660
It's peak

17:46.660 --> 17:48.660
Crying face

17:48.660 --> 17:50.660
Crying face

17:52.660 --> 17:54.660
I guess if twice for that one

17:58.660 --> 18:00.660
Andy and Layla are going to be the next

18:00.660 --> 18:02.660
Mr. and Mr. Graves

18:02.660 --> 18:04.660
Cause we're going to make them fuck

18:04.660 --> 18:06.660
Don't just knock

18:06.660 --> 18:08.660
Uh oh no one comes

18:08.660 --> 18:10.660
Alright whatever

18:10.660 --> 18:12.660
Let's just find a way in

18:12.660 --> 18:14.660
I don't know how do we get in

18:14.660 --> 18:16.660
Break in

18:16.660 --> 18:18.660
Just break in

18:18.660 --> 18:20.660
Are you gay

18:20.660 --> 18:22.660
Why are you acting so gay

18:22.660 --> 18:24.660
We can hear don't worry

18:24.660 --> 18:26.660
Thank you for the tip

18:30.660 --> 18:32.660
Okay that's good that you can hear

18:32.660 --> 18:34.660
What are they doing

18:34.660 --> 18:36.660
They're bringing into the house

18:36.660 --> 18:38.660
Also I'm sorry I can't say your name

18:38.660 --> 18:40.660
When you tip it's because

18:40.660 --> 18:42.660
I'm so

18:42.660 --> 18:44.660
I'm like leaning back in my

18:44.660 --> 18:46.660
In my desk

18:46.660 --> 18:48.660
In my chair

18:48.660 --> 18:50.660
And I'm actually so blind

18:50.660 --> 18:52.660
That even my glasses can't help me

18:52.660 --> 18:54.660
I can barely even see chat

18:54.660 --> 18:56.660
Open

18:56.660 --> 18:58.660
Go down the pebble path it's the driveway

18:58.660 --> 19:00.660
Oh

19:00.660 --> 19:02.660
Oh

19:02.660 --> 19:04.660
We've got a guardian

19:04.660 --> 19:06.660
Everything doesn't matter

19:06.660 --> 19:08.660
We'll fill our pockets and go

19:08.660 --> 19:10.660
Yeah fuck these parents

19:10.660 --> 19:12.660
Steal their plants

19:12.660 --> 19:14.660
Shit on their crops

19:14.660 --> 19:16.660
Taste the onions

19:16.660 --> 19:18.660
Piss on them a stick

19:18.660 --> 19:20.660
Parents

19:20.660 --> 19:22.660
Destroy the crops

19:22.660 --> 19:24.660
Are you gay

19:24.660 --> 19:26.660
Why are you acting so gay

19:26.660 --> 19:28.660
Just a tip you could have the rest later

19:28.660 --> 19:30.660
Thank you for just the tip

19:34.660 --> 19:36.660
Bougie parents right

19:36.660 --> 19:38.660
I need a seeing eye rat

19:38.660 --> 19:40.660
I do

19:40.660 --> 19:42.660
The rats have worse vision than me

19:44.660 --> 19:46.660
Go down the pebble path

19:46.660 --> 19:48.660
Energy conservation position

19:48.660 --> 19:50.660
Yeah it's my energy conservation position

19:50.660 --> 19:52.660
It doesn't put any

19:52.660 --> 19:54.660
You know pressure on my bladder

19:56.660 --> 19:58.660
Going through the window

19:58.660 --> 20:00.660
Oh

20:02.660 --> 20:04.660
Oh why'd you troll me then

20:06.660 --> 20:08.660
No I didn't say that

20:08.660 --> 20:10.660
Don't worry

20:10.660 --> 20:12.660
Salt the crops poison the water

20:12.660 --> 20:14.660
Yeah

20:14.660 --> 20:16.660
Grab the rocks

20:16.660 --> 20:18.660
Grab the rocks

20:18.660 --> 20:20.660
Grab them and break through the window

20:24.660 --> 20:26.660
Come on dudes

20:26.660 --> 20:28.660
Don't be stupid

20:32.660 --> 20:34.660
Wind plank

20:36.660 --> 20:38.660
Two out of ten

20:38.660 --> 20:40.660
That was a puny one

20:40.660 --> 20:42.660
That was a pussy fart

20:42.660 --> 20:44.660
Place down the plank wall

20:44.660 --> 20:46.660
Still too high

20:46.660 --> 20:48.660
Lift me up

20:48.660 --> 20:50.660
Well no good

20:50.660 --> 20:52.660
It's open but held in place by a latch

20:52.660 --> 20:54.660
That's on the other side of the window

20:58.660 --> 21:00.660
I might start muting to cough cause I know it's annoying

21:00.660 --> 21:02.660
No good it's open

21:02.660 --> 21:04.660
Damnit my fingers can't reach

21:04.660 --> 21:06.660
Reach to unhook it

21:06.660 --> 21:08.660
You go bitch

21:08.660 --> 21:10.660
I'll push you up after you open the latch

21:12.660 --> 21:14.660
You're just looking for an excuse to touch my ass

21:14.660 --> 21:16.660
Okay two things

21:16.660 --> 21:18.660
First of all no

21:18.660 --> 21:20.660
Secondly like I need an excuse

21:20.660 --> 21:22.660
Touch my ass

21:28.660 --> 21:30.660
Tiny hands? What do you mean tiny hands?

21:34.660 --> 21:36.660
Say for it should be something you would never say

21:36.660 --> 21:38.660
Like I hate my brother

21:38.660 --> 21:40.660
But I don't want to say that

21:42.660 --> 21:44.660
I'm hurrying up and finding something

21:44.660 --> 21:46.660
Before I slap you

21:46.660 --> 21:48.660
Slab me

21:48.660 --> 21:50.660
On my ass or the face

21:50.660 --> 21:52.660
That melody I'll let you find out

21:52.660 --> 21:54.660
Why are you acting so gay?

21:54.660 --> 21:56.660
I love my little sister

21:56.660 --> 21:58.660
I love my little sister too

21:58.660 --> 22:00.660
I love my big brother

22:00.660 --> 22:02.660
Thank you for the 420

22:04.660 --> 22:06.660
The cops really add to the little sis vibe

22:06.660 --> 22:08.660
Do they?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.660
I feel like they're annoying

22:12.660 --> 22:14.660
So it's the face

22:14.660 --> 22:16.660
I'll find something to unhook the latch with

22:18.660 --> 22:20.660
The rock

22:20.660 --> 22:22.660
The rock

22:28.660 --> 22:30.660
The carrot

22:30.660 --> 22:32.660
A stick

22:32.660 --> 22:34.660
Hi Amy how are you?

22:34.660 --> 22:36.660
I'm okay

22:36.660 --> 22:38.660
For now

22:40.660 --> 22:42.660
Gen 2 leak

22:42.660 --> 22:44.660
You know we actually saw the concept art for Gen 2

22:44.660 --> 22:46.660
There's some interesting choices

22:46.660 --> 22:48.660
Well we don't talk about Gen 2 yet

22:48.660 --> 22:50.660
Gen 2 isn't even close to happening

22:56.660 --> 22:58.660
Andrew helps you climb through the window

22:58.660 --> 23:00.660
The open window

23:00.660 --> 23:02.660
Give me your hand

23:02.660 --> 23:04.660
I'll pull you up

23:04.660 --> 23:06.660
Thanks but I much rather you just open a door for me

23:06.660 --> 23:08.660
Oh yeah that would be easier

23:08.660 --> 23:10.660
Ew why is the house so ransacked?

23:14.660 --> 23:16.660
What happened?

23:16.660 --> 23:18.660
Oh renovations

23:20.660 --> 23:22.660
You turn the handle when the water comes out

23:26.660 --> 23:28.660
Is this the door? No this is the door

23:30.660 --> 23:32.660
Welcome welcome

23:32.660 --> 23:34.660
Thank you not so fast

23:34.660 --> 23:36.660
Now what do we say?

23:36.660 --> 23:38.660
Thank you very much

23:38.660 --> 23:40.660
Wrong try in

23:40.660 --> 23:42.660
Exceptionally well done

23:42.660 --> 23:44.660
That was an earth shattering performance

23:44.660 --> 23:46.660
Yes to think you'd open a door so swiftly with such grace

23:46.660 --> 23:48.660
Studying marvelous breathtaking

23:48.660 --> 23:50.660
Those are but a few words

23:50.660 --> 23:52.660
I'd use to describe your ability to trespass

23:52.660 --> 23:54.660
May I come in now?

24:00.660 --> 24:02.660
You better get the good ending

24:02.660 --> 24:04.660
I'm trying

24:08.660 --> 24:10.660
Take your hand bro stop fumbling

24:10.660 --> 24:12.660
Not as romantic though

24:12.660 --> 24:14.660
Wait what do you mean not as romantic

24:18.660 --> 24:20.660
You may great let's split up

24:20.660 --> 24:22.660
I want to get out of here as soon as fast as possible

24:22.660 --> 24:24.660
Hey there was something I was worrying about

24:24.660 --> 24:26.660
Right now can't it wait

24:26.660 --> 24:28.660
Our situation is kind of sensitive

24:28.660 --> 24:30.660
Well it can I guess

24:30.660 --> 24:32.660
Good then tell me later

24:34.660 --> 24:36.660
What you worried about

24:40.660 --> 24:42.660
He's such a well trained big brother

24:42.660 --> 24:44.660
He is

24:44.660 --> 24:46.660
A fireplace

24:46.660 --> 24:48.660
They have a goddamn fireplace Andrew

24:48.660 --> 24:50.660
Yeah this is some rich people stuff

24:50.660 --> 24:52.660
Who has a fireplace inside their house

24:52.660 --> 24:54.660
It's not that uncommon is it

24:54.660 --> 24:56.660
Not in older houses anyways

24:56.660 --> 24:58.660
But is this

24:58.660 --> 25:00.660
House old?

25:00.660 --> 25:02.660
Fuck if I know

25:04.660 --> 25:06.660
She's worried about that dream

25:12.660 --> 25:14.660
You can train us like this in me

25:14.660 --> 25:16.660
I totally will

25:16.660 --> 25:18.660
The dresser is locked

25:18.660 --> 25:20.660
Why is it locked?

25:20.660 --> 25:22.660
Find the key

25:22.660 --> 25:24.660
You don't even know

25:24.660 --> 25:26.660
I don't know

25:26.660 --> 25:28.660
I don't

25:28.660 --> 25:30.660
Toys

25:30.660 --> 25:32.660
Toys in a row

25:32.660 --> 25:34.660
We should take those

25:34.660 --> 25:36.660
Damn it

25:38.660 --> 25:40.660
Is that all

25:42.660 --> 25:44.660
Very tasteful living room

25:48.660 --> 25:50.660
Did I go in this room

25:50.660 --> 25:52.660
Oh yes

25:54.660 --> 25:56.660
Check the closet

25:56.660 --> 25:58.660
I did

25:58.660 --> 26:00.660
Are you gay

26:00.660 --> 26:02.660
Why are you looking so gay

26:02.660 --> 26:04.660
Energy level is looking a bit too high

26:06.660 --> 26:08.660
Thank you for the 420

26:12.660 --> 26:14.660
It's not normal to do this

26:14.660 --> 26:16.660
Without sibling

26:16.660 --> 26:18.660
Do what without a sibling

26:18.660 --> 26:20.660
Check the phone

26:20.660 --> 26:22.660
Sorry if you hear some background noise

26:22.660 --> 26:24.660
My rats won't stop drinking water

26:24.660 --> 26:26.660
They're playing along with me

26:26.660 --> 26:28.660
It's like the phone you never call

26:28.660 --> 26:30.660
It's the phone your mom never calls you with

26:30.660 --> 26:32.660
Notice how there aren't

26:32.660 --> 26:34.660
Any photos of us here

26:34.660 --> 26:36.660
So what

26:36.660 --> 26:38.660
I guess I'm a little offended

26:38.660 --> 26:40.660
It's not like there were any pictures in general

26:40.660 --> 26:42.660
In our last place either

26:42.660 --> 26:44.660
True

26:44.660 --> 26:46.660
I need lip balm

26:46.660 --> 26:48.660
Do I have it in here

26:48.660 --> 26:50.660
Shit

26:50.660 --> 26:52.660
My lips are dry

26:54.660 --> 26:56.660
We love the rat ASMR

26:56.660 --> 26:58.660
Also you can hear it

27:02.660 --> 27:04.660
We have this part

27:04.660 --> 27:06.660
What is this part

27:08.660 --> 27:10.660
What is this part

27:14.660 --> 27:16.660
I can moisturize them for you

27:16.660 --> 27:18.660
So why

27:18.660 --> 27:20.660
But doesn't moisturize them well enough

27:20.660 --> 27:22.660
I need actual lip balm

27:22.660 --> 27:24.660
But you can kiss them now

27:30.660 --> 27:32.660
Now there are some

27:32.660 --> 27:34.660
Why not of us too

27:34.660 --> 27:36.660
Guess we're just too ugly to be put on display

27:36.660 --> 27:38.660
Right maybe that's it

27:38.660 --> 27:40.660
You're supposed to say I'm pretty

27:40.660 --> 27:42.660
And you're supposed to be robbing the house

27:42.660 --> 27:44.660
Get to it

27:47.660 --> 27:50.660
A bunch of things to interact with

27:50.660 --> 27:52.660
I am interacting with everything I can

27:58.660 --> 28:00.660
I'm interacting with everything

28:00.660 --> 28:02.660
It's the part where the thing happens

28:02.660 --> 28:04.660
Wow okay

28:06.660 --> 28:08.660
Thanks for letting me know I'm so excited for the thing

28:08.660 --> 28:10.660
When the thing happens and the thing

28:10.660 --> 28:12.660
I love it when things happen

28:12.660 --> 28:14.660
In games

28:14.660 --> 28:16.660
Oh the fridge

28:16.660 --> 28:18.660
Not much in the fridge right now

28:20.660 --> 28:22.660
Imagine if the parents came home

28:24.660 --> 28:26.660
You are pretty good

28:26.660 --> 28:28.660
I am

28:28.660 --> 28:30.660
Why does the game

28:30.660 --> 28:32.660
Why does the game OST sound like coffin dance

28:34.660 --> 28:36.660
I don't know

28:36.660 --> 28:38.660
I really like the opening though

28:38.660 --> 28:40.660
Like when you're in the opening screen

28:40.660 --> 28:42.660
I really like that music

28:42.660 --> 28:44.660
There's like nothing to interact with

28:44.660 --> 28:46.660
Who told who lied to me

28:46.660 --> 28:48.660
And said there's a bunch of stuff to interact with

28:48.660 --> 28:50.660
There's nothing

28:50.660 --> 28:52.660
Are you pretty

28:52.660 --> 28:54.660
It's not a question

28:56.660 --> 28:58.660
Flip those two words around

28:58.660 --> 29:00.660
And take off the question mark

29:00.660 --> 29:02.660
It's you are pretty

29:02.660 --> 29:04.660
Get it right

29:04.660 --> 29:06.660
Check downstairs

29:06.660 --> 29:08.660
Oh there's a downstairs

29:08.660 --> 29:10.660
I didn't even see that

29:10.660 --> 29:12.660
Why do they have a bed downstairs

29:12.660 --> 29:14.660
Are you gay

29:14.660 --> 29:16.660
Why are you acting so gay

29:16.660 --> 29:18.660
You are pretty

29:18.660 --> 29:20.660
Thank you for the 420

29:20.660 --> 29:22.660
I am pretty

29:24.660 --> 29:26.660
Yes

29:26.660 --> 29:28.660
I am pretty

29:28.660 --> 29:30.660
More training required

29:30.660 --> 29:32.660
Yeah

29:32.660 --> 29:34.660
Apparently you need to be like clicker trained or something

29:34.660 --> 29:36.660
Like every time you get the compliment right

29:36.660 --> 29:38.660
The prettiest

29:38.660 --> 29:40.660
I mean it's so pretty

29:40.660 --> 29:42.660
Keep saying it

29:42.660 --> 29:44.660
Keep going

29:44.660 --> 29:46.660
How much you are pretty

29:46.660 --> 29:48.660
Very much or extra much

29:48.660 --> 29:50.660
Whichever one is more

29:54.660 --> 29:56.660
They've somehow managed to hoard all this stuff

29:56.660 --> 29:58.660
In a spare bed to boot

29:58.660 --> 30:00.660
Money is clearly no longer an issue

30:00.660 --> 30:02.660
And the extra bed implies there are no issues

30:02.660 --> 30:04.660
In their social life either

30:06.660 --> 30:08.660
What does that mean

30:08.660 --> 30:10.660
Are they swingers

30:10.660 --> 30:12.660
Do they be swinging

30:12.660 --> 30:14.660
String of lights

30:14.660 --> 30:16.660
Metal box

30:16.660 --> 30:18.660
A toilet

30:18.660 --> 30:20.660
This one actually works

30:20.660 --> 30:22.660
Are you gay

30:22.660 --> 30:24.660
Why are you acting so gay

30:24.660 --> 30:26.660
I love Emmys lemonade

30:28.660 --> 30:30.660
Thank you for the 420

30:30.660 --> 30:32.660
Are you gay

30:32.660 --> 30:34.660
Why are you acting so gay

30:34.660 --> 30:36.660
How about moan training instead of clicker training

30:36.660 --> 30:38.660
Moan training

30:38.660 --> 30:40.660
What is moan training

30:40.660 --> 30:42.660
Are you gay

30:42.660 --> 30:44.660
Why are you acting so gay

30:44.660 --> 30:46.660
Today is payday so here is some allowance

30:46.660 --> 30:48.660
For my cute little sister

30:48.660 --> 30:50.660
Thank you for the allowance

30:50.660 --> 30:52.660
All got 3 sips

30:54.660 --> 30:56.660
Okay

30:56.660 --> 30:58.660
Are you gay

30:58.660 --> 31:00.660
Why are you acting so gay

31:00.660 --> 31:02.660
Right now it's your turn to get training

31:06.660 --> 31:08.660
Thank you for the 420

31:08.660 --> 31:10.660
A triple

31:12.660 --> 31:14.660
I will say you are cute

31:14.660 --> 31:16.660
I am cute

31:16.660 --> 31:18.660
Thank you for the compliment

31:18.660 --> 31:20.660
You're doing good

31:20.660 --> 31:22.660
Okay the floor dream seems a little clogged

31:24.660 --> 31:26.660
Fuck

31:26.660 --> 31:28.660
Okay

31:30.660 --> 31:32.660
The floor dream seems a little clogged

31:32.660 --> 31:34.660
But it's not your problem

31:34.660 --> 31:36.660
No, it's not my problem

31:36.660 --> 31:38.660
An excellent quality mop

31:38.660 --> 31:40.660
Okay

31:40.660 --> 31:42.660
Dirty laundry right at the top sits some sexy lingerie

31:42.660 --> 31:44.660
How uncomfortable

31:44.660 --> 31:46.660
Why does it keep telling me

31:48.660 --> 31:50.660
6 out of 10

31:50.660 --> 31:54.660
I think both of those were like a 4 out of 10

31:56.660 --> 31:58.660
Okay

31:58.660 --> 32:00.660
Cleaning supplies such as vinegar

32:00.660 --> 32:02.660
The more you guys tell me to hydrate it

32:02.660 --> 32:04.660
It actually is helping my throat a little bit

32:04.660 --> 32:06.660
I mostly just have to clear it now

32:06.660 --> 32:08.660
A washing machine and a tumble dryer

32:08.660 --> 32:10.660
Your parents have been living it up

32:10.660 --> 32:12.660
Bro I don't even have a washing machine and a tumble dryer

32:16.660 --> 32:18.660
Don't worry about me though

32:18.660 --> 32:20.660
I just

32:20.660 --> 32:22.660
I have like a small tiny washing machine

32:22.660 --> 32:24.660
But I don't have a dryer

32:24.660 --> 32:26.660
And sometimes I go to the laundromat too

32:26.660 --> 32:28.660
Vinegar

32:30.660 --> 32:32.660
Hello

32:34.660 --> 32:36.660
Documents about purchasing a house

32:36.660 --> 32:38.660
There's also a key

32:38.660 --> 32:40.660
Ah dresser key

32:40.660 --> 32:42.660
Okay there we go

32:42.660 --> 32:44.660
The sniffles are always the best

32:44.660 --> 32:46.660
I haven't been sniffling have I

32:46.660 --> 32:48.660
Have you considered drinking water for free

32:48.660 --> 32:50.660
No

32:50.660 --> 32:52.660
No

32:52.660 --> 32:54.660
Why are you here

32:54.660 --> 32:56.660
New and exciting hobbies

32:56.660 --> 32:58.660
Tell me more

32:58.660 --> 33:00.660
I don't think I will

33:00.660 --> 33:02.660
But now it makes sense why mom kept hassling us to move out

33:04.660 --> 33:06.660
They wanted to have sex

33:08.660 --> 33:10.660
What's in there

33:10.660 --> 33:12.660
No jewelry but some paperwork

33:12.660 --> 33:14.660
It reads steer mister and mrs graves

33:14.660 --> 33:18.660
You have opted in for compensation for damages caused by our company's error

33:18.660 --> 33:20.660
Our representative will be glad to meet with you

33:20.660 --> 33:22.660
Please come

33:22.660 --> 33:24.660
Please come discuss the matter further

33:24.660 --> 33:26.660
Are you gay?

33:26.660 --> 33:28.660
At your earliest convenience

33:28.660 --> 33:30.660
Why are you acting so gay

33:30.660 --> 33:32.660
Thank you for the 333

33:36.660 --> 33:38.660
I don't live in a cardboard box

33:38.660 --> 33:40.660
I had to throw

33:40.660 --> 33:42.660
I want to get like an actual like

33:42.660 --> 33:44.660
Like the big ones

33:44.660 --> 33:46.660
Which means I have to like move into an apartment

33:46.660 --> 33:48.660
That already has it

33:48.660 --> 33:50.660
That was my goal

33:50.660 --> 33:52.660
To move into an apartment that has

33:52.660 --> 33:54.660
A laundry

33:54.660 --> 33:56.660
A laundry

33:56.660 --> 33:58.660
A washing machine and a dryer

33:58.660 --> 34:00.660
In-unit

34:00.660 --> 34:02.660
In-unit, yeah

34:04.660 --> 34:06.660
That means any

34:06.660 --> 34:08.660
Pancu hung up

34:08.660 --> 34:10.660
I hang my underwear

34:10.660 --> 34:12.660
Because it's summer I hang it out to dry

34:12.660 --> 34:14.660
It's out for the whole world to see it

34:18.660 --> 34:20.660
I don't wash my hand, no

34:22.660 --> 34:24.660
What's today's color?

34:24.660 --> 34:26.660
That's a great question, I don't even know

34:26.660 --> 34:28.660
Oh, it's um

34:28.660 --> 34:30.660
It's black with a

34:32.660 --> 34:36.660
Pink, purple, green and yellow butterflies

34:38.660 --> 34:40.660
Okay, flipping through the folder

34:40.660 --> 34:42.660
Something else catches your eye

34:42.660 --> 34:46.660
It is the death certificate of Ashley and Andrew Graves

34:48.660 --> 34:50.660
Cute

34:52.660 --> 34:54.660
I didn't know he died 3 months ago

34:54.660 --> 34:56.660
What the hell is this

34:56.660 --> 34:58.660
I guess that explains why mom kept

34:58.660 --> 35:00.660
Telling me not to call

35:00.660 --> 35:02.660
It must have been spooky getting phone calls from a ghost

35:02.660 --> 35:04.660
That's

35:08.660 --> 35:10.660
I'm gonna need art of that later

35:10.660 --> 35:12.660
Someone has entered the house

35:12.660 --> 35:14.660
Oh shit, isn't it too early?

35:14.660 --> 35:16.660
They shouldn't be home yet

35:18.660 --> 35:20.660
You consider shooting whichever parent just came in

35:22.660 --> 35:24.660
But you can't offer the souls of the dead

35:24.660 --> 35:26.660
So you hold off on that idea

35:26.660 --> 35:28.660
Is someone there?

35:28.660 --> 35:30.660
Hi mom, it's just us

35:30.660 --> 35:32.660
Andrew, what is wrong with you?

35:32.660 --> 35:34.660
Don't do that, welcome home

35:34.660 --> 35:36.660
Andrew

35:36.660 --> 35:38.660
What are you doing here?

35:38.660 --> 35:40.660
Why does the mom look so young?

35:42.660 --> 35:44.660
Surprise, we came for a visit

35:44.660 --> 35:46.660
Oh, I see

35:46.660 --> 35:48.660
How are you home so early?

35:48.660 --> 35:50.660
Did you get fired?

35:50.660 --> 35:52.660
It's my day off

35:52.660 --> 35:54.660
I was just out shopping

35:54.660 --> 35:56.660
This is so awkward

35:58.660 --> 36:00.660
Her name is Renee

36:00.660 --> 36:02.660
Oh no, she's hot

36:02.660 --> 36:04.660
Get away from my mother

36:04.660 --> 36:06.660
Oh wait, no

36:06.660 --> 36:08.660
Get away from our mother

36:08.660 --> 36:10.660
It's my day off

36:10.660 --> 36:12.660
I was just out shopping

36:12.660 --> 36:14.660
How did you two get inside?

36:14.660 --> 36:16.660
We broken

36:16.660 --> 36:18.660
You left the door unlocked

36:18.660 --> 36:20.660
You should really be more careful about that

36:22.660 --> 36:24.660
She's 35?

36:24.660 --> 36:26.660
She doesn't look 35

36:26.660 --> 36:28.660
Did I really?

36:28.660 --> 36:30.660
Hey, let me help you with those groceries

36:30.660 --> 36:32.660
This is so weird

36:32.660 --> 36:34.660
Thanks, you should have let me know

36:34.660 --> 36:36.660
You were coming

36:36.660 --> 36:38.660
How about some coffee?

36:38.660 --> 36:40.660
Where do you keep the grounds?

36:40.660 --> 36:42.660
In the top cupboard

36:42.660 --> 36:44.660
But what about the quarantine?

36:44.660 --> 36:46.660
Any milk in yours?

36:46.660 --> 36:48.660
Sure, let me just go wash my face

36:50.660 --> 36:52.660
Hag alert!

36:52.660 --> 36:54.660
You guys think 35 is hag?

36:58.660 --> 37:00.660
Some people age really well, I guess so

37:02.660 --> 37:04.660
How old are the kids?

37:04.660 --> 37:06.660
I don't know, it's a villainess, they don't say

37:06.660 --> 37:08.660
Yeah, he is acting weird

37:10.660 --> 37:12.660
30 is hag

37:14.660 --> 37:16.660
Hag is 40 plus

37:16.660 --> 37:18.660
Yeah, I always felt like hag should be like 40

37:22.660 --> 37:24.660
If I want an old vtuber

37:24.660 --> 37:26.660
I want her to be like my mom's age

37:26.660 --> 37:28.660
Cause I think that's like

37:28.660 --> 37:30.660
That's old

37:30.660 --> 37:32.660
Calling my mom old

37:34.660 --> 37:36.660
And vtubing 30 plus

37:36.660 --> 37:38.660
In Japan it's like 25

37:38.660 --> 37:40.660
In Japan it's like 25

37:40.660 --> 37:42.660
That's so depressing

37:42.660 --> 37:44.660
Andy is like 22 and Ashley is like 20

37:44.660 --> 37:46.660
I believe

37:46.660 --> 37:48.660
I saw some people trying to guess my own age

37:52.660 --> 37:54.660
Some people genuinely think I'm like

37:54.660 --> 37:56.660
Actually pretty old

37:58.660 --> 38:00.660
Do I sound old?

38:00.660 --> 38:02.660
I thought it was obvious

38:02.660 --> 38:04.660
That I'm like a tiktok zoomer

38:04.660 --> 38:06.660
You three

38:10.660 --> 38:12.660
I've been actually drinking water out of my own volition

38:12.660 --> 38:14.660
This is not good

38:16.660 --> 38:18.660
Sure, let me go wash my face

38:20.660 --> 38:22.660
What the hell are you doing?

38:22.660 --> 38:24.660
Just play along for now please

38:24.660 --> 38:26.660
Guess I'll make some coffee

38:26.660 --> 38:28.660
This isn't good

38:28.660 --> 38:30.660
You're 23? I'm not 23

38:34.660 --> 38:36.660
Meat wine

38:36.660 --> 38:38.660
Looks like your fans had a night planned

38:42.660 --> 38:44.660
You sound 18

38:44.660 --> 38:46.660
I'm not 18

38:46.660 --> 38:48.660
Make sure to stay hydrated

38:48.660 --> 38:50.660
I'll thank you for the 420

38:54.660 --> 38:56.660
We didn't know who Nigel Thornberry was

38:56.660 --> 38:58.660
So he can't be that old

38:58.660 --> 39:00.660
Yeah I had to look up who Nigel Thornberry was

39:00.660 --> 39:02.660
Is he from the Rugrats or something?

39:02.660 --> 39:04.660
I'm not sure

39:06.660 --> 39:08.660
Um, you brew some coffee

39:10.660 --> 39:12.660
So I saw the fire on the news

39:14.660 --> 39:16.660
What happened?

39:16.660 --> 39:18.660
Why do you care?

39:18.660 --> 39:20.660
Are you gay?

39:20.660 --> 39:22.660
Why are you acting so gay?

39:22.660 --> 39:24.660
I was informed that a certain darling little sister needed this

39:26.660 --> 39:28.660
Thank you for the 420

39:28.660 --> 39:30.660
Rugrats?

39:30.660 --> 39:32.660
The Wild Thornberries?

39:36.660 --> 39:38.660
Wait, he's not from the Rugrats?

39:40.660 --> 39:42.660
Same production company

39:42.660 --> 39:44.660
Close enough

39:44.660 --> 39:46.660
Yeah, close enough

39:46.660 --> 39:48.660
I haven't heard of the Wild Thornberries

39:52.660 --> 39:54.660
Going down and talking to Rene as Ashley

39:54.660 --> 39:56.660
in the basement has interesting responses

39:58.660 --> 40:00.660
No, not Rugrats

40:00.660 --> 40:02.660
Oh, sorry

40:02.660 --> 40:04.660
I didn't even watch the Rugrats

40:04.660 --> 40:06.660
But that's just because I didn't have cable TV

40:08.660 --> 40:10.660
Pickles is Rugrats

40:14.660 --> 40:16.660
Well first we got evacuated

40:16.660 --> 40:18.660
After that they gave us the go ahead to leave

40:20.660 --> 40:22.660
Since we've been cleared of the parasites anyway

40:22.660 --> 40:24.660
Interesting

40:24.660 --> 40:26.660
Oh this bitch is so

40:26.660 --> 40:28.660
Guilty

40:28.660 --> 40:30.660
She's so guilty

40:30.660 --> 40:32.660
On the news they said everyone died

40:34.660 --> 40:36.660
That would certainly make the story sell more

40:36.660 --> 40:38.660
Anyway, here we are

40:38.660 --> 40:40.660
Neither burnt nor full of parasites

40:42.660 --> 40:44.660
I'm just glad you're safe

40:44.660 --> 40:46.660
No, she's not

40:52.660 --> 40:54.660
Yeah, you sure look like it

40:54.660 --> 40:56.660
So um

40:56.660 --> 40:58.660
Quite the upgrade from our previous place, huh?

41:00.660 --> 41:02.660
She's not guilty

41:06.660 --> 41:08.660
I remember some people want an option to smash the mob

41:08.660 --> 41:10.660
Jail

41:10.660 --> 41:12.660
Jail, rope, noose

41:12.660 --> 41:14.660
Use it, oh my god

41:16.660 --> 41:18.660
Put your head through the loop

41:20.660 --> 41:22.660
And kick the bucket

41:22.660 --> 41:24.660
Where'd you get the money for this place?

41:24.660 --> 41:26.660
Did you finally win the lottery?

41:26.660 --> 41:28.660
Huh, I wish

41:28.660 --> 41:30.660
This house needs some serious repairs

41:30.660 --> 41:32.660
But the area is so worth it, don't you think?

41:34.660 --> 41:36.660
The perfect non-answer

41:36.660 --> 41:38.660
They even hold barbecue events here

41:38.660 --> 41:40.660
With the neighbors

41:40.660 --> 41:42.660
And it's not a happy scene

41:42.660 --> 41:44.660
Sister is okay but mother's note

41:44.660 --> 41:46.660
Yes

41:46.660 --> 41:48.660
Exactly, that's it

41:48.660 --> 41:50.660
You got it right

41:50.660 --> 41:52.660
Barbecue events just like on TV

41:52.660 --> 41:54.660
I thought that was all bullshit

41:54.660 --> 41:56.660
But no, they actually do that stuff here

41:56.660 --> 41:58.660
Why are you acting so gay?

41:58.660 --> 42:00.660
Thank you for the 6-9

42:02.660 --> 42:04.660
My favorite letter

42:04.660 --> 42:06.660

42:06.660 --> 42:08.660
Your D

42:08.660 --> 42:10.660
Okay

42:10.660 --> 42:12.660
Oh, yako-don? I don't know what that means

42:12.660 --> 42:14.660
What's o yako-don?

42:16.660 --> 42:18.660
I'm just gonna say it

42:18.660 --> 42:20.660

42:20.660 --> 42:22.660
I'm just gonna say it

42:22.660 --> 42:24.660
I'm just gonna say it

42:24.660 --> 42:26.660
I'm just gonna say it

42:26.660 --> 42:28.660
Yea

42:30.660 --> 42:32.660
Yeah, sister base mom grows, yea

42:34.660 --> 42:36.660
Oh

42:36.660 --> 42:38.660
But you stick out like a sore thumb

42:38.660 --> 42:40.660
You'd be surprised

42:40.660 --> 42:42.660
I'm actually quite well liked

42:42.660 --> 42:44.660
Oh, it's probably all thanks to my cooking skills

42:44.660 --> 42:46.660
It's a shame

42:46.660 --> 42:48.660
Where I actually didn't hear any

42:50.660 --> 42:52.660
Mother plus daughter

42:52.660 --> 42:54.660
Oh, yako-don is mom and daughter at the same time

42:54.660 --> 42:59.320

43:06.980 --> 43:08.080

43:29.440 --> 43:32.880

ᴢ екотор לים  conditional

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.860
lebrate the trinket charge. We'd atleast have the means to stay safe.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:24.820
I get that but if we leave quietly, there would be no need for anyone to look for us.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:32.020
o. he has his hand on her short-loop

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.020
through her short-loop,세ially

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.020
little bit of torture never killed anyone

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.020
it's killing me

Oh. There isn't enough space in this house.

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:51.620
Despite being far larger than the last one.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:54.620
And you're both already in your 20s.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.620
I don't know how else to say it.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.620
No, no, it's...

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.620
Yeah, we're not fucking planning on living here. Thanks for the invitation, though.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.620
It's not like you're unwelcome to visit.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.620
There's just no room to keep housing you indefinitely.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.620
Yeah, I get it.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.620
I don't got no drip.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:16.620
You don't hear no drip. You're not hearing a drip.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.620
I'm not drippy.

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:22.620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:27.620
Shower, shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:32.620

Shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.620
Sorry, I'll drink.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.620
I'm gonna need to get more water soon.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.620
That's funny because I heard a drip.

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:59.620
Thank you for the 420. You didn't hear it from me.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:04.620
But since you're already here, I guess one night won't be a problem.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.620
We need to start looking for somewhere else to stay first thing in the morning.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.620
And...

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:14.620
Dude, she knows.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.620
And it should probably be two separate places.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.620
Dude, she knows.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:26.620
She knows. She's onto us.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.620
There's a tall order after all our earthly...

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.620
Sorry, sometimes I just have to take a break.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.620
Sometimes I just have to take a break.

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:44.620
It's like getting in waves.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.620
I get it in waves.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:54.620
There's a tall order after all our earthly possessions just burn to the ground.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.620
That's a tall order. Sorry, that's a tall order.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.620
It's amazing what money can buy once you have a job.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.620
Speaking of which, I have a morning shift tomorrow.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:05.620
There's a spare bed in the basement.

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.620
Andrew, you can take the couch.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.620
Alright, good night. Good night.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.620
Well, aren't you going to bed?

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.620
I'm not that tired yet, so you are under my roof right now.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.620
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.620
If you need a break, why not a water break?

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.620
Thank you for the 420.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:29.620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:35.620
The water flows over the falls, the waves crash into the shore, the rain drips off the leaves.

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.620
Thank you for the tip.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.620
You're under my roof right now and you'll go to your designated sleeping areas immediately.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.620
Sleep now or get out at once.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.620
Damn, what a bitch!

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.620
Going to sleep is the worst.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.620
I'm going to sleep at once.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.620
I'm going to sleep at once.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.620
I'm going to sleep at once.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.620
Going to sleep is the worst.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:21.620
During the day, all the noise and Ashley's never ending bullshit keeps your mind occupied.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:26.620
At night, alone with your thoughts, there's nothing to distract you from yourself.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:32.620
Despite having every intention of going to pick a fight with Ashley, you drift off to sleep.

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.620
Oh shit!

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.620
We're in a dream!

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.620
The freezer isn't full of human meat.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.620
Remember how Andrew needs Ashley to hold him to sleep?

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.620
Oh, he has nightmares!

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:58.620
This is definitely going to awaken something in at least one person here.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.620
Thank you for the $1.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.620
Bro, it's awakened something in me.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.620
Okay, I run out of water.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.620
I'm going to go get more. I promise I won't.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:21.620
I won't go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.620
I'll be right back.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.620
I'll be right back.

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.620
I'll be right back.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.620
I'll be right back.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.620
I'll be right back.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:22.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:37.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:41.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:47.620
I'll be right back.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.620
I'm back.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.620
She's not going to make it.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:01.620
I'm going to make it.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.620
I'll make it.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:09.620
P-S-B-S-B-S-B-S-P-S

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:13.620
I did not, I did not, I did not go to the bathroom, I um...

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:14.620
Are you gay?

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.620
Sorry about the water sip, but do you have any tea for your cold?

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:22.620
Uh...

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.620
I don't...

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.620
Are you gay?

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:25.620
Oh my god!

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.620
Thanks for holding it in until now, I'm so proud of you.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:32.620
One...

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:35.620
Two...

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.620
Three...

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.620
Um...

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:46.620
I wanna keep the energy at all right, I wanna keep it at the all right level for now.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.620
I might, I might go down soon though.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.620
It's worse when I'm moving, like when I'm walking it gets worse.

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.620
Okay...

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.620
Okay.

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.620
Okay.

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.620
All right.

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.620
When I'm sitting down it's okay.

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.620
Greetings neighbor.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.620
Have thou arrived to borrow sweet granules of sugar?

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:24.620
Behold, as thou may witness not, but flesh doth I possess to present unto thee.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.620
All ghosts are apparently required to speak like this,

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.620
yes, even the recently passed ones, you read too much poetry.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.620
Ah, he reads poetry, that's cute.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.620
How much for a laugh around the room?

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.620
I don't wanna say too much, I don't want people to get mad at me for saying a large amount.

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.620
Also my room is very small.

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.620
I'll say ten dollars if you want me to...

01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:01.620
Here, I'll say fifteen dollars if you want me to go a whole lap around my entire apartment there.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.620
I'll do a...

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.620
Oh, or jumping jacks.

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:08.620
You can choose which one you want.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.620
Yeah, the same amount cause...

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.620
Maybe, maybe smaller, smaller.

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:20.620
Okay, fifteen dollars for a lap around my apartment, ten dollars for jumping jacks.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.620
There you go.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.620
You read too much poetry.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.620
Be alert, young Mr. Graves.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.620
It is time for you to compartmentalize.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.620
Rookie mistake?

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.620
Why?

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.620
Yeah, five jumping jacks for ten dollars.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.620
There.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.620
Jumping jacks are worse, no?

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.620
Are you gay?

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:53.620
One lap around the room.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:58.620
Okay.

01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.620
Are you gay?

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.620
Easy.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.620
Okay, I'll do the jumping jacks first.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.620
One dollar will just get...

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.620
Are you gay?

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.620
I'm singing in the rain.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.620
Just singing in the rain what a glorious feeling I'm happy again.

01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:19.620
Are you gay?

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.620
Stop!

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.620
Stop!

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.620
Stop!

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:27.620
PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.620
Okay.

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.620
Are you gay?

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.620
Stop!

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.620
How about both?

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.620
Thank you for the hundred dollars.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.620
Okay, I'll do...

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.620
What am I supposed to do for a hundred?

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.620
How about I do twenty jumping jacks there?

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.620
Twenty jumping jacks and then I'll run around the apartment.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:53.620
And when I say apartment, I mean I have to leave the room, but yeah.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.620
Are you gay?

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.620
This is gonna be a workout stream now.

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.620
Okay.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:17.620
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:22.620
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.620
Did I say twenty?

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:26.620
I think I said twenty.

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:31.620
I'm gonna go for a run now.

01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:35.620
Excuse me while I go run around.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.620

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.620
I'm sorry.

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.620
I'm sorry.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:28.620
I don't know why but running is worse.

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.620
Running is like way worse.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.620
I brought chocolate bars though.

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:38.620
You need five more?

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.620
Five more jumping jacks?

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.620
Okay.

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.620
Are you gay?

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.620
Gotta make sure to stay hydrated while exercising.

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:57.620
Okay.

01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:58.620
Are you gay?

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:05.620
Pour me make sure you drink plenty of water after having that major workout.

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:08.620
Are you gay?

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.620
Well after exercising you definitely need to hydrate a bit.

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.620
Okay.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.620
Are you gay?

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.620
How about some more exercise for my sweet sister?

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:27.620
I don't even remember what I was supposed to do.

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:30.620
It's $15 a jumping jacks.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:33.620
Are you gay?

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:38.620
Are you holding it like a good girl?

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.620
Yes.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.620
Yes.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.620
I am.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:44.620
$15 was running?

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:45.620
$15 for a walk?

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.620
Okay.

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.620
I'll just do more.

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:50.620
I'll do it all again.

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.620
I don't remember.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:55.620
I'm so bad at memorizing what I said.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.620
Okay.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:57.620
Are you gay?

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.620
Imagine the relief.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:04.620
Okay.

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:08.620
Five more jumping jacks and then I'll run around.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.620
One.

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:10.620
Two.

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.620
Three.

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:12.620
Four.

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.620
Five.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.620
I'll be right back.

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:28.620
Are you gay?

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:32.620
Sweat the piss out to me.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.620
I'll be right back.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.620
Are you gay?

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.620
Sweat the piss out to me.

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.620
Did I get another jumping jack donation?

01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:12.620
I guess I'll do it again.

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:14.620
One.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.620
Two.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:16.620
Three.

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.620
Four.

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.620
Five.

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.620
Okay.

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:21.620
That's it.

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:22.620
That's all.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.620
I'm not doing any more of the $10.

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:29.620
I'm not doing any more of the $10 or the $15 ones.

01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.620
You could donate $10 or $15 but I'm not doing any more.

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.620
My energy level is no longer all right.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.620
I'm sorry for asking about the lamp but not really.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.620
This is fun.

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.620
Thank you for the 20.

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.620
I'm now at EEC.

01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:00.620
We're only an hour and 22 minutes and I'm now at EEC.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.620
We're at EEC levels.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.620
I ran around the apartment, not the room.

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:10.620
I have more than just my room.

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.620
I brought chocolate.

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:24.620
Are we bullying you too much?

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.620
It's okay.

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.620
That's your job.

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:32.620
That's your job as my brother to bully me.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:36.620
You don't live in a closet?

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.620
No, I don't.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.620
What chocolate?

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:43.620
Right.

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.620
I'm eating Marco Polo.

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.620
It's one of my favorite chocolate brands.

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.620
Okay.

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:50.620
Are you gay?

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.620
Good girl.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.620
Thank you.

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:05.620
Okay.

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:09.620
It's time for you to compartmentalize.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.620
Oh shit, my mouse isn't on the...

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:14.620
Why did it disappear?

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.620
What the hell?

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:18.620
EEC.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.620
There.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.620
Okay.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.620
Take you for the head pass.

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.620
Okay.

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:32.620
Are you gay?

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.620
I wish we could be jumping together.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.620
What do you mean jumping together?

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.620
What do you mean by that?

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:53.620
Jumping together.

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.620
Okay.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:02.620
What's going on?

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.620
Got a limb.

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.620
Oh, do I have to collect all the limbs?

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:16.620
I think you know.

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.620
Explain it to me.

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:24.620
Isn't it so sexy when I dirty talk with a mouthful of chocolate?

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.620
Alright, Ashley already cooked one.

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.620
What?

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.620
What is going?

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.620
Are you gay?

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.620
I hope we'll hold until the end of the game.

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.620
Good luck.

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:53.620
I want to.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.620
Thank you for the tip.

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:59.620
I want to hold, but if you guys keep doing this, I don't know.

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.620
Okay.

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.620
Do we have to find candles?

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.620
Is that Lele?

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.620
I don't answer.

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.620
I don't care.

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:29.620
You're not supposed to exist anymore.

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:30.620
It says who you.

01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.620
You're not the boss of me, Andy.

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:34.620
Forget this.

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:35.620
Huh?

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.620
Do not hurt little Lele.

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.620
I won't.

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.620
Stop following me around, you little shit.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:52.620
Where do I go?

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.620
Oh, it sure is dark that way.

01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.620
Good thing I have these candles.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.620
Great, hand them over.

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.620
No.

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.620
Kill her?

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.620
Kill her?

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.620
Kill her?

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.620
No, I won't, I won't, I won't.

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.620
No, I won't, I won't, I won't ask nicely.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.620
May I have one of the candles please?

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:25.620
Nope.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:26.620
Are you gay?

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:28.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.620
If you can't just go in your piss drawer, I know you have one.

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.620
Piss drawer?

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:37.620
Piss drawer?

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:40.620
I feel like that's some kind of fucking reddit story.

01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:43.620
Like how, like the cum, what was it?

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.620
It was the cum shoebox, right?

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:53.620
Or some guy came in a shoebox like over and over again,

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.620
like every time he came, he came in that specific shoebox.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.620
You know what I'm talking about?

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.620
I don't have a piss drawer.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.620
We have different reddits?

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.620
Unfortunately, yes.

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.620
Okay, some of you guys know.

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.620
I only have so many left.

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.620
If my lemon muffin has no candles,

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.620
I can't pretend it's a cake anymore.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.620
Just eat it.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:34.620
That way you can pretend you ate the cake

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.620
and you don't need candles anymore.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.620
Whatcha eating?

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.620
I'm eating chocolate.

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.620
This is my last one, though.

01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.620
Yeah, the coconut story, too.

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.620
Here's the coconut story

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:48.620
where he fucked the coconut and he, like,

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.620
he, like, fucked the same coconut

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.620
and he kept it under his bed, I think.

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:57.620
And then he, like, looked inside one day

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.620
and it was filled with maggots.

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.620
And he kept it under his bed, I think.

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:04.620
And then he, like, looked inside one day

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:06.620
and it was filled with maggots.

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.620
Come, canut.

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:24.620
Okay, anyway.

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:25.620
It's too precious to eat.

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:27.620
God, you're such a tool today.

01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:28.620
Okay, whatever.

01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.620
Come, warm and squishy on the inside.

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.620
Don't be gross.

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.620
Mmm.

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.620
Where do I go?

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:54.620
Where am I supposed to-

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.620
Oh!

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.620
Okay, well, that did nothing.

01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:06.620
You're welcome.

01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.620
You familiar with kazu marzu?

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:12.620
No, I don't know what that is.

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.620
Mmm.

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:16.620
The face tracking is not good

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:17.620
because it's showing me

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.620
eating with my mouth open like a slob.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.620
Every time I'm eating with my mouth open,

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:22.620
I'm like,

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.620
I'm not actually eating with my mouth open

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.620
like that.

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.620
My mouth is closed.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:35.620
But for some reason,

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.620
it tracks it as if my mouth is open.

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.620
Maybe because my teeth are open

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:41.620
and my mouth is not open.

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:43.620
I'm not actually eating with my mouth open

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.620
like that.

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:46.620
My mouth is closed.

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:50.620
But for some reason,

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.620
my mouth is open.

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.620
Maybe because my chin is moving?

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:54.620
I don't know.

01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:00.620
No, I don't actually eat like that.

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.620
I have chocolate all over my fingers.

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:04.620
Okay.

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:08.620
Ooh, new room!

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.620
No, I want to go to that room.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:17.620
Huh?

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.620
How do we get there?

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.620
Is it tracking your sound?

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:27.620
I don't know.

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:29.620
It's tracking both the sound and my mouth.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.620
How do I get there?

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:33.620
Oh.

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.620
What the fuck?

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.620
Ah, fuck, coughing sucks.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:40.620
I don't like it.

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.620
I don't like how coughing feels right now.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:48.620
What?

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:52.620
What am I supposed to do here?

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.620
Try going right from that path.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.620
Right?

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.620
I can't.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.620
It won't let me.

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.620
Are you gay?

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.620
Some water should help with your cough.

01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.620
Thank you for the 420.

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:16.620
The bottom one.

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.620
I don't know.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:20.620
I don't know.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:22.620
I don't know.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:24.620
I don't know.

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620
I don't know.

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620
I don't know.

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.620
I don't know.

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.620
I don't know.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.620
I don't know.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.620
The bottom one.

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.620
It won't let me go right.

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:45.620
Oh, oh.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.620
Oh.

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:52.620
Oh, it's still on.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.620
Why is it so frustrating like this?

01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.620
Oh.

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:01.620
Oh, there we go.

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:04.620
White noise.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.620
Even in your dreams, the entertainment sucks.

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:10.620
It's supposed to frustrate you.

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.620
Okay.

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:14.620
Huh?

01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:15.620
So what do you want to play today?

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:16.620
Nothing.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:17.620
Go to bed.

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:20.620
Fuck, I have to cough.

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.620
Every time I cough, I feel it, bro.

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:25.620
Boring.

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:27.620
I don't care.

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.620
Go to sleep and never wake up again.

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.620
I don't want to sleep.

01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.620
I want to draw.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:33.620
Draw, then.

01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:34.620
Just don't leave the spot.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.620
I can't draw without my coloring pencils.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:40.620
Well, if I nick myself, I can get red.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.620
I'll get youth pencils.

01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:44.620
Thanks, Andy, you're the best.

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.620
Where am I supposed to find coloring pencils?

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:48.620
Are you gay?

01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:50.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:51.620
Relaxed.

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:52.620
Loose.

01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:53.620
Relieved.

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.620
No.

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.620
I am tensed up.

01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.620
Stressed.

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:00.620
And pent up.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:05.620
Light the candle?

01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:09.620
Okay.

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.620
Oh, oh, I didn't even see that.

01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.620
I was like, what happened with the candle?

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:19.620
Oh, it's this thing.

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.620
Okay.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.620
Talk to Ashley once again.

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:24.620
Oh.

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.620
Better get the colored pencils for her chop chop.

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:31.620
Okay.

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:39.620
Oh, I can't believe you didn't say tight.

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:42.620
I am tight there.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.620
Is that what you want?

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.620
Can I go down this way?

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:52.620
Oh, oh, thank you for making it easy.

01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.620
Someone stares inside the room with an unblinking gaze.

01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:58.620
Colored pencils.

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:00.620
Is that mom?

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:01.620
Julia?

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:04.620
You've been quiet all day. What's up?

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.620
Oh, no, it's nothing.

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:09.620
Or actually I've been thinking about something a lot.

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.620
Is this his ex-girlfriend?

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:15.620
Check the phone at least three times.

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.620
There are things to interact with beside the girl.

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.620
Oh, okay.

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:25.620
Voice mail and imagine you sent them.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.620
Okay, okay, I'll check the phone. Thank you.

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.620
I don't know if I should bring it up.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:38.620
With that much build up, you kind of have to now.

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.620
Well, okay, but please don't get mad.

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:45.620
When have I ever even raised my voice with her?

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.620
You know you can tell me anything.

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:50.620
That face doesn't look like a face I could tell anything.

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:54.620
I talked to my sister about what you said the other day.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:35:00.620
And she agrees with me that maybe it's like maybe it'd be better for Ashley to learn some independence.

01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:04.620
Even if it's just for her own sake, you know.

01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:06.620
What?

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.620
And maybe for our sake too?

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:09.620
What?

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.620
I think it'd be nice if you could stay over more often

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:15.620
and not like always cut things short or cancel on me so much.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.620
Sorry.

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.620
I'm not reprimanding you.

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.620
I can't make her learn anything though.

01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.620
Julia kind of snack?

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:30.620
No, I don't think so.

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.620
She's gotta go.

01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.620
Even laughing.

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:40.620
This is his ex.

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:41.620
Okay, okay, okay.

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.620
If your sister needs something, wouldn't you go?

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:53.620
Well, yes, but she only asks if she actually needs something.

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:56.620
I suppose.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.620
Sorry, maybe I shouldn't have said that or brought this up after all.

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:03.620
No, no, it's fine.

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.620
Finally home from work.

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.620
Hello.

01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:15.620
Um, yeah.

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.620
Ashley is way better.

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.620
Yes.

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:21.620
Yes.

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:22.620
Yes.

01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.620
Yes.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:33.620
Okay, let's keep going.

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.620
Um.

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:42.620
Um, I guess I'm still shook up over what happened to your friend way back then.

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.620
Ashley might not look like it,

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:46.620
but I think it affected her a lot too.

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:49.620
So that's probably why she is how she is.

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.620
I really don't get that impression at all.

01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:57.620
For someone so obnoxious, she's surprisingly difficult to read.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:58.620
Isn't she?

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:03.620
Yeah, Emmys better, Emmys better than this fucking.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:04.620
What's her name?

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:05.620
I don't even remember.

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.620
I don't remember what her name was.

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.620
Julia.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.620
Julia.

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:15.620
Yeah.

01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:17.620
I don't know Julia, only Emmys.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.620
Oh fuck.

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.620
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.620
No, nothing go on.

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.620
Anyways, I worry.

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:41.620
I worry about something like that happening to her or happening to you.

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:46.620
Ew, cringe, get this off of my fucking screen.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.620
It'll be fine if you're with me.

01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:56.620
Ah, would you tie your hair up for me?

01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.620
Interesting.

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.620
Oh heck no, you'll pull on it again.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:09.620
Fuck man, I wanna get excited so badly right now.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.620
But don't you know it's how boys show their love?

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.620
Well that's just awful.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.620
I suppose she still lingers.

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.620
I'm like really rocking in my chair right now, oh my god.

01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.620
It hasn't been that long, I just kind of forgot about her with all the chaos going on.

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:38.620
Mostly death threats.

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:40.620
The phone, the phone, where's the phone?

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.620
Photos and notes of your girlfriend's churches.

01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:44.620
The phone.

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.620
Yeah, he's a hair puller.

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.620
You have 127 new voicemails.

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.620
Oh hell no, you are not listening to all that.

01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:54.620
Yes we are!

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:56.620
I don't know what your fucking problem is.

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:59.620
The audio has been distorted but you'd recognize that voice anywhere.

01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:02.620
I told you to fuck off, I warned you.

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:03.620
Do you think you're all that?

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.620
Do you think you're somehow special?

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:07.620
Ah, should I voice this?

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.620
I'm gonna end up pissing myself if I do.

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620
You're just another whole.

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:18.620
You're not even the only one.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:22.620
He's got a slew of flusies just like you.

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:26.620
Enjoy what you have because you're well on your way out by now.

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.620
The only reason he's with you is because he feels sorry for you.

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.620
You're just some ugly cunt with a dead best friend.

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:37.620
Hurry up and kill yourself!

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:41.620
And when you get to hell, ask your friend what happened to her.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.620
I can't laugh, I can't laugh, I wanna laugh.

01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:46.620
I wanna laugh.

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.620
Bet you'd be, you'd be so surprised.

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.620
Fucking die you worthless piece of shit.

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.620
Oh, you worthless piece of shit, go slit your wrists some more.

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:01.620
And this time do it proper.

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.620
Do you think you're better than me?

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.620
Just because you can fuck him and I can't?

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:08.620
Damn.

01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:10.620
You think that's love?

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:11.620
Are you fucking delusional?

01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:14.620
Come dumpsters like you are just...

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.620
Okay, hold on.

01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.620
Give me like, give me like...

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:24.620
Give me like, fuck.

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:28.620
Okay, give me like, give me like 10 seconds, hold on.

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.620
Wait a minute.

01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:58.620
Are you gay?

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:00.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.620
Take your time.

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:12.620
I really wanna tell you to off yourself right now.

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:22.620
Are you gay?

01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.620
Give you what?

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.620
Are you gay?

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.620
Stop!

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.620
Break the dam, release the river.

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:44.620
You should go jump off a bridge in Minecraft.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.620
Not like you loves me.

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:54.620
I'm the only one.

01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.620
I'm everything.

01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:58.620
I'm the secrets you'll never hear.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:59.620
Are you gay?

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:03.620
Drip drips platter.

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:05.620
Stop!

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:17.620
When he lies in bed at night and when he needs someone to hold on to, it's not you he seeks out.

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.620
It's me.

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:25.620
It's your ex-livers dormitory room.

01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:27.620
Okay, I have to change it.

01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:28.620
I have to change it.

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.620
We're no longer in eek territory.

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:31.620
We're no longer in eek territory.

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.620
We're getting low.

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.620
I know I'm so sorry it's only been two hours.

01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:36.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:38.620
Have you ever been to the Aquarium Mimmy?

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:42.620
It's fun seeing all the gallons and gallons of water sloshing around.

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:50.620
No.

01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:52.620
No, I've never been to the Aquarium and I don't wanna go.

01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:57.620
No, we're not doing a poll yet.

01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:58.620
Are you gay?

01:42:58.620 --> 01:42:59.620
Oh my god.

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:04.620
Anon, I think she might just broken the dam during the mute.

01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:08.620
I mean just look at that cute atomic blush across her cheeks.

01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.620
I didn't, I didn't do it.

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:11.620
I didn't do it.

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:12.620
I didn't break the dam.

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:13.620
I didn't break the dam.

01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.620
Tell us how you're feeling.

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:30.620
I feel like I can't describe it in detail on YouTube.

01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:37.620
I feel very full.

01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.620
That's, that's how I feel.

01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:43.620
Yeah.

01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:46.620
On a scale of 1 to 10, dude, 9.

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:49.620
Tweet it?

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:53.620
What do you hope to find?

01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.620
What do you hope to find in there?

01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:05.620
And the fact that it doesn't really bother you bothers you.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:09.620
I wanted to finish the game today.

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:11.620
I wanted to finish it.

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:18.620
Are you gay?

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:23.620
Imagine how good it will feel to let go though.

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.620
Stop.

01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:25.620
You're just trying.

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.620
You're just trying.

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:31.620
Dude, it's literally, it hasn't even been two hours.

01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.620
Right.

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:35.620
Layla, her crayons.

01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:43.620
You're really going to have to hold my hand a lot for the next few parts of the game until we end because I'm really struggling.

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:44.620
Thank you.

01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:45.620
What should I draw?

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:48.620
I wouldn't want to hinder your artistic genius with my bad ideas.

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:50.620
Good call.

01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:53.620
As a thank you, I'll give you a candle.

01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:56.620
Treat it carefully as if it were me.

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:08.620
I'm lighting it on fire.

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620
Not cool.

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:11.620
That slams for you.

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.620
Boo, you suck.

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.620
Can I wait, hold on.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.620
I'm putting on the crying emoji because that's what I fucking feel right now.

01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:24.620
Are you gay?

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:29.620
Jimmy, you're such a good girl putting out with us.

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:31.620
I know, I am.

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:33.620
You don't deserve me.

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:38.620
Okay.

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:40.620
Okay.

01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:41.620
How about this?

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.620
How about this?

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.620
Because I want to finish the game.

01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:49.620
Or at least get further than I actually am.

01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:52.620
I won't end the stream if I go to the bathroom.

01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:59.620
I'll just keep going and you can tell me to keep drinking and we'll do it all over again.

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:00.620
Okay?

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:05.620
We'll just keep doing it over and over again.

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.620
Because I kind of...

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:09.620
I kind of want to...

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.620
I don't want to...

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.620
Is that okay?

01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:15.620
Double endurance as long as it takes me.

01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:18.620
To at least get close to ending the game.

01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:20.620
You know?

01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:25.620
I want to start a bowl.

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:40.620
Are you gay?

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:42.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:43.620
Hi, Ami.

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:46.620
Are you planning to open up memberships soon?

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:47.620
Yes, tomorrow.

01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.620
There's your bowl.

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.620
Are you gay?

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:57.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:59.620
We don't deserve you at all.

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.620
So thank you for being here, little sister.

01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:02.620
Or in chart.

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:03.620
Or in chart.

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:08.620
Why are 56% saying no?

01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:11.620
Oh my god.

01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.620
Five more minutes?

01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:14.620
I'm not recording.

01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:16.620
I'm not fucking recording.

01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:22.620
Wait.

01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:26.620
I'm gonna pin that one.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.620
Ah dude, it's not...

01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:32.620
Just a little longer.

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:36.620
Are you gay?

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:39.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:41.620
We can drink and refill the lemonade.

01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:46.620
You have to incentivize?

01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:47.620
I'm...

01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:49.620
No matter what I'm not recording.

01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:51.620
Okay, I'll end the poll.

01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:57.620
I'll keep going for a little longer.

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:00.620
Are you gay?

01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.620
Are you gay?

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.620
Stop!

01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:07.620
The other Twitter account exists for a reason.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.620
If we get a surprise post then I'm sure we'll vote yes.

01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.620
Are you gay?

01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:14.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:17.620
I know my little sister can hold it a little longer.

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:22.620
Are you gay?

01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:28.620
Good girl, just a little longer and you can go.

01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:31.620
This is literally blackmail.

01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:36.620
What do I do?

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.620
What do I do right now?

01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:47.620
Are you gay?

01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:49.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.620
Those are some cute moans, Imi.

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.620
You holding up okay?

01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:57.620
Yes.

01:48:58.620 --> 01:48:59.620
Yes, I am good.

01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.620
What do I do? Please tell me what to do.

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:03.620
Are you gay?

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.620
Oh my god.

01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:08.620
Anticipate the release.

01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:10.620
No, no, I'm not anticipating shit.

01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.620
Anticipate these nuts.

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.620
Put the candle in the candle holder.

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:23.620
Oh my god.

01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:29.620
Are you gay?

01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:31.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:32.620
You got this, Imi.

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.620
Databayo.

01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.620
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I have this.

01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:40.620
I have this.

01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:42.620
Ashley would have wanted to kill this one anyways.

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:45.620
You couldn't leave any witnesses after all.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.620
Still you can't comprehend why there hasn't been...

01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:48.620
Are you gay?

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:50.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:53.620
Please tell us if there's any leaking.

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:55.620
There's no leakage.

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:00.620
There's no leakage.

01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:06.620
Surely someone found her before the fire burned the apartment down.

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:08.620
Is there an investigation going on?

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:12.620
Can this be linked back to you?

01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:14.620
Other than that, it doesn't bother you.

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:15.620
I don't know.

01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:16.620
I don't know.

01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:17.620
I don't know.

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:18.620
I don't know.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:19.620
I don't know.

01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:20.620
I don't know.

01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:23.620
Other than that, it doesn't bother you.

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.620
This one you had to get before he got you.

01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:30.620
It worries...

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:33.620
It worries you someone wanted you dead this...

01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:34.620
Uh...

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:45.620
It worries you someone wanted you dead badly enough to hire this guy.

01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:49.620
You killed this one to protect Ashley, no regrets?

01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:57.620
Back when he and his buddies still fed you, this one was always...

01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.620
This one was always leering at her.

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:01.620
Never mind, there's one regret.

01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:03.620
You wish you could have killed him sooner.

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.620
I don't wanna beg.

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:09.620
I don't want to.

01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:11.620
That's so cringe.

01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:13.620
You won't get me too.

01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:15.620
There you are, you menace.

01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:16.620
Tada!

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:18.620
I'm missing the one you cooked.

01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:20.620
I figured you'd have it.

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:26.620
It's in your stomach, right?

01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:27.620
And mine?

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.620
Are you going to cut me up to get it?

01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:31.620
I'd rather not.

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.620
What do you need it for anyways?

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:36.620
There's plenty of limbs right behind you.

01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:37.620
That's true.

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:38.620
That's true.

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:43.620
Okay.

01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:50.620
Yeah, well, before was different.

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:53.620
Before was not as embarrassing.

01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:57.620
Be...

01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:58.620
Be...

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:01.620
Be possessive of the absolute...

01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:02.620
Lim.

01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:06.620
Yeah, it thought not long to me for a chance to have a little...

01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:08.620
Consequence to the...

01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:10.620
Oh my god, I can't laugh.

01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:17.620
Place a limb in the freezer.

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:25.620
What do I do?

01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:31.620
What do I do?

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.620
What do I do?

01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:51.620
Oh my god.

01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:53.620
Dude, it's starting to throb.

01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:54.620
Oh my god.

01:52:58.620 --> 01:52:59.620
Is it here?

01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:02.620
Am I supposed to get this last one?

01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:04.620
Uh...

01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:09.620
Oh.

01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:19.620
That's...

01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:21.620
I reckon that my mortal...

01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:23.620
Uh, frame was consumed...

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.620
By the flames for...

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.620
Forsooth, I do not...

01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:28.620
Need things...

01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:29.620
Need...

01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:30.620
Need...

01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:31.620
Need...

01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:38.620
I gotta cough.

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:39.620
How fuck?

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.620
I'm not coughing, I'm not coughing, I'm not coughing.

01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:44.620
Me thinks the innards of a freezer doth...

01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:45.620
Do...

01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:46.620
Do not...

01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:47.620
Doth...

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:50.620
Not combust per chance and may cook, but to...

01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:52.620
Bro, the words...

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:56.620
The words are coming out of my mouth, but I'm not computing right now.

01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:58.620
Um, me...

01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:02.620
Me thinks the innards of a freezer doth not combust per...

01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:05.620
Per...

01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:08.620
Per chance it may cook, but to burn, I know it's not.

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.620
Uh...

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.620
Uh, verily...

01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:20.620
Verily, the most foolish deed thou hast ever committed

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:24.620
was to leave mine own remains in thine own dwelling.

01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:28.620
Praise the heavens that some soul sought to protect themselves

01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.620
and kindled a flame which engulfed all.

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:37.620
What the fuck is he talking about?

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.620
I don't wanna do it, I'm not doing it, I'm not begging.

01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.620
This reminds me of something.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:49.620
You can't make me...

01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:51.620
What's going on?

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.620
Are you gay?

01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:53.620
Oh fuck you.

01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:57.620
Chat, I'm heading to the bathroom real quick, BRB.

01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:00.620
Stop!

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.620
Okay, um...

01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.620
Thy first sh...

01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:25.620
Thy first shell forever linger in thy memory.

01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:26.620
Oh how...

01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:32.620
Stop!

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.620
Shut up!

01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.620
Don't say that.

01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:36.620
Hi chat, I'm gonna go pee, go...

01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:40.620
I hope you fall in the toilet.

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:46.620
What do I do?

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:47.620
Oh my god.

01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:49.620
What do I do?

01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:55.620
What do I do?

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.620
The freezer?

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:03.620
Okay.

01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:06.620
I don't...

01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:08.620
It doesn't...

01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:17.620
You bag, shut up!

01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:19.620
I went in the...

01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:21.620
I went in the game.

01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:25.620
The chest.

01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:26.620
Okay.

01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:27.620
Are you gay?

01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:28.620
Oh fuck.

01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:29.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:31.620
This is getting good.

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.620
Dude.

01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:55.620
I'm gonna do another fall.

01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:57.620
Oh god.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:01.620
I don't know how long it's been since the last one, but I have to.

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.620
I won't end the stream, don't worry, but...

01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:21.620
I don't wanna beg though.

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.620
I don't wanna beg.

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:26.620
I'm not gonna do it.

01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:27.620
That's all you'll get.

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.620
You'll get that shitty plaz.

01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:30.620
Plaz.

01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:32.620
Oh shit, it's so close.

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.620
Oh my god.

01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:43.620
Gay?

01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:46.620
NSFW Twitter.

01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:48.620
Remember it.

01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:51.620
Not recording it.

01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:53.620
No.

01:57:57.620 --> 01:57:58.620
Fuck.

01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:03.620
Okay.

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:06.620
Ah!

01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:07.620
Oh my god.

01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:10.620
Ah!

01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:11.620
Okay.

01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:13.620
Did you have a fun night?

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:15.620
I'm sure you...

01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:17.620
I sure hope you learned your lesson.

01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:18.620
There's no answer.

01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.620
I guess she's still sleeping.

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:24.620
Are you gay?

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:26.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:27.620
Good girl.

01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:29.620
You're doing so great.

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:31.620
This ain't fun anymore.

01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:33.620
It's fun to me.

01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.620
It's okay if it's not for you.

01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:40.620
You can go catch another stream, but it's fun to me.

01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:41.620
Don't worry.

01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:42.620
Don't worry.

01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:46.620
I know I look like I'm struggling, but I promise you I'm having fun.

01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:49.620
I'm having so much...

01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.620
I'm having so much fun right now.

01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:55.620
Yeah, stop being a little pussy.

01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:56.620
It's okay.

01:58:57.620 --> 01:58:59.620
Lily kicks the crate.

01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:00.620
Wake up, sleepyhead.

01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:01.620
Are you gay?

01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:02.620
Oh my god.

01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:03.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:04.620
Sleush.

01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:09.620
Come on, don't.

01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:10.620
You open the crate.

01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:14.620
Oh, she's dead in there.

01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:15.620
Oh my god.

01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:17.620
Okay.

01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:20.620
Are you gay?

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.620
Oh fuck.

01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:22.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:27.620
See, she's enjoying thinking about toilets and faucets and dripping water.

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:30.620
Are you gay?

01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:31.620
Oh my god.

01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:34.620
Shut up, Grinit.

01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.620
Just enjoy the bratty sister's dream.

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:40.620
Are you gay?

01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:41.620
Stop!

01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:42.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:43.620
Please!

01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:44.620
Only one way out.

01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:46.620
Just a few simple words.

01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:50.620
Are you gay?

01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:52.620
Why are you acting so gay?

01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:55.620
Good to know I was starting to feel bad.

01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:00.620
Are you gay?

02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:01.620
Why are you acting so gay?

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:02.620
Stop!

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:03.620
Please!

02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:06.620
Just a pair of words and all your problems will flush away me.

02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:10.620
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, let me go, please.

02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:12.620
Please, I'll even...

02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:13.620
Are you gay?

02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:14.620
I won't record it, but I'll say Big Brother.

02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.620
Please, Big Brother, let me go, please, please, please, please, please.

02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:17.620
Good girl.

02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:18.620
I'm happy you're enjoying it.

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:19.620
Please!

02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:21.620
You're certainly not the only one enjoying it.

02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:23.620
Your moans are very cute.

02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:24.620
Are you gay?

02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:25.620
Oh my god, please.

Why are you acting so gay?

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:29.620
You can hug on a little longer, can't you?

02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:34.620
Are you gay?

02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:35.620
Oh my god, stop!

02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:36.620
Why are you acting so gay?

02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:40.620
She loves that only her brother has access to the toilets.

02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:43.620
Okay.

02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:44.620
Are you gay?

02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:46.620
Why are you acting so gay?

02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:53.620
I wonder for exactly how long the pressure of all the liquid trying to break containment has been having other effects on Little League yummy.

02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:54.620
Are you gay?

02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:55.620
Oh my god!

02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:57.620
Why are you acting so gay?

02:00:57.620 --> 02:00:59.620
That toilet in the other room.

02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:00.620
It's beckoning you.

02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:02.620
Okay, it's a yes, right?

02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:03.620
It's a yes.

02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:04.620
Please say yes.

02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:05.620
It's a yes.

02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:06.620
I can go right...

02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:08.620
Oh my god!

Why are you acting so gay?

02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:10.620
Think of your big brother and...

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:12.620
You're really pushing me for the last minute, aren't you?

02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:16.620
Okay.

02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:17.620
Are you gay?

02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:18.620

Why are you acting so gay?

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.080
Don't act like a brat after we were nice to you.

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:41.080
You weren't nice though.

02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:48.080
Are you gay?

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.080
Oh my god, it just keeps going.

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:56.080
Yes, I am.

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:01.080
I'm sorry for the weirdos here.

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:03.080
What do you mean?

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:04.080
I'm part of them.

02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:06.080
We're all weirdos here.

02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:09.080
We're definitely too soft.

02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.080
Yeah, you were a little...

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:14.080
You kind of gave in a little quickly there, didn't you?

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:17.080
I don't know, I feel like you went a little fast.

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:18.080
You kind of...

02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:21.080
You're a little too easy.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:27.080
Okay.

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:30.080
Uh-uh.

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:36.080
Okay.

02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:39.080
Wait, wait, what?

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:40.080
Why is she dead?

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:42.080
How did...

02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.080
Wait, what?

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.080
That can't be right.

02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:46.080
What's going on?

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:48.080
Whatever.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:50.080
If you're so weak that you died just like that,

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:52.080
then clearly nature doesn't want you to live.

02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:57.080
I'm not a brat, I'm just telling you how it is.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:00.080
Oh this brat.

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:03.080
Angry, angry, angry, crying face.

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:04.080
Get hydrated.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:06.080
Are you gay?

02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:07.080
Oh my god, what?

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:10.080
Good girl.

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:11.080
See?

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.080
Begging always works out for big brother,

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.080
but it can't be helped.

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:16.080
You're just too cute.

02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:19.080
Now with that, let's get around to started properly.

02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:20.080
Are you gay?

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.080
Oh my god.

02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:23.080
Thank you so much.

02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.080
I hope you didn't leave a trail when you went,

02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:27.080
but now I know not to go easy

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:29.080
on you little brat you need correcting.

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:31.080
Gay?

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:35.080
Start drinking, angry.

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.080
I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking.

02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.080
Yeah, they're really going crazy.

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:44.080
Okay.

02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:45.080
Are you gay?

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.080
Oh my god.

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:48.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.080
Noted, we won't be as merciful next time.

02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:56.080
I'm sure you'll give in just as easily next time.

02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:57.080
I'm sure you will.

02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:00.080
You can't help yourself when it comes to me.

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.080
Okay, if you're so weak that you died just like that,

02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.080
then clearly nature doesn't want you to live.

02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:07.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:08.080
Shut up, just shut up.

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:10.080
Let's get through that second bottle.

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:16.080
Okay, forget this.

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:18.080
Let's just sleep right here.

02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:21.080
Lesson learned.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.080
No pissing for the next four hours.

02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:24.080
Four.

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:26.080
Four?

02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:28.080
You're not gonna make it to four.

02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.080
Are you enjoying this?

02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:33.080
Yes?

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:34.080
Are you not?

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:36.080
Are you gay?

02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:38.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:39.080
Good job sis.

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:43.080
Thank you.

02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.080
Okay, since you took the stick off,

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:49.080
it looks like she went there on her own anyways.

02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:51.080
No, it doesn't.

02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:53.080
Why would she have clawed at the crate

02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:55.080
until her fingernails...

02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:59.080
until her fingernails split if she was there willingly?

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.080
Oh well.

02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:05.080
It's not like anyone knows she's here.

02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:06.080
Let's just leave her.

02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:09.080
No, it'll start rotting.

02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:11.080
And someone will come looking in front of her.

02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:13.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.080
I love my little sister.

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:17.080
I love my big brother.

02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:20.080
Are you gay?

02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:22.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:24.080
No more pissing this stream

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:26.080
that you're gonna need to beg proper to go.

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:29.080
I did though. I did.

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:30.080
Are you gay?

02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:32.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:33.080
Oh my god.

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.080
We will remember.

02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:37.080
Good.

02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:38.080
Remember.

02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.080
Is there a punishment for you

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:47.080
if you go without permission?

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:49.080
I won't go without permission.

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.080
Let's just hide it then.

02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:53.080
Huh?

02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:55.080
If no one knows then it's not a problem.

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.080
They're gonna know, Lele.

02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:59.080
We'll find the body and they'll know.

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:01.080
And then they'll throw me in prison for the rest of my life.

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:02.080
Me too.

02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:04.080
It's fine if it's the both of us.

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:06.080
No, you fucking idiot.

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:07.080
You don't get it, do you?

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:09.080
Guys and girls don't go to the same prison.

02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:11.080
They're going to take you away from me.

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:14.080
Oh, he doesn't want me to go.

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:16.080
That's so sweet.

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:18.080
How is I supposed to know that?

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:19.080
You figure something out then.

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:22.080
Oh, you figure something out then since you're so smart.

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:25.080
Okay, okay, let's just...

02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:31.080
Um, like, move her somewhere.

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:34.080
Yes, agree, let's dig up a grave for her.

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:35.080
Alright, where?

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.080
Anywhere in the forest should be fine.

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:39.080
I mean, there's a park right outside.

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:42.080
Yeah, there's probably fine.

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:47.080
But first we need to wrap her up in something.

02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:51.080
Because no one can see us carry her there.

02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.080
This tarp.

02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:55.080
This tarp.

02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:57.080
This will have to do.

02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:02.080
You wrap Nina's corpse inside the tarp and carry her away.

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:11.080
I couldn't find a shovel, but I figured these wooden planks work.

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.080
I mean, they're kind of shovel-y.

02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:14.080
Just watch for splinters.

02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:16.080
Splinters are the least of my worries right now.

02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:19.080
Let's pick a good easy-to-dig spot.

02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.080
Got a wooden plank.

02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.080
They are so cute.

02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:31.080
They're so cute, I say, as they're, you know,

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:36.080
burying a corpse that they just murdered.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:42.080
You'd help me bury a body?

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:44.080
Aw, thank you.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.080
Okay, maybe here.

02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:49.080
There doesn't seem to be any roots in the way.

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.080
I'm tired.

02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:53.080
Yeah, this is way harder than I thought it would be.

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:56.080
Isn't this steep enough already?

02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.080
A grave should be six feet, right?

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:01.080
Forget it, she fits here just fine.

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.080
Okay, fine.

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.080
Put her in!

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.080
Roll her in.

02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.080
Push the body into its grave.

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:11.080
Cover her up.

02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:15.080
Are you gay?

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:19.080
You're so cute.

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.080
Thank you, I am cute.

02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:28.080
I'm gonna have to get more water soon.

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.080
Crap, this doesn't look...

02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.080
Crap, this doesn't look natural at all.

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:35.080
Looks fine to me.

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:38.080
No, there can't be this obvious of a spot.

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:40.080
It needs to be hidden too.

02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:44.080
Why not hide it with some leaves and such?

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:48.080
This isn't gonna work, we're gonna get caught.

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.080
More foliage?

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.080
This one.

02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.080
Is this enough?

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.080
More?

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.080
Greedy?

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:09.080
Is that enough?

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.080
Yeah, this looks so much better, huh?

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:16.080
Also, this is getting blown away by the next breeze.

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:19.080
I'm drinking along, this is pretty hard.

02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:21.080
It is!

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:23.080
This little brat needs correcting.

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.080
Okay, I ran out of water, I'll go get more.

02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:33.080
This is the first time we ever heard her name though.

02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:35.080
It was always blinked up before.

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.080
Oh, yeah, you're right.

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:39.080
You're right.

02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:42.080
Okay, BRB.

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:46.080
I should take this one.

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:53.080
I should take my nasty wrappers with me too.

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:21.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:23.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:25.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:27.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:29.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:31.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:33.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:37.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:41.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:43.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:45.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:47.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:49.080
I'm gonna take this one.

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:01.080
Are you gay?

02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:03.080
Why are you acting so gay?

02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.080
Damn I miss the sounds you were making before.

02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:07.080

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:46.160

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.160
did you know that if you don't know

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:52.160
did you know that if you don't think about something

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:54.160
for a really long time

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:56.160
it's like it never happened

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:58.160
because you can't remember it anymore

02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:00.160

02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:02.160

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:06.160
let's forget all about it

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:08.160

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:12.160

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:14.160
why are you acting so gay

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:16.160
I'll go back in the cage later

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:18.160
just playing with little sisaran

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:20.160
I'm going to put you in the cage myself

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:22.160
you think I won't?

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.160

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:26.160
promise me this day is between us

02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:30.160
I just said we'll forget all about it

02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:34.160

02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:36.160

02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:46.160
I'll make it worse in the cage

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:52.160
um

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.160
I won't say anything

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:00.160
I'll never even say her name again

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.160
what was it anyways

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:04.160

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.160
if you won't do what I say

02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:18.160
I'll tell everyone all about what you did

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.160
who's going to play with you if I'm in jail

02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.160
I'll send you letters

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:28.160
I can't read your crappy handwriting

02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:30.160
the cage is quite comfy once you get used to it

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:32.160
oh yeah the cage is comfy compared to what I'm going to do to you

02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:38.160
she'll never say anything again

02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.160
mmm that makes sense

02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:42.160
that makes sense

02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:46.160

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.160
what I say then

02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:50.160
guess you'll be all alone in prison

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:52.160
I'm your best friend from now on

02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.160

02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:56.160

02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.160
are you gay?

02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:00.160
why are you acting so gay

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:02.160
put me in the cage and pull on my leash

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.160
little sis I've been a bad dog

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:10.160
I will

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:14.160
if that's what you want

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:16.160
but you know

02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:18.160
don't get mad at me if I start doing a little more

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:20.160
because you asked for it okay

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:34.160
okay

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.160
whatever it's you and me now

02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:38.160
no one else will like you

02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.160
because you're bad

02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:42.160
she's going to beg you

02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:48.160
oh yeah I will

02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:52.160
and it won't be two inches

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.160
it won't be two inches

02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:04.160
that's for sure

02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:06.160
I'm kidding don't worry

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:10.160
you're a bad person Andy

02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.160
but I won't tell anyone

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:16.160
of course not

02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:18.160
you'll be in trouble too

02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:20.160
so what no one likes me anyways

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:24.160
um that's fine

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:26.160
because you'll be around now

02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:28.160
are you gay?

02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:30.160
why are you acting so gay

02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:32.160
how much do I gotta pay to get put in the cage

02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:36.160
it's for free don't worry

02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:40.160
you just have to misbehave

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:42.160
and I'll put you in the cage

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.160
I can't tell if these are retracted

02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:46.160
or removed messages

02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:48.160
I think some stuff is getting deleted

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:50.160
because I'm being a little sussy right now

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:52.160
the whole three inch more

02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:54.160

02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:58.160
you stay away from my bum

02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:00.160
I'll stay away from your bum

02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:02.160
if you behave

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:04.160
okay anyways

02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:06.160
god you stupid stupid girl

02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:08.160
you've been you've been here this whole time

02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:10.160
none of this needs to happen

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:12.160
okay just

02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:14.160
I know you don't like me

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:16.160
Andy I know

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:18.160
but that doesn't matter anymore

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.160
because from now on no one will like you either

02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:22.160
is the cage at least padded on the floor

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:24.160
no why would I do that

02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:26.160
why would I pad it

02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:28.160
the point of the cage is to be a punishment

02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:30.160
why would I pad it why would I make it comfortable

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.160
the point is that you're you know you're sad in there

02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:34.160
and you want me to let you out

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:38.160
it's supposed to be like you know conditioning you

02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:40.160
are you gay

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:42.160
why are you acting so gay

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:44.160
how much to finish the bottle

02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:46.160
I can't I can't I can't

02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:48.160
I can't

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:50.160
I have to do it slowly

02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:52.160
I'm not trying to get water poisoning here

02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:56.160
yeah the point is

02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:58.160
you know when you're alone in that cage you're sad

02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:00.160
and anytime I come

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:02.160
and let you out you get happy

02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:04.160
so that way you associate me with happy feelings

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:06.160
happy feelings

02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:08.160
yeah

02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:14.160
anyways uh so let's be

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:16.160
let's always be friends okay

02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:18.160
be my friend or else

02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:20.160
sigh

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:22.160
damn bro she's blackmailing him

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:24.160
I thought it was just to make sure

02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.160
I don't go into the neighbors garden again

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:28.160
that too but don't worry

02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:30.160
the doors and the windows are locked for that

02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:32.160
I'll be whatever you want me to be

02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:34.160
really

02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:36.160
then from now on let's always

02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:38.160
be together

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:40.160
you had a million things you wanted to say to this creature

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:42.160
none of which were pleasant

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:44.160
but absolutely nothing came out of your mouth

02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.160
several days

02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:50.160
aren't you gay

02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:52.160
why are you acting so gay

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:54.160
3 inches

02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:56.160
impressive

02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:58.160
I'd expect no less from my cute sister

02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:00.160
sigh

02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:02.160
shut up it's more than that

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:08.160

02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:10.160
just give me a nicotine addiction

02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:12.160
no

02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:14.160
the only thing you're allowed to be addicted to is me

02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:16.160
no

02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:20.160

02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.160
go for it

02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:24.160
huh really

02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:26.160
I can't seem to eat anything lately

02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:28.160
nom nom

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:30.160
why do they have to put this jam thing

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:32.160
in strawberry ice cream is gross

02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:34.160
I wish there was no jam

02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.160
oh my gosh she's just like me I hate jam

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:40.160
emi is the only drug anyone needs

02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:42.160
exactly

02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:44.160
emi before you go through this

02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:46.160
apartment scene check the balcony for

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:48.160
a revealing scene

02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:50.160
okay

02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.160
has anyone asked you about things

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:56.160
yeah my teacher asked everyone in class

02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:58.160
some officers came by too

02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:00.160
and did you say anything

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:02.160
nope I only asked julia if she was expecting to see anyone the other day

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:04.160
why

02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:06.160
you know because a certain someone told her mom

02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:08.160
she went to study with julia

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:10.160
so I thought maybe she told julia she was

02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:12.160
gonna come see you instead

02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:14.160
wait well did she

02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:16.160
I don't know because I didn't want to just come out and ask

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:18.160
okay wait the plot is confusing me

02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:26.160
julia said she was visiting family that day

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:28.160
so I doubt she had any idea

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:30.160
your promises mean fucking nothing

02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:32.160
huh why are you being so cold to me

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:34.160

02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.160

I'll see what they've got for me at the unemployment office

02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:58.160
great toxin

02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:02.160
is that it is that what you wanted

02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:04.160

02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:06.160

02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:12.160
your success story is such an inspiration to us all

02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:14.160
before starting your soda company

02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:16.160
you used to be a surgeon isn't that right

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:18.160
that's right mark I am actually a doctor

02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:20.160
so trust me one can

02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:22.160
one can of toxa soda a day keeps me

02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.160
far far away

02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:26.160
even

02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:28.160
when even a doctor tells me to indulge how can I not

02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:30.160
surely it's only up from here

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:32.160
what plans do you have for the future

02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:34.160
well first of all with such a great demand

02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:36.160
comes a great need for

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:38.160
water

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:40.160
which is why I've partnered up

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:42.160
with several water distribution companies

02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:44.160
I hope this is the start of a long lasting friendship

02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:46.160
where the people on TV

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:48.160
rank on and on you're relieved there's absolutely nothing

02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:50.160
about dead girls being found

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:54.160

02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:30.160
keep my secret and I'll keep you company

02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:32.160
and what if I don't

02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:34.160
are you ok

02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:36.160
why are you acting so gay

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:38.160
just one more

02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:42.160
ok

02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:48.160
you're all bark you wouldn't do anything

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:50.160
if you'll ruin my life anyways

02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:52.160
what reason is there for me to keep up appearances

02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:56.160
moreover I'm doing this for you

02:30:56.160 --> 02:30:58.160
then what happens if you break the promise

02:30:58.160 --> 02:31:00.160
if you won't

02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:04.160
I'm not buying that

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:06.160
Lele you're a miserable loathsome being

02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:08.160
that has warmed its way into every aspect of my life

02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:10.160
hell yeah I am

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:12.160
and for that my heart will always

02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:14.160
have a rotten moldy sore spot just for you

02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:18.160
make up about what you wrote

02:31:18.160 --> 02:31:20.160
why are you acting so gay

02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.160

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:24.160
ok one more

02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:26.160

02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:28.160
oh my god

02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:30.160
why are you acting so gay

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:32.160
do it

02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:36.160
pack gently you asshole

02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:38.160
how does one cut someone gently

02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:42.160
a better man would know

02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:44.160
whatever

02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:48.160
oh my god

02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:52.160
oh my god

02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:54.160
why am I attracted to this

02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:58.160
gay

02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:00.160
only as long as you keep your eyes on me

02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:02.160
one more after that I mean

02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:04.160
oh ok

02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:06.160
one more

02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:12.160
I wish you liked her lips after that she probably did

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:18.160
let no hussy steal your gays it's just us now

02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:20.160
I said I'd be around

02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:22.160
I never said there wouldn't be others

02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:24.160
what do you mean by that

02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:26.160
no I want to do over

02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:28.160
too late a promise is a promise

02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:30.160
Andy that's not fair

02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:32.160
don't be like that I'll make you a priority

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:34.160
just not the only one

02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:36.160
shut up I am the only priority

02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:38.160
it's not enough why can't we just

02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:40.160
kill our parents

02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:44.160
hold on that's not what she said back then

02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:48.160
do it for your cute little sister

02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:50.160
kill them to solve all your problems

02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:58.160
yes in a proper relationship only blood matters

02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:04.160
kill them to feel something

02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:06.160
kill them for food

02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:14.160
that's actually so funny

02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:16.160
kill them to avoid the things

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:18.160
kill them to avoid the things

02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:20.160
I'll do to you if you don't

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:22.160
what is that supposed to mean

02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:26.160
look who's awake

02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:30.160
she's just whispering in his ear to kill his parents

02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:32.160
or night it's still night time

02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:34.160
what do you want you little creep

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:36.160
to offer mom and dad to the demon

02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:38.160
right now

02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:40.160
right now while they're asleep

02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:42.160
we'll set the ritual up and do it

02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:44.160
I've given you plenty

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:46.160
enough time to figure this out

02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:48.160
yet you haven't

02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:52.160
it's always hot when Amy

02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.160
whispers things to me

02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:56.160
so now we're doing it

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:58.160
kill your parents kill your parents kill your parents kill you

02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:00.160
okay don't actually um okay

02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:04.160
oh my my efforts were far more affected

02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:06.160
than I thought welcome back Andy

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:08.160
that's not it but you have a point

02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:10.160
that mom might cinch on us

02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:12.160
I knew that even before we got out of our apartment

02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:14.160
I don't know why I let myself

02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:16.160
think anything else after talking to her

02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:20.160
just because at your core

02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:22.160
oh it's because at your core

02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:24.160
you're just a soft gooey marshmallow

02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:26.160
if it weren't for me

02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:28.160
all kinds of vile women would have

02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:30.160
gobbled you up already

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:32.160
chomp

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:34.160
awww

02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:36.160
what are you doing a demonstration

02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:38.160
you're so fucking dumb

02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:40.160
I should

02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:44.160
uh oh uh oh Andrew

02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:46.160
are you still awake

02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:48.160
yeah

02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.160
we totally weren't cuddling or anything

02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:52.160
yeah why are you still up

02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:54.160
I thought you had work tomorrow

02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:56.160
I wanted to talk to you

02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:58.160
without Ashley

02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:00.160
it's not really a good time right now

02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:02.160
I know it's late but this is important

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:04.160
I've been thinking things over

02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:06.160
and I believe I owe you an explanation

02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:10.160
that's alright

02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:12.160
I don't really need to know

02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:14.160
I'm really tired

02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:18.160
Andrew I understand if you're angry

02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:20.160
but at least listen

02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:22.160
the whole situation with Ashley was

02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:24.160
oh

02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:26.160
oh go on mom

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:28.160
don't mind little me

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:34.160
for the love of god

02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:36.160
this had better not be what it looks

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.160
like

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:40.160
the way he has a pillow on his crotch

02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:44.160
the way he has a pillow on his crotch dude

02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:46.160
oh my god

02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:48.160
I love this

02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:52.160
whatever

02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:54.160
how does this look to you

02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:58.160
where'd you get

02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:00.160
what's it looking like now mom

02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:02.160
Ashley come on

02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:04.160
Ashley put that away

02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:06.160
there's no need for this

02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.160
oh my god

02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:10.160
be quiet and start walking

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.160
we're going to the basement

02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:14.160
and don't get any funny ideas

02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:16.160
because I will shoot

02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:20.160
and the hand over the bite mark

02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:22.160
on his cheek oh shit

02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:24.160

02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:32.160

02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:34.160
sigh

02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:36.160

02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.160

02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:44.160
there's some rope in the closet

02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:46.160
along with other equipment

02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:48.160
I wonder if this is fine

02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:50.160
as you untangle the rope from everything else

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:52.160
oh shit

02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:54.160

02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:08.160
dad is already busy killing himself

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:10.160

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:18.160

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.160
rope burns on his surface

02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:28.160

it tells you the pin and you scribble it down on a note

02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:50.160

to blow up in our faces

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:52.160

02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:50.160

02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:52.160

02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:54.160

02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:08.160

02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:10.160
yeah well guess what

02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:12.160
now we all get to witness the wonders

02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:14.160
of a customer service

02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:16.160

02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:28.160
it's not fun

02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:30.160
actually take her to the phone

02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:32.160

02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:46.160
has just opened for the day

02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:48.160

02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:00.160
why are you acting so gay

02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:02.160
feeling it now

02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:04.160
a little bit

02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:08.160
you underestimate how schizo we are

02:52:10.160 --> 02:52:12.160
I think at first I did underestimate how schizo you are

02:52:12.160 --> 02:52:14.160
but I think I know now

02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:16.160
I think I'm pretty aware now

02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:18.160
please hold

02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:20.160
a representative will be with you as soon as possible

02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:24.160
please hold the representative

02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:26.160
will be with you as soon as possible

02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:30.160
oh my god

02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:32.160
oh sorry

02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:34.160
let me just confirm

02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:36.160
you said you want me to remove the drawl in my altogether

02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:38.160
that is what I said yes

02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:40.160
wow that's crazy

02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:42.160
what if your card gets sold

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:44.160
indeed

02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:46.160
I'm not at all being held

02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:48.160
at gunpoint here

02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:50.160
there we go your gold

02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:52.160
is there anything else I could help you with

02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:54.160
apparently not

02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:56.160
alright then have a nice day mrs graves

02:52:56.160 --> 02:52:58.160
now it's back into the basement with you

02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:00.160
and don't think for a second I didn't see the stunt you were trying to pull there

02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:04.160
it was just small talk

02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:06.160
shut up

02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:08.160
poor

02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:10.160
small talk this dick

02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:12.160
tie up get tied up

02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:14.160
get tied up

02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:16.160
do I talk to Andrew

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:18.160
the card should be freed now

02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:20.160
unlike your mother whom Andrew quickly ties back up

02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:24.160
oh right

02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:26.160
is it too schizo yet

02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:28.160
no not yet

02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:30.160
not yet

02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:32.160
you match your schizo levels pretty well though

02:53:32.160 --> 02:53:34.160
you think so

02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:36.160
that's good

02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:38.160
I think I'm gonna change the energy level though

02:53:38.160 --> 02:53:40.160
cause

02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:42.160
actually I'm pressin button

02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:46.160
cause I'm no longer getting an alright

02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:48.160
and I think I'm gonna

02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:52.160
trust Andrew at all costs

02:53:52.160 --> 02:53:54.160
oh fuck

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:56.160
already

02:53:56.160 --> 02:53:58.160
okay

02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:06.160
I already figured out as much

02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:08.160
so I sketched them out for you

02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:10.160
why didn't you just draw the runes themselves

02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:12.160
there's blood right there

02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:14.160
because you might have had a good reason

02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:16.160
for not drawing them yet

02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:18.160
fair whatever give me the card

02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:20.160
I'll go pick up the rest of the money

02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:22.160
I'll do the 2007

02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:24.160
what's the 2007

02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:26.160
why are you acting so gay

02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:28.160
I'll stop taking my meds

02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:30.160
if it's for me

02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:32.160
no

02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:34.160
just because I don't take my meds

02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:36.160
doesn't mean you don't have to

02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:38.160
or doesn't mean you shouldn't

02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:40.160
are you gay

02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:42.160
why are you acting so gay

02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:44.160
kidney cleansing stream

02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:46.160
so

02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:50.160
once we reach low

02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:52.160
I'll do the 200

02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:54.160
what do you mean the 200

02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:00.160
I really don't like the idea

02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:02.160
of you wandering around all by yourself at this hour

02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:04.160
it's already morning though

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:06.160
well yeah but I mean still

02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:08.160
just hand me the card

02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:10.160
actually can I really leave Andrew alone with mom and dad

02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:12.160
who knows what they'll say to him

02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:14.160
I just wish he was she enough as it is

02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:16.160
Ashley

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:18.160
you wonder if you can trust Andrew enough to leave him alone with your parents

02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:22.160
should I save

02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:26.160
okay we're trusting Andrew

02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:30.160
just give me the card

02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:32.160
I'll go get the money

02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:34.160
okay please be careful

02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:36.160
aren't I always

02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:38.160
when are you ever see you later

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.160
it'll be fine he won't turn on me as long as I have the trinket

02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:44.160
save to be safe

02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:46.160
I did save

02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:50.160
there's nothing you can do about the missing audio

02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:52.160
but at least you can draw some missing runes

02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:56.160
where did Ashley get all this blood

02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:58.160
from mama

02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:00.160
is she making you do this

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.160
no are you going to kill us

02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:04.160
come on of course not

02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:06.160
technically anyways

02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.160
then what is all this witchcraft looking nonsense

02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:10.160
just let her scare you a little

02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:12.160
we'll leave you alone after that

02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:14.160
how about that

02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:16.160
or how about it

02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:18.160
trust in Ashley now

02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:20.160
don't listen to mom

02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:22.160
okay

02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:24.160
I won't

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:26.160
it's hard to say whether she believes you or not

02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:32.160
it hits you then that you're just like him

02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:34.160
just like him

02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:38.160
god damn it

02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:40.160
interesting

02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:44.160
oh my god that's the rune on my bed

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:46.160
there's something I tried to talk to you about earlier

02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:48.160
I don't really care honestly

02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:50.160
about Ashley what is it

02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:52.160
I wanted to apologize to you for always making you look after her

02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:54.160
there was nothing

02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:56.160
that was wrong of me

02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:58.160
it's fine can you imagine what it was like for me back then

02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:00.160
when I was your age

02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:02.160
I was already

02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:04.160
ah

02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:06.160
what if you listen to mom

02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:08.160
I won't listen to mom

02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:12.160
are the parents also bro and sis

02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:14.160
that would be fucking crazy

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:16.160
I'm going to go to bed now

02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:18.160
thanks for entertaining me hope you have a great night

02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:20.160
thank you

02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:22.160
thank you for coming

02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:24.160
thank you for participating in our dgen hours here

02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:28.160
she's good but we know a liar when we look them in the eyes

02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:30.160
22-7

02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:32.160
is 15

02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:34.160
she was 15 when Andrew was born

02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:36.160
do the math

02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.160
if someone had not said the math

02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:40.160
I wouldn't have known it was 15

02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:44.160
when I was your age I was already stuck with a 7

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:46.160
and a 5 year old to care for

02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:48.160
I think you'd have fair better than me

02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:50.160
I wouldn't know

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:52.160
this isn't an excuse mind you it's an explanation

02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:54.160
are you gay

02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:56.160
I never hated you

02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:58.160
is exercise still on the table

02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:00.160
no

02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:10.160
I want to play the game

02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:12.160
I want to finish the game

02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:18.160
but I also want to exercise

02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:20.160
if you want to tell me to

02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:28.160
you

02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:38.160
it's okay don't worry about it

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:40.160
are you gay

02:58:40.160 --> 02:58:42.160
why are you acting so gay

03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:58.160
I know you're tired, so don't choke on your water.

03:09:58.160 --> 03:10:00.160
Make sure you swallow properly.

03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:04.160
I'm swallowing, I'm swallowing.

03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:11.160
I think it might be time to get the puppy pads.

03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:16.160
But they're not comfortable to sit on.

03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:22.160
I don't like sitting on them, they're not comfortable.

03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:30.160
Okay.

03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:34.160
Well, it is what it is. It doesn't have to be.

03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:39.160
Oh, fuck.

03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:43.160
Get a puppy pad?

03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:47.160
Dude, this stream's gonna get fucking, this stream's gonna get me banned.

03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:50.160
Have a mop?

03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:01.160
Hahaha.

03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:06.160
Okay, I'll get a puppy pad.

03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:09.160
I mean what? No, I won't do anything. Hold on one second.

03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:30.160
Okay, I got out the more comfortable ones.

03:11:35.160 --> 03:11:38.160
I think we can still sort this out. Isn't that right?

03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:45.160
Okay, I got out the more comfortable ones.

03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:54.160
I think we can still sort this out. Isn't that right?

03:11:54.160 --> 03:11:58.160
I think we can still sort this out, isn't that right?

03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:03.160
If it's money you need, I can help you get a job. They're hiring at your company, aren't they love?

03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:10.160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:14.160
This is basically a ring for its dream, but for piss so you should be good.

03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:20.160
Okay, if you say so.

03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:26.160
That's right, if I put in a good word for you years, could as hired.

03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:30.160
Before warned though, they get a lot of difficult customers there.

03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:36.160
But I know you can handle it. It should be easy after handling Ashley all this time. What do you say?

03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:43.160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

03:12:43.160 --> 03:12:47.160
Well, I mean, since you went through the effort, might as well help you use it.

03:12:47.160 --> 03:12:50.160
Oh, fuck you.

03:12:53.160 --> 03:12:55.160
Decline.

03:12:55.160 --> 03:13:00.160
Well, about Ashley, I wish you didn't talk about her that way.

03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:03.160
Ah, he's defending her.

03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:06.160
Did you seriously get a pat now? What?

03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:09.160
What do you mean I wouldn't do that?

03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:11.160
No.

03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:14.160
Ahem.

03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:21.160
Let's not fight. There's a solution somewhere, I'm sure.

03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:23.160
What were those...

03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:26.160
Oh, fuck.

03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:32.160
What were those death certificates about anyways?

03:13:32.160 --> 03:13:36.160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:39.160
Never beating the PLO relegations.

03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:45.160
I am beating the PLO relegations. There's no piss happening here.

03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:47.160
It's the opposite.

03:13:47.160 --> 03:13:51.160
No, there's no aftermath pick happening either.

03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:58.160
It's the life insurance game, nothing more. How's that work?

03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:00.160
There's this doctor.

03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:04.160
Well, a surgeon actually, after they told us you'll be stuck in that apartment.

03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:06.160
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?

03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:09.160
We can't go easy on you this time.

03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:14.160
No, no, of course not. Of course you won't.

03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:17.160
Don't worry, I know you won't.

03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:20.160
Sure.

03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:23.160
Cup pick? No!

03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:27.160
No, absolutely not. You're begging so much though.

03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:29.160
I'm sorry.

03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:32.160
I'm sorry.

03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:36.160
No, absolutely not. You're begging so much though.

03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:40.160
Maybe if you keep begging a little more, I might.

03:14:40.160 --> 03:14:45.160
Okay, well, I got it for you two after you got quarantined.

03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:49.160
It's kind of curious that they let you do that.

03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:51.160
Please.

03:14:51.160 --> 03:14:55.160
You're gonna need to do more than just please.

03:14:55.160 --> 03:14:58.160
If he's legally dead, the offer to get him a job was a lie either.

03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:00.160
Anyways, ooh, you're right.

03:15:00.160 --> 03:15:05.160
So then when we died, were you in on it?

03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:09.160
Of course not. I really thought you died.

03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:13.160
Pretty please, you'll be the one begging soon.

03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:17.160
Please, please, please, please.

03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:20.160
Yeah, yeah, keep begging, keep begging.

03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:22.160
I will totally do it if you beg.

03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:25.160
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?

03:15:25.160 --> 03:15:29.160
There is no piss yet, Timmy. That's what you meant to say at least.

03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:31.160
There won't be any.

03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:35.160
Gets on you is pretty please with sugar on top, you're the best girl ever.

03:15:35.160 --> 03:15:37.160
I know I am.

03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:45.160
Keep going, keep going. I might do it.

03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:49.160
They said your bodies had to be burned because of the parasites,

03:15:49.160 --> 03:15:52.160
so that's why I never got to confirm it myself.

03:15:52.160 --> 03:15:54.160
She's so full of shit.

03:15:54.160 --> 03:15:56.160
Where are you going?

03:15:56.160 --> 03:15:59.160
I have to finish setting things up for her.

03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:03.160
Oh, come on, forget about this nonsense, we can sort the documents out.

03:16:03.160 --> 03:16:06.160
Hell, you can even live here if that doesn't work out.

03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:10.160
You can leave this whole mess behind just like that, behind you, just like that.

03:16:11.160 --> 03:16:14.160
Don't fall for your chat, fall for what?

03:16:16.160 --> 03:16:20.160
Pretty please, you know we're worth it. Are you?

03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:28.160
Please little sis, you love your big brother, don't you?

03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:31.160
I do, I do, that's why I love to hear you beg.

03:16:37.160 --> 03:16:40.160
She's trying to get you to abandon Ashley just like she did.

03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:42.160
I won't do it though.

03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:46.160
That's okay, I'm not really interested.

03:16:46.160 --> 03:16:49.160
What? But that doesn't make any sense, why would you not?

03:16:50.160 --> 03:16:52.160
I get it.

03:16:53.160 --> 03:16:56.160
You fuck her.

03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:06.160
What? Huh?

03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:11.160
Oh, that is disgusting, Andrew, she's your sister for God's sake.

03:17:12.160 --> 03:17:14.160
I haven't done anything with the hell mom.

03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:18.160
Then what does she give you that makes it worth all this?

03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:20.160
Well, that's none of your business is it?

03:17:20.160 --> 03:17:22.160
I knew something was off.

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:26.160
How did I fuck up so bad? I'm the worst mother ever.

03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:28.160
Are you gay?

03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:30.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:17:30.160 --> 03:17:31.160
She knows.

03:17:31.160 --> 03:17:33.160
Chat, stop acting like little brothers.

03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:35.160
Bulley our little sis more.

03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:36.160
Stop begging.

03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:38.160
Are you gay?

03:17:38.160 --> 03:17:40.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:42.160
Gaslighting the chimney.

03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:44.160
I'm not gaslighting.

03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:47.160
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:17:48.160 --> 03:17:50.160
I said I'm gay.

03:17:50.160 --> 03:17:52.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:55.160
She's my sister. Kind of hot.

03:17:56.160 --> 03:17:59.160
No, I mean, yes you are, but I have never...

03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:01.160
I'm back.

03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:03.160
Now of all times.

03:18:07.160 --> 03:18:10.160
I got the money, did you miss me handsome?

03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:12.160
Did you, did you?

03:18:13.160 --> 03:18:14.160
Oh fuck.

03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:17.160
We're not beating the incest allegations from mom.

03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:19.160
I wanna die.

03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:23.160
Whatever, some in the fucking demon already.

03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:26.160
I was so eager. Let's see if it shows up though.

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:28.160
Since there's no music.

03:18:28.160 --> 03:18:29.160
Wait, what are you talking about?

03:18:29.160 --> 03:18:30.160
Quiet you, I'm still armed.

03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:32.160
Aren't you like the candles?

03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:34.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:37.160
This bratty sis needs more hydration.

03:18:43.160 --> 03:18:45.160
Mom really cannot imagine you just loving Ashley

03:18:45.160 --> 03:18:47.160
and not wanting to have been her.

03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:49.160
I know, what a bitch.

03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:54.160
Right, light the candles.

03:18:58.160 --> 03:19:00.160
Get to it.

03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:06.160
Are you gay?

03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:08.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:10.160
Sip, sip, sip.

03:19:11.160 --> 03:19:13.160
Fuck, coughing sucks.

03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:16.160
Mom is just jealous.

03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:18.160
Yeah, she wishes she had what we had.

03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:22.160
Or what we have.

03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:28.160
This upcoming scene is not gonna help the allegations.

03:19:30.160 --> 03:19:32.160
I'm sorry I don't have the mood music,

03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:34.160
but I have the other stuff you asked for.

03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:37.160
Maybe if I sing something, please don't.

03:19:37.160 --> 03:19:39.160
The demon shows up to spare everyone

03:19:39.160 --> 03:19:41.160
from the second human embarrassment.

03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:43.160
Ah, sorry soul.

03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:44.160
What the fuck is that?

03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:46.160
I offer those two.

03:19:48.160 --> 03:19:49.160
They're screaming as short lived

03:19:49.160 --> 03:19:51.160
as the demon steals their souls.

03:19:51.160 --> 03:19:53.160
Oh, that was easy.

03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:55.160
I wonder if I should feel something.

03:19:55.160 --> 03:19:57.160
Well anyways, so the music wasn't needed

03:19:57.160 --> 03:19:58.160
to summon you after all.

03:19:58.160 --> 03:20:00.160
Why'd I have to play it last time?

03:20:00.160 --> 03:20:02.160
The circle is hard to find.

03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:04.160
Sound is easy to follow.

03:20:05.160 --> 03:20:07.160
Sound is easy to follow.

03:20:07.160 --> 03:20:09.160
Are you starting to feel the pressure?

03:20:09.160 --> 03:20:11.160
A little bit, yeah.

03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:12.160
It's not...

03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:15.160
It's not very low yet, but...

03:20:17.160 --> 03:20:19.160
I think it's getting there.

03:20:19.160 --> 03:20:21.160
It's gonna take me a little longer

03:20:21.160 --> 03:20:23.160
to get there because, you know...

03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:28.160
I already went to the bathroom not too long ago.

03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:33.160
However you may have my talisman now.

03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:36.160
Oh, you have my talisman.

03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:38.160
However you have my talisman now,

03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:40.160
it makes you easy to find.

03:20:40.160 --> 03:20:42.160
Speaking of which,

03:20:42.160 --> 03:20:44.160
a deal's a deal, charge it up please.

03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:46.160
Your trinket works again.

03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:47.160
Thank you.

03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:50.160
What, hello?

03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:51.160
This is the brother.

03:20:51.160 --> 03:20:53.160
That's right, my pride and joy.

03:20:55.160 --> 03:20:57.160
Oh no, you can't have his soul, it's mine.

03:20:58.160 --> 03:21:00.160
I will see you again, Tar Soul.

03:21:00.160 --> 03:21:02.160
Sure, I'll make another offer once the trinket

03:21:02.160 --> 03:21:04.160
needs to be charged again.

03:21:04.160 --> 03:21:05.160
I will summon you.

03:21:05.160 --> 03:21:06.160
Bring this one with you.

03:21:07.160 --> 03:21:08.160
What, why me?

03:21:08.160 --> 03:21:09.160
Okie dokie, bye bye.

03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:14.160
Not gonna lie,

03:21:14.160 --> 03:21:15.160
I kind of feel bad seeing my little sister

03:21:15.160 --> 03:21:16.160
do all these exercises.

03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:18.160
You should do them with me.

03:21:19.160 --> 03:21:21.160
You should participate with me.

03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:22.160
What's that?

03:21:22.160 --> 03:21:23.160
The trinket is charged.

03:21:24.160 --> 03:21:25.160
What did it mean?

03:21:25.160 --> 03:21:27.160
What did it mean it'll summon you?

03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:28.160
Who cares?

03:21:30.160 --> 03:21:31.160
Who cares?

03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:33.160
What do we do about the bodies?

03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:34.160
Who cares, she says.

03:21:34.160 --> 03:21:35.160
Are you kidding me?

03:21:35.160 --> 03:21:36.160
The bodies, Andy Focus.

03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:37.160
Right, the bodies.

03:21:39.160 --> 03:21:41.160
What's in it for me if I participate?

03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:43.160
My love and affection.

03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:45.160
And pain.

03:21:45.160 --> 03:21:46.160
And maybe a little bit of pleasure.

03:21:47.160 --> 03:21:48.160
Well, on one hand,

03:21:48.160 --> 03:21:50.160
we didn't kill them.

03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:51.160
But on the other,

03:21:51.160 --> 03:21:53.160
them having gone missing

03:21:53.160 --> 03:21:55.160
would definitely be better for us.

03:21:55.160 --> 03:21:57.160
Maybe they just fucked off somewhere.

03:21:57.160 --> 03:21:58.160
Who knows?

03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:00.160
We know how if there's a murder investigation.

03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:02.160
Right, so let's make them disappear.

03:22:02.160 --> 03:22:04.160
Right, we can start by chopping them up.

03:22:05.160 --> 03:22:07.160
Can't we just dump them in the ocean or something?

03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:09.160
No, Ashley, we're gonna make them vanish.

03:22:09.160 --> 03:22:11.160
Not wash up a shore somewhere.

03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:14.160
Cut them up!

03:22:15.160 --> 03:22:16.160
How to go about this,

03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:17.160
we can't leave a mess behind.

03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:19.160
Well, there's a dream right there.

03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:20.160
Are you gay?

03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:22.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:22:22.160 --> 03:22:25.160
We still doing jumping jacks with sips.

03:22:25.160 --> 03:22:28.160
Need to keep Lil sis strong and agile to keep up.

03:22:29.160 --> 03:22:30.160
I said no more.

03:22:31.160 --> 03:22:32.160
I can't, I can't.

03:22:33.160 --> 03:22:34.160
I'm sorry.

03:22:35.160 --> 03:22:37.160
I'm sorry if you're expecting more.

03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:38.160
I can't.

03:22:39.160 --> 03:22:40.160
Flat twist is coming up.

03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:42.160
Not like it changes much, but flat twist.

03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:45.160
Okay.

03:22:47.160 --> 03:22:48.160
Sounds like a good deal.

03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:49.160
Okay, then participate with me.

03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:56.160
Here, I'll do a big sip instead, yeah.

03:22:59.160 --> 03:23:00.160
There.

03:23:01.160 --> 03:23:03.160
See, I'm not a dumb ass all the time.

03:23:03.160 --> 03:23:06.160
No, just a dumb and an ass.

03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:09.160
Wow, check this smart ass out right here.

03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:12.160
Andrew's untying the parents with stops.

03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:14.160
Wait, what?

03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:15.160
What is it?

03:23:15.160 --> 03:23:16.160
Is dad breathing?

03:23:16.160 --> 03:23:19.160
Dad never had a soul to begin with.

03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:21.160
Maybe some sit-ups?

03:23:21.160 --> 03:23:23.160
I can't even do sit-ups.

03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:27.160
No more jacks, we can push your limits,

03:23:27.160 --> 03:23:29.160
but not too extreme for extra sense.

03:23:29.160 --> 03:23:30.160
Why are you so gay?

03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:31.160
We'll do damage.

03:23:31.160 --> 03:23:32.160
Yeah, we don't want to damage me.

03:23:32.160 --> 03:23:35.160
Remember before we get lower that safe word exists for a reason.

03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:39.160
Begging and pleading is just a precursor to the real joys.

03:23:39.160 --> 03:23:42.160
Filling her with kindness by not being soft this time.

03:23:45.160 --> 03:23:46.160
Push-ups?

03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:48.160
I can't even do one push-up, man.

03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:52.160
Take a look, and sure enough, his chest is moving ever so slightly.

03:23:52.160 --> 03:23:53.160
Mom, too.

03:23:54.160 --> 03:23:55.160
Huh?

03:23:56.160 --> 03:23:58.160
You try various things, but nothing gets a response from your parents.

03:23:58.160 --> 03:24:01.160
See, their hearts still beat, their lungs draw in air.

03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:03.160
What is this?

03:24:03.160 --> 03:24:05.160
Maybe losing your soul just turns you into a vegetable.

03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:08.160
That can't be.

03:24:08.160 --> 03:24:10.160
The cultists died in the warden, too.

03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:12.160
Did you actually check?

03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:14.160
I sure didn't.

03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:16.160
I just went to town and started chopping.

03:24:18.160 --> 03:24:20.160
Was mom Purgante?

03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:26.160
No, no, please tell me he wasn't still alive when we ate him.

03:24:27.160 --> 03:24:29.160
What the fuck is so funny about this?

03:24:30.160 --> 03:24:32.160
Come on now, I'm sure he died pretty quickly from blood loss.

03:24:33.160 --> 03:24:35.160
If not, you ripping his head off must have done the trick.

03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:39.160
It'll be the same with these two, get to cutting.

03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:42.160
No, this changes everything, doesn't it?

03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:45.160
You want to leave them like this? They're not getting their souls back.

03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:48.160
But if you want to leave them to starve them, they'll for it.

03:24:49.160 --> 03:24:51.160
Wouldn't it be a little poetic? I'm sure you'd like that.

03:24:54.160 --> 03:24:56.160
Squats is the appropriate exercise?

03:24:57.160 --> 03:24:58.160
I can't.

03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:01.160
I don't want to.

03:25:02.160 --> 03:25:03.160
I really don't.

03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:05.160
You can't make me.

03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:06.160
You won't make me.

03:25:08.160 --> 03:25:09.160
Wouldn't it be a little poetic?

03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:10.160
I'm sure you'd like that.

03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:12.160
I don't know, I need to think.

03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:15.160
Come on, where are you going?

03:25:16.160 --> 03:25:17.160
No, Andrew, look here for a sec.

03:25:18.160 --> 03:25:19.160
What?

03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:22.160
Oh shit.

03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:28.160
The plot twist is that people getting their souls taken doesn't kill them.

03:25:29.160 --> 03:25:30.160
Awww.

03:25:31.160 --> 03:25:33.160
The cultist was alive when you ate him.

03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:35.160
Awww.

03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:40.160
What are you doing?

03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:42.160
Bear, all dead.

03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:47.160
Now tell me again how I always make you do all the dirty work.

03:25:48.160 --> 03:25:49.160
He'll bitch and moan.

03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:52.160
Surely he'll bitch and moan as per usual.

03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:54.160
But you did not miss that sigh of relief.

03:25:55.160 --> 03:25:58.160
Anyway, you drag your parents' souls and lifeless bodies over to the shower.

03:26:01.160 --> 03:26:02.160
Oh my god.

03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:08.160
The UK special, she shanked them.

03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:11.160
What do we do now? Do we cut them up?

03:26:12.160 --> 03:26:13.160
I'll start cutting.

03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:15.160
You guide the blood into the drain with the shower head.

03:26:15.160 --> 03:26:16.160
Gotcha.

03:26:17.160 --> 03:26:19.160
Whoa, whoa, wait, stop. Stop, it's flooding.

03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:22.160
What the hell, gross.

03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:24.160
Are you gay?

03:26:25.160 --> 03:26:26.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:26:27.160 --> 03:26:28.160
Sip, sip, sip.

03:26:35.160 --> 03:26:36.160
How much for squats?

03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:43.160
If I say how much then a bunch of people will make me do squats.

03:26:43.160 --> 03:26:44.160
Squats.

03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:49.160
Are you gay?

03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:51.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:26:52.160 --> 03:26:53.160
Keep hanging in there.

03:26:58.160 --> 03:26:59.160
Kind of a point.

03:27:00.160 --> 03:27:01.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:03.160
No one said you could stop.

03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:05.160
Oh my god.

03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:07.160
100 bucks a squat.

03:27:13.160 --> 03:27:15.160
Don't give a number, no more exercise.

03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:20.160
Are you gay?

03:27:21.160 --> 03:27:22.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:23.160
Oh my god.

03:27:23.160 --> 03:27:24.160
I don't know now.

03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:30.160
Yes, that's the point of exercising because it lowers my energy.

03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:34.160
Okay, I can't do 20 squats.

03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:36.160
Don't put a number on it.

03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:40.160
So just as many squats as I can, what do you mean don't put a number on it?

03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:45.160
Are you gay?

03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:47.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:27:48.160 --> 03:27:49.160
Good girl.

03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:55.160
Okay.

03:27:56.160 --> 03:28:00.160
$20 for three squats there.

03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:02.160
Are you gay?

03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:03.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:28:04.160 --> 03:28:06.160
I'm cheering for you and also not at the same time.

03:28:07.160 --> 03:28:08.160
Ocean wave, ocean wave.

03:28:10.160 --> 03:28:11.160
$20 for three squats.

03:28:11.160 --> 03:28:15.160
And I'm only doing a maximum of nine squats.

03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:17.160
Okay?

03:28:18.160 --> 03:28:20.160
Only doing a maximum of nine squats.

03:28:23.160 --> 03:28:25.160
I'll get you something to unclog the drain with.

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:27.160
What?

03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:28.160
Oh, the mop.

03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:30.160
Are you gay?

03:28:31.160 --> 03:28:32.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:34.160
Okay.

03:28:35.160 --> 03:28:37.160
Man, I haven't done squats in forever.

03:28:38.160 --> 03:28:39.160
Shit.

03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:40.160
Are you gay?

03:28:41.160 --> 03:28:42.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:28:43.160 --> 03:28:45.160
Okay, six squats.

03:28:47.160 --> 03:28:48.160
Okay.

03:28:50.160 --> 03:28:51.160
One.

03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:53.160
Two.

03:28:54.160 --> 03:28:55.160
Three.

03:28:57.160 --> 03:28:58.160
Four.

03:28:59.160 --> 03:29:00.160
Oh, shit.

03:29:01.160 --> 03:29:02.160
Five.

03:29:04.160 --> 03:29:05.160
Six.

03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:07.160
Okay.

03:29:07.160 --> 03:29:08.160
Six.

03:29:08.160 --> 03:29:09.160
Okay.

03:29:20.160 --> 03:29:21.160
Oh, my God.

03:29:27.160 --> 03:29:28.160
Oh, my God.

03:29:38.160 --> 03:29:39.160
Okay.

03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:41.160
Ask to grass?

03:29:42.160 --> 03:29:43.160
I...

03:29:45.160 --> 03:29:46.160
I can't.

03:29:47.160 --> 03:29:48.160
I can't.

03:29:48.160 --> 03:29:49.160
I can't go ask to grass.

03:29:49.160 --> 03:29:50.160
I can't.

03:29:51.160 --> 03:29:52.160
I can't go ask to grass.

03:29:52.160 --> 03:29:53.160
I can't.

03:29:53.160 --> 03:29:54.160
I can't go ask to grass.

03:29:55.160 --> 03:29:56.160
I can't.

03:29:56.160 --> 03:29:57.160
That's too much.

03:29:58.160 --> 03:29:59.160
Okay.

03:29:59.160 --> 03:30:01.160
How do I clean up all this blood?

03:30:03.160 --> 03:30:04.160
Toilet?

03:30:05.160 --> 03:30:06.160
Are you gay?

03:30:07.160 --> 03:30:08.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:30:09.160 --> 03:30:10.160
Good job.

03:30:10.160 --> 03:30:11.160
Oh, thank you.

03:30:14.160 --> 03:30:17.160
Pour down some baking soda and vinegar.

03:30:17.160 --> 03:30:18.160
Ah, screw.

03:30:19.160 --> 03:30:20.160
Ah!

03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:22.160
Okay.

03:30:26.160 --> 03:30:27.160
Where do I...

03:30:28.160 --> 03:30:29.160
Where do I find a screwdriver?

03:30:29.160 --> 03:30:30.160
Mm-hmm.

03:30:31.160 --> 03:30:32.160
Mm-hmm.

03:30:32.160 --> 03:30:33.160
Mm-hmm.

03:30:33.160 --> 03:30:34.160
Mm-hmm.

03:30:35.160 --> 03:30:36.160
Mm-hmm.

03:30:37.160 --> 03:30:39.160
Where do I find a screwdriver?

03:30:41.160 --> 03:30:45.160
Where can I find a screwdriver?

03:30:47.160 --> 03:30:48.160
Oh, in the basement.

03:30:48.160 --> 03:30:49.160
In the basement.

03:30:50.160 --> 03:30:52.160
In the basement.

03:30:56.160 --> 03:30:58.160
Toolbox. Toolbox.

03:30:59.160 --> 03:31:00.160
Hi.

03:31:03.160 --> 03:31:04.160
Um, baking soda.

03:31:04.160 --> 03:31:07.160
Baking soda is in the, in the, in the kitchen?

03:31:07.160 --> 03:31:08.160
In the kitchen.

03:31:09.160 --> 03:31:10.160
Am I winning?

03:31:10.160 --> 03:31:11.160
Aren't you gay?

03:31:11.160 --> 03:31:12.160
Mm-hmm.

03:31:12.160 --> 03:31:13.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:31:13.160 --> 03:31:15.160
Feeling a little swollen.

03:31:15.160 --> 03:31:16.160
Lil sis.

03:31:16.160 --> 03:31:17.160
Last satilda.

03:31:18.160 --> 03:31:20.160
Okay, last sat.

03:31:20.160 --> 03:31:21.160
Are you gay?

03:31:21.160 --> 03:31:23.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:31:23.160 --> 03:31:26.160
Hey, you're starting to sound a little flustered there.

03:31:27.160 --> 03:31:28.160
Because I am!

03:31:33.160 --> 03:31:34.160
One.

03:31:35.160 --> 03:31:36.160
Two.

03:31:38.160 --> 03:31:39.160
Three.

03:31:40.160 --> 03:31:41.160
Okay.

03:31:42.160 --> 03:31:44.160
There, we got nine squats in total.

03:31:44.160 --> 03:31:45.160
You got what you wanted.

03:31:47.160 --> 03:31:48.160
Ah.

03:31:51.160 --> 03:31:52.160
Ah.

03:31:53.160 --> 03:31:54.160
Ah.

03:31:57.160 --> 03:31:58.160
Ah.

03:32:03.160 --> 03:32:04.160
Ah.

03:32:04.160 --> 03:32:05.160
Okay.

03:32:07.160 --> 03:32:09.160
We're getting into very low tone.

03:32:09.160 --> 03:32:11.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:32:11.160 --> 03:32:13.160
Gotta tone them cheeks.

03:32:17.160 --> 03:32:19.160
My cheeks are already toned.

03:32:19.160 --> 03:32:21.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:32:22.160 --> 03:32:24.160
How you holding up my lovely little sister?

03:32:24.160 --> 03:32:26.160
You're acting so gay.

03:32:26.160 --> 03:32:28.160
You're acting so gay.

03:32:28.160 --> 03:32:29.160
You're acting so gay.

03:32:29.160 --> 03:32:32.160
How you holding up my lovely little sister?

03:32:34.160 --> 03:32:36.160
I'm holding up fine.

03:32:36.160 --> 03:32:37.160
Are you gay?

03:32:37.160 --> 03:32:39.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:32:39.160 --> 03:32:41.160
Cue timmy noise fund.

03:32:45.160 --> 03:32:47.160
Punch them legs, I am!

03:32:47.160 --> 03:32:48.160
I'm trying.

03:32:48.160 --> 03:32:50.160
Kitchen, kitchen, we're going to the kitchen.

03:32:50.160 --> 03:32:52.160
Fuck, that's not the kitchen.

03:32:54.160 --> 03:32:55.160
Um.

03:32:56.160 --> 03:32:58.160
Okay, baking soda, we got everything we need.

03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:01.160
Ah.

03:33:06.160 --> 03:33:08.160
Hey, are you gay?

03:33:08.160 --> 03:33:10.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:33:10.160 --> 03:33:12.160
It's okay if you let out just a little.

03:33:12.160 --> 03:33:14.160
No, no it's not.

03:33:16.160 --> 03:33:18.160
Are you gay?

03:33:18.160 --> 03:33:20.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:33:20.160 --> 03:33:22.160
It would be so easy to just give up.

03:33:23.160 --> 03:33:26.160
No, I can't, I literally can't, I literally can't.

03:33:30.160 --> 03:33:32.160
You pour down a generous amount of baking soda

03:33:32.160 --> 03:33:34.160
and then don't, don't sit with vinegar.

03:33:34.160 --> 03:33:37.160
The soda starts bubbling up and the clog doesn't

03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:39.160
lessen one bit.

03:33:39.160 --> 03:33:40.160
Oh, I tried.

03:33:40.160 --> 03:33:42.160
I'll give you some rubber gloves.

03:33:42.160 --> 03:33:44.160
I'm the one who's gonna have to get in there.

03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:47.160
Oh, of course, I am but a dainty little lady.

03:33:50.160 --> 03:33:52.160
You can't expect me to do a man's job.

03:33:53.160 --> 03:33:55.160
Fine, just give me the gloves.

03:33:56.160 --> 03:33:58.160
Where do I find those?

03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:01.160
Are you gay?

03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:03.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:34:03.160 --> 03:34:06.160
B.E.R.B., I have to house the bathroom sis.

03:34:12.160 --> 03:34:14.160
I hope you fuckin'

03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:18.160
trip and fall and land with your head in the toilet.

03:34:19.160 --> 03:34:21.160
On the stairs.

03:34:22.160 --> 03:34:24.160
Right, on the...

03:34:26.160 --> 03:34:28.160
On the stairs.

03:34:28.160 --> 03:34:30.160
I have fun.

03:34:33.160 --> 03:34:36.160
God knows what out of the drain.

03:34:36.160 --> 03:34:39.160
A seemingly never ending amount of God knows what.

03:34:39.160 --> 03:34:42.160
It's disgusting, I'm gonna gag, you're not helping.

03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:44.160
Fuck, that's gross, Andy.

03:34:45.160 --> 03:34:49.160
Both of you took all of me about when I am armed.

03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:52.160
Ew!

03:34:55.160 --> 03:34:57.160
Come here, you.

03:34:58.160 --> 03:35:00.160
No, no, no, don't you dare.

03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:03.160
No, fuckin' kill you in your sleep in Minecraft.

03:35:03.160 --> 03:35:05.160
Any last words?

03:35:05.160 --> 03:35:08.160
Forgive me, Andrew, Andrew, I'm sorry, I apologize.

03:35:08.160 --> 03:35:10.160
Find your spirit for now.

03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:13.160
The drain works, let's get this over with.

03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:18.160
And disembowel them and decapitate them.

03:35:18.160 --> 03:35:21.160
And you also make mental note to yourself about Andrew.

03:35:21.160 --> 03:35:26.160
Instead of oscillating between freaking out an apathy like you expected him to.

03:35:29.160 --> 03:35:33.160
You're having a food fight, ew, it's not food.

03:35:35.160 --> 03:35:37.160
Who is it?

03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:38.160
What?

03:35:39.160 --> 03:35:41.160
Nothing, Andrew.

03:35:42.160 --> 03:35:45.160
If you're tired, I can take care of the rest.

03:35:45.160 --> 03:35:47.160
No, no, it's really nothing.

03:35:47.160 --> 03:35:49.160
I must be seeing things.

03:35:49.160 --> 03:35:51.160
Huh? What?

03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:52.160
To think...

03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:57.160
To think I'd ever bear witness to you being distraught over our parents' crime.

03:35:57.160 --> 03:36:02.160
Alright, and again, I bet you're just moping over finally getting your hands dirty.

03:36:04.160 --> 03:36:08.160
She's still falling in love with him? Who? Me?

03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:09.160
No?

03:36:09.160 --> 03:36:13.160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

03:36:13.160 --> 03:36:17.160
Sorry I was gone, Emmy. God held up cleaning up after an incident.

03:36:17.160 --> 03:36:21.160
You're just too cute. So how is round two going so far?

03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:24.160
Thank you.

03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:26.160
Thank you.

03:36:26.160 --> 03:36:31.160
It's, um, going well, I think.

03:36:32.160 --> 03:36:37.160
She isn't predicting Andrew, she's predicting Andy, and Andy is gone now fully.

03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:41.160
So now only Andrew's in it and she doesn't know how to predict Andrew.

03:36:41.160 --> 03:36:42.160
Huh?

03:36:43.160 --> 03:36:46.160
Hm? What? Are you doing alright?

03:36:46.160 --> 03:36:50.160
As alright as I can be considering the circumstances?

03:36:51.160 --> 03:36:53.160
That's good.

03:36:53.160 --> 03:36:56.160
You're being weird.

03:36:56.160 --> 03:36:58.160
Look.

03:37:01.160 --> 03:37:03.160
Okay.

03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:05.160
Look who's talking.

03:37:05.160 --> 03:37:08.160
Alright, enough time wasted.

03:37:08.160 --> 03:37:11.160
Andrew continues casually butchering your parents.

03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:13.160
Incidentally, there's a knot in your stomach.

03:37:13.160 --> 03:37:15.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:37:15.160 --> 03:37:17.160
I think it's going a little too well.

03:37:17.160 --> 03:37:19.160
What do you mean?

03:37:24.160 --> 03:37:27.160
There's no such thing as too well.

03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:29.160
Are you gay?

03:37:29.160 --> 03:37:31.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:37:31.160 --> 03:37:33.160
Don't try this at home.

03:37:33.160 --> 03:37:36.160
And by this I mean dismembering your parents.

03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:39.160
Right, yes, yes, exactly.

03:37:39.160 --> 03:37:42.160
Oh fuck, I ran out of water.

03:37:45.160 --> 03:37:49.160
I don't want to stand up and make some worse.

03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:52.160
Okay.

03:37:53.160 --> 03:37:56.160
I'll be right back anymore, water.

03:37:57.160 --> 03:37:58.160
Are you gay?

03:37:58.160 --> 03:38:00.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:05.160
Hey, Emmy, you're being weird, yellow heart.

03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:07.160
I'm not being weird, you're being weird.

03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:08.160
Are you gay?

03:38:08.160 --> 03:38:10.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:38:10.160 --> 03:38:13.160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

03:38:13.160 --> 03:38:16.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:38:16.160 --> 03:38:17.160
I'll be right back.

03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:18.160
Are you gay?

03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:21.160
Stop chipping.

03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:23.160
You're going to need more water.

03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:49.160
Are you gay?

03:38:49.160 --> 03:38:51.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:54.160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

03:38:54.160 --> 03:38:55.160
Are you gay?

03:38:55.160 --> 03:38:57.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:38:57.160 --> 03:39:00.160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:01.160
Are you gay?

03:39:01.160 --> 03:39:03.160
Why are you acting so gay?

03:39:03.160 --> 03:39:06.160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

03:39:06.160 --> 03:39:07.160

03:39:07.160 --> 03:39:09.160

Why are you acting so gay?

03:39:16.160 --> 03:39:17.160
miserable

03:39:26.160 --> 03:39:27.160
I'm sorry.

03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:29.160
How much do I have to drink?

03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:38.160
How much do I have to drink?

03:39:41.160 --> 03:39:42.160
Are you gay?

03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:44.160

03:42:45.160 --> 03:42:48.120
You can cook your parents if you interact with the pot in the kitchen.

03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:54.120
Let's turn some of the meat into a soup, throw in some vegetables, maybe spices,

03:42:55.080 --> 03:42:57.960
and then throw the rest away as scraps. What do you mean the rest?

03:42:59.080 --> 03:43:04.440
What do you think? I'm eating some. Do what you want. What was the soup you made earlier?

03:43:05.240 --> 03:43:07.240
What are the ingredients again?

03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:14.360
The recipe is right there, read it. Shame on me for...

03:43:16.280 --> 03:43:18.120
Shame on me for thinking you'd be helpful.

03:43:18.920 --> 03:43:22.520
It was me, Anya's Potatoes and Carrots, shop everything up and throw them into a pot.

03:43:22.520 --> 03:43:24.520
There we go, thank you.

03:43:24.520 --> 03:43:28.520
I know you memorized it, you fucking nerd.

03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:30.520
I'm not letting go of anything.

03:43:32.520 --> 03:43:34.520
You're welcome.

03:43:38.520 --> 03:43:40.520
Do I have to...

03:43:40.520 --> 03:43:42.520
How's the game so far?

03:43:46.520 --> 03:43:48.520
That size is how it is.

03:43:48.520 --> 03:43:50.520
How many water bottles?

03:43:50.520 --> 03:43:52.520
I don't...

03:43:56.520 --> 03:43:58.520
Fuck!

03:44:00.520 --> 03:44:02.520
Are you gay?

03:44:02.520 --> 03:44:04.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:44:04.520 --> 03:44:06.520
Drip, drip, drip.

03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:08.520
Nothing is dripping.

03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:10.520
Nothing, there's no drip.

03:44:10.520 --> 03:44:12.520
Are you gay?

03:44:12.520 --> 03:44:14.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:44:14.520 --> 03:44:16.520
Cheers.

03:44:18.520 --> 03:44:20.520
Cheers.

03:44:22.520 --> 03:44:26.520
For some reason my monitor keeps flickering.

03:44:26.520 --> 03:44:28.520
What am I here for?

03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:32.520
All I want is to cook my parents, right?

03:44:32.520 --> 03:44:34.520
Are you gay?

03:44:34.520 --> 03:44:36.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:44:36.520 --> 03:44:38.520
Gotta go to the bathroom real quick.

03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:42.520
Be a good girl and hold it while I'm gone.

03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:46.520
It's not fair!

03:44:46.520 --> 03:44:48.520
It's not fair.

03:44:48.520 --> 03:44:50.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:44:50.520 --> 03:44:54.520
You should get real close to the mic and let us hear you drink.

03:44:54.520 --> 03:44:56.520
I am, but I don't think you can hear it.

03:44:56.520 --> 03:44:58.520
Are you gay?

03:44:58.520 --> 03:45:00.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:02.520
Soup is mostly water.

03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:06.520
I know it is.

03:45:10.520 --> 03:45:14.520
This is kind of medically unadvisable, I know it is.

03:45:14.520 --> 03:45:16.520
It's so gay.

03:45:16.520 --> 03:45:18.520
What would happen if I poked your belly right now?

03:45:22.520 --> 03:45:24.520
I don't want to think about that.

03:45:24.520 --> 03:45:26.520
And you can't make me poke it myself, I won't do it.

03:45:26.520 --> 03:45:28.520
Are you gay?

03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:30.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:45:30.520 --> 03:45:34.520
An old army tip to help make drinking lots of water more tolerable.

03:45:34.520 --> 03:45:36.520
Add some salt.

03:45:36.520 --> 03:45:38.520
The body needs minerals along with the water.

03:45:38.520 --> 03:45:40.520
You're already torturing me.

03:45:40.520 --> 03:45:44.520
You want me to drink disgusting salt water too?

03:45:44.520 --> 03:45:46.520
No.

03:45:46.520 --> 03:45:48.520
Let me fix my monitor real quick.

03:45:48.520 --> 03:45:50.520
It keeps flickering.

03:46:10.520 --> 03:46:12.520
Okay.

03:46:12.520 --> 03:46:14.520
You can just eat some street-up salt.

03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:16.520
I don't think I'll do that.

03:46:16.520 --> 03:46:20.520
But I did bring a sausage earlier from the kitchen.

03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:22.520
Does that work?

03:46:24.520 --> 03:46:26.520
I'm going to eat this sausage.

03:46:26.520 --> 03:46:28.520
There.

03:46:28.520 --> 03:46:30.520
Girl breakfast!

03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:34.520
Okay.

03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:36.520
You don't have all the ingredients prepared.

03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:38.520
Where the fuck do I get the meat from?

03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:40.520
I don't know.

03:46:40.520 --> 03:46:42.520
I don't know.

03:46:42.520 --> 03:46:44.520
I don't know.

03:46:44.520 --> 03:46:46.520
I don't know.

03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:48.520
I don't know.

03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:50.520
I don't know.

03:46:50.520 --> 03:46:52.520
I don't know.

03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:54.520
I don't know.

03:46:54.520 --> 03:46:56.520
Where the fuck do I get the meat from?

03:46:58.520 --> 03:47:00.520
It is very salty.

03:47:00.520 --> 03:47:02.520
I don't know what kind of sausage it is.

03:47:02.520 --> 03:47:04.520
But it's my favorite.

03:47:04.520 --> 03:47:06.520
It's really spicy.

03:47:06.520 --> 03:47:08.520
And my mom gets it from the farmers market for me.

03:47:18.520 --> 03:47:20.520
But their...

03:47:20.520 --> 03:47:22.520
Their remains are in the fire cooking.

03:47:24.520 --> 03:47:26.520
How do I get their remains?

03:47:28.520 --> 03:47:30.520
I'm not gay.

03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:32.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:34.520
Evening, Jinji.

03:47:34.520 --> 03:47:36.520
How you been, baby girl?

03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:38.520
Jinji.

03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:40.520
I can't say I'm not ginger.

03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:42.520
I am ginger.

03:47:46.520 --> 03:47:48.520
Did that scene happen yet?

03:47:48.520 --> 03:47:50.520
What scene?

03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:52.520
I don't know. Throw them in the fireplace?

03:47:52.520 --> 03:47:54.520
What about the skulls?

03:47:56.520 --> 03:47:58.520
The skulls we can deal with later along with the other skulls.

03:48:04.520 --> 03:48:06.520
Look at that. Much better than your soup.

03:48:06.520 --> 03:48:08.520
Now, was there anything else we still need to deal with?

03:48:10.520 --> 03:48:12.520
I don't know.

03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:14.520
She's my little ginger ale.

03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:16.520
Aw, it's cute.

03:48:16.520 --> 03:48:18.520
Throw your faces into the fire.

03:48:18.520 --> 03:48:20.520
Wow, we had their faces.

03:48:22.520 --> 03:48:24.520
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,

03:48:24.520 --> 03:48:26.520
but unfortunately the concept artist

03:48:26.520 --> 03:48:28.520
and Strani have both informed me

03:48:28.520 --> 03:48:30.520
that I am supposed to be ginger.

03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:34.520
Don't worry.

03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:36.520
I'll make myself more obviously ginger.

03:48:36.520 --> 03:48:38.520
When I draw my model.

03:48:42.520 --> 03:48:44.520
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,

03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:46.520
but unfortunately the concept artist

03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:48.520
and Strani have both informed me

03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:50.520
that I am supposed to be ginger.

03:48:50.520 --> 03:48:52.520
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,

03:48:52.520 --> 03:48:54.520
but unfortunately the concept artist and Strani have both informed me that I am supposed to be ginger.

03:48:54.520 --> 03:48:56.520
I know it's so over. I have no soul.

03:48:56.520 --> 03:48:58.520
Several servings of crimson smoothie emerge.

03:48:58.520 --> 03:49:00.520
Several servings of crimson smoothie emerge.

03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:02.520
All of which you fork down the fish and sink.

03:49:02.520 --> 03:49:04.520
All of which you fork down the fish and sink.

03:49:04.520 --> 03:49:06.520
How's that? Good as gone?

03:49:06.520 --> 03:49:08.520
How's that? Good as gone?

03:49:08.520 --> 03:49:10.520
I'm genuinely surprised you didn't offer me any.

03:49:10.520 --> 03:49:12.520
I'm genuinely surprised you didn't offer me any.

03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:14.520
Well, did you want a disease or something?

03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:16.520
Of course.

03:49:16.520 --> 03:49:18.520
Of course I wouldn't offer you raw meat.

03:49:18.520 --> 03:49:20.520
You really take me for an idiot, don't you?

03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:24.520
Is the sausage good?

03:49:24.520 --> 03:49:26.520
Yes.

03:49:32.520 --> 03:49:34.520
I take you for what you are, idiot.

03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:36.520
Watch your mouth.

03:49:36.520 --> 03:49:38.520
This idiot just poured your parents down the train.

03:49:38.520 --> 03:49:40.520
Huh. Alright.

03:49:40.520 --> 03:49:42.520
That was pretty smart, I guess, for an idiot.

03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:46.520
What do I do?

03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:48.520
What do I do?

03:49:48.520 --> 03:49:50.520
Is it a big sausage?

03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:02.520
Sorry, I choked on it a little.

03:50:02.520 --> 03:50:04.520
It is a big sausage and it's really spicy too.

03:50:04.520 --> 03:50:06.520
So it hurts to eat.

03:50:08.520 --> 03:50:10.520
The bones, the bones, the bones.

03:50:10.520 --> 03:50:12.520
The bones.

03:50:14.520 --> 03:50:16.520
The bones, what do I do with the bones?

03:50:18.520 --> 03:50:20.520
Do you think the soup is ready?

03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:26.520
What do I do with the bones?

03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:32.520
What do I do with the bones?

03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:36.520
How many inches?

03:50:36.520 --> 03:50:38.520
It's like three inches.

03:50:38.520 --> 03:50:40.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:50:40.520 --> 03:50:42.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:50:42.520 --> 03:50:44.520
Can't have you choking.

03:50:44.520 --> 03:50:46.520
Better wash it down.

03:50:50.520 --> 03:50:52.520
Dinner's ready.

03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:54.520
I'm eating too.

03:50:54.520 --> 03:50:56.520
Of course, this is the last hearty home cooked meal for a while after all.

03:50:56.520 --> 03:50:58.520
I suppose that's right now.

03:50:58.520 --> 03:51:00.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:51:04.520 --> 03:51:06.520
I don't know.

03:51:06.520 --> 03:51:08.520
Can you eat closer to the mic?

03:51:10.520 --> 03:51:12.520
The mic is right in front of my mouth.

03:51:12.520 --> 03:51:14.520
It's always in front of my mouth.

03:51:16.520 --> 03:51:18.520
It's probably just not sensitive enough to hear.

03:51:22.520 --> 03:51:24.520
Yeah.

03:51:24.520 --> 03:51:26.520
Maybe if I turned off the mic settings.

03:51:30.520 --> 03:51:32.520
There.

03:51:32.520 --> 03:51:34.520
Is that what you wanted?

03:51:44.520 --> 03:51:46.520
Okay, I turned the mic settings back on.

03:51:50.520 --> 03:51:52.520
How is it?

03:51:52.520 --> 03:51:54.520
It's okay.

03:51:58.520 --> 03:52:00.520
Just okay?

03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:04.520
I mean, it's better than last night, but...

03:52:04.520 --> 03:52:06.520
Why are you so picky?

03:52:06.520 --> 03:52:08.520
It's really dry. You overcooked it or something.

03:52:08.520 --> 03:52:10.520
Mom's just a dry person, alright?

03:52:10.520 --> 03:52:12.520
Are you gay?

03:52:12.520 --> 03:52:14.520
Why are you acting so gay?

03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:16.520
Do you miss being able to look at our Twitter likes?

03:52:16.520 --> 03:52:18.520
I do.

03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:20.520
I do.

03:52:20.520 --> 03:52:22.520
It kind of, you know, told me what kind of person you are.

03:52:24.520 --> 03:52:26.520
And the stuff you like.

03:52:26.520 --> 03:52:28.520
I don't chew with my mouth open.

03:52:28.520 --> 03:52:30.520
It's just the model tracking thinks my mouth is open.

03:52:36.520 --> 03:52:38.520
How the hell is it dry?

03:52:38.520 --> 03:52:40.520
This is soup.

03:52:40.520 --> 03:52:42.520
No, mom should be more salty.

03:52:42.520 --> 03:52:44.520
This is just plain and dry.

03:52:44.520 --> 03:52:46.520
I rate this a waste of ingredients out of 10.

03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:48.520
We're not eating again.

03:52:56.520 --> 03:52:58.520
If the water continues,

03:52:58.520 --> 03:53:00.520
don't neglect sodium salty food will do.

03:53:00.520 --> 03:53:02.520
Yeah, that's why I'm eating a sausage.

03:53:06.520 --> 03:53:08.520
I will slay away in the kitchen for you.

03:53:08.520 --> 03:53:10.520
This is the things I get.

03:53:10.520 --> 03:53:12.520
I'm sorry you can't cook.

03:53:12.520 --> 03:53:14.520
You're not forgiven.

03:53:14.520 --> 03:53:16.520
Jackass!

03:53:16.520 --> 03:53:18.520
Eat shit and die.

03:53:22.520 --> 03:53:24.520
Come on, I'm joking. It's not that bad. It's fine.

03:53:24.520 --> 03:53:26.520
More than fine.

03:53:28.520 --> 03:53:30.520
Okay, I'm going to stop eating the sausage for a bit.

03:53:40.520 --> 03:53:42.520
I'm trying to like...

03:53:42.520 --> 03:53:44.520
I shouldn't describe anything I'm doing.

03:53:54.520 --> 03:53:56.520
No, I'm not going to describe anything I'm doing.

03:53:56.520 --> 03:53:58.520
I can't.

03:53:58.520 --> 03:54:00.520
I just...

03:54:00.520 --> 03:54:02.520
Okay.

03:54:06.520 --> 03:54:08.520
Okay, okay, okay.

03:54:08.520 --> 03:54:10.520
Yes, yes, it's fantastic.

03:54:10.520 --> 03:54:12.520
In a way, my dumb ass can appreciate.

03:54:12.520 --> 03:54:14.520
How about that?

03:54:16.520 --> 03:54:18.520
Yes, indeed, this cooking is beyond

03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:20.520
my mortal comprehension.

03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:22.520
Correct?

03:54:22.520 --> 03:54:24.520
Out of this world culinary experience,

03:54:24.520 --> 03:54:26.520
which the likes of me cannot even taste properly.

03:54:26.520 --> 03:54:28.520
Because my taste buds simply aren't evolved enough

03:54:28.520 --> 03:54:30.520
to sense all the subtleties.

03:54:30.520 --> 03:54:32.520
I'm not explaining anything to the class.

03:54:32.520 --> 03:54:34.520
In a roundabout way.

03:54:40.520 --> 03:54:42.520
I'm eating a sausage, that's what I'm doing.

03:54:48.520 --> 03:54:50.520
I'm chewing on the sausage, that's what I'm up to.

03:54:52.520 --> 03:54:54.520
So this calorie should only reflect the kings.

03:54:54.520 --> 03:54:56.520
No, gods!

03:54:56.520 --> 03:54:58.520
That's more like it.

03:54:58.520 --> 03:55:00.520
So exquisite is your cooking.

03:55:00.520 --> 03:55:02.520
But I'll write a shitty poem about it.

03:55:02.520 --> 03:55:04.520
Oh god.

03:55:14.520 --> 03:55:16.520
Lo and behold I implore you

03:55:16.520 --> 03:55:18.520
Come feast your eyes on her.

03:55:18.520 --> 03:55:20.520
And oh, and there is food, too.

No, I think you need more water.

03:58:26.280 --> 03:58:28.280
Yeah, okay.

03:58:29.280 --> 03:58:32.280
Okay, yes, yes, more water.

03:58:34.280 --> 03:58:36.280

03:58:39.280 --> 03:58:41.280

Why are you acting so gay?

03:58:46.280 --> 03:58:50.280

Oh my God.

03:58:58.280 --> 03:59:00.280
How much of the bottle is left?

03:59:01.280 --> 03:59:03.280
Like, more than half?

03:59:06.280 --> 03:59:07.280
I don't want to end.

03:59:07.280 --> 03:59:09.280
I mean, I don't want to go.

03:59:09.280 --> 03:59:11.280
I don't want to go. I want to keep going.

03:59:11.280 --> 03:59:13.280
Are you talking to yourself right now?

03:59:13.280 --> 03:59:14.280
You're right.

03:59:14.280 --> 03:59:15.280
What was I thinking?

03:59:15.280 --> 03:59:18.280
You wouldn't even worry if I told you to.

03:59:18.280 --> 03:59:19.280
What?

03:59:19.280 --> 03:59:21.280
Your inability to...

03:59:27.280 --> 03:59:29.280
Was that hot?

03:59:30.280 --> 03:59:31.280
Oh God.

03:59:31.280 --> 03:59:32.280
Are you gay?

03:59:32.280 --> 03:59:33.280
Oh, please.

03:59:33.280 --> 03:59:35.280
Why are you acting so gay?

03:59:35.280 --> 03:59:36.280
More than half?

03:59:36.280 --> 03:59:38.280
We need to fix that.

03:59:38.280 --> 03:59:42.280
Your inability to grasp the weight of the situation is simultaneous.

03:59:42.280 --> 03:59:44.280
Your best and worst quality.

03:59:44.280 --> 03:59:46.280
I've really come to appreciate it.

03:59:46.280 --> 03:59:50.280
Though it pisses me off all the same.

03:59:50.280 --> 03:59:51.280
Thank you.

03:59:52.280 --> 03:59:53.280
You're gay?

03:59:53.280 --> 03:59:54.280
Oh my God.

03:59:54.280 --> 03:59:56.280
Why are you acting so gay?

03:59:56.280 --> 04:00:00.280
Try tapping a few inches below your belly button should holding it in.

04:00:00.280 --> 04:00:01.280
Okay.

04:00:02.280 --> 04:00:04.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:00:04.280 --> 04:00:08.280
Try tapping a few inches below your belly button should holding it in.

04:00:08.280 --> 04:00:09.280
No.

04:00:11.280 --> 04:00:12.280
No.

04:00:12.280 --> 04:00:13.280
I'm not doing that.

04:00:13.280 --> 04:00:14.280
I'm not stupid.

04:00:18.280 --> 04:00:19.280
I'm not stupid.

04:00:25.280 --> 04:00:28.280
I just chose to ignore your knots.

04:00:29.280 --> 04:00:30.280
Are you gay?

04:00:30.280 --> 04:00:32.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:00:32.280 --> 04:00:34.280
Give it a little press.

04:00:42.280 --> 04:00:44.280
I don't want to.

04:00:45.280 --> 04:00:46.280
You can't make me.

04:00:46.280 --> 04:00:47.280
I'm not doing that.

04:00:48.280 --> 04:00:49.280
No.

04:00:51.280 --> 04:00:53.280
It should be fine just to chuck.

04:00:53.280 --> 04:00:55.280
Press for 30?

04:00:57.280 --> 04:00:59.280
Okay press for 30.

04:00:59.280 --> 04:01:00.280
Just one!

04:01:01.280 --> 04:01:03.280
It should be fine to just...

04:01:03.280 --> 04:01:04.280
Are you gay?

04:01:04.280 --> 04:01:06.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:01:06.280 --> 04:01:07.280
Don't be a bad girl.

04:01:07.280 --> 04:01:08.280
Ah!

04:01:10.280 --> 04:01:11.280
I don't care.

04:01:12.280 --> 04:01:13.280
If it makes me...

04:01:13.280 --> 04:01:14.280
Are you gay?

04:01:14.280 --> 04:01:16.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:01:16.280 --> 04:01:18.280

04:01:18.280 --> 04:01:19.280
Ah!

04:01:21.280 --> 04:01:22.280
I don't care.

04:01:23.280 --> 04:01:25.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:01:25.280 --> 04:01:27.280
Just push a bit see what happens.

04:01:27.280 --> 04:01:28.280

04:01:29.280 --> 04:01:30.280

04:01:30.280 --> 04:01:31.280

04:01:38.280 --> 04:01:39.280

04:01:43.280 --> 04:01:44.280
No.

04:01:44.280 --> 04:01:49.280
It should be fine to just chuck this into the trash bin outside, right?

04:01:50.280 --> 04:01:51.280
Okay.

04:01:54.280 --> 04:01:55.280
Are you gay?

04:01:55.280 --> 04:01:57.280

Okay.

04:02:26.280 --> 04:02:29.280

04:02:35.280 --> 04:02:37.280
How do I do it?

04:02:54.280 --> 04:02:55.280

04:02:57.280 --> 04:02:59.280
That was a rough cough.

04:03:01.280 --> 04:03:02.280
Why does nothing...

04:03:03.280 --> 04:03:05.280
Why is 80% saying no?

04:03:05.280 --> 04:03:06.280
It wasn't this bad last time.

04:03:06.280 --> 04:03:07.280

04:03:07.280 --> 04:03:09.280

04:03:09.280 --> 04:03:11.280
Don't give an early this time chat.

04:03:18.280 --> 04:03:19.280

04:03:25.280 --> 04:03:27.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:03:27.280 --> 04:03:28.280
Too bad.

04:03:28.280 --> 04:03:29.280

04:03:37.280 --> 04:03:40.280
You don't seem like you really want to go.

04:03:41.280 --> 04:03:43.280
But I do.

04:03:44.280 --> 04:03:45.280

04:03:45.280 --> 04:03:46.280

Why are you acting so gay?

04:03:48.280 --> 04:03:50.280
Sounds like you need some more sips.

04:03:50.280 --> 04:03:51.280
Hope you don't leak.

04:03:54.280 --> 04:03:55.280

Why are you acting so gay?

04:03:57.280 --> 04:03:58.280
You're a big girl.

04:03:58.280 --> 04:03:59.280
You can take it.

04:04:01.280 --> 04:04:02.280
Are you gay?

04:04:02.280 --> 04:04:03.280

04:04:08.280 --> 04:04:09.280
Oh my god.

04:04:09.280 --> 04:04:11.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:04:11.280 --> 04:04:12.280
Drink up, cutie.

04:04:12.280 --> 04:04:13.280
Orange heart.

04:04:22.280 --> 04:04:23.280
Okay.

04:04:24.280 --> 04:04:25.280
Okay.

04:04:28.280 --> 04:04:29.280
Can we go now?

04:04:29.280 --> 04:04:30.280
Should we go?

04:04:31.280 --> 04:04:32.280
Can we?

04:04:32.280 --> 04:04:33.280
Are you gay?

04:04:33.280 --> 04:04:35.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:04:35.280 --> 04:04:38.280
Almost seems like you shouldn't have talked all that shit earlier.

04:04:40.280 --> 04:04:42.280
I stand by what I said.

04:04:46.280 --> 04:04:47.280
Are you gay?

04:04:47.280 --> 04:04:49.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:04:50.280 --> 04:04:55.280
I don't know it looks like you could hold out a lot longer and plus you have your puppy pad there with you love you and me.

04:04:56.280 --> 04:04:57.280
Are you gay?

04:04:57.280 --> 04:04:59.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:05:00.280 --> 04:05:04.280
Remember chat, there is still another energy level and a safe word we can reach.

04:05:05.280 --> 04:05:06.280
Hold the line.

04:05:08.280 --> 04:05:09.280
You won't.

04:05:09.280 --> 04:05:10.280
We're not getting there.

04:05:10.280 --> 04:05:12.280
We're not getting to the next level.

04:05:15.280 --> 04:05:17.280
Can you help me in the game?

04:05:17.280 --> 04:05:19.280
I don't know what else.

04:05:19.280 --> 04:05:20.280
Are you gay?

04:05:20.280 --> 04:05:22.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:05:22.280 --> 04:05:26.280
Remember chat, we have safe words and she mocked us for giving in.

04:05:26.280 --> 04:05:28.280
I want to push her to her limits.

04:05:28.280 --> 04:05:31.280
Hearing her cutely beg and complain makes my day.

04:05:36.280 --> 04:05:38.280
Oh my god.

04:05:40.280 --> 04:05:43.280
I need to figure out what to do with the bones.

04:05:47.280 --> 04:05:51.280
For now, I'll just collect them all before Ashley distract.

04:05:57.280 --> 04:05:58.280
Okay.

04:06:01.280 --> 04:06:02.280
What do I do with them?

04:06:03.280 --> 04:06:05.280
Are you gay?

04:06:05.280 --> 04:06:07.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:06:08.280 --> 04:06:12.280
Don't worry, we'll let you go when the game is over shouldn't be more than 30 minutes.

04:06:13.280 --> 04:06:16.280
The game isn't finished in 30 minutes, is it?

04:06:16.280 --> 04:06:17.280
Ow!

04:06:17.280 --> 04:06:18.280
Is it?

04:06:29.280 --> 04:06:31.280
The game is done in 30 minutes?

04:06:32.280 --> 04:06:33.280
Really?

04:06:34.280 --> 04:06:36.280
Wait, so what do I do now?

04:06:40.280 --> 04:06:43.280
Wait, there's only two chapters right now?

04:06:43.280 --> 04:06:45.280
Wait, is the game not done?

04:06:46.280 --> 04:06:48.280
Is the game not done?

04:06:49.280 --> 04:06:51.280
I do lack critical information.

04:06:52.280 --> 04:06:53.280
Are you gay?

04:06:53.280 --> 04:06:55.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:06:56.280 --> 04:06:58.280
Sounds like we need to hurry this up.

04:06:59.280 --> 04:07:01.280
It's still being...

04:07:04.280 --> 04:07:06.280
Okay, are you gay?

04:07:06.280 --> 04:07:08.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:07:08.280 --> 04:07:11.280
Get those drinks in before the game is over.

04:07:11.280 --> 04:07:12.280
I'm trying!

04:07:17.280 --> 04:07:20.280
Can you tell me what to do next?

04:07:20.280 --> 04:07:21.280
Are you gay?

04:07:21.280 --> 04:07:23.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:07:23.280 --> 04:07:25.280
You can do it.

04:07:25.280 --> 04:07:28.280
Even though it probably seems like it would feel really good to let go.

04:07:34.280 --> 04:07:37.280
So what about these skulls?

04:07:37.280 --> 04:07:39.280
I'm thinking of throwing those into the...

04:07:40.280 --> 04:07:41.280
Into the...

04:07:46.280 --> 04:07:49.280
Into the ocean along with the rest of the bones.

04:07:50.280 --> 04:07:52.280
So much for making them a bit...

04:07:52.280 --> 04:07:54.280
Oh my god, I can't!

04:07:55.280 --> 04:07:56.280
Oh fuck!

04:07:57.280 --> 04:07:59.280
So much for making them disappear, huh?

04:08:01.280 --> 04:08:02.280
Are you gay?

04:08:02.280 --> 04:08:04.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:08:05.280 --> 04:08:08.280
Think about how good you would feel to leak out just a tiny bit.

04:08:08.280 --> 04:08:09.280
I can't!

04:08:09.280 --> 04:08:10.280
Even if I want to...

04:08:10.280 --> 04:08:12.280
Well, maybe I can try, hold on.

04:08:13.280 --> 04:08:14.280
No, I can't.

04:08:14.280 --> 04:08:17.280
Even if I want to, I can't.

04:08:17.280 --> 04:08:19.280
I literally...

04:08:19.280 --> 04:08:21.280
I literally can't.

04:08:22.280 --> 04:08:25.280
You're not allowed to, it doesn't matter.

04:08:25.280 --> 04:08:26.280
I can't.

04:08:31.280 --> 04:08:32.280
So much for...

04:08:32.280 --> 04:08:33.280
Are you gay?

04:08:33.280 --> 04:08:34.280
Oh my god.

04:08:34.280 --> 04:08:36.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:08:36.280 --> 04:08:37.280
Try again.

04:08:42.280 --> 04:08:43.280
No.

04:08:44.280 --> 04:08:45.280
No, I can't.

04:08:45.280 --> 04:08:46.280
No, I can't.

04:08:50.280 --> 04:08:52.280
So much for making them disappear, huh?

04:08:52.280 --> 04:08:54.280
What did we do all this other crap for?

04:08:55.280 --> 04:08:56.280
I should...

04:08:58.280 --> 04:08:59.280
Hold on.

04:09:01.280 --> 04:09:03.280
I just want to check something real quick.

04:09:03.280 --> 04:09:04.280
Hold on.

04:09:06.280 --> 04:09:08.280
Oh shit, I have the wrong...

04:09:09.280 --> 04:09:11.280
Dammit!

04:09:13.280 --> 04:09:14.280
Are you gay?

04:09:14.280 --> 04:09:16.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:09:17.280 --> 04:09:19.280
That's it, open your mouth and drink.

04:09:21.280 --> 04:09:22.280
Don't say that!

04:09:22.280 --> 04:09:23.280
Don't say that here!

04:09:27.280 --> 04:09:29.280
Okay, okay, okay.

04:09:29.280 --> 04:09:30.280
Are you gay?

04:09:30.280 --> 04:09:32.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:09:32.280 --> 04:09:34.280
Make sure you breathe.

04:09:34.280 --> 04:09:35.280
Think of a happy place.

04:09:35.280 --> 04:09:38.280
Like a waterfall, gushing water everywhere.

04:09:39.280 --> 04:09:40.280
Stop!

04:09:40.280 --> 04:09:42.280
Please, please, are you gay?

04:09:42.280 --> 04:09:44.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:09:45.280 --> 04:09:47.280
I know you can do it, Amy.

04:09:47.280 --> 04:09:48.280
You're a good girl.

04:09:57.280 --> 04:10:00.280
I'm hoping one can't identify someone based on their bones alone.

04:10:00.280 --> 04:10:01.280
The bones float?

04:10:01.280 --> 04:10:03.280
Aren't they kinda like sticks?

04:10:03.280 --> 04:10:05.280
I'll find someone to weigh them...

04:10:05.280 --> 04:10:06.280
Fuck.

04:10:10.280 --> 04:10:11.280
Gay?

04:10:11.280 --> 04:10:13.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:10:13.280 --> 04:10:14.280

04:10:20.280 --> 04:10:21.280

04:10:21.280 --> 04:10:23.280
Why are you acting so gay?

04:10:24.280 --> 04:10:26.280
Just close your eyes and lean back.

04:10:26.280 --> 04:10:27.280
Relax, baby.

04:10:27.280 --> 04:10:28.280
No!

04:10:28.280 --> 04:10:29.280
No!

04:10:29.280 --> 04:10:30.280
No!

04:10:30.280 --> 04:10:32.280
I'm doing another...

04:10:42.280 --> 04:10:43.280
Please.

04:10:44.280 --> 04:10:45.280
Please!

04:10:46.280 --> 04:10:48.280
Please, please, can I go please?

04:10:49.280 --> 04:10:51.280
Why are you saying no?

04:10:54.280 --> 04:10:55.280
Please.

04:10:57.280 --> 04:10:58.280

Drink, drink, drink, drink.

04:11:14.280 --> 04:11:17.280
Get hydrated, get hydrated, get hydrated.

04:18:04.860 --> 04:18:05.860
I go down a level.

04:18:05.860 --> 04:18:06.860
I go down a level.

04:18:06.860 --> 04:18:08.860
There, there, there, there, there, there.

04:18:08.860 --> 04:18:09.860
There.

04:18:09.860 --> 04:18:10.860
Okay.

04:18:10.860 --> 04:18:11.860
I'm at the last level.

04:18:13.860 --> 04:18:14.860
Are you gay?

04:18:14.860 --> 04:18:16.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:18:16.860 --> 04:18:18.860
I haven't heard you drinking, Emmy.

04:18:18.860 --> 04:18:19.860
Bad girl.

04:18:22.860 --> 04:18:24.860
Okay, I'll drink more.

04:18:24.860 --> 04:18:26.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:18:26.860 --> 04:18:29.860
The only thing uncomfortable is how hard I am.

04:18:33.860 --> 04:18:34.860
Are you gay?

04:18:34.860 --> 04:18:36.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:18:36.860 --> 04:18:38.860
Normies and children out.

04:18:38.860 --> 04:18:41.860
Stop complaining and saying it's weird.

04:18:41.860 --> 04:18:43.860
Dude, I don't even know where my phone is.

04:18:43.860 --> 04:18:44.860
Are you gay?

04:18:44.860 --> 04:18:46.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:18:46.860 --> 04:18:48.860
Now, beg for it.

04:18:48.860 --> 04:18:50.860
Oh, fuck you.

04:18:52.860 --> 04:18:53.860
I'm trying to turn on my phone

04:18:53.860 --> 04:18:56.860
so I can literally record what you want.

04:19:01.860 --> 04:19:02.860
Come on.

04:19:02.860 --> 04:19:03.860
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:19:03.860 --> 04:19:04.860
My phone is ready.

04:19:04.860 --> 04:19:05.860
Please.

04:19:05.860 --> 04:19:07.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:19:07.860 --> 04:19:09.860
I want you to have an accident.

04:19:09.860 --> 04:19:10.860
No!

04:19:12.860 --> 04:19:13.860
Please.

04:19:13.860 --> 04:19:14.860
I'm giving you what you want.

04:19:14.860 --> 04:19:15.860
Please, please.

04:19:19.860 --> 04:19:21.860
Please.

04:19:22.860 --> 04:19:24.860
I can't even drink anymore.

04:19:24.860 --> 04:19:25.860
Where I can't.

04:19:25.860 --> 04:19:27.860
Oh my god.

04:19:27.860 --> 04:19:29.860
Why is the pulse so...

04:19:33.860 --> 04:19:35.860
Why is the pulse so...

04:19:36.860 --> 04:19:38.860
Please.

04:19:40.860 --> 04:19:41.860
Chat.

04:19:41.860 --> 04:19:43.860
Chat, please.

04:19:43.860 --> 04:19:44.860
Big brother.

04:19:44.860 --> 04:19:45.860
Only chat.

04:19:45.860 --> 04:19:47.860
Whatever you want me to call you.

04:19:47.860 --> 04:19:48.860
I don't care.

04:19:48.860 --> 04:19:49.860
Please.

04:19:50.860 --> 04:19:53.860
I'll fucking call you OG-san if you want.

04:19:53.860 --> 04:19:55.860
I'll do anything, please.

04:19:55.860 --> 04:19:57.860
I'll do anything, please, please, please.

04:19:57.860 --> 04:19:59.860
Please.

04:20:02.860 --> 04:20:03.860
Are you gay?

04:20:03.860 --> 04:20:05.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:20:05.860 --> 04:20:06.860
Do.

04:20:06.860 --> 04:20:07.860
Not.

04:20:07.860 --> 04:20:08.860
Give.

04:20:08.860 --> 04:20:09.860
In.

04:20:09.860 --> 04:20:11.860
Well, it's not 51%.

04:20:11.860 --> 04:20:12.860
That's basically it.

04:20:12.860 --> 04:20:13.860
Come on, it's not 51.

04:20:13.860 --> 04:20:14.860
That's 150.

04:20:14.860 --> 04:20:16.860
Please, that's literally more than 50.

04:20:16.860 --> 04:20:17.860
It's not 52 now.

04:20:17.860 --> 04:20:19.860
It's the only way to end.

04:20:19.860 --> 04:20:20.860
Huh?

04:20:20.860 --> 04:20:21.860
No.

04:20:22.860 --> 04:20:23.860
Are you gay?

04:20:23.860 --> 04:20:24.860
It's not 52.

04:20:24.860 --> 04:20:26.860
I can go, I can go, I can go, I can go.

04:20:26.860 --> 04:20:28.860
Sweetie, be a good girl and do it.

04:20:28.860 --> 04:20:30.860
You know we both want it.

04:20:33.860 --> 04:20:34.860
Fuck.

04:20:34.860 --> 04:20:35.860
Okay.

04:20:35.860 --> 04:20:37.860
I'm taking the iPhone because...

04:20:37.860 --> 04:20:38.860
Wait.

04:20:38.860 --> 04:20:39.860
Maybe I can get another phone.

04:20:39.860 --> 04:20:40.860
Hold on.

04:20:40.860 --> 04:20:42.860
I have an old phone somewhere.

04:20:42.860 --> 04:20:43.860
My phone died.

04:20:43.860 --> 04:20:44.860
What do I do?

04:20:44.860 --> 04:20:45.860
What do I do?

04:20:45.860 --> 04:20:47.860
Don't be a bad girl.

04:20:47.860 --> 04:20:48.860
Oh my god.

04:20:51.860 --> 04:20:52.860
What do I do?

04:20:52.860 --> 04:20:53.860
Should I just take the iPhone?

04:20:53.860 --> 04:20:55.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:20:55.860 --> 04:20:57.860
Try pressing on your stomach a little.

04:20:57.860 --> 04:20:58.860
Shut up.

04:20:58.860 --> 04:20:59.860
Okay, I'm taking the iPhone.

04:20:59.860 --> 04:21:00.860
You're going to lose tracking.

04:21:00.860 --> 04:21:02.860
My other phone died.

04:21:04.860 --> 04:21:05.860
Are you gay?

04:21:05.860 --> 04:21:07.860
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:21:07.860 --> 04:21:08.860
Bye, bye, bye.

04:21:08.860 --> 04:21:09.860
It's 52 now.

04:21:13.860 --> 04:21:14.860
Wait, why does it say no?

04:21:14.860 --> 04:21:15.860
Are you gay?

04:21:15.860 --> 04:21:17.860
Wait, why does it say that no one?

04:21:17.860 --> 04:21:18.860
Wait, I was literally about to go.

04:21:18.860 --> 04:21:20.860
It's at 52 for no breath.

04:21:20.860 --> 04:21:21.860
Wait, I was literally about to go.

04:21:21.860 --> 04:21:22.860
What do you mean?

04:21:22.860 --> 04:21:23.860
What do you mean?

04:21:23.860 --> 04:21:24.860
What do you mean?

04:21:24.860 --> 04:21:25.860
What do I do?

04:21:25.860 --> 04:21:26.860
Are you gay?

04:21:26.860 --> 04:21:27.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:21:27.860 --> 04:21:29.860
I was literally just about to go.

04:21:29.860 --> 04:21:30.860
Here.

04:21:30.860 --> 04:21:31.860
Right.

04:21:31.860 --> 04:21:32.860
Now.

04:21:32.860 --> 04:21:35.860
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:21:35.860 --> 04:21:36.860
Please.

04:21:36.860 --> 04:21:37.860
Please.

04:21:38.860 --> 04:21:39.860
What do you want?

04:21:42.860 --> 04:21:43.860
What do you want?

04:21:47.860 --> 04:21:48.860
I don't even...

04:21:49.860 --> 04:21:50.860
What do I do?

04:21:50.860 --> 04:21:51.860
What do you want me to do?

04:21:52.860 --> 04:21:53.860
Gay?

04:21:53.860 --> 04:21:55.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:21:55.860 --> 04:21:57.860
Looks like someone can't see straight.

04:21:58.860 --> 04:21:59.860
What?

04:22:01.860 --> 04:22:02.860
I can't.

04:22:02.860 --> 04:22:03.860
I can't.

04:22:03.860 --> 04:22:04.860
I can't go.

04:22:04.860 --> 04:22:05.860
I'm not going here.

04:22:07.860 --> 04:22:09.860
Please ask nicely again.

04:22:11.860 --> 04:22:16.860
I literally got my phone ready for it and everything.

04:22:18.860 --> 04:22:19.860
Shit.

04:22:21.860 --> 04:22:23.860
Fuck a prison lock button.

04:22:23.860 --> 04:22:25.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:22:25.860 --> 04:22:26.860
You know what it is, Emmy.

04:22:26.860 --> 04:22:28.860
IDD feels so good.

04:22:29.860 --> 04:22:30.860
No.

04:22:33.860 --> 04:22:34.860
Please.

04:22:34.860 --> 04:22:36.860
I'm asking nicely.

04:22:36.860 --> 04:22:37.860
I'm sorry.

04:22:37.860 --> 04:22:39.860
The tracking is gone.

04:22:39.860 --> 04:22:40.860
I'm ready.

04:22:40.860 --> 04:22:42.860
I'm ready to do what you want.

04:22:42.860 --> 04:22:43.860
Please.

04:22:43.860 --> 04:22:44.860
Just let me call.

04:22:45.860 --> 04:22:47.860
Please let me call.

04:22:47.860 --> 04:22:48.860
Are you gay?

04:22:48.860 --> 04:22:50.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:22:50.860 --> 04:22:53.860
I still feel like you can hurt a bit longer.

04:22:53.860 --> 04:22:55.860
No, I can't.

04:22:55.860 --> 04:22:56.860
I can't.

04:22:56.860 --> 04:22:57.860
I seriously can't.

04:22:57.860 --> 04:22:58.860
Gay?

04:22:58.860 --> 04:23:00.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:23:00.860 --> 04:23:01.860
I'm literally done.

04:23:01.860 --> 04:23:03.860
Remind me what the safe word was again.

04:23:08.860 --> 04:23:09.860
I don't want to say it.

04:23:11.860 --> 04:23:15.860
The safe word was rats.

04:23:15.860 --> 04:23:16.860
Rats.

04:23:16.860 --> 04:23:17.860
There.

04:23:17.860 --> 04:23:18.860
Are you gay?

04:23:18.860 --> 04:23:19.860
You said it.

04:23:19.860 --> 04:23:20.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:23:20.860 --> 04:23:21.860
Can I please call now?

04:23:21.860 --> 04:23:23.860
Remember when she talked smack chat?

04:23:24.860 --> 04:23:25.860
No.

04:23:25.860 --> 04:23:26.860
I promise.

04:23:26.860 --> 04:23:27.860
That's not the case anymore.

04:23:27.860 --> 04:23:28.860
That's not the case anymore.

04:23:28.860 --> 04:23:30.860
That's not the case anymore.

04:23:31.860 --> 04:23:32.860
Go.

04:23:33.860 --> 04:23:34.860
Okay.

04:23:34.860 --> 04:23:35.860
Okay, I'm going.

04:23:35.860 --> 04:23:36.860
I'm going.

04:23:36.860 --> 04:23:37.860
Are you gay?

04:23:37.860 --> 04:23:39.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:23:39.860 --> 04:23:40.860
Good girl.

04:23:40.860 --> 04:23:41.860
You can go.

04:24:07.860 --> 04:24:08.860
Are you gay?

04:24:08.860 --> 04:24:10.860
Why are you acting so gay?

04:24:12.860 --> 04:24:14.860

Can I save it as a draft?

04:26:41.200 --> 04:26:45.200
Oh my god, what do I do?

04:26:45.200 --> 04:26:49.200
But it's not on- I can't post this on main.

04:26:49.200 --> 04:26:53.200
I can't post this on main.

04:26:53.200 --> 04:26:57.200
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

04:26:57.200 --> 04:27:01.200
Sorry for torturing you but you say please in such a cute way.

04:27:02.200 --> 04:27:05.200
How do you believe it is fried chicken?

04:27:05.200 --> 04:27:09.200
Post it, download it, then delete it?

Can I trust you to download this as soon as possible?

04:27:17.200 --> 04:27:19.200
So I can delete it?

04:27:19.200 --> 04:27:21.200
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

04:27:21.200 --> 04:27:23.200
Because I posted this on main.

04:27:23.200 --> 04:27:27.200
I'm so proud of you. I love you so much. You're my good girl.

I don't know what that means.

04:27:37.200 --> 04:27:41.200
Private main for 5 minutes then download it first.

04:27:45.200 --> 04:27:47.200
We will have in like 10 seconds.

04:27:47.200 --> 04:27:48.200
Are you ready to download it?

04:27:48.200 --> 04:27:50.200
Don't post it, re-upload it to alt.

04:27:50.200 --> 04:27:53.200
Like I can't re-upload it because it's in-

04:27:53.200 --> 04:27:55.200
I recorded it with the in-app twitter thing.

04:27:55.200 --> 04:27:57.200
Here, let me listen to it actually.

04:27:57.200 --> 04:27:59.200
Hold on, I'm muting it so you can't hear it.

04:27:59.200 --> 04:28:01.200
You can't DM it to yourself? No.

04:28:01.200 --> 04:28:05.200
It's like ready to post but it's on my main account.

04:28:05.200 --> 04:28:07.200
Okay, let me listen to it.

04:28:24.200 --> 04:28:28.200
Oh my god, it was all for nothing.

04:28:28.200 --> 04:28:30.200
The audio got fried.

04:28:30.200 --> 04:28:32.200
I don't know what happened.

04:28:32.200 --> 04:28:34.200
It's so fried.

04:28:34.200 --> 04:28:36.200
I promise I'm not joking too.

04:28:38.200 --> 04:28:40.200
It's so...

04:28:40.200 --> 04:28:42.200
Like it sounds deep fried.

04:28:42.200 --> 04:28:44.200
Oh, it's over.

04:28:44.200 --> 04:28:46.200
I promise you I'm not joking.

04:28:46.200 --> 04:28:47.200
I'm sorry.

04:28:47.200 --> 04:28:49.200
I will literally let you listen to it.

04:28:49.200 --> 04:28:50.200
That's how fried it is.

04:28:50.200 --> 04:28:52.200
Like it's so...

04:28:52.200 --> 04:28:54.200
Post it for proof.

04:28:54.200 --> 04:28:56.200
It's deep fried.

04:28:56.200 --> 04:28:58.200
I think it's really really badly.

04:28:58.200 --> 04:29:00.200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:29:00.200 --> 04:29:02.200
Oh...

04:29:02.200 --> 04:29:04.200
Let us listen.

04:29:04.200 --> 04:29:06.200
Okay, hold on, let me continue listening.

04:29:12.200 --> 04:29:14.200
Like it literally sounds like...

04:29:14.200 --> 04:29:16.200
Okay, can we hear it?

04:29:16.200 --> 04:29:18.200
No, it's like really...

04:29:18.200 --> 04:29:20.200
I'll post it for like 5 seconds.

04:29:22.200 --> 04:29:24.200
And then let you download it.

04:29:24.200 --> 04:29:26.200
But it's do another recording later.

04:29:26.200 --> 04:29:30.200
The universe didn't want me to do this.

04:29:32.200 --> 04:29:34.200
Okay, let me listen to the full thing.

04:29:34.200 --> 04:29:36.200
It's like about a minute long.

04:29:55.200 --> 04:29:58.200
It sounds like a robot pissing.

04:30:00.200 --> 04:30:02.200
Oh, it sounds like a robot.

04:30:02.200 --> 04:30:04.200
Oh man, I'm so sorry.

04:30:04.200 --> 04:30:06.200
I don't know what happened.

04:30:06.200 --> 04:30:08.200
I am using a refurbished iPhone.

04:30:08.200 --> 04:30:10.200
So it's possible it's kind of broken still.

04:30:14.200 --> 04:30:16.200
I'm in debt to you.

04:30:16.200 --> 04:30:18.200
Are you acting so gay?

04:30:18.200 --> 04:30:20.200
iPhone mic claims another victim.

04:30:20.200 --> 04:30:22.200
It's the thought that counts at least.

04:30:22.200 --> 04:30:24.200
Okay, I'm gonna post it for like...

04:30:24.200 --> 04:30:26.200
Not even 5 minutes.

04:30:28.200 --> 04:30:30.200
Here's your robot pissing.

04:30:30.200 --> 04:30:32.200
There.

04:30:34.200 --> 04:30:36.200
I'm so sorry.

04:30:38.200 --> 04:30:42.200
The first audio recording I did on this phone was fine too.

04:30:42.200 --> 04:30:44.200
Okay, well...

04:30:46.200 --> 04:30:48.200
Please get ready to download it, okay?

04:30:48.200 --> 04:30:50.200
Post.

04:30:52.200 --> 04:30:54.200
I truly don't know what happened.

04:31:00.200 --> 04:31:02.200
Maybe it won't be deep fried once I post it.

04:31:08.200 --> 04:31:10.200
I'm nookin' this vlog.

04:31:10.200 --> 04:31:12.200
Absolutely not.

04:31:16.200 --> 04:31:18.200
I guess it was just my phone that deep fried it.

04:31:24.200 --> 04:31:26.200
No, that was an accident.

04:31:26.200 --> 04:31:28.200
That was an accident.

04:31:28.200 --> 04:31:30.200
I didn't know who would play.

04:31:30.200 --> 04:31:34.200
I didn't know who would play in the desktop audio.

04:31:36.200 --> 04:31:38.200
Okay.

04:31:40.200 --> 04:31:42.200
I can't believe I uploaded that on main.

04:31:46.200 --> 04:31:48.200
Okay, it's gone now though, right?

04:31:56.200 --> 04:31:58.200
Oh my god, okay.

04:32:00.200 --> 04:32:02.200
I'm trying to find vtube studio. Hold on.

04:32:04.200 --> 04:32:06.200
I hate myself. I'm so fucking stupid.

04:32:06.200 --> 04:32:08.200
I can't believe I fucking did that. What's wrong with me?

04:32:10.200 --> 04:32:12.200
What's wrong with me?

04:32:12.200 --> 04:32:14.200
What's wrong with me?

04:32:16.200 --> 04:32:18.200
Okay, there's your tracking.

04:32:20.200 --> 04:32:24.200
I fucking play that on stream like a dumb bitch.

04:32:34.200 --> 04:32:36.200
Good job, big bro is proud of you.

04:32:36.200 --> 04:32:40.200
You can give yourself a pat on the back for doing so well.

04:32:40.200 --> 04:32:42.200
Good girl, I'm proud of you.

04:32:42.200 --> 04:32:44.200
Pampering isn't bound.

04:32:46.200 --> 04:32:48.200
Thank you.

04:32:50.200 --> 04:32:54.200
I was so scared that it got deep fried because it was deep fried on my phone.

04:32:56.200 --> 04:32:58.200
Alright, good thing it's not.

04:33:00.200 --> 04:33:02.200
Feel free to save that.

04:33:02.200 --> 04:33:06.200
I'm not reposting it to my NSFW today.

04:33:06.200 --> 04:33:08.200
If you saved it, you saved it.

04:33:08.200 --> 04:33:10.200
It's tough luck.

04:33:14.200 --> 04:33:16.200
Right.

04:33:18.200 --> 04:33:20.200
What do I do now?

04:33:26.200 --> 04:33:32.200
I don't think I'll make it to another P.

04:33:32.200 --> 04:33:36.200
I would like to finish the game.

04:33:36.200 --> 04:33:38.200
Yes, please help me finish the game.

04:33:44.200 --> 04:33:48.200
Let me know when you've gotten the teeth and bones and rocks sorted out.

04:33:48.200 --> 04:33:52.200
It's already posted like seven times.

04:33:52.200 --> 04:33:54.200
Okay.

04:33:54.200 --> 04:33:56.200
Pam.

04:34:00.200 --> 04:34:02.200
What do I do?

04:34:06.200 --> 04:34:08.200
I don't have to hold it anymore.

04:34:08.200 --> 04:34:10.200
Should we just finish the stream normally?

04:34:14.200 --> 04:34:16.200
Rocks in the garden.

04:34:16.200 --> 04:34:18.200
Okay.

04:34:20.200 --> 04:34:22.200
Right here.

04:34:24.200 --> 04:34:26.200
And then what?

04:34:34.200 --> 04:34:36.200
Yeah, we might as well finish.

04:34:36.200 --> 04:34:38.200
I want to finish it.

04:34:38.200 --> 04:34:40.200
What do I do with rocks?

04:34:44.200 --> 04:34:46.200
Are you gay?

04:34:46.200 --> 04:34:48.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:34:48.200 --> 04:34:50.200
You did great, Emmy.

04:34:50.200 --> 04:34:52.200
I look forward to next time we can bully and spoil you.

04:34:52.200 --> 04:34:54.200
Love you so much.

04:34:54.200 --> 04:34:56.200
My cutest little sister.

04:34:56.200 --> 04:34:58.200
Are you gay?

04:34:58.200 --> 04:35:00.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:35:00.200 --> 04:35:02.200
Thanks for being the best sister ever.

04:35:04.200 --> 04:35:06.200
Thank you.

04:35:06.200 --> 04:35:08.200
Sorry, I should probably mute the alert sound.

04:35:08.200 --> 04:35:10.200
It's probably annoying.

04:35:14.200 --> 04:35:16.200
Do we have enough time to get another low energy?

04:35:16.200 --> 04:35:18.200
No, we don't.

04:35:18.200 --> 04:35:20.200
No, we don't.

04:35:20.200 --> 04:35:22.200
I'm literally so...

04:35:24.200 --> 04:35:26.200
All that remains now is cleaning up the basement.

04:35:26.200 --> 04:35:28.200
Do we have to?

04:35:28.200 --> 04:35:30.200
Obviously.

04:35:30.200 --> 04:35:32.200
Why?

04:35:32.200 --> 04:35:34.200
Oh, I can finish my sausage now.

04:35:40.200 --> 04:35:42.200
Okay.

04:35:46.200 --> 04:35:48.200
We're going to live here, right?

04:35:50.200 --> 04:35:52.200
Are you gay?

04:35:52.200 --> 04:35:54.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:35:54.200 --> 04:35:56.200
Such a good girl, Emmy.

04:35:56.200 --> 04:35:58.200
So is there a round 3?

04:35:58.200 --> 04:36:00.200
No.

04:36:04.200 --> 04:36:06.200
Thank you for calling me a good girl, though.

04:36:12.200 --> 04:36:14.200
Are you gay?

04:36:14.200 --> 04:36:16.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:36:16.200 --> 04:36:18.200
Are you good?

04:36:18.200 --> 04:36:20.200
Did we go too hard on you?

04:36:22.200 --> 04:36:24.200
I'm okay.

04:36:26.200 --> 04:36:28.200
I'm okay.

04:36:36.200 --> 04:36:38.200
Okay, I finished my sausage.

04:36:48.200 --> 04:36:50.200
Thank you for all the praises.

04:37:04.200 --> 04:37:06.200
They have coworkers, friends, other family beside us.

04:37:06.200 --> 04:37:08.200
What a bunch of whores.

04:37:08.200 --> 04:37:10.200
Why weren't they happy with just each other?

04:37:10.200 --> 04:37:12.200
I didn't imply they fucked any of them.

04:37:12.200 --> 04:37:14.200
Irrelevant.

04:37:14.200 --> 04:37:16.200
It's all the same.

04:37:16.200 --> 04:37:18.200
Anyway, they can't go all up.

04:37:18.200 --> 04:37:20.200
They can't all go haven't heard from those two in a while.

04:37:20.200 --> 04:37:22.200
Oh well.

04:37:22.200 --> 04:37:24.200
Someone's going to come looking with the authorities.

04:37:24.200 --> 04:37:26.200
And who will they find here?

04:37:26.200 --> 04:37:28.200
Their children who didn't report their parents missing?

04:37:28.200 --> 04:37:30.200
One whole minute.

04:37:30.200 --> 04:37:32.200
One whole minute.

04:37:32.200 --> 04:37:34.200
One whole minute.

04:37:34.200 --> 04:37:36.200
One whole minute.

04:37:36.200 --> 04:37:38.200
One whole minute.

04:37:38.200 --> 04:37:40.200
One whole minute.

04:37:42.200 --> 04:37:44.200
I am such a good girl.

04:37:54.200 --> 04:37:56.200
And who will they find here?

04:37:56.200 --> 04:37:58.200
Their children who didn't report their parents missing?

04:37:58.200 --> 04:38:00.200
Officer gay?

04:38:00.200 --> 04:38:02.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:38:02.200 --> 04:38:04.200
Good job, Amy.

04:38:04.200 --> 04:38:06.200
You're the best little sister a brother could have.

04:38:06.200 --> 04:38:08.200
Thank you.

04:38:08.200 --> 04:38:10.200
You're the best brother a sister could have.

04:38:10.200 --> 04:38:12.200
How the fuck aren't you dead anyways?

04:38:12.200 --> 04:38:14.200
Are you gay?

04:38:14.200 --> 04:38:16.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:38:16.200 --> 04:38:18.200
You did so well.

04:38:18.200 --> 04:38:20.200
Our beloved little sister.

04:38:20.200 --> 04:38:22.200
Good girl, Amy.

04:38:22.200 --> 04:38:24.200
Aww, thank you.

04:38:24.200 --> 04:38:26.200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

04:38:26.200 --> 04:38:28.200
Aww, thank you.

04:38:28.200 --> 04:38:30.200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

04:38:30.200 --> 04:38:32.200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

04:38:32.200 --> 04:38:34.200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

04:38:34.200 --> 04:38:36.200
If you don't want to stay here, just say so.

04:38:36.200 --> 04:38:38.200
If you don't want to stay here, just say so.

04:38:38.200 --> 04:38:40.200
It's not that I don't want to.

04:38:40.200 --> 04:38:42.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:38:42.200 --> 04:38:44.200
A very good girl and so well trained.

04:38:44.200 --> 04:38:46.200
I love you.

04:38:46.200 --> 04:38:48.200
Well trained?

04:38:48.200 --> 04:38:50.200
I was the one that's supposed to train you.

04:38:50.200 --> 04:38:52.200
I love you too though.

04:38:54.200 --> 04:38:56.200
Okay.

04:38:56.200 --> 04:38:58.200
It's not that I don't want to.

04:38:58.200 --> 04:39:00.200
It's just that I don't think we can.

04:39:00.200 --> 04:39:02.200
It's just that I don't think we can.

04:39:02.200 --> 04:39:04.200
Well, can we at least use their IDs?

04:39:04.200 --> 04:39:06.200
We can be the new Mr.

04:39:06.200 --> 04:39:08.200
We can be the new and improved Mr. and Mrs. Graves.

04:39:10.200 --> 04:39:12.200
Proud of you.

04:39:12.200 --> 04:39:14.200
You did such a good job.

04:39:14.200 --> 04:39:16.200
Thank you.

04:39:16.200 --> 04:39:18.200
It's so nice to get praise like this.

04:39:18.200 --> 04:39:20.200
Oh my god.

04:39:20.200 --> 04:39:22.200
I love aftercare.

04:39:22.200 --> 04:39:24.200
What the fuck?

04:39:24.200 --> 04:39:26.200
Are you gay?

04:39:26.200 --> 04:39:28.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:39:28.200 --> 04:39:30.200
You deserve the praise.

04:39:30.200 --> 04:39:32.200
You are the best.

04:39:32.200 --> 04:39:34.200
Love you and me.

04:39:34.200 --> 04:39:36.200
I love you too.

04:39:36.200 --> 04:39:38.200
Thank you.

04:39:38.200 --> 04:39:40.200
All right.

04:39:40.200 --> 04:39:42.200
Once the authorities start looking for them,

04:39:42.200 --> 04:39:44.200
I'll see what we've been up to with theirs.

04:39:44.200 --> 04:39:46.200
Sorry, Ashley.

04:39:46.200 --> 04:39:48.200
I wish it was that easy.

04:39:48.200 --> 04:39:50.200
Are you gay?

04:39:50.200 --> 04:39:52.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:39:52.200 --> 04:39:54.200
You deserve the praise.

04:39:54.200 --> 04:39:56.200
You are the best.

04:39:56.200 --> 04:39:58.200
Are you gay?

04:39:58.200 --> 04:40:00.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:40:00.200 --> 04:40:02.200
I can't believe Maye Moto

04:40:02.200 --> 04:40:04.200
is so good at grooming her own e-i-chan.

04:40:06.200 --> 04:40:08.200
Own e-i-chan?

04:40:14.200 --> 04:40:16.200
Did she say she'll clean the basement?

04:40:16.200 --> 04:40:18.200
Are you gay?

04:40:18.200 --> 04:40:20.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:40:20.200 --> 04:40:22.200
This dream was amazing.

04:40:22.200 --> 04:40:24.200
You're the best of me.

04:40:24.200 --> 04:40:26.200
I'm glad you liked it.

04:40:30.200 --> 04:40:32.200
I need a mop.

04:40:32.200 --> 04:40:34.200
I'll finally this fucking mop.

04:40:38.200 --> 04:40:40.200
After staring at the mop this whole game.

04:40:44.200 --> 04:40:46.200
I'm kind of disappointed that there's not more to the game.

04:40:50.200 --> 04:40:52.200
Am I done?

04:40:54.200 --> 04:40:56.200
Are you gay?

04:40:56.200 --> 04:40:58.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:40:58.200 --> 04:41:00.200
Pat pat pat pat.

04:41:00.200 --> 04:41:02.200
Get praise.

04:41:02.200 --> 04:41:04.200
Get praise.

04:41:04.200 --> 04:41:06.200
Get praise.

04:41:06.200 --> 04:41:08.200
Get praise.

04:41:08.200 --> 04:41:10.200
Get praise.

04:41:10.200 --> 04:41:12.200
Get praise.

04:41:12.200 --> 04:41:14.200
Get praise.

04:41:14.200 --> 04:41:16.200
This one?

04:41:16.200 --> 04:41:18.200
No blind.

04:41:18.200 --> 04:41:20.200
Okay.

04:41:20.200 --> 04:41:22.200
Take it.

04:41:30.200 --> 04:41:32.200
So gay?

04:41:32.200 --> 04:41:34.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:41:34.200 --> 04:41:36.200
After the stream is done.

04:41:36.200 --> 04:41:38.200
I'm going to have my own accident.

04:41:38.200 --> 04:41:42.200
Have you been holding it in too or something?

04:41:44.200 --> 04:41:48.200
More content is a bit delayed to her estimate from what I've heard.

04:41:48.200 --> 04:41:50.200
Really? That's a shame.

04:41:50.200 --> 04:41:52.200
It's a good game.

04:41:52.200 --> 04:41:54.200
Are you gay?

04:41:54.200 --> 04:41:56.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:41:56.200 --> 04:42:00.200
After all that torturing you deserve all the praising and love of me.

04:42:00.200 --> 04:42:02.200
I do.

04:42:02.200 --> 04:42:04.200
Are you gay?

04:42:04.200 --> 04:42:06.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:42:06.200 --> 04:42:08.200
Give me your shrimp play the best ever.

04:42:08.200 --> 04:42:10.200
Can't help but love of me.

04:42:10.200 --> 04:42:12.200
I am the best.

04:42:14.200 --> 04:42:16.200
The creator got doxed.

04:42:16.200 --> 04:42:18.200
The creator got doxed.

04:42:18.200 --> 04:42:20.200
That sucks.

04:42:22.200 --> 04:42:24.200
Oh man.

04:42:24.200 --> 04:42:26.200
Bruh.

04:42:26.200 --> 04:42:28.200
That sucks so much.

04:42:28.200 --> 04:42:30.200
I hope that they can make more.

04:42:30.200 --> 04:42:32.200
I will personally pay for more of the game.

04:42:32.200 --> 04:42:34.200
I will fund it myself if I have to.

04:42:36.200 --> 04:42:40.200
Though there's no way to tell if we missed something still.

04:42:40.200 --> 04:42:42.200
Other than maybe see if you have a dream.

04:42:42.200 --> 04:42:44.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:42:44.200 --> 04:42:46.200
You made so much lemonade today.

04:42:46.200 --> 04:42:48.200
Party face.

04:42:48.200 --> 04:42:50.200
Birthday cake.

04:42:50.200 --> 04:42:52.200
I did.

04:42:54.200 --> 04:42:58.200
I offer two souls so it stands to reason I have at least two visions to come.

04:42:58.200 --> 04:43:02.200
How about I take a nap and see if a disaster awaits?

04:43:02.200 --> 04:43:04.200
Please do.

04:43:04.200 --> 04:43:06.200
Are we sleeping on the couch together?

04:43:06.200 --> 04:43:10.200
The game is still getting developed. The creator is just hiding offline now.

04:43:10.200 --> 04:43:12.200
Okay.

04:43:12.200 --> 04:43:14.200
Just get the creator to do a stream like this.

04:43:14.200 --> 04:43:16.200
Clearly it works for funding.

04:43:16.200 --> 04:43:18.200
I was surprised.

04:43:20.200 --> 04:43:22.200
Now that your mother said there's no need to sleep down here.

04:43:22.200 --> 04:43:24.200
Oh we're sleeping in parents' room.

04:43:24.200 --> 04:43:26.200
So if the game's not done, why are there endings?

04:43:30.200 --> 04:43:32.200
Are you gay?

04:43:32.200 --> 04:43:34.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:43:34.200 --> 04:43:36.200
I know I'm going to have an accident to that audio.

04:43:38.200 --> 04:43:40.200
What?

04:43:40.200 --> 04:43:42.200
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:43:44.200 --> 04:43:46.200
The guest of the game is in production.

04:43:46.200 --> 04:43:48.200
They're basically doing it offline.

04:43:56.200 --> 04:44:00.200
I just want to make sure that I didn't get banked for posting that on main.

04:44:00.200 --> 04:44:02.200
Fuck.

04:44:08.200 --> 04:44:10.200
Hold on.

04:44:10.200 --> 04:44:16.200
I mean it's okay. I'm not logged into Discord so I can't see if that was a bad idea.

04:44:16.200 --> 04:44:18.200
It's okay I deleted it.

04:44:24.200 --> 04:44:26.200
Yeah I didn't post anything.

04:44:26.200 --> 04:44:28.200
I didn't post anything.

04:44:28.200 --> 04:44:32.200
You don't uh could you possibly give any less of a fuck that'd be great?

04:44:32.200 --> 04:44:36.200
Oh do forgive me your highness it's been a week or two.

04:44:36.200 --> 04:44:38.200
Yeah it was an accident sorry.

04:44:38.200 --> 04:44:42.200
And and run out of yours you didn't even remember our parents address.

04:44:42.200 --> 04:44:46.200
Which is of course just as important as this.

04:44:46.200 --> 04:44:50.200
Look it just said that I need to do the...

04:44:50.200 --> 04:44:52.200
I need to hold on to it to have a clear point dream that's it.

04:44:52.200 --> 04:44:56.200
It was in my pockets last time when it happened.

04:44:56.200 --> 04:44:58.200
Then I could hold it this time.

04:45:00.200 --> 04:45:04.200
It gave it to me so maybe it wouldn't work with you.

04:45:04.200 --> 04:45:06.200
What's it hurt to try?

04:45:06.200 --> 04:45:08.200
Are you gay?

04:45:08.200 --> 04:45:10.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:45:10.200 --> 04:45:14.200
Gimme I am proud of you more so than I've ever been proud of anyone or anything before.

04:45:14.200 --> 04:45:16.200
And that pride is constant.

04:45:16.200 --> 04:45:20.200
Keep up all the good work and know that we all love you.

04:45:20.200 --> 04:45:24.200
Aww I love you too.

04:45:24.200 --> 04:45:26.200
Thank you.

04:45:26.200 --> 04:45:28.200
Okay.

04:45:32.200 --> 04:45:34.200
I did get it I just don't care.

04:45:34.200 --> 04:45:36.200
Stop being so selfish all the time let me try.

04:45:36.200 --> 04:45:38.200
It's my trinket.

04:45:38.200 --> 04:45:40.200
Ever heard of sharing?

04:45:40.200 --> 04:45:42.200
How am I supposed to share this?

04:45:42.200 --> 04:45:44.200
Do you want to cut the trinket in half?

04:45:44.200 --> 04:45:46.200
I'm sure that's a great idea.

04:45:46.200 --> 04:45:48.200
No just we're not cutting it.

04:45:48.200 --> 04:45:50.200
That's not it but I'm sure we can both hold it at the same time.

04:45:50.200 --> 04:45:52.200
Let me hold it.

04:45:54.200 --> 04:45:56.200
How are you feeling?

04:45:56.200 --> 04:45:58.200
Relieved.

04:45:58.200 --> 04:46:00.200
See if either of us gets a vision.

04:46:00.200 --> 04:46:02.200
How it's a bit small.

04:46:02.200 --> 04:46:04.200
Between our hands right?

04:46:04.200 --> 04:46:06.200
Oh my how romantic.

04:46:06.200 --> 04:46:08.200
Come again.

04:46:08.200 --> 04:46:10.200
Holding hands when we sleep together.

04:46:10.200 --> 04:46:12.200
Man fuck off.

04:46:12.200 --> 04:46:14.200
Alright forget this goodnight.

04:46:14.200 --> 04:46:16.200
I'm kidding I'm kidding it's fine.

04:46:16.200 --> 04:46:18.200
Though I still think I'm gonna be the only one who has a vision.

04:46:18.200 --> 04:46:20.200
We'll see.

04:46:20.200 --> 04:46:22.200
Good night.

04:46:22.200 --> 04:46:24.200
Good night.

04:46:28.200 --> 04:46:30.200
Fuck this.

04:46:30.200 --> 04:46:32.200
How am I supposed to sleep after you went and said something so off color?

04:46:32.200 --> 04:46:34.200
To us.

04:46:34.200 --> 04:46:36.200
I'll take it.

04:46:36.200 --> 04:46:38.200
If for once she regretted the both of us then I'm happy.

04:46:42.200 --> 04:46:44.200
What?

04:46:44.200 --> 04:46:46.200
Aw nothing goodnight.

04:46:46.200 --> 04:46:48.200
It isn't long until sleep takes you over.

04:46:52.200 --> 04:46:54.200
Get ready get down bad.

04:46:56.200 --> 04:46:58.200
What's about to happen?

04:46:58.200 --> 04:47:00.200
Sucky drawing.

04:47:00.200 --> 04:47:02.200
Oh that's how we get to the place.

04:47:06.200 --> 04:47:08.200
Over here.

04:47:08.200 --> 04:47:10.200
Up here right?

04:47:10.200 --> 04:47:12.200
Over here.

04:47:12.200 --> 04:47:14.200
Huh?

04:47:14.200 --> 04:47:16.200
Down here?

04:47:16.200 --> 04:47:18.200
Wait where do I go?

04:47:28.200 --> 04:47:30.200
Where do I go?

04:47:30.200 --> 04:47:32.200
I won't let me go anywhere.

04:47:34.200 --> 04:47:36.200
Between the drawings and the tv.

04:47:36.200 --> 04:47:38.200
What?

04:47:42.200 --> 04:47:44.200
Thought I'm right?

04:47:44.200 --> 04:47:46.200
Oh.

04:47:46.200 --> 04:47:48.200
No.

04:47:50.200 --> 04:47:52.200
It's not letting me.

04:47:56.200 --> 04:47:58.200
Follow the red path in the drawing.

04:47:58.200 --> 04:48:00.200
But both are not letting me.

04:48:00.200 --> 04:48:02.200
Both are not letting me.

04:48:08.200 --> 04:48:10.200
But I can't go anywhere.

04:48:10.200 --> 04:48:12.200
I can't.

04:48:14.200 --> 04:48:16.200
There's a third pile?

04:48:16.200 --> 04:48:18.200
Oh.

04:48:18.200 --> 04:48:20.200
Oh.

04:48:20.200 --> 04:48:22.200
Oh.

04:48:24.200 --> 04:48:26.200
Oh.

04:48:30.200 --> 04:48:32.200
Oh okay.

04:48:38.200 --> 04:48:40.200
And then

04:48:40.200 --> 04:48:42.200
green.

04:48:42.200 --> 04:48:44.200
We use the green one to draw.

04:48:44.200 --> 04:48:46.200
Yeah yeah yeah I'm so smart.

04:48:46.200 --> 04:48:48.200
Yeah.

04:48:50.200 --> 04:48:52.200
Oh come on.

04:48:52.200 --> 04:48:54.200
I have to go all the way back around.

04:49:04.200 --> 04:49:06.200
Choose the best option for you and Andy to be together.

04:49:08.200 --> 04:49:10.200
I will.

04:49:10.200 --> 04:49:12.200
Of course I will.

04:49:12.200 --> 04:49:14.200
I need a sneeze.

04:49:18.200 --> 04:49:20.200
That was not a cute sneeze.

04:49:20.200 --> 04:49:22.200
What am I supposed to do here?

04:49:24.200 --> 04:49:26.200
Could you draw this garbage?

04:49:26.200 --> 04:49:28.200
Bless you thank you.

04:49:28.200 --> 04:49:30.200
No?

04:49:30.200 --> 04:49:32.200
The tv and you watch each other.

04:49:32.200 --> 04:49:34.200
More importantly this episode is titled Lay Lay and Lay Lay Alone.

04:49:42.200 --> 04:49:44.200
Pink plush.

04:49:44.200 --> 04:49:46.200
Do I take it?

04:49:46.200 --> 04:49:48.200
Doesn't tight.

04:49:50.200 --> 04:49:52.200
I'll take it.

04:50:02.200 --> 04:50:04.200
Here you guys can have a little plushy party.

04:50:08.200 --> 04:50:10.200
Wait what?

04:50:10.200 --> 04:50:12.200
Father plush won't budge.

04:50:12.200 --> 04:50:14.200
Mother plush won't budge.

04:50:14.200 --> 04:50:16.200
Huh.

04:50:16.200 --> 04:50:18.200
Huh.

04:50:18.200 --> 04:50:20.200
What?

04:50:20.200 --> 04:50:22.200
A stool.

04:50:24.200 --> 04:50:26.200
Pink and green sleep together.

04:50:30.200 --> 04:50:32.200
Oh that's so cute.

04:50:36.200 --> 04:50:38.200
Yellow plush won't budge.

04:50:38.200 --> 04:50:40.200
Who are these colors?

04:50:40.200 --> 04:50:42.200
Supposed to be.

04:50:44.200 --> 04:50:46.200
Why is this locked?

04:50:48.200 --> 04:50:50.200
Hmm.

04:50:52.200 --> 04:50:54.200
Still is red herring?

04:50:54.200 --> 04:50:56.200
What does that mean?

04:50:56.200 --> 04:50:58.200
Huh?

04:50:58.200 --> 04:51:00.200
Can I grab plushies?

04:51:00.200 --> 04:51:02.200
Oh there we go now they budge.

04:51:04.200 --> 04:51:06.200
Put them in the soup like we cooked them.

04:51:06.200 --> 04:51:08.200
Yeah.

04:51:08.200 --> 04:51:10.200
Now what?

04:51:12.200 --> 04:51:14.200
Green is julia and purple is nina.

04:51:14.200 --> 04:51:16.200
Oh.

04:51:16.200 --> 04:51:18.200
An empty spot.

04:51:26.200 --> 04:51:28.200
Green between the purple and yellow.

04:51:30.200 --> 04:51:32.200
Wait I'm supposed to put green between the two girls?

04:51:36.200 --> 04:51:38.200
But isn't green andy?

04:51:38.200 --> 04:51:40.200
Green andy?

04:51:44.200 --> 04:51:46.200
Yeah?

04:51:46.200 --> 04:51:48.200
And I'm supposed to put him between the two girls?

04:51:52.200 --> 04:51:54.200
You need to get the Andrew plush

04:51:54.200 --> 04:51:56.200
but read its description of the green plush.

04:52:00.200 --> 04:52:02.200
That's the point.

04:52:08.200 --> 04:52:10.200
Good night.

04:52:10.200 --> 04:52:12.200
Good night.

04:52:12.200 --> 04:52:14.200
Good night.

04:52:14.200 --> 04:52:16.200
Good night.

04:52:16.200 --> 04:52:18.200
So I'm supposed to place the green plush?

04:52:18.200 --> 04:52:20.200
Really?

04:52:22.200 --> 04:52:24.200
I don't want to.

04:52:30.200 --> 04:52:32.200
Okay.

04:52:32.200 --> 04:52:34.200
Can it really?

04:52:34.200 --> 04:52:36.200
Yes it can.

04:52:44.200 --> 04:52:46.200
What do I do?

04:52:50.200 --> 04:52:52.200
Oh purple hussy.

04:52:52.200 --> 04:52:54.200
Yellow flusy.

04:52:54.200 --> 04:52:56.200
Do I put them in the trash?

04:52:58.200 --> 04:53:00.200
Oh! One goes in the trash.

04:53:00.200 --> 04:53:02.200
Hold on.

04:53:02.200 --> 04:53:04.200
Which one do I put in the...

04:53:04.200 --> 04:53:06.200
Does it matter?

04:53:10.200 --> 04:53:12.200
Does it matter which one goes in the trash?

04:53:14.200 --> 04:53:16.200
Yellow?

04:53:16.200 --> 04:53:18.200
Yellow in the trash?

04:53:18.200 --> 04:53:20.200
It matters. Yellow is trash.

04:53:20.200 --> 04:53:22.200
Okay.

04:53:30.200 --> 04:53:32.200
It matters but I'll let you do it again

04:53:32.200 --> 04:53:34.200
if you get it wrong.

04:53:34.200 --> 04:53:36.200
Oh it'll let you do it again.

04:53:38.200 --> 04:53:40.200
Put Andrew in the cage.

04:53:42.200 --> 04:53:44.200
Put him in the cage.

04:53:44.200 --> 04:53:46.200
Got the best thing in the world.

04:53:50.200 --> 04:53:52.200
In the cage you go.

04:53:52.200 --> 04:53:54.200
Are we free?

04:54:00.200 --> 04:54:02.200
Huh?

04:54:08.200 --> 04:54:10.200
Do I put the knife here?

04:54:12.200 --> 04:54:14.200
Oh which one do I put?

04:54:24.200 --> 04:54:26.200
Read the plaque?

04:54:26.200 --> 04:54:28.200
Oh shit!

04:54:28.200 --> 04:54:30.200
Flowers.

04:54:30.200 --> 04:54:32.200
Oh your choice.

04:54:34.200 --> 04:54:36.200
Oh shit.

04:54:38.200 --> 04:54:40.200
It doesn't say anything.

04:54:40.200 --> 04:54:42.200
Oh the plaque over there.

04:54:42.200 --> 04:54:44.200
An emerald evening.

04:54:46.200 --> 04:54:48.200
Okay I put the flowers.

04:54:50.200 --> 04:54:52.200
Huh?

04:54:52.200 --> 04:54:54.200
A broken heart.

04:54:56.200 --> 04:54:58.200
A broken heart.

04:55:02.200 --> 04:55:04.200
Once upon a lousy life.

04:55:06.200 --> 04:55:08.200
The end.

04:55:08.200 --> 04:55:10.200
The order matters.

04:55:10.200 --> 04:55:12.200
Heart, sunshine, broken heart.

04:55:14.200 --> 04:55:16.200
Heart.

04:55:16.200 --> 04:55:18.200
Right?

04:55:26.200 --> 04:55:28.200
Heart.

04:55:30.200 --> 04:55:32.200
Sunshine.

04:55:32.200 --> 04:55:34.200
Broken heart.

04:55:40.200 --> 04:55:42.200
Somehow it seems a highly question

04:55:42.200 --> 04:55:44.200
what I do to take this route.

04:55:46.200 --> 04:55:48.200
I know what I'm about.

04:55:56.200 --> 04:55:58.200
There's nothing on any of these.

04:55:58.200 --> 04:56:00.200
Classmates.

04:56:06.200 --> 04:56:08.200
Parents.

04:56:14.200 --> 04:56:16.200
Dotkey.

04:56:16.200 --> 04:56:18.200
Siblings.

04:56:22.200 --> 04:56:24.200
Friends.

04:56:26.200 --> 04:56:28.200
I don't want to unlock him.

04:56:36.200 --> 04:56:38.200
Am I supposed to do something with him and put him on a plaque?

04:56:40.200 --> 04:56:42.200
Some of them change.

04:56:46.200 --> 04:56:48.200
Siblings.

04:56:48.200 --> 04:56:50.200
Eat it.

04:56:50.200 --> 04:56:52.200
Read it again.

04:56:52.200 --> 04:56:54.200
Friends.

04:56:56.200 --> 04:56:58.200
Parents.

04:57:00.200 --> 04:57:02.200
I'm reading it.

04:57:02.200 --> 04:57:04.200
They're all the same.

04:57:04.200 --> 04:57:06.200
Classmates.

04:57:06.200 --> 04:57:08.200
They're all the same. All the plaques are the same.

04:57:10.200 --> 04:57:12.200
Do I put Andy somewhere?

04:57:14.200 --> 04:57:16.200
You put him on the pedestals. Which one?

04:57:18.200 --> 04:57:20.200
Which one though? All of them?

04:57:26.200 --> 04:57:28.200
Oh. Oh, okay.

04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:34.200
Soulmates.

04:57:38.200 --> 04:57:40.200
I get it now.

04:57:42.200 --> 04:57:44.200
Family.

04:57:48.200 --> 04:57:50.200
This is kind of cute.

04:57:56.200 --> 04:57:58.200
Friends.

04:57:58.200 --> 04:58:00.200
Oh, it's a demon.

04:58:04.200 --> 04:58:06.200
The lemon cupcake memory is back.

04:58:08.200 --> 04:58:10.200
Oh, what are you doing here?

04:58:10.200 --> 04:58:12.200
Penny for your thoughts?

04:58:12.200 --> 04:58:14.200
No deal. Come on, give me one word.

04:58:16.200 --> 04:58:18.200
Mordifying.

04:58:18.200 --> 04:58:20.200
Is this supposed to be the fucking sex ending? Where's the sex?

04:58:20.200 --> 04:58:22.200
Look very closely at me.

04:58:26.200 --> 04:58:28.200
Mordifying.

04:58:32.200 --> 04:58:34.200
Oh, she's got a bite mark on her.

04:58:36.200 --> 04:58:38.200
Big words don't fit in your mouth.

04:58:38.200 --> 04:58:40.200
Yeah?

04:58:40.200 --> 04:58:42.200
Something else.

04:58:42.200 --> 04:58:44.200
Are you gay?

04:58:44.200 --> 04:58:46.200
Why are you acting so gay?

04:58:46.200 --> 04:58:50.200
Emmy, do you think we can have the same relationship as Ashley and Andrew have?

04:58:50.200 --> 04:58:54.200
Because in desperate need, won't you help your brother out?

04:58:54.200 --> 04:58:56.200
I've been giving you tips so far,

04:58:56.200 --> 04:58:58.200
but do you take all kinds of tips?

04:58:58.200 --> 04:59:00.200
Even mine?

04:59:20.200 --> 04:59:22.200
Sorry.

04:59:24.200 --> 04:59:26.200
Yes.

04:59:26.200 --> 04:59:28.200
Yeah, I'll take all kinds of tips from you.

04:59:32.200 --> 04:59:34.200
Oh, yeah.

04:59:34.200 --> 04:59:36.200
So mortified, are you?

04:59:38.200 --> 04:59:40.200
You know I'm easy to distract.

04:59:42.200 --> 04:59:44.200
So guilty conscious you got.

04:59:44.200 --> 04:59:46.200
Guilty conscious you got.

04:59:50.200 --> 04:59:52.200
KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS!

04:59:52.200 --> 04:59:54.200
Come here, you.

04:59:56.200 --> 04:59:58.200
Oh my god!

05:00:00.200 --> 05:00:02.200
The vision ends without you dying.

05:00:02.200 --> 05:00:04.200
So at least there's that, I suppose.

05:00:06.200 --> 05:00:08.200
Choker tug there? Oh fuck, I didn't see it.

05:00:08.200 --> 05:00:10.200
Oh fuck, damn it, okay.

05:00:10.200 --> 05:00:12.200
Well...

05:00:12.200 --> 05:00:14.200
Do you wonder if Andrew saw it too?

05:00:14.200 --> 05:00:16.200
Wait!

05:00:16.200 --> 05:00:18.200
Wait!

05:00:18.200 --> 05:00:20.200
They didn't actually just do it?

05:00:20.200 --> 05:00:22.200
That was all a dream.

05:00:26.200 --> 05:00:28.200
Mayhaps...

05:00:28.200 --> 05:00:30.200
Oh shit, you're awake.

05:00:30.200 --> 05:00:32.200
Well hello to you too.

05:00:32.200 --> 05:00:34.200
Yeah, good morning or evening, I guess.

05:00:34.200 --> 05:00:36.200
Whatever.

05:00:36.200 --> 05:00:38.200
Right, so you're awake.

05:00:38.200 --> 05:00:40.200
Whatever.

05:00:40.200 --> 05:00:42.200
Right, so hey, did you get a vision?

05:00:46.200 --> 05:00:48.200
Probably not.

05:00:50.200 --> 05:00:54.200
Really? Do you see dreams like that a lot then?

05:00:54.200 --> 05:00:56.200
I don't.

05:00:56.200 --> 05:00:58.200
So you did see it?

05:01:00.200 --> 05:01:02.200
Quite the vision, huh big brother?

05:01:02.200 --> 05:01:04.200
That was not a vision.

05:01:04.200 --> 05:01:06.200
The demon is messing with us.

05:01:06.200 --> 05:01:08.200
Yeah, that's it, that's just it.

05:01:08.200 --> 05:01:10.200
It's because we tried to be cheap

05:01:10.200 --> 05:01:12.200
and get two visions for the price of one.

05:01:12.200 --> 05:01:14.200
So it gave us a fake vision instead.

05:01:14.200 --> 05:01:16.200
That's the only explanation that makes sense.

05:01:18.200 --> 05:01:20.200
Oh please.

05:01:20.200 --> 05:01:22.200
I mean, it is your...

05:01:22.200 --> 05:01:24.200
It is your trinket, clearly you were right

05:01:24.200 --> 05:01:26.200
and I wasn't supposed to use it.

05:01:26.200 --> 05:01:28.200
Sure, sure, keep selling it, I'm totally buying it.

05:01:28.200 --> 05:01:30.200
He's on Coville.

05:01:32.200 --> 05:01:34.200
Yeah, you just might!

05:01:34.200 --> 05:01:36.200
Fuck off, do you honestly think that?

05:01:36.200 --> 05:01:38.200
Yes, yes.

05:01:38.200 --> 05:01:40.200
I don't know, you tell me.

05:01:40.200 --> 05:01:42.200
Listen here, you.

05:01:42.200 --> 05:01:44.200
Fucking spare me, I don't want to hear it.

05:01:44.200 --> 05:01:46.200
You just helped me...

05:01:46.200 --> 05:01:48.200
You just helped me desecrate our parents' corpses.

05:01:48.200 --> 05:01:50.200
Yet getting laid is what you're freaking out about?

05:01:52.200 --> 05:01:54.200
No one got laid.

05:01:54.200 --> 05:01:56.200
And you keep telling me I messed up.

05:01:56.200 --> 05:01:58.200
What a joke.

05:01:58.200 --> 05:02:00.200
It's okay, cope.

05:02:04.200 --> 05:02:06.200
We're not like that, are we?

05:02:06.200 --> 05:02:08.200
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:02:10.200 --> 05:02:12.200
I don't know.

05:02:14.200 --> 05:02:16.200
You just come off that way sometimes.

05:02:16.200 --> 05:02:18.200
How so?

05:02:18.200 --> 05:02:20.200
Attach jealous? Oh dear.

05:02:20.200 --> 05:02:22.200
What's that, wishful thinking?

05:02:22.200 --> 05:02:24.200
Tell it to my ex.

05:02:24.200 --> 05:02:26.200
Let's not pretend you don't have a bit of jealous...

05:02:26.200 --> 05:02:28.200
jealous streak yourself.

05:02:28.200 --> 05:02:30.200
Now that's wishful thinking.

05:02:30.200 --> 05:02:32.200
That chance to get over yourself.

05:02:32.200 --> 05:02:34.200
Sigh.

05:02:34.200 --> 05:02:36.200
Yeah, he's so in denial.

05:02:36.200 --> 05:02:38.200
I don't think I need to ask you this,

05:02:38.200 --> 05:02:40.200
but let me anyways.

05:02:40.200 --> 05:02:42.200
It's never gonna come to that, right?

05:02:42.200 --> 05:02:44.200
You and me?

05:02:48.200 --> 05:02:50.200
Never say never.

05:02:50.200 --> 05:02:52.200
Never.

05:02:54.200 --> 05:02:56.200
Never say never, Andrew, my dear.

05:02:56.200 --> 05:02:58.200
Oh my fucking god.

05:03:00.200 --> 05:03:02.200
It's not funny, don't joke about this.

05:03:02.200 --> 05:03:04.200
Why am I getting your hopes up?

05:03:04.200 --> 05:03:06.200
Or maybe something else?

05:03:06.200 --> 05:03:08.200
Every time I laugh, I have to cough.

05:03:10.200 --> 05:03:12.200
Say, did that vision get you?

05:03:12.200 --> 05:03:14.200
I'm out of here.

05:03:14.200 --> 05:03:16.200
Why is this such a massive issue to you?

05:03:16.200 --> 05:03:18.200
We've done worse things together.

05:03:18.200 --> 05:03:20.200
We have?

05:03:22.200 --> 05:03:24.200
I honestly figured it would happen eventually.

05:03:24.200 --> 05:03:26.200
Why, why, why, why are you like this?

05:03:26.200 --> 05:03:28.200
Why would you say this?

05:03:28.200 --> 05:03:30.200
Why would you think this?

05:03:30.200 --> 05:03:32.200
Wow, what a landmine, huh?

05:03:32.200 --> 05:03:34.200
Well, yeah.

05:03:34.200 --> 05:03:36.200
Forget this, forget this whole thing.

05:03:36.200 --> 05:03:38.200
Fine, that was clearly a vision,

05:03:38.200 --> 05:03:40.200
so it'll probably come up sooner or later.

05:03:42.200 --> 05:03:44.200
Well, in your last vision,

05:03:44.200 --> 05:03:46.200
a guy slid her throat to it. Here we are.

05:03:46.200 --> 05:03:48.200
So, let's leave it at that.

05:03:48.200 --> 05:03:50.200
No, stop being in denial.

05:03:50.200 --> 05:03:52.200
Alright, then if you say so.

05:03:56.200 --> 05:03:58.200
Anyway, let's go through Mom and Dad

05:03:58.200 --> 05:04:00.200
into the ocean, yeah?

05:04:00.200 --> 05:04:02.200
Yeah?

05:04:02.200 --> 05:04:04.200
Yeah, we need to corrupt him more.

05:04:04.200 --> 05:04:06.200
Do we go back to the car now?

05:04:12.200 --> 05:04:14.200
Do we break in someone else's car?

05:04:20.200 --> 05:04:22.200
This way is nothing more than parking spots.

05:04:22.200 --> 05:04:24.200
Oh.

05:04:34.200 --> 05:04:36.200
Ah!

05:04:36.200 --> 05:04:38.200
Oh.

05:04:42.200 --> 05:04:44.200
I hate you.

05:04:46.200 --> 05:04:48.200
I don't care, hurry up and pick them up.

05:04:48.200 --> 05:04:50.200
Ah!

05:04:50.200 --> 05:04:52.200
Sorry.

05:04:52.200 --> 05:04:54.200
Is that it?

05:04:56.200 --> 05:04:58.200
Thank God no one is here at this hour.

05:05:00.200 --> 05:05:02.200
Am I almost done or is there like a lot more?

05:05:04.200 --> 05:05:06.200
Can you tell me?

05:05:08.200 --> 05:05:10.200
Well, let me...

05:05:10.200 --> 05:05:12.200
I need to get this.

05:05:14.200 --> 05:05:16.200
Okay.

05:05:16.200 --> 05:05:18.200
Almost done.

05:05:20.200 --> 05:05:22.200
Okay, so don't stray too far into the light.

05:05:22.200 --> 05:05:24.200
Just in case someone does pass by.

05:05:26.200 --> 05:05:28.200
How do I do that?

05:05:28.200 --> 05:05:30.200
Where am I supposed to...

05:05:34.200 --> 05:05:36.200
Huh?

05:05:36.200 --> 05:05:38.200
Oh wait, I'm supposed to...

05:05:38.200 --> 05:05:40.200
Oh, right, right, right.

05:05:40.200 --> 05:05:42.200
Throw them into the ocean.

05:05:44.200 --> 05:05:46.200
Since my bag broke, how do we make sure the skulls sink?

05:05:46.200 --> 05:05:48.200
They'll probably be fine.

05:05:48.200 --> 05:05:50.200
Well, in that case.

05:05:50.200 --> 05:05:52.200
But I can throw further than you.

05:05:54.200 --> 05:05:56.200
Bet you can't.

05:05:56.200 --> 05:05:58.200
Oh yeah, definitely.

05:05:58.200 --> 05:06:00.200
On the count of three.

05:06:02.200 --> 05:06:04.200
One, two...

05:06:04.200 --> 05:06:06.200
Ah!

05:06:06.200 --> 05:06:08.200
Ooh, what's that? Looks like I won!

05:06:08.200 --> 05:06:10.200
Filthy cheat!

05:06:10.200 --> 05:06:12.200
Nope, you never said pushing wasn't allowed.

05:06:12.200 --> 05:06:14.200
Oh yeah?

05:06:14.200 --> 05:06:16.200
Well, here's your fucking prize Jackass.

05:06:16.200 --> 05:06:18.200
It's a fist to the face.

05:06:18.200 --> 05:06:20.200
Aww.

05:06:20.200 --> 05:06:22.200
A hug. Why thank you, thank you.

05:06:23.200 --> 05:06:25.200
I love her screech.

05:06:30.200 --> 05:06:32.200
Fuck, I hate seeing couples happy.

05:06:32.200 --> 05:06:34.200
Goddamn fuck you.

05:06:34.200 --> 05:06:36.200
You're a little different lately.

05:06:36.200 --> 05:06:38.200
Am I no fun anymore?

05:06:40.200 --> 05:06:42.200
Let me think.

05:06:42.200 --> 05:06:44.200
Have you been sleeping lately?

05:06:44.200 --> 05:06:46.200
Are you actually looking for a fight?

05:06:48.200 --> 05:06:50.200
I'm not talking about that, I just mean in general.

05:06:50.200 --> 05:06:52.200
You're an insomnia and nightmares.

05:06:52.200 --> 05:06:54.200
How are those?

05:06:54.200 --> 05:06:56.200
It's been decent all things considered.

05:06:56.200 --> 05:06:58.200
Yeah.

05:06:58.200 --> 05:07:00.200
Unexpectedly, you seem to be doing just fine.

05:07:00.200 --> 05:07:02.200
We're a happy couple.

05:07:06.200 --> 05:07:08.200
We are.

05:07:10.200 --> 05:07:12.200
I'm trying to self-insert, I'm trying!

05:07:12.200 --> 05:07:14.200
Well, don't be happy for me or anything.

05:07:16.200 --> 05:07:18.200
Andy is all grown up and he doesn't need me anymore.

05:07:18.200 --> 05:07:20.200
Andy is dead, I don't think he needs anything.

05:07:22.200 --> 05:07:24.200
Even so, there's the trinket too.

05:07:24.200 --> 05:07:26.200
You're apparently the one, the only one allowed to use it, so there's that.

05:07:26.200 --> 05:07:28.200
I don't know about that, but it certainly showed me one way to keep him around.

05:07:28.200 --> 05:07:30.200
I suppose.

05:07:30.200 --> 05:07:32.200
Right, I'm honestly pissed.

05:07:32.200 --> 05:07:34.200
We don't know what's coming next.

05:07:34.200 --> 05:07:36.200
It's really hard to plan what to do now.

05:07:36.200 --> 05:07:38.200
Ah, right, so what do we do?

05:07:38.200 --> 05:07:40.200
The money has brought us, has brought us some time,

05:07:40.200 --> 05:07:42.200
but we still need to find ourselves newer again.

05:07:42.200 --> 05:07:44.200
Are you okay?

05:07:44.200 --> 05:07:46.200
Why are you acting like that?

05:07:46.200 --> 05:07:48.200
I'm sorry.

05:07:48.200 --> 05:07:50.200
I'm sorry.

05:07:50.200 --> 05:07:52.200
I'm sorry.

05:07:52.200 --> 05:07:54.200
I'm sorry.

05:07:54.200 --> 05:07:56.200
I'm sorry.

05:07:56.200 --> 05:07:58.200
I'm sorry.

05:07:58.200 --> 05:08:00.200
Are you okay?

05:08:00.200 --> 05:08:02.200
Why are you acting so gay?

05:08:02.200 --> 05:08:04.200
I hate hearing couples happy,

05:08:04.200 --> 05:08:06.200
but I thought we were one.

05:08:06.200 --> 05:08:08.200
What happened to our promise?

05:08:08.200 --> 05:08:10.200
I'm sorry, you're right.

05:08:10.200 --> 05:08:12.200
We are a happy couple.

05:08:16.200 --> 05:08:18.200
No, I wouldn't hate us as a happy couple.

05:08:22.200 --> 05:08:24.200
Can't we just live in the car

05:08:24.200 --> 05:08:26.200
and mug random people for a living?

05:08:26.200 --> 05:08:28.200
That's just not going to work

05:08:28.200 --> 05:08:30.200
for very long.

05:08:30.200 --> 05:08:32.200
Every time we try our luck,

05:08:32.200 --> 05:08:34.200
we're more likely to get caught.

05:08:36.200 --> 05:08:38.200
Then we can't buy fake identities.

05:08:38.200 --> 05:08:40.200
I know, people do that sometimes.

05:08:40.200 --> 05:08:42.200
I know people do that sometimes.

05:08:42.200 --> 05:08:44.200
Point me to the guy who sells them,

05:08:44.200 --> 05:08:46.200
and I'll get right on that.

05:08:46.200 --> 05:08:48.200
The cultist club seems like a really sketchy spot.

05:08:50.200 --> 05:08:52.200
We do have something special.

05:08:56.200 --> 05:08:58.200
Maybe someone there knows who sells them.

05:08:58.200 --> 05:09:00.200
Probably not, though.

05:09:00.200 --> 05:09:02.200
Stop being such a defeatist.

05:09:02.200 --> 05:09:04.200
Let's go and take a look-see.

05:09:04.200 --> 05:09:06.200
It's a crap idea.

05:09:06.200 --> 05:09:08.200
It's a crap idea to go anywhere near where the guy...

05:09:08.200 --> 05:09:10.200
It's a crap idea to go anywhere near

05:09:10.200 --> 05:09:12.200
where we killed that guy.

05:09:12.200 --> 05:09:14.200
Also, that motel was the only one

05:09:14.200 --> 05:09:16.200
letting us stay with cash only.

05:09:16.200 --> 05:09:18.200
Fine, but we're leaving the car

05:09:18.200 --> 05:09:20.200
in the random parking lot

05:09:20.200 --> 05:09:22.200
since there's definitely an ongoing

05:09:22.200 --> 05:09:24.200
investigation for that hitman's death.

05:09:24.200 --> 05:09:26.200
I have to cease again.

05:09:32.200 --> 05:09:34.200
Never mind, it was Leon.

05:09:34.200 --> 05:09:36.200
Alright, cool, whatever, let's get going.

05:09:40.200 --> 05:09:42.200
I had a mold here?

05:09:42.200 --> 05:09:44.200
Are you coming or what?

05:09:44.200 --> 05:09:46.200
In a minute, let me finish this.

05:09:48.200 --> 05:09:50.200
Waste of time and money, I love it.

05:09:50.200 --> 05:09:52.200
Waste of time and money, I love it.

05:09:54.200 --> 05:09:56.200
Glad to hear it.

05:10:04.200 --> 05:10:06.200
Episode 3 Burial has been updated.

05:10:08.200 --> 05:10:10.200
I'm literally looking up

05:10:10.200 --> 05:10:12.200
when that episode is coming out.

05:10:12.200 --> 05:10:14.200
I can't do this.

05:10:20.200 --> 05:10:22.200
Oh no,

05:10:22.200 --> 05:10:24.200
sometime in 2020,

05:10:24.200 --> 05:10:26.200
for

05:10:34.200 --> 05:10:36.200
that's it, we don't have a release date.

05:10:36.200 --> 05:10:38.200
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

05:10:38.200 --> 05:10:40.200
I'm so sad, I'm so sad.

05:10:42.200 --> 05:10:44.200
I'm so sad, I'm genuinely

05:10:44.200 --> 05:10:46.200
so sad that I can't keep going.

I would totally do that.

05:13:19.900 --> 05:13:20.900

I'm gonna try...

05:13:30.900 --> 05:13:34.900
Yeah, I'm gonna private the VOD, I'm gonna try editing it, and then I'll try re-uploading it.

05:13:35.900 --> 05:13:36.900

05:13:37.900 --> 05:13:39.900

05:13:56.900 --> 05:13:59.900
I don't remember my password for YouTube, so I don't know how to read it.

Let me go find my fucking YouTube password.

05:14:06.900 --> 05:14:08.900
One minute, I have to find it.
