314160	320160	That's like a lot for a poor Canadian like me.
320160	322160	So yeah.
322160	330160	Alright, the next thing on my list is...
330160	334160	Right, for those who listen to the loot audio, give me feedback.
334160	335160	I want feedback.
335160	339160	Like, like, like, like, uh...
339160	340160	Like, hurt my feelings.
340160	343160	Like literally, if you didn't like it, like tell me.
343160	345160	Like, tell me what was wrong with it, you know?
345160	346160	Did we miss the Canadian accent?
346160	348160	I don't think I have a Canadian accent.
348160	349160	It was my French.
349160	352160	My French is very like...
352160	354160	My French is very Canadian.
354160	362160	I went to a French school, like, up until college.
362160	365160	Yeah.
365160	367160	Is my music on?
367160	368160	It is.
368160	374160	I was enrolled in a French school since birth until I went to college.
374160	377160	And then I went to an English college.
377160	379160	Did you have a Patreon as well?
379160	380160	Yes, we do.
380160	382160	It's in the description.
382160	384160	There was an audio.
384160	385160	Bro, you guys don't know?
385160	386160	What the hell?
386160	388160	It was not French immersion.
388160	389160	It was not French immersion.
389160	390160	It was fully French.
390160	392160	We did everything in French at that school.
392160	395160	All the teachers spoke French to us.
395160	397160	I kind of hated it.
397160	398160	But you know, whatever.
398160	400160	Now I learned French.
400160	403160	Ow.
403160	406160	I'm sipping on some tea for my throat.
406160	407160	It was helpful.
407160	408160	Okay, hold on.
408160	410160	I'm scrolling up so I can see if anyone...
410160	411160	Why can't I scroll up?
411160	413160	Fucking YouTube chat.
413160	414160	I had nothing to say about it.
414160	416160	It was my first ASMR.
416160	417160	Oh.
417160	418160	I think your accent is cute.
418160	420160	Oh, thank you.
420160	423160	Okay, well, if you have complaints...
423160	424160	I don't know.
424160	425160	Send me a marshmallow.
425160	426160	Tell me, okay?
427160	428160	Is the delay high?
428160	430160	The delay for chat might be high.
430160	431160	What kind of tea?
431160	432160	It's raspberry tea.
432160	433160	Um...
437160	438160	Oh my god.
438160	439160	What else?
439160	440160	What else?
441160	442160	Okay.
442160	444160	Next I have some slides.
444160	445160	Yup.
447160	448160	Didn't even know there was a voice?
448160	449160	What voice?
451160	452160	Voice?
453160	457160	Thank you for all the support that we've received, by the way, too.
457160	458160	I was so surprised.
458160	461160	I thought there was going to be like 500 people at the debut.
461160	464160	And we had like 2,000 something.
464160	465160	I was like, damn.
466160	468160	I was not expecting that.
469160	472160	I really appreciate that you guys showed up.
474160	476160	I'm not always going to be like...
476160	479160	I'm not always going to be super high energy during streams,
479160	481160	but I'm also not always going to be super low energy.
481160	482160	It just depends on the day.
482160	484160	And today is a sick day.
484160	486160	Right, so I have some slides to show you.
489160	490160	How do I present these?
490160	491160	Okay.
492160	493160	Present.
493160	494160	All right.
502160	503160	Okay.
504160	506160	I gotta go back to old chat.
506160	507160	Okay, there we go.
507160	508160	Um...
510160	511160	Nope, that's the wrong one.
514160	515160	Nope, that's also the wrong one.
515160	516160	Okay, okay.
516160	517160	I'm figuring it out.
517160	518160	I'm figuring it out.
518160	519160	One moment, please.
531160	532160	Window capture.
533160	534160	Sure.
534160	535160	There it is.
537160	538160	All right.
541160	542160	Okay.
547160	548160	Oh.
550160	552160	I hope I don't crop anything out.
557160	558160	There's my...
559160	561160	Maybe I should even put it a little higher up
561160	564160	because chat is kind of covering it.
564160	568160	Here's my 2.0 slides.
571160	575160	So I will mostly talk about myself and then...
576160	579160	And then maybe we can talk about you at the end.
580160	581160	We'll see, we'll see.
581160	583160	And I'll probably answer marshmallow questions too
583160	584160	at the end.
584160	587160	So right, here is the 2.0.
587160	590160	Emmy's list of very important info.
590160	592160	Memorize it all.
594160	597160	You're gonna get tested on it at the end.
597160	598160	Next.
598160	599160	Okay.
599160	601160	Ignore the fact that I'm using camera.
602160	603160	We're pro streamers.
604160	605160	Oh, hi, Mercy.
605160	606160	Good, good, good.
606160	607160	Remember it all.
609160	610160	Okay.
610160	611160	Who is Emmy?
611160	612160	What?
614160	615160	What?
615160	617160	Emmy was living.
618160	619160	Right.
619160	620160	Okay.
620160	622160	Full paw and V-tubing, I know.
622160	624160	Right, so, uh,
624160	627160	Vealer have allowed us to be
627160	629160	open about our PLs.
629160	633160	Obviously, don't go and bother the other girls
633160	634160	about theirs.
634160	636160	If they don't want to say it,
636160	638160	they don't have to say it, you know?
638160	641160	If they want to keep it private, that's okay.
641160	644160	I am not keeping it private
644160	646160	because a lot of you already know.
649160	650160	Right, yeah.
651160	653160	And also, my voice is pretty recognizable.
653160	654160	So, like,
656160	657160	possible lover.
657160	658160	No, it means past life.
659160	660160	Right, yeah.
660160	662160	My voice is really recognizable.
664160	666160	So, to me, it's like,
666160	667160	what's the point?
667160	669160	Unless I had, like, you know,
669160	671160	some closets in my,
671160	675160	some skeletons in my closet to hide.
676160	677160	I don't, but,
678160	681160	you know, if you do, I understand
681160	683160	if you want to hide your past account,
683160	684160	but I'm not going to do that.
684160	685160	Like, and,
685160	686160	God, I'm so scattered brain.
686160	688160	Like, in terms of V-tubers
688160	690160	who join companies doing that,
690160	692160	it's okay, like,
692160	693160	I don't judge the ones who hide it,
693160	695160	but I didn't want to hide it.
695160	696160	So, yeah.
697160	699160	Go watch my other content.
699160	701160	It's really good, and I like it,
701160	702160	so I hope you will also like it.
703160	704160	Who is living?
704160	706160	You just search Liberty on YouTube.
706160	707160	Yeah.
707160	708160	Just how, the way I spelled it here,
708160	709160	you can just search that,
709160	711160	and if you want to go watch the other content.
713160	715160	Oh my God, am I running out of tea already?
716160	717160	I am.
720160	722160	Yes, it's great to be back.
722160	724160	It was so fucking hard.
724160	726160	Staying away from you,
726160	727160	you don't fucking understand.
727160	728160	You don't understand.
730160	732160	You don't understand how hard it was
732160	733160	to not stream.
734160	735160	God, I'm getting voice cracks.
735160	736160	To not stream.
736160	738160	To not tweet.
738160	740160	To not make any videos,
740160	743160	because I had to work on viewer stuff.
744160	745160	It was killing me, bro.
747160	749160	But I'm really happy to be back now,
749160	751160	and I'm really happy to be able
751160	754160	to continue making content for you guys
754160	756160	with the support of viewer.
756160	757160	And the other girls too.
757160	759160	Go support the other girls too.
761160	762160	Right, so,
763160	764160	man,
765160	767160	I'm kind of covering my own,
769160	771160	I'm kind of covering my own thing here.
771160	773160	Oh fuck, I'm locked.
775160	776160	Right.
777160	778160	So don't,
778160	780160	don't go on my old channel
780160	781160	and be like,
781160	782160	guys, I found her,
782160	783160	she's gonna be, she's gonna be,
783160	784160	go subscribe.
784160	785160	Don't do that.
785160	787160	I will announce it myself.
787160	788160	So you don't have to do that.
788160	790160	Okay, don't even worry about it.
791160	793160	Don't go, don't go reading the other channel
793160	794160	and being like,
794160	795160	I found her,
795160	797160	I will do that for you, okay?
797160	799160	I'll make an announcement.
799160	801160	When YouTube stops calling our subscribers,
801160	803160	because I don't want to make an announcement,
803160	805160	and then everyone who comes and subscribes
805160	806160	gets cold.
807160	808160	That's like,
808160	809160	that's annoying.
811160	813160	Sorry, let me, let me try to read chat.
816160	817160	Pretty cool that you can make loot content,
817160	819160	though obviously you have to do other stuff on,
819160	821160	sites other than YouTube.
824160	826160	Oh, what do you mean we have to do other stuff?
827160	829160	We don't have to do anything on,
829160	831160	on any other sites other than YouTube.
831160	833160	Unless you're talking about Patreon content,
833160	835160	but we signed up knowing that we had to do that.
839160	841160	You know someone stupid enough to do that anyways?
841160	842160	Yes,
842160	844160	I know multiple people stupid enough to do that.
845160	846160	Okay.
846160	847160	Okay.
855160	856160	All right.
856160	858160	Conclusion, good company, I appreciate that.
858160	859160	Yeah.
861160	862160	Next slide.
865160	866160	Next slide, where's my slides?
866160	867160	Okay, there's my slides.
867160	869160	All right, stuff I want to mention.
873160	874160	Five out of ten?
874160	876160	That was, that was like, at least a six out of ten.
876160	877160	Right.
877160	879160	I want to do fanzly streams eventually.
880160	883160	But we will have to wait until around July.
884160	886160	Maybe more, I don't, I don't know.
889160	891160	But at least July,
891160	893160	because I think Strani said like,
893160	898160	oh, we have to establish ourselves on YouTube first.
899160	901160	Yeah, they're very supportive of the talents.
901160	902160	That's why I joined.
905160	906160	Next point.
906160	908160	I'm a little bit mentally ill,
908160	910160	but we're not going to talk about it.
911160	913160	And I will never bring it up to you.
913160	915160	Just know if I do some wax shit,
915160	917160	or if you see some wax shit, you know.
919160	920160	C'est la vie.
922160	923160	Oh yeah, right.
927160	930160	Okay, so I know my shtick is like,
930160	931160	cis con, right?
931160	934160	A sister con,
934160	936160	what does con mean?
936160	939160	Consensual convention.
943160	944160	Blue Twitch?
944160	945160	Oh, you mean fanzly?
947160	948160	Brocon, whatever.
948160	949160	Oh, complex.
949160	950160	Complex.
950160	953160	What does it end with an N if it means complex?
955160	956160	Okay, well.
957160	961160	Yeah, I know my little shtick here is cis con.
961160	963160	My rats are fighting in the background.
963160	964160	Oh my god.
968160	969160	Did you hear that?
977160	979160	Okay, you hear that?
980160	982160	Okay, if I hear that again,
982160	984160	I might have to BRB to separate them.
985160	989160	I'm trying to introduce some new babies to my adults,
989160	991160	and they're kind of not getting along.
993160	995160	Oh my fucking god.
997160	998160	Alright.
1003160	1004160	What's their names?
1004160	1006160	You'll see them soon.
1006160	1007160	In handcams.
1011160	1012160	Right, so,
1013160	1016160	I know that my whole shtick is like brocon cis con,
1016160	1020160	but unfortunately to disappoint you,
1020160	1022160	we can't do that on Patreon.
1023160	1025160	I don't even think we can do that on fanzly either.
1026160	1028160	We have to abide by their TOS.
1031160	1033160	Yeah, I know that might disappoint some of you,
1033160	1034160	and you might be like,
1034160	1036160	oh well why don't you go to this other platform
1036160	1038160	that does allow that stuff.
1039160	1043160	You know, the shirt that we could,
1043160	1048160	but also we're trying to stick to the bigger platforms
1048160	1051160	that a lot of people have access to
1051160	1053160	and a lot of people know about.
1055160	1058160	It's not very smart to go streaming
1058160	1061160	on smaller platforms,
1061160	1064160	because then you're just making your...
1068160	1070160	Oh god, I'm having a brain fart.
1072160	1074160	When we have the option for a bigger platform,
1074160	1076160	let's just try that first, right?
1076160	1078160	Big brain, right? Accessibility, yes, yes, yes.
1078160	1080160	Accessibility equals growth.
1080160	1082160	That's what I mean.
1083160	1085160	Yeah, you don't want to
1085160	1088160	shoot yourself in the foot right from the start, you know?
1088160	1090160	Let's just wait until we get banned first,
1090160	1091160	and then we can go to those platforms.
1091160	1094160	I'm just kidding, don't ban us, please.
1095160	1098160	Right, my IRL goals, I have real life goals,
1098160	1101160	because I'm actually, you know, not...
1101160	1104160	I'm only part-time anime girl on the internet.
1104160	1107160	My real life goals is...
1108160	1112160	I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning.
1113160	1115160	I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning
1115160	1119160	because it's summer right now, and...
1120160	1123160	If something is allowed on Fancy, but not on Patreon,
1123160	1125160	you can get banned from Patreon for doing it on Fancy.
1125160	1127160	Shit, yeah.
1127160	1131160	So, no Bokon, I guess, on Fancy.
1132160	1134160	Yeah, I don't have air conditioning.
1135160	1137160	A lot of apartments don't come with air conditioning,
1137160	1139160	so I want to move to one that does
1139160	1141160	because it's going to be summer soon,
1141160	1144160	and if I, you know,
1144160	1147160	if I am able to do that,
1147160	1150160	that helps me be able to stream longer,
1150160	1153160	and it helps me be able to make more content
1153160	1157160	because I will be comfortable during the summer,
1157160	1160160	because I have to keep my stream short for now
1160160	1165160	because I can't stream for long hours in the heat without AC.
1165160	1166160	So, yeah.
1166160	1168160	What did GB say?
1170160	1172160	Scroll up.
1172160	1173160	Pomf?
1173160	1175160	Yeah, some people said pomf.
1175160	1177160	Yeah, some people said pomf.
1177160	1179160	I don't know if we'll go there.
1180160	1181160	Right, yeah.
1181160	1184160	Next goal is I want to get a big girl microphone.
1184160	1188160	I feel like I'm using such a newbie microphone right now.
1188160	1190160	I'm using the HyperX,
1190160	1194160	and I don't know, I'm sure the quality is okay.
1197160	1201160	But I want to get like a really professional one, yeah.
1201160	1204160	Something expensive,
1204160	1206160	something I can waste my money on.
1206160	1207160	It sounds good.
1207160	1208160	Yeah, I'm sure the quality is good,
1208160	1210160	but I want something like,
1210160	1212160	I want a big girl mic
1212160	1214160	with lots of cords
1216160	1218160	to tie you up with.
1219160	1220160	Next, I want to,
1220160	1222160	I want to be able to get a dishwasher
1222160	1225160	and a washing machine
1225160	1227160	and a dryer for clothes.
1229160	1232160	I feel like these goals should be pretty realistic.
1232160	1234160	I feel like I should be able to get these things.
1234160	1237160	So, I'm so excited to tweet
1237160	1239160	a picture of my new washing machine
1239160	1241160	and to be like, guys!
1241160	1243160	I got a washing machine!
1244160	1246160	Wait, we're skipping number three?
1246160	1248160	Oh, be mentally stable, yeah, that too.
1248160	1250160	I want to do that too.
1252160	1255160	Wait, what's she be stick?
1255160	1258160	Do you live in a cardboard box?
1258160	1260160	No, I live in an apartment,
1260160	1263160	but it doesn't really have amenities
1263160	1265160	because it's not really an apartment.
1268160	1269160	Okay.
1270160	1271160	All right.
1271160	1274160	And the last one is not visible
1274160	1276160	because the chat is covering it.
1278160	1281160	I'll be able to afford your membership.
1282160	1284160	I used to be really, really athletic,
1284160	1287160	which is crazy to say because now I'm not.
1287160	1289160	But I want to go back to those days.
1289160	1293160	I mentioned before that I won a gymnastics award.
1293160	1297160	Yeah, I used to like do gymnastics.
1297160	1299160	I don't know if I'll ever go back,
1299160	1303160	but I want to do something athletic
1303160	1305160	because it was fun.
1305160	1307160	Yeah, fat-shaming and chat?
1307160	1308160	What?
1308160	1310160	Who's fat-shaming and chat?
1311160	1315160	The only one around here that's allowed to fat-shame is me.
1316160	1317160	I'm kidding.
1317160	1319160	I won't be fat-shaming anyone.
1320160	1321160	Right.
1322160	1323160	Next.
1324160	1326160	What does Imi like under the shats?
1327160	1328160	I don't know.
1328160	1329160	Okay.
1329160	1331160	Let me know if I'm being too rude too quickly.
1331160	1335160	I don't know how quickly we want to advance here, but...
1337160	1340160	Will there be some content on YouTube to a lesser extent?
1341160	1343160	I have to consult Strani for that.
1343160	1345160	I don't know what YouTube allows.
1346160	1349160	I would get bonked all the time on YouTube in the past.
1350160	1352160	I'm still getting bonked to this day on YouTube.
1352160	1354160	Guys, guys, I...
1354160	1357160	You know how YouTube is like removing ear-licking content
1357160	1360160	and deleting people's channels for ear-licking content?
1360160	1362160	But I still have ear-licking content up.
1366160	1368160	I mean, what YouTube execs?
1369160	1371160	No, I would never do ear-licking content.
1371160	1372160	I don't do that.
1373160	1374160	Wait, wait, wait.
1374160	1375160	So in the...
1379160	1380160	In the what?
1380160	1381160	In the trailer,
1381160	1382160	my voice line was like,
1382160	1385160	what, you've never seen a masochistic bracket before?
1385160	1388160	Which to me is kind of a silly trailer line,
1388160	1391160	but Strani sent it to me and I was like, whatever, I'll do it.
1394160	1397160	So yeah, here's all my masochistic tendencies.
1398160	1403160	I won't go too in-depth, but I'm also a sadist.
1403160	1407160	So anything you see here, like, fuck, it goes both ways, you know?
1408160	1410160	What's Painplay? Exactly what it sounds like.
1410160	1414160	If you don't know what Painplay is, then what are you doing here?
1415160	1418160	Weren't you guys just in Shibi's chat? Shouldn't you know?
1421160	1423160	Yeah, yandere?
1424160	1425160	Okay.
1425160	1428160	God, I really am covering everything, aren't I?
1430160	1432160	I'm sorry for coughing in your ear.
1432160	1433160	All right, so yandere, right.
1433160	1435160	Okay, I know it's Mercy's job.
1435160	1436160	I won't steal her job.
1436160	1440160	I won't be like, Senpai, you're gonna fucking...
1440160	1442160	You're gonna eat my ass tonight, right Senpai?
1442160	1443160	Huh?
1444160	1447160	I'll tie you down in my basement and force you to sit on you.
1447160	1448160	No.
1448160	1449160	I'm not gonna...
1449160	1450160	Why am I so tiny now?
1450160	1451160	I'm not gonna steal her thing, okay?
1451160	1452160	That's her thing.
1452160	1460160	But you wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me.
1460160	1469160	Okay, I'm not a Swiftie, but I've been obsessed with that sort of content since seventh grade.
1471160	1473160	You can't rip it out of me, okay?
1475160	1480160	I consume an unhealthy amount of that sort of content.
1480160	1485160	Someone was able to find all of the...
1485160	1489160	All of the hentai I had put on my coffee table from my debut.
1490160	1501160	Just from the really shitty Minecraft pixelated tiny little images I had put up.
1501160	1503160	They found every single one.
1503160	1508160	So if you wanna go into the debut comment section and read what I like,
1508160	1510160	go ahead, but I can't say here probably.
1513160	1515160	Yeah, yeah, I've been...
1515160	1516160	I think...
1516160	1517160	Oh fuck.
1520160	1522160	I can't say how long I've been obsessed with it.
1523160	1524160	I think I really did.
1524160	1525160	Oh, whatever.
1525160	1527160	I've been obsessed with it for way too long.
1527160	1531160	Longer than some of you Zoomers might be alive for.
1534160	1537160	Oh yeah, the red goo that comes out of your body.
1538160	1540160	Peeling skin.
1540160	1542160	Peeling skin is like really satisfying.
1542160	1544160	I'm not a fucking hag.
1544160	1546160	You'll be surprised I'm not a hag.
1546160	1549160	We do have hags though if you want them.
1549160	1551160	Yeah, peeling skin.
1551160	1555160	Okay, my favorite thing about peeling skin.
1555160	1559160	Not just on your lips, cause also on your lips and on my lips on...
1561160	1563160	On your lips, from my lips, whatever.
1563160	1565160	But also just in general like scabs.
1565160	1567160	I really like to pick sc...
1567160	1568160	Oh, I got a cough.
1576160	1577160	Okay.
1579160	1580160	Let me drink some water.
1583160	1584160	Right.
1584160	1585160	I really...
1585160	1591160	My favorite thing ever is when you're peeling a scab and it makes like a ripping sound.
1591160	1596160	I don't know if you've ever experienced that cause I'm sure none of you...
1596160	1599160	I'm sure not everyone here likes to pick scabs.
1599160	1603160	But I love it when you can hear the skin rip.
1603160	1604160	That's my favorite thing ever.
1604160	1607160	And also when you can feel the skin rip, but yeah.
1609160	1611160	Or talking like dead skin?
1611160	1614160	Well like, you know, when your lips are dry they start to peel.
1614160	1617160	How big of a scab are you picking? Any fucking size.
1617160	1619160	The bigger the better.
1621160	1622160	It's audible? It is.
1622160	1625160	If you get a big enough one.
1625160	1626160	I like popping pim...
1626160	1627160	Oh, there's a car outside.
1627160	1629160	I like popping pimples too.
1631160	1637160	That's satisfying too, but I feel like scabs are better cause they...
1637160	1638160	They goo.
1639160	1640160	They goo.
1640160	1641160	They goo red.
1642160	1643160	Spanking and chunking.
1646160	1647160	I am a switch.
1649160	1651160	I gotta move it for you.
1651160	1653160	Imi does not read much hentai.
1653160	1655160	I mostly read dirty books.
1655160	1659160	But if you have a recommendation, I've been trying to read...
1659160	1661160	Hold on, I gotta cough again.
1672160	1674160	I'm a Nintendo switch.
1674160	1679160	I've been trying to read at least one recommendation from...
1680160	1683160	Cause a lot of you have been sending full on lists of a bunch of them.
1683160	1686160	I can't read all of those.
1690160	1694160	But I try to read one at least from each one.
1694160	1696160	Any favorite tags?
1696160	1697160	The ones here!
1697160	1698160	These ones!
1701160	1703160	My neighbors are being really loud downstairs.
1703160	1704160	Genuine love and affection.
1704160	1706160	Yeah, I just want someone to love me.
1706160	1708160	That's my ultimate kink.
1710160	1713160	Non...
1713160	1715160	Complex.
1715160	1719160	Also, anything you're into...
1719160	1722160	If you presented the right way to me,
1722160	1725160	then I'll probably be into it too.
1725160	1726160	Yeah.
1728160	1730160	Next slide.
1730160	1733160	What does Imi not like under the shats?
1734160	1736160	Right, right.
1737160	1739160	Who loves the most degenerative kinks?
1739160	1740160	I know.
1740160	1742160	I know that's asking a lot.
1745160	1748160	I know, I'm really freaky when it comes to that.
1751160	1756160	Okay, so all of the below stuff I am fine with when it comes to fan art.
1756160	1759160	This only pertains to elude marshmallows
1759160	1762160	or just how we interact with each other in general.
1764160	1765160	Right.
1767160	1769160	I bet you like hand holding.
1769160	1771160	Don't you, you little freak?
1773160	1775160	I hope you can't hear the dog barking.
1775160	1777160	Let's not my dog either.
1777160	1779160	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
1781160	1782160	Great.
1782160	1784160	Death or necrophilia.
1784160	1786160	I may have threatened to have...
1788160	1792160	gex with your dead body in a past audio.
1792160	1795160	But I'm not actually into it and please do not do...
1796160	1800160	I mean, do not send any weird necrophilia stuff to me.
1800160	1802160	I know, I know we're freaky here,
1802160	1804160	but let's not go that far, okay?
1806160	1808160	Let's not go that far.
1810160	1812160	Right, I'm all about love.
1815160	1820160	So I'm uncomfortable with any sort of pain play stuff if it's not loving.
1820160	1823160	Because, you know, I'm just freaky like that.
1823160	1825160	It's got to be loving.
1826160	1828160	Do not fuck the dead body.
1831160	1832160	Actually, right, right, right.
1832160	1834160	Okay, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.
1834160	1836160	I really like cutesy stuff.
1836160	1838160	Or like...
1839160	1841160	Or like...
1842160	1844160	You mean freak?
1846160	1848160	You guys are so funny.
1848160	1851160	Okay, I'm like, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.
1851160	1854160	Or like, I didn't know that touching a peepee makes it...
1856160	1858160	But I don't go Google Gaga.
1858160	1860160	I don't go into that territory, so...
1860160	1861160	Go to AC.
1861160	1863160	Yeah, if you're into that, she will...
1863160	1865160	She will satisfy you.
1866160	1869160	And the same thing with the OG-san?
1871160	1872160	The same thing with the OG-san?
1872160	1875160	If you don't know, OG-san means like uncle, I guess?
1875160	1877160	Or maybe like old man?
1878160	1880160	I'm not really into that either.
1880160	1882160	So also, yeah, old dudes.
1883160	1885160	So you can also...
1886160	1888160	Go to AC for that too.
1888160	1890160	Because that's her shtick, you know?
1890160	1892160	Fat older uncle.
1892160	1894160	Yeah, that's not for me.
1895160	1897160	Oh, what's the last one?
1900160	1902160	Alright, the last one is...
1903160	1905160	Extreme body play stuff, yeah.
1905160	1908160	Don't fill my tits up with saline solution
1908160	1910160	and then jump on them to make them pop, okay?
1910160	1911160	Okay.
1911160	1913160	And then I won't fill your balls up with saline solution
1913160	1915160	and then jump on them to make them pop.
1915160	1917160	It's a mutual agreement there, okay?
1917160	1918160	Okay.
1919160	1921160	You need to rest?
1921160	1923160	It's okay, it's okay.
1923160	1925160	I'm usually not really sick.
1925160	1927160	I don't know...
1927160	1929160	I don't know who I am today.
1929160	1930160	But I'm okay.
1930160	1932160	It's really just my throat.
1932160	1936160	And like my coughing's been acting up.
1936160	1939160	Oh no, chat fucking broke on me!
1939160	1941160	Shit!
1941160	1943160	Oh no, how am I supposed to look at chat?
1945160	1946160	How am I supposed to read chat?
1946160	1949160	Okay, let me open my own stream.
1954160	1957160	Because my chat froze!
1957160	1959160	Are you kidding me?
1964160	1965160	Alright.
1966160	1969160	I will read chat from a tiny window from YouTube.
1969160	1970160	Okay?
1970160	1971160	Okay.
1973160	1975160	What's next?
1975160	1978160	Let me adjust it because now I have to change my windows around
1978160	1980160	because my freaking chat froze.
1980160	1981160	Alright.
1987160	1989160	I will not pop your balls for you.
1989160	1990160	No, I'm sorry.
1990160	1992160	Maybe she will.
1992160	1994160	If you're into that, I don't know.
1996160	1999160	Here, let me even just close chat.
1999160	2002160	Or maybe if I close and then open it again.
2003160	2004160	It works!
2004160	2005160	Oh, okay, okay.
2005160	2008160	I don't have to have the whole YouTube tab open.
2008160	2009160	Alright.
2010160	2012160	Pop them like boba?
2013160	2015160	Chew on them like boba balls?
2017160	2018160	Yeah, next.
2018160	2019160	Alright, music stuff.
2019160	2024160	I didn't mention my music taste in my debut, so I can mention it now.
2024160	2027160	So, I wrote this when I was like...
2028160	2031160	It was like 2am last night when I made this slide, so...
2032160	2035160	I don't know why I said I don't have favorite genres.
2035160	2037160	I do have favorite genres.
2042160	2047160	I like Korean pop and Japanese pop and like...
2050160	2051160	Vocaloids.
2051160	2052160	I like vocal aids, too.
2055160	2056160	Yeah.
2058160	2061160	I'm not into making music or anything.
2064160	2069160	I don't have a goal of producing an original song or anything.
2069160	2071160	I mean, if it comes to that...
2072160	2076160	Sure, I don't know if I can do it, but it's not a goal of mine.
2077160	2081160	I'm not really passionate about making music or any of that.
2081160	2086160	But yeah, I put my current favorite songs here so you can listen to them if you want.
2086160	2088160	I'm kind of a normie and I apologize if you don't like it.
2088160	2092160	It's not like I'm going to be bothering you with my song choices.
2095160	2098160	You gifted some fun stuff on Throne. I can't wait to hear it be used.
2099160	2100160	Dirty.
2100160	2101160	Shame him.
2101160	2102160	Oh my god.
2103160	2104160	What a pervert.
2105160	2108160	Not on this Christian website, youtube.com.
2109160	2110160	Mods.
2110160	2112160	Hang him by his balls and twist him around.
2114160	2118160	Yeah, I like Takayan. I like Metsuki. I like Romani Martinez.
2118160	2121160	I recently found out about What's-A-Heart.
2121160	2122160	I don't know how popular they are.
2125160	2129160	Yeah, and fuck, now I have to actually show it.
2132160	2133160	And then there's the last one.
2134160	2135160	Don't even worry about that.
2136160	2137160	Or I like some dislikes.
2138160	2141160	I didn't mention this in my debut either, so let's talk about it here.
2142160	2144160	I like rats, obviously.
2144160	2145160	I like rats.
2147160	2148160	Yeah.
2150160	2152160	I like pink and cute things.
2152160	2154160	My whole room is pink.
2155160	2158160	And my whole room is covered in cute things.
2159160	2161160	Yeah, I like cute stuffed animals.
2161160	2164160	I like cute clothes, like Hawaii fashion.
2164160	2167160	I think I season to that too, like Hawaii fashion.
2167160	2169160	She sent pictures of her outfits and I was like,
2170160	2172160	She's like my twin, she's so cute.
2175160	2177160	I'm sorry if there's any Koreans in chat.
2181160	2182160	I don't think I'm pronouncing it right.
2182160	2184160	But it's basically just...
2186160	2187160	It's like race cakes.
2188160	2189160	And I like it with...
2189160	2194160	I like it with like cheesy sauce and stuff and like spicy...
2195160	2196160	I like it when it's spicy.
2200160	2202160	I don't know the brand I've been eating.
2203160	2207160	Let me try to look up the brand because I've been eating this one brand.
2209160	2211160	I've been eating this one brand like over and over again.
2211160	2212160	It's like the only...
2212160	2213160	Oh, fuck wrong tab.
2214160	2216160	It's like the only thing I've been eating lately.
2220160	2222160	I think it was spicy chicken.
2228160	2229160	Wait, what brand is that?
2229160	2230160	Bulldog, bulldog.
2231160	2233160	That one, the pink one.
2233160	2234160	It's really good.
2234160	2235160	That's right.
2236160	2238160	Korean perfect pronunciation?
2238160	2239160	I feel like that's a lie.
2241160	2243160	Do you want to pick on each hand scabs?
2244160	2245160	Yes?
2246160	2248160	Scab picking stream?
2248160	2250160	No, I don't think that's allowed.
2252160	2253160	Yeah, bulldog.
2253160	2254160	I like those.
2254160	2256160	I think a...
2259160	2261160	Mukbang stream would be fun.
2261160	2263160	It's going to have a lot of...
2263160	2264160	Maybe it could be an ASMR stream.
2264160	2266160	It's going to have a lot of wet noises.
2267160	2269160	Eating on each hand scabs.
2271160	2272160	I don't...
2272160	2273160	Okay, I don't like to eat this.
2273160	2274160	Let it be known here.
2275160	2277160	I don't like to eat the scab skin.
2278160	2280160	I only like to eat the lip skin, okay?
2281160	2283160	I feel like scab skin is kind of gross.
2284160	2286160	I only like the lip skin, okay?
2286160	2287160	Okay.
2292160	2293160	Not auto cannibalism.
2293160	2295160	Well, I guess a little bit of auto cannibalism,
2295160	2296160	but also other people cannibalism.
2296160	2297160	Regular cannibalism.
2299160	2301160	Dislikes, dislikes, right?
2301160	2303160	I don't like to interact with real humans.
2305160	2307160	When I had like a real person job,
2307160	2310160	and not an anime girl on the internet job,
2310160	2312160	it was so awful.
2312160	2314160	People are so mean.
2315160	2317160	I don't like to talk to them.
2319160	2322160	So now I just spend a lot of time not doing that.
2326160	2327160	Okay.
2329160	2331160	She is into that shit.
2331160	2332160	Well, you know what?
2332160	2334160	If people are into scab eating,
2334160	2335160	I'm not gonna king shame them,
2335160	2336160	but I'm just not into it.
2336160	2337160	Do you like to pop zits?
2337160	2338160	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
2338160	2341160	Let me sit on your back and pop all your back knee.
2342160	2344160	That's quality time for me.
2346160	2347160	Okay.
2349160	2351160	I don't like people who can sing good
2351160	2353160	because I'm jealous of them.
2354160	2355160	I don't like heat.
2355160	2359160	I don't like being hot or moisture.
2360160	2362160	I do like to watch Dr. Pimple Popper.
2362160	2363160	Yes.
2367160	2370160	I don't like bugs trying to crawl in my ear.
2370160	2373160	And I have this really specific fear
2373160	2376160	of bugs crawling in my ear because one time
2376160	2379160	when I was sleeping, I was really young.
2379160	2382160	And why is my model?
2382160	2384160	I was really young and I was just sleeping.
2384160	2386160	And all of a sudden I felt like
2386160	2388160	something go inside my ear.
2388160	2390160	Like I felt a buzzing near my ear
2390160	2393160	and then I literally felt penetration in my ear.
2393160	2395160	Like something like crawled into my ear
2395160	2397160	and I woke up as fast as I could
2397160	2399160	and I like, you know, put my fingers up to my ear
2399160	2401160	to see like what the fuck is going on in there.
2401160	2403160	And I couldn't get anything.
2403160	2405160	Like there was, it felt like nothing was there.
2405160	2407160	So I don't, I don't know if I just have
2407160	2410160	like a dead bug in my ear since, since I was a child.
2410160	2412160	But now I'm just really, really scared of bugs
2412160	2414160	crawling into my ear because I don't know if,
2414160	2416160	I don't know if that was a dream.
2416160	2418160	I don't know if it's real,
2418160	2420160	but it felt really real and I hated it.
2422160	2423160	So yeah.
2424160	2426160	Next is people who are smart
2426160	2428160	because I'm jealous because I'm stupid.
2430160	2431160	Sleep with earplugs.
2431160	2433160	That's smart, but also I feel like
2433160	2435160	the earplugs are going to get dirty really quickly
2435160	2438160	and I'm too lazy to clean those.
2439160	2442160	Me being piloted by a bug like Ratatouille.
2443160	2445160	That fly that flew into my ear
2445160	2447160	has just been controlling my brain.
2450160	2451160	Okay.
2451160	2453160	And then finally,
2453160	2455160	other streamers you watch because I'm jealous.
2455160	2458160	Don't bring them up in my chat because I will cry.
2460160	2461160	Hold on, what's the next?
2461160	2463160	I'm kind of worried about what the next.
2463160	2464160	Oh shit, okay.
2465160	2468160	The next one is also, the next slide
2468160	2469160	is also common knowledge,
2469160	2471160	but I'm going to say it again
2471160	2474160	because I know a lot of people, you know,
2474160	2475160	we just met each other.
2476160	2478160	A lot of people, you know, don't know me.
2478160	2483160	So I'm going to give you an important note here.
2483160	2484160	Right?
2484160	2485160	Okay, here we go.
2486160	2487160	So,
2488160	2491160	I want to bring up right now to warn people
2491160	2494160	who want me to stay in the little sister character
2494160	2495160	at all times.
2497160	2498160	I can't.
2499160	2500160	Uh oh.
2500160	2501160	And he thinks her voice,
2501160	2503160	she's a fucking broadcastle that bitch.
2503160	2504160	She's a little liar.
2504160	2505160	Okay, yeah.
2505160	2506160	So it's true.
2506160	2508160	I am the only one in viewer who fix her voice.
2508160	2511160	All the other girls do use their natural voice on stream.
2511160	2514160	Even if you think like, oh, she's trying so hard.
2514160	2516160	She's trying so hard to sound mommy
2516160	2517160	or she's trying to,
2517160	2520160	she's trying to so hard to sound lolly.
2520160	2521160	They're not.
2522160	2524160	I've been in voice calls with these girls.
2524160	2527160	They all genuinely sound like that.
2527160	2529160	They all genuinely sound that sexy and hot
2529160	2532160	and cute and pretty naturally, right?
2532160	2533160	Except for me.
2534160	2536160	Except for me.
2536160	2537160	Okay, yeah.
2537160	2540160	So I don't know how others do lolly voice 24-7.
2540160	2542160	Maybe they're born with it.
2542160	2543160	Like I see.
2543160	2544160	Or,
2545160	2546160	yeah.
2546160	2548160	But your little sister's a fake bitch.
2548160	2550160	So when she's sick
2550160	2553160	or maybe during longer streams like Donathons,
2553160	2557160	big sister in me will come out to play and torment you.
2558160	2559160	So yeah.
2560160	2562160	Let me move it.
2562160	2563160	Okay, there we go.
2563160	2565160	And there's my little drawing.
2565160	2567160	I'm sorry if that disappoints anyone,
2567160	2569160	but I hope you can still like me anyways
2569160	2573160	and I hope you can put up with dummy sister in me.
2575160	2577160	You get a full package with me.
2577160	2580160	You get little sister and older sister.
2582160	2583160	Okay, that's it.
2583160	2585160	Yup, yup, yup, yup.
2585160	2587160	Okay, so I can go through.
2587160	2590160	Only, and it's only been 43 minutes.
2590160	2593160	So I can go through safer work marshmallow questions.
2595160	2597160	Or we can do chat questions.
2597160	2599160	So, oh, I got a burp.
2603160	2604160	Don't hold back.
2604160	2606160	Yeah, ask me your most,
2606160	2609160	your moist burning questions.
2610160	2612160	Don't worry about whether or not
2612160	2614160	management would want me to talk about it.
2614160	2616160	Just ask it to me.
2616160	2617160	Yeah, they're not here.
2617160	2618160	It's just us.
2618160	2619160	It's just me and you, poopy.
2619160	2621160	Or we can just talk about like your own interests.
2621160	2622160	I don't know.
2622160	2624160	We can get to know each other if you want.
2624160	2626160	So I think first what I'll do
2626160	2629160	is go back to the chatting screen.
2631160	2635160	And nine out of 10, thank you.
2636160	2638160	And I want to open marshmallow.
2639160	2641160	And any questions you have,
2641160	2643160	I will look through those first
2643160	2645160	and then I will go through chat questions.
2645160	2646160	Okay.
2647160	2648160	What color is your panties?
2649160	2650160	Okay, I'll answer that one
2650160	2651160	because it's mercy.
2651160	2652160	They're light blue.
2655160	2656160	Okay.
2658160	2660160	Let me open marshmallow.
2660160	2662160	I think I should be able to show it
2662160	2663160	if I'm careful.
2664160	2665160	If I'm careful.
2668160	2669160	Okay.
2670160	2672160	I'm going to refresh it.
2672160	2673160	Okay.
2676160	2677160	It's good to have you back, lad.
2677160	2679160	Good luck on your future clothes and stuff.
2679160	2680160	This is what you've been up to the whole time.
2680160	2681160	Yup.
2686160	2688160	Any book recommendations?
2688160	2691160	Can I show the...
2692160	2695160	Let me try to show the marshmallow question.
2695160	2696160	So that way...
2700160	2701160	Oh!
2703160	2704160	Oh!
2704160	2706160	Well, there's my OBS.
2708160	2709160	There's...
2709160	2710160	Docs myself.
2710160	2711160	I hope not. Okay.
2721160	2723160	Here's a marshmallow question.
2725160	2726160	Okay, I'll put it right on chat.
2726160	2729160	Any recommendations for books instead of dojins?
2729160	2730160	Right.
2731160	2733160	All of the books I've read will get me canceled
2733160	2734160	if I say them,
2734160	2738160	but I guess I'm probably going to get canceled anyways.
2738160	2740160	So...
2740160	2741160	The problem is...
2741160	2742160	She uses...
2742160	2744160	Guys, she uses OBS.
2746160	2748160	Fight your IP address right now.
2748160	2750160	Go to her house.
2752160	2754160	So, like, all of the books I've read
2754160	2756160	have been mostly, like,
2756160	2758160	female, like,
2758160	2759160	orientated...
2759160	2760160	Oriented?
2760160	2762160	So if I tell you, like,
2762160	2765160	you might not enjoy it because you're a dude.
2765160	2767160	But I will tell you my all-time favorite.
2769160	2770160	But let me look it up first
2770160	2772160	because I forgot the name.
2778160	2780160	It is really problematic.
2781160	2782160	But, you know,
2782160	2784160	we're here today, so whatever.
2784160	2788160	It's Take Me With You by Nina G. Jones.
2789160	2791160	That one...
2792160	2794160	Okay, I might be really bad.
2794160	2796160	I haven't read it in a long time,
2796160	2797160	but it was the first...
2797160	2798160	It was the one I read that I was like,
2798160	2800160	ah, that's good.
2800160	2801160	So, I don't know.
2802160	2804160	Okay, next question.
2805160	2807160	Have you seen One Piece or Dragon Ball?
2807160	2809160	I started Dragon Ball,
2810160	2812160	but I didn't really care about it.
2812160	2813160	So yeah.
2815160	2817160	Considering the pin
2817160	2819160	and button aesthetics on your designs,
2819160	2820160	are you a fan of Coraline?
2820160	2823160	Okay, we didn't design our characters at all.
2823160	2825160	I also didn't apply to be in me,
2825160	2826160	so I didn't design anything,
2826160	2827160	but I do like Coraline.
2827160	2829160	It's a really good movie.
2829160	2830160	I really, really like it.
2830160	2832160	I watched it a lot on repeat.
2832160	2834160	When I was a kid, it really scared me.
2834160	2836160	I'm sure it scared a lot of kids,
2836160	2838160	but yeah, I like Coraline.
2845160	2847160	I saw you played League,
2847160	2849160	and I started wondering what rank is.
2849160	2850160	What your rank is.
2850160	2854160	Okay, I had League on my...
2857160	2860160	I had League on my like,
2861160	2865160	Steam library during debut.
2865160	2867160	I don't play League.
2867160	2870160	I've played League like maybe a total of five times.
2870160	2872160	I don't even know if I have a rank.
2872160	2874160	That's how much I don't know anything about League.
2876160	2880160	I've only really learned how to play Yumi,
2881160	2883160	and I don't know any of the other characters,
2883160	2885160	and I don't know how to play any of the other characters.
2885160	2887160	Like, I'm not really a League player.
2887160	2888160	I don't...
2888160	2891160	I'm sorry to maybe disappoint you,
2891160	2894160	or also to make you happy,
2894160	2896160	because a lot of people don't like League.
2896160	2897160	I don't know.
2897160	2900160	But I thought it would be a funny game to like,
2900160	2902160	have chat teach me how to play,
2902160	2904160	but you know, if you guys don't like it,
2904160	2905160	we don't have to play.
2905160	2906160	It's not that deep, you know?
2906160	2907160	Oh no, Yumi.
2907160	2910160	Guys, like I said, I haven't played League at all.
2910160	2912160	Like, don't start freaking out.
2912160	2914160	Don't start freaking out. It's okay.
2917160	2920160	If you guys get a fans League account, will it be free?
2920160	2922160	I think Strani already mentioned that, but yeah.
2922160	2923160	Yeah.
2923160	2925160	I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.
2925160	2926160	Um...
2927160	2929160	So if you have, like, fans League questions,
2929160	2930160	please direct them to Strani,
2930160	2932160	because I've never used fans League before,
2932160	2933160	so I don't know.
2938160	2939160	Will you groom us?
2939160	2940160	Yes.
2942160	2943160	Um...
2943160	2944160	Ooh.
2944160	2946160	Well, this isn't interesting.
2946160	2948160	I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.
2948160	2950160	I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.
2951160	2952160	Well, this is an interesting question.
2952160	2954160	I barely even read it before showing it to you.
2954160	2956160	Do you feel like there are equal parts of you
2956160	2958160	in Yumi as Liberty?
2959160	2961160	Are there things you're excited to do as Yumi
2961160	2962160	that you couldn't do before?
2962160	2965160	I could do anything I wanted as Liberty before.
2965160	2968160	I just chose not to, you know?
2970160	2971160	Um...
2971160	2973160	Equal parts of you in Yumi...
2974160	2975160	Equal parts of me.
2976160	2978160	I don't know what that means.
2980160	2981160	Um...
2986160	2987160	I...
2990160	2993160	How do we congregate together outside of streams?
2993160	2994160	Right.
2994160	2996160	There's a fan Discord,
2996160	2998160	but I'm not in it, so we can't.
2998160	2999160	Um...
3000160	3004160	Once I announce that my PL is PL,
3004160	3007160	you're free to go in my old Discord server.
3007160	3009160	I'm also not in that one.
3009160	3012160	So you cannot congregate with me outside of streams
3012160	3014160	other than, like, pre-chat.
3015160	3018160	But you can congregate with other fans outside of streams.
3018160	3020160	There's a fan Discord out there on Twitter.
3020160	3022160	I think you can search for
3022160	3025160	Feeler Community Server or something.
3026160	3028160	But we will not have our own...
3028160	3030160	Is the chat behind Frozen?
3030160	3031160	I don't know.
3031160	3034160	We will not have our own, like, Discord server
3034160	3036160	with us in it, you know?
3039160	3040160	Yeah.
3040160	3042160	Also, this question, I'm not quite sure
3042160	3044160	what you mean by that,
3044160	3047160	so I don't know if I can answer it.
3047160	3050160	I do feel like the character's cute.
3050160	3052160	I like her.
3052160	3054160	Um, did I expect to get her?
3054160	3055160	No, not at all.
3055160	3056160	But yeah, I like her.
3056160	3057160	I think she's cute.
3057160	3058160	I'm cute.
3059160	3062160	Do you feel like Yumi is just as big
3062160	3064160	of a part of her as Liberty?
3064160	3066160	Yes, of course. Of course. Of course.
3070160	3075160	Oh, have you picked up any recent shows?
3075160	3080160	I am just about finished watching
3080160	3082160	to your eternity.
3082160	3084160	It was really, really good.
3084160	3086160	It was so cute and sad.
3086160	3088160	I literally cried, like, every five episodes.
3088160	3090160	I still have to finish watching,
3090160	3093160	like, maybe the last two episodes or something.
3094160	3097160	Um, but, yeah.
3097160	3098160	Yeah.
3098160	3099160	It was really good.
3099160	3100160	I really recommend that anime.
3100160	3101160	It's so sad.
3101160	3102160	It made me cry so much.
3102160	3104160	Even thinking about it now, I'm crying.
3105160	3107160	I'm literally tearing up thinking about it.
3107160	3108160	Oh, my God.
3109160	3111160	Fuck that anime.
3111160	3113160	Okay, okay, okay.
3122160	3125160	Okay, this is an interesting question.
3127160	3129160	I'm literally wiping away my fucking tears
3129160	3130160	because it made me cry.
3130160	3131160	Thinking about the anime.
3133160	3134160	Have you watched Steins' Gate?
3134160	3135160	No.
3138160	3139160	In your lore video,
3139160	3142160	was that an alternate from Mandela catalog?
3142160	3145160	Do you also like other analogue horror
3145160	3146160	or horror in general?
3146160	3147160	Wait, okay.
3147160	3148160	We did not come up with our lore.
3148160	3150160	We had no part.
3151160	3152160	Oh, my God.
3152160	3153160	My neighbors are yelling downstairs.
3153160	3154160	I'm sorry.
3154160	3156160	We had no part in any of the lore, right?
3158160	3159160	So, no.
3160160	3162160	I don't know anything about that.
3163160	3164160	Apologies.
3164160	3165160	I do horror stuff, though.
3167160	3169160	Can we get a taste of your real voice?
3169160	3170160	Oh, my God.
3171160	3173160	You can go look that up yourself.
3173160	3175160	That's so easy to find.
3176160	3177160	That's really easy to find.
3178160	3180160	You can find my vods very, very easily.
3180160	3182160	I'm trying to go back to the old questions.
3185160	3187160	Oh, I think this is an important question.
3188160	3190160	Our future schedule is going to be around the same hour,
3190160	3192160	or are you planning to shift to earlier or later?
3193160	3196160	For now, I think I will keep it at this time.
3196160	3197160	I have to cough.
3210160	3211160	Okay.
3212160	3214160	For now it will stay here.
3216160	3220160	I really want to do gorilla streams earlier in the day.
3220160	3222160	I think that would be fun.
3224160	3226160	But regularly...
3227160	3228160	Earlier in the day.
3228160	3229160	Hours before this one.
3230160	3231160	For the future.
3232160	3233160	For the future.
3234160	3235160	For the future.
3235160	3239220	Like, hours before this one
3239220	3243980	For any European viewers
3243980	3249820	For now, regularly scheduled streams will be at this time

3418840	3430840	And then I have two other rats that are adults that I've had for a while, and I did get to name those ones, and their names are Dennis, The Menace, and Esteban.
3432840	3434840	You can tell there's a really big difference between the names.
3444840	3446840	Do you read any visual novels?
3449840	3452840	Hmmmmm...
3459840	3461840	Is... oh, there's one I'm thinking of right now.
3464840	3466840	I forgot the name.
3466840	3469840	I read a little bit. I read a little bit, but...
3470840	3477840	I mostly read, like, manga where I started the anime, and then they stopped, like,
3477840	3481840	you know, they took a break from making it for, you know, like, the next season and stuff.
3481840	3483840	Like, I've read most of the New Freerun chapters.
3483840	3487840	Like, I read manga more than I read visual novels, I feel like.
3487840	3488840	So, yeah.
3489840	3490840	Yeah.
3492840	3494840	Oh, oh, I'm gonna disappoint you guys with this question.
3494840	3497840	Have you watched Toradora Feelings on Romance Anime?
3497840	3500840	I have not watched Toradora. I know. Disappointment. Oh my god.
3501840	3504840	Esteban is a weird name for a female rat.
3504840	3506840	I got it from... I got it from The Office.
3508840	3513840	Um, I have not watched Toradora and Feelings on Romance Anime.
3513840	3515840	This is probably why I haven't watched Toradora.
3515840	3518840	I don't like romance anime.
3519840	3523840	Like, as much as I love, like, yeah, didn't stuff.
3523840	3528840	As kinky as I am for liking love, I don't actually like romance anime.
3528840	3534840	So, I tend to stay away from a lot of romance anime.
3534840	3535840	Yeah.
3535840	3537840	I have not watched Violet...
3537840	3540840	I tried watching Violet Evergarden, but I got bored.
3541840	3544840	I'm super, super picky when it comes to anime. I apologize.
3548840	3550840	This question is so fucking funny.
3552840	3556840	Every trade, sweet, cuckoo, date a cuckoo.
3559840	3562840	Have you ever dated a cuckoo?
3565840	3567840	I guess we know who the cuck is.
3568840	3570840	Point and laugh at the cuck.
3570840	3571840	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3571840	3573840	Actually, no, if you're a cuckoo, you should enjoy it.
3573840	3575840	You should enjoy the humiliation.
3577840	3578840	Right, um...
3582840	3583840	I'm sorry?
3584840	3585840	No.
3585840	3586840	Um...
3587840	3588840	No.
3588840	3589840	But...
3589840	3591840	Thoughts on the Polly thing?
3591840	3593840	I've said before, I want two boyfriends.
3593840	3596840	I want to dress them up like Barbie dolls, like twin Barbie dolls,
3596840	3598840	and I want to make them kiss.
3598840	3599840	And I want to watch them...
3599840	3601840	I want to watch them kissing.
3603840	3607840	That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.
3610840	3613840	That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.
3613840	3615840	That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.
3622840	3623840	There's so many questions.
3623840	3624840	Okay, okay, okay.
3639840	3641840	I feel like I've already answered that one.
3644840	3647840	How do you want your fan groups to interact?
3647840	3648840	Interact.
3648840	3649840	Talk to each other.
3649840	3650840	I don't know.
3650840	3652840	But I understand if they don't want to,
3652840	3654840	because I know the content is different.
3654840	3658840	I'm not going to be disappointed if everyone from the past is like,
3658840	3660840	fuck this, I'm not coming.
3660840	3661840	I understand, I understand.
3661840	3663840	If you don't want to be here, because the content is different,
3663840	3665840	I understand and that's okay.
3665840	3667840	So it's really...
3667840	3669840	I like you guys to get along,
3669840	3671840	but also if you don't, that's okay.
3674840	3676840	Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
3677840	3678840	Oh my god.
3679840	3681840	How many rats total have you raised in your life?
3681840	3683840	God, these questions are so boring.
3683840	3686840	I'm so sorry to anyone who thought I would be entertaining today.
3687840	3689840	Not because your questions are boring,
3689840	3690840	but like my answers are boring.
3690840	3691840	Okay, okay.
3692840	3694840	I raised... raised.
3694840	3696840	I don't think I raised, but I've had...
3696840	3697840	Six.
3697840	3698840	Six?
3698840	3699840	Seven.
3699840	3701840	Six or seven.
3701840	3702840	Hold on.
3702840	3704840	Let me count them.
3704840	3706840	So my first two were...
3707840	3709840	My first two were Pikachu and Mudkip.
3711840	3713840	And then after that...
3714840	3716840	After that, I also...
3716840	3718840	After Pikachu died,
3718840	3720840	you're going to hear a lot about rat deaths.
3720840	3721840	They die really fast.
3721840	3723840	So after Pikachu died, I got three more.
3723840	3727840	I got crackers, I got Esteban, and I got Dennis.
3727840	3729840	My neighbors are having sex downstairs,
3729840	3731840	and I can hear it very clearly right now.
3735840	3738840	I can hear them moaning and also the bed creaking,
3738840	3741840	and it's making me a little bit uncomfortable.
3748840	3750840	Is the marble my neighbors have sex downstairs?
3751840	3752840	Um, yeah, right.
3752840	3753840	Pikachu?
3753840	3755840	Pikachu and Mudkip.
3756840	3757840	Crackers.
3757840	3758840	Dennis.
3758840	3759840	Esteban.
3759840	3760840	Pixie Luna.
3761840	3762840	That makes seven.
3762840	3763840	Yeah, that makes seven.
3766840	3767840	Clap for him.
3768840	3769840	Cheer them on.
3770840	3772840	I do have thin floors and thin walls.
3772840	3774840	Yeah, that's why I want to move.
3776840	3778840	Tribute raiding stream?
3778840	3779840	What?
3780840	3782840	Tribute raiding stream?
3782840	3783840	What?
3783840	3784840	Never, bros.
3784840	3785840	No.
3789840	3792840	Is it illegal or otherwise not liked to talk about
3792840	3794840	or ask about previous online identities
3794840	3796840	with you or the other viewer, bros?
3796840	3797840	So me, I'm comfortable with it,
3797840	3799840	but also don't bring it up too much,
3799840	3800840	because we're here now today.
3800840	3801840	Let's be in the present, you know?
3801840	3802840	Let's be...
3802840	3803840	I should probably show that question.
3803840	3805840	Let's be in the present together, you know?
3806840	3810840	But obviously, it's the other viewer girls' choices.
3810840	3812840	I'm not going to talk about it,
3813840	3814840	like for them,
3814840	3815840	like in terms of them,
3815840	3817840	like I'm not going to tell you,
3817840	3818840	but if they want to talk about it,
3818840	3820840	you know, is their choice.
3820840	3822840	I'm just happy that viewer let us talk about it,
3824840	3830840	because I miss the people that supported me from the start.
3830840	3831840	I really appreciate them,
3831840	3833840	but I also appreciate any new people
3833840	3837840	that are also coming in and saying hi
3837840	3839840	and giving me a chance.
3844840	3846840	Okay, now I'm getting to the inappropriate ones.
3846840	3848840	Let me scroll back up.
3849840	3851840	Okay, are you sure I'm not showing those?
3855840	3857840	Oh my god, they're being so fucking loud right now.
3859840	3860840	Holy shit.
3863840	3864840	Here, let me...
3864840	3865840	I should probably...
3874840	3876840	You talked about being self-conscious about your real voice.
3876840	3877840	I went and checked,
3877840	3879840	and it could still be a little sister.
3879840	3880840	Lies.
3880840	3881840	You're gassing me up.
3881840	3883840	You're sucking my cock so hard right now.
3886840	3889840	Okay, I guess I'll get into the actual spicy question.
3889840	3890840	Not spicy, but like...
3894840	3895840	Okay, where are they?
3897840	3899840	Oh, what do you plan to do on Fancy?
3907840	3909840	Okay, well, I do want to play like,
3909840	3912840	you know, the dating sims.
3913840	3915840	I think those would be fun.
3918840	3920840	Yeah, look at my throne.
3921840	3923840	Yeah, look at my throne if you want to know
3923840	3925840	what I plan to do on Fancy.
3928840	3929840	Mom, louder!
3929840	3931840	Is there your dominance?
3934840	3936840	You guys are so funny.
3945840	3947840	I guess I should probably talk about this too.
3947840	3949840	Okay, since you weren't able to choose your character,
3949840	3953840	how do you feel about lolly characters and lolly culture in general?
3953840	3956840	So, I have drawn...
3956840	3959840	Like, I've been drawing...
3959840	3962840	I guess I didn't really know at the time.
3962840	3964840	When I first started drawing,
3964840	3967840	I was like, only drawing lollies.
3967840	3969840	And also furries.
3970840	3972840	I was drawing lollies with furries.
3974840	3977840	And I didn't really care.
3977840	3978840	Like, I wasn't like,
3978840	3980840	oh yeah, shit's hot.
3980840	3983840	But I also wasn't like totally against it.
3985840	3989840	There were times where I found some stuff to be a little questionable.
3989840	3993840	But I know what I'm comfortable with personally.
3993840	3995840	And I will...
3995840	3998840	I wouldn't be here if in the present moment,
3998840	4000840	you know, I wasn't comfortable with it.
4000840	4001840	And I'm obviously not going to do anything,
4001840	4003840	but I'm not comfortable with it.
4003840	4005840	Um...
4006840	4009840	Yeah, in terms of like...
4009840	4013840	Like, I am not immersed in the culture.
4013840	4014840	There's a culture.
4014840	4015840	I'm very new to this.
4015840	4016840	I'm very, very new to this.
4016840	4018840	Like, other than drawing them,
4018840	4019840	I don't...
4019840	4020840	I haven't...
4020840	4022840	I'm not in the culture.
4022840	4026840	So, I hope you can accept me as...
4026840	4028840	I don't fucking know part of the family.
4028840	4029840	Brother?
4031840	4032840	I don't know.
4032840	4036840	Yeah, hopefully no one's disappointed that I'm like new to this or anything.
4036840	4037840	I don't know.
4037840	4039840	We're being real right now.
4041840	4044840	Yeah, no one's asking any like crazy questions.
4044840	4046840	I thought you were going to ask me like...
4046840	4048840	I don't fucking know like...
4049840	4051840	How far can you squirt or something?
4056840	4058840	Okay, I can go to chat questions now, I guess,
4058840	4060840	for anyone that doesn't have marshmallow,
4060840	4062840	or doesn't want to use it.
4062840	4063840	So...
4064840	4065840	Okay.
4065840	4066840	We'll educate you.
4066840	4067840	Thank you, thank you.
4067840	4070840	That's why I said like send me your recommendations for like,
4070840	4074840	you know, literature, quality, you know,
4074840	4076840	literature because I haven't read them.
4078840	4079840	So, how far?
4082840	4083840	How far?
4086840	4088840	Probably only like...
4089840	4091840	Ah, I want to say like...
4092840	4096840	Maybe like a little 40 centimeters?
4096840	4097840	Not far.
4099840	4100840	Not far.
4102840	4105840	Oh shit, chat just fucking broke for me again.
4105840	4106840	No, no, no, we're good.
4109840	4111840	What are your thoughts on fashion?
4111840	4112840	What do you mean fashion?
4113840	4116840	Not 47, just 40, 40, 40, 40, 40.
4116840	4118840	Don't get your hopes up now.
4121840	4123840	Is that impressive?
4124840	4125840	Can we talk about this?
4125840	4126840	I'm very, very not...
4126840	4129840	I'm very, very unfamiliar with like YouTube rules.
4129840	4131840	If I get bonked on YouTube, I apologize.
4131840	4133840	How do we use marshmallow?
4134840	4135840	It's the link in the description,
4135840	4138840	and you just type your thing and you send it,
4138840	4141840	and you can use like a translator
4141840	4144840	on like a Google Chrome extension translator
4144840	4146840	because the website isn't in Japanese.
4148840	4150840	Would you rather be inflated with liquid like water
4150840	4153840	or juice or with gas like air?
4155840	4156840	Inflation, okay.
4160840	4162840	Okay, let me think about it critically here.
4162840	4166840	If I had to choose, I feel like...
4166840	4167840	Juice is a bad idea.
4167840	4169840	I feel like juice is asking to get some kind of infection
4169840	4170840	inside of my body.
4175840	4178840	So, I'm going to say...
4179840	4184840	I'm going to say whatever is the safest,
4184840	4186840	so either water or air, yeah.
4186840	4189840	Or if I could choose probably none of them.
4192840	4193840	My chat is so laggy.
4193840	4196840	I have a lot of trouble seeing it.
4196840	4198840	Maybe I should reload it again.
4199840	4200840	Chat.
4205840	4207840	Oh, if you could have picked your character,
4207840	4208840	what would you have done?
4209840	4211840	Okay, here was my mindset going in.
4215840	4216840	My mindset was...
4217840	4219840	I don't suit any of the characters.
4220840	4222840	I thought maybe I would suit stabs,
4222840	4224840	but even now looking at Mercy, I was like,
4224840	4226840	damn, Mercy is literally Mercy.
4227840	4228840	Like, I don't...
4229840	4230840	She's not me.
4231840	4237840	So, I didn't really think I would suit any of them.
4238840	4242840	So, I kind of went in hoping for an interview
4242840	4245840	so I could get the experience.
4247840	4248840	I was hoping for an interview
4248840	4250840	so I could get the experience of an interview
4251840	4255840	because I've had the experience of an interview
4255840	4256840	before.
4258840	4260840	And I thought it would be good practice.
4261840	4262840	I don't know how to explain.
4262840	4264840	It was kind of a stupid mindset.
4264840	4266840	I was like, you know what?
4266840	4267840	You know what?
4268840	4269840	I might get an interview,
4269840	4272840	so let me try to get the experience of that.
4273840	4276840	And then will I actually get accepted?
4276840	4278840	Probably not, but I'll do the interview.
4278840	4281840	And then, you know, down the line,
4281840	4283840	if I apply to Hollow Life,
4283840	4285840	I'll be super pro because I'll know how to...
4285840	4286840	I'll know how to talk to them
4286840	4290840	because I've had two freakin' other VTuber interviews.
4293840	4294840	Yeah.
4296840	4298840	Does the rats really stay on during...
4298840	4299840	Yes, it does.
4299840	4300840	Yes, it does.
4302840	4303840	Yeah, unless you can get used to them.
4303840	4306840	Yeah, because during my first VTuber interview ever
4306840	4308840	with unnamed company,
4309840	4311840	it was really, really scary.
4311840	4312840	And it was...
4312840	4314840	I did not do a good job.
4314840	4316840	So I understand why they didn't choose me.
4317840	4318840	But he...
4318840	4319840	I didn't...
4319840	4321840	It was really nerve-wracking.
4321840	4323840	Little did I fucking know
4323840	4326840	that the VLR didn't even give me an interview.
4326840	4328840	They didn't give any of the girls an interview.
4330840	4332840	So I didn't get any interview experience.
4334840	4335840	Yeah.
4336840	4338840	You're in Hollow Life already, Imi-chan.
4338840	4339840	Thank you.
4342840	4343840	Aww.
4349840	4350840	Do you have some sort of routine
4350840	4351840	to prepare for the lulley voice?
4351840	4352840	No, I don't.
4352840	4353840	I just do it.
4353840	4354840	And that's probably why my throat
4354840	4355840	is fucked up right now.
4356840	4357840	But no, I don't.
4357840	4358840	I just do it.
4358840	4359840	It's probably smarter if I do.
4360840	4361840	Yeah.
4361840	4362840	I thought you liked footskin as well.
4362840	4363840	I do, I do.
4364840	4365840	Kind of a shame to admit
4365840	4367840	that I also like to eat my footskin.
4367840	4370840	But I feel like I wouldn't want to eat your footskin.
4370840	4372840	I feel like I know where my feet have been,
4372840	4374840	so I'm comfortable with eating my footskin
4374840	4375840	because it's like,
4375840	4376840	I wash my feet really well
4376840	4377840	every time I take a shower.
4377840	4378840	So like,
4379840	4380840	I'm comfortable with eating
4380840	4381840	and peeling my footskin.
4381840	4382840	But with your footskin,
4382840	4385840	I don't know where those dogs have been.
4385840	4386840	So I don't think I want to eat that.
4386840	4387840	You know?
4390840	4392840	Is the rat plush the reason for the rat suit?
4393840	4394840	No?
4394840	4396840	I just thought the suit was funny.
4400840	4402840	I just thought it was a funny suit.
4406840	4407840	Lemon ginger tea is your friend?
4407840	4408840	I did drink tea.
4408840	4410840	It's not really helping.
4411840	4412840	Can you describe your creative process
4412840	4413840	for your videos and streams?
4415840	4416840	Videos?
4417840	4419840	The years upon years upon years
4419840	4420840	of,
4421840	4422840	content.
4422840	4423840	I've,
4425840	4426840	I've,
4427840	4429840	what do I even call it?
4430840	4431840	Consumed.
4432840	4434840	That's where I get my inspiration from.
4434840	4436840	Literally, I've copied like,
4436840	4438840	I've copied like direct voice lines,
4438840	4439840	voice lines.
4439840	4440840	I've copied direct lines
4440840	4441840	from like other,
4442840	4443840	corn.
4443840	4445840	Yeah,
4445840	4446840	so there, there,
4446840	4447840	that's where I get it from.
4450840	4451840	Strani said,
4451840	4452840	you're cool, get in.
4452840	4453840	Yeah, I,
4453840	4454840	oh yeah,
4454840	4455840	because I told someone
4455840	4456840	to kill themselves in my YouTube chat.
4456840	4457840	That was it.
4458840	4459840	Um,
4459840	4461840	I don't remember doing that to be honest.
4462840	4463840	I have,
4463840	4464840	I have done the pin of shame before,
4464840	4466840	where if someone leaves a,
4466840	4467840	a hate comment,
4467840	4468840	I'll pin the comment and,
4468840	4469840	and uh,
4469840	4470840	maybe I'll say something mean,
4470840	4471840	but I've,
4471840	4473840	but it's mostly so other people bully them.
4474840	4475840	So yeah.
4476840	4477840	Have you watched, dude,
4477840	4479840	that's wholesome before joining feel or,
4479840	4480840	a little bit, yeah,
4480840	4481840	yeah, a little bit.
4481840	4482840	A little bit.
4498840	4499840	I'm sorry,
4499840	4501840	I'm just looking for those concrete slappers.
4504840	4506840	What do you enjoy most about engaging
4506840	4507840	with your community?
4511840	4512840	I don't know.
4513840	4514840	I feel like,
4514840	4515840	I don't know.
4515840	4516840	It's just fun.
4517840	4518840	It's just fun to,
4518840	4519840	to, to do.
4519840	4520840	Like,
4520840	4521840	I don't really,
4521840	4522840	this is so fucking depressing.
4522840	4523840	Oh my God.
4524840	4525840	So,
4525840	4526840	um,
4526840	4528840	I don't really have like real life friends unfortunately.
4528840	4529840	I'm really,
4529840	4531840	really bad at like,
4532840	4534840	keeping up with people in real life.
4534840	4535840	So all the friends I used to have,
4535840	4536840	I,
4536840	4537840	I'm such a terrible person.
4537840	4539840	I can't keep up with them.
4539840	4540840	So like,
4540840	4542840	you guys are like the ones I hang out with.
4543840	4544840	God, that's so depressing.
4544840	4545840	I'm sorry.
4546840	4547840	Do you like us?
4547840	4548840	No.
4548840	4549840	Say ah.
4550840	4551840	I hate you.
4551840	4552840	You're trash.
4557840	4558840	I don't think that's based.
4558840	4560840	I don't like when people say kill to other,
4560840	4561840	kill yourself to other people,
4561840	4562840	but I get it's not serious.
4562840	4563840	Yeah, it's not serious.
4563840	4564840	But also like,
4564840	4565840	if you're gonna leave hate,
4565840	4567840	you should probably expect to get,
4567840	4569840	to get hate back,
4569840	4570840	you know?
4570840	4571840	Um,
4571840	4572840	so,
4572840	4574840	I wasn't really thinking when I,
4574840	4575840	when I did that,
4575840	4576840	but it's,
4576840	4577840	it's like, you know,
4577840	4579840	if you're gonna dish it out,
4579840	4581840	get ready for it to come right back to you.
4587840	4589840	Sonic Generations or any Sonic game.
4589840	4590840	Yeah, I'm not a gamer.
4590840	4592840	I've played like,
4592840	4594840	do you guys know Friv,
4594840	4595840	Friv.com?
4596840	4598840	It's like a really, really old browser,
4598840	4599840	does it still exist?
4599840	4600840	Let me look it up.
4600840	4601840	It's like, okay,
4601840	4602840	maybe it's not that old,
4602840	4603840	but it's old to me.
4604840	4607840	It's like a browser game website.
4609840	4612840	And that's the only place I've played.
4612840	4613840	It still exists,
4613840	4614840	but it looks shitty now.
4614840	4616840	That's not how it used to look like.
4616840	4617840	Yeah, it's just a website
4617840	4618840	where you play browser games.
4618840	4619840	And that's the only place
4619840	4621840	I've played any sort of Sonic game.
4621840	4622840	And I don't know if that's,
4622840	4624840	that was like real Sonic or anything.
4624840	4625840	Hag!
4626840	4627840	Not a hag!
4629840	4630840	Please!
4641840	4643840	Is people getting overly parasocial
4643840	4644840	concern you at all?
4644840	4645840	Well, as long as
4645840	4647840	you don't fucking find my house,
4647840	4648840	no.
4650840	4653840	How automatic is the automatic plushie?
4654840	4655840	I haven't tested it out yet.
4655840	4656840	I don't know.
4656840	4657840	I haven't ordered it yet.
4657840	4658840	Fortunately,
4659840	4660840	thrown takes a little while,
4660840	4662840	takes a couple days for them to
4665840	4667840	because how it works with thrown is
4667840	4669840	they don't always order it for you.
4669840	4671840	Sometimes they just give you the money
4671840	4673840	and then you have to order it yourself
4673840	4674840	and then it takes a few days
4674840	4677840	for them to actually give you the money.
4687840	4689840	Yeah, I was hoping you'd get a test run.
4690840	4691840	Even if I did get a test run,
4691840	4693840	I wouldn't talk about it here.
4699840	4702840	I went to fish after flash games were taken.
4702840	4703840	Fish? What's fish?
4703840	4704840	Is that another?
4705840	4706840	What do you mean?
4706840	4707840	Like did you go to touch grass
4707840	4709840	after flash games were taken out?
4710840	4712840	Is the plushie the same one
4712840	4713840	that she tweeted about?
4715840	4716840	Yes.
4718840	4720840	Listen, I mostly put it there as a meme.
4721840	4722840	It was mostly a meme.
4722840	4723840	I really did not expect.
4724840	4726840	I really did not expect anyone to get it
4726840	4728840	because we're VTubers.
4729840	4731840	I don't want to disappoint anyone,
4731840	4735840	but if you want to see a real life
4735840	4737840	gucci getting gutted,
4738840	4741840	we're not the place for you,
4741840	4743840	but someone got it anyway.
4745840	4746840	Thank you.
4748840	4750840	If you don't know what I'm talking about,
4750840	4751840	I should probably...
4754840	4760840	There is a plush polar bear context,
4760840	4762840	so they don't know what I'm talking about.
4763840	4765840	Polar bear context.
4765840	4767840	There is a plush polar bear
4770840	4773840	that has an extension.
4776840	4777840	It has an extension.
4777840	4782840	It has some other capabilities.
4782840	4783840	I added it to my throne
4783840	4787840	and someone very graciously purchased it.
4787840	4790840	I guess I will be doing something with it.
4793840	4796840	I know what you're talking about,
4796840	4797840	so when I followed her,
4797840	4799840	I replied to that clip I saw it too.
4799840	4800840	Okay, good, good, good, good.
4800840	4802840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4806840	4808840	The clam slam and plushy.
4813840	4814840	You guys should get together
4814840	4815840	and do a burping contest.
4815840	4818840	Honestly, I really, really want to do
4818840	4819840	an off collab one day.
4819840	4821840	I think it would be really funny.
4822840	4825840	So, sure, maybe we can do a burping contest.
4825840	4827840	Honestly, I think I'll win.
4827840	4828840	Just because...
4828840	4830840	Can the other girls burp on command?
4830840	4831840	I'm not sure.
4831840	4833840	If they can, maybe I won't win.
4833840	4834840	But if they can't,
4834840	4836840	then I'm the fucking winner.
4836840	4837840	There's no competition
4837840	4839840	because I can burp on command.
4847840	4849840	I love hearing women have fun.
4850840	4852840	How do you balance v-tubing
4852840	4853840	with other aspects of your life,
4853840	4855840	such as work or school?
4855840	4857840	I'm a loser.
4857840	4859840	I don't have a job.
4863840	4864840	Before this,
4864840	4865840	this was...
4865840	4866840	Before Vealer,
4866840	4868840	this was also my job.
4868840	4871840	So, yeah.
4873840	4875840	School, it was really, really difficult
4875840	4878840	for sure I stayed up during...
4878840	4880840	I have a really bad schedule.
4880840	4882840	I'm hoping that maybe management
4882840	4884840	can help me a little bit more
4884840	4886840	when it comes to schedule stuff.
4886840	4888840	Because...
4888840	4891840	When I was managing myself,
4891840	4893840	it was really, really bad.
4893840	4895840	I would record and then edit
4895840	4898840	and then post all in one day.
4898840	4899840	And...
4899840	4902840	I'm a really big...
4902840	4905840	Well, I used to be a really, really big perfectionist.
4905840	4907840	I'm trying...
4907840	4909840	Trying to let loose a little bit
4909840	4912840	and let the editors take care of it.
4912840	4916840	Let the script writers take care of it.
4916840	4918840	I'm trying not to be so much of a control freak.
4918840	4920840	But before, I was a huge perfectionist.
4920840	4922840	So, it would take me forever
4922840	4924840	to write scripts.
4924840	4927840	It would take me forever to...
4927840	4930840	to record.
4930840	4933840	It would take me forever to edit.
4933840	4936840	So, I would stay up a lot at night
4936840	4939840	until, like, 1, 2, 3...
4939840	4941840	Never 4 a.m.
4941840	4942840	Maybe 4 a.m.
4942840	4945840	I don't know. I would just stay up a lot. That's all.
4945840	4947840	Do you properly take care of yourself?
4947840	4948840	No.
4948840	4951840	You can take care of me.
4952840	4954840	Found you through the other Twitter account?
4954840	4955840	Ah!
4955840	4957840	That's good.
4957840	4960840	I'm glad you enjoyed that.
4960840	4963840	Mom... Mom might give you a run for your money.
4963840	4964840	Will she?
4964840	4966840	We'll see. We'll see.
4966840	4968840	Starting in Shibibirp a bit.
4968840	4969840	They do. They do.
4969840	4971840	Can you burp the ABC?
4976840	4977840	No. No.
4977840	4978840	I think I'm gonna...
4978840	4980840	I'm gonna vomit. I can't.
4982840	4985840	Any hopes, wants, or ideas for a future outfit?
4985840	4987840	A future second outfit at this stage?
4987840	4989840	Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh my god. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
4989840	4991840	Okay, okay, okay.
4991840	4993840	I'm really excited to announce this.
4994840	4999840	I already have a rigger in mind that I've sent to Strani.
4999840	5001840	We will... I want...
5001840	5005840	I think we're playing on reaching out to him soon.
5005840	5007840	They're a really good rigger.
5007840	5009840	Oh my god, I saw their work. They're so fricking good.
5009840	5011840	So I...
5012840	5014840	What I want to do is...
5014840	5018840	I want to design a 2.0 model with you guys.
5018840	5020840	I don't really...
5021840	5023840	I don't really like...
5025840	5027840	I don't really want to do a lot of art streams,
5027840	5030840	mostly because I'm not good at art streams,
5030840	5033840	but oh my god, Zellie's here! Hi!
5033840	5036840	Hi, Zellie. Oh my god, I didn't expect you to be here.
5036840	5038840	Oh my god, I'm flustered.
5039840	5040840	Okay, yeah.
5040840	5041840	So...
5043840	5046840	What I want to do is I want to design a 2.0 with chat.
5047840	5052840	Whenever we get a quote from the rigger,
5053840	5055840	the modeler, I don't know,
5055840	5057840	I will put it on thrown.
5058840	5060840	So that way we can...
5060840	5062840	You can donate to it,
5062840	5065840	to a goal of having a 2.0 model.
5065840	5067840	It's really expensive,
5067840	5070840	but I'm going to do the art myself,
5070840	5075840	so I'm hoping that we will be able to reach the goal
5075840	5078840	and I can get another model soon,
5078840	5080840	because I'll be doing the art myself,
5080840	5083840	so maybe it won't be as expensive as a regular model,
5083840	5087840	because if you don't know a lot of artists
5087840	5091840	and a lot of riggers and a lot of, like, live 2D...
5091840	5093840	Oh, mod Zellie! Oh, fuck you, right.
5093840	5095840	Where is she?
5095840	5097840	Zellie, where'd you go? You're lost in chat.
5097840	5099840	Oh, there she is.
5099840	5101840	Ah, shit.
5102840	5105840	Ah, I can't do it in OBS with a frick.
5105840	5107840	Okay, let me open...
5107840	5109840	So, let me continue, explain.
5109840	5113840	A lot of live 2D artists and stuff
5113840	5116840	actually charge companies more,
5116840	5119840	simply for being companies.
5119840	5122840	They have, like, a corporal...
5122840	5124840	Zellie, I have to find you again.
5132840	5134840	Shit.
5134840	5136840	Oh, there she is.
5138840	5140840	Add as moderator.
5140840	5142840	Standard?
5142840	5144840	Standard, I don't know, standard.
5144840	5147840	Okay, so they actually charge companies
5147840	5149840	more than, like, a regular person,
5149840	5152840	which is understandable, because, um...
5152840	5155840	you know, companies are gonna probably make more money
5155840	5159840	off of your work than, like, a, you know, an indie person,
5159840	5161840	so, uh...
5161840	5163840	I don't think Strawny mentioned
5163840	5165840	how much the models costed.
5165840	5167840	I don't even know if I should,
5167840	5169840	but it was a lot.
5169840	5171840	It was a lot of money.
5171840	5174840	The models costed, like, more than you would expect.
5174840	5177840	Let's just say that. They costed more than you would expect.
5177840	5179840	So...
5179840	5181840	Where was I going with this?
5181840	5184840	Where the fuck was I going with this?
5184840	5188840	So, yeah, if you want us to have 2.0 models, you know, um...
5188840	5190840	you don't have to support us financially,
5190840	5192840	but just watching us is really helpful,
5192840	5194840	like, watching our streams or watching our videos
5194840	5196840	that we put out, um...
5196840	5198840	because once we get monetized, you know,
5198840	5200840	ad revenue will help us.
5200840	5202840	But yeah, models, 2K top?
5204840	5206840	Not even close, bro.
5206840	5209840	I was so surprised when I learned how much they cost.
5209840	5211840	I was really, really surprised.
5211840	5213840	I was like, oh, my God.
5213840	5215840	It was a crazy amount, okay?
5216840	5218840	For individually, it was a crazy amount.
5218840	5220840	I'm not gonna...
5220840	5222840	You could ask Strani, okay?
5222840	5226840	But anyways, because I'll be drawing the model art myself,
5226840	5231840	I think, I think, I think, I think a 2.0 should be like...
5231840	5234840	I want to say 3K,
5234840	5237840	because it's just gonna be paying for the raker.
5237840	5239840	But we'll see.
5239840	5242840	Anyways, one jazillion dollars.
5243840	5246840	I really want to design a 2.0 with you.
5246840	5247840	Yeah.
5247840	5249840	And I want to make it emo.
5249840	5251840	I want to make it emo.
5251840	5253840	I think that would be really funny.
5256840	5258840	You're doing your own work.
5258840	5259840	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5259840	5261840	Did you use a model on your stream before?
5261840	5263840	Yes, of course. I was a V2 player before this.
5263840	5266840	And I made my own model before.
5266840	5268840	I can help design.
5268840	5270840	Yes, I would love that.
5271840	5273840	I made my own model.
5273840	5276840	I can rig,
5276840	5279840	but I don't really want to make my own 2.0 model
5279840	5282840	because I'm actually kind of trash at rigging.
5282840	5284840	I'm not good at it.
5284840	5286840	So that's why I would like to get someone else to do that,
5286840	5288840	but I can do the art.
5291840	5293840	What kind of emo?
5294840	5296840	Like basic emo?
5297840	5299840	Internet emo?
5299840	5301840	I don't know.
5301840	5303840	Gothic maybe?
5304840	5305840	Get free.
5305840	5307840	I already have someone in mind.
5307840	5309840	I already know who I want.
5314840	5316840	I think you'll recognize the person's work.
5316840	5318840	They're good. I've seen their stuff before.
5322840	5324840	You should do 2000's emo.
5324840	5325840	Gothic Lolita? I don't know.
5326840	5329840	Something dark and mysterious.
5332840	5334840	Is 2.0 still going to be emo?
5334840	5336840	Of course.
5336840	5338840	I can't completely change.
5338840	5340840	I'm emo now.
5340840	5342840	I can't completely change this design.
5342840	5344840	That would be so mean.
5346840	5348840	It'll still be emo, of course,
5348840	5350840	but we'll have a different hairstyle.
5350840	5352840	We'll have different...
5352840	5354840	I got you, Bish.
5354840	5356840	It'll be really cute.
5356840	5358840	Unless you mean like I'm still going to use
5358840	5360840	this model art?
5360840	5362840	No, I'm not.
5362840	5365840	I will be redrawing it entirely.
5365840	5368840	I'm not going to just replace the hair and stuff.
5368840	5370840	I would pay a go-rillion dollars for...
5370840	5372840	for emo in me.
5372840	5374840	You guys are so cute.
5376840	5378840	Some of the biggest technical challenges
5378840	5380840	you face during the transition?
5380840	5382840	Technical challenges?
5382840	5384840	Sorry, I don't know.
5384840	5386840	I don't know.
5386840	5388840	I don't know.
5388840	5390840	I don't know.
5390840	5392840	I don't know.
5392840	5394840	I don't know.
5394840	5396840	I don't know.
5396840	5398840	Technical challenge?
5398840	5401840	Sorry, I'm so bad at reading the full chat message.
5401840	5403840	Someone asked what's the biggest technical challenge
5403840	5405840	you face?
5415840	5417840	None?
5418840	5420840	I don't think there was.
5420840	5422840	The only... I don't know what you mean by technical
5422840	5424840	different software?
5424840	5426840	No?
5426840	5428840	I...
5428840	5430840	I didn't get any new equipment
5430840	5432840	from feel or I already had
5432840	5434840	all of the equipment I needed.
5434840	5436840	So,
5436840	5438840	I didn't have to learn anything new.
5440840	5442840	Some of the other girls, you know,
5442840	5444840	aren't as experienced with ASMR.
5444840	5446840	That doesn't mean they're bad at it though.
5446840	5448840	They're probably better than me.
5448840	5450840	You know?
5450840	5452840	So, yeah.
5452840	5454840	So, I didn't really have to
5454840	5456840	do anything.
5458840	5460840	The only really issue I have
5460840	5462840	is trying not to be so much of a
5462840	5464840	control freak when it comes to like,
5464840	5466840	you know, my content
5466840	5468840	because, you know, I have to give it off
5468840	5470840	to someone else.
5470840	5472840	And they will do the work
5472840	5474840	for me and I will get it back
5474840	5476840	and I can't
5476840	5478840	find their house and knock on their door
5478840	5480840	and tell them
5480840	5482840	and give them a whole giant list
5482840	5484840	of things to change because
5484840	5486840	then that's just gonna make
5486840	5488840	it take forever for every single audio
5488840	5490840	and as much as I want
5490840	5492840	to do that, that's really annoying.
5492840	5494840	So, yeah.
5494840	5496840	Thoughts on beavers?
5496840	5498840	I've never seen one in real life actually.
5500840	5502840	Scuff is usually part of every process.
5502840	5504840	The only, I mean like,
5504840	5506840	the only issue I have is my,
5506840	5508840	my fucking iPhone.
5508840	5510840	It keeps disconnecting.
5512840	5514840	And sometimes it doesn't even work at all.
5514840	5516840	That's the only issue.
5516840	5518840	And also like,
5518840	5520840	YouTube is stupid. Like, this YouTube
5520840	5522840	chat is stupid.
5522840	5524840	YouTube should fix that.
5524840	5526840	Someone sent an email right now
5526840	5528840	to YouTube CEO.
5528840	5530840	Fix it. What is your response
5530840	5532840	to the skibbity toilet allegations?
5532840	5534840	It's fake! It's fake fucking news!
5534840	5536840	Shibi made that shit up! It wasn't me!
5536840	5538840	I swear to god.
5538840	5540840	I swear to god.
5540840	5542840	Let it be known here in front of the court of law.
5544840	5546840	I didn't, I never said
5546840	5548840	shibbity toilet.
5548840	5550840	I never said shibbity toilet not even once.
5550840	5552840	I don't know where you got that from.
5552840	5554840	I never said shibbity toilet.
5556840	5558840	It was mercy. There you fucking go!
5558840	5560840	Admission of guilt.
5560840	5562840	It was mercy.
5562840	5564840	Mercy is the one that said it.
5564840	5566840	And you put it on me,
5566840	5568840	and now people are like,
5568840	5570840	what a fucking zoomer.
5570840	5572840	Shibbity toilet.
5572840	5574840	Blame mercy.
5574840	5576840	It was mercy.
5578840	5580840	YouTube street have told
5580840	5582840	that they are doing anything for streaming.
5582840	5584840	They aren't doing anything for streaming anytime soon.
5584840	5586840	Oh well, they can suck my dick. I don't know.
5586840	5588840	YouTube is not optimized for streaming.
5588840	5590840	Yeah. Which is understandable,
5590840	5592840	but also like,
5592840	5594840	lots of people stream on YouTube so optimize it.
5596840	5598840	Yeah, it was mercy.
5602840	5604840	We still got 30 minutes left.
5604840	5606840	Objection, shibi never lies.
5606840	5608840	Shibi does lie.
5610840	5612840	Or was it our manager? No, it was mercy.
5616840	5618840	YouTube is pursuing shorts?
5618840	5620840	Are they?
5620840	5622840	I don't know.
5622840	5624840	I'm kind of...
5624840	5626840	I'm biased against shorts when it comes to
5626840	5628840	like YouTube shorts.
5630840	5632840	Because when I posted shorts,
5632840	5634840	not just on this channel, but on other channels,
5634840	5636840	like the same content
5636840	5638840	that would get popular
5638840	5640840	on other platforms
5640840	5642840	never really saw any reach
5642840	5644840	when it comes to shorts.
5644840	5646840	So I might even just ask management
5646840	5648840	if like, if my shorts aren't getting views,
5648840	5650840	I might even just be like,
5650840	5652840	hey guys, can we like just
5652840	5654840	post them on other platforms
5654840	5656840	and not post them on YouTube?
5656840	5658840	Because what's the point?
5658840	5660840	You know, I feel like, I don't know,
5660840	5662840	maybe they used to push shorts
5662840	5664840	a lot in the past,
5664840	5666840	but I feel like not anymore as much.
5668840	5670840	But maybe that's just me. I've never really been
5672840	5674840	I've never really been lucky
5674840	5676840	when it comes to algorithm stuff.
5676840	5678840	I've always been like, fighting.
5678840	5680840	I've always been fighting to the nail
5680840	5682840	when it comes to algorithm stuff.
5686840	5688840	Yeah, it's wildly inconsistent.
5690840	5692840	Yeah.
5698840	5700840	7K, I know, but like,
5700840	5702840	I don't know how else to...
5702840	5704840	7K
5704840	5706840	Do I sound prissy
5706840	5708840	if I say 7K isn't that much?
5708840	5710840	Like, I feel like
5710840	5712840	I feel like other platforms
5712840	5714840	that are more
5714840	5716840	focused on shorts might have more
5716840	5718840	talking like I'm a real fucking content creator,
5718840	5720840	like I know what I'm fucking talking about.
5720840	5722840	I don't know what I'm talking about, but I feel like
5722840	5724840	they might have more potential.
5724840	5726840	I just don't have faith in like, YouTube shorts.
5726840	5728840	That's all.
5730840	5732840	Uh uh uh uh.
5732840	5734840	Many say they regret hyper-focusing on shorts.
5736840	5738840	I don't know. I also hear that
5738840	5740840	shorts um...
5740840	5742840	I also hear that shorts like
5742840	5744840	get you subscribers
5744840	5746840	but they're always like dead subscribers.
5746840	5748840	Is that true?
5748840	5750840	Girl talk right now, okay? Let's um...
5752840	5754840	What's it called?
5756840	5758840	I keep fucking forgetting words.
5761840	5763840	Okay, well I forgot the word.
5763840	5765840	But like...
5765840	5767840	Wait, what was I talking about?
5768840	5770840	Oh yeah. Yeah, shorts get views
5770840	5772840	but do they get you like subscribers? Cause I feel like
5772840	5774840	the subscribers might be dead.
5774840	5776840	Like I feel like, not saying they're bots
5776840	5778840	but I feel like it's like
5778840	5780840	the shorts viewers are just like zoomers
5780840	5782840	that actually don't really stay around for your content.
5782840	5784840	They're just there for shorts.
5784840	5786840	Is this true?
5786840	5788840	I do have...
5788840	5790840	My grandma does have Alzheimer's.
5790840	5792840	Alzheimer's doesn't run in my family.
5792840	5794840	Yeah. Asked Strani?
5794840	5796840	I don't know. I uh...
5796840	5798840	I don't know. I don't know if Strani would know.
5802840	5804840	I get more money off a 20k
5804840	5806840	video than a 2 million view
5806840	5808840	shorts. Yeah, that's true too.
5814840	5816840	You get subs but they never go up.
5816840	5818840	They never show up.
5818840	5820840	Yeah, lots of kids do this girl.
5822840	5824840	We must find the meta. We'll find it together.
5824840	5826840	I'm sorry to hear about your grandma.
5826840	5828840	It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
5828840	5830840	I won't trauma dump to you about my grandma.
5830840	5832840	But if I ever forget things
5832840	5834840	or words, it happens like a lot.
5834840	5836840	I forget words a lot.
5838840	5840840	A dead sub is better than no sub though.
5842840	5844840	Maybe for other people but for me
5844840	5846840	I would not prefer dead subs.
5854840	5856840	Some people shout on me for
5856840	5858840	having a tiktok stream.
5858840	5860840	They were like cringe tiktok
5860840	5862840	as if you bitches aren't watching youtube shorts
5862840	5864840	and like
5864840	5866840	and like instagram reels
5866840	5868840	and like I don't know any other kind of facebook
5870840	5872840	like it's all the same stuff.
5872840	5874840	It's all the same stuff
5874840	5876840	and plus I'm not going to be going
5876840	5878840	I'm not going to be logging on to tiktok.com
5878840	5880840	and scrolling through my 4u page together
5880840	5882840	I'm going to be curating it
5882840	5884840	and showing you my absolute favorite
5884840	5886840	short form content
5886840	5888840	and you know
5888840	5890840	if you don't like tiktok that's okay
5890840	5892840	because it's basically just a meme review.
5892840	5894840	Maximum little sister immersion
5894840	5896840	you're going to
5896840	5898840	sit with me and I'm going to make you
5898840	5900840	watch me drool on my ipad
5900840	5902840	as I scroll through my tiktok
5902840	5904840	4u page
5904840	5906840	and cough in your face
5916840	5918840	How about a girl like you show
5918840	5920840	you her funny little videos that makes you laugh
5920840	5922840	I know but I think some people saw tiktok
5922840	5924840	and they were like cringe tiktok
5926840	5928840	maybe I should have said shorts
5928840	5930840	or maybe I should have said memes
5930840	5932840	I don't know but yeah
5932840	5934840	I do scroll tiktok everyday
5934840	5936840	thank you thank you
5936840	5938840	but like I said it's all short
5938840	5940840	all short form content websites
5940840	5942840	just kind of have the same content
5942840	5944840	because people repost their stuff there
5944840	5946840	which yeah
5946840	5948840	I see in disguise what you mean I see in disguise
5948840	5950840	don't worry if the sub dies
5950840	5952840	just bring him back with your spellbook
5952840	5954840	oh I forgot to mention oh my god
5954840	5956840	okay so
5956840	5958840	shebe is into this too
5958840	5960840	me and shebe both do witchcraft
5960840	5962840	I'm sure shebe is more
5962840	5964840	experienced with it
5964840	5966840	well like me and shebe like both
5966840	5968840	genuinely do it
5968840	5970840	I think even mercy a little bit
5970840	5972840	I think even mercy a little bit
5972840	5974840	I think even mercy a little bit
5974840	5976840	I think even mercy a little bit
5976840	5978840	I think doing a witchcraft stream
5978840	5980840	would be really fun the problem is
5980840	5982840	some people may shit on me for my witchcraft
5982840	5984840	because like I don't
5984840	5986840	I don't go by any books
5986840	5988840	because to me it's like
5990840	5992840	I feel like to me it's like
5992840	5994840	not that serious
5994840	5996840	like I don't follow a lot
5996840	5998840	of witchcraft rules
5998840	6000840	because it's like
6002840	6004840	I don't want to offend any witches
6004840	6006840	and chat any witches or wizards
6006840	6008840	and chat
6008840	6010840	they're all gonna curse me
6010840	6012840	they're all gonna hex me
6014840	6016840	so yeah basically
6016840	6018840	if I do some stupid shit
6018840	6020840	during witchcraft streams it's because
6022840	6024840	I'm not like a pro
6024840	6026840	wizard
6026840	6028840	I am not truly part of the shadow
6028840	6030840	money wizard gang I am just
6030840	6032840	a fraud I guess
6034840	6036840	I would probably shit
6036840	6038840	on something you do
6038840	6040840	with love
6040840	6042840	as long as it's with love
6042840	6044840	shadow wizard here
6044840	6046840	I'm very offended
6046840	6048840	I'm sorry please please please please
6048840	6050840	please don't curse me I'm sorry I'm sorry
6050840	6052840	yeah terror stream
6052840	6054840	that would be fun that would be fun
6058840	6060840	oh my god okay hold on let me drink some water
6064840	6066840	what strategies do you use
6066840	6068840	to retain your original ASMR audience
6068840	6070840	while attracting your new viewers
6070840	6072840	as a youtuber?
6072840	6074840	none? I am very well aware
6074840	6076840	that ASMR people like
6076840	6078840	there's like this weird thing
6078840	6080840	Starry talked about it too
6080840	6082840	there's this weird thing
6082840	6084840	about like
6084840	6086840	oh god this is so chronically online
6086840	6088840	and boring and like weird
6088840	6090840	and like stupid like go touch grass
6090840	6092840	but I feel like
6092840	6094840	and Starry agreed with me
6094840	6096840	there's this weird thing where
6096840	6098840	whenever an ASMRist
6098840	6100840	starts to delve into
6100840	6102840	v-tubing they get hate for it
6102840	6104840	which is so weird
6104840	6106840	because I feel like the
6106840	6108840	I feel like the audience
6108840	6110840	is very similar so you think it's like
6110840	6112840	people would be happy
6112840	6114840	but when I did it I got hate for it
6114840	6116840	I got comments like
6116840	6118840	another one
6118840	6120840	another one
6120840	6122840	oh my god
6136840	6138840	okay
6138840	6140840	like what do you mean another one
6140840	6142840	like they're basically just streaming
6142840	6144840	as an anime girl and you've been clicking
6144840	6146840	on their thumbnails with anime girls
6146840	6148840	in the thumbnail like why are you annoyed
6148840	6150840	that they're now turning into an anime girl
6150840	6152840	like you've been watching
6152840	6154840	anime girl content
6154840	6156840	I don't get it
6156840	6158840	but
6158840	6160840	um yeah so I have
6160840	6162840	I don't have a strategy
6162840	6164840	because I won't be surprised
6164840	6166840	if I get no people from there
6166840	6168840	because the content is so different
6168840	6170840	like I will say like
6170840	6172840	I'm still planning on doing ASMR content
6172840	6174840	for sure for sure for sure for like we will have videos
6174840	6176840	I'm planning a slime girl
6176840	6178840	one for the first one I don't know if it will get removed
6178840	6180840	by you too because
6180840	6182840	slime girl is very wet but I want to do
6182840	6184840	a slime girl for the first video
6184840	6186840	um
6186840	6188840	um
6188840	6190840	yeah
6190840	6192840	so many vtubers do ASMR
6192840	6194840	yeah exactly like why is it so
6194840	6196840	what what what what
6196840	6198840	what
6202840	6204840	I want to keep you your
6204840	6206840	third D
6206840	6208840	they want to keep your third D
6208840	6210840	what does that mean
6212840	6214840	find the ASMR streamers don't get any views
6214840	6216840	when they stream non ASMR
6216840	6218840	that's true but I like ASMR
6218840	6220840	so I'm okay with streaming ASMR
6220840	6222840	it is weird I'm guessing they're worried about
6222840	6224840	that their ASMR is going to stop ASMR
6224840	6226840	all together yeah I think
6226840	6228840	they assume that but like
6228840	6230840	that's often not
6230840	6232840	the case
6232840	6234840	I mean sometimes it is
6238840	6240840	she is not my oh she
6240840	6242840	she is to be rejected in shunt
6244840	6246840	fuck this bitch
6250840	6252840	okay I keep seeing this question
6252840	6254840	a lot I don't know if it's the same person
6254840	6256840	thank you for the verb reading
6256840	6258840	um
6258840	6260840	someone keeps saying
6260840	6262840	why did what inspired you to be a vtuber
6264840	6266840	um
6268840	6270840	can I say this
6270840	6272840	I used to be a fleshtuber
6272840	6274840	I used to be a fleshtuber
6274840	6276840	yeah I used to be a fleshtuber
6276840	6278840	what inspired me to start streaming was
6278840	6280840	I had this friend that I met
6280840	6282840	and he he was like
6282840	6284840	oh
6284840	6286840	I'm a streamer and I was like dude
6286840	6288840	that's so fucking gay and boring why would you ever stream
6288840	6290840	it was a commissioner
6290840	6292840	at the time so obviously like it was a dude
6292840	6294840	that commissioned me and he was like
6294840	6296840	I'm a streamer I'm commissioning you
6296840	6298840	your art for my stream right
6298840	6300840	and I was like
6300840	6302840	that's cringe
6304840	6306840	in my head I was like that's cringe
6306840	6308840	but I was like
6308840	6310840	sure yeah yeah yeah
6310840	6312840	I'll do some art for you
6312840	6314840	for your stream
6314840	6316840	and then
6316840	6318840	when I like tuned into the stream
6318840	6320840	I was like
6320840	6322840	maybe this is kinda cool
6322840	6324840	maybe this is kinda cool
6324840	6326840	actually I kind of ate my words
6326840	6328840	I was like oh actually
6328840	6330840	actually you know
6330840	6332840	maybe maybe I can do this too
6332840	6334840	so I
6334840	6336840	did it
6336840	6338840	and I had a lot of fun with it and I was like
6338840	6340840	oh my god
6340840	6342840	this is kind of fun and I remember
6342840	6344840	my first stream
6344840	6346840	what I did was I had a laptop at the time
6346840	6348840	so I streamed on my laptop
6348840	6350840	and then I used
6350840	6352840	like my phone
6352840	6354840	as like a facecam
6354840	6356840	and then I didn't even have a microphone I used
6356840	6358840	my laptop microphone
6358840	6360840	and then I was having so much fun
6360840	6362840	with like
6362840	6364840	I think I had like one viewer maybe
6364840	6366840	so um
6366840	6368840	I was having so much fun
6368840	6370840	but then like halfway through the stream
6370840	6372840	my work called me
6372840	6374840	and it made my phone
6374840	6376840	like fall off of the stand
6376840	6378840	so my facecam fell
6378840	6380840	and I had to like answer the
6380840	6382840	the work call during stream
6382840	6384840	and I was like hello
6384840	6386840	and they were like hey Emmy can you come in
6386840	6388840	tomorrow at I don't know 3pm
6388840	6390840	and I was like
6390840	6392840	nope
6392840	6394840	I never came in
6394840	6396840	when they asked me to
6396840	6398840	but um
6398840	6400840	and then I like
6400840	6402840	stream right after that cause like
6402840	6404840	I didn't
6404840	6406840	I didn't want this stream to like
6406840	6408840	you know
6408840	6410840	continue after work called me
6410840	6412840	um
6412840	6414840	I don't think I have that
6414840	6416840	that stream
6416840	6418840	like saved but it was really cringe
6418840	6420840	and I had a lot of fun and then I continued
6422840	6424840	hold on
6430840	6432840	ok
6434840	6436840	I continued until
6436840	6438840	I
6438840	6440840	sometimes I would just use a vtuber
6440840	6442840	because I wanted to have big boobs
6442840	6444840	and so I would find like a 3d model
6444840	6446840	with really big boobs and I would
6446840	6448840	like jiggle them around
6448840	6450840	jiggle them around
6450840	6452840	it was really fun to just use one
6452840	6454840	to have big boobs
6454840	6456840	um
6456840	6458840	and then um
6460840	6462840	I saw like
6462840	6464840	prism project auditions
6464840	6466840	and I didn't even know what hollow life was
6466840	6468840	but I was like whoa
6468840	6470840	there's like companies for this shit
6470840	6472840	damn
6472840	6474840	um
6474840	6476840	Emmy voice on the serum
6476840	6478840	it was
6478840	6480840	it was funny ok it was funny
6482840	6484840	one moment oh my god
6484840	6486840	I'm sick ok I'm sick for any new people
6486840	6488840	I'm sick right now
6490840	6492840	right
6492840	6494840	so anyways
6494840	6496840	um
6496840	6498840	I saw prism project auditions
6498840	6500840	and I was like yo
6500840	6502840	this was meant for me
6502840	6504840	I've been using a vtuber model
6504840	6506840	I know how to do this
6506840	6508840	I'm totally getting it
6508840	6510840	and yeah prism project is gone now
6510840	6512840	um
6512840	6514840	unfortunately you know what it's gone
6514840	6516840	because I wasn't in there I would have saved that company
6516840	6518840	I would have gotten them so much money
6518840	6520840	they would still be here if I was in there
6520840	6522840	I thought I was in there I'm kidding
6522840	6524840	I'm kidding I'm kidding
6524840	6526840	no I probably would have gone down with them
6526840	6528840	if I had ever joined
6528840	6530840	but um
6532840	6534840	obviously I got rejected
6534840	6536840	of course with that I'd be like are you fucking kidding me
6536840	6538840	oh my god it would be so funny to show you guys my old prism project audition
6538840	6540840	it was so funny
6540840	6542840	it was so funny
6542840	6544840	it was so fucking funny
6544840	6546840	you will cringe
6546840	6548840	so hard
6548840	6550840	but um
6552840	6554840	after that I was kind of
6554840	6556840	really like
6556840	6558840	mad because I was like what
6558840	6560840	are you kidding me I got rejected
6560840	6562840	so um
6562840	6564840	I stopped streaming
6564840	6566840	all together because I was busy
6566840	6568840	but then afterwards um
6568840	6570840	one of my other friends
6570840	6572840	one of my other streamer friends
6572840	6574840	because I hadn't made streamer friends during this time was like
6574840	6576840	oh
6576840	6578840	you should you can draw anime
6578840	6580840	so maybe you should try drawing
6580840	6582840	vtuber models because you can make
6582840	6584840	money off of that
6584840	6586840	and at first I was like
6586840	6588840	that looks complicated right
6588840	6590840	um
6592840	6594840	at first I was like oh that looks complicated
6594840	6596840	I don't know and then I tried it once
6596840	6598840	and learned and I was like
6598840	6600840	it's kind of easy
6600840	6602840	it's not as hard as it looks
6602840	6604840	um
6604840	6606840	and so that's when I
6606840	6608840	learned how to make vtuber models and I was like
6608840	6610840	well I'm here now
6610840	6612840	so let me make a model for myself too
6612840	6614840	and uh
6614840	6616840	now we're here
6616840	6618840	that was a long ass story
6622840	6624840	do show
6624840	6626840	I don't let me see if I can even
6626840	6628840	find it
6628840	6630840	what's really crazy was
6630840	6632840	um
6632840	6634840	not crazy but cringe
6634840	6636840	it might not be on this computer
6636840	6638840	it might be on my old laptop
6638840	6640840	I'll try to look for it on this computer
6640840	6642840	but I'm not sure if it's here
6642840	6644840	um
6644840	6646840	during that time
6646840	6648840	the only thing I knew about vtubers was like
6648840	6650840	what I had seen from prison project
6650840	6652840	and I was like oh they like cute girls
6652840	6654840	they want to hear a cute voice
6656840	6658840	um
6660840	6662840	what is this
6662840	6664840	oh I just found my script for my audition
6664840	6666840	aw
6666840	6668840	bro
6668840	6670840	so what I did was
6670840	6672840	at first I was like okay let me try to be a cute girl
6672840	6674840	right
6674840	6676840	but I couldn't make the voice
6676840	6678840	and that's why it's really cringe
6678840	6680840	I couldn't do it I couldn't it was
6680840	6682840	I was really bad at voice acting so instead I was like
6682840	6684840	okay
6684840	6686840	let me be a MILF
6686840	6688840	let me voice act as a MILF
6688840	6690840	because they had some
6690840	6692840	some mommy type models so I was like
6692840	6694840	let me let me try that
6694840	6696840	so I roleplayed
6696840	6698840	as a 40 year old
6698840	6700840	I roleplayed
6700840	6702840	as a 40 year old
6702840	6704840	MILF
6706840	6708840	in my prison project audition
6708840	6710840	I literally said I'm 40 years old
6710840	6712840	and I have two daughters
6714840	6716840	and then I flirted
6716840	6718840	with the listener
6718840	6720840	during the whole
6720840	6722840	because their thing was like introduce yourself
6722840	6724840	in a character
6724840	6726840	so I basically flirted with
6726840	6728840	the listener as
6728840	6730840	as my audition
6730840	6732840	let me see what I found
6732840	6734840	I found the script I don't know if I can find
6736840	6738840	oh god the dog is parking
6738840	6740840	downstairs type
6740840	6742840	video
6742840	6744840	videos
6744840	6746840	I found the
6746840	6748840	modified
6748840	6750840	no
6754840	6756840	well I can't find the video
6756840	6758840	but I can read to you a bit of the script
6758840	6760840	hold on
6760840	6762840	I was like it's in dead a 40 year old
6762840	6764840	MILF
6764840	6766840	let me see
6774840	6776840	I fed
6776840	6778840	I roleplayed feeding the listener
6778840	6780840	noodles
6780840	6782840	I was like open wide
6782840	6784840	see I told you
6786840	6788840	you doubt me too much
6788840	6790840	if you keep doing this I'll just have to
6790840	6792840	give you some firsthand experience
6792840	6794840	of what I can really do
6798840	6800840	I read it in a mommy voice
6800840	6802840	that'll have to be me showing you
6802840	6804840	my big sister
6804840	6806840	oh my god fuck I didn't even realize
6806840	6808840	we're close to two hours
6810840	6812840	I gotta keep my eye on the time
6812840	6814840	cause we're gonna read a 0 after this too
6816840	6818840	but yeah that was me
6818840	6820840	that was me trying to be a MILF
6820840	6822840	for a prison project
6822840	6824840	what happens to your liberty channel now
6824840	6826840	nothing
6826840	6828840	it'll stay up but all my new content
6828840	6830840	will be here
6830840	6832840	that's it
6832840	6834840	can we see the mascot
6834840	6836840	I apologize
6836840	6838840	sure
6840840	6842840	I think I should probably post
6844840	6846840	the mascot on twitter right
6850840	6852840	wait where is the mascot
6858840	6860840	here it is
6860840	6862840	oh that's humongous
6870840	6872840	here it is here's the mascot
6872840	6874840	you can see the old mascot
6874840	6876840	in my background music video
6878840	6880840	the bgm
6882840	6884840	I just thought it was a little too menacing
6884840	6886840	and all the other girls
6886840	6888840	had like really cute mascots
6888840	6890840	and I was like
6890840	6892840	I want something cute so I drew something cute
6892840	6894840	and this is it
6894840	6896840	I mostly got inspiration from like
6896840	6898840	Pinterest photos
6898840	6900840	but yeah here's the picture of the mascot
6900840	6902840	if you wanna draw
6902840	6904840	if you wanna draw yourself
6904840	6906840	the little pin pals there you go
6906840	6908840	here I'll put it in the corner maybe
6910840	6912840	down here up here
6912840	6914840	yeah so cute
6916840	6918840	yes this is
6918840	6920840	this is different from the schedule
6920840	6922840	the schedule has the old mascot on it
6924840	6926840	did Azura start streaming yet
6926840	6928840	let me check
6928840	6930840	I think I made it
6930840	6932840	so that it automatically
6932840	6934840	raids right
6938840	6940840	so cute
6940840	6942840	can I eat it you wanna eat yourself
6942840	6944840	yourself
6948840	6950840	ok now yeah I'll stay with you until Azura starts
6952840	6954840	can you wink
6954840	6956840	ah that was kinda cute
6956840	6958840	oh my god I just cut it
6958840	6960840	I kinda just like
6960840	6962840	I blushed at myself
6964840	6966840	there you go that's me winking
6966840	6968840	I can wink now
6968840	6970840	I couldn't wink before
6970840	6972840	but now I can
6980840	6982840	what inspired you to make the leap to 18 plus content
6984840	6986840	so I actually
6986840	6988840	was gonna make
6988840	6990840	like ok
6992840	6994840	I listened to it a lot before
6994840	6996840	and I listened to it a lot before
6996840	6998840	and since I was doing
6998840	7000840	I was already doing you know
7000840	7002840	the safer work stuff
7002840	7004840	I actually planned on starting
7004840	7006840	way way earlier than I
7006840	7008840	then I ended up starting
7010840	7012840	but I kind of
7012840	7014840	just like I was
7014840	7016840	it was always in the back of my head
7016840	7018840	I was like yeah I'm gonna do it soon eventually
7018840	7020840	but I had put a goal in my head
7020840	7022840	that I thought I would never reach
7022840	7024840	when it comes to subscribers
7024840	7026840	I was like once I get 25,000 subscribers
7026840	7028840	I will
7028840	7030840	I will do
7030840	7032840	you know 18 plus a somewhere
7032840	7034840	and then I got 25,000 subscribers
7034840	7036840	like way faster than I thought I would
7036840	7038840	and I was like oh fuck I'm not ready
7038840	7040840	I didn't think I would actually get that amount hold on
7040840	7042840	wait wait wait I'm not ready
7042840	7044840	so
7044840	7046840	so you know I just made it
7046840	7048840	when I was finally ready
7048840	7050840	yeah basically I listened to it before
7050840	7052840	and I was like maybe I should do it too
7054840	7056840	um
7060840	7062840	what a sweet and innocent looking peach
7064840	7066840	um
7066840	7068840	is this stream finishing before your neighbors?
7068840	7070840	my neighbors have stopped now
7070840	7072840	I don't hear it anymore
7072840	7074840	yeah from consuming it
7074840	7076840	to making it yupp
7076840	7078840	yupp yupp yupp yupp
7078840	7080840	um
7082840	7084840	the concept for your eyes
7084840	7086840	like the eggs?
7088840	7090840	ask strawny
7090840	7092840	I didn't design the character I don't know
7096840	7098840	they're in the afterglow
7098840	7100840	they're sleeping now
7100840	7102840	shh don't wake them up
7104840	7106840	okay though
7106840	7108840	um
7108840	7110840	that was a weak performance
7110840	7112840	is it because you didn't hear it?
7112840	7114840	I heard it
7114840	7116840	honestly
7118840	7120840	I don't want to trash talk my neighbors
7120840	7122840	but I don't know how the guy downstairs gets it dude
7122840	7124840	he's like
7124840	7126840	oh my god I should probably talk about
7126840	7128840	I don't know how the guy downstairs gets any pussy
7128840	7130840	he's like
7130840	7132840	kind of annoying
7132840	7134840	and ugly
7136840	7138840	and he's kind of mean
7138840	7140840	I don't know how he gets any
7142840	7144840	and he's kind of stinky like I've seen inside his
7144840	7146840	I've seen inside his apartment
7146840	7148840	and I'm like bro
7148840	7150840	bro clean up a little
7154840	7156840	you didn't hear that from me though
7166840	7168840	start moaning louder
7168840	7170840	no
7170840	7172840	they've already heard me moaning anyways
7174840	7176840	buttons like a voodoo doll
7176840	7178840	probably yeah
7178840	7180840	yeah the eyes probably do represent
7180840	7182840	that would make sense
7190840	7192840	sorry I know I'm being quiet
7192840	7194840	my voice hurts after talking for so long
7196840	7198840	what's the thing
7198840	7200840	or item you would steal from the other girls
7200840	7202840	they're tits
7202840	7204840	so I can touch them
7204840	7206840	duh
7206840	7208840	you think I want to be flat
7208840	7210840	you think I chose this
7210840	7212840	I want boobies
7212840	7214840	I want big hunkers
7214840	7216840	so
7216840	7218840	I don't know
7218840	7220840	I don't know
7220840	7222840	I don't know
7222840	7224840	I don't know
7224840	7226840	so of course if I could steal
7226840	7228840	something from the other girls
7228840	7230840	I would steal their boobies
7240840	7242840	flat is justice
7242840	7244840	you ain't flat
7244840	7246840	I'm not
7246840	7248840	really you think so

7250840	7252840	is it
7254840	7256840	ok well I'm glad you think
7256840	7258840	my suffering is cute
7258840	7260840	maybe the 2.0 will have tits

7262840	7264840	I can't I can't do that
7264840	7266840	image flat flat is ok therefore
7266840	7268840	image is ok
7270840	7272840	did you guys
7272840	7274840	there's this one image I really want to show you

7276840	7278840	will
7278840	7280840	there's this maybe someone can find it for me
7280840	7282840	there's this meme
7282840	7284840	of this anime girl
7284840	7286840	and she has like really flat boobs
7286840	7288840	but the meme was like oh
7288840	7290840	you know flat boobs
7290840	7292840	they're just they're just hiding
7292840	7294840	like in another dimension or something
7294840	7296840	and then you can see behind her
7296840	7298840	you can see behind her
7298840	7300840	and like there's like giant tits
7300840	7302840	coming out of the other side of her
7302840	7304840	does that make sense
7304840	7306840	I don't know
7306840	7308840	I don't know if anyone has ever seen that meme
7310840	7312840	inverted yeah I know the one
7312840	7314840	that's that's what I have
7314840	7316840	ok can someone link
7316840	7318840	that freaking meme
7318840	7320840	or at least say like where the artists
7320840	7322840	or something
7322840	7324840	inverted giant
7324840	7326840	boobs meme
7328840	7330840	no
7330840	7332840	it's like some anime
7332840	7334840	meme or something or maybe it's not
7344840	7346840	I can't find it
7348840	7350840	inverted anime boobs meme
7352840	7354840	is that it
7354840	7356840	no
7356840	7358840	apparently inverted boobs
