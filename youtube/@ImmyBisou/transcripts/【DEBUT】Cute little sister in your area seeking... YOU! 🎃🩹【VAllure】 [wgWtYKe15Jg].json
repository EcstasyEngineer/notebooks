Not about being stinky, though. But it's my favorite stench. Sure, you're a general pervert to most women in town. You dress like you're homeless. You went to juvie twice before the age of 12. But they're all wrong about you. All of them. Every single cop, and priest, and guidance counselor, and medical professional, and fast food cashier. All the funny pranks we used to do are big big heists are knights together. Aw, I miss them. I know it's been a while since I last saw you. I'm sorry. You might not care, but mom and dad stopped talking about you for a while now. They act like you never existed. They smile a lot more now, as if they didn't see what I saw. So, I left them. I don't need them anyway. When I have you back, all we'll need is each other. And they don't even know I found your book, so they don't know that I can bring you back. I don't want to mess it up like, last time, and the time before that. But don't make fun of me. I was new at it, so I'm gonna be a big pro before I bring back my big bro. Oh, right. Last time we talked, you said someone was keeping you from coming back. Well, that's what I figured between all your screaming. You were probably a pro at this magical stuff, huh, big bro? Which means they must be real nasty to be able to keep you from coming back. I'm still starting out, so I make lots of mistakes. But I'm not scared. I've been practicing all over town. I'm leveling up so I can smash the final boss as soon as I see them. And then I'll find them, got them, bring you back, and then we can... Everything will be perfect. Yeah. I don't care who it is. A ghost? An angel? Or even the devil herself. You're gonna be back home again. And we can finally... I hope you can still hear me. No, I know you can. I know you'd do the same for me. So never think that I'll quit. I'll tear through Hell and Earth myself if I have to. I'll practice and practice and practice. And when I'm the perfect woman for you, I will take you home. Wait for me. I'll see you later, big bro. Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Blocked right into that Imperial ambush. Seems us. I wonder what you're doing. Hello? Oh my goodness! Hello, hello, hello, welcome! Did you enjoy Mercy's dream? And Azura's dream? And Icy's dream? It's nice to see you're still in one piece after Mercy, because, you know, after you're done with me, there won't be anything left of you big brother. Okay, okay, okay. \ufffd\uc2e4\ud31f, referenced and we can start the house tour okay here we are totally not in Minecraft this is real life let's let's let's make our way to to my house okay don't be scared you can hold my hand i know it's dark it's a little scary oh my god oh what is this is this a wanted poster for me and and it's so close to my cabin too what the heck okay well you know i guess i can i can use this to probably introduce myself to you so uh obviously you can you can see my name is emi bezu so my parents named me emi after the japanese word for imoto which means which means sister and bezu is the french word for kiss what a what a what a strange name they chose i wonder why they would choose that okay i'm i'm 140 centimeters tall oh by the way ignore the crimes part okay that's that's not that's that's made up okay uh okay so my hey i'm 140 centimeters tall but like i said before i'm still growing okay i'll i'll be as tall as a zura one day just just you wait and then my birthday is april 10th i hope you'll be able to make it to my birthday party when the time comes otherwise i might have to drag you there myself and my age is unknown yep i've officially beaten the 800 year old lolly allegations because i have no age okay okay okay i'm a human obviously uh my languages okay obviously you can tell that i'm you know fluent in english because i'm speaking english but i also speak a little bit of french let me let me let me let me let me show you my french draw me like one of your french girls okay are you going to finish that i'm kidding okay obviously i'm kidding so thank you for coming to my debut i know that my accent is not good okay i don't want to see it in the chat that my accent is terrible thank you okay moving on let's make our way to my house now so this is actually an an abandoned cabin that i that i found after running away from home and i spruced it up myself yep it's a little rundown and if you've seen any rats anywhere uh don't worry about don't worry about it they're nice so this first room here is my hobby room i got a lot of hobbies yep i consider myself to be a jack of all trades and a master of none except for baiting get it i'm a master at baiting okay let me let me bring your attention here to this desk so this is our whiteboard where i've written down our twitter.com tags yep our twitter tags um my oshi mark is a pumpkin and a bandaid a surprise uh my general my general hashtag is a hashtag oh whoa whoa whoa in me uh in all capital don't forget it thank you our meme hashtag is bizuwu our art hashtag is draw in me our nsfw hashtag is kimochimi if you if you know japanese it's like you know feeling good in me uh god i'm so bad at japanese okay our fan name is pin pals i stole that from online credit to the person who suggested pin pals online um but if you don't like any of these tags or even if you don't like the fan name i don't know we can change it in the 2.0 tomorrow it's up to you and over here is my writing station yeah i'm a writer that's right i'm a i'm a i'm a woman of many talents so i i like to write a little uh a few of my asmr scripts and i also just like to write for my own enjoyment yeah why don't we take a look at what i'm currently working on here oh my god i i i didn't know that was there that wasn't supposed to be there i don't want to see any screenshots of that okay i don't want to see any screenshots of that floating online i will find your ip address okay pretend you never saw that moving on so i'm an artist here's my little art station mm-hmm and uh here's the drawing i made i actually designed the the pin pals myself so this is this is the pin pals oh so cute how adorable right don't mind me gassing myself up okay let me let me show you my art skills right here right now let me let me show you okay let's play oops let's play a little a little game of charades is that how it goes you're gonna have to try to guess what i'm drawing okay okay here i go guess what i'm drawing oh what could it be what could it be did you guess yes that's right it's a dog guys you have such a dirty mind i would i would never draw that during debut oh my goodness okay so over here is my piano i'm i'm a little pianist i like to play piano so why don't i oh so why don't i show you a piano song i've been working on you can also try to guess the song i play it's a pretty popular song so i think you should recognize it are you ready here let me check to make sure that the audio is working can you hear that is that good okay ready so\u5c0f time did you guess, right? yah..I was \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0632 look at you, you are so smart O.K Let's move on to this next room. Up here, I have my rat room. That's right, I got four rats. I can already see the memes in chat. Rats, I was rats once. They left me in a room full of crazy. And crazy makes me rats. Okay, yeah, yeah, I have four rats. Now, obviously, I don't want to break your immersion here a little bit. But they don't look like this in real life. Okay, I know it's hard to tell, but we are in Minecraft right now. So you will see them for real in real life IRL during my hand cam streams. Yeah, I'm going to try to have them out during hand cam streams so you can formally meet them. Okay, so right across this beam here, I have my bedroom. I mean, the red paint on the floor. So I also have these plushies next to my bed, you know, the plushies I hold while I cry myself to sleep, the five nights up for these plushies. And over here is my little desk with my pewter. Yeah, this is my computer. This is literally where I am streaming from right now. This is where I tweet from. Okay, and here I have my steam library open. So, okay, I know some of you might feel a little scared right now looking at these games, you know, you see, oh fuck, Valorant, League of Legends. She's a loser, she's a loser version, what the fuck. No, I'm not a gamer, okay, your sister is not a gamer. So don't don't look at these games and be like, oh man, that's so disappointing. I will be playing that many games, but these are the games that I want to try eventually. Will I even get to all of them? I don't even know. I don't even know if I'll get to all of these because, like I said before, most of my streams will mostly be made up of me dicking around, like doing challenges, doing like DIY stuff, like handcams. Just, you'll see during my schedule, you'll see, I mostly just dick around. Okay, so here on this blackboard, I have my goals. Yep, I've written down my goals. So my first goal and the most important goal is to not give up. I'm a very fragile soul, okay, if you leave one hate comment, I'm fucking leaving, I'm ending stream. Okay, but for real, I give up on things super easily, I have a lot of abandoned hobby equipment in my room because I always give up on stuff. So yeah, I don't want to give up. Next, I want to experiment with lots of different types of content. So a lot of ASMR tropes, I want to try clip calculations, I want to try making memes, I even want to try singing, oh fuck. Okay, we'll move on, I'll come back to that. I want to do a 3D debut, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really excited for a 3D debut. I want to touch the other Violaire girls in 3D, I want to sniff their booties, I want to grope them, you know, basically everything you've ever wanted to do to them, I'll be able to do for you in VR. Fourth is I want to make you happy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my ultimate goal is to entertain you, you know, to make you laugh and to suck and fuck you. Okay, we're done here in my room, let me go down here, and let me go to my kitchen. Okay, I'm not a cook, if you ever do get cooking streams from me, it will be very scuffed, I have lit up a cake on fire, I've lit up a fish on fire, I'm really not a cook, but maybe I can show you my favorite food, you know, the kind of stuff I like to eat, maybe you can cook for me. Oh, I, okay, oops, so it looks like I forgot to go grocery shopping before this. Listen, some people might consider it an alcohol addiction, I am simply prioritizing my hydration, yeah, every time you tell me to drink during stream, just know I will be drinking vodka. And, oh, don't even worry about that one. Okay, here's my living room. Yup, this is my living room, this is where I do all my jorgen. Over here's my TV with a notflix open, and no other streaming service I use notflix. So, on the top row is my favorite shows and my favorite movies, and then on the bottom row is my favorite anime. So, my favorite shows, I really, really like kids' cartoons, like old kids' cartoons, so I like My Little Pony, I like Adventure Time, I like Gunball, I like Gravity Falls. I rewatch all those shows back to back constantly, and then my favorite movies are Pearl and Gone Girl. So, if you've ever watched those movies and you might think badly of me, or maybe you're afraid of me because I like those movies, good, you should be. Okay, moving on. So, my favorite anime is Freerun, Dungeon Messi, Psyche is a huge comfort anime of mine. Watamote, the main character is literally me, she is me. I really like Hellsman Castle and Maiden Abyss, and there's... Breaking Bad at the bottom. That wasn't even supposed to be there. Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry, would you look at that, my coffee table is such a mess, oh fuck. Oh, I picked up some pages on my coffee table, it looks like the rats must have been messing with my stuff because apparently they ripped up my diary. How rude of them. Well, I guess I can open up to you a little bit and show you my thoughts, my feelings. Oh, I wrote my first impressions here, okay. So, for Messi, she's very social, she knows a lot of people, like holy crap, and she's also very sweet. And her laugh is insane, when I first heard her laugh, I was like, god damn, holy crap, I got scared. Next is, I see she's god's ebius soldier, a lot of our meetings have been at night, and she's also effortlessly cute, like Oliver, like I heard her yawn once and I was like, god damn, I have to try to be cute, okay? All of this cuteness you see in front of you is like practiced, but I see it doesn't even have to fucking try. Strani is super super caring, and she's also a non-stop gamer, and yeah, I don't know how she plays games for so long, like, it couldn't be me, I'm jealous, I want to sit down and play for that long, but I can't. Next is, she's super funny, she's very hyper, you might not notice that she's hyper during her debut, but once you get to know her more, yeah. She's also very good at voice impressions, we were watching a stream together, and she copied the streamer's voice, and I was so surprised because I couldn't tell if it was she be talking or the streamer. And finally we have Azura, Azura is super super chill, she's also good at a lot of games, all the like community games we played together, she like, won all of them. And her voice is just pure sex, every word she says, she just moans it, I don't know how she does it. Alright, so before we end, let me turn the camera back onto myself, and I can show you my model, yup. Okay, are you ready? I'll show you some of my toggles, okay, okay, okay. So first I have this, you know, little shy arm pose, you know, when I'm feeling shy, oo-woo. I have these love eyes, POV, I'm standing above you while you're sleeping, and watching you sleep. Okay, I have an exclamation point, I have this one, we'll look past that one, that's for different streams, not for YouTube streams. I can cry, sadge, I can be stupid, I mean I'm always stupid, but I can look stupid too. I can drool, I bet you want to lick that off of my mouth, don't you? I can blush, I can be angry, you don't want to get on my bad side, I'll punish you. I can be scared, and double scared, and also sweaty, I bet you want to lick my sweat too, I've been reading your comments, I know. I can sleep, look at you, watching me sleep. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I can take off my jacket, there it is, and you know what else I can take off? You're never going to guess, are you ready for this? What could it be, could it be my shorts, could it be my shirt, could it be, could it be, oh it's my shoes. I can take my shoes off, and I can stomp on you. Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, okay. Oh, I think I missed one toggle. Is it this one? There we go, I can cast spells. Shadow, what is it, Shadow, Wizard Money Gang. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough glooping around, let's go to my schedule, here is my schedule for next week. Yeah, so tomorrow we have a debut, but don't forget about me just yet because I'll see you at the collab stream after this, okay? And then Monday we have an ASMR stream, Tuesday I will be showing you my favorite TikToks, it's basically like a meme review except you're the one that's reviewing the memes and I'm the one showing you the memes. And then Poppy Playtime, and then another ASMR stream, and then I, listen, I didn't make the schedule, I don't know who wrote my life story, I've never played the coffin of Andy and Lay Lay before, but apparently it pertains to me somehow. And then after that we're gonna be making Pop and Cookin', which is like a, it's like a DIY candy, and then after that I'm gonna try to guess characters without my glasses because fun fact I'm actually incredibly blind. Well because I'm like video game characters and stuff. Alright, now. I want you to come buckets right now. What, did you hear that? Fucking pull out your cock. What, what is that? I want you to come buckets right now. That voice sounds familiar, doesn't it? I think it sounds like a bunny, and I think she's trying to lead us down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. Maybe, maybe you should follow her, follow her voice, yeah. And I'll see you again in the collab stream, okay? Goodbye.
