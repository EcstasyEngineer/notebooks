0	1840	Could you survive living in France?
1840	4160	Probably not, let's be honest, no foreigner could.
4160	5680	They're unhinged over there.
5680	8080	But let's test your French knowledge anyways.
8080	9120	What is dobe?
9920	11120	It means to stink.
11120	13040	Come on, you should be familiar with that one.
14160	15600	How about le toad à la naix?
16480	17920	It means piece of cake.
17920	19920	But if you were to directly translate it,
19920	21600	it means to put your finger up your nose.
21600	24000	I don't know how they got piece of cake from that.
24000	26560	And finally, what is lâcher une caisse?
26560	27360	It means to fart.
28160	29760	And now you're a real Frenchie.
29760	30800	Good luck out there.
30800	32880	And don't be scared, they can smell your fear.
