there we go oh there's another buddy toy here oh my god I have a story about this okay can I bring

17:01.440 --> 17:09.080
this with me no when I was in kindergarten I used to they used to have dinosaur toys in

17:09.080 --> 17:15.320
kindergarten and my favorite dinosaur toy was the long neck dinosaur toy and I played with it

17:15.320 --> 17:21.800
all the time and that was the only dinosaur toy I played with and anytime you know any other kid

17:21.800 --> 17:30.840
wanted the long neck one I wouldn't let them have it because it was my toy and then this one kid

17:30.840 --> 17:35.400
wanted the long neck dinosaur toy but I didn't want to give it to him because it was my freaking

17:35.400 --> 17:39.840
toy and so he didn't even want it because he wanted to play with it he just wanted it because

17:39.840 --> 17:51.600
he knew I liked it have to you in the inventory oh okay he just wanted it because I liked it and he

17:51.600 --> 18:00.320
wanted to like you know take it from me and so when I told him no he was like Amy's a bully he

18:00.320 --> 18:10.760
started teasing me and he made a whole song of it buttons are there other buttons other than E

18:10.760 --> 18:20.600
he made a whole song with lyrics about how I was a bully and he would sing it to me oh wait press

18:20.600 --> 18:39.240
here okay puppy oh wait you're not puppy what's your name what's his name again um I forgot his

18:39.240 --> 18:47.800
name was it catchy no right how dare they bully me huggy wuggy huggy wuggy yeah there you go huggy

18:48.000 --> 18:59.280
look at me I'm right at the perfect height for him okay um then we come from there I feel like I

18:59.280 --> 19:03.560
should have done I mean I guess I got a key from this room right maybe I shouldn't have made it maybe

19:03.560 --> 19:11.680
there's nothing more to do here for the next place is there another place wait there was a door

19:11.680 --> 19:19.960
that was locked wasn't there you have to have to fucking do this again okay I did it I'm doing so

19:19.960 --> 19:30.680
well compared to other times how do I run okay this door I wish I was as tall as Hucky you

19:30.680 --> 19:36.240
don't even need to be as tall as Hucky don't worry I'm short enough or you don't need to be as tall

19:36.640 --> 19:41.880
um I'm guessing I have to put a cassette in there oh look at all the drawings on him oh

19:41.880 --> 19:53.760
so good what is that I need to find a cassette in here don't they more bloody toys more drawings

19:53.760 --> 20:07.320
my best friend oh my god literally me and my long neck dinosaur toy oh thank you mr. Ludwig wait is

20:07.320 --> 20:13.920
that a reference to the actual streamer wait you didn't have to swing again there was a ramp oh yeah

20:13.920 --> 20:21.640
you're right I could have just felt fell down if you're as tall as huggy the NBA would be the most

20:21.680 --> 20:32.040
realistic true what does this one say for Elliott Ludwig wait I don't think it's actually the

20:32.040 --> 20:46.080
streamer Ludwig is it it's probably a character I can't read that hey we made toys like this in

20:46.080 --> 20:52.560
the first chapter okay give me the freaking cassette oh there's a note here no give me the

20:52.560 --> 21:02.440
give me the cassette next next give me the cassette huh I'm not the cassette fuck give me the note

21:02.440 --> 21:28.880
help me only chance experiment 814 notes this experiment utilized a live rat rat was fed

21:28.880 --> 21:35.480
three portions daily for two weeks at the end of the two weeks the rat was killed are you fucking

21:35.480 --> 21:40.280
kidding me they knew I was playing this game they wanted to torture me into a poppy flower and

21:40.280 --> 21:47.360
preserve preservative gel mixture one week later an electric shock was applied to the rat

21:47.360 --> 21:55.960
still in the gel and attempt to revive it the rat remained unresponsive of course it fucking

21:55.960 --> 22:03.000
remained unresponsive you should have been it should have been me not the rat it should

22:03.000 --> 22:12.640
have been me just take me don't take the rat analysis I still believe in the potential of

22:12.640 --> 22:18.640
the poppy flower its unusual properties lead me to believe that the proper mixture and procedure

22:18.640 --> 22:25.120
could have life-altering properties the poppy flower has for a long time carried heavy symbolism

22:25.120 --> 22:31.120
and I don't believe that's for bro this guy's got terrible grammar and I don't believe that's

22:31.120 --> 22:41.440
for no reason perhaps something larger than a rat would yield different results yeah I don't

22:41.440 --> 22:53.920
think so let's watch this play can I zoom in somehow I feel like I'm too sure is the product

22:53.920 --> 23:00.880
of a great man by the name of Elliot Ludwig divorced but a family man his site will always

23:00.880 --> 23:07.600
set on bringing amazing toys to amazing children around the globe Ludwig spent countless hours

23:07.600 --> 23:13.800
in the factory working overtime relentlessly in an attempt to continuously innovate and surprise

23:13.800 --> 23:21.800
in the 1960s an unfortunate family death had pushed Ludwig down to his lowest but with so

23:21.800 --> 23:26.880
much ambition he rose back up and continued to fulfill his vision for the playtime code

23:26.880 --> 23:32.080
why do they censor his face Ludwig could never be content leaving a project unfinished but

23:32.080 --> 23:37.680
just how did one man come to create such an astounding empire how did he manage to stay

23:37.680 --> 23:45.000
determined even after suffering such a tragic loss it all began in the fateful year of 19

23:46.000 --> 23:56.280
oh I guess that's all okay okay not the streamer Ludwig can we get up here I feel

23:56.280 --> 24:07.400
like this is someplace I should look into okay maybe not he's probably disfigured oh you think

24:07.400 --> 24:16.160
something happened to him when does William Afton come in wrong game wrong game I'm William Afton

24:16.160 --> 24:31.080
maybe oh wait am I supposed to go in there no I'm not right I remember watching Markiplier

24:31.080 --> 24:36.600
play chapter 2 and he streamed it and he refused to look at chat to help him and he got stuck for

24:36.600 --> 24:41.720
like two fucking hours in one part of the game because he's too fucking stupid to like even I

24:41.720 --> 24:46.520
knew what to do and I'm really stupid and I don't want that to happen to you guys I don't want

24:46.520 --> 24:51.720

29:44.700 --> 29:50.940
embarrassing someone someone sent me a marshmallow asking if I have this calculus I don't think I do

29:50.940 --> 29:59.220
I don't think I do I've I used to be able to do math really good it's just I've always been bad with

29:59.220 --> 30:04.660
simple numbers well I've just always been bad with numbers in general but like I'm still able to do

30:04.660 --> 30:14.740
it I just can't like I don't know it's it's like I don't know how to explain it I'm like you like

30:14.740 --> 30:28.380

30:28.380 --> 30:38.300
worry I'll save you was I not supposed to jump a lot of people die a couple times on that big gap

30:38.300 --> 30:45.180
you went over what gap yeah exactly that's what calculators are for that's why I took out a calculator

30:45.180 --> 30:56.700

of course we will thank you no one left behind yeah you always have a calculator in real life

31:33.340 --> 31:39.020
that's what I'm saying I never understood why they didn't let us have like when I was in elementary

31:39.020 --> 31:44.580
school they didn't let us have calculators during tests but then as soon as I got into high school

31:44.980 --> 31:49.780
they always let us have a calculator like oh fuck they always let us have a calculator

31:49.780 --> 31:52.900
and I was so confused why we weren't allowed to have them

welcome to musical memory Jesus Christ the sound in this game is so

54:01.860 --> 54:02.900
fucking badly

54:05.300 --> 54:11.300
memory and cognitive recognition test is designed to stimulate several segments of the brain

54:11.300 --> 54:15.300
allowing us to see how quickly and efficiently your brain works

54:20.420 --> 54:25.380
like I put the sound so low and it's still so loud why is the sound like that is there

54:25.380 --> 54:34.500
another sound option why does it do that memory time this isn't gonna go out

54:34.500 --> 54:40.580
a sequence of colors will be shown and you must recreate the exact sequence using the buttons

54:40.580 --> 54:47.940
around you uh-huh bunzo will slowly lower towards you when you complete a color pattern correctly

54:48.020 --> 54:55.300
bunzo will rise back up when you input a pattern incorrectly bunzo will lower towards you faster

54:55.940 --> 55:03.860
if bunzo reaches you your test is over the test will become more difficult as it continues

55:03.860 --> 55:11.540
with longer patterns in quicker succession that's all good luck okay

55:18.340 --> 55:26.740
isn't it amazing mommy hasn't seen the place I've been running in years mommy can only imagine

55:26.740 --> 55:33.940

59:24.820 --> 59:30.820
Oh, come on.

59:30.820 --> 59:34.820
Come on!

59:34.820 --> 59:41.820
Fuck me.

59:41.820 --> 59:43.820
Olive brown.

59:43.820 --> 59:53.820
That's no fun.

59:53.820 --> 59:57.820
Oh, there you are.

59:57.820 --> 01:00:08.820
Thank you, mommy.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.820
Thank you.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:22.820
You praised me too much, I don't deserve it.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.820
You're too nice.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.820
Okay.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.820
We did good, that was really scary.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:37.820
That had me really, oh, oh, oh, okay.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.820
I knew you could do it.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:46.820
I'm not used to this much racing, oh my god.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.820
This way?

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:53.820
Let me in!

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.820
I expected you to fail, are you serious?

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:05.820
No, actually, never mind, you don't praise me enough, keep praising me, come on.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.820
I believed in you, thank you.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.820
That's what I want to hear, expected me to fail.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.820
I never fail.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.820
I don't fail at anything ever.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:21.820
I love you and me, I love you too.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:27.820
Oh, am I just supposed to jump down?

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:35.820
Um, okay.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:39.820
I knew you could do it.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:44.820
Stop you're making me fucking laugh like a fucking mouse, it's so annoying.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.820
Okay, what do I do here?

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:52.820
Oh, there's a long neck toy, and it's covered in wood.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.820
Rejected item, orange robot toy, reasons for rejection.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:01.820
After considering both options, management has decided to go with mommy long legs as playtime-coast stretch toy concept.

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.820
I like him personally.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.820
Orange robot toy.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.820
Ah!

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:15.820
I'm guessing there's something, did you notice, did you all notice the scream of Bunzo's death?

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:23.820
No, he died?

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:33.820
I can't handle all these praises and compliments, it's- it's, it's- I can't- I can't focus.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.820
Oh god, that's terrifying.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:44.820
Oh! Oh, um, oh, lever.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:49.820
I'm guessing I'm supposed to power something here.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:54.820
What am I supposed to power?

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:09.820
You weren't scared during any of that last mini-game, but got spooked by random collisions on the ground.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:14.820
Well, because I was, you know, I was expecting it to be scary. It was the scary part of the game.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.820
So obviously, you know, I'm locked in.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:23.820
What am I supposed to do with this?

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:29.820
Stop praising me and help me with the game!

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:34.820
Oh.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:39.820
Oh, look, there's a huggy.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.820
Get the crane to get the collectible.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:50.820
The crane.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:55.820
The crane. There was a crane around here. You're right, there was a crane.

01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:00.820
Of course it's unexpected scares that get me.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:05.820
Where is, oh here, the crane. So do I power the crane?

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:10.820
With this hand?

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.820
Is there like a button to power? Oh, there's another rejected one.

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.820
Kick me, Paul. Nobody likes it.

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:24.820
Laughed out of presentation.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:29.820
He's just like me. I never told you. I want to tell you this story because it's really funny.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:33.820
Okay.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:38.820
Raise equals awkward in me.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.820
The claw. Pull the crane over top of large objects to pick them up.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:48.820
Oh.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:53.820
Oh, this one. Pick this one up.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:58.820
Pick it up. Do your job.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:03.820
Pick it up. Oh, I have to, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.820
I have to, I have to, um, the, the, the electrocute, right?

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.820
Okay, let me tell you the story.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:18.820
So when I was like in seventh grade, maybe I used to play this very,

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:23.820
I used to play this very role-playing game. It was called, um,

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:29.820
it was called Feral Heart. If anyone, if, if anyone knows that game,

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:35.820
I'm going to be super fucking surprised. It was not a popular game, but okay, pick it up.

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:42.820
Pick it up. And, um, I used to role-play in that like all the time.

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:47.820
Give it to me now. Give it to me.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:52.820
Oh, suck my, huh?

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.820
Was I supposed to move it so that it fell underneath me?

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:10.820
No, it was, um, it was a very role-playing game, but you could only be a wolf or a lion,

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:15.820
and I was usually role-playing as a wolf. You can make your own wolf or lion character.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:20.820
When I, you could like customize the lion to look like a cat more,

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:29.820
and a lot of people did that so that way they could, so that way they could play as, um, please fall.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.820
Okay, thank you. A lot of people did that so they could play as warrior cats,

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.820
and I played a little bit as warrior cats too.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:44.820
Um, like I would make my own warrior cats, I see, and then I would role-play as one,

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:49.820
but that's not the point of the story. The point of the story is to tell you there was this one,

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:57.820
there was this one part of the map where people would do something called like the mating circle.

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.820
It doesn't, it doesn't sound like what you think it is, okay?

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.820
Oh, there's another rejected one. Hold on.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:13.820
Serpup's a lot. Extremely negative reception from various focus groups.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.820
Whoever's idea this was should feel ashamed.

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:26.820
So there was this one part of the map where they would do some activity, some event, I guess,

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.820
called the mating circle.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.820
Now the mating circle, what happens in the mating circle is not a gang bang, right?

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:40.820
It's not a gang bang. What happens is, you know, everyone kind of gets in a circle,

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:50.820
and there's like, um, there's like a, um, there's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, right?

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.820
Work!

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.820
What?

01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.820
It's not an orgy! I know it sounds like one.

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:05.820
There's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, and what they do, what they would do is they would, um...

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.820
Is there another sign?

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.820
A scientific?

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.820
A scientific sign.

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:35.820
Is they would call your name, like your username, and you would walk to the middle of the circle and sit next to them, right?

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:43.820
And then, basically how it worked is anyone, any other wolf that was interested in you and wanted to be your mate

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:55.580
be their mate in between a ladder where junk is piled and um or if like multiple people went

01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:00.700
into the circle with you then you could choose like which one you wanted to be your mate or you

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:05.500
could reject them both so the point of this story is to tell you that anytime it was my turn I would

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:11.980
sit in these circles for hours by the way absolute hours to wait until it was my turn to see if I

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:19.100
to see if I could catch a mate in this free role playing game and every single fucking time it was

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:28.380
my turn no one ever went into the circle to be my mate I only ever got one mate

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:35.340
and I don't remember how it happened I think it was just some I think it was a girl I think it was

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:41.740
a girl she just came up to me she was like wow she had like a male character and she was like wow

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:48.860
you're so you're so pretty and I was like oh is this my chance to get to get a mate finally

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:57.260
and then um we like role played for a little bit together and then she left me like I added her

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.860
as a friend on that account and I found her because you can have different characters on the same

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:07.180
account and I found her later again by accident because she never came to me or found me or talked

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:12.300
to me ever again I just found her by by accident and it was a girl like character and I was like oh

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:18.780
my god I've been fucking bamboozled I've been bamboozled I actually didn't find a mate

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:29.260
that's okay to me that's why you have big brother you're gonna heal my trauma from being rejected

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:37.660
in the furry role play game okay now actually help me I'm I'm done I'm done with my my traumatic

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:41.420

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:44.300
well it finally happened after years of being ignored the company actually heard all my complaints

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:52.060
yep they listened to them very carefully I guess my words must have really inspired me to take action

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:59.900
because the next day I got demoted down to the great island of mr. toy

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.020
why do I talk to myself

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:14.460

Welcome to Wac-a-woogie.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:45.560
This advanced test is designed to assess the extent of your reactionary abilities.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:49.640
A dual-palm grab pack will be provided to you for this test

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.120
Around you are 18

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.960
An adorable huggy look toy could appear out of any one of these holes

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.900
I'm gonna suck on one of those one comes out hit it with your grab pack

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.040
That's all good luck, okay

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320
I

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.160
Yeah, cough drop that's what it's called

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.240
Wait both hands no, just one right? I was inch I

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000

There's no none of them are out. Oh fuck. Oh, okay

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.040
Where is it?

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.360
Where is it? I didn't see any

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.240
Well, oh

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Oh, it's really hard to see oh

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.800
My god, that's so scary

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.800
Okay, they're pretty slow

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:06.720
Why is the audio quiet it's quiet for me too

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.720
Is

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.680
It's supposed to be this quiet probably like to make it harder, right?

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.840
Shit, I don't see any more where are they

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:43.400
Stop stop. Oh my god, stop, please stop. This is scary. I don't like it

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.240
Where is it? Oh my god. Oh my god. Stop. Stop

01:27:52.720 --> 01:28:03.120
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, there's so many

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.040
Why do I feel like I'm failing? Why do I feel like I'm doing really bad at this game?

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.760
Come on get out of my fucking holes

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.240
Oh

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.520
That was really scary

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:48.240
Wait, wait, wait, no, I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready to call again. I'm not ready. I need to take a break

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.720
Wait, maybe I should turn my sound up so I can hear them better. Was I close?

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.240
Was I close to being done?

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.680
You're tears are my nourishment

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:13.000
You're only using one hand it will be slow once the pace picks up use both hands to hit faster

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.560
Okay, let me

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.960
Let me try putting those sound up more. Maybe

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.880
Maybe that would help

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.000
I feel like the sounds in this game used to have strings attached to them

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:35.760
So they could be pulled back when they got too close to the children

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.200
Have fun

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.240
I

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.520
Should I

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:10.000
You can only do so much with money brightness is already up in the game is to start that's what I'm saying

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.240
I

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.920
Don't see any I don't see any should I put

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.640
Where is it it's coming from everywhere around me

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.240
I

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:12.480
Where is it I can't the sound is so confusing die

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.040
Oh

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.360
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Stop?

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.480
I'm crying

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.880
I

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.920
Jump off jump off that edge come over here

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:36.400
Wait, I want to see if putting my brightness lower might help because maybe maybe it's too light

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.760
Um, that's a bad idea

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:57.360
Don't cry I'm going to try to ignore this time. I just keep slowly looking around. Okay

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.560
I feel like the sound helps me see where it's coming from though

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.560
Oh

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.800
The gamma

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.800
That's not a thing here

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.080
There's no gamma is it vignette?

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.240
Don't stay in the middle if that doesn't help you

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.800
Okay

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.280
Camera is brightness remove bloom, okay

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.320
Sound can't help you it helps you

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.680
Sound can't help you see it helps you hear

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:52.240
I know but it helps it feel like I feel like it helps me tell which direction it's coming from if I can hear like

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.200
Which direction it is

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.240
So

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.240
So

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.200
I feel like I'm fucking hallucinating now

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.040
Like I feel like I'm genuinely hallucinating some of them

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.840
Like for real

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.120
Get away from me stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.120
I don't think I'm gonna pass this one

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.120
I

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.560
I don't think I can pass it

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:11.520
Phone a friend who the fuck am I gonna call should I get into the freaking vc

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.760

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.920
Fuck you, Mommy!

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.920
Give me, give me!

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.920
Playtime Coltrane Access Instructions.

What's the rest of this stuff?

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:00.920
What's this for?

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920
Did we ever use this?

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.920
This is part two.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.920
Are we collecting this whole page?

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.920
Is this part one?

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.920
Mommy, one game left to play.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:14.920
Sad.

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.920
Mommy was hoping you'd stay here forever.

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.920
Though, it's never too late to change your mind.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.920
I don't care about you anymore.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.920
I don't want to be with you anymore.

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:31.920
Leave me alone, Mommy.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.920
You're not hot anymore.

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:34.920
I don't care.

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:35.920
I don't care what your voice sounds like.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.920
I don't like it.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:41.920
I wish Amy would scream at me like that.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.920
If you frustrate me this much, I might do it.

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.920
Oh, fuck.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.920
What do I do here?

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.920
I don't think I can jump back, can I?

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.920
Collectible here.

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.920
Collectible.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:22.920
Look up.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.920
Up there?

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.920
Do I have to go higher?

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.920
Oh.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:54.920
Am I allowed to say that I'm going to KYKMSonYouTube.com?

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.920
Is that allowed?

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.920
How do I do this?

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.920
Okay.

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:07.920
No?

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:18.920
Die.

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.920
Only in Minecraft?

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:39.920
You'll make me sad if you say that.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:43.920
Okay, I'm only going to do it in Minecraft.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.920
Well, I guess I have to enter then.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920
Move!

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.920
Can you make me proud if you say that?

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.920
Well, which one is it?

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.920
Can I say it or not?

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:18.920
Uh-oh.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.920
Uh-oh, was I supposed to go down there?

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.920
Wait, no, I feel like...

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.920
Rep collectible?

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.920
Too late.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.920
Oops.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.920
Okay.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:34.920
I never mean it.

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.920
No, I would never mean it.

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:37.920
No.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:39.920
YouTube, don't worry.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.920
I don't actually mean it.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:43.920
Oh, who's that?

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:44.920
Oh, it's...

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:45.920
Is that Huggy Wuggy?

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.920
Oh, I missed you.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.920
That's not Huggy Wuggy.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:57.920
Do it.

01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.920
Pull it.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.920
Yes.

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.920
Yes.

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.920
Oh, fuck off!

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.920
Is she nice?

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.920
Oh, she is nice.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:13.920
Well, how nice of her.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:16.920
Okay, hold on.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920
Let me put the sounds back down now.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:21.920
Because now they're too loud.

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920
Okay.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:25.920
She's on our side?

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:27.920
That's good.

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:29.920
What is this?

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:31.920
Oh, it's so light.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.920
I wish I had Optifine so I could zoom in like in Minecraft.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.920
She's teasing me?

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:51.920
I know.

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.920
I could tell.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920
Uh-oh.

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.920
Is my arm going to get stuck there?

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:01.920
Okay.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:05.920
Huh?

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:06.920
In here?

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:09.920
What a nice girl.

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.920
She's so nice.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.920
She's the only one that's been nice to me this whole time.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.920
Other than you two, I guess.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.920
What am I supposed to do up here?

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.920
Galvanized square steel?

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.920
Drop.

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.920
Do I just go up here?

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920
No.

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:49.920
So don't blame me if you don't wish to take the route if you know what I mean.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.920
Um.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920
I don't know.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920
Should I?

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.920
Should I try?

01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.920
Should I try?

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:04.920
What am I doing wrong?

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:07.920
Oh.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:10.920
Oh, okay.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.920
Was I supposed to take that with me?

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:17.920
Oh!

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:18.920
Yee!

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920
I'm so surprised I didn't even need help for that one.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:22.920
Okay.

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.920
And then I guess we just keep doing that, right?

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:25.920
Come closer.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.920
You have to cross all the steel doors fast.

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:33.920
Got it, got it, got it.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.920
Where do I get the...

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920
Wait.

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.920
Wait.

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.920
Oh, do I just get it from the same place?

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.920
Okay.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.920
Okay.

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:49.920
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920
Give it back!

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.920
No!

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.920
Give it back!

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:55.920
Wait.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:57.920
Okay.

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:01.920
Okay.

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:03.920
Okay.

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:05.920
Okay.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.920
Hello, sisters of genius.

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.920
Oh, I can just push it.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:17.920
I am a genius.

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:18.920
I'm so smart for making it...

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.920
Heart corridor.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.920
I'm so smart for making it all the way here.

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920
All by myself with no help at all.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.920
Okay.

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:37.920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:38.920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920
Oh, not at all, sir.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.920
That's what I'd like to hear.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.920
So, Marcus,

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920
what happened?

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:47.920
You see,

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.920
I was in home for the day,

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:50.920
when my grandparents realized

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.920
that if we bloody wallowed in the cafeteria again...

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.920
His accent is so funny.

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.920
And that's when I see it.

01:46:58.920 --> 01:46:59.920
Jacksepticeye.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.920
Jacksepticeye.

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.920
So, what did you do?

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:03.920
Where is that from again?

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:04.920
I forgot.

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:05.920
When I just thought I'd nab the bloody york

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:06.920
and be on me merry way.

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:08.920
Double the mornin', do ya?

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:09.920
Well, laddies.

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:10.920
I'm reaching for the thing.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.920
And the mob handled Jolton at all.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.920
Had me scared stiff.

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.920
I thought I was the only one there.

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920
So,

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.920
I took a peek beneath the gate,

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.920
and some massive bloody thing

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.920
was duthering about the bloody hallway.

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:26.920
Thing?

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.920
You're sure it wasn't a person?

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:29.920
Clearly, and we can skip school

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.920
and take care of her 3k birthday.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:35.920
Of course, yeah.

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:36.920
I don't need school anymore.

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:38.920
I'm obviously smart enough

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.920
to just graduate right now.

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.920
I haven't a bloody nausea murder-wise,

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:42.920
but I wasn't human.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:45.920
It wasn't human.

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.920
Besides me, obviously.

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.920
Is it bad that I can't tell the difference

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.920
between a Scottish and an Irish accent?

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.920
I didn't know that Strowney was Scottish.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.920
Had a Scottish accent.

01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.920
I thought she had an Irish one,

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:01.920
because they sound the same to me.

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:04.920
Don't tell her I said that.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.920
Poor Jacks, but they see.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:21.920
Is that it?

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.920
Oh, how am I supposed to get there?

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.920
I can't tell between Strowney and fruit,

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:33.920
and one is from Scotland,

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.920
and the other is from North England.

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:37.920
I feel like I'd be able to tell

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:38.920
between Strowney and fruit.

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:39.920
That's easy.

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:45.920
No, don't tell Strowney I thought she had an Irish.

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.920
Don't tell her I said that.

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.920
Do I?

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:54.920
I have no...

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.920
Get one charge.

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.920
Open gate.

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.920
Get other charge.

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:04.920
Place it at the end.

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:05.920
Grab the other charge.

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.920
Okay, you're putting too much trust in me there.

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:15.920
Where is the charge?

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.920
Charge?

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:19.920
What did that do?

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:23.920
What did that do?

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:24.920
What did that do?

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:25.920
What did that do?

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:26.920
What did it do?

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:27.920
What did that do?

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.920
Do I need to get all of them?

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.920
But it won't last long enough.

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.920
Just don't tell her you thought she was English.

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.920
No, I knew she was in British,

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.920
like British, British, like,

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:46.920
like, like, hello, mate.

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.920
Good luck.

01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:58.920
This one?

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920
Let's fucking go.

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920
I didn't think I'd be able to do that.

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.920
I was so confused when you said it in chat.

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.920
I was like, what the fuck do you mean

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.920
get one charge and get the other charge?

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.920
How many charges are we catching here?

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.920
We're gonna get so many charges we'll end up in jail.

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:23.920
Okay, go.

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:25.920
Go, break it.

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:26.920
Break it for me.

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:27.920
Yeah.

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.920
Say bye to Barry now?

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.920
Do you mean Jacksepticeye?

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.920
I can't say Jacksepticeye.

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:38.920
No.

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.920
Well, it was a sacrifice I am willing to make.

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:44.920
Oh, okay.

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:45.920
Wait a minute.

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:47.920
Wait a minute.

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:48.920
I recognize this place.

01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.920
Isn't mommy gonna come up from there?

01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.920
No, maybe not.

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:55.920
Okay, never.

01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.920
I just recognize it because we've been in here before.

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:58.920
Okay.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:01.920
We did it.

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:02.920
Did we do it?

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.920
Oh, the card's name is Barry.

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.920
Oh, Barry the card.

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:11.920
Oh, Barry the card.

01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.920
Oh, Barry the card.

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:14.920
Oh.

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:20.920
That was whack-a-wacky.

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.920
Oh, I did it.

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.920
I fucking did it.

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.920
I hope you had a fun day at the game station.

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.920
No, I didn't.

01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.920
I'll start you the last one.

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.920
Thank you for all the pets.

01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.920
All the pets.

01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:59.920
Did you know that pet in French means fart?

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.920
Which way do I pull it?

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:04.920
Which way does it go?

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:07.920
Open.

01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:15.920
Go to the middle of the train station.

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:20.920
The train station.

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.920
And look up.

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:28.920
This?

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:30.920
Oh, yippee.

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:32.920
Yay, thank you for the collectible.

01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:34.920
Okay, now how do I open this?

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.920
Why is it beeping?

01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:49.920
What a funny language.

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.920
So when you sharded, you petted yourself?

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.920
No.

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:53.920
Sharded out?

01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:55.920
Is there a word for sharded in French?

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:57.920
We didn't learn that in class.

01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:59.920
They didn't teach us, like,

01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:01.920
I think someone asked for like,

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.920
18 plus French like ASMR,

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.920
but it's like, do you think

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.920
they teach us how to dirty talking French?

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:10.920
Of course, I don't know how to dirty talking French.

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.920
I don't even know how to say cock in French.

01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:20.920
Close.

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.920
Close it.

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.920
Come on, we're trying to be safe.

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.920
All the safety regulations.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.920
I'm going to fall off the train if I don't close it.

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:29.920
Oh, wait.

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.920
I don't know how to say cock in French.

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.920
I don't know how to say cock in French.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.920
I don't know how to say cock in French.

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.920
Oh, wait.

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:43.920
Isn't that all French is?

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:45.920
Just dirty talking?

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.920
The teacher has failed me.

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:53.920
Louie nerd.

01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:57.920
Won't be teacher fat, aw.

01:53:58.920 --> 01:53:59.920
Bracket.

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.920
There's many ways to say cock in French.

01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:06.920
Louie nerd.

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:07.920
La baguette.

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.920
Or maybe even le cock

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.920
if you're feeling spicy.

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:17.920
What about a stream learning to do it?

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:20.920
Who's going to teach me?

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.920
There's no website that teaches you how to dirty talking French.

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:23.920
Is there?

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:27.920
They're always talking dirty.

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:29.920
Okay, okay, train code.

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920
Okay.

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.920
This thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:33.920
Okay.

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.920
Okay.

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.920
This thing.

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.920
Google translate?

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:45.920
That sounds like a bad idea.

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:46.920
Oh.

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:51.920
Oh, no.

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:52.920
Are you doing something wrong?

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.920
You're not done.

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.920
Oh.

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.920
Collab with someone who speaks French?

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:57.920
Mmm.

01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.920
Wait.

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:02.920
I think one of the people who did a watch along with us speaks French, right?

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:04.920
Is it para something?

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:06.920
Is she like native French?

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:10.920
Do the code.

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:11.920
Do the code.

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.920
Do the code.

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:13.920
Do the code.

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.920
Do the code.

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:15.920
Do the code.

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:16.920
Do the code.

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:17.920
Do the code.

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:18.920
Do the code.

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.920
Do the code.

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.920
It's too early for the train.

01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:25.920
Well, how do I get down here now?

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.920
Because isn't this the next game?

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:29.920
Paras...

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:30.920
Is it Parasite?

01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:31.920
Parasite?

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:35.920
Yeah, maybe we can do a collab with her and she can teach me how to speak French.

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:37.920
She can teach me how to dirty talking French.

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:39.920
Why won't this open?

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:42.920
Stand to the right of the door and pull.

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:51.920
Is it opening?

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.920
She didn't understand you when you spoke French on stream?

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.920
Oh, bruh, really?

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:00.920
Damn.

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.920
Well, I speak like very, um...

01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:09.920
I don't, like I speak very English French, like...

01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.920
The kind of French I speak is like,

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:17.920
it's like the French of kids who just went to French school all their life,

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.920
like haven't ever been to Quebec or France or anything, you know?

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:21.920
Like...

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:25.920
She'd be happy to do that?

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.920
Oh my god, maybe I should reach out to her.

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:32.920
Oh, okay, where does this go?

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:33.920
Oh, there.

01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.920
Well, now that's distracted me.

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:51.920
If Ella's Canadian French and she's real French, she won't understand it.

01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:52.920
Well, no, my...

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:55.920
It should still be understandable, though.

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.920
It's just not a good accent.

01:56:58.920 --> 01:56:59.920
That's all.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.920
Like, it's still completely understandable.

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:04.920
Otherwise, all of my teachers wouldn't be able to understand me,

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:09.920
because I had, like, actual French teachers.

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:11.920
Oh, come on.

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:19.920
Down here?

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:24.920
Puzzle time, y'all.

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.920
Gotta use my brain again.

01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:28.920
Unfortunately.

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:30.920
Now what?

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:32.920
Wait, now what?

01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.920
Did I use the wrong hand?

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.920
Think?

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.920
Okay, I used the wrong hand.

01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.920
Okay.

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:46.920
I got this.

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.920
Okay.

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:49.920
Fuck!

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:09.920
I'm gonna fucking kill myself in Minecraft!

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:13.920
Okay.

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:17.920
Oh, okay.

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:25.920
Please!

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:32.920
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:44.920
Did I do it?

01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:52.920
I did it, right?

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.920
Okay.

01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.920
No.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.920
We're alone.

01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.920
Hm?

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.920
Hm?

01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.920
Hm?

01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.920
Hm?

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920
Hm?

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:01.920
Hm?

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:02.920
Hm?

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:03.920
Hm?

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:04.920
Hm?

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:05.920
Hm?

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.920
Hm?

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:07.920
Hm?

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:08.920
Hm?

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.920
Hm?

01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:10.920
Hm?

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:11.920
Hm?

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:13.920
Hm?

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:14.920
Mm-mm.

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:17.420
Oh my god, I'm playing-

01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:18.420
Ah!

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:18.920
Ah!

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.920
Ah!

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:20.920
Ah!

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:21.920
Ah!

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:22.920
Ah!

01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:23.920
Ah!

01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:24.920
Ahh!

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:25.920
Ah!

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:26.920
Ahh!

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:27.920
Ahh!

01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:28.920
Ahh!

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:29.920
Welcome to Statues.

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.920
Hi.

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:32.920
This advanced obstacle course is designed to test your physical endurance and strength.

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.920
The rules are simple.

01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.920
The lights will turn off.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:40.920
You can move through the obstacle course at this time.

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:47.880
However, when the lights turn on, you can look around but cannot move.

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:52.240
You may move again once the lights turn back off.

01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:55.640
The lovable PJ Pugga-pillar will follow you.

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.960
If PJ reaches you, your test is over.

01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:02.960
Oh my god, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.960
Good luck.

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:09.960
Wait, I'm not ready, I'm not ready.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Come on, I need to take a break.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I need to take a quick break.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I need to take a break.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I'm gonna go refill my water.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I'm gonna go pee.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I'll be right back, okay?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Oh my god.

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:42.000
You

02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:12.000
You

02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:42.000
You

02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:12.000
You

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:42.000
You

02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:12.000
You

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
You

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Okay, I'm back.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
You didn't hear me, shut up.

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.040
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear anything.

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:19.040
How was the piss? It was okay.

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.040
It was a normal piss.

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.040
I didn't look at the color.

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:27.040
Surprisingly, I actually didn't, um, bleed at all.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.040
I didn't goo at all while I was scared.

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:32.040
That's really surprising.

02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:40.080
Usually I do, especially when I sneeze.

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.080
What did she say?

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:49.080
I can't hear you, bitch, speak up.

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:04.080
Huh?

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:18.080
I didn't hear anything she said.

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:20.080
Oops.

02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:26.080
Okay, now the sound is completely off.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.080
What just happened?

02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:30.080
Okay, there we go.

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.120
Got it.

02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:34.120
What the f-

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:36.120
Wait, wait, wait.

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.120
How was it already?

02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.120
What happened?

02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:42.120
Do you bleed when you sneeze?

02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:44.120
I do, I do, I do.

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:53.120
When the lights turn on, you have to stop.

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:55.120
You can't move during lights on.

02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:57.120
Did you forget the rules?

02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:03.080
Okay, okay.

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.080
You don't move in the light.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:07.080
Okay, okay, okay.

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:15.080
Oh my god, please hold my hand, I'm scared.

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:24.080
Hold my sweaty fucking hand.

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:30.080
Oh, come on.

02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:34.080
What are those circles?

02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:36.080
Should I have grabbed the circles?

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:38.080
Should I have grabbed the circles?

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.080
Tell me right now, tell me right now.

02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:42.080
Please tell me right now, should I grab them?

02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:44.080
Do I grab them or do I do-

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:48.080
Are they for him?

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.080
Yes?

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:56.080
Shit, shit, what?

02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:58.080
No, no, no, yes, no.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.080
I can't see, I can't see.

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.080
How do I run? How do I run?

02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:22.080
Which one is it? Which one is it?

02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:25.080
I forgot, I forgot which button, I forgot which button.

02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:28.080
Not the hard tube? What do you mean?

02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.080
Stop pressing F, what the fuck is that?

02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:33.080
You're scaring me right now.

02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:38.080
Which direction do I go?

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.080
Stop, stop saying it's over, stop.

02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:51.080
Go to the right when you get out of the tube?

02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:55.080
Wait, I don't get it.

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.080
Choose hard path, shut up about hard path.

02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:09.080
You gotta tell me where I have to go, otherwise I don't know.

02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:18.080
I know it moves when the lights are on.

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:22.080
Should I have gone in a different direction?

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:27.080
Should I go like this?

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.080
What did I do wrong?

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:35.080
What did I do wrong that time?

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:44.080
Tubes after the slide have difficulties above them.

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.080
Go to your left in the tubes.

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.080
I did not fucking move.

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.080
Those hoops are optional?

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:02.080
I stopped talking when the lights are on.

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:06.080
Okay, hold on, I need to pause to reach out.

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:17.080
You let go of the bar so it counts as you're moving.

02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:20.080
Oh, so I should hold on to the bars.

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:23.080
You don't have to hang on the hoops.

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:25.080
The pugga pillar is chasing after you.

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:27.080
I know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:29.080
When the lights are on, yeah.

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:36.080
But aren't the hoops faster?

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:40.080
So, Amy, what you need to do is run faster than the monster.

02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:42.080
Okay, thanks.

02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.080
Go!

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:12.080
Oh, fuck!

02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.080
Okay, okay, okay.

02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:16.080
Come on!

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:26.080
I can't do this.

02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:28.080
I can't do this.

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:30.080
I can't do this.

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:32.080
I can't do this.

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.080
I can't do this.

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.080
I can't take it.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:38.080
I can't take it.

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.080
Usually I love being told I can take it,

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.080
but this time I can't fucking take it.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.080
You moved during lights on?

02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:51.080
I'm trying so hard not to do that, but I...

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:56.080
I lost eye!

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:00.080
God damn it.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.080
Where's the easy tube?

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:09.080
I will see it.

02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:15.080
Where's the easy tube?

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.080
Oh, it's on the left?

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.080
Go!

02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.080
There's the easy one.

02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:37.080
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.080
I can't see.

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.080
Have you played red like green light?

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:56.080
You're treating me like I'm actually delusional,

02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.080
like I'm actually stupid.

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.080
Like I have negative IQ.

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:08.080
Oh, shut up, she fell for the easy path.

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:13.080
Go right?

02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.080
What do you mean go right?

02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.080
What do you mean go right?

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.080
The blinking window.

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.080
What about it, what about it? What do I do there?

02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:43.080
What do I do with the blinking one, hold onto that?

02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.080
Ahh!

02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:55.080
Go, go, go, go.

02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:01.080
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, what do I do here?

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:03.080
What do I do here, what do I do here?

02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:04.080
Help me!

02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:09.080
What do I do? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up?

02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:12.080
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:16.080
You're safe? Which hole? There's no hole!

02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:21.080
There's no hole. Oh, there's a hole! Get me in the hole!

02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:30.080
Oh? Oh, okay.

02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:39.080
Bitch, she talks so, so low. Is it music or sounds? I can't hear you, girl.

02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:49.080
It's still chasing me.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.080
Did I just fucking die of fall damage?

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:06.080
I thought I had to do all of that all over again. I got so scared.

02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:26.080
What do I do here?

02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:39.080
Mommy, mommy, mommy, shut up. Oh my god. I'm so tired of hearing mommy.

02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.080
I never want to hear the word mommy ever again.

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:44.080
How do I get out of here?

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.080
Look up at the end of the- yeah. Have you tried looking up?

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:00.080
What?

02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:04.080
I like how crazy her voice gets, though. I really like this voice.

02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:14.080
Keep needing to put her like louder. She's so fucking quiet.

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.080
Where are you?

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:30.080
Up again?

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:33.080
Oh my god.

02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:41.080
Okay, okay. I'm guessing I have to look up another time, too.

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:45.080
Oh, maybe go down here.

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:50.080
Look up simulator.

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.080
Look up stupid.

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.080
I am authorized. I am authorized.

02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:15.080
She's about to turn.

02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:19.080
Is my little sis winning? Fuck yeah, she is.

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:22.080
I'm winning so hard right now.

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:24.080
Right? Right?

02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.080
Tell me I'm winning. Tell me I'm doing a really good job.

02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.080
Do I turn this? No, okay.

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:32.080
Okay, now it's too loud.

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:35.080
Wait.

02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:39.080
Oh, another cassette.

02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.080
You know, some people think I'm really old.

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.080
I'm really old, no, no one fucking thinks I'm really old.

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:46.080
Some people think I'm really young, but I was actually...

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:53.080
I was actually listening and watching cassettes when I was younger.

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:54.080
A lot.

02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:59.080
I had a whole cassette player and I had a whole collection of cassettes,

02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:01.080
and I would watch cassettes.

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:03.080
I'm not that young.

02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:06.080
You're doing a really good job.

02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.080
I'm actually secretly a boomer, and no one will ever know.

02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:18.080
Hag! No, no, I didn't tell you that so you couldn't call me a hag.

02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:20.080
Give it to me.

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:24.080
Rotate top degree. Oh, wait.

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:26.080
What?

02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:30.080
Oh.

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:37.080
There's a tape. Where is the tape?

02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:41.080
Did I miss it? Probably. Is there somebody here?

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:46.080
200-year-old.

02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:53.080
Oh, wait, no, where's the tape? Yeah.

02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:59.080
There's nothing back here.

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:01.080
Oh, that's where we came from.

02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:08.080
Literally legal.

02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:17.080
How could you miss? It was three feet in front of you.

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:19.080
What was in front of me?

02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:21.080
The tape?

02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:25.080
There's no tape.

02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:27.080
It was right...

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:30.080
Where? Here?

02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:32.080
Oh!

02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:34.080
Can I jump?

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:37.080
Oh, no.

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:42.080
Yeah, I was too distracted thinking about hags and how sexy...

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:47.080
Oh, okay. I was trying to read it upside down.

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.080
Okay.

02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:57.080
I see.

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:00.080
No, no, no.

02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:02.080
Wait, no.

02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:04.080
Wait, there's a top and a bottom?

02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:07.080
This one.

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:09.080
No! Oh, that's the top.

02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:11.080
Can I go the other direction?

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.080
Can I go the other direction?

02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:15.080
Maybe like that?

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:19.080
Wait, what?

02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:21.080
I don't get it!

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.080
No matter how old you are for me, you're eternally 19?

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:41.080
Why 19? That's such a random age.

02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:49.080
Toy scanner.

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.080
Scan this toy.

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.080
Scan my dick.

02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:56.080
I'm guessing I can't jump.

02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:01.080
Can I? Should I try again?

02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:03.080
19?

02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:04.080
Haggler!

02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:07.080
Watch out, we got an old lady over here.

02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:10.080
She might trip and fall and hurt her back at 19 years old.

02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:20.080
Can I grab it with my hands?

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:23.080
Sometimes...

02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:25.080
Wait, so if I only rotate the top,

02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:28.080
the bottom doesn't rotate, right?

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:30.080
Is that it?

02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:32.080
But if I rotate the bottom,

02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:35.080
then they both rotate, right?

02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:39.080
Right?

02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:56.080
Oh fuck you!

02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:59.080
These bitches know what they're doing.

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:02.080
Wait, oh, oh wait.

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.080
Wait, wait, what?

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:07.080
No, I don't think I... I don't...

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:08.080
I don't think I got it.

02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:11.080
So I need...

02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:20.080
What?

02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:23.080
Oh.

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:29.080
This fucking game is playing with my head.

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.080
But how am I supposed to get to it?

02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:38.080
How am I supposed to get to it?

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.080
This is your first time seeing someone get stuck.

02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:53.080
We'll be taking a lot of each other's first times.

02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:55.080
Just keep trying.

02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:59.080
Run while your hand is on it?

02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:00.080
What do you mean?

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.080
Rotate more.

02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:25.080
You gotta flip it truly.

02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:28.080
You gotta use more specific language.

02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:43.080
Step one, stand on blue platform in the middle.

02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:47.080
Oh wait, I can't even get to it, hold on.

02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:49.080
Okay, I'm in the middle.

02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:51.080
I'm in the middle.

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.080
Can I just...

02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:21.080
You know what, I don't even deserve that.

02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:27.080
I don't deserve to see that fucking cassette.

02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:34.080
I'm too fucking stupid.

02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:36.080
Oops, am I tracking?

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:38.080
I'm too fucking stupid.

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:40.080
I don't deserve to even look at it.

02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:46.080
I don't know how I got this far in life.

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:48.080
How haven't I died yet?

02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:54.080
Watch me not be able to get it anymore.

02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:58.080
Oops, I think I did it.

02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:12.080
I'm trying to finish this fucking chapter,

02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:15.080
but it's really taken my soul with it.

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.080
Play.

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:20.080
This better be fucking worth it.

02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:25.080
Should I know this guy?

02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:27.080
Is he also like a popular gamer?

02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.080
It's huge, I'm telling you. What's your favorite color? Blue? I bet it's blue, right? It's blue?

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:49.080
It's green.

02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:53.080
Okay, well, your special case, most people would say blue.

02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:56.080
But seriously, marketing is not as easy as you think.

02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:58.080
I make it look easy.

02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:03.080
If there's anything playtime coach should be known for, it's not toys, it's marketing.

02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:09.080
Thank you.

02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:14.080
Your special case?

02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:17.080
A special nutcase.

02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:19.080
What do I do now?

02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:24.080
I'm guessing I go to one of the places.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:38.080
What the hell is the E sound?

02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:41.080
Benjamin?

02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:45.080
Am I supposed to, is Benjamin like a YouTuber?

02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:48.080
Go to left first.

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:51.080
Wait.

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.080
Wait.

02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:54.080
Oops, wait, no.

02:25:57.080 --> 02:25:59.080
Aw, fuck.

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:04.080
Now I'm going to have to figure out how to get to the left one.

02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:08.080
No, I wasn't listening to the video, was I supposed to? Was it telling me something important?

02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:13.080
Hitting that Benjamin to blinker tint.

02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:18.080
What the fuck kind of zoomer talk are you, are you saying?

02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.080
Oh!

02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:21.080
What?

02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:22.080
Oh.

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:25.080
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, but...

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:26.080
Oh!

02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:27.080
What?

02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:28.080
Oh.

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:31.080
Meow, meow, meow, meow, but...

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:46.080
Wait, what?

02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:47.080
Oh!

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:49.080
Can you meow like her?

02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:50.080
What did she say?

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:52.080
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:54.080
Button.

02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:56.080
Oh.

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:05.080
When you elevate yourself, go all the way to the top and grab the button.

02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:06.080
Oh, I did it!

02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:17.080
Did something happen?

02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:20.080
Oh, this one's to go down.

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:22.080
Ugh.

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:23.080
Okay.

02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:24.080
Oh.

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:26.080
Is there anything else?

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.080
Am I missing something?

02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:28.080
Should I press the other buttons?

02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:36.080
Aw, I think I'm doing something wrong.

02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:40.080
I'll never understand why viewers urge humans to get collectibles.

02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:42.080
They'll never worry or care about.

02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:44.080
I don't know, it's fun.

02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:49.080
It's a nice challenge, even though this entire fucking game is hella challenging for me.

02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:50.080
Okay.

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:54.080
So...

02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:03.080
I feel like...

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.080
I feel like I should be sending these arrows a specific direction.

02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:11.080
Can I go up here?

02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:14.080
You're doing it correctly?

02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:18.080
Which way are they supposed to go?

02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.080
We direct the cat to a sand.

02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:38.080
You should be sending them towards you.

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:42.080
Where is me?

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.080
Where am I?

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.080
Which cat?

02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:46.080
Are those cats?

02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:48.080
Those look like monkeys.

02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:53.080
How late is it?

02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:59.080
I tell you how late it is, you're going to make fun of me for yawning.

02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:00.080
Those are the bunnies.

02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:02.080
There's no cats here.

02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:08.080
Okay.

02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:11.080
Okay.

02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.080
Okay.

02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:17.080
Okay, so I have to make them come towards me.

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.080
So, if they go that direction...

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:23.080
They go there.

02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:26.080
Oh, but then they fall.

02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:29.080
I won't, I promise.

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:31.080
Thank you, promise.

02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:35.080
What do you hear inside me?

02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.080
What do you hear inside me?

02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:41.080
I don't know.

02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:43.080
Do you want to find out?

02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:47.080
Go up and hit the next one.

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:49.080
Push the blue button.

02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:51.080
Oh, can I reset?

02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:02.080
Yeah, everyone was thinking it.

02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:03.080
He just said it.

02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:04.080
He said it for everyone.

02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:06.080
Oh, did I do it?

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:08.080
Oh, no, I didn't.

02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:12.080
There we go.

02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:13.080
Hello.

02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:15.080
Now what?

02:30:19.080 --> 02:30:21.080
I'm squishy and warm on the inside.

02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:26.080
Okay.

02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:29.080
Okay.

02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:31.080
Okay.

02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:32.080
Okay.

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:39.080
Is that all I needed?

02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:43.080
Proof?

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:49.080
Proof where it didn't happen.

02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:53.080
Bring it back to the other side of the spinny platform.

02:30:55.080 --> 02:30:56.080
The spinny platform.

02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:58.080
Is there a spinny platform?

02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:00.080
Oh, that goes up.

02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:02.080
Okay.

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:07.080
Oh, there you go.

02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:15.080
Oh, nobody leaves without a toy.

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:21.080
Oh, yeah, you're right.

02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:22.080
The toy scanner.

02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:23.080
The toy scanner.

02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:24.080
Okay.

02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:25.080
Okay.

02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:26.080
Okay.

02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:27.080
Okay.

02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:28.080
The toy scanner.

02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:30.080
Oh, shit.

02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:32.080
Oh, shit.

02:31:32.080 --> 02:31:33.080
Here we go again.

02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:34.080
I need that one.

02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:44.080
I can't believe the NSFW Twitter was official.

02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:45.080
What do you mean?

02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:52.080
Do you not know anything about us as streamers at all?

02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:55.080
I'm not as streamers.

02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:56.080
I guess as a company.

02:31:59.080 --> 02:32:00.080
What time is it?

02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:02.080
It's 8pm.

02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:15.080
Yippee.

02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:25.080
I've highly educated myself.

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:29.080
Listen, I've had a stressful evening here.

02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:31.080
Of course, I'm going to be tired.

02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:33.080
Okay.

02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:39.080
On the whole.

02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.080
The V-Sack.

02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:49.080
Wait, what?

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:54.080
Was I here before?

02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:56.080
No, I guess not.

02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:00.080
What?

02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:05.080
Okay, I'm glad no one made fun of me for being tired at 8.

02:33:11.080 --> 02:33:12.080
What do I do here?

02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:20.080
This part is tricky.

02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:30.080
Okay, will I go another direction then?

02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:33.080
I'm tired the moment I wake up.

02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:34.080
Me too.

02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:35.080
Me too.

02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:38.080
That is very real.

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:50.080
Oh, this is a different place.

02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:51.080
Wait, no, it's not.

02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:52.080
No, wait, yes it is.

02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:53.080
Okay.

02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:58.080
Wait, oh no, I need...

02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:00.080
Oh, I almost fell down.

02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:01.080
Okay.

02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:09.080
Are you fucking shitting me?

02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:10.080
Wait, what?

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:13.080
Hold on.

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:14.080
Oh.

02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:16.080
I thought I was gonna...

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.080
Okay.

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:29.080
I had a little bit of a delay reaction.

02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:30.080
Excuse me.

02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:33.080
Okay.

02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:35.080
Okay.

02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.080
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm gonna...

02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:41.080
Huh?

02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:45.080
Why did you lock it?

02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:46.080
What?

02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:48.080
Oh.

02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:50.080
Wait, no, don't use that hand, don't use that hand.

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:51.080
Okay.

02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:57.080
Ah.

02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:58.080
What?

02:34:58.080 --> 02:34:59.080
What?

02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:00.080
Sorry, sorry.

02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:03.080
It's still locked though.

02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:08.080
In order to get the red tape,

02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.080
you need to touch the second electric pole.

02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:17.080
The second electric pole.

02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:19.080
Do I go back this way?

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:20.080
Okay.

02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.080
When we can hear you smile when you talk, that's the cutest shit.

02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:28.080
Can you hear me smile?

02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:31.080
I think it's mostly that you can see me smile.

02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:37.080
Further from the panel.

02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:39.080
Panel.

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:40.080
What is a panel?

02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:42.080
There's a panel here?

02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:45.080
Hello?

02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:47.080
Did I fuck it up?

02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:48.080
Hello?

02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:49.080
Uh-oh.

02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:58.080
You can hear me smile?

02:35:58.080 --> 02:35:59.080
Aww.

02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:02.080
Step one, grab one.

02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:04.080
I grabbed one.

02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:14.080
You have to activate the other room

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:16.080
and then go back with your hand still connected.

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:20.080
Touch only the further pole.

02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:31.080
Oops.

02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:35.080
Okay, only the further pole.

02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.080
Oh, okay.

02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:48.080
Oh.

02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:51.080
Okay, okay.

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:53.080
Oh.

02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:55.080
Wait, what?

02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:56.080
Hold on.

02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:57.080
What just happened?

02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:58.080
What?

02:36:58.080 --> 02:36:59.080
Wait.

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:04.080
The circle in the middle of the screen

02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:05.080
indicates how far your arm...

02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:06.080
Oh, there was a circle.

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:09.080
Wait, I feel like I just did nothing.

02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:10.080
What did I...?

02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.080
Wait.

02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:14.080
What did I just do?

02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:16.080
That was nothing.

02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:17.080
Did I...

02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:21.080
Your smile sounds like ara ara, what the fuck?

02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:22.080
How is that...

02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:23.080
What?

02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:26.080
What did I...

02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:27.080
What did I...

02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:28.080
What did I forget?

02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:33.080
Stop.

02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:35.080
When you type in me like that,

02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:38.080
it makes me feel like you're disappointed in me.

02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:42.080
Where do I go now?

02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:45.080
Red door was open.

02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:47.080
It was open, you're right.

02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:49.080
It was open.

02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:51.080
What do I do with it?

02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:56.080
Come on.

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:03.080
Repeat the steps.

02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:07.080
You did great, just forgot to send energy

02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:08.080
to the one in the wall.

02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.080
Don't use my full government name against me.

02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:17.080
Or there was...

02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:28.080
Was there another one here?

02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:32.080
Was there another one here?

02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:35.080
Am I missing something?

02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:37.080
Am I missing something?

02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:40.080
Stop!

02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:47.080
Stop!

02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:49.080
If you see channel VR,

02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:53.080
grab the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.

02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:57.080
The red tape tucked into the electrical panel.

02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:59.080
Okay, the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:00.080
Okay, okay, okay.

02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:03.080
Okay, behind me?

02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:07.080
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:09.080
Wait, now I feel like I'm going the wrong direction.

02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:16.080
Okay.

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:17.080
Electrical panel.

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:21.080
Oh my fucking god.

02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:23.080
The way they make me kill myself here?

02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:24.080
It's like...

02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:27.080
It's like extra punishment.

02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:28.080
Okay.

02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:36.080
You can die later.

02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:38.080
Kill me now, please.

02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:40.080
I don't want to.

02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:43.080
You've tortured me enough.

02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:45.080
Get your...

02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:47.080
Pull yourself back up, soldier.

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.080
Okay.

02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:55.080
Okay.

02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:58.080
Okay.

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:02.080
Oh!

02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:04.080
How am I supposed to see that?

02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:07.080
How is...

02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:10.080
How am I supposed to see that?

02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:11.080
Okay, wait.

02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:17.080
Oh, this one.

02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.080
Am I supposed to keep my hand there?

02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:25.080
Okay.

02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:30.080
Oh, that's the wrong thing there.

02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:59.080
Is he talking about...

02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:11.080
Is he talking about mommy?

02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:15.080
I am a good girl.

02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:19.080
I'm a good girl for suffering through this game with you.

02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:22.080
Okay, where do I go now?

02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:27.080
You can pick all the bookers with that thing.

02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:29.080
Yeah, he is.

02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:30.080
Okay, okay.

02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:34.080
Do I leave?

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:41.080
That's not...

02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:48.080
Spiders aren't scary, I agree.

02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:49.080
I have a spider.

02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:51.080
Her name is Rangel,

02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:53.080
and she's a tarantula.

02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:56.080
And she's an Arizona blonde,

02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:58.080
and she's five years old,

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:01.080
and she's really fat.

02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:05.080
You gotta do it again and go through the other door.

02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:08.080
The best girl?

02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:10.080
Your best girl?

02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:11.080
No.

02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:24.080
You have to need to get through the electrical door.

02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:27.080
Electrical door.

02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:28.080
There's another door.

02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:32.080
Okay, I'm gonna go here.

02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:36.080
Another door.

02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:37.080
This door?

02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:44.080
Jumping spiders are really cute.

02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:49.080
Is it this door?

02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.080
What's the point of using both of these?

02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:57.080
What if I just do one?

02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:01.080
Nothing.

02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:05.080
In the room with the TV.

02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:08.080
The other outlet.

02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:12.080
The other outlet.

02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:28.080
Did you try to type in me,

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:31.080
and instead of correct it to I'm my?

02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:34.080
Right there, the circle.

02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:37.080
The circle in front of me.

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:41.080
The circle in front of me.

02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:44.080
The circle, the circle in front of me.

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:47.080
The circle in front of me.

02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:49.080
The circle in front of me.

02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:51.080
It's just that simple, the circle in front of me, right.

02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.080
Why don't I think about that circle in front of me?

02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:57.080
Yeah, but yeah, I get it.

02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:00.080
Yeah, the circle in front of me.

02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:04.080
The circle in front of me.

02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:22.760
All these squares make a circle, and I'm in the middle, and all the rest of the wolves

02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:28.200
are around me, and no one wants to be my mate, and I'm getting publicly humiliated because

02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:35.200
no one wants to be my mate!

02:44:35.200 --> 02:45:04.200
I don't need sleep, I need to finish this fucking level, that's what I need!

02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:33.200
Okay, fine, jeez, let's go up left, tell me what to do now?

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:51.200
Look for the number 2 in the room with the VCR.

02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:54.200
Your circle is your reticle, are you?

02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:58.200
Are you shitting on my dick right now?

02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:05.200
Swing across, open door, swing back, connect power.

02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:14.200
Swing across, you gotta connect 1 to 2.

02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:20.200
Okay, what?

02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:24.200
I should be in front of the...

02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:28.200
When you open the door, don't take the energy out of it.

02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:51.200
Number 2?

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:54.200
Number 2?

02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:57.200
2?

02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:03.200
Any 2s?

02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:08.200
Why won't it work?

02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:12.200
Huh?

02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:19.200
It's right there, it's right there!

02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:21.200
What's going on, what's going on?

02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:26.200
It's right there, it's right there, it's right there, just let me...

02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:29.200
You have to swing back?

02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:31.200
Huh?

02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:37.200
What is a reticle, what does a reticle mean?

02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:40.200
You have to swing back, you need the green one?

02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:42.200
There's a green one?

02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:48.200
Swing to the other room, then let go, then let go, left hand go through the door,

02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:52.200
you will be back to the first, activate the pull, that doesn't...

02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:58.200
You need green power.

02:47:58.200 --> 02:48:04.200
Green power, of course!

02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:08.200
Right, yeah, green power, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I need green power.

02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:14.200
You gotta open the door to go through the red side to get the electricity.

02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:18.200
Yeah, green power, yeah.

02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:21.200
Why don't we go to sleep?

02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:25.200
If I pass this, do I win?

02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:32.200
Like how much more is there?

02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:39.200
Do I need both of these?

02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:46.200
In the middle of the screen you got a little rectangle.

02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:52.200
No?

02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:54.200
The lid?

02:48:54.200 --> 02:49:04.200
I feel like...

02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:11.200
Okay wait, so do I need both of these?

02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:16.200
Hold on, I have an idea, I have an idea, I have an idea, let me do something here.

02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:21.200
Let me do something.

02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:36.200
What the fuck is this called?

02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:41.200
Yeah, stand back, I'm starting to cook with gas now, okay?

02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:57.200
What is this part? What should I call this part?

02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:03.200
Come on, fucking ad.

02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:09.200
Wait, is there such a thing as YouTube dark mode?

02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:23.200
Okay, we passed that, we passed that.

02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:29.200
Oh fuck, we're almost at three hours?

02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:37.200
Okay, we passed that.

02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:43.200
YouTube has a dark mode?

02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:50.200
Oh this is the room, okay.

02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:55.200
I want to finish this fucking game dude.

02:50:55.200 --> 02:51:03.200
I'm not about to change the dark mode right now, let me have my fucking light mode.

02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:08.200
I like light mode.

02:51:08.200 --> 02:51:14.200
I know it's muted, I know it's muted.

02:51:14.200 --> 02:51:27.200
Is he figuring it out himself currently? Does he not know how to play either?

02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:33.200
Cause he looks like he doesn't know how to play either.

02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:38.200
Come on dude, come on, this is a walkthrough, you're supposed to know what to do already, come on man.

02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:41.200
Maybe he's talking?

02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:44.200
No, he's not even talking.

02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:50.200
Come on man, don't waste my time here, come on.

02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:54.200
Oh my god, you dumbass.

02:51:54.200 --> 02:52:01.200
Wait what?

02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:07.200
Wait what?

02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:09.200
Is this guy stupid?

02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:14.200
Is he being stupid on purpose?

02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:19.200
He's not talking.

02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:23.200
Bro, this is not a walkthrough.

02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:29.200
How are you going to fucking die during a walkthrough?

02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:50.200
Yeah everyone's stupid except for me.

02:52:50.200 --> 02:52:56.200
Come on, you can do it, come on.

02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:00.200
Play it at two times speed.

02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:08.200
Does he get stuck here too? Cause it looks like he's almost not...

02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:11.200
Okay no, I'm not watching this, I'm not fucking watching this.

02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:15.200
Give me a walkthrough.

02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:31.200
Like show me that you know what you're doing.

02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:39.200
Oh my fucking god.

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:42.200
This is so frustrating.

02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:47.200
It's literally a pre-recorded video, cut out the parts where you fucking die.

02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:50.200
Isn't that fucking hard? It's a walkthrough.

02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:53.200
Walk me through the game, why are you showing me you dying?

02:53:53.200 --> 02:54:07.200
Do you want me to copy that too? Do you want me to copy every time you fucking die?

02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:14.200
Wait, what?

02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:18.200
Wait, what just happened?

02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:24.200
Let me look through that again.

02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:34.200
Okay.

02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:40.200
Oh you have to do it really quickly and you have to get both of them.

02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:49.200
It stays open.

02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:55.200
Okay.

02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:59.200
Oh god it's lagging, why is it lagging?

02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:02.200
Okay.

02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:05.200
Okay, hold on, let me...

02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:20.200
God this game hurts to look at.

02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:33.200
This developer should KYS.

02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:41.200
One out, one out.

02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:45.200
What do you mean gamma? Do I have something?

02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:50.200
This play capture? Do I have like a filter on my...

02:55:50.200 --> 02:56:01.200
Where's the gamma? What gamma are you talking about? There's no gamma.

02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:07.200
The developer should kiss his sister.

02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:12.200
Turn your brain around, do you hate it so much?

02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:15.200
Like, huh?

02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:18.200
Is that better? Is that what you want?

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.200
Thank you for the pet.

02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:23.200
Okay, I'm as the same thing as Brainus, but I feel like this is too dark.

02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:26.200
I'm really blind, man.

02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:29.200
Okay.

02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:35.200
Let me see what he does.

02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:41.200
Where do you go? Back in here.

02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:50.200
Okay, okay.

02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:54.200
Nothing is brighter than your smile, oh you.

02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:58.200
Nothing may be bright and OBS.

02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:05.200
Like my display capture doesn't have any gamma filters or anything.

02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:07.200
Yeah, of course I fucking love the dislike, are you kidding me?

02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:10.200
What's the fucking effort into your walkthrough?

02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:12.200
It's not that hard.

02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:13.200
Wait, what?

02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:19.200
The wrong direction?

02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:24.200
If you could just watch the rest of the playthrough?

02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:30.200
Okay, oh shit.

02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:32.200
This is when mommy chases me.

02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:35.200
Okay, if I get stuck here with mommy, I'm gonna...

02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.200
I will end, right?

02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:43.200
I asked you to play fair and you cheated.

02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:44.200
Great cheaters.

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:47.200
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:50.200
One last game.

02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:52.200
Okay.

02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:54.200
Hide and...

02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:55.200
Stay.

02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.200
Fuck.

02:57:57.200 --> 02:57:58.200
Ten.

02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:00.200
Nine.

02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:04.200
God, the way she goes crazy is so sexy.

02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:08.200
I hate her before but her voice is so hot.

02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:20.200
Am I actually supposed to hide?

02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:40.200
I'll just run? Okay.

02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:45.200
I'll just run.

02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:47.200
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

02:58:47.200 --> 02:58:50.200
I feel like it's really suspiciously quiet.

02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:52.200
Oh, come on now.

02:58:52.200 --> 02:58:56.200
Did I go the wrong direction?

02:58:56.200 --> 02:58:57.200
Okay, wait, I'm pausing.

02:58:57.200 --> 02:58:58.200
What did I do wrong?

02:58:58.200 --> 02:59:03.200
What did I do wrong this time?

02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:11.200
Did I go the wrong direction?

02:59:11.200 --> 02:59:15.200
Up?

02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:18.200
Hello, you silent when I'm crazy?

02:59:18.200 --> 02:59:22.200
You can go listen to me be crazy if you want.

02:59:22.200 --> 02:59:24.200
There should be a handle.

02:59:24.200 --> 02:59:28.200
Stop saying I'm mine.

02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:38.200
Okay, look up where?

02:59:38.200 --> 02:59:40.200
Look up where?

02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:41.200
Where is the up?

02:59:41.200 --> 02:59:45.200
Where is the up?

02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:50.200
You have to pull yourself off while she passes by.

02:59:59.200 --> 03:00:02.200
I feel like I'm just walking towards her now.

03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:06.200
Here?

03:00:06.200 --> 03:00:10.200
Wait, what? Am I?

03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:18.200
I think therefore I'm mine.

03:00:18.200 --> 03:00:22.200
Go back?

03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:30.200
Is there some sort of timer?

03:00:30.200 --> 03:00:33.200
I was doing it right the first time?

03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:36.200
Oh.

03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:42.200
Okay, and now she's going to chase me through this?

03:00:42.200 --> 03:00:45.200
Get back to me!

03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:50.200
Okay, okay.

03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:57.200
I feel like I should be getting chased right now.

03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:02.200
There's no urgency here.

03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:08.200
Should I do all of these?

03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:13.200
Put the figure in a jiffy.

03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:18.200
Put the figure in a jar.

03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:29.200
There's an order.

03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:32.200
I'm guessing it's...

03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:36.200
Red, yellow, blue, green.

03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:41.200
Red, yellow, blue, green.

03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:51.200
A common tactic in this game when stuck is to look up.

03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:01.200
What do I do here now?

03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:04.200
Wait, wasn't there a voltage thing?

03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:06.200
Tab?

03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:10.200
This one?

03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:15.200
That's a train call.

03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:17.200
Numbers?

03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:20.200
Look under?

03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:26.200
Numbers.

03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:28.200
Numbers.

03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:30.200
Numbers, what do they mean?

03:02:30.200 --> 03:02:32.200
Numbers!

03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:34.200
Okay, goodbye.

03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:37.200
It's just the order of the numbers.

03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:39.200
Numbers?

03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:41.200
The wires? The numbers and the wires?

03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:44.200
There's numbers and wires?

03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:48.200
Numbers?

03:02:48.200 --> 03:02:50.200
Pull up, check the numbers.

03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:52.200
The numbers.

03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:56.200
Two, one.

03:02:56.200 --> 03:02:58.200
Is it one, three, two?

03:02:58.200 --> 03:03:00.200
Is that the order?

03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:02.200
There's numbers, yeah.

03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:06.200
Look at the numbers on the boxes, yeah.

03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:14.200
Let's tell you what color lover to pull.

03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:22.200
So red, red, red, green, blue?

03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:29.200
Red, blue, you guys are telling me different colors.

03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:33.200
Red, red, blue, green.

03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:36.200
Red, blue, green.

03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:44.200
Red, blue, green.

03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:46.200
Did I do it?

03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:48.200
Wait, red, blue, green, yellow.

03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:50.200
Yellow, where's yellow?

03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:52.200
There's no yellow.

03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:56.200
Where are you seeing yellow?

03:03:56.200 --> 03:04:01.200
Fucking, stop saying I'm mine!

03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:03.200
Yellow last?

03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:07.200
But there's no yellow here.

03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:10.200
Okay, red, red, blue.

03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:12.200
Oh, there is a yellow!

03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:14.200
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:21.200
Red, red, blue, green, yellow, okay.

03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:28.200
Okay, red, blue, green, yellow.

03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:30.200
Yay!

03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:39.200
Oh my god, I love not being stuck in video games.

03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:40.200
Ah!

03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:41.200
Where is she?

03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:42.200
Ah!

03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:43.200
Ah!

Ah!

03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:45.200
Ah!

03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:46.200
Ah!

03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:47.200
Ah!

03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:48.200
Ah!

03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:49.200
Ah!

03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:50.200
Ah!

03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:51.200
Ah!

Ah!

03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:54.200
Ah!

03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:55.200
Ah!

03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:06.820
Wait, I hide in the grass?

03:10:07.820 --> 03:10:09.420
Um, um, um, um...

03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:11.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:13.320
I can't!

03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:15.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:15.420 --> 03:10:17.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:17.420 --> 03:10:19.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:19.420 --> 03:10:21.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:23.420
I did it, I...

03:10:23.420 --> 03:10:25.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:25.420 --> 03:10:27.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:27.420 --> 03:10:29.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:31.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:33.420
Hahahaha!

03:10:33.420 --> 03:10:34.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:36.620
Task failed success!

03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:38.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:40.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:42.620
Oh, where did she go?

03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:44.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:46.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:46.620 --> 03:10:48.620
I guess I can just go in there.

03:10:48.620 --> 03:10:50.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:52.620
Yeah, even the game loves I'm.

03:10:52.620 --> 03:10:54.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:54.620 --> 03:10:56.620
I'm surprised she walked by me.

03:10:56.620 --> 03:10:58.620
Hahahaha!

03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:00.620
Okay, now she goes in the grass?

03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:02.620
Yeah?

03:11:02.620 --> 03:11:04.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:10.620 --> 03:11:12.620
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:14.620
Are you kidding me?

03:11:20.620 --> 03:11:22.620
Run? I wasn't supposed to go through that door?

03:11:28.220 --> 03:11:30.220
Freakin' barrels.

03:11:32.620 --> 03:11:34.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:34.620 --> 03:11:36.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:36.620 --> 03:11:38.620
Okay.

03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:40.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:42.620
She's not chasing me.

03:11:42.620 --> 03:11:44.620
I need to go back to get her.

03:11:44.620 --> 03:11:46.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:48.620
Okay.

03:11:48.620 --> 03:11:50.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:50.620 --> 03:11:52.620
I should have bare-loaded her!

03:11:52.620 --> 03:11:54.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:54.620 --> 03:11:56.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:56.620 --> 03:11:58.620
Hahahaha!

03:11:58.620 --> 03:12:00.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:00.620 --> 03:12:02.620
What am I supposed to do here?

03:12:02.620 --> 03:12:04.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:04.620 --> 03:12:06.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:06.620 --> 03:12:08.620
You did everything right now.

03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:10.620
It's all about not making mistakes.

03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:12.620
Right, yeah.

03:12:12.620 --> 03:12:14.620
I know how to do.

03:12:14.620 --> 03:12:16.620
I know how to not make mistakes.

03:12:16.620 --> 03:12:18.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:22.620
Look up.

03:12:22.620 --> 03:12:24.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:26.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:30.620
Is she chasing me?

03:12:30.620 --> 03:12:32.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:36.620 --> 03:12:38.620
This fucking barrel, dude!

03:12:38.620 --> 03:12:40.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:40.620 --> 03:12:42.620
Okay, what do I do here?

03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:44.620
What do I do there?

03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:46.620
I'm still confused.

03:12:46.620 --> 03:12:48.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:48.620 --> 03:12:50.620
Hahahaha!

03:12:52.620 --> 03:12:54.620
Turn around?

03:12:54.620 --> 03:12:56.620
Ohhhhh!

03:12:56.620 --> 03:12:58.620
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

03:12:58.620 --> 03:13:00.620
Hahahaha!

03:13:00.620 --> 03:13:02.620
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around!

03:13:02.620 --> 03:13:04.620
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:06.620
Hahahaha!

03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:08.620
Okay.

03:13:08.620 --> 03:13:10.620
She didn't come yet.

03:13:10.620 --> 03:13:12.620
Okay.

03:13:12.620 --> 03:13:14.620
Hahahaha!

03:13:14.620 --> 03:13:16.620
Hahahaha!

03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:19.620
Uh-uh.

03:13:19.620 --> 03:13:23.620
Get cut.

03:13:23.620 --> 03:13:38.620
I'm walking in the sewers right now.

03:13:38.620 --> 03:13:40.620
Oh, fuck!

03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:48.620
Let me turn the sound down a little.

03:13:50.620 --> 03:13:52.620
Isn't he wonderful?

03:13:55.620 --> 03:13:58.620
I'm still not excited for chapter three.

03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:01.620
Okay.

03:14:02.620 --> 03:14:04.620
Okay, I can do this. We're almost done.

03:14:04.620 --> 03:14:06.620
Right, right, right, right, right. We're almost done after this.

03:14:06.620 --> 03:14:08.620
This is it, right? This is like the last chase, right?

03:14:08.620 --> 03:14:10.620
Please say yes. Please say yes. Say yes.

03:14:11.620 --> 03:14:12.620
To me? Please say yes.

03:14:12.620 --> 03:14:15.620
I feel like that bear was there on purpose, isn't it?

03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:18.620
To fuck you over.

03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:22.620
Laugh isn't really sexy anymore.

03:14:23.620 --> 03:14:26.620
I don't want to play with you anymore. You're not sexy.

03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:42.620
She legit sounds like she's painfully gagging on something.

03:14:42.620 --> 03:14:44.620
Yeah, gagging on my dick!

03:14:49.620 --> 03:14:55.620
It's not a skill issue. It's a game issue.

03:14:56.620 --> 03:14:58.620
They just have to fix their aim.

03:14:59.620 --> 03:15:03.620
The game obviously is poorly optimized here.

03:15:03.620 --> 03:15:08.620
If they can't pick up my perfectly aimed mouse cursor.

03:15:11.620 --> 03:15:13.620
Gagging on the two-way check.

03:15:13.620 --> 03:15:16.620
Come on! Did I walk into her?

03:15:20.620 --> 03:15:23.620
Shut up! There's so much to gag on it.

03:15:23.620 --> 03:15:26.620
It'll go so deep in your throat just you fucking wait.

03:15:29.620 --> 03:15:30.620
Cough.

03:15:35.620 --> 03:15:36.620
Okay.

03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:38.620
I'll do it this time.

03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:42.620
Your throat will be so sore.

03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:43.620
Your dentist is gonna be like,

03:15:43.620 --> 03:15:47.620
God damn, were you gagging on a fucking...

03:15:47.620 --> 03:15:49.620
I don't know.

03:15:51.620 --> 03:15:54.620
Were you gagging on Amy's dick last night?

03:15:54.620 --> 03:15:58.620
Because that's the only cock that would be long enough to make such...

03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:00.620
such damage to your throat.

03:16:04.620 --> 03:16:06.620
I got it that time!

03:16:09.620 --> 03:16:11.620
I fucking got it that time!

03:16:14.620 --> 03:16:15.620
Too slow.

03:16:17.620 --> 03:16:18.620
The dentist knows?

03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:22.620
Yeah, there's like bruising at the back of your throat sometimes.

03:16:22.620 --> 03:16:24.620
The dentist will know.

03:16:24.620 --> 03:16:27.620
I'll make sure that throat is bruised up, baby.

03:16:35.620 --> 03:16:36.620
Fuck this barrel!

03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:54.620
No!

03:16:55.620 --> 03:16:56.620
Get up you fucker with my craft!

03:16:56.620 --> 03:16:58.620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft...

03:16:58.620 --> 03:17:00.620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft...

03:17:00.620 --> 03:17:02.620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft.

03:17:07.620 --> 03:17:08.620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft, in my craft.

03:17:08.620 --> 03:17:10.620
In my craft, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game,

03:17:10.620 --> 03:17:12.620
In game, in game, I, I, I died in game.

03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:14.620
I died in game.

03:17:22.620 --> 03:17:25.620
My throat is literally killing me right now.

03:17:25.620 --> 03:17:26.120
Oh.

03:17:36.120 --> 03:17:39.620
Wait, I take a long time because I'm trying to.

03:17:39.620 --> 03:17:44.620
I'm trying to ink correctly.

03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:45.620
Oh my god.

03:17:50.620 --> 03:17:51.620
Oh my god.

03:17:52.620 --> 03:17:53.620
Oh my god.

03:18:02.620 --> 03:18:05.620
Okay, if I don't get it this time, I'm literally stopping.

03:18:05.620 --> 03:18:08.620
And we'll finish it the next time.

03:18:08.620 --> 03:18:10.620
I can't.

03:18:13.620 --> 03:18:15.620
We'll finish the next time.

03:18:19.620 --> 03:18:21.620
I didn't even see it.

03:18:21.620 --> 03:18:24.620
I had it and I didn't even know.

03:18:24.620 --> 03:18:26.620
I didn't know what I was doing.

03:18:26.620 --> 03:18:28.620
How do people do this?

03:18:28.620 --> 03:18:31.620
This is like way harder than the first chapter.

03:18:52.620 --> 03:18:55.620
What do I do?

03:18:55.620 --> 03:18:56.620
Please tell me what to do.

03:18:56.620 --> 03:18:57.620
Please tell me what to do.

03:19:19.620 --> 03:19:20.620
Why is it so slow?

03:19:20.620 --> 03:19:23.620
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

03:19:35.620 --> 03:19:38.620
Die, bitch! Die!

03:19:43.620 --> 03:19:46.620
I love seeing you in pain!

03:19:47.620 --> 03:19:50.620
That's right scream for me!

03:19:56.620 --> 03:19:57.620
Oh my god.

03:20:17.620 --> 03:20:23.620
Okay, we did it.

03:20:23.620 --> 03:20:24.620
Right?

03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:34.620
Thank you for the head pass.

03:20:35.620 --> 03:20:36.620
Oh.

03:20:43.620 --> 03:20:44.620
Is this it?

03:20:44.620 --> 03:20:45.620
Please tell me.

03:20:45.620 --> 03:20:46.620
Please tell me.

03:20:46.620 --> 03:20:47.620
That's it.

03:20:56.620 --> 03:20:59.620
I know I'm so good at games.

03:20:59.620 --> 03:21:06.620
Like, really, they should have considered that I might play this game and make it harder

03:21:06.620 --> 03:21:08.620
because this was just too easy.

03:21:10.620 --> 03:21:12.620
Hi, I fucking saved your life, bitch.

03:21:20.620 --> 03:21:21.620
What?

03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:26.620
Do I have to read that?

03:21:29.620 --> 03:21:30.620
I can't read that.

03:21:38.620 --> 03:21:41.620
Opening the control station.

03:21:41.620 --> 03:21:42.620
Just pull both levers?

03:21:42.620 --> 03:21:43.620
Oh.

03:21:49.620 --> 03:21:51.620
Yeah, double fist that shit.

03:21:51.620 --> 03:21:53.620
It's not working.

03:21:53.620 --> 03:21:58.620
Slap, puppy?

03:22:02.620 --> 03:22:03.620
Is that it?

03:22:03.620 --> 03:22:04.620
Is that it?

03:22:07.620 --> 03:22:08.620
Yeah.

03:22:10.620 --> 03:22:11.620
Okay.

03:22:14.620 --> 03:22:15.620
Okay.

03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:22.620
I'm so happy!

03:22:24.620 --> 03:22:28.620
Oh my god, that was such an emotional roller coaster.

03:22:28.620 --> 03:22:29.620
Where am I going?

03:22:38.620 --> 03:22:39.620
You skipped a tape?

03:22:39.620 --> 03:22:40.620
I don't fucking care.

03:22:46.620 --> 03:22:47.620
Was it important?

03:22:47.620 --> 03:22:49.620
Was it really important?

03:22:54.620 --> 03:22:56.620
That thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.

03:22:59.620 --> 03:23:00.620
Do I press buttons?

03:23:06.620 --> 03:23:07.620
I'm confused.

03:23:09.620 --> 03:23:10.620
Do I press the buttons?

03:23:12.620 --> 03:23:13.620
Oh.

03:23:14.620 --> 03:23:15.620
Oh, oh.

03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:18.620
Oh, I have to make them the right colors.

03:23:24.620 --> 03:23:25.620
Wait.

03:23:34.620 --> 03:23:36.620
So this thing is red?

03:23:37.620 --> 03:23:38.620
Okay.

03:23:39.620 --> 03:23:41.620
The other thing is yellow.

03:23:43.620 --> 03:23:44.620
The next thing is red.

03:23:45.620 --> 03:23:46.620
Okay.

03:23:46.620 --> 03:23:47.620
The last thing is blue.

03:23:48.620 --> 03:23:49.620
Oh wait.

03:23:54.620 --> 03:23:56.620
Oh, now I have to put them in the right order.

03:24:01.620 --> 03:24:03.620
Red, yellow, red, blue.

03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:07.620
Now what?

03:24:07.620 --> 03:24:08.620
It's in the right order.

03:24:10.620 --> 03:24:12.620
Hit the arrow to put them in the same order.

03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:13.620
Yeah, they're in the same order.

03:24:14.620 --> 03:24:15.620
Yeah.

03:24:16.620 --> 03:24:17.620
Red, yellow, red, blue.

03:24:18.620 --> 03:24:19.620
The color.

03:24:19.620 --> 03:24:21.620
I've seen subscribers break their brains on this puzzle.

03:24:21.620 --> 03:24:23.620
You understood it immediately?

03:24:23.620 --> 03:24:24.620
Password three?

03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:27.620
One, four, two, three.

03:24:29.620 --> 03:24:30.620
How do I change the numbers?

03:24:38.620 --> 03:24:39.620
But how do I change them?

03:24:43.620 --> 03:24:44.620
Push them?

03:24:49.620 --> 03:24:50.620
Punch them?

03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:00.620
I can't click on it.

03:25:16.620 --> 03:25:17.620
Huh.

03:25:19.620 --> 03:25:20.620
Click on the faces?

03:25:22.620 --> 03:25:23.620
Oh.

03:25:23.620 --> 03:25:26.620
One, four, two, three.

03:25:28.620 --> 03:25:29.620
Go.

03:25:34.620 --> 03:25:35.620
Go.

03:25:35.620 --> 03:25:36.620
Let's go.

03:25:37.620 --> 03:25:38.620
Let's leave this.

03:25:38.620 --> 03:25:39.620
Oh, is it going?

03:25:40.620 --> 03:25:41.620
Yippee.

03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:43.620
Re-game.

03:25:49.620 --> 03:25:50.620
Red lever's a break?

03:25:50.620 --> 03:25:51.620
Oh, we don't want to break.

03:25:52.620 --> 03:25:53.620
Choo-choo.

03:25:53.620 --> 03:25:54.620
Can I go choo-choo?

03:25:54.620 --> 03:25:55.620
Choo-choo.

03:25:57.620 --> 03:25:58.620
Choo-choo.

03:26:00.620 --> 03:26:01.620
Yay.

03:26:01.620 --> 03:26:02.620
Choo-choo.

03:26:02.620 --> 03:26:03.620
Choo-choo.

03:26:04.620 --> 03:26:05.620
Oh my god, I'm so tired.

03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:07.620
Let's go.

03:26:11.620 --> 03:26:13.620
I ran out of water again.

03:26:14.620 --> 03:26:15.620
Phew.

03:26:18.620 --> 03:26:19.620
Get applauded.

03:26:19.620 --> 03:26:20.620
Get applauded.

03:26:24.620 --> 03:26:25.620
Hm?

03:26:29.620 --> 03:26:30.620
Ew.

03:26:36.620 --> 03:26:37.620
Whoa.

03:26:39.620 --> 03:26:40.620
What?

03:26:43.620 --> 03:26:44.620
What?

03:26:51.620 --> 03:26:52.620
Sounds like me?

03:26:56.620 --> 03:26:58.620
Time to figure out what's happening.

03:27:01.620 --> 03:27:02.620
Hm?

03:27:06.620 --> 03:27:09.620
I'm not good at copying voices like Chibi.

03:27:11.620 --> 03:27:12.620
What?

03:27:13.620 --> 03:27:14.620
Hm?

03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:17.620
Hm?

03:27:18.620 --> 03:27:19.620
What happened?

03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:26.620
What happened?

03:27:26.620 --> 03:27:28.620
Why is it going faster?

03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:29.620
Where are we going?

03:27:29.620 --> 03:27:32.620
Why are we going so fucking fast?

03:27:32.620 --> 03:27:33.620
Are we tilting?

03:27:34.620 --> 03:27:36.620
Are we getting tilted right now?

03:27:37.620 --> 03:27:38.620
Get tilted.

03:27:39.620 --> 03:27:42.620
I feel like something bad is going to happen.

03:27:43.620 --> 03:27:44.620
Hm?

03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:47.620
What do I do?

03:27:47.620 --> 03:27:48.620
Do-do.

03:27:48.620 --> 03:27:50.620
We're going to die.

03:27:51.620 --> 03:27:52.620
Stop train.

03:27:53.620 --> 03:27:54.620
I can't.

03:27:54.620 --> 03:27:55.620
No brakes.

03:27:55.620 --> 03:27:57.620
No brakes on the train.

03:28:01.620 --> 03:28:03.620
It's not going to work.

03:28:04.620 --> 03:28:05.620
My hand.

03:28:05.620 --> 03:28:07.620
Don't rip my hand off.

03:28:14.620 --> 03:28:16.620
Oh, that was it, wasn't it?

03:28:21.620 --> 03:28:22.620
Playcare?

03:28:25.620 --> 03:28:26.620
Never mind playcare.

03:28:26.620 --> 03:28:29.620
I need some fucking aftercare after getting fucked in the ass so hard.

03:28:32.620 --> 03:28:33.620
We did it.

03:28:33.620 --> 03:28:34.620
We did it.

03:28:34.620 --> 03:28:35.620
We did it.

03:28:35.620 --> 03:28:36.620
We did it.

03:28:36.620 --> 03:28:37.620
We did it.

03:28:37.620 --> 03:28:38.620
We did it.

03:28:38.620 --> 03:28:39.620
Chapter 3 tomorrow?

03:28:39.620 --> 03:28:42.620
No, I already have something planned for chapter 3.

03:28:42.620 --> 03:28:45.620
I already have stuff planned for next week too.

03:28:45.620 --> 03:28:48.620
Maybe the week after that we can do chapter 3.

03:28:49.620 --> 03:28:52.620
There's Jacks but I see Big Spider.

03:29:01.620 --> 03:29:03.620
Yeah, I did it.

03:29:03.620 --> 03:29:04.620
I did it.

03:29:11.620 --> 03:29:12.620
Is that it?

03:29:12.620 --> 03:29:13.620
There's not like other-

03:29:14.620 --> 03:29:15.620
Shut up.

03:29:15.620 --> 03:29:17.620
It is not story early for another horror game.

03:29:17.620 --> 03:29:18.620
I can't.

03:29:18.620 --> 03:29:19.620
My mind is-

03:29:19.620 --> 03:29:21.620
I've been mind broken.

03:29:22.620 --> 03:29:24.620
What do you want as a reward?

03:29:26.620 --> 03:29:27.620
A shower.

03:29:29.620 --> 03:29:30.620
A shower.

03:29:31.620 --> 03:29:34.620
We can shower together as a reward.

03:29:38.620 --> 03:29:41.620
A shower and a cough drop and some tea.

03:29:41.620 --> 03:29:43.620
That's what I want as a reward.

03:29:45.620 --> 03:29:46.620
Yeah, together.

03:29:52.620 --> 03:29:53.620
Quit.

03:29:53.620 --> 03:29:54.620
Quit.

03:29:58.620 --> 03:29:59.620
Okay.

03:30:00.620 --> 03:30:01.620
Quit.

03:30:08.620 --> 03:30:09.620
Oh, shit.

03:30:09.620 --> 03:30:10.620
Now the chat has to cap up.

03:30:10.620 --> 03:30:11.620
Cap up.

03:30:11.620 --> 03:30:12.620
Check.

03:30:12.620 --> 03:30:13.620
Check up.

03:30:13.620 --> 03:30:14.620
Check.

03:30:14.620 --> 03:30:15.620
Check.

03:30:15.620 --> 03:30:16.620
Check.

03:30:18.620 --> 03:30:19.620
Catch up.

03:30:20.620 --> 03:30:21.620
Okay.

03:30:22.620 --> 03:30:23.620
Yeah.

03:30:23.620 --> 03:30:24.620
Thank you for coming.

03:30:24.620 --> 03:30:25.620
I did it.

03:30:25.620 --> 03:30:26.620
I usually-

03:30:26.620 --> 03:30:27.620
I usually release stream too.

03:30:27.620 --> 03:30:30.620
I'm fucking blinking like a fucking frog right now.

03:30:30.620 --> 03:30:31.620
I usually only-

03:30:31.620 --> 03:30:33.620
Okay, that's really distracting.

03:30:33.620 --> 03:30:36.620
I usually only stream for two hours.

03:30:36.620 --> 03:30:38.620
But I guess we were here for the long run.

03:30:38.620 --> 03:30:42.620
Thank you so much for coming and staying

03:30:42.620 --> 03:30:44.620
and helping me the whole time.

03:30:44.620 --> 03:30:48.620
Encouraging me and praising me when I was going insane.

03:30:51.620 --> 03:30:52.620
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:30:52.620 --> 03:30:54.620
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.

03:30:54.620 --> 03:30:57.620
I think it's going to be really funny and exciting.

03:31:00.620 --> 03:31:01.620
Bye-bye.

03:31:02.620 --> 03:31:04.620
I love you, big bro.

03:31:24.620 --> 03:31:25.620
Bye-bye.
