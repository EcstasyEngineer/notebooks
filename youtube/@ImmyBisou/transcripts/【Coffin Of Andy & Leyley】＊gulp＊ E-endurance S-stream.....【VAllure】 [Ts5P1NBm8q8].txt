Thank you for the $420
I hope you can hear me drink
But I am thankful
I'm just not like

That's the whole point of this
But I thank you for watching
And helping us get there
You know
So I'm happy that
You're the one watching
And helping us get monetized
But um
I've already been monetized before
So it's not like a huge accomplishment for me
If that doesn't make me sound like a bitch
I feel like it does

It's a big goal
And I'm happy that you helped us get there
Right
Thank you for the headpats too
Gay

Place down the plank wall
Still too high
Lift me up
Well no good
It's open but held in place by a latch
That's on the other side of the window
I might start muting to cough cause I know it's annoying
No good it's open
Damnit my fingers can't reach
Reach to unhook it
You go bitch
I'll push you up after you open the latch
You're just looking for an excuse to touch my ass
Okay two things
First of all no
Secondly like I need an excuse
Touch my ass
Tiny hands? What do you mean tiny hands?
Say for it should be something you would never say
Like I hate my brother
But I don't want to say that
I'm hurrying up and finding something
Before I slap you
Slab me
On my ass or the face
That melody I'll let you find out
Why are you acting so gay?
I love my little sister
I love my little sister too
I love my big brother
Thank you for the 420
The cops really add to the little sis vibe
Do they?
I feel like they're annoying
So it's the face

The rock
The rock
The carrot
A stick
Hi Amy how are you?
I'm okay
For now
Gen 2 leak
You know we actually saw the concept art for Gen 2
There's some interesting choices
Well we don't talk about Gen 2 yet
Gen 2 isn't even close to happening
Andrew helps you climb through the window
The open window
Give me your hand
I'll pull you up
Thanks but I much rather you just open a door for me
Oh yeah that would be easier
Ew why is the house so ransacked?
What happened?
Oh renovations
You turn the handle when the water comes out
Is this the door? No this is the door
Welcome welcome
Thank you not so fast
Now what do we say?
Thank you very much
Wrong try in
Exceptionally well done
That was an earth shattering performance
Yes to think you'd open a door so swiftly with such grace
Studying marvelous breathtaking
Those are but a few words
I'd use to describe your ability to trespass
May I come in now?
You better get the good ending
I'm trying
Take your hand bro stop fumbling
Not as romantic though
Wait what do you mean not as romantic
You may great let's split up
I want to get out of here as soon as fast as possible
Hey there was something I was worrying about
Right now can't it wait
Our situation is kind of sensitive
Well it can I guess
Good then tell me later
What you worried about
He's such a well trained big brother
He is
A fireplace
They have a goddamn fireplace Andrew
Yeah this is some rich people stuff
Who has a fireplace inside their house
It's not that uncommon is it
Not in older houses anyways
But is this
House old?
Fuck if I know
She's worried about that dream
You can train us like this in me
I totally will
The dresser is locked
Why is it locked?
Find the key
You don't even know
I don't know
I don't
Toys
Toys in a row
We should take those
Damn it
Is that all
Very tasteful living room
Did I go in this room
Oh yes
Check the closet
I did
Are you gay
Why are you looking so gay
Energy level is looking a bit too high
Thank you for the 420
It's not normal to do this
Without sibling
Do what without a sibling
Check the phone
Sorry if you hear some background noise
My rats won't stop drinking water
They're playing along with me
It's like the phone you never call
It's the phone your mom never calls you with
Notice how there aren't
Any photos of us here
So what
I guess I'm a little offended
It's not like there were any pictures in general
In our last place either
True
I need lip balm
Do I have it in here
Shit
My lips are dry
We love the rat ASMR
Also you can hear it
We have this part
What is this part
What is this part
I can moisturize them for you
So why
But doesn't moisturize them well enough
I need actual lip balm
But you can kiss them now
Now there are some
Why not of us too
Guess we're just too ugly to be put on display
Right maybe that's it
You're supposed to say I'm pretty
And you're supposed to be robbing the house
Get to it
A bunch of things to interact with
I am interacting with everything I can
I'm interacting with everything
It's the part where the thing happens
Wow okay
Thanks for letting me know I'm so excited for the thing
When the thing happens and the thing
I love it when things happen
In games
Oh the fridge
Not much in the fridge right now
Imagine if the parents came home
You are pretty good
I am
Why does the game
Why does the game OST sound like coffin dance
I don't know
I really like the opening though
Like when you're in the opening screen
I really like that music
There's like nothing to interact with
Who told who lied to me
And said there's a bunch of stuff to interact with
There's nothing
Are you pretty
It's not a question
Flip those two words around
And take off the question mark
It's you are pretty
Get it right
Check downstairs
Oh there's a downstairs
I didn't even see that
Why do they have a bed downstairs
Are you gay
Why are you acting so gay
You are pretty
Thank you for the 420
I am pretty
Yes
I am pretty
More training required
Yeah
Apparently you need to be like clicker trained or something
Like every time you get the compliment right
The prettiest
I mean it's so pretty
Keep saying it
Keep going
How much you are pretty
Very much or extra much
Whichever one is more
They've somehow managed to hoard all this stuff
In a spare bed to boot
Money is clearly no longer an issue
And the extra bed implies there are no issues
In their social life either
What does that mean
Are they swingers
Do they be swinging
String of lights
Metal box
A toilet
This one actually works
Are you gay
Why are you acting so gay
I love Emmys lemonade
Thank you for the 420
Are you gay
Why are you acting so gay
How about moan training instead of clicker training
Moan training
What is moan training

Today is payday so here is some allowance
For my cute little sister

The floor dream seems a little clogged
But it's not your problem
No, it's not my problem
An excellent quality mop
Okay
Dirty laundry right at the top sits some sexy lingerie
How uncomfortable
Why does it keep telling me
6 out of 10
I think both of those were like a 4 out of 10
Okay
Cleaning supplies such as vinegar
The more you guys tell me to hydrate it
It actually is helping my throat a little bit
I mostly just have to clear it now
A washing machine and a tumble dryer
Your parents have been living it up
Bro I don't even have a washing machine and a tumble dryer
Don't worry about me though
I just
I have like a small tiny washing machine
But I don't have a dryer
And sometimes I go to the laundromat too
Vinegar
Hello
Documents about purchasing a house

The sniffles are always the best
I haven't been sniffling have I
Have you considered drinking water for free
No
No
Why are you here
New and exciting hobbies
Tell me more
I don't think I will
But now it makes sense why mom kept hassling us to move out
They wanted to have sex
What's in there
No jewelry but some paperwork
It reads steer mister and mrs graves
You have opted in for compensation for damages caused by our company's error
Our representative will be glad to meet with you

At your earliest convenience
Why are you acting so gay
Thank you for the 333
I don't live in a cardboard box
I had to throw
I want to get like an actual like
Like the big ones
Which means I have to like move into an apartment
That already has it
That was my goal
To move into an apartment that has
A laundry
A laundry
A washing machine and a dryer
In-unit
In-unit, yeah
That means any
Pancu hung up
I hang my underwear
Because it's summer I hang it out to dry
It's out for the whole world to see it
I don't wash my hand, no
What's today's color?
That's a great question, I don't even know
Oh, it's um
It's black with a
Pink, purple, green and yellow butterflies
Okay, flipping through the folder
Something else catches your eye
It is the death certificate of Ashley and Andrew Graves
Cute
I didn't know he died 3 months ago
What the hell is this
I guess that explains why mom kept
Telling me not to call
It must have been spooky getting phone calls from a ghost
That's
I'm gonna need art of that later
Someone has entered the house
Oh shit, isn't it too early?
They shouldn't be home yet
You consider shooting whichever parent just came in
But you can't offer the souls of the dead
So you hold off on that idea
Is someone there?
Hi mom, it's just us
Andrew, what is wrong with you?
Don't do that, welcome home
Andrew
What are you doing here?
Why does the mom look so young?
Surprise, we came for a visit
Oh, I see
How are you home so early?
Did you get fired?
It's my day off
I was just out shopping
This is so awkward
Her name is Renee
Oh no, she's hot
Get away from my mother
Oh wait, no
Get away from our mother
It's my day off
I was just out shopping
How did you two get inside?
We broken
You left the door unlocked
You should really be more careful about that
She's 35?
She doesn't look 35
Did I really?
Hey, let me help you with those groceries
This is so weird
Thanks, you should have let me know
You were coming
How about some coffee?
Where do you keep the grounds?
In the top cupboard
But what about the quarantine?
Any milk in yours?
Sure, let me just go wash my face
Hag alert!
You guys think 35 is hag?
Some people age really well, I guess so
How old are the kids?
I don't know, it's a villainess, they don't say
Yeah, he is acting weird
30 is hag
Hag is 40 plus
Yeah, I always felt like hag should be like 40
If I want an old vtuber
I want her to be like my mom's age
Cause I think that's like
That's old
Calling my mom old
And vtubing 30 plus
In Japan it's like 25
In Japan it's like 25
That's so depressing
Andy is like 22 and Ashley is like 20
I believe
I saw some people trying to guess my own age
Some people genuinely think I'm like
Actually pretty old
Do I sound old?
I thought it was obvious
That I'm like a tiktok zoomer
You three
I've been actually drinking water out of my own volition
This is not good
Sure, let me go wash my face
What the hell are you doing?
Just play along for now please
Guess I'll make some coffee
This isn't good
You're 23? I'm not 23
Meat wine
Looks like your fans had a night planned
You sound 18
I'm not 18
Make sure to stay hydrated
I'll thank you for the 420
We didn't know who Nigel Thornberry was
So he can't be that old
Yeah I had to look up who Nigel Thornberry was
Is he from the Rugrats or something?
I'm not sure
Um, you brew some coffee
So I saw the fire on the news
What happened?
Why do you care?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I was informed that a certain darling little sister needed this
Thank you for the 420
Rugrats?
The Wild Thornberries?
Wait, he's not from the Rugrats?
Same production company
Close enough
Yeah, close enough
I haven't heard of the Wild Thornberries
Going down and talking to Rene as Ashley
in the basement has interesting responses
No, not Rugrats
Oh, sorry
I didn't even watch the Rugrats
But that's just because I didn't have cable TV
Pickles is Rugrats
Well first we got evacuated
After that they gave us the go ahead to leave
Since we've been cleared of the parasites anyway
Interesting
Oh this bitch is so
Guilty
She's so guilty
On the news they said everyone died
That would certainly make the story sell more
Anyway, here we are
Neither burnt nor full of parasites
I'm just glad you're safe
No, she's not
Yeah, you sure look like it
So um
Quite the upgrade from our previous place, huh?
She's not guilty
I remember some people want an option to smash the mob
Jail
Jail, rope, noose
Use it, oh my god
Put your head through the loop
And kick the bucket
Where'd you get the money for this place?
Did you finally win the lottery?
Huh, I wish
This house needs some serious repairs
But the area is so worth it, don't you think?
The perfect non-answer
They even hold barbecue events here
With the neighbors
And it's not a happy scene
Sister is okay but mother's note
Yes
Exactly, that's it
You got it right
Barbecue events just like on TV
I thought that was all bullshit
But no, they actually do that stuff here
Why are you acting so gay?
Thank you for the 6-9
My favorite letter

Yea

Oh
But you stick out like a sore thumb
You'd be surprised
I'm actually quite well liked
Oh, it's probably all thanks to my cooking skills
It's a shame
Where I actually didn't hear any
Mother plus daughter
Oh, yako-don is mom and daughter at the same time
user at the same time, struggles
family reunion meal

I don't suppose you've gotten any friends you could go stay with?
Oh. There isn't enough space in this house.
Despite being far larger than the last one.
And you're both already in your 20s.
I don't know how else to say it.
No, no, it's...
Yeah, we're not fucking planning on living here. Thanks for the invitation, though.
It's not like you're unwelcome to visit.
There's just no room to keep housing you indefinitely.
Yeah, I get it.
I don't got no drip.
You don't hear no drip. You're not hearing a drip.
I'm not drippy.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Shower, shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.
Shower, shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.
Shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.
Shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.
Sorry, I'll drink.
I'm gonna need to get more water soon.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
That's funny because I heard a drip.
Thank you for the 420. You didn't hear it from me.
But since you're already here, I guess one night won't be a problem.
We need to start looking for somewhere else to stay first thing in the morning.
And...
Dude, she knows.
And it should probably be two separate places.
Dude, she knows.
She knows. She's onto us.
There's a tall order after all our earthly...
Sorry, sometimes I just have to take a break.
Sometimes I just have to take a break.
It's like getting in waves.
I get it in waves.
There's a tall order after all our earthly possessions just burn to the ground.
That's a tall order. Sorry, that's a tall order.
It's amazing what money can buy once you have a job.
Speaking of which, I have a morning shift tomorrow.
There's a spare bed in the basement.
Andrew, you can take the couch.
Alright, good night. Good night.
Well, aren't you going to bed?
I'm not that tired yet, so you are under my roof right now.
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?
If you need a break, why not a water break?
Thank you for the 420.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
The water flows over the falls, the waves crash into the shore, the rain drips off the leaves.
Thank you for the tip.
You're under my roof right now and you'll go to your designated sleeping areas immediately.
Sleep now or get out at once.
Damn, what a bitch!
Going to sleep is the worst.
I'm going to sleep at once.
I'm going to sleep at once.
I'm going to sleep at once.
Going to sleep is the worst.
During the day, all the noise and Ashley's never ending bullshit keeps your mind occupied.
At night, alone with your thoughts, there's nothing to distract you from yourself.
Despite having every intention of going to pick a fight with Ashley, you drift off to sleep.
Oh shit!
We're in a dream!
The freezer isn't full of human meat.
Remember how Andrew needs Ashley to hold him to sleep?
Oh, he has nightmares!
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
This is definitely going to awaken something in at least one person here.
Thank you for the $1.
Bro, it's awakened something in me.
Okay, I run out of water.
I'm going to go get more. I promise I won't.
I won't go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'm back.
She's not going to make it.
I'm going to make it.
I'll make it.
Why are you acting so gay?
P-S-B-S-B-S-B-S-P-S
I did not, I did not, I did not go to the bathroom, I um...
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Sorry about the water sip, but do you have any tea for your cold?
Uh...
I don't...
Are you gay?
Oh my god!
Why are you acting so gay?
Thanks for holding it in until now, I'm so proud of you.
One...
Two...
Three...
Um...
I wanna keep the energy at all right, I wanna keep it at the all right level for now.
I might, I might go down soon though.
It's worse when I'm moving, like when I'm walking it gets worse.
Okay...
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
When I'm sitting down it's okay.
Greetings neighbor.
Have thou arrived to borrow sweet granules of sugar?
Behold, as thou may witness not, but flesh doth I possess to present unto thee.
All ghosts are apparently required to speak like this,
yes, even the recently passed ones, you read too much poetry.
Ah, he reads poetry, that's cute.
How much for a laugh around the room?
I don't wanna say too much, I don't want people to get mad at me for saying a large amount.
Also my room is very small.
I'll say ten dollars if you want me to...
Here, I'll say fifteen dollars if you want me to go a whole lap around my entire apartment there.
I'll do a...
Oh, or jumping jacks.
You can choose which one you want.
Yeah, the same amount cause...
Maybe, maybe smaller, smaller.
Okay, fifteen dollars for a lap around my apartment, ten dollars for jumping jacks.
There you go.
You read too much poetry.
Be alert, young Mr. Graves.
It is time for you to compartmentalize.
Rookie mistake?
Why?
Yeah, five jumping jacks for ten dollars.
There.
Jumping jacks are worse, no?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
One lap around the room.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Easy.
Okay, I'll do the jumping jacks first.
One dollar will just get...
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I'm singing in the rain.
Just singing in the rain what a glorious feeling I'm happy again.
Are you gay?
Stop!

How about both?
Thank you for the hundred dollars.
Okay, I'll do...
What am I supposed to do for a hundred?
How about I do twenty jumping jacks there?
Twenty jumping jacks and then I'll run around the apartment.
And when I say apartment, I mean I have to leave the room, but yeah.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
This is gonna be a workout stream now.
Okay.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
Did I say twenty?
I think I said twenty.
I'm gonna go for a run now.
Excuse me while I go run around.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why but running is worse.
Running is like way worse.
I brought chocolate bars though.
You need five more?
Five more jumping jacks?
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Gotta make sure to stay hydrated while exercising.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Pour me make sure you drink plenty of water after having that major workout.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Well after exercising you definitely need to hydrate a bit.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
How about some more exercise for my sweet sister?
I don't even remember what I was supposed to do.
It's $15 a jumping jacks.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Are you holding it like a good girl?
Yes.
Yes.
I am.
$15 was running?
$15 for a walk?
Okay.
I'll just do more.
I'll do it all again.
I don't remember.
I'm so bad at memorizing what I said.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Imagine the relief.
Okay.
Five more jumping jacks and then I'll run around.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
I'll be right back.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Sweat the piss out to me.
I'll be right back.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Sweat the piss out to me.
Did I get another jumping jack donation?
I guess I'll do it again.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Okay.
That's it.
That's all.
I'm not doing any more of the $10.
I'm not doing any more of the $10 or the $15 ones.
You could donate $10 or $15 but I'm not doing any more.
My energy level is no longer all right.
Why are you acting so gay?
I'm sorry for asking about the lamp but not really.
This is fun.
Thank you for the 20.
I'm now at EEC.
We're only an hour and 22 minutes and I'm now at EEC.
We're at EEC levels.
I ran around the apartment, not the room.
I have more than just my room.
I brought chocolate.
Are we bullying you too much?
It's okay.
That's your job.
That's your job as my brother to bully me.
You don't live in a closet?
No, I don't.
What chocolate?
Right.
I'm eating Marco Polo.
It's one of my favorite chocolate brands.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good girl.
Thank you.
Okay.
It's time for you to compartmentalize.
Oh shit, my mouse isn't on the...
Why did it disappear?
What the hell?
EEC.
There.
Okay.
Take you for the head pass.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I wish we could be jumping together.
What do you mean jumping together?
What do you mean by that?
Jumping together.
Okay.
What's going on?
Got a limb.
Oh, do I have to collect all the limbs?
I think you know.
Explain it to me.
Isn't it so sexy when I dirty talk with a mouthful of chocolate?
Alright, Ashley already cooked one.
What?
What is going?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I hope we'll hold until the end of the game.
Good luck.
I want to.
Thank you for the tip.
I want to hold, but if you guys keep doing this, I don't know.
Okay.
Do we have to find candles?
Is that Lele?
I don't answer.
I don't care.
You're not supposed to exist anymore.
It says who you.
You're not the boss of me, Andy.
Forget this.
Huh?
Do not hurt little Lele.
I won't.
Stop following me around, you little shit.
Where do I go?
Oh, it sure is dark that way.
Good thing I have these candles.
Great, hand them over.
No.
Kill her?
Kill her?
Kill her?
No, I won't, I won't, I won't.
No, I won't, I won't, I won't ask nicely.
May I have one of the candles please?
Nope.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
If you can't just go in your piss drawer, I know you have one.
Piss drawer?
Piss drawer?
I feel like that's some kind of fucking reddit story.
Like how, like the cum, what was it?
It was the cum shoebox, right?
Or some guy came in a shoebox like over and over again,
like every time he came, he came in that specific shoebox.
You know what I'm talking about?
I don't have a piss drawer.
We have different reddits?
Unfortunately, yes.
Okay, some of you guys know.
I only have so many left.
If my lemon muffin has no candles,
I can't pretend it's a cake anymore.
Just eat it.
That way you can pretend you ate the cake
and you don't need candles anymore.
Whatcha eating?
I'm eating chocolate.
This is my last one, though.
Yeah, the coconut story, too.
Here's the coconut story
where he fucked the coconut and he, like,
he, like, fucked the same coconut
and he kept it under his bed, I think.
And then he, like, looked inside one day
and it was filled with maggots.
And he kept it under his bed, I think.
And then he, like, looked inside one day
and it was filled with maggots.
Come, canut.
Okay, anyway.
It's too precious to eat.
God, you're such a tool today.
Okay, whatever.
Come, warm and squishy on the inside.
Don't be gross.
Mmm.
Where do I go?
Where am I supposed to-
Oh!
Okay, well, that did nothing.
You're welcome.
You familiar with kazu marzu?
No, I don't know what that is.
Mmm.
The face tracking is not good
because it's showing me
eating with my mouth open like a slob.
Every time I'm eating with my mouth open,
I'm like,
I'm not actually eating with my mouth open
like that.
My mouth is closed.
But for some reason,
it tracks it as if my mouth is open.
Maybe because my teeth are open
and my mouth is not open.
I'm not actually eating with my mouth open
like that.
My mouth is closed.
But for some reason,
my mouth is open.
Maybe because my chin is moving?
I don't know.
No, I don't actually eat like that.
I have chocolate all over my fingers.
Okay.
Ooh, new room!
No, I want to go to that room.
Huh?
How do we get there?
Is it tracking your sound?
I don't know.
It's tracking both the sound and my mouth.
How do I get there?
Oh.
What the fuck?
Ah, fuck, coughing sucks.
I don't like it.
I don't like how coughing feels right now.
What?
What am I supposed to do here?
Try going right from that path.
Right?
I can't.
It won't let me.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Some water should help with your cough.
Thank you for the 420.
The bottom one.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
The bottom one.
It won't let me go right.
Oh, oh.
Oh.
Oh, it's still on.
Why is it so frustrating like this?
Oh.
Oh, there we go.
White noise.
Even in your dreams, the entertainment sucks.
It's supposed to frustrate you.
Okay.
Huh?
So what do you want to play today?
Nothing.
Go to bed.
Fuck, I have to cough.
Every time I cough, I feel it, bro.
Boring.
I don't care.
Go to sleep and never wake up again.
I don't want to sleep.
I want to draw.
Draw, then.
Just don't leave the spot.
I can't draw without my coloring pencils.
Well, if I nick myself, I can get red.
I'll get youth pencils.
Thanks, Andy, you're the best.
Where am I supposed to find coloring pencils?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Relaxed.
Loose.
Relieved.
No.
I am tensed up.
Stressed.
And pent up.
Light the candle?
Okay.
Oh, oh, I didn't even see that.
I was like, what happened with the candle?
Oh, it's this thing.
Okay.
Talk to Ashley once again.
Oh.
Better get the colored pencils for her chop chop.
Okay.
Oh, I can't believe you didn't say tight.
I am tight there.
Is that what you want?
Can I go down this way?
Oh, oh, thank you for making it easy.
Someone stares inside the room with an unblinking gaze.
Colored pencils.
Is that mom?
Julia?
You've been quiet all day. What's up?
Oh, no, it's nothing.
Or actually I've been thinking about something a lot.
Is this his ex-girlfriend?
Check the phone at least three times.
There are things to interact with beside the girl.
Oh, okay.
Voice mail and imagine you sent them.
Okay, okay, I'll check the phone. Thank you.
I don't know if I should bring it up.
With that much build up, you kind of have to now.
Well, okay, but please don't get mad.
When have I ever even raised my voice with her?
You know you can tell me anything.
That face doesn't look like a face I could tell anything.
I talked to my sister about what you said the other day.
And she agrees with me that maybe it's like maybe it'd be better for Ashley to learn some independence.
Even if it's just for her own sake, you know.
What?
And maybe for our sake too?
What?
I think it'd be nice if you could stay over more often
and not like always cut things short or cancel on me so much.
Sorry.
I'm not reprimanding you.
I can't make her learn anything though.
Julia kind of snack?
No, I don't think so.
She's gotta go.
Even laughing.
This is his ex.
Okay, okay, okay.
If your sister needs something, wouldn't you go?
Well, yes, but she only asks if she actually needs something.
I suppose.
Sorry, maybe I shouldn't have said that or brought this up after all.
No, no, it's fine.
Finally home from work.
Hello.
Um, yeah.
Ashley is way better.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, let's keep going.
Um.
Um, I guess I'm still shook up over what happened to your friend way back then.
Ashley might not look like it,
but I think it affected her a lot too.
So that's probably why she is how she is.
I really don't get that impression at all.
For someone so obnoxious, she's surprisingly difficult to read.
Isn't she?
Yeah, Emmys better, Emmys better than this fucking.
What's her name?
I don't even remember.
I don't remember what her name was.
Julia.
Julia.
Yeah.
I don't know Julia, only Emmys.
Oh fuck.
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
No, nothing go on.
Anyways, I worry.
I worry about something like that happening to her or happening to you.
Ew, cringe, get this off of my fucking screen.
It'll be fine if you're with me.
Ah, would you tie your hair up for me?
Interesting.
Oh heck no, you'll pull on it again.
Fuck man, I wanna get excited so badly right now.
But don't you know it's how boys show their love?
Well that's just awful.
I suppose she still lingers.
I'm like really rocking in my chair right now, oh my god.
It hasn't been that long, I just kind of forgot about her with all the chaos going on.
Mostly death threats.
The phone, the phone, where's the phone?
Photos and notes of your girlfriend's churches.
The phone.
Yeah, he's a hair puller.
You have 127 new voicemails.
Oh hell no, you are not listening to all that.
Yes we are!
I don't know what your fucking problem is.
The audio has been distorted but you'd recognize that voice anywhere.
I told you to fuck off, I warned you.
Do you think you're all that?
Do you think you're somehow special?
Ah, should I voice this?
I'm gonna end up pissing myself if I do.
You're just another whole.
You're not even the only one.
He's got a slew of flusies just like you.
Enjoy what you have because you're well on your way out by now.
The only reason he's with you is because he feels sorry for you.
You're just some ugly cunt with a dead best friend.
Hurry up and kill yourself!
And when you get to hell, ask your friend what happened to her.
I can't laugh, I can't laugh, I wanna laugh.
I wanna laugh.
Bet you'd be, you'd be so surprised.
Fucking die you worthless piece of shit.
Oh, you worthless piece of shit, go slit your wrists some more.
And this time do it proper.
Do you think you're better than me?
Just because you can fuck him and I can't?
Damn.
You think that's love?
Are you fucking delusional?
Come dumpsters like you are just...
Okay, hold on.
Give me like, give me like...
Give me like, fuck.
Okay, give me like, give me like 10 seconds, hold on.
Wait a minute.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Take your time.
I really wanna tell you to off yourself right now.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Give you what?
Are you gay?
Stop!
Why are you acting so gay?
Break the dam, release the river.
You should go jump off a bridge in Minecraft.
Not like you loves me.
I'm the only one.
I'm everything.
I'm the secrets you'll never hear.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Drip drips platter.
Stop!
When he lies in bed at night and when he needs someone to hold on to, it's not you he seeks out.
It's me.
It's your ex-livers dormitory room.
Okay, I have to change it.
I have to change it.
We're no longer in eek territory.
We're no longer in eek territory.
We're getting low.
I know I'm so sorry it's only been two hours.
Why are you acting so gay?
Have you ever been to the Aquarium Mimmy?
It's fun seeing all the gallons and gallons of water sloshing around.
No.
No, I've never been to the Aquarium and I don't wanna go.
No, we're not doing a poll yet.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Anon, I think she might just broken the dam during the mute.
I mean just look at that cute atomic blush across her cheeks.
I didn't, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't break the dam.
I didn't break the dam.
Tell us how you're feeling.
I feel like I can't describe it in detail on YouTube.
I feel very full.
That's, that's how I feel.
Yeah.
On a scale of 1 to 10, dude, 9.
Tweet it?
What do you hope to find?
What do you hope to find in there?
And the fact that it doesn't really bother you bothers you.
I wanted to finish the game today.
I wanted to finish it.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Imagine how good it will feel to let go though.
Stop.
You're just trying.
You're just trying.
Dude, it's literally, it hasn't even been two hours.
Right.
Layla, her crayons.
You're really going to have to hold my hand a lot for the next few parts of the game until we end because I'm really struggling.
Thank you.
What should I draw?
I wouldn't want to hinder your artistic genius with my bad ideas.
Good call.
As a thank you, I'll give you a candle.
Treat it carefully as if it were me.
I'm lighting it on fire.
Not cool.
That slams for you.
Boo, you suck.
Can I wait, hold on.
I'm putting on the crying emoji because that's what I fucking feel right now.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Jimmy, you're such a good girl putting out with us.
I know, I am.
You don't deserve me.
Okay.
Okay.
How about this?
How about this?
Because I want to finish the game.
Or at least get further than I actually am.
I won't end the stream if I go to the bathroom.
I'll just keep going and you can tell me to keep drinking and we'll do it all over again.
Okay?
We'll just keep doing it over and over again.
Because I kind of...
I kind of want to...
I don't want to...
Is that okay?
Double endurance as long as it takes me.
To at least get close to ending the game.
You know?
I want to start a bowl.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Hi, Ami.
Are you planning to open up memberships soon?
Yes, tomorrow.
There's your bowl.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
We don't deserve you at all.
So thank you for being here, little sister.
Or in chart.
Or in chart.
Why are 56% saying no?
Oh my god.
Five more minutes?
I'm not recording.
I'm not fucking recording.
Wait.
I'm gonna pin that one.
Ah dude, it's not...
Just a little longer.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
We can drink and refill the lemonade.
You have to incentivize?
I'm...
No matter what I'm not recording.
Okay, I'll end the poll.
I'll keep going for a little longer.
Are you gay?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Stop!
The other Twitter account exists for a reason.
If we get a surprise post then I'm sure we'll vote yes.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I know my little sister can hold it a little longer.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good girl, just a little longer and you can go.
This is literally blackmail.
What do I do?
What do I do right now?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Those are some cute moans, Imi.
You holding up okay?
Yes.
Yes, I am good.
What do I do? Please tell me what to do.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Anticipate the release.
No, no, I'm not anticipating shit.
Anticipate these nuts.
Put the candle in the candle holder.
Oh my god.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You got this, Imi.
Databayo.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I have this.
I have this.
Ashley would have wanted to kill this one anyways.
You couldn't leave any witnesses after all.
Still you can't comprehend why there hasn't been...
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Please tell us if there's any leaking.
There's no leakage.
There's no leakage.
Surely someone found her before the fire burned the apartment down.
Is there an investigation going on?
Can this be linked back to you?
Other than that, it doesn't bother you.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Other than that, it doesn't bother you.
This one you had to get before he got you.
It worries...
It worries you someone wanted you dead this...
Uh...
It worries you someone wanted you dead badly enough to hire this guy.
You killed this one to protect Ashley, no regrets?
Back when he and his buddies still fed you, this one was always...
This one was always leering at her.
Never mind, there's one regret.
You wish you could have killed him sooner.
I don't wanna beg.
I don't want to.
That's so cringe.
You won't get me too.
There you are, you menace.
Tada!
I'm missing the one you cooked.
I figured you'd have it.
It's in your stomach, right?
And mine?
Are you going to cut me up to get it?
I'd rather not.
What do you need it for anyways?
There's plenty of limbs right behind you.
That's true.
That's true.
Okay.
Yeah, well, before was different.
Before was not as embarrassing.
Be...
Be...
Be possessive of the absolute...
Lim.
Yeah, it thought not long to me for a chance to have a little...
Consequence to the...
Oh my god, I can't laugh.
Place a limb in the freezer.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
Oh my god.
Dude, it's starting to throb.
Oh my god.
Is it here?
Am I supposed to get this last one?
Uh...
Oh.
That's...
I reckon that my mortal...
Uh, frame was consumed...
By the flames for...
Forsooth, I do not...
Need things...
Need...
Need...
Need...
I gotta cough.
How fuck?
I'm not coughing, I'm not coughing, I'm not coughing.
Me thinks the innards of a freezer doth...
Do...
Do not...
Doth...
Not combust per chance and may cook, but to...
Bro, the words...
The words are coming out of my mouth, but I'm not computing right now.
Um, me...
Me thinks the innards of a freezer doth not combust per...
Per...
Per chance it may cook, but to burn, I know it's not.
Uh...
Uh, verily...
Verily, the most foolish deed thou hast ever committed
was to leave mine own remains in thine own dwelling.
Praise the heavens that some soul sought to protect themselves
and kindled a flame which engulfed all.
What the fuck is he talking about?
I don't wanna do it, I'm not doing it, I'm not begging.
This reminds me of something.
You can't make me...
What's going on?
Are you gay?
Oh fuck you.
Chat, I'm heading to the bathroom real quick, BRB.
Stop!
Okay, um...
Thy first sh...
Thy first shell forever linger in thy memory.
Oh how...
Stop!
Shut up!
Don't say that.
Hi chat, I'm gonna go pee, go...
I hope you fall in the toilet.
What do I do?
Oh my god.
What do I do?
What do I do?
The freezer?
Okay.
I don't...
It doesn't...
You bag, shut up!
I went in the...
I went in the game.
The chest.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Oh fuck.
Why are you acting so gay?
This is getting good.
Dude.
I'm gonna do another fall.
Oh god.
I don't know how long it's been since the last one, but I have to.
I won't end the stream, don't worry, but...
I don't wanna beg though.
I don't wanna beg.
I'm not gonna do it.
That's all you'll get.
You'll get that shitty plaz.
Plaz.
Oh shit, it's so close.
Oh my god.
Gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
NSFW Twitter.
Remember it.
Not recording it.
No.
Fuck.
Okay.
Ah!
Oh my god.
Ah!
Okay.
Did you have a fun night?
I'm sure you...
I sure hope you learned your lesson.
There's no answer.
I guess she's still sleeping.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good girl.
You're doing so great.
This ain't fun anymore.
It's fun to me.
It's okay if it's not for you.
You can go catch another stream, but it's fun to me.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I know I look like I'm struggling, but I promise you I'm having fun.
I'm having so much...
I'm having so much fun right now.
Yeah, stop being a little pussy.
It's okay.
Lily kicks the crate.
Wake up, sleepyhead.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Sleush.
Come on, don't.
You open the crate.
Oh, she's dead in there.
Oh my god.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Oh fuck.
Why are you acting so gay?
See, she's enjoying thinking about toilets and faucets and dripping water.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Shut up, Grinit.
Just enjoy the bratty sister's dream.
Are you gay?
Stop!
Why are you acting so gay?
Please!
Only one way out.
Just a few simple words.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good to know I was starting to feel bad.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Stop!
Please!
Just a pair of words and all your problems will flush away me.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, let me go, please.
Please, I'll even...
Are you gay?
I won't record it, but I'll say Big Brother.
Please, Big Brother, let me go, please, please, please, please, please.
Good girl.
I'm happy you're enjoying it.
Please!
You're certainly not the only one enjoying it.
Your moans are very cute.
Are you gay?
Oh my god, please.
Why are you acting so gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You can hug on a little longer, can't you?
Are you gay?
Oh my god, stop!
Why are you acting so gay?
She loves that only her brother has access to the toilets.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I wonder for exactly how long the pressure of all the liquid trying to break containment has been having other effects on Little League yummy.
Are you gay?
Oh my god!
Why are you acting so gay?
That toilet in the other room.
It's beckoning you.
Okay, it's a yes, right?
It's a yes.
Please say yes.
It's a yes.
I can go right...
Are you gay?
Oh my god!
Why are you acting so gay?
Think of your big brother and...
You're really pushing me for the last minute, aren't you?
Okay.
Are you gay?
Stop!
Why are you acting so gay?
I'm going!
I'm going!
I'll be right back!

Why are you acting so gay?
Don't act like a brat after we were nice to you.
You weren't nice though.
Are you gay?
Oh my god, it just keeps going.
Yes, I am.
I'm sorry for the weirdos here.
What do you mean?
I'm part of them.
We're all weirdos here.
We're definitely too soft.
Yeah, you were a little...
You kind of gave in a little quickly there, didn't you?
I don't know, I feel like you went a little fast.
You kind of...
You're a little too easy.
Okay.
Uh-uh.
Okay.
Wait, wait, what?
Why is she dead?
How did...
Wait, what?
That can't be right.
What's going on?
Whatever.
If you're so weak that you died just like that,
then clearly nature doesn't want you to live.
I'm not a brat, I'm just telling you how it is.
Oh this brat.
Angry, angry, angry, crying face.
Get hydrated.
Are you gay?
Oh my god, what?
Good girl.
See?
Begging always works out for big brother,
but it can't be helped.
You're just too cute.
Now with that, let's get around to started properly.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Thank you so much.
I hope you didn't leave a trail when you went,
but now I know not to go easy
on you little brat you need correcting.
Gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Start drinking, angry.
I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking.
Yeah, they're really going crazy.
Okay.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Noted, we won't be as merciful next time.
I'm sure you'll give in just as easily next time.
I'm sure you will.
You can't help yourself when it comes to me.
Okay, if you're so weak that you died just like that,
then clearly nature doesn't want you to live.
Why are you acting so gay?
Shut up, just shut up.
Let's get through that second bottle.
Okay, forget this.
Let's just sleep right here.
Lesson learned.
No pissing for the next four hours.
Four.
Four?
You're not gonna make it to four.
Are you enjoying this?
Yes?
Are you not?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good job sis.
Thank you.
Okay, since you took the stick off,
it looks like she went there on her own anyways.
No, it doesn't.
Why would she have clawed at the crate
until her fingernails...
until her fingernails split if she was there willingly?
Oh well.
It's not like anyone knows she's here.
Let's just leave her.
No, it'll start rotting.
And someone will come looking in front of her.
Why are you acting so gay?
I love my little sister.
I love my big brother.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
No more pissing this stream
that you're gonna need to beg proper to go.
I did though. I did.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Oh my god.
We will remember.
Good.
Remember.
Is there a punishment for you
if you go without permission?
I won't go without permission.
Let's just hide it then.
Huh?
If no one knows then it's not a problem.
They're gonna know, Lele.
We'll find the body and they'll know.
And then they'll throw me in prison for the rest of my life.
Me too.
It's fine if it's the both of us.
No, you fucking idiot.
You don't get it, do you?
Guys and girls don't go to the same prison.
They're going to take you away from me.
Oh, he doesn't want me to go.
That's so sweet.
How is I supposed to know that?
You figure something out then.
Oh, you figure something out then since you're so smart.
Okay, okay, let's just...
Um, like, move her somewhere.
Yes, agree, let's dig up a grave for her.
Alright, where?
Anywhere in the forest should be fine.
I mean, there's a park right outside.
Yeah, there's probably fine.
But first we need to wrap her up in something.
Because no one can see us carry her there.
This tarp.
This tarp.
This will have to do.
You wrap Nina's corpse inside the tarp and carry her away.
I couldn't find a shovel, but I figured these wooden planks work.
I mean, they're kind of shovel-y.
Just watch for splinters.
Splinters are the least of my worries right now.
Let's pick a good easy-to-dig spot.
Got a wooden plank.
They are so cute.
They're so cute, I say, as they're, you know,
burying a corpse that they just murdered.
You'd help me bury a body?
Aw, thank you.
Okay, maybe here.
There doesn't seem to be any roots in the way.
I'm tired.
Yeah, this is way harder than I thought it would be.
Isn't this steep enough already?
A grave should be six feet, right?
Forget it, she fits here just fine.
Okay, fine.
Put her in!
Roll her in.
Push the body into its grave.
Cover her up.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You're so cute.
Thank you, I am cute.
I'm gonna have to get more water soon.
Crap, this doesn't look...
Crap, this doesn't look natural at all.
Looks fine to me.
No, there can't be this obvious of a spot.
It needs to be hidden too.
Why not hide it with some leaves and such?
This isn't gonna work, we're gonna get caught.
More foliage?
This one.
Is this enough?
More?
Greedy?
Is that enough?
Yeah, this looks so much better, huh?
Also, this is getting blown away by the next breeze.
I'm drinking along, this is pretty hard.
It is!
This little brat needs correcting.
Okay, I ran out of water, I'll go get more.
This is the first time we ever heard her name though.
It was always blinked up before.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
You're right.
Okay, BRB.
I should take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I should take my nasty wrappers with me too.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna take this one.

okay
there's got to be something in here to hold them in place
oh rock
rock
other rock
put it on the body
nice
makes me want to write her name on it
out of the question
I wasn't going to, I was just saying
what is it now
she's heading
don't worry imi you'll always be my favorite yandere
thank you
what if they find her
what if a police dog takes her up
listen forget it
I can't
of course you can
did you know that if you don't know
did you know that if you don't think about something
for a really long time
it's like it never happened
because you can't remember it anymore
wow real
put it in the vault
let's forget
let's forget all about it
lately I need to know
you won't say anything to anyone
are you gay?
why are you acting so gay
I'll go back in the cage later
just playing with little sisaran
I'm going to put you in the cage myself
you think I won't?
don't tell me I will
promise me this day is between us
I just said we'll forget all about it
you say one thing and do another
promise me that this time
you'll honest to god keep your mouth shut
promise
I will
oh I will
I'll make it worse in the cage
um
I won't say anything
I'll never even say her name again
what was it anyways
I don't remember anymore
oh she forgot it that's why
oh they're there it'll be fine
just kidding
I'm going to tell on you
if you won't do what I say
I'll tell everyone all about what you did
who's going to play with you if I'm in jail
I'll send you letters
I can't read your crappy handwriting
the cage is quite comfy once you get used to it
oh yeah the cage is comfy compared to what I'm going to do to you
she'll never say anything again
mmm that makes sense
that makes sense
um guess you'll just have to do
what I say then
guess you'll be all alone in prison
I'm your best friend from now on
you already were Lily
don't lie to me
are you gay?
why are you acting so gay
put me in the cage and pull on my leash
little sis I've been a bad dog
I will
if that's what you want
but you know
don't get mad at me if I start doing a little more
because you asked for it okay
okay
whatever it's you and me now
no one else will like you
because you're bad
she's going to beg you
oh yeah I will
and it won't be two inches
it won't be two inches
that's for sure
I'm kidding don't worry
you're a bad person Andy
but I won't tell anyone
of course not
you'll be in trouble too
so what no one likes me anyways
um that's fine
because you'll be around now
are you gay?
why are you acting so gay
how much do I gotta pay to get put in the cage
it's for free don't worry
you just have to misbehave
and I'll put you in the cage
I can't tell if these are retracted
or removed messages
I think some stuff is getting deleted
because I'm being a little sussy right now
the whole three inch more
more
you stay away from my bum
I'll stay away from your bum
if you behave
okay anyways
god you stupid stupid girl
you've been you've been here this whole time
none of this needs to happen
okay just
I know you don't like me
Andy I know
but that doesn't matter anymore
because from now on no one will like you either
is the cage at least padded on the floor
no why would I do that
why would I pad it
the point of the cage is to be a punishment
why would I pad it why would I make it comfortable
the point is that you're you know you're sad in there
and you want me to let you out
it's supposed to be like you know conditioning you
are you gay
why are you acting so gay
how much to finish the bottle
I can't I can't I can't
I can't
I have to do it slowly
I'm not trying to get water poisoning here
yeah the point is
you know when you're alone in that cage you're sad
and anytime I come
and let you out you get happy
so that way you associate me with happy feelings
happy feelings
yeah
anyways uh so let's be
let's always be friends okay
be my friend or else
sigh
damn bro she's blackmailing him
I thought it was just to make sure
I don't go into the neighbors garden again
that too but don't worry
the doors and the windows are locked for that
I'll be whatever you want me to be
really
then from now on let's always
be together
you had a million things you wanted to say to this creature
none of which were pleasant
but absolutely nothing came out of your mouth
several days
aren't you gay
why are you acting so gay
3 inches
impressive
I'd expect no less from my cute sister
sigh
shut up it's more than that

in strawberry ice cream is gross
I wish there was no jam
oh my gosh she's just like me I hate jam
emi is the only drug anyone needs
exactly
emi before you go through this
apartment scene check the balcony for
a revealing scene
okay
has anyone asked you about things
yeah my teacher asked everyone in class
some officers came by too
and did you say anything
nope I only asked julia if she was expecting to see anyone the other day
why
you know because a certain someone told her mom
she went to study with julia
so I thought maybe she told julia she was
gonna come see you instead
wait well did she
I don't know because I didn't want to just come out and ask
okay wait the plot is confusing me
julia said she was visiting family that day
so I doubt she had any idea
your promises mean fucking nothing
huh why are you being so cold to me
you're worse than you were before jackass
I gave you my ice cream
yeah I'm a jackass
wait I see how it is
you're still pining for that bitch

Anders is Andrew
sigh
I'll see what they've got for me at the unemployment office
great toxin
is that it is that what you wanted
bro was prepared
ugh you should have jumped
your success story is such an inspiration to us all
before starting your soda company
you used to be a surgeon isn't that right
that's right mark I am actually a doctor
so trust me one can
one can of toxa soda a day keeps me
far far away
even
when even a doctor tells me to indulge how can I not
surely it's only up from here
what plans do you have for the future
well first of all with such a great demand
comes a great need for
water
which is why I've partnered up
with several water distribution companies
I hope this is the start of a long lasting friendship
where the people on TV
rank on and on you're relieved there's absolutely nothing
about dead girls being found
hmm
I mean it's time to drink
what no one told me to
is that what you wanted me to see
check the table
oh shit

allegedly came from the contaminated water

don't let her off so easy next time
brothers
they will, I'll make sure they do
have fun at work
and you and Lele are learning from experience
I am a good girl
ok briefly you wonder if killing her would be worth it
I'm gonna make a blood oath with you
sex
but in return you'll have to promise me something too
ok
keep my secret and I'll keep you company
and what if I don't
are you ok
why are you acting so gay
just one more
ok
you're all bark you wouldn't do anything
if you'll ruin my life anyways
what reason is there for me to keep up appearances
moreover I'm doing this for you
then what happens if you break the promise
if you won't
I'm not buying that
Lele you're a miserable loathsome being
that has warmed its way into every aspect of my life
hell yeah I am
and for that my heart will always
have a rotten moldy sore spot just for you
make up about what you wrote
why are you acting so gay
one more
ok one more
I am ok
oh my god
why are you acting so gay
do it
pack gently you asshole
how does one cut someone gently
a better man would know
whatever
oh my god

gay
only as long as you keep your eyes on me
one more after that I mean
oh ok
one more
I wish you liked her lips after that she probably did
let no hussy steal your gays it's just us now
I said I'd be around
I never said there wouldn't be others
what do you mean by that
no I want to do over
too late a promise is a promise
Andy that's not fair
don't be like that I'll make you a priority
just not the only one
shut up I am the only priority
it's not enough why can't we just
kill our parents
hold on that's not what she said back then
do it for your cute little sister
kill them to solve all your problems
yes in a proper relationship only blood matters
kill them to feel something
kill them for food
that's actually so funny
kill them to avoid the things
kill them to avoid the things
I'll do to you if you don't
what is that supposed to mean
look who's awake
she's just whispering in his ear to kill his parents
or night it's still night time
what do you want you little creep
to offer mom and dad to the demon
right now
right now while they're asleep
we'll set the ritual up and do it
I've given you plenty
enough time to figure this out
yet you haven't
it's always hot when Amy
whispers things to me
so now we're doing it
kill your parents kill your parents kill your parents kill you
okay don't actually um okay
oh my my efforts were far more affected
than I thought welcome back Andy
that's not it but you have a point
that mom might cinch on us
I knew that even before we got out of our apartment
I don't know why I let myself
think anything else after talking to her
just because at your core
oh it's because at your core
you're just a soft gooey marshmallow
if it weren't for me
all kinds of vile women would have
gobbled you up already
chomp

yeah why are you still up
I thought you had work tomorrow
I wanted to talk to you
without Ashley
it's not really a good time right now
I know it's late but this is important
I've been thinking things over
and I believe I owe you an explanation
that's alright
I don't really need to know
I'm really tired
Andrew I understand if you're angry
but at least listen
the whole situation with Ashley was
oh
oh go on mom

like
the way he has a pillow on his crotch

and I think I'm gonna
trust Andrew at all costs
oh fuck

okay
I already figured out as much

there's blood right there
because you might have had a good reason
for not drawing them yet
fair whatever give me the card
I'll go pick up the rest of the money
I'll do the 2007
what's the 2007
why are you acting so gay
I'll stop taking my meds

just because I don't take my meds
doesn't mean you don't have to
or doesn't mean you shouldn't
are you gay
why are you acting so gay
kidney cleansing stream
so
once we reach low
I'll do the 200

of you wandering around all by yourself at this hour
it's already morning though
well yeah but I mean still
just hand me the card
actually can I really leave Andrew alone with mom and dad
who knows what they'll say to him
I just wish he was she enough as it is
Ashley
you wonder if you can trust Andrew enough to leave him alone with your parents
should I save
okay we're trusting Andrew
just give me the card
I'll go get the money
okay please be careful
aren't I always
when are you ever see you later
it'll be fine he won't turn on me as long as I have the trinket

Gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Pat Pat, you're doing so good.
Okay, this is going to be the last five, okay?
Ten more? Wait, when do you mean ten?
What do you mean ten?
Calories?
You're such a pushover.
I just want to...
I just...
I'm not a pushover.
Okay, fine. Last ten, no more.
I won't let you push me over anymore.
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Give me being the goodest of girls you deserve, all the head pads and cuddles.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
No, no more. I'm not letting you push me anymore.
I won't let you.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
It's okay if you don't want to do more.
You did great, good girl.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Big bro is impressed with your efforts.
I'm impressed with my efforts too.
I don't hate you. I love you.
That's why I'm doing this with you.
Why are you acting so gay?
I know you're tired, so don't choke on your water.
Make sure you swallow properly.
I'm swallowing, I'm swallowing.
I think it might be time to get the puppy pads.
But they're not comfortable to sit on.
I don't like sitting on them, they're not comfortable.
Okay.
Well, it is what it is. It doesn't have to be.
Oh, fuck.
Get a puppy pad?
Dude, this stream's gonna get fucking, this stream's gonna get me banned.
Have a mop?
Hahaha.
Okay, I'll get a puppy pad.
I mean what? No, I won't do anything. Hold on one second.
Okay, I got out the more comfortable ones.
I think we can still sort this out. Isn't that right?
Okay, I got out the more comfortable ones.
I think we can still sort this out. Isn't that right?
I think we can still sort this out, isn't that right?
If it's money you need, I can help you get a job. They're hiring at your company, aren't they love?
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
This is basically a ring for its dream, but for piss so you should be good.
Okay, if you say so.
That's right, if I put in a good word for you years, could as hired.
Before warned though, they get a lot of difficult customers there.
But I know you can handle it. It should be easy after handling Ashley all this time. What do you say?
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Well, I mean, since you went through the effort, might as well help you use it.
Oh, fuck you.
Decline.
Well, about Ashley, I wish you didn't talk about her that way.
Ah, he's defending her.
Did you seriously get a pat now? What?
What do you mean I wouldn't do that?
No.
Ahem.
Let's not fight. There's a solution somewhere, I'm sure.
What were those...
Oh, fuck.
What were those death certificates about anyways?
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Never beating the PLO relegations.
I am beating the PLO relegations. There's no piss happening here.
It's the opposite.
No, there's no aftermath pick happening either.
It's the life insurance game, nothing more. How's that work?
There's this doctor.
Well, a surgeon actually, after they told us you'll be stuck in that apartment.
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?
We can't go easy on you this time.
No, no, of course not. Of course you won't.
Don't worry, I know you won't.
Sure.
Cup pick? No!
No, absolutely not. You're begging so much though.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, absolutely not. You're begging so much though.
Maybe if you keep begging a little more, I might.
Okay, well, I got it for you two after you got quarantined.
It's kind of curious that they let you do that.
Please.
You're gonna need to do more than just please.
If he's legally dead, the offer to get him a job was a lie either.
Anyways, ooh, you're right.
So then when we died, were you in on it?
Of course not. I really thought you died.
Pretty please, you'll be the one begging soon.
Please, please, please, please.
Yeah, yeah, keep begging, keep begging.
I will totally do it if you beg.
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?
There is no piss yet, Timmy. That's what you meant to say at least.
There won't be any.
Gets on you is pretty please with sugar on top, you're the best girl ever.
I know I am.
Keep going, keep going. I might do it.
They said your bodies had to be burned because of the parasites,
so that's why I never got to confirm it myself.
She's so full of shit.
Where are you going?
I have to finish setting things up for her.
Oh, come on, forget about this nonsense, we can sort the documents out.
Hell, you can even live here if that doesn't work out.
You can leave this whole mess behind just like that, behind you, just like that.
Don't fall for your chat, fall for what?
Pretty please, you know we're worth it. Are you?
Please little sis, you love your big brother, don't you?
I do, I do, that's why I love to hear you beg.
She's trying to get you to abandon Ashley just like she did.
I won't do it though.
That's okay, I'm not really interested.
What? But that doesn't make any sense, why would you not?
I get it.
You fuck her.
What? Huh?
Oh, that is disgusting, Andrew, she's your sister for God's sake.
I haven't done anything with the hell mom.
Then what does she give you that makes it worth all this?
Well, that's none of your business is it?
I knew something was off.
How did I fuck up so bad? I'm the worst mother ever.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
She knows.
Chat, stop acting like little brothers.
Bulley our little sis more.
Stop begging.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Gaslighting the chimney.
I'm not gaslighting.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I said I'm gay.
Why are you acting so gay?
She's my sister. Kind of hot.
No, I mean, yes you are, but I have never...
I'm back.
Now of all times.
I got the money, did you miss me handsome?
Did you, did you?
Oh fuck.
We're not beating the incest allegations from mom.
I wanna die.
Whatever, some in the fucking demon already.
I was so eager. Let's see if it shows up though.
Since there's no music.
Wait, what are you talking about?
Quiet you, I'm still armed.
Aren't you like the candles?
Why are you acting so gay?
This bratty sis needs more hydration.
Mom really cannot imagine you just loving Ashley
and not wanting to have been her.
I know, what a bitch.
Right, light the candles.
Get to it.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Sip, sip, sip.
Fuck, coughing sucks.
Mom is just jealous.
Yeah, she wishes she had what we had.
Or what we have.
This upcoming scene is not gonna help the allegations.
I'm sorry I don't have the mood music,
but I have the other stuff you asked for.
Maybe if I sing something, please don't.
The demon shows up to spare everyone
from the second human embarrassment.
Ah, sorry soul.
What the fuck is that?
I offer those two.
They're screaming as short lived
as the demon steals their souls.
Oh, that was easy.
I wonder if I should feel something.
Well anyways, so the music wasn't needed
to summon you after all.
Why'd I have to play it last time?
The circle is hard to find.
Sound is easy to follow.
Sound is easy to follow.
Are you starting to feel the pressure?
A little bit, yeah.
It's not...
It's not very low yet, but...
I think it's getting there.
It's gonna take me a little longer
to get there because, you know...
I already went to the bathroom not too long ago.
However you may have my talisman now.
Oh, you have my talisman.
However you have my talisman now,
it makes you easy to find.
Speaking of which,
a deal's a deal, charge it up please.
Your trinket works again.
Thank you.
What, hello?
This is the brother.
That's right, my pride and joy.
Oh no, you can't have his soul, it's mine.
I will see you again, Tar Soul.
Sure, I'll make another offer once the trinket
needs to be charged again.
I will summon you.
Bring this one with you.
What, why me?
Okie dokie, bye bye.
Not gonna lie,
I kind of feel bad seeing my little sister
do all these exercises.
You should do them with me.
You should participate with me.
What's that?
The trinket is charged.
What did it mean?
What did it mean it'll summon you?
Who cares?
Who cares?
What do we do about the bodies?
Who cares, she says.
Are you kidding me?
The bodies, Andy Focus.
Right, the bodies.
What's in it for me if I participate?
My love and affection.
And pain.
And maybe a little bit of pleasure.
Well, on one hand,
we didn't kill them.
But on the other,
them having gone missing
would definitely be better for us.
Maybe they just fucked off somewhere.
Who knows?
We know how if there's a murder investigation.
Right, so let's make them disappear.
Right, we can start by chopping them up.
Can't we just dump them in the ocean or something?
No, Ashley, we're gonna make them vanish.
Not wash up a shore somewhere.
Cut them up!
How to go about this,
we can't leave a mess behind.
Well, there's a dream right there.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
We still doing jumping jacks with sips.
Need to keep Lil sis strong and agile to keep up.
I said no more.
I can't, I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if you're expecting more.
I can't.
Flat twist is coming up.
Not like it changes much, but flat twist.
Okay.
Sounds like a good deal.
Okay, then participate with me.
Here, I'll do a big sip instead, yeah.
There.
See, I'm not a dumb ass all the time.
No, just a dumb and an ass.
Wow, check this smart ass out right here.
Andrew's untying the parents with stops.
Wait, what?
What is it?
Is dad breathing?
Dad never had a soul to begin with.
Maybe some sit-ups?
I can't even do sit-ups.
No more jacks, we can push your limits,
but not too extreme for extra sense.
Why are you so gay?
We'll do damage.
Yeah, we don't want to damage me.
Remember before we get lower that safe word exists for a reason.
Begging and pleading is just a precursor to the real joys.
Filling her with kindness by not being soft this time.
Push-ups?
I can't even do one push-up, man.
Take a look, and sure enough, his chest is moving ever so slightly.
Mom, too.
Huh?
You try various things, but nothing gets a response from your parents.
See, their hearts still beat, their lungs draw in air.
What is this?
Maybe losing your soul just turns you into a vegetable.
That can't be.
The cultists died in the warden, too.
Did you actually check?
I sure didn't.
I just went to town and started chopping.
Was mom Purgante?
No, no, please tell me he wasn't still alive when we ate him.
What the fuck is so funny about this?
Come on now, I'm sure he died pretty quickly from blood loss.
If not, you ripping his head off must have done the trick.
It'll be the same with these two, get to cutting.
No, this changes everything, doesn't it?
You want to leave them like this? They're not getting their souls back.
But if you want to leave them to starve them, they'll for it.
Wouldn't it be a little poetic? I'm sure you'd like that.
Squats is the appropriate exercise?
I can't.
I don't want to.
I really don't.
You can't make me.
You won't make me.
Wouldn't it be a little poetic?
I'm sure you'd like that.
I don't know, I need to think.
Come on, where are you going?
No, Andrew, look here for a sec.
What?
Oh shit.
The plot twist is that people getting their souls taken doesn't kill them.
Awww.
The cultist was alive when you ate him.
Awww.
What are you doing?
Bear, all dead.
Now tell me again how I always make you do all the dirty work.
He'll bitch and moan.
Surely he'll bitch and moan as per usual.
But you did not miss that sigh of relief.
Anyway, you drag your parents' souls and lifeless bodies over to the shower.
Oh my god.
The UK special, she shanked them.
What do we do now? Do we cut them up?
I'll start cutting.
You guide the blood into the drain with the shower head.
Gotcha.
Whoa, whoa, wait, stop. Stop, it's flooding.
What the hell, gross.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Sip, sip, sip.
How much for squats?
If I say how much then a bunch of people will make me do squats.
Squats.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Keep hanging in there.
Kind of a point.
Why are you acting so gay?
No one said you could stop.
Oh my god.
100 bucks a squat.
Don't give a number, no more exercise.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Oh my god.
I don't know now.
Yes, that's the point of exercising because it lowers my energy.
Okay, I can't do 20 squats.
Don't put a number on it.
So just as many squats as I can, what do you mean don't put a number on it?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good girl.
Okay.
$20 for three squats there.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I'm cheering for you and also not at the same time.
Ocean wave, ocean wave.
$20 for three squats.
And I'm only doing a maximum of nine squats.
Okay?
Only doing a maximum of nine squats.
I'll get you something to unclog the drain with.
What?
Oh, the mop.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Okay.
Man, I haven't done squats in forever.
Shit.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Okay, six squats.
Okay.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Oh, shit.
Five.
Six.
Okay.
Six.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Ask to grass?
I...
I can't.
I can't.
I can't go ask to grass.
I can't.
I can't go ask to grass.
I can't.
I can't go ask to grass.
I can't.
That's too much.
Okay.
How do I clean up all this blood?
Toilet?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good job.
Oh, thank you.
Pour down some baking soda and vinegar.
Ah, screw.
Ah!
Okay.
Where do I...
Where do I find a screwdriver?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Where do I find a screwdriver?
Where can I find a screwdriver?
Oh, in the basement.
In the basement.
In the basement.
Toolbox. Toolbox.
Hi.
Um, baking soda.
Baking soda is in the, in the, in the kitchen?
In the kitchen.
Am I winning?
Aren't you gay?
Mm-hmm.
Why are you acting so gay?
Feeling a little swollen.
Lil sis.
Last satilda.
Okay, last sat.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Hey, you're starting to sound a little flustered there.
Because I am!
One.
Two.
Three.
Okay.
There, we got nine squats in total.
You got what you wanted.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Okay.
We're getting into very low tone.
Why are you acting so gay?
Gotta tone them cheeks.
My cheeks are already toned.
Why are you acting so gay?
How you holding up my lovely little sister?
You're acting so gay.
You're acting so gay.
You're acting so gay.
How you holding up my lovely little sister?
I'm holding up fine.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Cue timmy noise fund.
Punch them legs, I am!
I'm trying.
Kitchen, kitchen, we're going to the kitchen.
Fuck, that's not the kitchen.
Um.
Okay, baking soda, we got everything we need.
Ah.
Hey, are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
It's okay if you let out just a little.
No, no it's not.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
It would be so easy to just give up.
No, I can't, I literally can't, I literally can't.
You pour down a generous amount of baking soda
and then don't, don't sit with vinegar.
The soda starts bubbling up and the clog doesn't
lessen one bit.
Oh, I tried.
I'll give you some rubber gloves.
I'm the one who's gonna have to get in there.
Oh, of course, I am but a dainty little lady.
You can't expect me to do a man's job.
Fine, just give me the gloves.
Where do I find those?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
B.E.R.B., I have to house the bathroom sis.
I hope you fuckin'
trip and fall and land with your head in the toilet.
On the stairs.
Right, on the...
On the stairs.
I have fun.
God knows what out of the drain.
A seemingly never ending amount of God knows what.
It's disgusting, I'm gonna gag, you're not helping.
Fuck, that's gross, Andy.
Both of you took all of me about when I am armed.
Ew!
Come here, you.
No, no, no, don't you dare.
No, fuckin' kill you in your sleep in Minecraft.
Any last words?
Forgive me, Andrew, Andrew, I'm sorry, I apologize.
Find your spirit for now.
The drain works, let's get this over with.
And disembowel them and decapitate them.
And you also make mental note to yourself about Andrew.
Instead of oscillating between freaking out an apathy like you expected him to.
You're having a food fight, ew, it's not food.
Who is it?
What?
Nothing, Andrew.
If you're tired, I can take care of the rest.
No, no, it's really nothing.
I must be seeing things.
Huh? What?
To think...
To think I'd ever bear witness to you being distraught over our parents' crime.
Alright, and again, I bet you're just moping over finally getting your hands dirty.
She's still falling in love with him? Who? Me?
No?
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Sorry I was gone, Emmy. God held up cleaning up after an incident.
You're just too cute. So how is round two going so far?
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's, um, going well, I think.
She isn't predicting Andrew, she's predicting Andy, and Andy is gone now fully.
So now only Andrew's in it and she doesn't know how to predict Andrew.
Huh?
Hm? What? Are you doing alright?
As alright as I can be considering the circumstances?
That's good.
You're being weird.
Look.
Okay.
Look who's talking.
Alright, enough time wasted.
Andrew continues casually butchering your parents.
Incidentally, there's a knot in your stomach.
Why are you acting so gay?
I think it's going a little too well.
What do you mean?
There's no such thing as too well.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Don't try this at home.
And by this I mean dismembering your parents.
Right, yes, yes, exactly.
Oh fuck, I ran out of water.
I don't want to stand up and make some worse.
Okay.
I'll be right back anymore, water.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Hey, Emmy, you're being weird, yellow heart.
I'm not being weird, you're being weird.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll be right back.
Are you gay?
Stop chipping.
You're going to need more water.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
miserable
I'm sorry.
How much do I have to drink?
How much do I have to drink?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?

Are we leaving?
Huh?
Can we leave?
You can cook your parents if you interact with the pot in the kitchen.
Let's turn some of the meat into a soup, throw in some vegetables, maybe spices,
and then throw the rest away as scraps. What do you mean the rest?
What do you think? I'm eating some. Do what you want. What was the soup you made earlier?
What are the ingredients again?
The recipe is right there, read it. Shame on me for...
Shame on me for thinking you'd be helpful.
It was me, Anya's Potatoes and Carrots, shop everything up and throw them into a pot.
There we go, thank you.
I know you memorized it, you fucking nerd.
I'm not letting go of anything.
You're welcome.
Do I have to...
How's the game so far?
That size is how it is.
How many water bottles?
I don't...
Fuck!
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Drip, drip, drip.
Nothing is dripping.
Nothing, there's no drip.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Cheers.
Cheers.
For some reason my monitor keeps flickering.
What am I here for?
All I want is to cook my parents, right?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Gotta go to the bathroom real quick.
Be a good girl and hold it while I'm gone.
It's not fair!
It's not fair.
Why are you acting so gay?
You should get real close to the mic and let us hear you drink.
I am, but I don't think you can hear it.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Soup is mostly water.
I know it is.
This is kind of medically unadvisable, I know it is.
It's so gay.
What would happen if I poked your belly right now?
I don't want to think about that.
And you can't make me poke it myself, I won't do it.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
An old army tip to help make drinking lots of water more tolerable.
Add some salt.
The body needs minerals along with the water.
You're already torturing me.
You want me to drink disgusting salt water too?
No.
Let me fix my monitor real quick.
It keeps flickering.
Okay.
You can just eat some street-up salt.
I don't think I'll do that.
But I did bring a sausage earlier from the kitchen.
Does that work?
I'm going to eat this sausage.
There.
Girl breakfast!
Okay.
You don't have all the ingredients prepared.
Where the fuck do I get the meat from?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Where the fuck do I get the meat from?
It is very salty.
I don't know what kind of sausage it is.
But it's my favorite.
It's really spicy.
And my mom gets it from the farmers market for me.
But their...
Their remains are in the fire cooking.
How do I get their remains?
I'm not gay.
Why are you acting so gay?
Evening, Jinji.
How you been, baby girl?
Jinji.
I can't say I'm not ginger.
I am ginger.
Did that scene happen yet?
What scene?
I don't know. Throw them in the fireplace?
What about the skulls?
The skulls we can deal with later along with the other skulls.
Look at that. Much better than your soup.
Now, was there anything else we still need to deal with?
I don't know.
She's my little ginger ale.
Aw, it's cute.
Throw your faces into the fire.
Wow, we had their faces.
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,
but unfortunately the concept artist
and Strani have both informed me
that I am supposed to be ginger.
Don't worry.
I'll make myself more obviously ginger.
When I draw my model.
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,
but unfortunately the concept artist

I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,

I know it's so over. I have no soul.
Several servings of crimson smoothie emerge.
Several servings of crimson smoothie emerge.
All of which you fork down the fish and sink.
All of which you fork down the fish and sink.
How's that? Good as gone?
How's that? Good as gone?
I'm genuinely surprised you didn't offer me any.
I'm genuinely surprised you didn't offer me any.
Well, did you want a disease or something?
Of course.
Of course I wouldn't offer you raw meat.
You really take me for an idiot, don't you?
Is the sausage good?
Yes.
I take you for what you are, idiot.
Watch your mouth.
This idiot just poured your parents down the train.
Huh. Alright.
That was pretty smart, I guess, for an idiot.
What do I do?
What do I do?
Is it a big sausage?
Sorry, I choked on it a little.
It is a big sausage and it's really spicy too.
So it hurts to eat.
The bones, the bones, the bones.
The bones.
The bones, what do I do with the bones?
Do you think the soup is ready?
What do I do with the bones?
What do I do with the bones?
How many inches?
It's like three inches.
Why are you acting so gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Can't have you choking.
Better wash it down.
Dinner's ready.
I'm eating too.
Of course, this is the last hearty home cooked meal for a while after all.
I suppose that's right now.
Why are you acting so gay?
I don't know.
Can you eat closer to the mic?
The mic is right in front of my mouth.
It's always in front of my mouth.
It's probably just not sensitive enough to hear.
Yeah.
Maybe if I turned off the mic settings.
There.
Is that what you wanted?
Okay, I turned the mic settings back on.
How is it?
It's okay.
Just okay?
I mean, it's better than last night, but...
Why are you so picky?
It's really dry. You overcooked it or something.
Mom's just a dry person, alright?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Do you miss being able to look at our Twitter likes?
I do.
I do.
It kind of, you know, told me what kind of person you are.
And the stuff you like.
I don't chew with my mouth open.
It's just the model tracking thinks my mouth is open.
How the hell is it dry?
This is soup.
No, mom should be more salty.
This is just plain and dry.
I rate this a waste of ingredients out of 10.
We're not eating again.
If the water continues,
don't neglect sodium salty food will do.
Yeah, that's why I'm eating a sausage.
I will slay away in the kitchen for you.
This is the things I get.
I'm sorry you can't cook.
You're not forgiven.
Jackass!
Eat shit and die.
Come on, I'm joking. It's not that bad. It's fine.
More than fine.
Okay, I'm going to stop eating the sausage for a bit.
I'm trying to like...
I shouldn't describe anything I'm doing.
No, I'm not going to describe anything I'm doing.
I can't.
I just...
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Yes, yes, it's fantastic.
In a way, my dumb ass can appreciate.
How about that?
Yes, indeed, this cooking is beyond
my mortal comprehension.
Correct?
Out of this world culinary experience,
which the likes of me cannot even taste properly.
Because my taste buds simply aren't evolved enough
to sense all the subtleties.
I'm not explaining anything to the class.
In a roundabout way.
I'm eating a sausage, that's what I'm doing.
I'm chewing on the sausage, that's what I'm up to.
So this calorie should only reflect the kings.
No, gods!
That's more like it.
So exquisite is your cooking.
But I'll write a shitty poem about it.
Oh god.
Lo and behold I implore you
Come feast your eyes on her.
And oh, and there is food, too.

Why are you acting so gay?
No, I think you need more water.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, yes, yes, more water.
This way to God is...
The steer is not staying up.
Okay, as long as you don't get it.
Why are you acting so gay?
It's spicy, you better drink some water then.
Oh my God.
How much of the bottle is left?
Like, more than half?
I don't want to end.
I mean, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go. I want to keep going.
Are you talking to yourself right now?
You're right.
What was I thinking?
You wouldn't even worry if I told you to.
What?
Your inability to...
Was that hot?
Oh God.
Are you gay?
Oh, please.
Why are you acting so gay?
More than half?
We need to fix that.
Your inability to grasp the weight of the situation is simultaneous.
Your best and worst quality.
I've really come to appreciate it.
Though it pisses me off all the same.
Thank you.
You're gay?
Oh my God.
Why are you acting so gay?
Try tapping a few inches below your belly button should holding it in.
Okay.
Why are you acting so gay?
Try tapping a few inches below your belly button should holding it in.
No.
No.
I'm not doing that.
I'm not stupid.
I'm not stupid.
I just chose to ignore your knots.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Give it a little press.
I don't want to.
You can't make me.
I'm not doing that.
No.
It should be fine just to chuck.
Press for 30?
Okay press for 30.
Just one!
It should be fine to just...
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Don't be a bad girl.
Ah!
I don't care.
If it makes me...
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Don't be a bad girl.
Ah!
I don't care.
Why are you acting so gay?
Just push a bit see what happens.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
It should be fine to just chuck this into the trash bin outside, right?
Okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Press.
Okay.
Oh my god.
Okay okay okay I did it.
I did it.
I did it.
I hate you.
I hate you.
Okay.
Okay.
I wanna do a pose.
How do I do it?
Ow!
Fuck, that was a...
That was a rough cough.
Why does nothing...
Why is 80% saying no?
It wasn't this bad last time.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Don't give an early this time chat.
Ow!
Oh my god.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Too bad.
Not so soon.
Fuck.
Fuck you.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You don't seem like you really want to go.
But I do.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Sounds like you need some more sips.
Hope you don't leak.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You're a big girl.
You can take it.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Drink up, cutie.
Orange heart.
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Drink up, cutie.
Orange heart.
Okay.
Okay.
Can we go now?
Should we go?
Can we?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Almost seems like you shouldn't have talked all that shit earlier.
I stand by what I said.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I don't know it looks like you could hold out a lot longer and plus you have your puppy pad there with you love you and me.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Remember chat, there is still another energy level and a safe word we can reach.
Hold the line.
You won't.
We're not getting there.
We're not getting to the next level.
Can you help me in the game?
I don't know what else.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Remember chat, we have safe words and she mocked us for giving in.
I want to push her to her limits.
Hearing her cutely beg and complain makes my day.
Oh my god.
I need to figure out what to do with the bones.
For now, I'll just collect them all before Ashley distract.
Okay.
What do I do with them?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Don't worry, we'll let you go when the game is over shouldn't be more than 30 minutes.
The game isn't finished in 30 minutes, is it?
Ow!
Is it?
The game is done in 30 minutes?
Really?
Wait, so what do I do now?
Wait, there's only two chapters right now?
Wait, is the game not done?
Is the game not done?
I do lack critical information.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Sounds like we need to hurry this up.
It's still being...
Okay, are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Get those drinks in before the game is over.
I'm trying!
Can you tell me what to do next?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You can do it.
Even though it probably seems like it would feel really good to let go.
So what about these skulls?
I'm thinking of throwing those into the...
Into the...
Into the ocean along with the rest of the bones.
So much for making them a bit...
Oh my god, I can't!
Oh fuck!
So much for making them disappear, huh?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Think about how good you would feel to leak out just a tiny bit.
I can't!
Even if I want to...
Well, maybe I can try, hold on.
No, I can't.
Even if I want to, I can't.
I literally...
I literally can't.
You're not allowed to, it doesn't matter.
I can't.
So much for...
Are you gay?
Oh my god.
Why are you acting so gay?
Try again.
No.
No, I can't.
No, I can't.
So much for making them disappear, huh?
What did we do all this other crap for?
I should...
Hold on.
I just want to check something real quick.
Hold on.
Oh shit, I have the wrong...
Dammit!
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
That's it, open your mouth and drink.
Don't say that!
Don't say that here!
Okay, okay, okay.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Make sure you breathe.
Think of a happy place.
Like a waterfall, gushing water everywhere.
Stop!
Please, please, are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I know you can do it, Amy.
You're a good girl.
I'm hoping one can't identify someone based on their bones alone.
The bones float?
Aren't they kinda like sticks?
I'll find someone to weigh them...
Fuck.
Gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Please.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Just close your eyes and lean back.
Relax, baby.
No!
No!
No!
I'm doing another...
Please.
Please!
Please, please, can I go please?
Why are you saying no?
Please.
Please.
Please.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Huh?
Drink, drink, drink, drink.
Get hydrated, get hydrated, get hydrated.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Bag harder.
You're making me angry, I don't want to!
Are you gay?
Oh my God.
Why are you acting so gay?
Just hold on a little longer.
Okay?
Okay.

I still see an energy bar down there.
It can't be that bad.
You're uncomfortable.
Imagine how I feel.
Why are you acting so gay?
If you need to go that badly,
you can go right here.
Stop being creepy and weird.

Didn't give in.

There's another level after very low.
We can push more chat.
Our little sister needs more correction
and them all for it.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You're right.
It will be just an accident.
Okay.
I go down.
I go down a level.
I go down a level.
There, there, there, there, there, there.
There.
Okay.
I'm at the last level.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I haven't heard you drinking, Emmy.
Bad girl.
Okay, I'll drink more.
Why are you acting so gay?
The only thing uncomfortable is how hard I am.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Normies and children out.
Stop complaining and saying it's weird.
Dude, I don't even know where my phone is.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Now, beg for it.
Oh, fuck you.
I'm trying to turn on my phone
so I can literally record what you want.
Come on.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
My phone is ready.
Please.
Why are you acting so gay?
I want you to have an accident.
No!
Please.
I'm giving you what you want.
Please, please.
Please.
I can't even drink anymore.
Where I can't.
Oh my god.
Why is the pulse so...
Why is the pulse so...
Please.
Chat.
Chat, please.
Big brother.
Only chat.
Whatever you want me to call you.
I don't care.
Please.
I'll fucking call you OG-san if you want.
I'll do anything, please.
I'll do anything, please, please, please.
Please.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Do.
Not.
Give.
In.
Well, it's not 51%.
That's basically it.
Come on, it's not 51.
That's 150.
Please, that's literally more than 50.
It's not 52 now.
It's the only way to end.
Huh?
No.
Are you gay?
It's not 52.
I can go, I can go, I can go, I can go.
Sweetie, be a good girl and do it.
You know we both want it.
Fuck.
Okay.
I'm taking the iPhone because...
Wait.
Maybe I can get another phone.
Hold on.
I have an old phone somewhere.
My phone died.
What do I do?
What do I do?
Don't be a bad girl.
Oh my god.
What do I do?
Should I just take the iPhone?
Why are you acting so gay?
Try pressing on your stomach a little.
Shut up.
Okay, I'm taking the iPhone.
You're going to lose tracking.
My other phone died.
Are you gay?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Bye, bye, bye.
It's 52 now.
Wait, why does it say no?
Are you gay?
Wait, why does it say that no one?
Wait, I was literally about to go.
It's at 52 for no breath.
Wait, I was literally about to go.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do I do?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I was literally just about to go.
Here.
Right.
Now.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Please.
Please.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I don't even...
What do I do?
What do you want me to do?
Gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Looks like someone can't see straight.
What?
I can't.
I can't.
I can't go.
I'm not going here.
Please ask nicely again.
I literally got my phone ready for it and everything.
Shit.
Fuck a prison lock button.
Why are you acting so gay?
You know what it is, Emmy.
IDD feels so good.
No.
Please.
I'm asking nicely.
I'm sorry.
The tracking is gone.
I'm ready.
I'm ready to do what you want.
Please.
Just let me call.
Please let me call.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I still feel like you can hurt a bit longer.
No, I can't.
I can't.
I seriously can't.
Gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I'm literally done.
Remind me what the safe word was again.
I don't want to say it.
The safe word was rats.
Rats.
There.
Are you gay?
You said it.
Why are you acting so gay?
Can I please call now?
Remember when she talked smack chat?
No.
I promise.
That's not the case anymore.
That's not the case anymore.
That's not the case anymore.
Go.
Okay.
Okay, I'm going.
I'm going.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good girl.
You can go.

What do I do?
Can I save it as a draft?
Oh my god, what do I do?
But it's not on- I can't post this on main.
I can't post this on main.
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Sorry for torturing you but you say please in such a cute way.
How do you believe it is fried chicken?
Post it, download it, then delete it?
Can I trust you to download this as soon as possible?
So I can delete it?
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?
Because I posted this on main.
I'm so proud of you. I love you so much. You're my good girl.
You held out for so long.
I love you too.
Damn it to the sky?
I don't know what that means.
Private main for 5 minutes then download it first.
We will have in like 10 seconds.
Are you ready to download it?
Don't post it, re-upload it to alt.
Like I can't re-upload it because it's in-
I recorded it with the in-app twitter thing.
Here, let me listen to it actually.
Hold on, I'm muting it so you can't hear it.
You can't DM it to yourself? No.
It's like ready to post but it's on my main account.
Okay, let me listen to it.
Oh my god, it was all for nothing.
The audio got fried.
I don't know what happened.
It's so fried.
I promise I'm not joking too.
It's so...
Like it sounds deep fried.
Oh, it's over.
I promise you I'm not joking.
I'm sorry.
I will literally let you listen to it.
That's how fried it is.
Like it's so...
Post it for proof.
It's deep fried.
I think it's really really badly.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh...
Let us listen.
Okay, hold on, let me continue listening.
Like it literally sounds like...
Okay, can we hear it?
No, it's like really...
I'll post it for like 5 seconds.
And then let you download it.
But it's do another recording later.
The universe didn't want me to do this.
Okay, let me listen to the full thing.
It's like about a minute long.
It sounds like a robot pissing.
Oh, it sounds like a robot.
Oh man, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.
I am using a refurbished iPhone.
So it's possible it's kind of broken still.
I'm in debt to you.
Are you acting so gay?
iPhone mic claims another victim.
It's the thought that counts at least.
Okay, I'm gonna post it for like...
Not even 5 minutes.
Here's your robot pissing.
There.
I'm so sorry.
The first audio recording I did on this phone was fine too.
Okay, well...
Please get ready to download it, okay?
Post.
I truly don't know what happened.
Maybe it won't be deep fried once I post it.
I'm nookin' this vlog.
Absolutely not.
I guess it was just my phone that deep fried it.
No, that was an accident.
That was an accident.
I didn't know who would play.
I didn't know who would play in the desktop audio.
Okay.
I can't believe I uploaded that on main.
Okay, it's gone now though, right?
Oh my god, okay.
I'm trying to find vtube studio. Hold on.
I hate myself. I'm so fucking stupid.
I can't believe I fucking did that. What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Okay, there's your tracking.
I fucking play that on stream like a dumb bitch.
Good job, big bro is proud of you.
You can give yourself a pat on the back for doing so well.
Good girl, I'm proud of you.
Pampering isn't bound.
Thank you.
I was so scared that it got deep fried because it was deep fried on my phone.
Alright, good thing it's not.
Feel free to save that.
I'm not reposting it to my NSFW today.
If you saved it, you saved it.
It's tough luck.
Right.
What do I do now?
I don't think I'll make it to another P.
I would like to finish the game.
Yes, please help me finish the game.
Let me know when you've gotten the teeth and bones and rocks sorted out.
It's already posted like seven times.
Okay.
Pam.
What do I do?
I don't have to hold it anymore.
Should we just finish the stream normally?
Rocks in the garden.
Okay.
Right here.
And then what?
Yeah, we might as well finish.
I want to finish it.
What do I do with rocks?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You did great, Emmy.
I look forward to next time we can bully and spoil you.
Love you so much.
My cutest little sister.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Thanks for being the best sister ever.
Thank you.
Sorry, I should probably mute the alert sound.
It's probably annoying.
Do we have enough time to get another low energy?
No, we don't.
No, we don't.
I'm literally so...
All that remains now is cleaning up the basement.
Do we have to?
Obviously.
Why?
Oh, I can finish my sausage now.
Okay.
We're going to live here, right?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Such a good girl, Emmy.
So is there a round 3?
No.
Thank you for calling me a good girl, though.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Are you good?
Did we go too hard on you?
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Okay, I finished my sausage.
Thank you for all the praises.
They have coworkers, friends, other family beside us.
What a bunch of whores.
Why weren't they happy with just each other?
I didn't imply they fucked any of them.
Irrelevant.
It's all the same.
Anyway, they can't go all up.
They can't all go haven't heard from those two in a while.
Oh well.
Someone's going to come looking with the authorities.
And who will they find here?
Their children who didn't report their parents missing?
One whole minute.
One whole minute.
One whole minute.
One whole minute.
One whole minute.
One whole minute.
I am such a good girl.
And who will they find here?
Their children who didn't report their parents missing?
Officer gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Good job, Amy.
You're the best little sister a brother could have.
Thank you.
You're the best brother a sister could have.
How the fuck aren't you dead anyways?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You did so well.
Our beloved little sister.
Good girl, Amy.
Aww, thank you.
I didn't expect so much praise after that.
Aww, thank you.
I didn't expect so much praise after that.
I didn't expect so much praise after that.
I didn't expect so much praise after that.
If you don't want to stay here, just say so.
If you don't want to stay here, just say so.
It's not that I don't want to.
Why are you acting so gay?
A very good girl and so well trained.
I love you.
Well trained?
I was the one that's supposed to train you.
I love you too though.
Okay.
It's not that I don't want to.
It's just that I don't think we can.
It's just that I don't think we can.
Well, can we at least use their IDs?
We can be the new Mr.
We can be the new and improved Mr. and Mrs. Graves.
Proud of you.
You did such a good job.
Thank you.
It's so nice to get praise like this.
Oh my god.
I love aftercare.
What the fuck?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You deserve the praise.
You are the best.
Love you and me.
I love you too.
Thank you.
All right.
Once the authorities start looking for them,
I'll see what we've been up to with theirs.
Sorry, Ashley.
I wish it was that easy.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
You deserve the praise.
You are the best.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I can't believe Maye Moto
is so good at grooming her own e-i-chan.
Own e-i-chan?
Did she say she'll clean the basement?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
This dream was amazing.
You're the best of me.
I'm glad you liked it.
I need a mop.
I'll finally this fucking mop.
After staring at the mop this whole game.
I'm kind of disappointed that there's not more to the game.
Am I done?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Pat pat pat pat.
Get praise.
Get praise.
Get praise.
Get praise.
Get praise.
Get praise.
Get praise.
This one?
No blind.
Okay.
Take it.
So gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
After the stream is done.
I'm going to have my own accident.
Have you been holding it in too or something?
More content is a bit delayed to her estimate from what I've heard.
Really? That's a shame.
It's a good game.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
After all that torturing you deserve all the praising and love of me.
I do.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Give me your shrimp play the best ever.
Can't help but love of me.
I am the best.
The creator got doxed.
The creator got doxed.
That sucks.
Oh man.
Bruh.
That sucks so much.
I hope that they can make more.
I will personally pay for more of the game.
I will fund it myself if I have to.
Though there's no way to tell if we missed something still.
Other than maybe see if you have a dream.
Why are you acting so gay?
You made so much lemonade today.
Party face.
Birthday cake.
I did.
I offer two souls so it stands to reason I have at least two visions to come.
How about I take a nap and see if a disaster awaits?
Please do.
Are we sleeping on the couch together?
The game is still getting developed. The creator is just hiding offline now.
Okay.
Just get the creator to do a stream like this.
Clearly it works for funding.
I was surprised.
Now that your mother said there's no need to sleep down here.
Oh we're sleeping in parents' room.
So if the game's not done, why are there endings?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I know I'm going to have an accident to that audio.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The guest of the game is in production.
They're basically doing it offline.
I just want to make sure that I didn't get banked for posting that on main.
Fuck.
Hold on.
I mean it's okay. I'm not logged into Discord so I can't see if that was a bad idea.
It's okay I deleted it.
Yeah I didn't post anything.
I didn't post anything.
You don't uh could you possibly give any less of a fuck that'd be great?
Oh do forgive me your highness it's been a week or two.
Yeah it was an accident sorry.
And and run out of yours you didn't even remember our parents address.
Which is of course just as important as this.
Look it just said that I need to do the...
I need to hold on to it to have a clear point dream that's it.
It was in my pockets last time when it happened.
Then I could hold it this time.
It gave it to me so maybe it wouldn't work with you.
What's it hurt to try?
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Gimme I am proud of you more so than I've ever been proud of anyone or anything before.
And that pride is constant.
Keep up all the good work and know that we all love you.
Aww I love you too.
Thank you.
Okay.
I did get it I just don't care.
Stop being so selfish all the time let me try.
It's my trinket.
Ever heard of sharing?
How am I supposed to share this?
Do you want to cut the trinket in half?
I'm sure that's a great idea.
No just we're not cutting it.
That's not it but I'm sure we can both hold it at the same time.
Let me hold it.
How are you feeling?
Relieved.
See if either of us gets a vision.
How it's a bit small.
Between our hands right?
Oh my how romantic.
Come again.
Holding hands when we sleep together.
Man fuck off.
Alright forget this goodnight.
I'm kidding I'm kidding it's fine.
Though I still think I'm gonna be the only one who has a vision.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night.
Fuck this.
How am I supposed to sleep after you went and said something so off color?
To us.
I'll take it.
If for once she regretted the both of us then I'm happy.
What?
Aw nothing goodnight.
It isn't long until sleep takes you over.
Get ready get down bad.
What's about to happen?
Sucky drawing.
Oh that's how we get to the place.
Over here.
Up here right?
Over here.
Huh?
Down here?
Wait where do I go?
Where do I go?
I won't let me go anywhere.
Between the drawings and the tv.
What?
Thought I'm right?
Oh.
No.
It's not letting me.
Follow the red path in the drawing.
But both are not letting me.
Both are not letting me.
But I can't go anywhere.
I can't.
There's a third pile?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh okay.
And then
green.
We use the green one to draw.
Yeah yeah yeah I'm so smart.
Yeah.
Oh come on.
I have to go all the way back around.
Choose the best option for you and Andy to be together.
I will.
Of course I will.
I need a sneeze.
That was not a cute sneeze.
What am I supposed to do here?
Could you draw this garbage?
Bless you thank you.
No?
The tv and you watch each other.
More importantly this episode is titled Lay Lay and Lay Lay Alone.
Pink plush.
Do I take it?
Doesn't tight.
I'll take it.
Here you guys can have a little plushy party.
Wait what?
Father plush won't budge.
Mother plush won't budge.
Huh.
Huh.
What?
A stool.
Pink and green sleep together.
Oh that's so cute.
Yellow plush won't budge.
Who are these colors?
Supposed to be.
Why is this locked?
Hmm.
Still is red herring?
What does that mean?
Huh?
Can I grab plushies?
Oh there we go now they budge.
Put them in the soup like we cooked them.
Yeah.
Now what?
Green is julia and purple is nina.
Oh.
An empty spot.
Green between the purple and yellow.
Wait I'm supposed to put green between the two girls?
But isn't green andy?
Green andy?
Yeah?
And I'm supposed to put him between the two girls?
You need to get the Andrew plush
but read its description of the green plush.
That's the point.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
So I'm supposed to place the green plush?
Really?
I don't want to.
Okay.
Can it really?
Yes it can.
What do I do?
Oh purple hussy.
Yellow flusy.
Do I put them in the trash?
Oh! One goes in the trash.
Hold on.
Which one do I put in the...
Does it matter?
Does it matter which one goes in the trash?
Yellow?
Yellow in the trash?
It matters. Yellow is trash.
Okay.
It matters but I'll let you do it again
if you get it wrong.
Oh it'll let you do it again.
Put Andrew in the cage.
Put him in the cage.
Got the best thing in the world.
In the cage you go.
Are we free?
Huh?
Do I put the knife here?
Oh which one do I put?
Read the plaque?
Oh shit!
Flowers.
Oh your choice.
Oh shit.
It doesn't say anything.
Oh the plaque over there.
An emerald evening.
Okay I put the flowers.
Huh?
A broken heart.
A broken heart.
Once upon a lousy life.
The end.
The order matters.
Heart, sunshine, broken heart.
Heart.
Right?
Heart.
Sunshine.
Broken heart.
Somehow it seems a highly question
what I do to take this route.
I know what I'm about.
There's nothing on any of these.
Classmates.
Parents.
Dotkey.
Siblings.
Friends.
I don't want to unlock him.
Am I supposed to do something with him and put him on a plaque?
Some of them change.
Siblings.
Eat it.
Read it again.
Friends.
Parents.
I'm reading it.
They're all the same.
Classmates.
They're all the same. All the plaques are the same.
Do I put Andy somewhere?
You put him on the pedestals. Which one?
Which one though? All of them?
Oh. Oh, okay.
Soulmates.
I get it now.
Family.
This is kind of cute.
Friends.
Oh, it's a demon.
The lemon cupcake memory is back.
Oh, what are you doing here?
Penny for your thoughts?
No deal. Come on, give me one word.
Mordifying.
Is this supposed to be the fucking sex ending? Where's the sex?
Look very closely at me.
Mordifying.
Oh, she's got a bite mark on her.
Big words don't fit in your mouth.
Yeah?
Something else.
Are you gay?
Why are you acting so gay?
Emmy, do you think we can have the same relationship as Ashley and Andrew have?
Because in desperate need, won't you help your brother out?
I've been giving you tips so far,
but do you take all kinds of tips?
Even mine?
Sorry.
Yes.
Yeah, I'll take all kinds of tips from you.
Oh, yeah.
So mortified, are you?
You know I'm easy to distract.
So guilty conscious you got.
Guilty conscious you got.
KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS!
Come here, you.
Oh my god!
The vision ends without you dying.
So at least there's that, I suppose.
Choker tug there? Oh fuck, I didn't see it.
Oh fuck, damn it, okay.
Well...
Do you wonder if Andrew saw it too?
Wait!
Wait!
They didn't actually just do it?
That was all a dream.
Mayhaps...
Oh shit, you're awake.
Well hello to you too.
Yeah, good morning or evening, I guess.
Whatever.
Right, so you're awake.
Whatever.
Right, so hey, did you get a vision?
Probably not.
Really? Do you see dreams like that a lot then?
I don't.
So you did see it?
Quite the vision, huh big brother?
That was not a vision.
The demon is messing with us.
Yeah, that's it, that's just it.
It's because we tried to be cheap
and get two visions for the price of one.
So it gave us a fake vision instead.
That's the only explanation that makes sense.
Oh please.
I mean, it is your...
It is your trinket, clearly you were right
and I wasn't supposed to use it.
Sure, sure, keep selling it, I'm totally buying it.
He's on Coville.
Yeah, you just might!
Fuck off, do you honestly think that?
Yes, yes.
I don't know, you tell me.
Listen here, you.
Fucking spare me, I don't want to hear it.
You just helped me...
You just helped me desecrate our parents' corpses.
Yet getting laid is what you're freaking out about?
No one got laid.
And you keep telling me I messed up.
What a joke.
It's okay, cope.
We're not like that, are we?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I don't know.
You just come off that way sometimes.
How so?
Attach jealous? Oh dear.
What's that, wishful thinking?
Tell it to my ex.
Let's not pretend you don't have a bit of jealous...
jealous streak yourself.
Now that's wishful thinking.
That chance to get over yourself.
Sigh.
Yeah, he's so in denial.
I don't think I need to ask you this,
but let me anyways.
It's never gonna come to that, right?
You and me?
Never say never.
Never.
Never say never, Andrew, my dear.
Oh my fucking god.
It's not funny, don't joke about this.
Why am I getting your hopes up?
Or maybe something else?
Every time I laugh, I have to cough.
Say, did that vision get you?
I'm out of here.
Why is this such a massive issue to you?
We've done worse things together.
We have?
I honestly figured it would happen eventually.
Why, why, why, why are you like this?
Why would you say this?
Why would you think this?
Wow, what a landmine, huh?
Well, yeah.
Forget this, forget this whole thing.
Fine, that was clearly a vision,
so it'll probably come up sooner or later.
Well, in your last vision,
a guy slid her throat to it. Here we are.
So, let's leave it at that.
No, stop being in denial.
Alright, then if you say so.
Anyway, let's go through Mom and Dad
into the ocean, yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah, we need to corrupt him more.
Do we go back to the car now?
Do we break in someone else's car?
This way is nothing more than parking spots.
Oh.
Ah!
Oh.
I hate you.
I don't care, hurry up and pick them up.
Ah!
Sorry.
Is that it?
Thank God no one is here at this hour.
Am I almost done or is there like a lot more?
Can you tell me?
Well, let me...
I need to get this.
Okay.
Almost done.
Okay, so don't stray too far into the light.
Just in case someone does pass by.
How do I do that?
Where am I supposed to...
Huh?
Oh wait, I'm supposed to...
Oh, right, right, right.
Throw them into the ocean.
Since my bag broke, how do we make sure the skulls sink?
They'll probably be fine.
Well, in that case.
But I can throw further than you.
Bet you can't.
Oh yeah, definitely.
On the count of three.
One, two...
Ah!
Ooh, what's that? Looks like I won!
Filthy cheat!
Nope, you never said pushing wasn't allowed.
Oh yeah?
Well, here's your fucking prize Jackass.
It's a fist to the face.
Aww.
A hug. Why thank you, thank you.
I love her screech.
Fuck, I hate seeing couples happy.
Goddamn fuck you.
You're a little different lately.
Am I no fun anymore?
Let me think.
Have you been sleeping lately?
Are you actually looking for a fight?
I'm not talking about that, I just mean in general.
You're an insomnia and nightmares.
How are those?
It's been decent all things considered.
Yeah.
Unexpectedly, you seem to be doing just fine.
We're a happy couple.
We are.
I'm trying to self-insert, I'm trying!
Well, don't be happy for me or anything.
Andy is all grown up and he doesn't need me anymore.
Andy is dead, I don't think he needs anything.
Even so, there's the trinket too.
You're apparently the one, the only one allowed to use it, so there's that.
I don't know about that, but it certainly showed me one way to keep him around.
I suppose.
Right, I'm honestly pissed.
We don't know what's coming next.
It's really hard to plan what to do now.
Ah, right, so what do we do?
The money has brought us, has brought us some time,
but we still need to find ourselves newer again.
Are you okay?
Why are you acting like that?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Why are you acting so gay?
I hate hearing couples happy,
but I thought we were one.
What happened to our promise?
I'm sorry, you're right.
We are a happy couple.
No, I wouldn't hate us as a happy couple.
Can't we just live in the car
and mug random people for a living?
That's just not going to work
for very long.
Every time we try our luck,
we're more likely to get caught.
Then we can't buy fake identities.
I know, people do that sometimes.
I know people do that sometimes.
Point me to the guy who sells them,
and I'll get right on that.
The cultist club seems like a really sketchy spot.
We do have something special.
Maybe someone there knows who sells them.
Probably not, though.
Stop being such a defeatist.
Let's go and take a look-see.
It's a crap idea.
It's a crap idea to go anywhere near where the guy...
It's a crap idea to go anywhere near
where we killed that guy.
Also, that motel was the only one
letting us stay with cash only.
Fine, but we're leaving the car
in the random parking lot
since there's definitely an ongoing
investigation for that hitman's death.
I have to cease again.
Never mind, it was Leon.
Alright, cool, whatever, let's get going.
I had a mold here?
Are you coming or what?
In a minute, let me finish this.
Waste of time and money, I love it.
Waste of time and money, I love it.
Glad to hear it.
Episode 3 Burial has been updated.
I'm literally looking up
