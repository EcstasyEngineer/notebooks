98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
As long as you're on stream, you can change it after stream

99
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
No one gives a shit when the stream is called

100
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
As long as we're online right now

101
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Okay, okay

102
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Yeah, we're here

132
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
She's talking to her chat

133
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Blah blah blah

134
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
We, a viewer, have done the holistic approach

135
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Where none of us will mute

136
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
You're just gonna hear everything

137
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
All at once

138
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Yeah, that's how we're all

139
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040

At the end of the stream

143
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
There's an absolute cluster

144
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Buck of all six of us together

145
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
But yes

146
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
The whole premise of the power washer

147
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Was I was gonna do a gag and be like

148
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Oh, Viola isn't doing so well

149
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
We might go bust

150
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
So everyone put a bikini on and get clean in

151
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Well, that idea is out the window now

152
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
So instead we're playing Gartik Phone

153
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I've never played it personally

154
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
She'd be

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Suggesting it and her word is

156
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Law, so let's just

157
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Ah, yes

158
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm taking over the company

159
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
I am the shadow CEO

160
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Okay, do you guys want to start?

161
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
You ready?

162
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Let's do it

163
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Three, two, one

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Let's go

165
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
I know cheating

166
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
So chat, don't fucking cheat

167
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Don't fucking do it, I swear to God

168
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
I'll beat your ass

169
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
How long do I have to do the sentence?

170
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
I don't know

171
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Help me out

172
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Help me out

173
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
These lines don't give out

174
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Wait until it's over

175
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
This is our secret

176
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Oh wait

177
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
I don't think they'll actually know what that is

178
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
So let me change it

179
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
What's wrong?

180
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
We don't have any time

181
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
I see

182
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
We have to draw these now

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
We have to draw these now

184
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
We have to draw this

185
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Oh my God

186
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm drawing this

187
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm drawing this

188
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I can't see

189
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
This is so bad

190
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Oh no

191
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Nothing

192
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Wait

193
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Smell a smaller sheet

194
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Oh no, why are you

195
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Why are you drawing this?

196
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I don't even know what's happening

197
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I can't see anything

198
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Why are you guys screaming?

199
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Oh my God

200
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
How much time is left

201
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Why is it left on my God?

202
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
The top right corner is the indicator

203
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Not the shading

204
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm an artist

205
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
I wish I brought my drawing tablet out

206
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
An artist

207
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Oh yeah, wait

208
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
All you can fucking draw about me

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
No, we're using our moses

210
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I can look up with the logo

211
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
We need to do a witness time

212
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Oh

213
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
What the fuck am I doing

214
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
What is this shit

215
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
I should whip out my drawing tablet

216
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
for this

217
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Actually it's better with a mouse

218
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Better with a mouse

219
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
No, it's better with a mouse

220
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
It looks like hot garden

221
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
It looks great

222
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
It's like a fucking cave

223
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
I think I'm done

224
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Would you?

225
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm done

226
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm done

227
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
What's that say

228
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Can't tell you

229
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
These are items

230
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Okay, that's all I'm saying

231
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I fucking

232
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
100% wood

233
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Why not

234
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
We need to put the chat logs in quick

235
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
These are the chat logs

236
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Oh good answer

237
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Chat logs?

238
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
You guys aren't ready for mine

239
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Let's put a bit of detail

240
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
We need some wood detail

241
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Americans always have like an eagle

242
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Freak

243
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
You're trying to describe it

244
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
What is this

245
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
What the fuck

246
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Ew

247
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Oh shit

248
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Oh

249
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
There we go

250
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
There we go

251
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
What do you think

252
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Julie

253
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Julie

254
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh no

255
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Bro

256
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
I

257
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I was supposed to

258
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
My gen mates are wild

259
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Fuck

260
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Oh my god

261
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
I don't know what he looks like

262
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Oh god

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Hold on

264
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
She be sent so far away

265
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Cause I don't know what my mic

266
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Oh right

267
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I don't know what Thornberry looks like

268
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Oh no

269
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
I had to look it up

270
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
I'm just going for it

271
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Right

272
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
What do I look like

273
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Oh wait

274
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
I don't look like that

275
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Sugar

276
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Don't question

277
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
They can't curve

278
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Bunches

279
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Don't question this

280
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
What the fuck

281
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
How do you draw

282
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
I don't know

283
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
I don't know

284
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I don't know

285
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Oh my

286
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Perfect

287
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh I don't know how to draw

288
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
I don't know how to draw anymore

289
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
That's great

290
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
That's pretty good right

291
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
They agree with me

292
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Oh my god

293
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
This is something

294
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Hold on

295
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Oh shit

296
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Ginger in it

297
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Sweet

298
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
I don't know what

299
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
This is awful

300
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm sorry

301
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
This is

302
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I don't know

303
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Let's draw some hair

304
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Oh my god

305
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Oh my goodness

306
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Draw his thorn

307
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
His nose

308
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Just google a picture

309
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm still late

310
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
The phone rang

311
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
That is very nice thank you

312
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
I'm glad you agree to it

313
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
My little leaflings are saying I'm a true artist

314
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Your hair is not orange

315
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Is it?

316
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Oh my god

317
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Wait I'm ginger

318
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Are you blonde

319
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Your hair is orange

320
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
I thought I was blonde

321
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
This whole time

322
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
I've been drawing myself

323
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
What the fuck are you looking at

324
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
I'm sorry

325
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
In my image

326
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
What does that even say

327
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
May I

328
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Eat

329
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Oh meow

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Oh my god

332
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Meow

333
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Which one of you speaks Spanish

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Cause I

335
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Oh lord

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
What

337
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Oh

338
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
How am I supposed to draw that

339
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh my god

340
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Oh my god

341
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Did we even have

342
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
What do I look like

343
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Oh wait I can't even draw the fucking toilet

344
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Alright hold on

345
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
What do I even look like

346
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Oh

347
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
This is terrible

348
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
This is so hard with a mouse

349
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Um

350
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
I love this shit

351
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
It's so fucking cursed

352
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Hits his armpits

353
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
We're grabbing onto the ground

354
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
We're holding onto your life

355
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Right armpits

356
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
So

357
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I don't know

358
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Oh my god

359
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Cause

360
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Cause none of you guys know like some English phrases

361
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Or some like

362
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Jokey phrases so I can already

363
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Like what I'm hearing is that a lot of you guys are misinterpreting

364
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
What I've written and it's very funny

365
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
It's going all over his back

366
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
It's not looking good

367
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Edit

368
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
How do you draw an angry mouse

369
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Like a

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Oh there we go

371
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
And then

372
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
And we need

373
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
We need to draw

374
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Weeds of sweat

375
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
This is amazing

376
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
What does the Walmart logo look like

377
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
What

378
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Your armpits has become sentience

379
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Walmart

380
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm not even going to explain to Mercy

381
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Are you going to call it toilet?

382
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Oh wait

383
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Don't do toilet

384
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Oh wait

385
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
I see

386
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
It makes it worse

387
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
It makes it worse

388
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Oh my god

389
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
I think that works out

390
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Oh my god

391
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I can't wait to see everyone

392
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
All according

393
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Now we'll get to see everything

394
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
There's going to be no voice over

395
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
And then we'll do

396
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Beginning from the end

397
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Okay

398
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
So

399
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
So I said

400
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
I see with Nigel Thornberry's face

401
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Saying smashing

402
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
And Mercy's

403
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
I see

404
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
My favorite mood

405
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Mashery

406
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Mash

407
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Scrum

408
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Scrum

409
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
This is over

410
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Oh my god

411
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Oh my god

412
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Oh my god

413
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Okay

414
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Go ahead

415
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Oh no

416
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Oh boy

417
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Your honor

418
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
She wanted it

419
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh my god

420
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
She said it's going to jail for the crabs

421
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
You know date look

422
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Oh no

423
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Okay

424
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Oh my god

425
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
I love it

426
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I love it

427
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
It actually worked out

428
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Why is your OG Santa such a fat cock?

429
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Yeah

430
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Because he loves me

431
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
And his dick grows thick

432
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
With all the love you have for me

433
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
They grew sick of times that day

434
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
All right

435
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Sestrani's

436
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm sorry

437
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Oh my god

438
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Mercy's cheesy

439
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Festival in Feet

440
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Oh no

441
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
I feel like her feet is actual cheese

442
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I know

443
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
I like that

444
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I like that

445
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Stinky Pete's

446
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
But like

447
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
And then she drew

448
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Pits

449
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Oh my god

450
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Oh my god that's too good

451
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
She's cutting out

452
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
She's screaming so loud

453
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
That's her

454
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Okay

455
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Very good artist

456
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Thank you

457
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
What does that even mean?

458
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
When your job is a poo

459
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
So when your poo hits your prostate

460
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
On the way out it feels good

461
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Oh my god

462
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
What is this?

463
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Is Amy sucking?

464
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Amy suckers on them hot toes

465
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Oh wait, is she giving a blowjob?

466
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
That's what it looks like

467
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Mercy what did you draw?

468
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
What does it look like to me?

469
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Oh my god

470
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Really?

471
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Oh my god

472
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I love the drool

473
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
This is so fucking good

474
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
The drool is so good

475
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Oh boy

476
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
We are

477
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Over some pie

478
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Okay

479
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
That was pretty good

480
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
That's really cute toilets

481
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
That's not a cat

482
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
That's not a cat

483
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Meow

484
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Meow

485
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Meow winky face

486
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Okay it's a winky face

487
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I was like what is meowers

488
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
I was like no one speaks Spanish

489
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I didn't hire anyone to speak Spanish

490
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Neato

491
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Neato

492
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Neato

493
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
That's good

494
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
I love that

495
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Okay this makes sense

496
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
This makes sense of what

497
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
on earth we were drawing

498
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Because I was to check out

499
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
And like that's items on the shelves

500
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I worked really hard

501
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
I didn't get that

502
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Oh this is a good diaper

503
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
I see understood me

504
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
I love the details

505
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Take the magic

506
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Honestly

507
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Why is it coming out of his back

508
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
It's fighting for his life

509
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
It's going everywhere

510
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
It's going everywhere

511
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
It's like air is back

512
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
I can't

513
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I had toilet stole cap

514
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Because that's all I see about

515
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
When I like see American memes

516
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
They're like oh the toilet stole

517
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
The toilet gap is so big

518
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
You can literally look at people's eyes

519
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Is it not like that

520
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
It's a different version

521
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
We have them closed

522
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Because you know it's a private time

523
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
And you're very vulnerable taking a big job

524
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
So yeah it's actually closed everywhere

525
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Else in the planet

526
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
You're so lucky

527
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,040
I had people peeking at me

528
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
In high school through the stalls

529
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Me too

530
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Oh no it didn't

531
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Is there a check

532
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Is there a check

533
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Is there a DC check

534
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Do you need to reload that

535
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
It's gonna

536
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Do it on its own usually

537
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
No I'm gone

538
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
The link should be in the discord

539
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord

540
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Don't

541
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Do that

542
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Of our naughty photos

543
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
We just sent to each other

544
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
It's mostly memes

545
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Any memers

546
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
I mean to be fair we did share

547
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Some naughty photos

548
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
We did share some

549
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Lucky nudes of ours

550
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
They've seen my TTs

551
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,040
So uh

552
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
I started roleplaying as the girls with my nudes

553
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
So I was like this is what Ibi would do

554
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
This is what Acey would do

555
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
This discord is so chaotic

556
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Okay real though

557
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
But also I did snort out my T

558
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
It like went down the wrong hole

559
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
And went up my nose

560
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Wow mercy I hear snort and

561
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
T

562
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
This is what galley offers

563
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
A stosterone

564
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Is this better

565
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Yeah

566
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Are you in game

567
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
I pushed it

568
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
That's what it's like so in my ears

569
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
I'm getting a little deep

570
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Getting another hard beat right now

571
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Every time she talks

572
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Have a turn

573
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
News or eye round news

574
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
What do you think

575
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Oopsy

576
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Oopsy

577
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Oopsy

578
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
I feel like Azura could do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression

579
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Me too

580
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
Jennifer Coolidge

581
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Do do do do

582
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
I don't know

583
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Jennifer Coolidge's impression

584
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Wait you don't know Jennifer Coolidge

585
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Oh Jennifer Coolidge

586
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
I

587
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
I'm gonna switch

588
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Oh my god

589
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
I can't do it

590
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Oh my god

591
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Jennifer Coolidge

592
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
You can't go in your gap

593
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
For the Rizzler

594
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Why are we opening our gap

595
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
For the Rizzler

596
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Azura

597
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Azura

598
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Azura

599
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Click that link in the general

600
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Click that link

601
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
You can't go in

602
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
You can't go in

603
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
I can't go in

604
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
I can't go in

605
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
What is happening

606
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
You're making cuts

607
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
When you do that Azura

608
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
So it just goes

609
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Eww

610
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
What's happening

611
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
What's happening anymore

612
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
It's constantly loading

613
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
It's literally

614
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
It's literally

615
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Let me do another

616
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
I'm gonna

617
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Will you guys see the discord

618
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
If I open it okay you guys can't see it

619
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
No

620
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
I shouldn't see anything else

621
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I would close the window capture

622
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
In the OBS just in case

623
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Yes you can open it

624
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Are we restarting a new lobby

625
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
A new lobby

626
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
I think we should all invite to this lobby

627
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
A bit of all

628
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Why is there two

629
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Are we going to a different room

630
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
I don't know

631
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Why is there two

632
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
I only see one of you

633
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
No on mine

634
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
There's

635
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
No

636
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Where'd you go

637
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Okay which one should we play

638
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Normal

639
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Which we just did

640
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Knock off, keep yourself focused

641
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster

642
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Animation

643
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Create an animation in a collaborative way

644
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Icebreaker, play with a sentence

645
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Ask questions and have fun with others drawings

646
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Exquisite co-ops

647
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings

648
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Don't know what that means

649
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Hold on

650
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Burt friends have a good time with that

651
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Compliment, complete the sketch

652
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations

653
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Masterpiece, create a piece of art

654
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Play in a single turn with no time limit

655
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
I feel like story would be funny

656
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Let's try a previous sentence

657
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Story, story, story

658
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Do you want to do a story

659
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Let's try a story

660
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
What are you doing

661
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Sorry

662
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Oh

663
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Wait do I have to write a full story

664
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Or just a sentence

665
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
Just a sentence

666
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Okay

667
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Oh

668
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Do you like write the whole story

669
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Or no

670
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
You have really limited characters

671
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
I don't know it

672
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
No

673
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
What did you do

674
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
There's time

675
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
15 seconds love

676
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I wanted to write more

677
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
I wanted to write more

678
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
I can only write one sentence

679
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Shit

680
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
I feel like I should be drunk

681
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
We are not beating the caca

682
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
No we're not

683
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
What the fuck is happening

684
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Oh they're going to know this is me spelling it

685
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Because I didn't use that Z

686
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Don't know

687
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm just going to leave it like that

688
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Yep

689
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm sending it

690
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I'm not even spell checking

691
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
The lack of spell check is good

692
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Fuck it

693
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
I'm bad at stories

694
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
What is this

695
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Why

696
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
It's over

697
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Oh

698
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Oh the sentence is so small

699
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Like I want to give a bit more

700
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Me too

701
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
But it's too short

702
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
I think it gets shorter over time

703
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
I want to be like bi-

704
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Well I could have write until

705
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Fuck

706
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
What

707
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
What

708
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
You're sleeping

709
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Wow

710
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Let's see

711
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Oh no

712
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Fuck

713
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Fuck I'm so bad

714
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
It's funny because

715
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
I hate this I can't think of anything

716
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
The reeflings, the snowberries, the snippets

717
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
The pin pals

718
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
The bleedin' hearts

719
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
And the harem all get to see this unfold

720
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
And we're all just tapin' like

721
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Ugh

722
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Fuck it

723
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
Oh you

724
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Wait is that the fucking

725
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
You watch fucking

726
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Bank theory

727
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Wait that's a nice spell

728
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Paris

729
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Fuck

730
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Give me more

731
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
I need more letters

732
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
I need more like I can't

733
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
I don't know why they didn't

734
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Go ahead and play this

735
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
To help me spend song lyrics

736
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

737
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
That sounds like she me

738
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
No

739
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

740
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Wait

741
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
This

742
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
This agency

743
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
We can just

744
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
This agency

745
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
I spelled it wrong but that's the point

746
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,040
I hate that's like

747
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
They don't give you enough to write

748
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Yeah there's no story

749
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Not enough

750
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Fuck off

751
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Okay let's see what's happening

752
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
So how about everybody

753
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Read their own story like

754
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Okay

755
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Okay I go first

756
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
In a galaxy far far away

757
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
There was a goat with big titties

758
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
She had so much milkers

759
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
It started raining milk

760
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Azera then went home

761
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
To make an empire bane milk daily

762
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
It was so successful

763
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
The neighboring kingdoms became jealous

764
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
They also

765
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Wanted some of the juicy

766
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Ew cooties

767
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
We're not good

768
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Okay long time ago

769
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
In a kingdom called far away

770
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
There was a boy by princess

771
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Who was trying to fit into

772
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Their love was stronger than any foreign addiction

773
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
They couldn't stop jerking

774
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I'm so sorry I'm jerking

775
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

776
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
They say it's just a jerk

777
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I was like this agency

778
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Ding ding

779
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Ding ding

780
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
It was supposed to be the song like ding ding

781
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Ding ding

782
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
I was so hard

783
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,040
I was in Paris

784
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
There was a beach of agency

785
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
That was lit

786
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
They opened

787
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
And controlled the urges

788
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
So they danced

789
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
The pee pee danced until they kicked

790
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
And then finally they peed everywhere

791
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
On the floor

792
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
The walls, the bed, the kind

793
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
We're all filled with piss everywhere

794
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
But he loved it

795
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
The fact that we're going to piss

796
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Prompt before AC came out with that

797
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Let's just say there wasn't any AC

798
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Because of the board

799
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
AC came out of the board

800
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
I'm sorry

801
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
This is so good

802
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Okay

803
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Once upon a time there were whores

804
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
They were the elitist of whores

805
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
They had wild whores

806
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
They had all these really cute cowgirls

807
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
They had so cute

808
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
So fuzzy

809
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
So pussy warm

810
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Thanks

811
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
You're more like bang bang your mama

812
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Keep my mom out of your home now

813
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm sorry

814
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
10 out of 10

815
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
That's the time they were like this

816
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Oh no

817
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Oh no

818
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Oh no

819
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Oh shit

820
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:12,240
I know you guys know why I write the scripts in v-alert

821
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Why am I?

822
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,520
I think we can deserve a road of each other

823
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,520
She was sad because she realized she didn't have the frosting

824
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:27,520
Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?

825
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,520
She became sheep green tentacles

826
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Fuck no

827
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,520
So no, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic

828
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Azura, do you have a mic filter on? I can never hear you

829
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Who's turning that mic?

830
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Get that steel seat out

831
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
See that steel steering

832
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
No it's not

833
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Don't have a filter on

834
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
There's no filter on?

835
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
What is happening?

836
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Your steel series filter

837
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
I don't have a filter

838
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Don't have one on

839
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,520
What is happening?

840
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Can't wait for the void if they survive

841
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
They'll be fine

842
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
They'll be fine

843
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Do you want to try another one?

844
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Another, another, another

845
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Another one

846
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Please, please, no more shit

847
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
No more shit and piss

848
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
No more shit, stop

849
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
No promises

850
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
I didn't even do what you said

851
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
It was you guys

852
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Can we do a compliment?

853
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
We have promised one

854
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Compliment

855
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
All the actions are a mystery

856
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Drawings and sentences are hidden during this

857
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
You can't hear mercy, mercy test

858
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Mercy test?

859
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Sorry, I was muting because I was coughing

860
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
Okay, mercy test complete

861
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Do you want to do a compliment?

862
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
What is that?

863
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
We draw on each other's drawings

864
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
We should try that

865
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
I think that would be fun

866
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Can't wait to draw so much piss

867
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
That's the basic lines

868
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Start sketch some basic lines

869
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Okay

870
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
We'll do this

871
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Okay

872
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Okay

873
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Okay

874
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
We'll do this

875
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks

876
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Are you so cute?

877
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
What the fuck

878
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
You know exactly what you did

879
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
And no, I don't have the strength to resist

880
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
What's going on?

881
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
I got it, I can make this

882
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
I can salvage this

883
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
This is the back legs of it

884
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
And then this is its huge

885
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Mokers

886
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
And then this

887
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
This is its legs

888
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
There you go

889
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Only a few more left

890
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Uh huh

891
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
You're so dirty

892
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Don't be so dirty minded

893
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Honestly

894
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
I'll get the girl to tell you off

895
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
If you don't behave

896
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore

897
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
What

898
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Cute

899
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Rude to me

900
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Wait

901
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
Am I supposed to finish this off?

902
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Are we supposed to finish it all?

903
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
I think so because it's given us tons of time

904
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
Hold on

905
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Oh, okay

906
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I fixed it

907
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
I fixed it

908
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
A big fish up bro

909
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Oh my god, I've just made Chibi

910
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
What the hell

911
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I heard my name

912
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Oh wait, that's a thing

913
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Oh no, that looks like

914
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Dang it

915
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Let's just do that

916
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
There you go

917
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
I saved it

918
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
I saved it

919
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Babe, it gave you a lot more time

920
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Yeah, you're to finish it

921
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Ah, you need to finish

922
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Okay, I'm fucking stupid

923
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
Okay

924
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
So Am I, don't worry

925
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
I saved it

926
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Let me do it

927
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Let's put some nice shading in

928
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
To make this look extra beautiful

929
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Wow

930
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
Let's put lipstick on

931
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Yeah

932
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
So beautiful

933
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
I saved it

934
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
They pranked me

935
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
I think this is the best time

936
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Who drew a pair of hairy ball sacks?

937
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
Come on

938
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
What?

939
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
What are we supposed to do with this?

940
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
She's supposed to add the shaft

941
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Oh, I really know what I want to do

942
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
But I know I shouldn't do it

943
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Because we're on YouTube

944
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
I'm fixing this

945
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Oh no

946
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
I can't

947
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
One thing

948
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
This is amazing

949
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
Oh wait, maybe, hold on

950
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
I got it

951
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
I got it

952
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
I got it

953
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Fuck, how do I go back

954
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
The snow bears

955
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,520
They've got a big head

956
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
Wow

957
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
I've drawn them too

958
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
This is so fucking good

959
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Let's fucking go

960
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
I'm trying so hard right now

961
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
I can't even think of anything to say

962
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
Oh my gosh

963
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
Imagination

964
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
There you go

965
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Look at you all

966
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
I'm so proud of you

967
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Your laugh is so cute

968
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
Thank you

969
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
I love you so much

970
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I just think I did mine really well

971
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
Yeah, it's a water bottle

972
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
That's the best I got

973
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,520
I saved the pair of ball sacks

974
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Did you make it into a dog or something?

975
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
No

976
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
It just works

977
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
Can you

978
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
Tenpais, can you do better? Shut the fuck up

979
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,520
I love when you do that

980
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
Shut the fuck up

981
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
Oh my god

982
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
What is this?

983
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
Wow

984
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
You're asking me not to draw a vagina with those

985
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Oh my god

986
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
What do I do?

987
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
How am I supposed to do with this?

988
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,520
How am I supposed to do this?

989
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,520
How do I save this?

990
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,520
I need to do this all for memory

991
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,520
I won't draw that

992
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Oh my god

993
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
I just realized

994
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
I'll draw this instead

995
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,520
You thought women were less immature than men?

996
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
You're wrong

997
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,520
I wasn't going to draw a coochie

998
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
or a woman giving birth

999
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1000
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,520
I literally don't know what the fuck

1001
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
I'm doing right now

1002
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
Wait hold on

1003
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Oh my god

1004
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
I have time

1005
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
Can you guess who it is now?

1006
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1007
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
Fuck

1008
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,520
Fuck

1009
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Be like ones

1010
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Pen pals

1011
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
Pen pals

1012
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Quick quick quick quick

1013
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
I'm running out of time

1014
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Oh my god

1015
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
This is okay

1016
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
And then volcano

1017
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
These are like ones

1018
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,520
Oh oh oh

1019
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying

1020
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,520
I got it I got it

1021
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,520
I don't know

1022
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
I don't know

1023
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,520
Oh god

1024
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Reflex how could I forget your fucking

1025
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
I

1026
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
I saved it

1027
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
I saved it

1028
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
I think I did a good job

1029
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,520
This is the best I got I ain't got none other than me

1030
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
Why do I feel like

1031
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
This is really bad this happened

1032
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
This is a really specific reference

1033
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
And I don't know if anyone can

1034
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
I get it but

1035
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
There used to be a flash game

1036
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Where your guy was on like a snowboard

1037
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
I love that game

1038
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,520
I know what you're talking about

1039
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,520
Someone literally just drawn that

1040
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
Literally this is perfect

1041
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,520
That's it that's my drawing

1042
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
Someone says lane rider

1043
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Oh is that what it's called?

1044
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
What

1045
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,520
What is bear pants

1046
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
Oh

1047
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
Is it panties

1048
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,520
I was so confused

1049
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
I saw people were asking me to draw

1050
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Bear wearing underwear

1051
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
I was like what the fuck is wrong with you guys

1052
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
Newsy pants

1053
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
I remember fancy pants

1054
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Cause he had big old

1055
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Pants that were

1056
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Fence

1057
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
Why not

1058
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
And now is not the time

1059
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
To pop a bomb in my lap

1060
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
Cause he blundered at me though

1061
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
You know the story

1062
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,520
I might make that up

1063
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
Right hydration check

1064
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
Girlies I don't want your boyfriend dying

1065
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
Okay

1066
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
You know the story

1067
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
Some water

1068
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,520
Pants

1069
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,520
He's guggling my balls sorry

1070
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,520
He had no hair color but his pants were yellow

1071
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,520
Let me do that for you

1072
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
Do you have a beard? I don't know

1073
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,520
I do something

1074
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Needs hip

1075
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
Yeah you're right I don't really know how to do that though

1076
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
Can I zoom in

1077
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,520
No

1078
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Yeah

1079
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
It's like a beer braid

1080
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
Braid is pants though

1081
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
Stop

1082
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
Yeah

1083
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
No fuck I didn't mean to add that

1084
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Who drew ball sacks everywhere

1085
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
It's not you sheebie

1086
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
No I didn't draw a ball sack

1087
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,520
Oh

1088
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,520
I got it

1089
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,520
Who's whispering

1090
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,520
What

1091
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
Who's whispering

1092
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,520
Zura's whispering some like

1093
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
Evil incantations to us

1094
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
See it's great

1095
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,520
It was definitely a Zura that drew the ball sack 100%

1096
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,520
I feel like this is a lie

1097
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,520
No I didn't draw it

1098
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,520
I'm really drawing over it right now

1099
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,520
If you guys didn't know

1100
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,520
Zura's ears actually have golden

1101
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,520
Little jewelry on the end of them

1102
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Oh

1103
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,520
This is icy

1104
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Pimped out with jewelry but it's like

1105
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
Not about anything

1106
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Here you go

1107
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
Going for her first bike ride

1108
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,520
Right

1109
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,520
Isn't cheating to a race? Ah fuck it is

1110
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,520
Okay

1111
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
Isn't it cute

1112
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,520
So if you didn't know

1113
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
When a women

1114
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
When a women like taste chat

1115
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,520
Oh my god

1116
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,520
It goes through the fabric

1117
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
Okay so they'll be like

1118
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
Oji-san is so happy for her

1119
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
I know this isn't a Zura

1120
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
It's cold

1121
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
That looks terrible get rid of that

1122
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Oh my god you can't just control Z

1123
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
What's wrong with my life

1124
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,520
I was trying to talk about lactation

1125
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Duh

1126
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,520
This is yeah it was right before she said

1127
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,520
Chocolate that was correct

1128
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,520
Milk

1129
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,520
Milk

1130
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
So painful

1131
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
That's the timer

1132
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,520
Oh

1133
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
I thought you were drawing a cute bunny face

1134
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
Nah they have some titties mate

1135
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
It's all I can see

1136
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,520
I can't see

1137
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,520
I have saved

1138
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
I have single handedly saved the stream probably

1139
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
We'll do that

1140
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,520
This is supposed to be the liquid

1141
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,520
The liquid

1142
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,520
Wait I just know I have to draw my own drawing

1143
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,520
But that's cheating

1144
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
I know what I wanted to draw

1145
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,520
That's nothing

1146
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Fine

1147
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing

1148
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,520
Fine

1149
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,520
I started it and I'm gonna finish it

1150
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
It's me

1151
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,520
Fucking mental

1152
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,520
I don't know

1153
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,520
I'm already pissed

1154
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,520
It's the odd

1155
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Okay

1156
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
Okay

1157
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
Okay

1158
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
I would talk

1159
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,520
But it takes too much brain power

1160
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,520
To do this

1161
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
I don't know

1162
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
My cats are fighting

1163
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,520
Stop

1164
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,520
This is a net

1165
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,520
I don't know

1166
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,520
What

1167
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
It's a pretty good net

1168
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,520
Hold on

1169
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
How do you spell squelch

1170
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Squelch?

1171
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,520
Yeah

1172
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
Yeah

1173
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,520
Is it the Amazon?

1174
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
Oh my god

1175
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
Is it the reverse Amazon position

1176
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,520
When the girls...

1177
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
What are you drawing?

1178
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520

1180
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,520
That's definitely what she's talking about

1181
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,520
Can they break it?

1182
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,520
Can they break it?

1183
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
Can they break it?

1184
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,520
Oh wait

1185
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,520

Alright

1188
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,520
Does anybody need to take a quick break

1189
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,520

1193
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,520
That was yours

1194
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
Okay

1195
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,520
Okay

1203
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,520
Is it Orser's hand?

1204
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,520
Yeah

1205
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,520

1206
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,520
What do you mean you're a bad artist

1207
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
That's a very good little bear

01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,520
Okay hold on

1401
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,520

01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,520
Oh that's not how you draw the whole gang

1403
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,520
Oh no

1404
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,520
Oh

1405
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,520
How the fuck do you draw something

1406
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,520
Sitting down oh my god I'm having a stroke

1407
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,520
I'm not the good king

1408
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,520
What on earth

1409
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,520
There's a good client

1410
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,520
I'm supposed to be a snow fairy

1411
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,520
I'm going to get beaten up by AC

1412
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,520
After this oh my god

1413
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,520
Oh my god what what

I want to draw harmony I want to draw unity

1415
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,520
Perfect

1416
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,520
I can't draw like this

1417
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,520
Wait it has kind of like

1418
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,520
Who's next

1419
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,520
We need to draw the devilish

1420
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,520
Fuck this is hard cause like

1421
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,520
I don't know what to fucking draw

1422
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,520
Get creative nerds

1423
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,520
Geez it's not that

1424
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,520
It's not that hard you can do

1425
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,520
Okay Miss Artist

1426
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,520
Okay

1427
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,520
Eventually

1428
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,520
Amy's like I'm just going to draw myself casual

1429
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,520
And it comes out with like this fucking

1430
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,520
Banger of a commission

1431
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,520
It would probably cost like 500 dollars to do

1432
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,520
And she like bangs it out

1433
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,520
And I'm like oh my god

1434
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,520
I'm going to make a vtuber model

1435
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,520
He he

1436
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,520
Wish I could

1437
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,520
Wish I had a finger

1438
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,520
Nerval talent

1439
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,520
Speaking of that

1440
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
They were like thank you for not

1441
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,520
Tying down your talents

1442
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,520
To the designs that you assign them

1443
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,520
And they can be more themselves and I'm like

1444
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,520
Yeah well why would I do that

1445
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,520
I was like

1446
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,520
I don't know why I feel like it's such a basic things

1447
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,520
What the fuck do I need to draw next

1448
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,520
A bleeding heart

1449
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,520
Yeah we're more like

1450
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Building upon the characters

1451
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Rather than

1452
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Changing everything

1453
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,520
Cause um

1454
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,520
Right at the vtuber

1455
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,520
They were like the only thing that would have been better

1456
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,520
Is if you let them design

1457
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,520
Their models like from the start

1458
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,520
I'm like bro it took me a fucking year to get here

1459
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,520
Like oh my god give me like a fucking

1460
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,520
It takes forever

1461
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,520
To

1462
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,520
Draw and rig a vtuber model

1463
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
Yeah

1464
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,520
You can ask Amy she knows how to

1465
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,520
She knows how to do it

1466
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,520
It's a lot of work

1467
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,520
Oh my god

1468
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,520
Yeah there's only a select few corpos that will

1469
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,520
Let you do that

1470
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,520
Oh shit

1471
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,520
Man this is rough

1472
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,520
Usually ones that have like artists in house as well

1473
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,520
Ahh

1474
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,520
Yeah we don't

1475
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,520
This is so bad

1476
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
Most companies

1477
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,520
If not all of them

1478
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,520
Say for you

1479
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,520
Will have pre

1480
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
Pre-made

1481
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,520
Pre-made

1482
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,520
It's actually standard for people to choose

1483
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,520
Yeah it's really not

1484
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,520
You

1485
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,520
That's why it's usually they cast for the roles

1486
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,520
You have to fit the

1487
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,520
Character they're looking for

1488
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,520
Oh oh oh

1489
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,520
It's magic

1490
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,520
Oh oh

1491
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,520
It's magic

1492
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,520
You know

1493
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,520
Oh

1494
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,960
What is this

1495
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,880
Are we ready? Yeah, I'm ready

1496
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,800
Just draw it your way. Yeah, that's the fun part. Yeah

1497
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,880
I've already forgot which position

1498
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,040
Oh

1499
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,000
Sorry, we flinch honestly, I would talk more but this takes so much brainpower to do

1500
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:29,360
Reading chat I'm reading everything, but I'm not responding. I'm so sorry because we everyone's

1501
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,400
I'm just really in this

1502
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,520
Fucking losing it. Oh

1503
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,680
My god, wait

1504
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,440
That's far too short, so this is why it's chaotic

1505
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,440
Oh my god

1506
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,520
Okay

1507
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:23,160
Oh sure, there's like a lot of time we draw this as fast as we can

1508
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,360
Can't remember what it looks like

1509
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,080
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way, cuz I don't think I saw it

1510
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,800
supposed to be a person in it, I don't know

1511
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Oh, it's already have

1512
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Oh

1513
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,440
My god

1514
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,520
Okay, okay, okay, we can do this

1515
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,840
Do this, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's go. Don't panic

1516
01:10:44,840 --> 01:11:11,080
Okay, this is easy. This is easy. This has to be men's this has to be men's

1517
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,840
Fucking go

1518
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,360
Man this looks like shit

1519
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,840
Oh

1520
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,280
At least it stayed a cat

1521
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,240
Oh

1522
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,020
Oh they're cute!

1523
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:35,820
It's no face

1524
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,900
Oh we're argued in real time

1525
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,360
Like egg and faces

1526
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:51,080
At the end of the day, or I'll just stick ring here

1527
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,220
Okay, this is good this stage

1528
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,240

What have we not done

1536
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,200
All the actions are mystery drawing and sentences are hitting during the game

1537
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,240
I've never done that one before

1538
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:57,480
Okay, we'll try we're doing secret right last room boys last room. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um

1539
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,640
Oh, shit. Oh what I can't see what I'm writing

1540
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,680
How do I just know what I'm writing?

1541
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,160
Wait what?

1542
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,040
Huh

1543
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:16,760
Yeah, oh no, wait you run it with freaking words. Oh bro. I can't erase my

1544
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,560
I don't know

1545
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,800
It just appears. Oh, we can't see what we're drawing

1546
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,960
Okay, we'll drop out

1547
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,520
Okay

1548
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,360
Okay, I don't know I think

1549
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,320
I'm gonna just guess

1550
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,600
What it is where it is

1551
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,520
What the fuck?

1552
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,400
Oh, no, no

1553
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,360
Uh, I'm gonna try to draw. Why is it so hard to draw with a mouse?

1554
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,360
Oh

1555
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:18,200
These are the past can I can I go backwards does it work like that?

1556
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,800

Okay, he's somewhere there

1560
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,400
I have no idea

1561
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,480
Okay

1562
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,440
Okay

01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:54,200
Okay, that's a lot all wrong

1564
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,520
Okay

1565
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,560
Oh

1566
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,760
Oh, I don't know what else to draw that's that's exactly what I drew I think

1567
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,320
This is a vain reference. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1568
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,200
Locked in I locked in did I give

1569
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:39,800
Wait, did I give them bodies? I don't think I gave them bodies. Oh my god. I don't even know where they are

1570
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,720
I don't know

1571
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,720
I'm taking a shot in the dark

1572
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,560
That is gonna be interpreted as

1573
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,440
And will I stop the creative flow do you

1574
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,360
Wait, oh my god. Who's no emmy emmy's got a hoodie here. Oh sugar. I don't

1576
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,280
I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing anymore. I'm fucking dying

1577
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,400
What what is this?

1578
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,040
What is this

1579
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,160
Someone had a stroke whoever drew this one. Hope you're feeling okay. Hope you didn't all right make sure you hydrate

1580
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,120
How do I even draw this

1581
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
This is uh

1582
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,320
Mm-hmm

01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:59,560
I only watch 24 minutes of it by laugh so hard. I am literally dead tired from laughing and coughing

1646
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:08,920
Right we wanted to we wanted to play power wash simulator, but we couldn't get everyone to connect it just wasn't working

1647
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,280
I don't know

1648
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,280
I'm gonna leave that game but you can literally hear my voice is leaving

1649
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,360
um

1650
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,360
I don't know who to raid

1651
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,880
Yeah, I don't

1652
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,200
Is um

1653
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:39,400
Is strony playing roblox or is that a roblox ad that's a roblox ad is she talking

1654
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,120
I

1655
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,120
Guess I'm rest. I will I will

1656
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:51,080
But I wanted to redirect into someone but I don't know who

1657
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,640
Strony's pissed and oh

1658
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:05,160
Is mercy still going okay, I'll redirect into strony because I know that strony will

1659
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,720
stream

1660
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,640
I don't know who's ending, but I know I am

1661
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:18,200
I had so much the fun. Thank you for the peeler stream. You're welcome. I had fun too

1662
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,280
I know I didn't know that I was ginger

1663
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,600
Didn't know that I was ginger. I thought I was blonde

1664
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,240
Maybe I'll make myself more ginger because

1665
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:37,640
I really thought I was just like a really really bright blonde and I was wondering like why is my hair so

1666
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:43,160
Like bright blonde. It's because I'm fucking ginger. What the fuck?

1667
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,440
And every time I was drawing myself. I was drawing myself as like a blonde blonde

1668
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,240
Because I thought I was supposed to be blonde

1669
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,680
I'm ginger

1670
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,560
Well

1671
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,520
Yeah, it all makes sense now

1672
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:05,000
I probably might change my emo design to look more ginger

1673
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,480
Because like ginger people have like reddish hair, don't they?

1674
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,640
Strawberry blood. No, no

1675
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,160
No, so

1676
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:21,720
It does make sense. I still love you even though you're ginger. Thank you

1677
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,160
I still love you too

1678
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,160
Even though you're dead

1679
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:31,000
Okay, uh, let me let me

1680
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:37,960
Fuck that's what I wanted. Did I I need to I need to add the redirect

1681
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:44,680
Reddish orange. Yeah, like ginger people have like reddish orange hair

1682
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:52,360
And mine looks really blonde to be ginger. Not shitting on the model artist or anything

1683
01:31:52,360 --> 01:32:00,360
Next time look at ginger people though. I know it's hard to look at them because they're so fucking pale, but like

1684
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,560
Use your references

1685
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,360
You saw me using all my references

1686
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:11,880
During this game. Um, oh, oh Zeriz playing Sturge Valley though

1687
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,240
Ginger the whole time

1688
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,600
Yeah, it does look really blonde. That's what I'm saying

1689
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,760
Um

1690
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,120
Right, I'll redirect into Azura. Yeah

1691
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,560
Okay, there we go

1692
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,520
So

1693
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,160
I didn't realize so that that's what I yeah, I didn't realize

1694
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:51,480
Ginger's scary you good. You should be scared of me. I'm scary

1695
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,200
girl

1696
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,200
You're pissing your pants yet

1697
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,760
Yeah, it explains the freckles, but you know

1698
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,440
Not not only ginger people have freckles, so I wasn't sure

1699
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:09,720
Um, but yeah, I'll stream tomorrow. I'll start stream around, uh, 12

1700
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:23,640
I don't know how long I'll go probably not too long. Um, we'll see. We'll see

1701
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,720
You're not you're not scary. You're an adorable ginger

1702
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:38,040
I'm glad I'm glad you think I'm cute. I sound so fucking gross and snotty right now

1703
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,000
It's because my voice has gone from screaming and laughing

1704
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,600
Right

1705
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:51,560
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Um, really early in the day. You better be there or else I'm gonna cry. Um

1706
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,520
Um, yeah

1707
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,640
See you later

1708
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,440

1709
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,040
