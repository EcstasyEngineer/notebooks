05:23.080 --> 05:28.080
I'm once again eating sausage rolls

05:28.080 --> 05:36.080
Strani asks if you are on RuneScape with her right now, no?

05:36.080 --> 05:40.080
I don't even know how to play RuneScape, I don't have RuneScape

05:40.080 --> 05:44.080
why is someone trolling her?

05:44.080 --> 05:48.080
is someone trolling her as me or something?

05:48.080 --> 05:56.080
I'm dipping my sausage rolls in sriracha sauce too

05:56.080 --> 06:07.080
it was an imposter?

06:07.080 --> 06:14.080
you have RuneScape it came free with your xbox? why do you assume I have an xbox?

06:14.080 --> 06:17.080
I don't have an xbox

06:17.080 --> 06:23.080
don't forget to drink your water if you're gonna read everything ah fuck is there a lot of dialogue?

06:23.080 --> 06:27.080
this is gonna be rough, okay

06:27.080 --> 06:32.080
how long is this game? right yeah sorry today we're playing the coffin of Andy and Lele

06:32.080 --> 06:37.080
I've never played it before, apparently there's some themes that relate to me

06:37.080 --> 06:46.080
um now I know the, I know the um

06:46.080 --> 06:48.080
can I say it? I think I can say it

06:48.080 --> 06:55.080
I know the incest route is like an optional route so you're gonna have to um

06:55.080 --> 06:58.080
you're gonna have to lead me down that route

06:58.080 --> 07:03.080
okay um we're gonna have to go down that route

07:03.080 --> 07:06.080
you and me both are going down the incest route

07:06.080 --> 07:09.080
it's 10 hours long ah shit

07:09.080 --> 07:15.080
um okay well we can't finish it today then

07:15.080 --> 07:18.080
of course we're intentionally doing it, what do you mean?

07:18.080 --> 07:23.080
no blind run? no of course do you wanna, you're gonna watch me play this fucking game

07:23.080 --> 07:30.080
and you're gonna expect me to not go through the incest route, what do you mean?

07:30.080 --> 07:41.080
of course we're going down the incest route, it's not even a choice

07:41.080 --> 07:48.080
I can't do a 10 hour stream, I'm sorry

07:48.080 --> 07:58.080
right before we start let me test something

07:58.080 --> 08:00.080
my name is Andy I don't think I should be watching this

08:00.080 --> 08:04.080
well you're in luck because my name is Lele

08:04.080 --> 08:09.080
today I'm Lele or is it Lele? it's not Lele is it?

08:09.080 --> 08:17.080
it's Lele right?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.080
it should come naturally to me? I don't know

08:20.080 --> 08:26.080
I'm not really good at getting the endings I want in visual novels

08:26.080 --> 08:30.080
so I don't know if I'll be able to get the right ending

08:30.080 --> 08:35.080
alright so I think I fixed the super chat, not the super chat, the tip

08:35.080 --> 08:43.080
so let me test it out

08:43.080 --> 08:45.080
what should I say?

08:45.080 --> 08:50.080
give me a sentence to test the tip alert with

08:50.080 --> 08:54.080
give me a funny sentence

08:54.080 --> 09:03.080

13:38.080 --> 13:40.080
exit shift to run

13:40.080 --> 13:44.080
I have to run in this game?

13:45.080 --> 13:48.080
it's an RPG maker game

13:48.080 --> 13:50.080
the native resolution is a square

13:50.080 --> 13:52.080
oh that's stupid they should stop doing that

13:52.080 --> 13:56.080
no one's monitor is square shaped anymore

13:56.080 --> 13:58.080
make them rectangle

13:58.080 --> 14:00.080

14:42.080 --> 14:45.080
why are you acting so gay?

14:45.080 --> 14:48.080
an eating animation is the absolute best

14:48.080 --> 14:50.080

18:19.080 --> 18:21.080
it's Lele

18:22.080 --> 18:24.080
yeah oh yeah we have to feed Lele

18:24.080 --> 18:26.080
you're used to filling your stomach with water

18:26.080 --> 18:28.080
that's not true at all

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
but it's not enough your body needs sustenance

18:30.080 --> 18:32.080
nah nah

18:32.080 --> 18:34.080
I'll be eaten

18:34.080 --> 18:36.080
the coffee machine sits alone inside and abandoned

18:36.080 --> 18:38.080
there are only so many times you can brew the same

18:38.080 --> 18:40.080
grounds so no more

18:40.080 --> 18:42.080
coffee in this house

18:42.080 --> 18:44.080
brew the same grounds

18:44.080 --> 18:46.080
wait I don't know enough about coffee

18:46.080 --> 18:48.080
how's that work?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.080
should we all tell sis this is kind of a horror game?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.080
is it?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.080
can I eat the trash?

18:58.080 --> 19:00.080
this is where you and your older brother pile your trash

19:00.080 --> 19:02.080
it's already been scattered several times

19:02.080 --> 19:04.080
and this is utterly

19:04.080 --> 19:06.080
exhausted as the food source

19:06.080 --> 19:08.080
we're eating from the trash?

19:12.080 --> 19:14.080
it's not a horror game?

19:14.080 --> 19:16.080
it is a horror game and you're telling me it's not

19:16.080 --> 19:18.080
so that I get surprised

19:22.080 --> 19:24.080
what is that?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.080
a can of tomato! amazing

19:26.080 --> 19:28.080
you should show that to your brother

19:28.080 --> 19:30.080
okay

19:32.080 --> 19:34.080
wait what?

19:34.080 --> 19:36.080
I've been locked in

19:36.080 --> 19:38.080
it's not exactly horror?

19:40.080 --> 19:42.080
it has horror elements

19:42.080 --> 19:44.080
okay okay I'll come show you

19:44.080 --> 19:46.080
which way? where's the door?

19:46.080 --> 19:48.080
this way? the bathroom door is locked

19:50.080 --> 19:52.080
oh this is the bathroom

19:52.080 --> 19:54.080
okay you're not in here

19:54.080 --> 19:56.080
where are you?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.080
oh there you are

19:58.080 --> 20:00.080
hi I have a can of tomatoes

20:00.080 --> 20:02.080
tada

20:02.080 --> 20:04.080
oh he looks annoyed

20:04.080 --> 20:06.080
not the reaction you were hoping for

20:08.080 --> 20:10.080
tada

20:10.080 --> 20:12.080
we're not eating that

20:12.080 --> 20:14.080
no

20:14.080 --> 20:16.080
that's the very last thing we have Ashley

20:16.080 --> 20:18.080
why are they so poor?

20:18.080 --> 20:20.080
it's just disturbing

20:20.080 --> 20:22.080
psychological horror

20:22.080 --> 20:24.080
can I like a moray then?

20:24.080 --> 20:26.080
horror

20:28.080 --> 20:30.080
I'm a horror so a horror game is perfect for me

20:32.080 --> 20:34.080
I think we should hold on to it a little longer

20:34.080 --> 20:36.080
quit your complaining

20:36.080 --> 20:38.080
you're energetic enough

20:38.080 --> 20:40.080
to go rummaging through our trash

20:40.080 --> 20:42.080
so clearly you're not dying yet

20:42.080 --> 20:44.080
huh?

20:44.080 --> 20:46.080
how did you know it wasn't?

20:46.080 --> 20:48.080
because I hid it there away from you

20:50.080 --> 20:52.080
I live in a den of snakes

20:52.080 --> 20:54.080
ah don't round me up

20:54.080 --> 20:56.080
you're making me hungry

20:56.080 --> 20:58.080
eat this pussy then

20:58.080 --> 21:00.080
do you know what?

21:00.080 --> 21:02.080
do you know what would help with that?

21:02.080 --> 21:04.080
Andrew my dear?

21:04.080 --> 21:06.080
no but the tomato

21:06.080 --> 21:08.080
I can't fucking read

21:08.080 --> 21:10.080
this is not a good game for me to play

21:10.080 --> 21:12.080
are you poor?

21:12.080 --> 21:14.080
why are you so poor?

21:16.080 --> 21:18.080
they're in quarantine?

21:20.080 --> 21:22.080
no put the tomatoes away somewhere

21:22.080 --> 21:24.080
put them in my mouth I will

21:24.080 --> 21:26.080
I can see that your heart is set on this

21:26.080 --> 21:28.080
fine let's eat them then

21:28.080 --> 21:30.080
screw our future selves

21:30.080 --> 21:32.080
screw our future selves

21:34.080 --> 21:36.080
time for you to go cook some tomatoes

21:38.080 --> 21:40.080
why are we living in such a

21:40.080 --> 21:42.080
such a stinkin

21:42.080 --> 21:44.080
warden

21:48.080 --> 21:50.080
every line you read is filled with thirst

21:50.080 --> 21:52.080
is it? hello

21:52.080 --> 21:54.080
if you won't make a sound

21:54.080 --> 21:56.080
I'll assume you're dead

21:56.080 --> 21:58.080
and I don't bring food to the dead

22:00.080 --> 22:02.080
you don't bring it to the living either

22:04.080 --> 22:06.080
I'll take that as a yes still alive

22:06.080 --> 22:08.080
and don't blame me for the delivery guy screwing up

22:10.080 --> 22:12.080
can you go grab something for us?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.080
oh from the store for us?

22:26.080 --> 22:28.080
your voice is perfect for this?

22:28.080 --> 22:30.080
I don't think it is

22:32.080 --> 22:34.080
I don't really think I sound like her

22:36.080 --> 22:38.080

22:48.080 --> 22:50.080
ok we'll fine I'll cook my tomatoes

22:50.080 --> 22:52.080
you boil the canned tomatoes to make delicious boiled canned tomatoes

22:52.080 --> 22:54.080
wow

22:54.080 --> 22:56.080
there's even a little bit of pepper left to season with

22:56.080 --> 22:58.080
this is some gourmet stuff right here

22:58.080 --> 23:00.080
no salt though

23:00.080 --> 23:02.080
well we're white people aren't we so it doesn't really matter

23:02.080 --> 23:04.080
we can handle it

23:04.080 --> 23:06.080
your voice is perfect in general

23:08.080 --> 23:10.080
thank you

23:14.080 --> 23:16.080
you've used all of it to spike your water

23:16.080 --> 23:18.080
in order to avoid over hydrating yourself

23:18.080 --> 23:20.080
while drinking

23:20.080 --> 23:22.080
to fill your stomach

23:22.080 --> 23:24.080
what the fuck

23:24.080 --> 23:26.080
well how is it

23:26.080 --> 23:28.080
at this point you could feed me a can of worms

23:28.080 --> 23:30.080
and I'd say it's the best thing I ever ate

23:30.080 --> 23:32.080
this is so depressing

23:32.080 --> 23:34.080
kiss ass

23:34.080 --> 23:36.080
no I'm saying that's how hungry I am

23:38.080 --> 23:40.080
it is in that moment

23:40.080 --> 23:42.080
an ominous audio assault to your eardrums

23:44.080 --> 23:46.080
are you kidding me

23:46.080 --> 23:48.080
the neighbors at it again

23:48.080 --> 23:50.080
want to take a peek? no

23:50.080 --> 23:52.080
but I'll come along if you do

23:52.080 --> 23:54.080
balcony key

23:54.080 --> 23:56.080
oh he's following me

23:56.080 --> 23:58.080
he's so cute

23:58.080 --> 24:00.080
salt is overrated

24:00.080 --> 24:02.080
no it's not

24:02.080 --> 24:04.080
season your fucking food

24:04.080 --> 24:06.080

24:06.080 --> 24:08.080
it's jake

24:12.080 --> 24:14.080
what's he doing over there

24:14.080 --> 24:16.080
can't really see squat from here

24:18.080 --> 24:20.080
if you should take a leap of faith towards the neighbors

24:20.080 --> 24:22.080
balcony we're gonna die

24:24.080 --> 24:26.080
don't even think about it

24:26.080 --> 24:28.080
oh he's no fun

24:28.080 --> 24:30.080
guess you'll have to set something up to cross

24:32.080 --> 24:34.080
the chair

24:34.080 --> 24:36.080
an ashtray

24:36.080 --> 24:38.080
there are no cigarettes left to smoke but it's still good for bashing things in

24:38.080 --> 24:40.080
like your head

24:42.080 --> 24:44.080
seasoning

24:44.080 --> 24:46.080
good at least you salt pepper onions and garlic

24:46.080 --> 24:48.080
use more than just salt

24:48.080 --> 24:50.080
pepper onions and garlic

24:52.080 --> 24:54.080
use all the seasonings you can

24:54.080 --> 24:56.080
are you kidding me

24:58.080 --> 25:00.080
I might be white but I can appreciate some good seasonings

25:02.080 --> 25:04.080

30:34.080 --> 30:36.080
I thought

30:36.080 --> 30:38.080
they said we should stay at home until

30:38.080 --> 30:40.080
I didn't drink anything

30:40.080 --> 30:42.080
mom not booze

30:42.080 --> 30:44.080
not dirty contaminated water

30:44.080 --> 30:46.080
nothing the only thing I've drank

30:46.080 --> 30:48.080
is some orange juice from a carton

30:50.080 --> 30:52.080
we love you even if you have parasites

30:52.080 --> 30:54.080

33:04.080 --> 33:06.080
after reminiscing all night

33:06.080 --> 33:08.080
you wake up as one does

33:08.080 --> 33:10.080

34:24.080 --> 34:26.080
an artist for it

34:26.080 --> 34:28.080
and it's really cute

34:28.080 --> 34:30.080
I'm literally a slime girl

34:30.080 --> 34:32.080

35:36.080 --> 35:38.080

35:40.080 --> 35:42.080

42:08.080 --> 42:10.080
oh

42:10.080 --> 42:12.080
oh

42:12.080 --> 42:33.440
I'm signing off, I'll see ya.

42:42.080 --> 42:53.840
Hello, I'm back.

42:53.840 --> 43:03.280
I didn't go pee, I just went to get more water.

43:03.280 --> 43:07.760
Go through the homework for real on each and ton look folder.

43:07.760 --> 43:14.640
I don't have a homework folder on this computer profile that is.

43:14.640 --> 43:19.000
Maybe on a different computer profile I do, but you're never going to see that one.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
You don't know the password to that one.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.760
Right.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.200
Um, Amy, did you wash your hands?

43:27.200 --> 43:29.200
I didn't pee, I just went to get more water.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.040
Shut up.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.880
I didn't, I don't need to wash my hands.

43:31.880 --> 43:38.400
Someone's talking on the other end of the line, but you can't make out the words.

43:38.400 --> 43:42.120
They sound more and more upset as they talk, though.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.720
Well, that's, I mean, I can't do anything about that.

43:45.720 --> 43:52.200
Or I can try talking to her, but sorry if my cadence when reading is shit.

43:52.200 --> 43:58.200
Um, yeah, it is.

43:58.200 --> 44:03.000
No, it's not big bro is cute 2024 and it's not I love on each and 13.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.720
Come on, I'm not, I'm not that predictable.

44:05.720 --> 44:07.320
What the hell?

44:07.320 --> 44:14.520
You think so lowly of me that I would put such a shit password?

44:14.520 --> 44:18.440
Um, no, I'm not angry.

44:18.440 --> 44:21.960
I'm just sounds like he's talking to a girlfriend.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.880
No, I can you let me talk?

44:24.880 --> 44:27.880
What's on the other end must have said no.

44:27.880 --> 44:31.640
It's increasingly allowed, but you still can't make out all the words.

44:31.640 --> 44:41.680
Always about you don't lay and Ashley and have the time to think.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.960
Just can't anymore.

44:42.960 --> 44:48.240
He is talking to his girlfriend.

44:48.240 --> 44:53.120
It's not dick on 69.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.440
Come on.

44:54.440 --> 45:01.120
I'm not that cringed.

45:01.120 --> 45:03.640
If you loved us, you'd make a deliberately easy password.

45:03.640 --> 45:04.640
It is.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.640
It is an easy password.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.080
It is an easy password.

45:08.080 --> 45:15.920
It's my, um, it's my school password from like when we had computer class in like second

45:15.920 --> 45:16.920
grade.

45:16.920 --> 45:21.920
It's the same password from all the way back then because I still remember it.

45:21.920 --> 45:28.920
I might be stupid, but I still have okay memory.

45:28.920 --> 45:34.800
It is not password 1234 shut up.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.800
So that's it then.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.800
Now it's quite on both ends.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.840
All right, I guess.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.840
What else is there to say?

45:41.840 --> 45:42.840
Sorry.

45:42.840 --> 45:49.480
I should really, I really don't see why I should be held accountable for a faint beep beep beep

45:49.480 --> 45:51.840
of a dropped call can be heard.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
Ah.

45:52.840 --> 45:53.840
Sorry.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.840
What was it?

45:54.840 --> 45:55.840
My ex-girlfriend apparently.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.840
Ooh, she dumped you.

45:56.840 --> 45:57.840
Why is that?

45:57.840 --> 45:58.840
Why do you think?

45:58.840 --> 45:59.840
How should I know?

45:59.840 --> 46:04.840
Maybe because you're a person-infested home buddy that's apparently permacore.

46:04.840 --> 46:07.840
Or because she found someone new.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.840
It's been a few months, buddy.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.840
Or maybe she just didn't like talking to you.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.840
Or maybe she just didn't like you that much in the first place.

46:17.840 --> 46:20.840
Whatever you say, Ashley.

46:20.840 --> 46:27.840
It might have been something more tact-ta- tactful to say.

46:27.840 --> 46:34.840
Yeah, he only needs me anyways.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.840
It doesn't matter.

46:36.840 --> 46:40.840
You don't need a freaking girlfriend.

46:40.840 --> 46:41.840
Whatever.

46:41.840 --> 46:46.840
You pretend to sleep until you really fall asleep again.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.840
Now you've been out for a while.

46:50.840 --> 46:51.840
Whatever.

46:51.840 --> 46:56.840
You pretend to sleep until you really fall asleep again.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.840
Now you've been out for who knows how long.

46:59.840 --> 47:04.840
You figure you should check on your brother.

47:04.840 --> 47:08.840
A VHS player cannot be eaten.

47:08.840 --> 47:10.840
I wouldn't try to eat- oh!

47:10.840 --> 47:11.840
Don't jump!

47:11.840 --> 47:12.840
Don't jump!

47:12.840 --> 47:13.840
Don't jump!

47:13.840 --> 47:15.840
Someone from your apartment is getting hauled into an ambulance.

47:15.840 --> 47:16.840
Hey, me too!

47:16.840 --> 47:18.840
People are yelling from their windows and balconies.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.840
I need some help too.

47:20.840 --> 47:21.840
Please, please.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.840
I'm starving.

47:22.840 --> 47:34.840
Soon the ambulance leaves in a hurry.

47:34.840 --> 47:36.840
Technically anything can be eaten.

47:36.840 --> 47:40.840
If you're brave enough, anything can be eaten, and anything can be a dildo.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.840
If you're brave enough.

47:42.840 --> 47:44.840
Soon the ambulance leaves in a hurry.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.840
Wee!

47:46.840 --> 47:49.840
Telling me surprise, they actually got that person some help.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.840
I figured they'd just let her die.

47:51.840 --> 47:52.840
Maybe she did die.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.840
She wasn't moving.

47:54.840 --> 47:58.840
As if they'd have their sirens blaring for a corpse.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.840
Then what do you suppose was her emergency?

48:01.840 --> 48:02.840
No idea.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.840
Nobody showed up when you fainted.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.840
Well, did you call for anyone?

48:07.840 --> 48:10.840
What do you think, dumbass?

48:10.840 --> 48:12.840
I don't know.

48:12.840 --> 48:14.840
Maybe she went into labor or something.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.840
Yeah, maybe.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.840
I think they'd bring me food if I got pregnant.

48:21.840 --> 48:22.840
No.

48:22.840 --> 48:24.840
Let me finish.

48:24.840 --> 48:26.840
How'd you even get pregnant in here?

48:26.840 --> 48:30.840
Well, we do have that one charming fellow right next door.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.840
Over my dead body.

48:32.840 --> 48:36.840
You're the only one that's supposed to get me pregnant.

48:36.840 --> 48:41.840
He seemed a little off his rocker, so who knows, he might just end you.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.840
Forget this.

48:48.840 --> 48:52.840
Well, excuse the hell out of me for exploring my options here.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.840
That woman didn't look pregnant anyways.

48:54.840 --> 48:59.840
Whatever, it's just a thought, jackass.

48:59.840 --> 49:04.840
You'd like to go after Andrew and tell him it ain't none of his damn business anyways,

49:04.840 --> 49:07.840
but you're just too exhausted.

49:12.840 --> 49:18.840
He was feeling a little jealous, wasn't he?

49:18.840 --> 49:22.840
After sleeping for a few hours, maybe a few days, who knows,

49:22.840 --> 49:26.840
you're fully revitalized and bursting with energy.

49:26.840 --> 49:28.840
Am I?

49:28.840 --> 49:31.840
I don't think I am.

49:31.840 --> 49:36.840
Yeah, if you keep making babies, you'll have infinite food because you can eat the babies.

49:36.840 --> 49:39.840
Oh, you silly lazy bones.

49:39.840 --> 49:43.840
What day is it? How long have you been locked in your apartment now?

49:43.840 --> 49:47.840
Where the hell does Andrew get the energy to make so much noise?

49:50.840 --> 49:52.840
Is he gonna break out?

49:52.840 --> 49:55.840
I'm gonna screw the lock and his attempting to kick the door in.

49:59.840 --> 50:02.840
Or out, depending on your perspective.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.840
How many more times are you gonna try that?

50:04.840 --> 50:07.840
It's clearly borrowed from the other side.

50:07.840 --> 50:10.840
What else am I supposed to do?

50:10.840 --> 50:15.840
If you don't stop banging on the door, I won't bring you any food tonight.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.840
You won't either way, says you.

50:17.840 --> 50:23.840
The delivery will be here in a matter of hours.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.840
But I guess you don't want anything.

50:26.840 --> 50:28.840
Yeah, that's right.

50:28.840 --> 50:32.840
You better stop banging, banging, banging on that door.

50:32.840 --> 50:35.840
Bounce, bounce, bounce it on my wood.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.840
I'm tired from bouncing on my wood all the time.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.840
You have to wait around nine months, though.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.840
You're right, you're right.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.840
It's not really an infinite food glitch, is it?

50:50.840 --> 50:52.840
You guys, what do you mean, ay-yo, what?

50:52.840 --> 50:55.840
Do you guys not watch anything on the internet?

50:55.840 --> 50:57.840
You don't know any memes?

50:57.840 --> 50:59.840
Could you give me some juice?

50:59.840 --> 51:02.840
What do you mean, some juice?

51:02.840 --> 51:04.840
Some eminade, is that what you mean?

51:07.840 --> 51:11.840
The warden doesn't like hearing the pets squeak at night.

51:14.840 --> 51:15.840
Are you gay?

51:15.840 --> 51:17.840
Why are you acting so gay?

51:17.840 --> 51:20.840
Oh, thank you for the three dollars, Anonymous, thank you.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.840
Shut up with my two inch wood!

51:22.840 --> 51:24.840
It's bigger than two inch!

51:24.840 --> 51:26.840
Stop it!

51:27.840 --> 51:31.840
It's gonna feel way bigger than two inch when you're bouncing on it.

51:32.840 --> 51:34.840
Cough, cough, cough.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.840
The man's footsteps fade away.

51:37.840 --> 51:41.840
Do you think they'll really get that delivery today?

51:41.840 --> 51:44.840
Like, I didn't even fuck this up for us, did I?

51:44.840 --> 51:46.840
Unlikely.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.840
Oh, I guess we'll see.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.840
And see you did!

51:50.840 --> 51:52.840
But absolutely nothing was delivered.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.840
Si.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.840
Talk about something!

51:56.840 --> 51:58.840
I got nothing. Try.

52:03.840 --> 52:11.840
Yeah, don't give me any ideas for Patreon food content.

52:15.840 --> 52:17.840
So, parasites.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.840
It's been a few months, are you feeling anything?

52:19.840 --> 52:20.840
Hunger?

52:20.840 --> 52:24.840
You'd think something would happen to us by now, but I haven't noticed anything.

52:24.840 --> 52:26.840
The nurse never came back either.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.840
Like, don't you want to monitor us?

52:28.840 --> 52:30.840
Ugh, who cares?

52:30.840 --> 52:32.840
Me, Ashley, I care.

52:32.840 --> 52:33.840
Well, I don't.

52:33.840 --> 52:36.840
Care, nor care that you care.

52:42.840 --> 52:47.840
I can't believe that two people this hot would not sleep together after months of being trapped.

52:48.840 --> 52:51.840
You've been, you've been normie-pilled, apparently.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.840
Because, um...

52:54.840 --> 52:56.840
Wait, no, not normie-pilled.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.840
Their brother and sister get normie-pilled.

52:59.840 --> 53:02.840
Of course they haven't slept together!

53:04.840 --> 53:06.840
They're normies.

53:16.840 --> 53:17.840
They should, though.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.840
Don't worry, we'll make it happen together.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.840
Aside from starving, it's not so bad here.

53:22.840 --> 53:24.840
Come again?

53:24.840 --> 53:26.840
Aside from starving, I like it here.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.840
Well, I don't.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.840
I want to jump off the balcony.

53:30.840 --> 53:32.840
Ooh, I'll race you.

53:32.840 --> 53:34.840
No, seriously, let's go.

53:34.840 --> 53:35.840
Let's not, though.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.840
I appreciate your eagerness to join me.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.840
Are they normies?

53:39.840 --> 53:41.840
I don't know, I just started the game, I just got here.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.840
Are they not normies?

53:44.840 --> 53:48.840
After the first month or so, they wouldn't care anymore, right?

53:50.840 --> 53:52.840
Oh my god.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.840
Your brain has been rotted by porn.

53:56.840 --> 53:59.840
Come on, guys, use your coffin sets!

54:02.840 --> 54:05.840
But it's a bit too romantic, so I'll pass.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.840
Excuse me?

54:07.840 --> 54:08.840
What, you don't see it?

54:08.840 --> 54:10.840
Just imagine hitting the ground together.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.840
Oh, fuck!

54:12.840 --> 54:16.840
And with such force, our bodies would turn into a pile of gory mush,

54:16.840 --> 54:18.840
never to be separated.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.840
Our remains would get so tangled up,

54:20.840 --> 54:22.840
we'd have to bury us together in the same coffin.

54:22.840 --> 54:24.840
Hot!

54:24.840 --> 54:25.840
Might as well.

54:25.840 --> 54:28.840
We've been confined together in this coffin of an apartment

54:28.840 --> 54:30.840
for what feels like an eternity already.

54:30.840 --> 54:33.840
I'm not jumping off the balcony with you.

54:33.840 --> 54:35.840
Get your head checked.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.840
I should get my head checked?

54:38.840 --> 54:40.840
He said the line, what line?

54:44.840 --> 54:46.840
Do you mean how is that hot?

54:46.840 --> 54:48.840
It's hot.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.840
It's hot!

54:52.840 --> 54:54.840
No wonder your girlfriend dumped you.

54:54.840 --> 54:56.840
If those are your plans for romance, oh wait, hold on.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.840
Let me have a- let me get a cough drop.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.840
He said the title?

55:01.840 --> 55:04.840
Oh, coffin of an ab-

55:04.840 --> 55:06.840
The title is the coffin of-

55:06.840 --> 55:08.840
Oh, is the coffin-

55:08.840 --> 55:11.840
Is the coffin the apartment?

55:12.840 --> 55:14.840
Is that the coffin?

55:19.840 --> 55:22.840
Yeah, being forever- forever un-

55:22.840 --> 55:25.840
Yeah, forever inseparable from your loving sister wife.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.840
It is hot.

55:27.840 --> 55:30.840
Oh, that makes sense.

55:30.840 --> 55:32.840
I don't know, I just got here.

55:32.840 --> 55:34.840
Okay, that makes sense.

55:34.840 --> 55:36.840
That makes sense, I think.

55:39.840 --> 55:41.840
Not romance, I said romantic.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.840
They're not the same thing.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.840
Romantic just means something is-

55:45.840 --> 55:47.840
The neighbor starts blasting his favorite ritual music

55:47.840 --> 55:49.840
for all to hear.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.840
Again, I wish he'd just-

55:55.840 --> 55:57.840
Did it work?

55:57.840 --> 55:59.840
You feel like you should check up on that.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.840
Hello, Sheevee, my adorable sister wife, hello.

56:09.840 --> 56:11.840
My mommy wife is here.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.840
My mommy wife is here.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.840
Um, okay, let's go check on the neighbor, I guess.

56:28.840 --> 56:30.840
Hultus, my lord, you've come.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.840
And you're a little smaller than I imagined.

56:35.840 --> 56:38.840
I- I love it, it's better than I imagined.

56:38.840 --> 56:40.840
That's all I meant.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.840
That's what she said.

56:42.840 --> 56:44.840
What do you offer, human?

56:44.840 --> 56:46.840
Oh, um, I don't have much to give right now.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.840
But if you help me get out of here,

56:48.840 --> 56:50.840
I can get you anything you wish.

56:52.840 --> 56:54.840
Is that no good?

56:54.840 --> 56:56.840
As you wish, human.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.840
My lord, thank you, thank you.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.840
Parish.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.840
What's bro cooking in there?

57:13.840 --> 57:15.840
I don't know, darkness clouds your vision

57:15.840 --> 57:17.840
and you can't see what's happening.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.840
But time your vision returns, the entity has vanished.

57:19.840 --> 57:21.840
Is he dead?

57:21.840 --> 57:23.840
On the ground lay the lifeless body of the Hultus.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.840
Let's go eat his dead body so that way we can-

57:25.840 --> 57:29.840
that way we can, you know, live a little longer ourselves.

57:29.840 --> 57:32.840
Am I already delirious or did you see that, too?

57:35.840 --> 57:37.840
Not J-

57:38.840 --> 57:40.840
I gotta be quiet when I say his name.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.840
Do we, uh, do you want to check up on him?

57:43.840 --> 57:48.840
Well, at the very least, I want to turn off that CD player.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.840
That's what you're concerned about.

57:50.840 --> 57:54.840
I'm not listening to this for the rest of my life, Andrew.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.840
You make it sound like we're gonna die anyways.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.840
Oh wait, any day now?

57:59.840 --> 58:01.840
Well, aren't we?

58:01.840 --> 58:02.840
Well, I'm not.

58:02.840 --> 58:04.840
That's gotta be something.

58:04.840 --> 58:06.840
This guy has-

58:06.840 --> 58:08.840
There's gotta be something this guy has that we can eat.

58:08.840 --> 58:11.840
Oh my god, I'm so fucking bad at reading.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.840
Ooh, Berkeley-

58:16.840 --> 58:18.840
Berkeley time.

58:18.840 --> 58:20.840
Shut up. Let's get in there.

58:20.840 --> 58:22.840
Let's get in there.

58:22.840 --> 58:24.840
The doorknob taunts you from the other side of the cloud.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.840
Break it. Break it.

58:26.840 --> 58:28.840
Break it.

58:28.840 --> 58:30.840
I need something to break it with.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.840
Oh.

58:32.840 --> 58:35.840
I need something to break it to see if there's any junk we can use to break in.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.840
Use the ashrite.

58:40.840 --> 58:42.840
Oh.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.840
Break it. Break the door.

58:44.840 --> 58:46.840
Door unlocked.

58:46.840 --> 58:48.840
Eat his dead body.

58:48.840 --> 58:50.840
That's a lot of meat, you think to yourself.

58:50.840 --> 58:52.840
What?

58:52.840 --> 58:54.840
A lot, apparently.

58:54.840 --> 58:56.840
Is it still illegal if we didn't kill the guy?

58:56.840 --> 58:58.840
Is what illegal?

58:58.840 --> 59:00.840
Well, you know.

59:00.840 --> 59:02.840
We can't eat him.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.840
Isn't that why you were insinuating?

59:04.840 --> 59:06.840
Nah, I was just making an observation.

59:08.840 --> 59:10.840
But we can't.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.840
If we do eat him, then that's it for us.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.840
There's no way we wouldn't get caught once they finally let us out.

59:14.840 --> 59:16.840
But it's not like we killed the guy.

59:20.840 --> 59:22.840
Yeah, that's gotta be at least 10,000 calories.

59:22.840 --> 59:24.840
It could last us a pretty good-

59:24.840 --> 59:26.840
pretty long amount of time.

59:26.840 --> 59:28.840
Let's eat his meat.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.840
Well, I think they should look past it.

59:30.840 --> 59:32.840
Given that there's nothing else to eat.

59:32.840 --> 59:34.840
Well, the staff here admit that they didn't give us food though.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.840
And before that, you're going to tell them-

59:36.840 --> 59:38.840
Are you gay?

59:38.840 --> 59:40.840
Why are you acting so gay?

59:40.840 --> 59:42.840
My old rat, Richard, Spanish is poorly from his cage made to bullying him.

59:42.840 --> 59:44.840
Can I get some sisterly emergency to boost his recovery?

59:44.840 --> 59:46.840
He's poorly?

59:46.840 --> 59:48.840
He's poorly?

59:48.840 --> 59:50.840
He's poorly.

59:50.840 --> 59:52.840
He's poorly.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.840
He's poorly.

59:54.840 --> 59:56.840
He's poorly?

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.840
Cut the bullies' balls off.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.840
If you have problems with your male rats bullying each other, cut their balls off.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.840
And then you'll be fine.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.840
Okay?

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840
That's my sisterly advice.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.840
And it's true.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.840
It works.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.840
Doctors don't want you to know this one life hack

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.840
to stop bullying in rats.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.840
Yeah, it works.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.840
There you go.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.840
I'm not talking from experience

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.840
because I've never owned male rats

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.840
because I don't like their balls.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.840
And I'm not going to pay

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.840
to get every single rat I owned

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.840
balls cut off.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.840
So that's why I stick to girls.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.840
Worked on my brother too.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.840
I should try it on you,

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.840
see if it works on you

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.840
to make you less aggressive.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.840
And before that, you're going to tell them

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.840
a demon killed him, really?

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.840
That'll fly?

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840
Listen, you're overthinking the hell out of this.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.840
Are we doing this or not?

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.840
Andrew, I'm expecting an answer.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.840
Wait, are they actually genuinely, like,

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.840
going to kill him?

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.840
Let me make that clear.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.840
I'm not a rat.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.840
You don't have to be a rat for me to cut your balls off.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.840
We're not aggressive.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.840
You can be.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.840
You haven't seen my marshmallows, but I have.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.840
Some of you are.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.840
Some of you need your balls cut off.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.840
Yeah.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.840
Alright then, let's find something to butcher him with.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.840
Oh god.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.840
Are we actually doing this right now?

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.840
It should be in the kitchen. There's a knife right there, isn't there?

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.840
Isn't this a knife?

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.840
A cleaver.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.840
The average human corpse

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.840
contains around

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.840
125,000 calories.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.840
That'll last us a good amount of time.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.840
She doesn't like the marrows it's in over.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.840
I love them. Don't even worry about it.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.840
I love them.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.840
I'm just jorkin'.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.840
So you get the arms, I'll handle the legs.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.840
Wait, we're actually doing it?

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.840
Are we actually doing it?

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Okay, I'll get the left one.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.840
What the fuck?

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.840
Wait, it's just the illusion of choice.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.840
It doesn't matter which arm we cut off first.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.840
We can't carry him out in the open like this.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.840
Just be quiet about it.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.840
No, can you go get plastic bags or something?

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.840
I'll take care of the rest in the meanwhile,

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.840
but I'm counting on you, Andy.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.840
Don't call me that.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.840
Hand him the cleaver.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.840
I guess we're going to get plastic bags

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.840
to put his dead body in.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.840
Yeah, dinner's served!

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.840
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.840
It's our neighbor,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.840
Chaky.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.840
I've been saying his name really loudly,

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840
but he could probably hear me.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.840
Well, I guess he's dead in the game, but yeah.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.840
Where's the bags?

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.840
Wait, where's the bags?

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.840
They were in the bathroom, right?

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.840
Girl dinner!

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.840
Girl dinner! Girl dinner!

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.840
It's time for girl dinner,

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.840
and I guess boy dinner since

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.840
Andy's here too.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.840
Here you go.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.840
Oh, you got his legs. Good job.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.840
Oh, fuck.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.840
Oh, my God.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.840
This is so fucked up.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.840
A small problem presents itself.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.840
The plastic bags aren't big enough

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.840
to fit the whole torso.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.840
Time to cut his head off, too.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840
Ahem.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840
This is actually

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840
my first time cutting up a dead body,

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840
believe it or not, yep.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.840
I don't think we can cut through the spine.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.840
Just fold him over.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.840
I don't think that's going to work.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.840
Watch and learn!

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840
You see? Oh, this is so fucked up.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.840
You see?

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.840
If anyone happens to be looking out

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.840
their window, it'll be a disaster.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.840
Maybe if I use two bags?

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.840
Listen, this isn't going to...

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.840
Ta-da!

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.840
Good God, no.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.840
Don't make me laugh at this.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.840
I don't have the power to make you do anything, Andrew.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.840
All right, all right, enough.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.840
Gather the limbs up and go.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.840
There should be plenty room

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.840
for them in our freezer.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.840
I'll stuff the torso

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.840
and head in his freezer for now.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.840
Big brain.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840
I know such cute sibling bonds.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.840
Oh my God.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.840
What a cute little date for them.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.840
I'll go cook...

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.840
I'll go cook us something while you're at it.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.840
Yeah, you'll cook quite the something.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.840
Okay.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.840
First time cutting up a dead body,

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.840
so the others were alive.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.840
Yep, the others were alive while I cut them up

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.840
and they screamed very loudly.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.840
How do I cook?

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.840
How do I cook?

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.840
Let me cook.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.840
What's that noise? Is he still cutting him up?

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.840
Can I turn chewing?

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.840
You like the sound of that?

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.840
How am I supposed to...

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.840
Am I supposed to cook him in his own house?

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.840
That's kind of disrespectful, isn't it?

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.840
To the dead?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.840
To cut him up

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.840
and then cook him in his own house?

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.840
Oh, am I supposed to put him in the freezer?

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.840
Pass me the candy? You want it?

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.840
Open your mouth, I'll give it to you.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.840
Ready?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.840
I'll pass it from my mouth to yours.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.840
Should I put him in the freezer?

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.840
Oh, there we go.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.840
Which one do I want to eat?

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.840
Okay, here you go.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.840
Make sure you suck on it really well, okay?

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.840
Go for the leg?

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840
Left leg.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840
Okay, leg, leg, leg.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840
Okay.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.840
All right, time to cook.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.840
What are we going to make?

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.840
You fry some meat.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.840
Dinner is ready.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840
Right, so what are we having here?

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.840
Pure deliciousness is what.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.840
Eat up.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.840
You first. Munch, munch.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.840
Huh? What?

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.840
Oh, you already... okay.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.840
Eat, Andrew. You will not waste this.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.840
Um, right.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.840
Andrew takes a bite of your cookie.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.840
I don't think he likes it.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.840
He begins retching.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.840
Oh my god, she's just like me.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.840
She can't cook.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.840
No kiss to pass it?

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.840
I already passed it to you.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.840
Maybe if I eat another one, I'll give you a kiss to pass it on.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.840
Thigh is the best part?

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.840
That's true. But this is a man.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.840
I like girls thighs more.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.840
Yeah, do what your sister says.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.840
Man, these fucking pictures.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840
Oh my god.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840
Swallow.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.840
All of it.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840
Gold.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.840
Why is there so much sexual tension right now?

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.840
Mm-mm, delicious.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.840
Not the first time she said that to him.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.840
Well, how is it?

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840
It's...

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.840
God, I hate picky eaters.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.840
Aw, fuck, I'm a picky eater.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.840
I made this with love.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.840
So you're not leaving the table before you lick the plate clean.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.840
Quit your nagging woman.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.840
Or just like a couple.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.840
Then quit your gagging, you big baby.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.840
Now call him a good boy?

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840
Good boy.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840
I'll eat it, alright? Just give me a minute.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, eat it.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.840
Under your watchful eye, he slowly finishes his plate.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.840
Good boy, I am so proud.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.840
Just fuck off, Ashley.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.840
What an odd way to say thank you.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.840
Yeah, yeah, thanks a bunch.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.840
I'll clear the table, so leave me alone.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.840
God, he's so emo.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.840
We've got a very limited set of spaces left.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.840
So what do you think I should try next?

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.840
Like, I don't know, maybe coriander?

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.840
Oh my God, I have such a funny story for that!

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.840
Okay, wait, actually pause. I want to tell you a funny story.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.840
Let me tell you this story.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.840
Okay, no, I want to be up close.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.840
I want to be up close and personal for this.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.840
Let me make my model go in front of chat.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.840
Okay, so when I was in high school,

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.840
I went to a sleepover with my friends.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.840
And we did that one.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.840
My friend had one of those microphones

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:03.840
with the headphones plugged into them,

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840
and it's supposed to be that challenge

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.840
where you're supposed to say a paragraph,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.840
and you can hear yourself talking, but it's delayed.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.840
So the challenge is like, you know,

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.840
boop, you booping me?

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.840
What are you booping me for?

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.840
But the challenge is basically talk clearly, and that's it.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.840
You just, whenever you hear the other person talk with it,

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.840
it's just funny, that's all.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840
Boop my snoop.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.840
Boop me.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.840
I'm ready for the boop.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840
Okay, um, anyways.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.840
So we were taking turns to, you know,

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.840
do the challenge of like speaking clearly with a delayed,

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.840
what's it called, a delayed audio of our voices.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.840
I know I'm explaining it badly,

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.840
but basically when it was my turn,

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.840
I decided to do a copy pasta.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.840
I decided to say a copy pasta.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.840
And the copy pasta was the one of the guy

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.840
who was pretending to sell weed to his school,

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.840
like to his classmates at school,

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.840
but in reality he was just selling them oregano.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.840
And I had never seen the word oregano before.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.840
So when it was my turn to read my copy pasta,

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.840
I said oregano the entire time,

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.840
and I just pronounced it oregano.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.840
The whole time they didn't know I was selling them oregano.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.840
Oh sorry, I turned off the desktop audio

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840
so you could hear me talk.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.840
Thank you for the tip discomancer.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.840
Oregano.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.840
And now I still have the video of me,

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.840
of me, because they recorded me

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.840
and I still have the video of me just saying

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.840
and I was selling them,

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.840
I was packaging oregano

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.840
and selling it to my classmates.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.840
Do you want me to post a copy pasta for you to read?

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.840
Surely it won't be something bad.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.840
If it's not something bad, go ahead.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.840
How do you say munic?

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840
Munich?

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840
Munich?

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.840
I don't know.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840
That's the British...

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.840
Wait, oregano is actually pronounced oregano

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.840
in British terms?

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840
Are you gay?

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.840
Why are you acting so gay?

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840
Oregano.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.840
Yeah, I know it's oregano.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.840
But now I sometimes just say oregano

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840
to make people mad because I think it's funny.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.840
She says it like,

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.840
how are you supposed to say it?

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840
Leak the audio.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.840
Yeah, no.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.840
No.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.840
Anyways, coriander?

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.840
Alright, I'll try some of that tomorrow.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.840
I'm off to bed now, goodnight.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.840
Night night.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.840
Okay.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.840
Where's the bedroom?

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.840
What is that sound alert?

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840
It's just my sound alert.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.840
What do you mean?

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.840
It's my sound alert.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840
How do I sleep?

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840
Is this not my...

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840
Oh, these are the parents' bedroom.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.840
Oh, sorry, that's the parents' bedroom.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840
You were correct, just British.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840
Wow, that's crazy.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.840
I was British all along

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.840
and I didn't even know it.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.840
Said she likes you.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.840
Who?

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.840
My friend from school.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.840
Or at least I thought she was a friend.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840
So are you gonna...

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840
Are you gonna be her boyfriend?

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840
Gross?

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.840
No.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.840
I should teach her a lesson.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.840
Oh my god.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.840
You're my brother, mine.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.840
I'll make her think twice

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.840
before stealing from another woman.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.840
Oh my god.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.840
Oh yeah, you're a girl too.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.840
What's that supposed to mean?

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.840
Somehow you don't count as a lady in my mind.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.840
Or as a person for that matter.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.840
Screw you.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.840
I am the most personous lady in the world.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:32.840
So anyways,

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.840
I'm gonna take her to that old warehouse

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.840
and lock her in one of the crates.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.840
Seriously.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.840
Mom gave me some money

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840
to go buy groceries.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.840
Are you coming with?

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.840
Focus, Andy.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.840
Let's leave her sitting there all night.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.840
That'll show her.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.840
Let's not.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840
You should go ask her to hang out.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840
She won't say no then.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.840
Lately, I don't want to.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.840
Just go over and ask her to come with you.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.840
I feel like you almost said this exactly.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.840
I've never said that before.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.840
But I'm saying it now.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.840
Take her to the warehouse

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.840
and we'll see what happens.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:21.840
Come on.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.840
Mom said you'd help me with anything.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.840
I thought she's your friend.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.840
Well, I thought so too.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:33.840
And she can be my friend again afterwards.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.840
She just needs a reminder

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.840
of how to do it properly.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.840
Well, get in trouble.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.840
I'll only let her out

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840
when she promises not to tell on us.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.840
She's been getting tips from Mercy.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.840
I'll let you in on a little secret,

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.840
but I don't need tips from Mercy.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.840
It's all coming from me.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.840
Sai.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.840
Do it, Andy.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840
I guess.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.840
Hooray! You're the best!

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.840
Today's episode is titled

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.840
Andy and Lately and the Bitch in a Box.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.840
One day, you'll be in a bitch in a box

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.840
and your friends will take turns

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.840
pissing on the ground above.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.840
Oh my god, what the fuck?

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.840
What do I do about these hussies around you?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.840
Where do you learn these words?

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.840
The bitch is you.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.840
I'll take you out to play

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.840
and then when I'm done,

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.840
it's back into the box with you.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.840
I really ought to kick your ass

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840
one of these days.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.840
Huh?

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.840
Yeah, who do you think taught Mercy?

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.840
What?

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.840
What is taking him?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840
What is taking him?

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.840
What?

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.840
He wouldn't have forgotten our plans, would he?

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840
Grr.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:16:59.840
Is he coming?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:00.840
Finally!

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.840
Huh?

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.840
What are you doing here?

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.840
Surprise!

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.840
I want to hang out too.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.840
Oh.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.840
I mean, I guess that's fine.

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.840
Say, did you tell your mommy you're here?

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.840
No, why?

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.840
Just wondering.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840
I mean, I'm surprised she let you come

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.840
hang out with a boy.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.840
No way, she thinks I went to study with Julia.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.840
But why are you here, Ashley?

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.840
Divine intervention.

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.840
What's that even mean?

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.840
It means she's full of crap, don't listen.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.840
So, are we going inside or what?

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.840
Is that allowed?

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.840
These flags be crimson?

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.840
Ignore them.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.840
Just put on some rose-tinted glasses, okay?

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.840
They're not real.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.840
You're being a little crazy right now.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840
I love it.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.840
Let's find a way in right now.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.840
Where are we going in a box?

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.840
Box?

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.840
Get in the box?

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:13.840
Get in the box, bitch.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.840
Get in the box.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.840
Wait, I'm confused.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.840
Oh, shit.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.840
Are we actually going to nail her into a box?

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.840
The drop off on the other side of the window is too high.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840
Though I wouldn't mind convincing Blanc-

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.840
Blanc- Blanc.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.840
Let me take another cough drop.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.840
Yeah, luckily you're colorblind.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:43.840
Did you know it's more common for dudes to be colorblind?

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.840
Isn't that so lucky for me?

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.840
We're just Lillie, Leigh, Ann, and Amy Beacons.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.840
We are one.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.840
There is no ending in beginning to us because we are one and the same.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.840
I wouldn't mind convincing Blanc to jump anyways.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.840
To maybe twist her ankle.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.840
Maybe break her neck.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.840
Is something wrong?

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.840
Nah, but we can't go in this way.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.840
Why did they nail this metal sheet thing on the wall?

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.840
Are you gay?

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.840
Why are you acting so gay?

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.840
They're not red flags.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.840
They're fun facts.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840
They're just fun facts.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.840
50 fun facts you didn't know about, Amy,

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.840
but you're about to learn right now in this stream.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.840
What's Ouroboros?

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.840
Is that, that sounds familiar.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.840
What's Ouroboros?

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.840
Ouroboros?

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.840
Looks like there's a hole behind it.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.840
Perfect.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.840
Tear it open.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.840
What?

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.840
I can't do that.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.840
It's okay.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840
I won't tell anyone.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.840
As in, I literally can't do it dumbass.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.840
Not without some tools at least.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.840
Huh.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.840
Even though it's this flimsy?

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.840
Yes.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.840
Bro, what a weak little bitch boy.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.840
I like smart guys over beefy ones.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.840
Shut up, bitch!

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.840
That's my man!

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.840
Who asked?

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.840
Wait, so we need more tools?

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.840
What about this thing?

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.840
A steel mallet.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.840
I can't really think of a way a mallet

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.840
would be useful to us in this situation.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.840
I sure can.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.840
Ouroborialis?

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.840
Is that what Ouroboros means?

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:50.840
Oh, snake eating its own tail.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.840
That's what it means?

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.840
Mmm.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:20:59.840
Mmm, mmm.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.840
Yes, yes.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.840
Yes, the Ouroboros of Emi and Lele.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.840
Yeah, that's what we are.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.840
Does it help us get in the warehouse?

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.840
Oh my god.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.840
Wait, I have to fart.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.840
Hold on, hold on, I have to fart.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.840
Fuck.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.840
God damn it.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.840
It's not coming out.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.840
My butthole got shy.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.840
Damn it.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.840
I literally stood up from my chair

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840
and turned around so I could face them like

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.840
and then I didn't want to come out.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.840
God damn it.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.840
I'm sorry, boys.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.840
Next time, we'll get them next time.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.840
Right in my face, do it.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.840
I tried, I wouldn't come out.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.840
I can't even, I can't even do it.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.840
I can't even do it.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.840
It got shy, I'm sorry.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.840
Okay, let's continue.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.840
Okay.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.840
Why is my chat frozen on my phone?

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.840
Am I going to be the first farter?

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.840
I was not, I was not the first farter.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840
Okay, here we go.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.840
Oh, Lay Lay, I don't even want to know

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.840
what you had in mind.

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.840
What are you guys talking about?

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.840
It's nothing.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.840
Let's keep looking.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.840
The thing.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.840
You use the back of the hammer to pull out the nails.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.840
Cough, wow, it sure is cough cough kind of dusty in here.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.840
First a fart first to win, what are we winning?

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.840
There needs to be a prize.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.840
You gotta, you gotta kind of, you know.

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.840
I can't think of the word.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.840
I'm trying to think of the word I want.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.840
A kiss is a prize?

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.840
Okay, okay, I can compete for a kiss.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.840
The sharp ender.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.840
Makes me wonder about my, oh, makes me worry about my asthma.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
It's fine, it's fine.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.840
Oh, I know, how about some hide and seek?

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840
Ugh, you're such a kid.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.840
Huh?

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.840
Annie wants to play too.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840
You do?

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840
What?

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.840
Oh yeah, sure.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840
See?

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.840
Well, I mean, it's fun every once in a while.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.840
Oh my god, I hate her.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:52.840
You totally want to, you totally wanted to play too, you child.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.840
Albeit, I'm gonna count to ten.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840
Hundred, count to a hundred at least.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.840
Okay.

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.840
One, two, alright, let's find a good box to shove in.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.840
Don't tell her where that kiss is gonna be.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840
What?

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.840
You wouldn't kiss anywhere weird, right?

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.840
It's gonna be on the mouth, of course.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.840
Okay.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.840
You still want to do that?

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.840
Of course.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.840
She said no one knows she's here.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.840
It's perfect.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.840
Lele, you promised.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.840
Now hurry up, before she's done counting.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.840
Where is she?

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.840
Where's the box?

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840
Where is she?

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.840
How do I shove her in the box?

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.840
Put her in the box.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840
This container's already full.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.840
There's no empty boxes.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.840
Where do I put her?

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.840
There's no empty boxes.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.840
Ah.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.840
Oh, now this'll do.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.840
There isn't any lock on it, though.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.840
Well, we don't have it.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840
We don't actually have...

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.840
Ah!

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.840
Well, we don't actually want to lock her in.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.840
You get forehead kisses at best?

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840
Why?

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.840
Why?

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840
Why?

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.840
Dummy kisses work too.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.840
Yeah, on the lips.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.840
I won't accept anything less than on the lips.

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.840
We don't have...

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.840
We don't...

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.840
Fuck, I can't fucking read.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.840
We don't actually want to lock her in.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.840
The hell we don't...

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.840
Place a stick or something between the rings.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.840
That'll keep it closed.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.840
Won't the stick just break?

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.840
No, well, if she's hunched inside,

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.840
I doubt she'd have leverage to...

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.840
Ready or not, here I come!

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.840
Oh, crap, she counts too fast.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.840
It wasn't that fast, really.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:57.840
Ahaha, let's hide.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.840
Okay.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840
Wait, where do I hide?

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.840
Where do I hide?

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840
In the box, right?

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.840
Fuck.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840
Where do I hide?

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.840
Here?

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.840
Tell me where to hide!

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.840
Ah!

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.840
Oh wait, I thought I saw her walk in.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840
Where do I hide?

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840
Where do I hide?

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840
Where do I hide?

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840
Top right.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.840
Here?

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840
Where do we get a stick anyways?

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.840
Andy picks up whatever wooden debris is at his feet.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.840
I guess this'll do.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.840
Well...

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840
What do you think?

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840
Is she pretty?

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.840
A stick?

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840
No, who do you think, dumbass?

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.840
Ah, she's fine, I guess.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.840
He's supposed to say no.

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.840
Found you!

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.840
Both of you.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.840
Who hides in the same spot, idiots?

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:11.840
SHUT UP, BITCH!

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.840
It was my spot first.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.840
Then you're it.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.840
Far through the crack in the box?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.840
Yeah, I'm prettier.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.840
Yes, yes, I'll go count.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.840
Andy goes to count outside.

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.840
My hiding spots are the best.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.840
I know a really good one.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840
Come take a look!

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840
Um, okay.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.840
Let's shove her in this fuckin' box.

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.840
Go hide in there.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.840
I think you'll fit in here?

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.840
Seems like a bad idea.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.840
It's coming, it's coming!

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.840
It was a silent fart, damn it.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:56.840
Okay.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.840
Seems like a bad idea.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:58.840
Have so!

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.840
I'm gonna get my clothes dirty.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.840
My mom does...

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.840
Oh wait, what?

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.840
I didn't see the previous message.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.840
She'll get mad if I...

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:07.840
HUNDRED!

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.840
Oh shoot, he's coming, hurry, hurry!

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.840
I'm getting a phone call right now.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840
Decline.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.840
Leave me alone.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:18.840
Let me sniff.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.840
There is nothing to sniff.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.840
It doesn't even smell.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.840
I don't smell anything.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.840
First confirmed fart on stream?

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840
If you believe me, yeah.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:31.840
Shut up about vibrations!

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.840
It's not the kind of vibrations you think it is!

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.840
It's not the kind of vibrations you think it is!

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.840
It was my phone!

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.840
No, I'm not gonna answer it.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.840
It said it was a survey.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.840
Er, uh, okay.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.840
Hey silly, your friend hops inside the crate.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:54.840
Yup!

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:55.840
Huh? What was that?

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:57.840
I got you now!

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.840
Blank is too weak to throw you off the lid.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.840
Cough, this isn't funny, Ashley.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.840
She's gonna suffocate, isn't she?

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.840
Hello, Amy, hello.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:15.840
She's gonna suffocate.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.840
That magic wand of yours?

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.840
I haven't used that yet.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.840
I will update you when I do use it though.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.840
I will.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.840
But no, it was just my phone.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.840
Get your mind out of the gutter.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.840
There you are, Andy, you slowpoke.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.840
Hurry up, she's putting up a fight.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:33.840
Cough, I can't breathe!

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.840
She's actually gonna suffocate!

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:37.840
She alright?

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.840
Cough, Cough, please, I-

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.840
Shut up already, you drama queen.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.840
Let her out, Lele.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:44.840
She's just pretending.

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.840
No one's ever died from some dust.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840
Just let her out.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.840
What? You believe her over me?

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.840
It's not really about whether I believe her or not.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:29:59.840
Fine, you let her out then.

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.840
Who cares about me anyways?

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.840
Cough, Cough.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:05.840
Everyone likes her better,

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.840
but you like her better too.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:08.840
But everyone does.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.840
I already know.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.840
Cough, Cough, Cough.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.840
That's fiction, that's fiction.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.840
That's f-

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.840
That's f-

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.840
A-

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.840
X-

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840
A-

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.840
Asphyxiation, siblings, confinement, betrayal.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.840
Nice tags.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.840
I bet you-

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.840
I bet you'd rather have a girlfriend

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.840
than spend time with me, of course you would.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.840
Oh, come on, I already told you I don't want.

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.840
And,

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:41.840
bet,

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.840
sniff,

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.840
I should say it.

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840
I should voice act for hairlines, at least.

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.840
And I bet,

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.840
but you only want to hang out with me

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.840
because mom told you to.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.840
Well, that's-

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:54.840
I mean, maybe she did, but-

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:57.840
It's not fair.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.840
Cough, Cough, Cough.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.840
Why does everyone like her better?

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.840
I'm loud and weird and annoying,

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.840
no one likes me at all.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840
I like you better, Lele.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.840
Prove it,

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.840
liar.

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.840
Sigh.

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.840
I knew it.

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:15.840
I knew it.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.840
Maybe you'd have more friends if you weren't always so-

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.840
Not even my own brother picks me over her!

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.840
I knew it already.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:25.840
Did I not just say,

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.840
la, la, la,

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.840
talk sure is cheap.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.840
God damn it.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:32.840
Cough, Cough.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.840
Crazy ass castling.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:37.840
I mean, she's good at it,

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:38.840
she's good at what she does.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840
Cough, Cough.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840
Cough, Cough.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.840
Cough, Cough.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:45.840
Ash.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840
There.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.840
Are you happy now?

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.840
Cough, Cough.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.840
Yes.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.840
Just until morning, okay?

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.840
Yes, yes, you're the best.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.840
I like you the best, Andy.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:02.840
You hear that, Blank?

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.840
You get to stay there until morning.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:06.840
No, please.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:07.840
Cough, Cough.

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:08.840
Ashley.

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.840
Yeah, that girl's gonna fucking die.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:14.840
I mean, she kind of deserves it,

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:15.840
she was annoying.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.840
Ashley, wait, don't-

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840
Cough, Cough.

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.840
Go.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:19.840
Ashley, please.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.840
Ashley!

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.840
Ashley?

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:23.840
Will you wait?

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:25.840
I am now.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.840
If you see my tongue sticking out,

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.840
it's because I'm kind of sticking out my tongue.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.840
Cough, Cough.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:40.840
Maybe she shouldn't have tried to seduce her big brother.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.840
Well, maybe that bitch shouldn't have been such a bitch,

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.840
and then she wouldn't die.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:45.840
Um, okay.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.840
What is it?

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:47.840
Nothing, it's just-

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.840
God, what the fuck did we do?

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:50.840
You still on about dinner?

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:51.840
Fine, just starve then.

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:52.840
More for me.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:53.840
How are you like this?

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.840
How are you-

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.840
Are you out of your mind?

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.840
Listen, I didn't kill the guy,

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.840
so I didn't do anything wrong.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.840
You mutil-

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.840
You mutil-

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:03.840
You mutil-

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.840
You mutil-

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.840
You mutilated and ate a corpse, too!

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.840
What else were we supposed to do?

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.840
Call the warden and let him know he died?

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.840
Ashley is giving more of a sociopath than a psychopath?

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:28.840
She's a- what's it called?

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.840
S-

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.840
She's a psychosis.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.840
That's what she's-

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840
That's what she is.

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.840
Uh, yes.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:40.840
Um, sir, we-

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.840
He summoned a demon and then died.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.840
I swear we didn't do it.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.840
Yeah.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.840
I-

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:46.840
We wouldn't have had to admit we were there.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.840
We couldn't-

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.840
We could've just told him to go check on that guy.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.840
Andrew, what the hell?

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:53.840
What?

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.840
What the hell?

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:55.840
Didn't we both agree on this?

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.840
I could've sworn it was your suggestion in the first place.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:00.840
She's so good at cast lighting!

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.840
Yeah, what a girl, boss.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.840
I was hungry-

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.840
I was too hungry to think straight, okay?

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.840
Now that's some bullshit.

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.840
Fine, let's assume it was so.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840
What-

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840
What do you want me to do about it?

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840
I-

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.840
Woosh woosh, there goes my magic wand.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.840
There.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:23.840
I've absolved you of your sins.

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.840
You never took a bite now.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:29.840
You're welcome.

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:31.840
Oh gee, thanks.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.840
We'll see how-

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.840
We'll see how that holds in.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.840
I'm sorry that I'm so dyslexic today.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.840
I don't actually have dyslexia, surprisingly.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:45.840
We'll see how that holds in the face of the law.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840
Listen, who cares?

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840
Ugh!

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.840
Isn't this, like, some extreme circumstances stuff?

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.840
Like, can we be excused?

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.840
It's the water company's fault.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.840
First they lock us in for months, and then we don't-

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.840
And then they won't even feed us.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.840
And does Kevin fever a real thing?

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.840
Maybe we can plead insanity.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840
I don't know, Ashley.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:11.840
Sounded out?

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.840
Thank you for being so patient.

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.840
She's an empath.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:23.840
They're there.

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:25.840
You know what?

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.840
I couldn't get his head off.

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:29.840
Huh?

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.840
Like, he didn't fit in the freezer properly.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.840
So I needed to chop his head off, but I couldn't cut it.

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.840
His spine was too-

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840
Anyway, I kind of just-

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.840
Uh, like, kept cutting around and then pulled it off.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840
Like some plant.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.840
I don't know.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.840
I just keep thinking about it.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.840
Ugh, I can't fucking sleep, Ashley.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:51.840
It's-

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:53.840
Come here.

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:57.840
This is a little-

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.840
Oh my, they're sleeping in the same bed together?

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.840
Aw, thank you for all the encouragement.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.840
I don't know what's wrong with you.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.840
How are you so unbothered?

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:19.840
Moisturized, showered, um, cleansed, unbothered.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.840
Sitting on my couch.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.840
Reading incest.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.840
I don't know, I compartmentalize.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.840
Kind of like we compartmentalize that guy into different freezers.

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:32.840
Ashley!

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.840
Andrew, what is it, Andrew?

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.840
Oh my god!

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.840
Andrew!

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:42.840
Andrew.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:43.840
Andy.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.840
I-

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.840
I told you to stop calling me that.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.840
We're not kids anymore.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.840
Then why are you crying like such a baby?

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.840
Now kiss.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:00.840
She's a woman, Andy. Consequences are ununtered.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:07.840
I'm not crying.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.840
Mommy, the big bad me did the evil thing.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.840
You shut your own mouth.

01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:17.840
Make me a little-

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.840
I was gonna say make me without actually reading it.

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.840
Make me a little bitch.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.840
Forget this.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.840
Why are they sort of goals though?

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.840
I know!

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.840
Hey Andy, remember when we used to go on adventures?

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:33.840
What?

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.840
Andy and Lay Lay's quest for something or another.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.840
Something or another, remember?

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.840
Yeah, they have a second bed and they don't use it.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.840
You're already in character.

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.840
I'm basically covering up her entire side, so, you know.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.840
Just pretend I'm her.

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.840
Isn't this just another one of those?

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:04.840
I don't know.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.840
Can you just play along for now?

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.840
Until we're out of this crappy situation, then we can unpack it all later?

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.840
Yeah, we'll go to therapy after this, don't worry.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:13.840
Or not.

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.840
I don't think I will personally, but you can go to therapy.

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:21.840
Like, I could tell a therapist what I've been up to-

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.840
Oh, like I could tell a therapist what I've been up to.

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:26.840
Alright, just a thought.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.840
Let's get out of here.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.840
Oh, let's just get out of here.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.840
He literally has screaming night terrors, does he?

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.840
Um, like we should have done months ago.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.840
Now that we've got food, don't you want to keep waiting until they let us out?

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.840
Hell no, I don't.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.840
They'll throw us in jail right after.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.840
And I don't know which is worse.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.840
Withering in this coffin of a house or getting railed in a prison?

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.840
Don't worry, Andy.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.840
I'll be the one railing you in prison.

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.840
I see.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:14.840
You want to escape not only this quarantine, but the consequences of her actions as well.

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.840
Preferably, yeah.

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.840
This episode is titled Andy and Laylee and the Escape from the Coffin.

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:23.840
Yeah, whatever.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:25.840
I'm going to sleep now.

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.840
Promise.

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.840
I promise I'll be the one railing you in jail.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.840
Bend over.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:33.840
Drop the soap, okay?

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.840
Now with my two inch.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.840
More than a two inch.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:42.840
I'll try again.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:44.840
I love you, Andy.

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.840
Shut that Andy junk up your ass already.

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:49.840
My God.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.840
I don't love you that much.

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:54.840
You make me want to kill myself?

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:56.840
Too bad dividing.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.840
Oh, too bad diving down the balcony is just too romantic for you.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.840
A pillow hits you in the face so hard you see stars.

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840
Two stars.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.840
Your body has absorbed some delicious nutrients and you're feeling mighty better today.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.840
Andy, where are you?

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:23.840
Dividing.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.840
Shut up.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:25.840
I'm bad at reading.

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.840
Where is this dude?

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.840
He's gone.

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.840
Is he on the balcony?

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:35.840
Wait, what?

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.840
What do you think of their relationship so far?

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.840
Goals.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:42.840
Adorable.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.840
Of course.

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.840
The freezer is full of delicious meat.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:55.840
Yum, yum, yum.

01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:57.840
Oh, is he in the neighbors?

01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.840
Oh, okay.

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:00.840
Hello.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.840
Hey there.

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:03.840
Good morning.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.840
Whatcha up to?

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.840
I'm looking at this demon summoning instruction manual book thing.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:15.840
Brave, given things turned out so well for that cultist guy.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.840
It's okay, I can do it.

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.840
I'll help you.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840
I'll help you.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.840
Debatable.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.840
I mean, he was successful up to the point he lacked an offering.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840
Oh.

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:27.840
Anyways, it says here that demons don't think much of humans.

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840
Well, that's good.

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.840
We'll have something in common then.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:31.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.840
So they're only willing to do business as long as it's quick and easy for them.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.840
I take it.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.840
Wait, actually, hold on.

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:45.840
I should say, I don't.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.840
I actually want to do a witchcraft.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:57.840
I actually want to do a witchcraft stream and I want to make potion bottles for you guys

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:00.840
and I want to send them to you, but I don't know if I'll be allowed to.

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:06.840
I think I have to ask, but I really want to do a witchcraft stream where I make little,

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:10.840
like little, not potion, little spell bottles for you.

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.840
I think that would be so cute.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.840
And you can tell me what you want me to put in it and I'll put what you want.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:18.840
And maybe I can even put, I can even write a little handwritten message in there.

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.840
That would be so cute and I want to send it to you, but I don't know.

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.840
I'll have to ask, I'll have to ask if I can send it to you.

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:29.840
I'm not putting my eminate in it.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:33.840
It will be completely sane items, okay?

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.840
There's not going to be any spit in the bottles.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.840
There's not going to be any piss in the bottles.

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.840
There's not going to be any shit in the bottles.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.840
You don't have to buy it.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.840
I'll probably like, I don't know.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.840
I don't want to put it behind a paywall.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.840
Maybe I'll make like a, some kind of pool, choose someone random, you know?

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.840
There won't be bathwater, no.

01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840
Maybe accidentally sending demons to people's homes.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.840
It won't, it won't be demons.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.840
It won't be demons.

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.840
No, there won't be any hair in there either.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:08.840
I'm not putting any of my personal parts in, in those, in those bottles.

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.840
Well, I wouldn't want to get out of here the same way the cultists did,

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.840
but I do think this is our best bet for now.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.840
So what will we ask from it?

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.840
I don't know.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.840
Okay, then what will we bargain with?

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.840
I don't know that either.

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.840
Nice.

01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:31.840
I just barely woke up.

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.840
Give me a minute.

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:35.840
It says here demons prefer human soul, so obviously it's just got to be that.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.840
Where do you get a soul while stuck in here?

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.840
What are you looking at?

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.840
Nothing.

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.840
Actually, what?

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.840
I wouldn't thought about it, I see.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.840
Let me keep my thoughts to myself.

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.840
Didn't we already share enough?

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.840
On second thought, let's not do this.

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.840
Oh, come on, I'm not going to sacrifice you.

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.840
We'll figure something out.

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:00.840
Let's just set this ritual up for now.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:01.840
Nine out of ten?

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.840
Thank you, Sheebie.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.840
Will you burp into the bottle?

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:08.840
Okay, fine, fine.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.840
If you want me to burp into the bottle, I'll burp into it.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.840
The Gamer Girl bathwater was canceled.

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.840
Not because it was horrible, but because it was a biohazard.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.840
Bill almost got fired for that.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.840
Okay, but did we really expect it to be Gamer Girl bathwater?

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.840
It's obviously just like perfumed water.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.840
It's not actual bathwater.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.840
Also, if you hear creaking, it's my chair.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:32.840
I'm not farting.

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:33.840
Okay?

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.840
I'm not done reading this yet,

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:44.840
but you can start by replacing the candles for now.

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:45.840
Okay.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.840
Oh, fuck.

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.840
What?

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.840
Replacing the candles.

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:54.840
Put them up.

01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.840
Replace them.

01:44:58.840 --> 01:44:59.840
Okay.

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.840
No, I'm not sending lemonade in a bottle.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:16.840
Oh my God.

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:19.840
Shut up.

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.840
I'd obviously make you pay for lemonade.

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:23.840
That wouldn't be free.

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:26.840
Okay, there you go.

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:27.840
I set up the candles.

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.840
Done with now.

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:29.840
Now we...

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.840
Still alive and kicking, are you?

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:34.840
Uh-oh.

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:37.840
You've been quiet lately, pal.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.840
I'm getting a little worried here.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.840
Si.

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.840
Yeah, hi, hello.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.840
One of my guys isn't answering.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.840
Oh, fuck.

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:49.840
Oh, fuck.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:50.840
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.840
The weirdo one.

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.840
You think he croaked me?

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:56.840
But he's just a type B anyways.

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:57.840
What?

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.840
How much?

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.840
Oh, you.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:09.840
Oh, you.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:10.840
Oh, you.

01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:14.840
Type B, what does that mean?

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:16.840
Fine.

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.840
I'll check it after my round.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.840
Is that all we would have had to do to get the door open?

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.840
Just shut up for two days?

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.840
Shit, he's gonna come in and see all this?

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.840
No, no, no, no, no, enough.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.840
Go stall him at our door.

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:31.840
I'll clean this up.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:36.840
He's still gonna find the guy missing unless he checks the freezer,

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.840
which is where all this blood is pointing at.

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:41.840
No.

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.840
Go before he notices we're not home and keep him until I've mopped up all the blood.

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.840
Why, why are you guys blood type B type B blood type B?

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:58.840
Are they like collecting these people for their blood or something?

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.840
What do you mean type B?

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.840
There should be a corpse below then.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:08.840
You, you get to be that...

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.840
I fucking can't read.

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:13.840
You get to be that corpse if you don't get going already.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:15.840
I have to clean up the blood.

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:16.840
Clean it up, clean it up.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.840
Oh fuck, get them up.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840
Okay, get them up, get them up.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.840
You'll see.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:23.840
What's your blood type?

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.840
That's a really good question actually.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:25.840
I don't know.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.840
Every time I've ever gone to donate blood,

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:32.840
that's not where the mop is.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.840
I used, I went a couple times to donate blood and they said that they would send me a card,

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:41.840
like a donor card that would say my blood type on it,

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.840
but they never ended up doing that.

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.840
So I don't know if they just never use my blood,

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.840
but I actually don't know my blood type.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:56.840
Mine is O plus.

01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:58.840
That's cool.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.840
Ashley, the warden is coming.

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.840
What do I do?

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:05.840
Get out, get out of here.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:07.840
What are you doing here?

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:08.840
Oh shoot.

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.840
Silly, the warden soon calls over his buddy.

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.840
You get taken back to your apartment after which you and your brother,

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.840
you and your brother's wicked deeds are soon discovered.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.840
You donate blood, good girl.

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.840
I only did it like twice or three times maybe,

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.840
but it worries me that they never gave me a donor card because I even asked.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.840
I said, Hey, why didn't I get a card?

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:30.840
And they were like, Oh, we'll send you one Dory.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.840
So now it makes me feel like I have some sort of disease and they never use my blood because of that.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:36.840
Because you know, they test the blood that they,

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.840
they test the blood that they collect from you.

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:43.840
So I'm now I'm scared I have some sort of fucking disease and they never just,

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:45.840
they just never told me.

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.840
And that's why I didn't get a card because they never use my blood.

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.840
Andrew, start pole dancing.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.840
Distract the guards.

01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.840
Guess what?

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.840
It went so badly for you that I'm going to let you try again.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.840
No.

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:06.840
Wait, what did I do wrong?

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.840
Is that supposed to happen?

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.840
But I didn't do anything.

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.840
Oh, I have to hide in the closet?

01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:27.840
I don't know.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.840
I just got here.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.840
Okay.

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:31.840
I'll hide in the closet.

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:36.840
Okay.

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.840
Readings and salutations.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.840
Anybody home?

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.840
I'll create another suicide.

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:50.840
I'll create another suicide.

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:53.840
I'll create another suicide.

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:54.840
I'll create another suicide.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:00.840
What the?

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.840
How did you get in here?

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.840
Oh, my savior.

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:08.840
Thank you, Andy.

01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:12.840
Sai.

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:15.840
Oh fuck, that's kind of hot.

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.840
Andrew doesn't seem to please with you right now.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.840
You wonder if it's a good time to tell him that this is your fault.

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.840
Oh, my God, the bloody hand.

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.840
Come on then, Laili.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:30.840
Let's go.

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.840
Shish, I thought I got caught there.

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:37.840
You did.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.840
Happens to the best of...

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:42.840
Right, he do be kind of hot.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.840
Oh, my God.

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.840
What do we do now?

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.840
Let's escape.

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.840
Well, you've done it now, Andy.

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:52.840
You've actually killed a man.

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:54.840
Like, directly.

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:56.840
Yup.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:57.840
I was a little surprised there.

01:50:58.840 --> 01:50:59.840
So where's your mental breakdown?

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:01.840
I'm saving it for later.

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:02.840
Lay off.

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:13.840
I'm reading deleted messages that mods deleted.

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:15.840
You guys are so funny.

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:22.840
I know, I'm sorry, I know.

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:23.840
These standards are impossible.

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.840
I know it's, I know it's not, I know.

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.840
I can't expect any of you to be murderers.

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.840
Actually, I'm not in the mood right now for your shit.

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:33.840
All right.

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.840
Oh, looky here.

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:38.840
Got a key to room 405.

01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:40.840
405.

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:44.840
What's in here?

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:45.840
Ew, okay.

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:51.840
Women only want one thing and it's a fucking murder.

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:55.840
While loading the jacket pockets, you find a wallet with $600.

01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:59.840
Now you got real moral dilemma here, stealing a dead man's wallet.

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.840
Oh.

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:07.840
Which one will make him want to fuck me?

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.840
I'm guessing splitting it, right?

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:15.840
Right?

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:21.840
A tiny consequence.

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.840
He saved your life, you brat.

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:27.840
At least give him some of the cash.

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:29.840
Okay, okay, okay.

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:30.840
Aren't you a sweetheart?

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:32.840
Don't say that, don't say that.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.840
I'll use some of mine to treat you something to some...

01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:42.840
I'll use some of mine to treat you something someday.

01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:43.840
Maybe?

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:46.840
Okay.

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:49.840
Where do we go?

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.840
Do we go to the other room?

01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:59.840
You just kept it different now?

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.840
What do I do?

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:07.840
It was a 333 split.

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:08.840
But...

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:15.840
You will find two more of them in the game.

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.840
Get on you for sharing?

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.840
Of course I always share with my brother.

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:21.840
I always...

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:23.840
I will always share everything.

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.840
I'm just looking for things to interact with.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.840
Because I don't know what else to do.

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:32.840
You can leave from the neighbor's house.

01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:34.840
Yes, I have done that.

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.840
Hey, sit down on the toilet.

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.840
Actually, no, I'll sit down and you pee between my legs, okay?

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:44.840
Oh my gosh!

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:47.840
That actually worked!

01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:48.840
Maybe I'll take a shower.

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.840
Not right now, you won't.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:51.840
Okay, fine, jeez.

01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:57.840
No, like leave the apartments.

01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:58.840
Oh!

01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:00.840
Oh, oh, oh.

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:03.840
Okay.

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.840
Oh, shit.

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:07.840
You unlocked the door and...

01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:14.840
Don't stand behind me like that, jeez.

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:21.840
I just want to make sure we're on the same page about something.

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:26.840
Whatever excuse we had for eating that other guy just went out the window because of your screw up.

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.840
Oh, I'm sorry, did I ask you to kill him?

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.840
What do you think is going to happen if I hadn't?

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:36.840
Look, I'm not saying I'm not grateful, Andrew.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.840
I am, but what's your point?

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.840
I wish he grabbed me like that!

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.840
My point is that no matter what happens beyond the store,

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:58.840
you won't speak a word of what went down here to anyone.

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.840
Yeah, obviously, obviously.

01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:05.840
And it'll no doubt be obvious we did something once this guy's shift ends

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.840
and the next warning comes around, comes looking around.

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.840
As best we disappear while we can.

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:13.840
Yeah, as you might have noticed, I'm trying!

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:18.840
You see, I'm not sure you're grasping the gravity of our situation here.

01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:21.840
Knowing you, you think you're going to find mom and dad.

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.840
But I'm saying all of that is off the table.

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:27.840
I didn't plan on anything, actually.

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.840
God, that's even worse!

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.840
Okay, so you want me to never contact anyone I know ever again?

01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:36.840
Because you think they'll snitch on us to the authorities, is that it?

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:37.840
Yes, exactly!

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.840
Yeah, fine, whatever.

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.840
Capitan, that's what it reminded me of, yeah?

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.840
If you're going to be this flippant about this,

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.840
it isn't the authorities you need to worry about.

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:52.840
What's that supposed to mean?

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:54.840
Are you threatening me right now?

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:56.840
Ah!

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.840
I'm not going to jail just because you think of yourself as impurevious to consequences.

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:06.840
So you're going to take this to your grave and if...

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.840
The tear just ran down my leg.

01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.840
Even if I have to put you in there myself.

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.840
Oh my god, please put me in my grave, please!

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:18.840
You don't scare me, Andrew.

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:20.840
Ah!

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:21.840
Don't give me re-

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.840
Ah!

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:25.840
Ah!

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.840
Andi, it smells in hell the damn afraid of you.

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.840
Now back the fuck off!

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.840
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840
I'm stressed out, Lele.

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.840
Truly the ideal relationship.

01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.840
Okay, yeah, I can see that.

01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.840
I need to know what you're...

01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.840
I need to know you're taking this seriously.

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.840
There's half a dead guy in our freezer with my fingerprints all over it.

01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.840
Trust me, I'm in no hurry to tell the world about this.

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.840
Hmm? All good? Can we go now?

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:11.840
Yeah, I guess.

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.840
Okay, finally.

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.840
Though, Andi,

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:20.840
I don't give a rat's ass about mom and or dad or any of my so-called friends anymore.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.840
Not one of them felt it necessary to even answer my calls.

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:28.840
I know my dreams have come true.

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:33.840
They got such a beautifully toxic relationship.

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:35.840
I'm sorry, I still have...

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:38.840
I'm like constantly stuck in on cough drops right now.

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:43.840
Yeah, truly a romantic relationship.

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.840
Or come fling food up toward balcony.

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:52.840
Would be quite the feat to throw something so high.

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:55.840
The point is no one even came to try.

01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:59.840
So my affections officially died with all the brain cells I lost while starving.

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.840
But it's alright because Andi is here with me,

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.840
even though he feels like threatening me for some reason.

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:07.840
Sorry.

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.840
I guess I lost some brain cells too.

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.840
I can tell!

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:13.840
Can't lose what we...

01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.840
Oh, can't lose what you don't have!

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.840
Hahahaha.

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.840
Kiss it to our mouth like you said earlier.

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:26.840
There you go.

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.840
I don't know if you heard anything.

01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:33.840
Oh, fuck you.

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:36.840
I like how they do a little shing.

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:40.840
Alright, alright, let's get the hell out of here, ready?

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.840
Oh, what is this?

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:44.840
That's a door.

01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:46.840
401 is open!

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.840
Oh, fuck off.

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.840
Is this our door?

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:54.840
This is all it took to keep us in a wooden board.

01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:56.840
It's okay, Andi, I don't have much muscle either.

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.840
Your eyes say you're trying to cover me,

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.840
but your words do the opposite.

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.840
Whatever.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.840
What's the slip of paper say?

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:10.840
They are collecting our blood.

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:14.840
You're welcome, you're welcome.

01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:20.840
I wish I was that cough drop.

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:25.840
What's that supposed to mean?

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.840
Don't know, don't care.

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:29.840
Yeah, let's just focus on getting out of here.

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:32.840
Okay.

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.840
I guess we go in here.

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:38.840
So is this the girl that died?

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:42.840
Hmm.

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:45.840
I sincerely don't care.

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:46.840
Let's just get out of here, please.

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:47.840
Shut up!

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:49.840
I'm working on it, goddammit.

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:51.840
Oh my god, you're so fucking whiny.

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.840
Like, I'm trying it, I'm trying it.

01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:57.840
We should finish the noodles though.

01:59:58.840 --> 01:59:59.840
No, on the fridge.

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:03.840
Notice from now on, AB types won't be given supplies,

02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:05.840
except if something's important.

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:06.840
Oh!

02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:09.840
We were AB.

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:15.840
Note 403 has an XO for it?

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.840
And no, the lady from 302 being hot doesn't count as important.

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:21.840
Stop asking!

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:23.840
Wait, what?

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:33.840
AB can receive from everyone, but only give to AB.

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.840
Is the lady from 302 single?

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:42.840
Is your brother single?

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.840
Is the toilet, there's nothing of interest inside?

02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.840
Well, you don't know that, let me check.

02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:50.840
Oh, there's notes on all of them.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:53.840
2A1B.

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.840
1O, this crossed over.

02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.840
Hmm.

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:14.840
Why are you telling me these facts about blood types?

02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.840
Am I supposed to know?

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:18.840
Should I know this?

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:34.840
Let me out!

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:35.840
What do I do now?

02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:37.840
Go in here?

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.840
Just want to know?

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840
Stop calling me Imi.

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.840
There's no Imi, just Imi.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.840
Who's this girl Imi?

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.840
Why do you keep bringing her up?

02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:58.840
Jesus.

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.840
Stop mentioning her.

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:04.840
What?

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.840
Lots of 666's going on.

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:18.840
Imi is my sister?

02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.840
You have another sister?

02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:23.840
Huh?

02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.840
And you never told me?

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.840
What the hell?

02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.840
Check the warden one last time?

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:32.840
Okay, sorry.

02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:33.840
I'll go check on it.

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.840
Oh wait, I should be able to leave from here, right?

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.840
Because I unblocked it?

02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:41.840
This is the warden's place, right?

02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:46.840
Oh, the pewter!

02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:48.840
They've got a little surveillance camera.

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.840
Oh crap, are we on it?

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:51.840
No, looks like it's recording the second floor.

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.840
Let me see.

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.840
Wait, there's another warden there.

02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.840
Is that a gun holster?

02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:59.840
Didn't the other warden have one?

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.840
What's this guy?

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:05.840
You're the far cuter sister?

02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:07.840
It better be.

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:11.840
You only had a key to the closest room in a walkie-talkie.

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.840
Sorry.

02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:19.840
Okay, I know you keep hearing vibrating, please.

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.840
It's my phone.

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:27.840
There, I muted my phone so you won't hear any more vibrating.

02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:31.840
Ugh.

02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:44.840
It is my phone.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:49.840
They probably work in pairs.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.840
It's not like they have to do anything else

02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:56.840
then keep curious people away

02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.840
and pretend to feed us, I guess.

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:02.840
Well, even then, how are we getting around him?

02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:08.840
It's okay, have your fun, I don't mind.

02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:12.840
You will know when I have my fun, okay?

02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:13.840
I'll make it very obvious.

02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.840
Oh, there's a key here!

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:17.840
Oh, let's go to the fourth floor.

02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:21.840
Oh, can we?

02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.840
Oh, the third floor, sorry, the third floor.

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:32.840
One A, but it's crossed over.

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.840
I'm guessing the crossed over ones mean they're dead.

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.840
Oh, hello!

02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:40.840
Hey, hey, hold up, don't you dare come any closer.

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:41.840
Who are you?

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:43.840
Your neighbors from upstairs?

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.840
What are you doing here?

02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.840
Get out.

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:49.840
Well, we found the keys and thought you might want to get out of here.

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:51.840
You thought wrong, get lost, huh?

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.840
What, don't you understand?

02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:57.840
You don't want to get out of here?

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:00.840
That's what I said, why would I want out?

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:03.840
I get free food and can't even play games all day long.

02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:04.840
Huh?

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:11.840
Your special phone that has no screen and just one button.

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.840
Oh, is this the hot lady?

02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:20.840
They showed favoritism to the hot lady, didn't they?

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:21.840
Okay.

02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:27.840
I live like a king, I hope this quarantine never ends.

02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:29.840
They actually bring you food?

02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:30.840
Of course.

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:35.840
Literally anything I want, all you gotta do is ask nicely.

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:38.840
Oh, bro, she's been having sex with the warden, hasn't she been?

02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:42.840
Hasn't she been, like, bent over and open wide nicely?

02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:43.840
Ashley.

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:50.840
Fuck you, get out of here, get out of here, get out, both of you.

02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:55.840
I'm going in your bathroom.

02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.840
Hey, did I give you permission to go there?

02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:59.840
I went in your kitchen.

02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:02.840
Girl, don't you at least do your fucking dishes.

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:04.840
Can I steal some of her food?

02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:09.840
Someone gave up assembling their furniture.

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:13.840
Why don't you ask the warden to assemble your furniture?

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:15.840
Can we put the nail gun in her head?

02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:18.840
Okay.

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.840
Neat girlfriend of my dreams.

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:25.840
No, I'm your neat girlfriend of your dreams.

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:27.840
Well, that was something.

02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:29.840
How come we got such different treatments?

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:30.840
Why don't I get food?

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.840
I guess you're just not pretty enough.

02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:39.840
You think she's pretty?

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.840
Wasn't she?

02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:52.840
No, shut up about objectively.

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:56.840
Yeah, his stock is plummeting.

02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.840
I'm selling Andrew coin right now.

02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:02.840
Is it okay to leave her there after she saw us though?

02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:05.840
Probably not, but you go in there swinging your...

02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:09.840
You go in there swinging your cleaver and she'll definitely scream.

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.840
Blonds are just hotter?

02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:20.840
I can't tell if you're trying to give me a compliment or not.

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.840
You can admire something without wanting it?

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:24.840
No, you can't!

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:26.840
No, you can't!

02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:29.840
You cannot admire something without wanting it.

02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:33.840
Don't be admiring...

02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:36.840
Don't be admiring shit in front of me.

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:41.840
I think our best bet is to finish the ritual

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.840
and use it to get rid of the second warden.

02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:54.840
Well, if we can get this woman up to the cultist room,

02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.840
we've got us assault to offer.

02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:59.840
How on earth are we going to convince her lazy ass

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:01.840
to even leave her room?

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:04.840
Beats me, let's just finish setting up the ritual for now.

02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:05.840
Alright.

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:07.840
Do you really think I'm not pretty enough?

02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.840
Oh, come on!

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:13.840
So ugly am I?

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:16.840
So ugly that I shouldn't even be fed?

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.840
Or maybe they think...

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:20.840
Or maybe they didn't think it'd be fun to screw you

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.840
while I'm loitering around the house.

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:25.840
Oh yeah, okay, fair point.

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:31.840
You're already my type, Imi?

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.840
Good.

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:41.840
I am admiring nothing.

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:42.840
I only have eyes for you.

02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.840
That's how it should be!

02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:46.840
That's how it should be!

02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:50.840
No, don't admire any stupid missiles.

02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:51.840
Stupid missiles.

02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:53.840
Missiles don't have holes in them.

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:00.840
Okay, anyways.

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.840
I wouldn't let them anyways.

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:03.840
YEEEHHH!

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:04.840
Thank you!

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:08.840
You better not let them.

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:11.840
Unknown the door is too big.

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:12.840
Okay.

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:14.840
Is anyone else home?

02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.840
Not soft holes at least.

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:18.840
Yeah.

02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:19.840
You want to fuck a missile?

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.840
Go ahead, be my guest.

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:25.840
Oh, another floor.

02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:26.840
Oh wait, this is our floor.

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.840
Wait, what did we want to do?

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.840
We wanted to finish setting up the ritual, right?

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:31.840
How do we do that?

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:36.840
A walkie-talkie.

02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:37.840
Useless.

02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:39.840
I don't know, at least we'll hear if the others

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.840
weren't trying to contact this one.

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:43.840
Which then indicates time is running out for us.

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.840
Only admire Amy, yeah.

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.840
No, don't admire any other girls.

02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:57.840
And don't want any other girls either.

02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:58.840
Big deal.

02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:00.840
At that point, we're screwed anyway.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.840
Hey, what if we call the warden over with this

02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:05.840
and have the demon eat his soul?

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.840
That's not a bad idea, actually.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.840
Two birds with one stone!

02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:10.840
Though he'll come in guns blazing.

02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:11.840
Ah, right.

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:12.840
Let me think.

02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:13.840
Let me think.

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:14.840
Let me think.

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:15.840
Let me think.

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:16.840
Let me think.

02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.840
Let me think.

02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:18.840
Let me think.

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.840
Let me think.

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:20.840
Let me think.

02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:21.840
Let me think.

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:22.840
Let me think.

02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:23.840
Let me think.

02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:24.840
Let me think.

02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:25.840
Let me think.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.840
Right.

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.840
Let me think.

02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:31.840
While you're at it, I'll read the ritual for us.

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:33.840
What do I need to do?

02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:34.840
I don't remember.

02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:35.840
Check the guidebook.

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:42.840
I keep leaning over on my chair to try to fart,

02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:43.840
but it's not coming out.

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:45.840
I'm getting stream,

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.840
I'm getting stream shy or something.

02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:54.840
Jake isn't a girl.

02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:56.840
Stay out of trouble.

02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.840
I'm not falling for you.

02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:02.840
You're a missile now in me

02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.840
since four-

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:04.840

is trying to read that.

02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:16.840
Check the guidebook.

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:18.840

object I want to make a penis joke there but I won't hold it for an occasional

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:56.680
clairvoyant dream to gouge the Troubles ahead thank you

02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:05.600
yeah the entity has left why do the dead bodies look like that oh they're

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:09.600
upside down that's why you're still alive unlike either of the wardens man

02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:14.920
that all happened way too fast in the end I didn't get its name nor to ask for

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:22.600
a favor it's the clairvoyant object two inches I wasn't gonna make a joke about

02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:44.040
my penis come on it was about yours I spilled water on the mic yes my 7 inch

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:58.040
Excalibur my 7 inch wand my 7 inch Gucci destroyer my my pen it's um

02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:06.480
and it definitely just gave me whatever trash was lying around as demon

02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:11.200
pockets but no matter the warden is dead and if I have even one clairvoyant

02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:15.360
dream that'd be cool as hell

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:30.720
pinkie-pumper so mean you decide not to linger on the fact your soul is

02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:38.040

02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:30.640
on earth I thought you were holding her in place well I let go why did you let

02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:35.520
go you're taking a while I figured she wouldn't start anything as long as I

02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:40.160
had my cleaver lesson learned how interesting that you'd want to take

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:45.680
your chances with that for no reason what are you getting at you were trying

02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:49.800
to fuck her weren't you that's why you let her go and then she tried to shoot

02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:55.480
you with her nail gun you did say she was pretty I didn't try anything with her

02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:59.840
yeah okay yeah yeah and here I was wondering why you insisted on staying

02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:08.880
behind hi mercy yeah what an asshole I should shoot him with my gun teach him

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:16.520
a lesson Andrew shoots his load while I risk getting shot by the warden are you

02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:22.040
unaware that the lady is left dead right now I guess she said no secure you

02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:28.160
actually almost got shot too that's your own fault for letting her go I can't

02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:32.480
believe what a dumbass you are when it comes to women for the last time I

02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:37.240
wasn't trying to get with her and even if I had which I didn't so what she's dead

shot anything yet what I think I left my gun back in the room I really wish

02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:20.860
you'd be less nonchalant about everything all the time I'm moderately

02:50:20.860 --> 02:50:23.580
terrified of your searches wait there's literally nothing what do you mean you

02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:26.780

nothing there so in this chapter there's a ton of stuff to interact with show it

02:50:52.500 --> 02:51:00.820
no okay I really wish you'd be less nonchalant about everything all the time

02:51:00.820 --> 02:51:03.980
hey now we can't both be constantly shitting ourselves over every little

02:51:04.340 --> 02:51:09.780
thing true let's just go back to the motel before someone breaks in and steals

02:51:09.780 --> 02:51:17.420
a damn thing why would someone break in eat food wait this is actually funny

02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:22.260
this reminds me of something when I was in high school me and my friend made a

02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:29.940
trash a potted plant subsists among cigarette but when I was in high school

02:51:29.940 --> 02:51:37.860
me and my friend for 11th grade final we decided to draw a comic together and

02:51:37.860 --> 02:51:42.740
this isn't even a funny story it's just reminds me of something and in the

02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:46.740
comic we had to draw some advertisements and our advertisements were

02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:55.580
basically just the words like that eat food drink Pepsi friend guys it's a girl

02:51:55.900 --> 02:52:04.300
it was a girl she was one of my besties in high school I miss her she's not that

02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:11.580
she's not that she's not that she's not that is she single? she's a lesbian

02:52:13.580 --> 02:52:17.980
just kidding get out the road stupid

02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:37.900
that clearly doesn't answer the question it doesn't matter also why are you

02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:47.260
asking if my friend is single don't worry about my friend an ad for a coffee

02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:50.820
shop it's difficult to imagine the aroma of warm cup of coffee with trash running

02:52:50.820 --> 02:53:02.980
next to you can we be lesbians? shut up everybody she's single shut up do you hate me is that

02:53:02.980 --> 02:53:10.500
why you're asking are you tired of me already are you tired of living in

03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:49.860

03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:14.580
the the opposite impression here yeah yeah you think I'm so awful huh

03:01:18.260 --> 03:01:20.100
oh hold on

03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:29.620
barking is cringe these later she's a bark I never said barking was cringe did I

03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:31.460
I've been barking

03:01:34.100 --> 03:01:39.380
you want to see what it's like when I actually misbehave it could be so much worse

03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:43.380
should I show you just how should I show you just how awful I really am

03:01:44.340 --> 03:01:50.980
ah go for it that you're going to find me a lot less accommodating than Andy

03:01:54.580 --> 03:02:01.700
and now some less important news one of the quarantine departments has had a bit of a situation

03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:07.700
I wish she would grab me like that I'll grab you like that

03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:08.420
that

03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:16.580
nothing major just a fire that burned the whole place down everybody died yes

03:02:16.580 --> 03:02:21.700
everybody a representative of the water company is here with us today is there anything you'd like

03:02:21.700 --> 03:02:27.300
to add yes my deepest condolences to the family members of the deceased this apartment was most

03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:33.780
definitely not a wholly mismanaged mess better burned to the ground so it's good that they escaped

03:02:34.580 --> 03:02:40.420
are you even tall enough to grab any just just bend over

03:02:42.740 --> 03:02:46.580
I am tall enough to grab you like that you just gotta bend over for me

03:02:50.500 --> 03:02:55.300
therefore it is so sad that this happened to ease that sadness we recommend you try our talks

03:02:56.740 --> 03:03:00.820
we just rolled out three new and exciting flavors excuse me sir something seems to

03:03:00.820 --> 03:03:06.180
be going wrong with your microphone I'm sure you mean to say drink our trusty bubbly pop what

03:03:06.180 --> 03:03:11.460
happened which happens to be our sponsor and it doesn't even make your organs bleed out of your

03:03:11.460 --> 03:03:18.180
ass unlike some alternatives anyway um that was all for now tune in again later for a more wholesome

03:03:18.180 --> 03:03:29.940
news to cheer up your day if you insist I do insist that was our apartment wasn't it was being

03:03:29.940 --> 03:03:36.980
the correct tense indeed did I leave the oven on I said everybody died oh that's great isn't it

03:03:38.660 --> 03:03:44.580
they must think we died too and all the evidence of our escape escapades let's say has been incinerated

03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:47.300
I wonder about that

03:03:52.580 --> 03:03:57.540
I told you it'll all work out that still leaves us homeless and just about penniless

03:04:00.180 --> 03:04:06.100
whatever things are clearly clearly gonna sort themselves out I'm gonna get some sleep good night

03:04:09.220 --> 03:04:14.340
the water company that owns the current in-world coca-cola product talks talks to soda is there

03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:18.580
some sort of conspiracy theory that I'm not I'm not that's not clicking for me

03:04:22.020 --> 03:04:24.580
I don't know who this bend over person is

03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:31.700
I'm gonna stay up a bit longer maybe the late night news will have more information on the fire

03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:40.660
suit yourself I don't know in a minute oh okay okay well I guess I'm gonna sleep

03:04:41.220 --> 03:04:43.220
as usual you fall asleep without a care in the world

03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:49.860
oh shit oh this is the dream someone has entered the room

03:04:55.540 --> 03:04:57.540

03:05:01.860 --> 03:05:06.340

so want to stay here and see if the killer actually shows up

03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:46.980
and what did I do to deserve to get murdered for in my sleep anyways

03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:52.340
might be a risky a bit risky staying here you don't want that you don't know which direction they came from

03:05:52.340 --> 03:05:58.180
right assuming anyone shows up anyway they will I'm sure

03:06:01.540 --> 03:06:07.300
have you actually never played this before no I haven't of course not

03:06:09.540 --> 03:06:15.940
Andrew lights up his fourth cigarette oh cringe Andrew come on that's not hot come on

03:06:16.660 --> 03:06:21.220

what the hell yeah ill smoker cringe some people think I smoke weed too guys I don't smoke weed

03:06:33.460 --> 03:06:37.460
I would never put my rats life in danger like that by smoking weed next to them

03:06:44.580 --> 03:06:49.060
it's probably cold because that crap misses with your blood circulation okay mom

03:06:50.020 --> 03:06:54.580
makes you impotent too by the way uh that's okay we don't want any babies

03:06:54.580 --> 03:06:59.060
it didn't sound like I'd be it didn't sound like I'd be meeting any girls anytime soon anyway

03:06:59.780 --> 03:07:04.260
but stopping you I love it when he looks like that

03:07:07.380 --> 03:07:12.500
consider hot smoker girl smoking is not hot except in this situation when it is

03:07:19.220 --> 03:07:24.340
all right I said enough quiet you I thought we were hiding

03:07:36.100 --> 03:07:41.140

didn't we eat that guy don't say that out loud

03:07:50.020 --> 03:07:53.300

03:07:53.300 --> 03:07:54.420
their mom what did the mom do

03:08:03.220 --> 03:08:09.460
you'll see okay sorry didn't we chop that guy up and store him in a freezer

03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:14.900
Ashley come on he seriously though I guess there's more where he came from

03:08:14.980 --> 03:08:20.980
or do you suppose he was off to a sex and drugs party with demons duh why are you asking me

03:08:23.460 --> 03:08:27.380
whatever should we follow him but I'm trying to see if my vision comes true or not

03:08:29.300 --> 03:08:33.940
it's not like we both have to be here really don't want to stand here alone in the middle of the night

03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:35.540
