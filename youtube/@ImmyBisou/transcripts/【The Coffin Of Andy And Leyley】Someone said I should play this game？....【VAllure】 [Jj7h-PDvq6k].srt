00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,080

11
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
let me turn on the background music because it's, it fits our theme

12
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,080
hello oh my god what an eventful day right?

13
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,080
okay well if you saw my twitter it was slightly eventful because I made my announcement

14
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm once again eating sausage rolls

15
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Strani asks if you are on RuneScape with her right now, no?

16
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,080
I don't even know how to play RuneScape, I don't have RuneScape

17
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,080
why is someone trolling her?

18
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
is someone trolling her as me or something?

19
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:56,080
I'm dipping my sausage rolls in sriracha sauce too

20
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:07,080
it was an imposter?

21
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,080
you have RuneScape it came free with your xbox? why do you assume I have an xbox?

22
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,080
I don't have an xbox

23
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,080
don't forget to drink your water if you're gonna read everything ah fuck is there a lot of dialogue?

24
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,080
this is gonna be rough, okay

25
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,080
how long is this game? right yeah sorry today we're playing the coffin of Andy and Lele

26
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,080
I've never played it before, apparently there's some themes that relate to me

27
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:46,080
um now I know the, I know the um

28
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
can I say it? I think I can say it

29
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,080
I know the incest route is like an optional route so you're gonna have to um

30
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,080
you're gonna have to lead me down that route

31
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,080
okay um we're gonna have to go down that route

32
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,080
you and me both are going down the incest route

33
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,080
it's 10 hours long ah shit

34
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,080
um okay well we can't finish it today then

35
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,080
of course we're intentionally doing it, what do you mean?

36
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,080
no blind run? no of course do you wanna, you're gonna watch me play this fucking game

37
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:30,080
and you're gonna expect me to not go through the incest route, what do you mean?

38
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:41,080
of course we're going down the incest route, it's not even a choice

39
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,080
I can't do a 10 hour stream, I'm sorry

40
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:58,080
right before we start let me test something

41
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
my name is Andy I don't think I should be watching this

42
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
well you're in luck because my name is Lele

43
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,080
today I'm Lele or is it Lele? it's not Lele is it?

44
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:17,080
it's Lele right?

45
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,080
it should come naturally to me? I don't know

46
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,080
I'm not really good at getting the endings I want in visual novels

47
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,080
so I don't know if I'll be able to get the right ending

48
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,080
alright so I think I fixed the super chat, not the super chat, the tip

49
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:43,080
so let me test it out

50
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
what should I say?

51
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,080
give me a sentence to test the tip alert with

52
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
give me a funny sentence

53
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:03,080
to see because I have text to speech on but I'm not sure if it's gonna work

54
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Pog? come on get creative

55
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:19,080

58
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080

like frozen ones

98
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,080

exit shift to run

125
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,080
I have to run in this game?

126
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
it's an RPG maker game

127
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
the native resolution is a square

128
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
oh that's stupid they should stop doing that

129
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,080
no one's monitor is square shaped anymore

130
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
make them rectangle

131
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
like a freaking normal person

132
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
weed eater

133
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
what do you mean weed eater?

134
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,080
are you accusing me of being on drugs?

135
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,080
this isn't a horror game right?

136
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
right?

137
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080

144
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,080

145
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
are you gay?

146
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,080
why are you acting so gay?

147
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
an eating animation is the absolute best

148
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
okay now it shouldn't get cut off

149
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Jesus thank you for the $3 tip

150
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
it's not eating animation

151
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
it's just my mouth moving

152
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
I made Andy a smoker

153
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080

167
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080

168
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
hope you enjoy the game

186
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
oh thank you Akari

187
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
I hope I enjoyed it too

188
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
thank you for the five dollars

189
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
okay good morning Ashley

190
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
as much as you love feeling sorry for yourself

191
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
it's time for a little interlude

192
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
or should I actually show you the dialogue

193
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
that's probably better huh

194
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
something like that so you can actually

195
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
see the dialogue

196
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
okay

197
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
oh it's titled find your entrance

198
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
to not die

199
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
ready set go

200
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
are you gay?

201
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
so gay

202
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
you don't have to test the tips anymore

203
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
it works

204
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
thank you for the tip

205
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
oh my gosh

206
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
come on can you give me more than just the tip

207
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
I want more

208
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
okay wait I need to

209
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
make it a little quieter

210
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
like one percent

211
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,080
no

212
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,080
three percent

213
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
I don't know

214
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
what do I do here

215
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
oh is that me?

216
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
did you pass your test today?

217
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
I don't know yet I didn't get it graded

218
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
I'll let you know when I get it back

219
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
okay I have to give food to eat right?

220
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
right?

221
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
is this the food?

222
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
junk and unpaid bills they cannot be eaten

223
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
are you gay?

224
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
why are you acting so gay?

225
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
more you say

226
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
thank you for the $50

227
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
oh I got more than the tip

228
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
thank you

229
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
it's Lele

230
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
yeah oh yeah we have to feed Lele

231
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
you're used to filling your stomach with water

232
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
that's not true at all

233
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
but it's not enough your body needs sustenance

234
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
nah nah

235
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
I'll be eaten

236
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
the coffee machine sits alone inside and abandoned

237
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
there are only so many times you can brew the same

238
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
grounds so no more

239
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
coffee in this house

240
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
brew the same grounds

241
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
wait I don't know enough about coffee

242
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
how's that work?

243
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
should we all tell sis this is kind of a horror game?

244
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
is it?

245
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
can I eat the trash?

246
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
this is where you and your older brother pile your trash

247
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
it's already been scattered several times

248
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
and this is utterly

249
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
exhausted as the food source

250
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
we're eating from the trash?

251
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
it's not a horror game?

252
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
it is a horror game and you're telling me it's not

253
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
so that I get surprised

254
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
what is that?

255
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
a can of tomato! amazing

256
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
you should show that to your brother

257
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
okay

258
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
wait what?

259
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
I've been locked in

260
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
it's not exactly horror?

261
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
it has horror elements

262
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
okay okay I'll come show you

263
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
which way? where's the door?

264
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
this way? the bathroom door is locked

265
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
oh this is the bathroom

266
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
okay you're not in here

267
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
where are you?

268
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
oh there you are

269
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
hi I have a can of tomatoes

270
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
tada

271
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
oh he looks annoyed

272
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
not the reaction you were hoping for

273
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
tada

274
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
we're not eating that

275
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
no

276
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
that's the very last thing we have Ashley

277
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
why are they so poor?

278
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
it's just disturbing

279
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
psychological horror

280
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
can I like a moray then?

281
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
horror

282
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
I'm a horror so a horror game is perfect for me

283
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
I think we should hold on to it a little longer

284
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
quit your complaining

285
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
you're energetic enough

286
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
to go rummaging through our trash

287
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
so clearly you're not dying yet

288
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
huh?

289
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
how did you know it wasn't?

290
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
because I hid it there away from you

291
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I live in a den of snakes

292
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
ah don't round me up

293
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
you're making me hungry

294
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
eat this pussy then

295
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
do you know what?

296
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
do you know what would help with that?

297
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Andrew my dear?

298
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
no but the tomato

299
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I can't fucking read

300
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
this is not a good game for me to play

301
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
are you poor?

302
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
why are you so poor?

303
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
they're in quarantine?

304
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
no put the tomatoes away somewhere

305
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
put them in my mouth I will

306
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I can see that your heart is set on this

307
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
fine let's eat them then

308
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
screw our future selves

309
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
screw our future selves

310
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
time for you to go cook some tomatoes

311
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
why are we living in such a

312
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
such a stinkin

313
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
warden

314
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
every line you read is filled with thirst

315
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
is it? hello

316
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
if you won't make a sound

317
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
I'll assume you're dead

318
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
and I don't bring food to the dead

319
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
you don't bring it to the living either

320
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
I'll take that as a yes still alive

321
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
and don't blame me for the delivery guy screwing up

322
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
can you go grab something for us?

323
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
oh from the store for us?

324
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
nah not my job

325
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
I'll check in on you later bye

326
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
no wait

327
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
wait wait come back

328
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
he doesn't

329
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
your voice is perfect for this?

330
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
I don't think it is

331
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
I don't really think I sound like her

332
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
god damn it

333
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
let me out

334
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
ok fine

335
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
wait can you hear the sound effects good?

336
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
yeah that's good

337
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
ok we'll fine I'll cook my tomatoes

338
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
you boil the canned tomatoes to make delicious boiled canned tomatoes

339
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
wow

340
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
there's even a little bit of pepper left to season with

341
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
this is some gourmet stuff right here

342
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
no salt though

343
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
well we're white people aren't we so it doesn't really matter

344
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
we can handle it

345
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
your voice is perfect in general

346
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
thank you

347
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
you've used all of it to spike your water

348
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
in order to avoid over hydrating yourself

349
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
while drinking

350
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
to fill your stomach

351
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
what the fuck

352
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
well how is it

353
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,080
at this point you could feed me a can of worms

354
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
and I'd say it's the best thing I ever ate

355
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
this is so depressing

356
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
kiss ass

357
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
no I'm saying that's how hungry I am

358
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,080
it is in that moment

359
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
an ominous audio assault to your eardrums

360
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
are you kidding me

361
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
the neighbors at it again

362
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
want to take a peek? no

363
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
but I'll come along if you do

364
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
balcony key

365
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
oh he's following me

366
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
he's so cute

367
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
salt is overrated

368
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
no it's not

369
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
season your fucking food

370
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,080
guys

371
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
it's jake

372
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
what's he doing over there

373
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
can't really see squat from here

374
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080

the chair

380
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080

505
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
paced through the incest route

506
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
they said we should stay at home until

521
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I didn't drink anything

522
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080

527
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080

566
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080

567
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080

after reminiscing all night

575
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
you wake up as one does

576
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080

577
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
your misery you decide to clean the house

578
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080

for the thumbnail

603
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
because I commissioned

604
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
an artist for it

605
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
and it's really cute

606
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,080

yeah I hope there's no culling

610
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
cause that's gonna fucking suck if I get culled

611
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
oh I'm not drawing the sketch

612
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
I commissioned an artist

613
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
yawn

614
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
you're cleaning what a waste of energy

615
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080

616
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080

00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080

618
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
you can't overdo cleaning

619
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
come to think of it do we even have any detergent left

620
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
I don't know

621
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
are you making me do laundry all alone

622
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
oh okay

623
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
okay

624
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
too exhausted

625
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
um

626
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
do I need a rag?

627
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
are you gay?

628
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
why are you acting so gay

629
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,080
you're a slime girl

630
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm so fucking jelly

631
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080

632
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
thank you disco man sir

633
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,080
when you're starving

634
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
any amount of energy spent is a waste

635
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,080
no that's not true

636
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
energy talking to me

637
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
is never a waste

638
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
um

639
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080

641
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
I wish I could make my chat bigger

642
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
maybe I should look on my phone

643
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I'm literally too blind to see chat right now

644
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080

645
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080

755
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
excuse that

756
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
I don't know why that opened

757
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
oh my phone's falling

758
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
that's why it opened there we go

759
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
okay I'm gonna go get water BRB

760
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
should I put the BRB screen on

761
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
oh

762
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
oh

763
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
oh

764
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
oh

765
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
oh

766
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
oh

767
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
oh

768
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
oh

769
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
oh

770
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
oh

771
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
oh

772
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
oh

773
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
oh

774
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,080
oh

775
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
oh

776
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
oh

777
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
oh

778
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
oh

779
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,080
oh

780
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
oh

781
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
oh

782
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
oh

783
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
oh

784
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:33,440
I'm signing off, I'll see ya.

785
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:53,840
Hello, I'm back.

786
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:03,280
I didn't go pee, I just went to get more water.

787
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,760
Go through the homework for real on each and ton look folder.

788
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,640
I don't have a homework folder on this computer profile that is.

789
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,000
Maybe on a different computer profile I do, but you're never going to see that one.

790
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You don't know the password to that one.

791
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,760
Right.

792
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,200
Um, Amy, did you wash your hands?

793
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
I didn't pee, I just went to get more water.

794
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,040
Shut up.

795
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,880
I didn't, I don't need to wash my hands.

796
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,400
Someone's talking on the other end of the line, but you can't make out the words.

797
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,120
They sound more and more upset as they talk, though.

798
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,720
Well, that's, I mean, I can't do anything about that.

799
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,200
Or I can try talking to her, but sorry if my cadence when reading is shit.

800
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Um, yeah, it is.

801
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,000
No, it's not big bro is cute 2024 and it's not I love on each and 13.

802
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,720
Come on, I'm not, I'm not that predictable.

803
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,320
What the hell?

804
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:14,520
You think so lowly of me that I would put such a shit password?

805
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,440
Um, no, I'm not angry.

806
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,960
I'm just sounds like he's talking to a girlfriend.

807
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,880
No, I can you let me talk?

808
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,880
What's on the other end must have said no.

809
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,640
It's increasingly allowed, but you still can't make out all the words.

810
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:41,680
Always about you don't lay and Ashley and have the time to think.

811
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,960
Just can't anymore.

812
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,240
He is talking to his girlfriend.

813
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,120
It's not dick on 69.

814
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,440
Come on.

815
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:01,120
I'm not that cringed.

816
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,640
If you loved us, you'd make a deliberately easy password.

817
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,640
It is.

818
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,640
It is an easy password.

819
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,080
It is an easy password.

820
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:15,920
It's my, um, it's my school password from like when we had computer class in like second

821
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
grade.

822
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,920
It's the same password from all the way back then because I still remember it.

823
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,920
I might be stupid, but I still have okay memory.

824
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,800
It is not password 1234 shut up.

825
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
So that's it then.

826
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
Now it's quite on both ends.

827
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,840
All right, I guess.

828
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
What else is there to say?

829
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Sorry.

830
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:49,480
I should really, I really don't see why I should be held accountable for a faint beep beep beep

831
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,840
of a dropped call can be heard.

832
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Ah.

833
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
Sorry.

834
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
What was it?

835
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,840
My ex-girlfriend apparently.

836
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
Ooh, she dumped you.

837
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
Why is that?

838
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Why do you think?

839
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,840
How should I know?

840
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Maybe because you're a person-infested home buddy that's apparently permacore.

841
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Or because she found someone new.

842
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,840
It's been a few months, buddy.

843
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,840
Or maybe she just didn't like talking to you.

844
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Or maybe she just didn't like you that much in the first place.

845
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Whatever you say, Ashley.

846
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:27,840
It might have been something more tact-ta- tactful to say.

847
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:34,840
Yeah, he only needs me anyways.

848
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,840
It doesn't matter.

849
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,840
You don't need a freaking girlfriend.

850
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,840
Whatever.

851
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,840
You pretend to sleep until you really fall asleep again.

852
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,840
Now you've been out for a while.

853
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
Whatever.

854
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,840
You pretend to sleep until you really fall asleep again.

855
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,840
Now you've been out for who knows how long.

856
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,840
You figure you should check on your brother.

857
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,840
A VHS player cannot be eaten.

858
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,840
I wouldn't try to eat- oh!

859
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840
Don't jump!

860
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,840
Don't jump!

861
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Don't jump!

862
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Someone from your apartment is getting hauled into an ambulance.

863
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
Hey, me too!

864
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,840
People are yelling from their windows and balconies.

865
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,840
I need some help too.

866
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
Please, please.

867
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,840
I'm starving.

868
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:34,840
Soon the ambulance leaves in a hurry.

869
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Technically anything can be eaten.

870
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,840
If you're brave enough, anything can be eaten, and anything can be a dildo.

871
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,840
If you're brave enough.

872
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,840
Soon the ambulance leaves in a hurry.

873
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,840
Wee!

874
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,840
Telling me surprise, they actually got that person some help.

875
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
I figured they'd just let her die.

876
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Maybe she did die.

877
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,840
She wasn't moving.

878
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,840
As if they'd have their sirens blaring for a corpse.

879
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Then what do you suppose was her emergency?

880
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
No idea.

881
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Nobody showed up when you fainted.

882
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Well, did you call for anyone?

883
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,840
What do you think, dumbass?

884
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,840
I don't know.

885
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Maybe she went into labor or something.

886
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Yeah, maybe.

887
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,840
I think they'd bring me food if I got pregnant.

888
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,840
No.

889
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Let me finish.

890
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,840
How'd you even get pregnant in here?

891
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Well, we do have that one charming fellow right next door.

892
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,840
Over my dead body.

893
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,840
You're the only one that's supposed to get me pregnant.

894
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,840
He seemed a little off his rocker, so who knows, he might just end you.

895
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,840
Forget this.

896
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,840
Well, excuse the hell out of me for exploring my options here.

897
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
That woman didn't look pregnant anyways.

898
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Whatever, it's just a thought, jackass.

899
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,840
You'd like to go after Andrew and tell him it ain't none of his damn business anyways,

900
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,840
but you're just too exhausted.

901
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:18,840
He was feeling a little jealous, wasn't he?

902
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,840
After sleeping for a few hours, maybe a few days, who knows,

903
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,840
you're fully revitalized and bursting with energy.

904
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Am I?

905
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,840
I don't think I am.

906
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,840
Yeah, if you keep making babies, you'll have infinite food because you can eat the babies.

907
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,840
Oh, you silly lazy bones.

908
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,840
What day is it? How long have you been locked in your apartment now?

909
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,840
Where the hell does Andrew get the energy to make so much noise?

910
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,840
Is he gonna break out?

911
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,840
I'm gonna screw the lock and his attempting to kick the door in.

912
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,840
Or out, depending on your perspective.

913
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,840
How many more times are you gonna try that?

914
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,840
It's clearly borrowed from the other side.

915
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,840
What else am I supposed to do?

916
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,840
If you don't stop banging on the door, I won't bring you any food tonight.

917
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
You won't either way, says you.

918
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,840
The delivery will be here in a matter of hours.

919
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,840
But I guess you don't want anything.

920
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,840
Yeah, that's right.

921
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,840
You better stop banging, banging, banging on that door.

922
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,840
Bounce, bounce, bounce it on my wood.

923
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,840
I'm tired from bouncing on my wood all the time.

924
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,840
You have to wait around nine months, though.

925
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
You're right, you're right.

926
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,840
It's not really an infinite food glitch, is it?

927
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,840
You guys, what do you mean, ay-yo, what?

928
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,840
Do you guys not watch anything on the internet?

929
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
You don't know any memes?

930
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
Could you give me some juice?

931
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,840
What do you mean, some juice?

932
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Some eminade, is that what you mean?

933
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,840
The warden doesn't like hearing the pets squeak at night.

934
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
Are you gay?

935
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
Why are you acting so gay?

936
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Oh, thank you for the three dollars, Anonymous, thank you.

937
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Shut up with my two inch wood!

938
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,840
It's bigger than two inch!

939
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Stop it!

940
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,840
It's gonna feel way bigger than two inch when you're bouncing on it.

941
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Cough, cough, cough.

942
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,840
The man's footsteps fade away.

943
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,840
Do you think they'll really get that delivery today?

944
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Like, I didn't even fuck this up for us, did I?

945
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,840
Unlikely.

946
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,840
Oh, I guess we'll see.

947
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
And see you did!

948
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,840
But absolutely nothing was delivered.

949
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Si.

950
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,840
Talk about something!

951
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,840
I got nothing. Try.

952
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:11,840
Yeah, don't give me any ideas for Patreon food content.

953
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
So, parasites.

954
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,840
It's been a few months, are you feeling anything?

955
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,840
Hunger?

956
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,840
You'd think something would happen to us by now, but I haven't noticed anything.

957
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,840
The nurse never came back either.

958
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Like, don't you want to monitor us?

959
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
Ugh, who cares?

960
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,840
Me, Ashley, I care.

961
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
Well, I don't.

962
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,840
Care, nor care that you care.

963
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,840
I can't believe that two people this hot would not sleep together after months of being trapped.

964
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,840
You've been, you've been normie-pilled, apparently.

965
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,840
Because, um...

966
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Wait, no, not normie-pilled.

967
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Their brother and sister get normie-pilled.

968
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Of course they haven't slept together!

969
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,840
They're normies.

970
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,840
They should, though.

971
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Don't worry, we'll make it happen together.

972
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Aside from starving, it's not so bad here.

973
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,840
Come again?

974
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,840
Aside from starving, I like it here.

975
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,840
Well, I don't.

976
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,840
I want to jump off the balcony.

977
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Ooh, I'll race you.

978
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,840
No, seriously, let's go.

979
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,840
Let's not, though.

980
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,840
I appreciate your eagerness to join me.

981
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Are they normies?

982
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
I don't know, I just started the game, I just got here.

983
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,840
Are they not normies?

984
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,840
After the first month or so, they wouldn't care anymore, right?

985
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,840
Oh my god.

986
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Your brain has been rotted by porn.

987
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,840
Come on, guys, use your coffin sets!

988
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,840
But it's a bit too romantic, so I'll pass.

989
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
Excuse me?

990
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
What, you don't see it?

991
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,840
Just imagine hitting the ground together.

992
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,840
Oh, fuck!

993
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,840
And with such force, our bodies would turn into a pile of gory mush,

994
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,840
never to be separated.

995
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,840
Our remains would get so tangled up,

996
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,840
we'd have to bury us together in the same coffin.

997
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,840
Hot!

998
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
Might as well.

999
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,840
We've been confined together in this coffin of an apartment

1000
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,840
for what feels like an eternity already.

1001
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,840
I'm not jumping off the balcony with you.

1002
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,840
Get your head checked.

1003
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,840
I should get my head checked?

1004
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
He said the line, what line?

1005
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Do you mean how is that hot?

1006
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,840
It's hot.

1007
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
It's hot!

1008
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,840
No wonder your girlfriend dumped you.

1009
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,840
If those are your plans for romance, oh wait, hold on.

1010
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,840
Let me have a- let me get a cough drop.

1011
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,840
He said the title?

1012
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,840
Oh, coffin of an ab-

1013
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,840
The title is the coffin of-

1014
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,840
Oh, is the coffin-

1015
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Is the coffin the apartment?

1016
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,840
Is that the coffin?

1017
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,840
Yeah, being forever- forever un-

1018
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,840
Yeah, forever inseparable from your loving sister wife.

1019
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
It is hot.

1020
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Oh, that makes sense.

1021
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
I don't know, I just got here.

1022
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Okay, that makes sense.

1023
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,840
That makes sense, I think.

1024
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Not romance, I said romantic.

1025
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,840
They're not the same thing.

1026
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Romantic just means something is-

1027
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,840
The neighbor starts blasting his favorite ritual music

1028
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,840
for all to hear.

1029
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,840
Again, I wish he'd just-

1030
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Did it work?

1031
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
You feel like you should check up on that.

1032
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,840
Hello, Sheevee, my adorable sister wife, hello.

1033
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
My mommy wife is here.

1034
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,840
My mommy wife is here.

1035
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,840
Um, okay, let's go check on the neighbor, I guess.

1036
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,840
Hultus, my lord, you've come.

1037
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,840
And you're a little smaller than I imagined.

1038
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,840
I- I love it, it's better than I imagined.

1039
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,840
That's all I meant.

1040
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,840
That's what she said.

1041
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,840
What do you offer, human?

1042
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,840
Oh, um, I don't have much to give right now.

1043
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,840
But if you help me get out of here,

1044
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,840
I can get you anything you wish.

1045
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,840
Is that no good?

1046
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,840
As you wish, human.

1047
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,840
My lord, thank you, thank you.

1048
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,840
Parish.

1049
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,840
What's bro cooking in there?

1050
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,840
I don't know, darkness clouds your vision

1051
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,840
and you can't see what's happening.

1052
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,840
But time your vision returns, the entity has vanished.

1053
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,840
Is he dead?

1054
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,840
On the ground lay the lifeless body of the Hultus.

1055
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
Let's go eat his dead body so that way we can-

1056
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,840
that way we can, you know, live a little longer ourselves.

1057
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,840
Am I already delirious or did you see that, too?

1058
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,840
Not J-

1059
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,840
I gotta be quiet when I say his name.

1060
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,840
Do we, uh, do you want to check up on him?

1061
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Well, at the very least, I want to turn off that CD player.

1062
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,840
That's what you're concerned about.

1063
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,840
I'm not listening to this for the rest of my life, Andrew.

1064
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,840
You make it sound like we're gonna die anyways.

1065
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,840
Oh wait, any day now?

1066
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,840
Well, aren't we?

1067
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
Well, I'm not.

1068
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,840
That's gotta be something.

1069
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
This guy has-

1070
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
There's gotta be something this guy has that we can eat.

1071
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,840
Oh my god, I'm so fucking bad at reading.

1072
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,840
Ooh, Berkeley-

1073
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
Berkeley time.

1074
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,840
Shut up. Let's get in there.

1075
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,840
Let's get in there.

1076
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,840
The doorknob taunts you from the other side of the cloud.

1077
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Break it. Break it.

1078
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,840
Break it.

1079
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,840
I need something to break it with.

1080
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,840
Oh.

1081
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,840
I need something to break it to see if there's any junk we can use to break in.

1082
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,840
Use the ashrite.

1083
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,840
Oh.

1084
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Break it. Break the door.

1085
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Door unlocked.

1086
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Eat his dead body.

1087
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,840
That's a lot of meat, you think to yourself.

1088
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,840
What?

1089
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,840
A lot, apparently.

1090
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,840
Is it still illegal if we didn't kill the guy?

1091
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,840
Is what illegal?

1092
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,840
Well, you know.

1093
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
We can't eat him.

1094
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Isn't that why you were insinuating?

1095
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,840
Nah, I was just making an observation.

1096
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,840
But we can't.

1097
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
If we do eat him, then that's it for us.

1098
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,840
There's no way we wouldn't get caught once they finally let us out.

1099
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,840
But it's not like we killed the guy.

1100
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,840
Yeah, that's gotta be at least 10,000 calories.

1101
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,840
It could last us a pretty good-

1102
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
pretty long amount of time.

1103
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,840
Let's eat his meat.

1104
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,840
Well, I think they should look past it.

1105
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,840
Given that there's nothing else to eat.

1106
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,840
Well, the staff here admit that they didn't give us food though.

1107
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,840
And before that, you're going to tell them-

1108
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,840
Are you gay?

1109
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,840
Why are you acting so gay?

1110
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,840
My old rat, Richard, Spanish is poorly from his cage made to bullying him.

1111
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
Can I get some sisterly emergency to boost his recovery?

1112
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
He's poorly?

1113
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,840
He's poorly?

1114
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,840
He's poorly.

1115
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,840
He's poorly.

1116
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,840
He's poorly.

1117
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,840
He's poorly?

1118
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,840
Cut the bullies' balls off.

1119
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,840
If you have problems with your male rats bullying each other, cut their balls off.

1120
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,840
And then you'll be fine.

1121
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,840
Okay?

1122
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,840
That's my sisterly advice.

1123
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,840
And it's true.

1124
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,840
It works.

1125
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,840
Doctors don't want you to know this one life hack

1126
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,840
to stop bullying in rats.

1127
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Yeah, it works.

1128
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,840
There you go.

1129
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,840
I'm not talking from experience

1130
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,840
because I've never owned male rats

1131
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,840
because I don't like their balls.

1132
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
And I'm not going to pay

1133
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,840
to get every single rat I owned

1134
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,840
balls cut off.

1135
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,840
So that's why I stick to girls.

1136
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
Worked on my brother too.

1137
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840
I should try it on you,

1138
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,840
see if it works on you

1139
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,840
to make you less aggressive.

1140
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,840
And before that, you're going to tell them

1141
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,840
a demon killed him, really?

1142
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,840
That'll fly?

1143
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,840
Listen, you're overthinking the hell out of this.

1144
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,840
Are we doing this or not?

1145
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
Andrew, I'm expecting an answer.

1146
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,840
Wait, are they actually genuinely, like,

1147
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
going to kill him?

1148
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,840
Let me make that clear.

1149
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,840
I'm not a rat.

1150
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,840
You don't have to be a rat for me to cut your balls off.

1151
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,840
We're not aggressive.

1152
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,840
You can be.

1153
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,840
You haven't seen my marshmallows, but I have.

1154
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,840
Some of you are.

1155
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,840
Some of you need your balls cut off.

1156
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Yeah.

1157
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Alright then, let's find something to butcher him with.

1158
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,840
Oh god.

1159
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Are we actually doing this right now?

1160
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,840
It should be in the kitchen. There's a knife right there, isn't there?

1161
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,840
Isn't this a knife?

1162
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,840
A cleaver.

1163
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,840
The average human corpse

1164
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,840
contains around

1165
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,840
125,000 calories.

1166
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,840
That'll last us a good amount of time.

1167
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,840
She doesn't like the marrows it's in over.

1168
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,840
I love them. Don't even worry about it.

1169
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,840
I love them.

1170
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,840
I'm just jorkin'.

1171
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,840
So you get the arms, I'll handle the legs.

1172
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,840
Wait, we're actually doing it?

1173
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,840
Are we actually doing it?

1174
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,840
Okay, I'll get the left one.

1175
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,840
What the fuck?

1176
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,840
Wait, it's just the illusion of choice.

1177
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,840
It doesn't matter which arm we cut off first.

1178
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,840
We can't carry him out in the open like this.

1179
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,840
Just be quiet about it.

1180
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,840
No, can you go get plastic bags or something?

1181
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
I'll take care of the rest in the meanwhile,

1182
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,840
but I'm counting on you, Andy.

1183
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,840
Don't call me that.

1184
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,840
Hand him the cleaver.

1185
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,840
I guess we're going to get plastic bags

1186
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,840
to put his dead body in.

1187
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,840
Yeah, dinner's served!

1188
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,840
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

1189
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,840
It's our neighbor,

1190
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,840
Chaky.

1191
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,840
I've been saying his name really loudly,

1192
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,840
but he could probably hear me.

1193
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,840
Well, I guess he's dead in the game, but yeah.

1194
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,840
Where's the bags?

1195
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,840
Wait, where's the bags?

1196
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,840
They were in the bathroom, right?

1197
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,840
Girl dinner!

1198
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,840
Girl dinner! Girl dinner!

1199
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,840
It's time for girl dinner,

1200
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,840
and I guess boy dinner since

1201
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Andy's here too.

1202
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,840
Here you go.

1203
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Oh, you got his legs. Good job.

1204
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,840
Oh, fuck.

1205
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,840
Oh, my God.

1206
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,840
This is so fucked up.

1207
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,840
A small problem presents itself.

1208
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,840
The plastic bags aren't big enough

1209
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,840
to fit the whole torso.

1210
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,840
Time to cut his head off, too.

1211
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
Ahem.

1212
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,840
This is actually

1213
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,840
my first time cutting up a dead body,

1214
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,840
believe it or not, yep.

1215
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,840
I don't think we can cut through the spine.

1216
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,840
Just fold him over.

1217
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,840
I don't think that's going to work.

1218
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,840
Watch and learn!

1219
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,840
You see? Oh, this is so fucked up.

1220
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,840
You see?

1221
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,840
If anyone happens to be looking out

1222
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,840
their window, it'll be a disaster.

1223
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,840
Maybe if I use two bags?

1224
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,840
Listen, this isn't going to...

1225
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,840
Ta-da!

1226
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
Good God, no.

1227
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,840
Don't make me laugh at this.

1228
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,840
I don't have the power to make you do anything, Andrew.

1229
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,840
All right, all right, enough.

1230
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,840
Gather the limbs up and go.

1231
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,840
There should be plenty room

1232
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,840
for them in our freezer.

1233
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,840
I'll stuff the torso

1234
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,840
and head in his freezer for now.

1235
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,840
Big brain.

1236
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,840
I know such cute sibling bonds.

1237
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,840
Oh my God.

1238
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,840
What a cute little date for them.

1239
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,840
I'll go cook...

1240
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,840
I'll go cook us something while you're at it.

1241
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,840
Yeah, you'll cook quite the something.

1242
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Okay.

1243
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,840
First time cutting up a dead body,

1244
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,840
so the others were alive.

1245
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,840
Yep, the others were alive while I cut them up

1246
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,840
and they screamed very loudly.

1247
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,840
How do I cook?

1248
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,840
How do I cook?

1249
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
Let me cook.

1250
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,840
What's that noise? Is he still cutting him up?

1251
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,840
Can I turn chewing?

1252
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,840
You like the sound of that?

1253
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,840
How am I supposed to...

1254
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,840
Am I supposed to cook him in his own house?

1255
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,840
That's kind of disrespectful, isn't it?

1256
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,840
To the dead?

1257
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,840
To cut him up

1258
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,840
and then cook him in his own house?

1259
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
Oh, am I supposed to put him in the freezer?

1260
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,840
Pass me the candy? You want it?

1261
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,840
Open your mouth, I'll give it to you.

1262
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,840
Ready?

1263
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,840
I'll pass it from my mouth to yours.

1264
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,840
Should I put him in the freezer?

1265
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,840
Oh, there we go.

1266
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,840
Which one do I want to eat?

1267
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,840
Okay, here you go.

1268
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,840
Make sure you suck on it really well, okay?

1269
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,840
Go for the leg?

1270
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,840
Left leg.

1271
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,840
Okay, leg, leg, leg.

1272
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Okay.

1273
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,840
All right, time to cook.

1274
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,840
What are we going to make?

1275
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,840
You fry some meat.

1276
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,840
Dinner is ready.

1277
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,840
Right, so what are we having here?

1278
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,840
Pure deliciousness is what.

1279
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,840
Eat up.

1280
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,840
You first. Munch, munch.

1281
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,840
Huh? What?

1282
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,840
Oh, you already... okay.

1283
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,840
Eat, Andrew. You will not waste this.

1284
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,840
Um, right.

1285
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,840
Andrew takes a bite of your cookie.

1286
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,840
I don't think he likes it.

1287
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,840
He begins retching.

1288
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,840
Oh my god, she's just like me.

1289
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,840
She can't cook.

1290
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,840
No kiss to pass it?

1291
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
I already passed it to you.

1292
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,840
Maybe if I eat another one, I'll give you a kiss to pass it on.

1293
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,840
Thigh is the best part?

1294
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
That's true. But this is a man.

1295
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,840
I like girls thighs more.

1296
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Yeah, do what your sister says.

1297
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,840
Man, these fucking pictures.

1298
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,840
Oh my god.

1299
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
Swallow.

1300
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,840
All of it.

1301
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,840
Gold.

1302
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,840
Why is there so much sexual tension right now?

1303
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
Mm-mm, delicious.

1304
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,840
Not the first time she said that to him.

1305
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,840
Well, how is it?

1306
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,840
It's...

1307
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,840
God, I hate picky eaters.

1308
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Aw, fuck, I'm a picky eater.

1309
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,840
I made this with love.

1310
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,840
So you're not leaving the table before you lick the plate clean.

1311
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,840
Quit your nagging woman.

1312
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,840
Or just like a couple.

1313
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,840
Then quit your gagging, you big baby.

1314
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,840
Now call him a good boy?

1315
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,840
Good boy.

1316
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,840
I'll eat it, alright? Just give me a minute.

1317
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, eat it.

1318
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,840
Under your watchful eye, he slowly finishes his plate.

1319
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,840
Good boy, I am so proud.

1320
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,840
Just fuck off, Ashley.

1321
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,840
What an odd way to say thank you.

1322
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,840
Yeah, yeah, thanks a bunch.

1323
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,840
I'll clear the table, so leave me alone.

1324
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,840
God, he's so emo.

1325
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,840
We've got a very limited set of spaces left.

1326
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,840
So what do you think I should try next?

1327
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,840
Like, I don't know, maybe coriander?

1328
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,840
Oh my God, I have such a funny story for that!

1329
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,840
Okay, wait, actually pause. I want to tell you a funny story.

1330
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,840
Let me tell you this story.

1331
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,840
Okay, no, I want to be up close.

1332
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,840
I want to be up close and personal for this.

1333
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,840
Let me make my model go in front of chat.

1334
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,840
Okay, so when I was in high school,

1335
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,840
I went to a sleepover with my friends.

1336
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,840
And we did that one.

1337
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,840
My friend had one of those microphones

1338
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,840
with the headphones plugged into them,

1339
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
and it's supposed to be that challenge

1340
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,840
where you're supposed to say a paragraph,

1341
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,840
and you can hear yourself talking, but it's delayed.

1342
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,840
So the challenge is like, you know,

1343
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,840
boop, you booping me?

1344
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,840
What are you booping me for?

1345
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,840
But the challenge is basically talk clearly, and that's it.

1346
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,840
You just, whenever you hear the other person talk with it,

1347
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,840
it's just funny, that's all.

1348
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,840
Boop my snoop.

1349
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,840
Boop me.

1350
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,840
I'm ready for the boop.

1351
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
Okay, um, anyways.

1352
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,840
So we were taking turns to, you know,

1353
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,840
do the challenge of like speaking clearly with a delayed,

1354
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,840
what's it called, a delayed audio of our voices.

1355
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,840
I know I'm explaining it badly,

1356
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,840
but basically when it was my turn,

1357
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,840
I decided to do a copy pasta.

1358
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,840
I decided to say a copy pasta.

1359
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,840
And the copy pasta was the one of the guy

1360
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,840
who was pretending to sell weed to his school,

1361
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,840
like to his classmates at school,

1362
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,840
but in reality he was just selling them oregano.

1363
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,840
And I had never seen the word oregano before.

1364
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,840
So when it was my turn to read my copy pasta,

1365
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,840
I said oregano the entire time,

1366
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,840
and I just pronounced it oregano.

1367
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,840
The whole time they didn't know I was selling them oregano.

1368
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,840
Oh sorry, I turned off the desktop audio

1369
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,840
so you could hear me talk.

1370
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,840
Thank you for the tip discomancer.

1371
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,840
Oregano.

1372
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
And now I still have the video of me,

1373
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
of me, because they recorded me

1374
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,840
and I still have the video of me just saying

1375
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,840
and I was selling them,

1376
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,840
I was packaging oregano

1377
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,840
and selling it to my classmates.

1378
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,840
Do you want me to post a copy pasta for you to read?

1379
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
Surely it won't be something bad.

1380
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,840
If it's not something bad, go ahead.

1381
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,840
How do you say munic?

1382
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,840
Munich?

1383
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
Munich?

1384
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,840
I don't know.

1385
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,840
That's the British...

1386
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,840
Wait, oregano is actually pronounced oregano

1387
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,840
in British terms?

1388
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
Are you gay?

1389
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,840
Why are you acting so gay?

1390
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,840
Oregano.

1391
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
Yeah, I know it's oregano.

1392
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,840
But now I sometimes just say oregano

1393
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,840
to make people mad because I think it's funny.

1394
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,840
She says it like,

1395
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,840
how are you supposed to say it?

1396
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,840
Leak the audio.

1397
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,840
Yeah, no.

1398
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,840
No.

1399
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,840
Anyways, coriander?

1400
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,840
Alright, I'll try some of that tomorrow.

1401
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,840
I'm off to bed now, goodnight.

1402
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
Night night.

1403
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,840
Okay.

1404
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,840
Where's the bedroom?

1405
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,840
What is that sound alert?

1406
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,840
It's just my sound alert.

1407
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,840
What do you mean?

1408
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,840
It's my sound alert.

1409
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,840
How do I sleep?

1410
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,840
Is this not my...

1411
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Oh, these are the parents' bedroom.

1412
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,840
Oh, sorry, that's the parents' bedroom.

1413
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
You were correct, just British.

1414
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
Wow, that's crazy.

1415
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,840
I was British all along

1416
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,840
and I didn't even know it.

1417
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,840
Said she likes you.

1418
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,840
Who?

1419
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
My friend from school.

1420
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
Or at least I thought she was a friend.

1421
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,840
So are you gonna...

1422
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,840
Are you gonna be her boyfriend?

1423
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,840
Gross?

1424
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,840
No.

1425
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,840
I should teach her a lesson.

1426
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,840
Oh my god.

1427
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
You're my brother, mine.

1428
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,840
I'll make her think twice

1429
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,840
before stealing from another woman.

1430
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,840
Oh my god.

1431
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,840
Oh yeah, you're a girl too.

1432
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,840
What's that supposed to mean?

1433
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,840
Somehow you don't count as a lady in my mind.

1434
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,840
Or as a person for that matter.

1435
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,840
Screw you.

1436
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,840
I am the most personous lady in the world.

1437
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,840
So anyways,

1438
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,840
I'm gonna take her to that old warehouse

1439
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,840
and lock her in one of the crates.

1440
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,840
Yeah, yeah.

1441
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,840
Seriously.

1442
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,840
Mom gave me some money

1443
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,840
to go buy groceries.

1444
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,840
Are you coming with?

1445
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,840
Focus, Andy.

1446
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,840
Let's leave her sitting there all night.

1447
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,840
That'll show her.

1448
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,840
Let's not.

1449
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
You should go ask her to hang out.

1450
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,840
She won't say no then.

1451
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,840
Lately, I don't want to.

1452
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,840
Just go over and ask her to come with you.

1453
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,840
I feel like you almost said this exactly.

1454
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,840
I've never said that before.

1455
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,840
But I'm saying it now.

1456
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,840
Take her to the warehouse

1457
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,840
and we'll see what happens.

1458
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,840
Come on.

1459
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,840
Mom said you'd help me with anything.

1460
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,840
I thought she's your friend.

1461
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
Well, I thought so too.

1462
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,840
And she can be my friend again afterwards.

1463
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,840
She just needs a reminder

1464
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,840
of how to do it properly.

1465
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,840
Well, get in trouble.

1466
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,840
I'll only let her out

1467
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,840
when she promises not to tell on us.

1468
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,840
She's been getting tips from Mercy.

1469
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,840
I'll let you in on a little secret,

1470
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,840
but I don't need tips from Mercy.

1471
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,840
It's all coming from me.

1472
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
Sai.

1473
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,840
Do it, Andy.

1474
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,840
I guess.

1475
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Hooray! You're the best!

1476
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
Today's episode is titled

1477
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,840
Andy and Lately and the Bitch in a Box.

1478
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,840
One day, you'll be in a bitch in a box

1479
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,840
and your friends will take turns

1480
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,840
pissing on the ground above.

1481
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,840
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1482
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,840
What do I do about these hussies around you?

1483
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,840
Where do you learn these words?

1484
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,840
The bitch is you.

1485
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,840
I'll take you out to play

1486
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
and then when I'm done,

1487
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,840
it's back into the box with you.

1488
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,840
I really ought to kick your ass

1489
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,840
one of these days.

1490
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,840
Huh?

1491
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,840
Yeah, who do you think taught Mercy?

1492
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,840
What?

1493
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,840
What is taking him?

1494
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,840
What is taking him?

1495
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,840
What?

1496
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,840
He wouldn't have forgotten our plans, would he?

1497
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,840
Grr.

1498
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,840
Is he coming?

1499
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,840
Finally!

1500
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:09,840
Huh?

1501
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,840
What are you doing here?

1502
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,840
Surprise!

1503
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
I want to hang out too.

1504
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,840
Oh.

1505
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,840
I mean, I guess that's fine.

1506
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,840
Say, did you tell your mommy you're here?

1507
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,840
No, why?

1508
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,840
Just wondering.

1509
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,840
I mean, I'm surprised she let you come

1510
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,840
hang out with a boy.

1511
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,840
No way, she thinks I went to study with Julia.

1512
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,840
But why are you here, Ashley?

1513
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,840
Divine intervention.

1514
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,840
What's that even mean?

1515
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,840
It means she's full of crap, don't listen.

1516
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,840
So, are we going inside or what?

1517
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,840
Is that allowed?

1518
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,840
These flags be crimson?

1519
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
Ignore them.

1520
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,840
Just put on some rose-tinted glasses, okay?

1521
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,840
They're not real.

1522
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,840
You're being a little crazy right now.

1523
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,840
I love it.

1524
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
Let's find a way in right now.

1525
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,840
Where are we going in a box?

1526
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,840
Box?

1527
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,840
Get in the box?

1528
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
Get in the box, bitch.

1529
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
Get in the box.

1530
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,840
Wait, I'm confused.

1531
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,840
Oh, shit.

1532
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,840
Are we actually going to nail her into a box?

1533
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,840
The drop off on the other side of the window is too high.

1534
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,840
Though I wouldn't mind convincing Blanc-

1535
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,840
Blanc- Blanc.

1536
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,840
Let me take another cough drop.

1537
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,840
Yeah, luckily you're colorblind.

1538
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,840
Did you know it's more common for dudes to be colorblind?

1539
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,840
Isn't that so lucky for me?

1540
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,840
We're just Lillie, Leigh, Ann, and Amy Beacons.

1541
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,840
We are one.

1542
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,840
There is no ending in beginning to us because we are one and the same.

1543
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,840
I wouldn't mind convincing Blanc to jump anyways.

1544
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
To maybe twist her ankle.

1545
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,840
Maybe break her neck.

1546
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,840
Is something wrong?

1547
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
Nah, but we can't go in this way.

1548
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,840
Why did they nail this metal sheet thing on the wall?

1549
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,840
Are you gay?

1550
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
Why are you acting so gay?

1551
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
They're not red flags.

1552
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,840
They're fun facts.

1553
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,840
They're just fun facts.

1554
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,840
50 fun facts you didn't know about, Amy,

1555
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,840
but you're about to learn right now in this stream.

1556
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,840
What's Ouroboros?

1557
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,840
Is that, that sounds familiar.

1558
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,840
What's Ouroboros?

1559
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,840
Ouroboros?

1560
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,840
Looks like there's a hole behind it.

1561
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,840
Perfect.

1562
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,840
Tear it open.

1563
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,840
What?

1564
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,840
I can't do that.

1565
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,840
It's okay.

1566
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,840
I won't tell anyone.

1567
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,840
As in, I literally can't do it dumbass.

1568
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,840
Not without some tools at least.

1569
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,840
Huh.

1570
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,840
Even though it's this flimsy?

1571
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,840
Yes.

1572
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,840
Bro, what a weak little bitch boy.

1573
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,840
I like smart guys over beefy ones.

1574
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
Shut up, bitch!

1575
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
That's my man!

1576
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,840
Who asked?

1577
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,840
Wait, so we need more tools?

1578
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,840
What about this thing?

1579
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,840
A steel mallet.

1580
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,840
I can't really think of a way a mallet

1581
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,840
would be useful to us in this situation.

1582
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,840
I sure can.

1583
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,840
Ouroborialis?

1584
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,840
Is that what Ouroboros means?

1585
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,840
Oh, snake eating its own tail.

1586
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,840
That's what it means?

1587
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
Mmm.

1588
01:20:58,840 --> 01:20:59,840
Mmm, mmm.

1589
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,840
Yes, yes.

1590
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,840
Yes, the Ouroboros of Emi and Lele.

1591
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,840
Yeah, that's what we are.

1592
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,840
Does it help us get in the warehouse?

1593
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,840
Oh my god.

1594
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,840
Wait, I have to fart.

1595
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,840
Hold on, hold on, I have to fart.

1596
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,840
Fuck.

1597
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
God damn it.

1598
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,840
It's not coming out.

1599
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
My butthole got shy.

1600
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,840
Damn it.

1601
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,840
I literally stood up from my chair

1602
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,840
and turned around so I could face them like

1603
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,840
and then I didn't want to come out.

1604
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,840
God damn it.

1605
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
I'm sorry, boys.

1606
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,840
Next time, we'll get them next time.

1607
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,840
Right in my face, do it.

1608
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,840
I tried, I wouldn't come out.

1609
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,840
I can't even, I can't even do it.

1610
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,840
I can't even do it.

1611
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,840
It got shy, I'm sorry.

1612
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,840
Okay, let's continue.

1613
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,840
Okay.

1614
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,840
Why is my chat frozen on my phone?

1615
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,840
Am I going to be the first farter?

1616
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,840
I was not, I was not the first farter.

1617
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,840
Okay, here we go.

1618
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,840
Oh, Lay Lay, I don't even want to know

1619
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,840
what you had in mind.

1620
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,840
What are you guys talking about?

1621
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,840
It's nothing.

1622
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,840
Let's keep looking.

1623
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,840
The thing.

1624
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,840
You use the back of the hammer to pull out the nails.

1625
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,840
Cough, wow, it sure is cough cough kind of dusty in here.

1626
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,840
First a fart first to win, what are we winning?

1627
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,840
There needs to be a prize.

1628
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,840
You gotta, you gotta kind of, you know.

1629
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,840
I can't think of the word.

1630
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,840
I'm trying to think of the word I want.

1631
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,840
A kiss is a prize?

1632
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,840
Okay, okay, I can compete for a kiss.

1633
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
The sharp ender.

1634
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,840
Makes me wonder about my, oh, makes me worry about my asthma.

1635
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
It's fine, it's fine.

1636
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
Oh, I know, how about some hide and seek?

1637
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,840
Ugh, you're such a kid.

1638
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,840
Huh?

1639
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,840
Annie wants to play too.

1640
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,840
You do?

1641
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,840
What?

1642
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,840
Oh yeah, sure.

1643
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,840
See?

1644
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,840
Well, I mean, it's fun every once in a while.

1645
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,840
Oh my god, I hate her.

1646
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,840
You totally want to, you totally wanted to play too, you child.

1647
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,840
Albeit, I'm gonna count to ten.

1648
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,840
Hundred, count to a hundred at least.

1649
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,840
Okay.

1650
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,840
One, two, alright, let's find a good box to shove in.

1651
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,840
Don't tell her where that kiss is gonna be.

1652
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,840
What?

1653
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,840
You wouldn't kiss anywhere weird, right?

1654
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
It's gonna be on the mouth, of course.

1655
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,840
Okay.

1656
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,840
You still want to do that?

1657
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,840
Of course.

1658
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
She said no one knows she's here.

1659
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,840
It's perfect.

1660
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,840
Lele, you promised.

1661
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,840
Now hurry up, before she's done counting.

1662
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:34,840
Where is she?

1663
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:35,840
Where's the box?

1664
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,840
Where is she?

1665
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,840
How do I shove her in the box?

1666
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,840
Put her in the box.

1667
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,840
This container's already full.

1668
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,840
There's no empty boxes.

1669
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,840
Where do I put her?

1670
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,840
There's no empty boxes.

1671
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,840
Ah.

1672
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,840
Oh, now this'll do.

1673
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,840
There isn't any lock on it, though.

1674
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,840
Well, we don't have it.

1675
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
We don't actually have...

1676
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,840
Ah!

1677
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,840
Well, we don't actually want to lock her in.

1678
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,840
You get forehead kisses at best?

1679
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
Why?

1680
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,840
Why?

1681
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,840
Why?

1682
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,840
Dummy kisses work too.

1683
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,840
Yeah, on the lips.

1684
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,840
I won't accept anything less than on the lips.

1685
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,840
We don't have...

1686
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,840
We don't...

1687
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,840
Fuck, I can't fucking read.

1688
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,840
We don't actually want to lock her in.

1689
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,840
The hell we don't...

1690
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,840
Place a stick or something between the rings.

1691
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,840
That'll keep it closed.

1692
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,840
Won't the stick just break?

1693
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,840
No, well, if she's hunched inside,

1694
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,840
I doubt she'd have leverage to...

1695
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,840
Ready or not, here I come!

1696
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,840
Oh, crap, she counts too fast.

1697
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,840
It wasn't that fast, really.

1698
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,840
Ahaha, let's hide.

1699
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,840
Okay.

1700
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,840
Wait, where do I hide?

1701
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,840
Where do I hide?

1702
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,840
In the box, right?

1703
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,840
Fuck.

1704
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,840
Where do I hide?

1705
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,840
Here?

1706
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,840
Tell me where to hide!

1707
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,840
Ah!

1708
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,840
Oh wait, I thought I saw her walk in.

1709
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,840
Where do I hide?

1710
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:24,840
Where do I hide?

1711
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,840
Where do I hide?

1712
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:26,840
Top right.

1713
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,840
Here?

1714
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,840
Where do we get a stick anyways?

1715
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,840
Andy picks up whatever wooden debris is at his feet.

1716
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,840
I guess this'll do.

1717
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,840
Well...

1718
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:47,840
What do you think?

1719
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,840
Is she pretty?

1720
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,840
A stick?

1721
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,840
No, who do you think, dumbass?

1722
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,840
Ah, she's fine, I guess.

1723
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,840
He's supposed to say no.

1724
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:05,840
Found you!

1725
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:07,840
Both of you.

1726
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,840
Who hides in the same spot, idiots?

1727
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,840
SHUT UP, BITCH!

1728
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,840
It was my spot first.

1729
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,840
Then you're it.

1730
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,840
Far through the crack in the box?

1731
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,840
Yeah, I'm prettier.

1732
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,840
Yes, yes, I'll go count.

1733
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,840
Andy goes to count outside.

1734
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,840
My hiding spots are the best.

1735
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,840
I know a really good one.

1736
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,840
Come take a look!

1737
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,840
Um, okay.

1738
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,840
Let's shove her in this fuckin' box.

1739
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:45,840
Go hide in there.

1740
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,840
I think you'll fit in here?

1741
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,840
Seems like a bad idea.

1742
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,840
It's coming, it's coming!

1743
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,840
It was a silent fart, damn it.

1744
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,840
Okay.

1745
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,840
Seems like a bad idea.

1746
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,840
Have so!

1747
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,840
I'm gonna get my clothes dirty.

1748
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
My mom does...

1749
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,840
Oh wait, what?

1750
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,840
I didn't see the previous message.

1751
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,840
She'll get mad if I...

1752
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,840
HUNDRED!

1753
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,840
Oh shoot, he's coming, hurry, hurry!

1754
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,840
I'm getting a phone call right now.

1755
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:14,840
Decline.

1756
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,840
Leave me alone.

1757
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,840
Let me sniff.

1758
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,840
There is nothing to sniff.

1759
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:21,840
It doesn't even smell.

1760
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,840
I don't smell anything.

1761
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,840
First confirmed fart on stream?

1762
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,840
If you believe me, yeah.

1763
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,840
Shut up about vibrations!

1764
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,840
It's not the kind of vibrations you think it is!

1765
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,840
It's not the kind of vibrations you think it is!

1766
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,840
It was my phone!

1767
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,840
No, I'm not gonna answer it.

1768
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,840
It said it was a survey.

1769
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,840
Er, uh, okay.

1770
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,840
Hey silly, your friend hops inside the crate.

1771
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,840
Yup!

1772
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:55,840
Huh? What was that?

1773
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,840
I got you now!

1774
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,840
Blank is too weak to throw you off the lid.

1775
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,840
Cough, this isn't funny, Ashley.

1776
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,840
She's gonna suffocate, isn't she?

1777
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,840
Hello, Amy, hello.

1778
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,840
She's gonna suffocate.

1779
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,840
That magic wand of yours?

1780
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,840
I haven't used that yet.

1781
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,840
I will update you when I do use it though.

1782
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:22,840
I will.

1783
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,840
But no, it was just my phone.

1784
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,840
Get your mind out of the gutter.

1785
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,840
There you are, Andy, you slowpoke.

1786
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,840
Hurry up, she's putting up a fight.

1787
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:33,840
Cough, I can't breathe!

1788
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,840
She's actually gonna suffocate!

1789
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,840
She alright?

1790
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,840
Cough, Cough, please, I-

1791
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
Shut up already, you drama queen.

1792
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:42,840
Let her out, Lele.

1793
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,840
She's just pretending.

1794
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,840
No one's ever died from some dust.

1795
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:49,840
Just let her out.

1796
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,840
What? You believe her over me?

1797
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:57,840
It's not really about whether I believe her or not.

1798
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,840
Fine, you let her out then.

1799
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,840
Who cares about me anyways?

1800
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,840
Cough, Cough.

1801
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:05,840
Everyone likes her better,

1802
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,840
but you like her better too.

1803
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:08,840
But everyone does.

1804
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,840
I already know.

1805
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,840
Cough, Cough, Cough.

1806
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,840
That's fiction, that's fiction.

1807
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,840
That's f-

1808
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:20,840
That's f-

1809
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:21,840
A-

1810
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,840
X-

1811
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:24,840
A-

1812
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,840
Asphyxiation, siblings, confinement, betrayal.

1813
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:29,840
Nice tags.

1814
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,840
I bet you-

1815
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,840
I bet you'd rather have a girlfriend

1816
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,840
than spend time with me, of course you would.

1817
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
Oh, come on, I already told you I don't want.

1818
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,840
And,

1819
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:41,840
bet,

1820
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:42,840
sniff,

1821
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,840
I should say it.

1822
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
I should voice act for hairlines, at least.

1823
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,840
And I bet,

1824
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,840
but you only want to hang out with me

1825
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,840
because mom told you to.

1826
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,840
Well, that's-

1827
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,840
I mean, maybe she did, but-

1828
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:57,840
It's not fair.

1829
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,840
Cough, Cough, Cough.

1830
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
Why does everyone like her better?

1831
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,840
I'm loud and weird and annoying,

1832
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,840
no one likes me at all.

1833
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,840
I like you better, Lele.

1834
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:09,840
Prove it,

1835
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,840
liar.

1836
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,840
Sigh.

1837
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:14,840
I knew it.

1838
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,840
I knew it.

1839
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,840
Maybe you'd have more friends if you weren't always so-

1840
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,840
Not even my own brother picks me over her!

1841
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,840
I knew it already.

1842
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:25,840
Did I not just say,

1843
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:26,840
la, la, la,

1844
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,840
talk sure is cheap.

1845
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:29,840
God damn it.

1846
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:32,840
Cough, Cough.

1847
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,840
Crazy ass castling.

1848
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,840
I mean, she's good at it,

1849
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,840
she's good at what she does.

1850
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,840
Cough, Cough.

1851
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,840
Cough, Cough.

1852
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:44,840
Cough, Cough.

1853
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,840
Ash.

1854
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,840
There.

1855
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,840
Are you happy now?

1856
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,840
Cough, Cough.

1857
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,840
Yes.

1858
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,840
Just until morning, okay?

1859
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
Yes, yes, you're the best.

1860
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,840
I like you the best, Andy.

1861
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:02,840
You hear that, Blank?

1862
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,840
You get to stay there until morning.

1863
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,840
No, please.

1864
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:07,840
Cough, Cough.

1865
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,840
Ashley.

1866
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,840
Yeah, that girl's gonna fucking die.

1867
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,840
I mean, she kind of deserves it,

1868
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,840
she was annoying.

1869
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,840
Ashley, wait, don't-

1870
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,840
Cough, Cough.

1871
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,840
Go.

1872
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:19,840
Ashley, please.

1873
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,840
Ashley!

1874
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,840
Ashley?

1875
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,840
Will you wait?

1876
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:25,840
I am now.

1877
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,840
If you see my tongue sticking out,

1878
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,840
it's because I'm kind of sticking out my tongue.

1879
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,840
Cough, Cough.

1880
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,840
Maybe she shouldn't have tried to seduce her big brother.

1881
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,840
Well, maybe that bitch shouldn't have been such a bitch,

1882
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,840
and then she wouldn't die.

1883
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:45,840
Um, okay.

1884
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,840
What is it?

1885
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,840
Nothing, it's just-

1886
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,840
God, what the fuck did we do?

1887
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:50,840
You still on about dinner?

1888
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:51,840
Fine, just starve then.

1889
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,840
More for me.

1890
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,840
How are you like this?

1891
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,840
How are you-

1892
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,840
Are you out of your mind?

1893
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,840
Listen, I didn't kill the guy,

1894
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,840
so I didn't do anything wrong.

1895
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:01,840
You mutil-

1896
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,840
You mutil-

1897
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:03,840
You mutil-

1898
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:04,840
You mutil-

1899
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,840
You mutilated and ate a corpse, too!

1900
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,840
What else were we supposed to do?

1901
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,840
Call the warden and let him know he died?

1902
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,840
Ashley is giving more of a sociopath than a psychopath?

1903
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:28,840
She's a- what's it called?

1904
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,840
S-

1905
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:33,840
She's a psychosis.

1906
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,840
That's what she's-

1907
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,840
That's what she is.

1908
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,840
Uh, yes.

1909
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:40,840
Um, sir, we-

1910
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:41,840
He summoned a demon and then died.

1911
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,840
I swear we didn't do it.

1912
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,840
Yeah.

1913
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,840
I-

1914
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,840
We wouldn't have had to admit we were there.

1915
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,840
We couldn't-

1916
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,840
We could've just told him to go check on that guy.

1917
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,840
Andrew, what the hell?

1918
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:53,840
What?

1919
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,840
What the hell?

1920
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,840
Didn't we both agree on this?

1921
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,840
I could've sworn it was your suggestion in the first place.

1922
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,840
She's so good at cast lighting!

1923
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,840
Yeah, what a girl, boss.

1924
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,840
I was hungry-

1925
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,840
I was too hungry to think straight, okay?

1926
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,840
Now that's some bullshit.

1927
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,840
Fine, let's assume it was so.

1928
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:14,840
What-

1929
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,840
What do you want me to do about it?

1930
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:17,840
I-

1931
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
Woosh woosh, there goes my magic wand.

1932
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:22,840
There.

1933
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:23,840
I've absolved you of your sins.

1934
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,840
You never took a bite now.

1935
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,840
You're welcome.

1936
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:31,840
Oh gee, thanks.

1937
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,840
We'll see how-

1938
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,840
We'll see how that holds in.

1939
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,840
I'm sorry that I'm so dyslexic today.

1940
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,840
I don't actually have dyslexia, surprisingly.

1941
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,840
We'll see how that holds in the face of the law.

1942
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,840
Listen, who cares?

1943
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,840
Ugh!

1944
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,840
Isn't this, like, some extreme circumstances stuff?

1945
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,840
Like, can we be excused?

1946
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,840
It's the water company's fault.

1947
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,840
First they lock us in for months, and then we don't-

1948
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,840
And then they won't even feed us.

1949
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,840
And does Kevin fever a real thing?

1950
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:05,840
Maybe we can plead insanity.

1951
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:07,840
I don't know, Ashley.

1952
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,840
Sounded out?

1953
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,840
Thank you for being so patient.

1954
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,840
She's an empath.

1955
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,840
They're there.

1956
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,840
You know what?

1957
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,840
I couldn't get his head off.

1958
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,840
Huh?

1959
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,840
Like, he didn't fit in the freezer properly.

1960
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,840
So I needed to chop his head off, but I couldn't cut it.

1961
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,840
His spine was too-

1962
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,840
Anyway, I kind of just-

1963
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,840
Uh, like, kept cutting around and then pulled it off.

1964
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,840
Like some plant.

1965
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,840
I don't know.

1966
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,840
I just keep thinking about it.

1967
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,840
Ugh, I can't fucking sleep, Ashley.

1968
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,840
It's-

1969
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,840
Come here.

1970
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,840
This is a little-

1971
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,840
Oh my, they're sleeping in the same bed together?

1972
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,840
Aw, thank you for all the encouragement.

1973
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,840
I don't know what's wrong with you.

1974
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,840
How are you so unbothered?

1975
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:19,840
Moisturized, showered, um, cleansed, unbothered.

1976
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,840
Sitting on my couch.

1977
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,840
Reading incest.

1978
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,840
I don't know, I compartmentalize.

1979
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,840
Kind of like we compartmentalize that guy into different freezers.

1980
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,840
Ashley!

1981
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:35,840
Andrew, what is it, Andrew?

1982
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:38,840
Oh my god!

1983
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,840
Andrew!

1984
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,840
Andrew.

1985
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:43,840
Andy.

1986
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,840
I-

1987
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
I told you to stop calling me that.

1988
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,840
We're not kids anymore.

1989
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,840
Then why are you crying like such a baby?

1990
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,840
Now kiss.

1991
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,840
She's a woman, Andy. Consequences are ununtered.

1992
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,840
I'm not crying.

1993
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,840
Mommy, the big bad me did the evil thing.

1994
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,840
You shut your own mouth.

1995
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,840
Make me a little-

1996
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,840
I was gonna say make me without actually reading it.

1997
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,840
Make me a little bitch.

1998
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:24,840
Forget this.

1999
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,840
Why are they sort of goals though?

2000
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:29,840
I know!

2001
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,840
Hey Andy, remember when we used to go on adventures?

2002
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,840
What?

2003
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,840
Andy and Lay Lay's quest for something or another.

2004
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,840
Something or another, remember?

2005
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,840
Yeah, they have a second bed and they don't use it.

2006
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,840
You're already in character.

2007
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,840
I'm basically covering up her entire side, so, you know.

2008
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,840
Just pretend I'm her.

2009
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,840
Isn't this just another one of those?

2010
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,840
I don't know.

2011
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,840
Can you just play along for now?

2012
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,840
Until we're out of this crappy situation, then we can unpack it all later?

2013
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,840
Yeah, we'll go to therapy after this, don't worry.

2014
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:13,840
Or not.

2015
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,840
I don't think I will personally, but you can go to therapy.

2016
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:21,840
Like, I could tell a therapist what I've been up to-

2017
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,840
Oh, like I could tell a therapist what I've been up to.

2018
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,840
Alright, just a thought.

2019
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,840
Let's get out of here.

2020
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,840
Oh, let's just get out of here.

2021
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,840
He literally has screaming night terrors, does he?

2022
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,840
Um, like we should have done months ago.

2023
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,840
Now that we've got food, don't you want to keep waiting until they let us out?

2024
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,840
Hell no, I don't.

2025
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,840
They'll throw us in jail right after.

2026
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,840
And I don't know which is worse.

2027
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,840
Withering in this coffin of a house or getting railed in a prison?

2028
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,840
Don't worry, Andy.

2029
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,840
I'll be the one railing you in prison.

2030
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,840
I see.

2031
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,840
You want to escape not only this quarantine, but the consequences of her actions as well.

2032
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,840
Preferably, yeah.

2033
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,840
This episode is titled Andy and Laylee and the Escape from the Coffin.

2034
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,840
Yeah, whatever.

2035
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:25,840
I'm going to sleep now.

2036
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,840
Promise.

2037
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,840
I promise I'll be the one railing you in jail.

2038
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:32,840
Bend over.

2039
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:33,840
Drop the soap, okay?

2040
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
Now with my two inch.

2041
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,840
More than a two inch.

2042
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,840
I'll try again.

2043
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,840
I love you, Andy.

2044
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,840
Shut that Andy junk up your ass already.

2045
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:49,840
My God.

2046
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,840
I don't love you that much.

2047
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,840
You make me want to kill myself?

2048
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,840
Too bad dividing.

2049
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,840
Oh, too bad diving down the balcony is just too romantic for you.

2050
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,840
A pillow hits you in the face so hard you see stars.

2051
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,840
Two stars.

2052
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:16,840
Your body has absorbed some delicious nutrients and you're feeling mighty better today.

2053
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
Andy, where are you?

2054
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,840
Dividing.

2055
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,840
Shut up.

2056
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:25,840
I'm bad at reading.

2057
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,840
Where is this dude?

2058
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:31,840
He's gone.

2059
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,840
Is he on the balcony?

2060
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:35,840
Wait, what?

2061
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,840
What do you think of their relationship so far?

2062
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,840
Goals.

2063
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,840
Adorable.

2064
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,840
Of course.

2065
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,840
The freezer is full of delicious meat.

2066
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:55,840
Yum, yum, yum.

2067
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:57,840
Oh, is he in the neighbors?

2068
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,840
Oh, okay.

2069
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:00,840
Hello.

2070
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,840
Hey there.

2071
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,840
Good morning.

2072
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,840
Whatcha up to?

2073
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,840
I'm looking at this demon summoning instruction manual book thing.

2074
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,840
Brave, given things turned out so well for that cultist guy.

2075
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:16,840
It's okay, I can do it.

2076
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:17,840
I'll help you.

2077
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:18,840
I'll help you.

2078
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:19,840
Debatable.

2079
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,840
I mean, he was successful up to the point he lacked an offering.

2080
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,840
Oh.

2081
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:27,840
Anyways, it says here that demons don't think much of humans.

2082
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,840
Well, that's good.

2083
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,840
We'll have something in common then.

2084
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,840
Yeah, yeah.

2085
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,840
So they're only willing to do business as long as it's quick and easy for them.

2086
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:43,840
I take it.

2087
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,840
Wait, actually, hold on.

2088
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,840
I should say, I don't.

2089
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
I actually want to do a witchcraft.

2090
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:57,840
I actually want to do a witchcraft stream and I want to make potion bottles for you guys

2091
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,840
and I want to send them to you, but I don't know if I'll be allowed to.

2092
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:06,840
I think I have to ask, but I really want to do a witchcraft stream where I make little,

2093
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,840
like little, not potion, little spell bottles for you.

2094
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,840
I think that would be so cute.

2095
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,840
And you can tell me what you want me to put in it and I'll put what you want.

2096
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,840
And maybe I can even put, I can even write a little handwritten message in there.

2097
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:21,840
That would be so cute and I want to send it to you, but I don't know.

2098
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,840
I'll have to ask, I'll have to ask if I can send it to you.

2099
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
I'm not putting my eminate in it.

2100
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,840
It will be completely sane items, okay?

2101
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,840
There's not going to be any spit in the bottles.

2102
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,840
There's not going to be any piss in the bottles.

2103
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,840
There's not going to be any shit in the bottles.

2104
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,840
You don't have to buy it.

2105
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,840
I'll probably like, I don't know.

2106
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,840
I don't want to put it behind a paywall.

2107
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:51,840
Maybe I'll make like a, some kind of pool, choose someone random, you know?

2108
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,840
There won't be bathwater, no.

2109
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,840
Maybe accidentally sending demons to people's homes.

2110
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
It won't, it won't be demons.

2111
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,840
It won't be demons.

2112
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,840
No, there won't be any hair in there either.

2113
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:08,840
I'm not putting any of my personal parts in, in those, in those bottles.

2114
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,840
Well, I wouldn't want to get out of here the same way the cultists did,

2115
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,840
but I do think this is our best bet for now.

2116
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,840
So what will we ask from it?

2117
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,840
I don't know.

2118
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,840
Okay, then what will we bargain with?

2119
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,840
I don't know that either.

2120
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,840
Nice.

2121
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:31,840
I just barely woke up.

2122
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,840
Give me a minute.

2123
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:35,840
It says here demons prefer human soul, so obviously it's just got to be that.

2124
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,840
Where do you get a soul while stuck in here?

2125
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,840
What are you looking at?

2126
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,840
Nothing.

2127
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,840
Actually, what?

2128
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:47,840
I wouldn't thought about it, I see.

2129
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,840
Let me keep my thoughts to myself.

2130
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,840
Didn't we already share enough?

2131
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,840
On second thought, let's not do this.

2132
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,840
Oh, come on, I'm not going to sacrifice you.

2133
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,840
We'll figure something out.

2134
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,840
Let's just set this ritual up for now.

2135
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,840
Nine out of ten?

2136
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,840
Thank you, Sheebie.

2137
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,840
Will you burp into the bottle?

2138
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:08,840
Okay, fine, fine.

2139
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,840
If you want me to burp into the bottle, I'll burp into it.

2140
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,840
The Gamer Girl bathwater was canceled.

2141
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,840
Not because it was horrible, but because it was a biohazard.

2142
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,840
Bill almost got fired for that.

2143
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,840
Okay, but did we really expect it to be Gamer Girl bathwater?

2144
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,840
It's obviously just like perfumed water.

2145
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
It's not actual bathwater.

2146
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,840
Also, if you hear creaking, it's my chair.

2147
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:32,840
I'm not farting.

2148
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,840
Okay?

2149
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,840
I'm not done reading this yet,

2150
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,840
but you can start by replacing the candles for now.

2151
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:45,840
Okay.

2152
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
Oh, fuck.

2153
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,840
What?

2154
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:51,840
Replacing the candles.

2155
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,840
Put them up.

2156
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:58,840
Replace them.

2157
01:44:58,840 --> 01:44:59,840
Okay.

2158
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,840
No, I'm not sending lemonade in a bottle.

2159
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,840
Oh my God.

2160
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:19,840
Shut up.

2161
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,840
I'd obviously make you pay for lemonade.

2162
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,840
That wouldn't be free.

2163
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,840
Okay, there you go.

2164
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:27,840
I set up the candles.

2165
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:28,840
Done with now.

2166
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,840
Now we...

2167
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,840
Still alive and kicking, are you?

2168
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:34,840
Uh-oh.

2169
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,840
You've been quiet lately, pal.

2170
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,840
I'm getting a little worried here.

2171
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:42,840
Si.

2172
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:44,840
Yeah, hi, hello.

2173
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,840
One of my guys isn't answering.

2174
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,840
Oh, fuck.

2175
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:49,840
Oh, fuck.

2176
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:50,840
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

2177
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:52,840
The weirdo one.

2178
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,840
You think he croaked me?

2179
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,840
But he's just a type B anyways.

2180
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:57,840
What?

2181
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,840
How much?

2182
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,840
Oh, you.

2183
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,840
Oh, you.

2184
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:10,840
Oh, you.

2185
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,840
Type B, what does that mean?

2186
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,840
Fine.

2187
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,840
I'll check it after my round.

2188
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,840
Is that all we would have had to do to get the door open?

2189
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,840
Just shut up for two days?

2190
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,840
Shit, he's gonna come in and see all this?

2191
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,840
No, no, no, no, no, enough.

2192
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,840
Go stall him at our door.

2193
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:31,840
I'll clean this up.

2194
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:36,840
He's still gonna find the guy missing unless he checks the freezer,

2195
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,840
which is where all this blood is pointing at.

2196
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:41,840
No.

2197
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,840
Go before he notices we're not home and keep him until I've mopped up all the blood.

2198
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,840
Why, why are you guys blood type B type B blood type B?

2199
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,840
Are they like collecting these people for their blood or something?

2200
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,840
What do you mean type B?

2201
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,840
There should be a corpse below then.

2202
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,840
You, you get to be that...

2203
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,840
I fucking can't read.

2204
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,840
You get to be that corpse if you don't get going already.

2205
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:15,840
I have to clean up the blood.

2206
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,840
Clean it up, clean it up.

2207
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,840
Oh fuck, get them up.

2208
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,840
Okay, get them up, get them up.

2209
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,840
You'll see.

2210
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:23,840
What's your blood type?

2211
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:24,840
That's a really good question actually.

2212
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:25,840
I don't know.

2213
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,840
Every time I've ever gone to donate blood,

2214
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:32,840
that's not where the mop is.

2215
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,840
I used, I went a couple times to donate blood and they said that they would send me a card,

2216
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:41,840
like a donor card that would say my blood type on it,

2217
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,840
but they never ended up doing that.

2218
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,840
So I don't know if they just never use my blood,

2219
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,840
but I actually don't know my blood type.

2220
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:56,840
Mine is O plus.

2221
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:58,840
That's cool.

2222
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,840
Ashley, the warden is coming.

2223
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:03,840
What do I do?

2224
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:05,840
Get out, get out of here.

2225
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:07,840
What are you doing here?

2226
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:08,840
Oh shoot.

2227
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,840
Silly, the warden soon calls over his buddy.

2228
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:15,840
You get taken back to your apartment after which you and your brother,

2229
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,840
you and your brother's wicked deeds are soon discovered.

2230
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,840
You donate blood, good girl.

2231
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:23,840
I only did it like twice or three times maybe,

2232
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,840
but it worries me that they never gave me a donor card because I even asked.

2233
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,840
I said, Hey, why didn't I get a card?

2234
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:30,840
And they were like, Oh, we'll send you one Dory.

2235
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,840
So now it makes me feel like I have some sort of disease and they never use my blood because of that.

2236
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,840
Because you know, they test the blood that they,

2237
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,840
they test the blood that they collect from you.

2238
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:43,840
So I'm now I'm scared I have some sort of fucking disease and they never just,

2239
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:45,840
they just never told me.

2240
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:48,840
And that's why I didn't get a card because they never use my blood.

2241
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,840
Andrew, start pole dancing.

2242
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,840
Distract the guards.

2243
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,840
Guess what?

2244
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,840
It went so badly for you that I'm going to let you try again.

2245
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:03,840
No.

2246
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,840
Wait, what did I do wrong?

2247
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:08,840
Is that supposed to happen?

2248
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:16,840
But I didn't do anything.

2249
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,840
Oh, I have to hide in the closet?

2250
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:27,840
I don't know.

2251
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,840
I just got here.

2252
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,840
Okay.

2253
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,840
I'll hide in the closet.

2254
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,840
Okay.

2255
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:38,840
Readings and salutations.

2256
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:43,840
Anybody home?

2257
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,840
I'll create another suicide.

2258
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,840
I'll create another suicide.

2259
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:53,840
I'll create another suicide.

2260
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,840
I'll create another suicide.

2261
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:00,840
What the?

2262
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:02,840
How did you get in here?

2263
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,840
Oh, my savior.

2264
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:08,840
Thank you, Andy.

2265
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,840
Sai.

2266
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:15,840
Oh fuck, that's kind of hot.

2267
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:18,840
Andrew doesn't seem to please with you right now.

2268
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2269
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,840
You wonder if it's a good time to tell him that this is your fault.

2270
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:27,840
Oh, my God, the bloody hand.

2271
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:29,840
Come on then, Laili.

2272
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:30,840
Let's go.

2273
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,840
Shish, I thought I got caught there.

2274
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:37,840
You did.

2275
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:38,840
Happens to the best of...

2276
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:42,840
Right, he do be kind of hot.

2277
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:43,840
Oh, my God.

2278
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:47,840
What do we do now?

2279
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,840
Let's escape.

2280
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:50,840
Well, you've done it now, Andy.

2281
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,840
You've actually killed a man.

2282
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:54,840
Like, directly.

2283
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,840
Yup.

2284
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:57,840
I was a little surprised there.

2285
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,840
So where's your mental breakdown?

2286
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:01,840
I'm saving it for later.

2287
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,840
Lay off.

2288
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,840
I'm reading deleted messages that mods deleted.

2289
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:15,840
You guys are so funny.

2290
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:22,840
I know, I'm sorry, I know.

2291
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,840
These standards are impossible.

2292
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,840
I know it's, I know it's not, I know.

2293
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,840
I can't expect any of you to be murderers.

2294
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,840
Actually, I'm not in the mood right now for your shit.

2295
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:33,840
All right.

2296
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:34,840
Oh, looky here.

2297
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:38,840
Got a key to room 405.

2298
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:40,840
405.

2299
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,840
What's in here?

2300
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:45,840
Ew, okay.

2301
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:51,840
Women only want one thing and it's a fucking murder.

2302
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:55,840
While loading the jacket pockets, you find a wallet with $600.

2303
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:59,840
Now you got real moral dilemma here, stealing a dead man's wallet.

2304
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:01,840
Oh.

2305
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,840
Which one will make him want to fuck me?

2306
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,840
I'm guessing splitting it, right?

2307
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:15,840
Right?

2308
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,840
A tiny consequence.

2309
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,840
He saved your life, you brat.

2310
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,840
At least give him some of the cash.

2311
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,840
Okay, okay, okay.

2312
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:30,840
Aren't you a sweetheart?

2313
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,840
Don't say that, don't say that.

2314
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,840
I'll use some of mine to treat you something to some...

2315
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:42,840
I'll use some of mine to treat you something someday.

2316
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,840
Maybe?

2317
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:46,840
Okay.

2318
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:49,840
Where do we go?

2319
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,840
Do we go to the other room?

2320
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,840
You just kept it different now?

2321
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:01,840
What do I do?

2322
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,840
It was a 333 split.

2323
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,840
But...

2324
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,840
You will find two more of them in the game.

2325
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:17,840
Get on you for sharing?

2326
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,840
Of course I always share with my brother.

2327
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:21,840
I always...

2328
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,840
I will always share everything.

2329
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,840
I'm just looking for things to interact with.

2330
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,840
Because I don't know what else to do.

2331
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,840
You can leave from the neighbor's house.

2332
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:34,840
Yes, I have done that.

2333
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,840
Hey, sit down on the toilet.

2334
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,840
Actually, no, I'll sit down and you pee between my legs, okay?

2335
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:44,840
Oh my gosh!

2336
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,840
That actually worked!

2337
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,840
Maybe I'll take a shower.

2338
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,840
Not right now, you won't.

2339
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:51,840
Okay, fine, jeez.

2340
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:57,840
No, like leave the apartments.

2341
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:58,840
Oh!

2342
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,840
Oh, oh, oh.

2343
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:03,840
Okay.

2344
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,840
Oh, shit.

2345
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,840
You unlocked the door and...

2346
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,840
Don't stand behind me like that, jeez.

2347
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,840
I just want to make sure we're on the same page about something.

2348
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,840
Whatever excuse we had for eating that other guy just went out the window because of your screw up.

2349
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,840
Oh, I'm sorry, did I ask you to kill him?

2350
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,840
What do you think is going to happen if I hadn't?

2351
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,840
Look, I'm not saying I'm not grateful, Andrew.

2352
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:38,840
I am, but what's your point?

2353
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,840
I wish he grabbed me like that!

2354
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:53,840
My point is that no matter what happens beyond the store,

2355
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:58,840
you won't speak a word of what went down here to anyone.

2356
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:01,840
Yeah, obviously, obviously.

2357
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,840
And it'll no doubt be obvious we did something once this guy's shift ends

2358
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,840
and the next warning comes around, comes looking around.

2359
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:10,840
As best we disappear while we can.

2360
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:13,840
Yeah, as you might have noticed, I'm trying!

2361
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:18,840
You see, I'm not sure you're grasping the gravity of our situation here.

2362
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,840
Knowing you, you think you're going to find mom and dad.

2363
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:24,840
But I'm saying all of that is off the table.

2364
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:27,840
I didn't plan on anything, actually.

2365
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,840
God, that's even worse!

2366
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,840
Okay, so you want me to never contact anyone I know ever again?

2367
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,840
Because you think they'll snitch on us to the authorities, is that it?

2368
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,840
Yes, exactly!

2369
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,840
Yeah, fine, whatever.

2370
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,840
Capitan, that's what it reminded me of, yeah?

2371
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,840
If you're going to be this flippant about this,

2372
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,840
it isn't the authorities you need to worry about.

2373
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:52,840
What's that supposed to mean?

2374
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:54,840
Are you threatening me right now?

2375
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:56,840
Ah!

2376
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:03,840
I'm not going to jail just because you think of yourself as impurevious to consequences.

2377
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,840
So you're going to take this to your grave and if...

2378
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:10,840
The tear just ran down my leg.

2379
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,840
Even if I have to put you in there myself.

2380
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,840
Oh my god, please put me in my grave, please!

2381
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,840
You don't scare me, Andrew.

2382
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,840
Ah!

2383
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:21,840
Don't give me re-

2384
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:22,840
Ah!

2385
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:25,840
Ah!

2386
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,840
Andi, it smells in hell the damn afraid of you.

2387
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,840
Now back the fuck off!

2388
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,840
Who do you think you're talking to?

2389
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,840
I'm stressed out, Lele.

2390
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:49,840
Truly the ideal relationship.

2391
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,840
Okay, yeah, I can see that.

2392
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,840
I need to know what you're...

2393
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,840
I need to know you're taking this seriously.

2394
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:03,840
There's half a dead guy in our freezer with my fingerprints all over it.

2395
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,840
Trust me, I'm in no hurry to tell the world about this.

2396
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,840
Hmm? All good? Can we go now?

2397
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:11,840
Yeah, I guess.

2398
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:13,840
Okay, finally.

2399
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:14,840
Though, Andi,

2400
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:20,840
I don't give a rat's ass about mom and or dad or any of my so-called friends anymore.

2401
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:23,840
Not one of them felt it necessary to even answer my calls.

2402
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,840
I know my dreams have come true.

2403
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:33,840
They got such a beautifully toxic relationship.

2404
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,840
I'm sorry, I still have...

2405
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,840
I'm like constantly stuck in on cough drops right now.

2406
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,840
Yeah, truly a romantic relationship.

2407
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,840
Or come fling food up toward balcony.

2408
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,840
Would be quite the feat to throw something so high.

2409
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:55,840
The point is no one even came to try.

2410
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,840
So my affections officially died with all the brain cells I lost while starving.

2411
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,840
But it's alright because Andi is here with me,

2412
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,840
even though he feels like threatening me for some reason.

2413
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:07,840
Sorry.

2414
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,840
I guess I lost some brain cells too.

2415
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:12,840
I can tell!

2416
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:13,840
Can't lose what we...

2417
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,840
Oh, can't lose what you don't have!

2418
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,840
Hahahaha.

2419
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,840
Kiss it to our mouth like you said earlier.

2420
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:26,840
There you go.

2421
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,840
I don't know if you heard anything.

2422
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:33,840
Oh, fuck you.

2423
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:36,840
I like how they do a little shing.

2424
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:40,840
Alright, alright, let's get the hell out of here, ready?

2425
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,840
Oh, what is this?

2426
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,840
That's a door.

2427
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:46,840
401 is open!

2428
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:48,840
Oh, fuck off.

2429
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:50,840
Is this our door?

2430
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,840
This is all it took to keep us in a wooden board.

2431
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,840
It's okay, Andi, I don't have much muscle either.

2432
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,840
Your eyes say you're trying to cover me,

2433
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,840
but your words do the opposite.

2434
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:03,840
Whatever.

2435
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:06,840
What's the slip of paper say?

2436
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:10,840
They are collecting our blood.

2437
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,840
You're welcome, you're welcome.

2438
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,840
I wish I was that cough drop.

2439
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,840
What's that supposed to mean?

2440
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,840
Don't know, don't care.

2441
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,840
Yeah, let's just focus on getting out of here.

2442
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:32,840
Okay.

2443
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,840
I guess we go in here.

2444
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,840
So is this the girl that died?

2445
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:42,840
Hmm.

2446
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:45,840
I sincerely don't care.

2447
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:46,840
Let's just get out of here, please.

2448
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:47,840
Shut up!

2449
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,840
I'm working on it, goddammit.

2450
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,840
Oh my god, you're so fucking whiny.

2451
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,840
Like, I'm trying it, I'm trying it.

2452
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:57,840
We should finish the noodles though.

2453
01:59:58,840 --> 01:59:59,840
No, on the fridge.

2454
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:03,840
Notice from now on, AB types won't be given supplies,

2455
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,840
except if something's important.

2456
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:06,840
Oh!

2457
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,840
We were AB.

2458
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,840
Note 403 has an XO for it?

2459
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,840
And no, the lady from 302 being hot doesn't count as important.

2460
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:21,840
Stop asking!

2461
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:23,840
Wait, what?

2462
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,840
AB can receive from everyone, but only give to AB.

2463
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:39,840
Is the lady from 302 single?

2464
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,840
Is your brother single?

2465
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,840
Is the toilet, there's nothing of interest inside?

2466
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,840
Well, you don't know that, let me check.

2467
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,840
Oh, there's notes on all of them.

2468
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:53,840
2A1B.

2469
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,840
1O, this crossed over.

2470
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:05,840
Hmm.

2471
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,840
Why are you telling me these facts about blood types?

2472
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,840
Am I supposed to know?

2473
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:18,840
Should I know this?

2474
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:34,840
Let me out!

2475
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:35,840
What do I do now?

2476
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:37,840
Go in here?

2477
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,840
Just want to know?

2478
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,840
Stop calling me Imi.

2479
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,840
There's no Imi, just Imi.

2480
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,840
Who's this girl Imi?

2481
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,840
Why do you keep bringing her up?

2482
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:58,840
Jesus.

2483
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,840
Stop mentioning her.

2484
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:04,840
What?

2485
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,840
Lots of 666's going on.

2486
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:18,840
Imi is my sister?

2487
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:22,840
You have another sister?

2488
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:23,840
Huh?

2489
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,840
And you never told me?

2490
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:27,840
What the hell?

2491
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,840
Check the warden one last time?

2492
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:32,840
Okay, sorry.

2493
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:33,840
I'll go check on it.

2494
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,840
Oh wait, I should be able to leave from here, right?

2495
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,840
Because I unblocked it?

2496
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,840
This is the warden's place, right?

2497
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:46,840
Oh, the pewter!

2498
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:48,840
They've got a little surveillance camera.

2499
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:49,840
Oh crap, are we on it?

2500
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,840
No, looks like it's recording the second floor.

2501
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,840
Let me see.

2502
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,840
Wait, there's another warden there.

2503
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,840
Is that a gun holster?

2504
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,840
Didn't the other warden have one?

2505
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,840
What's this guy?

2506
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,840
You're the far cuter sister?

2507
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,840
It better be.

2508
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:11,840
You only had a key to the closest room in a walkie-talkie.

2509
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,840
Sorry.

2510
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:19,840
Okay, I know you keep hearing vibrating, please.

2511
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,840
It's my phone.

2512
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:27,840
There, I muted my phone so you won't hear any more vibrating.

2513
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:31,840
Ugh.

2514
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:44,840
It is my phone.

2515
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:49,840
They probably work in pairs.

2516
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,840
It's not like they have to do anything else

2517
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:56,840
then keep curious people away

2518
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,840
and pretend to feed us, I guess.

2519
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:02,840
Well, even then, how are we getting around him?

2520
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,840
It's okay, have your fun, I don't mind.

2521
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:12,840
You will know when I have my fun, okay?

2522
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:13,840
I'll make it very obvious.

2523
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,840
Oh, there's a key here!

2524
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,840
Oh, let's go to the fourth floor.

2525
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,840
Oh, can we?

2526
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:24,840
Oh, the third floor, sorry, the third floor.

2527
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,840
One A, but it's crossed over.

2528
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,840
I'm guessing the crossed over ones mean they're dead.

2529
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,840
Oh, hello!

2530
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:40,840
Hey, hey, hold up, don't you dare come any closer.

2531
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:41,840
Who are you?

2532
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,840
Your neighbors from upstairs?

2533
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,840
What are you doing here?

2534
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,840
Get out.

2535
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:49,840
Well, we found the keys and thought you might want to get out of here.

2536
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,840
You thought wrong, get lost, huh?

2537
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,840
What, don't you understand?

2538
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,840
You don't want to get out of here?

2539
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:00,840
That's what I said, why would I want out?

2540
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:03,840
I get free food and can't even play games all day long.

2541
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:04,840
Huh?

2542
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:11,840
Your special phone that has no screen and just one button.

2543
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,840
Oh, is this the hot lady?

2544
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:20,840
They showed favoritism to the hot lady, didn't they?

2545
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:21,840
Okay.

2546
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:27,840
I live like a king, I hope this quarantine never ends.

2547
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,840
They actually bring you food?

2548
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:30,840
Of course.

2549
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:35,840
Literally anything I want, all you gotta do is ask nicely.

2550
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:38,840
Oh, bro, she's been having sex with the warden, hasn't she been?

2551
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:42,840
Hasn't she been, like, bent over and open wide nicely?

2552
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:43,840
Ashley.

2553
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:50,840
Fuck you, get out of here, get out of here, get out, both of you.

2554
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:55,840
I'm going in your bathroom.

2555
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,840
Hey, did I give you permission to go there?

2556
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:59,840
I went in your kitchen.

2557
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:02,840
Girl, don't you at least do your fucking dishes.

2558
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:04,840
Can I steal some of her food?

2559
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,840
Someone gave up assembling their furniture.

2560
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,840
Why don't you ask the warden to assemble your furniture?

2561
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,840
Can we put the nail gun in her head?

2562
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:18,840
Okay.

2563
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,840
Neat girlfriend of my dreams.

2564
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,840
No, I'm your neat girlfriend of your dreams.

2565
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:27,840
Well, that was something.

2566
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,840
How come we got such different treatments?

2567
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:30,840
Why don't I get food?

2568
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,840
I guess you're just not pretty enough.

2569
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:39,840
You think she's pretty?

2570
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:42,840
Wasn't she?

2571
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:52,840
No, shut up about objectively.

2572
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:56,840
Yeah, his stock is plummeting.

2573
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,840
I'm selling Andrew coin right now.

2574
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,840
Is it okay to leave her there after she saw us though?

2575
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:05,840
Probably not, but you go in there swinging your...

2576
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,840
You go in there swinging your cleaver and she'll definitely scream.

2577
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:14,840
Blonds are just hotter?

2578
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,840
I can't tell if you're trying to give me a compliment or not.

2579
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,840
You can admire something without wanting it?

2580
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:24,840
No, you can't!

2581
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:26,840
No, you can't!

2582
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:29,840
You cannot admire something without wanting it.

2583
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,840
Don't be admiring...

2584
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:36,840
Don't be admiring shit in front of me.

2585
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,840
I think our best bet is to finish the ritual

2586
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,840
and use it to get rid of the second warden.

2587
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:54,840
Well, if we can get this woman up to the cultist room,

2588
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,840
we've got us assault to offer.

2589
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:59,840
How on earth are we going to convince her lazy ass

2590
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,840
to even leave her room?

2591
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:04,840
Beats me, let's just finish setting up the ritual for now.

2592
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:05,840
Alright.

2593
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,840
Do you really think I'm not pretty enough?

2594
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,840
Oh, come on!

2595
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,840
So ugly am I?

2596
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:16,840
So ugly that I shouldn't even be fed?

2597
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:18,840
Or maybe they think...

2598
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:20,840
Or maybe they didn't think it'd be fun to screw you

2599
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:22,840
while I'm loitering around the house.

2600
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,840
Oh yeah, okay, fair point.

2601
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,840
You're already my type, Imi?

2602
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,840
Good.

2603
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:41,840
I am admiring nothing.

2604
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:42,840
I only have eyes for you.

2605
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,840
That's how it should be!

2606
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:46,840
That's how it should be!

2607
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:50,840
No, don't admire any stupid missiles.

2608
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:51,840
Stupid missiles.

2609
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:53,840
Missiles don't have holes in them.

2610
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:00,840
Okay, anyways.

2611
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:02,840
I wouldn't let them anyways.

2612
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:03,840
YEEEHHH!

2613
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,840
Thank you!

2614
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,840
You better not let them.

2615
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:11,840
Unknown the door is too big.

2616
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:12,840
Okay.

2617
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:14,840
Is anyone else home?

2618
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:17,840
Not soft holes at least.

2619
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:18,840
Yeah.

2620
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:19,840
You want to fuck a missile?

2621
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,840
Go ahead, be my guest.

2622
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:25,840
Oh, another floor.

2623
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:26,840
Oh wait, this is our floor.

2624
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,840
Wait, what did we want to do?

2625
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,840
We wanted to finish setting up the ritual, right?

2626
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:31,840
How do we do that?

2627
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,840
A walkie-talkie.

2628
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:37,840
Useless.

2629
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,840
I don't know, at least we'll hear if the others

2630
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,840
weren't trying to contact this one.

2631
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,840
Which then indicates time is running out for us.

2632
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,840
Only admire Amy, yeah.

2633
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,840
No, don't admire any other girls.

2634
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:57,840
And don't want any other girls either.

2635
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:58,840
Big deal.

2636
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,840
At that point, we're screwed anyway.

2637
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,840
Hey, what if we call the warden over with this

2638
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,840
and have the demon eat his soul?

2639
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,840
That's not a bad idea, actually.

2640
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:08,840
Two birds with one stone!

2641
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:10,840
Though he'll come in guns blazing.

2642
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:11,840
Ah, right.

2643
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,840
Let me think.

2644
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:13,840
Let me think.

2645
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:14,840
Let me think.

2646
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:15,840
Let me think.

2647
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:16,840
Let me think.

2648
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:17,840
Let me think.

2649
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:18,840
Let me think.

2650
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:19,840
Let me think.

2651
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:20,840
Let me think.

2652
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:21,840
Let me think.

2653
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:22,840
Let me think.

2654
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:23,840
Let me think.

2655
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:24,840
Let me think.

2656
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:25,840
Let me think.

2657
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,840
Right.

2658
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,840
Let me think.

2659
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:31,840
While you're at it, I'll read the ritual for us.

2660
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,840
What do I need to do?

2661
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:34,840
I don't remember.

2662
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,840
Check the guidebook.

2663
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:42,840
I keep leaning over on my chair to try to fart,

2664
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:43,840
but it's not coming out.

2665
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:45,840
I'm getting stream,

2666
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,840
I'm getting stream shy or something.

2667
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:54,840
Jake isn't a girl.

2668
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:56,840
Stay out of trouble.

2669
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:59,840
I'm not falling for you.

2670
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:02,840
You're a missile now in me

2671
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:03,840
since four-

2672
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:04,840
Well-

2673
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:05,840
Well...

is trying to read that.

2677

Check the guidebook.

2678
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,840
What guidebook?

2679
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:26,480

clairvoyant dream to gouge the Troubles ahead thank you

2744
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:05,600
yeah the entity has left why do the dead bodies look like that oh they're

2745
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:09,600
upside down that's why you're still alive unlike either of the wardens man

2746
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:14,920
that all happened way too fast in the end I didn't get its name nor to ask for

2747
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:22,600
a favor it's the clairvoyant object two inches I wasn't gonna make a joke about

Excalibur my 7 inch wand my 7 inch Gucci destroyer my my pen it's um

2751
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:11,200
pockets but no matter the warden is dead and if I have even one clairvoyant

2752
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:15,360
dream that'd be cool as hell

2753
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:30,720

2761
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:35,520
go you're taking a while I figured she wouldn't start anything as long as I

2762
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,160
had my cleaver lesson learned how interesting that you'd want to take

2763
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:45,680
your chances with that for no reason what are you getting at you were trying

2764
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:49,800
to fuck her weren't you that's why you let her go and then she tried to shoot

2765
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:55,480
you with her nail gun you did say she was pretty I didn't try anything with her

2766
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:59,840

2769
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:22,040
unaware that the lady is left dead right now I guess she said no secure you

2770
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:28,160
actually almost got shot too that's your own fault for letting her go I can't

2771
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:32,480
believe what a dumbass you are when it comes to women for the last time I

2772

a lot of Nickelodeon shows what's in history I'm not showing you what's in

2961
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:53,620
history

2962
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:04,980
it's really nice where I heard gunshots last night or was that just you haven't

2963
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:12,540
shot anything yet what I think I left my gun back in the room I really wish

2964
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:20,860
you'd be less nonchalant about everything all the time I'm moderately

2965
02:50:20,860 --> 02:50:23,580
terrified of your searches wait there's literally nothing what do you mean you

2966
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:26,780
didn't even see my search history

2967
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:37,140
you mean I'm literally literally checking my search history yeah there's

2968
02:50:37,140 --> 02:50:49,740
nothing there so in this chapter there's a ton of stuff to interact with show it

2969
02:50:52,500 --> 02:51:00,820
no okay I really wish you'd be less nonchalant about everything all the time

2970
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:03,980
hey now we can't both be constantly shitting ourselves over every little

2971
02:51:04,340 --> 02:51:09,780
thing true let's just go back to the motel before someone breaks in and steals

2972
02:51:09,780 --> 02:51:17,420
a damn thing why would someone break in eat food wait this is actually funny

2973
02:51:17,420 --> 02:51:22,260
this reminds me of something when I was in high school me and my friend made a

2974
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:29,940
trash a potted plant subsists among cigarette but when I was in high school

2975
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:37,860
me and my friend for 11th grade final we decided to draw a comic together and

2976
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:42,740
this isn't even a funny story it's just reminds me of something and in the

2977
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:46,740
comic we had to draw some advertisements and our advertisements were

2978
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:55,580
basically just the words like that eat food drink Pepsi friend guys it's a girl

2979
02:51:55,900 --> 02:52:04,300
it was a girl she was one of my besties in high school I miss her she's not that

2980
02:52:04,300 --> 02:52:11,580
she's not that she's not that she's not that is she single? she's a lesbian

2981
02:52:13,580 --> 02:52:17,980
just kidding get out the road stupid

2982
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:37,900
that clearly doesn't answer the question it doesn't matter also why are you

2983
02:52:37,900 --> 02:52:47,260
asking if my friend is single don't worry about my friend an ad for a coffee

2984
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:50,820
shop it's difficult to imagine the aroma of warm cup of coffee with trash running

2985
02:52:50,820 --> 02:53:02,980
next to you can we be lesbians? shut up everybody she's single shut up do you hate me is that

2986
02:53:02,980 --> 02:53:10,500
why you're asking are you tired of me already are you tired of living in

2987
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:16,820
where is the ad? ask your doctor if you think she's ready for you

3057
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:49,860
it's the one thing I asked of you

3058
03:00:52,260 --> 03:00:59,940
and it's symbolic dumbass you and your romanticism shove it up your ass I don't know what I was expecting

3059
03:01:01,940 --> 03:01:08,340
listen I'm behaving what more do you want I'm being so good to you are you because I'm getting

3060
03:01:08,340 --> 03:01:14,580
the the opposite impression here yeah yeah you think I'm so awful huh

3061
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:20,100
oh hold on

3062
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:29,620
barking is cringe these later she's a bark I never said barking was cringe did I

3063
03:01:30,500 --> 03:01:31,460
I've been barking

3064
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:39,380
you want to see what it's like when I actually misbehave it could be so much worse

3065
03:01:39,380 --> 03:01:43,380
should I show you just how should I show you just how awful I really am

3066
03:01:44,340 --> 03:01:50,980
ah go for it that you're going to find me a lot less accommodating than Andy

3067
03:01:54,580 --> 03:02:01,700
and now some less important news one of the quarantine departments has had a bit of a situation

3068
03:02:04,820 --> 03:02:07,700
I wish she would grab me like that I'll grab you like that

3069
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:08,420
that

3070
03:02:12,580 --> 03:02:16,580
nothing major just a fire that burned the whole place down everybody died yes

3071
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:21,700
everybody a representative of the water company is here with us today is there anything you'd like

3072
03:02:21,700 --> 03:02:27,300
to add yes my deepest condolences to the family members of the deceased this apartment was most

3073
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:33,780
definitely not a wholly mismanaged mess better burned to the ground so it's good that they escaped

3074
03:02:34,580 --> 03:02:40,420
are you even tall enough to grab any just just bend over

3075
03:02:42,740 --> 03:02:46,580
I am tall enough to grab you like that you just gotta bend over for me

3076
03:02:50,500 --> 03:02:55,300
therefore it is so sad that this happened to ease that sadness we recommend you try our talks

3077
03:02:56,740 --> 03:03:00,820
we just rolled out three new and exciting flavors excuse me sir something seems to

3078
03:03:00,820 --> 03:03:06,180
be going wrong with your microphone I'm sure you mean to say drink our trusty bubbly pop what

3079
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:11,460
happened which happens to be our sponsor and it doesn't even make your organs bleed out of your

3080
03:03:11,460 --> 03:03:18,180
ass unlike some alternatives anyway um that was all for now tune in again later for a more wholesome

3081
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:29,940
news to cheer up your day if you insist I do insist that was our apartment wasn't it was being

3082
03:03:29,940 --> 03:03:36,980
the correct tense indeed did I leave the oven on I said everybody died oh that's great isn't it

3083
03:03:38,660 --> 03:03:44,580
they must think we died too and all the evidence of our escape escapades let's say has been incinerated

3084
03:03:46,500 --> 03:03:47,300
I wonder about that

3085
03:03:52,580 --> 03:03:57,540
I told you it'll all work out that still leaves us homeless and just about penniless

3086
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:06,100
whatever things are clearly clearly gonna sort themselves out I'm gonna get some sleep good night

3087
03:04:09,220 --> 03:04:14,340
the water company that owns the current in-world coca-cola product talks talks to soda is there

3088
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:18,580
some sort of conspiracy theory that I'm not I'm not that's not clicking for me

3089
03:04:22,020 --> 03:04:24,580
I don't know who this bend over person is

3090
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:31,700
I'm gonna stay up a bit longer maybe the late night news will have more information on the fire

3091
03:04:34,180 --> 03:04:40,660
suit yourself I don't know in a minute oh okay okay well I guess I'm gonna sleep

3092
03:04:41,220 --> 03:04:43,220
as usual you fall asleep without a care in the world

3093
03:04:45,860 --> 03:04:49,860
oh shit oh this is the dream someone has entered the room

3094
03:04:55,540 --> 03:04:57,540
oh

3095
03:05:01,860 --> 03:05:06,340

um go left okay

3101
03:05:39,140 --> 03:05:42,420
so want to stay here and see if the killer actually shows up

3102
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:46,980
and what did I do to deserve to get murdered for in my sleep anyways

3103
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:52,340
might be a risky a bit risky staying here you don't want that you don't know which direction they came from

3104
03:05:52,340 --> 03:05:58,180
right assuming anyone shows up anyway they will I'm sure

3105
03:06:01,540 --> 03:06:07,300
have you actually never played this before no I haven't of course not

3106
03:06:09,540 --> 03:06:15,940
Andrew lights up his fourth cigarette oh cringe Andrew come on that's not hot come on

3107
03:06:16,660 --> 03:06:21,220
way to pull money bro this dude's such an asshole he buys newspapers and cigarettes but I can't buy

3108
03:06:21,220 --> 03:06:23,220
some fucking soda

3109
03:06:24,500 --> 03:06:32,740
what the hell yeah ill smoker cringe some people think I smoke weed too guys I don't smoke weed

3110
03:06:33,460 --> 03:06:37,460
I would never put my rats life in danger like that by smoking weed next to them

3111
03:06:44,580 --> 03:06:49,060
it's probably cold because that crap misses with your blood circulation okay mom

3112
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:54,580
makes you impotent too by the way uh that's okay we don't want any babies

3113
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:59,060
it didn't sound like I'd be it didn't sound like I'd be meeting any girls anytime soon anyway

3114
03:06:59,780 --> 03:07:04,260
but stopping you I love it when he looks like that

3115
03:07:07,380 --> 03:07:12,500
consider hot smoker girl smoking is not hot except in this situation when it is

3116
03:07:19,220 --> 03:07:24,340
all right I said enough quiet you I thought we were hiding

3117
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:41,140
that wasn't the guy who you're expecting to come slit your throat he sure looked familiar

3118
03:07:41,140 --> 03:07:44,260
didn't we eat that guy don't say that out loud

3119
03:07:50,020 --> 03:07:53,300
him calling Ashley mom is a single worse insult he could say why what happened to

3120
03:07:53,300 --> 03:07:54,420
their mom what did the mom do

3121
03:08:03,220 --> 03:08:09,460
you'll see okay sorry didn't we chop that guy up and store him in a freezer

3122
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:14,900
Ashley come on he seriously though I guess there's more where he came from

3123
03:08:14,980 --> 03:08:20,980
or do you suppose he was off to a sex and drugs party with demons duh why are you asking me

3124
03:08:23,460 --> 03:08:27,380
whatever should we follow him but I'm trying to see if my vision comes true or not

3125
03:08:29,300 --> 03:08:33,940
it's not like we both have to be here really don't want to stand here alone in the middle of the night

3126
03:08:34,580 --> 03:08:35,540
but you're also curious

3127
03:08:35,540 --> 03:08:46,420

3129
03:08:56,580 --> 03:09:00,180

3144
03:10:43,460 --> 03:10:46,820
what a waste of money not at all my curiosity is sated

3145
03:10:47,460 --> 03:10:52,500
chemical burn on my tongue aside I really am mighty pleased with this random act of kindness

3146
03:10:53,220 --> 03:10:58,020
what do you want in return my virginity yes yes yes

3147
03:11:00,340 --> 03:11:05,540
Jesus fucking Christ that's enough of that I mean if you go to a bar and a dude buys your

3148
03:11:05,540 --> 03:11:10,100
drink isn't that the logical conclusion which bar is this I should go sometime

3149
03:11:10,820 --> 03:11:14,660
actually doesn't that doesn't make sense I doubt the bar I doubt the bar

3150
03:11:14,660 --> 03:11:18,100
browsing bitches are very virginal how judgmental of you

3151
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:22,580
oh that's nasty you don't have to finish it just throw it out

3152
03:11:25,540 --> 03:11:28,020
you can talk to her again for a bit by the way

3153
03:11:28,340 --> 03:11:33,060
never it was a gift
