Pewdiepie

993
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Pewdiepie was a drug addict

994
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Pewdiepie

995
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
This was a fan fiction

996
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Is that what you said?

997
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's an animation series

998
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
They made a whole animation?

999
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Yes, someone animated this

1000
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Each episode is 5 minutes long

1001
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
My first one was Apple.exe

1002
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I watched that one

1003
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Whoa, what is happening?

1004
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Where is the layer?

1005
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
It's not on YouTube, is it? Because the Apple.exe I'm seeing is on YouTube

1006
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Oh, Apple.exe, it only has 100,000 views

1007
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Oh, it might have been removed, I think

1008
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I think a lot of those videos were removed, yeah

1009
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Oh, .mov, I'm so sorry

1010
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Apple.mov

1011
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
There we go

1012
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Apple.mov

1013
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Let me watch this piece of history here

1014
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
First I have to get through a Grammarly ad

1015
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Ha!

1016
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I hate how YouTube forces you to

1017
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
watch ads now

1018
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
It's a 42 second ad and it's unskippable

1019
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Brother

1020
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Cupcakes where Pinkie Pie was like a serial killer

1021
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I watched um

1022
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I watched Happy Tree Friends as a kid

1023
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I watched it in elementary and I was scarred

1024
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
That was my awakening of messed up stuff

1025
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Yeah

1026
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Why did they give Applejack a male voice?

1027
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
No, a lot of them are, but not all of them

1028
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Is this some feederism kink?

1029
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Is she gonna get inflated?

1030
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I don't remember, it's been a hot

1031
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
second since I watched this

1032
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Can I show it or is it gonna be really bad?

1033
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It's gonna be pretty bad Okay, I won't show it

1034
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
You're probably gonna get claimed

1035
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
They changed Fluttershy's voice so badly

1036
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Oh my god

1037
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Fluttershy is my favorite in that series

1038
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
She used to scare me, but now I'm like

1039
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Yes girl, hang those heads on your wall

1040
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Go off queen

1041
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Go off queen

1042
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
What the fuck

1043
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
What the fuck

1044
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
That is indeed the appropriate reaction

1045
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Stay out of my shit

1046
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Stay out of my shit

1047
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Stay out of my shit

1048
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Stay out of my shit

1049
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
What

1050
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I love the confusion, which part are you at?

1051
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I'm at the part where the sound of her eating apples is getting

1052
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
looped in the background while she's staring at a void of

1053
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
apples coming towards her

1054
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I see

1055
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And her head is turning into an apple

1056
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Oh

1057
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Yes, eye shadow

1058
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Oh she's just having a seizure, okay

1059
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
That's the most tame reaction to someone having a seizure

1060
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
No big deal guys

1061
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
She went into an apple induced seizure

1062
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Oh girl, she eats the apple, she puked out again

1063
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Gross

1064
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Okay, it's not that bad

1065
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Oh that one's the most tame one out of them

1066
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Oh really? Should I look at the

1067
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Pinkie Pie what?

1068
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Someone said

1069
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Pinkie Pie turned into a serial killer

1070
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That one is cupcakes

1071
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
That one is cupcakes

1072
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
That one is cupcakes

1073
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
That's another

1074
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
My little pony fan animation

1075
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
You should definitely watch it, it's definitely a part of the

1076
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
experience

1077
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I'm making my pony a hoe right now

1078
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Cupcakes HD, is that it?

1079
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I think so

1080
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
It's definitely a reupload

1081
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Yeah

1082
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Okay, I'll watch it

1083
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Wait they

1084
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,000
They even have the opening credits too

1085
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Oh it's a song

1086
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Oh dude

1087
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
This is totally going to trick kids

1088
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Yes

1089
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
That's why it's very controversial, that's why it's not food

1090
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Cause it looks exactly like the show

1091
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Is this an original song

1092
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
or is this

1093
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
The song used in this video is ready to die by Andrew W.K.

1094
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Is that the song they use? Okay

1095
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Oh she's got heads on her wall

1096
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You better get ready to die

1097
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
There's so many different brushes

1098
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Right they have so many different brushes but like no deform

1099
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
tool

1100
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
What did I want to do?

1101
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
What was I doing?

1102
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
You were turning your pony into a hoe

1103
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Oh yes

1104
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Thank you for reminding me

1105
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Every good hoe has a piercing

1106
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
It's not that bad

1107
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Yeah

1108
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Imagine watching that kid

1109
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
As a kid yeah, if you thought it was like a real

1110
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
My little pony thing

1111
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And you get this instead, I guess yeah it's pretty traumatizing

1112
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Holy fuck

1113
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
How is this allowed on YouTube? Don't they not allow excessive gore?

1114
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Oh yeah that's back in the day when

1115
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
They didn't have that much restrictions and everything

1116
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Ew

1117
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Ew

1118
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
What the hell

1119
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
What the hell

1120
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
The golden era

1121
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Do you guys miss this era of YouTube when it was allowed to post gore of

1122
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Pinkie Pie making cupcakes with

1123
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Rainbow Dash's intestines

1124
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
You know what I do agree

1125
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It was pretty good era

1126
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Back in the day when

1127
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
You would watch an anime on YouTube and it was part one of 26

1128
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Yeah I liked that

1129
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I watched the entirety of Powerpuff Girls Z

1130
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
On YouTube

1131
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I watched Akame Godkill and

1132
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon on YouTube?

1133
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Yay wow that came out

1134
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
How to pick up girls in a dungeon came out that long ago?

1135
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I think so let me see

1136
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Dude why does that feel so recent to me

1137
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,000
That's crazy

1138
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon?

1139
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Someone educated me

1140
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
In another one called Rainbow Factory

1141
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
They were originally fan fictions that turned into

1142
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Animations

1143
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
It was released in 2015

1144
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Holy shit

1145
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That doesn't sound long enough ago

1146
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
It does not dude

1147
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Especially 2019

1148
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
That sounds so recent

1149
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
That was so so so long ago

1150
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
It was

1151
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It wasn't long ago but yeah it was long

1152
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Long enough ago to where you were surprised when you realized how long ago it was made

1153
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Yeah

1154
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Can I help you color?

1155
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I'll do the flat colors

1156
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I won't do any of your shading

1157
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Are you doing shading?

1158
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Not for the hair

1159
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I have to do it on a different layer

1160
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
You better get ready to die

1161
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I'll get your tail

1162
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Thank you

1163
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I like how you have sparkles and stuff

1164
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Damn

1165
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
That's probably how I should have done the crystal pony

1166
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
With sparkles more than

1167
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Random blocks of rectangles

1168
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Triangles

1169
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
But that's how they did in the show

1170
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
That's how they draw their crystal ponies in the show

1171
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
It's just random rectangles of paler colors and darker colors

1172
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
It's lower accurate

1173
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I got a lower accurate crystal pony

1174
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Yes sir

1175
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
What do you mean that's over a decade ago

1176
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I guess that makes sense

1177
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
2015 is not 11 years ago

1178
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
9 years ago

1179
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
9 years ago

1180
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Yeah

1181
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I colored in your tail

1182
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Uh oh

1183
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Does someone remember happy tree friends?

1184
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I don't remember much of it

1185
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I remember seeing a lot of

1186
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Interesting problematic fan art of happy tree friends

1187
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I remember that

1188
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
And I remember liking the fan art

1189
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I remember that

1190
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I remember when I

1191
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I did watch the show

1192
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I was in the other girl

1193
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I thought I could handle my gore and my horror

1194
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And everything as a kid

1195
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
This is nothing to me

1196
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
It was like memory of watching this one episode

1197
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,000
And it was so gory that I had to turn it off

1198
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I would get scared too

1199
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
But I was the same way

1200
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I was like I can handle this

1201
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I'm a big girl

1202
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I thought this was a kids show

1203
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I didn't expect it to be so gory

1204
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
We need more shows like happy tree friends nowadays

1205
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Everything is like watered down baby garbage

1206
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Even in terms of adult shows

1207
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
That's true we don't have enough gory stuff like this anymore

1208
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,000
You got stuff like Belma these days

1209
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Like

1210
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I never watched Belma

1211
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
But I remember the controversy with Belma

1212
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Oh what controversy

1213
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
The fact that it's a shit show

1214
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
The controversial existence of Belma

1215
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
What about metal

1216
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
What

1217
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
People were just

1218
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I think they were just mad because it was a bad show

1219
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
And they took a really good

1220
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Children's show that a lot of people cared about

1221
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
And they kind of just made a bad one out of it

1222
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Yeah makes sense

1223
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
And that's why people were mad at it

1224
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Yeah

1225
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
We got terrifier I don't know that one

1226
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,000
It was an insult to the original

1227
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
For sure

1228
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
But like just don't watch it and then you won't be insulted

1229
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I didn't watch the show

1230
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Per se I watched other people watch it

1231
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I watched all of this channel called Spilling the Milk

1232
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
And they just watched a bunch of cartoons

1233
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
And they spliced their funniest moments together

1234
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Are you done

1235
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
We're both done

1236
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Okay here's our pony OCs

1237
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
We have Ruby Glitter

1238
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
She looks very rock and roll

1239
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Very edgy

1240
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm glad

1241
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,000
And here's Luna Blossom who is not in any way related to the moon

1242
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
But she is blossoming out those pumpkin leaves

1243
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yes

1244
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
They look like such a beautiful lesbian couple

1245
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
They could be

1246
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
It's the stereotypical

1247
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Butch and the more feminine one

1248
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
The cool girl and the cute girl

1249
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
If you want to save it you can just do a CTRL S

1250
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And it will save the drawing

1251
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Ah how easy

1252
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
And it saves the drawing

1253
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I'm going to end it here

1254
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,000
But thank you for drawing with me

1255
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And talking about my little pony

1256
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Of course thank you for indulging in my

1257
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Wanting to do this

1258
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I wanted to do it too

1259
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I needed to draw an updated pony sona so here it is

1260
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Luna Blossom the Crystal Pony

1261
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I'll see you guys tomorrow with

1262
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
The Don't Starve collab with IC

1263
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Would you like to lurk? Not lurk

1264
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Raid the same person

1265
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Yeah you're streaming on YouTube right?

1266
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Yeah I don't think I can raid, can I? Cause I thought you have to add

1267
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Each other and then you have to consent for other people to raid you

1268
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I thought that's how that worked

1269
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Can you, are you able to raid Shibi?

1270
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I will try

1271
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,000
You go to a YouTube studio

1272
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And you go to content

1273
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And then totomate

1274
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Okay okay

1275
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Oh yeah we're too learning Japanese

1276
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
How's that going? Oh was I

1277
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I had classes when I was in university but I haven't done anymore after

1278
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
After those classes

1279
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I was gonna test your new homegirl Josie

1280
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Anyways I am in

1281
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Go to the live section in your content category

1282
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
And then

1283
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
And then press the pencil button

1284
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
And then customization and then scroll down to where it says redirect

1285
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And then search videos from other channels

1286
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
And then you have to be subscribed though

1287
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I think I am

1288
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
It's not immediate if I click it

1289
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
It's only after you end the stream

1290
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Oh my god that's so much better than Twitch

1291
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
You don't have to press an extra button or anything

1292
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,000
It'll redirect people

1293
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
We can have more MLP related streams I guess

1294
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Maybe one day we can do a watch along

1295
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Yeah

1296
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
You all better join

1297
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
And ditch that poor poor way of thinking

1298
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
No you're gonna sit here and watch us

1299
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Be happy

1300
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Oh my god

1301
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
We're gonna strap you down

1302
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,000
We're gonna strap you down and make you watch

1303
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Tear open your eyelids hold it up with a

1304
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,000
matchstick or whatever

1305
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Okay I'll see you tomorrow

1306
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Bye bye

1307
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Bye

1308
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Thanks for watching

1309
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Thanks for watching

1310
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Thanks for watching
