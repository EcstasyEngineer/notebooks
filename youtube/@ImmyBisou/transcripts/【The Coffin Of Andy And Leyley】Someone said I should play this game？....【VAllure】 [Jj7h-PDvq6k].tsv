2532080	2553440	I'm signing off, I'll see ya.
2562080	2573840	Hello, I'm back.
2573840	2583280	I didn't go pee, I just went to get more water.
2583280	2587760	Go through the homework for real on each and ton look folder.
2587760	2594640	I don't have a homework folder on this computer profile that is.
2594640	2599000	Maybe on a different computer profile I do, but you're never going to see that one.
2599000	2602000	You don't know the password to that one.
2602000	2605760	Right.
2605760	2607200	Um, Amy, did you wash your hands?
2607200	2609200	I didn't pee, I just went to get more water.
2609200	2610040	Shut up.
2610040	2611880	I didn't, I don't need to wash my hands.
2611880	2618400	Someone's talking on the other end of the line, but you can't make out the words.
2618400	2622120	They sound more and more upset as they talk, though.
2622120	2625720	Well, that's, I mean, I can't do anything about that.
2625720	2632200	Or I can try talking to her, but sorry if my cadence when reading is shit.
2632200	2638200	Um, yeah, it is.
2638200	2643000	No, it's not big bro is cute 2024 and it's not I love on each and 13.
2643000	2645720	Come on, I'm not, I'm not that predictable.
2645720	2647320	What the hell?
2647320	2654520	You think so lowly of me that I would put such a shit password?
2654520	2658440	Um, no, I'm not angry.
2658440	2661960	I'm just sounds like he's talking to a girlfriend.
2661960	2664880	No, I can you let me talk?
2664880	2667880	What's on the other end must have said no.
2667880	2671640	It's increasingly allowed, but you still can't make out all the words.
2671640	2681680	Always about you don't lay and Ashley and have the time to think.
2681680	2682960	Just can't anymore.
2682960	2688240	He is talking to his girlfriend.
2688240	2693120	It's not dick on 69.
2693120	2694440	Come on.
2694440	2701120	I'm not that cringed.
2701120	2703640	If you loved us, you'd make a deliberately easy password.
2703640	2704640	It is.
2704640	2706640	It is an easy password.
2706640	2708080	It is an easy password.
2708080	2715920	It's my, um, it's my school password from like when we had computer class in like second
2715920	2716920	grade.
2716920	2721920	It's the same password from all the way back then because I still remember it.
2721920	2728920	I might be stupid, but I still have okay memory.
2728920	2734800	It is not password 1234 shut up.
2734800	2735800	So that's it then.
2735800	2737800	Now it's quite on both ends.
2737800	2739840	All right, I guess.
2739840	2741840	What else is there to say?
2741840	2742840	Sorry.
2742840	2749480	I should really, I really don't see why I should be held accountable for a faint beep beep beep
2749480	2751840	of a dropped call can be heard.
2751840	2752840	Ah.
2752840	2753840	Sorry.
2753840	2754840	What was it?
2754840	2755840	My ex-girlfriend apparently.
2755840	2756840	Ooh, she dumped you.
2756840	2757840	Why is that?
2757840	2758840	Why do you think?
2758840	2759840	How should I know?
2759840	2764840	Maybe because you're a person-infested home buddy that's apparently permacore.
2764840	2767840	Or because she found someone new.
2767840	2770840	It's been a few months, buddy.
2770840	2773840	Or maybe she just didn't like talking to you.
2773840	2777840	Or maybe she just didn't like you that much in the first place.
2777840	2780840	Whatever you say, Ashley.
2780840	2787840	It might have been something more tact-ta- tactful to say.
2787840	2794840	Yeah, he only needs me anyways.
2794840	2796840	It doesn't matter.
2796840	2800840	You don't need a freaking girlfriend.
2800840	2801840	Whatever.
2801840	2806840	You pretend to sleep until you really fall asleep again.
2806840	2809840	Now you've been out for a while.
2810840	2811840	Whatever.
2811840	2816840	You pretend to sleep until you really fall asleep again.
2816840	2819840	Now you've been out for who knows how long.
2819840	2824840	You figure you should check on your brother.
2824840	2828840	A VHS player cannot be eaten.
2828840	2830840	I wouldn't try to eat- oh!
2830840	2831840	Don't jump!
2831840	2832840	Don't jump!
2832840	2833840	Don't jump!
2833840	2835840	Someone from your apartment is getting hauled into an ambulance.
2835840	2836840	Hey, me too!
2836840	2838840	People are yelling from their windows and balconies.
2838840	2840840	I need some help too.
2840840	2841840	Please, please.
2841840	2842840	I'm starving.
2842840	2854840	Soon the ambulance leaves in a hurry.
2854840	2856840	Technically anything can be eaten.
2856840	2860840	If you're brave enough, anything can be eaten, and anything can be a dildo.
2860840	2862840	If you're brave enough.
2862840	2864840	Soon the ambulance leaves in a hurry.
2864840	2866840	Wee!
2866840	2869840	Telling me surprise, they actually got that person some help.
2869840	2871840	I figured they'd just let her die.
2871840	2872840	Maybe she did die.
2872840	2874840	She wasn't moving.
2874840	2878840	As if they'd have their sirens blaring for a corpse.
2878840	2881840	Then what do you suppose was her emergency?
2881840	2882840	No idea.
2882840	2885840	Nobody showed up when you fainted.
2885840	2887840	Well, did you call for anyone?
2887840	2890840	What do you think, dumbass?
2890840	2892840	I don't know.
2892840	2894840	Maybe she went into labor or something.
2894840	2898840	Yeah, maybe.
2898840	2901840	I think they'd bring me food if I got pregnant.
2901840	2902840	No.
2902840	2904840	Let me finish.
2904840	2906840	How'd you even get pregnant in here?
2906840	2910840	Well, we do have that one charming fellow right next door.
2910840	2912840	Over my dead body.
2912840	2916840	You're the only one that's supposed to get me pregnant.
2916840	2921840	He seemed a little off his rocker, so who knows, he might just end you.
2921840	2923840	Forget this.
2928840	2932840	Well, excuse the hell out of me for exploring my options here.
2932840	2934840	That woman didn't look pregnant anyways.
2934840	2939840	Whatever, it's just a thought, jackass.
2939840	2944840	You'd like to go after Andrew and tell him it ain't none of his damn business anyways,
2944840	2947840	but you're just too exhausted.
2952840	2958840	He was feeling a little jealous, wasn't he?
2958840	2962840	After sleeping for a few hours, maybe a few days, who knows,
2962840	2966840	you're fully revitalized and bursting with energy.
2966840	2968840	Am I?
2968840	2971840	I don't think I am.
2971840	2976840	Yeah, if you keep making babies, you'll have infinite food because you can eat the babies.
2976840	2979840	Oh, you silly lazy bones.
2979840	2983840	What day is it? How long have you been locked in your apartment now?
2983840	2987840	Where the hell does Andrew get the energy to make so much noise?
2990840	2992840	Is he gonna break out?
2992840	2995840	I'm gonna screw the lock and his attempting to kick the door in.
2999840	3002840	Or out, depending on your perspective.
3002840	3004840	How many more times are you gonna try that?
3004840	3007840	It's clearly borrowed from the other side.
3007840	3010840	What else am I supposed to do?
3010840	3015840	If you don't stop banging on the door, I won't bring you any food tonight.
3015840	3017840	You won't either way, says you.
3017840	3023840	The delivery will be here in a matter of hours.
3023840	3026840	But I guess you don't want anything.
3026840	3028840	Yeah, that's right.
3028840	3032840	You better stop banging, banging, banging on that door.
3032840	3035840	Bounce, bounce, bounce it on my wood.
3035840	3038840	I'm tired from bouncing on my wood all the time.
3040840	3042840	You have to wait around nine months, though.
3042840	3043840	You're right, you're right.
3043840	3046840	It's not really an infinite food glitch, is it?
3050840	3052840	You guys, what do you mean, ay-yo, what?
3052840	3055840	Do you guys not watch anything on the internet?
3055840	3057840	You don't know any memes?
3057840	3059840	Could you give me some juice?
3059840	3062840	What do you mean, some juice?
3062840	3064840	Some eminade, is that what you mean?
3067840	3071840	The warden doesn't like hearing the pets squeak at night.
3074840	3075840	Are you gay?
3075840	3077840	Why are you acting so gay?
3077840	3080840	Oh, thank you for the three dollars, Anonymous, thank you.
3080840	3082840	Shut up with my two inch wood!
3082840	3084840	It's bigger than two inch!
3084840	3086840	Stop it!
3087840	3091840	It's gonna feel way bigger than two inch when you're bouncing on it.
3092840	3094840	Cough, cough, cough.
3095840	3097840	The man's footsteps fade away.
3097840	3101840	Do you think they'll really get that delivery today?
3101840	3104840	Like, I didn't even fuck this up for us, did I?
3104840	3106840	Unlikely.
3106840	3108840	Oh, I guess we'll see.
3108840	3110840	And see you did!
3110840	3112840	But absolutely nothing was delivered.
3112840	3114840	Si.
3114840	3116840	Talk about something!
3116840	3118840	I got nothing. Try.
3123840	3131840	Yeah, don't give me any ideas for Patreon food content.
3135840	3137840	So, parasites.
3137840	3139840	It's been a few months, are you feeling anything?
3139840	3140840	Hunger?
3140840	3144840	You'd think something would happen to us by now, but I haven't noticed anything.
3144840	3146840	The nurse never came back either.
3146840	3148840	Like, don't you want to monitor us?
3148840	3150840	Ugh, who cares?
3150840	3152840	Me, Ashley, I care.
3152840	3153840	Well, I don't.
3153840	3156840	Care, nor care that you care.
3162840	3167840	I can't believe that two people this hot would not sleep together after months of being trapped.
3168840	3171840	You've been, you've been normie-pilled, apparently.
3171840	3173840	Because, um...
3174840	3176840	Wait, no, not normie-pilled.
3177840	3179840	Their brother and sister get normie-pilled.
3179840	3182840	Of course they haven't slept together!
3184840	3186840	They're normies.
3196840	3197840	They should, though.
3197840	3199840	Don't worry, we'll make it happen together.
3199840	3202840	Aside from starving, it's not so bad here.
3202840	3204840	Come again?
3204840	3206840	Aside from starving, I like it here.
3206840	3208840	Well, I don't.
3208840	3210840	I want to jump off the balcony.
3210840	3212840	Ooh, I'll race you.
3212840	3214840	No, seriously, let's go.
3214840	3215840	Let's not, though.
3215840	3217840	I appreciate your eagerness to join me.
3217840	3219840	Are they normies?
3219840	3221840	I don't know, I just started the game, I just got here.
3221840	3223840	Are they not normies?
3224840	3228840	After the first month or so, they wouldn't care anymore, right?
3230840	3232840	Oh my god.
3232840	3234840	Your brain has been rotted by porn.
3236840	3239840	Come on, guys, use your coffin sets!
3242840	3245840	But it's a bit too romantic, so I'll pass.
3245840	3247840	Excuse me?
3247840	3248840	What, you don't see it?
3248840	3250840	Just imagine hitting the ground together.
3250840	3252840	Oh, fuck!
3252840	3256840	And with such force, our bodies would turn into a pile of gory mush,
3256840	3258840	never to be separated.
3258840	3260840	Our remains would get so tangled up,
3260840	3262840	we'd have to bury us together in the same coffin.
3262840	3264840	Hot!
3264840	3265840	Might as well.
3265840	3268840	We've been confined together in this coffin of an apartment
3268840	3270840	for what feels like an eternity already.
3270840	3273840	I'm not jumping off the balcony with you.
3273840	3275840	Get your head checked.
3275840	3277840	I should get my head checked?
3278840	3280840	He said the line, what line?
3284840	3286840	Do you mean how is that hot?
3286840	3288840	It's hot.
3288840	3290840	It's hot!
3292840	3294840	No wonder your girlfriend dumped you.
3294840	3296840	If those are your plans for romance, oh wait, hold on.
3296840	3299840	Let me have a- let me get a cough drop.
3299840	3301840	He said the title?
3301840	3304840	Oh, coffin of an ab-
3304840	3306840	The title is the coffin of-
3306840	3308840	Oh, is the coffin-
3308840	3311840	Is the coffin the apartment?
3312840	3314840	Is that the coffin?
3319840	3322840	Yeah, being forever- forever un-
3322840	3325840	Yeah, forever inseparable from your loving sister wife.
3325840	3327840	It is hot.
3327840	3330840	Oh, that makes sense.
3330840	3332840	I don't know, I just got here.
3332840	3334840	Okay, that makes sense.
3334840	3336840	That makes sense, I think.
3339840	3341840	Not romance, I said romantic.
3341840	3343840	They're not the same thing.
3343840	3345840	Romantic just means something is-
3345840	3347840	The neighbor starts blasting his favorite ritual music
3347840	3349840	for all to hear.
3349840	3351840	Again, I wish he'd just-
3355840	3357840	Did it work?
3357840	3359840	You feel like you should check up on that.
3364840	3367840	Hello, Sheevee, my adorable sister wife, hello.
3369840	3371840	My mommy wife is here.
3371840	3374840	My mommy wife is here.
3381840	3384840	Um, okay, let's go check on the neighbor, I guess.
3388840	3390840	Hultus, my lord, you've come.
3390840	3393840	And you're a little smaller than I imagined.
3395840	3398840	I- I love it, it's better than I imagined.
3398840	3400840	That's all I meant.
3400840	3402840	That's what she said.
3402840	3404840	What do you offer, human?
3404840	3406840	Oh, um, I don't have much to give right now.
3406840	3408840	But if you help me get out of here,
3408840	3410840	I can get you anything you wish.
3412840	3414840	Is that no good?
3414840	3416840	As you wish, human.
3417840	3419840	My lord, thank you, thank you.
3420840	3422840	Parish.
3431840	3433840	What's bro cooking in there?
3433840	3435840	I don't know, darkness clouds your vision
3435840	3437840	and you can't see what's happening.
3437840	3439840	But time your vision returns, the entity has vanished.
3439840	3441840	Is he dead?
3441840	3443840	On the ground lay the lifeless body of the Hultus.
3443840	3445840	Let's go eat his dead body so that way we can-
3445840	3449840	that way we can, you know, live a little longer ourselves.
3449840	3452840	Am I already delirious or did you see that, too?
3455840	3457840	Not J-
3458840	3460840	I gotta be quiet when I say his name.
3460840	3463840	Do we, uh, do you want to check up on him?
3463840	3468840	Well, at the very least, I want to turn off that CD player.
3468840	3470840	That's what you're concerned about.
3470840	3474840	I'm not listening to this for the rest of my life, Andrew.
3474840	3477840	You make it sound like we're gonna die anyways.
3477840	3479840	Oh wait, any day now?
3479840	3481840	Well, aren't we?
3481840	3482840	Well, I'm not.
3482840	3484840	That's gotta be something.
3484840	3486840	This guy has-
3486840	3488840	There's gotta be something this guy has that we can eat.
3488840	3491840	Oh my god, I'm so fucking bad at reading.
3494840	3496840	Ooh, Berkeley-
3496840	3498840	Berkeley time.
3498840	3500840	Shut up. Let's get in there.
3500840	3502840	Let's get in there.
3502840	3504840	The doorknob taunts you from the other side of the cloud.
3504840	3506840	Break it. Break it.
3506840	3508840	Break it.
3508840	3510840	I need something to break it with.
3510840	3512840	Oh.
3512840	3515840	I need something to break it to see if there's any junk we can use to break in.
3518840	3520840	Use the ashrite.
3520840	3522840	Oh.
3522840	3524840	Break it. Break the door.
3524840	3526840	Door unlocked.
3526840	3528840	Eat his dead body.
3528840	3530840	That's a lot of meat, you think to yourself.
3530840	3532840	What?
3532840	3534840	A lot, apparently.
3534840	3536840	Is it still illegal if we didn't kill the guy?
3536840	3538840	Is what illegal?
3538840	3540840	Well, you know.
3540840	3542840	We can't eat him.
3542840	3544840	Isn't that why you were insinuating?
3544840	3546840	Nah, I was just making an observation.
3548840	3550840	But we can't.
3550840	3552840	If we do eat him, then that's it for us.
3552840	3554840	There's no way we wouldn't get caught once they finally let us out.
3554840	3556840	But it's not like we killed the guy.
3560840	3562840	Yeah, that's gotta be at least 10,000 calories.
3562840	3564840	It could last us a pretty good-
3564840	3566840	pretty long amount of time.
3566840	3568840	Let's eat his meat.
3568840	3570840	Well, I think they should look past it.
3570840	3572840	Given that there's nothing else to eat.
3572840	3574840	Well, the staff here admit that they didn't give us food though.
3574840	3576840	And before that, you're going to tell them-
3576840	3578840	Are you gay?
3578840	3580840	Why are you acting so gay?
3580840	3582840	My old rat, Richard, Spanish is poorly from his cage made to bullying him.
3582840	3584840	Can I get some sisterly emergency to boost his recovery?
3584840	3586840	He's poorly?
3586840	3588840	He's poorly?
3588840	3590840	He's poorly.
3590840	3592840	He's poorly.
3592840	3594840	He's poorly.
3594840	3596840	He's poorly?
3600840	3602840	Cut the bullies' balls off.
3606840	3610840	If you have problems with your male rats bullying each other, cut their balls off.
3610840	3612840	And then you'll be fine.
3612840	3614840	Okay?
3614840	3616840	That's my sisterly advice.
3616840	3618840	And it's true.
3618840	3620840	It works.
3620840	3622840	Doctors don't want you to know this one life hack
3622840	3624840	to stop bullying in rats.
3628840	3630840	Yeah, it works.
3632840	3634840	There you go.
3634840	3636840	I'm not talking from experience
3636840	3638840	because I've never owned male rats
3638840	3640840	because I don't like their balls.
3640840	3642840	And I'm not going to pay
3642840	3644840	to get every single rat I owned
3644840	3646840	balls cut off.
3646840	3648840	So that's why I stick to girls.
3648840	3650840	Worked on my brother too.
3650840	3652840	I should try it on you,
3652840	3654840	see if it works on you
3654840	3656840	to make you less aggressive.
3656840	3658840	And before that, you're going to tell them
3658840	3660840	a demon killed him, really?
3660840	3662840	That'll fly?
3662840	3664840	Listen, you're overthinking the hell out of this.
3664840	3666840	Are we doing this or not?
3668840	3670840	Andrew, I'm expecting an answer.
3670840	3672840	Wait, are they actually genuinely, like,
3672840	3674840	going to kill him?
3674840	3676840	Let me make that clear.
3676840	3678840	I'm not a rat.
3678840	3680840	You don't have to be a rat for me to cut your balls off.
3680840	3682840	We're not aggressive.
3682840	3684840	You can be.
3684840	3686840	You haven't seen my marshmallows, but I have.
3686840	3688840	Some of you are.
3688840	3690840	Some of you need your balls cut off.
3694840	3696840	Yeah.
3696840	3698840	Alright then, let's find something to butcher him with.
3698840	3700840	Oh god.
3700840	3702840	Are we actually doing this right now?
3706840	3708840	It should be in the kitchen. There's a knife right there, isn't there?
3708840	3710840	Isn't this a knife?
3710840	3712840	A cleaver.
3712840	3714840	The average human corpse
3714840	3716840	contains around
3716840	3718840	125,000 calories.
3718840	3720840	That'll last us a good amount of time.
3724840	3726840	She doesn't like the marrows it's in over.
3726840	3728840	I love them. Don't even worry about it.
3728840	3730840	I love them.
3730840	3732840	I'm just jorkin'.
3732840	3734840	So you get the arms, I'll handle the legs.
3736840	3738840	Wait, we're actually doing it?
3742840	3744840	Are we actually doing it?
3752840	3754840	Okay, I'll get the left one.
3758840	3760840	What the fuck?
3762840	3764840	Wait, it's just the illusion of choice.
3764840	3766840	It doesn't matter which arm we cut off first.
3766840	3768840	We can't carry him out in the open like this.
3768840	3770840	Just be quiet about it.
3770840	3772840	No, can you go get plastic bags or something?
3772840	3774840	I'll take care of the rest in the meanwhile,
3774840	3776840	but I'm counting on you, Andy.
3776840	3778840	Don't call me that.
3780840	3782840	Hand him the cleaver.
3782840	3784840	I guess we're going to get plastic bags
3784840	3786840	to put his dead body in.
3788840	3790840	Yeah, dinner's served!
3790840	3792840	Yummy, yummy, yummy.
3792840	3794840	It's our neighbor,
3794840	3796840	Chaky.
3796840	3798840	I've been saying his name really loudly,
3798840	3800840	but he could probably hear me.
3800840	3802840	Well, I guess he's dead in the game, but yeah.
3806840	3808840	Where's the bags?
3808840	3810840	Wait, where's the bags?
3810840	3812840	They were in the bathroom, right?
3814840	3816840	Girl dinner!
3816840	3818840	Girl dinner! Girl dinner!
3818840	3820840	It's time for girl dinner,
3820840	3822840	and I guess boy dinner since
3822840	3824840	Andy's here too.
3824840	3826840	Here you go.
3826840	3828840	Oh, you got his legs. Good job.
3828840	3830840	Oh, fuck.
3830840	3832840	Oh, my God.
3832840	3834840	This is so fucked up.
3834840	3836840	A small problem presents itself.
3836840	3838840	The plastic bags aren't big enough
3838840	3840840	to fit the whole torso.
3840840	3842840	Time to cut his head off, too.
3842840	3844840	Ahem.
3846840	3848840	This is actually
3848840	3850840	my first time cutting up a dead body,
3850840	3852840	believe it or not, yep.
3852840	3854840	I don't think we can cut through the spine.
3854840	3856840	Just fold him over.
3856840	3858840	I don't think that's going to work.
3858840	3860840	Watch and learn!
3860840	3862840	You see? Oh, this is so fucked up.
3862840	3864840	You see?
3864840	3866840	If anyone happens to be looking out
3866840	3868840	their window, it'll be a disaster.
3868840	3870840	Maybe if I use two bags?
3870840	3872840	Listen, this isn't going to...
3872840	3874840	Ta-da!
3878840	3880840	Good God, no.
3880840	3882840	Don't make me laugh at this.
3882840	3884840	I don't have the power to make you do anything, Andrew.
3884840	3886840	All right, all right, enough.
3886840	3888840	Gather the limbs up and go.
3888840	3890840	There should be plenty room
3890840	3892840	for them in our freezer.
3892840	3894840	I'll stuff the torso
3894840	3896840	and head in his freezer for now.
3900840	3902840	Big brain.
3902840	3904840	I know such cute sibling bonds.
3904840	3906840	Oh my God.
3906840	3908840	What a cute little date for them.
3908840	3910840	I'll go cook...
3910840	3912840	I'll go cook us something while you're at it.
3912840	3914840	Yeah, you'll cook quite the something.
3918840	3920840	Okay.
3922840	3924840	First time cutting up a dead body,
3924840	3926840	so the others were alive.
3926840	3928840	Yep, the others were alive while I cut them up
3928840	3930840	and they screamed very loudly.
3930840	3932840	How do I cook?
3932840	3934840	How do I cook?
3934840	3936840	Let me cook.
3936840	3938840	What's that noise? Is he still cutting him up?
3938840	3940840	Can I turn chewing?
3944840	3946840	You like the sound of that?
3948840	3950840	How am I supposed to...
3950840	3952840	Am I supposed to cook him in his own house?
3952840	3954840	That's kind of disrespectful, isn't it?
3954840	3956840	To the dead?
3956840	3958840	To cut him up
3958840	3960840	and then cook him in his own house?
3962840	3964840	Oh, am I supposed to put him in the freezer?
3964840	3966840	Pass me the candy? You want it?
3968840	3970840	Open your mouth, I'll give it to you.
3970840	3972840	Ready?
3976840	3978840	I'll pass it from my mouth to yours.
3982840	3984840	Should I put him in the freezer?
3984840	3986840	Oh, there we go.
3986840	3988840	Which one do I want to eat?
3992840	3994840	Okay, here you go.
4000840	4002840	Make sure you suck on it really well, okay?
4008840	4010840	Go for the leg?
4010840	4012840	Left leg.
4014840	4016840	Okay, leg, leg, leg.
4016840	4018840	Okay.
4018840	4020840	All right, time to cook.
4020840	4022840	What are we going to make?
4022840	4024840	You fry some meat.
4024840	4026840	Dinner is ready.
4026840	4028840	Right, so what are we having here?
4028840	4030840	Pure deliciousness is what.
4030840	4032840	Eat up.
4032840	4034840	You first. Munch, munch.
4034840	4036840	Huh? What?
4036840	4038840	Oh, you already... okay.
4038840	4040840	Eat, Andrew. You will not waste this.
4040840	4042840	Um, right.
4043840	4045840	Andrew takes a bite of your cookie.
4047840	4049840	I don't think he likes it.
4049840	4051840	He begins retching.
4051840	4053840	Oh my god, she's just like me.
4053840	4055840	She can't cook.
4055840	4057840	No kiss to pass it?
4057840	4059840	I already passed it to you.
4059840	4062840	Maybe if I eat another one, I'll give you a kiss to pass it on.
4067840	4069840	Thigh is the best part?
4069840	4071840	That's true. But this is a man.
4072840	4074840	I like girls thighs more.
4079840	4081840	Yeah, do what your sister says.
4083840	4085840	Man, these fucking pictures.
4086840	4088840	Oh my god.
4089840	4091840	Swallow.
4091840	4093840	All of it.
4095840	4096840	Gold.
4096840	4098840	Why is there so much sexual tension right now?
4099840	4101840	Mm-mm, delicious.
4108840	4111840	Not the first time she said that to him.
4111840	4113840	Well, how is it?
4113840	4115840	It's...
4115840	4117840	God, I hate picky eaters.
4117840	4119840	Aw, fuck, I'm a picky eater.
4119840	4121840	I made this with love.
4121840	4124840	So you're not leaving the table before you lick the plate clean.
4124840	4126840	Quit your nagging woman.
4126840	4128840	Or just like a couple.
4128840	4131840	Then quit your gagging, you big baby.
4133840	4135840	Now call him a good boy?
4135840	4137840	Good boy.
4137840	4139840	I'll eat it, alright? Just give me a minute.
4139840	4141840	Yeah, yeah, yeah, eat it.
4141840	4144840	Under your watchful eye, he slowly finishes his plate.
4144840	4147840	Good boy, I am so proud.
4147840	4150840	Just fuck off, Ashley.
4150840	4153840	What an odd way to say thank you.
4153840	4155840	Yeah, yeah, thanks a bunch.
4155840	4157840	I'll clear the table, so leave me alone.
4157840	4159840	God, he's so emo.
4159840	4161840	We've got a very limited set of spaces left.
4161840	4163840	So what do you think I should try next?
4163840	4165840	Like, I don't know, maybe coriander?
4165840	4167840	Oh my God, I have such a funny story for that!
4167840	4170840	Okay, wait, actually pause. I want to tell you a funny story.
4172840	4174840	Let me tell you this story.
4177840	4179840	Okay, no, I want to be up close.
4179840	4181840	I want to be up close and personal for this.
4181840	4184840	Let me make my model go in front of chat.
4185840	4187840	Okay, so when I was in high school,
4187840	4190840	I went to a sleepover with my friends.
4190840	4193840	And we did that one.
4193840	4198840	My friend had one of those microphones
4198840	4203840	with the headphones plugged into them,
4203840	4205840	and it's supposed to be that challenge
4205840	4209840	where you're supposed to say a paragraph,
4209840	4212840	and you can hear yourself talking, but it's delayed.
4212840	4214840	So the challenge is like, you know,
4214840	4216840	boop, you booping me?
4216840	4219840	What are you booping me for?
4219840	4222840	But the challenge is basically talk clearly, and that's it.
4222840	4225840	You just, whenever you hear the other person talk with it,
4225840	4227840	it's just funny, that's all.
4229840	4231840	Boop my snoop.
4231840	4233840	Boop me.
4233840	4235840	I'm ready for the boop.
4237840	4239840	Okay, um, anyways.
4243840	4246840	So we were taking turns to, you know,
4246840	4251840	do the challenge of like speaking clearly with a delayed,
4251840	4254840	what's it called, a delayed audio of our voices.
4254840	4256840	I know I'm explaining it badly,
4256840	4258840	but basically when it was my turn,
4258840	4260840	I decided to do a copy pasta.
4260840	4263840	I decided to say a copy pasta.
4263840	4267840	And the copy pasta was the one of the guy
4267840	4271840	who was pretending to sell weed to his school,
4271840	4274840	like to his classmates at school,
4274840	4277840	but in reality he was just selling them oregano.
4278840	4281840	And I had never seen the word oregano before.
4284840	4287840	So when it was my turn to read my copy pasta,
4287840	4290840	I said oregano the entire time,
4290840	4293840	and I just pronounced it oregano.
4294840	4299840	The whole time they didn't know I was selling them oregano.
4303840	4305840	Oh sorry, I turned off the desktop audio
4305840	4306840	so you could hear me talk.
4306840	4309840	Thank you for the tip discomancer.
4310840	4312840	Oregano.
4312840	4314840	And now I still have the video of me,
4314840	4316840	of me, because they recorded me
4316840	4318840	and I still have the video of me just saying
4318840	4320840	and I was selling them,
4320840	4322840	I was packaging oregano
4322840	4327840	and selling it to my classmates.
4332840	4334840	Do you want me to post a copy pasta for you to read?
4334840	4336840	Surely it won't be something bad.
4337840	4339840	If it's not something bad, go ahead.
4339840	4341840	How do you say munic?
4341840	4342840	Munich?
4342840	4343840	Munich?
4343840	4344840	I don't know.
4346840	4347840	That's the British...
4347840	4350840	Wait, oregano is actually pronounced oregano
4350840	4352840	in British terms?
4353840	4354840	Are you gay?
4354840	4356840	Why are you acting so gay?
4356840	4357840	Oregano.
4357840	4359840	Yeah, I know it's oregano.
4359840	4361840	But now I sometimes just say oregano
4361840	4363840	to make people mad because I think it's funny.
4367840	4368840	She says it like,
4368840	4370840	how are you supposed to say it?
4373840	4374840	Leak the audio.
4374840	4376840	Yeah, no.
4376840	4377840	No.
4378840	4381840	Anyways, coriander?
4384840	4386840	Alright, I'll try some of that tomorrow.
4386840	4388840	I'm off to bed now, goodnight.
4388840	4389840	Night night.
4389840	4390840	Okay.
4390840	4392840	Where's the bedroom?
4394840	4395840	What is that sound alert?
4395840	4396840	It's just my sound alert.
4396840	4397840	What do you mean?
4397840	4399840	It's my sound alert.
4403840	4404840	How do I sleep?
4404840	4405840	Is this not my...
4405840	4406840	Oh, these are the parents' bedroom.
4406840	4408840	Oh, sorry, that's the parents' bedroom.
4411840	4412840	You were correct, just British.
4412840	4413840	Wow, that's crazy.
4416840	4417840	I was British all along
4417840	4418840	and I didn't even know it.
4424840	4426840	Said she likes you.
4426840	4427840	Who?
4427840	4429840	My friend from school.
4429840	4431840	Or at least I thought she was a friend.
4431840	4432840	So are you gonna...
4432840	4434840	Are you gonna be her boyfriend?
4434840	4435840	Gross?
4435840	4436840	No.
4437840	4439840	I should teach her a lesson.
4441840	4442840	Oh my god.
4443840	4445840	You're my brother, mine.
4446840	4447840	I'll make her think twice
4447840	4449840	before stealing from another woman.
4449840	4450840	Oh my god.
4450840	4452840	Oh yeah, you're a girl too.
4452840	4454840	What's that supposed to mean?
4455840	4458840	Somehow you don't count as a lady in my mind.
4459840	4462840	Or as a person for that matter.
4465840	4468840	Screw you.
4468840	4471840	I am the most personous lady in the world.
4471840	4472840	So anyways,
4472840	4474840	I'm gonna take her to that old warehouse
4474840	4476840	and lock her in one of the crates.
4477840	4478840	Yeah, yeah.
4478840	4479840	Seriously.
4480840	4481840	Mom gave me some money
4481840	4482840	to go buy groceries.
4482840	4483840	Are you coming with?
4483840	4484840	Focus, Andy.
4484840	4486840	Let's leave her sitting there all night.
4486840	4487840	That'll show her.
4487840	4488840	Let's not.
4490840	4491840	You should go ask her to hang out.
4491840	4493840	She won't say no then.
4494840	4496840	Lately, I don't want to.
4497840	4500840	Just go over and ask her to come with you.
4510840	4512840	I feel like you almost said this exactly.
4512840	4514840	I've never said that before.
4514840	4516840	But I'm saying it now.
4517840	4518840	Take her to the warehouse
4518840	4520840	and we'll see what happens.
4520840	4521840	Come on.
4521840	4523840	Mom said you'd help me with anything.
4525840	4527840	I thought she's your friend.
4527840	4529840	Well, I thought so too.
4530840	4533840	And she can be my friend again afterwards.
4533840	4535840	She just needs a reminder
4535840	4536840	of how to do it properly.
4537840	4538840	Well, get in trouble.
4539840	4540840	I'll only let her out
4540840	4542840	when she promises not to tell on us.
4547840	4549840	She's been getting tips from Mercy.
4549840	4551840	I'll let you in on a little secret,
4551840	4553840	but I don't need tips from Mercy.
4555840	4557840	It's all coming from me.
4559840	4560840	Sai.
4560840	4562840	Do it, Andy.
4562840	4563840	I guess.
4563840	4565840	Hooray! You're the best!
4565840	4567840	Today's episode is titled
4567840	4570840	Andy and Lately and the Bitch in a Box.
4570840	4572840	One day, you'll be in a bitch in a box
4572840	4574840	and your friends will take turns
4574840	4575840	pissing on the ground above.
4575840	4577840	Oh my god, what the fuck?
4578840	4580840	What do I do about these hussies around you?
4581840	4584840	Where do you learn these words?
4584840	4586840	The bitch is you.
4586840	4588840	I'll take you out to play
4588840	4590840	and then when I'm done,
4590840	4592840	it's back into the box with you.
4594840	4595840	I really ought to kick your ass
4595840	4597840	one of these days.
4597840	4598840	Huh?
4602840	4604840	Yeah, who do you think taught Mercy?
4604840	4605840	What?
4608840	4610840	What is taking him?
4610840	4612840	What is taking him?
4612840	4613840	What?
4613840	4616840	He wouldn't have forgotten our plans, would he?
4616840	4617840	Grr.
4618840	4619840	Is he coming?
4619840	4620840	Finally!
4628840	4629840	Huh?
4629840	4630840	What are you doing here?
4630840	4631840	Surprise!
4631840	4633840	I want to hang out too.
4633840	4634840	Oh.
4635840	4637840	I mean, I guess that's fine.
4638840	4640840	Say, did you tell your mommy you're here?
4640840	4642840	No, why?
4642840	4644840	Just wondering.
4644840	4646840	I mean, I'm surprised she let you come
4646840	4648840	hang out with a boy.
4648840	4651840	No way, she thinks I went to study with Julia.
4651840	4653840	But why are you here, Ashley?
4654840	4656840	Divine intervention.
4656840	4658840	What's that even mean?
4658840	4661840	It means she's full of crap, don't listen.
4661840	4664840	So, are we going inside or what?
4665840	4667840	Is that allowed?
4669840	4671840	These flags be crimson?
4671840	4673840	Ignore them.
4673840	4677840	Just put on some rose-tinted glasses, okay?
4677840	4679840	They're not real.
4679840	4681840	You're being a little crazy right now.
4682840	4683840	I love it.
4683840	4685840	Let's find a way in right now.
4687840	4689840	Where are we going in a box?
4690840	4691840	Box?
4691840	4692840	Get in the box?
4692840	4693840	Get in the box, bitch.
4693840	4695840	Get in the box.
4695840	4697840	Wait, I'm confused.
4701840	4702840	Oh, shit.
4702840	4704840	Are we actually going to nail her into a box?
4706840	4709840	The drop off on the other side of the window is too high.
4710840	4712840	Though I wouldn't mind convincing Blanc-
4712840	4714840	Blanc- Blanc.
4715840	4717840	Let me take another cough drop.
4718840	4720840	Yeah, luckily you're colorblind.
4720840	4723840	Did you know it's more common for dudes to be colorblind?
4723840	4725840	Isn't that so lucky for me?
4732840	4734840	We're just Lillie, Leigh, Ann, and Amy Beacons.
4734840	4736840	We are one.
4736840	4740840	There is no ending in beginning to us because we are one and the same.
4741840	4745840	I wouldn't mind convincing Blanc to jump anyways.
4745840	4747840	To maybe twist her ankle.
4747840	4749840	Maybe break her neck.
4749840	4751840	Is something wrong?
4751840	4753840	Nah, but we can't go in this way.
4759840	4762840	Why did they nail this metal sheet thing on the wall?
4762840	4763840	Are you gay?
4763840	4765840	Why are you acting so gay?
4765840	4767840	They're not red flags.
4767840	4769840	They're fun facts.
4774840	4776840	They're just fun facts.
4776840	4778840	50 fun facts you didn't know about, Amy,
4778840	4781840	but you're about to learn right now in this stream.
4788840	4790840	What's Ouroboros?
4790840	4792840	Is that, that sounds familiar.
4792840	4794840	What's Ouroboros?
4794840	4796840	Ouroboros?
4798840	4801840	Looks like there's a hole behind it.
4801840	4802840	Perfect.
4802840	4803840	Tear it open.
4803840	4804840	What?
4804840	4805840	I can't do that.
4805840	4806840	It's okay.
4806840	4807840	I won't tell anyone.
4807840	4809840	As in, I literally can't do it dumbass.
4809840	4811840	Not without some tools at least.
4811840	4812840	Huh.
4812840	4814840	Even though it's this flimsy?
4814840	4815840	Yes.
4815840	4817840	Bro, what a weak little bitch boy.
4817840	4819840	I like smart guys over beefy ones.
4819840	4821840	Shut up, bitch!
4821840	4823840	That's my man!
4823840	4825840	Who asked?
4827840	4830840	Wait, so we need more tools?
4830840	4832840	What about this thing?
4832840	4834840	A steel mallet.
4834840	4836840	I can't really think of a way a mallet
4836840	4838840	would be useful to us in this situation.
4838840	4840840	I sure can.
4843840	4845840	Ouroborialis?
4845840	4847840	Is that what Ouroboros means?
4847840	4850840	Oh, snake eating its own tail.
4850840	4852840	That's what it means?
4853840	4855840	Mmm.
4858840	4859840	Mmm, mmm.
4859840	4860840	Yes, yes.
4860840	4863840	Yes, the Ouroboros of Emi and Lele.
4863840	4865840	Yeah, that's what we are.
4868840	4871840	Does it help us get in the warehouse?
4871840	4872840	Oh my god.
4872840	4873840	Wait, I have to fart.
4873840	4875840	Hold on, hold on, I have to fart.
4879840	4881840	Fuck.
4881840	4883840	God damn it.
4884840	4886840	It's not coming out.
4887840	4889840	My butthole got shy.
4889840	4891840	Damn it.
4891840	4894840	I literally stood up from my chair
4894840	4896840	and turned around so I could face them like
4896840	4899840	and then I didn't want to come out.
4901840	4903840	God damn it.
4903840	4905840	I'm sorry, boys.
4905840	4907840	Next time, we'll get them next time.
4907840	4909840	Right in my face, do it.
4909840	4912840	I tried, I wouldn't come out.
4912840	4914840	I can't even, I can't even do it.
4914840	4916840	I can't even do it.
4917840	4919840	It got shy, I'm sorry.
4920840	4923840	Okay, let's continue.
4930840	4932840	Okay.
4932840	4935840	Why is my chat frozen on my phone?
4937840	4939840	Am I going to be the first farter?
4939840	4942840	I was not, I was not the first farter.
4942840	4944840	Okay, here we go.
4946840	4948840	Oh, Lay Lay, I don't even want to know
4948840	4950840	what you had in mind.
4950840	4953840	What are you guys talking about?
4953840	4954840	It's nothing.
4954840	4956840	Let's keep looking.
4958840	4960840	The thing.
4961840	4964840	You use the back of the hammer to pull out the nails.
4966840	4970840	Cough, wow, it sure is cough cough kind of dusty in here.
4971840	4974840	First a fart first to win, what are we winning?
4974840	4976840	There needs to be a prize.
4977840	4979840	You gotta, you gotta kind of, you know.
4984840	4986840	I can't think of the word.
4990840	4993840	I'm trying to think of the word I want.
4995840	4997840	A kiss is a prize?
4997840	5001840	Okay, okay, I can compete for a kiss.
5001840	5003840	The sharp ender.
5004840	5007840	Makes me wonder about my, oh, makes me worry about my asthma.
5007840	5009840	It's fine, it's fine.
5009840	5011840	Oh, I know, how about some hide and seek?
5013840	5015840	Ugh, you're such a kid.
5015840	5016840	Huh?
5016840	5018840	Annie wants to play too.
5018840	5019840	You do?
5019840	5020840	What?
5020840	5021840	Oh yeah, sure.
5022840	5023840	See?
5023840	5026840	Well, I mean, it's fun every once in a while.
5026840	5028840	Oh my god, I hate her.
5028840	5032840	You totally want to, you totally wanted to play too, you child.
5032840	5034840	Albeit, I'm gonna count to ten.
5036840	5038840	Hundred, count to a hundred at least.
5038840	5039840	Okay.
5039840	5043840	One, two, alright, let's find a good box to shove in.
5045840	5047840	Don't tell her where that kiss is gonna be.
5049840	5050840	What?
5050840	5053840	You wouldn't kiss anywhere weird, right?
5053840	5055840	It's gonna be on the mouth, of course.
5059840	5060840	Okay.
5062840	5064840	You still want to do that?
5064840	5065840	Of course.
5065840	5067840	She said no one knows she's here.
5067840	5068840	It's perfect.
5068840	5070840	Lele, you promised.
5070840	5072840	Now hurry up, before she's done counting.
5073840	5074840	Where is she?
5074840	5075840	Where's the box?
5075840	5076840	Where is she?
5076840	5077840	How do I shove her in the box?
5077840	5078840	Put her in the box.
5078840	5080840	This container's already full.
5080840	5082840	There's no empty boxes.
5082840	5084840	Where do I put her?
5084840	5086840	There's no empty boxes.
5087840	5088840	Ah.
5088840	5090840	Oh, now this'll do.
5090840	5092840	There isn't any lock on it, though.
5092840	5093840	Well, we don't have it.
5093840	5095840	We don't actually have...
5095840	5096840	Ah!
5097840	5100840	Well, we don't actually want to lock her in.
5102840	5104840	You get forehead kisses at best?
5105840	5106840	Why?
5106840	5107840	Why?
5110840	5111840	Why?
5112840	5114840	Dummy kisses work too.
5117840	5121840	Yeah, on the lips.
5121840	5124840	I won't accept anything less than on the lips.
5127840	5128840	We don't have...
5128840	5129840	We don't...
5129840	5131840	Fuck, I can't fucking read.
5132840	5135840	We don't actually want to lock her in.
5135840	5137840	The hell we don't...
5137840	5139840	Place a stick or something between the rings.
5139840	5140840	That'll keep it closed.
5140840	5142840	Won't the stick just break?
5142840	5144840	No, well, if she's hunched inside,
5144840	5147840	I doubt she'd have leverage to...
5148840	5150840	Ready or not, here I come!
5151840	5153840	Oh, crap, she counts too fast.
5153840	5155840	It wasn't that fast, really.
5156840	5157840	Ahaha, let's hide.
5157840	5158840	Okay.
5158840	5159840	Wait, where do I hide?
5159840	5160840	Where do I hide?
5160840	5161840	In the box, right?
5162840	5163840	Fuck.
5170840	5171840	Where do I hide?
5171840	5172840	Here?
5175840	5176840	Tell me where to hide!
5179840	5180840	Ah!
5180840	5182840	Oh wait, I thought I saw her walk in.
5182840	5183840	Where do I hide?
5183840	5184840	Where do I hide?
5184840	5185840	Where do I hide?
5185840	5186840	Top right.
5191840	5192840	Here?
5194840	5196840	Where do we get a stick anyways?
5196840	5199840	Andy picks up whatever wooden debris is at his feet.
5200840	5201840	I guess this'll do.
5204840	5205840	Well...
5206840	5207840	What do you think?
5207840	5208840	Is she pretty?
5209840	5210840	A stick?
5210840	5212840	No, who do you think, dumbass?
5213840	5215840	Ah, she's fine, I guess.
5217840	5219840	He's supposed to say no.
5224840	5225840	Found you!
5226840	5227840	Both of you.
5227840	5230840	Who hides in the same spot, idiots?
5230840	5231840	SHUT UP, BITCH!
5232840	5234840	It was my spot first.
5234840	5235840	Then you're it.
5240840	5242840	Far through the crack in the box?
5244840	5245840	Yeah, I'm prettier.
5246840	5248840	Yes, yes, I'll go count.
5249840	5250840	Andy goes to count outside.
5252840	5254840	My hiding spots are the best.
5254840	5256840	I know a really good one.
5256840	5257840	Come take a look!
5258840	5259840	Um, okay.
5259840	5263840	Let's shove her in this fuckin' box.
5264840	5265840	Go hide in there.
5265840	5266840	I think you'll fit in here?
5266840	5268840	Seems like a bad idea.
5270840	5272840	It's coming, it's coming!
5273840	5275840	It was a silent fart, damn it.
5275840	5276840	Okay.
5276840	5277840	Seems like a bad idea.
5277840	5278840	Have so!
5278840	5280840	I'm gonna get my clothes dirty.
5281840	5283840	My mom does...
5283840	5284840	Oh wait, what?
5284840	5285840	I didn't see the previous message.
5285840	5286840	She'll get mad if I...
5286840	5287840	HUNDRED!
5287840	5289840	Oh shoot, he's coming, hurry, hurry!
5291840	5293840	I'm getting a phone call right now.
5293840	5294840	Decline.
5294840	5295840	Leave me alone.
5297840	5298840	Let me sniff.
5298840	5300840	There is nothing to sniff.
5300840	5301840	It doesn't even smell.
5301840	5303840	I don't smell anything.
5304840	5306840	First confirmed fart on stream?
5306840	5307840	If you believe me, yeah.
5309840	5311840	Shut up about vibrations!
5311840	5314840	It's not the kind of vibrations you think it is!
5314840	5317840	It's not the kind of vibrations you think it is!
5317840	5318840	It was my phone!
5322840	5324840	No, I'm not gonna answer it.
5324840	5326840	It said it was a survey.
5327840	5328840	Er, uh, okay.
5329840	5331840	Hey silly, your friend hops inside the crate.
5333840	5334840	Yup!
5334840	5335840	Huh? What was that?
5336840	5337840	I got you now!
5338840	5340840	Blank is too weak to throw you off the lid.
5340840	5342840	Cough, this isn't funny, Ashley.
5343840	5345840	She's gonna suffocate, isn't she?
5351840	5353840	Hello, Amy, hello.
5354840	5355840	She's gonna suffocate.
5356840	5358840	That magic wand of yours?
5358840	5359840	I haven't used that yet.
5359840	5361840	I will update you when I do use it though.
5361840	5362840	I will.
5363840	5364840	But no, it was just my phone.
5364840	5366840	Get your mind out of the gutter.
5367840	5369840	There you are, Andy, you slowpoke.
5369840	5371840	Hurry up, she's putting up a fight.
5372840	5373840	Cough, I can't breathe!
5373840	5375840	She's actually gonna suffocate!
5376840	5377840	She alright?
5377840	5378840	Cough, Cough, please, I-
5379840	5381840	Shut up already, you drama queen.
5381840	5382840	Let her out, Lele.
5383840	5384840	She's just pretending.
5384840	5386840	No one's ever died from some dust.
5388840	5389840	Just let her out.
5391840	5393840	What? You believe her over me?
5394840	5397840	It's not really about whether I believe her or not.
5398840	5399840	Fine, you let her out then.
5399840	5400840	Who cares about me anyways?
5402840	5403840	Cough, Cough.
5404840	5405840	Everyone likes her better,
5405840	5407840	but you like her better too.
5407840	5408840	But everyone does.
5408840	5409840	I already know.
5410840	5411840	Cough, Cough, Cough.
5414840	5416840	That's fiction, that's fiction.
5417840	5418840	That's f-
5419840	5420840	That's f-
5420840	5421840	A-
5421840	5422840	X-
5423840	5424840	A-
5424840	5428840	Asphyxiation, siblings, confinement, betrayal.
5428840	5429840	Nice tags.
5431840	5432840	I bet you-
5432840	5434840	I bet you'd rather have a girlfriend
5434840	5436840	than spend time with me, of course you would.
5437840	5439840	Oh, come on, I already told you I don't want.
5439840	5440840	And,
5440840	5441840	bet,
5441840	5442840	sniff,
5442840	5443840	I should say it.
5443840	5445840	I should voice act for hairlines, at least.
5445840	5446840	And I bet,
5446840	5448840	but you only want to hang out with me
5448840	5450840	because mom told you to.
5451840	5452840	Well, that's-
5452840	5454840	I mean, maybe she did, but-
5456840	5457840	It's not fair.
5458840	5459840	Cough, Cough, Cough.
5459840	5461840	Why does everyone like her better?
5462840	5463840	I'm loud and weird and annoying,
5463840	5465840	no one likes me at all.
5466840	5467840	I like you better, Lele.
5468840	5469840	Prove it,
5469840	5470840	liar.
5472840	5473840	Sigh.
5473840	5474840	I knew it.
5474840	5475840	I knew it.
5475840	5478840	Maybe you'd have more friends if you weren't always so-
5478840	5481840	Not even my own brother picks me over her!
5481840	5483840	I knew it already.
5484840	5485840	Did I not just say,
5485840	5486840	la, la, la,
5486840	5488840	talk sure is cheap.
5488840	5489840	God damn it.
5491840	5492840	Cough, Cough.
5493840	5494840	Crazy ass castling.
5496840	5497840	I mean, she's good at it,
5497840	5498840	she's good at what she does.
5499840	5500840	Cough, Cough.
5500840	5501840	Cough, Cough.
5503840	5504840	Cough, Cough.
5504840	5505840	Ash.
5507840	5508840	There.
5508840	5509840	Are you happy now?
5509840	5510840	Cough, Cough.
5510840	5511840	Yes.
5512840	5514840	Just until morning, okay?
5515840	5517840	Yes, yes, you're the best.
5517840	5519840	I like you the best, Andy.
5521840	5522840	You hear that, Blank?
5522840	5524840	You get to stay there until morning.
5524840	5526840	No, please.
5526840	5527840	Cough, Cough.
5527840	5528840	Ashley.
5529840	5531840	Yeah, that girl's gonna fucking die.
5533840	5534840	I mean, she kind of deserves it,
5534840	5535840	she was annoying.
5535840	5536840	Ashley, wait, don't-
5536840	5537840	Cough, Cough.
5537840	5538840	Go.
5538840	5539840	Ashley, please.
5539840	5540840	Ashley!
5541840	5542840	Ashley?
5542840	5543840	Will you wait?
5544840	5545840	I am now.
5548840	5549840	If you see my tongue sticking out,
5549840	5551840	it's because I'm kind of sticking out my tongue.
5551840	5552840	Cough, Cough.
5557840	5560840	Maybe she shouldn't have tried to seduce her big brother.
5560840	5562840	Well, maybe that bitch shouldn't have been such a bitch,
5562840	5564840	and then she wouldn't die.
5564840	5565840	Um, okay.
5565840	5566840	What is it?
5566840	5567840	Nothing, it's just-
5567840	5569840	God, what the fuck did we do?
5569840	5570840	You still on about dinner?
5570840	5571840	Fine, just starve then.
5571840	5572840	More for me.
5572840	5573840	How are you like this?
5573840	5574840	How are you-
5574840	5576840	Are you out of your mind?
5576840	5578840	Listen, I didn't kill the guy,
5578840	5580840	so I didn't do anything wrong.
5580840	5581840	You mutil-
5581840	5582840	You mutil-
5582840	5583840	You mutil-
5583840	5584840	You mutil-
5588840	5590840	You mutilated and ate a corpse, too!
5591840	5593840	What else were we supposed to do?
5594840	5596840	Call the warden and let him know he died?
5601840	5604840	Ashley is giving more of a sociopath than a psychopath?
5607840	5608840	She's a- what's it called?
5611840	5612840	S-
5612840	5613840	She's a psychosis.
5613840	5614840	That's what she's-
5614840	5615840	That's what she is.
5618840	5619840	Uh, yes.
5619840	5620840	Um, sir, we-
5620840	5621840	He summoned a demon and then died.
5621840	5622840	I swear we didn't do it.
5622840	5623840	Yeah.
5623840	5624840	I-
5624840	5626840	We wouldn't have had to admit we were there.
5627840	5628840	We couldn't-
5628840	5630840	We could've just told him to go check on that guy.
5630840	5632840	Andrew, what the hell?
5632840	5633840	What?
5633840	5634840	What the hell?
5634840	5635840	Didn't we both agree on this?
5635840	5637840	I could've sworn it was your suggestion in the first place.
5637840	5640840	She's so good at cast lighting!
5641840	5643840	Yeah, what a girl, boss.
5645840	5646840	I was hungry-
5646840	5648840	I was too hungry to think straight, okay?
5649840	5650840	Now that's some bullshit.
5650840	5652840	Fine, let's assume it was so.
5653840	5654840	What-
5654840	5656840	What do you want me to do about it?
5656840	5657840	I-
5657840	5659840	Woosh woosh, there goes my magic wand.
5661840	5662840	There.
5662840	5663840	I've absolved you of your sins.
5664840	5665840	You never took a bite now.
5668840	5669840	You're welcome.
5670840	5671840	Oh gee, thanks.
5672840	5673840	We'll see how-
5673840	5675840	We'll see how that holds in.
5677840	5679840	I'm sorry that I'm so dyslexic today.
5679840	5682840	I don't actually have dyslexia, surprisingly.
5682840	5685840	We'll see how that holds in the face of the law.
5685840	5686840	Listen, who cares?
5687840	5688840	Ugh!
5688840	5692840	Isn't this, like, some extreme circumstances stuff?
5693840	5694840	Like, can we be excused?
5694840	5696840	It's the water company's fault.
5696840	5698840	First they lock us in for months, and then we don't-
5698840	5700840	And then they won't even feed us.
5702840	5704840	And does Kevin fever a real thing?
5704840	5705840	Maybe we can plead insanity.
5706840	5707840	I don't know, Ashley.
5710840	5711840	Sounded out?
5713840	5715840	Thank you for being so patient.
5716840	5717840	She's an empath.
5722840	5723840	They're there.
5724840	5725840	You know what?
5726840	5727840	I couldn't get his head off.
5728840	5729840	Huh?
5729840	5731840	Like, he didn't fit in the freezer properly.
5732840	5735840	So I needed to chop his head off, but I couldn't cut it.
5735840	5736840	His spine was too-
5737840	5738840	Anyway, I kind of just-
5739840	5741840	Uh, like, kept cutting around and then pulled it off.
5742840	5743840	Like some plant.
5743840	5744840	I don't know.
5745840	5747840	I just keep thinking about it.
5748840	5750840	Ugh, I can't fucking sleep, Ashley.
5750840	5751840	It's-
5752840	5753840	Come here.
5756840	5757840	This is a little-
5759840	5761840	Oh my, they're sleeping in the same bed together?
5763840	5765840	Aw, thank you for all the encouragement.
5768840	5770840	I don't know what's wrong with you.
5771840	5772840	How are you so unbothered?
5773840	5779840	Moisturized, showered, um, cleansed, unbothered.
5780840	5782840	Sitting on my couch.
5783840	5785840	Reading incest.
5785840	5787840	I don't know, I compartmentalize.
5787840	5791840	Kind of like we compartmentalize that guy into different freezers.
5791840	5792840	Ashley!
5794840	5795840	Andrew, what is it, Andrew?
5797840	5798840	Oh my god!
5799840	5800840	Andrew!
5801840	5802840	Andrew.
5802840	5803840	Andy.
5803840	5804840	I-
5805840	5807840	I told you to stop calling me that.
5807840	5809840	We're not kids anymore.
5809840	5811840	Then why are you crying like such a baby?
5813840	5814840	Now kiss.
5817840	5820840	She's a woman, Andy. Consequences are ununtered.
5826840	5827840	I'm not crying.
5829840	5832840	Mommy, the big bad me did the evil thing.
5833840	5835840	You shut your own mouth.
5836840	5837840	Make me a little-
5838840	5840840	I was gonna say make me without actually reading it.
5840840	5842840	Make me a little bitch.
5843840	5844840	Forget this.
5846840	5848840	Why are they sort of goals though?
5848840	5849840	I know!
5850840	5852840	Hey Andy, remember when we used to go on adventures?
5852840	5853840	What?
5853840	5857840	Andy and Lay Lay's quest for something or another.
5857840	5859840	Something or another, remember?
5863840	5865840	Yeah, they have a second bed and they don't use it.
5867840	5869840	You're already in character.
5871840	5875840	I'm basically covering up her entire side, so, you know.
5876840	5878840	Just pretend I'm her.
5880840	5882840	Isn't this just another one of those?
5883840	5884840	I don't know.
5884840	5886840	Can you just play along for now?
5886840	5890840	Until we're out of this crappy situation, then we can unpack it all later?
5890840	5892840	Yeah, we'll go to therapy after this, don't worry.
5892840	5893840	Or not.
5893840	5896840	I don't think I will personally, but you can go to therapy.
5896840	5901840	Like, I could tell a therapist what I've been up to-
5901840	5904840	Oh, like I could tell a therapist what I've been up to.
5905840	5906840	Alright, just a thought.
5906840	5908840	Let's get out of here.
5908840	5910840	Oh, let's just get out of here.
5922840	5925840	He literally has screaming night terrors, does he?
5927840	5932840	Um, like we should have done months ago.
5932840	5935840	Now that we've got food, don't you want to keep waiting until they let us out?
5935840	5936840	Hell no, I don't.
5936840	5938840	They'll throw us in jail right after.
5939840	5941840	And I don't know which is worse.
5941840	5944840	Withering in this coffin of a house or getting railed in a prison?
5945840	5946840	Don't worry, Andy.
5946840	5948840	I'll be the one railing you in prison.
5949840	5950840	I see.
5950840	5954840	You want to escape not only this quarantine, but the consequences of her actions as well.
5955840	5956840	Preferably, yeah.
5957840	5961840	This episode is titled Andy and Laylee and the Escape from the Coffin.
5962840	5963840	Yeah, whatever.
5964840	5965840	I'm going to sleep now.
5967840	5968840	Promise.
5968840	5970840	I promise I'll be the one railing you in jail.
5971840	5972840	Bend over.
5972840	5973840	Drop the soap, okay?
5975840	5977840	Now with my two inch.
5978840	5980840	More than a two inch.
5981840	5982840	I'll try again.
5983840	5984840	I love you, Andy.
5985840	5987840	Shut that Andy junk up your ass already.
5988840	5989840	My God.
5989840	5990840	I don't love you that much.
5993840	5994840	You make me want to kill myself?
5995840	5996840	Too bad dividing.
5996840	6000840	Oh, too bad diving down the balcony is just too romantic for you.
6003840	6006840	A pillow hits you in the face so hard you see stars.
6006840	6007840	Two stars.
6010840	6016840	Your body has absorbed some delicious nutrients and you're feeling mighty better today.
6017840	6019840	Andy, where are you?
6022840	6023840	Dividing.
6023840	6024840	Shut up.
6024840	6025840	I'm bad at reading.
6025840	6026840	Where is this dude?
6030840	6031840	He's gone.
6032840	6033840	Is he on the balcony?
6034840	6035840	Wait, what?
6038840	6040840	What do you think of their relationship so far?
6040840	6041840	Goals.
6041840	6042840	Adorable.
6042840	6043840	Of course.
6052840	6054840	The freezer is full of delicious meat.
6054840	6055840	Yum, yum, yum.
6056840	6057840	Oh, is he in the neighbors?
6057840	6058840	Oh, okay.
6059840	6060840	Hello.
6061840	6062840	Hey there.
6062840	6063840	Good morning.
6063840	6064840	Whatcha up to?
6067840	6071840	I'm looking at this demon summoning instruction manual book thing.
6071840	6075840	Brave, given things turned out so well for that cultist guy.
6075840	6076840	It's okay, I can do it.
6076840	6077840	I'll help you.
6077840	6078840	I'll help you.
6078840	6079840	Debatable.
6079840	6083840	I mean, he was successful up to the point he lacked an offering.
6083840	6084840	Oh.
6084840	6087840	Anyways, it says here that demons don't think much of humans.
6087840	6088840	Well, that's good.
6088840	6090840	We'll have something in common then.
6090840	6091840	Yeah, yeah.
6091840	6095840	So they're only willing to do business as long as it's quick and easy for them.
6102840	6103840	I take it.
6103840	6104840	Wait, actually, hold on.
6104840	6105840	I should say, I don't.
6109840	6111840	I actually want to do a witchcraft.
6112840	6117840	I actually want to do a witchcraft stream and I want to make potion bottles for you guys
6117840	6120840	and I want to send them to you, but I don't know if I'll be allowed to.
6120840	6126840	I think I have to ask, but I really want to do a witchcraft stream where I make little,
6126840	6130840	like little, not potion, little spell bottles for you.
6130840	6132840	I think that would be so cute.
6132840	6135840	And you can tell me what you want me to put in it and I'll put what you want.
6135840	6138840	And maybe I can even put, I can even write a little handwritten message in there.
6138840	6141840	That would be so cute and I want to send it to you, but I don't know.
6141840	6144840	I'll have to ask, I'll have to ask if I can send it to you.
6147840	6149840	I'm not putting my eminate in it.
6149840	6153840	It will be completely sane items, okay?
6153840	6156840	There's not going to be any spit in the bottles.
6156840	6158840	There's not going to be any piss in the bottles.
6158840	6160840	There's not going to be any shit in the bottles.
6160840	6161840	You don't have to buy it.
6161840	6163840	I'll probably like, I don't know.
6164840	6166840	I don't want to put it behind a paywall.
6166840	6171840	Maybe I'll make like a, some kind of pool, choose someone random, you know?
6171840	6174840	There won't be bathwater, no.
6175840	6177840	Maybe accidentally sending demons to people's homes.
6177840	6179840	It won't, it won't be demons.
6179840	6180840	It won't be demons.
6180840	6182840	No, there won't be any hair in there either.
6182840	6188840	I'm not putting any of my personal parts in, in those, in those bottles.
6191840	6194840	Well, I wouldn't want to get out of here the same way the cultists did,
6194840	6197840	but I do think this is our best bet for now.
6197840	6199840	So what will we ask from it?
6199840	6200840	I don't know.
6200840	6203840	Okay, then what will we bargain with?
6207840	6209840	I don't know that either.
6209840	6210840	Nice.
6210840	6211840	I just barely woke up.
6211840	6212840	Give me a minute.
6212840	6215840	It says here demons prefer human soul, so obviously it's just got to be that.
6215840	6217840	Where do you get a soul while stuck in here?
6219840	6221840	What are you looking at?
6221840	6222840	Nothing.
6222840	6224840	Actually, what?
6224840	6227840	I wouldn't thought about it, I see.
6227840	6230840	Let me keep my thoughts to myself.
6230840	6232840	Didn't we already share enough?
6232840	6234840	On second thought, let's not do this.
6234840	6236840	Oh, come on, I'm not going to sacrifice you.
6236840	6238840	We'll figure something out.
6238840	6240840	Let's just set this ritual up for now.
6240840	6241840	Nine out of ten?
6241840	6243840	Thank you, Sheebie.
6245840	6247840	Will you burp into the bottle?
6247840	6248840	Okay, fine, fine.
6248840	6251840	If you want me to burp into the bottle, I'll burp into it.
6253840	6255840	The Gamer Girl bathwater was canceled.
6255840	6257840	Not because it was horrible, but because it was a biohazard.
6257840	6259840	Bill almost got fired for that.
6259840	6262840	Okay, but did we really expect it to be Gamer Girl bathwater?
6262840	6265840	It's obviously just like perfumed water.
6265840	6267840	It's not actual bathwater.
6267840	6270840	Also, if you hear creaking, it's my chair.
6271840	6272840	I'm not farting.
6272840	6273840	Okay?
6278840	6280840	I'm not done reading this yet,
6280840	6284840	but you can start by replacing the candles for now.
6284840	6285840	Okay.
6285840	6287840	Oh, fuck.
6287840	6288840	What?
6290840	6291840	Replacing the candles.
6293840	6294840	Put them up.
6297840	6298840	Replace them.
6298840	6299840	Okay.
6311840	6315840	No, I'm not sending lemonade in a bottle.
6315840	6316840	Oh my God.
6318840	6319840	Shut up.
6320840	6322840	I'd obviously make you pay for lemonade.
6322840	6323840	That wouldn't be free.
6325840	6326840	Okay, there you go.
6326840	6327840	I set up the candles.
6327840	6328840	Done with now.
6328840	6329840	Now we...
6331840	6333840	Still alive and kicking, are you?
6333840	6334840	Uh-oh.
6335840	6337840	You've been quiet lately, pal.
6337840	6339840	I'm getting a little worried here.
6341840	6342840	Si.
6342840	6344840	Yeah, hi, hello.
6344840	6346840	One of my guys isn't answering.
6346840	6348840	Oh, fuck.
6348840	6349840	Oh, fuck.
6349840	6350840	Oh, fuck, oh, fuck.
6351840	6352840	The weirdo one.
6352840	6354840	You think he croaked me?
6354840	6356840	But he's just a type B anyways.
6356840	6357840	What?
6365840	6367840	How much?
6367840	6368840	Oh, you.
6368840	6369840	Oh, you.
6369840	6370840	Oh, you.
6372840	6374840	Type B, what does that mean?
6375840	6376840	Fine.
6376840	6378840	I'll check it after my round.
6379840	6383840	Is that all we would have had to do to get the door open?
6383840	6385840	Just shut up for two days?
6385840	6387840	Shit, he's gonna come in and see all this?
6387840	6389840	No, no, no, no, no, enough.
6389840	6390840	Go stall him at our door.
6390840	6391840	I'll clean this up.
6391840	6396840	He's still gonna find the guy missing unless he checks the freezer,
6396840	6399840	which is where all this blood is pointing at.
6400840	6401840	No.
6401840	6406840	Go before he notices we're not home and keep him until I've mopped up all the blood.
6410840	6413840	Why, why are you guys blood type B type B blood type B?
6415840	6418840	Are they like collecting these people for their blood or something?
6419840	6420840	What do you mean type B?
6422840	6424840	There should be a corpse below then.
6425840	6428840	You, you get to be that...
6428840	6430840	I fucking can't read.
6430840	6433840	You get to be that corpse if you don't get going already.
6434840	6435840	I have to clean up the blood.
6435840	6436840	Clean it up, clean it up.
6437840	6438840	Oh fuck, get them up.
6438840	6439840	Okay, get them up, get them up.
6440840	6441840	You'll see.
6442840	6443840	What's your blood type?
6443840	6444840	That's a really good question actually.
6444840	6445840	I don't know.
6446840	6449840	Every time I've ever gone to donate blood,
6451840	6452840	that's not where the mop is.
6453840	6457840	I used, I went a couple times to donate blood and they said that they would send me a card,
6458840	6461840	like a donor card that would say my blood type on it,
6462840	6463840	but they never ended up doing that.
6464840	6466840	So I don't know if they just never use my blood,
6467840	6469840	but I actually don't know my blood type.
6475840	6476840	Mine is O plus.
6477840	6478840	That's cool.
6479840	6481840	Ashley, the warden is coming.
6482840	6483840	What do I do?
6484840	6485840	Get out, get out of here.
6486840	6487840	What are you doing here?
6487840	6488840	Oh shoot.
6489840	6492840	Silly, the warden soon calls over his buddy.
6492840	6495840	You get taken back to your apartment after which you and your brother,
6496840	6498840	you and your brother's wicked deeds are soon discovered.
6499840	6500840	You donate blood, good girl.
6500840	6503840	I only did it like twice or three times maybe,
6503840	6507840	but it worries me that they never gave me a donor card because I even asked.
6507840	6508840	I said, Hey, why didn't I get a card?
6509840	6510840	And they were like, Oh, we'll send you one Dory.
6511840	6514840	So now it makes me feel like I have some sort of disease and they never use my blood because of that.
6515840	6516840	Because you know, they test the blood that they,
6517840	6519840	they test the blood that they collect from you.
6520840	6523840	So I'm now I'm scared I have some sort of fucking disease and they never just,
6524840	6525840	they just never told me.
6526840	6528840	And that's why I didn't get a card because they never use my blood.
6533840	6535840	Andrew, start pole dancing.
6535840	6536840	Distract the guards.
6537840	6538840	Guess what?
6538840	6541840	It went so badly for you that I'm going to let you try again.
6542840	6543840	No.
6544840	6546840	Wait, what did I do wrong?
6547840	6548840	Is that supposed to happen?
6555840	6556840	But I didn't do anything.
6562840	6564840	Oh, I have to hide in the closet?
6566840	6567840	I don't know.
6567840	6568840	I just got here.
6569840	6570840	Okay.
6570840	6571840	I'll hide in the closet.
6575840	6576840	Okay.
6577840	6578840	Readings and salutations.
6582840	6583840	Anybody home?
6586840	6587840	I'll create another suicide.
6589840	6590840	I'll create another suicide.
6592840	6593840	I'll create another suicide.
6593840	6594840	I'll create another suicide.
6599840	6600840	What the?
6601840	6602840	How did you get in here?
6603840	6605840	Oh, my savior.
6607840	6608840	Thank you, Andy.
6611840	6612840	Sai.
6614840	6615840	Oh fuck, that's kind of hot.
6617840	6618840	Andrew doesn't seem to please with you right now.
6619840	6621840	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
6621840	6624840	You wonder if it's a good time to tell him that this is your fault.
6626840	6627840	Oh, my God, the bloody hand.
6628840	6629840	Come on then, Laili.
6629840	6630840	Let's go.
6634840	6636840	Shish, I thought I got caught there.
6636840	6637840	You did.
6637840	6638840	Happens to the best of...
6641840	6642840	Right, he do be kind of hot.
6642840	6643840	Oh, my God.
6646840	6647840	What do we do now?
6647840	6648840	Let's escape.
6649840	6650840	Well, you've done it now, Andy.
6651840	6652840	You've actually killed a man.
6653840	6654840	Like, directly.
6655840	6656840	Yup.
6656840	6657840	I was a little surprised there.
6658840	6659840	So where's your mental breakdown?
6660840	6661840	I'm saving it for later.
6661840	6662840	Lay off.
6669840	6673840	I'm reading deleted messages that mods deleted.
6674840	6675840	You guys are so funny.
6675840	6682840	I know, I'm sorry, I know.
6682840	6683840	These standards are impossible.
6683840	6685840	I know it's, I know it's not, I know.
6685840	6687840	I can't expect any of you to be murderers.
6689840	6691840	Actually, I'm not in the mood right now for your shit.
6692840	6693840	All right.
6693840	6694840	Oh, looky here.
6696840	6698840	Got a key to room 405.
6699840	6700840	405.
6703840	6704840	What's in here?
6704840	6705840	Ew, okay.
6708840	6711840	Women only want one thing and it's a fucking murder.
6712840	6715840	While loading the jacket pockets, you find a wallet with $600.
6716840	6719840	Now you got real moral dilemma here, stealing a dead man's wallet.
6720840	6721840	Oh.
6725840	6727840	Which one will make him want to fuck me?
6728840	6730840	I'm guessing splitting it, right?
6734840	6735840	Right?
6739840	6741840	A tiny consequence.
6744840	6746840	He saved your life, you brat.
6746840	6747840	At least give him some of the cash.
6747840	6749840	Okay, okay, okay.
6749840	6750840	Aren't you a sweetheart?
6751840	6752840	Don't say that, don't say that.
6753840	6756840	I'll use some of mine to treat you something to some...
6759840	6762840	I'll use some of mine to treat you something someday.
6762840	6763840	Maybe?
6765840	6766840	Okay.
6768840	6769840	Where do we go?
6769840	6771840	Do we go to the other room?
6777840	6779840	You just kept it different now?
6780840	6781840	What do I do?
6785840	6787840	It was a 333 split.
6787840	6788840	But...
6792840	6795840	You will find two more of them in the game.
6796840	6797840	Get on you for sharing?
6797840	6799840	Of course I always share with my brother.
6800840	6801840	I always...
6801840	6803840	I will always share everything.
6805840	6808840	I'm just looking for things to interact with.
6808840	6810840	Because I don't know what else to do.
6811840	6812840	You can leave from the neighbor's house.
6812840	6814840	Yes, I have done that.
6815840	6818840	Hey, sit down on the toilet.
6820840	6822840	Actually, no, I'll sit down and you pee between my legs, okay?
6823840	6824840	Oh my gosh!
6825840	6827840	That actually worked!
6827840	6828840	Maybe I'll take a shower.
6828840	6830840	Not right now, you won't.
6830840	6831840	Okay, fine, jeez.
6836840	6837840	No, like leave the apartments.
6837840	6838840	Oh!
6838840	6840840	Oh, oh, oh.
6842840	6843840	Okay.
6844840	6845840	Oh, shit.
6845840	6847840	You unlocked the door and...
6852840	6854840	Don't stand behind me like that, jeez.
6858840	6861840	I just want to make sure we're on the same page about something.
6861840	6866840	Whatever excuse we had for eating that other guy just went out the window because of your screw up.
6867840	6869840	Oh, I'm sorry, did I ask you to kill him?
6870840	6872840	What do you think is going to happen if I hadn't?
6874840	6876840	Look, I'm not saying I'm not grateful, Andrew.
6876840	6878840	I am, but what's your point?
6883840	6886840	I wish he grabbed me like that!
6890840	6893840	My point is that no matter what happens beyond the store,
6893840	6898840	you won't speak a word of what went down here to anyone.
6898840	6901840	Yeah, obviously, obviously.
6901840	6905840	And it'll no doubt be obvious we did something once this guy's shift ends
6905840	6908840	and the next warning comes around, comes looking around.
6908840	6910840	As best we disappear while we can.
6910840	6913840	Yeah, as you might have noticed, I'm trying!
6914840	6918840	You see, I'm not sure you're grasping the gravity of our situation here.
6918840	6921840	Knowing you, you think you're going to find mom and dad.
6922840	6924840	But I'm saying all of that is off the table.
6924840	6927840	I didn't plan on anything, actually.
6927840	6929840	God, that's even worse!
6929840	6933840	Okay, so you want me to never contact anyone I know ever again?
6933840	6936840	Because you think they'll snitch on us to the authorities, is that it?
6936840	6937840	Yes, exactly!
6937840	6939840	Yeah, fine, whatever.
6942840	6945840	Capitan, that's what it reminded me of, yeah?
6945840	6947840	If you're going to be this flippant about this,
6947840	6950840	it isn't the authorities you need to worry about.
6950840	6952840	What's that supposed to mean?
6952840	6954840	Are you threatening me right now?
6955840	6956840	Ah!
6958840	6963840	I'm not going to jail just because you think of yourself as impurevious to consequences.
6963840	6966840	So you're going to take this to your grave and if...
6968840	6970840	The tear just ran down my leg.
6971840	6973840	Even if I have to put you in there myself.
6973840	6976840	Oh my god, please put me in my grave, please!
6976840	6978840	You don't scare me, Andrew.
6979840	6980840	Ah!
6980840	6981840	Don't give me re-
6981840	6982840	Ah!
6984840	6985840	Ah!
6992840	6995840	Andi, it smells in hell the damn afraid of you.
6995840	6997840	Now back the fuck off!
6997840	6999840	Who do you think you're talking to?
7001840	7003840	I'm stressed out, Lele.
7007840	7009840	Truly the ideal relationship.
7011840	7013840	Okay, yeah, I can see that.
7015840	7017840	I need to know what you're...
7017840	7019840	I need to know you're taking this seriously.
7019840	7023840	There's half a dead guy in our freezer with my fingerprints all over it.
7023840	7026840	Trust me, I'm in no hurry to tell the world about this.
7027840	7029840	Hmm? All good? Can we go now?
7030840	7031840	Yeah, I guess.
7032840	7033840	Okay, finally.
7033840	7034840	Though, Andi,
7035840	7040840	I don't give a rat's ass about mom and or dad or any of my so-called friends anymore.
7040840	7043840	Not one of them felt it necessary to even answer my calls.
7045840	7048840	I know my dreams have come true.
7050840	7053840	They got such a beautifully toxic relationship.
7053840	7055840	I'm sorry, I still have...
7055840	7058840	I'm like constantly stuck in on cough drops right now.
7060840	7063840	Yeah, truly a romantic relationship.
7065840	7068840	Or come fling food up toward balcony.
7069840	7072840	Would be quite the feat to throw something so high.
7072840	7075840	The point is no one even came to try.
7075840	7079840	So my affections officially died with all the brain cells I lost while starving.
7080840	7083840	But it's alright because Andi is here with me,
7083840	7086840	even though he feels like threatening me for some reason.
7086840	7087840	Sorry.
7089840	7091840	I guess I lost some brain cells too.
7091840	7092840	I can tell!
7092840	7093840	Can't lose what we...
7093840	7095840	Oh, can't lose what you don't have!
7095840	7097840	Hahahaha.
7100840	7102840	Kiss it to our mouth like you said earlier.
7105840	7106840	There you go.
7107840	7109840	I don't know if you heard anything.
7112840	7113840	Oh, fuck you.
7114840	7116840	I like how they do a little shing.
7117840	7120840	Alright, alright, let's get the hell out of here, ready?
7121840	7123840	Oh, what is this?
7123840	7124840	That's a door.
7125840	7126840	401 is open!
7126840	7128840	Oh, fuck off.
7129840	7130840	Is this our door?
7131840	7134840	This is all it took to keep us in a wooden board.
7134840	7136840	It's okay, Andi, I don't have much muscle either.
7138840	7140840	Your eyes say you're trying to cover me,
7140840	7142840	but your words do the opposite.
7142840	7143840	Whatever.
7144840	7146840	What's the slip of paper say?
7148840	7150840	They are collecting our blood.
7151840	7154840	You're welcome, you're welcome.
7158840	7160840	I wish I was that cough drop.
7163840	7165840	What's that supposed to mean?
7165840	7167840	Don't know, don't care.
7167840	7169840	Yeah, let's just focus on getting out of here.
7171840	7172840	Okay.
7174840	7176840	I guess we go in here.
7176840	7178840	So is this the girl that died?
7181840	7182840	Hmm.
7184840	7185840	I sincerely don't care.
7185840	7186840	Let's just get out of here, please.
7186840	7187840	Shut up!
7187840	7189840	I'm working on it, goddammit.
7189840	7191840	Oh my god, you're so fucking whiny.
7193840	7195840	Like, I'm trying it, I'm trying it.
7195840	7197840	We should finish the noodles though.
7198840	7199840	No, on the fridge.
7200840	7203840	Notice from now on, AB types won't be given supplies,
7203840	7205840	except if something's important.
7205840	7206840	Oh!
7207840	7209840	We were AB.
7211840	7215840	Note 403 has an XO for it?
7217840	7220840	And no, the lady from 302 being hot doesn't count as important.
7220840	7221840	Stop asking!
7222840	7223840	Wait, what?
7230840	7233840	AB can receive from everyone, but only give to AB.
7236840	7239840	Is the lady from 302 single?
7240840	7242840	Is your brother single?
7242840	7244840	Is the toilet, there's nothing of interest inside?
7244840	7246840	Well, you don't know that, let me check.
7248840	7250840	Oh, there's notes on all of them.
7250840	7253840	2A1B.
7256840	7258840	1O, this crossed over.
7264840	7265840	Hmm.
7271840	7274840	Why are you telling me these facts about blood types?
7274840	7276840	Am I supposed to know?
7277840	7278840	Should I know this?
7293840	7294840	Let me out!
7294840	7295840	What do I do now?
7296840	7297840	Go in here?
7298840	7300840	Just want to know?
7309840	7311840	Stop calling me Imi.
7311840	7313840	There's no Imi, just Imi.
7313840	7315840	Who's this girl Imi?
7315840	7317840	Why do you keep bringing her up?
7317840	7318840	Jesus.
7321840	7323840	Stop mentioning her.
7323840	7324840	What?
7327840	7329840	Lots of 666's going on.
7336840	7338840	Imi is my sister?
7340840	7342840	You have another sister?
7342840	7343840	Huh?
7343840	7345840	And you never told me?
7346840	7347840	What the hell?
7349840	7351840	Check the warden one last time?
7351840	7352840	Okay, sorry.
7352840	7353840	I'll go check on it.
7353840	7355840	Oh wait, I should be able to leave from here, right?
7355840	7357840	Because I unblocked it?
7359840	7361840	This is the warden's place, right?
7364840	7366840	Oh, the pewter!
7366840	7368840	They've got a little surveillance camera.
7368840	7369840	Oh crap, are we on it?
7369840	7371840	No, looks like it's recording the second floor.
7371840	7373840	Let me see.
7373840	7375840	Wait, there's another warden there.
7375840	7377840	Is that a gun holster?
7377840	7379840	Didn't the other warden have one?
7379840	7381840	What's this guy?
7383840	7385840	You're the far cuter sister?
7385840	7387840	It better be.
7388840	7391840	You only had a key to the closest room in a walkie-talkie.
7391840	7392840	Sorry.
7396840	7399840	Okay, I know you keep hearing vibrating, please.
7399840	7401840	It's my phone.
7404840	7407840	There, I muted my phone so you won't hear any more vibrating.
7410840	7411840	Ugh.
7422840	7424840	It is my phone.
7428840	7429840	They probably work in pairs.
7429840	7432840	It's not like they have to do anything else
7432840	7436840	then keep curious people away
7436840	7438840	and pretend to feed us, I guess.
7439840	7442840	Well, even then, how are we getting around him?
7446840	7448840	It's okay, have your fun, I don't mind.
7450840	7452840	You will know when I have my fun, okay?
7452840	7453840	I'll make it very obvious.
7453840	7455840	Oh, there's a key here!
7455840	7457840	Oh, let's go to the fourth floor.
7459840	7461840	Oh, can we?
7462840	7464840	Oh, the third floor, sorry, the third floor.
7470840	7472840	One A, but it's crossed over.
7472840	7475840	I'm guessing the crossed over ones mean they're dead.
7475840	7477840	Oh, hello!
7478840	7480840	Hey, hey, hold up, don't you dare come any closer.
7480840	7481840	Who are you?
7481840	7483840	Your neighbors from upstairs?
7483840	7485840	What are you doing here?
7485840	7486840	Get out.
7486840	7489840	Well, we found the keys and thought you might want to get out of here.
7489840	7491840	You thought wrong, get lost, huh?
7491840	7493840	What, don't you understand?
7495840	7497840	You don't want to get out of here?
7497840	7500840	That's what I said, why would I want out?
7500840	7503840	I get free food and can't even play games all day long.
7503840	7504840	Huh?
7507840	7511840	Your special phone that has no screen and just one button.
7514840	7516840	Oh, is this the hot lady?
7516840	7520840	They showed favoritism to the hot lady, didn't they?
7520840	7521840	Okay.
7524840	7527840	I live like a king, I hope this quarantine never ends.
7527840	7529840	They actually bring you food?
7529840	7530840	Of course.
7532840	7535840	Literally anything I want, all you gotta do is ask nicely.
7535840	7538840	Oh, bro, she's been having sex with the warden, hasn't she been?
7538840	7542840	Hasn't she been, like, bent over and open wide nicely?
7542840	7543840	Ashley.
7543840	7550840	Fuck you, get out of here, get out of here, get out, both of you.
7553840	7555840	I'm going in your bathroom.
7555840	7557840	Hey, did I give you permission to go there?
7557840	7559840	I went in your kitchen.
7559840	7562840	Girl, don't you at least do your fucking dishes.
7562840	7564840	Can I steal some of her food?
7567840	7569840	Someone gave up assembling their furniture.
7569840	7573840	Why don't you ask the warden to assemble your furniture?
7573840	7575840	Can we put the nail gun in her head?
7577840	7578840	Okay.
7581840	7583840	Neat girlfriend of my dreams.
7583840	7585840	No, I'm your neat girlfriend of your dreams.
7585840	7587840	Well, that was something.
7587840	7589840	How come we got such different treatments?
7589840	7590840	Why don't I get food?
7590840	7592840	I guess you're just not pretty enough.
7592840	7599840	You think she's pretty?
7599840	7602840	Wasn't she?
7609840	7612840	No, shut up about objectively.
7614840	7616840	Yeah, his stock is plummeting.
7616840	7618840	I'm selling Andrew coin right now.
7619840	7622840	Is it okay to leave her there after she saw us though?
7622840	7625840	Probably not, but you go in there swinging your...
7625840	7629840	You go in there swinging your cleaver and she'll definitely scream.
7632840	7634840	Blonds are just hotter?
7637840	7640840	I can't tell if you're trying to give me a compliment or not.
7641840	7643840	You can admire something without wanting it?
7643840	7644840	No, you can't!
7644840	7646840	No, you can't!
7646840	7649840	You cannot admire something without wanting it.
7651840	7653840	Don't be admiring...
7653840	7656840	Don't be admiring shit in front of me.
7658840	7661840	I think our best bet is to finish the ritual
7661840	7663840	and use it to get rid of the second warden.
7670840	7674840	Well, if we can get this woman up to the cultist room,
7674840	7676840	we've got us assault to offer.
7676840	7679840	How on earth are we going to convince her lazy ass
7679840	7681840	to even leave her room?
7681840	7684840	Beats me, let's just finish setting up the ritual for now.
7684840	7685840	Alright.
7685840	7687840	Do you really think I'm not pretty enough?
7689840	7691840	Oh, come on!
7691840	7693840	So ugly am I?
7693840	7696840	So ugly that I shouldn't even be fed?
7696840	7698840	Or maybe they think...
7698840	7700840	Or maybe they didn't think it'd be fun to screw you
7700840	7702840	while I'm loitering around the house.
7703840	7705840	Oh yeah, okay, fair point.
7709840	7711840	You're already my type, Imi?
7711840	7712840	Good.
7720840	7721840	I am admiring nothing.
7721840	7722840	I only have eyes for you.
7722840	7724840	That's how it should be!
7724840	7726840	That's how it should be!
7728840	7730840	No, don't admire any stupid missiles.
7730840	7731840	Stupid missiles.
7731840	7733840	Missiles don't have holes in them.
7739840	7740840	Okay, anyways.
7741840	7742840	I wouldn't let them anyways.
7742840	7743840	YEEEHHH!
7743840	7744840	Thank you!
7746840	7748840	You better not let them.
7750840	7751840	Unknown the door is too big.
7751840	7752840	Okay.
7752840	7754840	Is anyone else home?
7755840	7757840	Not soft holes at least.
7757840	7758840	Yeah.
7758840	7759840	You want to fuck a missile?
7759840	7761840	Go ahead, be my guest.
7764840	7765840	Oh, another floor.
7765840	7766840	Oh wait, this is our floor.
7766840	7767840	Wait, what did we want to do?
7767840	7769840	We wanted to finish setting up the ritual, right?
7770840	7771840	How do we do that?
7775840	7776840	A walkie-talkie.
7776840	7777840	Useless.
7777840	7779840	I don't know, at least we'll hear if the others
7779840	7781840	weren't trying to contact this one.
7781840	7783840	Which then indicates time is running out for us.
7789840	7791840	Only admire Amy, yeah.
7791840	7793840	No, don't admire any other girls.
7795840	7797840	And don't want any other girls either.
7797840	7798840	Big deal.
7798840	7800840	At that point, we're screwed anyway.
7800840	7803840	Hey, what if we call the warden over with this
7803840	7805840	and have the demon eat his soul?
7805840	7807840	That's not a bad idea, actually.
7807840	7808840	Two birds with one stone!
7808840	7810840	Though he'll come in guns blazing.
7810840	7811840	Ah, right.
7811840	7812840	Let me think.
7812840	7813840	Let me think.
7813840	7814840	Let me think.
7814840	7815840	Let me think.

7823840	7824840	Let me think.
7824840	7825840	Let me think.
7825840	7826840	Right.
7826840	7827840	Let me think.
7828840	7831840	While you're at it, I'll read the ritual for us.
7831840	7833840	What do I need to do?
7833840	7834840	I don't remember.

10252500	10260820	no okay I really wish you'd be less nonchalant about everything all the time
10260820	10263980	hey now we can't both be constantly shitting ourselves over every little
10264340	10269780	thing true let's just go back to the motel before someone breaks in and steals
10269780	10277420	a damn thing why would someone break in eat food wait this is actually funny
10277420	10282260	this reminds me of something when I was in high school me and my friend made a
10282260	10289940	trash a potted plant subsists among cigarette but when I was in high school
10289940	10297860	me and my friend for 11th grade final we decided to draw a comic together and
10297860	10302740	this isn't even a funny story it's just reminds me of something and in the
10302740	10306740	comic we had to draw some advertisements and our advertisements were
10306740	10315580	basically just the words like that eat food drink Pepsi friend guys it's a girl
10315900	10324300	it was a girl she was one of my besties in high school I miss her she's not that
10324300	10331580	she's not that she's not that she's not that is she single? she's a lesbian

10357900	10367260	asking if my friend is single don't worry about my friend an ad for a coffee
10367260	10370820	shop it's difficult to imagine the aroma of warm cup of coffee with trash running

10924820	10927700	I wish she would grab me like that I'll grab you like that
10927780	10928420	that
10932580	10936580	nothing major just a fire that burned the whole place down everybody died yes
10936580	10941700	everybody a representative of the water company is here with us today is there anything you'd like
10941700	10947300	to add yes my deepest condolences to the family members of the deceased this apartment was most
10947300	10953780	definitely not a wholly mismanaged mess better burned to the ground so it's good that they escaped
10954580	10960420	are you even tall enough to grab any just just bend over
10962740	10966580	I am tall enough to grab you like that you just gotta bend over for me
10970500	10975300	therefore it is so sad that this happened to ease that sadness we recommend you try our talks
10976740	10980820	we just rolled out three new and exciting flavors excuse me sir something seems to
10980820	10986180	be going wrong with your microphone I'm sure you mean to say drink our trusty bubbly pop what
10986180	10991460	happened which happens to be our sponsor and it doesn't even make your organs bleed out of your
10991460	10998180	ass unlike some alternatives anyway um that was all for now tune in again later for a more wholesome
10998180	11009940	news to cheer up your day if you insist I do insist that was our apartment wasn't it was being
11009940	11016980	the correct tense indeed did I leave the oven on I said everybody died oh that's great isn't it
11018660	11024580	they must think we died too and all the evidence of our escape escapades let's say has been incinerated
11026500	11027300	I wonder about that
11032580	11037540	I told you it'll all work out that still leaves us homeless and just about penniless
11040180	11046100	whatever things are clearly clearly gonna sort themselves out I'm gonna get some sleep good night
11049220	11054340	the water company that owns the current in-world coca-cola product talks talks to soda is there
11054340	11058580	some sort of conspiracy theory that I'm not I'm not that's not clicking for me
11062020	11064580	I don't know who this bend over person is
11064660	11071700	I'm gonna stay up a bit longer maybe the late night news will have more information on the fire
11074180	11080660	suit yourself I don't know in a minute oh okay okay well I guess I'm gonna sleep
