right let me explain the premise here so I have a folder with a bunch of

05:00.320 --> 05:05.760
characters with a bunch of pictures of characters or people or like I think

05:05.760 --> 05:10.400
even objects I'm not sure I didn't look in the folder obviously because it's a

05:10.400 --> 05:17.240
game it's a guessing game right I know I touch grass isn't that crazy

05:17.480 --> 05:24.400
but yeah it's a guessing game so um basically I'm gonna take my glasses off

05:24.400 --> 05:29.400
I'm gonna move a little further from my desk so it's not as easy for me to see

05:29.400 --> 05:37.600
and um you're gonna help me guess the character on screen um don't tell me who

05:37.600 --> 05:42.400
it is please please please please don't tell me who it is okay it's a guessing

05:42.400 --> 05:48.240
game for a reason you can give me hints but don't make it too off all obvious

05:48.240 --> 05:58.800

Huh? Okay, I'm gonna put on my glasses, hold on. Holy shit. Tracking is off. Yeah, I think my Vtube

14:01.240 --> 14:08.600

14:08.600 --> 14:20.560
Oh, oh, no, there it is, it's crashed. Okay, let me try restarting Vtube Studio. Damn it,

14:20.560 --> 14:36.680

Doritos and chocolate pudding? What the fuck? But why are you mixing sweet with savory?

17:06.800 --> 17:27.200
Mustard banana cereal. Okay, now you're lying. Now you're just lying. Sweet and savory is good.

17:28.160 --> 17:37.680
It's okay when it's just one thing, like that's also like one thing that's sweet and savory at the same time.

17:38.400 --> 18:00.160
I feel dessert USB. I put hot sauce on bread. Are you poor? Why would you do that? Don't you

18:01.120 --> 18:03.120

18:11.360 --> 18:14.640

20:48.640 --> 20:52.160
Right? Yeah, it is. We should play Diabolic Lovers one day.

Um, is that a napkin?

21:08.720 --> 21:12.560

Mine close. It's a napkin.

21:26.080 --> 21:26.960
Is it a ghost?

21:30.320 --> 21:32.720
A dragon. A cute and funny dragon.

21:38.080 --> 21:47.040
Oh, oh, it's, it's the dragon from... Oh, I don't know her name, but it's from that one anime, right?

21:49.520 --> 21:53.360
Hmm. It's, it's the small... I know what you're talking about. I know what you're talking about.

Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Do you know her name? Can you name her for me? Because I can't.

You should watch it. Ms. Kobayashi's dragon maid. Kana. It's Kana. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, thank you.

22:38.320 --> 22:42.960
Oh, that's some... Is that a doll?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.160
Is that a doll?

22:51.840 --> 22:52.720
It's a bunny doll?

22:57.200 --> 23:02.480
It's not a doll. It's a bunny. It's some sort of bunny. It looks like a starfish to me.

23:02.800 --> 23:06.000
It looks like a starfish. Um...

23:10.480 --> 23:15.440
If you see me closing my eyes, it's probably because of sweat squinting. Experiment gone wrong.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.000
Traumatized rabbit.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.680
Why is she so round?

23:25.760 --> 23:40.320
Is it like... Traumatized rabbit. Is it Sheevee? I'm sorry, Sheevee. Into the depth. Sad bunny. It's the hair.

23:43.680 --> 23:48.160
Oh, I see a helmet. It's the girl from...

23:48.880 --> 23:58.960
The girl from Made in Abyss, right? The bunny girl from Made in Abyss, right?

24:01.280 --> 24:05.600
It's not Big Junkers. Don't be weird. It does kind of look like Big Junkers.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.840
Yes, Nanachi. Nanachi. Nanachi. That's what I was thinking of. I'm not good with names. I'm sorry.

24:10.800 --> 24:15.120

24:20.480 --> 24:22.720

24:26.000 --> 24:29.520
Yes, okay. Oh, f***.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.560
Is that a ninja? It looks like she's in a ninja pose.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.720
It's a toilet?

24:46.160 --> 24:50.240
Lolli. Oh, she looked...

24:57.280 --> 25:02.400
I'm not sure. Is it the girl from Toilet Bound Hanako-kun?

25:04.080 --> 25:07.200
Toilet related. Dicorinacals. Okay, yeah, yeah. It's her, right?

25:07.200 --> 25:12.320
I'm not farting. It's just my chair. I'd be honest if it was a fart.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.520
Okay, okay, okay. I'm so smart. I'm so good at this game.

25:25.840 --> 25:31.920
Why do I feel like that's Mercy? There's too much purple to not be Mercy. Isn't that Mercy?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.600
It's either Mercy or like...

25:43.120 --> 25:50.960
I don't know any other purple-haired characters. It's Mercy. I knew it. That's Mr. Krabs!

25:52.320 --> 26:00.560
Is that a basketball player? Or like a football player? I feel like I see a football in the background.

26:00.560 --> 26:07.360
It's you. Wrong sport.

26:10.720 --> 26:15.680
Hey, brother, brother, brother. Oh, it's a Hulk Hogan, isn't it?

26:16.640 --> 26:20.640
I saw... See, this looks like a bas... Not a basketball. This looks like a football to me.

26:20.640 --> 26:24.000
What is that? And then it looks like he's pointing with his hand.

26:24.240 --> 26:30.000
Oh, there he is. Okay, okay, okay.

26:33.520 --> 26:38.640
Is this a wizard? Shadow Money Wizard King? It looks like a wizard.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.920
Great hero. Great hero?

26:54.960 --> 26:59.040
It looks like a wizard with a big beard. Is it not?

27:02.960 --> 27:08.800
Old hero elf lover. Loves his dungeons? Is this a character from Dungeon Meshie?

27:15.440 --> 27:18.560
He is the one true hero. I guess he's a wizard in the scene.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.880
Autism elf? Is it the guy from...

27:25.760 --> 27:30.400
You guys are being really specific with your hands. It's a...

27:31.680 --> 27:38.800
Himmel the Hero? Is that it? Why does he look so much like a wizard? Oh, it is Himmel. Oh,

27:38.800 --> 27:45.520
he does have a beard. Okay, it's Old Himmel. Oh, okay, okay, okay. I was wondering,

27:45.520 --> 27:52.560
like, why does it look like a wizard with a beard? Right. This looks like a snake.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.400
It's a snake, isn't it?

28:01.200 --> 28:03.760
Am I should know this one? Is it not a snake?

28:08.400 --> 28:13.840
Is it like one of those noodles that you have a string attached to and you can play around with?

28:14.560 --> 28:16.800
Like, you pull on it like one of those fluffy noodles?

28:23.520 --> 28:30.720
Star Trek VA? Mutant. It's a lot of things smashed together.

28:34.400 --> 28:40.720
Is it a gummy worm? Is it like one of those colorful gummy worms?

28:44.640 --> 28:52.480
No? Fluttershy's friend? You guys are being too obvious. Is it Discord then?

28:54.800 --> 28:58.640
If it's Fluttershy's friend and it looks like a worm, it's probably Discord, right?

29:00.800 --> 29:07.200
Yes? Yes. Fluttershy's boyfriend? Oh my god. Wait, do you guys ship Discord and Fluttershy too?

29:07.200 --> 29:11.600
I think they're a really cute couple. I know he's like thousands of years old, but like...

29:14.720 --> 29:19.520
He's so nice to her. Well, at the start, he's an asshole to her, but he's nice to her after.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.720
I think everyone does, really? Okay, that's good. I don't know. I just...

29:28.720 --> 29:32.080
Some people I think are weirded out by it, but like, I think it's cute.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.440
All right, that's minty from my little pony. I could tell.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.560
Is that a penis?

29:44.800 --> 29:46.400
Is that a penis?

29:54.240 --> 30:01.520
It's a psychic? Is it a psychic penis? Why is it shaped like that? It looks...

30:03.920 --> 30:04.720
Is it Patrick?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.440
Is it Patrick?

30:14.800 --> 30:16.000
She likes peanuts.

30:18.640 --> 30:23.200
He's got a piercing? What do you mean he's got a piercing? Is it a penis with a piercing?

30:28.160 --> 30:32.800
In the little girl, small. She has a famous mom.

30:35.280 --> 30:35.680
Fucking...

30:38.800 --> 30:43.040
Northwest? I don't know, Kardashian? Who the fuck is that?

30:44.800 --> 30:49.040
A young child who likes peanuts. Her dog is big.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.000
Her dog is big.

30:56.960 --> 31:04.960
Tiny spy. Oh, spies and assassin. Oh, it's Anya. Oh, it's Anya. Is that a penis?

31:05.680 --> 31:11.280
It's Anya. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. See, from my angle, it just looks like a

31:11.280 --> 31:20.160
penis head. Like, I don't see anything else. Okay, that looks like a character from...

31:24.640 --> 31:30.560
Demon Slayer? Let me get my water. Is that a character from Demon Slayer? It looks like a

31:30.640 --> 31:31.760
character from Demon Slayer.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.280
Useless. No.

31:40.880 --> 31:47.280
Shonen character. Why are you guys calling her Useless? I feel like if it's a shonen character

31:47.280 --> 31:54.320
in a ninja, then it must be Sakura if everyone's calling her Useless. Is that it?

31:55.280 --> 32:04.240
Oh my god, you guys hate Sakura. You guys really hate her. Damn. It looks like a Demon

32:04.240 --> 32:13.600
Slayer character to me. Oh, no, I see her now. Okay. Is that a monkey?

32:13.600 --> 32:21.440
It looks like a monkey with blue hair.

32:28.240 --> 32:34.880
Animatronic with blue hair? Is it an animatronic with blue hair?

32:35.680 --> 32:39.760
Puppet. Five Nights at Freddy's Spider Mom.

32:42.080 --> 32:46.800
What? This doesn't look like any Five Nights at Freddy's character.

32:49.360 --> 32:56.640
It looks like, this looks like arms. And then this one too. And then, sorry, I'm using my thigh as

32:56.640 --> 33:01.120
like a mouse pad. And then this looks like hair and then this looks like the face and these look

33:01.120 --> 33:07.120
like little legs to me. Oh, like little, like feet. Freaky.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.280
Helosis. She crawls on all fours.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.200

Is that shadow the hedgehog? That looks like shadow. Yeah. Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.

33:50.320 --> 33:55.440
I'm so good at this game. Is that Sonic the hedgehog?

34:03.680 --> 34:07.120
Is that Sonic? No.

34:07.920 --> 34:15.920
I genuinely can't tell who that is.

34:19.200 --> 34:26.880
It looks like, it looks like someone like on his knees, like looking downwards.

34:27.440 --> 34:42.320
Bird looks like a thunder cat. Chicken feet. What? Chicken feet?

34:45.440 --> 34:49.360
What bird looks like, what are you talking about? Adventure time?

34:50.320 --> 34:57.760
Is that Ice King? Is this Ice King from Adventure Time? Oh, no, it's not. Oh,

35:00.480 --> 35:10.880
it's like, it's like the original one. I forgot his name on. My voice is really bad today.

35:11.200 --> 35:23.520
No, it's not the original Ice King. It's like, well, it is the original Ice King, but it's not the

35:23.520 --> 35:32.240
the one we all know. It's like, it's like the one that Ice King got his crown for it from, I think.

35:33.200 --> 35:44.480
Yeah. That's Kirby. Yeah, that's Kirby. Why does he have giant feet? What are these? Are those feet?

35:45.360 --> 35:46.320
Those are feet, right?

35:51.600 --> 35:55.840
Yep. Is that Goku?

36:03.040 --> 36:09.840
Yeah, it's Goku. Oh my god, I'm too good at this. Okay, that image is too big. I can obviously tell

36:09.840 --> 36:19.520
that's um, fucking, I forgot his name from regular show. The guy from regular show, the blue bird.

36:19.520 --> 36:27.520
I know that one. Mordecai, Mordecai, Mordecai. Where's my mouse? I can't even see my mouse.

36:27.520 --> 36:34.640
Oh, fuck. Congratulations. Oh, that's Grail from Black Butler. All right, this one I'm not sure.

36:37.600 --> 36:47.120
It looks like a woman with short hair and a side shave. Is there fire in the background?

36:51.520 --> 36:55.920
Not a woman. It looks like a woman.

36:58.400 --> 37:15.040
There's fire? Is this a fire pender? Cave grade syndrome. He has a seal.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.840
Huh?

37:24.720 --> 37:30.880
I genuinely don't know. It looks like Gojo. Is this just another Gojo?

37:35.040 --> 37:36.240
The fire is not important.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.280
It's not Gojo?

37:43.840 --> 37:48.480
White hair. I can tell that the hair is white. Is it another psyche character?

37:54.960 --> 38:00.560
He's in the same classroom as Balchen. It's the psyche character that thinks he's getting

38:01.200 --> 38:04.400
like hunted by the the dark something, right?

38:07.200 --> 38:13.280
Shadow. Dark reunion. Dark reunion. Something like that. Yeah, that's him. I thought it was a woman.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.080
Okay. Is this a shrimp?

38:22.160 --> 38:26.720
Or a lizard with a hat? Or a snake?

38:26.960 --> 38:30.080
Not a shrimp.

38:32.800 --> 38:38.560
Not a cat? Cat by conference. Oh, you guys are being too obvious.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.040
Is this is this person boots?

38:49.680 --> 38:52.160
Chat's cheating. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't look at chat.

38:52.720 --> 38:58.800
Yeah, it's person boots. Okay, hold on. I have to

39:00.480 --> 39:06.800
I have to zoom in to see to see person boots. Oh, there he is. Okay. He looks like a lizard from far away.

39:08.720 --> 39:14.720
Is this the guy from Dororo? Dororo? It is. God, I love that guy.

39:14.960 --> 39:24.080
Is that a transformer? Is that a transformer?

39:27.920 --> 39:31.120
I can't recognize transformers. I don't know the names of the transformers.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.160
Or is it Darth Vader?

39:36.560 --> 39:45.920
Or like a vampire or something? It's either a transformer, Darth Vader or a vampire.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.960
Is it Megatron?

39:54.640 --> 39:59.120
They're hot. Maybe I do see some boobies there.

39:59.120 --> 40:16.880
Are they wearing a helmet?

40:21.840 --> 40:25.280
Mommy, three misses. Skunk colored hair woman.

40:29.760 --> 40:38.400
Um, is it a, no, I was going to say, is it a man? You guys said a woman already.

40:39.840 --> 40:44.800
That's a whistle. The immovable doesn't look like bunch.

40:47.200 --> 40:52.400
Oh, is it the girl from main and abyss? The one that's really hot and that tries to kill them

40:54.160 --> 40:58.400
and looks really scary. She has like the funny hair.

40:59.440 --> 41:05.360
To cover her bald spot. It is. I love this lady. I love this lady so fucking much. Oh my god,

I really want to drop fan art of her. She's so sex. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Megatron.

41:12.880 --> 41:21.360
That's the girl from SAO. Yeah. I never watched that show. Is that Mr. Krabs again?

41:22.320 --> 41:27.600
Or a car from cars?

42:05.680 --> 42:07.280
Elon Musk? Is that?

42:12.320 --> 42:17.120
I would not have been able to guess. I wouldn't even have been able to guess Tony Stark.

42:18.320 --> 42:23.280
It's Elon Musk. Oh my god, it's an Iron Man suit. That's so funny.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.600
This is some kind of monster.

42:36.160 --> 42:39.680
Is it a bird? Some kind of bird monster?

42:39.760 --> 42:46.960
Or does it have a beard?

42:50.000 --> 42:55.600
I'm seeing like some sort of beard here, but then this looks like a bird beak on this side.

42:55.600 --> 42:59.440
I'm sorry if I'm not even pointing at the right thing. I can't see where my mouse is actually

42:59.440 --> 43:02.240
going. Spooky demon.

43:06.560 --> 43:11.280
Basic offensive magic. Oh, is it the guy from FreeRen?

43:11.280 --> 43:15.920
That, um, sorry if my model tracking is so bad. I'm really far away from my computer.

43:45.760 --> 43:52.880
Or does it have a face?

44:01.360 --> 44:03.680
Is it like the Mewtwo evolution?

44:07.760 --> 44:10.080
It has a face. It's an anime guy.

44:10.320 --> 44:21.920
An anime guy with purple hair? There's not a lot of those.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.120
Does he have human legs?

44:32.640 --> 44:34.160
He do stand like Mewtwo, yeah.

44:35.120 --> 44:41.520
And what's this thing in front of him? What's this big ass purple thing here?

44:41.520 --> 44:44.080
Am I even pointing at it this thing? What's that?

44:47.280 --> 44:48.400
Just like Prince Ali.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.800

Oh, is this one he was a kid though? Oh, I think it's one he was a kid.

45:31.440 --> 45:35.520
Okay, thank you. I used to read a lot of fan fiction of that guy. All right.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.800
This is really hard to see.

45:46.640 --> 45:52.320
All right, so it looks like an accordion or a book in the front and then like a hand holding it?

45:53.760 --> 45:56.640
Is there even a human in this picture?

45:59.040 --> 46:04.880
Like, it looks like there's like a book in the bottom left corner and then a bunch of skin color,

46:04.880 --> 46:10.560
like, like, like someone reaching out, grabbing a book. Excuse me. Thank you.

46:13.440 --> 46:17.360

Wait, this is CL, right? Is this like AICL? I feel like something looks off here.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.240
This is not my CL.

46:59.360 --> 47:04.640
What the fuck? Is this one of those slimes from that slime show?

47:08.320 --> 47:12.000
It looks like it's a slime with a hat on it or like a booger with a hat on it.

47:17.120 --> 47:21.120
No.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.120
Not anime. It's a meme.

47:28.960 --> 47:33.040
Oh, it's the, it's the turtle from over the hedge. Someone said hedge.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.680
It's the turtle from over the hedge. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.120

All right. This is a pink haired girl and she looks like she has big boobies too.

48:57.440 --> 49:04.880
Right? Big boobies, maybe pigtails. Don't tell Strani.

49:09.760 --> 49:18.640
Your colleague. People are saying tungsten rat. A rat. Well, if you say it's tungsten rat,

49:18.640 --> 49:23.680
that's too obvious. If it's a pink haired girl with pigtails, it's got to be an iron mouse, right?

49:24.880 --> 49:28.880
Yeah, there she is. She's not my colleague. I don't know her.

49:28.880 --> 49:38.000

Wrong day. Day of the week. Oh, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

Okay, is this also a snowman? I see a really big white log in the middle.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.440
Do I see a collar maybe?

52:12.560 --> 52:16.960
Is it like a teardrop shape? Like a, like a white teardrop shaped head?

52:17.440 --> 52:28.320

Um, it kind of looks like those Twitch streamers that have their butts out all the time, right?

57:28.720 --> 57:32.960
That's what I'm kind of seeing. Like, like maybe the pool is over here

57:34.320 --> 57:40.240

Furry, furry you, furry bait, furry bait.

58:20.080 --> 58:23.200
This generation's Lola. This generation's Lola?

58:23.440 --> 58:30.640
Oh, Officer Hops. Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.960
I got it. Right.

58:39.840 --> 58:44.960
This kind of just looks like a bloody tampon. I'm not gonna lie.

58:46.480 --> 58:52.240
Or like something splattered and died. Like fell against a wall and splattered.

58:53.440 --> 58:57.440
Close. There's blood.

59:06.240 --> 59:10.880
Biology? He's inside of a- he's inside you. Is it you?

59:13.600 --> 59:14.400
Is this you?

59:17.920 --> 59:19.760
The guy inside your blood right now.

59:24.000 --> 59:24.320
What?

59:29.600 --> 59:31.600
Protects you from bacteria. Oh.

59:33.600 --> 59:39.040
Is it the red blood cell from that one anime with cells?

59:40.560 --> 59:47.040
White guy. Yeah, he's a cell. No, unfortunately. It's the red blood cell, right?

59:48.800 --> 59:52.640
Wrong color. White blood cell? Sorry. White blood cell.

59:53.920 --> 59:59.760
From, um, I forgot what the anime is called, but yeah, it's about your body.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.960
Yes, okay. Oops.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.320
Oh my god, he's kind of hot. Okay. I like it. I like seeing guys covered in blood.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:20.880
Okay. Is that Applejack? Oh, it is. Nice.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:36.080
Is that the guy from Mulan? Mulan that goes did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:45.600
Yes, okay. I'm surprised I got that. He looks really hard to see. That's an Enderman.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.280
Yeah, that's an Enderman. I knew it.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.520
Is that a diglet from Pokemon?

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.360
Or like a picture of a beach?

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:06.480
No.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.120
Close. Skip it? Why?

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:22.480
Remember Anya? Is it not safe for work? Always a penis head, isn't it?

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.440
Okay, okay.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.880
Oh, that's that's the guy from Dungenesshee. Uh, Lyos, right? Lyos. Oh yeah.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.960
Is this another pony?

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.280
Like my little pony infected are you a pony? Is this a pony?

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:57.440
What? Oh, it's a Pokemon. You would fuck a Pokemon? Disgusting. Why would you do that?

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:05.920
Don't you insult my wife like that? Pokemon waifu? Wait, what? Third hot is Pokemon?

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:14.960
Oh, I forgot her name. Okay, okay. I see. Okay, fair. I guess I would fuck that Pokemon too.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.640
I'm not gonna lie. She's pretty. She's really pretty.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.800
I knew it. I knew it.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.040
Okay, um, the color scheme is kind of familiar.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:46.320
Kachun? My favorite slime. That doesn't look like a slime. It looks like, um,

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.120
strawberry shortcake?

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:06.400
Different sweater every day. Strawberry shortcake? It's just you?

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.400
Obnoxious little sister. Dipper's girlfriend. You guys ship Dipper in the, uh,

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.600
fuck what's her name? Mabel? Oh my god. Yeah, it's Mabel.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.280
She has a pit pig. You do?

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.720
Nasty. Oh, this is the thick girl from, uh, Dengen Reshi.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:43.120
Yeah. We're pinballs. Of course we do. They hate each other, though. They don't hate each other.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:52.640
They love each other. Pacifica tin? Tin. Pacifica tin. You ship Dipper in Pacifica?

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.520
Okay, that's cringe. I would, I would rather you ship Dipper in Mabel than Dipper in Pacifica.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:04.800
What the fuck? Okay, that's the guy from the office. That's, um, Michael from the office, isn't it?

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:16.560
I ship me with you. That works too. No, not Michael.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.760
Did someone say Dwight? Don't tell me who it is. Is it actually Dwight?

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.240
Michael wishes he was though. It's not Dwight.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:44.080
Oh, it is Dwight? Oh, don't tell me the name. Oh, it is Dwight. Okay, okay, okay.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.400
Is that Jack Black? Is that Jack Black?

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:02.160
Yeah, Gabe Bowser? I knew it.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.520
Is that Freddy Fazbear?

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.800
It's either Freddy Fazbear or, like,

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:23.680
it's Freddy Fazbear. Okay, okay, okay, okay. We're doing so good. Oh my god.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.280
Oh, shit.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.560
Okay, give me a hint. Is this a man or a woman? Because right now, all I'm seeing is blobs.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.160
You don't know who it is?

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.760
Is this a heavy anime? It's a man.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.600
You don't know. You don't know. How am I supposed to know?

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:08.000
Oh, it's from, um, it's, um, from, uh, fuck, what's the anime?

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:16.320
Right? From, um, um, um, um, the one where the girl, high school host club, or on high school

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:22.000
host club, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's one of the twins. I can't tell which one it is,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:34.480
but I think it's one of the twins, right? Is that a Tilt-O? Is that a Tilt-O?

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.920
It looks like this part goes inside of you and this part comes outside.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:52.320
Indy video game character? Is that Barney?

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.680
I know Barney is not really Indy, but is it Barney?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.200
Does he have a bone? You're gonna have a bad time? What?

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.440
Nagito's boyfriend? Huh?

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.800
What? Tumblr loves this guy.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.840
The one-slip? I literally don't know.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.560
Megalovania. Oh, is that Sans Undertale?

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.880
Is it Sans?

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:56.320
Yes? Nox Taco? It is? What the fuck? Oh, it is! I was wondering, like, why is he purple?

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:12.480
Okay, okay, okay, okay. That's Icy. Is this also Pokemon? I feel like there's two characters here, right?

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.480
Okay.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:25.120
Wind, Pokemon. Very old. He's bald.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.720
Bald. He's older than he looks. Just one character.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:41.520
Is it Naruto? I know Naruto is not bald. Oh, it's Saitama! Is it Saitama?

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.120
Air.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.040
No, but he's bald. Is it the last Airbender guy? I don't know his name.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The last, I don't know his name. What's his name? Aang, Aang. Or is it Aang?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.520
Ah, okay, there we go.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.760
That's talky room shake. I can recognize the memes, like, immediately.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.800
She doesn't know Aang? I told you guys, I've never watched that show.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.360
All right, that's a spider. That's like a dead spider. That's a crushed spider.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:48.720
Or, like, an octopus. Or, like, a fluffy octopus.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.720
Ah.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.560
Mommy, mommy, mommy. Why are you calling for mommy? There's no mommy here. What?

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:17.040
Is this demon hair, hair witch, Dante? Who's Dante? Best game waifu.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:30.080
Hair witch. Is it the witch, hair witch? Is it the mage from Freerun that can control her hair? She's not really mommy, though.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.560
Rich gay aunt, four guns.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.640
Is this Bayonetta? Is it Bayonetta?

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.360
Yes! Why does she look like a crushed spider?

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.920
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Now I understand why you said mommy.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.560
Oh, that's Yumi from Legal Witches. Oh, that was too close. It's the Pikmin.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:20.720
Is this the big boobied girl from One Piece? I don't know her name.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.120
Yes, yes, Nami, Nami, Nami, okay.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:44.240
God damn it. Every time the picture loads, it, like, enlarges it, so I know that this is the bad guy from, um, Wreck-It Ralph.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.640
Right? Is that him? That's the bad guy from Wreck-It Ralph, right?

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.040
Mm-mm, okay. Let me close my eyes this time.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.080
All right, there we go. That's...

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:18.240
Is that a woman? Is it a woman? Or is it something that's, like, an object? Gross.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.120
Is this a real, is this an alive thing? Is this thing alive?

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:35.680
Who is this? It's a woman. It's a woman. Is she wearing a black skirt? Or black dress?

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.360
Some people see this as an object. Shut up. I think you got the wrong folder.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.640
You can never tell. What?

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.680
Yes, a woman. Okay, you guys don't know this person, huh?

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.240
Is it Lady Gaga?

01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.840
Or is this JoJo Silla?

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.640
A zero IRL? Bro, what?

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.800
You got me really confused. Fleshwear.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.560
My browser history.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.000
She works in a store kind of like Walmart. Oh, oh, it's the, it's the hot, it's the hot,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.280
it's the hot one from Superstore and she's wearing the sexy, the sexy, um, police outfit.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.400
Isn't she? Yes, I love this character. She's just like female Dwight, basically.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:47.280
Ah, okay, okay. Okay, how come you guys don't know her? She's so fun. You guys should watch

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:57.760
Superstore. It's really good. It's not JoJo Silla.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.240
Okay. Is this the under-dragon from Minecraft?

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:21.920
Yes. Okay, nice. I kind of recognized it. Fuck, that's Chewbacca. Okay,

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.520
I gotta close my eyes. I forgot I need to close my eyes. Okay.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.960
This is, is this a bald man?

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:48.560
Immune. Zombie. Zombie? Is it a, it's a bald man, right?

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.000
No makeup. Flesh version of a character.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:05.120
It's a bald man, right? Long hair, female? Name a woman.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.280
Me. Naughty dog.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.560
Not bald. It's a girl. What the fuck? A girl that caused a lot of uproar.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:24.160
Dude, it literally just looks like a bald man with a beard for me, wearing like a green sweater.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.040
Oh my god, should I zoom in more?

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.240
It still looks like a bald man with a beard.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:47.520
Oh, okay, okay. Her hair was blending in with the background. It's Ellie from The Last of Us.

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:54.880
Okay, okay. Her hair was blending in with the background. Okay, like,

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.920
like this darkness here looked like a beard. Wait, is it Ellie? Yeah, it is. Okay, so these

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:10.000
pictures are like so low quality. How do your eyes work? They don't work.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.120
Is this Kirito from Sword Art Online?

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.960
Yes, okay. Damn it, that's Azura.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:40.560
Is that Saw? Like Saw from the show, the show, the movies? Jigsaw?

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.760
Adventure Time.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:56.320
There's no Adventure Time characters that look like this.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:04.880
Daddy? He's a king? Huh? Adventure Time characters that you would call daddy.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:12.080
I wouldn't call any Adventure Time characters daddy. They all look stupid. Maybe Ice King.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:21.040
I've got to go take care of things. Oh, okay, goodbye. Thank you for spending time with me.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:30.560
Vampire Knight. Oh, literally a daddy. Oh, it's, is it, is it Marceline's dad from,

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.560
from Adventure Time? Marceline's dad? Of course I would call Ice King dad. Have you seen Ice King?

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.920
Wait, it's not Marceline's dad? Huh? What?

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.720
Marceline Orangine? Is it like the original, is it the guy that like,

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:59.920
the one that they killed, right? In like Adventure Time, Stakes or something. It was

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:09.920
called Stakes or something, right? Where's his suit? Yeah, he's like the, the vampire,

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:19.600
I don't know, king or something. Yes, okay. Oh, yeah, I remember. Yep, yep, yep. Wait,

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:28.560
really? Is this him? He looks so ugly. Okay, next.

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:37.760
Is that the guy from Killing Stocking? I don't remember his name. It's a Korean name,

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:47.760
Yoonbum? Something like that? Yes, is his name Yoonbum? Did I say the right name?

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.720
Sinji? Wait, his name is Sinji? Yes.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.000
Which one is it? Is it Sinji or Yoonbum?

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:09.360
I thought it was Levi. He does look like Levi, doesn't he? I read a good chunk of that webtoon,

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:15.520
I did. I have been closing my eyes when I've been, when I've been going to the next one because it,

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:28.240
it makes the image big enough for me to see. Levi Fanart. Okay, next. That's Sheeby. It's too easy.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:38.080
That's the fucking sexy, uh, that's the sexy lion from Ice Age, isn't it? Diego.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:47.040
It's either Diego or a piece of like, or some Cheetos, a pile of Cheetos. It's kind of like one

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:52.880
of the, it's Diego. You, you don't like Diego?

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:02.800
Why sexy? You don't know the appeal behind Diego? Some of you guys got to, you know,

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.680
think more like a furry.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.680
Think more like a furry.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:20.400
Diego is free. Yeah, he's got a good voice. He's got a good voice.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.920
Diego has a girl? I know, I know, I know he does. Don't worry, don't worry. I would never leave you

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:50.480
for Diego. Is that like green onion? Like a leek? Or a paintbrush?

01:20:50.640 --> 01:21:05.280
Bitch, I know, that's what I'm saying. He's a doctor. Animate Bill Nye. Oh, Dr. Stone.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.760
I don't know his name, but it's the guy from Dr. Stone, right?

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:19.920
Noble Orient. Yes. Ah, it's not a leek. I like how it says E equals MC square there.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:30.640
Okay, next. This is a bald man. This is a bald man. If I've ever seen a bald man in my life,

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:36.640
this is a bald man, right? You can't tell me that this is not a bald man.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:48.800
Thank you. All right, now the rest of it. He's wearing a suit, right? Like a body suit,

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:58.080
like a skin tight, like, you know, it's like red in the front, maybe. Oh, is this the Deadpool?

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:14.640
Is this Deadpool? Spider-Man? Yes, I'm so good at this game. I love Deadpool. That's one of my

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.320
favorite characters. That was Hatsune Miku. I wouldn't have guessed it even if it was far away.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:29.680
Um, okay. Is this a lizard? Is this a lizard or a dragon, maybe?

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:48.640
Daddy Jack Black? It's Bowser. It's Bowser. Obviously, you can't say Jack Black and expect

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:58.400
me not to say Bowser. This is Mickey Mouse, right? Yeah, yeah, it's Mickey Mouse. Okay.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:07.440
Um, is this a hand? Is this, is this a hand?

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:15.680
A hand? Or a finger? A hand or a finger?

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.280
What do you mean DMCA? What's DMCA-ing?

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.680
Have I shown something? Am I playing something due to DMCA?

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.000
He sweeps.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.520
Not a head. No, a head. No, a head. Oh, it's a head.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:24:01.600
Is this Goku? Is this one Goku? Or, um,

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:11.360
um, maybe, um, Al from Death Note? I can tell that it's got black hair, maybe.

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.520
Disney Ninjas. Definitely Kocho.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.760
He wishes he was Goku. What does that mean?

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.200
Dude, I don't know.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:44.560
Lego Ninjago? I've never watched Lego Ninjago. Is this a, is this a Lego character?

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.160
A cry baby. He's so, he's so sad. Zoom in a little.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:25:02.720
Oh, it's the guy from Devil Man Cry Baby. Is that it?

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:15.040
I'm so smart. He'd be crying. Thank you. That one was hard. That one was hard.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:33.120
Is this a British man with a, with a gun?

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:43.200
Good girl, so smart. Thank you. Daddy. Daddy? Is this, um,

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:53.840
is this also from The Last of Us? Pablo? Oh, fuck. I forgot the actor's name.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:01.520
It's something Spanish sounding. It's not Pablo though. Um, best that ever.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.840
Yeah, you got it just with that. Pedro. Pedro Pascal. Is it Pedro Pascal?

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.440
Is. I'm Pablo. I'm so sorry to any Pedro Pascal fans.

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.360
Is this like, um, Pablo Escobar?

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.360
Did he just get British because of the mustache? I'm gonna be honest. I didn't even see a mustache.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.320
It looked like a British soldier. All right. Is this a pool picture? It looks like a pool picture.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.320
Is this Deku? Is this Deku again?

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.960
Someone in a swimming suit or something?

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:54.560
No.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:06.640
Is this from my children's? Is this, is that Ash Ketchum? From Pokemon?

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.960
A boy you think? Is it Ash?

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:17.840
No.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:33.760
What is this? Is this, um, Astro Boy? Is it Astro Boy? It's a girl?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:45.200
Oh, is it the girl from Dororo? Dororo?

01:27:51.520 --> 01:28:00.400
Is it, it looks like the girl from Dororo. Yes. Yeah. Okay, it's, it's not Astro Boy.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.600
I mean, that was close.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.400
Dude, what the fuck? Is this a piece of paper?

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.080
And a pen?

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.240
A map? Is this, is this the map from Dora?

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.760
He's Quebecois? Married a whale? What?

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.040
Is this a human being right now?

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.000
Why is everyone saying Cheeto, Canadian? They did the worm.

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.920
French, is this Justin Bieber?

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.040
Is this a streamer?

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.600
Played Overwatch? Welcome to the jungle? What? Streamer? Is this Ninja?

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.600
Is this Ninja?

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.840
What the fuck? Streamer. She doesn't know.

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:18.320
Stranny competitor when it comes to yapping. I don't know.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.920
Twitch streamer, top chess player. Oh, is this a...

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.880
The guy that's really muscular and bald, right?

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:43.920
Six monitors? Oh, it's XQC. It's XQC, right? It's XQC.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:53.840
It's not XQC? Yes, yes it is. Okay, okay. Oh god, that's a jumpscare.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.280
I couldn't tell that it was XQC at all.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.960
Okay, that's Garfield. Yeah.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:13.120
Is this Tiger's from Kung Fu Panda?

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.800
Piece of paper. Hates Mondays. Yeah, I got that one.

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:25.440
It's Tiger's from Kung Fu Panda? Yes? Okay, wow. I'm still good at this. Let's go.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:34.960
It's Kochun. Oh shit, that's Shrek. That's so obviously Shrek.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.280
Is this PewDiePie? Or the Joker?

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:48.240
Or...

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.760
Is this like the Great Pyramids with the face on it?

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.640
Arcane again. Father figure.

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.360
Huh? Arcane father figure?

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.920
Did nothing wrong die to good dad? Ah, shit.

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:25.360
Um, is it the one that adopted Jinx? That one?

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.360
Yeah, yeah, okay. I don't know his name, but I know who you're talking about.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:37.200
Yeah, that guy. Okay. PewDiePie?

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.520
PewDiePie? This is fucking egg.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:52.560
That's the egg from Shrek, right? Is this from Shrek? Or something else? Puss in Boots maybe?

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:05.440
Puss in Boots, yeah. Mercy's Nemesis? Humpty Dumpty. Wait, why is Humpty Dumpty Mercy's Nemesis?

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:16.080
Um, is that death from Puss in Boots?

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.120
Whistles. Mercy hates eggs? Wait, really? Let's go.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:38.720
Mercy, why does she hate eggs? That's Bill Sliver! Let's go! Bro, I love that character.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:48.080
Is that it? Did we reach the end? Hey, I got like half of them right without your help, I feel like.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:57.680
Oh, Mercy's allergic to eggs. Oh, the man himself. Okay, let me get my glasses back on. Hold on.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:03.040
Let me look closer.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.760
Hello. Oh my god, I can see clearly again.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:22.320
Good job. Thanks. I really did good, didn't I? Say I did.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:27.360
Here.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.880
Oh wait, why did I do that? I'm being stupid, I'm sorry. I turned off my ring light for some reason.

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:44.560
There, I need that light. Good girl. Thank you. Thank you. Here, we've only been streaming for,

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.400
god damn it, my thumb is getting stuck.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:54.720
You're not blind? Guys, I'm so blind. The only reason I was able to guess some characters

01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:01.600
is because, like, they're color palettes. I saw the color palettes, but if, like, stuff like XQC,

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:08.720
where he had like, um, things around him, like, when it's really muddled with other color palettes,

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.800
color palettes around them, it's like way harder. But yeah, thank you for all the praises.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.560
So, hold on, let me go back here.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.880
And, oh, chat has to catch up. And what the frick?

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:39.280
Gay? Why are you acting so gay? Test.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:48.000
Oh, thank you for the $25 Anonymous. Anonymous rat. I forgot to change my, um,

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:56.640
I have once again forgotten to change my alerts to the, um, to my headphones instead of my speakers.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.640
10 out of 10, thank you. Holy shit, chat is taking forever to catch up. Well,

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.680
since we've only been streaming for an hour, 35 minutes, I think for the last 30 minutes,

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:13.440
we're going to continue the confidence. I like the game, not, I like the game too much, not to

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:24.240
continue. Just for 30 minutes, just for 30 minutes. Okay. I like it too much. I literally,

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:32.560
I'm so, this game's got me. Okay. Just for 30, just, just a little bit, just a little,

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.920
just a little bit. I'm glad you like it. I'm glad I like it too. Okay.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.640
Because I don't want to end too, too soon, you know? Great. Let me sit back. How do I do this again?

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:49.520
Oh, fuck, no!

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.040
No, what the fuck? Okay, sorry. I went back, I went to the ending screen by accident.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:11.680
Um, okay. I know she is literally me. Okay. I promise it's just for 30 minutes.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:21.440
I promise it's just for 30 minutes. Continue this one. Okay. Right, what were we trying to do?

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:29.520
Yeah, I have no choice, basically. Like, I have to play it. You know, like, like, I have to. Like,

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:36.880
I can't, I can't not. You're here with me right now, you know? Apparently approved by the devil

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:43.520
if the graffiti on the wall is anything to go by. You're here with me right now. We're here together.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:49.840
It's basically like I have to. Oh, background music is so on. Thank you for telling me.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.800
That's annoying. There we go.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.960
Uh, go back to Ashley. Okay, okay. Thank you for telling me that too.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:03.040
Thank you for holding my hand through this. Oh, shit! Okay.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.360
Ashley! I'm back.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.920
Are you done snooping on the cultist? Yeah, so there's apparently a little cultist club

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.280
where they all gather around for some demons and treats, but they can't summon for shit. Absolutely

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:27.120
nothing showed up. Nothing showed up on this end either. I don't understand. It was a vision for sure.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.760
Chapter one? Aren't we on chapter two? I thought we were on chapter two.

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.960
Can you pull chat down a bit? Oh, no. Oh, here. Here's what I can do.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:54.240
I'll make it smaller for you. There we go. So now you can actually read what they say.

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.360
There you go. Yeah, we're on chapter two. Thank you for telling me that too.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.840
Okay, um, I don't understand. It was a vision for sure. There was like...

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.400
You hear a car?

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:22.080
That's him. That's the guy who slid our throats in my dream. So the first guy wasn't him.

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.480
Yikes. He really just went in our room like that. You still doubted me? Where'd he get the key?

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.760
Should we just leave? We're supposed to vacate the room in the morning anyway.

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.520
Our stuff was still in there. What stuff we sold off most of the junkie we're hoarding?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I am not a hoarder. It's important stuff to me. Ten out of ten. Thank you.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:52.640
And I can live without the trash and laundry. Well, like someone pointed out, we can't keep

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:58.720
wasting money buying new clothes. I am not risking my life getting in there to rescue our socks.

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:07.440
Well, I am. I like my socks. What's this game about? It's about me and my life story.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:15.040
I like my socks. I put a lot of effort into finding cute socks.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.560
It's my better bra. Actually, this new one sucks. I don't wear bras.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.440
Still not interested. In fact, I'm somehow even less inclined now.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:29.040
Scuff. You know nothing of my troubles.

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.120
Regardless, I think we have to kill that guy though.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.560
This is no random burglary. He's specifically, he's specifically after us for whatever reason.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.040
Yeah, it's a game about us.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:52.080
No bra, just band-aids. It's actually tape. It's black tape. It's not, it's not band-aids.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.840
I don't wear bras either. I am also a man. I am, I am also a man.

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.000
I'm kidding. Um, this is no random burglary. He's specifically after us for whatever reason.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.040
Like somehow he tracked us down. So even if we run away now, we won't, won't he keep coming after us?

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:23.120
That's not wrong, but why is he still in the room? We're not even in there. Well, if I was him,

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:30.400
I'd figure, I'd figure we're getting, we're, ah, I'd figure, I'd figure, I'd figure we're out getting

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.240
food or something. So now he's probably waiting to kill us upon entry.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:38.560
Unlikely, since he wants to go about this quietly.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.600
I say one wrong thing and you guys are all up on me.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.320
He's definitely hiding in that closet or something, waiting for us to go back to sleep.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.640
Then he'll kill us in our sleep, just like in my vision, again. And you know this how?

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.440
I know because that's what I do. Duh. Plus he's using a knife. So there.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:14.320
Listen, Andrew, just trust me. I thought about these things. You question, you question not why

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.880
she's thought about such things. Now, enough dilly dallying. Let's get in there and pretend we forgot

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:27.840
something. Minor, minor smelling air. Oh my God. That was not even on purpose. Okay, context.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:33.840
I posted an audio on Twitter and instead of the word though, I typed out thought.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.280
I meant to type out though, but instead I typed out thought and I

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.600
I quote, tweeted it saying like, I'm going to kill myself. I made a minor spelling error

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:54.160
in my horny post, but instead of spelling error, I wrote smelling error.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.080
Thoughts and prayers.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:07.440
Then we'll lure him somewhere less conspicuous. And then what? You have to ask? Sigh.

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.000
Let's go kill that guy.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.440
Actually, he's still armed. They can take this guy. Yeah, she has a gun.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:23.280
The hitman is nowhere to be seen. He's got to be in there, right? I didn't see him leave. Go in.

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.520
Leave this to me. This has got to be the stupidest thing we've done so far. No, let's go kill him.

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.480
Personally, I think shooting fireworks indoors was dumb, but hey, opinions,

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:40.160
which if I may add was also your idea. No, it wasn't. I was 12. You should have stopped me.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:46.720
So should I talk you out of this one or no, shut up. Follow my lead. She's just like me.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.120
I know, right? He's being such a little pussy. Let's just kill him.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:01.360
You are Ashley. Yes, I am. That's fucking right. Go in the closet.

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:11.600
Oh gosh, Jolly Andrew. I just realized our impromptu night walk to the store has left me barged.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:19.280
Is that so? Let us return to the gas stop at once. And since we want to be also quick about it,

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:26.880
let's take a shortcut through the park where we may frolic amongst the foliage shielded from sight.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.280
I love the hitman music. Is this hitman music?

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:43.280
It's kind of loud for me. How's that sound? Huh? Terrific. Let's go.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.880
Not so fast. Let me grab my things first. I just realized that I don't trust the staff here.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:58.800
Given that you're about to roam around with a hitman around, would you like to save the game?

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.480
Should I save or should I not save?

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.640
Stop talking British. What do you mean? Do you want me to talk British?

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:16.240
Should I go British mode for the last bit? Save? All right. I'm going to save.

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:27.040
I'm going to write this save. Be a good girl and save. I'm always a good girl. All right, let's do it.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:33.360
Well, congratulations. You have found the hitman and died, which is the best part.

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.200
There's more of the record. Andrew doesn't fare much better. When it comes to cutting people up,

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:47.680
I'm losing the accent. When it comes to cutting people up, the hitman whoops his amateur ass dead.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.800
Though, given his romantic streak, he probably didn't want to live without you anyway.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.880
Good. Good. He shouldn't. I mean, he shouldn't.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:05.920
I bet you'd be happy about that if you weren't too fucking dead to feel anything.

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:13.360
The hitman wins and, ah yes, the world is much better off without you. However,

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:19.520
this is also anticlimactic. You get a free do over. All right, good thing I saved.

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:28.080
Yes, it is Emmy. It is Emmy. I know I'm really good at doing a British accent.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:36.240
It's really hard to tell. It's really hard to tell that I'm not British.

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:47.600
You know, Shibi mentioned this earlier. But the other girls have told us that we sound the same.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.760
And I thought of a good idea for like an April Fool's joke. Maybe Shibi should become me for

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:59.840
one day. And I should become Shibi, else you run Shibi's channel and you won't even be able to tell

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:08.160
the difference because we sound so similar, right? Right? Say yes. You like British Emmy?

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:16.880
Oh, good. Can we go? I didn't pick up my things yet. Come on, hurry up.

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:21.920
Okay, actually, where the fuck am I supposed to go? What am I supposed to do? Oh.

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.560
Got washed laundry. I'm trying to not talk in the accent anymore.

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:37.120
Indubitably. You'd be able to tell the difference? I don't know. I think if I practice, I might be

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:42.080
able to get it good. Pretty good. I just need to practice. Okay, genuinely, what am I supposed to

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:49.040
do? Can we go now? Holding the door open for me, are we? What a gentleman. Just letting in some

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:54.960
fresh air in the sounds of the city. Hurry up and get your things. I did. Okay, now what are we supposed

01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:03.440
to do? Are we done? I would figure it out. I could always spot my cutie motel. I'm not sure.

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.680
I've never actually been told I sound like anyone ever.

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.800
Which is a good thing, I guess, because that means I sound, you know,

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.760
you know, original, I guess. Other than Shibi, I guess.

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.200
Head to the park? Is this the park?

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:36.400
Oh. Here we are. Is he coming after us or not? I don't know. I thought he would.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:40.560
Let's pick a corner we can ambush him from. What corner? It's all bushes.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.360
Um, I don't know behind a bush.

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.760
An abandoned shopping cart. Very classy.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:58.320
You sound like Imi. I know. One of a kind. There's only one me. Oh my god, that reminds me.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:03.680
I probably shouldn't bring up drama, but I want to talk about it. Did you guys see the Twitter,

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:12.080
the VTuber on Twitter, that like, here, the street will hide us nicely, allegedly, allegedly,

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:18.720
copied, like, Shiley Lee's design and also her voice.

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.920
I love drama too much not to talk about it.

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.080
What are we going to do if he just stays at the motel? Well, I guess we'll just leave then.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.760
We'll grow eyes in the back of our heads and keep watching over our shoulders at all times.

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:42.960
Yeah, you saw it. You saw it. It wasn't that so crazy. I saw the VTuber before, like,

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.880
they kept getting in drama, like, little dramas here and there about,

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:55.440
about, like, copying Shiley Lee's design, but then I think when the voice clip came out, it was like,

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:59.040
way, way worse. It got bigger.

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.000
A YouTube video on that didn't watch it though.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.880
I wonder how anyone even remotely familiar with the VTubing scene has not seen it.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:16.400
I don't know. It depends how chronically online you are, especially on Twitter.

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:21.360
What a pain. I can't believe I'm actually hoping he'd show up now.

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:26.800
Good. Don't feel bad about murdering a murder. And on that note, not it.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.360
You're making me do it again?

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:36.240
Yes. Dude only has a knife. You got this.

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:38.720
I hear footsteps.

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.800
Ashley, wait. I've never fired a gun.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:44.160
Crap. I think he stopped. I can't hear anything anymore.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:46.320
You can't ambush a killer that's waiting to ambush you.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.120
And you can't very well start looking for him.

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.400
I'll let you use Twitter for art.

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.200
Well, maybe it still showed up on your, on your page.

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.240
Ashley, it's such a rat.

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.400
I've erased every girl from my mind except Emmy.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.080
Perfect. That's exactly what I want.

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:09.360
Yeah. Why are you, why are you even saying that you saw this drama?

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.440
Huh? Are you looking at other girls on Twitter?

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.920
Why are you even admitting to me?

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.960
Okay. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.560
I like drama too much not to talk about it with you.

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.600
I use Twitter for art too.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:26.900
Art.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.280
Crap. Did we whisper too loudly?

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.240
Is he onto us?

01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:34.400
Why do you stop to see what we're up to?

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.520
Bet this all looks suspicious as hell.

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.320
This doesn't look like anything.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.720
He shouldn't even be able to see us from behind this.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.000
You dirty boy. No, we can't do it here.

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.600
Tee hee. Off I go. Come and find me.

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.840
I don't want to.

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.640
Ashley, seriously. I don't, I don't know how this thing works.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.560
No peeking. What is she, what is she doing?

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.520
Does your alt count as other girls?

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.720
No. Cause my alt is me.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.800
I only checked Twitter to see me.

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.240
So I don't actually, oh my God.

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.960
Really? You actually, thank you.

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.880
You actually checked Twitter for me?

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.400
That's nice of you.

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:28.080
Um, uh-oh.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.440
Oh, I'm back to being Andrew.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:32.080
God damn it.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.320
He doesn't know how to use a revolver.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.600
What a noob.

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:41.600
Time has come to play hide and seek with the killer and Ashley.

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.680
Um, Ashley.

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.640
Not much else.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.920
Nothing. Didn't she go this direction?

01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.360
This way? Nothing.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:00.480
Here?

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.200
An attempt or several have been made to please trash where it belongs.

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.200
They were so, they were all so close but couldn't quite stick the landing.

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:13.840
Ashley, you're scaring me.

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:15.200
Nothing.

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.160
There's nothing but trash in this bush.

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:23.200
People think they are so clever hiding their candy wrappers in beer cans.

01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.800
What do you mean this isn't going to end well? Save?

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:32.960
Okay.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.360
It looks like someone has gone through the bushes here.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.200
Ashley.

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:43.760
Ah! No!

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.520
Uh, shoot!

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.920
I did it! I didn't even need to, I didn't even need to reload the game.

01:52:59.120 --> 01:52:59.920
Uh-oh.

01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:03.440
If you find him fire once, wait, I fired multiple times.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.600
Ashley reclaimed her gun.

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.400
Oh, fuck! I fired multiple times. Is that bad?

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.560
Is it going to come back to haunt me?

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:17.920
Uh-oh. No more gun out of ammo.

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.360
Oh, shit.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:24.560
I get, and I walked in and I started blasting him.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:26.560
I panicked.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:27.920
This thing is useless now.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:29.920
No one knows it's empty.

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:31.360
I guess so.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:32.880
Do they still bullets to just anyone?

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:33.840
Do you need a license?

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.880
Should I reload?

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:38.800
Should I reload?

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.120
Can I not get sex ending without reloading?

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:43.280
What do I do?

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:46.720
Reload the save.

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:52.560
Okay, I'll reload.

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:54.000
I have no idea.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:54.720
Sorry, Ashley.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.480
Although I wouldn't have wasted them at all if you hadn't made me shoot him.

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.040
Are we still playing the finger pointing game?

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:02.640
I thought we'd agree to leave that behind.

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:05.680
Let's just get out of here before someone sees us.

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:07.600
Oh yeah, and what the fuck was that?

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:08.240
What was what?

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:11.520
You running off out of the blue.

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.000
What? You need an excuse to start rummaging through the bushes.

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.800
Now that the hitman thought you were looking for me,

01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:18.240
he sat there waiting to kill you.

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:22.320
That's your concern?

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.680
Of course it's my fucking concern.

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:27.920
No reload needed for that part.

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:34.560
So should I reload or should I not reload?

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.880
He didn't know you had a gun and would kill him.

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:41.440
Instead, I'm a bloody genius.

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.720
And what if he was in the bush you ran off to, huh?

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:45.600
Genius?

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:46.320
Well, he wasn't.

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.480
Quit your bitching.

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.600
It all worked out.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.840
Clue me in the next time you have these genius ideas.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.840
Yeah, that's literally why we started the game.

01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.840
I'm getting that fucking ending.

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.400
Reload so you can do it again.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:07.360
Okay, I'll reload.

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:12.240
All right, he was over here.

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.720
I'm only going to shoot him once.

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:17.680
Shoot.

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.360
I did it.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:22.560
Nice work.

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.960
I have a few choice words to say to you,

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.600
but this is neither time nor the place.

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.400
Say them to me.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.760
Degrade me for it.

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.560
Let's get going before someone comes to see what's up.

01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.440
Those extra five bullets might come in handy.

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.080
Okay, thank you.

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.120
Yeah, first try, first try.

01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:41.840
Got it first try.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:53.840
Okay, quit your bitching.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.560
It all worked out.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:56.160
Okay.

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:01.200
Good girl, not unloading on someone else.

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.400
I would only unload it all on you.

01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:11.680
Okay, let me see that.

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:12.960
Okay.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.560
Okay, now where do I go?

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:22.800
Back to the hotel?

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.120
That's what I want to hear.

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.480
Oh, can we look in this car?

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:33.600
It's locked.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:38.880
You know, it would have been pretty smart of me to steal his car keys before coming here.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.400
You sure it sure would have.

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.360
I'm dumb as a stone.

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:42.240
What's your excuse?

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:47.120
I am at the mercy of thy whim, Starling sister.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.280
Well, you should read my mind then, God damn.

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.520
My bad must be lack of sleep.

01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:53.280
I'm sure he's still right where we left him.

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:54.160
All right.

01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.280
Yeah, let's steal his car.

01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:56.320
I didn't think about that.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.200
Give me all two inches.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.480
Shut your horn mouth.

01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:02.560
It's bigger than two inches.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:10.800
As long as no one saw us do it, who's going to have a clue it was us?

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.200
How this guy carries knives with him?

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.480
He's clearly a criminal.

01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:18.320
Maybe the authorities will assume his friends got to him or something.

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:20.480
Do you prefer shoot or shoot?

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:22.800
Well, I prefer the right ending shoot.

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.200
Don't check the tree.

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.080
Ever the optimus.

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.520
Hmm.

01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.000
Whatever.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.640
Let's just go before someone comes to walk their dog or something.

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:40.480
He called me baby.

01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:43.280
Ah, yeah, baby.

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.200
Leave those fingerprints all over the guy.

01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:46.480
That's just great.

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.400
I'm sure you meant to say something else.

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.240
I guess it doesn't matter since you've never gotten your fingerprints taken.

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:52.720
Have you?

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:53.760
Yeah.

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:55.200
Motherfucker.

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:55.840
What for?

01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:57.120
My driver's license.

01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:58.080
Well, good thing it's me.

01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:58.720
Manhandling.

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:00.320
Oh, my God.

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.920
I don't have my driver's license either.

01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:06.800
Oh, my God.

01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:07.520
That's so funny.

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:09.280
Okay.

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.160
Let's go get the car.

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:16.320
Is this driving simulator?

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:20.720
Am I going to have to know what?

01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.840
Are we supposed to meditate mindlessly?

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.280
Sits on top of his car seat.

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.520
Amy doesn't drive?

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.320
No, I don't drive.

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.280
I don't know how to drive.

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.680
Driver's license are just a suggestion.

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:38.240
Exactly.

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:39.840
You don't have to drive.

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:41.280
Public transport is fine.

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:44.080
If you live in a city with good public transport, that is.

01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.440
Newspaper cutouts of various incidents.

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:51.520
Most of them are about your old apartment,

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:54.160
both the tainted water and the fire situation.

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.840
There's also an article from last week

01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:57.840
about some chemical leak in some other city.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.080
I'll drive you around.

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:02.480
Thank you.

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:04.000
I'll be your passenger, princess.

01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:07.360
You can drive without a license

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.400
as long as you don't get caught.

01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:10.240
I'm going to get fucking caught.

01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:15.520
Um, is that all we needed?

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.840
I can't go in the front seat, can I?

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:19.840
Oh, I can.

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:22.240
Oh, my God.

01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.600
Look at him sitting on my lap.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.840
All right, let's, let's see.

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:28.240
Oh, see if this guy has anything interesting in his car.

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:30.800
So much for not leaving fingerprints.

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:32.320
It's a little late to worry about that.

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:34.160
You've already touched the door, the handle, the wheel.

01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:36.160
It's fine if it's me, right?

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:40.880
I fell in love with various papers

01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:42.720
inside the most notable one reads,

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:44.080
Dear Mr. Washing Machine,

01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:46.640
consider this a receipt for your cleaning service.

01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:50.640
We're extremely grateful that you accepted

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.400
to clean our laundry for us.

01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:57.600
Am I tall enough to drive?

01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:58.880
I can use a booster seat.

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:04.240
Isn't Waymo like expending into more cities,

02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:07.600
self-driving cars or no future thing anymore?

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.600
That sounds dangerous.

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:11.920
That sounds dangerous.

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:16.240
I don't think I should be in a self-driving car.

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.560
We're so confident in your services

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:25.200
that we will not be needing any progress reports.

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:27.360
In fact, please do not contact us

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:29.040
if anyone were to ask,

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.720
the less we know, the better.

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:32.960
As a bonus, we've included free samples

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.320
of all the new soda flavors

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:35.920
from our sister company, Happy Washing.

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:38.480
Are we the laundry?

02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.200
Seems that way.

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.040
Yikes.

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.960
All right, let's get this motherfucker on the road.

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.160
Right, right.

02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:50.560
I like driving.

02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:51.680
It's common.

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:54.160
Driving is so freaking anxiety-inducing.

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.040
I hate driving.

02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:57.680
Um.

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.680
Use my laugh instead.

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:03.840
That's dangerous, too.

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:05.840
I'm not breaking the law.

02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:10.160
We should go.

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:11.680
Where to?

02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:12.480
Could you elaborate?

02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.840
We're off to somewhere, right?

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:14.880
Got the car and everything.

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:17.120
This isn't exactly the best situation

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:19.920
to go joy-riding in a stolen car.

02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:22.640
We barely even have enough money to feed us.

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:23.120
Fine.

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.160
Let's go take-

02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:25.280
Let's go take moms.

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.120
For fuck's sake, does everything I say

02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:30.800
go in one ear and out the other?

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:31.280
Yes.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.640
We're never going to talk to anyone

02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.240
we know ever again, remember?

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:38.960
Did I say squad about talking to her?

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:41.280
Let's go rob the bitch, blind, and leave.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.120
Amy, you're blushing, by the way.

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.280
I know I'm blushing because I'm playing this game.

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:52.720
Self-driving cars don't get tired, drunk, sleepy, or emotional?

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.560
Emotional?

02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:55.440
Oh, I guess so.

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:03.120
What money do you think she has exactly?

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.400
I'm sure she's got something.

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:07.280
I thought she inherited some jewelry from grandma.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.040
Oh yeah, but she can't sell those.

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:11.280
She can't, but I sure can!

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.320
Oh no, we still can't go over there.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.520
I do love you.

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:20.320
Shut up.

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:21.200
I do love you.

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.760
I do feel bad for the father?

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:26.240
Why?

02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:34.960
Andy is you.

02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.840
Don't worry, Andy is you and I am Lele.

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:42.000
We've got pursuers or something.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.040
Our parents' place is definitely something they've looked into.

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.560
Listen, Andy, wrong.

02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.640
Andrew, the pursuer is taking a nap in the park right now.

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.600
Do you honestly think you're anywhere near important enough for someone to hire too?

02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:01.280
If anything, it seems they assume that guy took care of us and that's that.

02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:04.960
But the thing is I'd rather be overly cautious than dead.

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:08.560
Best we let her find out, what do you mean?

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:14.000
Wait, did I get something wrong?

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.880
Does the mom- was that spoilers?

02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:31.520
We'll be quick.

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:33.920
Don't spoil her chat.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.920
Wait, is that what you mean by she likes Andy?

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:37.520
Were you talking about someone else?

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:39.760
Okay, okay, okay.

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.320
So now you want to kill our parents?

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:42.880
Great.

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.680
You just said we can't talk to them anyways, so they might as well be dead.

02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:46.320
Holy shit.

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.480
I'm way too tired for this.

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.680
Fine, we'll just rob them then.

02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:52.400
Break in while they're at work, get some money and then get lost.

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:53.680
I'll take it.

02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:56.640
Where do they live now anyways?

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:00.880
I know the place but I don't remember the exact address.

02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:02.720
She actually told you the address?

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:03.040
Yeah.

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.760
Huh, the only thing she told me was to stop calling her.

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:08.000
She probably figured I'd tell you then.

02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:11.840
I was talking about you like Andy.

02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:13.600
Well, I like both of you.

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:18.720
Do forgive me, Ashley.

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:21.120
It didn't seem like relevant information at the time.

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:22.640
Whatever, just drive.

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:24.160
Wait, he's driving?

02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:26.560
Will we be fine?

02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:28.160
Just don't distract me with anything.

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:30.320
Okey-dokey.

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.840
Feet on the floor.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.240
My god, it's not even your car.

02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.520
Shut up and put your seatbelt on.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:45.760
This sucks.

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:46.480
Yeah, it sucks.

02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:47.200
No hurry up.

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:52.000
It'll be, it'll be goddamned if we get caught in that dead man's car.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.400
Just because we got pulled over for some stupid shit.

02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:56.160
He's a foot finishes?

02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:56.880
Is he actually?

02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.600
Was he gonna get distracted by her feet?

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:02.800
Huh, is that why he took them off?

02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:11.120
I do like it when a girl puts her feet on the dash.

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:12.080
That's why I do it.

02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:14.880
Make me then.

02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.160
Do you or do you not want to go rob her parents?

02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:21.920
I said, I said make me, Andy.

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:24.240
Okay, what do you want?

02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:27.120
If it's to piss me off, then you're nailing it right now.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:28.560
Oh come on, it's just a joke.

02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:31.840
Ah!

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:34.880
I know it's not a joke.

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:37.760
Yeah, it is.

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:38.720
You get so mad.

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:39.520
It's just funny.

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:44.080
Like, I don't know you, Ashley.

02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:45.200
You pulled this shit before.

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:54.000
You'll keep going, Andy, Andy, until I get tired of correcting you.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.200
Yes, I will!

02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:59.680
And suddenly it's Andy and Lele and stupid bullshit all over again.

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:01.760
Way to read into it.

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:03.680
I was honestly just joking around.

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.800
Well then it's not funny and you're going to stop.

02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:12.320
Nothing is funny to you anymore.

02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:19.760
Well, are you going to drive or what?

02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:21.840
Ashley is hot?

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:22.720
I know she is.

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:28.240
I just don't want us to get in trouble.

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.360
But you don't have to be such a hard ass about it.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:34.880
I do, though, when you're such a dumbass about it.

02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.560
You're a dumbass, too!

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:37.200
Just drive.

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:39.360
Are you angry?

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.160
I'm looking out for us.

02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:40.720
Yes, I am!

02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:42.560
Fucking drive, Andy!

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:48.080
Drive, Andrew.

02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:51.600
And so he does, finally.

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:54.640
And you decide to give Andrew the silent treatment until you apologize.

02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:58.000
I do that, too.

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:01.280
I do.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.720
I love the angst, too.

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:04.640
I love it when they argue.

02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:06.000
That's my favorite thing ever.

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:11.680
I do give people the silent treatment when I'm mad at them.

02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:14.960
You're not sure what he needs to apologize for exactly,

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.400
but you won't forgive him until he does.

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:19.120
Because he was a little bitch to me.

02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:20.640
And coming hot moment?

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:21.920
Yeah, gaslight and girlboss.

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:25.120
So while you wait for him to notice,

02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.640
you're not talking to him, you fall asleep.

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:29.040
Uh-oh.

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:30.240
Another dream.

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:35.120
Amy, you're such a w-

02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.120
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:41.120
Huh?

02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:43.840
What is that supposed to mean?

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:45.440
Call me a woman again, bitch.

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.200
I'll show you how big my dick is!

02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:53.600
But at the same time, you feel wide awake.

02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.760
Where am I?

02:07:59.360 --> 02:07:59.840
Hmm?

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:06.080
Stop!

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:08.960
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:09.600
I'm sorry.

02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:10.080
I'm sorry.

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:10.560
I'm sorry.

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:11.040
I'm sorry.

02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:11.600
I'm sorry.

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:12.000
I'm sorry.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:12.560
I'm sorry.

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:13.200
I'm sorry.

02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:15.040
Oh, Arce.

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:15.920
Your soul.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:16.400
Huh?

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:16.720
What?

02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:18.800
Who's there?

02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.440
Where are you?

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:21.200
Where am I?

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:22.720
Is this another vision or what?

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:24.240
There's no response.

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:28.240
Oh, this note.

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:29.520
I kinda wanna do it now.

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:30.000
Shut up!

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:31.600
Shut up!

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:33.920
Huh?

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:36.800
Where am I supposed to go?

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:44.160
I'm lost.

02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:46.480
Oh, can I go in the top right?

02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:47.920
I mean top left.

02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:52.400
Upper right.

02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:54.080
Pick the red flowers.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:02.080
Can I not pick them?

02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:04.640
I can't pick them.

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:06.800
On the bottom.

02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:11.680
There's no...

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:12.160
I can't.

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:14.800
Ahem.

02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:20.960
Red flowers make the path.

02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.560
Pick red flowers to make path.

02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.400
Is there other flowers that I'm not seeing?

02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:30.640
Interact with the top right path.

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.160
And then I have to pick them.

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:42.160
Right?

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:44.720
There we go.

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:47.520
Ah, I'm so smart.

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:47.840
Okay.

02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.040
There we go.

02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:55.760
I hate mezes.

02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.040
There's nothing to step on.

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:00.000
Okay, I can tell!

02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.960
I know I'm blind, but I have my glasses on now.

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:06.320
Tarsal summoned you.

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.200
Can't tune in.

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:08.560
You're all muffled.

02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:09.440
I can't hear anything.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.520
The voice continues talking,

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.840
but you can't make heads or tails of it.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:22.480
You scatter petals to keep going.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:24.800
Okay, okay, okay.

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:27.200
I keep fucking blinking like a frog.

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:29.760
Why do I blink like that?

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:33.280
I promise I'm not blinking like that in real life.

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:35.840
I have to fart, but I'm not gonna do it.

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:37.680
Actually, no, I'll mute my mic to do it.

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:44.240
Okay, I did it.

02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:45.120
Wait, I have to do it again.

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:49.760
No, it's not coming out.

02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:54.960
Whatever, I should focus on getting out of here.

02:10:58.480 --> 02:10:59.600
Oh shit, it's connected.

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:02.960
Are there other flowers?

02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:05.680
My mute?

02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.200
Because you've been a bad boy today,

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.600
so you don't deserve to hear any...

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.880
Oh, fuck, it's connected.

02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:22.960
Fuck!

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:23.520
Where am I?

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.480
Everything looks the same.

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:29.280
Take these flowers and then make a path to go here.

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:31.280
Was I?

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.360
It's been 30 minutes.

02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:36.800
Let me get to the hot scene.

02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:37.920
Isn't the hot scene coming?

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:41.280
What are these?

02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:46.080
Uh-oh.

02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:48.320
Uh-oh.

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:49.920
Hello.

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:52.480
I see why I summoned you before, right?

02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:55.760
I know, I mean.

02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:57.120
I like to tease you a little bit.

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:02.480
No, I still love you.

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.120
You think I don't love you anymore?

02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:06.560
Because I won't let you hear me fart.

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:08.880
Where am I?

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:10.720
In a dream, I called you here.

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:11.760
Well, can you wake me up then?

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:13.440
I was in the middle of something.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:14.400
Doesn't even occur to you

02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:16.960
that you should be afraid of this soul-stealing creature.

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:19.680
You got a long way into the hot scene?

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.680
What? I thought someone said hot scene incoming.

02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:23.620
Hmm?

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:31.520
The hot part comes after you meet your parents.

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:33.120
Oh, man.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:34.500
Um.

02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:40.240
I'm- I'm literally-

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:42.000
I'm really debating on continuing.

02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:48.960
No, I'm not going to do it.

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:49.520
I can't, I can't.

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:50.800
I don't want- I don't want to burn out.

02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:52.400
I really- I- I can't.

02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:54.160
Okay, wait.

02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.440
Let me get out of this cut scene.

02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:58.480
What if Andrew tries to talk to me?

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:00.400
He needs to know I'm deliberately ignoring him

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.160
instead of being in a coma or something.

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:04.800
The demon couldn't care less about

02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:06.560
the lover's pet you're having with your brother.

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:09.280
It carries on as if you hadn't said a thing.

02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:10.160
You used my gift.

02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:11.600
What?

02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:12.400
Was it useful?

02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:13.600
Seeing the future?

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:16.000
Yes, the ticket- the trinket you gave me.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.520
Um, yes, it's been very useful.

02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.000
Thank you.

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.680
Then, do you want to see the future again?

02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:23.680
Sure, I just have to keep holding on to it, right?

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:25.520
It is out of energy.

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.560
I'm able to recharge it.

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:29.760
Do you want to make a deal?

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:30.480
Of course you do.

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.720
Very nice scene incoming still- oh.

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.200
You're confusing me!

02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:40.480
Never has it ever been a bad deal

02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:41.680
to make deals with devils.

02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:43.360
A bad idea.

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:44.480
Let's hear it then, what do you want?

02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:46.240
Human souls.

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:47.440
Well, you're not getting mine,

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:49.520
so if that's- if that was it,

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.440
then not yours, tar soul.

02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:53.840
Is that like an insult or something?

02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:56.640
Who's then?

02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:57.520
Just anybody's?

02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:00.240
And why do you- why do you go-

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:02.080
why don't you go get some souls yourself?

02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:04.640
I cannot enter the human realm unsummoned.

02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:06.400
Like, you cannot enter here.

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:10.080
I am able to reach you only because of my talisman.

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:12.720
But even then, one can only interact

02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:14.560
between realms through deals.

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:15.200
Do we have a deal?

02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:17.760
I don't really get it,

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:20.000
but I can't say I'm all that interested either.

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.040
It's been just over 30 minutes, too.

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:23.680
I know.

02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:28.400
There's a lot of good scenes,

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:30.400
but the one you want is a couple hours away.

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:30.960
The sex!

02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.720
Listen, I really need to go back to my brother.

02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:37.680
If I offer you a soul,

02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.720
you'll make my talisman trinket dream thing work again, right?

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:41.920
Correct.

02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:42.480
Sounds good.

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:44.480
I do have a soul or two in mind, actually,

02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:46.480
but I'll see what Andrew has to say about it.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:49.920
He's kinda- I don't know.

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:50.960
Something is shifting.

02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:51.840
I don't really like it.

02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:57.120
I probably wasn't the right entity to talk about this.

02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:57.920
I will be waiting.

02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.120
Right, all right.

02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:00.000
I'll see what I can do.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.040
So how do I wake up?

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:03.040
You wake up once your mind returns home.

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:03.760
Huh?

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.640
Farewell, Tarsoul.

02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:09.440
Sags?

02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:10.720
Gags?

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:12.640
Gay gags?

02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:22.240
Okay, which direction should I go?

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.520
Up or- or upper left?

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:27.280
Say gags?

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:27.840
Gags?

02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:33.200
Oh, I guess I can go both directions.

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:35.760
Left.

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:36.240
Okay.

02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.120
I just want to get out of this demon place.

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:49.600
Um...

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.120
Oh, there's flowers in the top left.

02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:04.800
I want to see Andrew before we end.

02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:06.480
Okay, I'll try to get you to Andrew.

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:07.920
Here you go.

02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:12.240
Okay, I'm guessing we're not supposed to go through that door.

02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:12.640
Right.

02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:14.320
Right.

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:18.000
Why was that a 4 out of 10?

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:18.640
That was good.

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:20.080
That was nice and loud and clear.

02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:22.240
Which door?

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:23.760
The left one, right?

02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:30.720
Yes, 9 out of 10, 9 out of 10, 9 out of 10.

02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:31.680
The left one, right?

02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:43.120
Let's do right.

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:45.840
You don't know?

02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:49.920
Save and follow your heart.

02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.480
Am I going through the right one?

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:56.480
No, why not?

02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:00.400
God, I have to pee.

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:01.200
I'm going to hold it in.

02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.640
I'm going to hold it in just for you.

02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:05.440
Um, whatever this is, it looks unfinished.

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:08.000
Okay.

02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:16.480
Oh, shit.

02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:21.920
Let it out just for us.

02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.600
I can't do it on my chair here.

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:29.600
Isn't that a fetish?

02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:30.960
Pissing on you?

02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:35.680
Um, I'm guessing they all have to look towards that thing, right?

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:47.040
Did I finish it?

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:50.320
Did I finish it?

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:52.800
Hold it as long as possible.

02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:58.320
You're trying to, you're doing something to me here.

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:03.440
Okay.

02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:06.400
Now it's complete.

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:08.960
Parcel.

02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:10.160
Yes.

02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:12.320
Well, hello again.

02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:14.400
This is not the path to your home.

02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.320
Oh, up here is my realm.

02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.360
You must return to your own.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I thought I was already in the demon world.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.600
This is the realm in between.

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:22.640
Entering the wrong well.

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:23.280
Well.

02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:27.760
Trust the process.

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.400
Okay, I'll listen to you.

02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:36.480
So it's fine as long as you are summoned.

02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:37.840
Why not just summon me to your realm?

02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.880
Why summon me here in this crap land instead?

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:42.480
Return home, Tarzel.

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.920
I'm expecting those souls.

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:46.880
You can't tell me there's another realm and not show it to me.

02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:48.400
Return now.

02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:51.520
Uh, leave me alone.

02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:53.520
Where am I now?

02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:55.200
This is so tiresome.

02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.200
And I've had it up to here with these stupid flowers.

02:18:59.440 --> 02:18:59.840
Die.

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:00.800
Die.

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:02.640
Yeah, fuck these flowers.

02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:03.440
Fuck your flowers.

02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:04.480
Fuck you and your flowers.

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:05.600
I'm going to break them all.

02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:06.960
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.320
I'm going to stomp on them all.

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:11.360
Let me out of here.

02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:13.760
Ah!

02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:18.800
You'll hold it until we give you finish.

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:25.040
Yes, I know.

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.800
And he's not you.

02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.640
Help, get me out of this shit hole.

02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:34.480
Come on, wake me up.

02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:35.840
It's not funny.

02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:37.280
I'm trying, jackass.

02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:39.520
Do something.

02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:40.000
Help me.

02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:45.200
Oh, thank god.

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:49.840
I was a hair away from taking you to the hospital.

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.240
Huh?

02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:50.960
Why?

02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:52.560
That would screw us over, wouldn't it?

02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:54.960
You wouldn't wake up no matter what I did.

02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:56.640
God, Ashley, don't scare me like that.

02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:00.640
Ah, stop calling me a good girl.

02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.240
I'm trying to focus on the cave.

02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:06.560
My whole freaking body is like really freaking...

02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:09.920
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:10.480
I can't, I can't.

02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:12.880
Okay, mom and dad should be both...

02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:13.040
Both...

02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:16.720
Mom and dad should both be at work right now.

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:20.480
Whenever you're ready, I guess.

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:24.240
You're only being nice now because you treated me like shit last night.

02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:28.640
I treated you the way you deserved to be treated.

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:29.840
No, you didn't!

02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:31.840
Yeah, scratch that.

02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:34.400
Considering you kept pushing me around all day,

02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:35.680
I think I was pretty fucking lenient.

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:38.160
Piss.

02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:41.840
I'm not feeling anything.

02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:42.880
I'm not feeling anything.

02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:43.840
I'm not feeling anything.

02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:44.960
I'm not feeling anything.

02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:46.080
I'm not feeling anything.

02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:53.280
This episode is titled

02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:56.320
Andrew and Ashley and the Home Sweet Home Invasion.

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.720
What kind of knockoff cash grab show is that?

02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:01.680
I'm not interested.

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:04.720
Now you know how you make us feel?

02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:06.080
I guess so.

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:12.720
Well, it's definitely all about cash grabbing.

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:14.640
Haha.

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:16.000
I mean, boo, no thank you.

02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.320
No, I saw that you're into it.

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:18.800
Let's go.

02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:21.040
No, it sucks.

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:24.240
But I'm so nice that I'll roll with it now.

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:32.480
Free parking, that's why.

02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:33.040
What?

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:43.200
Let's finish the game.

02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:43.920
Let's finish the game.

02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:46.240
Okay, okay, we're done.

02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:46.720
We're done here.

02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:47.280
We're done here.

02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:48.560
Quit.

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:50.080
I can't.

02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:50.560
I can't.

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:51.040
I can't.

02:21:58.640 --> 02:21:59.280
Fucking hell.

02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:08.400
Um, um, um, um, um, um, um.
