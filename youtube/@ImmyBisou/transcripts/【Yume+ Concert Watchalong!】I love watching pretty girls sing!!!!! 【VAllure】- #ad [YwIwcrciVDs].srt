Sorry, I died welcome back shibi. Thank you zero. Are you wanting to get off on stage?

183
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Oh

184
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm asking is there if she wants to go up on stage because she's watching this

185
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
I think her makes fucking dying

186
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Yeah, we can't really hear you

187
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Azura, are you alive?

188
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,800
Uh, she's muted again. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I'll take that. She's so excited. She's so so excited to get up on

189
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
She just ran away. She's like

190
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,680
At the thought at the concept

191
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Let me get let me get two pen lights out. I don't have different colors. I only have blue

192
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,280
I have so many questions for them that how long this took this is insane. I know

193
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
They should just like take the

194
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
The soundtracks here and just post them as song covers too

195
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
Honestly, that's a smart idea. I think they should I think they will

196
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,320
You think they will I hope so because it's really good. They shouldn't just leave it here on the stream

197
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,200
Like I want to I want full song covers

198
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,920
Let us hear your lungs this tiny jellyfish got lungs on our two goddamn

199
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Azura is taking away my pen lights

200
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Azura knows the words

201
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,320
Is Azura singing along to it? I think that's why she's muted

202
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Damn

203
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,080
Azura don't be in the weave allegations. Oh

204
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Oh

205
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,200
This concert is epic. Literally. I had no idea what to expect. I've never actually sat through a concert before

206
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,240
Uncle uncle give us another me. I don't know. I disagree. He's dying for me. It's hard to know

207
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,960

220
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,080
If you guys had to sing a song for a concert, what would you say that's my question for you? I would rap something ridiculous

316
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,200
And the one song I really wanted her to cover is this song that's fortnite

317

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,840
Got her to battle go viral. I'll tell you that right now. This is my prediction

319
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,640
Live while she was away on holiday, but unfortunately we were having a lot of delay issues just everywhere

320
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,520
I mean just um, but she drew her own artwork for I'm getting it animated

321
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,880
And then it's been turned into a little cute video, but it's less than a minute long

322
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
So I'm gonna get it

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
I thought you were going to say tokyo drift

336
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,760
No, no, no, it's called tokyo calling and it's about how

337
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,720
dystopian your life can become if you don't kind of find the meaning of it or that's what I took away from it and it's like

338
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,440
One of the lines that really resonates me is like the girl. They're singing magnet

339
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Are they shut up?

340
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,040
I'm gonna lose it. I guess I'll hear magnet for the first time. Oh my god. I'm literally gonna cry

341
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,400

345
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
The world oh, they're doing the japanese

00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920

Creaming your jarts they were creamed long ago. Thank you reya's voice

349
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,680
I love reya's singing voice. Oh my god, she sounds so like

350
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,200
It's a little bit more mature. It's so clear. I think almost ethereal. You know, yeah

351
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,480
Absolutely every time she opens she sings it gives me servers

352
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I

353
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080

This is insane or knowledge you guys aren't supposed to know this but

You can't keep a secret for the life of you. I swear to god

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,680
I'll say oh everyone else can know that's listening into a how many meeting with the girls in august and they can

361
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,280
Have we are going to discuss alternative outfits?

Well, I already know i'm getting slime

363
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Well, that's for halloween, but like

If we're doing halloween costumes, i'm gonna need to

367
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Fill some string

368
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
If you guys want halloween costumes

369
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,440
You must tell me in the meeting because I want to be a slime girl halloween

370

I don't know what i'm gonna do for my alternate outfit

372
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I saw you do that a

373
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,680
I think I'm gonna save the gyaru idea for

374
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,080
2.0

375
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,360

376
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,880
Remember when if you guys would like to sign on for the next year

377
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,240
We also offer a free alternative outfit um on the house

378
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,560
So if you have one idea you like, but it's not what you go for we can probably cover it later

379
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Thanks, droney

380
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Again insider knowledge

381
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,280
If you uh work under viola and sign on for the next year your split goes up on further 5% in your favor

382
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,720
All right, i'm just pulling them strings

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,080

00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
First

396
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
I'll just put that that pencil

397
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,880
What's the august september october no solo for rain. No, I want to

398
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Oh

399
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Maybe it was just like short notice

400
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,720
Or maybe she wasn't feeling good. Mm-hmm. It's a lot

401
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,920
Look at ivy just bow bobbing up and down she's like yelp yelp yelp yelp i'm ready

Yeah, we love we stand kingdom hearts in this home

406
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,120
This kingdom heart is good. I never had the opportunity. I thought the plan for october was giggle sticks

407
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:16,080
No, no, no, I had oh my god the script master got an absolute bulking and I got a refund on some stuff

408
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,680
Yeah, as you should I will I'm gonna rewrite it myself. I'm not even gonna lie to you

409
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:30,400
Well, apparently he might have already rewrote it. I've not looked at it, but I'm I'm I will I'm gonna take a peek right now

410
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
Yeah, I'll take a peek

411
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,680
He replaced giggle sticks with a light stick

412
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Oh

413
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,480
Okay, I stopped meeting in the script now and it's just like fucking substitutes instead

414
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Just rate cock

415
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
It's going on caterer. It's fine

416
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Honestly

417
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
The fucking

418
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Nuzzle punch

419
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
Awful

420
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Oh, he literally just took out all of the direction

421
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,280
Oh

422
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Is that actual script usable?

423
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
He left in cock-suckery

424
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,200
Cock-suckery

425
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,840
I mean if you can overlook that is a script usable question mark, we're not gonna have to go in

426
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,520
And I honestly I've been I have a bad taste in my mouth. Oh, we'll talk about this later. We'll talk about this later

427
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,520
Concert concert concert business business business business business

428
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560

I pinned it in my chat. Just give it a cheeky like let them know that I've fucking enjoyed this because this is

435
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,560
Like I know you could argue. Oh, they're only singing a three-minute song. No behind the scenes. Are you kidding me?

436
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
There's so much stuff

437
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,400
And all while they were streaming as well on the background

438
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:22,160
They would have had to have been streaming and then like the vocal practice the warm-up practice songs record get it sent to a mixer edits

439
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,480
like just

440
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480

448
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,160

449
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Oh my sweet mercy

450
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Oh

451
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,160
I'm just gonna pretend that rain was like just tearing up on the guitar

452
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,320
Shrouding, can you play any instruments? Uh, no, I never learned I was athletic

453
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Hmm

454
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,920
Um, I was called athletics and swimming as well

455
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm running like athletics and the hardle athletics and I can just do their grippers

456
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm not being the grippers. I like someone commented on my feet

457
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,760
They were like you have very long toes and I'm like, sorry you stuffed your toes so much that they're like fucking nubs

458
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000

459
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,440
If you didn't know you're supposed to be able to walk on them not like a little stubbly fucking

460
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
She took that

461
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,600
Harmony is the melody of the heart

462
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
I

463
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Can't stop sharing it rains boobs

464
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
It's when she bounces we bounce so like

465
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Yeah, they're like in and out

466
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Oh

467
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,600
Oh my god another trio that's so impressive it's so impressive

468
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,280
He's got the lungs for this. I'm I'm tired just thinking and concept

469
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,360
Oh don't hurt him now don't hurt him

470
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
I also have long toes

471
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,440
You can really grip it with those long toes

472
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,680
Grip what

473
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
I

474
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,320
Group songs are much harder to mix together too. Oh

475
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,600
I mean, I feel like it's not hard to mix anything when it comes to these girls because they just naturally sound perfect

476
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Yeah

477
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
They're singing voices. Yeah

478
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
Stoney can clap real good

479
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
Grip in the grippy stick with my grippers

480
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Okay

481
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
I want that as a tramp stamp on my model

482
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
Hmm

483
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:01,200
I wonder what mic she uses raya because her stuff is so clear. I know it is for the gifted boy

484
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,360
Who that boy who him is I'm not saying okay, tyler go off

485
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,840
No, I'm too pasty to see that song

486
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,800
Are you enjoying it Zara? I just heard her giggle

487
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
That's the

488
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,560
Imagine this in 3d. Oh, that would be so good. I'll be pissing myself same

489
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,880
I even know how 3d concerts work

490
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Oh

491
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,000

He didn't say their knowledge. Come on lads. Come on refland's pill or break one

493
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,520
No, do the word go on refland's go on

494
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
There's this company and that helped

495
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,360
Utano Pandora to do her 3d concert. Um, and it's an upcoming company and I was like

496
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,960
Oh my god insider knowledge too. I met Utano Pandora before she debuted and before I debuted

497
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,200
That's so cool. Yeah, it's so cool. I mean she doesn't know that

498
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,440
She doesn't know that we met before but I know that we met before

499
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,080
Oh my god

500
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,720
She was so nice to me. I was um, she's so lovely, but I don't like interact with her anymore because she doesn't know who I am

501

Achieve those goals, uh, you're only holding yourself back

508
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,080

Oh

520
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:23,200
I didn't realize how reactive uh mimosas ears are yeah, they are they're all well rid

521
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,040
And her boobs too, I know I can't stop staring everyone's boobs

522
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,600
I

523
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,120
Don't sit in comparison there. I have like really bad eyes though. So sometimes mimosas arms look like a part of her hair

524
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,600
Yeah, little nuggie

525
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,520
Her arms are very thin so they tend to kind of disappear into her hair for sure

526
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
She's she's our little nugget

527
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,240
My little nugget now I want chicken nuggets

528
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:04,400
Oh my god, I had really good chicken nuggets yesterday. I know this is completely off topic. It's fucking delicious. I was like

529
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,240
I have bad eyes. It's not an excuse to stare boobs. Let me alone

530
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,400
Oh get it get it get it get it. This is so hate

531
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,480

Nothing wrong with wanting some strawberry milk get out of here

536
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,960
My

537
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:28,640
Question is are they doing a five-man song at the end? I bet I've hoped that you yeah

538
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I wonder if they'll do like an original song

539
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
Yeah, that would be crazy

540
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,760
Some people do an original song. Yeah, why did we learn not do an original song?

541
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,240
Oh, I brought this stressful and I was trying to debut last thing I want to do is give them a custom song that like

542
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,800
To try and do but if you guys want a group we should all have an original we should have an a group song

543
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Okay, I'll do the male part of the song

544
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,040
I'll do the rap part of the song

545
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
I'll do the backup vocals

546
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,200
That leaves us her mercy and I see

00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,600
Perfect. We're good. Yeah, they can carry us through the through the actual vocals

550
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,920

553
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
I know I want to ask the girls after

554
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,040
I

555
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,520
Want to eat the strawberries on her head. I want to eat her

556
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,840
Same. Well, look at the little saucy wink. She ended on she was like

557
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,040
She knows what she's doing. She knows it not to not to make you guys jealous, but

558
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,160
Please five man five man song come on

559
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,680
Mm-hmm

560
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,560
Moving on I know I just got scared. I'm like what's happening

561
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Oh, I feel that

562
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Oh

563
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,760
My god, I mean

564
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,280

565
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,240
Oh

566
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
What song is this

567
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,200
Original question. Is this a k-pop song? Is it capable? Yeah

568
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,080
What song is this I'm wondering

569
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,240
It makes sense that they picked like a yeah, that's true because they all have like girl singers different parts

570
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,800
It's a twice song. It is a twice song

571
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,160
I feel like I would recognize it if it was a twice song, but I guess I'm a fake twice fan

572
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,880
I

573
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,000

576
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,080
It's cda apparently. Okay, that makes more sense

577
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,480
Oh, it's kda. It's kda. Yeah. I had to somebody say it was twice. Why are you lying?

578

580
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,320

581
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,240
Allowing to she's gonna be saying all the words

582
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,200
We'll listen to a zero singing too. Yeah

583
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,200
She's probably harmonizing with them

584
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
Mm-hmm

585
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,560
Oh, she's not singing sing for me for me is there a sing
