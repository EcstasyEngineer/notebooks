1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey, you! You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Hello! Oh my goodness! Hello, hello, hello, welcome! Did you enjoy Mercy's dream? It's

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,360
nice to see you're still in one piece after Mercy, because, you know, after you're done

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,560
with me, there won't be anything left of you big brother. I'm just kidding. So in order

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,040
to introduce myself to you, I wanted to do a house tour. I cleaned up just before this,

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
okay? So I can promise you, you won't find anything sus in there. Okay, here we are,

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
totally not in Minecraft. This is real life. Don't be scared. You can hold my hand. I know

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,200
it's dark. It's a little scary. Oh my god! What is this? Is this a wanted poster for me?

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,600
And it's so close to my cabin too. What the heck? Okay, well, you know, I guess I can use this to

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,600
probably introduce myself to you. So, obviously, my name is Amy Beezoo. So my parents named me Amy

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,480
after the Japanese word for Imoto, which means sister. And Beezoo is the French word for kiss.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,400
What a strange name they chose. Oh, by the way, ignore the crimes part. Okay, that's made up,

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,360
okay? So my hey, I'm 140 centimeters tall, but like I said before, I'm still growing, okay?

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,400
I'll be as tall as Azura one day. Just you wait. And then my birthday is April 10th. I hope you'll

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,120
be able to make it to my birthday party when the time comes. Otherwise, I might have to drag you

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,400
there myself. And my age is unknown. Yep, I've officially beaten the 800-year-old Lollie allegations

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,880
because I have no age. My language is okay. Obviously, you can tell that I'm fluent in English,

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,160
but I also speak a little bit of French. Let me show you my French.

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,400
Sacré bleu. Baguette. Are you going to finish that croissant? I'm kidding. Okay, obviously,

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,360
I'm kidding. Bonjour. Merci pour venir à mon débit. Je sais que mon accent ne pas bien, okay? Je ne

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,760
veux pas voir dans le chat que mon accent est terrible. Merci beaucoup. Je sais que les Québécois

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,080
ont commencé à déjà taper que je devrais sauter d'un pont parce que mon français fait saigner

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,680
à l'air. That's it again. Okay, moving on. Let's make our way to my house now.

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,840
So, this first room here is my hobby room. I got a lot of hobbies. Yep, I consider myself to be

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,440
a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none, except for baiting. Let me bring your attention here

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,080
to this desk. So, this is our whiteboard where I've written down our twitter.com tags. My Oshi

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,320
mark is a pumpkin and a band-aid. Surprise. My general, my general hashtag is a hashtag

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:57,760
Uwo, Uwo, Uwo, Imi, and all capital. Don't forget it. Thank you. Our meme hashtag is Beezoo. Our

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,320
art hashtag is Drot Imi. Our NSFW hashtag is Kimochimi. If you know Japanese, it's like, you know,

30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,880
feeling good, Imi. Okay, our fan name is Pin Pals. I stole that from online. Credit to the person

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,280
who suggested Pin Pals online. And over here is my writing station. Yeah, I'm a writer. That's

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,680
right. I'm a woman of many talents. I like to write a little, a few of my ASMR scripts, and I also

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,520
just like to write for my own enjoyment. Yeah. Why don't we take a look at what I'm currently working

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:38,880
on here? Oh my god. I didn't know that was there. That wasn't supposed to be there. Okay, pretend

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,080
you never saw that. Moving on. So I'm an artist. Here's my little art station. Here's the drawing

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,400
I made. I actually designed the, the Pin Pals myself. So this is, this is the Pin Pals. Oh,

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
so cute. Don't mind me gassing myself up. Okay, let me, let me show you my art skills. You're

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,440
going to have to try to guess what I'm drawing. Okay, here I go. Guess what I'm drawing.

39
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Oh, what could it be? What could it be? Did you guess? That's right. It's a dog.

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Guys, you have such a dirty mind. I would, I would never draw that during debut. Oh my goodness.

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Let's move on to this, this next room up here. I have my rat room.

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,600
That's right. I got four rats. I know it's hard to tell, but we are in Minecraft right now.

43
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,520
So you will see them for real in real life during my hand cam streams. Okay, so right across this

44
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,880
beam here, I have my bedroom. Ignore the blood on the floor. I mean, the red paint on the floor.

45
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,240
And over here's my little desk with my pewter. Yes. I'm here. I have my steam library open. I

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,560
know some of you might feel a little scared right now looking at these games. Valorant,

47
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,000
like legends. She's a loser version. What the fuck? I'm not a gamer. Okay. Your sister is not a gamer.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,440
I will be playing that many games, but these are the games that I want to try eventually.

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,040
Will I even get to all of them? I don't even know. So here on this blackboard, I have my goals.

50
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,960
Yep, I've written down my goals. And the most important goal is to, to not give up.

51
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,680
I'm a very fragile soul. Okay. If you leave one hate comment, I'm leaving. I'm ending stream.

52
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Next, I want to experiment with lots of different types of content. So a lot of ASMR tropes. I want

53
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,600
to try clip compilations. I want to try making memes. I even want to try singing. Oh, fuck.

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,400
Okay, moving on. I want to do a 3D debut. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm really excited for a 3D debut.

55
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,280
I want to touch the other viola girls in 3D. I want to sniff their booties. I want to grope them,

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,040
you know, basically everything you've ever wanted to do to them. I'll be able to do for you. Maybe

57
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,240
VR. Fourth is I want to make you happy. My ultimate goal is to entertain you, to make you laugh,

58
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,480
and to suck and fuck you. Okay, we're done here in my room. Let me, let me go down here. This is

59
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,880
my living room. This is where I do all my jorgen. Over here is my, my TV with a Netflix open. My

60
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,320
favorite shows. I really, really like kids cartoons, like old kids cartoons. I rewatch like all those

61
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,880
shows back to back constantly. So my favorite anime is a freerun, dungeon meshi, psyche is a huge

62
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,240
comfort anime of mine. Watamote. The main character is literally me. I really like houseman castle

63
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,400
and maiden abyss. Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry. Would you look at that? My, my coffee table is

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,680
such a mess. Oh, oh, it looks like the rats must have been messing with my stuff because apparently

65
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,240
they ripped up my diary. How rude of them. Well, I guess I can open up to you a little bit and show

66
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,040
you my thoughts, my feelings. Oh, I wrote my first impressions here. Okay. So for Mercy, she's very

67
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,960
social. She knows a lot of people like holy crap. And she's also very sweet. And her laugh is insane.

68
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,000
When I first heard her laugh, I was like, God damn. Next is I see she's God's ebius soldier.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,120
And she's also effortlessly cute. Like I heard her yawn once and I was like, God damn. I have to try

70
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,960
to be cute. Okay. All of this cuteness you see in front of you is like practice, but I see it doesn't

71
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,120
even have to try scrawny is super, super caring. And she's also a nonstop gamer. And yeah, I don't

72
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
know how she plays games for so long. Like it couldn't be me. I'm jealous. I want to sit down and

73
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,600
play for that long, but I can't. Next is she be she'd be super funny. She's very hyper. You might

74
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,240
not notice that she's hyper during her debut. But once you get to know her more, yeah, she's also

75
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,880
very good at voice impressions. We were watching a stream together, and she copied the streamer's

76
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,280
voice. And I was so surprised because I couldn't tell if it was she be talking or the streamer.

77
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,920
And finally, we have a zero zero super, super chill. She's also good. A lot of games, all the

78
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,320
like community games we played together. She like when all of them and her voices is just pure sex.

79
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,640
So before we end, let me turn the camera back on to myself and I can show you my model. Yep. So

80
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,080
first I have this, you know, little shy arm pose. You know, when I'm feeling shy. I have these

81
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,760
love eyes, POV. I'm standing above you while you're sleeping. I have a exclamation point.

82
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,960
I have this one. We'll move past that one. That's for different streams, not for YouTube streams.

83
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:39,120
I can cry. I can be stupid. I mean, I'm always stupid, but I can look stupid. I can drool at.

84
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,800
I bet you want to lick that off my mouth, don't you? I can blush. I can be angry. You know,

85
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:54,480
I'll get on my bad side. I'll punish you. I can be scared and double scared and also sweaty.

86
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
I bet you want to lick my sweat too, huh? I've been reading your comments. I know. I can sleep.

87
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,880
I can take off my jacket. There it is. And you know what else I can take off? Oh, it's my shoes.

88
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,600
I can take my shoes off and I can stomp on you.

89
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,360
Oh, I think I missed one toggle. There we go. I can cast spells. Shadow Wizard Money Gang.

90
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:45,360
We please come along with me to a cliff under a tree.
