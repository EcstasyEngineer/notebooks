00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,020
You

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
You

4
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
Hi.

5
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Hello.

6
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Hi.

7
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,020
Okay.

8
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,020
Hi.

9
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,020
Hi.

10
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,020
Hi.

11
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,020
Hi.

12
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Hi.

13
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,020
Hi.

14
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Hi.

15
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Hi.

16
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Hi.

17
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,020
Hi.

18
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
Hi.

19
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Hi. Yeah, you can't see me just yet. I know, uh, I know I'm invisible. Hi.

20
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:47,900
I'm so tired. I have not found my marbles just yet, but I forgot to change to

21
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,980
my headphones. I always forget to do that. It always plays on my speakers. Thank you

22
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:03,580
for the $2, um, super chat. Thank you. Yes. Yes, I've been working all day long

23
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:16,900
today. I've been working all day today. I worked all day yesterday and, um, I worked

24
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:30,300
half of the day the day before. So, today, while there's still some kinks that I need

25
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:38,500
to work out as I'm now just seeing, I wanted to show you basically the end

26
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:47,860
results basically of all my hard work. And I'll go more into it after I show you. Thank

27
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:57,260
you for becoming a member. Thank you. I love you too. Okay. Um, yeah, there's still some

28
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:04,100
small things I need to fix, but the end result will basically look the same from far away,

29
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,740
like to you. So, oh my God, I'm so excited. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not

30
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:18,900
fucking ready. Okay. Ready? No, you're not, but I'll show you anyways. Okay. We'll do

31
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:28,780
a whole reveal. Oh, oh, there's a top in my head. Maybe I should here. I'll go down here.

32
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,940
All right. The top of my head is bumpy as usual. I didn't change that. I still got my

33
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,900
headphone dent up there, but as we go a little bit, oh, I'm so fucking big. What the fuck?

34
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:51,980
Okay. As we go a little bit higher, wait a minute. Is it me? Oh, is it me? Is it me Ginger?

35
00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:07,260
Wait a minute. She's Ginger. I'm actually Ginger now. I've embraced the Ginger and I actually

36
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:17,500
have freckles now. Not only have I embraced the Ginger, I gave myself more freckles, so they're

37
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:26,780
more obvious. Yeah. And then, and then there's more. Just wait, there's more. Are you ready?

38
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,420
So, I was told that not only my Ginger, but the bottom of my hair is supposed to resemble

39
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:47,820
pumpkins. And personally, I just never really saw it. So thank you for the $199 super chat.

40
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:57,900
So I never really saw pumpkins in my hair. So what I decided to do was make it more obvious.

41
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:08,140
I gave myself more obviously pumpkin hair. And I changed the jacket and the necklace.

42
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,020
You see it? I changed it. I simplified the necklace. This is all just kind of, well, not all,

43
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:25,820
but this is mostly to like my own preferences. But yeah, I changed the, I need lip balm. Thank

44
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:41,980
you for becoming a member. Crack racing. Hold on. Okay. Yeah, I changed the jacket. I wanted

45
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:49,340
something a little more, I guess something that fits the color scheme better. So yeah.

46
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:58,220
Um, are you gay? Why are you acting so gay? Mr. Sister Kisser Disco tip $6 and 90 cents.

47
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,780
I say this new model has soul but ginger. Mr. Sister Kisser.

48
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:15,020
That's so funny. That's so funny. Right. Yeah. Here's the jacket. This is how I changed it. It's

49
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:22,140
a little bit different than the original, obviously. And then I also changed the, it's

50
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:29,980
harder to tell. It don't, okay. The mesh on my body is a little different too. Like my mesh shirt.

51
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,620
Don't look too closely at it. That's one of the things I need to fix for sure. And don't

52
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,380
look too closely at my freckles either. But the mesh on my body is a little bit fucked.

53
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,020
Don't worry about it. I'll fix it when I have time. But yeah, I changed the mesh shirt a little

54
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:57,980
bit so it goes all the way up to my choker. And then I changed my thong. So the original thong felt

55
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:05,420
a little too thick. It kind of looked like um, it kind of looked like leather straps. And that's

56
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:13,740
painful to have against my Gucci. So I finned it out so it, you know, it looks more like a thong.

57
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:25,980
And I also changed the belt too. I just simplified that. And oh shit, look at that. The book is also

58
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,940
different. The book is a little bit, the book actually looks like it got, you know, mangled.

59
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,940
Okay. Where are you?

60
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,060
You're so gay.

61
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,180
Um, yeah, sure. Let me just show you the last thing that I changed. So I changed the color of the

62
00:09:51,180 --> 00:10:01,260
shoes a little bit. And then I changed the knife. Yes. Let me see if I can pull up the other model.

63
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,460
I'm not sure. Maybe I can open a second VTube Studio.

64
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:18,780
Maybe I can't do that. Okay, wait, let me try something else. Let me try one more thing.

65
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:27,900
I'm not, I really, I'm not, like, I don't know much about VTube Studio and I'm not really good at

66
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:42,380
rigging. So I don't, I don't always know what I'm doing. I think this is the one I need.

67
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,180
I'm trying to bring up the old model too. Hold on.

68
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:59,660
Streaming assets items. And I put it in there. Maybe. Let's see if that worked.

69
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,900
Do I have to restart VTube Studio?

70
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,140
And we have to restart it. Oh, no, there it is.

71
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:25,900
I don't know if this is going to work. Uh-oh. Oh, there she is. Now there's two of me.

72
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:36,940
Right. There's two of us now. You can't escape. Okay, here they are side by side. I think I made

73
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,500
this one a little taller. There we go. So here they are side by side. Are you gay? Why are you acting

74
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,500
so gay? Oh, thank you for the, oh, I can't read that. Hold on, let me open the tab to read.

75
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,820
Email limits. Twins!

76
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,260
Um, hi little email till Big Bro's curious how much of Big Bro's samples would it take to

77
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:16,220
make your tramp stamp light up? Oh my god. I don't know. I don't know. Why don't we experiment

78
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,540
together and see how many it takes? Okay, yeah. So here it is side by side if you want to take a

79
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:35,020
screenshot. Um, I also slightly changed the, um, uh, can't think of the word. The shorts. The color

80
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:42,220
of the shorts is a little bit different too. Um, it's not a tramp stamp. Yeah, right. It's a

81
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:49,740
womb tattoo. It's not a tramp stamp. Get it right. Get it right. Um, the thong, some of the moments

82
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:57,660
are a little awkward, especially at the thong. Well, like I said, I'll fix it. I'll fix it slowly.

83
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,260
When I have time, because this was a little bit rushed, I really wanted to get it done.

84
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:11,820
You're shorter? Oh, that's, that's just me. There, now I'm taller. That's just the program.

85
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm not actually any shorter. Okay, don't, don't try to, don't pretend I'm shorter. Okay, we're,

86
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:25,180
we're the same height. We're the same fucking height. Anyways, I'm going to throw old Jimmy away.

87
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,860
Bye-bye. Because I have something else to show you and it's even more exciting.

88
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:39,420
It's even more exciting. You're not ready for this one. This one's way crazier. Okay, ready?

89
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,180
Hold on. Let me, let me go change. Let me go change. Hold on.

90
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,300
Okay. I changed.

91
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:57,580
Oh, what's that? Oh, it's the Lord dress. Oh, I'm so tiny now.

92
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,020
It's the dress from the Lord video. Yeah.

93
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:15,580
This one, I also did myself. It's not very, like, it's not very wavy. Maybe I could,

94
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:22,780
maybe I could fix that too when I try to fix these. But, um, can I have the old Emmy?

95
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,740
No. Why are you acting so gay? What do you mean the old Emmy?

96
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,340
This Emmy will, it looks so much cuter. Look how cute it is. I really like it.

97
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,820
Can I have the old Emmy level? I think it might be illegal to have such a cute sister.

98
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,180
I kept the socks on. Even though in the Lord video, um,

99
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,540
even though in the Lord video, thank you for all the tips. I'm sorry. I'm trying to,

100
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,140
I'm trying to catch my train of thought. Thank you for the $5 super chat and the, the 420.

101
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,900
The style of your tattoo is called a badge badge. Okay.

102
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:07,980
Okay. Thank you for your 422. Mr. Kisser. Mr. Kiss. That. Mr. Sister Kisser.

103
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:16,860
Okay. Um, I forgot what I was going to say. I, I didn't have socks in the Lord video,

104
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,300
but I decided to keep the socks because I thought they looked like way cuter.

105
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,260
I thought the dress looked way cuter with the socks, you know?

106
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,900
So yeah. And I can, it's a little bouncy too.

107
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,100
I think I want to up the physics for, um, the dress a little bit. No,

108
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,900
because this is actually the first time I'm, uh, this is the first time I, I, I try it,

109
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,420
like I test it. Um, I'm here testing it with you. This is the first time I test everything.

110
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:56,380
I haven't tested it at all because I haven't been able to, um, export it into V2 studio.

111
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,340
Why are you acting so gay? Another sister kisser, tip $25. Hardworking little

112
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,380
sister deserves a small treat. The changes look amazing. The Lord dress is so cute.

113
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,620
You did such a great job. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There's another sister

114
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,060
kisser. There's two sister kissers.

115
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,220
Thank you. Do you think tooth is adorable? It's always been adorable,

116
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,220
but now it's even cuter because it's probably a cute dress. Um,

117
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,980
someone get her some chalky milk. I don't like chalky milk, but you know what? I do have

118
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:46,300
some gamer subs. Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

119
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,140
Thank you for the two dollars. Um, it kind of looks like, oh wait, that's not it. Your model

120
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,620
looks fantastic. I know you worked hard, so you shall be rewarded with lots of kisses.

121
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,740
Thank you for the two dollars. Um, kind of looks like a cute Halloween themed dress.

122
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:10,300
Does it look Halloween themed? The only thing that's Halloween themed is the socks,

123
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:19,500
which has, have some, um, have some, uh, catch up on them. They just have some catch up on them.

124
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,140
Why are you acting so gay? Rollo legend underscore 99 tipped five dollars.

125
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,460
You look so adorable. I love the dress. Can't wait to clap you less than three.

126
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,860
I guess you have easy access now.

127
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:43,020
Anyways, I finally got the, the, actually, no, I'll, I'll keep talking between,

128
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:49,100
I finally got the gamer, um, subs package and I know this kind of sounds like I'm chilling,

129
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,100
but I've always wanted to try, um, I've always wanted to try like these gamer juices,

130
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
but I, I could never buy them because they're kind of expensive for me,

131
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,740
especially if you're Canadian. Sorry, I'm not addressing my mic. If you're Canadian, they're

132
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:10,220
like, um, quite expensive, but that's just kind of everything for Canada, to be honest. Um,

133
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:19,100
American products are, uh, but the gamer subs animation. American products are often

134
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:29,100
like really overpriced for us, us poor Canadians. Um, I don't know if I have it.

135
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:41,340
Where is it? Is it here? Is it this? Yeah, there it is. We got a code. I'll make it small.

136
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:50,140
Like, there. But I just, I, like, this isn't even, like, you don't, don't even,

137
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,380
you don't, don't, don't worry about buying it. I genuinely just want to try it. Um,

138
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,740
I have all, I have low hole blast and then I have lean and then I also have, um,

139
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:13,180
Guacamole Gamer Farts 9000. Um, do you have any recommendations for anyone who's tried these

140
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:22,060
before? Why are you acting so gay? Blue Razz is my personal, I don't have Blue Razz,

141
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,620
I only have those three. Those were the ones that were sent to me. I want to spin you around

142
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,220
and dance to our favorite song with you in that dress. Aww. Should Big Bro get a tux or does

143
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,380
emo to like it when we dress like we're homeless? Like in the Lord? No, if you want to, if you want

144
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:45,340
to dance around, you should get a tux. Of course. You can't always dress like you're homeless.

145
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:54,700
You like lean or gamer fart? I'm seeing lots of lean or gamer fart. Which one do you prefer?

146
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:02,140
Which one do you think I'd like more? I like sweet things. Lean is the best? Gamer Farts? Gamer Farts?

147
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,380
Oh yeah, I forgot. Um, someone said we're so close to 20k. I forgot. Um,

148
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:22,300
thank you for 8k. 8k. Thank you for 18k. Thank you. That's, um, that's, that's, I didn't,

149
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,500
I'm not expecting to get, I don't know, every time we go up another K, I'm like, what the fuck?

150
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:36,940
I'm not expecting it. Yeah, we're at 18k already. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

151
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:47,260
you so much. Um, I'm going to try lean because I think that's funny. Isn't lean the name of, um,

152
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:58,940
of a drug? 18.1? Yeah, 20k when? I don't, I don't know. I'm really, apparently I'm really bad at,

153
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:07,980
you know, um, guessing, like, I don't know. I'm like, I'm really surprised every time we keep,

154
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,980
you know, getting subscribers. It's probably mostly from that clip of my boobs, but I'm,

155
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,500
at least I'm glad that you guys like my boobs. It's not opening. Okay, there you go.

156
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,500
I got a taste of it when I opened with, I opened it with my mouth. Um,

157
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:35,020
so I have, oh, I got, oh, I got pure taste of it in my mouth. Okay, I got, um,

158
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:43,740
I got the cup itself and I think, um, I don't quite remember. I think, um,

159
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,180
I think I said three of the, of the spoon, of the spoons, the little spoon it comes

160
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,340
and into the cup, right? I might have to put a little less than three just because,

161
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,500
um, I didn't fill the cup up all the way. They add a grape drink to it.

162
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,580
It's one spoon for 250 milliliters. Yeah, that, uh, I don't know milliliters.

163
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,900
I don't, I don't know. I don't know how much I poured into my,

164
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:22,860
I have no clue how much I poured into my drink. There, I put one spoon. Did you eat, I'm like,

165
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,740
I did eat today. Yeah. One spoon for every eight Oz. I don't know Oz either.

166
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:35,260
I'll put two and then I'll see how it tastes and then if it's not enough, I'll put one more.

167
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:46,380
There. Okay, let me shake it around a bit. This is so cool. I don't know. I've had friends that

168
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,060
like, we're super excited about the waifu cups and stuff and I, I was always like,

169
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:00,780
confused what the hype was about. I guess I never understood it, but this is kind of cool. I'm

170
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:09,580
not gonna lie. Oh my God, it's pink. Yippee. 250 milliliters is about 8.4 ounces. Oh, thank you.

171
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,900
Yeah, we, they gave us a waifu cup. I don't, I don't know if this one has a name. Um,

172
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:26,700
but she has really big boobs and she's like punching the, she's punch, uh, she's like punching the cup.

173
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Uh-uh.

174
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,660
Lena's purple. Oh shoot. Hold on. I'm like spilling it everywhere.

175
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,900
Okay, I think I mixed it good enough. Hopefully. I'm gonna use a straw.

176
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,220
All right, moment of truth.

177
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,900
Okay, two, I think was definitely enough for how much I put.

178
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,460
It, it, it's like, because it said it was grape, I was expecting it to taste like,

179
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:19,180
like great grape. Tell us the flavor. It's lean. The one that says lean on it. Lean.

180
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,980
Because you said it was grape flavored, I was expecting it to taste like great, but it, it,

181
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,660
like grape candy, but it doesn't taste like grape candy. It just tastes like real grapes. I was

182
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:40,540
surprised. Like it actually just tastes like, like, like, like a, it has, it has like the real

183
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,540
grape taste. I don't know, I was surprised. This sounds like I'm shilling it. Real grape flavor. I

184
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:52,860
don't know. I was, I was expecting like grape candy flavor, you know? Yeah, like actual grape

185
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,860
instead of candy flavored grape. I mean, I like both. I like both actual grape and candy flavored

186
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,940
grape, but that's interesting because I've never had a grape flavor drink that doesn't taste like

187
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:18,780
candy grape. Okay, I'll just be sipping on that while we talk. Hold on a second. Okay.

188
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:29,820
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay? May I please have an indirect sip?

189
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,740
An indirect kiss. You want some? Here.

190
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,980
Let me spit it up on you.

191
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,540
There's your taste.

192
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,060
Right. Um,

193
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:59,260
I'm just so happy that I was able to, to, to, to get it like, to use this model.

194
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:08,540
I'm so happy. I'm so happy. It was a lot of work just to rig it in the first place,

195
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:15,420
because like I said before, like, like the person who rigged this model definitely knows

196
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:23,340
a lot more about live 2D and making models than I do. So when I like opened the model, I was like,

197
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:35,260
oh, I had what the fuck is going on here. I was very confused. And so it took me a while to like

198
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,100
go through it and figure out what they did. I still don't know what they did for some stuff.

199
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:47,980
I'm still like, what the fuck is this supposed to do? I don't know. But it's good practice.

200
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:57,820
I guess it is. I don't know. I, I'm not someone that like, wants a career in rigging. So like,

201
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,620
every time I have to practice, I'm like, or not that I practice, but every time I do. Oh,

202
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,380
thank you for raiding, Strawny. Hello, didn't you do a karaoke? You had your bathtub stream

203
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:15,020
today too. That's so fun. Reefling raid. Hello. Hi, Reeflings.

204
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,820
I'm really impressed how well you did rigging and designing, especially in such a short amount of

205
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,100
time. You're so talented. Oh, thank you. Thank you. That's so sweet of you.

206
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:41,180
Um, Strawny's probably tired. She, she probably streamed a lot, huh? And she's saying too, singing

207
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:57,180
is tiring, especially for me. Singing is so tiring. Um, what are you wearing? A new dress.

208
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:08,460
A new hair. And, um, I had a lot of trouble like the physics. You see how like the leaves on the hair

209
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:19,660
move, you know, and, um, I, uh, this is such small, tiny details, but I wanted to show you because

210
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:26,780
I put effort into it. So, um, what I did was I separated some of the layers a little more.

211
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:32,700
So that way when I turn, you can kind of like see a little more shadow in the dress, you know?

212
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:40,380
Um, it's a little messy, but you know what? It's okay. And then not only that, but also in my hair,

213
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:49,340
um, I like made the hair turn, uh, it's kind of hard to tell. But in the bun, I made the hair, um,

214
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:57,740
I don't know. I made the hair turn more 3D. I don't know how obvious it is, but like you can see on

215
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:05,580
the sides when I turn, you know, the sides disappear a little more. I don't know. I don't know if you

216
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:12,220
can tell. It's a very small detail, but it's, you know, it's, it's a technique that I've been

217
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:21,660
wanting to try. And I think it looks really good. So, yeah. But I ran into a problem.

218
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:30,060
Thank you for the $2 super chat. Adorable. Thank you. I ran into a problem where at first,

219
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:36,780
I didn't know what the problem was. And, um, I had finished all my changes and I couldn't,

220
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:47,580
I couldn't export it and literally like fucking like half of, I spent all of yesterday working on

221
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:57,500
this and I, uh, half of yesterday, I got into a call with like another Vtuber friend and I feel

222
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,460
so bad for her because like she was talking to me and I was trying to pay attention so hard.

223
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:11,260
But at the same time, I was like internally raging because I was, I wasn't able to export

224
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,420
this and I kept raging at the freaking program. I feel so bad for her. She was probably annoyed.

225
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,340
But yeah, I spent like hours and hours yesterday just like sitting with the program opening,

226
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:29,980
like watching it not do anything. But the loading, the loading bar was there. So I was like,

227
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,980
maybe it's doing something. Maybe it's working. Maybe it's doing something. And I would just

228
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:42,060
sit there for hours and hours and it wasn't doing anything. And then finally, uh, finally today,

229
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,300
um,

230
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,500
hold on.

231
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:03,820
Finally today, I was like, okay, let me reach out for help. So I, I got over my shyness and

232
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:10,700
I, I usually don't like doing this, but I got over my shyness and I reached out to like

233
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,860
people who actually know what they're doing, um, making lies and I asked them for help and they

234
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:25,180
helped me and they helped me. And so I was able to finally export it. And the problem was that the

235
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:34,620
file was just too big. And I didn't know that. Well, I know that like they did make the model maker

236
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:42,380
made my file very, very, um, heavy on the computer and very large. I knew that, but I didn't know

237
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,700
it would actually cause problems, which is stupid of me to not assume that. But yeah, it caused

238
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:54,700
problems. So I had to, I did something. I don't know. I did a lot. It was time comes time, time

239
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:04,860
consuming, but I, I minimized it and now here I am and all of my cuteness. I'm so happy. I even

240
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,220
like this is something I never do with shoes. I like made the shoes turn a little bit and go up

241
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,300
and down. I don't know. It's such a tiny detail. It's not that big of a deal, but it's a big deal

242
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,660
for me as a rigging new bits of big deal for me.

243
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,900
Machine not beefy enough to survive the parts. It's not even my computer that was struggling

244
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:34,460
to export it because of the size. It was the literal live 2D program that was struggling

245
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:40,860
to export it because of the size. If that makes sense. Oh, thank you for the 10 gifted Silent

246
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:48,780
Night. Thank you for so much. That's so nice of you. Everybody thank, thank, whoever got a

247
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:54,860
gifted sub make sure you thank them. Um, I'm so proud of you. I'm just happy.

248
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,340
Cause I've been, um, I've been stressing over this. Like you have no fucking clue. I was like,

249
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:10,140
I tweeted out, I lose, um, I tweeted out that I was losing my marbles, um,

250
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,980
on Twitter and people were like, Oh no, what's wrong? And I thought people would assume that

251
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,900
it's, you know, it's the rigging, but some people didn't assume it. So they're like,

252
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,940
what's wrong? And it's like, I'm losing my fucking marbles over this model. That's what's wrong.

253
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:39,500
We're so proud of you for reaching out and getting it done. Thank you. I'm proud of myself too.

254
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,260
But, um, yes, of course the model got exported after all because I'm using it right now.

255
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm using it. Of course the God exported it. You can kind of tell. Oh my God. I'm like seeing

256
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,780
all my mistakes now and I'm like, Oh, I don't like the mistakes.

257
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,860
And also here, I have something funny to show you.

258
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,700
So remember how I could take off my, um, my shoes before?

259
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:29,580
Well, so yeah, I could take off my shoes before, right? Now with this dress,

260
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,220
I am, you love the new model. It made me think of something. If you could make a sort of

261
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,860
concept art of how you imagine the standard big bro looks like, what would you imagine?

262
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:49,980
I don't think there's a standard big bro. I'm sure all of you are very different.

263
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,540
You kind of just got the hentai protagonist look in the, in the, um,

264
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:06,380
what's it called? In the lore video. Oh, thank you for the $4.27. That dress looks good on you.

265
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,220
It would look better on the floor. I worked hard to put it on. Don't take it off just yet.

266
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:19,340
Anyways, so my, my feet were actually really big and they were so big that I couldn't,

267
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:30,700
I couldn't fit them in my shoes. So, um, what I did instead was that I actually just cut them off.

268
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:39,820
I cut off my feet. So now my shoe toggle doesn't work anymore.

269
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:50,460
My shoe toggle doesn't work anymore because I cut my feet off so that they would fit into these shoes.

270
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,540
Sorry.

271
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,700
The nugget lore is real. I'm slowly turning into a nugget.

272
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,780
I'm very slowly turning into a nugget. Oh my God, it's real.

273
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,500
It's real. We're getting closer and closer every day to becoming a nugget.

274
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,820
I was just lazy and I was struggling so much with the feet. So I just, I just cut them off.

275
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:31,580
Yeah, now you got free armpits to sniff too. Think about all the places you can,

276
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,020
all the fun places you can shove those stumps now. What?

277
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,780
Effort towards the two models was worth it though. They look so good already.

278
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:52,460
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I, the reason I made this one, um, was because we had to push back the 2.0

279
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,140
to a year from now and I was like, why are you acting so gay?

280
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,220
Huh? Great job with the model. Big bro's very happy to see your hard work paying off.

281
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,940
Thank you. Thank you for your work. Are you gay? $50? Oh, I didn't see that. Thank you for the $50.

282
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:15,900
Link 3.22 tipped $50. Great job with the model, Emmy. Big bro is very happy to see your hard work

283
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,740
paying off. I'm having trouble keeping up with all the doughnuts.

284
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,260
I'm having trouble keeping up with all the doughnuts. Thank you for the $50 and also,

285
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,780
okay, the dress can stay on. Good. Right now at least.

286
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:38,300
Um, yeah, right. Um, so I was like, let me, let me do something at least.

287
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:46,300
If I have to wait a year, let me do something. So I did this and I think it's so, wait a minute.

288
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:55,260
Okay, no, I think that's just my monitor fucking up. Um, I think he's so cute. I'm very,

289
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,220
very happy that the model artist actually gave me a body underneath my clothes because otherwise I

290
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,100
wouldn't be able to do this. When I drop my models, I don't give them naked bodies underneath their

291
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:13,100
clothes because I'm really lazy. So, um, I'm happy that this one did. And I have a body underneath

292
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:19,660
here. Sheepies here? Wait, I didn't even see. Sorry. I have, I've been napping. How can my little

293
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:24,140
sister be so cute? I'm going to cry. Thank you, Sheepie. Thank you.

294
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,820
What's that thing where you have? What? What's the thing you have where small child is

295
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:44,300
lashed to your chest? What does that mean? What? I hear a lot of model artists put something under

296
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,740
clothes to make new outfits easier. Why are you acting so gay? Um, yeah, they do. They do. A lot

297
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,860
of model artists, well not all of them, but some of them will draw like the full body

298
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:04,940
underneath because it does make, it does make, um, new outfits easier. I just don't because I'm lazy

299
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:13,180
and that's extra work. I love the brush up. I'm going to lose it. Thank you. Thank you,

300
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:19,020
Sheepie. You're too nice. You better hold her close and cherish my little sis. Thank you.

301
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,900
You better hold me close too. You better cherish me too, Sheepie.

302
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,860
What else was I saying? I don't even remember.

303
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:47,900
I'm rushing in between my boobs. Please do. I'll motorboat them. I'll go

304
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:01,580
You have no idea how, like literally I've taken like no breaks. Streaming was my break between

305
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:09,660
making this. So I'm like, now I'm like, oh, I can relax. I don't have to stress anymore.

306
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:18,780
Ah, I don't have to stress anymore. It's been so stressful. Make sure you take a break,

307
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,660
a good break. I will. I, I did say that we might play, um,

308
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:31,180
I did say we might play poppy playtime, right? I kind of still,

309
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,100
Emmy was radio silent for like two days. Yeah, because I've been working on this.

310
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:40,700
Like I've been stressing over this. Like I've been, like I've been losing my fucking mind.

311
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,260
I've been losing my mind. I've been like crying. I've been yelling.

312
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:54,300
Ha, talented Emmy deserves rest. I'll rest after this. I will.

313
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:02,220
But yeah, I wanted to, I wanted to play some poppy playtime. I really do,

314
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,780
but I know I'm going to be hot and sweaty. Um,

315
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,540
I know I'm going to be hot and sweaty in my room. And if I play poppy playtime,

316
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,460
I'm going to like extend the stream by a lot because I want to finish poppy playtime.

317
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,980
So I probably will not play poppy playtime. You never have to push yourself that hard.

318
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,060
I want to. I wanted to. I wanted to. I did it. We're done now.

319
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:38,380
You have a bit more. Yeah. Okay. I'll just say here. Yeah.

320
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,140
Anonymous tip. $25. The dress is so cute. You did a stellar job.

321
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:49,100
Not to mention the revamped base outfit. Thank you. Thank you for the 25.

322
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,060
Play what makes you happy. We just want you to have fun. I will play what makes me happy.

323
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,620
Poppy playtime makes me happy, but I just, um,

324
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,620
I just don't think I have the energy to play it.

325
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,780
But I don't think I have the energy to play it. That's all.

326
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,340
But we'll play it again next week. Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

327
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,340
Oh, I keep expecting the TTS to talk, to talk it, to talk.

328
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,340
The talk so I don't have to read. Why are you acting so gay?

329
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,100
Raven tipped $6.90. Thank you so much for all your hard work.

330
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,980
Here's a little kiss for your troubles. 40 minutes of Australian French kissing.

331
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,060
Australian? Why Australian?

332
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,340
You sound really drained. Like a way husband lifted off of your shoulders.

333
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:52,140
It has been. It has been. Like, I don't know how, I don't know how else to explain it.

334
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,540
I think I've explained it well enough. Oh, a kiss down under. Oh.

335
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:02,700
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay? I wasn't expecting that.

336
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:12,860
Um, um, why are you, um, thank you, uh, anonymous for the 420 big bro.

337
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,500
So proud of you. All your hard work was worth it.

338
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:23,100
Um, wasn't there another chapter of Andy and Layla? You can play that. No, there wasn't.

339
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:36,220
Was there? Yeah, there isn't another chapter. So, uh, no, I can't play that. Sorry.

340
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,860
I would, if I could, I would have totally, I, I want to, I want to, oh my god.

341
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,100
Thank you for the 20 gifted eternity. Oh,

342
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:57,340
this is, this is, this is, thank you. I don't know what to say.

343
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,060
I'll, I'll turn off that, that thing sound so it's not constantly digging.

344
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,860
Thank you. I'm really brain dead.

345
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:18,620
I missed up $10. Great job on the outfit and rigging yummy. It looks great.

346
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:27,020
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, and thank you, Flutterbox for the five more gift.

347
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:35,340
Thank you. Oh my god. You guys are so nice. It's because I complained.

348
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,100
It's because I complained about this. Now you're trying to make me feel better.

349
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:46,140
It's okay. You don't have to. Yeah, you're trying to spoil me.

350
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:01,500
Um, I really, really want to work on another, if I close this, will it break my rate? No,

351
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,780
I didn't. Okay. Um, I really, really want to work on a new video eventually, but um,

352
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:14,700
she be set in our discord server. Why is my little sister in me so cute?

353
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:25,020
Why is my girl failure dumb? So cute.

354
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:34,700
Oh, thank you. Pop in November for another five gifted. Oh, thank you so much for how the gifted.

355
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:47,740
Oh my god. How are the collabs coming along? So, um, I have not really gotten much progress

356
00:45:47,740 --> 00:46:02,620
done on the collab with, um, Denpa. Unfortunately, I need to more, more. Oh my god. Thank you,

357
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,980
Flutterbox for another 20 gifted. Holy crap.

358
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:17,100
So many gifted today. Thank you. I guess we're gonna have a lot more people at our

359
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,820
membership streams now, aren't we?

360
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:31,980
Finally, a Frenchy Vtuber. I'm not a Frenchy. Oh shit. Thank you, Mr. Abby for five.

361
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:41,100
Why do you guys keep gifting more? Thank you. Basically whisper the 10 gifted.

362
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:47,340
Oh, I think these gifted are only for emails. Oh, you're right. You're right. Sorry.

363
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:53,900
You're right. You have to, um, I think you have to pay like $1 extra to get the actual membership

364
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:05,900
tier, but still thank you. Oh my god. Thank you, Saikai for the 10 gifted. Oh. Slow down,

365
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:16,140
slow down. Slow down. Oh my. Thank you. Thank you, Keek for the 20 gifted and Echo Sound for the

366
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:26,140
five gifted. Oh gosh. I wasn't expecting all of this. I, I didn't want to, yeah, it's Oprah Winfrey

367
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:32,380
kind of stuff. I didn't want to make a big deal out of the model reveal because I didn't want people

368
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:40,860
to like, I think it was some sort of, um, like big event that they don't want to miss out on

369
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:46,700
because it's like, it's not that big of a deal, you know, because I'll be using both of these

370
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:55,820
from now on. Oh, thank you, Gravy Baby for the 10 gifted and thank you for gone myth. It's because

371
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:01,580
you deserve all our money. I can eat ramen for another two months. No. No, no, no, no, no.

372
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:08,300
Don't, don't give me anything if you have to eat ramen for two months. Don't do that.

373
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:16,140
Thank you. Thank you the deathberry for, for 10 more gifted memberships. Oh gosh.

374
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,220
It's a huge deal because you're so talented and it's such amazing work.

375
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,140
Well, is this

376
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:42,940
okay? Thank you for $5 Anonymous. Um, it is a lots of stream. That's what we're doing.

377
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:55,580
Um, it's not that it's a big event. It's because people want to reward you for being such a hard

378
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:04,220
working, talented, cute little sister. Oh, thank you. Don't worry, Emily. There's Domino's regular

379
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:11,980
pizza for like $4 Canadian at my place. I just watched a Domino's crime video not too long ago.

380
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,580
You want to hear about that? What's crazy is that while I was watching the video,

381
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,940
I was eating leftover Domino's, which was funny.

382
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:25,580
Um,

383
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,660
nothing's wrong with ramen. Someone said, what's wrong with ramen though? Nothing's wrong with

384
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:41,580
ramen, but you know, people eat ramen because they don't have enough money for other stuff, right?

385
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,020
It's because you yelled and then you cried. So the pinpals are trying to spoil you for your

386
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,580
hard work. Thank you. Thank you for spoiling me.

387
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,620
Um, why does every stream turn into a true crime story kind of deal? Because I like true

388
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:21,900
crime. So I like telling you the stories. It was just, um, oh yeah, I got a gamers up some

389
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:28,940
noodle too. Do you want to try that together? We can try that together too.

390
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,060
Thank you for the $20 super chat. Why eat food when you can eat in me? Don't eat me.

391
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,860
Don't eat me just because I want to be a nugget doesn't mean you should eat me.

392
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,620
You want to try it together? Yeah, they do make noodles. I didn't know either.

393
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:53,740
I had no clue either. It's just chicken flavor, I think, but I don't know if it has like caffeine

394
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:59,580
in it or anything. I don't even know if these have caffeine in them. No, lean is caffeine free,

395
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:07,900
but maybe the other ones have caffeine. Um, I can't tell.

396
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:21,420
Oh, thank you for the hundred bobs. I don't know what Bob is. First time watching you live,

397
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,020
here's some texts for the cultured audios I listened to on Patreon. Thank you. Ah,

398
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,140
thank you for the texts. That's gross.

399
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:41,020
Um, I guess I can go microwave it real quick. It's pretty quick to make 100 whole bobs.

400
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,780
I'll go microwave it real quick and we can eat it together.

401
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,300
So I'll be back in like two seconds, not two seconds, like two minutes.

402
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:00,860
Okay, B or B, I'll probably pee while it microwaves. I'm gonna turn this off. I don't,

403
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:08,540
I don't really like showing advertisements on my streams that much. It's pissing time! It's pissing

404
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:20,780
time! All right, I'll be back with noodle.

405
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:35,820
Okay, you guys weren't saying anything while I was gone, right?

406
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:45,500
You weren't, sorry, it took me a while. It took me a while. I did not, I did not

407
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:53,660
microwave the cup like it says on the packaging. I know, I know it says not to microwave it.

408
00:59:53,660 --> 01:00:00,060
I did not microwave it. Um, how are the noodles? They're still like, I have the cup here. They're

409
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:09,980
still um, softening. They're still softening. Um, were you fantasizing about the flavor of

410
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:20,300
eminade? Did you wash your hands? Of course I did! Yes, I did. Good girl, thank you. I read the packaging.

411
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:26,540
I was gonna put it in with the packaging. Like, I was gonna put the whole cup in there, but um,

412
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:37,980
I made sure to read it beforehand, and I didn't. What color was it? I didn't look! Do you look at

413
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:46,380
the color of your pee? Do you look at it? Are you like one of those, you missed 10 more subs from

414
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:54,620
our hero? Oh, shit. Um, thank you for the $1 super chat while I was gone, and thank you,

415
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:05,020
Diane, uh, Diane Nysos for the 10 gifted, and thank you for becoming a member. Okay,

416
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:10,540
that, that one good guy. It's kind of a default for guys. You do look at the color of your pee.

417
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:21,340
Oh yeah, you can't really look away. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I kind of just, you know, well,

418
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:30,060
you could sit down. You can sit down. Why don't you sit down? Wait, we're not supposed to put it

419
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:39,260
in the microwave? Oh, not this brand, not the Gamer Soups brand. I like how they said added MSG

420
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:45,580
for delicious taste, because a lot of companies are really afraid of adding MSG, because fucking,

421
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:54,700
um, I don't know what happened. I probably wasn't even fucking born yet when the world was like,

422
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:59,100
oh, MSG causes cancer or something like that. I don't know. I like MSG. I think it tastes good.

423
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:07,020
What if the pee is brown? I guess that's bad. Standing up is our God given right? The flow

424
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:11,580
is better standing. Is that true? I don't, I don't believe you.

425
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:23,100
Aw, thank you. Thank you for the four dollars and 20 cents. Ah, shit. I should have not opened that.

426
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,300
But, um,

427
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:34,460
if, if little Emmy now has pumpkins in her hair, then Big Bro will have lots of fun digging it.

428
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
That's kind of hot.

429
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:50,540
Digging inside you and carving your insides with his tool, with his tool.

430
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,700
Standing just makes you feel powerful. Uh, why do you want to feel powerful though?

431
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:03,980
Let's cringe. You feel powerful when you pee? Hmm? You like being, feeling powerful when you pee?

432
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,620
I mean, I had a heart attack unrelated to MSG after eating food with MSG,

433
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,100
so the salt industry blamed it on MSG. Yeah.

434
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:18,540
Let me smell it. Let me give it a nice snort. It looks so little compared to the amount of noodles

435
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:25,180
in the cup. It does, it does smell good. I usually like a lot of powder.

436
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:35,100
I feel powerful avoiding taxes. Yeah, that's what, that's what gives me power.

437
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,580
Avoiding taxes. Not, not standing while, um, pissing.

438
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,500
Um, if I sit down to pee, my starship trooper keeps touching the inside of the toilet because of the

439
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:54,540
link and I, and I'd rather avoid that. Skillish you. That sounds like a skillishie to me. I don't know, man.

440
01:03:56,140 --> 01:04:01,660
Well, thank you for the 333. Um, Amy, I just saw the thumbnail. Why'd you call me out like that?

441
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:07,420
Wait, wait, why'd I call you out? Gamer soups, it's just soup. It doesn't have any of the, um,

442
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:16,460
it doesn't have any of the, I can't remember, like the, there's no vegetables, which makes it extra

443
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:22,940
gamer. There's no vegetables, which makes it extra gamer. Um,

444
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:30,300
but that's what I like. Like, you know how some come with dehydrated vegetables?

445
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:37,740
I always throw those out. I never use those. I don't like vegetables in my noodles.

446
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:48,540
Okay. Flavor wise,

447
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:57,900
I like to look drink, but I think this could use more flavor. It only has a little bit of

448
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,580
spice when you, when you eat the noodles themselves. I only tasted a little bit of spice.

449
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:14,300
Very little sister behavior. She hates vegetables. I do hate vegetables. Um,

450
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:24,380
Amy, going for a scurvy speed run. I go through, I won't, I don't get scurvy because I go through

451
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:31,580
these phases where I eat like a lot of oranges at once every few months, right, right before my body

452
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:38,220
like feels like it's going to get scurvy. It craves a bunch of vegetable, not vegetables, oranges.

453
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:43,180
And then I buy like a whole bag of clementines and finish them in a day.

454
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:50,060
I hope nothing fell out.

455
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,500
Is it supposed to be spicy? I don't know. It says artificial chicken flavor.

456
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:01,980
It's, it doesn't, I guess it's kind of, it's kind of tastes like chicken.

457
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:16,380
Wait, I need to run.

458
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:24,940
That's why your hair is ginger. Yeah, I guess. I'm so happy it's finally ginger though.

459
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:30,620
I wasn't denial that it's ginger because it looked so blonde, you know, and now it's ginger.

460
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:41,420
Do you like spicy food? I do. I do like spicy food. This isn't very spicy though.

461
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:51,660
This is like, okay, the drink I'd rate it like, okay, I'm very picky. I'm a very, very picky eater,

462
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:56,860
okay? Just so you know, the drink I'd rate like an eight out of 10, like is pretty good.

463
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:02,300
The noodles I'd rate like a seven out of 10, maybe even a six.

464
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,060
Am I allowed to say that? It's good.

465
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:09,740
But I feel like,

466
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:20,540
I say it as I like scarf it down. Hold on. Okay. Noodle drama.

467
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,820
Amy gets dropped for rating the Gamer Sub's Noodle a seven out of 10.

468
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,620
They do put a lot in it though, which I appreciate. They definitely squeeze a lot in the small cup.

469
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:45,340
Because some, choking, because some companies will like do that thing where it looks like it's full,

470
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:49,900
but like at the bottom, they cut it off, but they put a shit ton of noodles in this cup.

471
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,020
I did try one of the energy bars. It was all right too.

472
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:03,020
Yeah, they do that half cup thing, but this one had a lot of noodles in it. I got it on my glasses.

473
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:11,980
Stranny was making me feel colorblind, calling the last year not fun. Me too, dude.

474
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:20,380
Me too. I think, I think Stranny might be a little bit colorblind.

475
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,940
I think she might be a little bit.

476
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:30,380
Like maybe just a little bit. I don't know. Or maybe the artist was a little bit colorblind.

477
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,700
Maybe they're both, maybe they both have the same kind of colorblind.

478
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:44,140
Um, because it was definitely, definitely blonde. It was a bright, bright blonde before,

479
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:48,460
but now it's definitely, definitely orange.

480
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:56,300
I feel like I still got splatters on my glasses. She was definitely coping.

481
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,100
Thank you for the $20 super chat.

482
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,340
Wait, I think these are old super chats that I'm hearing right now.

483
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:16,140
Yeah, these are old. Oh, sorry. It's now saying some old super chats in my ear,

484
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,580
but you haven't muted, so you don't hear it. In response to my last donation,

485
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,380
I meant that the title of the stream says, I bet you like kissing your sister.

486
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:30,700
I know. I know. I, I chose the title of the stream. I know what the title of the stream is.

487
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:40,380
You better be kissing your sister. I still have fucking droplets on my, what the fuck, on my glasses.

488
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,060
I'm, I'm breathing on them to wipe them.

489
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:53,500
Okay, whatever. I don't care anymore.

490
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,100
Yeah, the gifted subs are delaying the streamlabs. Don't know. Yep. Yep.

491
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:07,100
Okay. The concept art was a lot more ginger, which is what Strani was going off.

492
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,900
The artists definitely tried to make it blonde though. I don't know if they tried,

493
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:15,180
but yeah, the concept art was ginger. The model art was blonde for sure.

494
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:25,980
I love her so much, but her colors.

495
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,980
Recalling Strani over being colorblind.

496
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:42,780
She knows the title, but not what the color of her hair always was. Well,

497
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:50,780
I don't know. I was just confused cause I saw, I saw the concept art.

498
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:57,020
Oh, let me pull it up right now. Cause I feel like,

499
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:03,900
I feel like even the concept art switched from blonde to ginger too.

500
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,140
I feel like that was the case too.

501
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,540
Am I allowed to show my Google drive here?

502
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,740
I think I'm allowed to show the concept art.

503
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:33,260
And let me download them all. Download, download. I think Strani showed a good amount.

504
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:42,060
I'll show some of them, not all of them. Move over. Download. Download. There we go.

505
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,820
You do what you want. Yeah. Fuck the rules. I do whatever, whatever I want.

506
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:03,980
Is that a recent donal? It was. Okay, good. I can turn that back on.

507
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:09,580
Someone took $7 or $6.09. Thank you. It's easy to aim the hose while standing,

508
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,140
unless little sis wants to hold it instead.

509
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:20,300
I do want to hold it. Please let me hold it.

510
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,940
Please. Okay, let me show you then.

511
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:37,260
So I think the first concept was this. Oh, that's really big. It was this.

512
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:43,900
Which looks nothing like me. And by she's ginger, for sure. She's ginger here.

513
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,900
Did you do a helicopter with it? I saw a story. Why are you guys so gay?

514
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,540
It was a TikTok comment, I think. Oh, my phone's dying.

515
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,780
Shit, my phone is dying. Okay, it was a TikTok comment and it was like,

516
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:11,500
my husband doesn't let me hold it while he pees anymore because right before he pees,

517
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,700
I started to helicopter it and then he started peeing and it went everywhere,

518
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:20,380
which I think is really funny. Her name for Foster's? Yeah, Foster's home for,

519
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,740
I know who you're talking about. I know who you're talking about.

520
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,700
Something, I know, I know what you're talking about. Someone else said that too.

521
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:37,820
For imaginary friends.

522
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:44,620
I look like the red-head girl from Foster's home for imaginary friends, right? Yeah.

523
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,740
Yeah.

524
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:59,100
Women don't know what kind of weapon they're dealing with in those situations.

525
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:05,020
Her name is Frankie. I look like Frankie, for sure, especially like the ponytail

526
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:11,180
and the sweater too. Straight jorking it on.

527
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,700
Wow, we're not doing anything extra cool.

528
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:21,980
Thank you for the five dollars though. But this is ginger for sure.

529
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:28,220
And then I think, you know, we kind of had this, which is definitely ginger too.

530
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:45,500
And then they eventually got to like the current outfit, which is not downloading.

531
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,380
Allow.

532
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:57,340
This is the current outfit. That's not the current outfit.

533
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:04,300
Which one is the current outfit? Well, this is basically the current outfit, except with the

534
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:09,420
colors. But this is still ginger, but this is when it stops being ginger.

535
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:19,980
Here is where it stops being ginger. This is where I got un-ginger-fied and blonde-ified.

536
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:27,820
This is the culprit. You can see, I don't know who, I don't know which artists these are.

537
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:37,980
But also on tanned, I was never tanned in the first place. I don't know what happened here.

538
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,980
I was never supposed to be tanned, I don't think.

539
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:48,060
But yeah, this is where I got un-ginger-fied. And maybe this is what was shown to the model

540
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:55,900
artist. I have no clue. And that's when they created this. Why is the brightness so high on that?

541
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:03,180
I don't know. But that's when they created that. And this is blonde for sure. Blonde-ification.

542
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,820
The blonde-ification of a ginger.

543
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:16,220
And obviously the shorts are a little different. This isn't the finished model art or anything.

544
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:24,140
The head really swelled over time.

545
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:31,500
It's just the art style, okay? It's just the art style. Shut up, I don't have a big head.

546
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:36,060
I have a lot of thoughts, okay? I got a lot of stuff going on up there.

547
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,740
I mean, with a tan, it's kind of nice.

548
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:49,740
If you like a tan, go to Shibi. Shibi's getting tanned soon. They're gonna tan her up.

549
01:16:54,700 --> 01:17:01,500
I'm sticking my tongue in the package for the powder. I don't think I'll ever go tan, though.

550
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:06,620
Even for like summer models? I guess this could be considered like a summer model, right?

551
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:14,060
This could be considered like a summer model because I got like a cute sundress.

552
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:29,260
Who is Shibi? Come on, don't say you only watch me. Don't say you only watch me.

553
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:32,460
You have to know the other girls at least. At least know their names.

554
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:42,780
It's more of a fall vibe? I think it's a fall vibe because of my hair.

555
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:49,020
My hair is very much giving fall, but I feel like the dress itself is giving summers and not.

556
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,100
I don't know. I feel like it is.

557
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,740
I feel like it is. I don't know.

558
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:09,740
Yeah, I don't know any other girls.

559
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:21,900
But I think it would be really fun to like make more outfits. Maybe like um,

560
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,740
obviously they're all going to be scuffed because I made them.

561
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:32,060
I know we're doing one beamed outfit for everyone for a specific

562
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:44,460
holiday? Holiday? Is it a holiday? I know we're doing one beamed for everyone for a specific holiday, but

563
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:54,620
um, I forgot what I was going to say.

564
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:03,420
But because I have, you know, the ability to make more, why not make more? You know,

565
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,060
why not make more? It's fun.

566
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,820
I mean, I was hella stressed, but look, the end result is fun.

567
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,020
Rat costume for Halloween? Maybe.

568
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:29,580
Halloween fit? Possibly. Maybe even a Christmas fit too, but I think Christmas fit. I don't know if

569
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:36,060
we'll all do Christmas fit. Christmas fit might just be my doing. I might just do it myself.

570
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:45,260
I don't know. It might be really stressful for me.

571
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:58,300
But it could be worth it. Santa's slutty little ginger help.

572
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:05,420
No, I don't want to make it slutty. I don't want to make it slutty.

573
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:13,820
I'll try to take it easy. I'll try. I don't know. I don't like to, I don't really like

574
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:19,900
slutty outfits that much, not in real life or like on my models, so.

575
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,940
Elf? Elf would be cute. I could make my ears like long.

576
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,660
A gingerbread girl? That would be cute too. That would be really fitting.

577
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,980
You gotta give us at least one slutty outfit, but I don't know. I don't like slutty. I feel like

578
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:53,580
I feel like even my, um, my 2.0 is pretty slutty. Like, it's slutty for me.

579
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:56,380
Like, how much slutty do you want me to go?

580
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,540
Oh.

581
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:12,220
You know, like my current, like, like this outfit, this outfit is pretty slutty too.

582
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,740
Is it not slutty?

583
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,620
All I want for Christmas is my little sister.

584
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,540
Why are you acting so gay?

585
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,740
You'll get her. Don't worry. Maybe I'll stream on Christmas. I don't know.

586
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:42,060
I don't know if I'll be visiting my mom or not for Christmas. We'll see.

587
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:47,740
Um, thank you for the ten dollars and thank you for the three dollars anonymous.

588
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,300
Your brother likes them. Isn't that enough to wear at least one or two?

589
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:52,380
Please pleading face?

590
01:21:54,940 --> 01:22:02,060
Um, you could 100% do a nightmare before Christmas style outfit. Mix of Halloween and Christmas stuff.

591
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:09,580
But I already am doing a Halloween outfit and I already decided what it is.

592
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:19,180
Um, they mean they want big boobs. Oh, I can't do that. No.

593
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:22,300
I don't, I don't want to, um,

594
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:30,460
I don't know. Just personally, I don't think it's a good idea for me to change my body type,

595
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:39,980
um, for my model. I think it'll take away, like, the recognizability of myself, if that makes sense.

596
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,980
Like, people recognize the character, you know?

597
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:51,260
And if I change the body type to have big boobs and big, big, big, big, I don't know, big hips and big eyes.

598
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:56,780
There is sexiness in the imagined. Want Timmy in a full non-outfit. Telling me I've signed.

599
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,820
Telling you you've signed. You've signed.

600
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,820
Signed?

601
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:16,380
Yeah, it seems like some of your removable shorts. It's not allowed on YouTube. Even Strani and, um,

602
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:25,420
Strani and Mercy have to cover their, their crotches because it's so, like, revealing, you know?

603
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,420
No.

604
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,620
Signed.

605
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:39,580
Thank you for the five dollars and the, the other five dollars.

606
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:46,220
I think there is a non, a non-outfit on Booth that I can buy.

607
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,180
It could be a big sis version. I don't know.

608
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:55,740
I don't know if I'd want a big sis version, though.

609
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,540
On your birthday, can we get a birthday suit? No.

610
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:12,140
Why did they make models for a YouTube company that they can't show on YouTube? Is it a statement?

611
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:19,180
I don't know. I mean, they can show me on YouTube perfectly fine. And they can show I see on YouTube perfectly fine.

612
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,140
Um.

613
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:33,500
It's not all of us, but that's okay because we're getting, um, Azir is getting a cover up for her giant boobas.

614
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:40,060
Now don't worry. Don't freak out just yet. Don't, don't, don't go crazy. Don't freak out.

615
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:44,220
You'll still see him. You'll still see her boobs. I know. I know it's scary

616
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:47,420
and you might be thinking, oh my god, I'm never gonna see Azir's boobs ever again.

617
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,220
You'll still see her boobs.

618
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
Um.

619
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
It's just, um,

620
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
not as like

621
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:04,460
obvious, I guess. I saw what it looks like. It's very cute. It's very, very fitting for her, um,

622
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,140
for her design.

623
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:13,580
But she constantly has to wear, um, like, I think she uses like a,

624
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:19,740
uh, what's it called? Let me see. She uses like a boba cup or something, right?

625
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:23,740
To cover her boob crack.

626
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,700
I'm checking her stream right now.

627
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,260
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

628
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,940
Oh, she doesn't use it anymore.

629
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:42,300
She used to, or maybe she's just covering it by going really low on the screen.

630
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,900
That could be possible, too.

631
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,180
I don't know.

632
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:01,500
Um, honestly, the gap between your cuteness on YouTube and your sweatiness upstream is the

633
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,140
best gap in the way ever.

634
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:09,820
Okay, Lee, I need you to explain gap in the way to me. I don't know what it means. What does gap in the way mean?

635
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:14,860
Um, thank you for the two dollars, though.

636
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:22,460
The full models are for member streams. Oh, that makes sense. That makes sense. If you want to see the goods,

637
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:28,620
you got to go on the membership streams. If you want to see their naked crutches.

638
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,820
Covered can sometimes be hotter than open.

639
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, you're right.

640
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:54,940
I underestimated how severe YouTube was gonna be. Needed the models to meet the vibe for the company. That's probably it. Yeah.

641
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,620
So for me, I feel like I would have been fine. Like,

642
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:08,700
I'm definitely a covered is more sexy than revealing kind of person.

643
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:12,860
Just a little tease, you know? Just a little tease is good enough for me.

644
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:17,820
As long as it's fashionable.

645
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:34,220
Gapmoy is the difference between how someone acts such looks in one context and act such looks in the other.

646
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:38,780
Someone who has one attitude, then suddenly they have another more endearing one.

647
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:42,300
Oh, it means the cute effect when someone does something unusual.

648
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:49,820
Strani with a lollipop model would be another case of Gapmoy. That would be so cute. I think a lot of people want that.

649
01:27:56,060 --> 01:28:00,380
Like a serious office lady, but in private, she's really cute and childish and sweet.

650
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:07,980
I'm not serious on Twitter, though. I guess I am a little different.

651
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:20,460
Mercy has gap between her dorkiness and her yandere behavior. People find it cute. Mercy is cute. She's very, very cute.

652
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:31,420
Lolli mode for every girl. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but

653
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:34,380
it would be funny.

654
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,580
It would be funny.

655
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:53,580
I don't know if like, because if the other, if we do like um, okay, it's getting more spicy now because I'm going home, um,

656
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:58,860
I'm getting the liquid only. I ate all the noodles already.

657
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:07,260
I think it would be funny if we switched roles in like all of the like other girls when Lolli

658
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:15,180
and um, me and I see went like big boobie girl as like a joke, like a

659
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,300
like a one-time thing, like a

660
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:24,860
like an April Fools kind of thing, but I don't even know if I see who would want to do that.

661
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,820
Yeah, like April Fools

662
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,500
I don't know if she'd be up for that. I would be up for that because I think it's funny.

663
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,780
Yeah, I'm gonna drink the liquid now.

664
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,620
Although liquid is definitely more spicy.

665
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,420
Age progression.

666
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:58,300
It probably wouldn't be a great quality model, obviously, if we're only gonna use it for one day.

667
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,260
It'd probably just be like a little silly joke.

668
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:11,180
I feel like it'd be silly to like, oh gosh, really spicy in my throat.

669
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:18,220
It'd be silly to like spend a bunch on a one day kind of model. Yeah, like the NGTubers.

670
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:24,860
Something like that. Maybe I have no clue what their plans are. I'm just speculating. I'm just speculating.

671
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:38,300
This was good. This was really good. I haven't eaten much.

672
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:47,180
I ate breakfast. I ate breakfast and then I worked on the model the whole time until I started streaming, so I was kind of hungry.

673
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,700
But I'm done now. Yippee!

674
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:03,820
That was lean? No, that was the rest of the noodles.

675
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:15,500
Um, can we get the dress back? Full Cunny vibes? Sure. Here you go.

676
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,860
Hey guys, sneeze a little bit.

677
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:30,220
No, not yesterday. Today, today, today. I only ate breakfast and then I kind of just worked on the model the whole time until stream. That's all.

678
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:37,500
Not yesterday. I've eaten since yesterday. Don't worry, I've eaten since yesterday.

679
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:51,740
I'm not the kind of person that that skips meals or anything. Don't worry about me. I don't do that. I'm, I'm Abby Eaton.

680
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:57,100
I remember, I was talking to the most, I don't know when it was, but she was like, oh,

681
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:03,820
are you the kind of person that like lets your lights go off, but makes sure that you're like eating good? And I was like, yeah.

682
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:13,980
I'll, I'll let them turn off my, my electricity and my water before I start skipping meals. You fucking bet, you fucking bet your ass.

683
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:19,420
I, uh, I'm not the kind of person that skips meals ever.

684
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:23,820
Or at least not anymore.

685
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:33,580
Which model with a sexy mode slash spell toggles? What is a sexy mode? What do you mean by that?

686
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:38,060
Are you a mimosa or the big eaters? It's adorable.

687
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,660
Ever since I met like all these other, um,

688
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:50,860
like company vtuber girls, it's like a whole other world.

689
01:32:51,660 --> 01:33:00,140
It's like completely different from, uh, from indies. Cause like, I feel like everyone knows each other.

690
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:07,500
Everyone like knows, like everyone's in talks with each other. Everyone's friends with each other. Everyone knows what's going on with each other.

691
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:16,620
But it's like, because not a lot of companies want to associate with us, I'm like finding out from like my one friend that knows from other girls.

692
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,260
And I'm like, whoa.

693
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,380
Sorority vibes, yeah.

694
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:35,260
Um, do you think it's possible for a sexy model stream in the future? You want sexy so badly from me? I'm not here to be sexy. I'm be, I'm here to look cute. What do you mean?

695
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,260
Oh

696
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:51,580
My god, uh, yeah, also I'm already sexy. What do you mean? I don't know what you're talking about.

697
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:56,940
I don't even have to try.

698
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,580
Uh

699
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:09,740
Yeah, the shoulders are so so so so eggs. I can't say I feel like I shouldn't say sexy too much

700
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,540
Exy

701
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,540
Exy

702
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,860
Oh

703
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,940
It's weird how surprising

704
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:30,380
It's weird how surprisingly connected different groups are. Yeah, like it's way more connected than the indie

705
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:32,540
um

706
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:38,460
I feel like it's more connected than indie because obviously there's way more indie people than there are like people in companies which makes

707
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,340
Sense that makes sense

708
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,220
But it's like

709
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,300
Everyone knows each other

710
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,300
Which is cool

711
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,540
Because I don't know anyone

712
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:55,900
I'm not really one to like reach out to people too much. So that's probably why I don't know that many people

713
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,780
Mercy knows everyone though

714
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:05,260
Mercy was like, oh, yeah, um blank from this company. I used to be friends with them before they joined that company and I was like, huh?

715
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:11,420
How do you know all these people? How are you friends with all these people before they joined companies? What the fuck?

716
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,140
What the fuck

717
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:20,860
I don't know what people are asking for when they mean sexier. I don't know either like lingerie

718
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,460
Or something

719
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:32,620
Turned on by her neck

720
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:41,500
You like my neck it can get really really long if I like

721
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,460
Do that

722
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,060
It can get pretty long

723
01:35:54,700 --> 01:36:01,660
Yes, mercy is very connected. I'm surprised she hasn't done more outside uh collabs, but maybe the

724
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:07,180
Oh my god, my freaking I got a bug bite on my foot and it's so itchy

725
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:11,100
It's like so bad that it it's caused a scab and I'm like

726
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:14,220
Itching the scab because it's so itchy

727
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:22,540
If it two hands you bet you you bet it can

728
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,020
Oh sexy stuff for other site stuff

729
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,420
Um

730
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:37,580
Probably not

731
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:42,060
Other sites don't allow it. I don't know what to tell you

732
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:47,500
And I'm not gonna stream on like a site that is not a popular or mainstream

733
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:51,280
Scab picking ASMR. Oh my god

734
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,860
No, no, I can't do that that would be fun

735
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:03,980
That would be fun, but I can't I can't I shouldn't I shouldn't I can't encourage it. It's not good

736
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,140
Don't encourage it in me

737
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,660
Oh my god, Kai foes streaming right now

738
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:18,060
Should we go raid Kai foe? Oh, she's crocheting. I didn't know she knew how to crochet. What the fuck?

739
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:24,700
If you don't know Kai foes a friend of mine, and I'm also her model mama

740
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,900
You could just say it's roleplay that's not gonna stop me from getting banned. What do you mean?

741
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:35,820
I think we might go raid Kai foe

742
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:53,180
It's not that I want to leave you but I'm not I'm hot and I'm also tired and um

743
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,540
I forgot what I was gonna say

744
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:04,300
I have a stream tomorrow, right? Don't I don't I have a stream tomorrow

745
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:10,300
There's another exciting thing happening tomorrow the uh, there's the

746
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,620
I didn't know you were a model mama

747
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:21,260
I'm a model entire parental unit, but um, it's mostly from when I was like a beginner

748
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:25,180
So I don't think that they're that great

749
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:33,660
But yeah, I just don't I don't like really talk much about it, but yeah

750
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:46,460
Yes, I'm the whole parental unit I've done it all I've birthed many children out of this tired tired couch

751
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:51,580

752
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,380

753
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:56,380
Five I don't know

754
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:00,140
Maybe it's five. I don't know the whole number. I don't I don't keep track

755
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:05,100
After a couple hours like the appeal came from the forbidden love role play thing

756
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:11,100
Also, keep your ac slash fin on during streams. It's about noise. You stay cool

757
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:16,620
Okay, well, I care about noise, but thank you for the five dollars

758
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:20,860
Uh came from the forbidden love role play. Yeah, I did come from that too

759
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:26,540
I think people just want more they're kind of whores. They're kind of sluts and they want more

760
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,980

From my own kunani

765
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,300
And made by myself

766
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:51,180
Um

767
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:58,060
Because I made models to buy a computer

768
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,860
One two three four

769
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:08,540
So four and then if you want to count myself

770
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:13,420
It's five that I've made completely by myself and then I'm

771
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,420
Um

772
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:23,340
And then I'm two more people's model mamas only so that means I only did their art and I didn't do the rig

773

Yeah

774
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:27,420
That's it

775
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,420
Are we getting a 20k celebration stream? I don't know

776
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,300
I still have to do the art for for 10k

01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,380

You want me to be a milf? What are you giving me these tags?

782
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:06,620

783
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,380
I did not draw this one

784
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,380
No, I can't take credit for this one. No

785
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:14,300
10k was the feet feet

786
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:18,060
The feet

787
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,380
The what

788
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:24,380
Integrate the 20k art into the 10k art

789
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:32,220
I could just can I move the the the 10k art to the 20k art

790
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:44,300
Feet for 20k did I say that feet cam have I said this before?

791
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:48,620
What

792
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:51,100
Are you like gaslighting me right now?

793
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:57,500
I swear I've never talked about feet cam viacam

794
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,020
The perfect groove

795
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,100
What

796
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,060
Celebration

797
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:10,620
What

798
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,380
Did I say I'd do a feet cam for 20k?

799
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:18,620
The thigh cam was strongy

800
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:25,500
I know I would never say I would do a thigh cam, but maybe I would say I would do a feet cam

801
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:31,740
You did drunk toe painting back or way back already. Yeah

802
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:37,260
Rat cam I can't do a rat cam because they're constantly moving around the cage

803
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:39,660
um

804
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:43,260
And it would not be very easy to see them if I did like

805
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:51,260
A full cage cam. I don't know the cage is also very busy. So it's very easy for them to just

806
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:54,060
Not be visible to you

807
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,460
um

808
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,500
Sit back and get groomed to me, huh?

809
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:09,900
Rat race I can't do a rat race. They're not gonna want to listen to me telling them to race each other

810
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,260
um

811
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:17,980
We could do a foot some kind of foot stream though. I think that would be cool

812
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:22,060
I don't know. I don't I'm scared to plan for 20k because I feel like

813
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:27,180
I feel like the growth is gonna stop and we're not gonna get to 20k that soon

814
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:32,380
But that might just be me being pessimistic. I don't know. You know, I mean

815
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:41,500
We're looking forward to the 20k feet cam. Okay. Okay. We'll do a 20k foot cam. Okay

816
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:49,420
Okay, it's not gonna be tomorrow. It's not gonna be tomorrow. Um, but we'll we'll do a 20k foot cam. I'm not sure what

817
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:54,140
I'm not sure what I'll do with my feet. Um

818
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,100
I've drawn chat

819
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:02,780
Request was my with my feet before and that was really fun. Would you want that? Should I reuse my old idea?

820
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:05,020
Do you want me to

821
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:09,500
You're doom posting. I know why I am I am the doom poster

822
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,140
I doom post everything

823
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:16,700
I'm dooming my whole my whole every single thought I have is a doom post. Okay

824
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:20,140
You don't know how much I've stopped myself from tweeting doom

825
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:29,500
Um, yeah, we're using content. Yeah, do you want me to do like some kind of drawings with my feet? Do you think that'll be fun?

826
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:39,500
You could do what strani did for ASMR. I don't think I want to copy strani

827
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:45,180
Popping cooking but feet only I don't have the dexterity with my toes to do that

828
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:52,540
I

829
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:57,500
Tweet more doom posting. No, I don't want to worry people. I don't want to worry people

830
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:03,180
Literally just me saying that I lost my marbles had people would like being like, oh, I hope she's okay

831
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:08,220
I'm fine. I'm fine. I was just going a little crazy over the model, but I'm fine

832
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,260
So I don't want to doom post

833
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:14,940
You want me to oil up my feet

834
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:18,140
You want to make me all shiny

835
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:21,260
How am I supposed to hold the the markers?

836
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:27,580
How am I supposed to hold the markers if they're all old if my toes are all oiled up and and slippery?

837
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:33,420
You want me to oil up my feet?

838
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:37,180
Oh an apartment tour would be cool too

839
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:42,380
An apartment tour would be cool too. Okay. How about this?

840
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:46,220
I kind of have to fart, but I'm not gonna fart in the mic

841
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:49,180
How about this? Um

842
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,780
How do I

843
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:59,420
Um, how do I go back to youtube here?

844
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,500
You can choose between

845
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:09,100
Wait, you can choose what we do for um 20 k. Okay

846
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:11,900
You can choose what we do

847
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,700
Okay, I'm gonna put a poll

848
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,660
So we're either going to

849
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:25,580
Do an apartment tour now. This isn't going to be me walking around my apartment with a camera

850
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:31,020
Um, that's like live. That's way too dangerous. Uh, that's not gonna happen

851
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:37,100
I will probably just take photos of everything and try to be as like in depth as possible

852
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:42,300
And then I'll show you the photos on stream. Okay, so I'm not going to be walking around my apartment live on camera

853
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:46,060
Um, that's too dangerous. So it's either in an apartment tour

854
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:49,580
I'll make sure to pixel me

855
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:57,420
Just to specify because I don't want people to choose apartment or thinking that's what it'll be and then um

856
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:06,620
Oiled up what feet? I got oiled up drawing with feet

857
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:11,100
Okay, um

858
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:18,380
What should we do for 20 k there start pull

859
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:24,620
Feet will win. I don't know

860
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:30,140
Okay, yeah feet is winning

861
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:36,780
When did you lose your marbles should we go find them? No, don't worry. I I'm slowly getting them back

862
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:42,380
It's Johnny collab thumb style toe war what?

863
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:48,060
Do you want me to collab with straw me for 20k? We can do that. I haven't done that yet

864
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:54,780
I kind of want to do an ASMR collab with straw me. She's been doing ASMR collabs with everyone except for me

865
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,500
I'm kidding. I'm kidding

866
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:00,940
I think that'd be cool

867
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:03,100
Um

868
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:06,780
Oh, shit, it's kind of close. It's kind of close

869
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:19,180
We'll get there eventually I think she is doing an ASMR collab with all the girls eventually she was writing that once I remember

870
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:23,100
Your feet guy

871
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:28,860
Maybe the apartment tour can be like uh 30k

872
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:33,260
Uh 30 k sound so far away though. I'm sorry. I don't know

873
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,300
25

874
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:41,500
I don't know like I don't I I don't know how fast the growth will continue

875
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:46,780
So I don't want to be like I don't want to say 30 k in case 30 k is in like 10 months, you know

876
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,500
I don't know

877
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:54,700
Okay, it seems like the oiled up drawing with feet um one

878
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:56,700
So

879
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:01,180
I will

880
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:07,180
Draw try to draw with my feet for 20k, I guess

882
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,780
Because I really really want good quality for handcams and stuff. Um

883
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:21,340
Because I'm gonna do so many of them, you know

884
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:26,940
But yeah, 30 k will be apartment tour and then um 20 k will be drawing up drawing with my feet

885
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:37,580

01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:46,140
Yeah, okay, I believe you I believe you sure sure sure

887
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:49,100
I

01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:53,100
Feet cam apartment tour, that's not even an apartment tour. That's a floor tour

889
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:58,300
You want me to show you my dirty ass floors? You don't want to see my floors. They're so gross

890
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:02,380
I like never fucking mop. It's really gross

891
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:06,700
And I definitely don't vacuum as much as I should

892
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:11,580
It would be it would be a floor tour

893
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:18,300
I'll show you all my disgusting dirty dusty like

894
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,500
My gross floors

895
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:24,620
You never hire a maid. What the fuck kind of

896
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:30,140
What the fuck kind of millionaire do I look like hire a maid?

897
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:33,020
hire a maid

898
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:36,140
Like a topless maid maybe but no

899
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:40,460
No, I would not I don't I don't hire maids

900
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:47,660
Do you guys hire maids? Is that a thing? Is that like common? I thought that was like a like a fancy person thing

901
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:54,860
Dirty floors is what you want. You want to be my topless maid. Do you want to be my topless maid?

902
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:03,820
No, not topless by just legs. I mean topless like without a shirt

903
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:08,140
A maid cosplay while you do the tour

904
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,100
What do you mean?

905
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:15,180
You made I could do a cleaning stream

906
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:17,820
Where I dress up

907
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:21,020
In a maid cosplay and just clean my house

908
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,980
I don't know

909
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:28,860
Why aren't you the topless maid?

910
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:34,300
Because I don't want to be you should be the topless maid. It's your job to take care of me, right?

911
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:38,700
So at least entertain me while you do it and get topless

912
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:53,900
Maybe it's a yeah, maybe it's a cultural difference thing. Maybe some cultures hire maids more commonly than others

913
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:57,260
Here in Canada, it's not really common to do that

914
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:06,540
You

915
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:10,060
Chat being the Lulu as usual

916
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,940
Stroni hired a maid

917
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,900
Oh

918
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:19,980
They're after me

919
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,820
Police are after me

920
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:27,900
I just heard sirens as she should Stroni works very hard and I'm sure she doesn't have a lot of time to be cleaning

921
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:34,780
What's the hourly rate um a kiss on the forehead every hour

922
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:40,780
Every hour you work for me. You earn one kiss on the forehead. That's your rate

923
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:48,220
What if I wear nothing but an apron? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you can wear a naked apron till

924
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:53,660
To clean that's a little more dangerous. So what if you use like dangerous cleaning products?

925
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:58,620
You don't want to be naked sitting, you know getting bleach all over your skin or something

926
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:07,260
50 per minute. Nah, you're too expensive. I can't favor that. I can't favor 50 per minute

927
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:11,420
No

928
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:21,180
Touching is extra. Okay, touching can be one extra per hour. Okay

929
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:31,340
It's so easy to groom you into what I want. It's so funny

930
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:34,860
I they make one joke

931
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:42,940
About liking watching boys kiss and everyone suddenly turns gay and then I make one joy joke about you being my topless maid

932
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,100
And now you're like topless. Why why don't I just be naked?

933
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:51,820
Why topless let me just let me just get fully naked

934
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:56,220
Oh

935
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:02,060
Kisses on the feet be bonus incentives. You want to kiss you want me to kiss your feet?

936
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:05,100
What?

937
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:08,700
I guess as long as you clean them clean your feet

938
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,860
No, I'm not complaining. I just think it's cute and funny

939
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,500
I just think it's cute

940
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:20,140
I

941
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:23,740
Okay, um

942
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:33,420

943
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:46,780
Oh, and I just want to make sure that this person is not ending their stream

944
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:50,540
Before I raid because that would be awkward

945
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:53,580
